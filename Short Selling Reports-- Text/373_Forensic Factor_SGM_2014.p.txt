Stonegate Mortgage - A Value Trap With Dubious Adjusted Financials
Jun. 22, 2014 1:30 PM ET9 comments
by: The Forensic Factor


Summary


We believe Stonegate Mortgage investors will suffer significant losses as many
issues we identify play out. We have well-researched reservations about the
viability/sustainability of its business model.


We believe management changed definitions for adjusted earnings without
appropriate disclosures, and excluded recurring expenses (that don't reconcile).
Both appear violations of SEC reporting guidelines (Reg G).


Stonegate continues to raise capital on overstated projections and an MSR mark
32% higher than its peers. Sellside estimates have declined nearly 50% in eight
months.


We believe sell-side estimates are 67% too high, and at least 33% downside exists
in the stock, and significantly more should its correspondent mortgage model fail to
attract new capital.


We have shared past opinions on Seeking Alpha about a diverse group of companies.
Two of the companies we exposed have either been sued by the SEC for fraud or
effectively delisted (AutoChina and Telestone), while Voxeljet has declined more than 75%
since our submission and Tangoe has declined 30%. We believe Stonegate Mortgage
(NYSE:SGM) investors will suffer significant losses as many of the issues we identify play
out over the next year. We have well-researched reservations about the viability of its
business model. Further, we have identified inconsistencies and alterations to its adjusted
earnings definitions and tables that overstate pro-forma results. As a result of our
research, which is thoroughly documented herein, we believe Stonegate has
misrepresented its pro-forma reporting, potentially violated SEC guidelines on pro-forma
reporting (as supported in a later section), while misleading investors and analysts.


In this report, we expose numerous similarities between Stonegate's model and
management team, and the infamous business practices so prevalent during the subprime
mortgage meltdown. We detail Stonegate management's links to some of the most
abusive mortgage companies from the past decade, as well as the peculiar role the CEO's
wife has played at the company. We clearly illustrate how management has used "ramp-

up" expenses and other large add backs to keep disappointing results from looking even
worse - including altering the treatment quarter-to-quarter of the marks on its mortgage
pipeline. We also analyze the aggressive marks Stonegate has used on its "prized" MSR
asset, which includes a capitalization rate that is 32% higher than ten leading mortgage
companies. The associated non-cash capitalized servicing rights have constituted over
85% of revenue and over 100% of earnings since Stonegate came public. Finally, we
discuss why Stonegate will run out of money and need to pursue a debt or equity raise
imminently. Taken together, it is our opinion that all investors, including those in the 144
round and IPO, have every right to feel they were provided with an inflated story and
projections.


Assuming we are correct, there is significant downside to the stock as investors realize the
bull thesis is not only apocryphal and based on conflicted (and at least to-date inaccurate)
research, but may also warrant regulatory scrutiny. We believe the stock is worth $9.50
per share in a best case scenario, which assumes Stonegate maintains access to capital
and is not a casualty of another shake-out in the mortgage market.


We have unsuccessfully attempted to reach the company via the IR submission channel.
Should management or IR respond to our concerns and questions, we will happily update
our submission.


[Author's comment - Stonegate filed an 8K on 6/16/14, with no associated press release,
disclosing its President submitted his resignation on 6/10/14. While likely a coincidence,
we do not think it is unreasonable to ask if his resignation was related to the detailed
concerns we have raised. He owned 611,542 shares according to the 3/28/14 proxy.]


Raising Money on Unreasonable Earnings Estimates


Stonegate Mortgage is a wholesale funded mortgage company founded in 2005. Since the
company's inception, equity and convertible preferred stock have been the primary
sources of funding. In May 2013, Stonegate issued nearly 6.4 million shares in a private
144 offering at $18 per share, raising $115 million of gross proceeds. We believe the
underwriter of that deal (based on the guidance of management) was using earnings
estimates of $3.50 and $6.00 per share for 2014 and 2015, which incidentally
approximated consensus estimates in the original underwriter initiations post-IPO. Despite
the unfavorable compression of mortgage rates and agency MBS, Stonegate
management and underwriters pitched the inflated estimates to sell 7.1 million shares in
an IPO at $16 per share on October 10, 2013. As we demonstrate throughout this report,
Stonegate management and its sell-side supporters have been wildly aggressive with

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2280753-stonegate-mortgage-a-value-trap-with-dubious-adjusted-financials 3/22


earnings estimates, presumably due to Stonegate's persistent need to access the capital
markets. For example, the first set of consensus earnings estimates published in 2013
were for Stonegate to earn $3.35 in 2014. Since coming public, Stonegate has missed
every quarterly estimate and 2014 analyst earnings estimates have collapsed from $3.35
to $1.65 in just eight months.

We believe the consistent string of disappointments will continue in coming quarters.
Outside of a late 2012 Federal Reserve induced bubble for gain-on-sale mortgage
margins, Stonegate has done little to demonstrate a sustainable business model capable
of producing consistent earnings. Part of the explanation for the company's collapsing
earnings resides in its generic business model. Stonegate management has attempted to
present its business model as "differentiated." The facts would seem to unequivocally
refute management's claim of differentiation. The mortgage business has low barriers to
entry and is broadly a commoditized business. Stonegate is predominantly a
correspondent mortgage originator, which is the most commoditized segment of the
mortgage market. As such, the correspondent mortgage business has historically only
generated reasonable profits in the sweet spot of a mortgage cycle. In 2013, Stonegate

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2280753-stonegate-mortgage-a-value-trap-with-dubious-adjusted-financials 4/22


originated $8.7 billion of mortgages, of which 93% were produced in the low margin
correspondent and wholesale channels. The remaining 7% of originations were derived
from the growing, yet expensive, retail origination channel. In staunch contrast to
management's assertions that their model is differentiated, it appears unlikely that a
generic correspondent lender can produce consistent earnings over the next few years
without a dramatic change in market conditions or the competitive landscape.


We would argue Stonegate's focus on the "mini-correspondent" makes it more risky than a
typical correspondent lender. Stonegate is willing to acquire mortgages (and assume the
resulting liabilities) from tiny mortgage originators who have little capital on their balance
sheets. As a result, any meaningful level of putback requests could leave these "mom and
pop" originators impaired, potentially leaving Stonegate on the hook for the losses. We
have been unable to get a satisfactory answer to the potential liability Stonegate could
have under this putback scenario. In addition, the stand-alone, publicly traded wholesale
funded mortgage model lives a delicate existence. As we discuss later, Stonegate's model
requires constant access to funding, which can of course explain why management and its
banking analysts have been so aggressive (and errant) setting earnings expectations.


The combination of a competitive market and the incessant need to raise capital should
result in a high risk, low multiple valuation for Stonegate's shares. We believe
management's questionable history and signs of repeated execution failures should
further compress Stonegate's multiple.


Management's Past Failures and Value Destruction


The mortgage market faced extremely challenging conditions following the housing crisis
of the last decade. Only a handful of mortgage companies emerged unscathed, while
almost all mortgage executives were left battered and bruised. However, it would appear
Stonegate has assembled a management team with a unique level of value destruction at
their prior firms. Stonegate's failure to hit Wall Street forecasts, and the company-specific
risk in the event of a mortgage shake-out, make management's history with failed
mortgage companies quite relevant in assessing investment merits. The table below
illustrates how Stonegate's executives seem to have had really bad luck, as so many
executives came from companies that destroyed immense value. Management's past
mortgage experience is littered with some of the most prominent failed mortgage
companies, such as Novastar, IndyMac, Irwin, Saxon, and Homeward. While the
concentration of failure is a concern, what is more alarming about the list of management's
5/19/2018 Stonegate Mortgage - A Value Trap With Dubious Adjusted Financials - Stonegate Mortgage Corporation (NYSE:SGM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2280753-stonegate-mortgage-a-value-trap-with-dubious-adjusted-financials 5/22


failed predecessor companies is that many were considered to have used highly
questionable underwriting, unscrupulous business practices, and even highly controversial
accounting (here, here and here… among many other sources).


Most of Stonegate's senior executive team worked together at GMAC Residential Capital
("ResCap"), which was previously known as GMAC and currently named Ally Financial
(NYSE:ALLY). ResCap was the residential mortgage origination and servicing arm of
GMAC. According to USA Today, ResCap was "aggressive in the subprime market,
making risky loans without serious reviews of borrowers' credit histories… [and] took huge
losses when the housing bubble burst." As a result of its reckless model, ResCap took an
unfathomable $22 billion of mortgage write-downs from 2009 to 2011. Largely because of
ResCap, the U.S. Treasury Department provided three rounds of tax payer funded
bailouts to GMAC totaling $17.3 billion. Despite this unprecedented level of U.S.
Government support, Ally still placed its ResCap subsidiary into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
May 2012. By December 2013, ResCap was liquidated through the Chapter 11 process.
Given management's history, we find it ironic Stonegate has included the following
statement in every SEC registration statement:


"We believe that our relentless focus on quality and consistency in applying
underwriting policies and procedures has enabled us to have no significant
repurchase demands, thus minimizing our risk profile and differentiating us from
much of our competition."


One other peculiarity worth noting about management is the prominent role Barbara
Cutillo has played at Stonegate since its founding. Mrs. Cutillo, who happens to be the
wife of CEO/Co-Founder Jim Cutillo, served as the CFO of Stonegate from 2005 until April
2013, just prior to the 144 offering. The 144 investors have suffered significant losses as

the company raised equity on the heels of highly inflated earnings estimates. After nearly
eight years as CFO, Stonegate filings disclose Mrs. Cutillo transitioned in April 2013 to
Chief Administrative Officer, carrying the seemingly multi-person responsibilities of
"strategic planning, legal, human resources, and corporate communications." To be fair
Mrs. Cutillo may be perfectly qualified to wear the CFO hat, as well as the legal, HR, biz
dev, and corporate communication hats - all at the same time. Qualified or not, we have
always had an elevated degree of skepticism towards husband-and-wife management
teams, which was reinforced recently by the prominent Puda Coal husband/wife fraud. It is
not however unprecedented for a mortgage company to be run by a husband and wife
team. Golden West Financial was famously run for many years by Herb and Marion
Sandler before selling to Wachovia near the peak of the housing market. While a boon for
the Sandlers, it was Golden West's pick-a-pay option arm/liar loans that were widely
credited with causing the liquidity induced "run on the bank" at Wachovia a few years later.


Stonegate's "Questionable" Earnings Adjustments Warrant SEC Scrutiny (2-Part)


We believe Stonegate has utilized highly questionable pro-forma earnings adjustments.
Given the SEC's renewed focus on manipulative pro-forma earnings adjustments, we
believe Stonegate could make a perfect example for SEC enforcement. SEC Reg. G
requires companies reporting non-GAAP results provide an "equal or greater prominence"
to the GAAP equivalent items. One clear guideline of Reg G is what companies can and
cannot exclude from non-GAAP results as well as the expected consistency of pro-forma
reporting. The SEC posted a "Pro Forma Financial Information: Tips for investors" page on
its website reiterating its commitment to its release: "Cautionary Advice Regarding the Use
of 'Pro Forma' Financial Information in Earnings Releases." In that release, the SEC
stated (our emphasis):


We are concerned that "pro forma" financial information, under certain
circumstances, can mislead investors if it obscures GAAP results. Because this
"pro forma" financial information by its very nature departs from traditional
accounting conventions, its use can make it hard for investors to compare an
issuer's financial information with other reporting periods and with other
companies. For these reasons, we believe it is appropriate to alert public
companies … [that] the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws
apply to a company issuing "pro forma" financial information. Because "pro
forma" information is information derived by selective editing of financial information
compiled in accordance with GAAP, companies should be particularly mindful of
their obligation not to mislead investors when using this information.

A legal brief issued by respected law firm Dorsey & Whitney following the SEC release
highlighted areas of concern regarding corporate abuse of pro-forma reporting, including:


pro-forma results that are "inadequately explained, [or] actually used to impede
comparability or when it omits material elements in an effort to obscure or recast
GAAP results"
"tricky assumptions used to turn a GAAP loss into a pro forma profit, including an
assumption that a proposed transaction has actually occurred or that a cost or charge
has not."


It is our opinion that Stonegate has abused pro-forma reporting guidelines, and in the
process, violated the exact antifraud provisions referenced by the SEC above. In the
following paragraphs, we provide several examples that seem to directly violate the SEC
guidelines surrounding: 1) adjustments that make it difficult to compare financial
information with other reporting periods 2) adjustments that make it difficult to compare
company financial information with other companies 3) the obligation not to mislead
investors 4) the inadequate explanation of adjustments and 5) "tricky" assumptions used
to turn GAAP losses into pro forma profit.


1)"Ramp-Up" Expense Exclusions Appear Overstated and Are Not "One-time" Items


We believe Stonegate has been providing "adjusted earnings" that misrepresent the
economics of its business. After reviewing hundreds of earnings reports from various
mortgage companies, we have found very few examples of companies that take the
extreme liberties of Stonegate when presenting "pro-forma" adjustments.


A key facet of Stonegate's business strategy has been to acquire mortgage originators
that were immediately accretive to earnings. Since mid-2012, Stonegate has closed four
acquisitions, which totaled approximately $11 million of combined upfront payments.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2280753-stonegate-mortgage-a-value-trap-with-dubious-adjusted-financials 8/22


On November 29, 2013, Stonegate closed the acquisition of Nationstar Mortgage's
(NYSE:NSM) wholesale and retail mortgage assets. Stonegate paid just $500,000 for the
assets. On the other side of the transaction was a specialty servicer that had rapidly
grown its origination capabilities in order to manufacture MSRs to offset the run-off of its
existing servicing portfolio. It is notable that NSM decided to sell this business "after we
started to see the environment change," implying it was unlikely to be a profitable
business. Stonegate management disclosed they had hired "88 mortgage advisors at the
end of April in our retail channel due to the acquisition." On its Q4'13 earnings call,
Stonegate management stated they "inherited 30 of their account executives and 3 of their
sales executives" on the wholesale side of the business. Based on management's
succinct public disclosures, in connection with the Nationstar acquisition, Stonegate added
a total of 121 employees.


We believe management has been extremely liberal in excluding expenses from the
Nationstar Mortgage acquisition. Management has "dutifully" highlighted, and excluded,
the expenses (comp and non-comp) tied to those 121 employees as "ramp-up" expenses
from its pro-forma adjusted earnings. On the first quarter conference call, management
stated that the ramp up expenses were specifically "salaries and guarantees" associated
with the Nationstar acquisition "as well as the expenses associated with the operation
resources and facilities." Incredibly, Stonegate has "pro-forma-ed" out $14.8 million of
"ramp-up" expenses from its adjusted earnings in the past two quarters. Based on
rudimentary math, this pro-forma expense would represent around $122,300 per person
over a four month period, or approximately $367,000 per employee on an annualized
basis. The $14.8 million of "ramp-up" expenses management has excluded appears even
more suspicious considering it represents in just four months nearly thirty times what
Stonegate paid for the entire acquisition. Looking at the "ramp-up" expenses from another
perspective also portrays how fishy the size of the exclusions appears. The $9.6 million of
ramp-up expense in the first quarter of 2014 represented a shocking 20% of non-interest
expense in the quarter. The impact of this exclusion alone was $0.37 per share, and
optically swung Stonegate from reporting a loss to reporting a positive EPS number. But
that obfuscates the most basic question of why exactly management is even excluding
recurring, purportedly strategic expenses in the first place. Despite specific SEC
guidelines, we were unable to find the mandatory details on the conference call or in SEC
filings to justify such an unreasonable add back. This questionable add back appears to
violate three issues the SEC has warned against: the obligation not to mislead investors,
the inadequate explanation of adjustments, and "tricky" assumptions used to turn GAAP
losses into pro forma profit.

2) Altering Adjusted Earnings Presentations/Definition


It is our opinion that Stonegate management has deceptively changed its definition of
adjusted earnings multiple times to disguise large earnings disappointments.
Camouflaged in the intricacies of gain on sale accounting, Stonegate management has
deftly (and perhaps not so legally) toggled its treatment of mortgage pipeline marks in
adjusted earnings tables - excluding marks when they detract from earnings, while
including marks when they represent a benefit. We have been unable to find another
company with a mortgage operation that has excluded, and then subsequently included
these adjustments. To-date we are unaware of any investors or sell-side analyst that has
caught management's chicanery.


In the screen shots below, taken directly from Stonegate earnings releases, we clearly
show how management has altered the treatment of its mortgage pipeline adjustments in
its adjusted earnings tables. The first screen shot below is the adjusted earnings
presentation from Stonegate's third quarter 2013 earnings press release issued November
14, 2013. This was the first time Stonegate changed the definition of adjusted earnings to
exclude "non-cash fair value adjustment for mortgage loans pipeline" from adjusted
earnings. This $7.577 million adjustment was a $0.43 benefit to earnings when compared
to the GAAP statements. Without this exclusion, Stonegate would have reported both an
Adjusted and GAAP loss per share. Management's definition change escaped scrutiny, as
not one sell-side analyst highlighted the definition change to exclusions (the first line of
Credit Suisse's earnings review note implied the quarter beat expectations: "Stonegate
reported adjusted EPS of $0.35, $0.03 ahead of our estimate").

Source - 11/14/13 earnings release


The following quarter (Q4'13), the "fair value adjustment for mortgage loans pipeline" was
a $6.1 million positive gain, which compared very favorably to the $7.577 million loss from
the third quarter (which as a reminder was excluded during Q3'13). With the positive gain
from Q4'13, Stonegate's management changed its definition of adjusted earnings again.
As can be seen in the screen shot directly below (from its Q4'13 earnings release on
2/24/14), Stonegate no longer excluded the impact from the fair value adjustment of its
mortgage pipeline. In fact, the previous quarter's $7.577 million exclusion was completely
absent from the Q3'13 column, despite it comprising more than 100% of adjusted net
income in the original Q3'13 earnings report. Under the new adjusted earnings definition,
Stonegate reported $0.11 adjusted EPS. While this was another earnings miss compared
to the $0.29 estimate, the company would have again lost money had the adjusted
earnings presentations remained consistent from Q3'13 to Q4'13. As can be seen in the
table below from Q4'13, there is no longer an exclusion applied to September 30, 2013
(Q3'13), or any quarter for that matter.


Source - 2/24/14 earnings release


To summarize management's deception, the adjusted earnings presentation screen shots
below compare Stonegate's treatment of the exact same quarter (September 30, 2013 or
"Q3'13") in its Q3'13 and Q4'13 earnings releases side-by-side. On the left is Stonegate's
treatment (exclusion) of the fair value adjustment of its mortgage pipeline from its Q3'13
earnings report (clearly excluding the $7.577 million loss when Q3'13 was reported). As a

result, Q3'13 "adjusted diluted EPS" was $0.35 per share, which Credit Suisse referenced
in its note cited above. Directly to the right is Stonegate's treatment of the exact same
Q3'13 quarter, several months later, from its Q4'13 earnings press release dated February
24, 2014 (as well as its pre-release on 1/13/14). The two tables display the exact same
quarter, but clearly reveal how management changed the definition of adjusted earnings.
The third quarter 2013 earnings, which originally showed adjusted earnings of $0.35 when
first reported, now shows $0.00 in order to overstate the current quarter reported (Q4'13)
with the altered definition. How different would Credit Suisse, other sell-side analysts, and
all investors have viewed Q3'13 if that less favorable definition had been applied?


Source - Left Table = Sept quarter from Q3'13 earnings release; Right Table = Sept
quarter from Q4'13 earnings release


It is our opinion that the changes unequivocally violate ALL FIVE issues about which the
SEC has warned reporting issuers: adjustments that make it difficult to compare financial
information with other reporting periods, adjustments that make it difficult to compare
financial information with other companies, the obligation not to mislead investors,
inadequate explanation of adjustments, and "tricky" assumptions used to turn GAAP
losses into pro forma profit.


Another Large Miss Coming - Assuming No Questionable Adjustments

5/19/2018 Stonegate Mortgage - A Value Trap With Dubious Adjusted Financials - Stonegate Mortgage Corporation (NYSE:SGM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2280753-stonegate-mortgage-a-value-trap-with-dubious-adjusted-financials 12/22


We are hopeful the recent replacement of Stonegate's CFO will result in less manipulation
of its "adjusted" earnings definition. A hopeful first step was taken on the Q1'14 earnings
call, when management committed to stop adding back questionable "ramp-up" expenses
going forward. As stated above, most of the "ramp-up" expenses related to compensation
for mortgage originators who have yet to produce significant revenue. As a result, these
expenses are not going away. Current estimates for the second quarter seem to assume
non-MSR mark revenue will be up significantly quarter-over-quarter, with only a minor
increase in expenses. This optimistic assumption makes it appear analysts may have
ignored (or failed to read) Stonegate's management comments in the 10Q that "variable
expense" will be up in the second quarter. If Stonegate does not change course, and
actually includes the ongoing expenses from Nationstar, expenses in the second quarter
should be up significantly. This leads us to believe Stonegate's streak of earnings
disappointment will continue.


If we make the generous assumptions that originations increase by 50% quarter-over-
quarter, GOS margins increase (despite reported pressure on margins), fee revenue
increases, and also assume only 90 basis points of incremental costs on the additional
$1.2 billion volume, we estimate Stonegate will still miss the Q2'14 sell-side estimate of
$0.30 by over 40%.

Our assumptions are on the generous side, as every $100 million of incremental retail
volumes should carry at least $1 million of incremental commissions alone. Origination
volumes industry-wide have also been surprisingly weak in the second quarter. For
example, Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage company in the U.S., who originates one out
of every five mortgages, recently expressed disappointment over second quarter volumes.
On May 28, 2014, Wells Fargo's CFO said that the second quarter residential mortgage
loan pipeline was "not as strong" as expected and volumes were "softer than what we
thought even a month, month-and-a-half ago." This weakness is also verified by the
weekly MBA application index. The MBA purchase application index has been down 16%
year-over-year in the second quarter, and is even running down 5% on average compared
to 2012 levels. Despite lower interest rates, the MBA refinance index is down 68% in
Q2'14 year-over-year. Management and its sell-side analysts are incentivized to
perpetually endorse out-period estimates that make the company appear cheaper than it
would be on more realistic estimates. This unbridled optimism can also be seen in the
steep ramp in 2H'14 and 2015 estimates that appear to have no support or justification
based on the existing trends of the business.


MSRs Potentially Attractive Asset, But Appear Aggressively Marked


Given historically low interest rates, the potential exists for mortgage servicing rights to
hold significant value if/when mortgage rates rise. We believe the value of MSRs can
offset some of the operational challenges Stonegate's mortgage origination segment
faces. Valuing an MSR requires a variety of assumptions, which can be seen in the
various approaches taken across the mortgage industry. Consistent with our belief
Stonegate management comes from a culture of aggressive accounting and loose
financial presentation, they appear to be marking their MSR at a significant premium to
other industry averages.
5/19/2018 Stonegate Mortgage - A Value Trap With Dubious Adjusted Financials - Stonegate Mortgage Corporation (NYSE:SGM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2280753-stonegate-mortgage-a-value-trap-with-dubious-adjusted-financials 14/22


At March 30, 2014, Stonegate management valued their MSR at 1.36% (fair value of the
MSR to unpaid principal balance of mortgages serviced). As can be seen in the table
above, Stonegate's MSR valuation is more than 32% higher than the average of ten
leading mortgage originators. We would guess management would argue the low interest
rate and low delinquency rate (as a newer book) supports a higher valuation. However, a
32% premium seems completely unjustifiable. As a result of the aggressive MSR mark,
Stonegate's book value appears overstated. For example, if Stonegate marked its MSR at
1.10% of UPB, which would still represent a reasonable premium to the average industry
mark, Stonegate's tangible book value would take an 8% hit to $10.40 per share.


Non-Cash Revenue and Earnings = Extremely Capital Intensive Business


One of the primary reasons Stonegate's MSR appears so aggressive is because of the
high capitalized servicing gains that get recognized as revenue and earnings when a
mortgage is originated. As can be seen in the table below, capitalized servicing rights
have accounted for more than 85% of revenue, and more than 100% of earnings over the
past three quarters. Despite representing GAAP revenue and earnings, these servicing
rights are non-cash and a significant source of capital intensity in Stonegate's business
model.


Stonegate's model can be confusing, which allows for disingenuous and liberal public
representations. On May 5, 2014 Stonegate's CEO stated his company was a "publicly
traded company with no debt." We find this comment highly misleading. The fact is
Stonegate operates in an extremely capital intensive business with a terribly strained cash
flow profile. As the table below illustrates, Stonegate has generated significantly negative
cash flow from operations in eight of the previous nine quarters, including nearly $200
million in its most recent quarter. Equally troubling, the negative cash flow from operations
is accelerating. At March 31, 2014, Stonegate was carrying over $750 million in debt
across its secured borrowings, repo and lines of credit facilities, up significantly from the
$66 million outstanding at the end of December 2011. To suggest Stonegate is debt free is
highly misleading.

A wholesale funded mortgage business is a fragile and risky model that depends on
constant access to third party repo and warehouse debt funding. Marginal changes in
confidence can result in rapid deterioration of business stability. A long memory is not
required to understand how precarious Stonegate's model can become with minor
changes in confidence. Countrywide Financial, previously the largest wholesale funded
mortgage company, nearly collapsed in 2008 when funding dried up. Bank of America
(NYSE:BAC) bailed out Countrywide when it agreed to acquire the company in a deal
many now consider the worst acquisition in U.S. banking history. PHH Corporation
(NYSE:PHH), one of the few remaining wholesale funded publicly traded companies,
nearly went bankrupt at the end of 2011 when it failed to close a debt financing (resulting
in an extremely dilutive convertible bond issue).


Because of the fragile nature of the business model, Stonegate's management must
always stay in the good graces of its partners. We believe this conflict could explain
management's questionable reporting tactics and upbeat/optimistic tone on earnings calls
and presentations. Maintaining the confidence of counterparties (and shareholders) is
paramount to Stonegate's business model, which depends on third party funding.


We believe Stonegate will exhaust the proceeds raised from its IPO in the next few
quarters, which seems likely to occur at the same time its lenders re-examine heightened
exposure to Stonegate. Therefore, they will need debt or equity financing to continue
originating mortgages. One alternative management may consider is selling MSRs in
order to raise capital. However, we find this unlikely because any sale could generate
material losses given the lofty valuation of the MSR. We believe the company could raise
debt backed by its MSRs, but creditors would be taking on high credit risk given the
fragility of Stonegate's business model. Stonegate's original plan consisted of accessing
the high yield debt markets, but it is unclear if this market is available at a reasonable cost

of capital. Should Stonegate complete an MSR financing, it will likely serve as nothing
more than an interim step before a more significant equity raise occurs. Either way, we
take issue with the spirit of Stonegate's assertion that it is debt free.


A perpetually unreasonable "E" distorts the "P/E"


Stonegate has appeared cheap on out-year estimates since it came public. As discussed
above, there are significant conflicts that lead to management and sell-side bankers
providing unreasonable outlooks. Despite estimates for 2014 and 2015 that have declined
by approximately 50% over the last six months, we believe estimates are still way too
high. Based on the overcapacity of the mortgage market, and gain on sale margins
remaining extremely compressed for the foreseeable future, we believe Stonegate may
struggle to earn $1.00 per share in 2015.


Stonegate is attempting to grow its higher margin retail origination business, which barely
represents 10% of originations. While this story may sound promising, retail originations
are very expensive, which can be seen in Stonegate's ballooning non-adjusted expenses
the past two quarters. HomeStreet (NASDAQ:HMST) is an example of a well-run
mortgage business that is nearly all retail. Despite its retail concentration, HomeStreet has
struggled to maintain profitability in its mortgage segment due to the current environment.
Stonegate's business plan was previously based on 20% of originations in retail, which
would require them to either acquire more originators or shrink other segments of the
business. Barring a massive acquisition, the majority of Stonegate's originations will come
from the correspondent business for the foreseeable future. This correspondent channel
remains hyper-competitive and will likely continue to struggle producing cash earnings.
For example, on May 20, 2014, Wells Fargo management disclosed they were backing
away from this segment as "other competitors [were] coming into the correspondence
space with profit margins or compliance criteria that just don't make sense."


These competitors in correspondent are relatively new to the channel and are forecasting
extremely low margins. For example, Walter Investment Management (WAC) guided
margins to just 10 to 20 basis points. On May 8, 2014 NSM's management said their
correspondent business was operating at "breakeven to slightly profitable" levels. Adding
to the competitive landscape in Stonegate's primary channel, Redwood Trust
(NYSE:RWT) has discussed its aspirations to grow in the correspondent channel.
Redwood's management is widely respected in the mortgage industry, and they have
guided to 25 basis points of gain on sale margin. For Stonegate, the best case scenario
appears to be just 20% of its originations come from retail. The non-retail business
representing the other 80% of originations should suffer from greater price competition. As

such, it is hard to understand how Stonegate can generate meaningful profitability. In an
apparent realization of the challenges Stonegate faces, Barclays (one of the biggest
bulls), recently cut their 2015 earnings estimate by 44% to $3.31 per share. Despite the
magnitude of the cut, the new estimate still appears to ignore gain on sale margin
pressure discussed above in the correspondent channel. The Barclays estimate assumes
gain on sale margins expand to 1.59% despite new competitors targeting margins 80%
lower.


Given the extremely high and unachievable estimates, it would appear investors have
been attracted to the seemingly low out-year P/E multiple. A recent Seeking Alpha article
noted the cheap P/E on the stock, arguing, "Stonegate should earn $1.85 this year, $3.20
next year, and $5.70 in 2015 … is massively undervalued. Probably at least 100%
undervalued, especially when you consider the multiple."


We respect this author's opinion, but this superficial view, namely Stonegate is cheap on
forward analyst estimates, appears to represent the pervasive bull case. Based on our
belief that 2015 estimates remain at least 67% too high (with serial estimate cuts to
come), Stonegate is the prototypical value trap.


Stonegate is Worth Less than $10 Per Share


As we stated above, we believe a price-to-earnings multiple approach to valuing
Stonegate has been highly misleading given unrealistic earnings expectations. When sell-
side analysts finally reduce their numbers to more reasonable expectations, we expect
Stonegate will still carry its low multiple, only with a much lower "E". Given the commodity-
like, low barrier to entry, highly cyclical and capital intensive nature of the business model,
wholesale funded mortgage companies have historically traded at very low multiples. For
example, according to Bloomberg, PHH has traded at a median P/E multiple of 7.9x on its
out-year earnings expectations over the last five years. Countrywide Financial also traded
at a median multiple of 7.9x its out-year earnings during its last 10 years as a public
company, while never trading for more than a month with a P/E multiple over 10x. If we
apply a generous 10x multiple to our Stonegate expectations, we arrive at an expected
stock price below $10.


With unreliable earnings estimates, a price-to-book approach to valuation is a more
reasonable methodology for valuing Stonegate. Flagstar (NYSE:FBC), PHH, Provident
(NASDAQ:PROV), and HomeStreet all have very large mortgage operations, more
conservative MSR marks, more realistic earnings expectations, yet all trade at, or below,
tangible book value. As a side note, trading at a discount to book value is justified

because the low mortgage origination return expectations will likely result in a failure to
earn the cost of capital. When Stonegate eventually trades at the same book value
multiple as its four closer comps, the stock should settle out just above $10 per share.
However, that still gives the company credit for its aggressively marked MSR. If we adjust
Stonegate's MSRs to a more reasonable industry premium of 1.10% and apply a peer
book value multiple, we arrive at a $9.50 per share target. Given its dismal execution as a
public company, terrible cash flow profile, potential violations of pro-forma reporting, and
pending equity raise, we see no reason Stonegate should trade in line with its peers.
Further, there is nothing in Stonegate's model to suggest it does not become a victim of
the mortgage shake-out. When all of these issues are considered, we would expect
Stonegate to trade well below $9.50 per share.

volatility around it as interest rates move around. Again is the author bringing us new information or just trying to poke
at the hornet nest?


And having executives from troubled organizations is silly. Saying you worked at Bank of America, CountryWide etc..
does not mean you are the reason for the company's failures. There are great people who came from troubled
institutions now working at other firms that are generating lots of wealth at their new companies. Again another silly
argument.


The origination market did change over the last 6 months and SGM management has taken massive market share in
a declining market. Is the author trying to tell us that he has insight into the origination market that is going to step
down to another lower level? That would be interesting to hear the argument. But everyone already knows that SGM's
estimates as well as other origination firms have come down. The question are we near a bottom in originations and
by selling today you are at or near the bottom. The author is clearly a momentum investor.


As SGMs startup costs normalize, the retail strategy continues to ramp (which drives higher recurring servicing and
higher gain on sale margins) the EPS will come through.


Sure the correspondent market is commoditized - again is the author selling his story to a child?


Managements plan (see the perspectus from the IPO) was always to issue debt in the future. Not equity. And this was
based on higher origination volumes. This debt offering has been pushed back because volumes are lower than
expected. So again what is new here.


Mortgage companies never trade at high multiples and SGM. Trades at 8.6x 2014 and if the ramp happens it trades at
only 4.8x 2015 estimates. This is really already built into the stock otherwise it would be trading at a higher multiple on
2015's estimates.


Hope you covered you're short and maybe the SEC should look into your tactics.

"MSR mark is meaningless as the coupon rate on their portfolio is much lower than their peers.." Which means they
are selling the loans at a lower px (getting less) than their competitors on the front end. No matter how you squeeze

Author’s reply »  JSSSSB -


Thanks for reading our work and for your comments / questions (even if we disagree). A few specific responses:


**Questionable adjustments: generally we do not take issue with management providing pro-forma adjustments for
costs that are reasonable and non-recurring. As we illustrated above, the size of SGM's adjustments appear neither
reasonable nor non-recurring. These adjustments are unaudited and thus require the trust of management (which
relates back to management's history). Bronte (the financial blog written by John Hempton) recently described "one-
off charges" that are not really "one-off" as making "non-GAAP" earnings (presented net of these charges) "a fraud on
the gullible." We find nothing justifiable in excluding items when they detract from earnings, and then changing the
definition of adjusted earnings to include these items when they represent a benefit. MANAGEMENT HAS CLEARLY
CHANGED ITS PRO FORMA TREATMENT OF ITS FAIR VALUE MARK ON ITS MORTGAGE PIPELINE - WITH
THE TREATMENT VARYING BASED UPON WHETHER THE MARK WAS A GAIN OR LOSS.


**MSR valuation: PHH discloses a 4.0% coupon on their servicing book that is marked at 0.96% on their balance
sheet versus SGM at 3.92% coupon that is marked 42% higher at 1.36%. That is a large gap for the relatively minor
difference in mortgage rates between the two servicing portfolios. We haven't been able to find a company that
capitalizes their MSR on new originations (so through the income statement) as aggressively as SGM. Further,
Rorman makes a thoughtful point above regarding the lack of the economic impact between coupon/MSR mark
variances.


**Management: We made it clear that it was a difficult environment for most mortgage executives during the housing
crisis. We explicitly state as much. Also, our comment that Stonegate's executives seem to have had either really bad
luck is also fair (we are not arguing anything more insidious than bad luck at firms that were on the notoriety
extremes). Given the history of past failures (at the associated employers), we do find it somewhat curious that
investors have trusted them blindly with hundreds of millions of dollars of equity capital.


**correspondent business: you appear to agree that the "correspondent market is commoditized" and we would guess
you agree that it is fiercely competitive (with many participants targeting little or no margin). It becomes difficult to
reconcile future earnings expectations given the business mix that will continue to be a majority correspondent. It is
easy to gain market share in the correspondent channel (through price) or through acquisitions... but more difficult to
do it profitably.


**retail: Given their disclosed productivity measures, they will have to acquire or hire significantly to ramp this
segment's originations, which will likely be very expensive (and unprofitable).


**funding: we have yet to see a clearly expressed plan to fund their business. A bullish sellside analyst is modeling
the balance sheet to grow to nearly $3.2 billion in 2016, which may prove low given the capital intensity of their
business. This would require $2.3 to $2.4 billion of debt assuming the equity base grows inline with our expectations.
We find that level of debt funding (7x debt/equity) unlikely and thus would require significant new equity capital.

**P/E multiple: As mentioned in our article, we would agree that mortgage originators warrant very low multiples. We
have no issue there - the issue is on the denominator, which we believe will be closer to $1.00 in 2015 - which means
using your single digit multiple, then there is substantial downside to the "P" if we are right on the "E"...

Hi Forensic,


Thanks for the thoughtful article. The quality of earning is certainly weak, and I think the company would be a
borderline investment even without any intention to deceive.


The debate about MSR valuation is of minor importance here (as your thesis seem to center more around weak
earnings). That said, SGM would probably argue that book value across the industry dramatically understate market
value. These things usually trade at multiples to servicing fees, and in the 1Q14 call SGM referenced Ocwen's OASIS
deal to justify higher marks ..


" when you look at the market right now for servicing, below servicing, you look at the IO deal that Ocwen just did and
your like wow! If we can get a five multiple on a 445 WAC, you know we have 374 WAC in our servicing portfolio, you
know what could we monetize that at?


To be clear, I'm not sure this IO deal would be comparable to an MSR sell b/c the buyer of that IO doesnt have to
worry about cost of servicing, but the buyer of an MSR would have to. It'd be an interesting question to raise if you're
talking to management.

Your projection of less then $10 seems to have been correct. As of close of business today it's at $9.61. With the
recent news about SGM hiring 175 people in the near future for their OC office I'm wondering how much lower it will
need to drop before those inbound people start getting shown the door. And will there be another player that steps in
since they seemed poised for a buyout/takeover....?
