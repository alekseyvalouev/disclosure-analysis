Samsung addresses OLED while Canaccord finds
Universal Display’s Samsung claim
“unbelievable.”


Posted on December 2, 2013 by asensio.com


Monday, December 02, 2013.  This morning Canaccord issues a
research report on Universal Display Corpora�on (“UDC:”
NASDAQ: OLED) addressing the SEC’s inquiry into UDC’s
accoun�ng of its Samsung contract revenue.  The report finds
UDC’s representa�ons to investors “that Samsung is stuck” with
in its supply and patent licensing contract unbelievable and
inconclusive.  UDC has claimed that Ar�cle 4.2 of its contract with
Samsung prevents it from termina�ng its agreement as a result of
the invalida�on of its all its claims contained in its only patent
family known to relate to the use of organometallics in an OLED.


Irrespec�ve of a near term, if not automa�c, termina�on by
Samsung, Canaccard found that UDC’s “fundamental longer term
story is broken.”  Canaccord determined that the EPO’s
invalida�on of UDC’s EPO 238 “will [irrespec�ve of a Samsung
termina�on] limit the ability of UDC to sign favorable commercial
agreements.”  In any regard, Canaccard’s investment research
report notes the an�cipated “dras�c reduc�on in [UDC’s]earnings
power post-2017.”


Meanwhile, Dr. Kinam Kim, Chief Execu�ve Officer of Samsung
Display gave a presenta�on earlier this morning at the Nomura
Investment Forum in Tokyo, Japan.


Dr. Kim shed light on UDC’s mysterious repor�ng of an irregular
increase in sales of green materials to Samsung, which was not
an�cipated by UDC’s analysts and will cut into any obliga�on
Samsung had to UDC.

Dr. Kim’s presenta�on makes UDC’s irrelevance to its OLED
business and success abundantly clear.  Dr. Kim focused on
Samsung Display having the “world’s largest patent por�olio in
AMOLED and flexible displays” and the fact that this OLED patent
por�olio is rapidly increasing.  Dr. Kim pointed to the fact that
Samsung “owns over 9,000 [OLED} patents” and has drama�cally
increased this number in the past 7 years. Meanwhile, UDC relies
on work done by others in college labs for the government in the
1990s that has been found as a ma�er of fact and law not meet
the most primary standards of an inven�on. 


Of equal to if not greater importance to UDC shareholders,  Dr.
Kim focused on Samsung’s self-reliance and focus on cu�ng cost.


Specially, Dr. Kim stated that Samsung developed its RGB
technology by itself and focused on its investment in internal R&D
infrastructure.
