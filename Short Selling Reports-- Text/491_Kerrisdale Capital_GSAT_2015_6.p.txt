Globalstar: LightSquared Filing Reinforces Worthlessness Of GSAT's
1.6GHz Band

Summary


Moelis assigns no value to the uplink band closest to GPS frequencies.


Since Globalstar’s 1.6GHz spectrum is even closer to GPS than LightSquared’s, its
worthlessness for terrestrial purposes is all the more assured.


Nothing has altered the reality that TLPS is an overhyped non-solution to a non-
problem – a conclusion increasingly endorsed by Wi-Fi industry observers.


Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) shareholders, desperate for validation, have recently seized
upon an unlikely source: the latest disclosure statement in the LightSquared bankrupty
case. Like Globalstar, LightSquared sought to repurpose its satellite-based spectrum
rights for terrestrial use, only to fail disastrously as a result of business-model
shortcomings and, most prominently, serious concerns about GPS interference. Still stuck
in bankruptcy court and mired in complex legal and regulatory disputes, the company has
not made any progress toward overcoming its interference challenges. Indeed, concerns
about its uplink spectrum have only grown, as illustrated by a July letter from the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, the federal agency tasked with
managing government spectrum use and advising the president on telecom policy.
Nonetheless, Globalstar cheerleaders became excited to learn that the investment bank
Moelis, acting on behalf of the bankrupt LightSquared and drawing in large part on the
results of the ongoing AWS-3 auction, had revised up its valuation of LightSquared's
spectrum assets. Since Globalstar's 1.6GHz MSS band is close to some of LightSquared's
uplink spectrum, then surely Globalstar should be worth more too!


Not so fast. Set aside the fact that Moelis's valuation is just one party's opinion and that
LightSquared's bankruptcy still hasn't been resolved. What's notable is that Moelis
effectively concedes that the uplink band closest to GPS frequencies is worthless. Since
Globalstar's 1.6GHz spectrum is even closer to GPS than LightSquared's, its
worthlessness for terrestrial purposes is all the more assured.

This conclusion is clear but requires some background. Moelis discusses two valuation
approaches: "the Current Spectrum Approach," which takes LightSquared "as is," and the
"Alternative Spectrum Use Approach." Under the as-is valuation, with LightSquared's
terrestrial rights still in limbo, all of the company's spectrum constitutes at best a deeply
out-of-the-money option. But under the alternative approach, which Moelis regards as
twice as valuable (based on the AWS-3 auction), LightSquared would reorganize its
spectrum holdings as follows:


A 5x5MHz paired block at 1632.5-1637.5 / 1670-1675 MHz
A 10MHz unpaired block at 1646.7-1656.7 MHz


But what about the rest of LightSquared's spectrum? In the words of the disclosure
statement, "The Alternative Spectrum Use Approach valuation analysis ascribes no
value to the 1526 - 1536 MHz, 1545.2 - 1555.2 MHz, and 1627.5 - 1632.5 MHz U.S.
spectrum" (emphasis added). Why not? What unites these spectrum blocks is their
proximity to the RNSS (radionavigation satellite systems) band that includes GPS.
Unfortunately for Globalstar bulls, these value-less blocks, under Moelis's analysis,
include the lower half of one of LightSquared's uplink band. As the diagram below
illustrates, Globalstar's MSS uplink band is substantially closer to the GNSS band than
this LightSquared uplink band. If Moelis "ascribes no value" to LightSquared's holdings
under its latest analysis, then surely any reasonable observer would draw the same
conclusion about Globalstar: for terrestrial use, its 1.6GHz spectrum has no value.

Comments (23)


Thus Moelis's LightSquared analysis actually supports the consensus view, which we
share, that Globalstar's 1.6GHz MSS band is unfit for terrestrial purposes. Worse yet, the
FCC is still considering Iridium's proposal for a reallocation of MSS spectrum that would
result in Iridium gaining some and Globalstar losing some. If the FCC accepts this
proposal (as it has in the past with similar Iridium proposals), then Globalstar will be in an
even worse position to monetize its spectrum. This is no long shot: Globalstar's creditors
are concerned enough about the risk that Globalstar loses spectrum to have publicly
expressed their worries on multiple occasions, as recently as late November.


To be sure, these considerations apply only to Globalstar's 1.6GHz spectrum, not the
2.4GHz spectrum that would be used by TLPS. Nothing has altered the reality that TLPS
is an overhyped non-solution to a non-problem - a conclusion increasingly endorsed by
Wi-Fi industry observers. If Globalstar shareholders now think that developments in the
LightSquared bankruptcy will bail them out, they are in for a rude awakening. Instead, they
would do well to study LightSquared's history and remind themselves how frequently
others' spectrum dreams have been dashed by regulatory uncertainty and bad business
plans.

Nice timing. Have to publish this the day after you get called out on microcap daily. I'll just leave this quote here:


"GSAT has been one volatile stock over the past few months due to heavy manipulation by Kerrisdale Capital and Jim
Cramer. Kerrisdale short campaign seems to be heading for epic failure which seems justified considering their hugely
aggressive way over the top smear campaign."

Kerrisdale Capital Closing Up Shop ???


Certain New York office space is available for rent starting in May 2015 on the same floor, in the same
building, as Kerrisdale currently operates. The property began listing last week. This has left many wondering
if Kerrisdale is going to go bankrupt soon, when it's short position collapses. Sahm Adrangi has connections
outside the continental United States and has announced travel plans starting in the Cayman Islands in
February. Shorts should be very VERY careful not to fall into the mistake Sahm Adrangi seems to have made
trying on the copycat activitist route. Adrangi has lost his edge, he used to be pretty good when he was
attacking companies in China, IMO. Now Sahm seems to be lost in his own fiction, and I suspect he's really in
it deep this time.

Kerrisdale, you cannot be serious. Your assumptions are disingenuous because they lack technical depth. Just
throwing a few charts and made-up numbers here and there will not grant your work any merit. Kerrisdale, now on

Kerrisdale, people don't plan to fail, they usually fail to plan. As your smear campaign fails and your GSAT short

The issues you raise concerning Globalstar's 1.6GHz MSS band were addressed last August by Globalstar's CEO
Jay Monroe. Per Nish.jjj on the GSAT message board:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2815225-globalstar-lightsquared-filing-reinforces-worthlessness-of-gsats-1_6ghz-band 5/8


"So, for clarity, first, we do not believe there are any impediments to Globalstar’s use, on an uplink band basis, for our
L band spectrum. It is not, in any way, consistent with the plans for similar spectrum that were developed by
LightSquared. It’s the polar opposite of that.


There are, always, some questions that have to be answered, but you may or may not recall that many years ago we
went through these very questions with the FCC, when we were going to use it for uplink. And they established very
strict out of band emissions limits, and because of the low power uplink and the out of band emissions limits, it was
still terrific spectrum for someone to use as uplink.


So that is definitely our position in terms of the technology. We’ve spent a good bit of time with the GPS industry to
make sure that they understood that, and they do, and time will tell how that plays out. But, on the issue of timing, it is
also our position that we don’t want to do anything with the spectrum until TLPS is certified and done, nor do we really
want to do anything with the spectrum until LightSquared plays itself out and that issue is off the table, because to be
associated with that is not a good thing for us.


So it’s an important asset. It’s an asset that will mean a lot to some company that needs uplink spectrum, but it is not
anything that we intend to focus on until after the FCC and after LightSquared is done."


Your smear campaign isn't working.

Author’s reply »  Monroe's comments may have "addressed" these issues in the sense of referring to them,
but they did nothing to resolve them. As usual, Globalstar is engaging in ludicrous wishful thinking. It's absurd
to think that the LightSquared debacle of 2011-12, in which the GPS industry, Department of
Transportation/Federal Aviation Administration, and Department of Defense, among others, strongly fended
off LightSquared's efforts to deploy cellular service, would have no effect on the permissions Globalstar
managed to obtain in the early 2000s for its failed ATC system with Open Range. (The FAA even said in 2011
that up to 800 people would die if LightSquared were permitted to move forward at the risk of interfering with
the GPS systems in aircraft.) The GPS industry, federal government, and other interested parties will have the
LightSquared experience very much in mind if Globalstar ever tries for terrestrial authority in the L Band
again. And the fact the the Dept. of Transportation and NTIA have continued to express their profound
concerns over LightSquared's potential terrestrial use of its satellite uplink bands -- let alone Globalstar's,
which are so much closer to the navigation band -- shows clearly that Globalstar has its head in the sand.
Terrestrial use of its uplink band is not going to happen.

Kerrisdale, sometimes you have to admit mea culpa to your followers and move on. Your thesis is flawed and
will not deter the advancement of TLPS which will only benefit the global internet consumer. Your negativity
towards Globalstar's initiative is preposterous and in my view, only hides a dark motif which is to profit from an
unscrupulous short position and/or protect potential competitors.

Same old Kerrisdale, negativity. The only important part of this article is the statement that 2.4 GHZ spectrum is NOT
the same as 1.6GHZ spectrum. This one statement makes the rest of the article meaningless.

Well, the market has spoken. After regurgitating your worn thesis Gsat is up 1.5% on the day.

I'm not a techie to comment on this latest thesis. I will offer/ask this: What about the notion that if spectrum is being
used for TLPS then satellite phones in those areas will not work? And I'm curious if anyone can speculate or answer
why jay is not on the Satellite 2015 panel, "the CEO's Speak Out'. The panel is only Rupert Pierce from Inmarsat,
Matt Desch from Iridium and Samer Halawi from Thuraya. Unless they have not updated he website. If Jay is absent,
that says more to me than all of this conjecture/theories/hy... over TLPS.

TLPS has NOTHING to do with GSAT's sat phones.


14 Jan 2015, 09:58 PM


Laltrman
Um.... if your spectrum is carrying Wi-Fi how can it also carry a satellite phone call? This is the same
argument that Iridium is pressing with the FCC in their debate with GSAT over disputed spectrum. How could
you possibly operate a TLPS service and not interfere with MSS services?

The theory is that Globalstar's satellite business targets offshore, remote areas, etc. TLPS on the other hand,
will target "normal" areas that already have wireline and wireless coverage (e.g. the entire continental U.S.).


It's unlikely someone will need to use a satellite phone in Manhattan.


On the other hand, it's unlikely someone will need TLPS at all.


A bad solution to a problem that doesn't exist wrapped in an ugly balance sheet.


All IMHO.


19 Jan 2015, 12:18 PM


dataspectrum
So you highlight the "uplink" spectrum which doesn't interfere with GPS (Lightsquared problems are in the downlink).
TLPS is for the Downlink spectrum in the 2.4 ghz band next to WIFI but you know that don't you.


At best this article is completely wrong and ignorant. Unfortunately, it would be hard to miss this badly so I'm going to
go out on a limb and suggest it is willful, deliberate misinformation. Proceed with caution

Globalstar sails as Kerrisdale exits short options 
Feb 17 2015, 17:13 ET | By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor Contact this editor with comments or a news tip 
Globalstar (NYSEMKT:GSAT) gained 6.3% today (and is on the move after hours, +2%).Hedge fund Kerrisdale
Advisers filed a 13F indicating it closed out its bearish position, $7.3M in put options, as of Dec. 31.Kerrisdale's Sahm
Adrangi famously knocked Globalstar shares for a loop in early October by pricing the firm's equity at $0: "Globalstar's
equity is worthless. It is not worth $4 billion, or $3 billion, or $1 billion. It is worth nothing."Shares had risen 58% in the
52 weeks prior to Adrangi's take; they slipped some 25% in the wake of rumors that he had gone short.

Gsat is going to use devices like ordinary everyday cell phones and install new software on them. this will allow the
radio to communicate with globalstar satellites.. that saves the need for manufacturing more electronic waste..
