Aquinox Pharmaceuticals: Low Float Insanity Meets Biotech Bubble
Aug. 10, 2015 6:11 PM ET15 comments
by: The Emperor Has No Clothes


Summary


AQXP's stock explodes higher on enormous volume (10x float) on marginally
positive news. Fundamentals are poorer than a few months ago yet the stock price
is up over 1,500%.


Baker Bros tightened the float even further squeezing the stock - stock has 75%
downside given its cost base. Expect a dilutive stock offering soon.


Most high volume traded stocks with low floats end up down 58% post breakouts in
stock price.


Competition is fierce in the space, and Allergan chose to buy TARIS as opposed to a
cheaper Aquinox.


CEO David Main's prior biotech stock performed poorly nearly wiping shareholders
out. David main has cut his position down by more than half since the stock became
publicly traded in.


Introduction | Caveat Emptor


Aquinox Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AQXP) stock price has increased 30 times over the
last two trading days to intraday highs of $55.75 (compared to Thursday's $1.79 closing
price to put this in perspective), this is even 5 times its all-time highs despite the fact that it
just missed its primary end point for AQX-1125 bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis
(BPS/IC). Comparing this to a few months ago and it's easy to see that fundamentals have
deteriorated with only two of its three indications surviving. The Baker Bros, well-known
biotech investors, recently beefed up its position at a cost basis of $6.98 per share - it is
up four times on its investment in 2 days, would it be buying more here? Cowen's latest
$14 target price from this morning, even with massively bullish assumptions, implies 50%
downside to recent price.


Aquinox is likely to follow the path of its predecessors whereby all of our selected
examples of one-time high volume traded stocks with low floats end up down 58% (on
average) post large outbursts in appreciation. As will be outlined later in the report,
Allergan (NYSE:AGN) had the opportunity to purchase this business at a $27 million

enterprise value but instead went with TARIS for a $67.5 million price (The Baker Bros
have picked up its stake in AQXP at a $53 million valuation as a reference point). With
AQXP currently trading at a $400 million plus enterprise value, the stock is ready to come
back down. Incremental financing needed for a likely phase 3 trial will be a catalyst as well
as no results from any further studies on BPS/IC in the next twelve months.


The secondary endpoint news that has driven the stock price is important; however, it is
incrementally positive, not a revolutionary change to the business or potential for the drug.
The BPS/IC indication remains to have significant risks: regulatory, commercialization,
partnership, financial and trial.


Irrational Exuberance Meets Thinly Traded Stock With Fundamentals That Have
Deteriorated In The Past Few Months


Aquinox exploded onto the stock trader's scene on Friday, August 7, 2015. According to
Bloomberg, AQXP had the largest increase in price for the day along with the 3rd highest
volume of any stock trading over 1 cent. Since August 7th, it traded 4 times as many
shares as had been cumulatively traded in the entire history of the company's stock,
resulting in the stock trading up over 1,500% to current. The stock currently trades at
101% above previous all-time highs of $14 per share. This astounding increase in volume
would lead to the natural conclusion that some truly transformative event had completely
changed the company's dynamics. That conclusion would be wrong.


Prior to the magical trading on Friday and Monday, Aquinox had been a sleepy little stock
in a company going about its research with little interest from traders. It completed its IPO
in March of 2014 on the basis of its drug AQX-1125 and its two ongoing phase II clinical
trials. The company hoped to develop treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and BPS/IC. The pipeline was even expanded in late 2014, with another
phase II program, which targeted atopic dermatitis (AD). All of these treatments depend
on AQX-1125's ability to redirect signaling in immune cells to reduce their activation and
migration and thus reduce inflammation.


At the beginning of June 2015, the company was trading around $8 per share and looking
forward to the release of results of its first two Phase II studies in the next couple of
months. The company had three analysts following it with price targets ranging from $13-
18. Irrespective of analyst support and guidance to 62-125% potential returns based on
target prices, the stock garnered little excitement with investors as illustrated by the
mediocre average of 32 thousand shares trading hands each day. All was quiet until June
25, 2015, when top-line results from the BPS/IC Phase II study was released. The results

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 3/18


were notably mixed. The study showed benefit from the treatment, but failed to meet
statistical significance for its primary endpoint. Aquinox CEO David Main summed up the
study by saying:


"While we did not meet our statistical endpoint, we are encouraged to see in our first
BPS/IC trial a positive trend in reduction of pain with AQX-1125 compared to
placebo….We believe today's top line data supports further development of AQX-
1125 for BPS/IC patients".


This was Aquinox's first indication of foreshadowing a pivot to highlighting the importance
of BPS/IC indication. I highlight that on June 25, 2015, Canaccord Genuity analyst stated
the following "AQX-1125's Phase 2 LEADERSHIP trial in BPS/IC missed its primary
endpoint. That's never good and the trial is clearly a failure".


So while not a complete failure, Aquinox felt the drug showed enough promise to justify
future trials and would go on to examine data for secondary endpoints. Investors showed
a little disappointment with the stock trading down 8% (it is noted that an 8% drop was
reasonable given the BPS indication was not the indication individuals were focused on -
this event caused a limited change in ownership with 174 thousand shares trading hands.
Analyst reactions echoed the stock price move with limited concern over the technical
failure of the trial. Price targets were slightly reduced to $10-16 per share, but there were
no downgrades by research analysts. As one analyst concluded "the development of
BPS/IC drug may be more complicated, but not necessarily higher risk".


Only a short time later on July 9, 2015, Aquinox released top-line results from its second
phase II study. Unlike the previous trial results, the conclusion was unmistakable. The
COPD trial was a complete failure as ABX-1125 showed no efficacy. The company
announced it would discontinue its development of the treatment and focus on its more
recent technical failure with BPS/IC. On the associated conference call regarding the
COPD trial, management went on to further explain that "At this time, we think that the
better uses of our resources and energies are on the Bladder Pain Syndrome/Interstitial
Cystitis". Analysts' sentiment finally rolled over as they cut target prices to $2-3 per share
whilst downgrading the stock. Investors followed suit by trading 2.6 million shares (81
times normal volume) as the share price dropped 67%.


A month later, on August 6, 2015, Aquinox followed up on its BPS/IC program with the
release of results of secondary endpoints. Most of the secondary endpoints showed ABX-
1124 as statistically significant over placebo. Aquinox CEO David Main explained:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 4/18


"Consistently positive results from multiple secondary endpoints have strengthened
our confidence in further development of AQX-1125 for BPS/IC…We believe the
next steps for AQX-1125 in BPS/IC include finalizing our pivotal trial designs in
consultation with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA,
to set a path to potential approval".


While the secondary endpoints did not change the fact the Phase 2 had technically failed
as previously press released, it gave some support to the company's decision to move on
to a phase 3 trial anyway.


The Real Reason For Aquinox's Historic Run | Low Float With High Volume Stocks


Even though, the initial price jump was in reaction to secondary endpoints and not a
successful trial. And even though the company was just continuing on with it previously
stated plan to proceed to further trials. And even though, the review of secondary
endpoints had been well telegraphed since Jun 25, 2015, "Secondary endpoints are
currently being analyzed and will be reported at a future meeting". And even though
COPD had previously made up the bulk of Aquinox's value, AQXP's stock held its opening
gap and began to run even more.


By the end of the day (on August 7), the price closed at $10.42 and had traded 62.3
million shares. With a float of only 5.7 million shares, the publicly traded shares had a
chance to completely change ownership over 10 times.


A quick look at social media provides a glimpse as to where some of the buying came
from. From Twitter, we can see comments such as Propshop73 saying "everyone alerted
$AQXP in chat at 2.15" and Zero Sum Trading commenting "$AQXP $2.2 alert pre-
market/previous night's video watchlist. Non-subs having nightmares, what will you miss
next?" And from Facebook, we can see Timothy Sykes posting "So $AQXP has now
spiked from the $2s to $9+ today, my chatroom NAILED the buy all morning long and
students have made over $400,000 in 3 hours". In message board InvestorsHub, [SMART
MONEY] exclaimed: "THIS IS TRADING LIKE SOMEBODY HAS THE FLOAT LOCKED
TIGHT". Trademon even asked, "Is this thing gonna pull a V£TC [VLTC] or what?"
(Appendix G illustrates promoters getting involved in the hype).


But that was just the start. This morning, a well-known biotech investor, the Baker Bros,
filed a 39.8% position in the stock - on Friday, it purchased 2.5 million shares at an
average of $6.98 per share (a 75% discount to current; various purchases have been
made as low as $1.97 and as high as $10.75 per share). This appears to have been the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 5/18


final straw for this low float stock. With an even tighter float the stock price traded as high
as $55.75 a share. The stock has traded 13.6 million shares today and currently trades at
$28.13. However, the float size has been significantly reduced after the Baker Bros Friday
purchases. With a new float of roughly 3.2 million shares, today's trading implies almost
two times the float and counting has traded.


The stock has been in its own world today trading up to $18 per share pre-market with
multiple volatility halts. By 10am the stock had hit $55.75 before regressing back to high
$20s currently. Short-term moves and commentary aside, the stock has left all
fundamentals behind. The company still has to proceed forward with its phase 3 trial and
prove out a similar primary endpoint to the one it just missed statistical meaningfulness
on.


Baker Bros is a legitimate long-term investor. It is clear it saw value in the stock at the
prices it paid. But it wasn't the one driving the price 5 times higher to 55. That magnificent
move is brought to us by short-term traders who don't really care about the underlying
business. Low float stocks can amplify even the smallest results with massive increases in
share appreciation as day traders and the like pile in. As we have seen recently, a huge
price surge in a low float stock is often a game of musical chairs by day traders. Everyone
wants to play, but not everyone can get out when the music stops. And we have seen
what happens when the music stops in stocks in various stocks including the following
(refer to Appendix H for charts on selected stocks):


From the table above, notice that AQXP's appreciation is higher than any other stock. I
believe this implies the stock has lots of room to fall.


Potential Catalyst | A Likely Financing In The Works

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 6/18


And it is not just traders who are going to be looking for an opportunity to sell. From the
very same press release that announced the positive results on secondary endpoints,
Aquinox stated "Aquinox expects its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to
be sufficient to continue operations and fund currently planned activities through the
second quarter of 2016". There is no chance Aquinox can complete any drug programs in
only 9 more months (the phase II studies took two years). Bottom line is that if Aquinox
wants to continue as a company and even attempt to get its trials through to completion, it
will need to raise more cash.


Funny thing is, like the secondary endpoint justification, the company has also clearly
telegraphed its intention to raise additional funds. On April, 1, 2015, Aquinox filed a shelf
registration to sell $150 million of stock. The SEC ruled the S-3 effective on April 9, 2015,
but so far there has been no announcement of any stock sales. And that is
understandable, as it is hard to sell $150 million of stock when only around $300,000 of
stock trades per day. It is no coincidence that the $150 million shelf was set up months
before trial results on two of AQXP's three main indications - what I am suggesting is that
management knew that the trial results, one way or another, would generate the additional
trading volume that was needed to complete such stock sales from this shelf. And while it
may have been disappointed with the results of releasing its top-line data in June and July,
it could not have hoped for better volume than what secondary endpoints produced in
August. Just as low float and short-term traders can do wonders for a stock on the upside,
dilution and short-term traders can be just as dramatic on the downside. And dilution is
coming, but at what levels?


AQXP's Formidable Competition | Allergan Picks up a BPS/IC Asset - Not Aquinox


AQXP is up against formidable competition which includes the likes of Allergan and TARIS
Holdings LLC, Theracoat Coatings, Allergan chose partner TARIS to take out which is also
in phase 2 trials for the treatment of BPS/IC. Allergan has invested or committed to invest
up to $588 million ($67.5 million upfront cash, up to $295 million in development milestone
payments, up to $225 million in commercial milestone payments). AGN's upfront payment
alone matches the R&D that AQXP has spent on R&D from its inception until Q2 2015 in
the amount of $67.6M. In August 2014, Allergan chose TARIS which bodes poorly for
AQXP shareholders (Refer to Appendix C for calculation of AQXP's enterprise value at the
time). A very simple question, why would Allergan pay $67.5 million upfront for TARIS
when it could pick up Aquinox for $27 million? Fast forward to today, and one can surmise
that if Allergan was not willing to buy AQXP for $27 million, then it would be even less

likely to purchase the stock today with the current market capitalization over $300 million
(Refer to Appendix B for calculation for current enterprise value). Refer to Appendix D for
additional information on competitors.


It is noteworthy that the last oral therapy approved by the FDA was Elmiron in 1996.
Elmiron has $279 million of annual sales (source) which indicates that any winners from
the above indications, whether Allergan or AQXP, will fight with an old dog that owns the
market for oral therapies in the space. With Elmiron's $279 million in current revenue,
does this imply that even with a 50% market share that Aquinox's sales potential is a
fraction of what research analysts are using to justify its current $2-3 per share valuation.


Outside of competitive risks, Aquinox faces many other potential headwinds.


Key Outstanding Risks Relating To Potential Launch Of BPS/IC Indication


Aquinox faces various challenges in achieving success with its BPS/IC Indication:


1. Regulatory risk - faces the challenge of designing a registrational trial for approval of
the indication


2. Commercialization risk - will need to be able to bring the product to market at profitable
levels


3. Partnership risk - will need a partner to commercialize the product and market it with
clinicians


4. Financing risk - unlikely to have sufficient cash given high probability of moving
forward with the phase 3 study


5. Trial duration risk - the phase 2 trial for BPS/IC was a short six weeks which compares
to a twelve-week trial for the one player in the game Elmiron. The impact of this is that
the confidence on both primary and secondary indications is less meaningful


What Could BPS/IC Indication Valuations Be?


Provided the failure of its COPD indication and with a bulk of the company's valuation
being derived from this indication, it appears that value has been eroded, despite the
recent trading. Baker Bros has picked up stock at $6.98 averages (an 75% discount to
current). With Cowen's update this morning, the stock has 50% downside to these levels.


Cowen: On July 10, 2015, the Cowen and Company research report notes "AQXP will no
longer pursue COPD, now focusing development efforts on BPS/IC", and as a result of the
loss of this key indication, the target price was dropped by $16.44 to $3.00 implying the
value of the COPD trial maintained the bulk of Aquinox's value. According to Cowen "We
are lowering our target to $3 after removing COPD from our pNPV based price target" - it

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 8/18


is implied that the COPD trial made up $13.44 of AQXP's valuation (or 82% of the
valuation). Cowen's base case assumptions already assumed positive endpoint data
"AQX-1125 shows improvements versus placebo in LEADERSHIP Phase 2 BPS/IC
secondary endpoint and other data" and quite a few ifs: "AQX-1125 is able to reach 50%
penetration rates for BPS/IC" "AQX-1125 has a good side effect profile", a 2019 product
launch with $1.3 billion of sales and a royalty model attributing 20% economics to AQXP.


If I take the June 25, 2015, Cowen report, eliminate the COPD indication which has failed
and provide a 100% probability of success to the BPS/IC indication (up from its assumed
15%), I get a $9.67 target share price on this indication. We all know research analysts
are usually more generous than not. Fast forward to this morning and all of a sudden AD
has $2.81 of value which was not previously included in Ritu Baral's model - I have no
idea where this magically appeared from. There has been no new public information on
this indication. Also, with a lower noted peak sales and a similar 2019 launch, somehow
with a 40% chance of success, the BPS/IC indication is now worth $10.83 - my
assumption is that the main difference is the discount factor that Ritu is using. She has
probably just de-risked the indication, although based on the last section, it's easy to
determine that the drug potential still has significant risk.


The Cowen analyst has now assumed like I have that this drug will move on to phase 3
trials; however, this will be no piece of cake given it will try to prove the same primary
endpoints. Despite all this, Cowen's shiny new target price of $14 per share from today
has an 50% downside from here.


Jefferies: Like Cowen on July 10, 2015, Jefferies reduced its price target from $13 to $2
as a result of the COPD indication failure. Once again, this implies a value of $11 per
share for the COPD trial making up 85% of Aquinox's valuation. Jefferies' outlook on
potential sales is a fraction of that of Cowen's, "We are removing the revenues of AQX-
1125 in COPD and now currently expect a peak risk-adjusted revenue of $226M (v. prev
$393M) in 2028 for AQX-1125" although it still expects $808 million in sales on an
unadjusted basis by 2018 - the difference being a 72% risk discount.


Canaccord Genuity: Bullish investors on Aquinox will suggest that Dr. Corey Davis from
Canaccord Genuity is the one research analyst who had the AQXP story right. The
problem with this assumption is that Dr. Corey Davis is the only analyst to not have
updated his research since June 25, 2015, which is clearly prior to the COPD trial fail.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 9/18


All three research analysts point to $2-3 per share of value for the BPS/IC indication. It is
noted that these valuation levels assume that AQXP is able to achieve significant market
share, but the risk is further heightened given the competitive market in BPS/IC
indications.


Inex Pharmaceuticals | David Main's Poor History


In 1999, David was appointed the CEO of Inex Pharmaceutical (formerly TSX listed, now
delisted) and in his letter to shareholders stated he was appointed to "complete this
Company's transition from a technology-driven organization to one dedicated to bringing
products through development and commercialization". Five years and three useless
partnerships later, Inex was right back to where it started when David Main was appointed
to lead the company. In June 2005, "chief executive officer David Main and two other
executives are departing as the company continues to slash its workforce in a bid to
conserve cash and chart 'a new strategic path'". In the end, David and Inex failed with
shareholder value being wiped out as illustrated in the following chart:


Refer to Appendix A for additional details on the failed partnerships entered into by Inex
with David Main steering the ship. Refer to Appendix E for a show of how little David is
invested in both Inex and Aquinox. Refer to Appendix F for a material error made and then
fixed in recent management disclosure.


Final Thoughts | The Stock Is Up for No Reason Other Than Its Low Float


I would be the first to be excited if a bladder pain indication could work; however, various
questions remain regarding regulatory, commercialization, partnership, financing and
currently defined trial risks. In conclusion, AQXP is a low float stock with limited trading
that is struggling to develop a family of anti-inflammatory drugs. After a couple of early
disappointments, it finally produced some positive results that caused the stock to explode

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 10/18


in price and volume due to heavy activity by short-term traders. The company is fully
prepared to conduct an offering and needs to do so to complete its drug program. While
the company has a long-term chance at being successful, the short-term mix of a likely
offering and heavy participation of short-term traders leaves significant downside potential
for the stock price.


Appendix A | Failed Inex Pharmaceuticals Partnerships


In 2000, David set the objective for Inex to sign a commercial partnership agreement; this
was not achieved until the second quarter of 2001.


Elan Corporation: One of Inex's first partnerships was a joint venture with Elan
Corporation (formerly, NYSE:ELN) to develop and sell Onco TCS. On May 23, 2001, when
Elan and Inex announced the joint venture, David stated "The completion of a joint venture
agreement with Elan gives us the financial, technical and marketing support to broaden
and accelerate the commercialization of Onco TCS". This deal was rampant with issues
as Elan came under scrutiny from the SEC for misleading accounting practices whereby
"Elan obscured the true demand for the licensed technology and the company's ability to
generate license revenue in the future, thereby misleading investors about the quality of
the revenue, earnings and cash flow that it generated from its joint venture program". On
June 11, 2002, Elan announces three areas of focus, and the joint venture with Inex is not
included in that yet David still states "We are in close contact with Elan and have
confirmed Elan's commitment to this project moving forward. Both companies will continue
to work within the existing development agreement for Onco TCS until an alternate
commercialization strategy is finalized". On April 3, 2003, David later had Inex reacquire
full rights of the joint venture from Elan ending the partnership with no fruit to show.


GlaxoSmithKline: Next, Inex signed a marquee partnership agreement with
GlaxoSmithKline PLC (NYSE:GSK) in November 2001, licensing its drug delivery
technology for use in a GSK drug. GSK ended this partnership which ended no better than
the Elan joint venture. On August 4, 2004, GSK terminated the agreement as a result of "a
number of technical problems in manufacturing the necessary supply of materials needed
for clinical trials".


Enzon Pharmaceuticals: Third time's a charm? Perhaps not. Inex entered a partnership
agreement with Enzon Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ENZN) in January 2004 to finally
commercialize Onco TCS (now being called Marqibo). With high hopes David states
"Enzon has expertise in the development, manufacturing and marketing of liposomal
drugs and has the motivation to make Onco TCS sales an important part of its future". On

5/19/2018 Aquinox Pharmaceuticals: Low Float Insanity Meets Biotech Bubble - Aquinox Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AQXP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3424966-aquinox-pharmaceuticals-low-float-insanity-meets-biotech-bubble 11/18


May 13, 2004, with respect to Inex's New Drug Application for Onco TCS for non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma, Main said "We believe our data are compelling and address an
important unmet medical need". On April 26, 2004, David illustrated his outlook for Inex
Pharmaceutical: "In conclusion, 2004 will be another landmark year for INEX - the most
important event being the FDA review of Onco TCS. A successful review of Onco TCS will
also allow us to complete our goal of evolving into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical
company. On behalf of the Board of Directors and our executive team, I extend our
appreciation to all our shareholders for their support and our employees for their
dedication and uncompromising commitment to the success of INEX. I look forward to
reporting continued progress throughout the year ahead". By December 2004, the FDA
had indicated to Inex that it was unimpressed with its Onco TCS indication. A little over a
year later on March 17, 2005, Enzon terminated its agreement with Inex as the FDA did
not approve the commercialization of Marqibo after its phase 3 trials that Inex "failed to do
enough research to justify approving its experimental cancer treatment" and that "its
marketing partner Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc may be too small to provide the necessary
data".


Appendix B | Capital Structure Move Over One Day Ended Aug 7, 2015


I will be the first to admit that a biotech trading at a negative enterprise value is alluring;
however, I would also suggest that a huge move in the stock price is not as alluring.

Appendix D | Competition


Theracoat Coatings has also reviewed the treatment of painful bladder
syndrome/interstitial.


Cystitis (PBS/IC) with intravesical instillations of botulinum toxin A (BTX) is an appealing
alternative to injections. Its previously tested efficacy was shortlasting due to the short
exposure of the urothelium to BTX. Although it appears that these results are early stage,
it's an indication of incremental competition whereby the indication was well tolerated, safe
and sustained reduction in PBS/IC over 12 weeks.


Other studies are also be conducted by ICStudy LLC and a pilot study through the
European Association of Urology with regards to potential bladder and pain.


Appendix E | CEO With Limited Faith In His Company


David owned a minor amount of shares in Inex Pharmaceuticals:


David not only has a small position in Aquinox, but also he has trimmed his holdings since
the company came public in March 2014 from 219,660 (roughly 2.2% of outstanding
stock) to 80,989 (roughly 0.8% of outstanding stock):

It is always concerning for me when a CEO maintains a significant salary when the
company continues to perform poorly. In the case of Inex, David was being paid $1 million
a year (source - see page 8).


Appendix F | Sloppy Management, Sloppy Results


On August 7, 2015, AQXP put out a clarifying 8-K correcting an error made in its press
release from after close August 6, 2015 "The Original 8-K and the Press Release
contained an error in stating the improvement in pain (2 points or greater on an 11-point
NRS scale) in the Company's LEADERSHIP trial for placebo was 39%. The improvement
in pain (2 points or greater on an 11-point NRS scale) in the Company's LEADERSHIP
trial for placebo was 34%".

Really excellent work!

This had to be some seriously well coordinated Stock manipulation. Somebody planned this in advance and had lots
of fire power to make it happen.

I'm pretty sure the one(s) who did that think: OOPS, with 1500% up anyone doing anything naughty will be
caught as this was TOO obvious.

Agree great report. I am perplexed that the Baker Brothers bought so many shares at 10-11 especially with a shelf
due at any time. I wonder if they traded them. I would have. Nothing that great in their pipeline.

This company if successful we bump the price far and above its current price 
Many suffer but few let others know. Baker bros are no fools in biotech. 
A new drug in an old marketplace where the need is reportedly unmet can present a lot of potential and continuation
in stock appreciation.

Baker Brothers have some duds that haven't moved in years. I own a few- IDRA GHDX.

Looks like it's ramping up, again, today.

looks like it should run on a 3 mil share float and lot of buyers lining up

What's fascinating to me about this is Baker Brothers helping to bid the stock up 500% in a day, following the release
of data that was only incremental and not completely unexpected given the data released in June.


Who starts buying a stock below $2 and keeps buying much of the free float in the same day until the stock is above
$10?


Even if the intentions were good, the amount of hubris involved there is amazing.

1) How does a stock squeeze in only 1 day? Thought shorts had until 3 day clearing in almost all cases.


2) How does a stock squeeze at 7AM as it did today.


3) I smell scam and manipulation here. Guess who.

One comment on market size - while Elmiron is the only FDA approved drug for IC, it has demonstrated effectiveness
for only a small fraction of people with IC. Additionally, Elmiron has a high incidence of side effects, so most patients
don't stay on it very long. A company that comes up with an effective (with limited side effects) treatment will find a
market much larger than Elmiron.
