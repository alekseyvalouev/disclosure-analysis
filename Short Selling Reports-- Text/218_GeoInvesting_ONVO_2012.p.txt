Organovo Shares Could Be Headed To $3 Per Share
Jun. 27, 2012 12:09 PM ET43 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Note: This article has been corrected to reflect that the date for lockup expiration is
unknown.


Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) was added to our speculative screen on
February 28th 2012 at $1.65. We stated:


ONVO Just completed a reverse merger with a company focused on the development
of bio-printing technology for research and medical applications.
Concurrent with its reverse merge, the company was able to raise $6.5 million.
ONVO was beginning to attend investor conferences.


On June 25, 2012, we alerted our Premium members that we were taking a short position
in ONVO shares.


Look Out Below


Since February 28, 2012 ONVO has skyrocketed, reaching a high of $10.90 on June 18,
2012. We see little fundamental reason to explain why the stock has made such an
aggressive move. But we believe that shares could get destroyed once an S-1 filed on
June 13, 2012 goes effective. This will allow investors who bought shares on the cheap at
$1.00 per share in three private placements (see pg. 13 of the S-1) that took place in
February and March of 2012 to begin liquidating their positions. As we will soon discuss,
the amount of ONVO shares that could hit the market is massive compared to its current
outstanding share count.


The Big Elephant in the room: Details in an S-1 filing could lead to a free fall in
ONVO shares


The biggest reason to conclude that ONVO shares could implode is due to the fact that
the company just filed an S-1 that, when it goes effective, could lead to massive
shareholder selling.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/687621-organovo-shares-could-be-headed-to-3-per-share 2/16


Side Bar about the Offering Process


An S-1 or S-3 is filed to allow:


A company to offer new shares to the market


Certain company shareholders to sell their stock.


However, the SEC must review the filing(s) and designate them effective before shares can be sold


related to the filing(s). Individuals that invest in private placement are often restricted from selling


their shares until an S-1 is filed and goes effective. This restriction often ranges from 90 to 180 days.


ONVO's outstanding share count is around 44 million. Fifteen million Shares (most of
which were part of the 2012 private placements) have been locked up (unable to be sold),
but will be eligible for resale once the S-1 is effective. Furthermore, 16.7 million in-the-
money warrants (with an exercise price of $1) could also be set free when the S-1 goes
effective, leading to significant dilution. Shares outstanding would increase 61% to 60.4
million. This calculation does not even include 7.44 million shares:


896,256 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, at a
weighted average exercise price of $0.08 per share, which were issued under the
company's 2008 Equity Incentive Plan prior to this offering; and
6,553,986 shares of common stock which remain available for grant and possible
subsequent issuance under the company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.


In any event, a whopping 32 million shares will be eligible to hit the market soon. We don't
know when the SEC will deem the S-1 effective, but the company has agreed to use its
reasonable efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within 180 days of
the S-1 (registration statement) filed on June 13, 2012. (see 8K/A, February 8, 2012, page
62, Registration Rights Agreement). Given the sharp run-up in ONVO shares, once the S-
1 does go effective we are betting that the investors in the 2012 Private Placement will yell
fire and rush to the exits as soon as they are able to sell per the terms of the private
placement…


“Lock-up Agreements


In connection with the Merger, each of the officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of
our Common Stock and certain employees and affiliates of the Placement Agent have
agreed to “lock-up” and not sell or otherwise transfer or hypothecate any of their shares
for a term equal to the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months from the Closing Date of the
Merger; or (ii) six (6) months following the effective date of the Registration Statement

registering the shares of Common Stock included in the Units as well as the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor Warrants and the Bridge Warrants.”
(8K/A, February 8, 2012, page 9).


In this volatile market, wouldn't you seriously consider locking in a return of a $9.30 stock
that you own with a cost basis of $1.00 and associated warrants also with a cost basis of
$1.00? We do find it odd that the stock is pumping into the S-1 registration leading us to
postulate that the market has not realized that ONVO has filed the S-1.


We believe that the market will change its tune on ONVO once it realizes that a massive
amount of shares may need to find liquidity for 190 potential sellers listed in the S-1!


So, Why Have ONVO Shares Dramatically Risen?


We have noticed that companies that are able to raise capital in conjunction with their
reverse merger transactions sometimes perform well in the near term, possibly due to a
sense of legitimacy that investors may feel arises from "institutional backing." ONVO was
able to raise total net proceeds of $11,593,065.91 in its February and March 2012 private
placements.


Adding to ONVO's air of legitimacy, it claims to have:


"Collaborative research agreements currently in effect with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and
United Therapeutics Corporation (NASDAQ:UTHR)"
Reported 2011 revenues of around $1 million.


ONVO's business description also has an appealing futuristic feel to it:


"…Organovo Holdings, Inc. develops NovoGen three-dimensional human tissue
printing technology for creating tissue on demand for research and surgical
applications. Its NovoGen 3D printing technology is a platform that works across
various tissue and cell types. Organovo Holdings, Inc. serves physicians and
researchers involved in the fields of cardiovascular medicine, medical research, and
transplant medicine..."


In laymen's terms, ONVO's technology uses real human tissue in the application of
research and surgical procedures.


Regardless of the "wow" factor present in ONVO's business description, we believe
reasons exist to exercise extreme caution when considering ONVO shares as a near-term
long investment option.

1. With such a "great technology" and relationship with two behemoth pharma companies
(PFE, UTHR), why did the company choose a reverse merger transaction to go public,
rather than an IPO transaction?


2. We consider the collaborative investment to be peanuts ($688,000 in 2011). While it is
great that reputable firms have allotted funds toward ONVO, in the scheme of things
this amount is such a small nut for these large companies.


3. The majority of the 2011 reported revenues came from what we consider potentially
non-operating sources (collaborations and grants). Pure product revenue was a mere
$223 thousand.


4. The meaningful commercialization of ONVO's technology from a revenue view point
seems to be well into the future and would probably require a constant amount of
funding.


5. The stock is selling at a market cap of over $400 million compared to revenues of
around $1 million.


Quotes from company filings amplify some of these issues:


1. It does not appear that ONVO will generate meaningful sales and profitability in the
foreseeable future:

"…As of March 31, 2012, we had devoted substantially all of our efforts to
product development, raising capital and building infrastructure. We did not, as of
that date, realize significant revenues from our planned principal operations.
Accordingly, we are considered to be in the development stage…"


"…We have generated operating losses since we began operations, including
$1,338,694, $3,964,610 and $1,329,130 for the year ended December 31, 2010
and 2011 and the three months ended March 31, 2012, respectively, and as of
March 31, 2012, we had an accumulated operating loss of $43,772,138. We
expect to incur substantial additional operating expenses over the next several
years as our research, development, and commercial activities increase. The
amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are
uncertain…"


"…We have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses, and
expect to incur significant additional operating losses…"


"…In the United States and most foreign countries, we will be required to
complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory
approval to market the product…"


2. Constant dilution seems like a certainty:
"…We need to secure additional financing to support our planned operation…"


Weak Auditor Raises our Red Flag


The most recent PCAOB Inspection of ONVO's auditor, Mayer Hoffman McCann, does not
lift our confidence


"…The deficiencies identified in one of the audits reviewed included a deficiency of
such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm, at the time it
issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient competent evidential matter to
support its opinion on the issuer's financial statements..."


Valuation:


It is easy to get excited about a company like ONVO that is attempting to make strides in
medical research, but we think the valuation, given the facts, is insane.

5/23/2018 Organovo Shares Could Be Headed To $3 Per Share - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/687621-organovo-shares-could-be-headed-to-3-per-share 6/16


A bullish ONVO Seeking Alpha article mentioned two comparables, Scolr Pharma Inc
(NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSYS). Both firms generate significant
revenues, are profitable and are selling at market cap to sales ratios of 5. Both of these
companies serve the three-dimensional (3D) printer market, so we are not sure why the
author even used them as comparable to ONVO. Regardless, the author should realize
that ONVO, a company with minimal revenues, is selling at a market cap to sales ratio of
over 500, assuming all in-the-money warrants are exercised!


We believe a more appropriate comparable would be a direct competitor mentioned in
ONVO's S-1 filing, Advanced BioHealing, Inc. Advanced BioHealing planned an initial
public offering in May of 2011, but chose not to when Shire Plc agreed to buy the company
a day before the biotechnology company was to go public. The company had planned to
offer 13.4 million shares, priced from $14 to $16 and would have had 39.8 million shares
outstanding, giving its shares a market-cap of around $600 million or a market-cap to
sales ratio of 4. Advanced BioHealing achieved 2012 revenues of $140 million and was
profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Investors can view the Advanced BioHealing May 16,
2011 prospectus here. Armed with this data, we can derive an approximate value of
ONVO's shares of it were to IPO today:


ONVO's 2011 revenues ~ $1 million
ONVO's market-cap assuming all warrants are exercised: 60 million outstanding
shares times current price per share of 9.1 = $546 million
ONVO's market-cap to sales ratio >500


In making a casual observation, we believe it is ridiculous that the valuation ($546 million)
of a company with virtually no revenues is on par with a top tier company with meaningful
revenues that is profitable. But we will still give ONVO the benefit of the doubt.


Let's be foolishly optimistic and assume that ONVO will accomplish the unthinkable and
generate $45 million in revenues in 2012, which matches the revenues Advanced
Biohealing, inc. achieved after its first full year of product commercialization.


Let's also assume that investors are willing to pay four times our revenue 2012
assumptions. Doing this yields a valuation scenario of $3.0. ($40 million in sales times 4
divided by 60 million shares).


If you wanted to believe that ONVO is going to revolutionize its industry then let's get
crazy and believe that investors will be willing to pay eight times sales, or $6.0.

Obviously, we believe these valuation scenarios are still unrealistic as might investors
who, just 4 months ago, funded this company at much lower prices than today's current
price. Our valuation assumptions don't even include dilution from very probable future
equity financing.


In the end, we need to ask why ONVO didn't follow the route of a company like American
BioHealing instead of performing an RTO transaction that, from an investing point of view,
may destroy its capital structure.


Disclosure: I am short ONVO.


Additional disclosure: We are short a very small amount of ONVO shares; we are
continuing to look for shares to short, but are having hard time finding shares

The Article that I referenced is below and it is why I questioned Organovo's future stock price. Without the
following information I would have still considered ONVO a stong stock with a bright future regardless of
dilution. In light of this article I have to re-evalute and do additional research.

I agree that fundamentally Organovo (ONVO) doesn't add up. However, it goes without saying that speculative bio-
techs are often subject to this kind of frenzy trading. Shorting ONVO might not be a bad play for a limited time and is
an opportunity to go long when shares get to a good buy level around $4. In my article where I write about (SSYS)
and (ONVO) it was not in comparison, it was meant to be informative. I am long both companies and consider
Stratasys a better play short term due to their rapidly growing revenue streams and new merger with Objet so I now
have $40 buy target. I also wrote that Organovo is a long term investment that I plan on holding for a while before
taking gains. I credit the huge burst in share price to new awareness to the company and its patented break-through
3D bio printer. Organovo started off as a micro-cap and has yet to be discussed on CNBC; when they gain more
publicity more shareholders will be driven to the stock. So while I agree it is early to make this more than a
speculative play; you could end up regretting not getting in this one for the long run. The implications of a printer
replicating live cells and soon hopefully organs, can't be held lightly. If Organovo can manage to create replacement
organs (they are already perfecting tissues) then they could end up as one of the biggest companies of our
generation. Organovo already has many partnerships in the line-up with an experienced management team. They
have made great strides to hire new strategic and financial officers who have experience operating publicly traded
companies. The CEO Keith Murphy has a long standing relationship with Amgen which could be another source for
funding. Amgen could be a future buy-out prospect too (although I think Organovo knows their bio printers can't be
valued right now.)

Andrew, 
Please take the time to read the link I provided on Seeking Alpha regarding this technology. I think the info
hurt your positions in the long run. There may be a much better play just around the bend unless (SSYS) or
(ONVO) make a move for this new technology.

Great analysis. Was truly wondering what was motoring this thing, and counting my blessings I sold above $9. As a
hometown company with, as you say, a "wow" idea, I can't help but want this company to succeed, am glad you have
reaffirmed reality.

Author’s reply »  Andrew, Thanks for the post. I have this saying.. good companies are not always good stocks. The
manner in which ONVO went public could make this an ugly stock long-term. They went public too early and will dilute
shareholders' interest. The capital structure could be a mess. How do you propose we value this company as a
buyout target?

@ Goman - very interesting article. If they can print organs with their methods i'll be astounded and become an
investor haha. Organovo has already got veins printed out and is probably working on prototype organs already. I find
it hard to imagine that the method described in the article is anywhere near fruition with more complicated cell
structures like Organs. Certainly I don't think they are ahead of Organovo. It is possible that they accomplish it first,
however without huge funding, a stellar management team, and innovative lab technology I don't see them beating
Organovo to the punch.


@Maj - Here is some more info on Keith Murphy's experience at Amgen

Seeking Alpha can publish all the stories it wants pumping stocks, but at the end of the day, each person is
responsible for deciding whether to buy or short. If an article isn't self serving then what's the point. This move
in ONVO is just one of many ideas on SA that gets blown out of proportion because people just don't know
better and they get drawn in by greed. Andrew says that "fundamentally ONVO doesn't add up". So my
question is... Why didn't he mention that at the time in his original article or highlight some cautionary
points???? Even at this level the valuation is absurd. Round and round we go... GLTA.


28 Jun 2012, 08:25 AM

noshadyldy....your logic is unsound regarding SA's article and blame. Blaming SA for one of their articles is
like killing the bus company that picked up a pick pocket. That's just where thieves go for the best bang for
their buck. You should know that and more wailing won't make it better. Haven't you noticed that many writers
are pitching their book which means more DD not less?

Author’s reply »  How can you place any blame on Seeking Alpha? SA is a platform for investors to voice their
opinion. If SA began discriminating who can and can't publish articles they would be guilty of endorsing ideas.. and
maybe guilty of indirectly pumping ideas. The only entity to blame here is ONVO. It seems possible that the stock was
being manipulated to allow the pipe investors to exit. We are led to believe that the S-1 has to go effective at SEC.gov
in order for restricted investors to sell positions. But I do believe that the companies sometimes send letters to
investors telling them that the s-1 is effective before it hits SEC.gov. I still do not know how the stock is going to
absorb the selling that could be on the way.

Your article here is an absolute Gem of an article, and seems to have triggered many to really think through
what it is they are doing.


Fundamentally, how will the company earns its income?  
They will sell a 3 D computer that will print cells.


So how many customers are there for the technology? How many/printers/computer... will they produce?
What is the expected revenue and how does that translate to the bottom line goals of the company?


I know over all the revenue from Regenerative medicine is big and will be a home run. Who will be the first to
truly capture a lead in this arena is anyone's question but Organovo does have a good concept. For now they
need to define how they will produce revenue. A conference call would be nice for shareholders.


I am just saying :-)

I also held on. Think a person who admits they are short is only in this for their own gain. The people involved with
this company are very experienced and there is still the top 50 companies recognized by MIT article.

Not sure whats going on with this company, but all the information in this article was made public at
http://www.sec.gov as of 6/13/12. On that date ONVO closed at $6.04, 5 days later (6/18/12) it tops off at $10.90.
That's a 80+% increase after the news. Why suddenly did this implode? Someone is definitely manipulating this stock

The Article that I referenced is below and it is why I questioned Organovo's future stock price. Without the
following information I would have still considered ONVO a stong stock with a bright future regardless of
dilution. In light of this article I have to re-evalute and do additional research.

Researchers at the MIT-Harvard Division of Health Sciences and Technology have created a new type of
“biological LEGO” building blocks that can be used to form new organs. By binding cells together into tiny
block-like structures researchers have found that they can precisely recreate human tissues. Best of all, the
technique doesn’t require expensive specialized machinery – the MIT researchers believe that their biological
building block technology could be replicated in any lab in the world.

Nice! Bought in at less than $3 few months ago on the speculative play. Bagged out on all but a couple hundy 'who
cares' shares at nearly $10 a pop. Absolutely no analysis done other than reading the more than obvious tea leaves:
ie. 3D printing all the rage,..... for the moment... ;-)


Tidy profit, sunk back to cash, thank you very much. That dry powder smells sweet! Kept a few ONVO coals in the fire
for long 10-15 year term of course, with potential to dribble some more back in on the cheap. Sell Mortimer, sell!

Just keep the stock and quit the whining. The game is fun and this is all part of it. Sell it if you like. I'm keeping my
ONVO. If you are going to get nervous or mad, then don't play. It's a free country.

nativekray:


My apologies for not being more clear. Perhaps you missunderstood my comment. I bought some shares of ONVO at
$2.75 a few months ago and recently sold some shares at $10 a pop. A 3x bagger in a few months time, all the while
keeping some ONVO shares for the very long term. 'Sell, Mortimer sell', is all about waiting for the fuel to burn on the
short sell of this stock and then buying more on the dirt cheap after pocketing the trunk full of cash made from the
dramatic uptick. Keep in mind, the shorts are always late to kill the party. Like a good cop at the door... Don't be
naive...


I'm a firm believer ONVO stock has legs in the long term, maybe... ;-)

In any event, a whopping 32 million shares will be eligible to hit the market soon. We don't know when the SEC will
deem the S-1 effective, but the high end lockup period window ranges between May 29, 2012 and August 29, 2012.
Given the sharp run-up in ONVO shares, once the S-1 does go effective we are betting that the investors in the 2012
Private Placement will yell fire and rush to the exits. In this volatile market, wouldn't you seriously consider locking in a
return of a $9.30 stock that you own with a cost basis of $1.00 and associated warrants also with a cost basis of
$1.00? We do find it odd that the stock is pumping into the S-1 registration leading us to postulate that the market has
not realized that ONVO has filed the S-1.


New passage:


In any event, a whopping 32 million shares will be eligible to hit the market soon. We don't know when the SEC will
deem the S-1 effective, but the company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to have the registration statement
declared effective within 180 days of the S-1 (registration statement) filed on June 13, 2012. (see 8K/A, February 8,
2012, page 62, Registration Rights Agreement). Given the sharp run-up in ONVO shares, once the S-1 does go
effective we are betting that the investors in the 2012 Private Placement will yell fire and rush to the exits as soon as
they are able to sell per the terms of the private placement…


“Lock-up Agreements


In connection with the Merger, each of the officers, directors and holders of 5% or more of our Common Stock and
certain employees and affiliates of the Placement Agent have agreed to “lock-up” and not sell or otherwise transfer or
hypothecate any of their shares for a term equal to the earlier of (i) twelve (12) months from the Closing Date of the
Merger; or (ii) six (6) months following the effective date of the Registration Statement registering the shares of
Common Stock included in the Units as well as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Investor
Warrants and the Bridge Warrants.” (8K/A, February 8, 2012, page 9).

Cris69- 
My comment wasn't directed to you, but for the general tone of this thread, it seems, of people bellyaching about the
drop in the stock. Believe me, I have lost plenty. That is the risk one takes. A person can play it safe and stuff their
money between the mattress and the box springs if they like. That is less risky behavior. Those that bought low and
sold, blessings upon you. I'll just take a chance and keep going with it. Maybe I'll make a million or maybe I'll lose it
all, but it is my decision. Just don't blame others if you don't like your results.

taken-over for under half a billion, so go figure!

Cris_69
Ah yes 424B3 filed and private shares now effective. In that case all those fine vested folk will be waiting for better
returns before cashing in.... Nice. If you bought in at $1 on the private inside and caught a wiff just a few months ago
of what some average bloke like me closed, buying a boatload at ~$3 and selling at ~$10 a pop: you aint selling now,
you holding and buying like a mother and to hell with current Company finacials given the potential. The only thing I'm
regretting is not shorting this sucker at the high, cashing in twice.


Starting to look like a decent point to plow in more shares, riding this mother long term to the "potential" buyout.... Of
course, one doesn't need an actual buyout. The potential 'threat; will work just fine. -All long term financial thinking
and planning of course, as I carry this wheelbarrel of cash from the previous ONVO sale over to the bank.
