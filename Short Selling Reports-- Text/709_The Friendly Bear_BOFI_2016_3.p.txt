30 For 30: Signs Of Internal Audit Shake-Up Ahead Of Crucial 10-K
Filing
Jul. 13, 2016 8:42 AM ET101 comments
by: The Friendly Bear


Summary


BOFI's troubles date back to March 2015, when two internal auditors abruptly left the
company under questionable circumstances; these departures ultimately culminated
in a whistleblower lawsuit.


The New York Times exposed these departures in August 2015; investors who
exited their BOFI positions following the exposure of these departures saved
themselves from a 50%+ sell-off.


We found new evidence of another major shake-up in the internal audit department,
including what appears to be the departure of the Chief Audit Executive after only
~1yr of service.


Our findings confirm our view that the company is falling apart; the timing is rather
ominous given that BOFI is in the process of completing its FY16 10-K.


The Probes Reporter also recently suggested that BOFI is involved in an ongoing
SEC investigation, which may help explain why audit/compliance turnover has
suddenly picked up in recent months.


Imagine this hypothetical situation for a second. You are a publicly traded and heavily
regulated bank. A March 2015 shakeup in your internal audit division (including the
resignation of your head of internal audit) and a subsequent October 2015 whistleblower
lawsuit are followed by a massive collapse in the value of your company's shares. Law
firms open up investigations into your company's business practices and their research
points to a toxic work environment fraught with turnover and loose internal controls. You
launch a process to combat the negative PR. In an effort to calm the market's fears, you
try to strengthen your internal control function. You bulk up your internal audit team,
including hiring a veteran internal auditor with over 30 years of experience. You then
publicly tout this new Chief Audit Executive's background in both conference calls
as well as in litigation in which you refer to him as an "expert witness" on matters

pertaining to internal audit and controls. You also start highlighting the strength of your
internal compliance and controls on conference calls, in an effort to assuage the market's
concerns.


June 2016 rolls around. You know this will be an all-important period in your company's
history. It is your fiscal year-end. But not just any run-of-the-mill fiscal year-end. A series of
serious allegations have been made against your company and the market will be closely
scrutinizing your 10-K filing and any disclosures pertaining to your relationships with
regulators. In fact, one of your biggest cheerleaders at Craig Hallum points to the potential
future filing of a clean 10-K as a positive catalyst for your heavily shorted stock.


This whole scandal, the whole reason your stock has been under intense scrutiny for the
past year, all started as a result of the mysterious turnover in your audit organization.
Given this tenuous backdrop, what is the one thing that you would not want happening
right before the filing of your 10-K?


How about what appears to be the mysterious and sudden departure of your Chief
Audit Executive in June 2016, right in front of the filing of your 10-K? As well as the
departure of numerous other internal audit/compliance executives in the past few
months?


BOFI's CEO proudly boasted about this Chief Audit Executive's qualifications in a
September 2015 call, in which he stated that the individual in question has "30
years of experience." Following a tweak to his Linkedin profile, the title of "Chief
Audit Executive" is now claimed by a BOFI employee who does not even appear to
be 30 years of age.


In other words, did BofI (BOFI) just pull off a…

Source: Chief Audit Executive through June 2016, Interim Chief Audit profile


The profile on the left, which ties to the individual that was highlighted in BOFI conference
calls from last year, as well as in BOFI litigation from last year, suggests that the Chief
Audit Executive left his role in June 2016. He lists no new position in his LinkedIn profile.


Our suspicion is further bolstered by the profile on the right hand side of the image above
which points to another employee at BOFI now holding the title of Interim Chief Audit
Executive. Readers can come to their own conclusions as to what may have happened
that could have caused the Chief Audit Executive to leave in just over one year's time
right ahead of the company finalizing its 10-K for the FY ended June 2016, but we
want to take a moment to make sure that BOFI does not try to spin a tale of the executive
in question being underqualified for the job he was tasked with (i.e. what they did to Mr.
Ball following his resignation in March 2015).


In a September 2015 conference call, BOFI's CEO made the following commentary
regarding the Chief Audit Executive in question:

Then in an October 2015 call, Garrabrants made the following comment regarding the
Chief Audit Executive in question:

Finally, BOFI itself cited this individual's merits as an expert in one of its court motions as
part of the whistleblower litigation.


Tomlinson is providing testimony within the scope of his employment. Even if
characterized as "expert testimony," Tomlinson is the First Vice President, Chief
Audit Executive at BofI and possesses the necessary knowledge, skill, experience,
training and education to be qualified as an expert on internal audit and compliance
in the banking sector pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702.


Source: Motion from BofI Federal Bank v. Erhart et al.


Finally, we note that the Chief Audit Executive in question happens to have joined in May
2015, at a time when he may very well have not been fully apprised of the problems at
BOFI. The whistleblower lawsuit did not break until October 2015, meaning the individual
in question may not have realized what he was stepping into when he first took a job with
the company.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3988101-30-30-signs-internal-audit-shake-ahead-crucial-10-k-filing 5/31


The circumstances surrounding the Chief Audit Executive's potential departure are
clearly uncertain and we will leave it to BOFI management to comment on the
circumstances surrounding any changes to titles and roles within the internal audit
division. However, we also note that the Chief Audit Executive does not appear to
be the only person from the Internal Audit/Compliance department at BOFI who has
left the since the whistleblower lawsuit broke.


The last time there was a mass exodus in Internal Audit at BOFI (March 2015),
management did not mention the turnover to the public until it was forced to do so after a
New York Times article in August 2015. Following the article, BOFI played down the
turnover and claimed that it was simply "upgrading" staff. These claims managed to
somewhat calm investor fears. However, since that time, allegations of wrongdoing have
picked up materially, including, but not limited to allegations of related party dealings
involving the Chairman of the company's Audit Committee.


Therefore, longs are now facing a major dilemma. If our analysis of Linkedin
profiles is in fact accurate, which appears to be based on the tweak of both the
Chief Audit Executive profile as well as the introduction of an "Interim Chief Audit
Executive" title… then one glaring question remains for BOFI shareholders.


Were the employees that left the company in June 2016 uncomfortable with BOFI's
business practices and worried about being there for the close of fiscal year 2016?
If so, do these departures signal trouble ahead for the company's financial filings?


We note that the Probes Reporter has recently highlighted BOFI in a tweet suggesting that
the company may be the subject of an SEC investigation. An article discussing this tweet
can be found here. This tweet is perhaps just one of the many reasons for the turnover we
have identified at BOFI.

Audit Executive's.

We strongly encourage longs to diligence these troubling changes. As a reminder, the last
time there was a major shakeup in BOFI's audit division, the stock nose-dived:

The stakes are far higher this time. Relative to August 2015, the circumstances
surrounding BOFI presently are far more troubling. Allegations have exponentially grown,
and the company continues to try its best to silence its critics and deflect blame.


When a company is dealing with the major accusations that BOFI currently faces, a strong
and stable internal audit and compliance team is critically important to keep the ship on
the right course. This is also something that bank examiners will look into as they probe
BOFI's operations. Management turnover in key audit roles is one of the key issues that
bank regulators probe as part of their CAMEL ratings.


We therefore believe that if our suspicions in this article are in fact accurate, BOFI and its
shareholders that continue to trust management are on a collision course. Instead of
acknowledging issues and building a stronger and more compliant business, we believe
BOFI has gone out of its way to attack its critics and ignore the harsh realities about its
business.


While we are sure management will attribute turnover to its "tough love" culture
and its focus on minimizing efficiency ratios through low bonus retention
payments, we think that these arguments are in fact just excuses for a company
that does not care about investing in a culture of compliance.


Readers who follow The Friendly Bear will recall that in response to our last article, BOFI's
CEO made the following statement in the April earnings call:

Before I turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results, I'll provide some
brief commentary on the recently filed amended complaint and the recent
anonymous short-seller hit piece that appeared coordinated with the legal filing
and the timing of the recent options expiration.


We vehemently disagree with his comical and factually inaccurate characterization of our
last article. But, given that the next options expiration date is this Friday, we do have an
idea for how the CEO can respond to this article.

The auditor left because he got fired. He can't find a job. Like some Americans when you can't perform your job, you
seek retribution against your former company.


Bofil will spend any money in court to fight the baseless accusations. The stock has gone up because investors
recognize the baseless and factless accusations. It is an angry auditor that got fired for underperformance. Only in
America can you proceed in frivoless lawsuits.


The individual is NOT a whistle blower. The SEC has stated the accusations are not facts and he can't be recognized
as a whistle blower.


Also there is no SEC investigation.

And the tough performance culture isn't an excuse. I read a glassdoor thing where they fire 10% of workforce
each year. The CEO came from Goldman Sachs, which has the same system in place. Even the negative
glassdoor reviews just complain about hours, or not getting a bonus, or enough training. But then the positive
reviews indicate that you won't survive if you're not a self-starter. So it just sounds like it's not for

Erhart? The crazy thing is this. So, his lawyer was subpoenaed by BofI. And in this article that I read, the
lawyer acknowledges that she reached out to the New York Times before they went to the regulator. The NYT
probably told them that they didn't have a story yet. So, Erhart goes to the regulator. The regulator
investigates, and clears BofI of everything. So, still no story. Until, Erhart files a lawsuit. you can't write a story
about a "whistleblower" that regulators decided had nothing, but you can write a story about a disgruntled
former employee who filed a wrongful termination lawsuit. This whole thing STINKS.

Good question - how about this:

We only need to sow the seed of distrust in their regulators, the investors can extrapolate whatever they want from

Nice detective work Friendly Bear, even if this turns out to be for legit reasons. 
I am also amazed by how much all your articles move BOFI - a company with 1.3bn in capitalization, not some tiny
nano-cap. I guess that shows how nervous BOFI holders are.

That, or how well organized the options traders are with their mouthpiece. 
I personally think all the weak long hands are now gone. This is just regular old fashioned manipulation. Not
that hard for 1B market cap. Happens very regularly on all stocks below 5B Cap and often to ones in the 10B
Cap range. Any smaller than 1B Cap and the options volume gets too small and the spreads too large.

This anonymous author is not given enough credit.


He/She is able to move the stock price down with options expirations in days and completely gets away with it. I kinda
respect that in a way.


If you'd like me to send you the latest court documents, please send me a private message with your email. I have
paid for them and would be happy to send them to others.


I have read through them all, the latest ones came out on 7/1. I'm not a lawyer, but i have a feeling after reading the
documents that this will be over very soon. There is a motion to throw out the entire case before it even goes to trial
and that will be decided by the judge in the next few months (i believe the court date is in August).


If i do send you these documents, please read through both the motion to throw the case out as well as the re-buttal
to that motion, then make your mind up for yourself.


I re-initiated a long position at 17.57 today with about 20% of my portfolio.

These articles are useful. I sold some BOFI at $18.60 yesterday, and now this article enabled me to buy it back at
$16.60. Banking is so overegulated that it is absolutely impossible to comply with the regulations. I don't know
whether BOFI's compliance level is worse than most banks, but I do know that it would be a no-brainer for ex-
employees to cite examples of noncompliance by any bank.

Hi, Im a compliance consultant for financial services. They are in a unique situation. All of their infrastructure
is in one location (I think - i mean, they might have more than one building, i didnt look into that, but besides
the point). The difficulty with enterprise compliance is making sure nothing falls through the cracks across the
enterprise - across all of your branches, back offices, etc. I would imagine, with everything in one place, that
task becomes immeasurably easier. Like, you wouldnt believe how many systems their larger bank
competitors have. And their policies/procedures/co... environment needs to cover all of the disparate systems,
in all of the locations they operate. And you also need to make sure some office/branch/underwri... team
doesn't go rogue. It's just a totally different ball game.

BOFI WASNT SELLING MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES, OF WHICH A VAST MAJORITY OF ITS
PROPERTIES WERE IN FORECLOSURE.

And being in compliance with rules and regulations was something that these too-big-to fail banks chose not
to concern themselves with ...

It is strange that the Interim Chief Audit Executive has a VERY short resume in this area. This is a significant role at a
public company, ESPECIALLY one going through the scrutiny that BOFI is. It is suspicious. I would tread carefully
here.

I must of read every short seller article on SA re BOFI by now and have two observations. 
1. To date, zero regulatory action based on their "research"


2. If you remove the qualifying language from their article, or summarize it, you realize they have nothing of substance
they allege. Key words and phrases, for example, questionable, appears, our view, suggested, imagine, hypothetical,
mysterious, our suspicion, could have caused, may not have been fully apprised, potential departure, clearly
uncertain, may be the subject, we believe etc.


Anyone could write an article regarding any company or author and employ this language, but would there be any
specific factual allegation?

BOFI has grown by about 50% per year for the last several years making 60% LTV loans to rich people whose
financial situations do not fit into the narrow pigeonholes that other banks expect. The stock is trading at a P/E of 9.
Just on the face of it, this stock is a no brainer.

Exactly. And also interesting, I was reading about JPMC's results released yesterday/today in the Journal.
JPMC themself says that the majority of the mortgages they retain are jumbo mortgages. JPMC is doing the
exact same thing as BOFI. The only difference is that BofI is doing it for non-traditional borrowers, and
reaping a windfall - JPMC would do this is they could.


Also, the rate they're charging on loans is actually 4.7%. The reason the rate is ~5% is because they started
at 6.5% in 2010, having bought high quality non-agency loans when everyone else was dumping. They call
this out in their 10k - "we sold lower yielding agency loans and replaced with higher yielding non-agency
loans." I might be wrong here - they might have been referring to MBS, not loans, but I'll double check. The

6.5% has come down as they add more loans in the 4.7-4.8% range, and now sits at roughly 5%. My point is,
4.7% is only 1% higher than other lenders are charging for Qualified Mortgages. That is really not out of the
ballpark at all.

Every month, it feels difficult to write a check to B of I on my 4.75% mortgage when I should be paying 3.5%.
But I guess you are right, it isn't excessive. Thanks for the emotional support. The 12% annual appreciation
on my house eases the pain.


21 Jul 2016, 09:15 AM


rlsco
oh cool! so i was right about the 4.75%? That's great! Yea, First Republic only charges 3%, but 2
considerations. First off, their avg FICO is like 760, where BofI is like 710 (e.g., they'll extend a mortgage to
someone who has a mark on their credit history). And secondly, First Republic competes for mortgages on
price so they can cross-sell their wealth management business, etc. So, maybe 3.75%-4% would be a normal
rate for a 710 FICO borrower (if not competing on price to cross-sell other services), and then BofI charges an
extra .75%-1% because they're extending loans to an underserved market.


One REALLY interesting thing is that Don Hankey owns 5% of the company. He's a billionaire who pioneered
sub-prime auto lendiing. Before the alarms go off, you should research this - he started doing it in like the 70s
and 80s when nobody else would extend sub-prime loans, and as a result, he had no competition and could
set basically whatever prices he wanted. I think he sees the same thing going on here - BofI is catering to
underserved market, and as such, has pricing power.


I also researched two of their lender finance customers, Center Street and Propel Tax. Center Street is a hard
money lender, and they extend loans for ~6 months to "professional" RE investors - basically, professional fix
and flippers. They have conservative LTV requirements, and the payback period is non-negotiable (6
months), which means they turn these loans over super quick - since it's fairly unlikely that a house loses
value in 6 months time, and they have conservative LTV requirements, the downside risk on this type of
lending is fairly low.


Propel Tax offers property tax lien loans. So, they'll buy the rights to collect on a delinquent property tax from
the state of Texas, loan the money to the homeowner, and then let the homeowner pay that off over time.
Property tax liens are senior even to mortgages, so this is another example of a first-lien niche with limited
downside.


Center Street charges like 9% interest. This seems high, but I'd imagine that traditional banks don't do this
kind of lending, so they have pricing power (just like BofI does with its mortgages). Also, the loans are 6
month loans, so the borrower is really only paying 4.5% on the loan (and the value added to the property from
fixing it up is presumably significantly more than that, or Center St wouldn't have any borrowers). Propel sells
tax-lien ABS to investors for like 1.44%, and they charge borrowers up to 11%. 11% seems high, especially
for a super-senior lien that takes precedence to even a first lien mortgage. But, same thing - banks probably

don't do this, so Propel can set its own prices. You can complain about the interest rate, but if you want to
stay in your house, you have to make whole on the property taxes due.

My profile was that I had moved back from Europe after 10 years being there, and so I had no credit in the
U.S. It was not a good idea to cancel my credit cards when I left the U.S. B of I actually looked at my assets
and capital gains and interest income.


First Republic gave a haughty response that they had no interest in my profile. Like you say, they are a white-
shoe asset management outfit.


As far as the hard-money lenders, yes, that is common. In my case, I got a 12% APR hard-money loan for six
months with 4 points, while I convinced B of I to give me a 30-year mortgage. The hard money lender closed
in 48 hours just based on looking at the stats on the property and the fact that I wanted 60% LTV.


As far as I am concerned, banks have become overly conservative in the wake of the housing crisis. Maybe
they are required to if they are too big to fail. But there is definitely a lot of room for "intelligent risk-taking" as
B of I puts it. Remember, even Ben Bernanke was rejected for a mortgage recently.

The CEO buys more than $2 million worth of company stock in June 2016 just prior to the announcement that
earnings will be released on prime time: during mid-week, and in mid-day (on August 2nd).


Possibly, the CEO is clueless about the imminent demise of BOFI at the hands of regulators (as predicted previously
by the author of this blog piece); he has made a very stupid decision.


Possibly, the CEO believes the growth numbers are genuine, and the cost of a regulatory fine (if there is to be one) is
trivial. He surely knows that the suit that has been filed will be tossed out whenever it comes before a judge.


I don't know the CEO personally, but every thing I have heard him say leaves the overwhelming impression that he is
shrewd rather than stupid. So that's where my money is riding.


I've gotten used to flimsy blogs being released prior to options expiration. Bear makes no bones about this. I should
probably try to profit from them since they appear on cue with clockwork precision. But I'm not as confident as Bear
that I can time entry and exit points (perhaps because I don't write a Blog). .

reports, articles, etc. There's alot of managers who'd probably just sell as soon as allegations are raised. Not
worth the "risk" - but, if the allegations are false...


I just read Jon Ball's testimony, he was the head of internal audit through March 2015, and then he quit
because of the work hours (he said so himself). He resigned on like March 5 or something and didn't return to
the offices. So, he clearly wasn't exactly a super happy ex-employee - he said "it became clear that my long
hours would not go away for some time, so i resigned." And his testimony basically excised Ehrhart's
allegations. Ehrhart got a bad performance review, and then went a little crazy. Like, the SEC requested info
related to ETIA or something. BofI had done something with ETIA, but it had nothing to do with the SEC;s
request. Ehrhart shouldve gone to the legal department, and had them call the SEC, if he had an issue - but
he didnt, he called the SEC directly. And the SEC was like "nope...not what we were asking for." Then his
lawyer got in touch with the NYT. No articles or anything. But, then he filed suit against BofI, and he got his
article. He seems really, really disgruntled. That being said, it sounds like the culture at the bank is tough, so i
understand that he didnt agree with his performance review. Also it sounds like Tolla or whoever the boss was
didn't really like Ehrhart. And Ehrhart learned from John Ball that Tolla had taken Ball's review of Ehrhart, and
marked down his performance rating (from what Ball had given him). And Ehrhart was NOT happy about that.


Anyways, there is some color for ya - sounds like BS to me.

loans mature in 6 months, and another $500m in 6 months-1 year. Which is 32% of their loan portfolio....isnt
that strange? i noticed this bc im trying to figure out why the churn is so high. for example, they originated
$3.2b loans for investment in FY'15, but $1.8b were repaid. their avg loan balance was 4.2b (3.5b at

Raymond James -analyst Donald Worthington (he covers BOFI extensively) spoke with BOFI management about the
"allegations" : Worthington says executive left on good terms and decision was mutual, additionally, they were health
related issues as well. The analysts reiterates strong buy in BOFI.


During my career I have never seen a situation like this, where some allegations (which coincides with the option
expiries) can actually drive the price down, without any fact. 
I work in banking and lots of banks are or were under SEC investigations of some issue, Just see the billions of fines
paid in the last years - I can not name a major bank who has not been involved in some sort of penalty. On the other
hand BOFI has never been involved in its 17 years history, and in case they do it is just another bank under the
spectrum of extreme regulation.


Those reports are unprofessional but well written.


We can never be certain of things however, the facts as of today show that BOFI is an extremed undervalued security
without the correct shareholders - you can not sell your share on one of those reports really.

company ( assuming they do not sell) and let BOFI performance be the real barometer.

1B market cap is really not that hard to manipulate. It is actually right at the sweet spot. Big enough to make
serious money on. Small enough to whipsaw the price about. I don't mean "manipulate" in any illegal sense.
Just in the pure literal meaning of the word "to manhandle or to move with intent".

The named Executive left on good terms and there were health complications.


Thank you JP Tissot for that crucial piece of information.


Assuming it is true, it totally undermines the hypothesis developed in Bear's blog piece. Since that hypothesis
no longer has a basis in fact, perhaps facts that have actually been confirmed (e.g. BOFI's annual growth and
relative valuation) can reassert their influence.

If the departure of the internal auditor is related to a material financial matter then why is there: 
No change in external auditor (BDO) nor the external auditory resigning  
No noted disagreements with the external auditor as required to be disclosed in required SEC filings  
No special investigation noted as underway

i wonder why the BOFIL baby bond is resilient? I have made good money on it. It keeps paying me dividends at
6.25%. I loaded up on a few articles ago from these guys when it tanked. Unfortunately the owners of the baby bonds
are catching on and they are holding onto the shares now. Essentially the bank has to be bankrupt if they dont pay me
interest on these. This is better than money sitting in a checking account earning .02% interest.

BofI Holding, Inc. Named a Member of the New KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index

Bofi is at an interesting level at this point in time. The share prices are steady at around 16 dollars and price to book is
around 1.2. They have a board approved buy back of shares which they have not yet activated it appears and most
probably they would buy back only if the share prices go below the book value meaning below 20% of current price as
they also need to watch out the capital adequacy ratio. While the quarterly results would most likely be in line with
analyst expectations my worry is even if they produce a beat on the EPS and revenue the stock probably would not
move much from current price levels unless one of the following things happen 
1. August 12 court hearing summarily dismisses the class action suite . 
2. Short borrowing costs increase from current levels and make it more expensive to borrow. 
3. Bank becomes a merger or acquisition target by a highly capitalised acquirer which helps them with a significant
equity infusion and help grow. 
The shorts are still in the money on this call and seems to have good holding power and with out the above 3 or short
thesis not working out it is quite likely the stock would see current levels at least for few more quarters .

I think chances of acquisition are low because: 
(1) High insider ownership 
(2) A few institutions own very large stakes. 
(3) It is "too good" to sell. Even an offer of double the current share price will cause shareholder lawsuits. As
almost all long holders believe it is worth more than that. 
(4) If you are an institution that sells at $32 you would then have to find something else than is going to return

10x in 8 years time. That is hard to find. Unless the institutions have something better - they will want to stick
with BOFI.


I am strongly hoping BOFI does not get a takeover offer (for the same reason as the big boys, see above).
BOFI have stated in the past that it was their intention - not to be acquired in the foreseeable future. So I
suspect they will rebuff any friendly queries on the subject before they ever become public knowledge. They
have also stated that they would never acquire other bank's assets if they included branches (and they have
remained true to that pledge).

@longdistance12, Few observations  
1. Insider ownership is very small in this company at around 8% 
2. Nearly 200 institutions own majority of the shares at around 80% and the shares are widely held by
institutions 
3. I agree with your view but if the CEO gets repeated cases and does get tired might simply take the double
the offer. In any case shares are at less than half where they used to be many quarters back. 
4. Agree .


21 Jul 2016, 08:22 AM


longdistance12
1. Just 3 insiders own over 7% of the shares. 
2. Just 4 institutions own over 20% of the shares.


A very very small group of owners is very dedicated to this stock, and are highly influential to any takeover.


I don't think a single one of those 7 is remotely interested in $32/share. Most of these made their purchases at
less than $2/share. They are experiencing zero pressure to sell now for a trumped up low price.


Recent shareholders can whine and worry all they like. But these guys are going to wait it out. As will I. I
expect nothing less that 10B market cap for this company.

I think an unqualified opinion from their auditor on the 10-k would also be a catalyst

@risco @Longdistance12 Good comments and appreciated your line of thinking. When is the 10K due for this
company and do you have any thoughts on whether the Internal Audit head resigning would have any impact
on this ?

Don't hope for a buyout, please. The two times I have had my shares forced out from under me, (Dell and
Sauer Danfoss), it was at a price that was too low, and shareholders had to take the buyer to court to get fair
value. And even then, I would have preferred to keep the shares.

It would disprove everything the shorts are saying. An unqualified opinion means everything the shorts have
speculated about either aren't correct or their effect is not even material enough for the independent auditor's
to make mention of.  
I'd bet dollars to donuts that that'll be the case here.


I'm a practicing CPA & I've seen controllers, internal auditors, etc come and go by the dozens (and dozens).
To assume that an employee's reason for leaving a company is due to some fraudulent activity within the
company is utterly ridiculous. To post this on a financial website is, in my opinion, nothing short of wreckless
and irresponsible.


The most important phase of an independent audit is to access a company's internal control system. Thus,the
CPA firm will ascertain its effectiveness. A short's opinion on this matter is totally biased and subjective ....
Also, as far as lawsuits go, our country has 4% of the world's population and 80% of its lawyers. Anybody can
sue anyone over anything and get sued in return. Just ask Donald Trump.

This article starts off incorrectly with an ill-informed sentence - right at the start. 
"BOFI's troubles date back to March 2015, "


If you look back carefully. The first wave of short attack articles on SA began around Feb '14. Almost a year earlier
than stated by the author.


It is difficult to get old SA articles, but when you do, I am perfectly comfortable pointing their existence out to
everyone. Because those articles have fully and completely been debunked at this point in time. We had all sorts on
nonsense from "going to get crushed under higher rates", to "no HRB merger".


I believe the author dates his BOFI world to March '15 because that is the date of the oldest undebunked short thesis.
Law suits take an outrageously long time to settle. But I have my money that ultimately this particular short thesis
goes the way of all the others.

There were two main risk factors for investors. First one is that there is an alledged ongoing SEC investigation against
BOFI. This risk is now off the table. Second risk is that the arguments against BOFI will go to trial. The way I see it,
today's news reduces the possibility of a trial. Judge will understand that if SEC didn't find a reason to investigate, the
claims are baseless.

Friendly Bear suggested in this article there is an investigation going against bofi " The Probes Reporter also recently
suggested that BOFI is involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which may help explain why audit/compliance

Reading "The Probes Reporter" twitter, they appear to have a personal issue with BOFI for some reason.
Hardly an unbiased source.


If you want to read whatever they wrote about this "undisclosed investigation" a subscription starts at only
$1,187 per year.


Funny how no legitimate news source has reported anything.

second to none and they will reap the benefit and emerge as a leading industry player in this space. Enough to
convince me as I just picked up some of these greatly undervalued shares.


I believe the parties playing their short cards will soon find another place to play.

if Bofi were to start paying a sizable dividend perhaps we could get the shorts to rethink some of their positions. .?

they just need to keep executing. dividend is silly when you can reinvest it tax-free at 17% ROE. not sure
