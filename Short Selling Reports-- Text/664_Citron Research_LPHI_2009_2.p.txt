FOR LIFE PARTNERS
HOLDINGS
SHAREHOLDERS
(NASDAQ:LPHI), IT HAS
BEEN ONE HECK OF A RIDE
– BUT NOW IT IS OVER.


Citron has to give credit where credit is due — CEO
Brian Pardo has truly been a visionary in the life
settlements industry.   Although he has had more
than his share of critics, he has spent the past
decade avoiding regulation while returning
signi�cant returns to LPHI stockholders.


All good things must come to an end, however, and
now the �nal chapter is being written for Life
Partners.  The SEC and Wall St. have decided to
move in on life settlement industry and it is Citron’s
opinion that this sea change will be at the expense
of Life Partners Holdings. Until now the life
settlement industry has been a �nancial product
marred with controversy, but the new task force
and the e�ects of commoditization are going to
change the landscape – dramatically and
permanently.


When you consider the spectrum of opportunities
for abuse in this space, including potential senior
�nancial abuse, the larcenous opportunities
inherent in stranger-owned policies, Ponzi schemes,
independence-compromised life expectancy
medical evaluations, in addition to abusive
commission charges, it’s no surprise that
government regulation is an unavoidable reality.

Background


As an investor, if you know just one thing about
LPHI, that one thing must be a clear understanding
of exactly how it has generated its pro�ts over the
last several years.  As documented in a report
Citron published about LPHI in February 2009, LPHI
acts as a broker in a relatively small number of life
settlement transactions – in which it brings a
transaction between settler(seller) and investors
(buyer) together.  The spreads on its deals are of
unprecedented size in its industry – they are so
exaggeratedly large that these “commissions” are
approaching the average life settlement payout
industrywide.  This is like paying a 50% commission
to sell a house, a business, or a stock!!!


Life Partners has been able to carve out such fat
deals only because its business practice is to
maintain a complete lack of transparency on these
niche transactions.  LPHI recruits investors through
a questionable network of unlicensed investment
marketers (see below), and makes o�ers to settlors
counting on the fact that they can’t access a
transparent market to obtain, and bene�t by, the
price discovery a�orded by multiple o�ers. 
http://citronresearch.com/index.php?
s=LPHI&submit=Search
[http://citronresearch.com/index.php?
s=LPHI&submit=Search]  
Shirking what should have been its �duciary duty to
disclose spreads to both buyers and sellers in its
transactions, Life Partners entire business model is
built on the absence of a transparent market for life
settlements.


If its spreads were even halved, the minimal likely
outcome of the market forces described below,
LPHI’s �nancial performance evaporates like a
puddle on a hot summer day.


Look out, here comes the sheri� !


Just this month we see: 
The SEC has Established Internal Task Force to

Be Careful what you say … because it just
might come back and bite you.


In April, in an attempt to thwart any federal
regulation, Life Partners’ president Scott Peden
pleaded  before Congress to keep government
regulation out of his industry, Peden refers to
sophisticated investors adding liquidity to a market
and not the realities of radio commercials, feeder
funds, and unregulated policy providers that feed
his company’s transactions.

Previously, upon �ghting o� regulation from the
SEC, LPHI CEO Brian Pardo gloated,


“We have consistently maintained that we
are not in the business of securities and,
with little or no justi�cation, the SEC has
doggedly pursued this case over four years
in a blatant attempt to expand its
regulatory turf,” Pardo said. Pardo said he
now believes the SEC will “go back into its
corner”, but “nothing surprises me
anymore when it comes to the SEC, this is
truly an out of control federal agency.”

Citron asks one but pointed question:  What does
LPHI have to hide that makes them act like
regulation is kryptonite to them?  Citron believes it
is the spreads….and the sleight-of-hand by which
they are maintained.

Life Partners has had their share of litigation with
state authorities, and has historically found room to
maneuver in a few states, but the last year has seen
even that door rapidly closing.  In a disturbing act of
silence, Life Partners never disclosed to the
investing public the consent order signed the last
week of July of this year with the Sate of Florida.  No
press release – and no 8-K.  This consent order
restricts LPHI from doing business in Florida, by far
the largest state for life settlements, until is
registers as a Florida Viatical  Provider.  As of this
date, we have no proof that LPHI has even
attempted to register.   Lastly, the consent order
requires LPHI to pay the State of Florida a �ne of
$770,000.  Why no proper disclosure?

Not more than a year ago, Life Partners faced the
same battle in Colorado, who admonished them for
selling policies via radio commercials promising
high returns through unregulated securities
brokers:

Regulation has always been the Achilles heel of Life
Partners, as they have also had previous run-ins
with Utah, Virginia, and Texas.

Government oversight might be the least of
their problems


Until now, Life Partners has been a�orded the
luxury of taking oversize commissions on select
policies.  This is due primarily to the lack of
transparency on their transactions, as there has not

been much of a secondary market for Life
Settlements.  That has just turned around as Wall
St., in particular Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse,
now have established products that put policies
into bonds, exactly like they did with mortgage
backed securities.  In addition, Goldman Sachs has
established a tradable index of life settlements. This
will add the much need liquidity to the Life
Settlement industry and will take the power out of
the hands of these small unregulated operators.

This is how the business used to be:


For years LPHI has used feeder funds type
organizations to funnel investors for their policies. 
As you can tell from the links below, these are not
exactly the Goldman Sachs of the world, rather they
are these unregulated alternative investment �rms
that seem to operate in the grey zone. They run
radio commercials and some represent “risk free
high yield” investments.  These will now be a thing
of the past.  State by state laws will give away to
federal regulation.  Look at the names of some of
the companies to get an idea of who is peddling the
policies to potential investors.  Note how they
invoke the claim of their relationship to Life
Partners:

To illustrate the need for regulation that has �nally
come to this industry we need to look no farther
than the list of companies that supply policies to
Life Partners Holdings.  Citron has obtained a copy
from the State of Texas of the 2008 providers.


2008 LPHI Providers (PDF)
[http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2009/09/2008_lphi_providers.pdf]


Amongst the cast of characters, notice one of the
providers is Life Insurance Settlements in Ft.
Lauderdale Florida.  That company is run by none
other than Stacy Schultz Steinger, the controversial
sister in law of Leslie Steinger, architect of the $1
billion life settlement Ponzi scheme of Mutual
Bene�ts.

Something Just Doesn’t Smell Right


After years of uncovering fraud and failed business,
there are a few red �ags that investors should be
concerned with.  While these are a sideshow with
regard to the inevitable regulation of this industry,
investors ignore them at their own peril


1. CEO Brian Pardo keeps his stock in the tax-haven
county of Gibraltar.  As a matter of fact, the country
of Spain is currently trying to get Gibraltar
blacklisted as it shelters corrupt businesses.  As a
matter of fact, Pardo’s trust shares an address with
some of the more notorious o�shore sports
gambling out�ts.

2. LPHI’s website tell us that they are covered by
two analysts: one being Taglich Brothers, whom
they pay a monthly fee for coverage and Singular
Research.  Life Partners has found it necessary to
announce the coverage of their company by
Singular. 
http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS183715+0
Dec-2008+BW20081205
[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS183715
Dec-2008+BW20081205]


Singular has postured themselves as “independent”
research and has been active in marketing the Life
Partners stock.  
http://seekingalpha.com/article/161763-life-
partners-holdings-inc-in-singular-research-annual-

[http://seekingalpha.com/article/161763-life-
partners-holdings-inc-in-singular-research-annual-
best-of-the-uncovereds-conference-transcript]


But a quick read of the Singular Disclosure shows
that they are not as independent as they appear
but rather they are an a�liate of Millennium Asset
Management run by former stockjock.com
publisher Robert Maltbie.


 http://www.singular-
research.com/about/disclosure.htm
[http://www.singular-
research.com/about/disclosure.htm]


In fact, Maltbie sometimes appears as an analyst
for Singular, and sometimes as an investment
advisor.  Given these facts, Citron believes the
�nancial relationship between itself, Singular,
Millenium has not been fully disclosed.


3. Even LPHI’s auditor has found something funky in
under the sheets.  As stated in their most recent 10-
K:


“Life Partners Holdings, Inc. lacked adequate
�nancial oversight including appropriate
levels of monitoring and review.  Speci�cally,
Life Partners Holdings, Inc. did not have a

systematic procedure for ensuring that the
disclosure and presentation of information in
the �nancial statement footnotes would be
presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United
States of America and the various regulatory
requirements.  Additionally, Life Partners
Holdings, Inc. did not have su�cient
accounting oversight to ensure that the
classi�cation of all �nancial information is
presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.


In addition, Life Partners Holdings, Inc.
lacked adequate internal controls to ensure
the proper accounting treatment and
�nancial reporting for new, emerging or non-
routine business transactions, especially
relating to the accounting for and disclosure
of its various investment activities, most
notably, its investments in life insurance
policies and a limited partnership.”


http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49534/000114
[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49534/00011


This is especially troubling given that, in his last
public company, the SEC �led a complaint against
Mr. Pardo for falsifying �nancial reports to
shareholders.

Conclusion


Citron Research could go on and on about why
LPHI’s �nancials don’t seem to make sense, but that
would just be a sideshow to the main event.  After
our �rst report we received a wave of emails from
industry insiders explaining that Life Partners
operates in the shadows outside the envelope of
standard practice for the rest of the industry – and
Citron believes that game is about to end.  Citron
acknowledges that Mr. Pardo and Life Partners are
no strangers to evading e�orts to regulate them. 
We are not cheerleaders for regulation, but, we are
just calling it like it is.
