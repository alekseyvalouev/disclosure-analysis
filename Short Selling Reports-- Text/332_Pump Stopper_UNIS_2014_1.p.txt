Unilife Corp.: Current Law Enforcement Investigation And Fraud
Allegations From Insider
Apr. 22, 2014 12:53 PM ET64 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Per SEC FOIA request, evidence of an ongoing law enforcement investigation into
Unilife.


UNIS insider document alleging multiple frauds posted publicly in entirety for you to
read.


Court evidence of UNIS’s much-touted partner HIKMA recently losing millions due to
failed partner due diligence along with legal and regulatory involvement. Is UNIS
next?


UNIS shareholders need to understand the UNIS stock pumping scandal could be
“Game Over” imminently for the company.


Fun Fact. Did you know the classic stock fraud movie "Boiler Room" outlines a pump and
dump scam regarding a retractable syringe fraud stock? For those who need a refresher
on the "Boiler Room" movie I strongly suggest you click on this link. It seems trusting
investors have repeatedly been abused by egregiously promotional "retractable syringe"
fraud stocks in the past (completely unrelated to UNIS)*.


Jim Young (from Boiler Room): "There's an important phrase that we use here, and
think it's time that you all learned it. Act as if. You understand what that means? Act
as if you are the fu*#ing President of this firm. Okay? Act as if."


In my opinion, Unilife Corp. (TICKER: UNIS) is "acting as if" it has a viable long-term
business. Much has been said about UNIS and I do not wish to rehash it all, as this is not
meant to be a full report. However, my research has uncovered even more red flags UNIS
shareholders are unaware of and need to comprehend or risk losing all their money. I will
also expand on the implications of a few crucial red flags previously disclosed, which
UNIS shareholders clearly do not understand. Issues explained with all supporting
documentation included, cited and linked.

1. Per SEC FOIA request it appears UNIS is subject to an ongoing law enforcement
investigation.


2. UNIS insider document alleging multiple frauds posted publicly in entirety for you to
read.


3. Even more information on CEO Alan Shortall's involvement with multiple failed
companies.


4. Court evidence of UNIS's much-touted partner HIKMA recently losing millions due
to failed partner due diligence along with legal and regulatory involvement. Is UNIS next?


5. UNIS shareholders need to understand the UNIS stock pumping scandal could be
"Game Over" imminently for the company.


I believe UNIS is in the final innings of a financial disaster as they are forced to take on
debt despite struggling to generate meaningful revenue (let alone positive cash flow) while
serious issues are closing in on UNIS from all sides. With the new large, high cost debt
load from a "loan-to-own" style lender, I expect UNIS shareholders will ultimately be wiped
out with shares trading to $0.0001 (or lower) like UNIS CEO Shortall's past failed
companies.


1. SEC FOIA request: Evidence UNIS is apparently subject of a law enforcement
investigation.


a. This could be absolutely disastrous for UNIS shareholders and I was shocked. Read full
FOIA here, presented for the public's good. I believe there are two possible explanations,
both of which could be disastrous for UNIS shareholders:


i. Potential Explanation 1: This FOIA could be referencing the SEC investigation UNIS
faces, and this indicates to me the investigation is serious because it seems to me to be
STILL ongoing! If the investigation is not ongoing how could releasing documents interfere
with something that has been resolved? Since it seems to me this is still ongoing, also
indicates to me whatever is being investigated could be serious, as the SEC is requiring
extensive time to investigate. If this was regarding some small issue why is it taking
months and still not resolved? In my view, an SEC investigation requiring months of
inquiry and examination could be disastrous when aimed at a company like UNIS.


ii. Potential Explanation 2: Alternately, an even worse explanation is this apparently
ongoing current "law enforcement investigation" is related to some other law enforcement
agency that is not the SEC, which shareholders have no details on. Is the Department of

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2154153-unilife-corp-current-law-enforcement-investigation-and-fraud-allegations-from-insider 3/21


Justice (DOJ) investigating UNIS? What law enforcement agency(ies) could be involved?


Nobody knows the details here and the document states an investigation is not the same
as proof of violations, but one thing is certain in my mind: law enforcement investigations
are typically not good news.


iii. Note: This FOIA was filed and received before UNIS was publicly exposed for
allegedly using anonymous paid stock pumpers directly prior to UNIS insiders
selling $12m of stock via an S-8 filing. Beyond the numerous legal and ethical issues
raised, I believe these allegations are likely to result in even more investigations and
lawsuits. Will UNIS stock get halted by the SEC like other promoted stocks recently? Will
this clearly material issue cause problems with, or repayment of, the recent Orbimed debt
deal or past equity financings?


2. The "must read" whistleblower lawsuit from a UNIS insider alleging multiple
frauds has NOT been dismissed: full document for you to read HERE. If you read
nothing else today, skim pages 5 to 15 of this document to understand what is allegedly
going on "behind the scenes" at UNIS. I believe UNIS shareholders have clearly not read
this crucial document and so I post it for the public good here where you can read it with
one click so you have no excuse if you own UNIS to have not read this.


a. Direct quotes from the suit:


"Another action Unilife took to mislead investors was to run fake production when
investors or customers were visiting the facility. On more than one occasion, scrap
was run through the machines to make it appear that Unilife was making product
when it was not. Product was placed on skids by the warehouse doors to give the
false appearance that product was being packaged and sent to customers when it
was not."


"Failure to comply with the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration," and
"what constitutes mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud, fraud against
shareholders and/or SEC rules and regulation violations."


b. Allegedly, in a meeting with the CEO, VP of business development and VP of finance, a
UNIS internal analysis showed UNIS's cost per syringe would be ~$0.90 per unit
while Sanofi was expected to pay just $0.50-0.55 per unit. (Implying UNIS could
burn even more cash with negative margins!) CEO Shortall apparently told
everyone in the meeting to suppress this analysis. Another internal analysis was

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2154153-unilife-corp-current-law-enforcement-investigation-and-fraud-allegations-from-insider 4/21


ostensibly created showing a cost per unit less than half of the original model. "Mojdeh
(UNIS's COO) directed that Finance exclude certain product overhead expenses to create
the appearance of a more favorable gross margin. Smith was concerned that Mojdeh's
suggestion could be deemed shareholder fraud."


In contradiction to these internal models, a few months later UNIS CEO Shortall
presented to investors to expect profitability with 20% gross margin…


c. UNIS also supposedly falsified documents and test results for FDA validation
processes?


d. Unilife COO Mojdeh allegedly directed an employee to purchase one million Unifill
components per month:


"with the hope that this information would leak to financial markets."


Assuming Talbot did not blatantly imagine this (I do not believe he did), in my opinion this
is an example of stock manipulation while wasting shareholder cash and deliberately
misleading UNIS investors.


3. UNIS CEO Shortall Directly Involved In Many Failed Companies. Investors in
unproven companies are often betting on management even more than the company.
Alan Shortall is one of the worst CEOs I have ever seen, despite burning hundreds of
millions of dollars of shareholder cash with repeated failure: "Shortall has been leading a
ritzy lifestyle, occupying a mansion in beachside Tamarama which rents for $14,000 a
month, has two Mercedes cars and a Bentley." Here is more background on CEO Shortall
I believe is not widely understood.


Read below for more background on Alan Shortall.


a. This document includes examples of employees allegedly facing threats and
intimidation along with UNIS financings including individuals associated with Ponzi
schemes and convicted felons (hat tip Tim321).


i. Read interesting document HERE.


ii. More background on Shortall's history of failure and investor wipeouts.


b. Even the unscrupulous publishers used in Unilife's alleged stock pumping scandal were
seemingly uncomfortable with UNIS and CEO Shortall!!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2154153-unilife-corp-current-law-enforcement-investigation-and-fraud-allegations-from-insider 5/21


"For example, with Unilife, he (Tech Guru) made it clear that CEO Alan Shortall was
a "liar," "a criminal" and a "scumbag." This stands in stark contrast to what he had
written in his Unilife articles,"


"Tech Guru was very uncomfortable writing on Unilife because he said that CEO
Shortall was putting increasing pressure on the writers to write new articles every
week and he wanted ever more grandiose statements "


c. WOW.


4. Unilife's Much Touted HIKMA Partner Recently Lost Millions After Failed Due
Diligence. UNIS shareholders have been led to believe the HIKMA partnership lends
credibility and justifies UNIS as a legitimate company. However, this recent document
shows HIKMA has an embarrassingly bad track record of failing to perform even basic,
independent due diligence on their "partners" and losing millions as a result. Will HIKMA's
partnership with UNIS turn out like the Eagle partnership did? With fraud allegations and
legal action?


a. Full HIKMA lawsuit presented HERE.


b. Apparently, last year HIKMA partnered with "Eagle" and bought a drug from Eagle for
$3.5m then placed orders for more than $2m in raw materials. At this point Eagle was
experiencing internal defect rates "exceeding 90%" that HIKMA seems to have not
uncovered.


c. In my opinion, the most basic independent due diligence on HIKMA's part would have
detected evidence of these blatant internal failures. Furthermore, HIKMA seems to have
blindly accepted Eagle's "significant" sales forecasts that did not materialize. If HIKMA
inspected the facility, or hired an outside consultant for independent verification, how did
HIKMA not recognize production had 90%+ defect rates?! Did HIKMA really invest $3.5m+
without independent verification? Did HIKMA really just accept, at face value, Eagle's
apparently speculative and unreasonably aggressive sales estimates? What kind of due
diligence has HIKMA done on UNIS then?


d. Allegedly, HIKMA also demanded Eagle bring these issues to the FDA, but Eagle
refused, raising legal and ethical questions around HIKMA's new "partner."


e. Eagle also "cherry-picked" samples of the drug for HIKMA, and HIKMA apparently did
not independently verify these.

Does this combination of regulatory issues, unrealistic sales guidance, apparently failing
manufacturing facility and HIKMA's due diligence sound familiar to you? In my opinion,
these issues are remarkably similar to those alleged to be present at Unilife.


5. UNIS Facing Scandalous Allegations of Anonymous Paid Stock Pumpers Prior to
Management and The Company Selling Stock.


a. It is early in this scandal so we can't assume anything but apparently without required
disclosures, potentially in violation of SEC Section 17b and 10b(5), anonymous stock
pumpers "Tech Guru" and "Stock Whisper" were apparently paid to promote UNIS stock.
See article HERE.


At this early stage it is tough to say what will happen and any consequences are
speculative and can't be assumed. There are a wide range of potential outcomes,
financial, legal and regulatory, and I believe the impact could be devastating to UNIS
shareholders. I would like to speculate on a number of potential outcomes and let UNIS
shareholders decide for themselves.


i. "Stock Whisper also wrote on Unilife just 2 weeks before its S8 was filed, allowing
insiders to sell up to $12 million in stock." I am not an attorney but based on my view,
UNIS shareholders seem to have been deceived while UNIS insiders were personally
benefiting to the tune of millions of dollars. While it is too early to be precise and nothing
can be assumed, if this was in violation of SEC section 17b or 10b(5) there could be very
serious consequences. Details HERE.


b. Hat tip to Rick Pearson for some truly incredible work!!


c. UNIS shareholders are missing that this stock pumping shenanigans could be
"Game Over" for UNIS as the legal and financial consequences could be very
severe.


i. UNIS shareholders are underestimating the risk Orbimed could sue UNIS or force
accelerated debt repayment, which could cause UNIS to go bankrupt if they can't raise the
capital to make that payment. Debt investors have to account for the equity value when
analyzing their risk and safety. If the equity value was deliberately inflated why would
Orbimed not feel deceived or manipulated?


ii. What about the people who purchased stock based on these stock pumpers' misleading
"research" while UNIS was selling shares? What kind of legitimate investor is going to
trust and provide UNIS capital in the future? At best, I believe this stock pumping
scandal could make future capital raises for UNIS nearly impossible.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2154153-unilife-corp-current-law-enforcement-investigation-and-fraud-allegations-from-insider 7/21


iii. The SEC regulations provide provisions for return of capital raised if it is concluded
proper disclosures were not followed. Does UNIS have the >$45mm in cash necessary to
pay potential claims should this be proven?


iv. If Orbimed requires debt repayment and UNIS stock gets halted or delisted, I believe
the company could go bankrupt virtually instantly.


d. This creates even more serious problems for UNIS in the future. What legitimate
company will partner with a management team exposed as doing this? Could UNIS
lose important business relationships as partners seek to distance themselves from this
scandal?


Management's Response


I made a strong effort to contact UNIS for a response to these issues I have brought up
but they did not return any of my calls or seem interested in communicating with investors.
I made several attempts to contact UNIS by phone and email, followed by several phone
calls and messages left with both their IR firm as well as on the corporate line over the
past week and a half. In the end I got zero response from UNIS and so was unable to
include their comments or responses.


UNIS CEO Shortall's comments on regarding the state of their manufacturing plant is that
the company's system are "exemplary." Given FDA investigator commentary about
dozens of issues and products falling apart, I question how anyone could believe
"exemplary" is an accurate explanation. When contacted about his past, UNIS CEO
Shortall's response to serious questions is "I think you are being very unfair." However, I
do not see any allegations being refuted with fact? I see a pattern here…


Cut through the hype: FACTS about UNIS


1. SEC FOIA documents show UNIS is the subject to an investigation from law
enforcement agency. FACT.


2. UNIS whistleblower suit NOT dismissed and alleges multiple examples of fraud and
deception. FACT.


3. UNIS's internal financial models allegedly show Sanofi's agreement would have
negative margins (if it ever happens). FACT.


4. FDA recently investigated UNIS's factory and found products literally falling apart with
many issues similar to those raised by the whistleblower. FACT. Details HERE.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2154153-unilife-corp-current-law-enforcement-investigation-and-fraud-allegations-from-insider 8/21


5. UNIS's partner HIKMA has lost millions with a demonstrable track record of poor
partner choice due to insufficient independent due diligence in situations eerily similar to
UNIS. FACT.


6. UNIS CEO has a long history of repeated failures where investors were wiped out.
FACT.


7. UNIS connected to potentially illegal, anonymous stock pumpers before management
sold stock. This could put an end to UNIS if it threatens the Orbimed debt deal or if UNIS
is forced to return capital to investors. FACT.


If we know and can verify the above with public information, what do we NOT know about
what is happening internally at UNIS?! In the context of the above, how could it
possibly be a good sign the latest CFO resigned suddenly without providing
enough notice for UNIS to have a replacement lined up?! UNIS seems to me to be
coming unwound from the inside out, with serious issues on all sides, and the sudden
CFO resignation is a very, very bad sign.


In my view, it seems clear there is going to be a steady stream of increasingly bad news
coming out in the near and medium term future about UNIS. I believe the end for UNIS will
be swift and without notice, leaving investors and traders zero opportunity to avoid instant
large and permanent loss. Given FDA issues, the law enforcement investigation and now
direct evidence of apparently illegal paid stock pumpers, I would not be shocked if UNIS
was halted and/or faced serious legal consequences, leaving anyone holdings UNIS
shares trapped. Alternately, if some of these recent scandals cause capital to be required
to be repaid along with liquidity issues at UNIS, swift bankruptcy could follow. My longer-
term expectation is for eventual bankruptcy either way with UNIS stock declining to
$0.001, or perhaps lower. I believe UNIS needs to clean up its act to "unclog" the US
financial markets.


* I am not saying, insinuating or implying UNIS is a fraud or scam because that is honestly
not what I mean to express. Readers can make up their own minds. Boiler Room is a
classic movie.


Disclosure: I am short UNIS. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Agree, Hack... and with this very fine article by Pump Stopper. I exited UNIS stock in mid-March over their
'onerous slug of debt' and keystone cop antics. Luckily got out w/ a 20% gain, but it certainly could have been
ugly.


Shareholders should reconsider their positions in my view, particularly after this article's many points of eye-
opening and informative analysis.

This fine article reminds me that the actual loan agreement with Orbimed was never filed as an 8-K; the company only
filed a general description of it without any of the covenants or milestones that need to be achieved in order to be able
to borrow the second and third tranches. Nor do we know what constitutes a "game over for UNIS" default.

Your “documentation” is laughable! 
“Read full FOIA here” - The SEC response uses standard legal language neither confirming nor denying an
investigation is taking place. It basically says nothing.


“whatever is being investigated could be serious, as the SEC is requiring extensive time to investigate. In my view, an
SEC investigation requiring months of inquiry and examination could be disastrous when aimed at a company like
UNIS.” - So, just for the sake of argument, let’s say they are being investigated. Here’s what happens. The feds
descend, fill there trucks with boxes, and drive away. If they’re not busy working other cases, you might hear back
from them in about 3 years. I’ve seen it happen. No charges were ever filed. Not even an apology.


“With the new large, high cost debt load from a "loan-to-own" style lender” - Let’s see, just like the one Theravance
(partnered with GSK) made recently?


“4. FDA recently investigated UNIS's factory and found products literally falling apart with many issues similar to those
raised by the whistleblower. FACT. Details HERE.” 
- You provided a link to an article by the Streetsweeper? That’s some serious documentation there.


All you’ve done in bundle the same retread material that shorts have been hawking for over a year. What’s truly
amazing is that people reacted to this article as if it contained anything newsworthy. Congrats on contributing to the
mid-day price decline. AH it is ticking back up.

Here's my favorite line from tonight's press release:


>>The CFO's departure was not due to a resignation but part of a long-term succession plan.<< 
http://yhoo.it/1gPR1HI


And then here's the language from the press release announcing his departure:


>>Unilife Appoints Dennis Pyers as Interim CFO - Company Begins Active Executive Search for New CFO...
Interested CFO candidates are invited to contact Ms. Cynthia Lighty, Vice-President of Human Resources<< 
http://1.usa.gov/1gPQXrr


Lol, that's quite a "long-term succession plan"!

polite way of saying CFO wasn't good enough. he didn't quit. he hasn't found a new job yet. nothing unusual
for company's entering into a new commercial phase.

Lol the press release refuted nothing. Unilife is under a current investigation by a law enforcement agency, the foia is
very clear. Call the sec and ask if you have doubts.


The company can issue all the press releases it wants, the debt plus ongoing investigations mean this turd is going
down in flames.

Unilife's press release failed to address my issue with this article which was calling "Boiler Room" a classic

Please note that the above statement does not mean that I do not own a DVD copy of "Boiler Room." It just
means that I do not consider it a classic.

Thanks for the link and now a question: Can you point to one other long term succession plan for a CFO
where the CFO left and not only was a full time replacement not known at the time, but they were asking for
those interested in the position to send in a resume?


23 Apr 2014, 10:54 AM


JonDonson
cfo didn't leave. he was let go. wasn't good enough and he has no job. grasping at straws here.


23 Apr 2014, 10:59 AM


silence_twain
How would that qualify as long term succession planning then?


23 Apr 2014, 12:37 PM


JonDonson
"we need a better cfo for the future" what else do you call it? and who really cares. this isn't what shorts
should be harping on. hugely irrelevant.


23 Apr 2014, 02:06 PM


ikarus
How is it irrelevant that the CFO quit right after the company entered an abusive loan-to-own debt agreement with a
sharky hedge fund? Unilife basically guaranteed its own bankruptcy. This is the major reason the stock is such a
compelling short now -- before, UNIS could rehash old and inconsequential contracts through redundant press
releases, but now they have debt.


The death knell for pump stocks is when they're forced to take debt because they can no longer sell equity. The
Orbimed deal was shockingly bad in a 1% LIBOR environment when the market is enthusiastically willing to float even
the worst of the worst possible equity deals (e.g., PLUG). The problem with debt is that it's real even after the "stories"
of future contracts evaporate into nothingness. Debt kills zero revenue companies.


23 Apr 2014, 02:13 PM


JonDonson
i'm sorry you still think the cfo quit. you should call the company to get educated on the new search.


if unis goes bankrupt, it won't be because of the orbimed deal. interest only until 2020 and the interest is
about $1 million per quarter.


23 Apr 2014, 02:24 PM


ikarus
When has the company ever told the truth? Try to be honest with yourself here.

Looks like they are paying the ex CFO:


$245K cash + $98K bonus + accelearted vesting of 115K restricted stock (call it $400K) plus he gets to keep 22K
options. Call it $800K plus some options.


So what does the company get? A general release and:


"In addition, Mr. Wieland has agreed to abide by certain confidentiality, non-disparagement and non-solicitation
covenants. "

Sounds like bribe money to me. People who are fired don't get generous severance packages.

YOU'RE getting desperate. I'm making money as the stock is now down 40% from its high and is going to
zero.

people who quit don't get severance.


23 Apr 2014, 03:16 PM


JonDonson
orbimed deal will not lead to bankruptcy. of all the short arguments, this one is the dumbest.


interest only deal with a tiny $1 million/quarter servicing. debt principle comes due in 2020. so if the shorts are correct,
then orbimed is the dumbest fund around because they will take control of a worthless fraudulent company in 2020
and won't even get their principle repaid.


unilife is in bed with astra zeneca, sanofi, orbimed, hikma etc . all of whom are out millions if unilife folds. i'm pretty
sure those guys know this industry better than random bloggers on seeking alpha.

We haven't seen the covenants in the loan. There are likely balance sheet tests, and possibly performance
tests. These types of loans generally aren't "covenant lite".


24 Apr 2014, 09:24 AM


silence_twain
I remember when people criticized another random blogger on UNXL and claimed that Dell and Kodak knew
more about UNXL than that random blogger. How did that work out for UNXL shareholders? The money that
Sanofi and others have given UNIS, is a drop in the ocean compared to their balance sheet cash numbers. If
things do not go UNIS's way (and I think UNIS will ultimately fail), those big pharma names won't miss the
cash.

i doubt there is anything meaningful beyond the royalty arrangement. we'll see when the q/k comes out.

There are only a handful of things you need to know about Unilife:


1) They have a lot of debt and no revenue


2) The only people supporting Unilife are low comment trolls who only post on Unlife threads and spread incorrect
facts; meanwhile, the company was exposed for using paid touts on SeekingAlpha


3) There is a current law enforcement investigation into Unilife


That's it. End of story. Stock to zero.


24 Apr 2014, 11:21 AM


JonDonson
low comment troll? oh c'mon. i have tremendous respect for short sellers (look at my comment history on other
companies, brief as it is). in this case, you're going to be waiting a long long time before stock ever goes to zero.


24 Apr 2014, 11:37 AM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  In my opinion, while it could happen nearly instantly, it may take some time for UNIS to go to
zero too. I can imagine a "bull case" where, instead of going to $0, UNIS trades in a tight range of perhaps
$0.0012 to $0.0014. This could be the upside case for current investors.

All I say is good luck to all.


24 Apr 2014, 02:27 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
I was going to write an article on this but don't have the time. Anyone looking for details on the Orbimed financing can
look to a near-identical financing they did with another public company, Bacterin (ticker BONE). Bacterin took the high
road and appended the entire agreement to the 8-K:


http://bit.ly/1fbdV0K


It's Exhibit 10.25 to the 8-K. You can see the terms and structure are almost identical to the Unilife deal, so it is
extremely likely that the terms and covenants that UNIS has not disclosed yet will be similar, and UNIS has alluded to
their existence (e.g. the UNIS 8-K mentions "covenants relating to financial performance").


In particular the negative covenants on pages 40-48 are of interest.


The deal calls for minimum revenue targets in each quarter beginning right after they sign the loan (this makes sense
as it is linked to a separate royalty agreement). And the revenue escalates.


They don't hit the targets, and they are in default.


And if in default the lender can turn the screws. In the case of Bacterin they have missed their targets and have had to
amend and get covenant waivers a total of 6 times with Orbimed (pretty much every quarter), with Orbimed extracting
goodies along they way. For example last in the 6th amendment, they had to issue 1.5 million shares to Orbimed. In
the second amendment they extracted a 2% fee. In the first amendment they extracted a 1.5% fee. Not sure about the
others. 
Bacterin only missed it's targets by a minor amount.


This is for the folks that dismiss the potential problem of the Orbimed debt as "only $1M per quarter". Whatever
escalating revenue targets that are in the loan had better be met or it will become a big problem quickly. These guys
aren't in it for LIBOR + 9% - if they aren't getting the juice from the royalty side the will just have to squeeze it
elsewhere.


As a final aside, and perhaps it's nothing in the two other disclosed deals that Orbimed has done in their royalty fund
(Bacterin and privately-held Omniguide), the press releases had nice quotes from the Orbimed guys about how
excited they are about the company and are "very pleased, etc. etc.


http://bit.ly/1fbdWSw


"We are very pleased to partner with OmniGuide and offer a non-dilutive capital solution to help the company deliver
advanced energy solutions in a surgical setting,” said Tadd Wessel, a Managing Director on the Royalty Opportunities
team. “OmniGuide has made substantial progress with the commercialization of their products in ENT and we look
forward to working with Scott and his team to help the company achieve its full potential,” added Matthew Rizzo, also
a Managing Director on the Royalty Opportunities team."

No such love for UNIS.

Or you could just call Orbimed and ask. They were willing to talk to me. I still believe this is a loan-to-own deal
that is going to zero.


People who are long this company don't do any due diligence, that's quite obvious. The debt is real though
and will remain real even after stories about revenue growth evaporate yet again.


Nice work though, thanks for posting the BONE comments.

>>and if the Q shows no sales or balance sheet covenants? i assume you'll responsibly highlight this major

I put the chance of that as zero. This is a royalty deal first and foremost. The odds of them not putting sales
minimums in a royalty deal is zero. Especially when UNIS has also alluded to "covenants relating to financial
performance".

In November last year, a securities fraud class action lawsuit was filed in a Pennsylvania federal court against Unilife
Corp and certain of its officers, seeking to recover damages as a result of alleged violations of federal securities laws.

The complaint filed in that case alleged that throughout the relevant period of time, the company and its officers made
false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company. Former
Unilife employee Talbot Smith and his case against Unilife feature in the securities fraud complaint.


In January, Unilife announced the securities fraud case was voluntarily dismissed by the shareholder plaintiff. I look
forward to any result in the Smith case with interest.

PS: it may be this SA article (as well) which is referred to in this news segment, the day following publication of this
piece; the segment is entitled "Unilife slams malicious blogs & short sellers": http://bit.ly/R4fgLP


30 Apr 2014, 04:07 PM


ikarus
It might just be me, "Guy who is bound by facts and hard numbers," but I'm pretty sure Unilife is the one who
got slammed. The stock is down and has been trading weak since the report, and even more negative
information has come to light about the company and its management team.


Saying that Unilife "slammed" short sellers is kind of like saying Unilife has important contracts that are about
to produce hockey stick revenue, and I think most of us know that's clearly not true.

It is very frustrating that the market gets so spooked by the comments made by those who have been shorting UNIS
and making money from those who are scared off. My recommendation is to read more informed reports e.g. Griffin
Securities, which are regulated. Ignore the unregulated comments - their days are definitely getting short ! :-) :-)


13 May 2014, 09:35 PM


ikarus
lol Griffin wants to be the underwriter, they are literally the worst possible source of comments


The stock didn't react negatively to message board chatter on SeekingAlpha, the stock reacted negatively
because UNIS put up a terrible quarter.


13 May 2014, 11:31 PM


B_Banzai
I thought the UNIS management team handled themselves well in the QR telecon yesterday. I heard lots of positives: 
- Deliberately avoiding competing in commodity markets (insulin syringes) 
- Long term contracts (the "Annuity" analogy is a bit of a stretch, but nevertheless) 
- 60 M unit manufacturing capacity with growth to several 100 M in 2015-2016 time frame projected. 
- Debt financing has added credibility with potential customers 
- $22 M revenue so far this year

- A reasonable capital expenditure plan 
Of course the Q&A's were softball set-ups in most cases (as is typical).


But, alas, whereas I saw positives, the rest of the market was disappointed and walked, likely due to the lack of
transparency in the sources of revenue, and lack of identified new customers. As a point of reference, AGEN has 16
undisclosed Phase 2 partnered programs. So UNIS is not alone in "holding their cards close to the vest".

Where's the revenue???? The market is tired of hearing stories. No one cares anymore. Unilife will be
bankrupt within 12 months unless they start generating some revenue.


Blah, blah, blah SHOW ME THE REVENUE.


13 May 2014, 11:32 PM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I did not hear anything that changes my view in the call. Without meaningful revenue they
will go bankrupt. My medium term price target is still $0.0002 per share for UNIS but I do acknowledge that
the stock could also go much much lower.


14 May 2014, 12:05 AM

I stand corrected: "Generated $22.6 million in cash receipts from customers" (not "revenue"). Advanced
payments are better than no payments. Still long.

Logical Thought, Contributor
Notice that the 10Q redacted (i.e., "hid") all the financial metrics required by the new lender in order not to be in
default, including what's required to get the next two tranches of the loan.

14 May 2014, 09:47 AM


Keubiko, Contributor
Yes, but as I posted above the Bacterin deal shows the type of thing royalty lenders expect. They expect a
fast, near-immediate revenue ramp or the company will be in default and the lenders start extracting goodies
(in the upside scenario - in the downside scenario they assert their security).

That whole conference call was one long incoherent ramble. They would get asked a question and then go off on
some tangent. Did you pick up how many times they talked about TAM? When you have nothing good to say people
always talk about TAM because they are trying to convince you that if they can just get a small percentage of a large
market that they will do well. Problem is getting that small percentage is much harder than they make it seem. For
instance, my square tire business still has no share in the large tire market. I can't even get people to look at them
(Note: I don't have a square tire business, but if you want to fund one, let me know.)


I also thought I was going to be charged a two drink minimum during the part of the call where UNIS talked about how
what great innovators they are and people come to them because the big guys refuse to help them. Maybe someone
like BD turns a company away because the product they want can't be made, it can be made but not profitably, or a
product needs to be specifically made for something where only a small amount of syringes in total is needed. I am
sure UNIS is willing to take on these projects for upfront payments because they need the cash. Maybe if I give UNIS
money upfront, they will develop my square tire.


14 May 2014, 10:13 AM

Nice analogy, but you have it backwards. BD is selling ice. UNIS is selling refrigerators.

Former Employee Issues Apology and Withdraws Whistleblower Lawsuit


YORK, Pa., Aug. 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Unilife Corporation (NASDAQ: UNIS and ASX: UNS), a developer,
manufacturer and supplier of injectable drug delivery systems, today announced that a former employee has agreed
to dismiss all of his claims against the Company and has issued a public apology for bringing his claims. The case,
Talbot Smith v. Unilife Corp. et al, No. 13-CV-05101, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, has been dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.


The former employee issued the following apology while dismissing the case: "I would like to correct issues arising
from claims I brought against Unilife. I now understand that there were no violations of FDA regulations during my
tenure at Unilife. In addition, in the summer of 2011, Unilife issued press releases which stated that they had begun

employees."


John Ryan, Unilife's Senior Vice President and General Counsel stated, "From the outset Unilife has asserted that Mr.
Smith's claims were entirely without merit and unfairly damaging to our Company and our shareholders. We are
grateful to our attorneys, Carolyn Short and her colleagues at Reed Smith LLP, for their tireless work and this positive
outcome. The Reed Smith team expertly uncovered the facts, showing Mr. Smith's claims to be meritless, and we are
of course pleased with this result. We are also pleased that in addition to apologizing to Unilife, Mr. Smith agreed to
make a payment to the Company to settle our claims against him, that he received no payment as part of the
resolution and dismissal, and that his attorney received only a small portion of her fees from our insurer. With this
case now behind us, we look forward to focusing our resources fully on the growth of our business."
