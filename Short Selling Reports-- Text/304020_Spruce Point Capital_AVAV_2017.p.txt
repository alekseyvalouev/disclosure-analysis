Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Issues “Strong Sell” Opinion on 
AeroVironment, Sees 30%-50% Downside


AeroVironment (Nasdaq: AVAV) is a defense contractor that sells small unmanned aircraft systems (“UAS”) –
colloquially known as drones – to the US and allied governments (~90% of its business) and also operates an 


unrelated business tied to electric-vehicle charging (“EES” ~10% of business). Our fundamental and forensic research 
suggests looming disappointment and 30% - 50% downside ($24 - $34 per share).


AVAV’s Recent Outperformance Makes Little Fundamental Sense And Partially Fueled By Excessive ETF Buying:
A perennial underperformer in the market, AVAV has almost doubled in 2017 despite management’s recent reiteration of revenue 
and earnings guidance that call for little growth. AVAV trades at the highest valuation multiples in its history and at 2-3x the multiples 
of defense-industry peers – despite the fact that it has produced no sustained revenue or FCF growth over its history, has not 
undergone any fundamental transformation, and earnings visibility declines every year. We believe AVAV’s price surge has been
fueled by billion-dollar inflows into the fastest growing ETF ROBO, which at one point had AVAV as its #1 holding. We think ETF 
restrictions will limit additional share purchases, and sales may occur as we question AVAV’s compliance with their ESG policy


AVAV’s Drones Fail In Real-World Conditions; Its Technology And R&D Have Fallen Behind: While hope springs eternal that 
AVAV will one day broaden its horizons by selling its drones to businesses and not militaries, the market has overlooked the evidence 
that its drones work poorly even for military uses. An internal Department of Defense document released via FOIA request shows that 
one of AVAV’s key products “did not meet key performance parameters,” calling into question its usefulness in actual combat. 
Problems included poor landing accuracy (with a 44% failure rate), an inability to cope with high winds (a feature that was supposed 
to be designed into the product), and an unexpectedly heavy and fragile carrying case. Military test operators used words like 
“chintzy,” “cumbersome,” and “horrible” to describe AVAV’s drones. Other real-world users speak of routine crashes and other 
shortcomings, using harsh language (“even in training they f***g sucked,” “that thing really was a piece of s**t”). When the Ukrainian 
military received AVAV drones as aid from the US in 2016, it quickly abandoned them, citing poor performance including susceptibility 
to enemy jamming. We believe complaints about AVAV’s product fundamentally stem from its stale technology. R&D staffing and 
capex as a percentage of sales have declined over the years, while staffing for overhead functions has grown, giving a picture of a 
bloated company not committed to the cutting edge and a vehicle to enrich mgmt. For a decade, AVAV has made very few changes 
to its product line-up, with only one significant new model in the past five years. Meanwhile, it has wandered into several major 
technological dead ends, including an overpriced vertical-takeoff drone and two larger, higher-altitude drones that have failed to drum 
up any actual contracts. These failures are quietly swept under the rug through frequent revisions to what AVAV actually says it does


AVAV Nearly Identical To Our iRobot Short, Another Over-Hyped Play On A Laggard In Its Industry: Spruce Point conducted 
an extensive evaluation of AVAV, and find it to be a nearly identical stock promotion to iRobot. AVAV is being hyped as a play on 
drones, but its products are stagnant and being out-innovated by peers. Like iRobot, we find: 1) Foolish stock promoters, including a 
former one tied to a notorious Ponzi scheme,  2)  Poor governance + unjust insider enrichment, 3) Continuous insider selling,
4) Poor capital allocation, 4) Frequent accounting errors + warranty revisions, and 5) Nonsensical and distorted valuation

Spruce Point “Strong Sell” Opinion on 
AeroVironment, Sees 30%-50% Downside


AVAV Faces Poor Industry Dynamics In Both Its Businesses: In the drone/UAS business, hype about commercial drone 
adoption has begun to fizzle, with competitors like 3D Robotics, Parrot, Autel, and Yuneec all going through layoffs or closing.
No one has been able to make a dent in the leading position of DJI, a Chinese drone manufacturer known for high-quality and 
relatively inexpensive products. VC funding has also begun to dry up. Meanwhile, in the military market, FLIR and Boeing have
both just acquired small competitors of AVAV’s, aiming to expand the reach of their technologies, while another small competitor
has started to sell spare parts for AVAV’s own products to the US gov’t – all signs of greater competition. The notion that AVAV
has a long runway of growth in int’l markets is belied by the tiny relative size of non-US military spending, and, even as new int’l 
customers do come on board, the growth is not sustainable since military drones are durable and don’t need to be re-purchased 
routinely. In the long run, the US military will work toward using cheaper commercial drones, a negative for margins
 In AVAV’s electric-vehicle charging business (~10% of gross profit), there is little to distinguish its products in a crowded 


market with few barriers to entry. Product reviewers see no standout benefits to its offerings, and large companies like GE 
have already exited the market. Despite working on EV charging for years, AVAV’s business and margins have shrunk


Terrible Capital Allocation and Governance Echoed By Undisclosed Whistleblower Complaint: If the fact that AVAV is on 
its fourth CFO since coming public doesn’t concern investors, then perhaps an undisclosed whistleblower lawsuit will. AVAV’s 
former VP of Strategic Operations – an announced executive hire – accused it of fraudulently obtaining gov’t reimbursement for 
costs connected to the non-military EV-charging business. He alleged that “false billings” cost the gov’t tens of millions of dollars. 
Such misdeeds would be consistent with AVAV’s past issues, including a DoJ investigation of its billing practices, an unexplained 
recent lapse in approvals from the Defense Contract Management Agency, and unexplained violations of State Dept. export 
restrictions. Recent insider behavior to change bonus targets to extract incentive bonuses is even more distasteful in light of its 
squandered opportunity cost with excess capital (AVAV doesn’t acquire, buyback stock or pay a dividend). This behavior exists
while AVAV’s audit fees have been rising to new highs ever since the complaint and adoption of an equity clawback in 2013  


Stock Promotion Runs Deep At AVAV, Valuation Can Correct 30%-50% As Disappointment Looms Large:
Insiders have consistently sold shares (47% post IPO to 11% ownership currently), while a laundry list of rogue brokers have 
relentless pumped AVAV since its IPO (remember Stanford Financial or Jesup & Lamont?). Also don’t be Fooled when Mr. 
Motley says “buy” - recall they have also relentlessly promoted iRobot. True to form, AVAV has exhibited terrible FCF generation
and margins, high management turnover, unwillingness to engage activist investors, and limited long-term share price upside 
until recent ETF buying. Even typically optimistic sell-side analysts don’t currently recommend AVAV, with zero buy ratings and 
an average price target of $40 (implying 17% downside). AVAV’s current peak valuation of approximately 3x and 30x 2018E 
Sales and EBITDA will eventually normalize with defense industry peers and with its own historic valuation. As a result, we see 
30%-50% downside in its share price, or $24 to $34 per share, representing a terrible risk/reward

Aerovironment Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) ROBO ETF


Beware of AVAV’s Rapid
Share Price Outperformance


AVAV’s share price has recently exploded post appointment of new management team, heavy ETF buying, but 
little fundamental change or new product development. AVAV has a history of disappointment, particularly 
because its low earnings visibility, analyzed later in the report, has declined nearly every year (1). The CEO 


recently tempered expectations for FY 2018 after Q1 results in August. Certain one-off benefits and easy 
comps from FY 2017 make recent growth results appear stronger than normal.


March 2017: Q3 results 
of ($0.09) beat by $0.15 
“order flow increases our 
full year visibility”


Aug 2017: Q1’18 results 
show a loss of ($0.19)
beating by $0.15, issues 
inline 2018 guidance


June 2017: Q4 EPS results 
of $1.30; “record results, 
successful execution”


Dec 2016: CFO Teresa 
Covington appointed


April 2016: New CEO 
Nawabi appointed


Nov 2016: “Launches 
Integrated Commercial 
Information Solution”


Q4’17, June 2017: “As Teresa described moments ago, our total visibility for fiscal 2018 is now 
41%, the same as this time last year.” - CEO Nawabi  (See Slide How Visibility Used To Be 80%)


Q1’18, Aug 2017:  “The reason I caution about the full year is primarily because this is only the 
first quarter and we got three more quarters to go number one.” - CEO Nawabi


“I can appreciate the tax benefit maybe it looks like about a nickel in the quarter if my math is 
correct. Obviously maintaining the full year EPS guidance implies significantly down EPS in the 
next three quarters relative to last year even with better revenues”  - Analyst Herbert

AeroVironment’s Drones Fail in 
Real-World Conditions

U.S. Government Watchdog Lambastes 
A Key AeroVironment Product 


 In a 2015 document originally designated “For Official Use Only” but unearthed via Freedom of 
Information Act request, the U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) examined six 
Special Operations equipment programs for compliance with a range of rules and standards
 The AECV (All Environment Capable Variant) UAS program, which houses AVAV’s Puma AE 


product, was the only program found to be deficient
 The IG noted that AVAV’s product “did not meet key performance parameters…during 


operational testing”
 According to the IG, the shortcomings identified in initial testing “call into question the 


usefulness of the [AVAV drone] in an actual deployed environment”
 The IG pointedly asked “whether the current capabilities of the AECV systems are sufficient to fulfill 


its mission and whether the current capabilities represent a significant increase in performance to 
justify the acquisition of the AECV”
 In other words, the drones likely weren’t worth their hefty price tag


 In short, the Department of Defense’s own internal watchdog concluded that AVAV’s drones “may 
not be able to fulfill their mission”


You don’t need to take Spruce Point’s word that AVAV’s products are challenged.
Unearthed government documents point to its product challenges.

Military Personnel Vent About AVAV Drones


 A recent Reddit thread centered on a humorous video of a high-end military drone – likely an AVAV Raven –
embarrassingly crashing elicited interesting commentary from individuals with experience with AVAV products
 Anecdotal, but consistent with damning Inspector General report (which focused on the Puma, not the 


Raven – implying problems throughout AVAV’s product line)


• unreliable
• poorly 


designed
• dangerous


 An earlier thread included a similar comment about an AVAV Puma: “we used them in Afghanistan. They are silly 
expensive like 250k. We spent hours and hours looking for them when they went down, which they did often.”

AVAV’s Drone Lineup Has Been Stagnant 
For Many Years


 Historical 10-K disclosures reveal that AVAV’s products and its capabilities have largely stagnated or, in some 
cases, deteriorated over the past decade
 Weight, range, and flight times are largely unchanged, despite huge improvements made over the same period 


in the broader UAV and electronics industries

Abandoned Shrike Product Highlights 
AVAV’s Struggles With Innovation


 The Shrike – a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) drone – was touted by AVAV as a major opportunity 
for years


• December 2011: “Shrike VTOL…brings to our small UAS family a highly capable platform…[W]e 
have planted a stake in the emerging public safety UAS market, one that could become 
meaningful in the future…”


• March 2012: “customers are providing positive reinforcement that these platforms [Digital Wasp 
and Shrike] will eventually see meaningful adoption”


• September 2012: “We continue to receive promising feedback on Shrike, our new VTOL solution, 
and believe that it will become a more significant contributor to UAS revenue”


• June 2015: “The Army defined a new micro UAS as part of its system requirement and our Shrike 
vertical takeoff and landing or VTOL solution is well positioned for that requirement”


• June 2016: “Our Shrike VTOL could potentially satisfy the short range micro-UAS requirements.”
 …but Shrike never again mentioned on AVAV earnings calls, with no explanation provided
 Shrike mentioned in FY2012, FY2013, FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016 10-K’s but dropped in FY2017 –


again, with no explanation provided
 Many references to Shrike scrubbed from AVAV web site (redirecting to other pages)
 Spruce Point discussion with former AVAV employee revealed that Shrike was far too expensive given 


current widespread availability of similar electric quadcopters
 Shrike designed to be a “cool demo” but wasn’t reliable, easy to manufacture, or to maintain
 Product was never competitive
23


Third-Party Analysis Confirms AVAV’s “Absurd” 
Pricing, Weak Value Proposition


By 2011 standards, the Shrike was absolute leading edge technology…it has not aged well.


All the Shrike’s EO cameras have digitally stabilized 5MP sensors, which is antiquated by 
current standards.


…[T]he Shrike has a civil variant known as the Qube which is marketed exclusively for public 
safety applications. Unfortunately the high system cost puts the Qube (as well as other military 
systems adapted for civil use) out of financial reach for all but the largest public safety agencies.  
Even then, the value to the taxpayer is questionable given the highly advanced state of 
commercial multirotor technology.


There have been incredible leaps in technology since the Shrike was conceived in 2007, but the 
price tag has not followed suit. In fact I’m of the opinion that the cost of a Shrike/Qube is absurd 
for civil use, especially considering the superiority of commercial EO sensors. Even the $500 
entry level DJI Phantom 3 Standard’s camera crushes AeroVironment’s top EO payload option…


A graduate student studying unmanned aircraft systems recently wrote a brief essay on VTOL drones, 
including AVAV’s, in which he came down hard on AVAV:

AVAV Has a Long History of Fruitless R&D


 Global Observer: large UAV designed for high-altitude operation
• Designed in partnership with the US Dept. of Defense and Homeland Security beginning in 2007
• Management suggested that Global Observer could ultimately double the company’s revenue*
• However, the first prototype aircraft tested crashed in 2011; interest evaporated
• 2013 Wired report:


• Still no commercial traction today despite continued optimistic noises from management
 TERN: joint program between Navy and DARPA to create UASs to be launched from ships


• Sep. 1, 2015: management touts projects like TERN as “huge growth opportunities…with high 
returns on invested capital”


• 21 days later: DARPA rejects AVAV’s proposal, goes with Northrop Grumman instead

Meanwhile, in Its Core Military Market, 
AVAV Is Facing Growing Competition


 In November 2016, FLIR Systems (a $6B publicly traded company focused on thermal 
imaging) acquired Prox Dynamics for $134 million:


• Prox is “a leading developer and manufacturer of nano-class unmanned aerial 
systems (UAS) for military and para-military intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance”


• Prox directly competes with AVAV, and its Black Hornet nano-drone has already 
been used by the militaries of 19 NATO-allied countries, including the US, UK, 
Australia, Germany, and Norway


• FLIR management has spoken enthusiastically about combining Prox’s “very, very 
differentiated” product with FLIR’s existing military sales channels and established 
brand to stimulate much greater adoption – directly threatening AVAV


 A small competitor, Altavian, has become the #2 provider of small-UAS components to 
the military, including components for AVAV’s own Raven and Puma products:


• “We offer you unbeatable prices, saving your office money without sacrificing 
experience and quality”


• In the past several years the US military “has been focused on breaking away from” 
AVAV as its sole source for UAS

Recent Boeing And Intel Acquisition 
Further Highlights AVAV’s Irrelevance


 In January 2016, Intel announced the acquisition of Ascending Technologies, a drone company based 
in Krailing, Germany. 
 Intel described Ascending as having “best-in-class” auto-pilot software and algorithms
 Illustrates the growing value of software vs. hardware in drone development


 In October 2017, Boeing announced plans to acquire Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, which 
“specializes in autonomous systems technologies to enable advanced robotic aircraft” and is “a leader 
in...electric propulsion”


• Focus on electrically powered unmanned air vehicles similar to AVAV; also similar employee 
counts (Aurora >550, AVAV 661)


• Deal terms not disclosed
• In the past, Aurora has competed for DARPA contracts with AVAV but appears to have been 


more focused on cutting-edge R&D
 AVAV has a developed sales organization but stale technology; M&A has focused on marrying state-


of-the-art technology with existing sales organizations:
• Large companies not interested in what AVAV has to offer
• Spruce Point discussions with former AVAV employees indicated that larger military contractors 


to date are uninterested in small-UAS niche because there wasn’t a lucrative enough opportunity


If AVAV’s technology were really as good as its nosebleed valuation implies, why would 
multibillion dollar companies such as FLIR Systems, Intel, and Boeing buy up smaller 


competitors instead of just acquiring AeroVironment?

International Growth Prospects Limited 
By Low Non-US Military Spending


 AVAV has increased its international business mix in recent years (5% of revenue in 2007 vs. 
36% in 2017), but, over the long term, the US’s military spending dwarfs that of all allied 
nations, constraining the potential upside

Drone Durability Makes Revenue Lumpy 
And Non-Recurring: Pop And Drop


AVAV drones may crash frequently when in use, but they are rugged enough to last for years 
 Thus, after an initial stock-up phase, customers don’t need to buy new drones every year
 This dynamic will make sustained international revenue growth difficult over time, as any new military 


clients complete their initial buys and demand quickly drops off
 AVAV’s experience with the US government illustrates this phenomenon: based on Spruce Point 


analysis of the Federal Procurement Data System, US procurements of drone hardware peaked in 
2010-11 and have fallen ever since

The Israeli Defense Forces Are Using Low-Cost, 
Off-The-Shelf Civilian Drones for Surveillance


 The Israeli press reported earlier this year that by the end of 2017, “every IDF company commander 
in the ground forces will be the proud owner of a new collapsible drone to assist in intelligence 
gathering”
 Drones manufactured by DJI, far and away the leader in retail and commercial drones
 “The drones are not military-grade. In fact, for about 1,000 bucks you too can be the proud 


owner of the same kind of drone as an IDF combat company” (source: Times of Israel)
 Even after the US military warned against informal use of DJI drones, the Israeli Defense Forces 


confirmed they would still use them (though not yet for classified operations)
 Shows confidence in the platform


 Israeli view that non-military-grade drone technology is still “way ahead” of legacy military technology 
like the kind that AVAV sells –- all at a price of thousands vs. hundreds of thousands of dollars –
underscore the industry’s long-term deflationary dynamics
 With AVAV’s drones orders of magnitude more expensive than off-the-shelf alternatives, the 


company will either lose all of its business over time or face massive price compression


“The civilian drones are way ahead of us, and we don’t want to get stuck behind, 
so we’re using the most advanced technologies we can.”

AVAV’s Charging Products Are 
Unexceptional


 A recent in-depth analysis of the best EV charging stations on the market (produced by 
The Wirecutter, a New York Times-owned electronics review site) illustrates AVAV’s 
weak market position
 The #1-ranked product was manufactured by Siemens
 #2: eMotorWerks JuiceBox (a mainstay of Amazon’s best-seller list)
 While one AVAV product (the TurboCord Dual) was rated “Also Great,” the reviewer 


noted several important flaws:
 “charges more slowly than our other picks”
 Niche appeal at best: “If you plan to stop at a school or the house of someone 


who has a well-equipped [wood or metal] shop…this might be the cord for you”
 Another AVAV product received an even more tepid review: 


 Cheapest model offers short cable, no wall plug, low amperage, “yet it costs 
more than either of our top picks”


 “We don’t think it’s a bad charger; we just don’t think it’s worth the money”
 The Wirecutter assessed “over 70 charging stations” in devising its recommendation


 Demonstrates commoditization of the market – huge array of very similar options from 
a wide range of vendors


 Not conducive to long-term profitability even if EVs become more popular
 (Note: Tesla offers its own chargers, which, unlike AVAV’s, do boast unique technology)

AVAV Has A History of 
Compliance Problems


Source: Reuters


• 2010 Department of Justice investigation 
into alleged 2006 misconduct, partially 
settled in 2013 with final resolution in 2016
 Slow, lengthy legal process means 


AVAV is still at risk for possible 
violations from many years ago


• Dispute centered on AVAV’s efforts to 
improperly obtain reimbursement for high 
levels of executive compensation as well 
as federal income taxes


• SEC filings admit to “error”: “we 
reimbursed the government for an 
amount erroneously charged to the 
government” (1)


• Filings hint at additional, more recent 
problems: “In December 2015, DCMA 
[Defense Contract Management Agency]
concluded that our purchasing system 
was not approved. In an April 2016 
follow-up review the DCMA approved our 
purchasing system.” (1)


• No further explanation given for

Undisclosed Whistleblower Lawsuit 
Raises More Questions


 In 2010, AVAV hired Joel Hirsch as Vice President of Strategic Operations
• Important enough to merit a press release touting Hirsch’s history as a former 


aerospace executive with military-contract experience
• Hirsch reported directly to AVAV chairman and then-CEO Tim Conver


 In December 2014, however, Hirsch filed a qui tam whistleblower lawsuit against AVAV, 
accusing the company of perpetrating an “indirect cost fraud scheme” that “overcharged 
the United States millions of dollars” – potentially tens of millions


• Core accusation: AVAV obtained reimbursement for costs incurred by its EV 
charger business – essentially exploiting its government contracts for UAS to fund a 
wholly unrelated new business!


• “These false billings with inflated indirect cost rates were made to the United States 
from approximately 2009 through 2014, and continuing” (Source: complaint)


 In May 2016, though, Hirsch dropped his suit (no explanation made public)
• Other than his initial complaint, most documents from the case remain under seal


 The lawsuit (never, to our knowledge, publicly mentioned by AVAV) raises serious 
questions about AVAV’s billing practices 


• Was this a factor in the DCMA’s recent rejection of AVAV’s purchasing system?

Lawsuit Alleges AVAV Abused Its 
Government “Expense Account”


 Hirsch alleged that AVAV treated EV-related costs as if they were UAS-related, 
thereby wrongfully obtaining inflated government reimbursements and partially 
offsetting R&D costs


 Inflated “indirect costs” then helped set the pricing benchmark for future contracts, 
further exacerbating the impact of the wrongdoing

Lawsuit Alleges that AVAV Abused Its 
Government “Expense Account”


 In an additional, separate incident, Hirsch alleged, AVAV tried to charge the 
government for EV assembly work temporarily done at a UAS facility
 It apparently took “internal complaints” to curtail this practice


 Given Hirsch’s close proximity to the C suite and AVAV’s avowed enthusiasm 
about his initial hire, Spruce Point believes his allegations are credible

AVAV has a debt-free balance sheet and has averaged nearly $250m of idle cash and investments in the past  
5 years, yet the Company does not deploy capital in an investor friendly or earnings accretive manner.

AVAV plays lip-service to share repurchases. In its life-time as a public company, it has repurchased just 
$3.2m in stock; the Company has also never paid a dividend. The returns on its cash and investment portfolio 


trail even some of Spruce Point’s worst targeted companies (eg. Tootsie Roll and Gentex) and represent 
squandered opportunity cost for shareholders


Miserable Return on Investment During Bull Market


“On September 24, 2015, we announced that on September 23, 2015 our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 
“Share Repurchase Program”), pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $25 million of our common stock from time to time, in 
amounts and at prices we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations…As of April 30, 2017, approximately 
$21.2 million remained authorized for future repurchases under this program” Source: 10-K

AVAV’s Business Visibility Gets Worse


Q1’15: Funded backlog increased by 25% over last year to $82 million, $45 million of the $68 million bookings in the 
first quarter were army orders for spares and raven upgrades. Strong bookings are continuing with the additional 
$52 million booked in the second quarter to date. This backlog gives us the highest visibility of revenue in 
recent years at 80% of the midpoint of guidance


Q1’16: Now an update to our FY 2016 visibility. As of today, we had year-to-date revenues for Q1 of $47 
million. Q1 ending backlog that we could execute in FY 2016 of an additional $85 million. Q2 quarter to date 
bookings that we can execute in FY 2016 of an additional $12 million, unfunded backlog from incrementally funded 
contracts that we expect to recognize revenue during the balance of the year of $5 million and revenues needed to 
hold EES revenues flat relative to last year of $23 million. This adds up to $173 million or 64% at the midpoint 
of our revenue guidance.


Q1’17: Now to an update of our FY '17 visibility. As of today we have year-to-date Q1 revenues of $36 million, Q1 
ending backlog that we can execute into FY '17 of an additional $67 million, Q2 quarter-to-date bookings that we can 
execute it FY '17 of an additional $19 million, unfunded backlog from incrementally funded contracts that we expect to 
recognize revenue for the balance of this year of $1 million and revenues needed to hold EES revenues flat relative to 
last year of $13 million. This adds up to $136 million or 51% at the midpoint of our revenue guidance.


Q4’17: Now I will share our view of fiscal 2018. As Teresa described moments ago, our total visibility for fiscal 
2018 is now 41%, the same as this time last year.


Perhaps, AVAV is hoarding cash because its business visibility is deteriorating every single year. Below, 
we’ve analyzed management commentary around guidance early in the year. We find that its business 


visibility trend has been cut half in the past few years: from 80% to 41%. This is another reason we caution 
that early results in FY 18 are likely to disappoint as they have in prior years.

AVAV’s Warranty Accounts


AVAV is finally acknowledging product challenges and may have delayed warranty expense recognition. 
In its last 10-K, AVAV revised its estimate of warranty expenses with a disclosure buried in its footnotes. 


Warranty costs settled are up 1.6x in the past three years.


AVAV Recently Disclosed The Reason For A Warranty Estimate Change (1)


1) Although AVAV’s accounts show an estimate change of $0.42m in FY2016, it did not discuss the reason for the change until FY2017

Weak Financial Disclosure Makes Business 
Trends Needlessly Difficult to Track


 While AVAV divides its business into two segments (UAS and EES), it breaks down only 
revenue and cost of sales along segment lines
 SG&A and R&D costs are not disclosed on a segment basis, nor are assets or other 


balance-sheet items
 This opaque reporting makes it impossible to analyze the overall profitability or 


return profile of each individual segment
 Helps conceal poor capital allocation (we’ve already stressed): 


 Spruce Point diligence (and whistleblower complaint) indicates that AVAV has 
poured disproportionately large sums into EES R&D without generating visible 
revenue growth; this bad decision-making is hidden by opaque segment reporting


 AVAV also fails to disclose any meaningful operating metrics – e.g. how many drone 
systems it sold in a given quarter or year (or average selling prices)
 Without unit figures, it’s impossible to estimate unit economics and drill down into 


what exactly is driving the Company’s weak FCF
 AVAV used to disclose the US Army’s total demand for new Raven systems (2,358 


units), but eliminated the disclosure starting with the FY2015 10-K as that 
demand target was hit, presaging the subsequent ~60% decline in Army revenue

Insiders Milking Comp


AeroVironment bears many similarities to iRobot. We criticized management’s lack of innovation and usage of 
company cash flow to milk excessive compensation. Not surprisingly, we find that AVAV insiders reap a 


comparably high % of SG&A in compensation.

Gaming The Bonus Targets To Skim 
From Shareholders?


Our original iRobot report called out insiders for gaming the bonus targets (1). AVAV is no different. Looking 
carefully, we find gross margin was omitted as a target in FY2017. Not surprisingly, we find that gross margin 
fell 9% and contracted by 300bps. Pre-tax income, on the other hand, increased and allowed management to 


claim 121% of its bonus target.

Of course this was a

Persistent Insider Selling, 
Blind Index Buying


Notice a familiar pattern? AVAV’s insiders consistently sell just like iRobot’s management.
Insiders sell stock every year and their beneficial ownership always decrease.


Meanwhile, index and ETF managers Fidelity and Vanguard buy every year.

High Executive Turnover in Past Year


 AeroVironment has churned through four CFOs in its brief life a public company:
• Raymond Cook resigns (reportedly due to health reasons), Teresa Covington appointed 


in his place (Dec 2016)
• Jikun Kim resigns as CFO (Feb 2015)
• Stephen Wright leaves to pursue other opportunities (March 2010)


 Other notable resignations of key individuals either disclosed as 8-K’s or gleaned from 
Linkedin biographies:


• SVP/General Counsel/Corporate Secretary (October 2016)
• VP of Human Resources and Administration (October 2016)
• Executive Director of Business Development (January 2017)
• VP of Engineering (March 2017)
• VP/CTO, Efficient Energy Systems segment (March 2017) 


 AVAV has gone through several phases of centralizing, then de-centralizing, then re-
centralizing its segments and operations, leading to continuous corporate disarray:
 AVAV has tried to bury disclosure that it’s still realigning / reshuffling its business. Per the 


Aug 2017 proxy statement, executive Kirk Flittie has bonus tied to achieving these goals: 
“implement internal reorganization of UAS business segment; increase UAS backlog; and 
implement and launch strategic growth initiatives for UAS business segment.”

Abortive Activist Campaign Highlights 
Hostility to Shareholders


 In July 2013, the activist fund Engaged Capital took a 5.1% stake in AVAV, seeking to 
correct the company’s purported undervaluation via “improved corporate governance, 
enhanced financial disclosure, an optimal capital structure, and a strong focus on value 
creating capital allocation”
 Complained of excess cash, lack of clear growth plans


 However, Engaged soon found that the Board had “no sense of urgency,” did not care 
about poor shareholder returns, and possessed an “undying commitment to the 
unacceptable status quo”
 “The Board Is Long-Tenured, Entrenched, and Out of Touch”
 “The Board Is Irrationally Insulating Itself from Outside Perspectives”


 By late 2014, having made little headway, Engaged Capital abandoned its campaign 
and sold all of its AVAV shares at an average price of ~$31, 40% below the current price


Source: Engaged Capital July 2013 press release, August 2013 letter to AVAV board, Bloomberg


A failed “long” activism attempt to force change at AeroVironment underscores 
management’s disregard for shareholders. Let’s see if Spruce Point “short” activism can 


break the status quo of mediocrity.

Growth Impeded by Endemic 
Mismanagement


 Spruce Point research, including discussions with multiple former employees, revealed 
that AVAV’s culture is stuck in the past, unable to adapt to current market conditions 
(e.g. the rise of DJI)


• Multiple complaints that executives, including the former CEO (now chairman), 
micro-managed the Company and wouldn’t fund the high level of R&D necessary 
to make the Company competitive outside of its small military niche


• The Chairman still seen as exercising tight control over the company despite 
stepping down as CEO


 Many talented employees have left or been pushed out in waves of short-sighted 
restructurings


“I joined AV in 2007 and left in 2015, and from the very moment I joined I heard “This sucks 
compared to the old AV”. … There was an internal survey at one point in which people rated 
their colleagues very highly, their direct supervisors highly, and upper management abysmally.”

Be A Fool, Buy iRobot and AVAV


We previously showed how many have pumped AVAV, including Stanford Financial (associated with 
convicted Ponzi scheme artist Alan Stanford). Motley Fool has followed the hype-machine and endorsement 


of AVAV (and iRobot) as “plays” on certain trends. Blindly following blanket recommendations to buy can 
prove costly as we illustrated with our iRobot short-sale call.

ETF Flows Distorting AVAV’s Share Price?


The US listed ROBO ETF, which now has $1.6B AUM, has been the fastest-growing ETF in 2017 (1).  Given 
AVAV’s “Bellwether” status in ROBO, it has been the beneficiary of sustained price-insensitive buying.  


Spruce Point believes these flows could quickly reverse and that there are numerous reasons to believe 
that ROBO’s buying of AVAV may cease in the near term

Cumulative ROBO ETF inflows, 2017


 Risk 1:  ROBO is limited to owning 4.5% of the free float of each underlying company.  We estimate that ROBO (US / UCITS) already 
owns 3.5% of AVAV’s float, implying that ROBO will have to cease buying or cap the weighting in the near term 


 Risk 2: Additional “Bellwether” companies are added to the index, diluting AVAV’s weight in the index.   Note: AVAV’s flattish 
performance since September has coincided with a ROBO rebalancing that decreased AVAV’s weight in the ETF, again suggesting the 
influence of technical factors, not AVAV fundamentals


 Risk 3: ROBO Global elects to remove AVAV from the index completely as a result of several potential conflicts with their ESC policy 
(e.g. Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance)


• Our report has demonstrated many questionable governance (bonus skimming, squandering corporate resources, trade 
export compliance violations, etc.)


 Risk 4: A broader market correction could result in significant ROBO outflows given very large investor gains to date

Fund Flows are Dominated by Indexers


There is extremely little buying of AVAV currently amongst mutual funds that aren’t indexing, unless of 
course you count high yield bond funds investing in equities

AVAV Trading At A Massive, 
Unjustified Premium To Its Peers 


Source: Company financials and Wall St consensus estimates
(1) To remove $11.19 per share in cash and investments


We benchmark AVAV’s valuation against an appropriate set of aerospace and defense companies 
with a presence in aerial surveillance. Temporary growth and unsustainable ETF buying has 
elevated AVAV’s valuation to the richest in its industry. We don’t believe this is sustainable.

It’s easy to see meaningful downside in AVAV’s price using a variety of valuation methods. AVAV’s current multiple is 
distorted given blind ETF buying and baseless enthusiasm about longer-term growth prospects. We apply long-term 


average multiples to derive our share price target.
