Ocean Power Technologies: Wave Goodbye To This Wave Power
Company

Summary


OPTT regurgitates old, misleading news that pops the stock price.


The star Australian project – despite what the market is led to believe – is gravely
jeopardized by a missing agreement and the absence of multi-millions in funding.


Big company projects, including the Oregon project, are dead, and others are
hopelessly bogged down by delay after delay. OPTT's lack of transparency keeps
investors unaware of those issues.


Investors/lenders fear offering OPTT desperately needed capital because of its
delays and difficulty showing wave power technology can become a viable business.
But proving wave power requires multi-millions.


Many of the projects are so small that the electricity generated by the ocean wave
technology could power only a few light bulbs.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Ocean Power Technologies (NASDAQ:OPTT) might blow its rivals out of the water - if only
it could deliver projects like it delivers regurgitated news.


OPTT stock was swimming with the bottom feeders when the company announced a
multi-million dollar Australian deal in January with the following deceptive headline:
"Ocean Power Technologies Announces Funding Agreement With Australian Government
For A$66.5 Million Grant."


Bam! Shares jumped with the announcement by 52.9 percent in pre-market trading to
$3.38.


But here's the deal: OPTT had already announced the grant five years ago. Here is that
headline: "Ocean Power Technologies Wins Funding From The Australian Federal
Government."

The January press release actually announced Aussie funding from the original grant
would be available for phase one and two, plus OPTT would now have to meet more
milestones. So this carefully crafted news release isn't really surprising, positive news at
all. But the market -- eager for a hint of good news -- took off and ran with it.


"Fool the investors" works this week, too


Buoyed by previous announcements, OPTT tried it again Tuesday.


This time, the regurgitated gem reads: "Ocean Power Technologies Announces Victorian
Wave Partners Has Received A$5 Million Initial Grant Funding From Australian
Renewable Energy Agency."


Many people mistook the announcement to mean that OPTT was getting a fresh batch of
funding. The sound of the Australia project apparently finally running toward its power-
wave goal -- combined with the sound of investors pushing the "buy" function -- was truly
deafening.


The stock price exploded almost 9 percent to $4.06.


What was wrong with this announcement? First, the $4.6 million (US dollars) grant was
already assumed, because execs in March said Australia, with conditions attached, would
fund part of the first phase.


This is not new. And it is not new funding. In fact, the release states that grant revenue will
be accounted for later, indicating OPTT doesn't dare count it now because the company is
unlikely to come up with the required matching money.


Second, the misleading headline ignores the real news that OPTT is legally required to
disclose in its 8-K, US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That real news is that
the Oregon project is officially Dead Sea debris.


The US Department of Energy has terminated the remaining teeny, single-buoy contract
with OPTT, because the company couldn't come up with enough money.


Key wording in the new SEC filing is:


"The Company and the DOE are discussing the steps necessary to close out the
project."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2124273-ocean-power-technologies-wave-goodbye-to-this-wave-power-company 3/15


OPTT's bad habit of regurgitating "news" is just another surface wave in a growing
tsunami of issues surrounding the company that has been trying since 1994 to turn
electricity-generating ocean wave power into a real business.


Indeed, the bitter words of OPTT's own house broker Collins Stewart ring as true today as
the day they were published in The Times of London's article. The broker ridiculed the
company in 2008 for "displaying a total inability to deliver."


TheStreetSweeper highlights below why that sad assessment is valid today, and we
believe will continue to be valid in the long run.


Issue Number 1: Troubled technology hasn't been proven - not for commercial use.


It's a vicious circle. The technology can't be proven because the money - another $150
million - isn't there. The money isn't there because the technology is unproven and
investors fear they'll lose money on a dying deal.


Let's look at the company's star project -- the Australian project -- from a dollars and
pennies perspective.


Back in 2009, Australia agreed to help OPTT with a demonstration project to build and set
up a wave power station off the Australian coast. The start date was August 2011. The
goal: eventually get enough of the company's buoys bobbing in the ocean to turn electric
generators to produce enough energy for 10,000 homes, at a capital expenditure rate of
more than $3 per watt, compared with wind energy's cost of only $1 per watt.


Australia's renewable energy program granted OPTT $60 million ($66.5 million Australian)
for this project.


But Australia is one stern sugar daddy that has attached two major hitches to that grant.


Matching money for the Australian project is absent


First, OPTT must pony up matching money, or lose the grant.


The total project cost in US dollars is about $210 million. Subtracting the grant, OPTT
must raise $150 million!


The Australian project is in phase one of three phases. Australia is willing to pay half of
the first phase, according to the recent earnings call. But OPTT can't even pay for its half
of the first phase.

Phase 1 has a $19 million price tag that is completely OPTT's responsibility. But the
company has only $17 million.


That money already faces an impossible stretch beyond the Australian project, because
OPTT has plans for an improved product in its back pocket. But the price tag attached to
the PB 500 is an estimated $13 million.


For OPTT - which has never been profitable, and carries a $148 million accumulated
deficit - the combined price tag might as well be a billion bucks.


Daunting second condition


The second hitch connected to Australia's grant -- and equally important to any potential
investor/lender -- is that OPTT must first get licensing and a purchase power agreement.
The power purchase agreement, or PPA, is an arrangement for OPTT to sell its wave-
generated power to a utility company.


About 5 years have passed. But still no license or power purchase agreement?


This is ominous. But during its most recent earnings call, the company tried to appease
antsy analysts concerned about its slow, awkward attempts to become a business.


An analyst asked about hindrances, noting that the new Australian administration seems
"openly hostile to renewable types of technology."


Chuck Dunleavy, the company's chief executive, denied the hostility characterization, but
admitted Australia is discussing whether to ditch its carbon tax benefit. The demise or
decline of the carbon tax benefit there may be the last gasp for a project already bobbing
in a crazy ocean of uncertainty.


Investors may find other viewpoints on OPTT HERE.


The company has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment in time to
meet the publication deadline.


Issue Number 2: Regurgitated "news" erroneously doubles share price


OPTT's old news habit frequently jumps out in the form of the dog-eared Lockheed Martin
deal. In a pre-Valentine's Day kiss to investors, OPTT announced Feb. 11 that the
company had a - gasp! - deal with Lockheed Martin. See the press release here.


This "news" is two years old.

Check out the same Lockheed Martin deal that the company's Securities and Exchange
Commission filing mentions happened in 2012, here. Or the old 2012 press release itself,
here.


Besides, as an analyst told TheStreetSweeper: "The two press releases even use the
same wording!"


Desperate companies pull this stuff because it works. That fake rehashed Lockheed
announcement nearly doubled OPTT's share price to over $4 overnight.


Unfortunately, the so-called news was that Lockheed is doing essentially what it has done
since 2009. Lockheed is still helping with design and project management. But it remains
to be seen just how long Lockheed will remain part of the equation now that it is working
with a Chinese conglomerate - one of various international companies - offering other
wave-powered options.


The regurgitated Lockheed and Australian announcements sparked the OPTT stock rally
that investors see now. It's all about regurgitated news that's been misinterpreted.


Why is OPTT obsessed with puffing itself up this way?


It needs money. Desperately.


Issue Number 3: Dead projects taint OPTT's prospects


The ambitious Oregon project has crumpled into a virtual $5-million heap of scrap metal.


The prototype power buoy sat on dry dock -- and kept eager investors dangling -- for three
long years, while OPTT kept busy violating its federal licensing requirements, fighting bad
weather and misplacing one of three anchors dropped in the sea floor. The state of
Oregon finally demanded last fall that OPTT pull up the last remaining anchor. And the
federal government told OPTT it must get its licensing act together before proceeding.


Amid hoop-la and back-patting, the company just last year boasted (in fact, the blurb is
still on the company website) that the Oregon project received "the first license issued for
a wave power station in the US."


But neither shareholders nor the US Department of Energy ever got to see the business
end of their investment -- the power buoy -- touch the ocean water.


And they never will.

Investors were surprised to learn on March 14 that OPTT surrendered a permit application
that would have allowed OPTT to eventually place 100 power buoys off the Oregon coast.


OPTT summarily dispatched this heartbreaker during the earnings call:


In late February, we decline to renew a preliminary permit received several years
ago from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in connection with the
potential future phase of that project.


This reflects our focus on determining the prospects to obtain added funding …


So, it was simply about the company refocusing? The company describes to FERC the
"unforeseen delays in Phase 1 Project implementation and associated studies, as well as
increased project-related costs."


The news that the project couldn't get past phase 1 -- much less phase 2 and 3 -- even
surprised analysts, including one who asked what specific regulatory requirement axed
the Oregon project.


CEO Chuck Dunleavy:


… where we stand right now is being very realistic with respect to the cost
associated with moving forward with that project.


… We certainly don't want to prejudge or second-guess ourselves as to where we
will come out.


Yet, filings with the FERC and SEC clearly show the big Oregon project was dead at that
point.


And now, this week's revelation shows even the tiny, single-buoy demonstration portion of
the project is absolutely dead.


Check out the filing here on page 19 to see more on how misunderstandings and missed
reports helped sink the deal.


Spain project no better than Oregon deal


Unfortunately, the original 2006 Spain project is also dead in the water.


Company filings say the 40-kilowatt buoy was tested and quickly removed from the water
because of problems with the power take-off and control systems.

Filings track the basic problem back to OPTT's ticking heart: The power buoy simply could
not perform.


Unfortunately, a recent company filing ominously warns that plans to improve the buoy
system may be abandoned if it can't scrape up external funding.


The company failed to meet its 3-year deadline to deploy the first buoy and connect nine
other buoys off the coast of Spain, according to filings. Further damaged by partnership
issues, OPTT scaled back the project into a simple single-buoy demonstration.


Investors must consider these dead projects and decimated upgrades amid the choppy
waters already churning around the Australian project.


Absent a miracle, the Australian project is dead, too.


Issue Number 4: "Completed project" powers only 3 light bulbs


Investors also should not be deceived by projects listed on the company website as
"Completed Projects." Much as we want to believe otherwise, these are not commercially
viable.


The most interesting "completed project" in Hawaii has earned US Navy funding and the
Marine Corps' blessing. But even it is simply a test site, connected to the power grid only
"to evaluate technical and economic feasibility of commercial scale wave energy systems
from multiple suppliers." The Navy's press releases says the goal is to eventually make
the Marine Corps Base Hawaii energy self-sustaining.


Here's the kicker. The buoy generated about 3 to 4 kilowatts. That would power the grand
total of three light bulbs left on all day.


Even though OPTT later upgraded the system to 40 kilowatts capacity, that still isn't
proving its wave power can become a commercial success.


Issue Number 5: Where is everybody going?


After the March 24 bell, the company filed a notice with the SEC that the chairman of the
board, George Taylor, is stepping aside. Though he'll remain on the board and as a
consultant, his retirement as chairman and an OPTT employee is "effective immediately."


The electrical engineer, who co-founded the company in 1984, has been a big defender of
the Australian project.

"We see this as a great opportunity to prove a large demonstration program which will
really satisfy the naysayers that this (wave power) is indeed a true competitor," he said in
January 2012 of the Australian project.


The founder's unfortunate departure follows the recent resignation of another key
manager. Brian Posner left his post as chief financial officer in August 2013.


One wonders what's behind the sudden departure of both the chief financial officer and
the founder. If key OPTT folks are jumping ship, what does that say about the direction of
the Australian project and the company itself?


Conclusion


We'd like to see a company surf the ocean wave power technology into commercialization.
But, in our opinion, this company can't do it.


The projects are dead or mired in delays; the company's caught in a vicious cycle of
unproven, un-fundable technology; the star Australia project is seriously jeopardized by
insufficient money and the critical absence of a power purchase agreement; the company
shows a sleazy aptitude for using regurgitated news to pop the stock price; and the lack of
capital is unlikely to be improved, because investors are not buying the company's pipe
dream.


All in all, we believe the OPTT technology -- even the entire OPTT plan -- offers investors
nothing but an ocean full of misfortune.

The technology is alluring and not impossible as the author makes it sound. It is debatable if this company is the one
to provide it though. Given its small market cap, the risk is clearly big but so is the plausibility relatively small deals
can pull it out of the hole. It's not really that shortable on such a small float.

May be you didn't understand but Lockheed Martin deal is a game changer, they understand that they are able to
obtain great performance from the technology, this $200 million project make the difference. Lockheed Martin have
the management and the qualities to make this technology work well, my opinion is that the share price is
undervalued today, my target price is $6

OPTT has been working with LMT almost from day 1. I wouldn't be surprised to see LMT acquire OPTT some
day,but only if they believe the technology is viable. So far it isn't.


03 Apr 2014, 12:45 PM


Tales From The Future, Contributor
Then why doesn't LMT just buy OPTT if the technology is so interesting?


Capital for sure isn't a problem looking at the market caps:


LMT: 52+ billion 
OPTT: 50 million


LMT could literally buy the company for pocket change if it wanted.

Lockheed Martin was used as a front to raise the stock price. What Sonya brought out is all true. I know
because I worked there. Wave Power is possible if one does not paying $300/KWH.

OPT has always been far better at self-promotion than it has been at making a product that worked. In 2008 George
Taylor, OPT's chairman and co-founder, was featured in this video:


http://bit.ly/1pWExlB


Not only are the claims misleading (to be kind) but apparently Mr. Taylor was such a true believer that according to
SEC filings from January 2009 through April 2011 he sold almost 400,000 shares at an average price of almost $6.00
per share. While there may have been personal reasons to sell at that time, if Dr. Taylor's predictions had been true
the company's share value would have increased by perhaps as much as a hundred-fold.


It can further be noted that the anchor that sits on the seafloor off or Reedsport, Oregon is not the anchor described in
the FERC license, which seemingly was never amended. The reason a different anchor was used is simple. There
are no anchor ships on the west coast capable of handling the designed and approved anchor.


As said, OPT is better at self-promotion than they are at designing and executing a workable power bouy. Be guided
accordingly.

yeah I have already sold a long position from a 2.10 price point but sold in the mid 6's.....then kept buying on
the way down thinking it would pop back but has kept sinking since the earnings report....ur crazy if u sell it
down here....it will hit 4 again within a few weeks probably

I have watched this company for years and have been long in the past. I have to say I concur with this article
completely. Recycling news is unforgivable and a very bad sign. I tried desperately to find shares to short when it
broke $5 recently because I knew I would make a killing on them, but no shares were available . Sorry, but this

If you still believe that OPTT has been working diligently towards perfecting its Power Buoy technology for the last 25
years and just needs a bit more time and money then perhaps you should know some more about the founder  
"Doctor" George W Taylor.


He does have an honorary doctorate for service to renewable energy. 
(where is the energy?... I haven't seen any yet) 
But what about the other two doctorates that got added on to his CV at about the time of the OPTT launch?


Doctor Taylor is a very unusual man. 
He completed a PhD in engineering at the University of Western Australia and then he popped over to London for 3-5
years and obtained another PhD in engineering. 
That is quite unusual. 
Then, after 25 years DEVELOPING his no-power Buoy he is awarded an HONORARY doctorate from the same
University of Western Australia. 
I don't think I have ever heard of anyone that is already a Doctor being awarded an HONORARY DOCTORATE from
that same University. 
Not much point in that really is there?


Dr. George W. Taylor has served as our Executive Chairman since January 2009. Prior to January 2009, Dr. Taylor
had served as our chief executive officer since 1993 and as a director since 1984, when he co-founded our company.
From 1990 to 2004, Dr. Taylor was our president, and from 1984 to 1990, he was our vice president. In 1979, he co-
founded and served as president of Princeton Research Associates, Inc., a consulting engineering, technical

Australia and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering degree from the University of London. He is a Fellow of the Institute of
Engineers, Australia and the Institute of Electrical Engineers, London.


To become a Fellow of the Institute of Engineers requires a significant contribution to the relevant field of Engineering
(in Australia and in United Kingdom if he is to become a Fellow of both Institutions. 
Perhaps II'm missing something. 
Was it the cheap watches? Was it the No-Power Buoys?


Perhaps it was for all the energy he put into carrying home his paycheck!


Thanks to Mick West of Metabunk for this summary of how 
"New Invention Schemes" operate.


"There's a type of scam out there that's being going on for at least 100 years. A company claims to have invented or
discovered something that will make a lot of money. Quite often this will be in the field of energy, although we see
them more and more in the field of weather control and information technology. The company can demonstrate
research, they will often hold one or more patents on the technology, and they will have some kind of prototype that
does not actually fully work, but they claim is a demonstration of the proof of concept. They won't reveal all the details,
despite having filed patents, because they either don't want people to steal their ideas, or they claim it's too early, and
more research needs to be done.


What they are looking for though, is investors. They will talk about the huge potential market, and hence the huge
amount of money to be made. They will get people to invest in their company. The technology will go nowhere slowly,
and eventually the principals will withdraw, and the investors will end up with nothing.


The scam works because it's not illegal to be wrong, unless you actually know you are wrong. So if you think you've
discovered a form of free energy, it's perfectly legal to set up a company to research and develop the technology. It's
quite legal to solicit investment based on what you think is correct science - even if it does turn out to be wrong, and
the investors lose all their money. They took a risk, they lost. It's quite legal to pay yourself and the other principals a
large salary.


So all you have to do to run such a scam is to never admit you knew it was a scam. You have to pretend you believe
in the technology. Then when it fails you simply keep insisting that you thought it worked, and you were sorry you
didn't get enough time to work out the kinks.


Then of course there are those people who actually ARE convinced that their technology works. There are plenty of
people who think they actually have discovered something new, and they just need a bit more research to make
money from it."

@The Street Sweeper, 
You have not written a balanced article - which makes me question your motives. Let me point out just 2 errors
because I don't have much time. 
1. You state that the February Lockheed Martin news report was no different from what was reported in 2012. If you

read your own links closely you will see that the proposed project in Australia has grown from 19 MW to 63.5 MW
over that time. That's a big difference, which is the reason fro the pop in the super depressed stock price. OPTT need
not waste time with the Oregon project when they have the Australia project. More funding on the way. 
2. You link to an article stating that Lockheed Martin is partnering with Chinese firms in the wave energy field. While
the article you link to uses the words "wave energy" the only alternative energy methods described in it are tidal
energy (underwater turbines) and energy from ocean temperature gradients. These are different from wave energy
(such as bouys like OPTT employs). 
OPTT has lots of potential. Wave energy could provide 5% of the world's energy needs. That will be a lot of revenue.

But wave energy is NOT RELIABLE. 
Quite apart from it being a very harsh environment for these proposed widgets to operate in (saltwater
corrosion, shifting sands, and massive storms). 
For much of the time the waves are too small to produce any worthwhile energy and at other times the waves
are too massive causing the widgets to shut down and go into survival mode.


Dozens of companies all getting funding to develop their wonderful widgets but not a single device actually
working and delivering power anywhere in the world. 
EMEC wave centre Scotland 
Wave Hub Cornwall 
Multi-million dollar white elephants sitting idle while waiting for wave widgets! 
Won't ANYBODY deliver one? 
(of course not!)

OPT & LMT will have to build 3 Mark 3 and 25 Mark 4 to generate the daily 62MW. OPT has never built a
Mark 3 and the Mark 4 is a figment of their imagination. The Oregon and the Scottish buoy cost abut
$50,000,000. 
You do the math. My knoledge comes from working at OPT.

Check Carnegie Wave Power, they are deploying 3 units of 250 KW capacity, they are in the Australian Stock
Excahnge, so with OPTT are the only two Wave Power Technology companies traded. In my eyes OPTT has
not prove nothing yet, so then why to go on a 65 MW project when you have fail everything else before.....

OMG Carnegie?

They've got a Doctor as well. 
Doctor Michael Ottavanio (he's a Doctor of business studies) 
Their Wave widget is safely underwater where nobody can keep an eye on it. 
It's an even sillier idea than the Power Buoy and the investors are well underwater. 
Coming real soon. Send MORE money!

nice work Streetsweeper!

The author needs to stick with finance, and stay away from engineering. A 3 kW bouy can power more than a few
lightbulbs... the number is actually 50. Still not overwhelming but an order of magnitude more than 2 or 3.

struckbyopt
3KW are not 3KWH. The real capacity factor of the buoy is about 15% not 30 to 45as OPT claims. So the real
power is about 450 WH

Pink sheets for OPTT in less than 3 years. All of their capital cash gets drown in their ocean of non-performance.
They are loaded with continual failure. 
Don't invest with hope. Invest by fundamental analysis!

You guys should make sure you pay attention to the last part of the article, "The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a
short position in OPTT and stand to profit on any future declines in the stock price." The article author works for them.
Clue? Surely the author of this article Sonya Colberg wouldn't portray things in a negative light right? Hahaha lol

Sounds like a fraud situation. I feel sorry for the folks who participated in the recent equity offering. Being underwater
from day one is not fun. =(

the thing about this stock is it can go to 5 bucks within a week....a very volatile stock....right now it is beat
down, but in a week it could look good again

Wow this article was spot on. Nice work.

All I have to say is this article killed it. Great job! Spot on across the board and the stock price reflects that today.
