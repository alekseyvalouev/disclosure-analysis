How China Borun Has Exaggerated Its Financial Performance
Oct. 27, 2010 3:50 AM ET97 comments
by: Alfred Little


This article is a follow up to my previous article, “China New Borun: Born to Run or
Destined to Fall”, and adds considerable new evidence to my argument that BORN has
significantly exaggerated its financial performance.


I. Massive Undisclosed Debts, Tax Losses and Black Market Sales


To get a better picture of BORN’s true financials, I recently obtained copies of Borun
Shandong’s (BORN’s main operating subsidiary) official tax records from the very
resourceful people at GeoInvesting.com (see endnote). As I have explained before and as
other experts generally agree, SAT records are very reliable since the Chinese
government imposes severe penalties on companies that fail to pay taxes. Following a
thorough review, I have identified several major discrepancies between these tax records
and BORN’s F-1 filed with the SEC.


The first major discrepancy that stands out in BORN’s 2009 SAT record is the large
amount of debt compared to its F-1 filed with the SEC. The following table shows at
12/31/09 Shandong Borun had short-term borrowing of RMB 320,800,000 while its F-1
filing only shows RMB 140,000,000, a difference of RMB 180,800,000. Even after
deducting the approximately RMB 80,000,000 additional cash shown in the SAT record
compared to the F-1 filing, the short-term borrowing is still more than RMB 100,000,000
higher than the amount disclosed in its F-1 filing. Furthermore, the SAT record shows
there is RMB 170,000,000 additional long term debt Shandong Borun borrowed in 2009
which is not disclosed in BORN’s F-1 filing. Is it just a coincidence that BORN hid RMB
170,000,000 in new long-term debt the same year they reported RMB 166,410,631 in net
income to their investors?

BORN and Shandong Borun Liabilities and Shareholders Equity at 12/31/08 and
12/31/09:


Based on its SAT record, Shandong Borun was highly leveraged and on the brink of
bankruptcy at the end of 2009. Its shareholder equity was only a miserable RMB
70,335,058 compared to RMB 516,209,389 BORN reported in its F-1 filing. Shandong
Borun’s staggering debt to equity ratio of 7.5 is an incredible 15X the 0.5 ratio BORN’s
public shareholders can calculate from its filings. The SAT record also shows a cumulative
loss of RMB 60,864,942 rather than the RMB 288,950,593 retained earnings BORN
reported in its F-1 filing. Clearly the company’s historical growth was supported only by its
debt and equity financing activity and not by cash flow from operations, which was
consistently negative according to the SAT record.


As the following table clearly shows, Shandong Borun’s revenues, income tax and
net income for 2008 and 2009 are significantly understated in its filings with the
SAT. Shockingly, Shandong Borun paid no income tax and reported losses of RMB
8,178,212 and RMB 24,624,218 in 2008 and 2009 respectively while BORN in its SEC F-1
filing claims it paid income tax of RMB 26,640,990 and RMB 56,262,029 on net income of
RMB 77,130,128 and RMB 166,410,631 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Furthermore,
SAT records show Shandong Borun’s sales were only RMB 141,990,308 and RMB

https://seekingalpha.com/article/232553-how-china-borun-has-exaggerated-its-financial-performance 3/32


138,509,566 in 2008 and 2009 respectively versus the SEC F-1 filing which shows RMB
615,881,195 and RMB 1,060,493,812. For 2009, Shandong Borun reported gross margin
of 5.5% compared to 23.4% BORN disclosed in its F-1 filing.


BORN and Shandong Borun Income Statements for 2008 and 2009:


Given the huge discrepancies, investors should demand management answer:


1. What did management do with the cash from at least RMB 270,000,000 in previously
undisclosed debts?


2. Why are BORN’s sales reported in its SEC F-1 filing incredibly over 4X (for 2008) and
7X (for 2009) the sales it reported to the SAT?


3. Why is BORN’s 2009 gross profit margin in its SAT record less than ¼ of the level
reported in its F-1 filing?


4. Why do BORN’s tax records show substantial losses?
5. Where did the RMB 26,640,990 and RMB 56,262,029 of income taxes BORN never


actually paid really go?


Together, these large discrepancies further support the conclusions of my previous article
(link here) which showed BORN significantly overstated its gross margin by 3X and
earnings per share by 4-5X in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the company’s antiquated

technology, understated input costs and fabricated corn germ sales. Add to these troubles
the fact the tax records show the financial condition of the company is even worse.


According to GeoTeam’s website, they “made numerous attempts to discuss this issue
with BORN management and its IR firm, but have not received a meaningful response.”
Likewise, I have been unable to get a response from management. Nor do any of the
analysts who follow the company have answers. Considering BORN’s extremely low gross
margins, I believe a partial explanation of the low sales and losses BORN reported to the
SAT is tax avoidance. My industry contacts explain that tax avoidance via black market
sales is the only way inefficient operators like BORN can survive. The motives for this are
clear.


First of all, consider the fact that edible alcohol manufacturers face unusually heavy tax
burdens that encourage large-scale tax evasion and black market sales. In fact, for all the
alcohol produced BORN must pay 17% VAT tax and 5% consumption tax but can only
deduct 13% VAT paid on its key input corn (In China VAT tax on corn is only 13%). In fact,
since BORN is such an inefficient producer without advanced processing technology for
making enough corn germ and CO2 byproducts the challenge to survive further compels
BORN to evade VAT and consumption tax by engaging in black market sales it did not
report to SAT in 2008 and 2009. These black market sales explain why BORN’s current
customer base is limited to small and medium sized “baijiu” brands willing to collude with
BORN to evade tax. Top tier state owned brands like Moutai (SHE: 600519), Luzhou
Laojiao (SHE: 000568) and Wuliangye (SHE: 000858) will not help BORN evade tax
through undocumented sales.


II. Further Analysis of the antiquated “Borun Wet Process”


In a research article titled “A Comparison between the Modified Wet Method and Semi-Dry
Method Corn Processing Technologies in Ethanol Plants” (酒精工厂改良湿法与半干法玉米
处理工艺的对比)published in the authoritative trade journal “Cereal and Food Industry”
(2010 Volume 17 Number 3 粮食与食品工业期刊2010年第17卷第3期), four types of corn
processing technologies (Dry, Semi-Dry, Modified Wet and Wet) are compared based on
technological and economical indicators (see table below):

From this table, the researchers conclude, “The dry method cannot recover any
byproducts such as corn oil. The wet method has a very high production cost. Therefore
as a result both methods have been abandoned”. The researchers go on to point out the
5/18/2018 How China Borun Has Exaggerated Its Financial Performance - China New Borun Corporation (NYSE:BORN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/232553-how-china-borun-has-exaggerated-its-financial-performance 6/32


inherent flaws in the wet method, which create long production cycles (long duration of the
soaking cycle), high electricity consumption, large investment requirements (equipment)
and high operating costs. The researchers ultimately favor a “modified” wet-method but
note that this method has not been successfully applied on a large scale in China due to
technical barriers.


Borun’s existing patent covers a non-modified wet method of production. According to the
Invention Patent Application for “Corn Fermentation based Ethanol Production Method”
filed by Shandong Borun Industrial on April 15 2008: “This invention involves a wet
method of corn germ extraction, specifically a wet method of corn germ extraction and
fermentation for ethanol production.”


The details of Borun’s wet method disclosed in the patent application include a long
soaking process for the corn of 48-50 hours, typical of other wet methods. By comparison,
the next generation modified wet method analyzed in the research article only requires 6-
12 hours of soaking. The “Borun Wet Method” that BORN management has so
emphatically hyped to shareholders is in fact merely a minor modification and
improvement of the typical wet method, which according to all reports is antiquated as an
alcohol production method in China.


Another research article titled “Take Another Look at Semi-Dry Grinding Method for
Ethanol Plants” (对酒精厂玉米半干法粉碎的重新认识)published in the trade journal Liquor
Making (November 2001, Volume 28, Number 6 酿酒2001年11月28卷第6期) analyzes
COFCO’s 200,000 ton semi-dry process plant in Zhaodong and concludes that the semi-
dry method is more profitable than the wet method. The researchers mention in the article
that the Shandong Jiujiu wet method plant was under construction at the time of
publication. Recall BORN’s CTO Wei Qi was previously the CTO of Jiujiu which later filed
for bankruptcy.


Most importantly, as I pointed out in my prior article, BORN management is clearly aware
of its antiquated wet process method and recently hired Henan Wantongtong Machine
Manufacture Corp., Ltd to upgrade its wet method production lines to the superior semi-
dry method used by most large edible alcohol manufacturers in China.


Conclusion:


As of the date of this article, BORN management and IR team have failed to respond to
the questions raised in my prior article. Nor have they responded to analyst or investor
inquiries regarding these issues. Piper Jaffray’s senior analyst Anson Chan recently raised
his price target for BORN by 127% from $9.70 to an outrageous $22.00 based on his
5/18/2018 How China Borun Has Exaggerated Its Financial Performance - China New Borun Corporation (NYSE:BORN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/232553-how-china-borun-has-exaggerated-its-financial-performance 7/32


Comments (97)


increased “confidence” in BORN, which he believes will exceed revenue guidance by a
mere “2%-4%”. Furthermore, Chan described the 20% drop following my first article as a
“good entry point” without seriously addressing any of the issues. Chan made no estimate
of the shipping costs of corn from Daqing to Shandong that add by my estimates RMB 200
per ton to BORN’s costs. Nor did Chan address BORN’s inability to produce and sell the
corn germ they claim.


Incredibly, Chan continues to assure investors that BORN “is the first company to use wet
milling for ethanol production in China” and that there is no toxic waste problem. This is
clearly wrong. As any expert in China will tell you, and as its patent application shows,
BORN’s wet process method is the same as other traditional wet methods: totally
inefficient, antiquated, environmentally destructive and unprofitable. Management
themselves have admitted this to my expert who toured their plants. Management has
even gone so far as to engage a 3rd party to upgrade its antiquated plants to the semi-dry
method used by the major competitors. If you don’t believe me just call them and ask
(good luck getting an answer). Once again if you listen to Wall Street analysts who
convince you to buy at the high right before insiders start selling once their six month
lockup expires and ahead of BORN’s large anticipated follow-on offering, you are destined
to lose.


Note: GeoInvesting LLC asked me to disclose that “GeoInvesting does not form definitive
opinions of fraud based solely on SAT/SAIC filings. We just want to be aware of all
possible risks, however minute, before we make an investment. We obtained the annual
financial statements which is filed by BORN for the annual income tax calculation from
SAT."

I've been suspected BORN is frauding. I read China's 2009 ethanol industry report, The industry was so
gloomy in 2009 with an average profit margin of less than 4%, with the best performers no more than 9%, and
1/3 of the manufacturers reported loss. The first half of 2009 was the worst with supressed edible ethanol
price. However, even in such bad time, BORN still reported a 23% gross margin (see BORN Q2 filling).  
I could not believe how BORN management dare to go so far?

To be fair, if you ever read the research report on BORN written by the Oppenheimer analyst Katherine Lu,
you will see the basis of the author's suspicion. In the report, she assumes BORN will raise another $50
million in her earning's prediction. That was why her EPS estimates for 2011 is below the street. I've heard
from the investors who has visited the company saying CEO has indeed expressed the need to raise more
capital for the next phase of expansion. The CEO also made it clear to the group of investors such he did not
like borrowing money from banks. Realistically, how is that possible you think a producer of a commodity
product in a over-supplied industry can grow this fast without raising more money to build another plant?

This has been widely speculated in the professional investment community and the bankers, who manages
the next round of financings, have all motivations to stay bullish on BORN. Again, to be fair, this huge conflict
of interest is "fully" disclosed by the analysts in the footnotes or last page of their research reports, written in
tiny fonts, to caution the investors that their banks get paid by raising money from you.

Mr. Little , thank you for your persistent efforts to unmask BORN as a fraudulent Chinese small-cap. However, as with
your previous analysis, I have serious doubts about its legitimacy and intent. 
1. If you have the SAT docs --- Scan them to a PDF and post them! Or at least give us the registration number for
them. Otherwise, many will doubt you have the SAT docs. 
2. "Management themselves have admitted this to my expert who toured their plants. ... If you don’t believe me just
call them and ask (good luck getting an answer)." This makes no sense: if management will not respond to my
enquiry concerning its wet milling (as you imply parenthetically) , why should it admit to your expert.

3. When you ask the questions 3 and 4: 
"3. Why is BORN’s 2009 gross profit margin in its SAT record less than ¼ of the level reported in its F-1 filing? 
4. Why do BORN’s tax records show substantial losses?" 
you make the mistake of confusing Shandong Borun with BORN. Re. Question 3 the gross profit margin is less than
1/4 only for Shandong Borun (not BORN) in 2009, and Re. Question 4 only Shandong Borun shows losses in 2008
and 2009, not BORN. The two are different entities. Your critique falsely conflates the two.


26 Oct 2010, 05:48 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for your thoughtful questions. Here are my answers:


1.) As I disclosed in the article, the SAT records belong to GeoTeam who let me use them. You can contact
them yourself and request a copy. FYI Shandong Borun's taxpayer registration number is 370783726202824.


2.) It depends on which management you talk to. My expert talked to Borun's plant managers as well as
equipment suppliers and engineers. But if you speak to the CFO, like most investors, you won't learn anything
about Borun's operations and technology.


3. and 4.) The Daqing Borun legacy production line had 30k tons capacity in 2008. Borun added phase II 70k
production to Daqing in August 2009. The SAT record on Daqing was incomplete for 2008 and not available
for 2009. So while my comparison of BORN sales to Shandong sales admittedly excluded any Daqing sales,
nevertheless the analysis of Shandong Borun's margins is still meaningful. Shandong Borun gross margin of
5.5% is still dramatically lower than the 23.4% overall gross margin BORN stated in its F-1.

Alfred Little:


I believe that you are abusing Borun's SAIC filing and the research report you cited.


Firstly, here is part of the article replied by CGA's management on their press release on September 13, 2010. You
are very familiar with this company.


Since in your article you rely heavily on SAIC filings, you should at least answer whether the explaination below
applies to Borun.


'SEC Filing and SAIC Filing


It is well documented that reports filed with the PRC State Administration for Industry and Commerce ("SAIC") often
do not reflect the comprehensive income and financial condition of a company. You may further refer to Roth Capital's
Industry note on Comparing PRC filings and SEC filings - Primer, released on July 12, 2010; Robert Hsu's Briefing
#222 on Reasons Behind Discrepancies in SAIC vs. SEC Filings, released on July 28, 2010; and a recent article
written by Maj Soueidan, President at Geoinvesting on The SEC vs. SAIC Fact Finding Mission, released on August
25, 2010. The reason is that SAIC is a general registry of companies. It is not a tax authority with which tax returns
are filed or tax payments made. Oftentimes, Chinese companies access SAIC filings to learn more about their
competitors to gain a commercial advantage. As a result, many companies have understated their financial results in
such filings. As discussed in the above cited studies, individuals knowledgeable about China do not rely on SAIC

filings as a basis for determining a company's financial position. Rather, they rely on a company's tax filings and
payments to the authorized PRC governmental authorities. '


finance.yahoo.com/news...


I think you already know the above words well, if you think the words are rightly applies to Borun, you are misleading
your readers.


Secondly, I downloaded the research papers you mentioned in your article. I'm affirmed that you are misleading your
readers if you have read the articles by yourself!


In the paper “A Comparison between the Modified Wet Method and Semi-Dry Method Corn Processing Technologies
in Ethanol Plants” (酒精工厂改良湿法与半干法玉米处理工艺的对比... in the authoritative trade journal “Cereal and
Food Industry” (2010 Volume 17 Number 3 粮食与食品工业期刊2010年第17卷第3期), its authors highly appreciated
the modified wet-milling method.


Now I cite part of this article: 
''改良湿法源于美国改型湿磨法(Modified wet miling)，于1996年率先在美国实现工... %～6．8% 。据PSI公司的报导资
料称，改良湿法的生产成... ，纯利润却增长15．79%。1994年长春市轻工系统组团赴美考察时参观了
NorthPlateHastings燃料酒精厂，该厂即采用此工艺提胚，回国后建议吉林省石化院对此工艺进行研究。经吉林省科委
同意，吉林省石化院承担了改良湿法的工业化试验研究，并通过省级鉴定。目前国内吉林燃料酒精公司和山东九九酒精


公司均采用此工艺。''


Now I translate: 
Modified wet milling method was originated in the United States. In 1996 this method was applied to industrial use. It
simplified the wet method, so that the process using the modified ethod extracts germ but does not separate fibers
and protain, and as a result reduces the unnecessary machines and the time needed to soak corns. The corn germ
extraction rate is similiar to the wet method at between 6.5% and 6.8%. According to the reporting material from PSI
company, the production cost of the modified wet method increases only 1.55%, meanwhile, NET PROFIT increases
15.79%. In 1994, a group of people working in the light industry of Changchun City visited North Plate Hastings's fuel
acohol plant in the United States, which applies the modified wet milling mothod to extract corn germ. Aftering getting
back to China, the Fosil Oil and Chemical Industry Research Institute of Jilin Province was recommended to research
on the modified wet milling method. The Fosil Oil and Chemical Industry Research Institute researched and
experimented the industrial application of the modified wet milling method, and finally passed the province
government's appraisal. Currently Jilin Fuel Acohol Company and Shandong JIUJIU ACOHOL COMPANY are
applying this method.'


From the research article we can see clearly that the CTO of Jiujiu Acohol Company, who was hired by Borun later,
knows the ' MODIFIED wet milling method'. Then we can deduce that Borun is applying the 'modified wet milling
method' , not the outdated 'wet method'. If you, Afred Litlle, really read the research article carefully by yourself, I think
that you are telling lies (I use this word by the first time here) and misleading your readers.


I agree that Borun's management and IR do not reply to investor's questions efficiently. I tried to contact Borun's IR
but failed, too. I hope Borun can react to investor's suspects as soon as possilbe.


Afred Little, I hope you can objectively use your expertise, don't misuse it.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/232553-how-china-borun-has-exaggerated-its-financial-performance 14/32


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Your deductions are wrong. No chinese company has implemented the high tech modified
wet method on a large scale. JIUJIU appears to have attempted it but went bankrupt. Borun's method
(according to its patent and its plant management explanation) is a standard wet method that is antiquated
and unprofitable. Borun's plant management admits they are upgrading to the superior and widely used semi-
dry method. There is nothing more to say. Keep trying to call them to confirm for yourself.


I relied on SAT (not SAIC) filings for my financial analysis. SAT is the chinese equivalent of IRS, whereas
SAIC is just the "commerce department" and rarely penalizes companies that understate sales and income.
SAT however will severely punish company management failure to pay income and VAT tax. Therefore SAT
records are generally regarded as very reliable.


That said, and as I disclosed in another response, the Daqing Borun sales and income figures were not
completely available from the SAT (according to Geoteam). But I have no reason to believe (based on
Daqing's 30k capacity in 2008 or its additional 70k capacity in August 2009) that this omission would explain
more than 20-25% of the void between BORN's tax returns and its SEC filings.


Thanks for your questions and I hope this at least partially satisfies your concerns.

Alfred Little,


Can you let me know how long have you been doing business/investing in China? How do you think if
someone (Geo guys) can really get the SAT records? SAT records are not public. If Geo guys told you that
they had the SAT records, I cast a substantial doubt on it. They're either liars or criminals.

Hi Alfred, 
I found your article quite persuasive (but to be fair I should say that I haven't done any of my own research on BORN).
I've bookmarked your blog and you've gotten yourself another reader. 
One bit of advice to you... 
Your disclosure indicated "no position" while it's pretty obvious that you've done a lot of work here and have a strong
short bias. 
If you're getting compensated by a short seller, you should disclose that; otherwise, your disclosure is misleading. If
you don't believe me, you should ask a lawyer. This could come back and bite you later, hard.

Author’s reply »  As I have stated elsewhere, I have no position. I did contemplate a position but didn't see
any shares available to borrow.


I do not receive any compensation nor does my blog yet sell subscription services.


I am primarily a long term investor and plan to publish many long ideas when valuation makes sense.


Recently my motivation writing these articles is to expose obvious questionable financial and business
practices. My hope is that the higher quality chinese companies, many of which I plan to own once they get a
little cheaper, will then deserve higher valuation in the long run.

so you are now trying to hit Borun's price and then when it gets cheaper then you can buy. You have so many
seemingly insights about Borun, so I guess you probably already know that Borun's 3Q earning is much
higher than expected! So you can buy at low and sell high when the reports come out!!!! I even suspect that
you have some close relationship with Borun!!!!!

"I do not receive any compensation nor does my blog yet sell subscription services."


hmmm... so you have no position in the stock and not getting compensation, but you have 'experts' working
for you in the field asking plant managers in China? Not only that, but you publish multiple reports on multiple
Chinese micro caps, grab and analyze reports from the Chinese government (most of which require
specialized legal expertise). Are those guys all working without compensation too? Are you all philanthropists
with a lot of time on their hands, working for the cause of exposing potential Chinese microcap fraud to
Americans?


In addition... If you believe what you write, it's only logical that you have a personal position. Afterall, you have
spent much time, effort, and money in pursuing this. . The fact that you have zero personal position and at the

BORN is just going through a normal pullback. You can tell that the big-money in this stock sees these articles as
having little to no credibility as the volume on the 25% decline wasn't the largest volume the stock has ever seen
(meaning that the big guys stayed in and the retail investor sold because the article was posted on CNBC and that's
their primary way to recieve information). Also, It rebounded in heavy volume the next few days after the first article,
which is a good sign. It had a great run and is just forming a base now. I can't wait to hear the earnings call tomorrow.

Another top notch research piece from Alfred. It's interesting so far most of the comments from the supporters of
BORN either question a single assumption/detail of his analysis or are pure personal attacks that is totally unrelated
to the discussion. We all understand the center of the issue here is the exaggerated gross profit margins, I'd like to
see someone to refuse author's analysis with his/her own calculation of the gross margin. I haven't seen one yet, not
even from the company management themselves. The wall street analysts, who are supporting the companies with
blind faith and a conflict of interest, are mostly clueless so far.

I thought the pool of Chinese reverse merger is the place to find fraud, now looks like even some small ipos are
suspicious too. After all, this is not a stock taken public by any of the top tier bulge bracket investment banks. It
doesn't have a "big 4" auditor either. BDO in China is not the same as BDO Seidman in the US. They're not inspected
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and have signed off on fraudulent Chinese companies before.

Starting quote


"Over the years, Borun production management professionals have been devoting themselves to the research and
development of our production technology. We believe our in-house developed Borun Wet Process has a higher
production yield and is a more highly efficient and environmentally friendlier manufacturing process, which results in a
cost effective, consistent and superior product widely sought by baijiu producers. Producers of baijiu often have
distinctive taste and flavor profiles that are achieved through proprietary recipes and blending techniques. The
consistency and quality of the edible alcohol we supply to them is critical to achieving these taste and flavor profiles."

ShanDong Borun's Website is en.borun.cn/, it is doing every kinds of business but not producing alcohol!!


And BORN is a leading alcohol producer in China.


The only common point they share is that their headquarters both are in the Shandong Province in China, which is
just like two different firms both in California state in U.S


BORN's full name is China New Borun, whose website is www.chinanewborun.com/

Care to explain what your point is? I double checked the tax reg #. It is indeed for Shandong Borun Industrial
Co Ltd, the main operating subsidiary of BORN according the org chart on pg. 11 of its prospectus. So you
basically confirmed he has the tax filings for correct subsidiary. China New Born is a cayman island company.
Regardless, how do you explain the 270 million of debt on Shandong Borun's balance sheet, now that you
acknowledged we're looking at the correct operating subsidiary? Also, regardless of which subsidiary he's
got, the gross margin should never be only 5% if BORN was really earning the 23% gross margin like they
fabricated.

This research article here compares the wet process with dry and semi-wet process,  
wenku.baidu.com/view/f...


The article is in Chinese so people can read by using some translation software. It concludes that "modified wet"
method is better than dry and semi-wet.


So, now, it is no doubt that Wet can be as good as or even better than other methods.


Now, the debatable point is whether Borun's wet is the so-called modified wet in this article.

I believe so! The research paper is done in 2006 and it compares the alcohol industry in 1995-2005. And China New
Borun claims that there wet process has many advantages against other traditional methods, so that means their
method is modified, but not just the old Wet method.


Thus, there is nothing to blame on their technique. And we also believe they just keep modifying their wet process to
make it better and better, that's not something to worry as investors...


So, just hold on, the earning report will come out soon. As we all know, north China is very cold in winter, and "Baijiu"
consumption will significantly increase in winter! Especially there is Christmas, New Year and the most important
Chinese New Year Golden Week Holidays, people will consume a lot "Baijiu" during this period, as people have more
spare time to get together for a reunion party or celebrations.


So, Mr. Little, why not just let the earning report speak ?????? Or you can file a claim with SEC to charge Borun for
any exaggerated financial numbers, instead of wasting your time here.


If what you are talking is true, then you can short, and file claim with SEC, and then maybe Borun will be delisted
soon, then you can win even more? Why dont you do that? because you are nothing but a rumor teller.....

Wet Ethanol Production Process Yields More Ethanol and Co-Products 
Using a wet ethanol production method that begins by soaking corn kernels rather than grinding them, results in more
gallons of ethanol and more usable co-products, giving ethanol producers a bigger bang for their buck — by about 20
per cent according to the University of Illinois.


"The conventional ethanol production method has fewer steps, but other than distillers dried grains with soluble, it
doesn't have any other co-products," said University of Illinois agricultural engineer Esha Khullar.


"Whereas in both wet and dry fractionation processes, the result is ethanol, distillers dried grains with soluble, as well
as germ and fiber. Corn fiber oil for example can be extracted from the fiber and used as heart-healthy additives in
buttery spreads that can lower cholesterol."


In comparing the wet and dry fractionation methods, Khullar's research team found that when using the wet
fractionation method, the result is even higher ethanol concentrations coming out of the fermenter and better quality
co-products than the dry method.


In the wet process, the corn kernels are soaked, washing the germ, which Khullar says is a cleaner separation.
"There's not a lot of starch sticking to the germ. That's why you get higher oil concentrations."

After the kernels are soaked they are ground to produce a slurry. The slurry is soaked with enzymes so that it raises
the specific gravity to a point where the germ starts floating and can be fished out from the top.


Khullar explained that in the dry fractionation method, the kernel is crushed, flattening out the germ. "The germ is still
attached to a certain part of the endosperm and you still have a few starch pieces sticking to it. You have a very high
starch content germ from the dry fractionation and that lowers the oil content. That's why there's a big difference in the
wet process versus the dry process."


Dry and wet fractionation methods have been developed to separate out the germ and pericarp fiber before
fermentation which is more efficient because the germ and fiber are non-fermentable. "It's better to removed them
before the process. That way you have more starch in the fermenter. And you don't have to heat them and bump
them and cool them," Khullar said.


The process doesn't require developing any new equipment. "It's just a modification of things that are already being
done in the corn processing industry and can be done pretty easily," Khullar said.


Ethanol Production from Modified and Conventional Dry-Grind Processes Using Different Corn Types was published
in a 2009 issue of Cereal Chemistry. Funding was provided by the University of Illinois and Monsanto Company. The
research team included Erik D. Sall, Kent D. Rausch, M.E. Tumbleson, and Vijay Singh.

Author’s reply »  Ok folks, let's keep this very simple.


Dry Process: Inefficient, No one uses 
Wet Process: Inefficient, BORN and a few others still use, maximum 11% gross margin 
Semi-Dry Process: Industry standard, maximum 16% gross margin 
Modified Wet Process: theoretically superior to semi-dry but not deployed on a commercial scale in any plants
in China


Now, BORN is in the process of UPGRADING to SEMI-DRY.


That means that currently they are at most generating 11% gross margins (vs 23% they claim).


Once upgraded then optimally they can generate 16% gross margin.


Their historical financials are no doubt false. Plus management has not explained the RMB270 million in
undisclosed debt. Anyone with a basic understanding of accounting will realize that all that the historical
financials are meaningless if there is another RMB 270 million debt off the books. As I stated in my last article,
Borun's shandong division was on the verge of bankruptcy last year.

softlander1029
Alfred, you kept saying BORN is upgrading from their wet method to SEMI-DRY method. Do you have any
proof of this or who was it that you spoke to at the company that told you this?

You are saying this 
while Borun saying that...


Provide us with evidence!!!!


Quote from BORN's web


"Advanced and unique manufacturing technique is the soul of a manufacturing enterprise for its permanent
existence and continuous growth. Believing in this, Borun has been putting great energy and strength on its
technical research section, striving for creating and maintaining its leading position in advanced technical
development in the Chinese edible alcohcol industry. A patent of our invention application for our Borun Wet
Process, which is independently developed by our production management professionals, has been accepted
by the State Intellectual Property Office of the PRC.


Borun currently has a research and development department staffed with ten individuals that have
qualifications in various disciplines including fermentation engineering, biological technology and applied
biology and food engineering. Company's research and development team is mainly responsible for the
cultivation and selection of enzymes for fermentation, improvement of production technique and processes,
improvement of the quality of our products and collating industry standards and information and ensuring we
are abreast of advance technologies.


We believe the key to our gradual improvement on our production technology is our understanding and
control of temperature, enzyme and acidity as well as other key parameters during each stage of the
production process. The understanding and application on these key factors are closely related to the
continuous and long-term research by our technical professionals."

Soft- It was probably the "investor" who spoke with the CEO while at the plant and passed this information on. Or
maybe it was Littles "expert" touring the plants? Maybe it was the one armed man or the tooth fairy? 
And don't ask Little for his source material, he admits he does't have it. He borrowed it from the Geo boiler room
goons.  
And Little you never answered about the "large" follow on offering you lied about or the insider selling you base on
nothing. Point me to where you have information on insiders wanting to sell shares.

scotb1, why don't you read other people's comments carefully before making a stupid statement. Regarding
your question about the follow-on offering, pick up your phone and talk to the Oppenheimer analyst, as you
were told days ago. She will tell you why BORN needs to do a follow on offering. Plain and simple, once the
new production facility goes online this year, BORN can't sustain the growth without raising more money to
build a plant. The analyst modeled in $50 million from stock offering in 2011 in her EPS estimates. The need

for a follow-on offering is widely understood by the investment community. I'm short BORN stock because I
believe it's just another one of those Chinese fraud. I welcome intelligent discussion/facts from people with a
different opinion to prove I'm wrong, but all of your comments here so far have been meaningless bashing or
personal attacks, at best, twisting other people's meaning and providing no facts to refute the fraud
allegations. Hearing all of that from you and nothing from BORN management just strongly reinforced my
belief that this company is cooking its book.


Read Al's latest comments under the newest IBD article. You will find his conclusion came from talking to two
of BORN's suppliers mentioned in this SA article. Again, if you don't trust him, why don't you pick up the
phone and talk to those two firms, especially the one in Henan province that's helping BORN upgrade from
the inefficient Wet method to the better Semi-Dry method? I await for your answers, assuming you even dare
to phone those two suppliers to find out the ugly truth.

What i have a problem with as do a lot of posters here is Little and Geos lack of disclosure. I don't believe Little hired
an expert in China, writes these articles and Geo goes on message boards bashing in cap locks to SELL SELL
NOW!!! GET OUT BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!! because they are looking out for us as investors. IsGEO a non profit
looking out for widdle ole me or are they short the stock? It's tacky and unethical to say the least. You can come up
with all the numbers and short millions of shares I don't care. I actually like going long stocks with large short interest.
What I don't like is you and the rest of the Geo guys insulting our intelligence that you aren't doing all this to make
money.  
So last post for me. Fought the good fight. I'll be waiting for the conference call in NOV. I've made a lot of money in
BORN and would like to make some more hows that for disclosure! Oh and about that analyst...most are wrong most
of the time. Just look over the hundreds of buy ratings of MSFT over the last ten years on a stock thats been flat for
ten years. I do my own research.

AL open question for you, you want to be the messiah of the folks holding the BORN stock, and since you have huge
experience, why don’t you call and complain to SEC about the scam? Since your data is very reliable!


Actually the fact of the matter is that you want to buy these stocks at a low price evident already from your previous
post of your article that you are unable to buy Chinese stocks as they are expensive and you now use this scheme of
phony data to a make a point, and you want others to prove you.


There are lots of evidences in the previous post of yours by other respected members and you have not bothered to
answer them at all!!!

Are you going to do a follow up or is this a HIT and RUN? I see the PPS is back on the rise nearly back to where is
was trading before you smeared it. Did you make your money and run? I would like to know why the company is still
in business and growing. Somewhere your logic went wrong? Should we expect this same logic to fail on other
chinese low float companies that your group is smearing? You publish these articles to inform us on where to invest
so please enlighten us as to what to do now. Thanks.

Author’s reply »  SAIC and SAT very well may have been amended to match. Any company with enough local
power in the government can do that. I place little value on SAIC records. SAT is much more valuable, but a
powerful company can even adjust that record, too. Raise a glass to Borun!

BORN fell over 40% from when I showed the company exaggerated its performance. I am not one to get into
a "fight" with management. I have nothing else to say. The facts are the facts.


And yes, as always I scaled out of my positions in the $10-$12 range after the market established this new
valuation. Once the facts are out there in the open, and the market evaluates them, I am not going to fight the
market either.


It is much more profitable to move on to another opportunity. Cheerfully Compounding,

So you scaled down your position? If the company is a fraud as you have claimed with Zero evidence why
would you scale out when you could make another $12 on 1 short position? You are a fraud and the only
reason the stock priced dropped is due to your slanderous articles about the company spreading lies. The
SEC needs to step in and put you guys behind bars.

Alfred,


If BORN has antiquated production methods and has exaggerated its financial performance how do you explain the
stock's performance since the opening ceremony last Friday at the Daqing facility? Surely investors attending the
ceremony knew of your articles and allegations concerning BORN and yet the stock has rallied since then.


BTW, you can bet the auditors will double down on their auditing procedures in the areas addressed in your articles. If
BORN comes out of the 2010 audit on a timely basis and clean it will have some significance.


I agree there is lots of fraud in the China small cap space but believe BORN is okay. Time and Mr. Market will tell us
what the true story is.
