The New York Times Has Only Scratched The Surface On BofI
Holding...

by: The Friendly Bear


Summary


The accusations against BOFI in The New York Times include what we believe may
be a potential pending whistleblower action that could blow the lid off this "bold
lending operation".


This point is compounded by FOIA requests into the SEC that suggest there may be
an ongoing and undisclosed SEC investigation into BOFI.


To back up our claims, we have accessed public records and analyzed hundreds of
BOFI's loans in detail.


In this article, we provide actual BOFI loan documents that demonstrate BOFI's
lending standards and LTV "gimmicks".


BOFI has overearned by under-reserving and funding high-risk brokered loans with
high-cost deposits. When the California housing market turns, we think BOFI will be
a "black eye" for regulators.


"Irrational lenders come and go - mostly they go." 
 
- John Stumpf, Chairman & CEO of Wells Fargo


In generating short ideas, The Friendly Bear has one golden rule. Find companies that
look "too good to be true". Once you find such a candidate, diligence the hell out of
them to figure out whether there is a "secret sauce", or whether you're looking at yet
another example of Wall Street trying to convince you that something is "disruptive", when
it already failed in the past.


In many ways, BoFI Holding (NASDAQ:BOFI) is perhaps the textbook example of this
phenomenon. This has been one of the best-performing bank stocks on the planet over
the past several years. It boasts industry-leading metrics on about every front - net interest
margin, return on assets, return on equity, efficiency ratio, and of course, stock price
return.

And the company's CEO (and his cult-like shareholders) would have you believe that
BOFI is doing all these things while taking zero risk. The sell-side defenders, such as Bob
Ramsey from FBR, are quick to point to trailing charge-off data as further evidence of
BOFI's exemplary underwriting abilities.


So kudos to Peter Eavis over at The New York Times for beginning to uncover what lies
beneath BOFI's loan book.


If, after reading the NYT article, you continue to believe that BOFI's "competitive
advantage" is its "branchless business model" and "data-driven analytical abilities", then
you are in great luck. We know of a rich and generous prince from the nation of Zamunda
who inherited $100 million and has decided to dole out $20 million to the first five people
that respond to his email offer. All you have to do to claim your money is wire him $1
million today so that he can establish a financial relationship with you, and after that you
will be on your way to riches...

The Friendly Bear has now pored through hundreds of loans that BOFI has written over
the past several years, and is highly confident that the company's loans are anything BUT
low-risk.


Our analysis of these loans lead us to believe that BOFI is:


The lender of choice to home flippers and other speculators - a behavior that resulted
in the failure of its "predecessors" Indymac and Thornburg (i.e., allowing borrowers to
borrow against existing properties, regardless of current lien status, in order to buy
additional investment properties).
Making loans to foreign nationals that hail from countries that other US banks have put
on the "Do not Touch" list for various geopolitical risk reasons.
Making loans to individuals who are "unsavory" in nature and hardly appear credit-
worthy for multi-million dollar loans.
Utilizing complex "pledge" arrangements to massage its LTVs.
Using a network of brokers to originate these loans that is just asking for trouble down
the line.


Based on our review of hundreds of BOFI's loans, there is also a 90% probability that this
mysterious foreign national Zamundan prince is financed by a BOFI loan, as he fits right
into their "Common Sense Underwriting" niche.


The niche includes individuals who claim to be sitting on robust offshore assets, have an
ability to put down millions of dollars towards a home purchase in the United States, are
looking to borrow at only a 50% LTV (or lower), yet are willing to pay a 5%+ interest rate
(~2x the market rate) on a 5/1 ARM for this privilege.


How could this loan make any economic sense to anyone? An individual looking to buy a
$10M home, cash-rich to the tune of $5M (i.e., with that kind of cash, he probably has a
real bank account with a relationship bank such as HSBC or JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)), yet
his relationship bank (that knows him because he keeps his primary bank account there)
won't provide financing for a 50% LTV loan at a 2.5% rate, so he ends up going to a
mortgage broker who puts him into a BOFI loan at a 5% rate (because yes, contrary to
what you may believe, almost all of BOFI's on-balance sheet loans are sourced through
mortgage brokers, which becomes abundantly clear when you sift through county
records).


So either his mortgage broker is:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3473736-new-york-times-scratched-surface-bofi-holding 4/40


Terrible at his job (unlikely, but maybe - in which case, the borrower should
immediately refinance this awful loan)
Getting paid extra by BOFI to originate loans (this would be a real compliance
problem, but we doubt this)
Or, there is something so unsavory about this borrower's profile that his relationship
bank would not touch him as a credit


In other words, BOFI's supposedly low-LTV loans at extremely high interest rates are, by
definition, economically irrational. Unless, of course, there is more to the story...


"Economically Irrational" Loans


In the NYT piece, the CEO of BOFI finally publicly admitted that the average rate BOFI
earns on its mortgage is ~5%, which is a 200bps spread to First Republic Bank
(NYSE:FRC) (we actually think First Republic rates can be even more competitive than
the 3% quoted in the NYT on an LTV apples-to-apples basis). This is the only metric that
really matters on BOFI in terms of its outperformance versus peers.


In other words, this is not Bank of Internet. This is Bank of Non-QM Mortgages.


BOFI earns more because it gets juicier yields on its mortgages. Not because of its
branchless model (the branchless cost savings are offset by its higher cost of deposits.
The "secret sauce" is ALL ABOUT THE LOANS... but in the case of BOFI, the secret
sauce is spoiled and mildewed.


Despite getting these juicier yields and growing at a reckless pace, BOFI reserves as if its
loans are higher-quality than First Republic's. So who are these "risk-free suckers" paying
a massive premium for a lower-LTV loan?


If BOFI's loan book had a soundtrack, it would be Sarah McLachlan's hit song "Building a
Mystery". Because as we analyze the company's loans one by one, by digging through
county records, almost every single loan leads us to ask more questions.


In some instances, we wonder how BOFI could have ever thought someone with heaps of
existing debt, tax liens, gambling debt, an inability to put up more cash at closing, or a
history of bankruptcy/foreclosure could have ever been credit-worthy for a multi-million
dollar loan.


In other instances, we wonder why borrowers able to make very large cash down
payments on homes in excess of $5MM in value would turn to BOFI for loans at rates 2x
above market, despite the very low LTVs on their properties.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRC
5/23/2018 The New York Times Has Only Scratched The Surface On BofI Holding... - BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ:BOFI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3473736-new-york-times-scratched-surface-bofi-holding 5/40


The former type of borrower is less of a mystery - BOFI is just rolling the dice and claiming
its protection is a low LTV. Are those LTVs really as rock-solid for properties in excess of
$5MM in value? And for all the cash-out refinancing transactions BOFI does (where an
appraisal value of a home cannot be tied to the purchase price), how is the company
getting comfortable on LTVs? What appraisal value is it relying on? When you make a $5+
million loan against a property such as this one, you have to wonder how BOFI was able
to get comfortable with the underlying asset value, given that this property has been on
and off the market since 2013, and no one has been willing to buy it.


The latter type of borrower is more of a mystery, as it suggests there is some compliance
reason that these borrowers are unpalatable to traditional high net worth lenders such as
First Republic. One potential reason is that other banks do not want to take the risk of
opening a bank account for these clients, but BOFI is willing to step in to do so.


Both categories suggest that the company is taking a lot of risk in its book. Yet, the NYT
points out that BOFI reserves at a lower rate than First Republic, a bank that The New
York Times suggests has a better borrower base. So, what gives?


We can't help but wonder how at least half of the loans that cross the desk of the
BOFI origination team do not immediately trigger suspicious activity reports.


Is BOFI just willing to underwrite "off-the-books" income that other lenders won't consider?
This would help explain how the company has made so many loans to so many unsavory
characters (as outlined in the NYT piece). Unsavory characters likely have many reasons
for "complex" finances that preclude them from qualifying for mortgages on an income
basis. If you're running a ponzi scheme, you probably don't have "straightforward"
finances.


Of course, this type of "asset-based" lending is also the basis for how mortgage fraud
takes place - when unsavory characters that lack traditional documentation are able to
qualify for loans that they have no intention of ever paying off. This type of lending is
subject to various forms of mortgage fraud that often goes undetected until the tide goes
out on a housing market.


We are NOT claiming this is happening to BOFI (although, given the company's pace of
growth, it seems unavoidable). We simply point out that "asset depletion"-style loans and
cash-out refinancing loans are subject to far more fraud risks (appraisal fraud, etc.) than a
straightforward purchase financing, ESPECIALLY when the lender is using "alt doc"
methods.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3473736-new-york-times-scratched-surface-bofi-holding 6/40


With an efficiency ratio of <35%, we doubt there is even enough staff at BOFI to properly
review the suspicious activity reports that should (in our view) accompany almost every
loan the bank is holding on its balance sheet. We think there are at most 10-12 people
working in compliance at this company. Relationship banks that have far less "know your
customer" (KYC) risk staff compliance organizations in the 100+ person range.


Internal Auditor Turnover Highly Problematic


Recent developments in the company's internal regulatory compliance division give us
even more pause in light of our findings. We think this stock has become one of the most
dangerous ones in the market today. We believe that long-term shareholders are sitting on
massive capital gains, and therefore, are unwilling to part with their shares. We think these
shareholders should pay close attention to the recent NYT article written on the company
that highlights damning turnover at the organization and that suggest trouble is on the
way.


In the recent NYT piece, we noted that two members of the company's internal audit team
appear to have left in recent months. Based on our review of LinkedIn job profiles and
postings, one of them appears to be the former head of the internal audit department, and
the other appears to be a former FINRA regulator and also a former member of the
internal audit department, suggesting that this individual should have a pretty good
sense of when wrongdoing is taking place in a financial institution. The department
appears to span ~4-5 individuals, based on our LinkedIn checks.


Keep in mind that these departures did not occur in a vacuum - instead, they occurred
after short reports have questioned the bank's disclosures, lending activities, business
practices, and shift in auditor back in 2013.


We were particularly troubled by the commentary in the NYT article that suggested one of
the former internal auditors (who, we again note, was formerly a regulator at FINRA) has
hired an employment attorney (who lists whistleblowing as one of her practice areas).
Even more concerning is that this attorney claims to be communicating with federal
government bank regulators in the NYT piece.


Why would half of the internal audit team turn over around the same time BOFI
would have been going through its bank exam process? And why did one of the
former audit employees who left see the need to hire an employment attorney who
then contacted the Federal government? This fact pattern is so damning, yet seems
to have been missed by the BOFI bulls.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3473736-new-york-times-scratched-surface-bofi-holding 7/40


Given our review of BOFI's loan book, its "economically irrational loans", and the nature of
its borrowers, we think that the departure of key audit staff suggests there may be trouble
brewing within the management controls at this organization.


At the very least, we would not be surprised if regulators have already asked BOFI to slow
down its growth as part of providing it approval on the H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) deal. If this
is the case, given BOFI's lofty bank multiple, expect the valuation to meaningfully correct
in the coming quarters, as it will also need to slow growth in order to safely absorb the
influx of deposits from the H&R Block deal. We therefore think it is an opportune time for
existing shareholders to get out of the way before any public revelations are made
regarding the claims of these internal audit staff members.


We can only speculate on what may have led a former regulator and audit staff member to
hire an employment attorney to approach the OCC. One of the most glaring risks we could
think of is that BOFI has made a loan to someone on the OFAC list through its foreign
national lending program. Our review of loan documents suggests the company has a
high degree of willingness to lend to limited liability companies ("LLC"), which creates an
added layer of uncertainty, as BOFI may not be sure who is behind the LLC.


Given the bank's reserves are also a joke (we would have been more professional with
our characterization if it were not for the fact that management appears to use the rather
"rigorous" approach of holding reserves flat at the same absolute number every quarter,
despite the massive loan growth), there is also some chance that internal auditors found
issues with this metric.


Regardless of reason, we think that the departure of two auditors, combined with
the hiring of an employment attorney should terrify any BOFI long investor, given
the nature of the company's business practices that are slowly beginning to
emerge.


Based on our review of public records, conversations with mortgage brokers, and review
of online materials, we strongly suspect that BOFI's foreign national program includes
countries such as Russia and the Ukraine that are currently under US sanctions. For
example, we found evidence in public records that BOFI does business with this broker in
South Florida, which lists the flags it covers under its foreign national lending practice on
its website:

These types of loans are at high risk of inadvertently running afoul of banking laws. Such
loans require extensive upfront due diligence and ongoing monitoring - something we
think BOFI is understaffed to handle. So we think the risks inherent at this company today
are grave for anyone long at a valuation of 22.5x trailing earnings.


As Garrabrants claims in the NYT article, there is nothing inherently sinister about making
foreign national loans. We wonder, then, why the company continues to insist that its loan
book consists of mostly Western Europeans and Canadians, rather than admitting that it is
regularly dabbling in loans to borrowers from exceptionally high-risk jurisdictions.


Other banks indeed engage in foreign national lending, such as BAC Florida. However, we
note that BAC Florida appears to be staying clear of making loans to many of the
jurisdictions that BOFI has recently been emphasizing:

SEC FOIA Response Related to Investigations


We have one more piece of evidence which suggests that another government agency
may have issues with BOFI. FOIA requests have been submitted to the SEC over the past
few months, requesting any documentation pertaining to SEC investigations of BOFI. The
response had come back as null and void all the way up until August 2015, at which time
the SEC exercised the "Law Enforcement Exemption", in which it indicated that it DID
have documents responsive to the FOIA request, but that providing said documents would
potentially interfere with ongoing law enforcement pertaining to BOFI.


Direct Excerpt from SEC FOIA Request:

We are withholding records that may be responsive to your request under 5 U.S.C. §
552(7), 17 CFR § 200.80(7)(i). This exemption protects from disclosure records
compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be
expected to interfere with enforcement activities. Since Exemption 7 protects the
records from disclosure, we have not determined if other exemptions apply.
Therefore, we reserve the right to assert other exemptions when Exemption 7 no
longer applies.


While the SEC's response in no way confirms or denies the existence of an
investigation, the SEC FOIA was pinged frequently enough that we suspect the shift
in language from "there are no records responsive to your request" to "Exemption
7" suggests that there is potentially an ongoing SEC investigation of BOFI.


We can think of a myriad of reasons the SEC would be looking into BOFI, i.e., how the
company presents its LTVs (we discuss this below), its lack of disclosures around its non-
QM lending risk factors, or maybe even potentially issues that were flagged by former
internal audit staff and reported by their attorneys to the SEC.


The combination of an opaque loan book and disclosures, the questionable
departure of internal audit staff, the hiring of an employment attorney, and the SEC
FOIA response all suggest to us that trouble is brewing at BOFI.


The Fundamental Short Case Revisited


The overarching short case around BOFI is, at this point, well known (high-risk loans,
disloyal depositors, interest rate sensitivity, and massive BSA/AML risks in both the loan
book and now the prepaid business). We will not rehash the short case.


Garrabrants's defense at this point appears to be BOFI's low LTVs (which we already
question, given the evidence we found of numerous "pledged collateral" loans).


It would be one thing to rely on low-LTVs if BOFI were lending to high-quality borrowers.
But when you're lending to individuals with liens, other homes, and a history of defaults,
you have to wonder how the company will make good on paying interest to all of its
depositors, should borrowers decide to stop paying their mortgages. There are so many
second homes and investment properties in this portfolio that it will not take much of a
shock for borrowers to walk away from these mortgages.

Primary residences are stickier in that people likely want to stay in their own homes. But
investment properties that were acquired for the purposes of flipping tend to not be very
good loans when housing prices start turning - and these loans constitute a significant
portion of BOFI's loan book, based on our review of the company's loans.


BOFI has been able to turn itself into a massive mortgage-backed securities hedge fund
over the past two years (really starting in January 2014 - prior to that date, this bank was
just a well-timed purchase of a securities book).


The problem with this model (like with any "hedge fund" model) is that it faces severe
liquidity constraints in the face of asset shocks. For BOFI, this would be a shock to
California housing prices. So how do housing shocks occur?


The Friendly Bear is just a bear, not an economist, so he will not attempt to answer the
question today. However, he does point readers to the recent volatility in the stock markets
as a sign that maybe we're getting closer to a housing correction - yet another fact that
should terrify any BOFI shareholder. Even FX volatility has meaningful repercussions for
the company, given that it is lending to borrowers whose primary assets are likely
denominated in rubles and yuan.


It is quite shocking to us that it took a series of short reports to finally get BOFI to fess up
to its lending activities publicly. It is even more shocking that the CEO has been willing to
go on the record with The New York Times and admit to his lending activities, yet still
remains unwilling to do so in his SEC filings.


The company's 10-K is one for the ages, leaving readers with almost no clue as to
BOFI's business model (non-QM lending, low/no-doc lending, foreign national
lending, lending to house flippers, "investment" property lending, heavy proportion
of refinancing transactions, so-called "pledged asset" loans, etc.).


Prior to this NYT piece, BOFI would have had you believe that its loan book consists of
"actors and musicians, investment bankers, and self-employed people with volatile
income".


The volatile income part is certainly true. For example, one loan we dug up includes this
man who, according to legal records, had a $4.2M loan with BOFI at the time of his
bankruptcy. The man was reported to have had $37.4M of debt at the time of his
bankruptcy filing (the full amount was unknown, due to a number of pending litigation
claims against him), and also lost his medical license in 2006 for cocaine use (something
that was public record prior to BOFI making a loan to him and would have likely been

caught in any due diligence check). The article is worth a read, as it paints a story of a
rather sordid set of personal financials. Again, while Garrabrants would have you believe
that the loans identified in the NYT piece are "one-off" in nature, our work suggests there
is a pattern to BOFI's lending.


We even question the bank's so-called "Business Checking Accounts" - as it is abundantly
clear, based on call reports filed with the FFIEC, that almost all of BOFI's deposits are
good old-fashioned interest-bearing, NON-TRANSACTION money market and savings
accounts (i.e., the kinds of accounts people use to earn high interest). Non-transaction
accounts, by definition, cannot be "checking" account in nature, due to limitations on how
frequently you can transact within them:


Loan-to-Values - A Tale of Pledges


The other thing that concerns us tremendously about BOFI is how the bank is presenting
its LTVs.


On the company's most recent earnings call, the CEO claimed the following:

"At June, 30, 2015, the weighted average loan-to-value of our entire portfolio of real
estate loans was 56%. The very low average loan-to-value ratios in our loan book
are not obscuring risk in the tails of our portfolio. For example, in the bank's entire
single-family loan portfolio, both jumbo size and below, excluding loans
originated for sale to the government sponsored entities, there is only one
loan that was originated at greater than 80% loan-to-value without a direct
pledge of liquid collateral that would reduce the collateral exposure levels
below 80%."


In other words, Garrabrants claimed that the bank is currently holding only one loan that
was originated at a greater-than-80% LTV that did not have LIQUID collateral held against
it (the definition of liquid collateral should be cash or cash equivalents to any reasonable
person).


In a quick review of recent loans BOFI wrote, we believe we have found 3 separate
examples of situations in which the company wrote > 80% LTV loans that appear to have
lacked any mention of liquid collateral in the mortgage documents recorded with the
county. These are all very high interest rate jumbo loans, suggesting they are all non-QM
and would have been held on balance sheet.


We did not see any mentions within the loan documents of any sort of liquid collateral
arrangement in any of these loans. If these purported arrangements do actually exist, we
think management should be reporting these arrangements in SEC filings. However, we
suspect that these arrangements are likely off-balance sheet in nature for good reason -
they are only in place to make BOFI's LTVs look stronger than they really are.


To provide hard evidence of our findings, all loans referenced below are included in the
link above.


Loan A - Home purchased for $1.17M in January 2014; BOFI provided $1.05M loan
against it (90% LTV)


Loan B - Home tax assessment was last $799,876; according to Zillow (NASDAQ:Z),
BOFI wrote them mortgage for $1.135M (suggests well north of 100% LTV). The home
has no record of being sold - this one appears to be a pure "cash-out" refinancing
transaction, where the borrower just wanted to take money out against a home owned
outright - so we have no way to know how BOFI determined appraisal value for purposes

of LTV calculation, and can only rely on the tax assessment. On that basis, the LTV looks
crazy. Oh, and by the way, Zillow's estimate for the home value is far below the tax
assessment.


Loan C - Home purchased for $1.843M in August 2014; BOFI provided $1.61M loan
against it (87% LTV). We believe BOFI will attempt to defend the LTV on this loan by
pointing people to a "pledged collateral" arrangement associated with the loan. We
scoured county records and found another property (a condo) owned by the same
borrower in which BOFI took out a lien against their condo at the same time as issuing this
87% LTV loan. The size of the lien applied to the condo is identical to the purchase
mortgage provided on the $1.843M home, and the lien occurred around the same time.
We therefore believe this is an example of a "pledged collateral" loan in which the
company asks borrowers to "pledge collateral" in exchange for juicing its LTV.


We note that the condo that appears to be wrapped into this convoluted "pledge"
agreement appears to already have at least one lien against it from a different bank. We
further note that there is nothing "liquid" about collateral pledged in the form of a house
(that may even have a preexisting lien against it!). A home is one of the most illiquid forms
of collateral... so we again question the claims BOFI is making regarding its supposedly
"liquid" pledged collateral.


Can anyone help us understand how the accounting worked on this loan? We are not
questioning the credit profile of any of these borrowers, as we have no idea what their
credit profiles looked like - we are simply using these loans as examples of instances in
which LTVs appear to be far higher than 80% and where there appears to be no public
record suggesting any liquid pledged collateral arrangement exists.


BOFI is letting borrowers leverage the equity in one home to go and buy a second home...
and disclosing none of this to investors. Sounds a lot like the go-go lending standards of
2007 to us. What would stop these borrowers from defaulting on the high-LTV loan
in a downturn, but sticking with the original property? In this instance, wouldn't
BOFI take a loss on the high-LTV property until the second home is sold? Does
BOFI have the right to force people to sell down homes? This seems highly
unenforceable in the California court system...


We are quite sure that within these 3 examples alone, we have refuted BOFI's claim that it
has only made one loan at a greater-than-80% LTV without liquid collateral, given there is
no mention of liquid collateral in any of these documents. Furthermore, even if a liquid

collateral agreement was included in these loans, we will never know if the agreements
allowed the borrowers eventual release, in which case, the agreements defeat the
purpose of reducing LTV.


Keep in mind that we found many other loans just like these, and if we were able to so
quickly find >80% LTV loans, we do question the CEO's comment on the call that only one
has ever been made in the absence of liquid collateral - collateral that, mind you, BOFI
shareholders may very well have no control over, as we outline below...


This excerpt below is taken directly from a BOFI loan, and appears to highlight the
problems with taking "pledged collateral"... in this instance, the borrowers initially pledged
a home they owned (the home identified as Parcel II) in order to qualify for a mortgage on
the home identified in Parcel I.


Keep in mind that Parcel II happens to be a property that already has a BOFI lien against
it (we found records of a $1.762M loan made by BOFI to the borrowers against Parcel II
dating back to November 2013)... in other words, the company was letting these
borrowers pledge the equity in a home with an existing BOFI lien to go out and buy
another home using - you guessed it - BOFI financing. But even more absurd than that
is that BOFI's custody over the collateral in Parcel II was set to expire after the
borrower made 6 on-time payments… in other words, after six months of on-time
payments, BOFI shareholders would have had no collateral backing up this loan:

If you are as confused as we are by this, don't feel bad. The complexity embedded in
these loans gave us the spins, and speaks to the problems in this loan book.


Weren't complex structured loans the reason for the last housing crisis? We should have
also mentioned that these same borrowers appear to have one more lien outstanding with
BOFI on a home purchased back in early 2013.


Again, we come back to the opening quote in this article regarding irrational
lenders. Why was there ever a need for this complex set of transactions?


Where Does BOFI Find its Borrowers?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3473736-new-york-times-scratched-surface-bofi-holding 17/40


Perhaps it is the source of BOFI's loans that creates all these mysteries. In the NYT piece,
Garrabrants defended BOFI's practices saying that "you would easily be able to find
lawsuits and an occasional legal issue if you scanned First Republic or another bank with
high-net worth borrowers as well".


While we are purely speculating here, we are pretty sure that First Republic is not doing
business with brokers such as Drop Mortgage. Keep reading to find out why...


We came across Drop Mortgage while reading this article in The Wall Street Journal. The
title of the article is "Call it a Comeback for Risky Home Buyers". In the article, a borrower
named Malcolm Davies is profiled. This borrower claims to have received a mortgage from
a firm called Drop Mortgage that is run by an individual named Jonathan Maddux.
Somehow, BOFI managed to keep its name out of the WSJ article, and we have no idea
how that happened, because... you guessed it - according to county records, BOFI is the
lender of record on the Davies loan, with Drop Mortgage acting purely as the
mortgage broker.


Mr. Maddux makes an appearance in multiple BOFI loans that we have gone through
spanning several years. For example, Loan C profiled above is also a Maddux-originated
loan (you can see this on the broker origination signature portion of the page).

So what is the relevance of Mr. Maddux ?


In addition to running Drop Mortgage, Mr. Maddux earned fame some years ago by
forming the company Youwalkaway.com. The purpose of this website is to help
homeowners conduct a strategic default.


According to his website (that may or may not currently be live), "you will immediately
know the exact amount of days you have to live in your house payment free. We stay on
top of your walk away plan and keep you up to date with weekly progress emails. We also
will notify you if the lender is taking longer than expected subsequently giving you more
time in your home payment free."


Sounds like the exact type of broker that an esteemed institution such as First
Republic would want to be doing business with, right? A broker who started a
website dedicated to helping individuals default on mortgages? Isn't a
"Youwalkaway" philosophy exactly the philosophy any rational banker would want
to align himself with?

Again, we bring you back to the first quote in this article: "Irrational lenders come and
go - mostly, they go!"


Why short BOFI when others have lost money so far?


So what has changed that makes the Friendly Bear think that the short is going to finally
work? As the bank's CEO astutely points out in the recent NYT piece, short sellers have
taken pretty serious losses on their BOFI positions. He went as far as describing his bank
as an "earnings juggernaut".


Describing your bank as an earnings juggernaut is pretty much music to the ears of any
bank short seller (see the quote at the end of this article, which we think really captures
the spirit of this type of aggressive posturing).

Bank executives who try to juice the earnings at all costs don't just hit the wall - they fall
hard, and spectacularly so.


Management has now run out of bogeymen to use as tactics to scare short sellers. The
bag of tricks is now empty. The Block deal is closed. Reserves can't be taken down any
further. Juicing fee income to beat the quarter will eventually fail as a tactic. It is highly
unlikely loan growth accelerates from here, unless the bank is really looking to draw more
attention from regulators. These are the obvious reasons why any long should be selling -
what else is left to play for now?


Some people (including, in our view, management) viewed the closing of the H&R Block
deal as the "end of the short thesis" on BOFI. We think it is just the beginning.


We are guessing that there has been little to no short covering since the H&R Block deal
closed. In fact, we think short interest may actually increase in the stock as a result of this
deal.


What the regulators have gone and done is taken a very high-risk bank with very illiquid
loans, and mixed into it a very high-risk prepaid product that is fraught with BSA/AML
risks. In many ways, the regulators have turned BOFI into an even better short candidate -
because there are, unfortunately, so many ways for the bank to make a mistake at this
stage.


BOFI had historically, in our view, benefited from a form of "regulatory arbitrage". While big
banks such as Citi (NYSE:C), HSBC, JPMorgan, and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) are
under the microscope with respect to their activities (even sneezing in the wrong direction
can end them in regulatory hot water), BOFI was small enough and irrelevant enough that
it managed to very rapidly grow itself into what is now a ~$6B asset bank, and do so
without drawing much attention from regulators. We think the regulatory approval of the
H&R Block deal accomplished two tasks.


First, it puts BOFI more squarely under the microscope of regulators due to the high-risk
prepaid product. Second, it let H&R Block shed this rather idiosyncratic bank asset that
had no business being part of a tax prep company. This was a regulatory win in some
respects. A high-risk asset that the regulators have had long-standing issues with was
tucked into a bank that has a matching risk profile, but is simultaneously systemically
unimportant.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3473736-new-york-times-scratched-surface-bofi-holding 21/40


As a condition for closing the recent H&R Block deal, BOFI publicly admitted that it was
subject to capital standards imposed by the OCC. We suspect that the bank has likely
been provided other non-public stipulations as part of this deal (including guidance around
tightening up borrower standards, reducing the bank's sky-high loan-to-deposit ratio, and
potential controls on the bank's unhinged recent growth rates). Either way, BOFI will need
to slow down growth in upcoming months if it wants to avoid losing the Durbin Act
exemption that provides it with distinct economic advantages (these advantages are
generally lost once a bank exceeds $10B in assets, and BOFI is not far off from that level
today)


Summary


We are intentionally refraining from providing a target price on BOFI shares, as we
ultimately believe that this is not even a business, but rather a massive levered mortgage
trade that is sitting on toxic assets with no reserves in place to guard against a turn in the
housing market.


A "valuation" for this company would be $40 per share (note, we wouldn't call this a
reasonable valuation, just a valuation that might be defensible in some benign economic
environment), representing a modest discount to other bank stocks, given the nature of
the loans and interest rate sensitivity. However, we think BOFI is likely to trade well below
these levels over time.


In the near term, the legal issues surrounding this company provide the short position with
a series of potential catalysts that we believe will cause a re-rating in the multiple, due to a
stepwise function down in growth. We would also not be surprised if the New York Times
article encourages other BOFI employees to step forward and approach regulators with
their concerns. Generally speaking, where there is smoke, there is fire. From what we can
see at BOFI today, the fire is already burning, and the question now is only how much of
the forest will turn to ashes. We think the NYT piece opened up a Pandora's box, and
there will be many more negative surprises to come.


We leave readers with this rather poignant quote that came to our minds after reading the
New York Times piece.

You realize that the "cult-like shareholders" are becoming nearly all institutional, right? Over the last year they've
increased their ownership to 79.30% and a good deal of shorts covered this week. In fact, that's up nearly 3% in just
the last 3 months.


I also took out two loans from this bank last year to examine the process. Although I have plenty of cash and a
healthy business they ran me through an extensive evaluation process. The first property was a cash-out deal for
which I already owned and the second one several months later was a purchase. In both cases they fully examined
the situation and required so much documentation that it almost made it not worth the time for me to get the loans.


Moreover, their underwriters appear to error in favor of BOFI's protection. For example, in my case, they wouldn't
consider rental income as qualified income for my loan unless I could provide a contract; even though I was able to
show payment history from the tenants. Fortunately for me it didn't matter and I just let it go however I think that your
assessment of how they're running a lose ship is pretty extreme.

Yes, I have been following this company for many years and have had both long, short, and long-short
positions along the way. I've made a lot of money from the performance of this company & it's stock and really
dislike the BS posts; to the point that I had to join Seeking Alpha. Back in the day, posts like this would cause
the stock to shed 10%+ however I think that this is less likely now that the shorts have been getting squeezed
by the increase in institutional investors. Last year I think that they had something like a 66% stake around
this time.

John - what was your rate on the two loans you took out? And what was the rates that others offered you?


28 Aug 2015, 08:54 AM


John_3.14159265359
Application date end of 5-2014 - 15y, 80% LTV 3.375%, cash-out 
Application date 8-2014 - 15y, 80% LTV 3.5%, new purchase


They are pretty competitive, the local bank fees (brick and mortar) were at least 2x as much and about 1/4%
higher in some cases. BOFI rates floated each day until you paid to lock the rate. I also received a small one-
time discount off of the fee for being a costco member. Their rate were also consistent with these rates:

BOFI is currently still holding the second loan.

I have a checking account at Bofi because, for me, it makes plenty of sense. I recommend them to anyone
that asks. I was long Bofi a while ago and ended up taking out a loan with them for our primary residence.
This wasn't a favor to the bank in which I was invested. I did it because they had the best rates. My wife and I
shopped for loans at local B&M banks and found BofI to be about a quarter point lower with closing costs
significantly reduced. That was about the only difference. All requirements/concerns/etc seemed to be the
same. As a matter of fact, we were pre-approved for more at a local bank.


There was a lot about this article I'd disagree with, but I'll leave it at that.


Reading this article, I'm not sure if I'm in the minority of Bofi borrowers or if the author is just trying to sink the
stock, but as both an account holder and borrower, I get the feeling it is the later.

should be able to get a rate of 3.25% 15yr or just under 4 for 30yr according to the latest rates found on a

Aldos_Snow: that's an interesting point re: the employee discount. I just went through their proxy and it looks
like they offer their employees "below market interest rates". Just looking at the K, it looks like the rates are
around 1%. Pretty interesting that they don't book any of these below market arrangements as compensation.

The #1 reason people walked away was because of no income / no down payment. That is the opposite
profile of a bofi portfolio borrower. 30% down (or way more) and solid provable income. There is no risk in that
borrower. Shorting their stock is a bad investment.

And yet, of the 40 or so cases handed out last month, BOFI had...wait for it....nada, not one. I just wrote an
article that will be published today highlighting / rebutting many of the claims made in this article. And, the
valuation is far from fat. Based on price to net interest income per share BOFI is trading about $3 under its
market value.

A few thoughts:


1) "It is quite shocking to us that it took a series of short reports to finally get BOFI to fess up to its lending activities
publicly." Yes, it's also shocking coke, KFC, and google are reluctant to publish every last detail of their soda, chicken,
and search recipes too.


2) I worry more about compliance than credit risk. For example, yeah, the fact that they appear to have an above
normal hit rate on criminals is alarming. And yet the criminal cases mentioned, and the associated loans, date back to
2012, i.e. a $5m loan to that Long Island guy in 2012 who was convicted jailed in 2013. What's missing? Credit
losses. BOFI's had a few borrowers go to jail - with no effect on credit.


You gonna claim they're crazy enough to hide losses on properties associated with criminals? Given the spotlight
that'd be there? Nah.


BOFI knows credit underwriting. You don't produce the record they have if otherwise. But sound credit policies are
much more black and white than compliance issues. I do find it plausible BOFI lives right at the compliance legal
edge.


But if their credit is sound your case stinks.


3) I think you're close to the truth when you attribute BOFI success to regulatory arb. I think it's more like this: the
supply of loans of the kind BOFI targets are limited and distributed. FRC is 10x larger than BOFI - they're too big for
this to be worth specializing in, especially if they consider it a compliance risk (for example big banks have mostly
stayed away from subprime auto finance even tho it's been very profitable for 20-30 years because it's a small,

distributed market that can put a banks reputation at risk, not worth it for a BAC). Conversely, smaller or brick and
mortar banks don't have the geographic reach and capabilities BOFI possesses. The strategy requires broad complex
capabilities in a small shop. I'm oversimplifying but you get the idea.


The best plausible scenario for you is that there's a compliance problem resulting in either a cease and desist that
removes a profitable flow of business or a fine or something. There's some smoke here with the compliance turnover,
but no fire. Nothing in particular you can point to. And since H&R Block involved lots of eyes on the bank, and the
thing was allowed to pass, good luck to you!


Otherwise BOFI keeps its "too good to be true" ROE for several more years before scale gradually dilutes it. Offset, of
course, by secular declines in deposit premiums paid compared to brick and mortars. And of course a lower efficiency
ratio should BOFI ever get more vanilla.


p.s. they've been lending in the manner you criticize for several years now - at what point does the absence of credit
losses speak for itself?


pps. good luck on your housing-shock-bust thesis. there's been one of those in the last 80 years and it happened in
very recent memory. i think we're vaccinated against reoccurrence for awhile.

It seems unlikely that the HRB transaction would have been approved if there were serious issues with BOFI's
handling of loans. BOFI were under the microscope for a long time before the HRB approval went through. And their
loan origination process for foreigners was examined recently without incident, according to the NYT article.


You can cherry pick doubtful characters from any bank's client base if you look hard enough.


You quote all the negatives from the NYT article, but then don't quote anything from the same article that counters
those negatives.


There may well be some issues with BOFI, as with any firm, but your article is so one-sided that it does not appear
credible.


p.s. interesting statement at the end of your piece, "The author makes no representation as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information set forth in this article "


28 Aug 2015, 09:34 AM


Brendan Rose, Contributor
Agreed. The stock reacted so strongly to the HRB approval not because HRB matters that much but because
of what it signaled about BOFI's core practices.


28 Aug 2015, 09:48 AM


James Melvin, Contributor
Agreed with both of you guys here. There are definitely some loans that went to bad people, but this is
inevitable when you make billions of dollars in loans. I find the first few paragraphs of arrogance and bashing

of the bulls representative of the article in general. I believe the over negative view portrayal of the company
does a huge disservice to any other trying to write their thesis.


I think the bottom line is that BOFI would not have done the H & R block deal where scrutiny was certain if
they really thought they were going to get in serious regulatory trouble. Most companies who find a great
niche in a market are not quick to make the niche and operations that service the niche abundantly clear as to
keep their strategy to themselves. The fact that the author at the end basically states that he does not certify
that anything he is saying is true is just an astonishing way to end an article making so many claims of
serious wrong doing.

Urgh. On second review, the reasoning in your piece is so much like high school gossip, full of malicious innuendo but
lacking evidence. Half of it you readily admit you are just making up or imagining. The so-called evidence you quote
isn't evidence of anything at all. There isn't a single piece of solid evidence of the systemic issues you claim in the
entire article.


To address just one piece of your speculation in the article - that if a large bank does not give someone a loan they
are therefore an intolerable loan risk and therefore BOFI is making risky loans - there are many reasons why a (large
or small) bank that is flexible, pays attention to detail, and weighs risks on a case by case basis, may safely fund a
loan that a large bank which follows a standardized and inflexible formula will not fund.


If you find real evidence of wrongdoing then please do let us know. Innuendo and speculation doesn't cut it though.

BOFI just completed an arduous FDIC review in order to acquire H&R Block. The concerns were addressed.


Note: Bank regulators blocked Republic from doing the same deal.


Shorts have been trying unsuccessfully to take down BOFI for years. This effort will be no different.

Sounds like the writer of this article is losing money and is not happy about it. Bofi seems to have a very low LTV on
all it's portfolio loans so I wouldn't worry about them ever losing money on these loans.

ALL banks are so regulated to death these days that I don't believe most of this article. This writer, notice is a short

Paraphrasing from a recent article on BofI:


"BofI is one of the lowest cost banks in the industry today. In the three months ended July 30, only 32.7% of BofI's net
revenue was consumed by operating expenses. That's almost twice as efficient as the average bank, which spent
60.6% of net revenue on expenses in the first quarter of 2015, according to FDIC data."


"This metric is known as the efficiency ratio. A lower number is better than a higher one because it means that a
greater share of revenue is left over to cover future loan losses, pay taxes, distribute to shareholders, and to boost
book value."


"There is also a relationship between a bank's efficiency ratio and its loan losses. Banks that operate more efficiently
also have a tendency to experience lower loan losses, and vice versa."


BofI articles like this one come after a nice run when shorts smell blood. They'd have been out of business long ago if
it was their operational DNA to practice banking as this article suggests.


Disclosure: I'm both a longtime customer and shareholder.

As BOFI top management is delivering such high performance growth and profit records, why doesn't BOFI's
competition employ the same banking techniques?


The answer must be other than lack of talent.


29 Aug 2015, 11:26 AM


Celan Bryant, Contributor
It's not about talent, it's about relationship building, who you know, your "book". BOFI's CEO is a veteran of
Goldman and McKinsey -- I suspect he's good at building relationships. And, since he's making a reputation
for banking rich "risky" people, the performance is going to get better.

Are you saying that in order to get an average loan rate that's higher than the competition they MUST be risky

31 Aug 2015, 08:23 AM


John_3.14159265359
You have to remember that everyone wants the best deal, criminal or not, and BOFI provides a great deal on
their product. Also, is a bank even allowed to discriminate against someone if their credit score, income, and
net worth meet their loan criteria? I would think that the only thing that would matter here would be if those
crimes related to their ability to repay their loan obligations. For that matter, there are people convicted of
crimes every day. It would be impossible to provide loans and not have customers that are eventually
convicted of something.

Celan, are you saying there are free lunches in this world? By the way, you seem quite sure of your

Celan Bryant, Contributor
Why are you putting words in my mouth? Free lunch? Who's getting a free lunch. This bank has employed
some masterful wealth management techniques.


In terms of my assertions, they come from cross checking company documents and FDIC reports. I rely on
facts, not "feelings". In terms of "forensic work", the FDIC has a great deal of data about this bank's loan
portfolio, even more than what's provided in their call report, 10K, and 10Q. What can I say, I like data.


And, I get the backhanded comment in terms of management.

Yes, I listen to management. I also listen to the analyst community grill management on earnings calls. I listen
to and read everything I can about this bank (and many others), especially reports from regulators like the
OCC. Then I cross reference that data with FDIC data, call reports, analyst research, etc.


If you're suggesting that management is corrupt and we can't trust them or the data they provide, well that's
another story. That said, there are no cases against BOFI management. There are, however, cases against
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citizens Bank, JP Morgan and many others. It seems to be a rights of
passage for the industry. And yet, as regulators pass out cases like candy, BOFI has none? I've been looking
(please if anyone finds any let me know). Even with the accusations about employee attorney's, turnover and
whistleblowers -- not one single case from regulators?


For the last time, all I want is for people to do their OWN research.


31 Aug 2015, 10:19 AM


205427
Not crooked but certainly riskier, unless you think rates are based on looks and personality.


02 Sep 2015, 10:19 PM


Celan Bryant, Contributor
Looks and personality? I don't know how to process that.


All the banks that have actual whistle-blower cases out on them TODAY should be considered "riskier" before
BOFI. Those banks with high notional interest rate swaps are also "riskier". The 8 banks that have been
designated as globally systemically important banks, "GSIBs" could also be considered "more risky" -- they
are under increased regulatory scrutiny and must start paying a capital surcharge in 2016. Point is, risk is
relative, and BoFIs "rich risky people" problem is at the bottom of the list.


02 Sep 2015, 11:02 PM


Brendan Rose, Contributor
205427 and Stockmarketguy: If rates of return perfectly and proportionately reflect an asset's riskiness then
why are you wasting your time on stock message boards.


If you want to understand BOFI here's what you gotta do: 
1) Start in 2005 and track the evolution of BOFI's portfolio and strategy over time, i.e. seasoned low yield loan
purchases when the bubble was inflating, a sharp move into high grade MBS when those markets broke
down, a promise to build origination channels in search of unusually good risk/rewards when the housing
market normalizes, and then here we are today. 
2) Remember that this bank is run by real flesh and blood human beings whose competence and sanity aren't
going to radically change over time. 
3) Who mostly are located in one place in Cali. 
4) Which is small enough that mgmt can easily oversee the whole thing.


Good, small orgs don't just go insane overnight, but that's what bears bet happened.

Some considerations: 
1) Although this does occur, lending is a commodity. The dollars coming from BOFI are no different than the
dollars coming from anywhere else. There is no stickiness to the relationships at BOFI. 
2) You mean like the CEO, CFO, and other numerous execs that all held VP positions at places like IndyMac
or failed S&Ls? 
3) ~67% of their mortgage book is in CA, which is concentrated risk in a real estate market that is nearing
2006 peak levels.

Very good article, made me think about my long position more deeply. I agree, that when you see more red flags in a

make sense at all. I think short sellers are mostly very smart people, and do more thorough research, also stocks with
high short float decline in the end. Thanks again

Celan Bryant, Contributor
1) If you select stocks from reading SA comments, you're in trouble.  
2) You know just as much as the author. 
3) And that's all he did, "venture" and "guess".


That said, I think you and everyone else that wants to short, should. Just do your own homework first. Don't
go by comments, or "paid" research posing as a real analysis.


By the way, where is this guy? No comments? No, nothing?? Just a disclosure that says "The author makes
no representation as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth in this article and
undertakes no duty to update its contents."


What's even more interesting is that folks don't see that, they just skim over it. Someone writes a damning
article about a stock saying its customers and employees are crooked, then writes a disclaimer saying that it
may all be false, and never responds to a single comment about the piece? Does that sound normal?


It does if you're being paid.


I just hope that those people really looking for an honest assessment do their homework. Don't make an
investment decision based on me or Friendly Bear or any of the comments here. This is a very transparent
industry due to regulation and you don't need to walk on faith.

C) If he is just a crazy roid head, what does it say about BOFI that they would hire such a person as an

Fitness isn't the tell. Showiness is. The tanning, the desire to post glam shots and video online, etc.

That doesn't mean he's incompetent or even that he's lying. But it could mean that he's likely to see some
fuzzy compliance thing as his opportunity to shine; react disproportionately; and then respond aggressively
when fired.


Certainly I'd be more worried if the whistleblower was a 50 year old pencil necked accountant.

Nope, not what I said. But since you brought it up, the psychological profile of men who artificially tan is
certainly statistically different than the norm. They tend to be extraverted, for example.


Extraversion correlates w/ all sorts of good things. But also aggression and impulsiveness.


So it's sensible to use these clues to guess at what's going on.


This guy doesn't just tan, he posts videos of himself doing bicep curls on the internet. On the other hand he
did very well in school, etc. Kinda reminds me of the personality type that ends up on the Bachelor TV show
(my wife watches). Not criminal psychopaths, but attention w'horing, quick to anger, entitled, etc.

The strongest evidence in the plaintiffs favor: ball's resignation, and the difficulty of alleging such a volume of
stuff that's not inconsistent w/ what's already known if it weren't true (not to mention the rarity of the balls
necessary to lie that savagely).


The strongest evidence in BOFI's favor: erhart's talked to every bureaucrat in the US in the last 6 months and
no one cares. His lawyer was in direct correspondence w/ the OCC who approved the H&R Block acquisition
on 9/1/13.


One puzzle: Erhart begins work in 9/13, reports a minor incident in 12/13, he sees nothing for a year, and
then starts going buckwild in 12/14 right when the short report was published.

I think it's possible that BOFI has genuine compliance problems, and that Erhart is acting in bad faith, and
possibly tied to shorts. In other words, BOFI had issues, shorts learned of it, shorted the stock, it moved
against them, they contacted insiders like Erhart (BOFI says many current and former employees were
contacted), Erhart sincerely confirms he's seen bad stuff, and they encourage him (somehow) to intensify the
hunt for more.


I don't know how else to fit my belief that Erhart can't have lied about everything w/ the fact that regulators
investigated his charges and vindicated BOFI, concretely, by passing the H&R Block deal.

As credible a theory as I can think of in this very strange situation. Too strange for me to play. I am a smart
enough investor to know when I don't know enough.

You want to know what's going on here?


A low performing, disgruntled employee wanted to get back at his employer and succeeded with the help of
an aggressive short-selling community. If there's a story here, that's what it is. Nothing more.


So, BOFI's going up -- you can count on it. The CEO assured a huge earnings surprise on October 29th so
this isn't speculation.


The CEO also announced that BOFI will be going after Erhart legally as well as the band of short-sellers
around him that coordinated this effort. A example will be made.


This was a planned effort on baseless accusations that, for the record, have already been discussed with the
OCC, SEC, FDIC, etc. They aren't listening. Can you really call yourself a whistleblower if your whistle has no
sound? No, this is disgruntled employee, let's call him what he is. The suit actually says Erhart (a junior
auditor) had exhausted all regulatory channels prior to filing and the suit was made as a last resort. Indeed,
Erhart was working for BOFI and discussed his issues with the OCC back in March. Nothing came of it. And,
Erhart didn't get fired. He left on medical leave and never came back. Seriously?


I've advised all my subscribers to channel the movie Trading Places and buy up. You should too.

Hope you apologized for such a recommendation. So much for the stock split thesis.

You know a big bank is scared when they take notice of the little guy with better numbers and pull one of the owed
favors from a NYT hack.


Blogs like this should be moderated and stopped.


As someone who was in the mortgage business for a long time, I can tell you that this bank is exactly what we need.
This bank is doing everything I've been telling people to do for years. I am not a banker, nor do I have any interest in
starting my own. I applaud this company.


People forget, it wasn't the rich with 60% debt that made the bubble, it was the poor who used the government to
blackmail banks into giving them loans they could not afford.

The blog is a disruptive misleading attempt to come out of a short position. Plain and simple. Banks today are
monitored to the nth degree. He must be going to lose a lot of money to write a fairy tale that long.

"Can anyone help us understand how the accounting worked on this loan?"


In looking at your description of Loan C it would appear that the borrower provided a second mortgage on condo
referenced as additional collateral for the $1.61 mil loan. As you did not provide the value of the condo or the other
lien on it, it is impossible to tell if there was sufficient residual equity to take the total LTV down below 80%. Just that
BOFI says it did. So to make your point stick, I guess you would have to say that BOFI is lying.

Timely sells ahead of a massive drop. Seems to happen frequently with the lathered up bulls I call out.

Just a comment to the wise, I got rejected by Bofi for my home purchase but tried Wells Fargo which I had a short
sale 4 years ago and got approved by them. BofI is not giving money away that easy, go figure.

I sold a house last year and the buyer financed via BOFI ($1 million down on a $2.56 mil purchase) probably a very
typical BOFI borrower, multiple business owner, had some shady stuff viewable online with some failed business stuff

in the past however with 40% down pretty tough for BOFI to get in trouble isn't it. Also i know for a fact that the
underwriting was no walk in the park it certainly wasn't anything like getting a (likely no down) loan in 2003-2006 era.
Shorts timed this scam perfectly, the charges are so asinine (three borrowers are responsible for 40% of
deposits..wrong) and the complaint so vague that this attorney has to be in on it because she isn't going to recover
anything or get a settlement. What are Plaintiffs damages ? There are none. After the call with Greg refuting each and
every item, basically pre-releasing steller earnings etc. if hes lying and BOFI is all one massive fraud Greg is going to
spend a very long time in jail..what are the odds of that vs. the short case, disgruntled ex employee body builder
healthy young guy who took medical leave due to "stress".

Another highly biased comment filled with assumptions and speculation from a member with 1 comment. I
swear BOFI is the only stock in 3 years on this site that is riddled with the notorious 1 comment members with
highly unsubstantiated claims and "personal experiences." It is easy to get caught up with others opinion, but
fundamental always prevail in the long run.
