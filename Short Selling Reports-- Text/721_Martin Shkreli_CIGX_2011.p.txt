Star Scientific: Widely Shorted for Good Reason
Jun. 5, 2011 8:38 AM ET92 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


Star Scientific (CIGX) is a tobacco/healthcare hybrid company trading at 5.26 per share.
There are 134 million shares, resulting in a $700+ million market cap. It is my opinion that
the fair value for all of CIGX shares is $5 to $10 million, 90%+ less than current prices.


Star has a few lines of businesses. They sell a line of “snuff” products which generate less
than $1 million in annual sales and have done so for years. These products are sold at
negative gross margin. I suspect the company has failed to generate meaningful revenue
for these products due to intense competition with Big Tobacco. The value of this product
is perhaps $1 million.


Star’s second line of business is a “smoking alternative dietary supplement” designed to
help smokers quit. The product sold $63,000 in 2010. It is important to note the failure of
this business because it will help you judge management’s new endeavors. This is a
worthless product.


Star’s next line of business was prosecuting a safer tobacco production patent. Star sued
RJR and lost in 2009. An appeal decision is coming shortly and may be a catalyst for the
stock. Even if you assume there is a small % chance of victory, the present value of this
asset is small, perhaps a few million value "lotto ticket".


Star is developing a new nutraceutical based on anatabine, which is found in tobacco and
food. Claims of efficacy for Alzheimer’s disease are the new story which has Star’s stock
at 52 week highs. I will address anatabine in detail shortly.


Unlike similar small-cap shorts we are active in, management is very unique at Star
Scientific. The CEO, Jonnie Williams, earns $1,000,000 per year in base salary. Williams
has been at Star for over a decade (1999). Williams routinely participates in secondary
offerings of Star stock and owns about 15% of the shares outstanding. Williams and
Francis O’Donnell own an airplane company that Star is a major customer (only
customer?) of. You might recognize Francis O’Donnell, who is a Florida based biotech
executive, formerly CEO of BioVest, a successful MSMB short (MSMB is the fund
company I manage). The duo also receives a royalty on the sale of any Star products. In a
remarkable display of self-dealing, Star pays the entity Williams owns and controls ~1.5
million per year for at least the last three years.

Star has a diehard allegiance of retail investors who are attracted to the sub-$5 share
price and seemingly large tobacco and Alzheimer’s markets. A sub-$5 share price is not
the key to financial success. This optical illusion results in illogical investor losses--one is
better off buying shares of undervalued companies like Biomarin (NASDAQ:BMRN) or
Onyx (NASDAQ:ONXX). Always think in terms of market cap, not share price. Ask
yourself: Is CIGX worth $700 million? Cover up the market cap and try to figure out what
you think it is worth, independent of the stock market. If you guessed $2 billion, buy the
stock. If you came up with less than $50m like I did, stay away or short.


I hope I’ve established why the current snuff business appears worthless; the facts around
the RJR case will be detailed in an appendix, but in general it’s a long shot for an appeal
of a patent case to be heard or to be a valuable exercise. It is apparent the nutraceutical
business is not worth anything, and Star management team is of a questionable nature,
not only with respect to their execution, but also their ethical practices.


The final piece of analysis is—are anatabine nutraceutical and pharmaceuticals worth
anything?


My opinion is a conclusive no. The chemical structure of anatabine is a demethylated
nicotine.


It is highly unlikely that nicotine and anatabine have different properties. Nicotine has
interesting properties in vitro and in vivo, but the millions, if not billions of users of nicotine
know exactly what its properties are. It is highly unlikely anatabine and nicotine have
beneficial properties beyond those already known. It is known that these agents are
ligands for nicotine receptors, which have been implicated in Alzheimer’s. Nevertheless,
clinical trials by Comentis, Memory/Roche and Targacept have revealed these products to
not be meaningful pharmaceutical agents. Star’s lack of success in nutraceuticals bodes
poorly for their new endeavor. Their complete lack of experience in pharmaceuticals
makes it unlikely the company will succeed there.


Star is out of cash. Star is actually always out of cash, and finances ‘hand to mouth’,
usually from their CEO and PIPE players.


What will make the stock go down? I don’t know, in short. I have succeeded in shorting
stocks like this by initiating front-end weighted VWAP entries and exits. Timing can be
difficult for shorts like this. I suspect the stock may remain overvalued for some time.
Continued meager sales and financings may be useful. Weak product launches or failure
to progress in clinical trials may also be catalysts for Star’s price to fall. I’m not so
concerned with when it will happen, as I’m pretty sure it will.

One of the unique aspects of this company is that the promising compound Anatabine is already being sold via
CIGrx.com, which is enabling fund managers to actually conduct mini-tests on the compound themselves. I believe
these mini-tests are coming back with great results. I run a small fund. I was as skeptical as anyone. However, I also
deal with chronic arthritis in my foot. I have to say I was totally amazed with CIGrx's ability to knock inflammation out
of my foot. I tested it at least a dozen times where I would go on and off Cigrx and see what happened and every time
I noticed a definitive decrease in inflammation. On top of this I gave CIGrx to several people who wanted to quit
dipping and smoking and once again the results were very very impressive. So, instead of just talking about what you
think based on this and that - test CIGrx yourself. If you give it to smokers who are interested in quitting you will likely
see very promising results. If you give it to people with pain or arthritis you will see them report great results most
likely. Both of these markets are enormous. Star accidentally discovered a new generation anti-inflammatory. Robert
Roskamp is buying shares for a reason. Cigrx could end up being used by tens-of-millions of smokers to curb the
urge. On top of this tens of millions of people could end up using Anatabine for inflammation diseases. Anything could
happen but this $600 mil co could end up being worth $6 bil in short order. You should assume that pharma co's are
testing the compound and getting great results. Part of the Star story is its anti-pump and dump nature of how all this
info was released. They almost wanted the co to look like crap - while insiders and roskamp were buying shares hand
over fist. Don't be fooled. Robert Roskamp bought shares at $4....his scientists are studing Anatabine. get it?

RCP-006 is not nicotine. You are wrong. Your comments and article are a sad reflection on the quality of
Seeking Alpha. You are obviously just another desperate short caught on the wrong side of one of Nasdaq's
best performing stocks in 2011 and you are distorting reality in an attempt for profit.


Reader, notice no mention of the upcoming appellate court decision. Research recent Abbott Labs judgement
concerning inequitable conduct. We are close to 150 days from the oral arguments. That is an indicator, albeit
not a perfect one, that we are nearing a mixed result. That would obviously bring a ton of value to Star's share

Author’s reply »  Anatabine is just demethylated nicotine. The body demethylates everything--that is basic
chemistry. Sorry, nicotine is not a cure-all. Nicotine ligands have been studied extensively in Alzheimer's and
all have failed (see examples above).

Again, RCP-006 is not nicotine. You are wrong. There is no avoiding that fact.


I read on the yahoo message board that you are being or have been sued over 30 times, is that true? Have
you ever been sued for any unethical conduct? I think the reader of this article has the right to know given that
you are clearly wrong here. Message boards are full of untruths so I apologize if this is another erroneous
claim but you are obviously wrong here and aggressively so, so I felt inclined to ask. You question Johnnie
Williams integrity, therefore you should not be above answering my question truthfully.

Author’s reply »  Anatabine is one easy metabolic step away from nicotine. Demethylation is a ubiquitous
reaction that takes place everywhere. So, when you take nicotine, it becomes anatabine. Does that make
sense to you?


05 Jun 2011, 01:25 PM 


davidberk
Why do you keep saying Anatabine has no benefits because it is identical to nicotine? Do you have any
medical or chemical background to make such remarks?


Regardless, your conclusion is simply and unequivocally wrong. For example morphine is the potent
(significantly) "demethylated" version of codeine. So using this logic, Anatabine would be the potent form of
nicotine. While nicotine has been inconclusive in treating various illnesses, there is supporting evidence that it
does help. And if Anatabine is the potent version of nicotine then this compound could turn the medical
industry upside down.


I hope your clients know the reason you are shorting this stock. There are numerous catalysts that can drive
this stock to epic market caps.

As someone with a degree in Science this is an absurd comment. Nicotine is the only thing metabolically
identical to Nicotine. Conversly Anatabine is the only thing metabolically identical to Anatabine!! This manner
of generalisation is wrong. Idential compounds chemically but with different isomers have in the past resulted
in compounds that have cured disease / been totally ineffective depending on the isomer!!!


05 Jun 2011, 09:32 PM 


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Metabolism results in equivalent metabolites. Look up prodrugs? It can be said nicotine is a
prodrug for anatabine. This has nothing to do with chirality (isomers).

Can you provide any reference to say there is clinically significant direct demethylization of nicotine?

You have absolutely NO idea what you are talking about.


You are THINKING of "cotinine" ... the major matabolite of nicotine in the human body. It is NOT anatabine.
Anatabine is NOT a metabolite of nicotine.


Show anyone here any ... ANY... reference other than your own mind that so states. You cannot. What kind of
complete fraud ARE you? You misread what you found in your 10 minute google tour in "preparation" for this
article.


I can see how someone in a big hurry to back up his short position might be able to make the "mistake". You
made a BIG mistake. Admit it!

Demethylated nicotine is not anatabine. It would remove CH3 from the C10H14N2 compound (Nicotine) and it
WOULD NOT add back a CH to give you C10H12N2 (Anatabine). Even a midlevel chemistry class could
teach you that. What are your credentials?


06 Jun 2011, 01:36 PM 


agelessmd
It is foolish and ignorant to say that anatabine is the same thing as nicotine. It is DEMETHYLATED nicotine!
To say they are the same is to say that estrogen and testosterone are the same since they only have a couple
hydroxyl group difference! One hydroxyl or one methyl group completely changes the 3 dimensional structure
of a molecule, which in turn completely chamnges its cellular receptor interaction. This is basic pharmacology
in medical school.... not advanced molecular phsyics.

Shorts would save themselves a lot of money by just buying some Cigrx and testing it themselves. All of the negative
articles about CIGX is from people who have never even experimented with Cigrx. Once you try it on people who
want to cut down on smoking and give it to people with arthritis it becomes obvious that cigx is really onto something.
The shorts here are clueless bc they think CIGrx is just a bogus candy. They couldn't be more off.


Again, money managers are buying CigRX themselves, giving to people to try, and are getting great results. roskamp
obviously is seeing great results as Robert Roskamp is buying shares. tons of insider buying.... this is why this stock
is about to move up

"$63,000 in sales. Maybe with a bigger rollout they can crack $1 million?"


The just recently received FDA approval on CigRX and sales have begun to ramp up dramatically. Also their
facebook pages are showing huge increase in numbers, from 5,000 to over 22,000 in just the last month or
so, that is huge.


To do this they need money for marketing and/or a national partnership. Hmmm. To another of your points on
this issue of them having little revenues understanding a major cause may help.


Star Scientific has been crushed by a monster Tobacco, RJR,  
for 10 years  
over a patent infringement.  
That has sucked the meager revenues of this young firm,  
but also shown the incredible tenacity of The CEO,  
Jonnie Williams,  
-refusing to give in or give up-  
in the face of withering legal maneuvering  
and near unlimited funding from RJR law firms to fight Star on nearly anything they can dream up in hopes of
bankrupting Star.


Isn't it rather stunning that it has not happened?


I find it wonderful that the Patent and Trademark Office reviewed Stars patent in question, as requested by
RJR and found, on 2 or 3/11, their patent held up in every department in question.


Further, I find it remarkable that the CAFC recently cited the Star vs RJR suit, in reference of an Abbot Labs
ruling,  
as an example of extreme monkey business  
that needs to change to unclog the courts.  
Seems to indicate the direction they may rule on this anticipated decision and perhaps a consideration behind
your very dismissive article above being short the stock.


You mentioned products,  
the new product roll out for Anatabloc  
will soon be hosted by the First Lady of Virginia,  
Maureen McDonnell at the Governors Mansion.

Why would she do that for nicotine, if there is no difference between Anatabine and it as you claim? A smart
politician's wife no less, must see more to it then a renaming of nicotine.


This was announced at the recent Roskamp Fundraiser and meeting, attended by many researchers
including representatives from Johns Hopkins. Why are they there and discussing RCP-006, in Anatabine if it
is simple nicotine?


Regarding that meeting, just before it ended a strong surge of selling and very negative posting on the Yahoo
message board hit Star shares that same Wednesday around 3 PM. 
Oddly, shares rebounded the next morning and day.


Dr John Faessel, also a Seeking Alpha contributing author, had an excellent article based upon his
attendance at the Roskamp affair including some of the latest research presentations. He could not be more
bullish, and I appreciate the facts he cited and bases that upon.


Everything holds risk in life. I am a small retail investor, I also work full time in health care, have for 33 years
and see the ravages of disease daily.  
RCP-006 seems to hold REAL promise.  
It is FDA approved.  
I take CigRX daily now and find it helps with several issues related to inflammation. Many others report
anecdotal empirical positive results when they try it.  
Studies are underway, as you know.  
Time will tell and the time draws nearer each day on many fronts. 
Opinion is fine but let's be careful when discussing scientific facts regarding a companies product that holds
the real key for its future growth based upon its product lines, until the science is in. We could not ask for
better researchers then those mentioned above and in Dr. Faessels recent update of 6/2/11.

"Star’s second line of business is a “smoking alternative dietary supplement” designed to help smokers quit.

When was the product INTRODUCED to market, Marty?? Would that have been a single test market? in
AUGUST of 2010? Why didn't you tell all your short friends and prospects THAT, Marty?

I hate to eat and run, so I thought I'd come back for another little truth fest while I grab a bite, and then run.


About your "expose'" of the small $63,000 in sales last year for CigRx. You know ... when you failed to
mention that it was a brand new product, a brand new kind of product, and that it was only available in one
test market, the Richmond VA MSA? OH! And that it was only launched there on August 5th last year. You
remember that little sleight of information? Or rather THOSE little sleights of information?

Well, Richmond MSA has about 1.3M persons in it. Let us suppose that that represents 1/150 of the U.S.
population. It's almost 1/300, but let's be conservative. It'll make you look a little bit less like a shyster, for one
thing.


So if you assume that CigRx would have done as well in the larger pool over the less than five months this
brand new product was marketed, revenue would have been $9.45 MILLION, Marty ... over 5 months.


Over 12 months that would have been $22.68 MILLION, Marty ... not the smart-@$$ one million you sniped in
your reply.


First year, brand new, brand new concept in reducing smoking, marketed through doctor contacts and some
TV ads. $22.68M


Now, the clinical trial, available to doctors on the CigRx.com web site (not public to prevent accusation of
claiming health benefits for a dietary supplement), shows the product is in the range of effectiveness of
Chantix, but Chantix is a prescription-only medication, Marty. It also appears that Chantix may make the user
feel like killing him or her self ... if not another family member instead ... even more than just quitting smoking,
alone, does.


Now, both Chantix and CigRx are MUCH more effective than nicotine replacement, Marty, but CigRx is a non-
prescription dietary supplement that, as an antidepressant, MAKES PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ... NOT worse.
Plus, Marty, now listen up: it'll make some of their aches and pains better, if they've got them, to boot! You
seem to have a very high potential path that information has to climb to make it "up there", so I'd recommend
that you read this paragraph again.


So does $22.68M ... make that $40M ... sound so very bad for the first year of such a product, Marty? Really?
NO!


And you know what Marty? Here's a headline for you. I'm not making this up (I don't believe in such tactics):
"...revenue from Chantix in America fell another 16.8 percent to $252 million ... " in 2010, Marty. Revenue fell
because people are scared of it, it costs out the kazoo, you need a prescription to get it, and when you do get
it it makes you feel like Ted Bundy! So what chance does a product have that is about as effective, but is polar
opposite in the other aspects? What do YOU think?


Does all of that ... those FACTS, Marty, FACTS ... as in TRUE FACTS, Marty ... does all that wrapped
together sound to you, seriously, like a bad start for a new product?


Then WHY, Marty, did you work SO hard to try to hoodwink all those eager readers ... in their "shorts" ... out
there, with your little disinformation campaign? Does this "short" business work if you tell everyone else to go
short, and then you do the opposite, maybe? I don't like the concept of "shorting" a stock and so I can't be
sure. Fill me in.

Those aren't "my sales targets", Marty. I don't do "targets".


Those (as I thought was plain) are the figures YOU would have come up with if you had actually presented
facts instead of sleights of facts ... when presenting your picture of sales figures for the brand new CigRx
product introduced into one small test market after mid-year of 2010.


Did you see the $252M+/yr potential market for that product alone, re the scared people still buying Chantix
last year? I didn't exactly wave that in your face ... and regretted it later.


I don't do targets ... I do truth.


Are you ready to print the truth about anatabine and what you have (now, no doubt) found ... that it is a
"cousin", a related but different compound, and not a "metabolite" of nicotine, and therefore can well ... and
does ... have application as a possible treatment for various conditions (and, take my word, is successfully
already doing so)?


You'll be "Marty" to me, in lieu of something I can't print (or, my substitute last name for you, "Shyster" ...
something I can remember), until you have the guts to come forward and print the truth about your failures of,
and misrepresentations of, fact with regard to Star Scientific and its products and their potential ... and the
reason for the current excitement in the stock.


I am intrigued about thought of the power of someone having some sort of podium like this and the possibility
of that someone standing on it and shouting "SHORT!" (with appropriate misrepresentations) and really
thinking, and doing, in a whisper, "long" ... picking up cheap shares all the way. Such a person would not be
keen on admitting to the truth of his misrepresentations when called out. Or maybe you just don't like to admit
your mistakes.


To sum it up again for you ... I know information management is tough:


There IS no competition for Star's low and zero carcinogen smokeless tobacco products under the brand-
new, and still developing (like all else about the stock) FDA rule over tobacco. There is nothing else like them
on the planet. (FDA rule is what the products have been waiting for.)


You are dead wrong on all counts about anatabine and its prospects ... chemically, logically, and morally
(misrepresentations).


One part of that arena is the brand new product CigRx, with an effectiveness in realm of Chantix, but with
positive side effects, not deadly ones, and it is available for less than the cost of smoking ... without a
prescription. $250M+/yr market v. Chantix. Tastes good to boot.

The big news about anatabine, which you don't even know about, is the anti-inflammatory effect, a
breakthrough discovered while researching it for other purposes, which make it a "first of a kind" compound
(directly affecting NF-kB) to regulate overall (and acute if need be) inflammation ... the new frontier in medical
science.


No one cares about what you think about the chances for a win against RJR. Indeed, with the very recent
(new to you : ) anatabine developments, that is now just a side show.


You screwed up ... but don't feel bad. I have to deliver this information to shorts almost every day. I'll get to

If the stock was trading at about $5 at the writing of this article and was shorted, the current price of under $3
would make for a pretty nice profit.

You do not have an understanding of Star's huge potentials in any of the categories you mentioned. More likely, you
are choosing to hide what you know. All GUESSES you make as far as the chance of profitability are upside down. 1)
Lawsuit 2) Anatabine both have about a 90% chance of huge gains. You pretend they have a longshot of little. (i.e.
"few million" possible from appeal "longshot"....when they are very likely to have about 500 times that in settlement
alone!)


You must be very uninformed or dishonest.

Why is it when an author writes up a stock as a short and admits to being short the stock, that people attack him.
However, when a person writes up a long to a stock and admits to being long, people compliment them on the article.
Both instances are people talking their book. So I ask what is the difference?


05 Jun 2011, 05:49 PM

Then difference is when an author writes up a stock they are short, their losses could be an infinite amount of
money, this fact alone makes them highly suspect in the honesty department. Money does strange thing to
people.

He is not faulted for being short I believe it is because on this company many, many investors have really
done their homework and know a cheap shot when they see it. He equates RCP-006 in Anatabine with simple
nicotine and states as fact that they have poor results and poor accomplishments with nutraceuticals.  
He derides the CEO, he derides their lack of revenues without clarifying that the RJR lawsuit has undermined
them financially, as it was intended to no doubt by RJR. And on and on.  
It reads in places as a hit piece. Many long term investors take umbrage at biased articles that appear to aim
intentionally at swaying opinion rather then looking for factual reasons to buy/sell or hold. More then that re-
read the responses garnered thus far.


And what is with needing a MODERATOR for my last response?

Your losses really cannot be infinite on a short unless you keep your head in the sand. This is because you will
continually get a margin call and if you don't put up more margin, then the position gets pulled. I guess in theory one
could continually putting up the necessary margin, but at some point any professional investor realizes their thesis is
busted and moves on. I did once have a short more than double on me, but I kept with it and after a while it filed for
bankruptcy.


I think the difference is that people do not like to see their stocks attacked. Rather than read a short article thoughfully
and consider the points, I think most people automatically get defensive. You see this trend especially on the pieces
about chinese reverse mergers. This is the complete opposite tact that someone like Julian Robertson used to take.
He would get a bear and a bull on a stock on the phone and let them debate it out to see if his analysis was flawed. I
know when I am long or short a stock, I always look at what the opposite case can be and I will even try to find
someone who holds the opposite opinion. I am not saying whether this article is right or wrong. I am just tired of
seeing those who write short articles get attacked for seemingly no reason except that they have written up a short
piece.

The point is that this person is representing that he knows something about the chemistry of nicotine and
anatabine and that anatabine is a metabolite of, or is in any way a product of nicotine. THAT is an absolute lie
... and it will be shown by the fact that this farce of a writer will be unable to show any respected reference
that will back that claim. He has NO IDEA about the very thing that is driving the value of the stock right now,
and thus is without any credibility in trashing the company.

Why does anatabine, but not nicotine, accumulate in jasmonate-elicited cultured tobacco BY-2 cells? 
Shoji T, Hashimoto T. 
Source


Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara,
630-0192 Japan. 
Abstract


Suspension-cultured cells of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) grow rapidly in a highly homogenous
population and still exhibit the general behavior of plant cells, and thus are often used as model systems in several
areas of plant molecular and cellular biology, including secondary metabolism. While the parental tobacco variety
synthesizes nicotine as a major alkaloid, the cultured tobacco cells mainly produce a related alkaloid anatabine,
instead of nicotine, when elicited with jasmonates. We report here that cultured BY-2 cells scarcely express N-
methylputrescine oxidase (MPO) genes even after jasmonate elicitation. MPO is the second enzyme in the
biosynthetic pathway that supplies the pyrrolidine moiety of nicotine and nornicotine, but is predicted to be
dispensable for the biosynthesis of anatabine, anabasine and anatalline, which do not contain the pyrrolidine moiety.
When MPO was overexpressed in tobacco BY-2 cells, nicotine synthesis was dramatically enhanced while anatabine
formation was effectively suppressed. As a complementary approach, we suppressed MPO expression by RNA
interference in tobacco hairy roots that normally accumulate nicotine. In the MPO-suppressed roots, the contents of
anatabine, anabasine and anatalline, as well as N-methylputrescine and putrescine, markedly increased to
compensate for suppressed formation of nicotine and nornicotine. These results identify the transcriptional regulation
of MPO as a critical rate-limiting step that restricts nicotine formation in cultured tobacco BY-2 cells.

Nicotine is known to prevent or reduce Parkinson's and ulcerative collitis ... google it Marty. Of course as far
as you're concerned that's no benefit, because you don't have them I presume.


There are only the benefits that Johns Hopkins and Roskamp Institute have documented for anatabine .....
duhhhhhh, because, only now has research BEGUN on anatabine. Until now, no significant research at all
has been done on anatabine.


My my my, Marty, you have a very large and visibly GROWING short...coming! Your misrepresentations
(about the marketing of CigRx) and sleights of hand are showing!


So, all you dudes that hang on Marty's every word to short stuff ...you'd better start doing your own DD.

Of course there are "few if any benefits documented for anatabine..." THINK!!! It is because it is only now
being thoroughly studied by multiple highly-respected major scientific/medical institutions. What an inane
comment from an absurd stance - any novel usage for an already known compound or element by nature
lacks a body of reference for its usage and benefits. That's what all of this is about. Trying to refute science by
saying there isn't any science to back something up is a tautology and only reflects your poor understanding
of both science and rhetoric and your desperation regarding having your shorts squeezed.

You are also stupid. EVERYONE is waiting for you to supply JUST ONE believable reference that says that
anatabine is in any way derived from nicotine in the body, or that its effects are the same as nicotine.


They aren't ... anatabine is an MAO inhibitor, for example, and nicotine is not. Do you know what an MAO
inhibitor is? Do you have any idea how differently an MAO inhibitor affects the mammalian body compared to
a similar chemical that is NOT an MAO inhibitor? Do you know what you are talking about AT ALL? You are
now up at bat to prove that you do. One real reference that backs up your contention that the body
metabolizes nicotine to anatabine (rather than cotinine) will be a good start. We all all waiting ................

Specific to CIGX, How does the presence of the Regulatory Circuit Breaker (as it was activated this morning) impact
your desire to short it additionally?


After all, as you said, "It is my opinion that the fair value for all of CIGX shares is $5 to $10 million, 90%+ less than
current prices"


Are you inclined to ADD to your short position?


At what point do you think it will be effective to begin to cover that short position?


Would you rather see a company that you are short have the RCB activated several times in a 2-day period (like with
CIGX in early April) or would you rather just see a stock go down 6 or 8% a day ad-infinitum?


You opened the can of worms... might as well go fishing.. I'll look forward to your thoughts!

Author’s reply »  It's a small point - Nutraceuticals are rarely large sellers. Pharmaceutical companies file
INDs and begin clinical trials for a good reason. This idea that a nutraceutical/OTC approach allows for less
regulatory scrutiny is laughable. Medical claims can only be made with randomized, controlled trials. Drugs
only sell with medical claims. I am confident anatabine (and all nicotine derivatives) have no medical benefit
that will be proven in a large randomized trial.


I am also very confident CIGX is worth 5% of what it is trading at. No investigational stage asset is worth $700
million - look around you. Anatabine certainly isn't worth anywhere near an exception.

FIRST: I am long CIGX


I have read MOST of the comments here, and am beginning to believe the science of chemistry and the science of
biology and the science of x, are much like that dismal science: economics. It seems there are many experts, and
many "experts" disagree about what each sees in the products of CIGX.


I don't know how to judge the science on the products of CIGX , or those they have in the pipeline. But if what the
author says about the management is true, that is a big big warning sign. Reminds me of another small pharma
company, Cell Therapeutics, where the CEO and others in its management have lived richly for years on their salaries
and other perks, paid for by those who bought the stock on the promises management has touted but failed for years
to deliver on. I at least, am thankful for the information on management, realizing it too may be tainted with this
author's particular interests. Still, it's worth considering and evaluating.


Of particular importance to the author's argument that CIGX is a scam operation are his thoughts on how to value a
company, his comments on market cap as opposed to price per share. That should be economics 101 to all of us, but
it is amazing isn't it, how many of us do not remember it?


IS CIGX a $700 million company? Based on its sales, net income, its history, it's past delivery on past promises? i
don't think so. And that's a good place to go back to every time you hear this stock touted. Maybe its future value will
reach that, but certainly it's present value is nowhere near it , and never has been in the past.


The stock is down, now, with the overall market down. I will wait and see how it does if the market reverses course,
but have to admit I am no longer inclined to hold for the long term.... there are many places to put your money, but no

Martin, 
1) There are alot of people here asking you questions about your background that you are simply avoiding. You would
get some credibility if you answered them. 
2) Quit arguing on the internet. It's unbecoming of a contributor.


Folks, 
Why do you care what this guy's opinion is?

Since when has arguing become "unbecoming"? Isn't that the whole point of a forum - to debate?

Well, Marty (still Marty because you haven't come clean about anatabine), I'm going to wrap things up here. Yes, the
world needs another MAO inhibitor ... a brand new kind that has an asymptotic dose/response relationship and so is
"self limiting" in effect ... otherwise the first heavy smoker who went out for beer and pizza would have died from the
"cheese effect". Otherwise, anatabine couldn't be given as an OTC dietary supplement.


And yes, Marty, Lipitor is an anti-inflammatory (reduces c-rp). On and on, Marty. You're getting behind.


Look, here's the thing. You're obviously a bright guy, but your problem is you think you can know everything. Worse
still, you think you DO know everything. Do you really think you know more about the potential of anatabine than
Michael Mullan (world-famous Alzheimer's researcher& CEO at the Roskamp Institute), who has thrown his weight
behind the anatabine story? If so, well, NOW you know your true and very basic problem: blind, rampant arrogance.
Hopefully, now so does everyone else. It seems to run in the family when it comes to short sellers.


Good luck, Marty. Please stay very short CIGX. It will make me feel very good, and you'll learn a tough but valuable
lesson. I hope I have contributed to it.

Again, for the record, if the author had shorted this stock at the time of publishing, he is sitting on a very nice
profit.

Martin: 
I have no position in CIGX but feel there is only a small chance that anatabine will do much for Alzheimer’s.


Anatabine is not a metabolite of nicotine but rather another alkaloid present in tobacco. You were wrong there but
others leaving comments also made errors.

Anatabine and nicotine do share many properties. Both strongly bind and activate the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
Both have anti-inflammatory properties. The Roskamp study looked at IL-1 production in phlebotomized human blood
after treatment with LPS (a very strong pro-inflammatory agent purified from bacteria that can cause shock).
Anatabine very effectively reduced the expression of IL-1b by the isolated cells. Well, so does nicotine in other models
of LPS inflammation:


www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p... 
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p...


Also, Lipitor has some anti-inflammatory responses (lowers CRP and lowers IL-1 in some models-i.e adjuvant
induced arthritis) but had not been found to reduce LPS induced IL-1 expression in whole blood in another study.
Thus, comparison to Lipitor in the Roskamp study did not make much sense as the conclusion was foregone.


www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p... 
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p...


Nicotine even reduces inflammation in a mouse model of MS and of course there have been some successful mouse
Alz studies whereby nicotine and some of its metabolites reduces amyloid deposition:


www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p... 
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/p...


None of this means that anatabine will not have some properties distinct from nicotine. It is a legitimate compound to
investigate for Alzheimers, but with no controlled human study data, and only a little preclinical data at this point, the
market cap seems too high.

The market at this point has proved you right.

I'm long CIGX. That said, the reaction of readers to a negative view of this company is dismaying. Please don't
suggest that it is inappropriate for Martin to take a short position in a company he feels is overvalued, and to tell us
why he thinks so. What a weird distorted world it would be if no negative viewpoints could be expressed. Of course he
is "talking his book", but so are all other authors who write up glowing coverage of a company. CIGX is a speculative
buy, not an investment. It can and probably will have wide swings in it's valuation before we know what they actually
have. If a negative viewpoint rattles you, you might want to put your money in something safer and less speculative.

That sums it up beautifully.
