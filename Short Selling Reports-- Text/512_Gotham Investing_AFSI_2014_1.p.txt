AmTrust Financial's Statutory Financials Indicate Reported GAAP
Profits Might Be Overstated
Feb. 26, 2014 10:37 AM ET29 comments
by: Gotham Investing


The statutory filings of AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (Ticker: AFSI) indicate the
Company's underwriting results are much worse than they report to investors. In fact, it
appears AFSI is losing money in their insurance operations instead of generating the
profits they claim.


Investors, regulators, and rating agencies should take note. If or when they do, the stock
could fall significantly.


AFSI US Statutory Filing Financials (Net):


Statutory filings for US groups (in AFSI's case Technology Insurance Company &
Affiliates) show the financial results of various entities net of reinsurance, even if the
reinsurer is owned by the same holding company as is the case for AmTrust International
Insurance (AFSI's Bermuda Captive Reinsurer). Based on these results, it would appear
that AFSI's US operations are stable and profitable. However, this doesn't tell the full story.


Below are the results of TIC & Affiliates for 2010-2012 net of all reinsurance (including
from other AFSI subs):

AFSI US Statutory Filing Financials, Adjusted to Eliminate Reinsurance from other AFSI
subs


Since the financials shown above include the benefit of reinsurance, one would need to
adjust those to eliminate the benefit of reinsurance from other AFSI subs (but not from
third parties) to see what the US operations contributed to profits across all AFSI entities
(net of third party reinsurance).


Fortunately, the Schedule Y allows us to do this. As AFSI's CEO, Barry Zyskind said on
the most recent conference call:

I want to address the references to Schedule Y to the annual statements filed by our
US insurers. Schedule Y is intended to show the net income effect of reinsurance
agreements with affiliated insurers within a holding company group. Schedule Y
shows correctly the aggregate net income effect to our Luxembourg companies
resulting from their assumption of intra-company financial losses from AmTrust
International. It corresponds to the reduction of their equalization reserves. Schedule
Y also shows the net effect to AmTrust International of all intra-company
reinsurance, including a cession of a net loss to the Luxembourg companies.


In other words, Schedule Y (column 9 below) shows the subsidy received (provided) by
other insurance companies owned by the holding company.


Adjusting for the subsidies AFSI's US insurance entities are receiving from offshore AFSI
subsidiaries (to see the total profit/loss to AFSI from US operations regardless of where it
ends up, onshore or offshore), the results look rather different and show significant losses
in 2011 and 2012:


Source: TIC & Affiliates Statutory Filings


This is in stark contrast to the results AFSI reports to investors (SEC filings show $110mm
- $150mm of underwriting profits for 2010-2012). Since 70% of AFSI's premiums earned
are in the US (Source: 10-K) and there are only minor accounting differences in GAAP
and SAP accounting (the main one being the timing of acquisition cost recognition).


Further, insurance regulators and rating agencies use this data to determine the strength
and quality of AFSI's insurance operations. By reporting steady profits on a net basis,
AFSI gets credit from AM Best and regulators for its ability to generate earnings to
replenish capital. If the intra-company agreements that turn losses into reported profits are
not well disclosed in the "interrogatories," regulators might take a different view of AFSI.


I intend to write a follow-up article on AFSI's reinsurance interrogatories and how they
conflict with management statements elsewhere, which will further highlight the problems
with AFSI's disclosures.

I'm not sure I understand. If the Luxembourg reinsurance unit is consistently making an underwriting profit which
exceeds the loss amount of the U.S. P&C insurance business, what prevents the situation from continuing
indefinitely?


Doesn't this mean that the company, in aggregate, is profitable, and would be even more so once they discard the
P&C business?

The Luxembourg reinsurance unit is losing money. The only business in these entities is reinsuring
(subsidizing) other AmTrust entities.


The point of my analysis is that (1) Luxembourg entities lose money subsidizing other AmTrust entities and
(2) without the subsidy, AmTrust's US insurance operations lose money.

The implications are significant because AM Best and regulators want to see stable, profitable underwriting
which AmTrust creates through financial engineering ("financial reinsurance"). However, this financial
engineering is not disclosed in certain regulatory filings as it should be (except in the Schedule Y). Therefore,
it appears AmTrust could be misleading regulators.


I wanted to highlight this issue, so that it could be brought to their attention.

Thank you! I understand.

After all these allegations have been rehashed again and again, I don't believe that AFSI, their auditors or AM
Best has made an error. It seems much more likely that you have.


From the last earnings call transcript, the gains on the below book value purchase of the Luxembourg entities
are realized over time by using the reserves.


26 Feb 2014, 11:42 AM 


User 22893511
I don't believe anyone has presented the issues from this angle before, so the analysis above is new. If you
think it is incorrect in some way, please explain how.


The "gains" AmTrust reports are a function of larger losses that go unreported. AmTrust has only provided
assertions without substantiation. In contrast, I and others have provide publicly available data and cite
sources.


The fact that the company hasn't given any detailed breakdown is telling, in my opinion.

Pretty strong verbage yet again. The words appears and intends appear right along with the weathered Luxembourg
baggage. And some screenshots for good measure. But I would still like to see some good solid evidence. All in all
SA is a great place to glean information.

How exactly did you calculate "US Benefit from Intr-Co Reinsurance" You seemed to have just pulled that number out
of thin air, only "referencing" schedule Y. If you are going to adjust the expense line, you have to equally adjust the
premium line, which would actually INCREASE AFSI's profit. But that wouldn't suit your argument. I can't wait until
GEO Investing has to change their name or can only post under pseudo names like yourself. I have no problem with
someone shorting a stock for legitimate fundamental or technical reasons. But these campaigns to create confusion
by intentionally publishing misleading articles with convoluted arguments that are intentionally difficult to follow
because they are baseless should have civil penalties. Give it up already. Cover your position and move on to your
next idea.

My understanding is that these are essentially the same accusations made during the recent coordinated short
attacks.


The company appears to have thoroughly addressed these issues, particularly in the most recent conference call.


It seems difficult for them to provide a more comprehensive explanation of how these transactions work and why they
are appropriate.

He is pulling these numbers out of thin air. If you add all of the numbers in those columns together, they add to $0 so
all of the numbers offset each other. He's just a short who took some bad advice and is trying to get out of his
position.


The founders of the company bought $35 million worth of stock the week that these allegations originally came out.
That should tell you all you need to know about the accuracy of their financials.


27 Feb 2014, 12:54 AM 


theindemnitor
Jasonb75, you need to understand who the founders are. Barry is the son-in-law of the man behind the
money. Barry and his Father-in-law and his partner are worth several Billion. Buying $35M of stock when this
news posted is like most people buying a candy bar. It should show a sign of confidence when executives that
can afford to buy shares in high 8 digits, only buy peanuts of their own stock. Also, together the execs own
approx 67% of the companies. They could afford to take the company private twice and yet they are in the
market often for additional capital. I believe that someone who believes in their company should invest
entirely in their company. They received one of the highest valuations in recent P&C history when they went
public and they retained the highest percentage of ownership ever.

This has been available on the authors blog literally for months - it is NOT news and accounted for the stock drop in
December.


The author is short the stock, profits from its drop and there is little point to listening to the wolf cry wolf when he sits
right outside the chicken coops door waiting for the panic in order to eat his meal . . .


Beware

If the company is profitable, well-capitalized and transparent in its financial statements, the stock will do well in the
long term regardless of any short selling action.


If what the author says is true, at some point they'll deplete their reserves, the truth will come out, and the company
will liquidate, no matter how many people buy the stock or try to orchestrate silly short squeezes.


Trying to improve the health of a company by lauding it on online forums or by pushing the stock price makes as
much sense as trying to fix your car's engine by repainting the car or fiddling with the speedometer.

1)If we assume that the author is right that the founders goes mad, because they spend $ 35 million to purchase
shares of the company, knowing that the company hides losses. It defies any logic. Business founders billionaires!
They know how to make money, they know what to buy stocks need when everyone panicked and shares fall in price. 
And they earned this 20%! 2) The Company announces repurchase shares when the shares extremely cheap. And
the company earns on this well! 
Conclusion: The panic which staged a short sellers brought great profit to the shareholders, the company, and value
investors who took advantage of this price reduction.

This is essentially the same article that was put out a few months ago, did you change your screen name? You, the
rogue lone investor, are able to spot what auditors don't find. I'm glad you admit that you're shorting. Please provide
me with a list of all your long investments as I would like to publish articles just like this to destroy the value of your
longs.

"Please provide me with a list of all your long investments as I would like to publish articles just like this to destroy the
value of your longs. "


Articles do not destroy value. If the company is intrinsically valuable, it will do well regardless of any articles
published.


Warren Buffett famously invited short sellers to short Berkshire stock. He only cares about the stock price in the sense
that it'll be cheaper for the company to buy it back.


If you feel the value of AmTrust was "destroyed" by this article, I doubt there was much value in it to begin with.

There is much more going on with Amtrust than you are aware of. Their appointment of MGA's and providing the pen
to unscrupulous people is astonishing. They roll books into their premium to get the topline growth but they are
concealing their actual profit. You are correct in your flow of the transaction but you are missing the reserve issue with
their "scheme". Plus, they are domiciled in Delaware and the Insurance Department is a joke with corruption galore !

You are missing a lot of the internal issues within AFSI. Your overview is correct but you are missing the reserve
aspect of SAP accounting. What is more concerning is the future tails that are not being reported properly. Barry and
crew are on a buying spree of horrific business, they were giving their pen out to many unscrupulous MGA's and they
are now hiding the losses from the public. Holding entities like AFSI scramble the granular losses to shield from prying
eyes. They have gotten away with their fraudulent accounting because nobody has looked underneath their NAIC
filing blanks. Partly because they are domiciled in Delaware. Probably the most corrupt insurance department in the
U.S.

25.02.2014 Barry Zuskind acquired (Non Open Market) 347875 shares. The cost of the stake of about $ 13 million. It
turns out that Barry fool, he tatit their hard-earned money to buy shares of AFSI, and knows that the company hides
losses. It sounds crazy! It's against all the laws of logic! I think of all okay, information about alleged false statement.
This lie is beneficial to anyone who wants to make money on short sales.
