Around the world with �5bn –
HMRC’s allegations of tax fraud
at General Electric revealed


Introduction and summary


HMRC have alleged that General Electric fraudulently obtained a tax advantage in the UK worth


US$1bn by failing to disclose documents relating to the group’s �nancing arrangements.


The allegations revolve around the �nancing of certain GE companies in Australia, which HMRC


allege that the company routed via the UK in order to gain a tax advantage. In using UK

companies as part of the transaction, GE required clearance from HMRC to ensure that they met


UK tax rules. This was granted on a partial basis in 2005.


In documents before the High Court, HMRC allege that their approval for the transaction was only


given on the understanding that the funds would be used to invest in businesses operating in


Australia.


However, according to HMRC’s case, the tax authority would later discover that after leaving the


UK for Australia the AUS$5bn used in the transaction was not invested in any business. The


transaction was in fact part of a complex and contrived tax avoidance scheme that would circulate


money between the US, Luxembourg, the UK and Australia before being sent back to the US just


four days later. The transactions had no commercial purpose other than to create a “triple dip” tax


advantage in the UK, the US and Australia.


HMRC allege that GE deliberately supplied misleading documentation in order to gain clearance


for their transaction. This included omitting key passages from the minutes of a board meeting at


GE in order to hide the tax avoidance scheme which GE knew would not comply with UK tax


rules.1


HMRC are now seeking to annul the 2005 agreement they came to with GE over the scheme.


Corporate �lings in the United States have disclosed that if HMRC are successful, the tax bill for GE


could total US$1bn before any interest or penalties, which are likely to be substantial.2


General Electric told TaxWatch that they believe that the transactions will be ruled permissible on


their technical merits.


The company denies that it deliberately misled HMRC about the nature of the transactions.It


claims that any information omitted from the documentation given to HMRC was not relevant to


the tax issues being considered.


GE is therefore asking the High Court to make an order preventing HMRC from going back on the


Clearance Agreement.3


Although it is not uncommon for HMRC to accuse companies failing to provide all relevant facts


concerning a particular transaction, this appears to be the �rst time that HMRC has accused a


major company of engaging in fraudulent misrepresentation in order to gain a tax advantage.


Debt, hybrids and arbitrage


The tax avoidance scheme at the heart of this case is a hybrid arbitrage scheme. The principle


behind hybrid arbitrage schemes is relatively simple, although in practice the schemes are usually


very complex.


Different countries often have different tax rules governing any particular transaction or corporate


entity. Companies seeking to engage in tax avoidance can exploit these differences to create


transactions that generate a deduction against taxable pro�ts in one jurisdiction, but no


corresponding taxable income anywhere else. The result of this could be that a transaction is taxed


no-where, or that a company achieves two tax deductions on the same transaction.4

Tax arbitrage schemes typically involve so called “hybrids”. Hybrids are the tax equivalent of the


proverbial elephant in the story of the blind man and the elephant. They are �nancial instruments


or corporate entities, that appear to be two different different things under the rules of different


tax authorities. So for example, one tax authority may consider a �nancial instrument to be a loan,


and another may consider the same instrument to be similar to holding shares (equity). This can


result in a mismatch in the way that the instrument is treated for tax purposes, as the tax


treatment of debt is entirely different from equity.


The Australian Arbitrage


In late 2004, GE executed a series of multi-billion dollar transactions that exploited a mismatch


between Australian and UK tax law.


The Australian arbitrage centred around an Australian Partnership, GE Commercial and Consumer


Finance LP. This partnership borrowed funds and paid interest to a UK company, GE Capital


Finance Limited. The partnership was a “hybrid entity” because it was considered to be a taxable


entity in Australia, but for UK tax purposes the partnership was a so-called “transparent entity”


which did not have its own tax liability. Any pro�t or losses it made were attributed to its partners,


which were two other UK based GE companies, IGE USA Investments Limited and GE Capital


Investments Limited.5


The effect of this hybrid arrangement was that two tax deductions were made on the same loan,


one in Australia, one in the UK. The Australian Partnership deducted interest payments on the loan


it received from the UK against pro�ts made in Australia. For UK tax purposes the loans created a


loss for its UK based partners and so was tax deductible in the UK against UK pro�ts also.6


In addition to this, the money loaned by GE Capital Finance in the UK to the Australian Partnership


had itself been borrowed from a GE company based in Luxembourg.7


The interest being paid to Luxembourg resulted in a double deduction of interest in the UK on the


same loan. This double deduction was partially offset by the fact that interest payments made by


the Australian Partnership would be coming back into the UK. However, the overall effect of the


transactions was that GE would be able to deduct interest payments from their pro�ts in the UK


on a loan taken out by an Australian entity.


UK anti-arbitrage rules


Tax arbitrage has been known about for a long time. In the early 2000s the use of arbitrage


schemes by Roger Jenkins, a Barclays employee then thought to be Britain’s richest banker,


earned him the title, “King of the Double Dip”. In 2004 an internal report by the then Inland


Revenue estimated that the Treasury was losing upwards of £638m a year on Barclays’s tax


avoidance schemes, many of which involved cross-border arbitrage.8


In order to combat arbitrage schemes, the UK government introduced new anti-arbitrage laws in


2005. These allowed HMRC to disallow a tax deduction claimed by a company in the UK where

there was no corresponding taxable receipt somewhere else, or where the company had claimed


another deduction for the same expense.9


The new rules applied only, however, if the main purpose of the arbitrage was to gain a tax bene�t


in the UK. If the arrangement was designed to gain a tax advantage elsewhere, then the rules


would not apply.


In order to be effective, HMRC was required to issue a notice to companies that they were going to


apply the rules to any particular transaction. However, companies could seek clearance from


HMRC and an agreement that it would it would not seek to apply the rules to the structure at any


point in the future.


The 2005 legislation not only applied to new transactions, but to schemes already in place at the


time the legislation was passed and any future bene�t that might be generated from these


schemes.


GE seeks clearance for the Australian


Investment


Court documents show that GE became aware of the proposed rules in early 2005, and became


concerned that they might apply to a number of structures used by the company, including the


Australian scheme which became known as the Australian Investment.10


The company sought a meeting with HMRC to discuss the forthcoming rules, and an initial


meeting was held on 01 April 2005 between Dave Hartnett, then a commissioner at HMRC, William


Morris at GE, Steven Edge, a senior partner at the law �rm Slaughter and May, and other of�cials


from HMRC and GE.11


Following this initial meeting, a series of meetings were held between representatives of GE and


HMRC of�cials over a period of six months as GE sought clearance under the new anti-arbitrage


rules.12 According to a recent judgment at the High Court, GE were seeking clearance for 107 loans


amounting to £21.2bn. The Australian Investment was just one part of the clearance application by


GE.13


Court documents demonstrate that from the outset, of�cials at HMRC were highly sceptical that


the Australian Investment could escape the UK’s new anti-arbitrage rules.14


During negotiations, HMRC repeatedly made clear to GE its position that there was no commercial


reason for GE, a US headquartered corporation, to make investments in Australia via its UK


subsidiaries using a hybrid structure.15 Therefore the main purpose of the structure in their view


was to gain a tax advantage in the UK. As such, HMRC would only allow clearance for the structure


if GE agreed to give up any tax advantage resulting from the scheme.

Despite HMRC’s reservations GE did eventually reach a settlement and gain a partial clearance for


the Australian Investment without fully giving up the bene�t it gained from the tax avoidance


scheme. There is a very little detail given in the court documents regarding how this deal came


about, a point which GE highlights in their defence.16


To understand why HMRC might have come to a deal, it has to be understood that throughout the


time that the


discussions


were taking


place (a period


of just over six


months),


HMRC was


labouring


under the


impression


that the


purpose of the


transaction


was to �nance


the acquisition


by GE of


�nancial


services


companies


operating in


Australia.


Speci�cally,


HMRC


believed that


the funds


would be used


to fund real


economic


activity in


Australia.17 In particular the documents mention a company called the Australia Guarantee


Corporation a company which GE had purchased from Westpac, an Australian bank. Australia


Guarantee Corporation was Australia’s oldest home grown �nancial services company, and


provided a range of �nancial services including car loans and personal loans.


This is important because as far as HMRC are concerned, the acquisition of a business by a UK


company would not usually raise concerns.


Anti-arbitrage rules would only apply to this kind of transaction if a hybrid was involved in the


purchase, and if the main purpose of the transaction was to gain a tax advantage in the UK.

Although GE were open about the fact that a tax arbitrage was taking place,they argued that if the


Australian Partnership (the hybrid entity) did not exist, it would make little difference to the UK tax


position. This is because the alternative would be for the UK companies to buy shares in the


Australian operating companies directly, and to fund these acquisitions with debt. Interest


payments would continue to be deducted from taxable pro�t in the UK. The inclusion of a hybrid


entity, and the additional tax deduction gained from it was therefore only relevant for Australian


tax purposes.18


A compromise position seems to have been reached in which HMRC would accept GE’s argument


but disallow some of the interest deductions on the basis that had the UK companies invested


directly in the Australian operations they would not have done so using only borrowed money. As a


result HMRC did not allow GE to claim 100% of their UK interest costs (on the Luxembourg loan)


against their UK tax bill.


The missing minutes


To support their case in the current dispute, HMRC cite a range of documents provided by GE


during clearance discussions which they say suggested that the funds raised by the UK


subsidiaries would indeed be used to acquire �nancial service companies based in Australia or to


provide working capital for GE companies operating in Australia.


For example, in one document provided to HMRC setting out some of the �nancing


arrangements, the “utilization of funds” was described as:


“business acquisition and funding for Australian business assets”.


In one email sent by Roy Clark of GE to Ken Almand of HMRC, the email stated:


“Just to remind you of what we said at the meeting, references to ‘business assets’ means assets


such as photocopiers for lease, mortgage advances, power stations etc. ‘Business acquisition’


means the purchase of shares of operating companies”19


In another email sent by Roy Clark on behalf of GE on 28 October 2005 an extract of the minutes of


a board meeting at IGE USA Investments were attached .20 These minutes outlined the tax


advantage in Australia of structuring the transaction in the way proposed.


At the time, Ken Almand set out his understanding of the minutes in a �le note:


“The Board minutes are undated. They suggest that the Australian partnership structure has


Australian tax advantages and that the acquisition was a long term equity investment”21


However, as HMRC would later discover, before sending the documents someone had removed


key passages from the minutes which suggested an entirely different purpose to the transactions.


HMRC allege that the full minutes revealed that the UK transactions were part of much larger and


more complex set of transactions which were entirely circular. Over just four days, billions of dollars


were borrowed from a commercial bank, then moved between General Electric companies in the


US, Luxembourg, the UK, Australia and back to the US before being returned to the same bank it

had came from. According to HMRC, these transactions had no commercial purpose other than to


move companies GE already owned into the hybrid structure and create the tax deductions in


Australia, the UK and the United States.


Another point that the deleted passages would have revealed, is that the loan taken out by GE’s


UK subsidiaries, which amounted to AUS$6bn, was vastly higher than the value of the underlying


assets they were supposed to �nance ($529,100,000). The effect of this was to increase interest


deductions within the hybrid scheme.


It appears that HMRC obtained the full minutes of the IGE board meeting from the Australian Tax


Authority. In addition, HMRC also managed to obtain a document which it says shows that the


planned transaction was designed to create a “triple dip” tax deduction. This document was


created before the transaction took place but not presented to HMRC at the time. HMRC also


learned that GE told the Australian Tax Of�ce that the main purpose of the transaction was “to


gain a tax advantage in the UK not Australia”.22


From HMRC’s point of view, all of this con�rmed what they had suspected from the beginning,


that the purpose of the so called Australian Investment was nothing more than to take advantage


of a tax arbitrage opportunity in the UK, and reduce their tax liability.


In fact, HMRC argue that the transaction may well have fallen foul of an anti-avoidance rule on the


statute book since 1996, which disallows interest deductions on loans taken out for tax-avoidance


purposes. The existence of these rules is another reason that HMRC believe that GE had an interest


in not fully disclosing the purpose of the transactions.

General Electric’s Defence


General Electric deny any wrongdoing and do not accept that they gave a false and misleading


account of the transaction to HMRC.


They say that HMRC are focusing on a few selective documents given to them as part of the


clearance talks, which have been taken out of context. Even in context GE deny that the


documents have the meaning being ascribed to them by HMRC. GE also deny that the


transactions were not allowable under the UK’s pre-existing unallowable purpose rules.


Much of GE’s case relies on what was said in meetings between HMRC and GE during the


clearance negotiations, and in particular the 01 April 2005 meeting between David Hartnett, Will


Morris and others.23 GE claim that in these meetings they made clear what the purpose of the

transactions were, and that the Australian investments were already in the hands of GE prior to the


transactions taking place. HMRC have asked GE to provide details of what was said in these


meetings, and by whom. GE say they will present this evidence at the trial.24


The company makes the point that HMRC presented almost no evidence regarding these


extensive discussions, and there is little mention in HMRC’s case about how the Clearance


Agreement was reached.25 If HMRC was so sceptical about the Australian investment from the


outset, why did it come to an agreement? GE is inviting the judge to infer that this was because


HMRC was happy with the transactions and accepted that they did not fall foul of the anti-


arbitrage rules, having been made aware of the facts in the discussions.


When it comes to the missing minutes and other documents such as those obtained from the


Australian Tax Of�ce, GE do not deny that they failed to disclose these documents. However, they


claim that they were not relevant, and that it was clear that the minutes of the contested meeting


sent to HMRC were an “extract”. They also say that HMRC never requested a full copy of the


minutes.26


In addition to this litigation, there is also a case before the tax court where GE are contesting


HMRC’s assessment of their tax liability. GE expect that the tax court will �nd in their favour, and


told us: “We comply with all applicable tax laws and judicial doctrines of the United Kingdom and


believe that the entire bene�t is more likely than not to be sustained on its technical merits.”27


The importance of the case


Although the allegations made by HMRC in this case are serious it is important to emphasise that


there is a limit to how far the allegations go. The fraudulent misrepresentation allegations are only


raised in the context of a contract law dispute around the Clearance Agreement reached between


GE and HMRC. All that HMRC are seeking from the legal action is to void the agreement.


It may seem surprising that HMRC can accuse a company of a tax fraud involving huge sums of


money, and limit that accusation to a dispute about a clearance agreement.


As a matter of law, HMRC has complete discretion to deal with tax fraud by criminal prosecution or


by civil litigation or contract settlement; and in civil litigation it is up to HMRC to decide whether to


plead fraud at all, regardless of the facts of the case.


When HMRC �rst �led their particulars of claim in January 2019, there was no mention of fraud,


with HMRC arguing that the clearance should be set aside on the ground that GE had made an


innocent misrepresentation, a material non-disclosure, or a mistake.28


The fraud allegation was only introduced by lawyers acting for HMRC once proceedings had


already started. GE challenged whether HMRC should be allowed to do this on a procedural basis.


The High Court recently ruled that HMRC were able to amend their claim to fraudulent


misrepresentation on the basis of a failure to fully disclose information relevant to the case. HMRC


were not allowed to proceed on the basis that GE had positively made false statements of fact


regarding the purpose of the transactions and their tax treatment during the clearance

negotiations. This was in part because after 15 years HMRC were not able to produce enough


evidence detailing the statements that they alleged GE had made. In his conclusions, Mr Justice


Zacaroli said:


“while I have rejected the attempts to infer many years after the event that speci�c positive


representations could be implied from limited references in the contemporaneous documents,


the essential allegation which lay at the heart of Mr Jones QC’s submissions – that GE failed to


disclose the complete picture, and that it did so deliberately – will be permitted to go to trial on the


various alternative legal bases asserted by HMRC. I stress that, beyond the conclusion that there is


a suf�cient pleading for this purpose, and that the prospects of success cannot be shown to be


fanciful on an interlocutory application such as this, I say nothing about the merits of the claims of


deliberate non-disclosure or fraud.”


Despite HMRC having an arguable case that GE obtained a tax advantage though a deliberate


non-disclosure, as revealed in the case documents, at no point didHMRC conduct a criminal


investigation or even a civil fraud investigation under HMRC’s Code of Practice 9.29 In fact, it was


revealed in the Zacaroli judgment that at no point during HMRC’s 8 year investigation into the


matter did they even mention fraud30 even though the facts of this case as alleged by HMRC


appear to �t the examples of the kind of circumstances in which it states it will generally consider


starting a criminal investigation.


These include “where, pursuing an avoidance scheme, reliance is placed on a false or altered


document or such reliance or material facts are misrepresented to enhance the credibility of a


scheme”, “where deliberate concealment, deception, conspiracy or corruption is suspected” and


“where materially false statements are made or materially false documents are provided in the


course of a civil investigation”.31


This will not come as a surprise to many. There has been for a long time a general reluctance on


the part of HMRC to use the tools it has to combat tax fraud when it faces complex tax avoidance


schemes operated by large multinational companies.


HMRC rarely brings cases of complex tax avoidance by large corporates to court. It has never


brought criminal charges against companies or their advisers for dishonest implementation of


complex tax avoidance schemes. Speaking in 2005 to Accountancy Age, Dave Hartnett suggested


that the reason why HMRC did take a more aggressive approach to tax fraud was that that sort of


thing simply didn’t happen in the UK. He said:


‘The dividing line between evasion and avoidance is the line which is


honesty. Advisers in America became dishonest. I haven’t seen that to anything like the same


extent in the UK,’32


But according to HMRC’s case against GE, that kind of dishonesty was happening with a major US


corporation operating in the UK.This case also speaks to the problem of de�ning tax avoidance as


being “perfectly legal”. Hybrid arbitrage schemes would usually be considered a form of avoidance.


However, given the anti-avoidance rules in place dealing with these and other schemes, many tax


avoidance schemes rely upon some form of fraudulent misrepresentation in order to operate.33

Many other countries are far less reticent to tackle tax avoidance as a matter of fraud than the


UK.34 In the US, the IRS has brought criminal charges against major accountancy �rms for


devising and marketing tax avoidance schemes. Under European civil law jurisdictions, cases that


the UK would consider as avoidance are regularly prosecuted as tax fraud.35


There are now more and more voices in the UK calling for HMRC to change the way it approaches


tax fraud, most recently, the All Party Group on Responsible Tax published a paper which called for


HMRC to launch a criminal investigation against the promoters of tax avoidance schemes if any


scheme they promoted was found to fail the General Anti-Avoidance Rule.36


If HMRC are successful in their case, it may well open the door to HMRC taking a more robust


approach to tackling large and complex tax avoidance schemes.


The case of HMRC vs IGE and others is scheduled to go to a full trial in July 2021.

35Another good example of this is the current cum-ex scandal gripping many European countries,


that has seen police raids on major law �rms as part of an investigation into tax fraud. Cum-ex


fraud is referred to as dividend-stripping in the UK and is pursued as an avoidance issue.
