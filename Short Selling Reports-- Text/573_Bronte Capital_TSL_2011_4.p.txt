Bronte Capital enters strategic partnership with Diageo -
maker of Guinness beer. Oh and a comment on Trina Solar
Bronte Capital have entered into a strategic partnership with Diageo - the maker of Guineess. But we
haven't really. We are in a pub in London knocking back a pint of the black liquid. Guinness tastes
better in the old country. [It is the old country to an Australian...] 
 
We now have a commercial arrangement with Diageo - albeit a temporary (though tasty) one. But that
has not stopped us writing a press-release trumpeting this "strategic partnership". I may send a copy
to the news wires to see if they will run it. 
 
In all seriousness they probably would. They ran this: 
 


CHANGZHOU, China, Aug. 17, 2011 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- 
Trina Solar Limited (TSL) ("Trina Solar" or the "Company"), a leading integrated
manufacturer of solar photovoltaic (PV) products from ingots to modules, today
announced that through its subsidiary, Trina Solar Australia Pty Ltd, it has signed a
strategic partnership with Origin Energy Australia ("Origin"), the leading Australian
integrated energy company. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Trina Solar is expected to supply Origin with
approximately 22 MW of PV modules over the next twelve months starting from the third
quarter of 2011. 


"We are delighted to initiate our relationship with Origin, Australia's leading energy
retailer and the country's largest green energy retailer with significant investments in
renewable energy technologies," said John Susa, Trina Solar's Country Manager of
Australia and New Zealand. "We are confident that this long-term partnership with
Origin will bolster our ability to expand and strengthen our market position in the
residential segment."


 
Being a cynical sort of guy - and knowing that Origin Energy are reputable I checked this release.
Here is what Origin said. 
 


Hi John, 


Origin has not put out a release as it is simply part of our ongoing supply arrangements
and not material in its own right.  Trina is one of a number of suppliers we use. 


Cheers,

I blogged this response here. 
 
I almost did not need to check. When a party announces a "strategic partnership" and the press
release offers contacts from only one side of the deal then you should be skeptical. Indeed it can
hardly be strategic if only one side comments. 
 
There are other strategic partnerships announced by Trina. In all cases there is no contact given for
the "strategic partner", for they once announced a strategic partnership in Italy. 
 
I am going to be blunt. The Origin press release has as much substance as Bronte's "strategic
partnership" with Guinness. I have no idea about the other strategic arrangements but Trina says

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Bronte Capital enters strategic partnership with Diageo - maker of Guinness beer. Oh and a comment on Trina Solar


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/10/bronte-capital-enters-strategic.html 2/7


Posted by John Hempton at 4:13 AM  


some strange things about Italy. For instance in the last conference call the chief operating officer
said: 
 


I have been waiting for Italy since I got here. So, we are actually seeing some good
activity finally. And we have some pickup in activity. We see it. Obviously, our historic
Italian account is at the utilities. We also see Spanish accounts that a lot of them
actually served projects there. So, after much waiting and unclarity, we are seeing some
pickup in demand. There is – we still have a mix of utility projects in commercial rooftop
there. And so what we are seeing moved quicker was the stuff that was utility that was
finishing off and now it’s blending into commercial rooftop.


 
It is possible that Italy was taking off just as he said this - but it seemed unlikely to us. After all the
banks in Southern Europe were under sharply increasing financial stress at precisely the time of this
conference call and funding for long term projects (like solar) was drying up. I did not believe the
statement. Maybe it was true - but there is a problem with statements about insignificant "strategic
partnerships". Those statements predispose you to not believe further statements. 
 
So here is what I believe. I believe Trina is burning cash increasingly fast. So fast that it is in deep
trouble. 
 
Trina, through operating cash burn and capital expenditure chewed through $136 million last quarter. I
blogged the calculation here. Chinese banks funded this. 
 
 
The average selling price during the quarter was $1.46 per watt (reference given here). 
 
The prices per watt have fallen to $1.10 or below when priced wholesale. 
 
So revenue per watt is running 36c lower than during the quarter. 
 
The costs per watt have dropped too. Polysilicon has dropped from say $48 to $38 per kilogram - but
exact numbers are hard to find.  At 6 grams per watt the costs per watt thus dropped 6c. Efficiency
gains add another 2c reduction in costs per watt. 
 
Nonetheless margin per watt will be 28c per watt lower than last quarter. 
 
Production is going to be (at least) 450 million watts - so aggregate margin is going to be $112 million
lower than last quarter. 
 
There won't be any tax paid - or anything like that - but the company looks like it will burn through
$136 million plus $112 million in cash - more if stuff keeps accumulating in warehouses - less if the
hard-selling they are doing actually works. 
 
$248 million per quarter - or roughly a billion dollars a year is a little bit much for Trina to bear. 
 
Unless there is something dramatically wrong with my calculation Trina is doomed. Not even a
Chinese bank comes at a billion a year funding requirement just to stay in business. 
 
 
Now of course all of this is my estimates. I can only go on public information and my own inquiry and
my own analysis. I wish I could just use Trina's statements but - and it might just be the PR people
who have done this - Trina has devalued its statements with overblown puff pieces about "strategic
partnerships". 
 
But I have trouble trusting Trina. And you should have trouble trusting me. I am effectively short the
stock. Besides, I have just entered into a very enjoyable "strategic partnership" with Diageo. 
 
And I might just have another Guinness. 
 
 
John

Did you ever get any color into the silicon purchase agreements? Just those alone could
suck up a large chunk of revenues last I checked.

With all the good English ales out there, you're in London touting an Irish stout and
claiming it tastes better there? (Legend has it that Guinness tastes better within an hour
or two of delivery time from the Dublin brewery. My taste buds weren't good enough to
compare across locations.)

Not sure that an Australian of, for instance, Greek descent, would see the UK as the old

Most Aussies can trace ancestry back to the UK, but an increasingly large number
cannot. 
 
Of course, one thing that all Aussies can presumably still agree upon is that Poms

I too have a strategic partnership with Guinness. It's quite profitable... for them. 
 
 
I was also disappointed you didn't have a fake press release for your partnership. I was
looking forward to reading it.

Great idea. Pints and Partnerships for all. 
 
Perhaps Bronte could enter into a "Preferred Provider" relationship with Diageo too. Or
they could become your "exclusive supplier" of Guiness.  
 
Don't forget to file the 8Ks.

If most of the Solar companies are on the same ship then it comes to mind who will
survive. We can play with the numbers and estimates per our liking. China, US, and India
need alternative power or risk letting oil price run wild. Short term investers need to worry
if they run investments on margin accounts, but long term investers need to find the
companies which will survive the hard crash of solar industries before start of
consolidation there. FSLR and TSL seems to remain leaders even during negative profit
cycle they have secured long term finances to keep themselves above water. I think this
one analyst comment vs. 90% analyst who see Trina shining in long term need to be
considered as well. Not saying one analyst is wrong, others can't be off the track either.

Your work is basically right. I would just add spot poly is closer to $28 at the moment than
$45 which will save them some more money, and I expect EVA pricing will also be hit as
there is margin in that industry to be squeezed (look at STR Holdings). Also, that was an

operating cash burn AND capex and you have to expect they will stop buying more
furnaces and building factories...unless you think a lot of the capex is ongoing or
somehow fudged that should save at least half off of that quarterly 130m burn.  
 
The working capital situation is unlikely to get better in short term but you may see a
smaller absolute increase in receivables and inventory...then again you may not. 
 
Curious though why this is your number one short in the space. You think they are a fraud
I guess? STP also has a huge debt load, FSLR uncompetitive pricing/cost structure, STR
Holdings fat margins and competition, Satcon inverters is essentially bankrupt. 
 
Seems like TSL will survive bc the Chinese gov wants to have some 
solar companies survive in China. TSL looks more saveable than an STP or LDK to me.

On page 41 of the Weekend West Australian newspaper, Retravision was running a full
page ad for Solar. Install a hot water system, get a 1.5W solar power system with inverter
for free. Not sure who their suppliers are, but doesn't seem to bode well for the solar
industry profits.

To your point and mine about "strategic partnership" this is from LONGTOP - a company
which did not exist: 
 
Longtop has established strong vendorship with Microsoft and we are one of the largest
Chinese vendors that provide software development and testing services to Microsoft.
Longtop has built a Microsoft Offsite Facility in Beijing recently. Longtop has received
wide recognition for its global software service. It was ranked as the “Fifth Emerging
Outsourcing Provider in Asia”, one of “Top 100 Global Services Companies” by the well-
known IT magazine InformationWeek in 2007 and 2008, and in the “Global Services 100”
by neoIT and the Global Services Consultation Company in 2007, 2008, and 2009. 
 
=== 
 
Did Microsoft know it was aiding and abetting fraud?

@ Anonymous who commented about Si spot prices: doesn't much matter as TSL's
purchase agreements (primarily from GCL) are already spelled out and there isn't too
much wiggle room. They've gotta buy (again, with not much wiggle room or many "outs")
some $15bn of it through 2020.

Interim Management Statement 
 
 
 
In light of the ongoing difficult market conditions in the solar industry PV Crystalox Solar
PLC ("the Group") has brought forward its Interim Management Statement to today's
date. This announcement is provided in accordance with the UK Listing Authority's
Disclosure and Transparency Rules, for the period from 30 June 2011 to the date of this
announcement. 
 
 
 
The anticipated recovery in PV end-market demand stimulated by lower module prices
has been weaker than expected in the second half of 2011, particularly in Germany, the
largest global market. Furthermore, the hitherto expected year-end rally, driven by the
pull-in effect of installations in advance of the feed-in tariff cut, does not appear to be
materialising. 
 
 
 
Since our interim results statement wafer prices on the spot market have decreased by
more than 20%, meaning that the overall decline since April is greater than 50%. This
decline has been driven by a combination of weak demand coupled with significant over-
capacity and high inventories. 
 
 
 
Some of our customers have reduced production in response to the weak market
conditions and accordingly the Group now expects full year shipment volumes to be in the
range 360-390MW. This is broadly flat in comparison with the 378MW shipped the
previous year but below the 400-450MW indicated at the time of our interim results on 18
August 2011. 
 
 
 
In light of these market conditions the Board has resolved to take appropriate actions to
manage the business through these difficult times and to conserve the Group's cash. In

the short term the Group intends to reduce production output at its UK ingot and German
wafer operations. The Board also intends to suspend production temporarily at its
polysilicon facility in Bitterfeld, Germany. Regrettably these actions will lead to significant
job losses in the UK and short time working in Germany. In addition the Group will
continue to have discussions with its suppliers in order to reduce costs and will continue
to seek further methods of achieving greater efficiencies within the Group's operations. 
 
 
 
As a result of the lower volumes, the intense pricing pressure, and the associated
inventory write-downs the Group now expects to incur an operating loss for the full year.
The Group continues to review the carrying value of assets, and the result would be a
significant non-cash impairment at the year-end, if market conditions persist. 
 
 
 
The Group's cash position remains positive and the above measures have been
instigated to minimise cash outflows, and the Group expects to have a healthy cash
balance at the end of the year. Whilst the market conditions are currently difficult, the
Board's actions are a necessary response, designed to preserve the capabilities within
the business. The Group continues to believe that the medium-term outlook for solar
installations remains positive and in the importance of protecting the Group's capabilities
and cash for the future. The Group continues to review industry conditions on an ongoing
basis.
