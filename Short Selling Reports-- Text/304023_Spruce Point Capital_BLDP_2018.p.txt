Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Believes BLDP Is A “Strong Sell”  
Sees 35% - 70% Downside For The Following Reasons:


What’s Driving The Ballard Bull Story


• Ballard’s stock had a tremendous run in 2017 (+167%) based on strong revenue growth, margin improvement and a perception that
the commercialization of fuel cells is on the horizon (i.e., “hype”).  This improvement occurred despite Ballard’s portfolio largely 
consisting of businesses in run off (e.g., backup power, materials handling), experiencing uncertainty (portable power) or in very early 
stages of development (e.g., drones).  The primary force underpinning recent growth and future expectations has been Ballard’s China 
partnership efforts with Synergy Ballard JV (customer/partner) and Broad Ocean (customer/distributor).  At current valuations an
investment in Ballard with an intermediate time horizon is essentially a bet on China Heavy-Duty Motive (“HDM”) success. We have 
conducted on the ground due diligence in China and believe that Ballard’s Chinese growth ambitions are likely to fail from weak 
partnerships with Broad Ocean and Synergy, and a market that is not developed enough to support fuel cell vehicle growth; Déjà vu, 
Ballard’s last China deal with Azure resulted in a contract breach and revising guidance lower in early 2015; investors should brace for 
similar disappoints this time around too


China Industry Challenges


• Unfortunately, the Chinese hydrogen fuel cell market is still in very nascent stages of development.  We believe there are currently only 
36 licensed fuel cell vehicles on the road in China, only six refueling stations (one is public), and limited planning being devoted to 
hydrogen sourcing and transportation.  In Spruce Point’s view, the lack of refueling infrastructure, confusion around refueling subsidies 
and abysmal refueling station economics pose the greatest threat to fuel cell vehicle (“FCV”) commercialization. Not surprisingly, there 
are only two scale auto manufacturers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles today and we expect this number to grow to only six by the end of 
2018.  At this point, it still remains highly uncertain if China will develop the fuel cell vehicle market beyond an experimental phase


• As it pertains to Membrane Electrode Assemblies (“MEA”)/Stack/Engine production in China, the focus area for Ballard, there are 
actually two (rarely discussed) competing “value chains”.  We believe that Ballard’s partners, Yunfu City Government (Synergy) and 
Broad Ocean, are relatively weak given their lack of network into the central ministries of China and their limited success to date in 
partnering with the State-Owned Enterprise’s (“SOE”) that are the primary agents for delivering on policy


Ballard Partner Specific Challenges


• It wasn’t long ago that Broad Ocean was a humble manufacturer of electric motors for appliances (e.g., air conditioners).  As the US 
property cycle peaked, Broad Ocean decided to diversify itself with the purchases of Prestolite (auto electronics) and Shanghai Edrive
(electric vehicle power trains) in 2014 and 2015, respectively.  When Broad Ocean announced the Ballard deal in 2016, it had no prior 
hydrogen fuel cell experience, but likely hoped to leverage the company’s local connections with automakers in the electric vehicle 
space.  Unfortunately, Broad Ocean has failed to deliver partnership opportunities to Ballard with the likes of BAIC (Shanghai Edrive’s 
largest customer) and Yutong (leader in Chinese bus production), both of whom have chosen Sinohytec despite relying heavily on 
Shanghai Edrive for electric vehicles

Spruce Point Believes BLDP Is A “Strong Sell”  
Sees 35% - 70% Downside For The Following Reasons:


Ballard Partner Specific Challenges (cont’d)


• Since the Ballard deal was inked, Broad Ocean has announced $1 bn in hydrogen investment related projects.  However, in 18 months, Spruce 
Point has yet to see one fuel cell module produced or vehicle using its technology.  Spruce Point believes that Broad Ocean appears to be 
experiencing a cash crunch as a result of its recent acquisitions, hydrogen investments, and inability to sell any of the MEAs that it has 
purchased from Ballard to date.  We also believe Broad Ocean’s cash flow issues have likely contributed to the firm backing out of the Wuhan 
project and perhaps are responsible for the stalled/collapsed Zhongtong JV.  Barring a successful convertible bond issuance this year, in what 
has been a difficult issuance market in China, we anticipate that Broad Ocean will be unable to continue to make good on purchasing 
commitments, and that 2018 purchases from Ballard/JV are at high risk of falling well short of 2017 levels


• Given that Broad Ocean is the primary customer of the Synergy “Supply Chain” we would expect that there is a strong probability that 
Synergy will look to renegotiate the Ballard “Take or Pay” Agreement or exit the relationship completely.  If these events playout as we 
anticipate, then not only will China sales disappoint, and the current backlog go largely unrealized, but it will have the knock on effect of 
failing to achieve the desired cost reduction in MEA production for other applications. Broad Ocean owns 17.2m Ballard shares and its 2yr 
hold period ends July 2018. We expect this to be a major overhang on Ballard’s share price


Spruce Point’s Take on Potential Outcomes (probability)
1. The Chinese fuel cell market doesn’t move beyond an experimental stage in the near term (20%)
2. The Chinese fuel cell market slowly commercializes, but Broad Ocean fails to raise capital and the “Synergy Value Chain” fails. This likely 


translates into a missed, or greatly reduced market opportunity, for Ballard in China over the long-term (40%)
3. The Chinese market slowly commercializes, Broad Ocean is able to raise the capital needed to wait out the maturation of the industry, and 


eventually makes good on Ballard commitments.  Synergy renegotiates take or pay (duration or value) (30%)
4. The Chinese market rapidly commercializes, and Broad Ocean is able to raise the capital needed to make Synergy commitments in the near 


term.  Synergy take or pay agreement holds (mgmt base case: 10%)   


Valuation And Reasons We See 35% - 70% Downside Risk


• Ballard’s heavily retail Investor base needs to exercise significant skepticism. Ballard and its management have virtually nothing at risk if its 
China growth ambitions fail. The company committed just $1.0m to the China JV, and insiders own a miniscule 0.45% of the Ballard’s stock. 
Buying into the sell-side analysts bull case for 47% upside to $5.60, requires a leap of faith that it can execute flawlessly in China with its 
partners, and finally turn a profit after years of losses and rampant share dilution. Analysts are unjustifiably giving Ballard an all-time high 
multiple, while tweaking discount rates lower to justify their price targets. Our on the ground research in China tells a different story: we 
believe the Company is set-up to fail yet again on its Chinese growth ambitions just like Azure was a failure in years past. We believe that 
Ballard shares should trade in line with its fuel cell peers historical valuation range at 2.0x-2.5x and 1.5x-3.5x Price/Book Value and 
Price/LTM Sales, respectively.  These ranges imply a long-term price target for BLDP of $1.15 - $2.50 per share or 35% - 70% downside risk

Ballard: A Retail Driven Stock


Ballard is 76% owned by the public, making it a heavily retail driven stock. Ballard’s management and 
directors own virtually no shares and its current ownership is near all-time lows. When compared against 


other speculative fuel cell publicly owned peers, we find that Ballard has the least support from the 
financial institutions and insiders.

Capital Structure and Valuation


Enthusiasm is running high that Ballard is well positioned in a Chinese FCV bus market on the brink of 
commercialization; its valuation multiple is pushed to all-time highs. Our on the ground research in China will 


illustrate why Ballard is again set to disappoint.

Déjà Vu: Ballard’s China Promotion


Spruce Point believes Ballard investors should be cautioned by its history of partnership failures in China, 
notably Azure in 2013-15. Our on the ground due diligence strongly suggests this time around with 


Synergy/Broad Ocean will result in disappointment and a significant stock price correction. This will likely 
result in more losses and continued share dilution.

Summary of Red Flags From On The Ground 
Diligence In China


The investigators work confirmed the nascent stages of the China fuel cell market and raised the following red flags


There presently aren’t any hydrogen research institutes operational at the national hydrogen fuel cell development 
zone in Nanhai District of Foshan, Guangdong


Investigators saw a total of 5 demonstration buses in Yunfu Tech Park and only two had license plates


Industry sources claim that Synergy Ballard JV is only capable of producing a few hundred stacks per year


A government official stated if there was a cheaper domestic MEA, that performed well, they would prefer to switch 
from Ballard


Ballard and local press releases indicate that Foshan has produced 114 FCV buses.  Despite originally being told buses 
were “offsite being painted” a Foshan employee claimed that far fewer buses have been produced to date and only 11 
are licensed


Yunfu Tech Park currently has a single refueling station with an idle mobile hydrogen production unit


Despite public claims, the refueling station attendant told our investigators that there are no demonstration lines 
operating in Guangdong and that no bus lines are in service in Sanshui or Yunfu.  They also only refuel one bus per day


In order to build an appropriate appreciation for Ballard’s China HDM opportunity we engaged a China based 
research firm to perform key site visits and deeply diligence Synergy and Broad Ocean.

China Fuel Cell Market In Nascent 
Stages of Development


• China is still at the very beginning of an experimental phase of developing fuel cell vehicles, much like the US was over a 
decade ago.  It is not at all certain that China will develop a fuel cell vehicle market beyond an experimental phase


• We estimate that there are currently 36 licensed fuel cell vehicles on the road in China, all buses and none in regular service
• There are 6 refueling stations, only one is public the other 5 are attached to manufacturers operating facilities
• Current level of HFCV development zone investment only represents 1% of announced plans


• Stated objective of the China Electrical Industry Association in the Blue Book for China’s Hydrogen Industry Infrastructure 
Development is that there will be a total of 10,000 Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) by 2020 and 2,000,000 by 2030 and 
1,000 refueling stations by 2030 (source, source)


• A fundamental flaw in this plan is that 1,000 refueling stations is likely not nearly enough to support millions of vehicles


• Subsidies provided by both local and national governments are critical to the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and 
the necessary refueling infrastructure


• As a result of fraud associated with electric vehicle subsidies, the requirements for fuel cell vehicle subsidies are more 
rigorous, leading to longer payback periods and strains on the supply chains cash flow and working capital (source)


• Subsidies for refueling stations seem less understood and don’t appear to be on the scale necessary to support the 
planned demand for vehicles


• Despite little mention from Ballard or the Sell Side Analysts there are currently three fuel cell “value chains” competing in
China and we expect credible domestic MEA producers to emerge in the next three years


• Companies based in or near Beijing and connected to the major SOE enterprises, like Sinohytec, will always be more 
successful than companies in South China backed by local government and without ties to central SOEs (Synergy)


• Shenzen Centre Power Tech (002733 SHE) has announced plans to invest $754m (RMB 5bn) to develop hydrogen fuel cell 
technology and Snowman (002639 CN) recently purchased a 17.6% stake in Hydrogenics

China Fuel Cell Market In Nascent Stages of 
Development (Continued)


• Only two auto manufacturers have constructed production capacity for hydrogen vehicles at any scale to date. The 
remaining auto manufacturers have announced models and plans to establish production, but are taking a wait and 
see approach 


• Seeking clarity on certain subsidies necessary to make their operations profitable
• Waiting for local governments or State Owned Entities to build a network of refueling stations to make operating 


these vehicles viable


• Spruce Point understands that only six manufactures will be producing in 2018 and estimates total production 
units to be less than 1,250 vehicles


• The biggest challenge the Chinese fuel cell market faces is a lack of refueling station infrastructure
• Based on market research we expect 15 and 45 refueling stations to be operational by the end of 2018 and 2019, 


respectively.  Assuming 50 buses can be refueled a day, this implies the infrastructure can support less than 2,250 
buses in total by end of 2019


• Spruce Point believes that the economics of hydrogen refueling stations are so poor, 12.5 years to repay 
investment amount without overhead (based on Foshan refueling station economics), that they will never be 
built barring significant sustained subsidies from government


• Spruce Point believes that many plans will be postponed or scrapped until the above uncertainties are reduced
• Achieving 10,000 FCV in total by 2020 is possible but 2,000,000 by 2030 is in the realm of fantasy
• Spruce Point expects total FCVs produced by 2030 to be between 200,000 and 300,000 units

Ballard Faces Uphill Battle As One of Three 
Competing Fuel Cell Value Chains in China


Despite little discussion of competition in China from Ballard, Spruce Point believes that the “Sinohytec chain” is 
best positioned to capture the China fuel cell opportunity given relationships with influential research 


universities and manufacturers.

Transition to New Energy Vehicles Has 
Negatively Impacted Broad Ocean Cash Flows


• Broad Ocean’s performance was so weak that the Shenzhen stock exchange, in August 2017, requested a formal 
explanation from the company, including why the Shanghai Edrive acquisition has performed so far below guidance


• Cash flow from operations has been negative all year, and the rebound in new energy vehicle sales in Q3 did not 
translate into improved cash flow:  


• Q4 cash flow should improve as new energy vehicle sales will peak in that period; however, we expect it will be a 
small positive number

Ballard’s History of Product Promotion 
and Disappointment


Ballard has historically hyped segments or products/partnerships within segments only later to restructure, exit or 
change strategic direction.  Will the China HDM 2.0 Strategy be the latest disappointment?


• "So we will have some deployments in 2015, but I don’t view them as scale 
deployments, they will position us for 2016 though in that market segment 
very strongly." – CEO MacEwen (Q1 2015 Earnings Call)


• "We have added now, I think 10 to 12 new channel partners that are better 
positioned for higher volume sales as we move forward." – CEO MacEwen
(Q2 2015 Earnings Call)


• Asset impairment charges of $1.2 million Q1 16


• Sale of Methanol Telecom Backup Power to CHEM and 
tech solution deal with Synergy for licenses Q2 16


• "We are working very hard as you know to achieve the program of record 
status. So we expect to see a very strong growth year for Protonex in 2016 
in the $20 million revenue range and expect to see on the strength, 
particularly of the program of record achievement that we expect. We 
expect to see a very strong growth year in 2017 as well." – CEO MacEwen
(Q4 2015 Earnings Call)


• Trailing 12 month revenue of only $9.2 as of Q3 17 


• Ballard announces narrowed focus and further cost 
reductions at Protonex Subsidiary - Jan 18


• "In Q1, we experienced significant year-over-year growth in fuel cell stack 
shipments to Plug power for the material handling market. We continue to 
strengthen our collaboration with Plug as they secure repeat and new 
customer business. - CEO MacEwen (Q1 2015 Earnings Call)


• “China should more than compensate the anticipated 
reduction in revenue from Plug Power (PLUG) as that 
company continues to increasing use its own stacks as 
against purchasing those from BLDP. We are not 
expecting any significant revenues from PLUG beginning 
in 2018.” – Rodman March 17


• Multi-year definitive agreements to support Azure Hydrogen’s zero 
emission fuel cell bus program for the China market.   Ballard agreed to 
provide a license, associated equipment and Engineering Services to enable 
assembly of its FCvelocity bus power modules by Azure in China. As per the 
agreements, once this assembly capability was established, Azure would 
assemble modules with fuel cell stacks to be supplied exclusively by Ballard.  
September 2013


• Ballard announces that it has given termination notice 
on two licensing agreements in China as a result of 
material breaches by Azure Hydrogen.  Impairment

Is Ballard’s Management Team Becoming 
Increasingly Promotional About China HDM?


Ballard seems to have “magically” converted Broad Ocean’s 5 Year Expectations into Purchase Orders between 
the Ballard Investor Day and the Needham Conference.  Clarity on the >300 bus order would also be helpful.  


Purchase orders of these size appears to be missing from Ballard’s shrinking order backlog.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Market in China
24


History of China New Energy Policy


• The Chinese government introduced subsidies for electric vehicles in 2014.  Generous subsidies attracted investment and 
fraudulent activity (source)


• By 2016 there was an investigation into fraud at 7 auto manufacturers
• Fraud ranged from over-stating performance to achieve a higher subsidy, selling units to related parties but never using 


them, to failing to produce and faking statistics


• From September 2016 to February 2017 seven manufacturers were heavily fined


• As a result of the above behavior, subsidies were reduced by around 30% in 2017 (source)
• There are now strict compliance requirements. Subsidies will only be paid once a vehicle has been registered
• When vehicles are sold to related party leasing fleets, subsidies will only be paid when the vehicle has been used for 


30,000 km 


• Subsidies were historically paid with a one to two year time lag.  Given stricter compliance standards, payments are likely 
to be pushed out further creating a larger cash flow drag on vehicle producers (Ballard purchaser chain)


• When Synergy and Broad Ocean moved into the hydrogen fuel cell market they would have expected looser requirements 
for subsidy payments


• The government is now concerned there is excess capacity in electric vehicles and has pushed out a mandated 
requirement for 10% of all vehicles produced to be electric vehicles to 2019


As a result of fraud related to electric vehicle subsidies, Synergy and Broad Ocean now face much tighter 
requirements and longer payouts than they would have expected when partnering with Ballard in 2016.

Government Policy and Subsidies


• The central government pays a subsidy to the purchaser of a 
vehicle. Due to fraudulent claims for electric vehicle 
subsidies, a car sold to a manufacturers fleet must achieve 
30,000 km before the subsidy may be claimed


• Local governments subsidize producers to the same level as 
the central government.  Local government subsidies appear 
to vary widely, but are at least 50% of total subsidies paid per 
vehicle.  A local government will use subsidization to induce 
manufactures to establish local operations


Both central and local government subsidies play a critical role in supporting the economic viability of the hydrogen 
fuel cell industry.  Delays in subsidy payments are resulting in FCV manufacturers being short working capital.  


Vehicle Type Subsidy


Passenger sedan RMB 200,000


Delivery van and small bus RMB 300,000


Heavy duty trucks and large buses RMB 500,000


Central Government Purchaser Subsidy Schedule through 2020


Vehicle
Total Cost of 
Production


Local subsidy Central Subsidy Post subsidy cost


Feichi 8.5 meter bus RMB 1.6m RMB 0.5m RMB 0.5m RMB 0.6m


SAIC FCV80 SUV RMB 1.3m RMB 0.8m RMB 0.2m RMB 0.3m


Dongfeng 3.3 ton delivery van RMB 1m RMN 0.5m RMB 0.5m 0


• Local governments not only subsidize production but also purchase and operate the vehicles.  For example, the Foshan City 
government has announced a vehicle leasing subsidy for FCV delivery vans (fsonline.com)


• Our investigators also heard that they can get a subsidy of around RMB 80,000 per year to operate bus lines from the city 
government which is the same amount as a diesel bus operating subsidy (equals 50% of the fuel cost of operation a diesel bus).  
They can also get the advertising rights for the exterior of the bus


• Our investigators heard from manufacturers that subsidy payments are very slow.  The subsidies for 2015 were only being paid in 
Q4 2017.  As a result, companies in the FCV manufacturing value chain are all short of working capital

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle Development Zones 
In Nascent Stages (Cont’d)


• The United Nations Development Program (“UNDP”) has announced a hydrogen energy development program, working 
with China’s Ministry of Science, in five cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Foshan, Yancheng and Rugao and has US $62 million in 
funding for the project (source)


• Two of the cities, Rugao and Foshan, have had formal launch ceremonies for the cooperation
• When Investigators checked with Foshan about the UNDP program they seemed a little puzzled and unsure about the 


nature of the cooperation


• Foshan stated that the UNDP had sponsored the purchase of one hydrogen demonstration bus via tender and had 
provided financial support for a conference


• Some projects have been announced multiple times each time with a new corporate partner, like the Wuhan zone that 
was originally a cooperation with Broad Ocean and now with Shenzen Center Power.  This project remains in the planning 
stage.  Local governments, it seems are unwilling or unable to provide the required subsidies


To date the UNDP programs have had very limited impact on the development of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle 
industry in China. It also appears that local governments are unwilling or unable to provide the required subsidies.

Overview of China Domestic Fuel Cell 
Manufacturers


Shenzen Centre Power:


• Shenzhen Center Power Tech Co Ltd (002733 SHE), a listed producer of lithium batteries, has announced that 
it will invest RMB 5 billion to develop hydrogen fuel cell technology


• Their objective is to produce 100,000 integrated fuel cell modules and electric motors within 5 years (source)
• They are establishing a new energy manufacturing facility in Wuhan Development Zone


• Ballard’s partner Broad Ocean had previously announced a similar investment plan in Wuhan and that has 
now been cancelled and replaced by Shenzhen Centre Power Tech Co (source)


• Shenzhen Centre Power has a technical cooperation with Qinghua University’s fuel cell research center to 
commercialize its technology


Sunrise Power:


• Sunrise Power was established in 2001 as a spin off from a government backed research institute.  It has 
200 staff and produces MEA, fuel cell stacks, and fuel cell engines for vehicles and power back up systems


• Sunrise Power is suppling fuel cell engines, using their own MEA, for 100 FAW logistics vehicles and for 
SAIC’s FCV sedans (source, source)


Snowman (002639 CN):


• Domestic listed company that manufactures refrigeration equipment purchased 17.6% of Hydrogenics, 
Ballard’s key competitor, on April 29th, 2017 for $21 million (source)


• Snowman, prior to this acquisition, has acquired other international companies to become a supplier of fuel 
cell air supply systems


• We expect Snowman to emerge as a key competitor to Broad Ocean and the “Ballard Supply Chain” in China

Sinohytec Overview


Companies based in Beijing and connected to the major SOE enterprises, like Sinohytec, will generally be more 
successful than companies in South China backed by a local government without ties to central SOE’s (Synergy).  


• Sinohytec, a Beijing based hydrogen fuel cell engine producer, is the biggest competitor to Ballard and its 
partners in China


• We estimate Sinohytec presently has approximately 50% market share (Ballard ~40%)


• Sinohytec purchases MEAs from a variety of foreign suppliers like 3M and Hydrogenics and they do not plan 
to develop their own MEA


• Sinohytec engines are under the hood of 7 of the 13 approved vehicle producers by the Ministry of 
Information Industries Technology 


• Sinohytec works closely with its second largest investor Qinghua University, the “Harvard of China”
• Many Senior government, Communist Party and SOE management elites are graduates of Qinghua


• They have already sold 244 FCV engines to Zhangjiakou City government through a tender process. We  
estimate that they produced approximately 250 FC engines in 2017

Development Time Line for Fuel Cell Vehicles


From vehicle R&D to commercial production takes around 5 years. From demonstration to commercial 
production will take around 2 years. There will only be two commercial producers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles 


in China in 2018 and we expect at most another 2 in 2019. 


Source: Jcap
31


Automotive Manufacturers Overview


We can identify that of the thirteen approved automotive companies, only six will produce vehicles this year.  
We expect total production from these six in 2018 to be less than 1,250 vehicles.


Automobile Company Market Position Fuel Cell Vehicle Status FC Engine Supplier


Foton Top 5 bus producer Commercial Production Sinohytec/Hydrogenics


SAIC Largest Auto Manufacturer Commercial Production Sunrise Power


Dongfeng Second largest auto manufacturer Demonstration Shanghai Re-fire/Ballard


Foshan Feichi Small bus manufacturer Demonstration Shanghai Re-fire/Ballard


Yutong Largest bus manufacturer Demonstration Sinohytec/Hydrogenics


Shenlong Small bus manufacturer Demonstration Sinohytec/Hydrogenics


FAW Third largest auto manufacturer Planning Sunrise Power


• Ankai and Zhongtong have announced they will produce hydrogen fuel cell vehicles but they appear to 
either remain plans, have been shelved or quietly cancelled


• Changjiang and others have plans to commence production several years from now.  No doubt they are 
delaying to see how refueling infrastructure, subsidies and other critical elements for the industry come 
together before committing to any investment

Most Likely Producers By 2018
32


Overview of Chinese Fuel Cell Vehicle 
Manufacturers – Foshan Feichi


Ballard’s press releases and local government officials would have you believe Foshan Feichi have produced 
114 FCV buses.  Based on our research, we believe they have likely produced less than 50 buses to date, and 


only 11 of those are licensed and on the road. 


Foshan Feichi:
• Foshan Feichi is a tiny regional producer of diesel, LNG and electric buses that has now diversified into hydrogen 


vehicles after becoming a joint venture with the Yunfu local government


• The group operates long distance as well as city buses. About 80% of the buses they build are operated by 
themselves. They operate about 500 buses. They also have a logistics company with 400 trucks.


• Almost all of the buses using Ballard FC technology have been built by Foshan Feichi 


Source: J Capital.   Feichi factory floor, assembling electric buses for Foton, no fuel cell vehicles in production.

Overview of Chinese Fuel Cell Vehicle 
Manufacturers – Foton


Broad Ocean’s inability to convince Foton to source its fuel cell engines from Ballard is a significant failure for 
Ballard’s strategic future in China. 


Foton:
• Subsidiary of the state-owned Beijing Automotive Industry Holding (BAIC) the fourth largest automobile manufacturer 


in China 


• BAIC is the joint venture partner of Daimler AG and Hyundai in China  
• Foton is the fifth largest bus manufacturer in China with around 5% market share producing 10,000 buses a year 


including 1,000 electric buses 


• Built a factory to produce FCV in Zhangjiakou Hebei province around 100 km from Beijing.  The production facility, 
recently completed, has installed capacity to build 2,000 buses per year and it is planned to expand to 10,000 in 2018 
(source)


• Sinohytec is supplying the fuel cell engines to Foton from its adjacent manufacturing facility:
• Foton has an order for 100 buses from the city government of Zhangjiakou and is expected to win a further 250  
• Foton can produce a FCV bus at a cost of RMB 1.4 million  
• This is significantly lower than the RMB 1.6 million of Foshan Feichi


• Foton’s decision to source its fuel cell engines from Sinohytec is a significant failure for Ballard’s strategic future in 
China.  Foton will be the largest producer of FCV in China in the next few years


• It also shows the weakness of Broad Ocean. Broad Ocean, despite having a joint venture partnership with BAIC 
producing electric vehicles, was unable to supply fuel cell engines to Foton


• Foton cooperates with Foshan Feichi to produce electric and FCV buses. Yet Ballard, which shares the same ultimate 
partner as Feichi, the Yunfu Government, was unable to become the supplier to Foton FCV bus company

Overview of Chinese Fuel Cell Vehicle 
Manufacturers – SAIC, Yutong, & Dongfeng


SAIC:
• SAIC, an SOE, is the largest automobile manufacture in China and is Volkswagen’s JV partner


• SAIC will produce its first fuel cell vehicle, the FCV80, for use in SUVs in 2018 (source)
• The car will be produced at the company’s Shanghai location and the production line capacity is said to be 2,000 


vehicles a year


• The fuel cell stacks will be provided by Sunrise Power (source)
• SAIC’s choice of using Sunrise Power to supply the fuel cell stacks for the FCV80 again shows the strategic failure 


of Ballard’s choice of partner  


• Broad Ocean, despite providing the electric power train, could not get Ballard fuel cells into the model.  It also 
shows how a subsidy driven market will favor domestic technology over imported technology


Dongfeng:
• Dongfeng, a SOE based in Wuhan, is the second largest automobile manufacturer and its joint venture partners 


include, Honda, Kia, Peugeot, and Renault 


• Based on investigators conversations with industry sources, we believe Dongfeng will build 250 – 300 FCV delivery 
vehicles in 2018.  Equities analysts in China are estimating 400 have been produced to date and that an additional 
2,000 will be built in 2018.  We believe this is overstated (source)


• Ballard will supply the fuel cells and Shanghai Re-Fire will build the fuel cell engines


Yutong:
• Yutong in the largest bus manufacturer with 35% of the market


• It is purchasing the fuel cell modules for its FCV buses from Sinohytec and currently building 100 fuel cell buses 
(source, source)

Overview of Chinese Fuel Cell Vehicle 
Manufacturers – FAW & Shenlong 


FAW:


• FAW is the third largest vehicle manufacture in China and partners with Volkswagen’s Audi division
• It plans to produce FCV delivery vans using Sunrise Power fuel cell modules (source)


Shenlong:


• Shenlong has 1% of the bus market
• The parent company of Shenlong, the listed company Dongxu Optoelectronic Technology Co Ltd (200413 


SHE), owns 5% of Sinohytec (source)


• It is purchasing its fuel cell from Sinohytec and plans to build 100 FCV in 2018

State of Chinese Refueling Stations


• Five of the refueling stations in operation are to service research and development and demonstration 
vehicles and are not in commercial operation (source)


• Only one is licensed to operate commercially


• Spruce Point estimates China has 9 refueling stations under construction and another 30 in the planning stages


• We expect there will be 15 operational refueling stations at the end of 2018 and 45 by the end of 2019
• These quantities are less than the U.S. has now with 60 and Japan with 91, despite a fraction of the total 


number of buses being touted in China


• Each refueling station will take approximately one year to build


China’s hydrogen fuel cell future is impeded by a lack of refueling stations. 
There are currently only six refueling stations in operation (286 globally), located in Beijing, Shanghai, 


Zhengzhou, Dalian, Foshan, and Yunfu.

37


Refueling Station Economics & Challenges


• Hydrogen can be a dangerous gas to transport, costs are high and reliable supply is not assured


• Portable machines that can convert water to hydrogen are available and our investigators saw one in Yunfu 
• It was not in operation as you need to establish an operating area as you would for any chemical plant
• While the plant is portable the infrastructure to use it in China is very expensive


The abysmal economics of refueling stations, even with a subsidy, will discourage any large-scale uptake 


Diesel (liter) Hydrogen (kilogram)
Price RMB 6 45
Consumption per 100 km 40 7
Cost per 100 km RMB 240 315


• If a bus fills up 24 kg each time at a cost RMB1,080 and assuming a gross margin of around 10% then a 
refueling station would make a gross margin of at most of RMB 3,240 per day (assuming 30 buses per day)


• Without paying any overheard or operating costs it would take 12.5 yrs to repay the investment (RMB 15m)


• Operating a hydrogen vehicle is more expensive than a diesel vehicle as the price of hydrogen is higher
• We estimate that 70%-80% of the retail cost of hydrogen is the delivery cost

38


Refueling Stations Future Likely To Hinge On 
Converting Existing Gas Stations to Hybrids


• Petrochina and Sinopec, the two primary owners of gas stations in China, have joined together to build a 
demonstration hydrogen refueling station in Foshan, Guangdong (source)


• Construction was said to commence in December 2017 and to be operational by the end of 2018  


• As these two companies can potentially convert existing gas stations into hybrid petroleum/hydrogen or 
hydrogen stations, the success of this experiment will be one critical step forward for the future of the industry


• With the above being said, based on our research, we believe refueling stations will likely continue to remain 
uneconomic and it will likely take a political directive to drive scale adoption

Key Findings From Investigative 
Research in China
40


Key Takeaways from Investigators Visit to 
Foshan, Guandong


Our investigators visited the Nanhai District of Foshan, Guangdong where the national level hydrogen fuel 
vehicle development zone is located.  To date most of the development appears to be in the planning stage and 


only a single refueling station exists.


• Four hydrogen energy research institutes have been announced, but none are operational
• Investigators drove past one building that is meant to house a research institute that looked abandoned 


and we were told it was being “renovated”


• The local government official did not know when they would start 


• JAC, the tenth largest auto manufacturer, will launch a production facility for passenger cars in 2020
• The location currently consists of an empty field with no infrastructure


• Tyros has produced four FC buses, built by JAC, but none have license plates


• Ruihui, a domestically listed public company focused on LNG, built a refueling station operated by Nanhai 
government.  They do not know of any plans to build additional stations
41


Overview of the Yunfu Technology Park


• Our investigators visited the Yunfu Technology Transfer Industrial Park in Yunfu, Guangdong Province where Ballard’s 
joint venture partner Synergy is located 


• Yunfu is famous for producing cut stone building materials. In fact the Yunfu Technology Transfer Park is on the site of 
the failed Yunfu International Stone Exhibition Park.  The Park began in 2011 with RMB 6 billion in investment and closed 
in 2014 having failed abysmally to attract visitors  (Baidu.com)


• The 200,000 SQM exhibition halls remain empty and unused.  The abandoned hotel now houses visiting experts and the 
research center for the new Technology Transfer Park.  The office building has been repurposed into the local 
government office for developing the park


Source: Baidu.com.  Entrance to the Yunfu Technology Park that reads “China Yunfu International Stone Material Industry City” and is 
surrounded by commodity stone cutting business.

42


Key Takeaways From Investigators Visit 
To Yunfu Technology Park Visit


• Investigators saw a total of 5 demonstration buses in the park and only two had license plates
• Three were 11-meter hydrogen fuel cell buses that were in the original 28 buses produced.  The fuel cell motors they used 


were produced by Ballard 


• Two were 8.5-meter buses that use the Synergy Ballard fuel cell stacks and Shanghai Re-Fire integrated modules.  None 
had a number plate.


• Industry insiders make reference that Synergy Ballard JV may have less annual stack capacity than publicly stated
• The development zone plans to produce 1,000 buses and 1,000 logistics trucks next year
• Industry insiders stated that they believe the Synergy Ballard joint venture is only able to produce a few hundred fuel cell 


stacks per year 


• Our Investigators were shown the Synergy JV display room and informed backup power machines have had poor sales
• A Ballard fuel cell engine with 6 fuel cell stacks and a Shanghai Re-Fire fuel cell engine with 2 fuel cell stacks were displayed
• The Shanghai Re-Fire fuel cell motor is much smaller and used to power the 8.5-meter buses
• The Ballard fuel cell motor powers the 11-meter bus
• Investigators were shown one of the Ballard power back-up machines and told the back-up machines are four times the 


cost of comparable back-up machine and sales have been poor


• A government official clearly stated if there were a cheaper domestic MEA (fuel cell membranes) then they would prefer to 
use that over Ballard’s MEA.  He pointed out the domestic MEA produced by Sunrise Power does not currently perform as 
well as Ballard
43


Key Takeaways from Investigators Visit to 
Yunfu Technology Park Visit


• An Employee of Foshan Feichi claims that less than 50 fuel cell buses have likely been produced to date
• Investigators were taken on a tour of the Foshan Feichi bus manufacturing facility, that was relocated from Foshan in 


2015, and now produces hydrogen fuel cell buses


• The factory was only producing pure electric buses for Foton when visited
• Investigators were told on the tour that Feichi had produced 114 fuel cell buses but they were “offsite being painted”
• An employee of the bus company later stated that he believed they had produced less than 50 fuel cell buses to date, of 


which 11 have license plates


• We believe 28 of those buses were the 11-metre buses


• There is currently a single refueling station with an idle mobile hydrogen production unit
• Investigators visited the refueling station and were told the equipment was imported and the total cost of the refueling 


station was RMB 10 million


• A mobile hydrogen production unit was sitting idle at the refueling station.  It was unable to be put into operation as 
regulations require that it have the infrastructure and operation procedures of a chemical plant


• The cost of hydrogen at this facility was RMB35/kg and 75 – 80% of that cost was transport
• Investigators were told that the local government is building 5 refueling stations in Yunfu and has planned a further 20 


• We believe that a new production facility for hydrogen FCV delivery vehicles, likely operated by Dongfeng, will be 
announced shortly 


• Spruce Point believes Dongfeng is still evaluating if it will produce FCV at an existing facility, in Yunfu or in another region
• Investigators were told the cost to produce a FC logistics truck is RMB 1 million.  The local and central subsidy amounts to 


RMB 1 million there will be no cost.  The local subsidy is paid to the producer and would be RMB700,000/truck.   The 
central subsidy is paid to the purchaser after the vehicle has traveled 30,000 km
44


Key Takeaways from Investigators Visit to 
Yunfu Technology Park Visit


Despite public claims that the Yunfu HFCV bus line is operational, our investigator’s experience indicates otherwise 


• Investigators saw a bus that had local route signage displayed on the front, however, it had no license plate and 
remained motor operating outside the office for the duration of our investigators 2 hour site (below left image).  
This sort of showcase display was common during our work with Chinese reverse merger frauds

Overview of Chinese Fuel Cell Vehicle 
Manufacturers – Foshan Feichi


Ballard’s press releases and the local government officials would have you believe they have produced 300 FCV 
buses.  The reality is that they have likely produced less than 50 buses to date and only 11 of those are licensed 


and on the road. 


Foshan Feichi:
• Our investigators visited the Feichi factory and all the vehicles being produced at the time of visit were pure electric buses
• Most were being produced under license from Foton for delivery to Foton customers in South China.  The outside of the 


buses had Kunming Transport Company painted on them

Findings From Investigators Visit to Foshan 
(Guangdong) Refueling Station


• Our investigators visited the hydrogen refueling station in Danzao Village, Nanhai District Foshan (pictured above).  
It is the only commercial refueling station in China (source)


• The facility cost RMB 15 million to build and is owned by the local government.   All the critical equipment is 
imported from Germany


• There is a rebate of RMB 4 million available for refueling stations of this scale.  They had not applied for the rebate 
and they were not sure how or if it could be obtained


• The station has storage capacity of 350 kg and can refuel about 14 – 15 buses per day.  We were told they only refill 
one bus per day


Source: J Capital.  The first public hydrogen refueling station in Foshan, Guangdong.  


The refueling station attendant told our investigators that they only refuel one bus per day.

Review of Broad Ocean:  
Challenges Faced By A Key Partner Critical 
To Ballard’s Success
48


Overview of Broad Ocean


• Broad Ocean’s organic revenue growth flattened out around FY2012.  The revenue growth achieved since then has all 
come as a result of expensive acquisitions


• Its acquisition strategy has left it laden with debt and downward revisions of new energy subsidies have turned 
operating cash flows negative


• Ballard’s key China partner, much like Ballard itself, has a penchant for making frequent statements about current and 
future projects, but then fails to deliver


In our opinion, Broad Ocean (002249 CH) is a weak partner for Ballard in China.  Based in South China, it lacks a 
network into the central ministries that determine policies and SOE’s that are the agents for delivering on policy.

Broad Ocean: Missed Opportunities & 
Competing Partnerships


• Broad Ocean had hoped to leverage its dominant market share in eclectic power trains to get an edge in supplying 
hydrogen fuel cell modules to automobile manufactures 


• BAIC is its biggest customer for electric vehicle motors and it has a substantial joint venture operation with BAIC for 
electric buses  


• BAIC chose to work with its competitor Sinohytec to supply it with fuel cell modules


• Broad Ocean supplied Yutong, the leader in bus production in China, with electric power trains for its electric buses
• Sinohytec is now supplying Yutong with the fuel cell modules for its initial production of 100 hydrogen fuel cell buses
• This seems to be the motivation for Broad Ocean choosing to establish a joint venture with Zhongtong (000957 CN), one 


of the smaller top ten bus manufactures


• When our investigators met with Broad Ocean they claimed the key manufacturers they are working with are 
Dongfeng, BAIC, Foton, Zhongtong, SAIC and Foshan Feichi bus


• Broad Ocean told us Shanghai Edrive has built 300 to 500 fuel cell engines this year and that most were supplied to SAIC 
for the FCV80 passenger vehicle, Dongfeng for delivery trucks and that a few were supplied to Foshan Feichi for buses


• Our research suggests that apart from a small cooperation with Feichi, Broad Ocean is only really working with 
Dongfeng on a project of any commercial scale


• However, one industry insider told us that Dongfeng was being supplied by Shanghai Re-Fire and not Broad Ocean
• The other auto manufacturers, such as BAIC and SAIC have chosen to work with Sinohytec and Sunrise Power

Broad Ocean: Failed JV with Zhongtong?


• Broad Ocean announced on July 27th, 2017 a RMB 50 million joint venture with Zhongtong to produce and 
operate hydrogen fuel cell buses in Shandong Province


• The joint venture, to be 88% funded by Broad Ocean, was planned to produce around 1,000 units each year


• Zhongtong released a statement about the cooperation on the same day but did not mentioned it in the 1H or 
3Q reports or any other public statements subsequently


• The board approved announcement specifically stated the name of the joint venture as “Shandong Zhongtong 
Broad Ocean Fuel Cell Technology Ltd” (通洋燃料电池科技(山东)有限公司)


• Broad Ocean briefly mentioned the cooperation with Zhongtong in its 1H 2017 report, but was silent on 
the cooperation in the Q3 report and there is no investment cash flow account that matches this level of 
investments


• Our Investigators have checked registration records and this company, nor any other joint venture 
between these two groups, had been legally established as of December 18th, 2017


• We think this joint venture is unlikely to proceed
51


Broad Ocean: Stuffed With Unsold Inventory?


• The plan was for the joint venture with Zhongtong to purchase stacks from Ballard, and later from the Ballard 
Synergy joint venture


• When investigators visited Broad Ocean in November 2017 they were informed that the Ballard Synergy JV is 
currently unable to provide them with fuel cell stacks


• This venture was to produce 1,000 vehicles in 2018 


• As the Ballard Synergy joint venture could not produce the stacks, Broad Ocean then decided in April and June of 
2017 to import a total of 600 fuel cell modules directly from Ballard’s Canadian operations


• Broad Ocean told investigators it has already imported 400 of those modules 


• Investigators heard from competitors that Broad Ocean has failed to sell those 400 motors and this has become a 
huge drag on the company’s cash flow  


• We believe this is further evidence that the joint venture with Zhongtong will not proceed
52


Broad Ocean:  Vehicle Leasing Isn’t In A 
Position To Purchase & Operate FCVs


• Broad Ocean has stated that it will purchase and operate hydrogen fuel cell vehicles using its vehicle leasing business
• This seemed like a good business model in mid 2016 when electric vehicle manufacturers were milking subsidies by 


using their own vehicle leasing business to buy their own production  


• This is now more difficult because a vehicle has to have been used for 30,000 km before a subsidy can be claimed and 
longer to get paid


• Online and in announcements, Broad Ocean claims they have 6,000 vehicles in their fleet  
• When investigators met with Broad Ocean they stated the car leasing business currently only has 4,000 cars and none 


are hydrogen fuel cell vehicles


• Broad Ocean reported RMB 82 million in 1H 2017 from the business which is RMB 20,500 per vehicle. This indicates 
either a low utilization rate or that the number of vehicles is lower


• Broad Ocean is leasing buses and taxis to the city government in Guangzhou and Zhongshan
• They have developed an app for vehicle leasing and charging stations which provides data on vehicle usage. They can 


get a subsidy of around RMB 80,000 year to operate bus lines from the city government and the rights to advertising 
on the exterior of the bus


In our view, Broad Ocean’s leasing company has low capacity and no funds to purchase fuel cell vehicles.  
In our opinion, the idea of Broad Ocean using its leasing business to purchase and operate hydrogen fuel cell 


vehicles remains just a plan, not a reality
53


Broad Ocean: Unsold Inventory Implications 
For Ballard’s Future Revenues


• With Broad Ocean appearing to be stuck with an inventory of 400 Ballard fuel cell modules, this could become a 
drag on Ballard’s sales to Broad Ocean in 2018


• Broad Ocean will need time to sell down inventory before it can buy from Ballard again, and Synergy will struggle 
to make sales to Broad Ocean


• Broad Ocean had only paid $8m of the $29m order for 600 fuel cell modules by Q3 2017.  As they have taken 
delivery of 400 fuel cell modules, we can expect Ballard to record another $12m in sales for this order in Q4 2017


• We estimate that Broad Ocean at best will sell about 500 fuel cell engines in 2018
• It is unlikely that Broad Ocean will buy more than 100 fuel cell stacks or engines from Ballard or its China joint 


venture in 2018 


• It looks like Ballard may have stuffed the channel with sales in 2017, and as a result, sales to China in 2018 will be 
lower than 2017


• We should expect Synergy to renegotiate its take or pay with Ballard in 2018
Valuation and Downside Scenario

Sell-Side Analysts Naturally Bullish

Average Price Target
% Upside From $3.80 Price


$5.60
+47%


Ballard’s sells-side supporters, all based in the US and likely challenged in staying on top of a 
quickly evolving and complex Chinese market dynamics, see nearly 47% upside to $5.60 per 


share. We find it odd that Ballard is not endorsed by any Canadian brokers given its headquarters in 
British Columbia and dual-listing on the TSE.


1) Rodman & Renshaw has historically been associated with fraudulent Chinese companies. Although Ballard is Canadian based, its entry 
into China and promotion of the opportunity merits caution

Bull Market Economics: 
It’s All About “Potential” Business


According to analyst Lake Street, 83% of Ballard’s value is “potential” new business.
Ballard has been public since 1995 with countless failures to deliver profits. Investors should no longer be 


paying for potential, but rather tangible earnings and a sustainable business model

Bull market economics are at work when analysts justify higher prices by increasing multiples and 
changing discount rate assumptions. 


We question how much on the ground diligence in China has been done by these analysts.

Insider Ownership of Ballard’s Shares

Investors need to take a step back and realize that Ballard and its management have virtually nothing at 
risk if its China growth ambitions fail. It committed just $1.0m to the JV, and insiders own a miniscule 


0.45% of the Ballard’s stock – near all-time lows.

Approximately 35% - 70% Downside Risk 
In Ballard’s Share Price


Ballard is currently trading near an all-time high valuation on the belief its China growth story will materialize and 
profits will finally appear. Our on the ground research in China suggests a different base case outcome of financial 


disappointment. We believe Ballard is a “show-me” story given its numerous prior failures and should trade closer to 
long-term valuation multiples for speculative, money-losing fuel cell peers.
