Veeva: Analyst Negligence Has Gotten Obscene

"Pacific Crest said it is skeptical about reports that Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) lost a client to
Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) given they have a non-compete and Salesforce.com has
strong interest in the success of Veeva's platform."


This is comical!


From the SEC filed Veeva/SFDC re-seller agreement, material parts in bold.


1.1 Resale Rights. SFDC hereby grants to Reseller a nonexclusive, nontransferable
(except as set forth in Section 16.10), non-sublicenseable (except to Affiliates of Reseller)
right to market, demonstrate, resell and support OEM Services in connection with the
Reseller Application and as part of the Combined Solution, subject to all of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the following


Gross Competition. Neither SFDC nor its Affiliates shall position or promote any third-
party Force.com application that would be competitive to the Reseller Application as
provided in Section 3.1 or in a substantially similar manner; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not prohibit third parties (excluding SFDC Affiliates) from creating and
posting any content on SFDC's AppExchange or on their marketing materials without
SFDC's consent. Neither SFDC nor its Affiliates will designate any other company
with an ISV alliance status that is equal to or greater than "Preferred" or "Premiere"
for the Target Market. With the exception of equity investments in [*] (provided that such
exception shall not limit any of SFDC's or its Affiliates' obligations under the other
sentences of this Section 4), SFDC will not make an equity investment in or buy another
company for the purpose of developing or promoting a Force.com application offering that
would be directly competitive to the Reseller Application in the Target Market. In addition,
neither SFDC nor its Affiliates will develop or promote Target Market-specific software
applications to compete with the Reseller Application in the Target Market; provided,
however, the foregoing portion of this sentence shall not restrict an SFDC
Customer's ability (or SFDC's or its Affiliates' ability, if on behalf of a specific SFDC
Customer) to customize or configure the SFDC Service in any way.


Skeptical? Have you heard of Google or EDGAR?

What's amazing is this 'defense' is coming from an analyst whose firm underwrote the
IPO. He can't pickup the phone and confirm this information?


We can tell you with 100% certainty this is a loss (not that the 2000 or so seats was a big
focus for us). The timelines are also highly verifiable for anyone who wants to spend the
time doing the digging. We do not publish anything without extensively verifying it with
multiple sources. Roche global ex-North America has been in the process of deploying
SFDC since 2011(the presentation walking anyone who believes in FIELD RESEARCH
and DUE DILLIGENCE is publicly available online and linked to in our piece) . Genentech
was on Veeva/Salesforce and just recently ported over to a custom solution built on
force.com.


But just to show how ridiculous this note is. A fund that was long Veeva reached out to us
today and said they CONFIRMED THIS LOSS WITH VEEVA IR AFTER CONDUCTING
THEIR OWN DUE DILLIGENCE.


On a side note, this is just further confirmation of how much work some of these Veeva
sell-side analysts perform before disseminating investment advice.


Where oh where is the accountability........


Disclosure: I am short VEEV, . I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have
no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Wells Fargo suggests they were a project customer and had no 
impact to forecasted 2014. What say you?

Author’s reply »  Do your own due dilligence. They were their first big name customer. The seat impact is
immaterial though the fact that roche globally has 16k seats that went straight to sfdc(can you not click on a
link?) is a little more relevant from a tam standpoint. Add it up...that's roughly 5% of the seats globally if you
add what was lost in north america that are not available to veeva. Not like this was a core focus for us as we

again gave them the benefit of the doubt on getting 70% of the market in our original analysis. Our conclusion
now is there are going to be lawsuits here.....just wait and see....this is a total disaster ipo. Had they been fully
transparent we'd have never even looked, the underwriters made a mess of this.

"They were their first big name customer" , enough said. 
I thought they could have a position in the stock, but not sure. 
You know everything !

Well, well, well, I guess you were the needin' to do "more" due diligence. Hmmmmm...


16 Jan 2014, 08:03 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Umm, we are 100% right. They even issued an 8k confirming it. What more do you want?
We said 2k reps off the books between q2/q3. Are 2k reps a top 20 customer by revenue? No, of course not.


16 Jan 2014, 08:27 AM


MedTechBio, Contributor
Give it a rest. Your article you published hours before this one (clever move to start a new article) hooted
about the significance of the loss and impact going forward. Meanwhile, it $0 in the guidance from the
company. Nice try, though.


16 Jan 2014, 01:45 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
No, MedGuy, the article did not state the significance of the loss and stated that the revenue was "off the
books in Q2-Q3".  
On the contrary the article pointed out the significance of the client (important big pharma) and the fact that
this client went directly to CRM.

Quoting directly from your previous article: "What we discovered was a lot more interesting than the simple
fact that Veeva actually lost an existing top ten pharma CRM client." Now from the 8-K "At no time in the last
eight completed fiscal quarters was Genentech one of Veeva's top 20 customers, as measured by revenue in
the quarter. " Suhail...why can't you just apologize and man up and say you were wrong? It's ok, everyone
makes mistakes, you're obviously a smart guy. What's unforgivable is obstinance in the face of facts.


16 Jan 2014, 06:45 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Genentech/Roche is one of the top ten pharma.  
The size of the revenue loss was not considered large. 
Where is the problem ?


17 Jan 2014, 02:14 AM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Genentech/roche is #1 globally in biopharma for revenue, mkts cap, and r&d. They are also
the largest pharma by market cap if exclude JNJ which has a massive consumer packaged goods biz.


Convenient how you leave out the following sentence in parenthesis which clarifies the impact:


"We estimate the impact at no more than 2,000 seats for Genentech/Roche North America, and to the best of
our knowledge this revenue is off the books as of Q2/Q3."


2000 seats is less than 2% of their seats, and it ended july 31, 2013 which means off the books q2/q3 is also
100% accurate.


Again, as our entire article pointed out the seats lost are immaterial. It is who they lost them to and the fact
that it was their big name client and biggest cloud adopter in pharma that made the move.


On a side note, we love how none of you guys look at the roche presentation on line that we linked to. 16000
seats plus 2k or so USA adds up to 4-5% of the seats out there which veeva can't have now. How many big
deployments are still available? If you think pointing out that 18k seats globally are clearly unavalible for them
to sell into is immaterial to this stock at these levels there is really no point in us trying to persuade you
otherwise.

What I basically got from that long Roche presentation video (not totally easy to understand) is that Roche is
directly using saleforce developers for their projects, so they do not need VEEV. Many other pharma could do
the same as well bypassing VEEV.

Pacific Crest alone is negligible, but Jason Maynard at Well Fargo is also trying to stop the fall.  
Nevertheless I remain short of course.

AA: Great research and above reproach as usual. I really appreciate your diligence and thoroughness. This VEEV
underwriter and management b.s. is unfortunately reminding me SO much of the 1999-2000 Internet/Tech bubble.


So many people just never learn until it's too late...

Did you talk to VEEV and see how many new customers they are adding? Did you verify your story with WEEV?


15 Jan 2014, 02:56 PM


Suhail Capital, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Think about that question.......and then get back to us....you know how many times we tried dialing
into their cc?


Regardless, do your own work, its out there and 100% verifiable. Obviously crm user wise this is neglgible, but that
was not even part of our short thesis. We have defacto given them this market, its just that we know its a commodity
software market that is tiny. This news surprised even us because of who it is and how they ported off.

From Briefing after close and you may already knew. What's next?


4:26 pm Veeva Systems: In 8-K, company says that subscription agreement between VEEV & Genentech
expired during 2Q13; Already reflected in previously provided guidance (VEEV) : In an 8-K released after the
close, VEEV provides the following information: The subscription agreement between Veeva and Genentech,
for use of the Veeva CRM product by Genentech users in the United States, expired during VEEV's fiscal
second quarter, which ended July 31, 2013. The financial impact of the expiration of the Genentech
Agreement is reflected in Veeva's previously provided financial results and guidance. At no time in the last
eight completed fiscal quarters was Genentech one of Veeva's top 20 customers, as measured by revenue in
the quarter. VEEV does not believe the circumstances that led to the expiration of the Genentech Agreement
are indicative of any trend among its customer base generally and are specific to the relationship between
Genentech and Veeva.


Briefing Note: There was chatter out earlier today that VEEV had lost a major customer, driving the stock
lower. Pacific Crest later came out to defend the stock

involved in cracking down on out of control analysts...
