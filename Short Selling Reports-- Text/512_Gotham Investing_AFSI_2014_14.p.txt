Summary


Basic errors in KBW's price target calculation reveal a lack of diligence
and/or intellectual honesty
AFSI and/or KBW appear to be twisting words to fit their desired narrative

KBW analyst changed his tune on AFSI's Luxembourg accounting after my
initial article
KBW avoided the main point re: MHLD Discrepancies -- instead he argued
against points I did not even make!


Introduction


Until mid-October, the sell-side ratings for AmTrust Financial Services, Inc.
(NASDAQ:AFSI) had one outlier - a neutral rating from KBW. When the analyst
covering AFSI left, coverage was transferred to another KBW analyst who
made the ratings unanimous (buy).


Since then, KBW has been an eager and aggressive defender of AFSI.
However, in his eagerness, the new KBW analyst revealed a common
problem among AFSI bulls - shoddy analysis.


What follows is a breakdown of some of the many substantial factual and
logical errors of KBW's reports since coverage was transferred. Perhaps
if/when he attempts another rebuttal he will do more than parrot the company
line and do some research of his own.

Areas of Flawed Analysis from KBW (pretty much top-to-bottom):


1. Basic Math & Logic Errors in Price Target Calculation
2. NYDFS Conditions
3. Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives
4. Discrepancies between AFSI & Related Party Maiden Holdings, Ltd.


(NASDAQ:MHLD)


While the new KBW analyst has put forward several additional faulty
arguments , I will focus on these topics in the interest of brevity.


Analytical Flaw #1: Price Target Errors


AFSI is a complicated company, so I understand how an analyst might not
understand the Luxembourg accounting or fall for management's "reserves"
story related to life settlements. However, when one's sole job is analyzing
insurance companies, it's surprising that basic mathematical and logical errors
are made (adamantly no less) on such a significant scale.


Below is a re-creation of KBW's valuation methodology:


There are at least major flaws with KBW's approach - one simply from
bad math/accounting and the other from poor logic.


KBW either struggles with arithmetic or does not seem to understand the
concept of double-entry accounting because the amounts he has for earnings
and changes in book value are irreconcilable, as demonstrated by the table
below.


One need look no further than his projections for 3q14 (his note was published
before 3q14 was reported) to see a mind-numbingly large mistake - somehow
KBW expected AFSI's book value per share, excluding AOCI to increase by $4
more than net earnings and ignores dividends on common shares.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/29115375-gotham-investing/3536165-exposing-the-shoddy-analysis-of-afsis-staunchest-defender 3/9


While the errors in KBW's model are not as large in 4q14 - 4q15 as in 3q14,
the cumulative errors continue to add up and result in approximately $6.36
per share of book value in excess of what his own earnings projections imply.


Making matters worse, KBW compounds the mistake by applying 1.85x his
over-stated book value projection. Correcting for KBW's faulty model but
applying the same methodology otherwise would have reduced his price target
from $59.71 to approximately $48.


The second significant error KBW made was one of logic. KBW applied a 1.85x
multiple to the entire book value, even though he was placing an earnings
multiple on a portion of the business (Service & Fee Income). In doing so, he
yet again inflated his estimate of AFSI's value by over-stating the
book value attributable to AFSI's insurance operations.


According to management, AFSI's goodwill and intangibles are mostly
attributable to the Service & Fee businesses:


“ [The Service & Fee] acquisitions have generated the majority of theintangibles and goodwill that we currently carry on our balance sheet.
Source: 3q14 Earnings Call


So how big is this error?


To be conservative, I will assume that the "majority" to which AFSI's CFO was
referring is only 55% (only slightly greater than half) and that the Service &
Fee businesses have no other net assets. Again leaving the rest of KBW's
methodology the same, I estimate that the impact of this logical error was
approximately $9.76 per share.

Putting these two issues together shows that KBW's price target
would have been approximately $38.50 had he correctly applied the
methodology discussed in his report. Instead, through folly or otherwise,
Keith managed to arrive at a price target that was 56% higher than his own
argument would have suggested, if correctly applied.


Analytical Flaw #2: NYDFS Conditions


In addition to making a series of significant errors in his price target, KBW
seems to be gullible in spite of the facts. For example, AFSI is doing their best
to put on a happy face about the conditions NYDFS and AFSI "agreed" to in
conjunction with the ACP Re acquisition of TWGP. Are the Karfunkel
foundations going to mutually "agree" with the IRS to dump ~12 million
shares of AFSI stock as well?


KBW's report following my first article said it would be a mistake to assume
that each condition was initiated by the state and noted that "additions to its
actuarial resources was submitted to the State by AmTrust" which implies that
the other conditions were submitted to AmTrust by the State, including the
change in auditor that is all but certain to occur next year.

With respect to the value of renewal rights, which KBW argued should not be
backed out even though I was calculating an estimate of consolidated
statutory surplus, I would point out that the purchase of renewal rights is akin
to DAC which is not an admitted asset under SAP either. In addition, KBW
argues that goodwill and intangible assets associated with Service & Fee
businesses should be considered due to their contribution to AFSI's earnings
profile. However, what KBW ignored was that I only deducted a portion of the
goodwill and intangibles (removed all, then added back approximately half) -
thus rendering KBW's argument moot.


KBW also states that "a comparison of intercompany subsidiary capitalization
versus whole public companies fails to recognize the parent and lateral
subsidiary support available…". While I agree that group capital is important,
the U.S. regulatory framework is based on individual companies' capital
position. As such, group capital can be reviewed as a risk (as I believe it
should be in the case of AFSI and the US subsidiaries' reliance on the under-
capitalized AII), but it is by no means a substitute for adequate capital in each
subsidiary.


While KBW "confirmed with AmTrust that the capital stacking issue highlighted
in the short report totals $14 million", I confirmed the stacking with the
Company's org chart (see below).


By relying on AFSI itself to fess up to the problem of insufficient consolidated
statutory capital, KBW acted like the hen asking the fox if he was safe. As a
result, KBW missed yet another a critical point - the stacking occurs in
Bermuda (AII), not the US subsidiaries as the excerpt from Technology
Insurance Company's 2013 Schedule Y demonstrates:

In fact, AFSI acknowledged a portion of the stacking in its "Response to
Barron's" when it said (emphasis added):


“ AII owns Amtrust International Management, which owns 50% of AmtrustEquity Solutions, which owns Rochdale, AIUL as well as IGI - AII's total
indirect ownership of those three companies is $237 million.

Finally, I would challenge KBW (or anyone else for that matter) to
point to a similar instance of a regulator imposing numerous
conditions that are specifically targeted at reducing the leverage and
opacity of an insurance company and requiring a change of auditors
(or at least an RFP process that is likely to result in a change of
auditors).


Analytical Flaw #3: Luxembourg


KBW initially expressed comfort with AFSI's Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives
("LRCs") by stating "no matter how comfortable we are with AmTrust's
Luxembourg tax strategy…these risks will likely continue to weigh on the
valuation."


After my initial article ("AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The
Making - Part I"), KBW's tune changed: Luxembourg represents the greatest
area of ambiguity for us, in part because we, nor do we believe anyone outside
of AmTrust or its auditors and regulators, have access to the elimination
transactions required to verify AmTrust's accounting.


Yet again, KBW's lack of accounting knowledge fails him.


The key criticism I and others have is that the benefit AII receives is reflected
in its NET Loss & LAE incurred for its financial statements and in SEC filings.
However, the 10-K Net Loss & LAE fails to reflect the Net Loss & LAE incurred
by the wholly-owned LRC on the other side of the transaction with AII.


In other words, the net losses borne by LRCs appear to be excluded from
results reported in SEC filings, in defiance of U.S. GAAP. This does not require
access to AFSI's "elimination transactions" because NET Loss & LAE incurred
was used (if gross was used, eliminations would be necessary).


Analytical Flaw #4: Maiden Discrepancies


Interestingly, KBW seems to be have avoided the issue of a $292 million
difference (as of December 31, 2013) between AFSI's reinsurance recoverables
for unpaid losses ($1,034 million) and MHLD's Loss & LAE for unpaid losses
($796 million).

Instead, KBW argued against something that was not in my article - that
reinsurance recoverables could not be overstated because it would require
reserves to be over-stated, thus negating the argument. However, KBW's
supposed "insight" presupposes that AFSI's reinsurance recoverable is
proportionate to its gross reserve which is hardly a given in light of how


.


Further, KBW is silent on the possibility that MHLD could be substantially
under-reserved -- the most benign answer from the perspective of an AFSI
investor. Even this relatively benign outcome would severely harm AFSI
though because AFSI has substantial counterparty risk with an entity that has
less capital than thought. In addition to counterparty risk on a significant
portion of AFSI's assets, a reserve (and therefore capital) deficiency at MHLD
could force AFSI to slow down its premium growth since MHLD's capital would
not be able to support further increases in under-writing (and might not be
able to support its existing obligations).


As I said in my article, "AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The
Making - Part II", it is unclear whether estimates used by AFSI will be proven
correct or estimates used by MHLD will be correct, but one thing is clear:
either AFSI will receive less cash than its reported reinsurance
recoverables or MHLD will pay more cash than its reported Loss & LAE
reserves, and either case is problematic for AFSI (even if AFSI's
reinsurance recoverables were correct, they may be uncollectible due to
significant under-reserving at MHLD, of which AFSI's CEO is Chairman of the
board).


In addition, were AII (the AFSI subsidiary that directly faces MHLD) a US
subsidiary, such an outcome would not be possible in light of Part 2 - Property
and Casualty Interrogatories, question #10:


“ If the reporting entity has assumed risks from another entity, thereshould be charged on account of such reinsurance a reserve equal to that
which the original entity would have been required to charge had it
retained the risks. Has this been done?


numerically challenged AFSI's accounting department seems to be

Perhaps the NYDFS will push AFSI to bring its U.S. reserves back on shore as it
did with MetLife which would leave a hole in either AFSI's balance sheet or
MHLD's (or some combination).


Conclusion


I believe this article demonstrates clearly some of the misguided concepts and
calculations that AFSI bulls are propagating.


Rather than attacking critics of a company they cover in knee-jerk fashion,
sell-side analysts like KBW should consider doing a bit of research (i.e.: not
parrot the company without independently verifying facts and understanding
the concepts).


They might also want to make sure that the model on which they base their
price target is not so riddled with errors that their own methodology implies a
price target approximately 36% lower than their stated price target.


Because neither KBW nor any other sell-side cheerleader analyst has
been able to make a cogent argument against my bearish thesis on
AFSI, I reiterate my price target: $0 (insolvent).
