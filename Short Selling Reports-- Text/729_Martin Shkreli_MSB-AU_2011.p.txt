The Short Case for Mesoblast: Little Upside Left, No Need for a
Catalyst

by: Martin Shkreli


I've enjoyed shorting biotech stocks over the last 12 years. In the latter half of those years
the companies have generally been small. They have a strange tendency to crowd in the
$300 to $500 million range.


There were some memorable larger ones in the last 6 years: Telik (OTCQB:TELK),
Neurocrine (NASDAQ:NBIX), MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD), Human Genome (HGSI). I
missed a couple of big ones, too: Elan (NYSE:ELN), Sequenom (NASDAQ:SQNM),
Dendreon (NASDAQ:DNDN) were notable $1bn+ market cap shorts I failed to see (at
least I wasn't long!).


However, the very best shorts (on a risk/return basis) are usually smaller. This is notable
because as a hedge fund, you generally want size and liquidity in shorts. Many funds
simply won't even trade stocks if they're above a certain market cap or if there is limited
volume.


Mesoblast is a $2.5 billion biotech company that I think is worthless. With 95% downside
and limited upside, the short Mesoblast position is one of the largest in my hedge fund(s).
There is a catch, of sorts. Mesoblast is largely traded in Australia with the ticker MSB.
There are ADRs - OTCPK:MEOBF and MBLTY.PK - but they're not very liquid. MSB AU is
very liquid however, and I suggest you find a broker which allows you to trade in Australia
if you do not have one. All major international banks should allow it, and for the "home
gamer", Interactive Brokers may allow you to do so as well (not sure!).


This idea is part of a broader theme for me: International stocks are less well "arbitraged"
than United States stocks. In fact, my funds are largely focused on international stocks,
where many US hedge funds won't play. Retail investors should do the same. The internet
has allowed for us to do work on these companeis just as easily as we can in the United
States. Other than a perception of a barrier, a (sometimes) language barrier and a
(sometimes) time zone barrier, there are few reasons not to trade international stocks, and
a lot of reasons to!


Mesoblast largely has one product, "Revascor", which are mesenchymal precursor cells
used for Congestive Heart Failure. There is one trial that supports the valuation for
Mesoblast a 60-subject Phase II study that showed Revascor patients did a lot better than

control group patients. I will attempt to show that the results of this study cannot be relied
upon and the phase III study that will fully interrogate the ability for Revascor to do what
Mesoblast thinks it will do, will fail.


One of the salient results of the Phase II Revascor study was the mortality benefit seen at
6 months with Revascor. 4.4% of Revascor patients died at 6 months and 13.3% of
placebo of the patients died at 6 months. That sounds good at first blush but these results
are a bit abnormal.


Our team reviewed quite a few CHF studies and the 13.3% death rate for placebo at 6
months was very abnormal. The average mortality at 6 months in the studies we reviewed
was 4.17%. So, our meta-analysis shows two things: The Revascor arm had mortality that
was about normal, exactly what we see across many studies. The control group had a
very strange high death rate. In fact, it is the highest 6-month mortality rate for a CHF
study that we can find. It is not statistically reliable to compare outcomes across trials (the
aggregate patient population could be much sicker), but it was telling to see these
mortality levels are highly unusual if you assume the null hypothesis.


So why did one group do so much better than the other? In clinical trials, baseline
imbalances are a good predictor of outcome for patients, especially in CHF, where ejection
fraction, patient age, NYHA class all are reflective of patient disposition. The smaller the
trial, the more likely that the baseline characteristics of patients were imbalanced. The
more unblinded the trial, (this trial was single-blind), the more likely that investigator bias
creeps into the results. The more the control and intervention arms are different, the more
likely protocol bias skews the results. Yep, that happened here, too!


The mechanism of action of MSCs is highly dubious. It is widely acknowledged that these
cells do not differentiate, downstream, into other cell types. This is not how these cells
work. Even Mesoblast's investigators feel this way. So how do they work? They might
recruit revascularization factors to the site of injury. They might send important signals to
the real stem cells in the body. They might do nothing (this is my position).


Cephalon (NASDAQ:CEPH) licensed Revascor. This means the $2.5 billion value you are
paying when you buy a share of Mesoblast is not for 100% of Revascor, but for 50% (or
less) or Revascor. So this drug is worth $5 billion according to the market. There aren't
many Phase II drugs worth that much. I can only think of one or two that have had that
much value ascribed to them in biotech history. Given the specious nature of this asset, I
suspect there is little upside left to Mesoblast shares.

A lot of friends ask me why I'm short Mesoblast if there is no "catalyst" coming. In our
office, catalyst is a four-letter word. Timing catalysts is a funny subject. I ask folks we
interview when the best time to short a stock that you think is worthless is. Answers vary
from "the day before the news that proves it is worthless" to "short a little bit everyday" to
"wait for the top" and they get worse from there. None of those answers are too great. I
don't have the best answer, either.


In general, the job of a stock speculator/fund manager is to short stocks that are very
overvalued and buy stocks that are very undervalued. Timing is a tricky game, and I think
Mesoblast has "topped". We've been good at picking tops lately, but our display of that
skill might be fleeting.


Sizing is the more important element and it is independent of timing. Timing a trade
maximizes your IRR. Sizing a trade is a risk question. We can't maximize our IRR on
Mesoblast because we don't know when it will go down 95%. But we are reasonably sure
we won't get destroyed shorting it, so as long as the IRR is good (about +90% annualized
if it goes down that much in the next 12 months, +40% in 24 months, +260% in 6 months,
etc), it's worth doing now. That's a relatively mathematical answer. The best trade is the
one where you know it will go down and you know when. That is when you "go for the
jugular" as Soros says.


I think we know this will go down (and not up) but we don't know when. That's okay. In
general, shorts like this have a way of surprising you. A financial crisis here, a clinical hold
there, and you reach your price target sometimes for reasons you didn't think would occur.


Shorting overvalued stocks often comes with free synthetic puts -- the overvalued nature
of the stock allows for any negative surprise at all (even a commentary from Seeking
Alpha) to move the arbitrage closer to fair value. My old boss had a way of saying this I
particularly like: "expensive stocks go down, cheap stocks go up". It's a very "Tiger"
mantra, but it works if you're good at spotting the very cheapest and the very most
expensive stocks.


Happy trading!

I'm not sure where the author is getting his data from. According to Mesoblast's announcements none (0%) of the
Revascor patients died compared to 13.3% of the control. Where does the author get the 4.4% figure from?


18 Aug 2011, 11:42 PM 


gpeters2
After further research I've found the 4.4% figure. Both these deaths were classified as non-cardiac deaths so
therefore unrelated to CHF and revascor. I would have thought the author should have disclosed this. It's an easy way
of making a few dollars to short on a stock and then publish misleading material which drives down the price.

I believe that you are a bit overbearing on your criticism of biotechs. To say it is worthless appears to me that you
have an agenda not disclosed


19 Aug 2011, 02:23 PM 


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I think if there is any agenda it's to wake people up that these companies are not risk-free.
Most of these snake oil, pie in the sky companies end up worthless and I suspect Mesoblast is exactly that. I
don't fault the company and society for trying, but it doesn't mean we can't profit on the gullible.

Mesoblast actually have a massive pipeline - around 9 phase II trials either starting, running or concluding. Bone
marrow transplant phase III trial has recently been given FDA clearance to start.

Hey even a basic google search will tell you this is not true. Wikipedia wouldn't lie to me would they!?

MSCs don't differentiate. Mesoblast and their investigators will tell you this.

I've always enjoyed Martin's analysis he has some real interesting insights in biotechs.


But this time he's got his facts wrong, badly wrong I'm sorry.


The Mesoblast website clearly shows the cardio data is over average 18 months not 6. The literature I've seen is spot
on for the control group the control group results across the board are totally consistent what you'd expect from this
cohort.


The treated group over 18 months is highly significant better than the control and any thing in the literature. That is
pretty stunning for me.

As a physician (and investor), I would value knowing the author's background in stem cell biology or at least
molecular biology. At a minimum, readers would like to know if he is connected to a u t h e n t i c sources in basic
and/or clinical research institutes that are actually involved with this line of research?


On 9/5/11 (http://yhoo.it/nfFAL6;.v=1), Mesoblast rec'd European clearance for a phase-2 trial on (225) pts with acute
MI and stent procedures. Lead physicians in this multicenter study didn't sound like they were "shorting" the odds for
this study** and likely wouldn't embark on it if they did.


Also, Cephalon likely did an in depth product analysis before entering into a 50% partnership with Mesoblast.


Insight about bio-research by financial "gurus" can sometimes be helpful but, by its very nature, can only scratch the
surface. Odds making in this context unfortunately remains a crab shoot.


** "The preclinical data were very compelling, and formed the basis for this innovative clinical trial," said the study's
Principal Investigator, Professor Eric Duckers, M.D., Ph.D., Interventional Cardiologist, Head of Molecular Cardiology
& Associate Professor, Thoraxcenter, Erasmus University Hospital in The Netherlands.


"We are excited to be pioneering a novel and minimally invasive clinical approach that has the potential to greatly
improve the quality of life for patients suffering acute heart attacks," Professor Duckers added.


The UK's lead investigator, Dr Jonathan Hill, Consultant Interventional Cardiologist at King's College Hospital and
King's Health Partners Academic Health Sciences Centre, said: "This stem cell product has the potential to change
the medical paradigm for treatment of large heart attacks, and to provide for the first time a validated and effective off-
the-shelf therapy for routine use."

Martin, 
I'm not sure I would agree that it is settled regarding differentiation of MSC's. It seems the main perceived advantage
of MSC's as an allogeneic therapy is the lack of surface receptors promoting an immune response, however, the
potential to differentiate to a cell type that does not restrict this surface expression is where the potential danger
comes in from a non sourced donor. I believe that the investigators saying that MSC’s don’t differentiate might be
referring to a lack of differentiation as a proposed mechanism of action.  
Having said that, I largely agree with your analysis. Most peers in this category do seem to be in the $200-$500 MM
range albeit without the cash that MSBT has because of the Cephalon deal. People looking at MSBT need to look at
OSIR and understand some of the problems they have had with MSC’s albeit not MSC precursor cells. I would put
MSBT at NA plus this typical market based valuation. Still way below where it is today. A biotech in phase II trials with
a market cap of > $2 billion with rights assigned away to its largest and most near term application. This stock has

gotten way ahead of itself. Unfortunately even if the data pans out to be good, these guys have been a bit slow in
advancing their cardiac trials. If you discount for time and risk, this stock is a bit of a problem. 
Question though. It does seem that the success of this stock on the Australian exchange is being used to prop up and
almost promote the AUS exchange as a potential new biotech listing platform. I think this was even part of the
motivation for Reva Medical’s listing (RVA). Do you think this may help to artificially keep the stock up as this story
permeates the Asia Pacific Rim?

Excellent scientific analysis on the heart failure trial, I concur 200%. The "pipe-line" is based on 1 product which is
supposed to "cure" heart failure, bone fractures, macular degeneration, and neurological disease. Definitely appealing
to desperate patients with terminal conditions. Phase 3 trials will show this is a big charade. Unbelievable that Teva
fell for this, or it's a sophisticated insider deal. Definitely short stock.

First, I love your meta-analysis point. Really nice work there. It makes you wonder if this study has selection bias and
they just put the sickest patients into the placebo group. Patient selection methodology would be an area to focus on.


Another reason I love this selection is it is an excellent hedge on other Australian investments, which are subject to a
lot of currency risk if the Chinese economy slows dramatically. You could end up making 40% just on the currency
trade if Australian economic growth slows and the stock doesn't trade against some USD based hypothetical
valuation.


The only criticism here is that you don't discuss the details of the most important issues implied by your article, which
are:


1) How many Phase III studies will emerge here?


2) What is the timing on those studies (start and finish)?


3) When are we likely to get our first phase III results announced, since that appears to be the catalyst you are waiting
for.

Hey Martin, I've been reading your work, all the articles are top notch, I can see why you're a successful hedge fund
manager at < 30.


It still doesnt sit right to me that MSB can have no idea what their mechanism of action is. Their study found an
improvement with ejection fraction at low dose yetno functional improvement of patients. At high dose, they found no
ejection fraction improvement but had a functional gain, seems rather odd to me, but I guess we'll find out with the
phase 3.


Anyway I'm looking closely at sunshine heart. The base tech of counter pulsation seems to have been around for a
long time in the form of the intra aortic balloon pump but SSH's tech seems to be the only counter pulsation for
improved pumping in chronic conditions.


Personally I like that SSH addresses a niche in the CHF market that is currently poorly managed as they are too sick
for drugs but too healthy for LVADS. I also like that they have no blood contact with their device and that their
mechanism of action seems quite understandable.


Would love to hear your thoughts on that if you still read these comments...


Anyway keep up the good work, it's easy to come onto a public forum like this as a cheerleading, feel good bull. It
takes balls to come on here and be a full bear.


Keep up the good work. Not everyone on this site has made a dart board out of your face.
