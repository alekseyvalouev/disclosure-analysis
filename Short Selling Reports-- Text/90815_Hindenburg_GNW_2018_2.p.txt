Summary:  Genworth Financial (GNW)
In our previous piece we focused on signs of liquidity issues at China Oceanwide including


spiking debt levels, negative operating performance, and the aggressive pledging of


equity in its subsidiaries.


Today we share a deeper-dive into Oceanwide’s operations, including an overview of its


leverage-fueled trophy asset development spree which has shown recent signs of stalling.


We have also identi�ed accounting red �ags, including Oceanwide’s booking $11.4 billion


of “development costs” as a current asset, as well as $4.8 billion in questionable related-


party receivables.


Bloomberg recently reported that a key Oceanwide operating subsidiary was “scrambling


to sell assets to repay debt.” With another $1.6b of bond maturities due in Q1’19 we


expect signi�cant near-term instability and ultimately expect the conglomerate to unravel


within 24 months.


Given its liquidity issues we do not think China Oceanwide will ful�ll its commitments to


Genworth & its policyholders and reiterate our view that this deal looks starkly at odds


with the interests of policyholders.

Genworth’s Acquirer (China Oceanwide)
Looks to Be Drowning in an Ocean of Debt


Published on November 9, 2018

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In our previous piece (https://hindenburgresearch.com/genworth-we-see-almost-no-chance-of-


regulatory-approval-this-deal-would-be-a-disaster-for-policyholders/) we highlighted signs of


liquidity issues at Genworth’s emergent acquirer, China Oceanwide (“Oceanwide”). In particular


we focused on Oceanwide’s (i) consistently negative operating & investing cash �ow (ii) spiking


debt levels; and (iii) the aggressive pledging of equity in Oceanwide’s public subsidiaries, which


have all steadily declined in value.


Today we are sharing a deeper-dive into Oceanwide’s operations, including an overview of the


conglomerate’s leverage-fueled trophy asset development spree, which has recently shown


signs of stalling.


We have also taken a closer look at Oceanwide’s audited �nancials, identifying red �ags with its


working capital balances including (i) the reporting of $11.4 billion of “development costs” as a


current asset; and (ii) the reporting of $4.8 billion in questionable related-party receivables as a


current asset. Finally, we review Oceanwide’s debt maturities, with a particular focus on a large


$1.6 billion slate of bonds due in Q1 ’19, just after the hoped-for Genworth deal closing.


Collectively this analysis bolsters our view that Oceanwide is overleveraged and facing a severe


and current liquidity crunch. The nearly unlimited access to credit the conglomerate has


enjoyed historically has recently tightened.


If the Genworth deal were to close we believe it would buy Oceanwide some additional time,


but we do not see it materially altering Oceanwide’s collision course. We predict that China


Oceanwide will collapse within 24 months barring a �nancial miracle.


Background


The key question facing regulators right now is whether the Oceanwide deal will leave


Genworth’s policyholders better or worse o�.


The consensus seems to be that Genworth is a �nancially weak holding company. Many have


taken the view that if Oceanwide can contribute some cash to Genworth’s insurance carriers


then it would be better than nothing.


We think that view is misguided, and that the opaque Chinese conglomerate is not coming to


the rescue. On the contrary, given the �nancial state of Oceanwide we expect the opposite will


take place.

The current deal proposal (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2018/Genworth-and-Oceanwide-Extend-Merger-Agreement-


6db73a1f8/default.aspx) relies on Oceanwide largely contributing capital to Genworth after the


deal closes. Similarly, Genworth is slated to contribute (http://newsroom.genworth.com/2018-


10-26-Delaware-Department-of-Insurance-Schedules-Public-Hearing-on-China-Oceanwide-and-


Genworth-Financial-Merger-on-November-28-2018?mobile=No) capital to its primary insurance


carrier, GLIC, after the deal closes. We expect these IOU’s will never materialize. Instead, we


think Oceanwide is more likely to contribute a token amount up-front then seek any available


means of extracting capital out of Genworth in an e�ort to stay solvent while policyholders are


imperiled in the cross-border fallout.


Background: China Oceanwide’s Negative
Operating Performance Coupled With Spiking
Debt Levels Creates a Toxic Combination


As noted in our previous piece, Oceanwide’s operating performance has been consistently


negative with a recent sharp deterioration:

Working Capital Red Flag: Current Assets
Include Over �11.4 Billion of Real Estate
Development Costs


Given the lack of operating cash �ows and the rising debt levels, the key question becomes


“how long can we keep the lights on?”


For this we turn to Oceanwide’s working capital balances (i.e.: current assets minus current


liabilities). As of 2017 year-end the conglomerate had working capital of over $10 billion,


suggesting ample liquidity to meet its obligations, at �rst glance.


When taking a closer look however we notice that by far the largest current asset is inventory:

http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
By recording almost $13 billion in inventory as a “current” asset the implication is that the


balance can be converted into cash within a year or less.


This seems starkly at odds with reality. The entire conglomerate only generated $3.4 billion in


revenue as of the same 2017 year-end and has never generated more than ~$4 billion in


revenue in any year. Furthermore, we see that inventory has been steadily climbing every


single year, regardless of revenue growth or decline:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The audit footnotes (pg. 72 (http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF))


show that ~99.8% of the inventory is real estate related. But rather than consisting largely of


completed buildings, $11.4 billion (or 88.5% of the total inventory balance) is recorded as


“development costs”:


For context, Oceanwide’s total real estate revenue was only $1.2 billion in 2017 (pg. 82


(http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF)), suggesting that development


costs alone represent about 9.5 years worth of inventory:


The unusually large development cost balance raises multiple questions:


1. Why is Oceanwide carrying so many development costs as “current” assets? As noted


earlier, the balance has just grown over time regardless of sales movements. It seems


that for the past �ve years very little of its real estate projects have been sold or


converted into rental units, yet they continue to be carried as “current”.


2. Just how many properties are there that have yet to be completed, and what are they?


The above casts serious doubts about the credibility of “development costs” as a working


capital asset. It may also cast doubt on the credibility of the reported number in general. At the


very least, it raises questions about how Oceanwide is deploying its resources.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Note that if development costs were excluded from working capital the conglomerate would be


in a negative working capital position:


Negative working capital is a sign that a business could have trouble paying its existing debts


when due and payable.  In Oceanwide’s case, it has to pay these debts and then fund the $2.7


billion acquisition of Genworth along with its subsequent funding commitment to Genworth


and its insurance carriers.


Oh The Joys Of Leverage: China Oceanwide’s
Trophy Asset Development Spree


After identifying Oceanwide’s extensive development cost balances we sought to learn more


about its property endeavors. We learned through media reports and subsidiary �lings that the


conglomerate has been developing multiple large “trophy” assets.


Putting aside the wisdom of pursuing these splashy projects, the size and number of these


simultaneous developments tells us that substantial new capital will be needed to see them


through to completion.


The projects below (together with those in the following section) collectively account for only


about $2.6 billion in known deployed costs (pg. 14, pg 16


(https://oceanwide.hk/attachment/2018092116470100033273526_en.pdf) & pg 1


(https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/01/oceanwide-buys-tmg-�rst-

costs” could exist in other parts of the world. (Note that the China Oceanwide website


(http://en.chinaoceanwide.com/industry/index.html) lists some local developments but the


website appears to be outdated.)

Indonesian Power Plants (Completion Date Unknown)


In 2015, Oceanwide’s operating subsidiary acquired a project to develop a pair of power plants


in Indonesia (pg. 18 (https://oceanwide.hk/attachment/2018092116470100033273526_en.pdf)).


The projects were anticipated to be grid-connected by the end of 2017


(http://www.fhkg.com/index.php/Ch/En/Industrial/nyinfo/id/18). Development was delayed due


to litigation (which was subsequently resolved


(https://oceanwide.hk/attachment/2018020820020100003047470_en.pdf) in February of this


year.) To date, the company has invested $362 million into the projects. (pg. 18

In September, a Bloomberg article (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-


02/china-s-junk-bonds-riding-high-again-with-sales-spike-in-august) on Chinese junk bond sales


noted that the Oceanwide subsidiary responsible for many of the trophy-asset developments


was “scrambling to sell assets to repay debt.” The entity is the developer for the Los Angeles


and Indonesian endeavors mentioned above.


Additionally, the entity is responsible for the projects below, which appear to have stalled


without formal explanation:


A Planned 1,400 Foot New York City “Supertall” Looks To Have Super-Stalled


In 2015 Oceanwide paid $390 million to purchase two sites in New York’s South Street Seaport,


with plans to construct (https://ny.curbed.com/2016/3/18/11260710/�nancial-district-supertall-


1400-feet) a 1,400 foot “supertall” tower on the location.


The Real Deal reported that the company �led demolition plans for the sites in early 2017, but


as of April 2018 (https://therealdeal.com/2018/04/25/howard-hughes-eyes-600k-sf-of-air-rights-


at-south-street-seaport/) no building plans had been �led with the city’s Department of


Buildings. The publication referred to the situation as a “mystery”.


Luxury Resort In Hawaii’s Oahu


In 2015-2016 Oceanwide spent a total of about $614 million on land purchases in Hawaii (pg.


16-17 (https://oceanwide.hk/attachment/2018092116470100033273526_en.pdf))  in order to


build an ultra-luxurious hotel under the Atlantis brand along with two other hotels, residential


condos, and commercial space.


The projects look to have stalled. In mid-June of this year it was reported


(https://www.bizjournals.com/paci�c/news/2018/06/14/china-oceanside-still-in-design-phase-


for-west.html) that the projects are still in the “early design and planning process” with the sites


sitting idle.

Overall


Each of these construction projects have costs to complete that are not fully disclosed in the


�nancial statements and could amount to billions of dollars in additional �nancial


commitments.  So, Oceanwide will need funds to address its working capital needs (which


includes $11.4 billion in questionable “development costs”), its $2.7 billion Genworth


acquisition, and an unknown amount to fund these and other construction projects that are


currently in various stages of development and pre-development.


After all this, what is left for the Genworth policyholders?


Working Capital Red Flag: Current Assets
Include �4.8 Billion In Receivables Owed By
Related Parties


Turning back to the �nancials, we see other working capital red �ags aside from unusually large


inventory levels and apparently stalled development projects.


The second largest current asset item is $6.6 billion in “other receivables”:


Privacy  - Terms



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
This item struck us as odd because of its size relative to the operating performance of the


conglomerate (it’s almost twice as large as total 2017 revenue). Additionally, “other receivables”


ballooned by almost $1.1 billion from 2016 to 2017 despite a year over year revenue decline.


When looking closer at the footnotes we see that these other receivables are owed by a small


number of entities (pg. 71 (http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF)):


We see later in the �lings that the precise amounts owed by the top 4 redacted legal entities in


the above �gure 6.14.2 correspond to another footnote detailing receivables from related


parties (pgs 112-113 (http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF)):

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Thus we can surmise that at least $4.8 billion of “other receivables” is owed by related party


entities. Much of these were up-streamed to Chairman Lu’s other entities.


It is di�cult for us to imagine that these receivables have resulted from an exchange of goods


or services. In 2015, for example, the “other receivables” account grew by more than the


conglomerate’s total revenue:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Instead, it looks like “other receivables” is simply a mechanism to make unsecured loans to


Chairman Lu’s other entities.


In particular, almost $2.7 billion is owed by entities that look to essentially be the Chairman’s


holding companies. The conglomerate’s org chart (pg. 4


(http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3m0d01!.PDF)) shows that Tohigh Holdings is


the Chairman’s key holding company, while Oceanwide Group Co. Ltd owns stakes in


Oceanwide Energy and China Oceanwide:


This poses several important questions:


What is the credit worthiness of these receivables? If almost $2.7 billion is owed from


related entities with limited operations of their own what is their capacity to actually pay


the money back?


Why is Oceanwide functioning as a de facto bank for these entities? Do these related


entities lack the credit worthiness to get their own �nancing?


What are the terms of these receivables? Are these interest-bearing or are they simply


unsecured, interest-free loans to the Chairman’s entities?


Why have these receivables steadily grown over time rather than been paid o�?


To answer some of these questions we may wish to explore Chairman Lu’s personal spending


habits.


“Three Giant Mansions” and a Winery


Privacy  - Terms



http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3m0d01!.PDF

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Far be it for us to judge how a wealthy person spends their money, but Chairman Lu has largely


been spending borrowed cash. As the WSJ reported (https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-real-


estate-�rm-looks-westto-california-1422385081) in 2015:


Since 2012, Mr. Lu has purchased three giant mansions in Atherton (California),


paying $21 million, $25 million and $30 million, respectively… Collectively, the three


properties have 19 bedrooms and 22 bathrooms, according to property-sales


listings…


…last spring, Mr. Lu tried to buy an even pricier home, o�ering $41 million to buy the


former home of Jim Clark, co-founder of Netscape, according to court records and a


person familiar with the matter.


…(Oceanwide) also paid $41 million for a ranch in Sonoma County that can hold a


winery.


These are only the assets we were able to identify via domestic media outlets. It is unclear how


many mansions and other creature comforts Mr. Lu has accumulated globally at this point.


We wonder, why is the Chairman purchasing so many foreign mansions clustered in the same


California town? It begs the question of whether these are merely attempts to shift assets


overseas. At best it does not paint a portrait of a staid, judicious asset manager. Instead, such


spending is more reminiscent of the teenager who managed to get a hold of a parent’s credit


card.


Working Capital Item #3: Declining Cash
Balances And Restricted Cash


Moving right along, Oceanwide’s third largest current account asset after “development costs”


and related-party receivables is cash and equivalents. The balance has declined over the past


several years but stood at $4.6 billion as of end of 2017:

In the footnotes (pg. 62 (http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF)) we see


that about 26% of this balance, or $1.2 billion is restricted, largely due to pledges for loans,


bonds, and other deposits:


Thus, net of restricted cash the conglomerate had about $3.4 billion in unrestricted cash with


which to meet its obligations at the end of 2017. Given the trend of negative operating cash


�ow, a high current debt burden, and the aggressive development slate we can only guess


what the 2018 year-end cash balance will look like.

In S&P’s recent ratings release they noted that the entity’s capital structure was “unsustainable”

We expect Oceanwide to continue to face substantial re�nancing pressure, and


believe the prospect of meaningful deleveraging is still remote. This is due to the


company’s very high short-term debt and its overall huge debt burden.

After robust activity for more than two years, the momentum waned in September


and October, traditionally prime months for Chinese property.


…A downturn for such a cyclical sector has been widely anticipated, but the timing is


particularly bad since credit conditions aren’t conducive either.


…The �nancing landscape is the most unfavorable in years–whether it’s a clampdown


on alternative �nancing, domestic bonds being designated only for re�nancing, or a


surge in o�shore bond yields. Moreover, many developers have large re�nancing


needs due to surging maturities or exercisable puts on onshore bonds. Smaller


developers will certainly have to endure higher coupons. In some cases, depleted


investor demand will also make new issuances altogether unfeasible.


…Most rated developers are actually likely to increase market share by picking up


assets from more-stressed peers, while the weakest face a real possibility of


collapsing.


In case there is any doubt about whether Oceanwide is among the strong or the weak


developers, here is the 2-year price chart of Oceanwide Holdings relative to the 5 major


Chinese property developers (https://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-


china/article/2138821/�ve-hong-kong-listed-chinese-property-developers-see-big) (Oceanwide


is the one at the bottom with -44.23% performance over the period):


Following those �ndings, we reviewed the bond maturity schedule from parent China


Oceanwide’s 2017 audit (pg. 93 (http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3mkr01!.PDF)).


We learn two key takeaways from an analysis of this data set:


The conglomerate has relied on short-term debt to fuel its expansion. The duration of


Oceanwide’s $7.5 billion in bonds is only ~3.6 years.


The Genworth deal’s targeted closing (Q4 of this year) comes right before a slew of $1.6


billion in bonds come due in Q1 ’19.

In addition to the scheduled Q1 ’19 bond maturities, Oceanwide has recently rolled debt by


issuing new short-term obligations. The S&P release


(https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/2109124)


noted that Oceanwide repaid o�shore senior notes and domestic corporate bonds this year by


obtaining an RMB 11.6 billion (US$ 1.6 billion) one-year loan facility and by seeking support


from parent China Oceanwide.


The upcoming Q1 ’19 bond payments look to present a daunting hurdle given the


conglomerate’s recent struggles to juggle multiple debt repayments and other �nancial


commitments. The conglomerate faces about $3 billion in new bond maturities for ‘19, not


counting any additional debt rollovers or short-term liabilities that may have been pushed-o�


from this year.


Conclusion: This Ocean is �unning Dry


Oceanwide will need funds to support (i) its working capital balance (which includes at least


$16.2 billion in questionable “development costs” and related-party receivables); (ii) billions in


construction projects that are currently in various stages of development and pre-


development; (iii) its looming multi-billion bond payments; and (iv) the $2.7 billion proposed


Genworth acquisition. This is all in the face of negative historical operating cash �ow and


tightening credit markets.


After all this, will Oceanwide be able to make good on its promises to contribute $1.5 billion to


Genworth “over time following consummation of the merger”? In our view, that is the key


question underpinning this proposed transaction. We think the answer is a clear ‘no’.


We hope the regulators take the signs of �nancial distress at Oceanwide into consideration as


they weigh the decision for Genworth’s policyholders. We reiterate our view that this deal looks


to be starkly at odds with the best interests of policyholders.
