InterCloud Systems: Form D, Financial Storms Threaten This Non-
Cloud Company
May 29, 2015 1:04 PM ET13 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


ICLD recently filed Form D to sell $3 million in stock. With related-party loans
carrying up to 18% interest, other issues may signal the beginning of potentially
dilutive capital issues.


Excessive stock promotion allegations dog ICLD in the form of a class action lawsuit
and an SEC subpoena linked to a sweeping market manipulation probe.


Garnering little to no interest from institutional investors or analysts, ICLD tries to
justify its efforts by saying its stock would decline if not for promotions.


ICLD’s history of promotional issues is rivaled by its history of buying bad assets that
deliver losses.


ICLD has gloomed onto “the cloud”, but the filings reveal virtually no cloud-based
revenue.


InterCloud Systems (NASDAQ:ICLD) stock blew through low-hanging clouds on a recent
small contract award and today's announcement of an effort to improve clients'
experience.


But InterCloud is in such dire financial straits that top executives and directors just filed
notice for the sale of $3 million in stock.


And that is just the most recent of numerous stormy issues promising to dissipate
InterCloud's stock and leave stockholders drenched without an umbrella in sight.


Here are some bullish viewpoints for investors to consider. Meanwhile, below are the top
cloud-busters that make us hate this stock:


*Reality Check Number 1: New Form D Filing, Horrible Financials


InterCloud's CEO, President, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three
directors signed off this week on the newest stock offering of $3 million through Aegis
Capital. Disclosed under Form D, the first date of sale of the stock occurred May 14.

This may be just the beginning of such efforts for InterCloud. The company's net income
plummeted 200 percent last quarter versus a year ago. So net income dropped from $10.4
million to $-10.3 million.


Indeed, the company's income, EBITDA and other metrics fall well below competitors and
the industry as a whole, as shown here.


The company's history of incredibly bad earnings and earnings misses, sometimes over
1000 percent, is shown here and below:

*Reality Check Number 2: History Of Loan Defaults; Massive Maturing, Related-
Party Debt


The company has been trying to dig itself out of its financial mess by taking on debt.


But it has historically failed there, too. Investors may see that it has failed to meet loan
covenants and ultimately defaulted on a loan agreement, shown here.


Meanwhile, InterCloud has been forced to rely on loans from insiders. The CEO, a director
and other major shareholders have floated a total of ~$7.75 million in loans just since
December 2013. See the filing pages 112-114.


And this money was loaned to the company at rates as ridiculous as 18 percent interest.


Maturing related party debt is hitting InterCloud just about now, totaling over $20 million:

*Reality Check Number 3 - Stock Promotion Complaint


Desperate companies take desperate measures.

Alleged stock promotions by stock promotion firms DreamTeamGroup and MissionIR have
landed InterCloud and the CEO/Chairman in a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges
between Nov 5, 2013, and March 17, 2014, investors deceived by untrue statements of
material significance traded artificially inflated ICLD stock. The complaint is still pending.


Allegedly aggressive promotions apparently caught the SEC's attention, as investors can
see below.


*Reality Check Number 4 - Market Manipulation Question


The Securities and Exchange Commission issued InterCloud a subpoena in May 2014,
related to its investigation into market manipulation.


The investigation began with Galena Biopharma, which allegedly paid $50,000 to a
subsidiary of The Dream Team Group to promote its stock.


Galena stock promotional efforts by Dream Team and MissionIR - firms the class action
lawsuit says are associated with InterCloud - came to light through TheStreet.com and
Seeking Alpha.


The issue heated up when a Seeking Alpha author alleged the Dream Team tried to hire
him to write promotional articles about Galena and CytRX without disclosure, and alleged
Dream Team folks promoted the stock under multiple aliases, including a hedge fund
manager alias. Barron's nicely explains the mess here.


Page 31 of InterCloud's SEC filing suggests the company is just an innocent bystander
who's been asked for a witness statement.


But the investigation that previously specifically named Galena has now been renamed,
"In The Matter of Certain Stock Promotions." So it appears to be developing into a
sweeping probe that could ultimately engulf InterCloud.


*Reality Check Number 5: Promotion Continues Today


InterCloud seems undaunted by those problems and even tries to justify its promotions
this way:


We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no
securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the market price
for our common stock could decline.

Indeed, the company gets little to no interest from big institutional investors, shown here.
And just one analyst shows any interest at all.


The company's CEO followed the explanatory knee-slapper just weeks ago with this
comment suggesting some folks just never learn:


InterCloud's growing backlog and sales pipeline certainly seems to contradict our
stock's performance.


*Reality Check Number 6: History of Buying Non-Performers


Management's excessive promotional efforts are rivaled only by its history of buying bad
assets. Taken from InterCloud's SEC filings, the chart below summarizes the losses
resulting from 2014 acquisitions.


IPC RentVM VaultLogix


Acquisition Price $21.15 m $5.88 m $36.80 m


Revenue $22.85 m $0.11 m $2.52 m


Income/Loss $-6.53 m $-1.29 m $-0.86 m


(Source: SEC filings)


And underperforming acquisitions continue to weigh heavily on InterCloud's FY 2014.


A check of earlier acquisitions raised other question marks, including:


**The $15 million ADEX acquisition of 2012, for example, drove down revenue and cost
the company $3.8 million in impairment expenses in FY 2014, though one would expect
more efficiency since ADEX shares an office with ADEX Medical Staffing.


**InterCloud paid $4.5 million on Sep 18, 2012 for Telnet Solutions on Rand Road in Des
Plaines, Illinois. But Google map shows no building there.

*Reality Check Number 7: Riding "Cloud" Coattails, But No or Insignificant Cloud
Revenue


InterCloud has glommed onto "the cloud", but the filings reveal virtually no cloud-based
revenue.


The cloud got top billing in the telecommunications service providers April 8 shelf
registration statement registering $100 million-worth of stock goes on and on about its
"cloud-based service offerings."


But… InterCloud's filings disclose:


During 2012 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any revenue from cloud-
based services.


During 2013, we did not recognize any revenue from cloud-based services.


As of September 30, 2014, the amount of cloud-based revenue recognized on the
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations has not been significant
in relation to the company's other revenue within the cloud and managed services
segment.


Conclusion


InterCloud's filing this week is likely just the beginning of the probable dilutive capital
issues bearing down on shareholders. This cash-poor company is dogged by excessive
promotional allegations, lack of institution interest, consistently missed earnings, horrible
earnings, historically bad acquisitions, and lack of cloud revenue - all adding up to a
declining business.


The super-cell is building on InterCloud, lightning is striking and the tornado sirens are
screaming. Make a run for the storm shelter before this rain-wrapped stock falls to its pre-
promotional level of about $1.50.

This is an irresponsible blog by an admitted short seller. The disclosure that the writer is a short seller and will make
money if the price of ICLD drops is not seen until after the conclusion of the article. 
The form D filing related to certain debt secured by the company last week and disclosed in an 8k filing. There was no
new issuance of or sale of shares by officers and directors. 
References to factually incorrect writings of other short sellers does not give either this writer nor the prior writer any
additional credibility. This blatant manipulation of investor sentiment with false and misleading statements should not
be allowed to continue.

Also, of the $36M in backlog currently on the books, $10M - $12M of that is Cloud revenue. Inconvenient fact
not posted in this article.


That alone will provide 10% or more of Interclouds revenue this year.


29 May 2015, 02:55 PM

Please note, none of the loans carry an APR of 18%. Some are at 12% and quite a few have been reduced to
6%.

The Form D was filed and that stock transaction has already taken place.


Revenue has increased year over year and EPS has improved year over year.


Author has intentionally misstated facts and made fraudulent claims.

SA is full of crap. The author is short ICLD. ICLD recognized Cloud revenue this last quarter of $.5M and will have
more this quarter. In addition, the statistics are meaningless on the miss per EPS. EPS has to be taken in context of
earnings and revenues and the relation of the miss per such.


In addition, the EPS has shown that the company had reduced the loss by the company by 50% over the last year.


Author is short ICLD>


29 May 2015, 02:34 PM


Iruleyoulose
The author also did not state that Cloud revenue was starting to be recognized at the end of FY2014 for
approximately $200K, rose to $500K in the first quarter this year and will continue to rise. This revenue is a high profit
margin at 90% Gross Margin in profit.


The fact SA states that its editors don't have a position on a stock, when the author has short position, proves once
again that SA has no credibility.


Also, I would take it as a vote of confidence if the CEO is using their own funds as debt to the company. If the
company goes under, they would get very little back.

Rebuttal


Two of Five Summary Bullets:


Two of the Five Summary Bullets are About Promotional Problems...Give Me A Break...The one case from almost two
years ago will be dismissed...Period...N... has came of it and there is no evidence of a illegal paid stock promotion
manipulation...This stock has been trading for years with growths year over year and the have a stellar management
team and the court will dismiss this little case from a few shareholders that are crybabies about the stock taking a dive
from probably co-ordinated shorters like yourself...Cry me a River...


3rd Bullet Point: 
Issuing 3 Million in Stock to Raise Money...Happens Every Day With Growing Companies...What is so Damning about
that? Seriously????


4th Bullet Point: 
Buying Assets that Don't Make Money...Are you serious again??? People purchase companies with future values
added into them. ICLD bought these companies just over the past couple of years. Of course their not going to make
all the money back that they purchased them from in 2 years...What Planet do you live on man?


5th Bullet Point: No Cloud Revenue...BS...Take this from 1Q 2015 Conference Call... 
Amitabh Passi - UBS 
I am sorry. Then I just had a quick follow-up for Tim. Tim, you disclosed a backlog of $36 million. Are you able to give
us any visibility, how much of the backlog pertains to your cloud revenue stream, just because that is your highest
margin segment? It will be interesting to see how much of the backlog is specifically tied to cloud? I don't know if you
are able to share that metric?


Tim Larkin - CFO 
Out of that $36 million, approximately $10 million to $12 million was attributed to cloud.


So Much For Your Facts Bud...

ICLD is a pos. Management is a joke, trust me I've met them. They are sleazy and so is the company's funding. If you
dig deeper they are funded by head of investment banking at Aegis Capital under a shell name that works with Magna
which is known for their death spirals. No real institution will touch this. The SEC investigation will destroy this
company. I no longer have a position in the company. I did short when it was at $12 and covered at $4.

their data backup business for over $26M representing just 11% of revenue. Consider the market cap if under $18M.
This has to lead to a conclusion the company is wayyyyyyyyy over sold.


Anyway... as soon as I turned green I dumped 40% of it, and now will wait for Friday 18th when their earnings report
should come out. I am expecting to be decent, but you never know with this one. It could jump .50 or dive .25.

Or dive to .04, if someone still has insight on this, I'd like to know more of what's going on...
