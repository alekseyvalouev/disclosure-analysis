Valeant Pharmaceuticals: some comments
Mike Pearson - the CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals - released a letter in response to recent stock
price falls. You can find the letter in an SEC filed 8-K. The letter was released before yesterdays 16.5
percent fall. 
 
In the letter they state that [Valeant] "expect the Salix business to represent approximately 20% of our
2016 revenue and expect double-digit script growth and corresponding revenue growth trends to
continue". 
 
This surprised me. Valeant sales are over $10 billion per annum. They were 2.695 billion in the last
quarter (including sales from Salix). 
 
If organic sales growth is 20 percent and the sales grow double-digit then Salix sales should be at
least $2.2 billion during 2016. 
 
During the last year Salix was a public company (2014) Salix revenues were $1.13 billion. 
 
I guess they can square this circle with massive price increases for Salix products. However in the
same letter Mike Pearson denies that Valeant's growth is dependent on price increases for
pharmaceuticals. 
 
Mr Mike Pearson, I do not believe you. 
 
What would make Mr Pearson more plausible? 
 
There are numerous instances where I have found myself disbelieving Valeant's numbers and PR
spin. If you want a really good analysis read AZ Value's wonderful blog. However I keep coming down
to people and their personal credibility. You catch way too many strange, even implausible numbers at
Valeant. 
 
And there are reasons to distrust the people more generally. 
 
It would be better if the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee of the board did not have close
association with past securities frauds. Let me introduce you to Norma Provencio. 
 
Ms Provencio is founder of Provencio Advisory Services, a healthcare consultancy.  Ms Provencio
has been involved with Valeant for some time. She was on the board of legacy Valeant and signed the
original offer letter to Mike Pearson in 2008. 
 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/930184/000095013708001675/a37735exv10w1.htm 
 
Searching the SEC database for "Provencio Advisory Services" not in reference to Valeant turns up a
relationship with Signalife (aka Heart Tronics) back in 2007: 
 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/810365/000081036508000002/sgnsb2foryaglobalsedav5final
.htm (p. 19) 
 
And if we go way back, it turns out she participated in the same financing for a predecessor company
to Signalife, Recom Managed Services, as an attorney named Mitchell Stein in 2003: 
 
http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/810365/000114420404007314/v03550_10ksba.htm 
 
"On May 15, 2003, we completed the first tranche of a private placement pursuant to which we sold
82,667 units to Mr. Mitchell Stein, SJ Investments and Ms. Norma Provencio at $3 per unit for cash
amounting to $248,000. Each unit consisted of one common share and one warrant. Each warrant is
exercisable at $3 until May 14, 2004. Upon exercise of the warrants each investor will receive one
common share and an additional warrant to purchase one common share $6 per share until

November 15, 2004." 
 
Ms Provencio was a director of Signalife (aka Heart Tronics), which is not mentioned in her official
Valeant biography.  This is a worrisome omission. 
 
Mitchell Stein, the controlling shareholder and Provencio's co-investor got into a bit of trouble and is
now serving a lengthy prison sentence. 
 
http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-convicted-multimillion-dollar-stock-fraud 
 
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/vns/caseup/steinm.html 
 
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2011/lr22204.htm 
 
Here's a mention (including an email from Provencio) in a filing by the defendant Mitchell Stein in his
sentencing hearing, claiming that she knew about the transactions at issue: 
 
http://www.freemitchellstein.com/MTC.pdf 
 
Ms Provencio wasn't charged, but she was involved since the early days of the company, coming in
alongside its principal mastermind and serving as a Director, Audit Chair, and consultant.  
 
This seems like a meaningful omission from her biography and raises questions about her suitability
as audit chair for a company as complex and acquisitive as Valeant. 
 
We do not have any affidavits Ms Provencio made in her defence in the Signalife matters - though we
have affidavits from other board members who ran the defence that Mr Stein controlled all aspects of
Signalife and hence they (as directors) were not responsible. [Kindly this is the "asleep at the wheel"
defence.] 
 
Ms Provencio was also in the board of International Aluminum Corp, which went bankrupt at some
point back in the mid-2000s (and is not mentioned either). 
 
Approach to relevant Congressional staffers 
 
There is discussion in the news about Valeant possibly receiving subpoenas concerning drug price
hikes. 
 
If the congressional staffers concerned want more material on Valeant which helps them target their
subpoenas then I can offer some low-level assistance.

You can use Sentieo / AlphaSense / DisclosureNet to quickly search SEC filings... I think
you'll find those tools extremely, extremely useful for your short selling if you aren't using
them already.

Salix was heavily discounting its products because of the inventory scandal. Xifaxan has
been approved for the IBS-D indication and is growing very fast. You don't seem to be
taking this into account.

Buboe said...


If organic sales growth is 20 percent and the sales grow double-digit then Salix sales
should be at least $2.2 billion during 2016. 
 
john, 
I think you mean " if Salix sales are 20%".

It's funny how you seem to point this out on Valeant yet you own Herbalife who has a
board member, Pedro Cardoso, who is wanted for embezzlement in Brazil. Strange

Buy-side manager said...


Agree with anon above about clearing the channel inventory last year so all clear for sell
through this year. Xifaxan got approved for a new indication which will significantly lift
sales in the next year to come. Salix sales will more than double this year, could do over
$2.5 Billion.  
 
No position.

To me, Valeant is essentially a rollup. Hence, there is always a need to buy larger and
larger companies until: the firm is sold at (hopefully an inflated price) or cannot find any
more acquisitions to make. In the latter case, the comapny has grow much more slowly
on its own and see its multiples decline. Valeant has had a great run, as other successful
rollups have enjoyed until they hit a wall. That could be what we are now seeing with
Valenat. 
 
For the record, I have no position in Valeant, although I do own shares in Sequoia, whose
value has been significantly enhanced by the Valeant stock price increase over the years.
I never understood what the PMs at Sequoia really saw in the company, but I could not
argue with success, until now.

Provencio's also been a director at Beazer Homes (BZH) since Nov. 2009 and is now
chair of the audit committee there. This was after the fraud at BZH which the SEC alleges
occurred in 2006 & first 2 quarters of 2007. https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-
146.htm 
But, a curious choice for BZH considering her prior association w/ Signalife and BZH's
past history of fraud.

You comments on Salix are likely wrong. Salix has its own story. Salix markets a
blockbuster druge Xifaxan (rifaximin). Sometime in later 2014, the analyst started
prodding the company on channel inventory. Company didn't have IMS data and CFO
messed up and said that they think its likely 2-3 months. Subsequently, company
investigated and found that channel inventory was more like 9 months. CFO was fired,
share price fell and company after investigation agreed to aggressively destock to 3
months, which meant that 2015 sales were going to be very low anyways. In mid-2015,
the Xifaxan was also FDA approved for another indication - IBS (Irritable Bowel
Syndrome). Salix was an amazing buy and a steal. Their sales force is top notch.
Anyway, I am late to Valeant drama and your blogs are getting longer and longer so
difficult to follow. I was scrolling through and saw something about Salix so thought I will
point it out. I stopped following Salix after acquisition so am not sure about price increase.
