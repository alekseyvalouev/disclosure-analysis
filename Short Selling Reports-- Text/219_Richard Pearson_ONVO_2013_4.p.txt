Organovo Files To Sell 4 Million Shares Via JMP Securities
Nov. 29, 2013 9:30 AM ET112 comments
by: Richard Pearson


On Wednesday, November 27th at around 5 pm, Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO)
filed an 8K with the SEC announcing that it had "entered into an Equity Distribution
Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") with JMP Securities LLC (the "Sales Agent").
Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company may offer and sell up to 4,000,000
shares of its common stock (the "Shares"), from time to time through the Sales Agent." As
noted, the Shares sold in the offering will be issued pursuant to the Company's effective
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-189995).


It should not be surprising that many investors missed this filing, given that it was released
well after the close of markets on the night before Thanksgiving. Investors had obviously
turned off their screens and begun to prepare to celebrate. In fact, it should have clearly
been downright expected that releasing a filing at this time would go largely unnoticed by
almost all investors.


This continues several patterns for Organovo. First, we can see that Organovo has
consistently released similar filings at times when investors should be expected to not see
them. In October, CEO Keith Murphy sold 100,000 shares of Organovo. The filing came
on Friday, October 18th after markets were closed, such that most investors could be
expected to have already logged off. Next, Organovo filed an S8 registration statement on
November 8th. Again, this happened to be a Friday, and it happened to come out after the
markets were closed and when investors would not be looking. As per the S8 filing,


An aggregate of 11,553,986 shares of common stock may be offered or issued
pursuant to the Organovo Holdings, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"),
6,553,986 of which were previously registered on Form S-8 (File No. 333-181324),
and 5,000,000 of which are registered on this Form S-8.


Shortly thereafter, Mr. Murphy again sold an additional 100,000 shares. Again it was filed
with the SEC on a Friday, November 15th. And again it was after markets were closed on
that Friday. At the same time (also after markets were closed), Chief Strategy officer Eric
David filed to disclose his sale of 16,470 shares which had occurred several days earlier.
This follows after his sale of 63,000 shares in October.

Following this most recent filing on the night before Thanksgiving (and preceding a half
day on the following Friday), most investors should feel that the pattern of stealthily
revealing this type of filing has now been established.


Second, we can see that Organovo has been exceptionally eager to prepare itself for the
ability to sell as much stock as possible, despite the apparent limited need for cash.


Back in July, I first noted my concerns about the likelihood of an Organovo equity offering
along with the potential for such an offering to be priced at below $5.00. Many investors
scoffed at the idea. The company already had $13 million in cash vs. an operating cash
burn rate of $2.7 million per quarter. As a result, many investors concluded that a raise
was not necessary. In addition, prior to my first article, the stock had risen as high as
$8.50. When the stock fell to around $5.00 after my article, many investors assumed that
Organovo would be unlikely to issue more stock at such a "low" price.


Instead, Organovo issued $43.3 million of stock on August 7th at a price of just $4.50.
Investors should take note that Organovo issued this stock just one day after the S3
became effective, despite a falling share price and despite the $13 million on its balance
sheet.


The recent insider sales of almost $3 million should come as no surprise to most
observers. The share price recently doubled on the back of a series of articles, despite no
major developments from the company. The only "news" had been the release of the 10-Q
(which disclosed just $23,000 in revenue), along with a business update which included
such things as a 2-month-old financing and the mundane change of their transfer agent.
The company did disclose in October that "the company presented data demonstrating
retention of key liver functions in bioprinted tissues for up to 40 days, longer than one
month." However this does not identifiably change any of the timing or size of any revenue
prospects, such that it should certainly not have impacted the share price.


As the insiders sold this $3 million in stock, they were then quick to file the subsequent S8
registration statement. The existing S8 already allowed insiders to issue themselves over
6 million shares (valued at nearly $60 million), but management felt the need to increase
this even further to 11 million shares, just as the share price spiked. These 11 million
shares now accounts for nearly 13% of the outstanding shares in Organovo, which
management can now simply award to themselves.


Prior to Wednesday, Organovo already had $53 million in cash on its balance sheet,
leading many investors to believe (once again) that there were minimal prospects for
future dilution. Instead, Organovo was quick to file for this additional 4 million shares

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1868351-organovo-files-to-sell-4-million-shares-via-jmp-securities 3/30


valued at around $36 million. Given the current share price, which values the company at
$700-800 million in market cap, it is hard to blame them. At the beginning of 2013, just 11
months ago, the entire company was valued at around $150 million.


In the entire time since it has been a public company, Organovo has only realized around
$2 million in revenues. But insiders have personally realized around $3 million from selling
their shares.


Even the most bullish forecasts of management now only call for "tens of millions" from
product sales. And again, this is just the hope, and Organovo still has no products on the
market as of now. These latest clarifications from management have helped to clear up
any possible confusion that Organovo might be set to actually pull in hundreds of millions
in revenues from big pharma companies. It was those misconceptions of tremendous
revenue potential that had propelled the share price up from $5.xx to almost $14.00 in
recent weeks.


But against that "tens of millions" in hoped for sales, this latest filing allows that
Organovo's total stock issuance can be around $100 million just since coming public last
year. We can see that by far the largest source of cash flow for Organovo should be
expected to be simply selling its shares to investors and not its actual products to pharma
companies.


When Organovo first raised money in 2012, it was happy to issue 16 million shares at a
price of just $1.00. CEO Keith Murphy owns nearly 7 million shares. The value of those
shares has risen from just around $7 million to over $60 million, despite the fact that
Organovo still has no product and no material commercial revenues. When the share
price hit $13.65 last week, his shares were worth around $90 million.


And again, this hoped for "tens of millions" in revenues should also be compared to the
roughly $100 million in shares that management can now simply hand themselves under
the S8 registration statement. These shares are in addition to the 4 million that Organovo
filed this week.


Given the excessive enrichment potential involved here, paired with the complete absence
of any concrete revenue potential, it is not surprising that management would be eager to
bury these filings by filing them at times when no one is looking.


This most recent prospectus covering the 4 million shares was clearly prepared after the
close of business on Tuesday, November 26th - NOT on Wednesday, November 27th.
This can be noted from several places in the prospectus that refer to things such as:

The last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE MKT on November
26, 2013 was $9.55 per share.


This information could have easily been released on Tuesday or even during the day on
Wednesday when investors would have actually seen it.


But the filing was not released on that Tuesday when it was already finalized. Instead it
was released a day later on Wednesday, November 27th, after markets were well closed
on the night before Thanksgiving, when it was virtually guaranteed that almost no one
would even see it. On Wednesday, when the filing was made with the SEC, the stock had
already closed at $9.18, not $9.55 (where it had closed the previous day, Tuesday).


Organovo is a company which is held 7% by institutional investors. Institutions are simply
not interested now, just as they were not interested earlier this year when the stock price
was at $2.00.


Unfortunately, retail investors are much less likely to read SEC filings than are institutional
investors. Beyond not even reading these filings, they are certainly less likely to receive
real time SEC updates the way that professional investors do. I strongly encourage all
investors to sign up for an SEC filing service such as EDGAR or secinfo.com and to also
sign up for real time SEC filing alerts.


Organovo last issued a large amount of stock at just $4.50. The latest round of filings
indicates that management is eager to issue millions of additional shares to themselves as
well as for the company itself to raise more money. But signing up for automatic updates,
investors will not miss these developments, even if they continue to be filed at times when
no one is looking.


Disclosure: I am short ONVO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

If this author is referring to the timing of this news as being suspect or "shady" - because the release of the
information is when the least amount of people will notice it, because of the holiday season - then wouldn't we
be upset if then a S.A author practiced the same tactics as well?


Can this than be like a S.Alpha author penning a lengthy S.A. article on a Chinese stock he is short - right
before a lengthy one week Chinese holiday?


Fully knowing the company cannot respond.


And how do we know this, because in his profile it says that the S.A. author is an activist investor who spends
half his time in China and half his time in the U.S? Thus, the author gets the most bang for his buck knowing
he can do the most damage to the PPS of the stock right before their holiday? Hmm, rather than waiting, say
after the Chinese holiday? I guess the timing of the article then would be a little 'suspect' - to say the least.


Yes, the SA author is no other than the author of this article. You can look up his profile, timing of his articles
and figure out the Chinese stock and the holiday schedule yourself.


ONVO is only doing what THIS AUTHOR has done before in the past. It is called 'timing' and good business,
but someone doesn't like it when it is done against his position in a stock though. Otherwise - it is all good
business or 'business as usual'.


Oh - one last thing this author forgot to mention - the 100,000 shares that were sold was only part of the
6,000,000 million shares Mr. Murphy owns. I guess that shouldn't be considered, well, as 'suspect' writing on
the authors part or important information left out. No, not at all.

If you're going to invest in an SA writer - not sure how you'd do that - then yes their good or bad ethics would
be something you'd want to consider. But you're not. You're investing in a publicly traded company that is

subject to rules and laws and general codes of good practices. If that company is manipulating the rules to
the extent of what they can legally get away with that is something definitely worth noting.


For example a company is not allowed to simply hide insider sales or the fact that they're going to dilute the
stock some more but they are within narrow parameters allowed to decide when to notify the public. If they
consistently take advantage of the rules to do this when shareholders are least likely to be looking then you
know that they're trying to hide something. Ideally you want the company you invest in to be transparent
because if they hide one thing they're likely to hide other things you'd want to know too.


But the timing of the release is less important than the fact that for no good reason other than trying to cash in
on the current inflated stock price ONVO is selling more shares to the public for cash they do not need.


If ONVO is so confident of their business prospects let them wait a few years until they actually need more
money to do another raise. They still have enough cash to last them at least three years. Logically by then the
stock price ought to be higher. The fact that they're not waiting another second tells you that they know better.


Stock picking is about ferreting out clues from a market that does not reveal everything all at once. By the
time the news is printed in bright neon letters that train will have long ago left the station. And this company is
not acting at all like a normal biotech would.

My goodness, the way you write Mukticat - I would almost assume you are Richard himself. Anyway, the
faulty logic that you both pump seems to be the same.


But if the most you two have to complain about is when a company releases information - say a Wednesday
or a Friday instead of a Monday or Tuesday - as the basis of an entire SA article - then I am sorry - it reeks of
desperation or at least a short attack on its last leg I guess.


Hmm, must be time to get out of shorting ONVO. Especially since the company actually speaks in conference
this week. (One last article to suppress the PPS for shorts - to squeeze what they can out of it the depressed
share price. Not a bad strategy, after all the CEO of ONVO will be speaking this week and in case the PPS
shoots back up, might as well put out one last complaint about - of course, what else, the release date of
information.)


You know, why don't you and Richard leave your phone number with ONVO so that they can check with you
guys to make sure that the release date suits you better. Just let them know if you prefer Monday or Tuesdays
- that way we can at least save an 'article release' complaining about the timing of information release from
SA.


Oh, and in case ONVO feels it is necessary to raise cash, like other companies do - and you don't like that -
please let them know you are willing to work for free for them as well. After all, you and Richard being such
great CEO's and everything, you obviously know how all this works without a company offering shares.
Especially those in the beginning of a business cycle.


Oh, and let all the other real CEO's know as well. Maybe even publish an article telling ALL CEO's not to do
anymore share offering on Wall Street. None and forever. . . Ever. . . And forever.

"The latest round of filings indicates that management is eager to issue millions of additional shares to themselves"


Shouldn't this be a good sign? An indication that something big is afoot that staff should position themselves to benefit
from?


29 Nov 2013, 09:47 AM


Sally G
Not with the company history reported here; it seems clear to this amateur that management is making
money off artificial rises in stock price, as their actual sales are minimal. I would stay away from this one. It
seems to me as though you are looking for more insider integrity and market rationality than I see from what I
read here. I hope you are right, though!


29 Nov 2013, 10:23 AM


dastickup
Shouldn't good signs be things like actual decent sales revenue? Issuing shares like there's no tomorrow is
questionable and not necessarily in the best interest of shareholders. Particularly with continued insider sell-
offs.

It's called development stage.

Yeah, that is what bothered me, but in early development, I can cut some slack for executives who are finally
seeing money if they have been paid by stock, not cash, while a company is getting off the ground. I con't
know enough about this company to know if that is the case here.

How's that short been working out for you recently?


So it seems like they sold 10 million shares in August, but now they have this shelf registration for only 4 million
shares. Seems like it would be good financial planning for a company to have flexibility to sell a few shares if the price
went up...


29 Nov 2013, 10:23 AM


Mukticat
It seems to me that the answer to your 'how's the short working out recently' is 'very very well'. This stock's
already dropped from 13.50 to a current 8.50.


40% in eight days isn't bad you know.


29 Nov 2013, 11:24 AM


abisharma
Funny, Mukticat, you seem to only comment on articles or companies that Pearson shorts. At least your
profile comments points to this. I guess I should jump on board as well. Like you said, 40% in eight days is all
that matters.


01 Dec 2013, 03:38 PM


Mukticat
If you would bother researching Pearson's record you would follow him too. His recent picks have been
stellar. But you'd have to remove the blinders first.


And '40% in eight days' is not all that matters. 50 or 60% in seven days matters even more.

When it comes to Organova and Pearson remember he tries to make it look as bad as possible. So Keith Murphy sold
100,000 shares, big deal, who cares. Pearson didn't mention that he owns over 6,000,000 shares. If I wanted some
spending money or possibly invest in something else I would sell 1.6% of my shares. Maybe he wanted to buy a
home or buy a home for his mother. Pearson turns everything to the negative. So it was Wednesday, OH my gosh
they are trying to hide something ! What difference does it matter if I see the 8k Wednesday evening or this morning ?
It makes no difference at all. Pearson brings up what their income has been, no news there, Pearson we KNOW what
the prospects are. And only individuals are into buying shares not so. Sounds like Obama saying you can keep your
insurance. That is absolutely not true. Two major investment firms each have over a million shares. I don't give much
value to anything he says.


29 Nov 2013, 10:26 AM


Sally G
O.K., good points. Maybe there is more here than presented in this article; I hope that I was reading too much
negative in based on a single source; this is not a stock I hold—not even sure why I clicked on the article.
Thanks for the balance!


29 Nov 2013, 10:28 AM


Mukticat
Those two major investment firms are index funds that buy a broad spectrum of stocks in an attempt to match
the indices. They don't care if they're good or bad companies.


29 Nov 2013, 11:25 AM


Sally G
But they would have a choice of similar firms, no? Wouldn't they look for the best, or one of the best, in each
area?


30 Nov 2013, 10:35 AM


Mukticat
No, they just choose a sampling of stocks trying to replicate the breadth and capitalization of the broad
indexes. It's not a judgment on the relative value of any particular company that goes into it.

I'm long in ONVO. ONVO issued the SEC filling on the 27th after-market hours. I'm glad they didn't issue it during
market hours as it gives time to the investors to properly read and interpret the documentation. 
If you were the CEO of this company, wouldn't you do the same?


At the same way I noticed that you as ''short'' investor are very timely on writing articles when ONVO is easier to be
attacked which on my opinion makes your articles rather un-reliable.


In the SEC filing is stated that the 4 millions of shares are for investing in developing a new stream of ‘’surgically
implanted bio-printed tissues’’ products and potential acquisitions, which on my opinion is a very good news.


Below, I’m pasting an extract from the SEC:


“The Company intends to use the proceeds raised through any “at the market” sales for general corporate purposes,
such as the initiation of research and development programs in new tissue areas, the execution of preclinical or
clinical studies to advance its understanding of surgically implanted bioprinted tissues, the development and
commercialization of its products and the potential acquisition of complementary businesses, products or
technologies. Because its bioprinting technology platform technology can be used in many new areas, the Company
believes that additional investments in new efforts offers the potential to increase long-term stockholder value”


Feel free to correct me if I’m misunderstanding the SEC filling.


29 Nov 2013, 10:35 AM


Sally G
I cannot comment on the SEC section, but note that Warren Buffett also releases information famously
releases information on Friday afternoons and does not share early with analysts, osentsibly to give those
without professional access equal time, and to avoid headlines and quick comments from ratings
agencies/following analysts. So that alone is, as you say, a good thing. What bothers me is the lack of product
sales mentioned in the article, but I knew nothing about this company before I got here; bioprinting sounds
pretty new and high-tech, could well be just the stage of the company and technology causing that.


29 Nov 2013, 10:51 AM


Mukticat
You should ask yourself why a company that spends a mere $6M a year on R&D and has $53M cash in the
bank which should last several more years needs to further dilute their shareholders right now? Does this not
give the lie to the above statement?

Mukticat, once again, you keep contradicting yourself.


In few word, what you are saying is: 
1) ONVO has enough cash to run a sustainable business for several more years 
2) ONVO executives are wisely spending the cash 
3) ONVO were able to develop an exciting product prototype with just 6M$ investment leaving us to dream
what they could achieve by investing the additional fund coming from the sell off of the 4M shares mentioned
in their SEC filling.


Basically, you are suggesting to be long in ONVO!


29 Nov 2013, 11:50 AM


Mukticat
1) ONVO doesn't have much worth investigating so perforce their R&D is extremely small.


2) ONVO executives are extremely generous with by awarding themselves millions and millions of shares that
will severely dilute you the shareholder.


3) ONVO has developed a product that might be incrementally better than the existing 3D liver assays for
which there is but a small market. The fact that it cost so little to produce suggests that there will be much
more competition coming to this field and that the stock is grossly overvalued.


I would add that the fact that they keep going back to the retail crowd to cash in is directly due to the utter
indifference of the smart money to their much bally-hoed development.

You should ask yourself if you can trust management. They seem to be "pop and drop" artists for their own
good. Sneaky information releases and no revenue to speak of to indicate a monetization of product or
research. Something smells rotten here. I almost bought the stock last week and decided its not for me.
Neither long nor short !


30 Nov 2013, 06:08 PM


leonct74
FCarone, they are not releasing any sneaky information, they are delivering information to the investors in a
transparent manner through the newsletter and the website. If ONVO would have started to monetize their
amanzingly innovative product already, the share price would have been much much higher than the current
one.  
But if you have a gut feeling towards ONVO you did right not investing on it and as far as I can see ONVO are
not doing anything to attract short term investors just for the sake to pump the share price and this dilution is
a good example.

Mukticat
Great article again Richard!


I think one other point that bears mentioning is the rather suspicious trading that occurred on Wednesday. ONVO had
been on a mild recovery track following the huge selloff that followed your last article 'A Very Detailed Look at ONVO'


http://seekingalpha.co...


After bottoming at 8.00 two days after the article's release the stock rebounded into the 9's and traded for the next five
days in that range gradually drifting toward 10.00. Even on this last Weds the stock traded at 9.75 premarket but
almost from the open the sellers overwhelmed buyers and the stock began to quickly lose steam. Suddenly at mid-
day an avalanche of sells hit the bid and the stock plunged to 9.00 where apparently enough buyers were found to
give it a small lift and the stock eventually closed at 9.16.


The obvious question is; did an insider leak this information? It's hard to explain this trading phenomenon otherwise. If
we assume it's true then we have not a manipulative company that tries to bury bad news when they know investors
aren't looking but an actually corrupt company that selectively discloses material information to a favored few.


I know that ONVO investors will be quick to pooh-pooh this idea but they remind me Upton Sinclair's famous line 'it is
difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it'. Likewise
investors will only see what they want to see if they're already invested in it. Indeed that is why one's emotions and
ego are one of the largest impediments to effective trading.


29 Nov 2013, 10:51 AM


Stan The Man, Contributor
ONVO has been "on a mild recovery track"? What self-serving palaver are you peddling? The stock has been
ON A TEAR. It raced from $9.00 to $13.00 recently on unbelievable volume. The option volatility is around
100, which is really, really high.


Granted, prospects for this or any other new technology are speculative until the money actually comes in.
But there's no denying that tremendous excitement exists about this company's prospects.


29 Nov 2013, 11:08 AM


Mukticat
You clearly mis-read my comment. I said that FOLLOWING the plunge from 13.50 to 8.00 the stock was on a
mild recovery track. Indeed it was gradually climbing back toward 10 until they pulled the rug out on you
again.

I'm all for free speech and our right to say whatever we want, and this should be a responsibility that we all
defend. With that said, we are also under governance to what we say and when opinion turns to accusations
without factual evidence, then you must also be responsible for that action.

Since you will probably be held to this, I must distance myself from any contact with your moniker. 
Good luck

This must be one of the most unenlightened comments I've seen since you have no understanding of free
speech. Free speech does not just protect speech you approve of. But please stay far far away :-)

"Likewise investors will only see what they want to see if they're already invested in it"


These same "visions" apply equally to those who are invested short.


29 Nov 2013, 10:58 AM


Mukticat
That's true if they ignore obvious evidence. For example if all of ONVO's good news (such as the adding of an FAQ to
the website) were released before a holiday or weekend when investors were less likely to be looking while the bad
news were given front and center stage on a Monday morning then one would have to draw a different conclusion.
Likewise if the stock had gone up, or at least stayed flat, but not dropped sharply on Weds, then one would have to
concede that in all likelihood no leak occurred.


I've often seen people twist themselves into pretzels trying to explain away what should be obvious facts and
evidence. They come up with fanciful and even ludicrous explanations. While one can't definitively disprove even the
wildest stories in the present moment there's another theory that does apply. It's called Occam's Razor which holds
that the simplest explanation for an event is generally the correct one. If you leave your apartment and go out and see
drops of water falling it's probably raining, not your neighbor on the roof spraying water from a hose.


But again once invested in a stock people tend to see what they want to see; long or short. Those who can actually
get past these limitations can look forward to a more successful trading career.

You always short onvo and come out with BS! If you look and you are so smart it is not unusual for any company to
do this! Last article you made it sound like all these companies where making the same product as ONVO! You listed
all them in your reference! If anybody would have checked those references they would have found out your
statements where NOT TRUE! They did not make the same product as ONVO! Just because you used the word
ASSAY you made people who where ignorant to the term(as I was) think all ASSAYS where the same! You must think

you are really smart acting like everybody does not know that all stocks often do not release news till Friday! Now why
don't you tell everybody that these people that work for ONVO take part of this stock as PAY or are you going to
continue to act like they are just giving it out like candy! Oh did you mention that Keith Murphy owns over 6,000,000
shares?? No you thought it would look good to say Keith Murphy sold 100,000 shares! It is not unusual for them to do
that to pay taxes or maybe just the fact it is part of his PAY!!! Do you take YOUR PAY??? Get real, you are not dealing
with a bunch of IDIOTS! People do your own DD, examine everything this man says! I am long and would check out a
longs article before I decided to believe every good thing about a company!!!

To the author


If you have a chance over the weekend could you post another article using a heavier dose of negative connotation. I
was hoping to back the truck up today in the 6's but I don't see it happening.


Maybe you could get Mukticat to assist with more negatives.


Thanks

haha. that's light hhess. you are great investor. like modern day buffett. i like onvo. See big move!

Car Buyer
The timing of the release when compared with previous similar releases leads one to imply something is not above
board and trying to be hidden by management. Maybe not, maybe so. Time will tell. Where there's smoke, there's
usually a fire. Meanwhile, I bought at 6.20 on Oct 21st and had an automatic stop loss sale at 10.50 on the Nov 19th
which preserved profits. I'm going to wait and see what happens before getting back into ONVO. I always allow 1
wildcard gambling stock in my trading portfolio.


29 Nov 2013, 12:08 PM


Somguy
Why are you so convinced that no one noticed this. Are you the only one that has the ability to read day old press
releases? Did the rest of the market really not notice it?


Keith Murphy did sell shares on Friday. Have you ever looked at how much he sold? 3% of his holdings... A man's
gotta eat. Stop pretending like this is the end of the world.

I am an Organovo shareholder who DID notice the the Wednesday filing. Perhaps Mr. Pearson can explain how the
date of the filing affects the dilution of shares. I'm staying long for the future of this incredible technology.


29 Nov 2013, 05:11 PM

I see no relevance to the timing of the filing--the dilution factor will be the same. Organovo remains on the cutting
edge of mind-boggling technology. I am staying long for the future.

Once again, I reiterate, this is ADVENTURE CAPITAL! 
For example; A bank will always lend you money when you don't need it, but, they will not lend to you when you really
could use it. 
Mr. Market is kind of like that. 
I think Mr. Pearson is whining once again because the company did not decide to do something debt related, and, he
had no chance to get in on it. 
(Something like issuing a convertible preferred stock, convertible at some arbitrary price in 3 years. This would be
offered to institutions. They could do a 1 million share offering at $15 per share with some 7 or 8 per cent interest rate,
shares convertible in 3 years at a price per common of $7, and 3 shares of common per 1 share of convertible.) 
Doing a convertible provides a hedge for shorts, while collecting interest. 
So, if you are the company, and were looking to raise capital, which way would you go? 
Debt, or, equity? 
Mr. Pearson would very much prefer a debt offering to hedge his short position but, I am not in that camp with an
"Adventure Capital" company. 
There is risk when you invest in Venture Capital. Adventure Capital is a public market which can be subject to
"trading" and "timing" and has absolutely no correlation to actual "investing". 
Sorry, I choose NOT to be a trader. Therefore, I save myself added drama and stress, which also leads me down the
path of "non-whining and manipulation". 
Thank you.

Looking to get back in at 5-6. Had original at 2 and sold at 8, bought back in at 5 and sold at 10. I like the technology
and feel the company is being upfront with everythng they do. The timing or releasing some info just so happens to
look. If all the naysayer's can point out is the "timing" of releasing the info then they should look a little harder. Most
biotechs a very speculative and ONVO is no differ. I like ONVO long but waiting to get back in till things calm down
some.

Let's not forget to appreciate the income the Shorters garner for themselves every time they issue a controversial

How about management taking this company private.While at the same time management is getting rich by giving
themselves a lot of stock options.


If you buy this stock you are just hoping to sell to a greater idiot.


You will make a couple of bucks but you will leave yourself open for more losses than you a prepared to take.


Anyone can see what management is doing but does not want to admit it.


Good luck to you who invest and learn one of the lesson about investing.

leonct74
mrfun5, if you read the SEC filling rather than Mr Pearson article (who is declaring himself to be ''short'' on
ONVO) you would see that the diluition was right to finance the R&D of the new stream of surgically
implanted bio-printed products and potential aquisition (see my previous comment on this article were I
pasted the SEC filling statement about the purpose of dilution).


02 Dec 2013, 04:44 AM


Mukticat
And if you were to read the 10-Q you would see that ONVO had a record $53M in cash on the books as of
Sept 30th, two months ago. Their annual R&D expense is of a small $6M. Therefore they have at least three
or four years worth of cash and they want us to believe that they're forced to dilute shareholders right NOW
again?!?


No, they're just looking for a way to cash in on the temporary spike in price and trying to cover it up.


Look at it this way; if they don't need to raise more money for another 3 or 4 years why would they sell now in
the 8's if they thought waiting a few years the stock price would be much higher? ?


Answer: They wouldn't. ONVO thinks today is the best price they'll see.


02 Dec 2013, 09:53 AM


leonct74
Muk, you should join the ONVO conference call on the 5th of December, I guess they will provide further
details about the plan how to invest the funds from the 4M shares sell off. 
As a shareholder, I wouldn't be happy to hear the management spending all cash in R&D for new products
and aquisitions.


Who told you that they are going to sell off the 4M shares right now in the 8's?


You should be very careful with your statements and posting all sorts of assumptions and theories...


02 Dec 2013, 10:43 AM


Mukticat
Oh I intend to attend this joke of a 'Retail Investor Conference' which is nothing like it sounds like. It's just an
opportunity to watch a free sit-at-home webcast from ten mostly unknown companies that pay to pitch naive
retail investors on how wonderful and spectacular their prospects are. ONVO uses this forum on an almost
monthly basis because it's a safe platform from where no one will actually challenge their hype.


The effects on the stock price are likely to be very minor and transient.


But when you're busy selling stock rounding up as many sheeple as you can is key!

RFIL, I think that this population can go down to 20 simple moving average in the following days technically.
Fundaments I dont know. I think market cant evaluate technology and can be at this price overvalued.

Interesting that you should say that; RFIL dropped from $13.xx to $10.xx yesterday. I have not checked today;
as I had a partial sale in at 14ish, which was seemingly hopeless cancelled it; I am still up 70% or so, so will
check again this afternoon, after looking for news. Too dramatic for me!

Richard, Is this an SA Pro article? Was this published a day earlier than we saw it? Thank you :))


01 Dec 2013, 05:19 PM


Mukticat
This latest bit of bad press comes courtesy of Motley Fool-


'investors should temper their expectations for any explosions in revenue in the near future. Toxicology assays
developed at Organovo may be novel and may add value to the pharmaceutical industry, but even then, the company
would have to sell an incredible amount of them to crack $100 million in sales. That watermark will also take years to
reach.


It seems a bit premature to value Organovo Holdings anywhere near $1 billion given its underwhelming potential for
revenue in the next few years. It is also a risky stock for individual investors to own with less than 10% institutional
ownership and fewer than 80 million shares available. Regardless of stock price, I'm steering my investing boat clear
of the company. I want to see progress in development materialize into real sales potential before I consider buying.'


http://bit.ly/1bdenTs


*********************


I guess Motley Fool saw the light considering that they had previously run a series of five positive articles about
ONVO during the runup to 13.50 peak. The story of this stock has morphed from 'This stock has infinite promise!' to
'Man is this thing overvalued!!'


02 Dec 2013, 10:16 AM


leonct74
Muk, basically you are saying that Monthleyfool articles are un-reliable, so why are you posting them?


02 Dec 2013, 11:17 AM


Mukticat
As I said I think they saw the light and stopped letting guest writers who were long ONVO post articles trying
to hype the company. Now they're actually doing some analysis of the company claims and finding them quite
wanting.


Maybe they don't want to let SA be the only credible forum for discussing stocks.

need to drive this stock down to make more short money? With 761 comments I am sure you have better
things going on?

Mukticat
That's a silly comment. I don't personalize stocks or fall in love with them. That's your provence. I view ONVO
as merely a trade and while it's still above 1.00* it's pretty overvalued.


Given that the company is doing its level best to hype the stock someone(s) ought to at least present the
opposite case why this is just pure hype. Then investors can make up their own minds.


 
* they do have about 65c/share in cash so there's some book value.

They've also got four state of the art bioprinting machines, a partnership with AutoDesk to develop 3D
bioprinting software, a strong management team, top-rate scientists, and I suppose a few other sundry and
completely irrelavent assets that can't possibly be considered to have any value whatsoever. Just a pack of
sleezos out to fleece the little guy. Kinda hard to believe that.

Jeb, you're talking about potential here, sort of like building a circumstantial case to buy. It's no doubt an
interesting story but when a stock sells off from highs on 25x average volume, it's not ready for prime time.
Putting aside the insider sales and secondary offering, it could take years for the company to become
profitable. There's a solid case for over-valuation here.


Short ONVO targeting 5.50.


03 Dec 2013, 10:38 AM


David Jennings, Contributor
The longs all understand they are betting on future potential. The shorts all understand they are betting on
current value. And the best way for the shorts to achieve their end is to scare the longs out of their positions.
Meanwhile, it appears to me that ONVO just keeps plugging along with their goal to develop viable 3D
bioprinting, and not to deceive their investors.

Fiver, as other bearish investors, I'm afraid you missed to do a proper analysis of ONVO short term product
potentials. I think we will have some further details to discuss about their product and potentials revenues in a
couple of days after the retails investors conference.


03 Dec 2013, 11:11 AM


Fiver Capital, Contributor
The universe of stocks with price to book and price to sales valuations over 10 coupled with negative cash
flow and earnings is miniscule. I understand the potential but a buy here is as speculative as they come. So is
a short! Which is why I'm operating with defined risk and prepared to be proven wrong.


03 Dec 2013, 12:16 PM


leonct74
Fair enough Fiver, I value and respect your point of view and strategy.


I’m long in ONVO and I’m glad to see ‘’shorters’’ around because I genuinely believe they contribute to mitigate the
volatility and ensure an healthy grow of the share price and company business as long as they don't release false or
distort information about the company.


I just believe that ONVO share price will easily grow at least 100% per year (18$ in twelve months) because investors
are recognizing the peculiarity and potential of ONVO products and therefore I don't see why investors should be
bother to trade the volatility at this current price. In this case, it is just more risky to be short than buy and hold.


Of course, we are both aligned with our own strategies and only the time will tell us who is wrong and who is right, but
I have the feeling that ONVO is gathering a solid base of long investors and so creating volatility more on the upside.

As a fan of ONVO, It's fun to revisit vitriolic short-side articles on days like today, when it rises in a weak market.


05 Dec 2013, 04:37 PM


Mukticat
We all know why it rose and it had nothing to do with the markets.


Keith clarified one thing today; the dilution's only just begun. They still have some $70M worth of stock to sell.
That could translate to another 10M shares. And when investors look at ONVO they don't ask 'how much
cash is in the balance sheet', they ask 'what's the marketcap and what are the sales'. Dilution only makes it
look worse, a lot worse. Plus selling At The Market means that instead of raising capital from institutions who
would support the stock - and maybe get them some analyst coverage - they sell directly to the noobs who
wouldn't know a liver assay from foi gras.


It's also an admission that no institution would touch them at this price level. And it means downward
pressure on the stock as they join the sellers.

leonct74
Yeah, yeah... Muk, actually these foolish investors are making money out of ONVO, from your continuos
rambling I could conclude you are loosing some sleep with your short...


05 Dec 2013, 05:44 PM


Mukticat
'loosing'? Whatever.


'foolish investors' could surely have made money on Pets.com too, for awhile anyway. This proves what?


How about addressing why ONVO is the Rodney Dangerfield of billion dollar companies? It gets no respect
from the smart money crowd. And isn't it suspicious that a company with such a high-fallutin' story can't
attract investments from Big Pharma or institutional investors and so they're forced to pitch this to the least
educated investors out there? Or that they can't attract any analysts to cover this stock? Or that the last and
only analyst they had - Jason Napodano of Zacks - called the stock 'grossly overvalued above $4 - 5'?


These are serious questions that actually matter; not whether some trader is making or losing money which is
irrelevant.


06 Dec 2013, 03:15 PM


leonct74
I see Muk... I think everyone here is investing to make money and if they were listening to your comments on
ONVO they would have already loose the opportunity to make plenty of money. Are you telling me that this is
not enough to prove you to be wrong!?


I appreciate you give some trust to Zack evaluation (4$ to 5$), since just 4 days before (December 2) you
stated that ‘’ONVO is pretty over evaluated above 1$ ’’!!!  
It looks that yours and Zack evaluations are quite distant to each other…


Zack evaluation is also rather outdated since it was done before ONVO achieved the 40 days retention of key
liver function tissue which is the key prove that they are on the way to deliver their promise.


Everyone should invest based on own due diligence rather than just following the flocks who invest based on
what others such as Mr Person or Analysts says. I firmly believe it is better to invest in company such ONVO
before the big players declares their coverage, otherwise you will sit on the higher-end of the share price
taking the smallest piece of the cake.


Finally, big pharmas are actually investing in ONVO, what about Pfizer and Roche? 
What about Big cosmetic company such as Loreal? 
What about big software company such as Autodesk? 
Do you really think these companies have time and resources to waste collaborating in a business model
which they think will never be delivered??

Fiver Capital, Contributor
Curious to hear the longs perspective on whether any new info came out of the investor conference? I watched the
presentation online but didn't come away feeling much has changed. There's a triangle forming on the chart; a break
of the $9 area will suggest the short thesis plays out in the near term.


06 Dec 2013, 02:09 PM


leonct74
Fiver, I'm afraid we have watched two different conferences... What I saw instead was the confirmation of new
bio-printed surgically implanted products, further details on the business model and reinforcement of the
commitment to generate money and expanding product portfolio in 2014.


What did you expected to hear more than this at the conference? That they will develop organs next year!!??


I see they have reached a point of maturity with their tissue which is widening their potential business even in
the short term. 
While they will progress with refining the product and business model in Q1 '14, we can reasonably expect a
lot of announcements to be done in the coming weeks and months and each update will represent a very
powerful catalyst which could harm your ''short''.


I struggle to understand how your ''technical analysts and charts'' work as already on the 5th of December
you were declaring to take a short position from 9$ targeting 5.50$ and since then shares went well above
your initial coverage... Maybe, you should review your technical analysis and assumptions?


To be honest, I neither belive that a potential taper will affect ONVO price (if that is your assumption).
Although it is likely that some money will be cashed out of equities under Christmas and with the fear of a
taper, we could expect investors to leave some ''chips'' on the table in small caps stocks with high potential,
just to keep the game running so to speak.


09 Dec 2013, 07:12 AM


Fiver Capital, Contributor
My technical analysis is sound. The resistance around $10 held and the triangle support at $9 broke today.
High beta spec names are going to get crushed here.


11 Dec 2013, 03:32 PM


Mukticat
It's really amazing how the stock struggles for seven days to grind higher from 8.40 to 10.20 and then gives it
all up in a single day (mostly).


It's what happens when it's all promotion and no conviction (or institutions). Hedge fund traders just play rope-
a-dope all day long with the retail.

leonct74
Greenfire, after the updates and information given at the retail conference, I believe that shorts have
extinguished their arguments.  
Last short attempt was above 13$ when investors knew very little about ONVO products and plans, I don't
see how shorts could even think to play the gamble at 10$. 
We could expect some attempts at higher price and in conjunction with really negative catalysts to build on it,
such as major insider sales or a huge dilution which I personally don't think is going to happen. 
When this stock will over 15$, it will make so much positive noise that I won't be surprise to see some ''big
guys'' declaring an initiation of coverage.


10 Dec 2013, 04:44 AM

Leon,  
Would you mind enlightening us with updated "products & plans" ?? 
If I'm missing some sort of revenue here, please fill us in.


13 Dec 2013, 12:43 PM


leonct74
Greenfire, maybe what you are not taking into account is that the day ONVO will release their disruptive
products in the market its share price will probably be in the order of hundreds of $.


ONVO is a game-changer, so either you don't believe they will deliver the product and therefore see it over
evaluated or you believe they will deliver the promise and buy long ONVO until the price is still affordable.


Based on my DD, I personally believe they are getting there and I don't need to see big revenues right now.


No one, ever made much money without betting on future prospects and potential of a business.

Is it too risky for you? Then you can always take lower risks investing in blue-chips wiht dividends and maybe
making 5% to 10% Y/Y (in a bullish good year).


16 Dec 2013, 08:13 AM


Greenfire87
Well then that will be the day to buy ("in the hundreds"). Until then, it's still overvalued. Like everything in life,
it has to prove itself first, not just speculation. 
I think it's great you hope It'll be in the hundreds. I'm sure BRK.B will run up to 100k like BRK.A but no one is
paying that up front either.  
I still find onvo's price way ahead of itself.

4,000,000 here, an extra 5,000,000 there and soon enough there's an awful lot of stock floating around!


I'm gonna have to update the Insider Sales list to include Keith Murphy's latest 100,000 share sale on Tuesday.


http://1.usa.gov/1gtKtCM


At a million dollars a month the dude is getting seriously rich off the daytraders :-)


100,000 @ 10.075 = $1,007,500


Not to worry though he 'only' has another 6,500,000 shares left to sell before he runs out . . . . until he awards himself
more stock under the new 11.5M share 'Equity Incentive Plan'.


'An aggregate of 11,553,986 shares of common stock may be offered or issued pursuant to the Organovo Holdings,
Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), 6,553,986 of which were previously registered on Form S-8 (File No. 333-
181324), and 5,000,000 of which are registered on this Form S-8.'


http://1.usa.gov/1gtKwhK


The new S-8 was necessary because obviously only having 6,553,986 shares to hand out wasn't gonna be enough.
They'll need that extra 5,000,000 to really reward Keith for the great job he's doing.

Here an attempt. I spend 20 min on that, so I am not claiming it is 100% right. However, I do believe it points in the
right direction.


ONVO is extremely overvalued IMO


You can find the Insphero AG's data used in this post ... here:


http://bit.ly/1eeUe7H


1. Inshpero AG received secured its first (Series A Financing) in August 2010! 
Zürcher KantonalBank and Redalpine Venture Partners subscribed the CHF 1’800’000 financing (approx. USD
2’000’000).


02/Aug/2010, the Company's Capital (nominal) was increased by CHF 22'058 (from CHF 100'000).  
22'058 new shares were issued at a nominal value of exactly CHF 1 / share.


The Company issued 22'058 shares in exchange of USD 2,000,000 in capital. (Price per share: approx. USD 90.00
per share)


2. June 18, 2013 - InSphero secures CHF 2’000’000 Million Financing 
“…Successfully closed a financing round of CHF 2’000’000 last month (approx. 2’200’000 USD). This series B
financing was …“


05/July/2013, the capital was increased from CHF 208'694.00 to CHF 233'164.00, adding 24,470 shares.


The company issued 24,470 shares and get in return of USD 2,200,000 in capital. (Price per share = approx. USD
90.00 per share)


Aug2010, Implied Company Valuation: USD 20,984,760


Assuming Insphero AG has no debt and no Cash, the resulting EV is USD 21m


ONVO Enterprise Value is 668m USD! … 31x greater than Insphero EV!


If you consider that  
- Insphero is already generating revenue / selling the tissues, 
- Insphero counts all of the top ten global pharmaceutical and cosmetics companies as customers,  
- Insphero’s tissues and technology is already used/studied by Pfizer and Roche 
- the in-shelf life of Insphero 3D liver Micro-Tissues is 90 days vs. only 40 days of ONVO liver tissues 
- InshperO has almost same number of workers of ONVO (25) 
…. … you will have an hard time … in justifying ONVO’s valuation!  
ONVO and Insphero are two very similar companies (Insphero is a little bit ahead of ONVO from a technological and
executional point of view). They do however have two complete different Valuation!


Private Equity experts valued Insphero at USD 21m in June 2013, while Irrational Retail investors value ONVO at a
whopping USD 668m EV! (a 3’176 % premium)


Well, sorry if in my valuation I do trust more to Private Equity Experts!


Does the Fact that ONVO is a public traded Company and does therefore offer its shareholders a degree of liquidity
on their investments … justify a 3’176% Premium!

Assuming that: 
1. Private Equity investors entered into Insphero at a bargain-price (and estimating the FV of Insphero at USD 40m)  
2. A 25% Market Liquidity Premium


… if follows that ONVO fair valued Market Capitalization should be approximately: USD116m


Corresponding to a Price per Share of USD 1.5985


ORGANVO, at current Prices, is 484% Overvalued!


-83% downside risk !

Thank you for adding some more color to the insane overvaluation of ONVO.


Keith was supersmart to get this company publicly traded and go out there and sell a story (and stock) every
day. He's already worth $70M !!! For a company that has done just about nothing. Only in America, lol.
Amazing.


15 Dec 2013, 04:17 PM


leonct74
Unemon, Isphero and ONVO have two different products and therefore two different future potential
applications which greatly justify the different evaluation.


Without going too much in scientific details, to bio-print ''functional'' human tissues without scaffolds such as
ONVO does, it is fairly different from putting cells together in a trail.


This ''small'' difference is what makes potentially achievable for ONVO not only to have a better drug testing
platform but to print any type of human tissues for therapeutic and surgical purposes and maybe one day
entire organs for transplant purposes.


If Inshero human ''MICRO-tissues'' were so good, you should ask yourself why they keep selling ''rat'' liver
tissues.. Maybe, this is the reason why Insphero have a wide range of animal tissues in their development
pipeline, such as: mouse, dog and mini-pig tissues?


I invite anyone to do your own DD and not trust any article on the web written by independent writers (i.e.
Pearson who is a disclosed ‘’short’’ ONVO) and without any traceable scientific or business background.

They are all taken from Red Alpine Capital web site who promotes Insphero in their portfolio, hereby the link:

I believe that this community would appreciate some more substantial scientific source of information.


If you want to know more about Inshero, just go to their website and verify yourself that Inshero still sells ''rat

mouse and mini-Pig!
