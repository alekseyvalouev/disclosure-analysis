Sphere 3D: Cloud Company Can't Rise Above Hype, Mistakes And
Poor Management

Summary


Hype at its best. Sphere 3D's bought-and-paid-for promotions artificially kick the
stock price over the moon.


Currently no real commercial product, though Sphere 3D has been at it about five
years now.


No organic sales. The company pays dearly to claim an acquisition’s puny sales as
its own.


Looming options and warrants poised to hit the market.


Large salaries for inexperienced execs, little money, big cash burn with a need to
burn multi-millions more. We believe it’s all too clear - dilution is imminent.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


From its rocky beginnings as a fake mining company to its absurd overpayment for a little
two-man shop, Sphere 3D Corp. (SPIHF) (ANY.V) has signaled the true meaning of the
"D" in its name: "Deep six" this stock before it's too late.


The Canadian technology company has gone screaming into the stratosphere. The stock
smashed new 52-week highs five times in three months and is trading on the TSXV
Canadian exchange as "ANY.V." Now at around $9, the stock is also listed on the
alternative trading system OTCQB as "SPIHF."


But research by TheStreetSweeper indicates all the screaming will soon be done by
ANY.V investors pushing and shoving and galloping for the exits.


What's behind all the recent excitement surrounding the stock of a company that reported
zero revenue last year? Blatant, baseless promotions by a company desperate to get
listed on the NASDAQ's subsidiary OMX. Additionally, retail investors anticipate that
ANY.V's earnings report later this month might finally show some commercial revenue for

its emulation and virtualization product. The patent-pending technology is designed to
make applications run on a cell phone, iPad or other device as easily as they run on a
person's computer at home or work.


But disaster lurks. And here's how TheStreetSweeper sees it breaking out:


· Hype at its best. Bought-and-paid-for promotions artificially kick the stock price over the
moon.


· Currently no real commercial product.


· No organic sales. ANY.V pays dearly to claim an acquisition's puny sales as its own.


· Looming options and warrants poised to hit the market.


· Large salaries for inexperienced execs, little money, big cash burn with a need to burn
multi-millions more. We believe it's all too clear - dilution is imminent.


TheStreetSweeper has requested an interview but ANY.V has not responded.


SUPREME HYPE


ANY.V proudly links to not one - not two - not six - but nine articles in How to Find Big
Stocks. These promos of ANY.V seem just a little like the kind of material sent out by
Jonathon Lebed, a stock promoter and newsletter writer noted for his youthful brush with
the US Securities and Exchange Commission and his disclosure urging people never to
trade on his advice unless they're prepared to lose the entire investment.


In fact, ANY.V is so desperate for attention, the company has taken on its own promoter.
That hired gun is USA Investor Link, pulling in $10,000 monthly plus about $2.8 million in
stock options.


CEO Peter Tassiopoulos issued a statement in March 2013 about hiring USA Investor Link
to address the "increased interest we are receiving from the investment and business
community."


Let's just take a look at USA Investor's previous clients… Whoa - maybe ANY.V should
have done some due diligence before peeling off investors' hard-earned dollars to pay the
two-man USA Investor Link.


Almost exactly a year before ANY.V's announcement about its USA Investor deal,
Canada-based NWM Mining Corp. (OTCPK:NWMMF) issued its own statement about
hiring USA Investor "due to a significant increase in the level of interest from the U.S.

Investment community …"


If anyone's interested now, a share of NWM Mining stock costs just a fraction of a penny.


NO REAL PRODUCT


The promoters' jobs are all the more difficult since ANY.V has not created a real
commercial product. That's why the company's financial statement - which isn't readily
accessible to US investors - lists a big, fat "0" under revenue.


Yes, ANY.V would whine that investors gotta believe. They've got to believe that the
company's patents - which are simply applications that have been filed - will amount to
something someday.


The product Glassware 2.0 is not ready for prime time yet. And, like the CEO says, it's
been years in the making.


"We've been at this since early 2009 and we're kind of tired of research and
development. We've been doing this for a while," said CEO Tassiopoulos.


ANY.V is pushing to get a listing on the NASDAQ even though this 5-year-old product still
apparently hasn't moved past the demonstration stage.


And even though ANY.V may want to believe its product is special, many, many
companies are already doing what ANY.V wants to do. There's Citrix, ePlus, Vology,
VMware, ITS and the list goes on and on. At least since 2007, there's even been free,
open-source software to virtualize Android and more.


Most of all, the biggest gorilla in the forest is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The $333 billion
company's highly acclaimed Windows Azure helps people work anywhere on any device.
Like ANY.V would like to do.


Indeed, ANY.V has been stumbling in an environment that is gradually becoming even
rockier for tech companies. Billionaire David Einhorn called out a warning in his quarterly
letter to investors in his Greenlight Capital fund.


"Now there is clear consensus that we are witnessing our second tech bubble in 15
years," Mr. Einhorn wrote. "What is uncertain is how much further the bubble can
expand, and what might pop it."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217483-sphere-3d-cloud-company-cant-rise-above-hype-mistakes-and-poor-management 4/23


What ANY.V is really up to, as we see it, is that the company realizes that it's getting
nowhere with its own product. So it is entering that magical land called roll-up-ville.


That's right. It's a rollup company. Much like these ridiculous rollups that
TheStreetSweeper has warned investors about: Tangoe (TNGO) ($19.55 day of article,
now $14) Swisher Hygiene (NASDAQ:SWSH) ($8 day of article, now 40 cents) and
Revolution Lighting (NASDAQ:RVLT) ($4 day of article, now $2).


Those companies are way out of ANY.V's league as far as assets, revenue and
management. But, in our opinion, the coming ANY.V disaster is likely to be just as
spectacular - or even more so.


BIG MONEY FOR TINY ACQUISITION


ANY.V announced expected first quarter revenue to exceed $1 million. But what the
company didn't announce was that it paid dearly for that smidgen of revenue.


The bulk of that money for rollup ANY.V is likely to be thanks to the acquisition in March of
V3 Systems. According to Dun & Bradstreet's WorldBase, the little Utah-based V3
Systems was a one-to-two-man operation that last year managed to make only $535,256
in sales.


Yet ANY.V trotted in like a gang of happy pups and agreed to pay $9.7 million for V3.


That's 1.1 million shares of ANY.V stock plus $4 million cash - an acquisition ANY.V could
manage only by signing a $5 million debt deal with Cyrus Capital Partners - a company
that describes itself as a debt fund manager that invests in "financially distressed"
companies.


Incredibly, ANY.V paid more than 18 times V3's sales. Yes - 18 times more!


NAME OF THE GAME: ODD ACQUISITIONS


Acquisitions have played a big role for ANY.V since the beginning.


The boys behind T.B. Mining Venture, the shell company that reverse-merged into ANY.V,
were only slightly coy about what they'd be mining. Canadian regulatory records show T.B.
Mining did not operate in the usual business fashion. Instead, it popped out its 2010 IPO
of 1.5 million shares at 20 cents each to raise money for one purpose and one purpose
only - to search for "assets," "businesses," or "non-arms-length transactions."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217483-sphere-3d-cloud-company-cant-rise-above-hype-mistakes-and-poor-management 5/23


ANY.V's current president Mario Biasini, with leadership experience limited to his small
graphics arts company Promotion Depot, oversaw the 2012 reverse merger and name
change to Sphere 3D. He invited a couple of buddies, Giovanni "John" Morelli, the
inventor of the "emulation and virtualization technology" and financial expert Mr.
Worthington along for the ride.


Though you won't see ANY.V trumpeting this fact, Promotion Depot had the original
development stage product that ANY.V has been trying to build into a real company.
Canadian filings show that in 2010, ANY.V acquired "all rights and assets related to the
emulation and virtualization technology from Promotion Depot Inc." and paid $695,000.


BIG BOYS, BIG MONEY, BAD BUSINESSES


If ANY.V's been good for anybody, it's been good for top executives. It showered the top
four guys last year with over $1 million in total compensation.


Canadian regulatory filings say Mr. Tassiopoulos received a big hunk of that executive
payday last year - $459,611.


Part of that compensation is cheap stock. Mr. Tassiopoulos has the option to buy 100,000
shares of ANY.V for just 85 cents each -about one-tenth of what the shares would bring in
today's market.


Mr. Tassiopoulos became a director in 2012 and CEO in 2013, riding up to ANY.V on his
business development connections -- and despite his leadership of several dismal
companies. Though his ANY.V profile certainly doesn't tout his role in Argentium
Resources (OTC:AGTMF), he served as a director of the silver and gold mining company.
Listed on the OTC exchange with ANY.V's alter-ego SPIHF, Argentium stock last traded
Dec. 24, 2013 for just a fraction of 1 penny.


Until he was fired, Mr. Tassiopoulos also held COO and then CEO titles in 2009-2011 with
Biosign Technologies (OTC:BITKF) (BIO.V). Also not mentioned in his company profile,
Biosign is a healthcare software company listed on the same exchange with ANY.V.
Biosign trades for about 3 cents.


Most recently, a material change filing - and a press release that buried the real news
beneath a chirpy announcement about a recently hired sales manager - noted that Mr.
Tassiopoulos' ascension in ANY.V included pushing Mr. Morelli out of the company two
months ago and grabbing the man's director title.

More information on ailing companies associated with Mr. Tassiopoulos is available here.
Both negative and positive viewpoints about ANY.V may be found here.


OVER 1 MILLION EXTRA OPTIONS PLANNED, MORE STOCK LOOMING


As if executives aren't already draining enough from this struggling company, they are
ready to get their hands on even more.


ANY.V shareholders will meet May 27 to vote on items such as amending the stock plan.
Here's how:


The three best-paid executives - Mr. Tassiopoulos, Mr. Biasini and CFO T. Scott
Worthington - would get access to more than 1 million additional options to purchase
ANY.V shares. According to filings, the number of options granted to those best-paid
execs would jump from 3.38 million to 4.65 million.


So $30 million to $40 million is not a bad potential payday for these guys. Especially from
a company that handed investors a loss of 14 cents per share.


And those new options aren't the only such worry for investors. Filings indicate (click on
the April 29, 2014 MD&A):


· Options could spring about another 1.2 million shares on the market. Some were as
cheap as 51 cents to 85 cents.


· Warrants set for June 27 release: 1.1 million shares.


· Warrants set for Dec. 27 release: 1.3 million shares.


· Total warrants set for 2014-2015 release: 6.3 million shares.


Not including the 1 million extra options that directors want, we estimate the force of the
current options and warrants bearing down on the market could reach about 7.5 million
shares.


At ANY.V's recent stock price of about $9, with 23 million shares outstanding, the current
market cap is about $207 million.


The market cap under the looming options and warrants scenario at the $9 price, would
reach a stunning $274.5 million.


That huge chunk of change is outlandish for a company with little more than hype to call
its own.

CONCLUSION


Management is sucking the company dry as they throw away millions on salaries,
promotions and acquisitions to support an aging idea. They're hoping to turn that idea into
a product that they can turn into a real company. They will continue to seek more money,
more money, and more money as they pursue this desperate, losing effort.


We've just begun digging into ANY.V yet the ultimate outcome is clear. This company is
just begging to be deep-sixed.


Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper hold a short position in ANY.V and stand to
profit on any future declines in the stock price.•Editor's Note: As a matter of policy,

From the 4/24/14 PR below -


"We have tested many of today's leading virtualization technologies and have looked at a number of potential
solutions; none were able to deliver the simple migration to virtualization and incredible performance that we
get from the Sphere 3D approach to virtual computing." said Paul Shumway, Senior Vice President of
Novarad, "The first time we saw our products run on Glassware 2.0, we were sold."


 
Novarad Selects Glassware 2.0 Virtualization Platform From Sphere 3D


Collaboration Agreement Will Allow for the Delivery of Performance Enhancements, New IaaS Capabilities,
and Windows XP Migration


 
MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, April 24, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sphere 3D Corporation (TSXV:ANY)
(OTCQX:SPIHF), a virtualization technology solution provider and Novarad Corporation, supplier of one of the
top 3 rated PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) in America, announced today that they
have entered into a collaboration agreement for the utilization of Glassware 2.0™ as infrastructure for the
delivery of next generation Radiology Software.


According to a study from Global Industry Analysts, Inc. the Global market for PACS is forecast to reach
US$6.1 billion by 2018, driven by governments push for healthcare IT implementation, rising demand for
medical imaging procedures and increasing sophistication of imaging modalities. In addition, the study claims
"Today, PACS and RIS are among the most sought-after healthcare IT solutions among healthcare providers
seeking an improvement in workflow efficiency and productivity." The global market for Healthcare IT is
expected to reach US$103 Billion by 2020 according to research from Grand View Research, Inc.


The Collaboration agreement will allow Sphere 3D and Novarad to offer an on premise appliance for the
delivery of Novarad software to healthcare providers; without the requirement to refresh workstation
hardware. By delivering an Infrastructure as a Service ("IaaS") offering, customers can take advantage of a
prebuilt solution based on a verified architecture that reduces deployment risk and accelerates time to
availability.

The drop-in appliance approach, coupled with the Glassware 2.0™ architecture, delivers enterprise-class
performance, reliability and the ability to quickly scale both up and out to meet the needs of the enterprise. In,
addition, by deploying centralized hosted applications on premise, IT departments are afforded an immediate
solution to deal with the recent end of support for Windows XP; replacement of Windows XP represents a
substantial opportunity with an estimated 30 percent of computers being used around the world still running
the 12-year-old operating system.


"We have tested many of today's leading virtualization technologies and have looked at a number of potential
solutions; none were able to deliver the simple migration to virtualization and incredible performance that we
get from the Sphere 3D approach to virtual computing." said Paul Shumway, Senior Vice President of
Novarad, "The first time we saw our products run on Glassware 2.0, we were sold."


"Novarad's radiology software solutions are consistently given top KLAS ratings and recognized for their ease
of use, advanced features, and ability to increase productivity," said Stoney Hall VP Global Sales, Sphere 3D
"we are honored to be working with one of the healthcare industry's leading vendors in integrated PACS and

Sonya, interesting read thanks. Just wanted to point out that Sphere 3D does in fact have a commercial product. It's
the Corel Wordperfect for iPad app that was recently released.


It's available for download in the iTunes store for a free limited time trial. http://bit.ly/1porDSE


Reviews are pretty bad though. The latest version's average is 1.5 stars out of 5. A lawyer/tech blogger also reviewed
the product here http://bit.ly/1oPI3iG. Also a negative review.


Might contribute to why Sphere 3D doesn't really talk about its relationship with Corel any more.

HTFBS is NOT a paid promoter. They covered this company since THEY discovered it in August, hence why the

You are on the other hand, are a short in DEEP trouble. There is currently 1.7 million shares shorted OFFICIALLY,
and there are just as many naked shares shorted as this is a Canadian stock.

The irony is many longs have been waiting for a new hit piece to drop the stock price and buy like crazy, kinda
think Sheldon would have bought maybe another 100k too.


No volume and buys causes the price to rise dramatically, what will happen when the naked shares need to
cover before NASDAQ and then what will happen to the 1.7 million shares that are covered to cover or get a
margin call and be sold out at market price.

Seems to me that in these modern times almost each 
individual soul living on this planet seeks his/hers ten minutes of glory 
no matter at what cost or how misinformed is hence revealing openly the so called ignorance? 
Today i add one more to the list someone from The Street Sweeper with a 
a broken broom that has absolutely no knowledge of what an IT company 
is capable of doing and how beneficial is in the health care + oher sectors. 
I believe she rushed to sweep away in a bag milestones that this company has achieved lately and where the
company is aiming at without pondering. Unfortunately she's after those few minutes of Glory at any cost and writes
an article on a public financial site probably dictated from somebody else sinking 
in deep waters without contemplating or doing a real examination and profound D/D of the company. 
One question I would like to ask Sonya:  
-How much have you been compensated to bring the stock back down from the moon? 
I believe this is the million dollar question!

Can you make a leap of faith that Overland's management just merged with worthless company? Overland is 34 year
old company, and it has been in business for a while. How do you explain today's move?


15 May 2014, 08:53 PM


WallStPirate
Right now the shorts are working their spin machine and they will probably respond that both companies are
worthless so it doesn't matter.


Then we will ask about the bought deal for all cash and no special concessions and they will respond it was
Monopoly money.


Then we will ask what about the large owners of stock in Overland that went along with the deal and they will
say lots of drugs.


 
Lastly they are still on track to go to the tsx and nasdaq before the merger.


Tomorrow is going to be fun to watch.


15 May 2014, 09:35 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Indeed. The good news is I can probably get a borrow on Overland as a proxy for ANY, and with the private
placement ANY is doing now more shares should loosen up.


My take is Overland is desperate basket case hitting a cash wall. As of March 31 it had about $2.4M in cash
and losing about $7M per quarter. Stock in the tank (down 80% over 2 years).


Per the 10-Q just filed Sphere is having to loan $5M to Overland LOL.


15 May 2014, 09:51 PM

Overland is 85% owned by insiders which puts the float on a tight string, so borrow and short all you want but
Cyprus will protect.

Ahh, I get in now. They had to do the deal. OVRL was on the brink of insolvency with $9mm in cash, $11mm in debt
and burning cash. If OVRL went tuts up, Sphere 3D would lose its "big partner".


It all makes sense now...Sphere 3D Announces $10.0 Million Bought Deal Financing... It is expected that $5,000,000
of the Offering will be advanced to Overland Storage, Inc. (Nasdaq-OVRL) ("Overland") by way of an interim 
financing loan (the "Loan"), as required pursuant to the Agreement

Melissa Davis of StreetSweeper: In Bed with Short Sellers and Convicted Felons


When Melissa Davis of TheStreetSweeper.org published an article about RedChip that was as bizarre as it was
inaccurate, RedChip decided to do a little homework on this “financial journalist.”


When she pointed to two stocks that RedChip represented 5 years ago for less than 6 months in an attempt to define
our 18-year history, we thought something might be up. When she failed to mention our stellar track record in
representing some of the top small-cap names in the market, and when she failed to mention any of our current 30
clients and the market-cap and percentage gains they have experienced under the comprehensive RedChip platform,
we knew there had to be a hidden agenda. Approximately 90% of RedChip clients are profitable with strong annual
revenues and earnings growth. Many are listed on the Nasdaq and NYSE: Amex.


When she failed to mention that the only notable critics of the RedChip hybrid research model were she, Herb
Greenberg, and a now-defunct research competitor, we took a closer look at her background and that of her
employer.


Paid by Hedge Fund Shorters to Write Hit Pieces


On February 10, 2011, Ms. Davis published a StreetSweeper article on vaccine developer iBio, Inc. that included the
following disclosure:


Prior to the publication of this article, a third-party investor with whom TheStreetSweeper has a profit-sharing
arrangement effected a “short sale” of 89,715 shares of the stock of iBio, Inc. at $5.31 a share with the intent of
profiting from decreases in the price of such stock. TheStreetSweeper will share in any profits the third-party investor
realizes from the short sale.

The fact that TheStreetSweeper.org was in cahoots with a hedge fund shorting the stock Davis attacked should speak
volumes to investors about the integrity of her reporting and TheStreetSweeper.org’s real purpose. Davis is a paid
hack, not an objective journalist.


Convicted Racketeer Sits on TheStreetSweeper’s Advisory Board


Among other journalistic tactics, Ms. Davis is fond of implying current malfeasance by dredging up prior executive
sins, as in a June 2010 exposé titled “Ecosphere: A Clean Energy Company with a Dirty CEO?” in which she
trumpeted drug convictions that the CEO of Ecosphere Technologies, Inc. incurred more than 20 years ago. Such
actions are hypocritical when you consider that a key member of TheStreetSweeper’s “clean up crew” was convicted
less than a decade ago of racketeering as well as conspiracy to commit securities fraud and money laundering.
Apparently rehabilitation is something that only members of the StreetSweeper team can achieve.


Tabloid Journalism


In today’s digital age, it is entirely possible to produce high-quality journalism armed with only a phone line and an
Internet connection. Indeed, Ms. Davis was honored by the Society of American Business Editors and Writers in 2008
for “Shattered Hopes,” a piece about Johnson & Johnson that she penned for TheStreet.com. We commend her for
this achievement; however, her work for TheStreetSweeper.org falls far below “the highest standards of economic
journalism.” Her pieces are packed with editorializing phrases and loaded words that display obvious bias, her work
reveals little that isn’t already publicly available in SEC filings and press releases, and she draws unsupported left-
field conclusions with the breathlessness of a celebrity tabloid reporter.


Takes Credit Where It Isn’t Due


In her RedChip article, Ms. Davis credits TheStreetSweeper with being the first to caution investors about Imaging3,
Inc., a medical device company that was a RedChip client for less than a year in 2008. IMGG hit an all-time high of
nearly $2 per share in November 2009 before plummeting shortly thereafter. Ms. Davis misguidedly accuses RedChip
of not warning investors about IMGG’s imminent downfall.


Here are the facts: Prior to dropping research coverage of IMGG in January 2009, RedChip downgraded its initial
rating of “Speculative Buy” to a “Hold” and suspended its target price on IMGG stock, citing concerns about the
Company’s lack of visibility, weak balance sheet, and high capital requirements. In other words, RedChip voiced
serious concerns about IMGG nearly a year before the stock “collapsed.”


In contrast, TheStreetSweeper didn’t “sound the alarm” on IMGG until November 2009—more than 11 months after
RedChip.


Overstates Credentials


Prior to joining TheStreetSweeper, Ms. Davis spent two years as a reporter for The Daily Oklahoman (now The
Oklahoman), a newspaper based in Oklahoma City. CNBC commentator Herb Greenberg recommended her for a job
at TheStreet.com because both were researching Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc. at the same time and he came across
her article on the company. Although her StreetSweeper bio touts her seven years of experience as “one of the top
investigative reporters at TheStreet.com,” Ms. Davis recently informed Matt Kantrowitz, RedChip’s Director of Equity
Research, that she was only a freelance contributor to the site, worked out of her Oklahoma City home, and barely

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217483-sphere-3d-cloud-company-cant-rise-above-hype-mistakes-and-poor-management 20/23


met anyone at the company during her time there. Does this sound like the description of a “top” reporter? One would
expect more integrity from someone who works in an industry built upon objectivity and the pursuit of truth.


Low Ratings


TheStreetSweeper does not have much of a following, as its ratings are so low it does not even register as a followed
site on Quantcast.com and ranks poorly at Alexa.com. Certainly, citing an anonymous poster from the Yahoo! Finance
message board as a source does little to enhance one’s journalistic credibility. Nevertheless, everyone loves a good
scandal, and such muckraking journalism carries the potential to drive down a company’s stock price–and has
successfully done so in the past. Such slanted journalism must therefore be exposed.


Unreliable Reporting, Not to be Trusted


We at RedChip applaud the efforts of those who legitimately attempt to uncover stock scams and report them in an
objective manner. As for Ms. Davis, her work is couched in innuendo, inflammatory language, misdirection, and
logical fallacies. Her heavy reliance upon verbal gymnastics and sensationalism calls her motives into question. In our
view, this is one “journalist” whose work just can’t be relied upon.

Reverse Pump-And-Dumper Melissa Davis Targets Zenyatta Written By: James West 
|September 18, 2013 |Posted In: Commentary


Melissa Davis, the “investigative journalist” who worked for TheStreet.com has since left and started a special brand
of muckraking “journalism” that is best characterized as profitable character assassination. The M.O. is simple
enough: Find a company that has built a substantial market cap in a short period of time and publish unsubstantiated
allegations about the company, its product, and its management team on a (possibly duplicitous) financial web portal
with millions of visitors after building a short position in the stock. And VOILA! Instant profit.


Then, when the herd of readers who are already jittery over the fact that their investment has increased by 1,700%
decide to stampede for the exists, buy back the shares on the cheap and pocket the difference.


Its nothing but a reverse pump and dump, and it should be illegal. Everybody understands the power of the written
word. If one person writes something negative, its an opinion. But if two or three agree with the opinion and project it,
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.


Davis’ track record is rather suggestive of the fact that her site, StreetSweeper.org, capitalizes on her past exposure
of flawed companies while investigating on behalf of theStreet.com – projecting herself as a not-for-profit journalist
while actually running a reverse pump and dump operation for profit. The very use of the “.org” Top Level Domain
(TLD), which is supposed to be reserved for non-profit organizations, instead the “.com” TLD is a glaring signal that
she is being intentionally deceptive to the public.


What she doesn’t tell you is that her business partner in the web site and the scheme is a convicted short pump-and-
dumper, Hunter Adams.


In a scathing exposure of such reverse pump and dump web sites , The American Journalism Review suggested in a
lengthy article that StreetSweeper.org was co-founded by a member of the Gambino Crime Family.


“Hunter Adams, the brains behind The Street Sweeper (thestreetsweeper.org), helped launch the site last year
(2009), just eight years after federal prosecutors labeled him an associate of the Gambino crime family in New York.
Adams, who was convicted for his role in a massive “pump and dump” scheme involving penny stocks, is still on
federal probation for his crime.”


“It isn’t journalism,” says Edward Wasserman, Knight Professor of Journalism Ethics at Washington and Lee
University in Lexington, Virginia. “Their claim to be taken seriously as journalists, if they’re making that claim, is
ridiculous.”


“Disclosing that a site is funded by short sales doesn’t remove the ethical questions that surround it,” says Bob Steele,
director of the Janet Prindle Institute for Ethics at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. “It merely provides a
form of transparency that reveals there’s something behind the curtain,” Steele says. “It doesn’t mean that it’s OK.”


SEC Complacent 
The complacency of the U.S. Regulator responsible for the integrity of markets – the Securities Exchange
Commission (SEC) has remained remarkably silent on the issue of reverse pump and dump publishing schemes, and

so right now, the reality is that any stock that has succeeded are going to be subject to such shareholder value-
destorying tactics.


The problem for investors is, if you’re already in the black on a stock you bought for much cheaper, its far safer to sell
and wait out the attack, even though it means handing a profit to a pseudo-criminal enterprise. If you hang on to the
stock in the face of such an attack you risk a) the unpleasant anxiety of hoping the attack is only temporarily
successful in diminishing the share price, or b) losing your profit and then some if market sentiment turns so skeptical
of the attacked stock that it fails to recover, and the downward momentum renders the company unable to raise
further capital.


Before readers jump to the conclusion that I am somehow a paid apologist or pumper for Zenyatta, I hereby disclose
that I own no shares in Zenyatta and am not compensated by the company for coverage. I caveat that disclosure with
the further disclosure that I earn fees for investment banking, financial marketing and the buying and selling of
equities for a living, but have no relationship with Zenyatta in that regard.


Many are the companies whose share prices’ briefly plunged after theStreetSweeper.org’s spurious allegations,
before recovering and then going higher after the allegations proved groundless. Judging by the recovery in
Zenyatta’s share price since Davis’ smear campaign started, she’s going to be on the wrong side of that trade and
must be feeling the squeeze now.
