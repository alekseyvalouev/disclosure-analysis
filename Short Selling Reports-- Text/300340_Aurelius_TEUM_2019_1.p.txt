Summary


We are short Pareteum (NASDAQ: TEUM).  We see massive
downside potential and believe the stock is completely uninvestible.


TEUM’s public claims simply don’t hold up to investigative scrutiny.
For example, TEUM touted a contract with the South Africa based
“Eyethu Mobile Network” as part of a group of deals, purportedly
worth $50 million in aggregate, that TEUM says it signed in the last
two weeks of August 2018. TEUM’s CEO & Chairman, Hal Turner,
took to Twitter to promote Eyethu and declared that TEUM is
“bringing change to South Africans with surprisingly unlimited
cheapest data bundle”.  Although Eyethu’s website is not functional,
Eyethu’s CEO explained on Twitter in 2018; “guys in the midst of
being unemployed, I started my own mobile network operator
company, EMN Telecommunications trading as Eyethu Mobile”.  Our
investigators went to visit Eyethu/EMN’s headquarters but
discovered only a dilapidated shack and crumbling structures near
a rural African village (below).


Documents and detailed forensic evidence presented throughout
this report shows that Eyethu is only the tip of the iceberg of small
or defunct entities across the world that TEUM claims to have
signed valuable contracts with.

7/10/2019 TEUM: Where Are The Customers? - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 3/22


Key �ndings include:


TEUM’s Management Has Extensive Ties to Previous Alleged Frauds
and Failures.


The biographies for Turner and TEUM’s COO fail to disclose their
leadership positions at Catcher Holdings, a now worthless stock that
was owned by a group that included an entity controlled by Barry
Honig, the notorious stock operator charged by the SEC last October
with fraud for alleged pump and dump schemes. We see similarities
between TEUM and the stock promotion at Catcher, where Turner
repeatedly touted Catcher’s technology and growth prospects but
investors ultimately were left with nothing.  TEUM’s CFO was sued by
investors for fraud after he allegedly “personally affected the
fraudulent booking of revenues” as CFO of Audioeye, which later
erased 92% of reported revenues over the relevant period in a
restatement.  TEUM’s former Audit Committee Chair, now a TEUM
executive, was the CFO of TowerStream, another Honig-backed
7/10/2019 TEUM: Where Are The Customers? - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 4/22


company that is now nearly worthless. TEUM’s longtime investor
relations representative was previously sentenced to prison in 2015
and recently disappeared from press releases after being added to a
list of prohibited service providers by OTC markets.


TEUM’s Purported $900 Million Backlog Appears Signi�cantly
Exaggerated or Fictitious.


The foundation of the Pareteum growth story is built on the
company’s supposedly large and fast-growing 36-month backlog,
which management now says exceeds $900 million. But our
investigation identi�ed a variety of purportedly valuable customers
that appear wholly incapable of paying TEUM anywhere near the
large contractual values that TEUM has touted.  Examples include:


A nearly-worthless penny-stock managed by a former
AudioEye executive named alongside TEUM’s CFO in the
fraud suit.


African entities that show no signs of meaningful business
activity.


Contracts with crypto-companies including one that recently
settled with the SEC and “agreed to return funds to harmed
investors”.


Closed or dissolved businesses.


Websites that are inactive or offer limited contact
information.


Businesses that don’t answer the phones or report having
minimal employees.


European entities with tiny amounts of capital or revenue.


Featured customers located in apartment buildings.


Millions in loans to an entity bleeding cash.


A purported $50 million contract with an entity in Thailand
that reports having zero 2018 revenue, years of losses, and
involvement with a crypto-coin that has lost 97% of its peak
value.


We also found irregularities and embellishments involving a
signi�cant portion of the “notable partners and customers” that
7/10/2019 TEUM: Where Are The Customers? - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 5/22


TEUM highlighted in a graphic at its recent analyst day, suggesting
TEUM struggles to �nd enough legitimate new customers to even �ll
a simple slide.


TEUM’s Backlog Conversion and Receivables Signal Serious
Potential Accounting Problems.  


The accounting fraud that TEUM’s CFO allegedly perpetrated at
AudioEye involved the booking of phantom revenues to arti�cially
in�ate the stock price. Bulls have taken comfort in management’s
assurances that TEUM’s backlog has converted to revenue at over
100% of contractual rates thus far. But we �nd TEUM’s backlog
conversion rate highly problematic considering that our research has
�agged so many small or defunct customers. If exaggerated
contractual values are now being recognized as revenue, then we
believe TEUM will face serious accounting problems. TEUM’s
receivables have already begun to balloon after growing at
sequential rates far faster than revenues in each of the last four
quarters. TEUM’s small California auditor, which was speci�cally
cited by the PCAOB for audit de�ciencies related to revenue, gives us
no comfort.


TEUM Has Surrounded Itself with Veterans from Failed Stock
Promotions. 


We discovered a network of actors behind TEUM whose mere
presence should send diligent investors running for hills. TEUM has
paid promoters, used a placement agent, and attracted large
investors that are veterans of numerous previous stock promotions
Honig was an investor in, many of which have since declined to near
worthlessness. We discovered that TEUM’s relationship with Honig’s
longtime securities law �rm, Sichenzia Ross, is so close that the
address that TEUM’s lists on its website as its “USA Headquarters” is
actually Sichenzia’s main o�ce.  TEUM has issued tens of millions in
shares, warrants, and convertible preferred securities in a series of
complex private placements with the assistance of Sichenzia, who is
being sued by a former client for allegedly helping create “ownership
blockers” for Honig’s group as part of an alleged pump and dump
scheme that left that company bankrupt and unable to even validate
7/10/2019 TEUM: Where Are The Customers? - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 6/22


its number of shares outstanding (Sichenzia and Honig deny the
allegations).


The TEUM “Miracle”


Pareteum’s origins trace to a languishing penny stock, Elephant Talk
Communications, that had declining revenues and an audit opinion
that expressed doubt about its ability to operate as a going concern
up until March 2018.  A new management team entered in late 2015,
led by CEO and Chairman Hal Turner, who quickly engineered a
reverse split and a series of private placements and acquisitions to
rebrand the company as Pareteum, a “Global Cloud Communications
Platform”.  TEUM’s business is built on a backend software offering
that primarily targets Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO),
which are essentially marketing businesses that provide wireless
communications to customers by renting bandwidth from large
carriers like T-Mobile or AT&T. The company’s market cap has grown
from $25 million in 2016 to as high as $500 million this year, while
the stock has surged amidst a stream of 238 press releases issued
since the beginning of 2017 that frequently tout the company’s
purported capabilities in buzzword categories such as internet of
things, machine learning, super API, predictive analytics, smart cities,
and blockchain.  Despite a relatively small sales force, reported
revenues have started to grow rapidly and the company now says its
backlog is approaching $1 billion (As compared to trailing revenues
of $50 million), catching the eye of sell side analysts who now model
parabolic growth.


TEUM’s Management Team Has Extensive Ties to Previous Alleged
Frauds and Failures


TEUM’s biographies of Turner and Chief Operating O�cer, Denis
McCarthy, fail to disclose their respective roles as CEO and CFO of
Catcher Holdings, a now worthless stock that was owned by a group
that included an entity controlled by Barry Honig, who was charged
by the SEC last October with fraud for allegedly masterminding a
series of pump and dump schemes. On May 22 , CNBC reported
there is a parallel criminal investigation into Honig’s alleged pump
and dump ring being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s O�ce of San
Francisco.

Catcher had declared itself “a visionary technology leader” with
clients “among the world’s largest private and public companies”.
After joining in early 2007, Turner told investors Catcher “is a great
company” and “will be a greater company through our execution”. But
just weeks after completing an acquisition in December 2007, Turner
suddenly left Catcher which quickly collapsed in April 2008 due to
“insu�ciency of working capital”.  Turner resurfaced with McCarthy
and TEUM’s now-CCO, Vic Bozzo, at Pac-West Telecom, but left in
2011 and that company later �led bankruptcy in 2013.


We also learned that TEUM’s CFO, Edward “Ted” O’Donnell, was sued
by Audioeye investors for fraud after he allegedly “personally
affected the fraudulent booking of revenues” that triggered a
restatement erasing 92% of the company’s reported revenue over the
relevant period. The lawsuit alleged that the fraud was designed to
“give the market the false notion that revenue growth was
accelerating” and “arti�cially in�ate AudioEye’s stock price”
(O’Donnell denied the allegations and the lawsuit appears to have
been settled). O’Donnell resigned from AudioEye in March 2015 and
joined TEUM in January 2017.

While Chairing TEUM’s Audit Committee, Laura Thomas was also the
CFO of TowerStream, a nearly worthless equity owned by Honig. 
Thomas moved from the TEUM Board to an executive role at TEUM
in December 2018 and resigned from TowerStream in January 2018.


TEUM’s longtime investor relations representative was Stephan Hart
(aka Steven or Stephen Hart) who disappeared from TEUM press
releases earlier this year after being added to the list of prohibited
service providers by OTC markets. Hart was representing TEUM
even though he was sentenced to prison in August 2015 for
obstruction of justice and perjury following charges by the SEC for
“illegal trading schemes” in December 2012.

customers TEUM claims to have signed valuable contracts with. 
Turner has declared that “we’re on �re with relentless forward motion”
and “highly successful in driving sales, lots and lots of contracts”. 
Turner has also explained the stated backlog means the “revenue
value over the next 36 months, sitting there in contracts, awaiting
implementation and deployment and that’s based upon the
customer’s contractually executed schedules”. The Sell Side has
relied on these statements to hail TEUM’s reported backlog growth
as “stunning” and consensus analyst expectations now project
TEUM’s sales growing from $32 million in 2018 to more than $175
million in 2020.


Doubts about the legitimacy of TEUM’s claims began to surface in
March, when a blog post raised questions about the validity of
several customers that were named by TEUM in press releases. Our
own investigation �agged a variety of customers TEUM has hyped
that appear completely incapable of producing anywhere near the
material amounts of revenue that TEUM has suggested or implied.


For example, in October 2018 TEUM touted a contract with Naledi
Telecom, who TEUM claimed was launching as the �rst MVNO in
Lesotho, Africa, and one of three multi-million contracts purportedly
totaling $15 million in aggregate over three years.  Although Naledi’s
website is not functional, Lesotho corporate records we obtained
show that an entity using the trade name Naledi Telecom was
formed in May 2018 with less than “1000” in share capital by a
Zimbabwe national. Our investigators visited Naledi’s registered
address but found Naledi wasn’t even listed in the building’s
directory and the investigators found no activity at its supposed
o�ce number (below). The building manager told our investigators
the o�ce’s tenant had moved out and our investigators were directed
to a different location in the area.  They didn’t �nd Naledi at that
address either, but instead the operations of a Lesotho newspaper
business, where the individual who created Naledi informed them
that Naledi is not operational, claiming it will launch at an
unspeci�ed later date.

Parallax Health Science was named by TEUM in the exact same
press release as a multi-million contract and TEUM’s “�rst customer
in the healthcare IT industry”.  But Parallax is a nearly-worthless
penny-stock with negligible assets that recorded a mere $11
thousand in revenues last year.  Currently and at the time of TEUM’s
press release, Parallax’s own SEC �lings stated there is “substantial
doubt about the company’s ability to operate as a going concern”. So
how could Parallax possibly contribute millions in revenues for
TEUM? Farcically, we learned that Parallax’s executives include
O’Donnell’s former associates at AudioEye, including AudioEye’s
former CEO who was a named defendant alongside O’Donnell in the
alleged fraud.  One Central, the third company mentioned in the
same press release, at least appears to have active operations.
However, a balance sheet it �led in the Netherlands reported just
€662k in equity and 7 employees.

TEUM claims that a Thai company named One Development
purportedly signed an individual three-year $50 million contract, one
of the largest single deals that TEUM as ever announced. But we
obtained �nancial statements that One Development �led in Thailand
which report no revenue in 2018, operating losses for each of the
three years presented, and total assets of just 9.3 million BHT,
translating to just a mere $298k US. Our investigators couldn’t �nd
an o�ce for One Development at the address listed on the
company’s LinkedIn page, and a person who answered One
Development’s phone number refused to provide an address or the
founder’s contact information to our investigators.  One
Development’s presentation materials explain that its business plan
is to entice MVNOs to launch in Thailand and then sell them
services.  But even though the business was founded in 2013, One
Development doesn’t appear to have gained much traction. Its
founder has been operating a parallel MVNO consulting business,
Yozzo, that reported a mere 18BHT in revenue last year (about 57
cents US). The only deal we’ve seen announced is a December 2018
partnership between One Development and a crypto-company
named Electroneum to bring a crypto-app to MVNOs. However, the
underlying coin has now lost more than 97% of its peak value.   Once
again, we question how this contract could possibly contribute
anywhere near $50 million for TEUM?

Since the crypto-boom of late 2017, TEUM has repeatedly hyped
contracts tied to crypto-businesses, including a “Blockchain
Technology Partnership” with Airfox, a crypto company that TEUM
named in at least 8 press releases. But we learned that Airfox settled
charges with the SEC in November 2018 related to registration
violations involving its sale of “AirTokens” and “agreed to return
funds to harmed investors”.


Turner told investors the Airfox Blockchain deal “bodes well” for
Pareteum’s “fundamental revenue growth and pro�tability” in a
January 2018 press release (above left).  But when the SEC
questioned TEUM about its blockchain business in an October 2018
comment letter (below), the company admitted to the SEC that
“Airfox has not deployed any mobile-phone related services” and  “we
have not and do not plan in the near future to generate any revenue
from our relationship with Airfox”.  Even though we can no longer
�nd the Blockchain whitepaper TEUM previously announced it had
published on its website, management continues to hype blockchain
and announced in April a purported $22 million contract with an
unnamed “Digital Currency Wi-Fi provider”.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 13/22


Yes, Pareteum has some “real” customers.  Elephant Talk had
declining revenues and legacy contracts with a few large customers
such as Vodaphone Spain. TEUM completed an October 2018
acquisition of Artillium, which added some European customers but
only $11 million in trailing twelve-month revenues.  Then TEUM
parlayed its surging stock price to complete a February 2019 all-
stock acquisition of iPass, which had contracts with various large
companies but declining revenues.   Yet we found TEUM still needed
to use a series of embellishments and small or seemingly inactive
customers just to round out a graphic included in a slide of  “Notable
Pareteum Partners and Customers” for its May 28th analyst day
presentation (page 21). If TEUM is unable to display a simple slide of
customers without resorting to these kinds of exaggerations, how
could the true backlog and customer base possibly be even close to
as robust as management claims it is? Our observations on the
companies circled below in red include:

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 14/22


The least of the problems is the double counting and self-
counting that populates this graphic. Comically, TEUM
includes logos of its own subsidiaries as if they were key
partners or customers. *bliep, United Telecom, Ello Mobile,
and Speak Up are Artillium companies speci�cally named in
an SEC �ling made by TEUM as part of that transaction.
TEUM included the logos for both Vodaphone and Lowi.es,
which is simply Vodaphone’s Spanish telecom business.
Similarly, Belgacom is the former name and same company
as Proximus, which lists scarlet as an a�liated brand in
public �lings.


TEUM features the logo of Sol Mobile even though
documents show the company was legally dissolved in in
August 2017. TEUM �rst announced the UK-based Sol Mobile
as its �rst MVNO customer back in December of 2016 and on
the May 2017 earnings call, Turner told investors that “names
that we’ve announced such as Sol Mobile and Pronto which
are now beginning to come online”. It’s unclear if Sol, which
was founded in 2015 and registered a co-working center in
Dartford, progressed much beyond a startup.


TEUM has repeatedly touted Pronto Telecommunications as
a customer and features its logo in presentations. But
Pronto’s founder and CEO is a real estate broker in
Pittsburgh,  Pronto’s website contains a prominent mis-
spelling, offers no contact phone number, and lists the

TEUM also features the logo of UK-based Bellingham
Telecommunications. Yet a balance sheet that Bellingham
�led with the UK companies house in 2018 reported a mere
£282k in total assets exceeded by £415k in liabilities. The
address displayed on Bellingham’s website matches that of a
Bridgestreet rental apartment and Bellingham’s Linkedin
reports only one employee. Multiple calls to the phone
number on Bellingham’s website went unanswered.


TEUM also inserted the logo of a company named Apeiron
into its analyst day presentation, but the company’s website
is no longer active. Apeiron still lists 14 employees on
Linkedin and the address of a small o�ce located in Bedford,
Texas.

The presentation lists three European companies IP Nexia,
Tellink, and ACN that appear to have actual operations but
�nancials these companies �led indicate they are relatively
small.  Tellink lost €239k last year on €1 million in revenue, IP
Nexia lost €3 Million on declining revenues of €4.9 Million
Euro, and ACN made £57k on declining revenues of £4.4
million.


The presentation includes Eroski Movil, which was the MVNO
business of a European supermarket chain that appears to
have been an Elephant Talk customer. But Eroski announced
its withdrawal from the mobile telephony business last year
and stated, as translated by Google, that it will “cease to
operate in the mobile telephony market and will cede its
position as a service provider”. Eroski’s mobile website,
which used the same logo that TEUM featured in its analyst
day presentation, has since been deleted.


Previous TEUM investor pitchbooks have featured the logo of
Exactta Communications, which says on its website that it
distributes prepaid phone cards at four airports. But online searches
reveal a series of customer complaints, Exactta’s Facebook page has
gone dormant since 2017, and its website’s “Employees” webpage

says it’s “under construction”.   Multiple calls to Exactta’s US phone
number listed on its website went unanswered.


In October 2018, TEUM named Global Connect as one �ve
companies that signed contracts totaling $11 million and 800,000
connections. TEUM described Global Connect as “a communication
services internet of things company with multinational clients focused
on home automated solutions”. Yet a 2018 Balance Sheet that Global
Connect �led in the UK lists only £74k in assets, the entity is
registered to an accountant’s o�ce, and we could �nd only one
employee on Linkedin.  A counter embedded at the bottom of the
website listed less than 500 visitors.  A second company mentioned
in the same press release, WorldSim, appears to have some
operations but reported only £264k in assets in its UK �ling,
indicating it is another small business.


Yonder Media Mobile, which we are told was suggested to be a
customer at TEUM’s analyst day, received a series of loans totaling
$3.2 million from TEUM starting last year, according to SEC �lings. 
Yonder’s CEO received signi�cant publicity in 2012 after Yonder’s
predecessor company declared bankruptcy “taking more than $33
million worth of investors money with it. It never released a product”
(see here, here).  We found Yonder’s operating report dated May 15,
2019 posted online which articulates various grandiose plans Yonder
has to acquire MVNOs and complete a music app.  But,
unsurprisingly, the document states the company is burning cash
which was projected to dwindle to $700k at the end of May and was
seeking large investments from a variety of overseas investors.

TEUM’s Backlog Conversion and Receivables Signal Serious
Potential Accounting Problems 


The accounting fraud that TEUM’s CFO allegedly perpetrated at
AudioEye involved the booking of phantom revenues to arti�cially
in�ate the company’s stock price.  Is it possible that this exact kind
of scheme is now occurring at TEUM?


Bulls have taken comfort in management’s assurances that backlog
has converted to revenue at over 100% of contractual rates thus far. 
Backlog turning into actual revenue, the thinking seems to go, is a
sign that TEUM’s new contract wins must be high quality in nature.
Conversely, we �nd TEUM’s backlog conversion rate highly
problematic considering that our research has �agged customers
that are small, defunct, or seem unlikely to be able to pay TEUM
anywhere near the large contractual values that TEUM has touted. If
these kinds of exaggerated contracts are now being recognized as
revenue, as management’s commentary indicates, then we believe
TEUM will face serious accounting problems.


This is exactly why we’re troubled that TEUM’s receivables have
grown at sequential rates far faster than revenues in each of the last
four quarters. For example, revenues grew 64% to $23M in Q1 2019
from $14M in Q4 2018 but receivables ballooned 86% to $28M from
$15M over the same period.  This is puzzling because TEUM’s own
SEC �lings state that “the company typically bills its customers at the
end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter”,
which we believe should naturally result in relatively minimal
receivables. But TEUM’s Days Sales Outstanding has reached 110
days as compared 39 days of Twilio (TWLO), a company that

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 19/22


promoters like to compare TEUM to, suggesting that TEUM’s
customers may already be falling behind on their bills.


TEUM’s small California auditor, Squar Milner, gives us no additional
comfort.  Squar has audited at least one company owned by Barry
Honig, True Drinks Holdings (TRUU), an equity that is now virtually
worthless. More importantly, the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) uncovered signi�cant de�ciencies in its
most recent inspection of Squar in 2017.  The PCAOB stated in its
report that “in other words, in these audits, the auditor [Squar] issued
an opinion without satisfying its fundamental obligation to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the �nancial statements were
free of material misstatement”.  The PCAOB even identi�ed two
signi�cant de�ciencies in a Squar audit speci�cally related to the
valuation of revenue:


TEUM Has Surrounded Itself with Veterans from Failed Stock
Promotions 


While Honig is not named as a TEUM investor, we uncovered a series
of relationships that make it hard for us to rule out the possibility
that his invisible hand could be at work.  At absolute minimum, it’s
clear to us that TEUM is backed by a seasoned crowd of veterans
from dubious stock promotions:


TEUM is represented by Sichenzia Ross, the securities law
�rm of record for at least 22 companies that Honig and/or

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/teum-where-are-the-customers/ 20/22


John Stetson, an alleged member of the pump and dump
ring, have invested in since 2009. Bizarrely, the relationship
between TEUM and Sichenzia is so close that the address
TEUM’s lists on its website as its “USA Headquarters” is
actually Sichenzia’s Main O�ce. A 2017 Sichenzia press
release states that Sichenzia has a long-term lease for the
entire 37  �oor that Pareteum currently lists as its address.


TEUM has issued tens of millions in shares, warrants, and
convertible preferred securities in a series of complex private
placements that Sichenzia has assisted with. We note that
Sichenzia and Honig are separately being sued for fraud by a
former Sichenzia client, Mabvax Therapeutics, which is now a
virtually worthless penny stock that the SEC says was the
scene of a Honig-led pump and dump (“Company C” in the
SEC’s complaint against Honig).  Mabvax alleges that
Sichenzia collaborated with Honig’s group to structure
private placements as “ownership blockers” that left
Mabvax unable to validate how many shares it has
outstanding.  Sichenzia and Honig deny the allegations.

TEUM uses the same placement agent as Mabvax did, a
Boca Raton broker named Dawson James Securities that
also now issues favorable research reports on TEUM.
According to our analysis, Dawson James has been engaged
by 13 different companies that have been owned by Honig,
most of which have declined more than 75% from their peak
value and/or are now virtually worthless.


While we are unable to identify all of TEUM’s private
placement investors, two �rms that have regularly invested
alongside Honig, Iroquois Capital and IntraCoastal Capital,
owned or controlled 13.2% of TEUM’s outstanding shares as
of March 2018, according to an SEC �ling. By our count,
Iroquois and/or Intracoastal have collectively invested in a
total of 34 publicly traded companies that were also owned
by Honig, most of which have either declined more than 75%
from their peak value or are now virtually worthless.  A
February 2019 SEC �ling reported that Iroquois Capital has
already dumped their entire TEUM stake. We note that
Iroquois reportedly received an SEC subpoena as part of the
investigation into Honig’s alleged pump and dump ring but
was not named in the SEC complaint or been accused of
wrongdoing.


TEUM has paid stock promoters from Red Chip companies,
which has previously touted numerous now worthless
companies backed by Honig. RedChip’s founder has praised
Honig and was quoted in a 2013 interview stating that
“learning from him and working with him has been incredible”.


Just in isolation, we believe the mere presence of this collection of
actors should send diligent investors running for hills. 


In our opinion TEUM’s stock is completely uninvestible and we
therefore see massive downside potential.


All Investors Are Encouraged to Conduct Their Own Due Diligence Into
These Factors
