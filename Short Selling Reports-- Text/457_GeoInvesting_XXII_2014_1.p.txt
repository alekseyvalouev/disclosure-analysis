22nd Century Group (XXII)
– A Lot Of Smoke, Not
Enough Fire
August 27, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary


A number of factors lead us to the conclusion that
22nd Century Group (XXII) is severely overvalued and
likely worth no more than $0.20 per share.
In the past, the SEC charged XXII CEO Joseph
Pandolfino, Jr. for stock manipulation of two stocks.
Insiders have enjoyed exorbitant wealth at the
expense of shareholders.
This company is no stranger to massive dilution, and
we believe more is on the way.
Project abandonment, failed repackaged ventures,
absence of sales and advertising, fluff press releases
and a huge accumulated deficit translate into a bleak
future for XXII.


22nd Century Group, Inc. (NYSEMKT:XXII) became public
on January 25th, 2011 through a reverse merger with shell
company Touchstone Mining Limited (source 21).


We believe investors will come to the same conclusion that
we have-XXII is just rekindling a story that already has
failed in the past. From 2011 to the beginning of 2014, the
stock was trading well below where it’s trading today,
spending the past couple years trading as low as $0.20, or
what we believe the fair value of this stock to be.

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 2/36


However, shares of XXII have been propelled by whispers
of the company being the “next big thing” in the tobacco
marketspace – and even in the marijuana space. The
company’s stock, after spiking violently in early 2014 to
over $5.00 (we believe solely as a result of stock
promotion and uplisting), has now settled at around $3.20.


In 2011, the company touted the potential of its X-22
product as its future growth driver. We feel that investors
should note initial FDA trials of X-22 failed and that per
XXII’s 2013 10-K filing, the company admitted that it
would be suspending its X-22 FDA clinical trials. They claim
to be looking for a partner to sponsor new trials, but the
company has admitted they won’t be sponsoring new trials
for the product. Instead, the company has offloaded X-22
to Hercules Pharmaceuticals, LLC, who is tasked with trying
to find someone to sponsor new FDA trials. What it seems
like to us is that the company doesn’t want to pour any
more money into X-22. So, why should investors?


The company attempts to build legitimacy by disclosing an
arrangement where it has licensed X-22 to a third party,
Hercules Pharmaceuticals, LLC. However, Hercules is
just a subsidiary of XXII. Regardless, the company now
wants investors to focus attention to new product
endeavors, but it has seemingly not met milestones related
to continuing to license certain cigarette cessation
technology. This seems to have been XXII’s M.O. through
its history-which has been riddled with false promise and
failed product launches.


The stock trades at a market cap near $190M, yet the
company has run up an accumulated deficit of roughly
$47.21M and has reported revenue of just $16,114 during
its most recent quarter ended June 30, 2014. So, what has
management done in response to this dismal performance?
They have quadrupled the stock’s share count to roughly

59 million and paid themselves hundreds of thousands of
dollars in total compensation per annum.


Not only that, but more dilution appears to be right around
the corner since the company shows in its Q2 2014 filing
that its cash on hand is only sufficient to fund operations
for the next 3 to 4 quarters.


The short thesis behind this company isn’t some complex
speculative thesis that is going to be difficult to
understand. In this piece, we’re simply going to show that:


Insiders are paying themselves exorbitant amounts of
money from the shareholder’s pockets, despite the
fact that the company has run up an accumulated
deficit of roughly $47.21 million;
Dilution has caused the company’s share count to
nearly quadruple, and we see no signs that the
dilution will not continue to be a staple of
management’s strategy;
We believe the company has ties to stock
manipulation and promotion;
the company has a small dissipating pile of cash;
Based on the company’s unsuccessful attempts to
meaningfully monetize a product, we have little
confidence that they can do so in the future;
The Company has a history of abandoning projects;
The Company has repackaged a business plan that
has failed in the past;
A Large tobacco company spent $25M on advertising
for Quest branded modified nicotine cigarettes before
giving up on the product;
The Company has admitted it’s suspending funding its
X-22 FDA clinical trials, necessary to move further in
monetizing the product;

The Company’s paltry revenue from this past quarter
came from $16k in filtered cigars;
The CEO has a history of stock manipulation – the
SEC charged CEO Pandolfino with manipulating the
prices of two stocks by mailing anonymous letters
with false information;
The company has known associates that are tied to
stock promotion;
The bull’s argument of XXII’s own brand of standard
cigarettes, which are supposedly set for national
distribution at some point in the future have been
trumpeted by the company since 2011 with no sales
and no advertising spending to date;
The company has issued press releases dating back to
2011 touting potential “big things” which still haven’t
panned out or that they’ve stopped talking about
without major explanation.


Life has been good at 22  Century Group


Right off the bat, looking at XXII’s insider transaction
record from the last two years, it’s clear that the officers,
directors, and beneficial owners haven’t been doing too
badly for themselves, even though the company has made
little operational gains. From March 26th, 2013, to
December 10th, 2013, the company’s insider trading
record shows 35 instances of selling stock and just 1
purchase. The proceeds from the sales combined equaled
$447,515. Since December 10th, 2013, we’ve seen option
exercises and sales totaling $611,300 (source 40).


In addition to that, the 2013 proxy statement (source 41)
notes that CEO Pandolfino drew a total salary (cash +
bonus + stock awards + all other compensation) of
$687,969 in 2013 and $476,109 in 2012. Other C level
executives are also enjoying lofty six figure salaries that
the shareholders are paying for.

Directors James Cornell and Joseph Dunn also received
$15,000 in cash compensation.


In our report, we’ll show that promotional agencies,
consultants, and those providing services to the company
have also been doing quite well at the cost of common
share dilution.


The shareholders are paying for everything this company
does to operate.


The company’s recent listing on the NYSE MKT in March
2014 and subsequent addition to the Russell 2000 index at
the end of June 2014 have increased the amount of eyes
on this small company from Clarence, NY. Through this
increased liquidity, 22nd Century Group has found
themselves sporting a market cap near $167M, despite
what we believe to be numerous red flags, not the least of
which is that the company isn’t making any money and has
posted net losses every year since it has been a public
company.


XXII is a non-profitable, 9 employee entity that
manufactures SPECTRUM reduced nicotine cigarettes for
government researchers. There is a chance that the
company’s sole source of paltry revenue (the government)
could terminate if North Carolina State University cancels
its agreement with XXII, of which the company is
technically in default. There is also no guarantee of future
orders in this realm, as it is dependent on demand, which
seemed to dry up judging by the zero orders in all of 2013
and only one small order in 2014.


The company also aims to eventually be a producer of
consumer brand cigarettes, and it has two lines for doing
so: RED SUN and MAGIC regular and menthol additive free

cigarettes. The company has been “aiming” for major retail
cigarette distribution for years. What they really appear to
be doing, in essence, is simply just selling shares to pay
themselves.


The company also has genetically modified nicotine content
cigarettes-a business that’s still in development. Further,
the company has been touted a couple of times as having a
niche for the marijuana craze. Like many marijuana touted
stocks, however, we believe this thesis to be all smoke and
no fire.


The company began its public stages with a product called
X-22, which it touted up until 2011. When the product
failed a clinical trial to end 2011, investors stopped hearing
much about it. We believe that much of the hype around X-
22 is what allowed XXII to perform its reverse merger and
bring on private placements to fund the business thus far.


X-22 does, however appear on the company’s archaic
website, which on the front page also boasts biographies of
Albert Einstein and Christopher Columbus, among others.
We’re going to go out on a limb and suggest this company
is going to be slightly less revolutionary than the likes of
Columbus and Einstein.


We believe that this company is slated for long-term
declines and has little to no chance of pulling its act
together.

Joseph Pandolfino, Jr. is the Chairman and CEO of the
company. He’s the largest owner of stock, holding 6 million
shares (roughly a 10% stake in the company).


On April 6, 1992, Pandolfino incorporated Tobacco
Alternative Inc., a marketer of herbal cigarettes and the
predecessor to XXII. At the time of Tobacco Alternative’s
founding, Pandolfino was a graduate student at SUNY
Buffalo and already the subject of an SEC case regarding a
fraudulent stock promotion he orchestrated in April, 1991.


The SEC charged Pandolfino with manipulating the prices of
two stocks by mailing anonymous letters with false
information. The case was settled with Pandolfino neither
admitting nor denying the charges and accepting a fine
equal to the amount he profited in the scheme. He also
agreed to refrain from such activities in the future. This
was sourced from the SEC News Digest from 1992.


You can read the electronic copy of this document, still
available at the SEC’s website, listed as (source 2):


From there, Mr. Pandolfino went on to “Tobacco Alternative,
Inc.” We believe Pandolfino has been peddling the “Tobacco
Alternative” concept since 1994. We have obtained what
appears to be a mailer for “Tobacco Alternative, Inc.” from
around the same time period:

(source: Google Maps)


After this time, Pandolfino had changed the name of
“Tobacco Alternative” to “Alternative Cigarettes, Inc.” and
partnered with Smokin’ Joe’s, a Tuscarora Indian Nation-
based cigarette manufacturer and retail shop north of
Buffalo. From the partnership, Pandolfino sought domestic
production and distribution of his products.


Smokin’ Joe’s was, and is, owned by Joseph Anderson, a
longtime partner of Pandolfino’s. Anderson and his
controller at this time, Richard Saffire (source 3), owned
over 10% of XXII at the time it went public in 2011. Saffire
still owns 2.6M shares, or 4.4%, and additional warrants.
His family owns Milhem Attea & Bros (source 19), which
has historically been the largest distributor of cigarettes to
Indian tribes in New York State. (Sometimes the company
is called Attea Milhem & Bros.)


Saffire had a controlling interest in two cigarette
companies, Windward Tobacco and Sovereign Tobacco.
Windward ceased operations in 2006 after being sued by
the State of New York for failure to collect taxes on
cigarettes sold on Indian reservations (Milhem Attea was
the primary defendant in the case). Sovereign Tobacco was
sold in 2009 to the Oneida Indian tribe in New York for
$6.6M (source 20).


Joseph Anderson is a leader on the Tuscarora Indian
Reservation in Niagara County, New York, about 10 miles
north of Buffalo. In addition to owning Smokin’ Joe’s, he
has interests in a number of local businesses (source 4).


During the mid-1990s, Anderson and Milhem Attea & Bros
were the distributor and supplier, respectively, to a
cigarette smuggling ring that sold untaxed cigarettes in
Canada (source 5).

In 2004, Anderson pled guilty to bribing the mayor of
Niagara Falls for favorable treatment related to a real
estate development project (source 6).


XXII’s Prior Attempt to Monetize
its Cigarette “Technology” is a $25
Million Disaster


A key to XXII’s bull story is technology that allows it to
genetically alter the nicotine content in cigarettes. On July
14th, 1997, XXII’s predecessor company, Alternative
Cigarettes, obtained an exclusive license to such
technology from North Carolina State University (“NCSU”).
Indeed, 22nd Century Limited LLC was formed as a
separate entity in 1998 to be the umbrella for modified
nicotine products going forward. Through 2001, cumulative
payments totaling $377K were made for the exclusive
license and research work done by NCSU.


XXII did not have the resources to develop this product
internally (source 7). In 1999 they sublicensed the
technology to the large tobacco company Vector Group
(NYSE:VGR) which planned to develop a new low nicotine
brand called Quest. Vector went on to spend over $25M on
advertising alone for Quest branded modified nicotine
cigarettes before giving up on the product.


Vector started production and marketing of Quest in
January 2003 and also began the FDA approval process to
market the cigarettes as a smoking cessation product.
However, initial sales of $26M in 2003 quickly fell to $14M
by 2004 and just $10M by 2005. With the FDA still
withholding approval, Vector decided in 2006 to end the
application process with the FDA and cease further
development of Quest as a smoking cessation product.

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 10/36


Vector kept Quest on the market for a few more years, but
consumers didn’t like the product. One review said,
“They’ve almost genetically altered the tobacco to turn it
into the taste of the lettuce leaf cigarettes. BAD.” In 2009,
Vector finally ceased production of Quest altogether, with
XXII retaining the NCSU license to the technology.


Following Quest’s failure, XXII began work on its own
modified nicotine products. The first, X-22, was intended to
be a smoking cessation product for which XXII planned to
seek FDA approval, despite Vector’s failure. Yet at the end
of 2011, XXII’s Phase IIB trial showed that X-22 did not
help people quit smoking.


After that, XXII refocused its pitch on two retail-branded
cigarettes with modified nicotine levels: Brand A (very low
nicotine content) and Brand B (higher nicotine content than
other “light” or low tar cigarettes). XXII intends to seek
FDA approval to market these products as “modified risk”
tobacco products.


The original license agreement with NCSU was amended in
August, 2012 to give XXII more time to meet milestones
with regards to FDA Phase III trials and commercialization.
The amendment called for XXII to initiate Phase III trials
by the end of 2013, submit an FDA application based on
trial data by the end of 2014, and launch commercial
products in 2015. The first milestone was not met and no
further announcements have been made regarding the
status of this licensing agreement.

$260K.
In January 2012, they paid ProActive Capital 25K
shares for investor relations services. (See below for
more on ProActive.) (source 38)

common stock and 1.7M warrants for $809.5K, or
$0.25 per unit. XXII only received $681K in cash,
however while the rest was exchanged for a reduction
in accounts payable and directors’ fees owed. The
warrants had a strike price of $1.00. (source 1)
In January 2013, Chardan again acted as the
placement agent on a $2.12M net offering, receiving a

Ties to Questionable Analysts,
Promoters and Convictions of Bank
Fraud


Crede is a partnership controlled by veteran stock
promoters Terren Peizer and Michael Wachs. Peizer has a
long and sordid history, including for example, Hythiam
Inc’s failed Prometa addiction treatment miracle program
and Hollis-Eden Pharmaceutical’s failed miracle AIDS cure
Immunitin (source 39). Wachs pled guilty to bank fraud in
1997, spent 11 months in federal prison and agreed to be
barred from the brokerage business (source 22). Wachs
has for many years run CEOCAST, an investor relations and
stock promotion company (source 23). CEOCAST acted as
a paid promoter of XXII back in late 2011, where one of its
letters confirmed that XXII was paying them “fifteen
thousand dollars per month in cash and stock” (source 45).

5/23/2018 22nd Century Group (XXII) - A Lot Of Smoke, Not Enough Fire | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 14/36


In June 2013, it would seem that the big stock promotion
began. After sliding from January’s peak of $1.00 to $0.60
at the end of May, there was suddenly an explosion in
trading volume and price beginning on June 7th. 4.8M
shares traded that day, 10 times the previous peak trading
day back on November 26, 2012.


XXII put out a press release on the following Monday, June
10th, with a corporate update on multiple fronts,
highlighting a potential business collaboration with an
unnamed US Tobacco company (this turned out to be
NASCO Products, see below) and projecting expanded
distribution of MAGIC and RED SUN branded cigarettes in
the second half of 2013 (which did not occur) (source 25).


The stock was up 60% by August.


In August and November, the company instituted warrant
exchange programs where the exercise price of several
series of warrants was lowered to induce cash exercise. In
total during 2013, 15M warrants were exercised. (While
12M warrants were issued during the year.)


In December, Chardan was paid $320K and issued
another 300K shares of common stock for
“professional services.”


Less than three weeks later, on January 10, 2014, Chardan
initiated research coverage on XXII with a “Buy” rating and
$9 price target, with shares then trading at $2. They
reiterated this rating and price target on March 6th and
July 15th .


Chardan Capital makes up 3 of the 4 analyst reports listed
on the company’s website. The other is Rodman & Renshaw

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 15/36


(see ProActive above) (source 24):


Rodman & Renshaw found themselves short of capital in
2012, and their parent company’s name change to Direct
Markets Holdings Corp. (source 42) did little to prevent
their stock from eventually trading under a penny on the
OTC.


In 2013, they filed for bankruptcy, listing $1M in assets and
$10.6M in liabilities (source 43).


By mid-March, XXII shares hit $6.20, up 1000% since the
June promotion started. XXII had a market value of
$400M.


Promotions Have Been Inherent in
XXII Since the Beginning


XXII has bought and paid for a very suspect group of stock
promoters who have been active in the stock since the
reverse merger.


The first paid stock promotion began in June of 2011.
Proactive Capital/Quality$tocks (“Proactive”) announced
XXII as a new client and shared a copy of Rodman &
Renshaw’s analyst report. This was followed up by another
post on June 30th that pointed back to the same Rodman
report (source 9). Proactive received 25K shares of XXII in
January, 2012 for investor relations services.


Proactive Capital’s promotional techniques have recently
been the subject of a damning expose from Richard
Pearson of MoxReports.com (source 10).

CEOCAST was first mentioned XXII in October 2011. The
company subsequently appeared in the November and
December editions. CEOCAST was compensated with $15K
per month in cash and stock for three months in 2011.
(source 30)


Chardan Capital Markets (“Chardan”) is the investment
bank that acted as the placement agent for XXII’s May
2012 and August 2013 preferred stock offerings and as the
financial advisor for the warrant exchange program in the
4th quarter of 2013. It was founded in 2003 by Kerry
Propper as an offshoot from his father’s firm, Chardan
Capital. Kerry’s father, Dr. Richard Propper, has a long
history of securities law abuses (source 46). Father and
son have been involved together in multiple dubious
Chinese reverse mergers (eg., A-Power Energy and Fuqi
International) and in 2010, along with Rodman & Renshaw,
were behind the disastrous public offering of DJSP
Enterprises Inc. which began trading at $9 and was under
$0.50 by the end of 2010 amidst claims of improprieties.
(source 31) You can see more of Chardan’s horrendous
Chinese reverse merger track record here. We have also
written about Chardan being questionable as well, which
you can read here.


In 2006, Richard Propper was charged by the US Justice
Department of defrauding the Small Business
Administration of $32M. His partner in this illegal venture,
John Torkelsen, pled guilty and was sentenced to seven
years in prison. Richard Propper eventually settled by
paying a $1.5M fine. Kerry Propper was also a party to this
case, and settled for $36K (sources 13-16).


Rodman and Renshaw, meanwhile, saw its parent company
eventually file for bankruptcy.


Scott P. Shaffer is a blogger based out of Boca Raton,
Florida who first mentioned XXII in the inaugural issue of

was also posted on Seeking Alpha (source 17). XXII was
covered in the February, May, June, August 2013 and
January, March 2014 editions of the newsletter. Shaffer’s
FINRA record indicates that he worked at a succession of
bucket shops (Sterling Financial, D. Blech and Co. to name
a few) before taking off on his own as an independent
investor and newsletter/blog writer. Shaffer states that he
is not paid by the companies he covers but may take
positions in companies he is covering prior to publication.
In 2007, Shaffer was promoting CSMG Technologies Inc
(CTGI- delisted) with the same statement, however SEC
records show that he had received 200K options to
purchase shares from the company for “services rendered.”

The Company Has a Cash Position
that Is Going to Necessitate Even
More Dilution Soon


The company filed its most recent 10-Q on August 14,
2014, where it disclosed that it has $4,172,795 cash on
hand, which equates to roughly enough to last for another
3 quarters. The company is going to be forced to do an
offering soon and has filed a $45M shelf registration which
was declared effective by the SEC in June of 2014 (source

growing. The company has gone from a $1.3 million loss in
2011 to a massive $26.1 million loss in 2013. The company
has posted a $7.2 million net loss for 2014 thus far, as
well.


The company’s cash position has relied heavily on the
company’s ability to perform private placements, as you
can see in the above-listed share count. The share count
has more than doubled since 2011. Keeping the same
market cap, $5 share in 2011 would be worth less than a
mere $2.50 in today’s environment.


For the second quarter of 2014, the company posted
revenue of $16,144, and a net loss of $1.965M. The
company had an updated share count of 58,749,240 and
cash on hand of $4,172,795. Here’s how those numbers
have fared in the past couple of years.

(source: XXII filings)


That whopping $16,114 in revenue the company posted
just this past quarter? That came from the selling of
filtered cigars, as per the company’s 10-Q:


We’re not really sure where cigars fit into the company’s
business plan, this is the first we’ve heard of it. The word
“cigar” doesn’t appear in the company’s 2013 10-K.


Excluding a one-time license payment in Q4 2013 and as of
Q1 2014, the company has generated merely $2.5M in
unprofitable revenue over the past 5 years from contract
manufacturing research cigarettes, with no contracts in
place for future sales. The research cigarettes are produced
with technology licensed from North Carolina State
University, and XXII is technically in default of this
licensing agreement which means patent rights can revert
to NCSU at any time, barring further amendments to the
agreement. The two do seem to continue to have a
working relationship as NCSU is brought up in their 10-K a
couple a times for 2013), but we believe them to be in
default based on this letter agreement technicality.


The company did book a $7M license fee from British
American Tobacco (BAT) in 2013, which granted BAT
exclusive access to patents for genetic modification of
nicotine levels that were developed by XXII separately
from the NCSU patents and bulls believe there is potential
for additional revenue from commercialization of products
BAT develops with this technology. Yet, this is at best years
away given that BAT has publicly stated that it has other
priorities for commercialization.


Additionally, no one seems to know the arrangements of
the BAT agreement except for XXII and BAT. The letter

referenced in the agreement (which provides the definition
of the “milestones” that need to be achieved in order to
unlock the other $7M) hasn’t been disclosed.


(source 44)


Bulls also point to the potential of XXII’s own brand of
standard cigarettes, which are set for national distribution
at some point in the future, but these cigarettes have been
trumpeted by the company since 2011 with no sales and
no advertising spending to date.


The Bull Case has Holes and the Company Is
Licensing Their X-22 Product – to Itself.


X-22, the company’s original catalyst and story heading
into the reverse merger, failed a Phase IIB trial at the end
of 2011. Since then, the company hasn’t announced any
partnerships or material news concerning X-22.


With respect to X-22, listed on the company’s website is
that the product has now been licensed to Hercules
Pharmaceuticals, LLC. Sounds impressive, right? A
licensing deal for their touted product? Sounds like this
company is going places.


(source: xxiicentury.com)


Until we find out that the company is licensing X-22 to
itself. Elsewhere on the company’s website, we can see
much clearer that Hercules Pharma, LLC is actually a
subsidiary of XXII:

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 21/36


We also note that the company apparently failed to update
the FDA with the results of its clinical trial, as
Clinicaltrials.gov shows that the last update to the trial
took place in October 2011 (source 47). Better managed
trials often conclude by posting follow-up and results, even
for failed trials. We’d also postulate that these steps need
to be taken before preparing another trial.


Then, in October of last year, the company entered into an
agreement with British American Tobacco (BAT) that would
allow it to license nicotine modification patents.


These patents cover genes that regulate nicotine
production in the leaf of tobacco plants, while the NCSU
patents cover genes that regulate nicotine production at
the roots. BAT paid XXII $7M up-front and may pay up to
an additional $7M if certain milestones are met. If a
commercial product is brought to market, the minimum
and maximum amount of annual royalties are $3M and
$15M for a period of three years increasing to $5M and
$25M thereafter up to a period of 15 years. (source 26)


BAT Commercialization: Bulls think the BAT research
agreement will lead to commercial revenues, but British
American Tobacco published a 29-page “Science &
Technology” report in January 2014 outlining the
company’s research priorities and providing both 2-year
and 4-year development plans. XXII is not named and
nicotine reduction is not mentioned at all in the report
(source 27). We think this helps easily debunk a majority
of the bull case.


The main focus of the BAT program is toxicant
reduction in standard cigarettes (nicotine is not a

toxicant) and electronic cigarette harm reduction
testing. The report also points to BAT subsidiary
Nicoventures where commercial development is ongoing
for harm reduction products which are currently limited to
BAT’s e-cigarette called Vype and a nicotine atomizing
product which is still in development.


BAT’s priorities might change if the FDA required
manufacturers to come out with low nicotine cigarettes.
But that seems unlikely given general concerns that low
nicotine products will result in people smoking more
cigarettes to compensate for reduced nicotine levels.


Lowering nicotine levels does not reduce the harm from
smoking (source 28). The harm occurs simply from burning
the tobacco, regardless of the nicotine content. Lowering
the nicotine lowers the addictive properties only. Moreover,
there are established alternate methods of lowering
nicotine content other than genetic modification, like
advanced filtering and chemical stripping. Such commercial
products have been introduced in the past with limited
success (e.g., the NEXT product from Philip Morris.)


Branded Cigarette Sales: Bulls argue that when the
NASCO Products MSA transfer clearance is approved, or
when XXII’s standalone MSA application is approved, XXII
will be able to begin national distribution of its RED SUN
and MAGIC branded cigarettes. With the equipment newly
purchased, XXII can manufacture these brands at its own
production facility instead of being contract manufactured
as in the past.


But becoming a signing member of the Master Settlement
Agreement is an optional choice for a cigarette
manufacturer. There are a number of smaller cigarette
makers that opt out of the MSA contract and sell as a non-
participating manufacturer (“NPM”). There are certain
benefits and protections given under the MSA, but the

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 23/36


financial difference between being a member and selling as
a NPM is negligible. Importantly, XXII’s current
branded standard cigarettes have been available
since 2011 and could have been sold as a NPM since
that time. Revenue from these products is essentially
zero.


The company has not stated the logic in approaching MSA
membership through acquisition (NASCO Products) versus
independent application. In both cases, the participating
states in the MSA have to approve the application (new
membership) or the transfer request (acquisition) and the
administrative work to establish escrow accounts would be
the same (MSA-related sources 29).


In either case XXII will be required to deposit on escrow
approximately $0.50 per pack of cigarettes sold annually
with each individual state in which they sell cigarettes. In
the case of the individual states’ MSA approval process,
these are done state-by-state and there should have been
some progress update since the company announced the
start of this process in January, 2013, and received its
Federal Tobacco Manufacturer permit in March, 2014.


We believe that even if XXII can overcome these hurdles,
the company will have to spend heavily on sales and
marketing for its branded products to be successful.


Brand A & B: While bulls argue that XXII will continue to
develop branded modified tobacco cigarettes and
eventually receive FDA approval to market them as
modified risk or smoking cessation products, the FDA itself
seems concerned that reduced nicotine products could lead
people to smoke more cigarettes.


SPECTRUM: A five-year study was initiated in 2011 by the
FDA and National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) utilizing
XXII’s SPECTRUM research cigarettes to study the effects

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 24/36


of low nicotine cigarettes on smoking habits in the United
States (see New York Times, October 28th, 2011). Initial
results are expected to be released sometime in late 2014.
Similar studies in New Zealand (2013) and Japan (2012-
2013) have shown that low nicotine cigarettes alone are
not an effective quitting mechanism. The New Zealand
study concludes that smokers need a strong motivation to
be swayed to use low nicotine cigarettes and suggests
offering them at 1/10th the price of standard cigarettes as
a potential motivation. XXII delivered no SPECTRUM
cigarettes in 2013 and in 2014 only $270K in net revenue
has been derived from SPECTRUM cigarette sales.


We believe that XXII is technically in default of the license
agreement with North Carolina State University — this is
the technology behind Brand A, Brand B, SPECTRUM, and
X-22. There doesn’t seem to be any disclosure that NCSU
has terminated the agreement based on default, but this
creates a large amount of uncertainty going forward.


Export Sales: Bulls argue that export sales of modified
tobacco products could be a growth channel, with XXII
selling to Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg and Poland.
From XXII’s 2013 10-Q, March 2014: “Laboratory testing
and European labeling requirements are expected to be
completed soon, and shortly thereafter distribution of the
Company’s products will commence.”


Again, we have seen all talk regarding the export sales and
no meaningful revenue.


Marijuana: In April 2014, XXII announced an investment
of $700K for a 25% stake in an unnamed plant genetics
company. The buzz is that this might be something
marijuana-related. To date, there is no evidence at all that
XXII has any technology that would work in modifying
marijuana, or for that matter, why anyone would want that.

The Company Has No Near Term
Prospects


By the 4th quarter of 2013 the original story behind the
reverse merger, X-22, which failed Phase IIB trial at the
end of 2011, seemed to fall by the wayside. XXII tried to
revive the product in 2013 by utilizing cigarettes with
slightly higher nicotine levels than those used in the failed
trial for additional testing, but results still didn’t entice
anyone to partner with XXII to fund additional development
(source 34).


The 2013 10-K (source 1) shows that the company has
suspended further clinical trials of X-22:


However, in October, 2013, XXII entered into an agreement
with British American Tobacco (BAT) to license nicotine
modification patents that XXII had developed separately
from NCSU. These patents cover genes that regulate
nicotine production in the leaf of tobacco plants, while the
NCSU patents cover genes that regulate nicotine
production at the roots. BAT/ paid XXII $7M up-front and
may pay up to an additional $7M if certain milestones are
met.


In December, 2013, XXII bought a cigarette manufacturing
facility (out of bankruptcy) from Renegade Tobacco Inc. for
$3M in cash, and then sold $650K of the equipment
acquired that it did not need in the same month. This is the
first time XXII has owned its own equipment (source 33).


XXII also paid $1M in December to purchase NASCO
Products Inc., a tiny tobacco company with no recent
operations. However, NASCO is a participating member of

5/23/2018 22nd Century Group (XXII) - A Lot Of Smoke, Not Enough Fire | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 26/36


The MSA was established in 1998 between the state
Attorneys General of forty-six states, five U.S. territories,
the District of Columbia and the five largest tobacco
companies in America concerning the advertising,
marketing and promotion of tobacco products. To sell
cigarettes in these states, companies must either be
affiliated with an MSA member or register as a Non-
Participating Member (“NPM”) and establish an escrow
account in those states which is funded by a percentage of
sales.


On March 6th, 2014 XXII shares were approved for listing
on the NYSE-MKT exchange and XXII was added as a
component of the Russell 2000 index on June 30th.


On March 10th, 2014 the company announced it had
received its federal permit to manufacture tobacco
products (it had applied in January, 2013). This is a
requirement prior to MSA inclusion for any state tobacco
sales, including doing so as a NPM, but does not guarantee
inclusion.


Most recently, on July 11th, XXII announced-without
disclosing the name of the organization or the financials of
the agreement-that it had engaged a contract research
organization to assist with research and regulatory
activities related to FDA approval of modified risk products
and a smoking cessation product designation.


The press release is laden with fluff. For instance, it notes
that there are “1 billion smokers worldwide” while failing to
mention the company doesn’t seem to be engaging any of
them. Also in the realm of forward looking and
unnecessary fluff is this line:


Considering there are approximately 1 billion smokers
worldwide, Forbes magazine recently characterized a safer
cigarette as follows: A product that could have the biggest

impact on human health since the introduction of
antibiotics.


This line is true. A product could have a huge impact on
human health. The problem is, XXII doesn’t seem to have
this product, so why put this in the press release? (source

We do not believe there are any prospects in the near
future, short of another promotion, that are capable of
turning XXII stock back upward.


A History of Press Releases that
Haven’t Panned Out


While doing our research, we’ve noted a lot of company
press releases that seem impressive on the surface, but
that have all ultimately led to where the company is now-
poised for more dilution and continually posting losses.
When considering whether or not to lend credence to the
company’s most recent press releases, suggesting that
International and European sales could be right around the
corner, we chose to check what the company’s history of
delivering on press releases was. Specifically, the company
has issued press releases dating back to 2011 touting
potential “big things” which still haven’t panned out or of
which they’ve stopped talking about without major
explanation. This is a common tactic we’ve witnessed from
other pump and dump style companies. Here’s a list of
some of the more impressive sounding press releases the
company has released: May 29, 2014 – 22nd Century
Group Signs Letter of Intent with European Factory For
Production of Nicotine-Free Tobacco Cigarettes in Europe


While the letter of intent press release says that
MAGIC distribution was expected this summer, the
company has already pushed that date back in its last
10-Q filing:

https://geoinvesting.com/22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-enough-fire/ 28/36


Goodrich Tobacco signed a letter of intent with
Orion, a cigarette manufacturer in Poland, to
contract manufacture the Company’s proprietary
tobacco products for distribution in the European
Union. The parties are now finalizing a
manufacturing agreement. Distribution of MAGIC
Zero ® is expected in Spain in the fall of 2014.
Orion is a manufacturer and distributor of
smoking tobaccos, cigarettes, filter tubes, and
smoking accessories with distribution in more
than 20 countries. The Company continues to
work with its European partner on preparations
to launch the Company’s products in The
Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg, which is
also expected in the fall 2014. 22nd Century
Group is also evaluating the sale and distribution
of its products in other European countries and in
Asia, including China. September 18, 2013 –
22nd Century Group to Acquire Participating
Member of the Tobacco Master Settlement
Agreement


The company has had de minimis sales as a result of
acquiring NASCO for the MSA agreement, again from
the last 10-Q:


Our subsidiary, Goodrich Tobacco, introduced in
a limited capacity two super-premium priced
cigarette brands, RED SUN and MAGIC , into the
U.S. market in the first quarter 2011. There have
been de minimis sales of these brands since we
intentionally have not expanded marketing and
distribution of these brands to facilitate the
Company becoming a participating manufacturer
of the MSA. April 16, 2013 – 22nd Century

April 10, 2012 – 22nd Century Group to File Modified Risk
Cigarette Applications with the FDA


Two years later, still listed as in process in the
company’s 10-Q:


Our ability to generate meaningful revenue from
our potential modified risk tobacco products in
the United States depends on obtaining FDA
authorization to market these products as
modified risk, and our ability to generate
meaningful revenue in the United States from X-

are authorized and approved by the FDA, we
must still meet the challenges of successful
marketing, distribution and consumer
acceptance. February 8, 2012 – 22nd Century

A stunning headline suggests the company has
potential to see $90M in sales in the future. Of course,

of June 30th, 2014, the company lists $1.73M in net
inventory.


Summation and Price Target


This could be a case where the dilution alone could likely
knock XXII down to a price under what you paid for it. It
appears that company is only good at building false hope
so it can continue to raise money. With a new shelf
registration recently declared effective by the SEC, the
company is likely going to be getting ready to raise more
cash.


Regardless, we believe that with this company’s $47.21
million accumulated deficit, very little revenue, and
consistent history of net losses, that the stock is severely
overvalued simply as a result of promotion. We believe this
company has value only as a resalable shell, on which we
place a value of $500,000; strictly for the next reverse
merger. This amounts to $0.008/share. In addition, the
company currently has $9.1 million in shareholder’s equity
on the balance sheet, which amounts to roughly
$0.16/share.


We believe this company to be worth no more than $0.20
share, the price it closed at on October 10, 2012.


With the company burning cash, we’re simply wondering
when the next dilutive financing will close.


The clock is running…
