Straight Path Communications: A Critical Look At 5G
Jan. 31, 2017 10:15 AM ET73 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


Straight Path is still highly overvalued even if carriers are committed to mmWave 5G.


However, objective industry observers have recently questioned whether mmWave
5G will ever make economic sense.


These observers argue that mmWave 5G costs too much deploy in the name of
services that customers won't pay more for.


If the growing group of 5G skeptics is right, Straight Path's spectrum has almost no
value.


We remain short shares of Straight Path Communications (NYSE: STRP). As we argued
earlier this month, Straight Path is dramatically overvalued relative to the most appropriate
comparable transaction: Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) potential future acquisition of XO Holdings'
millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum. Reaching this conclusion does not require any
particular skepticism about the prospects of mmWave 5G. However, some investors -
apparently taking marketing fluff at face value - insist that mmWave 5G matters so much
to the future of mobile networks that carriers will eagerly pay a premium for Straight Path's
holdings, even when so much similar spectrum will soon be put up for auction.


This unquestioning attitude toward the industry's most ambitious claims about mmWave
5G makes little sense. 5G research and standards-writing are still in their earliest phases,
and no one actually knows yet whether large-scale mmWave deployments will generate
enough value to attract customers and produce acceptable returns on investment. Indeed,
just last week, Verizon - the carrier that has made the loudest noises about mmWave 5G,
albeit with a strong emphasis on non-mobile applications - confirmed that its efforts still
amount to nothing more than "precommercial pilots," aiming to answer basic questions
like "what's the cost to roll out…how many homes can you cover from any particular node,
what speeds can you get." Far from committing to an aggressive build-out, Verizon's CFO
was noncommittal:

[W]e'll see how those trials go. It's the same as any investment…We're going to look
at the revenue opportunity we think we can get based off of the results of the tests
that are underway right now and compare that with the cost.


Verizon's wait-and-see approach helps explain the structure of its spectrum deal with XO:
not an outright purchase but a more cautious short-term lease coupled with an option to
buy. If even the most aggressive 5G promoter in terms of rhetoric is this tentative in terms
of behavior, it doesn't bode well for Straight Path's mandatory spectrum sale.


Here, as a corrective to all the uninformed 5G hype circulating in the market, we review
recent independent, third-party analyses that call into question whether mmWave 5G will
ever flourish commercially. This viewpoint is no short-seller's fiction; it's shared by many
seasoned telecom veterans. The high costs and unclear benefits of mmWave 5G will
translate to slow, patchy deployments at best, tightly circumscribing Straight Path's value.
Talk is cheap, but when the time comes for carriers to open their checkbooks, reality will
prevail and the Straight Path bubble will deflate.


Q: Why is everyone talking about 5G now?


A: Because the equipment vendors want to. Honestly, that's the whole problem with
our industry - they have to be real careful. I know they are hungry for business, but
the trouble is they are driving the industry into the ground. We're barely recouping
our investments, and now they're asking us to plow more money in there for a
purpose that is not yet entirely clear. It's based on speculation about the Internet of
Things, or whatever else comes along, and all this hype about speed. Please! What
is the biggest growth in mobile networks? Everyone knows it's video, but can you
watch a video quicker? Do you want to fast forward to view it? No you don't. You
don't need that much bandwidth.


- Douglas Li, former CEO of the billion-dollar Hong Kong-based carrier SmarTone, August
31, 2015


I'm concerned that the spectrum all looks pretty horrible, and I can't see how the
economics of 5G are going to look very attractive.

Cambridge Wireless 5G debate, November 8, 2016

AT&T's Vision of Ultrafast Wireless Technology May Be a Mirage


- New York Times headline, October 26, 2016


When we released our first report on Straight Path in October 2015, 5G hype had yet to
spread very widely. Today, the term "5G" is on everyone's lips, whether during quarterly
earnings calls or industry events like the annual Consumer Electronics Show. Predictably,
snazzy demonstrations and utopian pronouncements have edged out critical
assessments. Recently, however, one industry participant has clearly set forth the
limitations and shortcomings of the prospective technology in a book entitled The 5G
Myth: When Vision Decoupled from Reality. The author, a telecom consultant named
William Webb who previously served as head of R&D for Ofcom (the UK equivalent of the
FCC) and has also been deeply involved in IoT technology in the private sector , makes a
series of stark claims that he summarizes as follows:


5G as currently envisaged will not be realised. …


a. Demand for higher speeds is unlikely to continue to grow.


b. Technological improvement will no longer be able to deliver higher speeds without huge
increases in cost.


c. Users are unwilling to pay more for their mobile communications limiting the appetite of
mobile network operators (MNOs) for investment.


d. Alternative futures are more appealing, such as delivering consistent connectivity which
would both be preferred by users and more likely to improve productivity than the 5G
vision.


Though Webb's argument flies in the face of conventional wisdom, his logic is sound.
Video is already the main driver of cellular traffic today, but the vast majority of wireless
viewing takes place in the home using Wi-Fi; there are only so many hours in the day
when the typical user has the ability and willingness to consume video on the go. While
high-resolution video can require high data rates, the success of T-Mobile's
(NASDAQ:TMUS) Binge On and AT&T's (NYSE:T) copycat Stream Saver, both of which
convert video streams to lower resolutions in order to reduce traffic, clearly show that few
consumers actually care about getting the highest possible resolution. (The human eye
often can't even discern high from very high resolution when looking at screens as small
as smartphones.) Beyond the 1 to 5 megabits per second necessary to sustain a basic
video stream, then, users see little value in ever higher speeds.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040952-straight-path-communications-critical-look-5g 4/23


Yet, the main appeal of mmWave 5G is supposed to be extremely high speeds enabled by
very wide bandwidths. Straight Path, for instance, has labeled its small research facility
the "Gigabit Mobility Lab," an allusion to the fact that 5G will deliver data rates on the
order of a gigabit per second. Yet as recent announcements from T-Mobile, AT&T and
Sprint show, the existing 4G LTE standard already supports gigabit speeds, and every
major US carrier will provide them in at least some markets in 2017 and beyond. If real-
world users are satisfied with a few megabits per second and LTE can reach a thousand,
how much additional value will exotic 5G technologies really offer? It's no wonder T-
Mobile's CTO recently emphasized that "LTE has massive legs. This industry is going to
compete around LTE for much of the next decade."


But if users ascribe little value to speeds beyond those of LTE, large-scale mmWave
deployments are never going to make economic sense. While mmWave propagation may
vary widely from place to place (and even from time to time within a given place, affected
by phenomena like rainfall and plant growth), coverage radii will be on the order of 100
meters - tiny by traditional standards. Either carriers will have to build out enormous
quantities of small cells, which in turn will require ubiquitous high-capacity backhaul, or
mmWave service will never be available in many places and thus can never be an
important part of a carrier's business or marketing. Why bother incurring huge capital
expenditures with no realistic prospect of higher revenues?


In laying out his case that mmWave 5G as currently conceived will fizzle out, Webb
anticipates and rebuts the objection that, if the technology was so unlikely to pan out, the
industry wouldn't be working on it:


The manufacturers and operators are powerful companies. … Many believe that if such
large companies state that they are going to pursue a particular vision or object then this
is certain to occur. History suggests otherwise. MNOs have in the past declared strong
support for:


Video calling
Picture messaging
Location-based services
Femtocells
Internet/walled-gardens/WAP
Widgets/own-brand apps stores
eHealth
Mobile payment

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040952-straight-path-communications-critical-look-5g 5/23


None of these came to be provided by the MNO. Video calling was delivered over-the-top
(OTT) by Skype. Picture messaging became part of Apps with increasingly easy ability to
embed pictures in Tweets and emails. Location-based services were delivered by Google
(GOOG, GOOGL) using data gathered by the phone and eventually GPS location. Walled
garden Internet was rapidly overtaken by devices like the iPhone able to access
mainstream sites. Widgets became redundant with the advent of the Apps store. MNOs
proved unable to make headway into eHealth and mobile payment was eventually
delivered by the banking sector and device manufacturers. Simply because the industry
declares it supports a vision does not imply it will happen.


(Other examples would include abortive yet initially much heralded technologies like
WiMAX and LTE Broadcast.) But Webb views 5G more cynically than past failures: "In this
case…it seems likely that the MNO support is lukewarm. While they indicate a desire for
5G they will await its emergence before making decisions as to whether to invest. Major
players can be wrong, but here it is more a case of them sending out stronger signals of
support than they believe internally." In other words, while past disconnects between MNO
rhetoric and real-world outcomes arose from blunders, here MNOs privately understand
the problems even as they publicly endorse the vision.


Why? Webb points out that, at this early stage, almost everyone in the industry benefits
from happy (if unrealistic) talk about 5G. Equipment vendors hope to sell cutting-edge
tools. Carriers and regulators hope to portray themselves as facilitators of innovation.
Academics and other researchers get funding to investigate fascinating technical
problems. In short, "[i]t is in nobody's interest to rock the boat." While that may suffice to
keep the 5G myth going for a few more years, it doesn't mean that operators will actually
commit real money to the technology (for instance, by purchasing Straight Path's
spectrum at a price of $500 million). With so many question marks looming over the whole
enterprise, operators have every incentive to bide their time.


While Webb's 5G Myth is unusually clear in its debunking of industry hype, others have
made similar points. Kim Larsen, a senior vice president in the technology group at
Deutsche Telekom (OTCQX:DTEGF) (the large German operator that owns a majority of
T-Mobile), recently released an essay on "5G economics" that also throws cold water on
mmWave 5G (emphasis not added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040952-straight-path-communications-critical-look-5g 6/23


Clearly, ubiquitous 5G coverage at those high frequencies (i.e., >3 GHz) would be a
very silly endeavor (to put it nicely) and very un-economical.


5G, as long as the main frequency deployed is in the high or very high
frequency regime, would remain a niche technology. Irrelevant to a large
proportion of customers and use cases.


…In my own opinion, if 5G will be launched primarily in the mm-wave bands
around and above 30 GHz, I would not expect to see a very aggressive 5G
uptake.


... Would it not be economically more relevant to boost the customer experience
across our macro-cellular networks, that actually serves our customers today? As
opposed to augment the existing LTE network with ultra hot zones of extreme
speeds and possibly also an extreme number of small cells.


If 5G would remain an above 3 GHz technology, it would be largely irrelevant to
the mass market and most use cases.


… Maybe more importantly, will the 5G customer experience from the very high
speed and very low latency really be noticeable to the customer?


Straight Path bulls, often unaware of this skeptical perspective on 5G, simply cite positive
comments from leaders at Verizon and AT&T that seem to signal strong faith in the
technology. But much of what these companies are pursuing - still in very small-scale trials
- is fixed wireless access (FWA), which, by definition, doesn't involve mobile devices and
thus pertains to a much smaller target market. Fixed wireless can, in principle, enable
wireline providers to connect to homes that are too expensive to run fiber to - for instance,
in protected historic neighborhoods. But the history of fixed wireless is littered with failures
(as well as excuses for why this time was different). Indeed, the 28 and 39GHz bands now
authorized in the US for mobile use were originally viewed as domains for fixed wireless
access but fell into disuse precisely because the technology could not successfully
compete with wireline broadband.


Whether or not Verizon moves forward with the pre-standards 28GHz fixed wireless
service it's now piloting, the company already has enough spectrum locked down via the
XO transaction to support its ambitions. For Straight Path, then, that leaves AT&T and T-
Mobile (in light of Sprint's continued financial weakness and spectrum surplus). But many
observers believe that AT&T's newfound optimism about fixed wireless is, at least in part,
a ploy aimed at securing approval for its acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). By

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040952-straight-path-communications-critical-look-5g 7/23


claiming it's going to create an alternative to wireline broadband and challenge Charter
(NASDAQ:CHTR) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), AT&T casts itself as a pro-
competitive force, not a potential monopolist.


Even setting aside the question of ulterior motive, AT&T's fixed-wireless efforts already
demonstrate a strong willingness to consider any source of spectrum, including unlicensed
bands (used in the company's "5G business customer trial" in Austin) and the lightly
licensed 70/80 GHz bands (used in separate fixed-wireless trials, including one in
Minneapolis). Google, for its part, is testing fixed wireless service in Kansas City using the
shared 3.5GHz band. With so many other options available to it, a player like AT&T just
doesn't need Straight Path's spectrum to provide fixed wireless service, even if that is its
genuine goal. As for T-Mobile, a recent FierceWireless headline put it well:


T-Mobile reiterates apathy toward fixed 5G services


As much as spectrum bulls like to fantasize about new entrants shaking up the wireless
market, it would be economic suicide for anyone to build a de novo network on a mmWave
foundation; it would be a nightmare to deploy and, outside of select hot spots, it would
offer no coverage. Besides, if any new entrant had serious plans to go toe-to-toe with the
incumbents, the best opportunity to achieve scale would be by acquiring low-frequency
spectrum in the 600MHz incentive auction - yet as the (still unfolding) results of that
auction show, there's little demand for such spectrum.


For Straight Path, then, AT&T and T-Mobile are the only realistic buyers for the bulk of its
spectrum, and their only realistic motives would be to provide mmWave mobile service. As
Webb and Larsen's analyses indicate, however, mmWave mobile networks pose such
enormous difficulties and promise such modest benefits that they will likely never take root
outside of small niches. For major carriers, small-scale mmWave experimentation may
nonetheless make sense as a hedge, but with large mmWave auctions on the horizon and
additional bands in the pipeline, there's no reason to pay up for Straight Path. To be sure,
Straight Path is egregiously overvalued even if 5G succeeds commercially, but no one
should take that outcome for granted.

NEWS OUT: 3. AT&T's FiberTower Purchase May Take It Directly to Straight Path 
01/31/17 
AT&T's announced acquisition of FiberTower may lead it to consider buying Straight Path as it seeks to acquire 
39 GHz licenses for future 5G services. The FiberTower deal gives AT&T access to a small amount of 39 GHz 
spectrum in select markets, such as New York, Chicago, Dallas and Seattle, on which it can conduct 5G trials. But 
FiberTower's holdings are far from sufficient for national coverage or even coverage inside major urban centers, 
whereas Straight Path has national 39 GHz coverage. 
Straight Path owns about 620 MHz of 39 GHz spectrum in the top 30 markets and 550 MHz nationally. AT&T 
estimates carriers will need 60 MHz channels of 39 GHz airwaves to meet its performance needs. Straight Path 
may be motivated to sell its spectrum following a settlement with the FCC on Jan. 12.

Why do you think ATT would buy Fibertower over STRP if we have more licenses?


31 Jan 2017, 04:20 PM


The Lowdown, Contributor
Details of that purchase were not disclosed. One of FiberTower's core 3 business lines is small cell and macro
cell backhaul. They only have a small portfolio of mmWave licenses as the majority of these licenses were
revoked by the FCC years ago. However, this case is still being litigated in front of the FCC....so perhaps T is
after the small cell functionality/spectrum assets (for testing) or/and hoping to help fiber tower get the licenses
back from the FCC (if possible). Regardless, this action exemplifies value for STRP...if anyone has the price
paid for FT, we can easily point to a value for STRP.

STRP up 57% over the past 52 weeks. S&P up over 17.9% Great choice to pound the table on shorting STRP 1. 5

AT&T buys FiberTower...They have a tiny portfolio of spectrum (24 and 39) but they have a significant business of
Small cell and Macro cell Backhaul...So now that AT&T has notified the market that they are after 39GHz, are they
going to allow someone to come in ahead of them?


VZ, for example, spends about $4.5b every six months on wireless capex....a $2b acquisition for either of these
names to secure spectrum in a band that they have ANNOUNCED they need is really not hard to imagine...These
companies do not run the risk of letting their future to be dictated by auctions...

One thing that Kerrisdale made a mistake on was their "reproduction" of the UBS report. While that report does exist,
the analyst "cannot recall" where that $200m number came from. In speaking with VZ, they assured my that no details
of the deal were publicly released. Even if VZ released non public info, there is far more to the deal than meets the
eye.


Some industry experts go further in stating that the market is well aware of two things. 1, XO was writing down their
fiber assets and 2, the deal was being skewed to fiber (as opposed to spectrum)....so the $1.8b deal was potentially
underpriced?

From the AT&T PR 
"5G & Small Cells Innovation


We've started deploying small cells using Centralized RAN (C-RAN) architecture in the city of San Francisco. This
deployment, which will be replicated in other cities, will densify our network and lay the groundwork for 5G and
beyond. Additionally, we have entered into an agreement to acquire FiberTower Corporation, and its mmWave
spectrum rights, to assist in the execution of this vision.


We plan to install small cells on light posts and other infrastructure in the urban core of San Francisco. We'll use a C-
RAN architecture approach to build them. That means all the "brains" or base band units of each small cell or tower
will exist in one location.


Storing the brains of hundreds of towers and small cells in one place lets engineers add capacity and improve
efficiency for hundreds of cell sites quickly and simultaneously. New features may include smart city applications or
network upgrades. Putting the hardware in one location will also make it easier to transition to cloud and software-
based technology, which aligns with the AT&T 2020 vision and software-defined networking."

Great article with research on what industry experts say. In this case what industry experts say is just common sense

investors in STRP are ignoring them. They will find out negotiating a sale of a worthless asset with a year deadline
and even sooner cash problems is not possible.


Telco's in the US are so big they may be able to afford asset allocation mistakes. In the light of your quotes this is
unlikely to happen, and certainly not with buying STRP's spectrum.


I do believe people are going to need higher speeds, but not so much outdoor. Indoor people can always use
unlicensed spectrum. Much licensed mm spectrum will be free to use indoors anyway, that will be the approach of the
FCC. Indoor use will not harm the license holder since these signals are blocked by walls and windows.

The solutions


Thankfully, the same characteristics that make mmWave so difficult to implement can be used to combat its
shortcomings.


Short transmission paths and high propagation losses allows for spectrum reuse by limiting the amount of interference
between adjacent cells, according to Robert W. Heath, professor in the department of electrical and computer
engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. In addition, where longer paths are desired, the extremely short
wavelengths of mmWave signals make it feasible for very small antennas to concentrate signals into highly focused
beams with enough gain to overcome propagation losses. The short wavelengths of mmWave signals also make it
possible to build multielement, dynamic beamforming antennas that will be small enough to fit into handsets.

AT&T is paving the way for 5G in the US, starting with an initial rollout in its Austin and Indianapolis markets later this
year, the company announced at an event in San Francisco today.


01 Feb 2017, 02:26 PM


The Lowdown, Contributor
There have been numerous developments as of late that I think are worth noting:


STRP shelf registration. 
Kerrisdale published 2 short reports on STRP. 
AT&T quietly acquires FiberTower.


Shelf registration:


Straight Path initiated strategic alternatives with Evercore prior to the announced settlement with the FCC. One thing
is very clear: Straight Path must produce $15m in cash over the next 12 months. This is in addition to the cost of
retaining Evercore and any additional legal and/or costs tied to continued business operations. While we await the
SEC notice of effectiveness, one possibility is that Straight Path could have Evercore “place” some or all of the newly
registered shares thus not directly affecting market liquidity. Alternatively, the firm could issue the shares via private
placement upon any potential acquisition. If the goal of STRP is to continue operations of Straight Path Ventures and
Straight Path IP post sale of Straight Path Spectrum, the firm is going to need a more concrete balance sheet. This is
obviously all my opinion but I am glad to see activity moving quickly. If IDT is responsible for the FCC fines as the
separation and distribution agreement suggests, it will be some time before this is resolved (as with all legal issues).


Amid the FCC’s continued Broadcast Auction, the industry remains in a “quiet period.” The goal of this mandate is to
prevent, among other things, collusion amongst auction participants. To clarify, this quiet period does NOT affect
STRP’s ability to speak with potential acquirers. However, it does, for example, prevent VZ from speaking with T
regarding STRP.


Kerrisdale:


The main argument behind Kerrisdale’s short thesis is an apparent UBS report (John Hodulik) from February of 2016.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040952-straight-path-communications-critical-look-5g 14/23


"Verizon will also lease XO Communications' high-frequency wireless spectrum, with an option to buy for $200 million,
by year-end 2018, UBS said in a research report."


I have reached out to John and his response was “I cannot remember how we obtained that number.” I also reached
out to the head of VZ’s investor relations department. In speaking with their team, VZ stated that “the specific details
related to the spectrum lease and option were never publicly disclosed.” This makes sense, as the $200m value
cannot be found in any filing/disclosure made with or by VZ, XO, SEC, or the FCC. For arguments sake, lets assume
someone released a material non-public number. We can only speculate as to its significance. Perhaps this is the
sum that VZ paid XO for the OPTION to exercise the spectrum portfolio purchase? To me, this would make sense
considering how other industry analysts were valuing XO’s spectrum assets at the same time.


Jeff Kvaal (Nomura) published a note on February, 22nd stating:


“XO owns ~50% of LMDS spectrum, which covers ~75% of US POPs including key markets in NYC, DC, LA,
Chicago, and Denver. We view DC as particularly attractive, given the number of low buildings and its grid layout. We
estimate XO’s spectrum to be worth ~$1-2bn, with an average holding of 1.2GHz per market, more than sufficient for
Verizon. We note that Verizon is initially only leasing the LMDS spectrum with an option to purchase it sometime by
year-end 2018.”


So did XO agree to potentially sell their spectrum assets for only $200m in 2018? I seriously doubt it. Although again,
who knows how the cost of this spectrum were allocated across the $1.8b deal.


In addition, this lease/option was agreed to prior to the so many recent regulatory (FCC Spectrum Frontiers) and
technological breakthroughs that should greatly support an even higher valuation.


On Jan 17th, 2017, Bloomberg attempted to do a sum-of-the-parts analysis on the transaction and argued that based
on comparable fiber deals, the fiber assets might have been worth ~$1.3B. Again, this is all speculation from an
outsider on a deal that others suggests was executed at a depressed level as Carl was attempting to write off his fiber
assets.


I am confident that VZ would be laughing if someone told them the value of their potential licensed holdings at 28GHz
was only $200m. Lets also not forget that the FCC has not approved VZ’s potential purchase of XO’s spectrum. The
FCC has only approved the lease and FCC filings by industry opposition has led the FCC to state that any future
acquisition will be addressed when the option is “exercised.” (See DISH opposition)


AT&T Acquisition of FiberTower:


AT&T quietly announced their acquisition of privately-held FiberTower this week. FiberTower has two essential
business lines.


-Small cell and macro cell backhaul (essential for 5G)


-Spectrum leasing


Years ago, the FCC revoked ~90% of FT’s spectrum assets at 24GHz and 39GHz for failing to meet build out
requirements. The material question is whether AT&T will have a potential claim on these revoked licenses as a result
of their acquisition of FiberTower. Personally, I have a hard time believing that AT&T’s competition would allow the
FCC to simply hand these assets over to AT&T. However, with the FCC hoping to get these assets into the
marketplace, anything is possible.
5/23/2018 Straight Path Communications: A Critical Look At 5G - Straight Path Communications Inc. (NYSEMKT:STRP) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4040952-straight-path-communications-critical-look-5g 15/23


If AT&T will not have a claim on this case brought on my FT debtors, then the remaining spectrum portfolio will be
inefficient for the 39GHz plans that AT&T has announced. In addition, is AT&T simply going to allow a competitor to
purchase STRP and establish a nationwide footprint? I have to think AT&T is thinking more strategically than this. VZ,
for example, spends ~$4.5B every six months on wireless capex and might soon control ~70% (by pops) of the
28GHz band. Is it fair to say that AT&T is thus focusing on a nationwide footprint at 39GHz? I think the history of
telecom would support this theory.


Not to get too detailed here, but one other point to note is that almost half of FT’s revoked licenses at 39GHz were
RSA (rectangular service area) licenses that were replaced by BEA licenses at the turn of the century. STRP
previously disclosed that they had never assigned any value to their own RSA licenses that they held on their books
(and recently returned to the FCC).


A caller on Kerrisdale’s conference call made a great point: “companies like AT&T and Verizon don’t build future
networks in massive capacity and distribution over shared networks and they certainly don’t run the risk of allowing
their future to be dictated by auctions.”


Carriers have announced that their focus includes the licensed 39GHz band and with mmWave spectrum auctions
years away, I cannot imagine that existing players and/or new wireless entrants will allow others to establish
themselves first.


Is there a sense of hype to 5G? ABSOLUTELY. The infrastructure will take over a decade to complete (and will
probably not meet our imaginations) although with STRP’s portfolio already meeting 2024 FCC build out
requirements, an acquirer can literally sit on this attractive band well through 2030.


As i've mentioned before, I absolutely want to own the risk that STRP's spectrum valuation will surprise to the topside.


The industry will now begin promoting 5G services at an accelerated pace (as per below):

Ruerd Heeg, Marketplace Contributor
1. The 40 m radius or 80 m diameter comes from a high-end telco expert: http://ubm.io/2mKN54C 
This is for deployment in a cellular network. That's where money could be earned if the costs for such a
dense network wouldn't be so high and if these signals would not be blocked by windows, cars and trees.


It is possible to use high frequencies for connections over larger distances than 80 m. As with cellular, the
sender and receiver need to see each other, hence "Straight Path Communications". Again these signals
would be blocked by trees, windows and so on. This setup could be useful as an alternative for transmitting
signals through fiber or copper. So this is a special application for providing a backhaul point in places that
are difficult to reach, or where the connection is just temporary.


This is NOT where the money is. Telco's only pay substantial amounts of money for spectrum that can be
deployed in a cellular network and works with current phones.


2) I don't know about what spectrum the other companies hold or what else they do. But keep in mind the last
alinea of my answer to 1).


04 Mar 2017, 03:19 AM


jayuusee
Ruerd is making reference to 5G mobility basestations for communications to handsets but even in this mode,
we are seeing 10X+ the coverage that he references. Our company is right along side Samsung and Nokia in
trials with 2 of the big 4 US mobile network operators. My coverage reference fits the likes of the companies
you mention in question number 2 and fall within the fixed wireless access camp, which is what Windstream,
CenturyLink and Frontier -- and Charter, Altice and others are testing as alternatives to fiber to the home. In
the world of 5G, yes there is a shorter mobility radius for connectivity to the handsets but the same spectrum
28/39 is being tested to backhaul the 5G node itself using ptp and PtMP scenarios. My range references are
supporting now in excess of 40,000 fixed wireless residential customers in 3 states - see vivintwireless.com --


Also it's incredible coming out of mobile world congress where Verizon and AT&T have asserted their 5G
plans and talked openly about the use of this spectrum, that folks would actually still want to operate in a
world of denial about these bands being core to the 5G world 2020 and beyond. As I mentioned before,
CBNL, my company, supports 7 of the top 10 worldwide mobile network operators with technology at 26-
42GHz -- so the source of any discrepancy is down to a simple Apple and Orange equation, (aside from short
sellers who simply want to twist the facts). A Samsung/Nokia/Huawei 5G eNodeB basestation uses a very
wide channel in the LMDS A 1 block (400MHz x 2) to support very high capacity download capacity in the
urban marketplace to Qualcomm chipsets to come in smartphones -- this is a legitimate application in embryo
being tested in several US marketplaces -- anywhere you google a reference to Samsung or Nokia testing 5G
with a carrier in a US marketplace, this is what they're talking about. Conversely, anywhere you Google
reference a 5G fixed wireless test, trial or deployment (like Windstream, Cambridge Broadband Networks),

Ruerd Heeg, Marketplace Contributor
It does not penetrate windows. I think it does penetrate a few leaves though, but not a hundred leaves. Maybe
if your coat is not too thick it will still get the signal.


I guess you have to take your phone out of your pocket, then go outside, then chose a good position with
direct sight to the base station (avoid trees and other obstacles), all before starting to use 5G internet.


BTW, at the moment cell phones do not support these high frequencies yet.

We'll see if the spectrum ever gets used.


Admittedly it was a horrible idea to short a company that could provide a competitive advantage, real or

20 Jun 2017, 05:10 AM


jayuusee
Ruerd, my friend, 5G is not isolated to just higher mmW bands but will include the use of mid band LTE spectrum
600MHz and other bands. New mmW modems in the handsets will as always pick the paths they can use and
combine the carriers on the baseband to provide increased capacity. Nobody is suggesting a phone would run full
time on mmW spectrum -- but a phone will use mmW it in urban environments where it can. As will thousands of new
devices, IOT centric. As the chipsets come out more devices will include mmW connectivity as one of many options.
The phone in your pocket right now is utilizing probably 4-5 bands to provide 4G at any given time. mmW at 24-
39GHz is part of an evolutionary chain to provide more capacity to the mobile network architectures of the future...
nobody is suggesting it is a replacement for lower Band spectrum.

jayuusee, can you add some color or details to the numbers of the XO and Fibertower transactions? XO
wireless piece was embedded in the overall deal including fiber assets but Verizon could have ascribed
anywhere from $500M - $1B+ to those wireless licenses. Fibertower's deal came across the wire as part of
the Airgig announcement and seemed to simply be an afterthought on purpose though. I have both

Unfortunately I have first hand relationships with the executive team of FiberTower and knowledge of the
AT&T/FiberTower deal so I cannot confirm or speculate about the price publicly given NDA's in place -- however I
have seen some good analysis posted on SeekingAlpha by some folks who are long on the STRP stock. The Verizon
transaction is complicated, as it's currently being leased with an option to buy it. What does that mean exactly? Did
the cash already exchange hands on the option itself? It would seem to me that if one has until Dec 2018 to exercise
the option to acquire that the full monetary component to the transaction isn't fully finished, my guess is they paid a
number to lease it nationwide and stop further leasing from outside parties, about 20 of my customers were
hamstrung because of this, and that some strings on both sides are being pulled to work out the final details -- 1.
Verizon wants to know the spectrum works and works well for their evolutionary plans, why finalize the transaction
until you know you have reasonable performance and cost centers for both basestations, mobile handsets and fixed
wireless products. 2. If Icahn was smart (this is assumed) he would have seen the 5G writing on the wall via their
interest and reserved the right to agree to the final price when they officially exercised their acquisition option in its
entirety. Verizon would have countered with a Max price cap. I believe he wanted out of the XO business bad enough
to take a marginal deal on the fiber and the wireless assets. Therefore my conclusion is Verizon picked up 28GHz for
a steal, the lowest price paid for any mobile spectrum in the history of the FCC if you will -- I estimate $.002-.004 per
MHz/pop.


08 Mar 2017, 09:03 AM


darkstar82
Thanks jayuusee. The $.002 - $.004 on the Verizon deal per mhz pop makes the $600-$700M Fibertower
deal seem reasonable. I have zero doubt that AT&T will get the entire lot of 700+ licenses that were in play
with Fibertower. The FCC wants AT&T and Verizon off and running quickly with this.

**T-Mobile not on the fixed wireless bandwagon: CTO


“Every business case piece of work I’ve seen put in front of me doesn’t math at this point in time. The costs of
deployment, the density of deployment” and the challenges associated with 28 GHz and propagation, especially for
the home, are just too much.

Kerrisdale, bulls argue that these guys have moved the technology of 5G in the 28-40Mhz bands quite far along the
path of commercial implementation. Do you have a view on this?

Crickets.


I've made a couple of replies to previous ultra-confident shorts and they immediately requested SA remove

I wish SA wouldn't do that, their incorrect investment commentary should be required to live on indefinitely.
