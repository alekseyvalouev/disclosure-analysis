Countless companies have come public over the last decade through reverse
mergers that effectively bypass regulatory scrutiny. The annals of the stock
market are littered with costly stories of companies blatantly misleading
investors with fictitious financial results, inaccurate press releases, and
incomplete disclosures. And of course there are the management teams that
were previously accused of fraud, misrepresentation, or attempted stock
manipulation that magically reappear years later with a new logo and story to
sell. But it is the endangered species, the Black Rhino of the equity markets,
that can masterfully combine all of these attributes and remain under the
regulatory radar. We believe magicJack (CALL) is such an animal, and until
now it has not been exposed. With this report, our most comprehensive ever,
we aim to lift the curtain on the amazingly misrepresented story of magicJack.

During our exhaustive review of magicJack, we have uncovered a
myriad of significant red flags in the business and the financial tale. In
the wake of the Chinese reverse merger fraud era, it has been easy for
market participants to become desensitized to accounting abuses and
management misrepresentations. However, the incomprehensible
activity at magicJack rivals most Chinese reverse merger, creating
unprecedented risk for the predominantly retail shareholder base,
while simultaneously lampooning the integrity of the U.S. Equity
markets. We will unequivocally show that magicJack has presented its
retail investor base with earnings press releases and financial tables
that are overstated and later altered based on the corresponding SEC
filings. It is our belief that the company wantonly misrepresented its
financial results in front of a proposed secondary offering, and has
continued to provide investor correspondence that is blatantly
misleading and inaccurate. This brazen stock manipulation has been
exacerbated by a series of ploys to attract and pump retail investors.
We believe that an SEC investigation is not only warranted, but is a
necessity as magicJack's Board of Directors appears deeply conflicted
and agnostic towards oversight. Based on past and present business
relationships and insider dealings, which include sub-market wealth
transfers, we believe the Board has completely failed to protect the
shareholders whom they legally represent. A quick trip to their "high-
tech" innovation offices, which is located next to a rug and upholstery
cleaner, is an eye-opening sight.


The (recently resigned) CEO of magicJack, Dan Borislow, has notoriously
played by his own set of public market rules and continues to "seem less like a
CEO than an ineffectual Mob boss."[i] Our report will detail how Dan Borislow
was sued by shareholders of his previous company for allegedly orchestrating
a model that diverted costs and manipulated the actual health of the business.
Equally alarming is the fact that the current CFO of magicJack was actually the
CFO of one of the companies accused of conspiring with Borislow to
misrepresent its costs. Additionally, Mr. Borislow and his management team
have been highly selective in their risk disclosures, choosing NOT to disclose a
lawsuit against the company in Madison County, which we believe could
eliminate 100% of its questionable "earnings" stream and all of its cash. And
this is just the tip of the iceberg as the picture below the surface is replete
with a multitude of financial shenanigans and deceit.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1436471-magicjack-vocaltec-call-accounting-illusions-vanishing-financials-and-a-dark-history


Given our belief that magicJack has irrefutably violated Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as well as Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, we have forwarded our report to multiple regulatory
bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.[ii] We believe that
the NASDAQ and SEC should halt trading immediately in magicJack to ensure
investors finally have accurate answers to many of the questions and issues
we raise (including which set of financial results investing decisions should be
based on and providing more disclosure about various related party equity
transactions that we believe have been misrepresented). With unquantifiable
downside risk, we believe investors would be wise to ask themselves, "What
exactly is it that I own, what are the real numbers, and how do I really value
magicJack?"


This report will highlight:


1) Poof!! magicJack appears out of thin air - A reverse merger of YMax
and a $19 million Israeli shell is how Borislow took magicJack public. The
company claims to produce world class products despite spending less than
$2.6 million on R&D. Its center for innovation in the U.S. appears to be a
warehouse next to a shack housing a rug and upholstery cleaning business.


2) Accusations of Securities Fraud and false/misleading earnings - The
CEO of magicJack, Dan Borislow, was previously sued for securities fraud for
"utilizing improper methods of accounting" to issue earnings reports that were
"false and misleading." The lawsuit accused him of working with other telecom
resellers to hide marketing costs while inflating his company's profits. The CFO
of magicJack was the CFO of one of the "partition" companies accused of
conspiring with Borislow's former company to hide costs. We do not believe
magicJack has disclosed the former charges against its CEO/Chairman in its
public filings. It appears magicJack is now offering "reseller applications" that
leads us to question whether a similar expense scheme may be on the horizon.


3) Playing by his own set of rules - Borislow created two Trusts that were
used as vehicles to liquidate public equity in his former company. Based on tax
records, nearly half of the spending of the D&K charitable foundation has gone
to pay Borislow and his foundation's CFO. Borislow also had a foray into
Women's Professional Soccer, which led to accusations he made "public
statements that reflect a blatant disregard for the truth."

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1436471-magicjack-vocaltec-call-accounting-illusions-vanishing-financials-and-a-dark-history


4) Bi-Polar or just in-your-face stock manipulation? - We meticulously
detail a range of attempts to manipulate magicJack's stock, which includes
issuing financial statements in front of a proposed secondary that we feel were
fictitious when compared to the corresponding quarterly filings with the SEC.
After announcing a secondary offering, the company proceeded to cancel the
offering a week later. A buyback was then announced, followed by a
misleading rights offering (in conjunction with a buyback nonetheless) that
was subsequently cancelled two week later after altering the terms in the
interim. Several promotional press releases intended to squeeze shorts
contained financials that failed to reconcile with the results filed in subsequent
quarterly filings.


5) Back in time: Tel-Save.com's market chicanery - We detail the
amazing similarities between magicJack and Borislow's first company, Tel-
Save.com. At Tel-Save, Borislow issued numerous promotional press releases
concerning a process to sell the entire company. The process was ultimately
cancelled; an acquisition was announced of a company that was run by a
convicted cocaine dealer - only to be cancelled a week later, and an
encouraging buyback ensued. After buying back nearly $200 million of stock,
Borislow announced just six weeks later a massive secondary offering. In less
than a year, the stock fell nearly 80% from the "public sale" announcement to
the secondary stock sale announcement. Borislow unceremoniously resigned
and Tel-Save was ultimately purchased for a price 90% below where it was
when the company first announced it was for sale.


6) Financial shenanigans, every shade of slimy - Beyond the misleading
and promotional press releases, magicJack has used accounting gimmicks to
create a myriad of unsustainable earnings. We show that magicJack issued a
press release with financial tables that overstated revenue and earnings by $4
million compared to the tables presented in quarterly SEC filings. In the first
quarter, 39% of earnings were attributable to a change in revenue recognition
on prepaid minutes. The company has somehow generated as much as a 30%
return on its marketable securities, which we believe are invested in a highly
unconventional manner. In the 10Q for Q3'12, the company confesses it has
actually been using short sales as part of its investment strategy, which may
have overstated cash on the balance sheet. The company also paid its CEO
$1.1 million for a "one-time investment advisory fee." Additionally, magicJack
has used allowance for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments to aid

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1436471-magicjack-vocaltec-call-accounting-illusions-vanishing-financials-and-a-dark-history


earnings. In Q3'12, as a percentage of revenue, this ratio fell 80% year-over-
year. We also illustrate an aggressive change in the depreciation schedule for
switches, with the company's estimate of useful life going from 3 years to 10-
15 years.


7) Moving beyond shenanigans and into erroneous financial reporting
- In our opinion magicJack has repeatedly released financial tables in press
releases that overstate what is presented in quarterly SEC filings. We detail
how the cash flow table presented to investors in the earnings press release
overstated cash flow by 23% when compared to the statements filed with the
SEC just one week later.


8) An Inventory Reserve fudge or lying to the SEC and investing public
- which is worse? - magicJack blamed a large Q3'12 inventory write-down on
excess chips that were ordered after the Japanese Tsunami. This appears to be
dishonest as raw material inventory increased while finished goods inventory
saw a significant decrease - suggesting it was actually magicJack units that
were written down. Further, the write-down occurred nearly 18 months after
the tsunami and magicJack has filed SEC documents that claim the company's
retail inventory turns are only 30 days. The company also implies in a press
release that contra revenues were recorded in Q3'12, which could suggest
retailers are returning product to magicJack.


9) Using put options for earnings and more misrepresentations - the
company has used an esoteric put option strategy that has systematically
overstated reported net earnings when compared to operating earnings. In
response to a critical Wall Street Journal article, the company appears to have
violated the Securities Act by failing to adhere to SEC guideline Item 8.01 on
other events by issuing a blatantly misleading 8K that made inaccurate and
reckless statements ("registrants should have due regard for the accuracy,
completeness and currency of the information in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act which incorporate by reference information in reports
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, including reports on this form [8K]").[iii]


10) A massive undisclosed liability in a damaging undisclosed lawsuit -
Madison County has sued magicJack for failing to collect and remit 911 fees
from its customers. The lawsuit alleges that magicJack has created multiple
corporate shells to avoid collections and could have liabilities that exceed the
cash on its balance. The lawsuit, which contends magicJack's actions were

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1436471-magicjack-vocaltec-call-accounting-illusions-vanishing-financials-and-a-dark-history


"negligent, grossly negligent, or reckless" could have a materially adverse
effect on magicJack's business, operating results, and cash flow. Despite the
potential materiality, magicJack has not yet disclosed this lawsuit.


11) A deceit-riddled 8K with related party sales and mysterious
shareholders - Dan Borislow disclosed in an 8K in May (late on a Friday after
the market closed) that he had sold stock at a 30% discount to several other
shareholders. We believe the SEC may view the 8K as a blatant example of
securities fraud because it contained false statements and misleading context.
The stock was sold because Borislow had used his common equity on margin
as collateral for debt. Despite stating in the 8K he would no longer use his
stock as collateral, he once again had to release shares used as collateral
against personal debt just seven months later. A careful examination of the
Form 4's and beneficial ownership from the proxy suggests that Borislow
mischaracterized his share sales as well. Assuming the public filings are
accurate, the 5 buyers referred to in the 8K can not exist as holders to the
same degree Borislow claimed.


12) Who is Menachem Goldstone, also known as Michael Goldstone? -
At Borislow's first company, a shareholder named Menachem Goldstone was
listed as a consultant. He was also the owner of a company called Eastern
Telecommunications, which was bought by Tel-Save.com's large reseller, Group
Long Distance (NYSEARCA:GLD). Goldstone's small telco controlled 1.34
million warrants in Borislow's company that were then transferred to the
current magicJack CFO's company upon the acquisition. Inexplicably,
Goldstone was listed in a Tel-Save.com 10K as having been issued 500,000
shares of Borislow's company's stock "in connection with a settlement."
Goldstone appears in magicJack's beneficial ownership table as being the
second largest shareholder, and was previously listed simply as "consultant."
The description of his affiliation with the company changed, and for an
unknown reason, so did his name in magicJack's 2011 10K. Despite no
description or details on Goldstone in magicJack's filings, his mailing address is
listed as the exact same as Borislow's in his 13G - which happens to be
magicJack's U.S. headquarters.


13) A possible motivation for accounting shenanigans & material
misinformation? - The Board has blessed a share grant for Borislow that
creates completely perverse incentives to take material risks to drive a one-

time earnings number in 2012. The bonus accrual for Borislow's compensation
in the earnings release does not reconcile with the information in the 10Q.


14) The basic business and financial model - neither can survive -
magicJack has benefitted from a one-time 50% price increase that appears to
have pulled new sales and renewals into Q1'12. Since the one-time sales
benefit, cash bookings have collapsed by 44%. The company seems to operate
with incredible efficiency, generating nearly 3x the revenue/employee as a
broad peer group. Yet, for a high tech company, R&D is non-existent and has
actually declined year-over-year despite purported investments in a new
product, magicJack Wi-Fi. The company spent ZERO capex in Q1'12 and
Q3'12, and has only spent $217,000 in total capex during the first nine
months of 2012. Finally, we believe the company may be incorrectly
accounting for any magicJack Wi-Fi development expenses (assuming there
are any).


15) The marketing jingle vs. real customer reviews - Despite claims of
unparalleled voice quality, a broad review of consumer complaints paints a
very negative consumer perception towards magicJack. With over 3,498
complaints with the Better Business Bureau alone, magicJack has recently
been accused of continuing to charge customers after they claim to have
cancelled their service.


16) Using history as a guide, the final bag holding act has already
begun - Borislow resigned from Tel-Save.com and proceeded to enter into
several egregious agreements with his former company. Based on public
records, he transferred most of his Tel-Save (OTC:TALK) stock to trusts that
sold the stock and bought TALK bonds. He then terminated a voting trust
arrangement and resigned along with his spouse as directors of his foundation.
We believe this action permitted the Trustee to sell his stock outside the
purview of Insider/Director reporting requirements. On December 28, 2012,
Borislow resigned as CEO and Chairman of magicJack. On the same day his
resignation was announced, he established two trusts and "gifted" 2,250,000
shares to these trusts (one of which was called "DB"). The Trustee is Mark
Pavol, who claims to be the COO of magicJack.[iv] The company does not once
reference Mr. Pavol in its most recent 10K or proxy. Mr. Pavol was the same

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/1436471-magicjack-vocaltec-call-accounting-illusions-vanishing-financials-and-a-dark-history


Trustee for Borislow's previous trusts that were used to liquidate his Tel-
Save.com stock. It seems reasonable to assume a nearly identical roadmap is
being followed to liquidate his magicJack (CALL).


17) The new CEO - Gerald Vento was named CEO to replace Borislow.
Besides being based in Boston, while magicJack is based in West Palm Beach,
it is also odd that he previously lived a few miles away from Borislow and
bought stock directly from Borislow at a 30% discount. Vento was accused of
accepting secret bribes while at TeleCorp and never disclosing the "secret
deals" to shareholders or TeleCorp's Board. While the detailed claims against
him in a shareholder lawsuit may be without merit, 8 former TeleCorp
executives (including Vento) and AT&T settled for $47.5 million to ensure the
suit did not go to trial.


18) Fair Value is $4.95 - $7.15 - Borislow's parting words on his departure
call were, "I really don't know why this won't be a $100 stock in the next 12
months." We disagree. Normalizing magicJack's earnings for all of the
shenanigans, we believe a more reasonable annual earnings run-rate is
approximately $0.55 per share. Using several scenarios based on different
comp sets, CALL's existing multiple, and its closest competitor Vonage, we
arrive at fair value as much as 70% below where the stock is currently trading.

How many times can this firm go to the
well with their obvious attempt to pump a
short selling frenzy? Google their
name,they always have some whacky
allegations but the allegations never seem
to amount to anything and the S/P always
seems to bounce back. I would actually
ask if they consider themselves actual

you've filed and the results of the

I don't think you know much about the

works. Re-read the report would be a good
place to start.

MagicJack will compete given the rapid
evolution of mobile technology and the
pittance CALL has budgeted for keeping
up*?


As an example of their reluctance to
spend building a business (instead of
financial gimmicks like stock buybacks)
their promise to have a wifi version of
MJ on the market by last Fall came and
went unfulfilled. Obviously they're a
little short on the engineering staff.
Even now there's no launch date for this
feature already available on their
competitor netTalk's VOIP gadget
(whom MJ tried unsuccessfully to sue
for patent infringement telling you a lot
about the strength of VocalTech's patent
portfolio).

PONZI SCHEME - all day long.


Do the math:


1.) DID cost per month 
2.) 911 cost per month 
3.) Termination costs per minute 
4.) Network costs 
5.) Over head: salaries, customer service
as minimal as it is, etc. 
6.) Paying 40% to retailers (or more) to
sell the units off the shelf 
7.) TV ads


There is NO ads on the product, never has
been. 
So the entire amount of revenue comes
from MJ sales period.

Who is selling 5000 shares of Call Magic
Jack two minutes after the market closes
every night? Then does not show up on
trading list next day.


See how many shares Dan Borislow has
sold in last !2 months and how few shares
other directors now own having sold most
off.


that tells the story!

Has anyone else figured out that the
executives of company have sold off over
$65 million dollars worth of shares in this
company in 2012?


Vento running it, now only owns a couple
of million dollars worth of shares? They are
leaving shareholders holding the bag and
they are all out!!


Borislow sold over $40 million dollars
worth, then transferred stock to a blind
trust so he could sell off more through his
family. Nice scam!!!
