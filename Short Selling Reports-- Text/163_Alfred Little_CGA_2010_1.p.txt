12 Signs and 158 Reasons Investors Should Avoid Chinese RTO
Stocks
Aug. 31, 2010 4:03 AM ET59 comments
by: Alfred Little


In an article titled "Beware this Chinese Export" featured in this week's Barron's magazine,
author Leslie Norton analyzed 158 Chinese companies that obtained their U.S. share
listing via reverse merger and discovered that the median company’s share price
underperformed the Halter USX CHINA Index by an astonishing 75% in the first three
years of trading, resulting in large losses for investors in these companies.


The USX CHINA index itself is down 15% in the three years ending August 27, 2010.
Losses to reverse merger investors are truly staggering, begging the question why anyone
invests in them at all. Fortunately, Leslie goes into great detail explaining all the problems
with these investments. Her analysis is in fact very similar to my own.


I have found that there are at least 12 predictive factors associated with the poor share
price performance:


1. Unscrupulous stock promoters behind the reverse mergers
2. Revenue disappointments and earnings restatements
3. Drastic divergence between financials filed with the U.S. SEC and Chinese regulators
4. Huge cash and shares fees paid to middlemen
5. Huge dilutive warrant shares granted to Preferred investors such as Pinnacle and


Barron
6. Auditors such as Kabani and Frazer Furth with very poor track records
7. Complete inability of the SEC to oversee firms with foreign operations
8. Lack of any oversight of the U.S. listings by Chinese regulators
9. Lack of due diligence by investors and bankers who often subsequently find the


Chinese operations don’t measure up to descriptions in placement offerings
10. Management theft and misuse of proceeds from share issuances
11. Complete inability of U.S. investors to recoup losses from unscrupulous companies


and promoters under U.S. and Chinese law.
12. Lack of any effective corporate governance


Among many companies mentioned in the article, recent notably poor performers include
OTC:CHNG, OTC:FEED, ONP, and OTC:RINO. The riskiest stock featured in
considerable detail in the article is China Green Agriculture (NYSE: CGA). CGA’s

investors suffer from nearly all of the 12 poor share price performance predictive factors
mentioned above. Additionally, as I mentioned last week, CGA is the subject of an
extremely negative and incredibly detailed due diligence report just released for clients of
the International Financial Research & Analysis Group (IFRA). The report exhaustively
documents in over 100 pages that:


1. Almost $15M VAT tax accrued by CGA over the past two years was never paid to the
chinese tax authority, which collected only about $68k cash. Moreover, why did CGA
accrue so much VAT when the law says they are exempt? This discrepancy exposes a
$15M hole in the balance sheet.


2. $2.8M corporate income tax CGA says it paid in calendar year 2009 was likewise
never received and recorded by the government authority. "Where did the money go?"
the report asks.


3. $10.7M CGA reported it paid for greenhouse land last September was overstated by
4X. Multiple official documents show only $2.5M paid resulting in another big hole in
the balance sheet.


4. For calendar year 2007 and 2008, SEC filings show Jinong sales of $14.8M and
$22.9M, but government records show only $6.6M and $7.8M. Chairman Li personally
signed off on both records. Chinese and U.S. accounting rules are slightly different, but
the discrepancy here is huge.


5. For calendar year 2007 and 2008, SEC filings show Jinong net income of $7M and
$9.7M, but government records show only $1.1M and $1.3M. Once again Chairman Li
personally signed both records.


6. CGA's U.S. auditor Kabani & Company has only one other sizable client in China
(LLEN); unfortunately Kabani used to audit Bodisen Biotech, which strangely enough
is based in the same high tech park as CGA in Xian. Bodisen was a huge scandal.
Kabani therefore can’t be trusted to do good work.


7. IFRA shows that the Beijing Gufeng acquisition price tag is outrageous. They calculate
the total cost could be $48M USD, pointing out that in addition to the $33M
cash+equity purchase price there is another $14.7M in working capital that CGA is
required to contribute to keep Gufeng afloat. Incredibly, according to Chinese
government filings Gufeng lost money in 2009 and only turned a small profit in prior
years. The acquisition price is insane. Where is the price paid really going?


Note: Scanned copies of the key sections of the IFRA report can be downloaded in
several pieces here.

Conclusion: Leslie Norton did the best job to date detailing the serious problems with
Chinese to U.S. reverse merger companies. The solution is not more regulation, but
simply for investors to do their homework and steer clear of companies that exhibit more
than a couple of the predictive factors associated with poor share price performance. In
fact, if investors don’t invest, the companies, promoters and bankers will have to clean up
their acts to attract capital. No regulator holds more power than the power of investors
who refuse to invest.


Perhaps this article, combined with low investor attendance at Roth Capital’s China stock
conference this week in Maui and continued declines in stocks like CGA, will be enough to
spur real change. I wrote a summary of the change needed on my blog on August 22.

Thank you for highlighting these visible problems in investing in Chinese enterprises. Western investors used to
regulatory oversight and disciplined market practices should exercise caution when considering Chinese firms within
the Communist ambit. Yours is a timely reminder.

The Barron's article is fish feed for short sellers on US-listed Chinese stocks. The article has strong biases built in:  
Bias 1 - Time after the time, the article quoted that Chinese smallcaps underperformed. However, much of the
statistics quoted failed to mention the spectacular run of Chinese small caps from March 2009 to Jan 2010. It simply
quoted the recent down of those stocks.


Bias 2 - Only quotes the bad part of a stock. The ONP fiasco is well documented. The article only quoted "Muddy
Waters" stands behind the story, and there are no comments from ONP/IR/Lawyers. It does not say anything from the

5/18/2018 12 Signs and 158 Reasons Investors Should Avoid Chinese RTO Stocks | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/223026-12-signs-and-158-reasons-investors-should-avoid-chinese-rto-stocks 4/21


counter points. It does not even mention that those two MW researchers have no financial background, and recently
"moved on" after the taking the profits from the short position.


Bias 3 - Much of the story focuses on the promoters and a few "Wall Street" investment bankers/IR firms. It does not
distinguish the dealers from the managers of the company. It assumes that all promoters of the Chinese stocks are
bad, and the companies, by association, are therefore bad.


Bias 4 - It is an undeniable fact that a large number of reverse mergers are bad deals for all both the original Chinese
owners and early investors, including retail investors who bought such a stock before it could develop a life of its own
out of the early stage. Of course a pool of such stocks will perform worse when compared to an index of established
names, that is not a surprise and not China specific.


The final conclusion could be that the authors used deceptive argumentation to bolster their desired conclusion. They
forgot to mention that we had a massive downturn in late 2007, the same time that most of these companies entered
the U.S. equity markets. In that downturn, stocks perceived to be riskier performed exponentially worse than the
overall market. OTC/pink stocks, which comprise most of the Chinese RTO's and are perceived to be the riskiest of all
asset classes, performed the worst of all.


The proper comparison would be to compare Chinese RTO's with other OTC/pink stocks that were born at the same
time.

Nit picking twit.


Every argument about these miserable stocks seems to be focused on your ability to string together some
series of explanations that cast doubt on the article that is critical of your position.


The Barron's article made three very large points which you want to waltz around. 
1. A large number of Chinese RTO's are the spawn of convicted fraudulent operators and their names and
associations appear commonly throughout the segment. 
2. Much of the excuse to ignore the risks of investing in these flimsy constructs has been the promise of
outsize returns. Barron's uses several examples to show that recent performance has been trailing the
market. 
3. After detailing several examples of suspect companies, Barron's suggests that the sector is fraught with
risk and investors should be very cautious.


Your great contribution is to distort the theme of what Barron's publishes and suggest that they were writing
about past performance results for several money management techniques. The story is not a review, it is a
warning. These companies are frauds. If you have your money in these shares you are assuming inordinate
risk and should carefully reexamine that decision.

Excellent points. As a long-term investors in Chinese sectors, we have been profitable so far. The biggest
challenges so far we come across is not the risk of the Chinese companies, a lot of which are hidden gems
and we did very thorough research, but the problems of short sellers like Muddy Waters and negativity and
bias towards Chinese companies.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Fair enough. I suspect other RTO's also significantly underperformed more established
companies. Fraud is probably just as common for US company RTO's. But nevertheless you can't deny that
75% underperformance is a pretty good reason to avoid the whole sector.

That is actually the good part of investing in Chinese company. They report to SEC with actual earning but do
something difference to the Chinese government, Every company in China always try to hide the profit and revenue to
avoid tax to keep the money in the company. That is a common practise even for the state own company. I worked for
a state own company and we all know that the company do a good job to keep the tax money in the company. strange
to US investor, but very very common to Chinese investor.

softlander1029
If the money indeed stayed in the company, it'd be a great thing. But most of these small Chinese companies
still reported full amount of income taxes at a regular rate of 25%. This tells you the money that didn't go to
the tax man went somewhere else instead of staying in the company. This really didn't benefit the US
shareholders. Also, I think if you avoided taxes by hiding revenues or profits, you're still required to show the
amount as some future liabilities on your balance sheet. As far as I've heard, no auditor will sign off on the
books of companies that didn't pay taxes based on local laws.


I agree that we shouldn't avoid Chinese stocks once for all, the ones mentioned by Barron's are the selective
fews that were most corrupt. I'm still long a couple of Chinese stocks that went public through a traditional
IPO. No dirty stuff like ones mentioned in the Barron's has been found with them. EDU is the my top
performer so far and it doesn't have any history with any kind of corrupt stock promoters.

Hmmm??? Chinese tax authorities were not aware of the common tax evasion practice and did not compare
their filings to SEC filings? I do to detect fraud.

If the companies are willing to commit fraud against tax authorities, chances are they are willing to commit
fraud against retail investor.

Alfred, you started as an accountant at DTT. Could you comment on their procedures during an audit (of a China
company for example)? Obviously they do the simple cash-in-bank check but do auditors also compare SAT taxes
paid with filings? It seems weird they would ever sign off on a 10-K if the SAT documents did not match the SEC
filings within some reasonable 'measure of error' due to different accounting-practices.


Did auditors at DTT have to go on-site for a company audit? Speak to clients and employees? etc...

Mr. GroundZeroChina
This is an abstract from Andy Xie's most recent artcile,it can show you why china real estate is degenerating into a
tool to steal state fund from state bank : 
The inflation has so far occurred mostly in land and commodities. The land price has increased by over ten times
since 2002, thirty times in some hot coastal cities, and over one hundred times in the most speculative areas. For
example, in many villages in Zhejiang Province, the land price has risen above 10 yuan per million mu to 100 times
the price a decade ago. Even though the land is rezoned for urban use, the price can't be justified under any
circumstance. It is nearly ten times the average land price in Britain for urban use. Britain's urban land prices are the
highest among all major developed economies. It is reasonable to believe that China's land price is the highest
among than all the major economies today, even though China's average wage is one tenth of the developed
countries'. 
The increasingly inflated land prices have shown up in the nominal GDP through rising property sales to over 14
percent of GDP last year. Moreover, so much investment has occurred due to the collateral value of land. Local
governments have borrowed enormous amount of money (probably around 17 percent of total bank lending) to fund
or subsidize investment for creating GDP. The loans are secured with land. Without the high land price it is impossible
for this source of financing to be possible. As fixed investment is close to half of GDP and driven by government, it is
easy to understand how the land bubble has accounted for a big part of the growth in this cycle. 
Recent manufacturing investment, for example, is partly due to high land price. Local governments have been
competing fiercely for manufacturing investment. Many companies have learnt to exact so much benefit from local
governments that they put down no equity capital for investment. They often ask for free land and use the land as
collateral for a bank loan. They then lease equipment from the manufacturers that obtain bank loans for the leases.
Essentially, the equity capital is from the land donated by the government. This explains why so many companies
have always had negative net cash flow but keep expanding. Indeed, expansion is critical to their survival, as they
need new investment to bring in cash to sustain themselves. 
Profit drives investment that in turn powers employment that then grows consumption. When profit is due to asset
appreciation and not sustainable, it can lead to crisis. Large bubbles often occur during prolonged prosperity. People
stop paying attention to risk and have excessive demand risk assets. It leads to an asset bubble that prolongs
prosperity beyond the normal cycle time length. The more overextended the cycle, the more pain in adjustment after
the bubble bursts.

Possibly half of China's bank lending is to the property related businesses or local governments that pledge land as
collateral. While the current boom has catapulted China ahead of Japan as the world's second-largest economy, we
must remember the excesses in this cycle and the need for an adjustment as soon as possible. Nothing reveals the
vulnerabilities more than the banking system's exposure to unsustainable economic activities that depend on land
appreciation. China should proactively bring about the needed economic adjustment.


according to my own research and analysis of china A share listed companies and domestic SME, majority of firms
are working with local government to get free land under the name of setting up factory, build" manufacting ,trade
zone" " culture, tourist site" ,set "green technology"and high technology zone, then pledged this often low price land to
the bank to obtain the massive amount of loan. 
of course, most of these development site can not generate enough cash flow at all to pay back the loan, as a result,
most of the site are abondoned and left to rusty. they are just trying everything to delay the inevitable collapse. it is
also the reason why many insiders said that the china banking system have already bankrupted many times over and
now it can not afford to stop to lend , or even recall the old loan, if they recall the old loan, those domestic firms can
not pay at all. then whole system will collapse, that is truth of china banking system.

In case you are interested, I wrote an article on the SAIC vs SEC issue. geoinvesting.com/forum...


To you points,


First, you must be aware of when SAIC files may be a first step in your investigations and when they can not.


Two, How many firms that you track missed their financial guidance.


Three, I think your conclusion is accurate. Space has to be purified, so that the quality firms can see multiple
expansion.

Author’s reply »  Maj,


That's a great article you wrote. I am concerned that in fact you will find over the course of your research that
there IS large scale fraud in these RTO's reported financial results. I'm eager to see what you learn.


Of course SAT records are better than SAIC, but like you say hard to get. That is why the case against CGA
is so strong. IFRA guys got SAT records showing CGA never paid any VAT. That is the strongest evidence
ever that a company's sales are exaggerated.


best luck,

One concern about the Chinese RTO space is that I have always wondered how shareholders can ultimately extract
value from their shares. For American companies, they usually come in the form of dividends, share buy backs, or if
the company is liquidated at the end. If a company is undervalued, these actions can often be forced by activist hedge
funds.


However, I have heard many different things about Chinese RTOs and dividends, and how it is difficult for them to
send money out of China. Look at what happened to SIAF after they paid a penny dividend, their stock rocketed. I
think the RTO space would get a lot more credibility if these companies start paying a very tiny dividend or if they do
some stock buybacks. Even though it is not the most efficient use of capital for a growth company, it is better for a
company to demonstrate that they can and will realize intrinsic value for investors. That would result in a higher
multiple for the company and they can raise capital at favorable prices. Dividend and stock buybacks are also the best
evidence that the company is real, because a company must be earning money to do those things.


If there is no way for investors to realize value, why should people buy the stock even if it is trading at low single digit
multiples? Maybe someone who knows more about Chinese RTOs can clarify this for me. For American stocks, if a
good company ever gets that cheap, a private equity firm would take it private or activist hedge fund will likely do
something to realize the value. Or the company would do a stock buyback. Or investors can sit back and collect
dividends. What can happen with these Chinese RTOs to realize value? Does anybody have any examples of RTOs
with dividends or buybacks?

Valid points regarding investing in Chinese stocks. However I don't believe the average individual investor
looks at whether a company will eventually do a buyback or liquidate when looking at stocks (hopefully the
thought of a company having to liquidate its assets would not be one of the things you're looking at when
trying to decide whether or not to invest in a company!); they might take a look at whether a company pays
out dividends, though - especially if they're looking to invest long-term. Mainly, a person looks at whether or
not they think this company is one with perceived value. That's what it mainly comes down to - the perception
of whether a company is a good value at any given price and if it has the potential to be the next Google,
Apple, or Netflix, to name a few. These aforementioned companies don't pay out dividends, yet investors still
buy these stocks. Actually, there are less companies now that pay out dividends than there were 10-15 years
ago. The only way investors "extract" value is by hopefully selling their shares at a profit, regardless of how
they do it - whether by long-term investing or by shorting it. That's the main reason why most people purchase
any stocks, regardless of whether it's an American company or Chinese or any other country. Then again, I

might be wrong. Maybe you have a different reason for purchasing stocks, for something other that selling it
at a profit.


31 Aug 2010, 01:27 PM

Often, value investors buy stocks with liquidation in mind. Early in Warren Buffett's career, he brought stocks
that traded below liquidation value. In theory, big companies like GE, Microsoft, JNJ, etc, can be chopped up
and have their individual divisions sold. And it happens very often too - companies spin off certain arms, etc.


You can bet that if Apple were to trade at $20 instead of $200+, a big player will buy it up completely. With
Chinese RTOs, the rights of the shareholder isn't very clear (maybe it is and someone who knows can explain
it to me). Can a foreign guy take over a Chinese RTO? Can a foreign guy boot out existing leadership and
install his own CEO? As a retail investor, we can't do much, but it helps that if a stock becomes too
undervalued, some hedge fund or Wall Street firm will eventually notice and jump in (and the retail guys get to
ride along) to take action. I've never seen anything like this happen with a Chinese RTO yet. Is it even
possible? If shareholders in RTOs can't do this, do they really own anything?

The value of Chinese growth stocks is realized in the EPS and valuation. When price goes up the value of
each investor's investment is realized.


31 Aug 2010, 07:46 PM


Waldo Mushman
You are opening the pages of a very convoluted story. The explanation used to justify an VIE (Variable
interest entity) structure is due to the fact that the Chinese government precludes foriegn ownership of certain
stategic business activities. Lets use CHNG which is involved in natural gas as the example. American
investors are sold shares in the publicly traded US entity and what they own is a set of contractual rights to
control and at their option purchase the China based operating entity. So the US parent can buy CHNG/china
at a nominal price and control the business. But the threshold reason for the VIE in the first place was to allow
outside participation in a restricted industry. In other words, the option to buy the operating company can
never be exercised because foriegn ownership is prohibited in exactly the industry you have invested in.


It absolutely astounds me that that this fact is lost on investors. The only thing they own is a non-enforceable
claim on off shore assets. The only source of profit is selling that set of promises to a bigger fool.

I think you are missing the point I am trying to make. About the only way any one every "extracts value" from
a stock is by selling the equities at a profit. Even when Warren Buffett bought stocks that were below their
intrinsic value, he did so with the intention of selling them. If he bought stocks but then never sold them, his
wealth would be strictly on paper only. The only way for him to realize his wealth is by selling some of his
stocks for profit.


Back to my question, why do you, as an individual investor, buy stocks? I would assume (dangerous thing to
do - assume) you buy them with the intention of eventually selling them for a profit. Or do you buy stocks and
then just sit on them forever and never sell them?  
If a person thinks Chinese RTO stocks are too risky without any "built-in protection", then that person should
just stay away from them and invest in safer (relatively speaking) stocks. 
The point of this article was to inform, or remind, potential investors of Chinese RTO stocks of the added
risks. Valid points, but fraud can occur in any company.

Small cap China stocks were held and are held by hedge funds. These stocks were destroyed by hedge fund
redemptions or de-leveraging or plain old manipulation. The hedge fund holder risk is what investors need to worry
about.

Excellent article - Many investors have been scammed by reversed China stocks..The scam has gone on far too long. 
Personally, I hope LLEN drops their shabby accounting firm mentioned in the article. One would hope that the addition
of Mineta to the Board this week will expedite the severing of ties to the firm. 
Although LLEN is US based, the company is totally levered to China. 
We shall see !

The Barron's article is deficient in an important respect: it points out that stock values have crashed, without telling us
how the companies themselves have done.


There are many companies that have grown just fine; simply the valuations and P/E ratios have gone south over the
last 3 years, from a P/E of 20 to a P/E of 5.


If you remember: 3 years ago there was a big bubble in Chinese stocks, while today many of these stocks are crazy
cheap. 
So, if Barron's is right that 3 years ago it was dumb to invest in these companies, does that mean that today it is
equally dumb? 
Not necessarily. 
However, I do agree the following issues need to be fixed: 
1. Trustworthy auditing and full disclosure 
2. Related party deals that give insiders special favors  
3. Dilution by giving away tons of stock below market to hedge funds.


I urge all of these companies to hire first rate auditors and go the extra mile to make sure all their business practices
are clean and friendly to investors. 
In the end that's the way to make everybody a winner, companies as well as investors.


Oh, and can we clean up all these VIE corporate structures, already?

ONP is a company listed in this article. Muddy Waters basically destroyed the stock value of this going concern for a
cheap easy short sale profit, after the company refused to be blackmailed into paying for a glowing research report
from them. Since the fall of the stock, the ONP management has done a good job at restoring faith in their company
and have hired a big 4 accounting firm to go over their financial records and refute the allegations the short sellers
made. They are due to report their findings at the end of September or the first part of October. I think they will be
vindicated and their stock is a screaming buy at these ridiculously low valuations and could easily double or triple in
value once the report comes out by Dellouitte. LONG ONP!

AMCF got an IPO at 6,30 $ and NIV at 3,50 $.

I pretty sure tha the novice IFRA group misinterpreted the SAT data and then used SAIC data which they themselves
said was unreliabe. The should ask Kabani or CGA about it.


BTW the Chinese Company Bodisen which the author cites as an example of a "scandal" was thoroughly examined
and was found to be squeaky clean. It won all lawsuits against it.


The CEO of these new companies are inexperienced have not yet wised up to protecting themselves against wild
accusations.

I must say that I am an investor and visit the blogs on this site frequently. I've never felt compelled to add my opinion
to any blog or even sign up, simply because...they're all just opinions. Some are very good, some horrible, most from
inexperienced writers with no true experience in economics, fundamental and technical analysis, and the general
underlying working of the markets.


While I won't disagree with the nature of the article, I cannot believe that Alfred Little, who had 1 follower prior to this
article, 1 post, 4 instablogs, and 7 comments can write an article with this many associated companies without
providing a deeper analysis of them. Obviously some may be definitely applicable to his argument...but where is your
basis on mentioning other companies in this article. Perfect example behind my motivation to question you is the
reference you made to another post you made on another site. It’s crazy comparing your post to this one…when one
vital component of your post is missing…research.


Let’s take one for example; without an absolute doubt in my mind, L&L Energy (LLEN) shouldn’t even be a ticker
mentioned. (This is the only company that I will highlight, but would love to compare notes on all of the others.)


Alfred, I urge you to do a little bit of research on the company, and prove to me, besides an association to the
accounting firm Kabini & Company, that this company is different from the ideal company you would like to see
mentioned on your alternate post. Maybe the scenario that involved CGA had to do with a crooked accountant, or
whatever. But just based on your prior post on the alternative site, this company was added to your article without any
true analysis.


First things first, verbatim from your ‘About Me’ section: "spends his time researching Chinese and other high growth
companies. Having a built a very successful track record investing the last decade, he plans to share his investing
ideas in a newsletter blog he will edit." You appear to be a well educated and experienced accountant at Deloitte, a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/223026-12-signs-and-158-reasons-investors-should-avoid-chinese-rto-stocks 14/21


company that has had several problems with their accounting and consulting practices (Google it). Secondly, are you
a CPA or a consultant? What did you help Coke, P&G, and Budweiser establish in China?


Reason I question you, besides that fact that you trade daily, and mentioned what has recently become a very
actionable segment of the market; you have just slammed every high growth company in the ‘world’s fastest growing
economy’.


I bring up L&L Energy (LLEN) specifically for a couple reasons just on the basis of your previous post about Chinese
related companies: 
A) As an experienced investor, you should know that any company that is placed on the Russell 3000 Index, or any
index for that matter, must…and I repeat must…undergo scrutiny in every aspect to get added. You know that right?


B) Dickson Lee, CPA, is someone that has had an unquestionable successful track record (Google him).


C) Norman Mineta. Unless you are truly a conspiracy theorist, there is no way that this distinguished man, would be
associated with this board. If the company was a CGA, do you think he would jeopardize what he has established for
himself, VP of a $25 billion company (Lockheed Martin), and serving two presidents, to tarnish his name with a $250
million Seattle based coal company?


I’ve written enough here, and am too tired to even speak about the astonishing fundamentals and growth of this
company. I’ll help you out; Redchip (redchip.com) has done an excellent analysis of their bottom line on all levels.
Look for a little more info about the company too. I love to read foreign news posts and use an amazing tool called
‘Google Translate’ to see some of their purchases, and what news is linked to their acquisitions without being
attached to L&L.


Being a “blogger”, or even an analyst for that matter, entails certain indispensable principles when sharing your study.
Doing research, that is accurate, thorough, and displays the integrity of your analysis.


I would love to highlight particulars of the other company’s ticker symbols you listed in your article, but at the risk of
sounding brash, I’d love to question your motivation to write this article after reading your ‘summary of the change
needed’ post. L&L, for instance, fits all the criteria for your ‘perma-bull’ China mindframe.


In conclusion (because I am tired and think I may have lost a little track of thought but made excellent points);
highlighting what you have written as the biggest problem, “In fact if investors don’t invest, the companies, promoters
and bankers will have to clean up their acts to attract capital. No regulator holds more power than the power of
investors who refuse to invest”, you have just done in some small, or major, way (who knows) exactly what you said
was the problem. You have influenced some investors to refuse to acknowledge strong Chinese and US based
Chinese growth companies because of a lack of research.


As labeling yourself as a daily trader, and versed in Chinese business, I highly doubt not having a short or long
position in any of the companies that you’ve mentioned. We should put you on CNBC!


Please retort. (And I apologize for any grammactical or spelling errors; my old age and being up past my bed time
have contributed to that, but this needed to be added.) I would love a response!!

I don't have a clue about LLEN but I can assure you that it is not a good investment for you. Alfred is detailing
some of the trapdoors that litter this playing field. You don't speak Chinese, you aren't in the coal business
and all the assets are located beyond the American legal system.


You obviously have an emotional attachment to the company which is a deadly mistake to begin with and you
compound that error by trusting the names associated with the company. None of whom you have ever met.
The stock has had a major run up, it posts results that at first blush seem preposterously high, the association
with Kabani is a huge red banner, Red Chip is paid to write favorable analysis, and I am betting it has a large
and growing short interest. On the macro scale both the PCAOB and the SEC have publicly expressed
concerns about the audit work done by understaffed firms such as Kabani on Chinese RTOs and will likely
enact regulatory hurdles that will depress the entire sector.


Participation in the China miracle is readily available through companies traded in HK or on the HSE or even
here in the US through ADR's. I am unfamiliar with LLEN's heritage but since we are on this thread I suspect
it is an RTO, with a PIPE, major management ownership that has never sold a share, massive expansion
plans, once a month PR releases, and margins that are twice what any other competitor anywhere in the
world has ever achieved in the history of man. As the punchline in the old joke goes, "Aren't you a little old to
believe in Leprechauns."


Very simple to get a $60.00 credit report and see what is being reported in China. More importantly though is
the question of why in God's green earth are you speculating in small cap flyers? The concern that is
transparent in your post argues very strongly that you are not in sleep well mode and you should be. Call me
crazy, but consider enjoying the money.

Author’s reply »  JVicks,


Waldo is right as usual. Do a little deeper search on Dickson Lee and you will see his scary past with
Washington state securities violations for peddling stocks illegally. He was lucky enough to avoid being
banned from the securities industries for life after he paid a significant fine.


The problem with L&L (NASDAQ: LLEN) is that coal mines are expensive in China. Return on invested capital
is very low. Yet somehow Dickson always has gotten an amazing deal on his acquisitions.


Just too good to be true. I am sure Waldo will soon find the SAIC figures aren't even close to matching.


As to my experience, it is ancient history and irrelevant to the situation facing investors in Chinese U.S. listed
stocks today. The problems are so intractable I won't even try. I just rely on the good work from groups like
IFRA.

JVicks
Wow...I should've been a lawyer.


Waldo, you didn't answer my 3 questions? You brought it to where I said that I wouldn't speak about.


"I don't have a clue about LLEN" is enough for me.


I'll add more to this later on when I have a moment...


A) Expressed concerns are great and all but...the SEC, whatever. A small accounting firm would be dismantled with
lawsuits if it was involved in any type of continued bad practice. Lawyers are predators now in anything related to the
financials of public companies. Ask Mr. Little about lawsuits associated with bad practices. Deloitte as well as many
others are sued all the time. Unfortunately they're a small firm so immediately there are labeled.


B) The industry- read the journal, economist, do some research on coal consumption. Emerging markets use coal as
a cheaper form of energy...hence the reason China has gotten the hands out of the pot so to speak on the steel, coal,
and car industries. The Chinese Consolidation Policy that was introduced in 2008. That was talked about in the
journal again.


But whatever, I'm not talking about that. You are exactly what my problem was and obviously you were a little more
passionate about writing something you know nothing about. Answer my three common sense questions. Index
addition, political figure attachment with a history that is one of a kind, and an accountant himself without a flaw.
Common sense questions. Nothing extravagant.


You just answered something with the same prejudice of the original article, that again, completely negated another
posting he made elsewhere. You had an extreme overreaction to a post that: 
A) You know nothing about...clearly stated by not doing research on the company. 
B) Assuming you know I don't know what I'm talking about. I love making money...more importantly...SAVING
MONEY. 
C) I have a great understanding of the ecopolitical environment that plays a major role in PBC's here and abroad. 
D) I would never propose an argument about something I don't know about.


Please...do some research. You can even spend the $60 and I'll reimburse you. And if you're ever in the NY/NJ area
and play golf...let's go and we'll teach each other a thing or two.


But...to reinforce my argument...Mr. Little-respond please. And Mr. Waldo-do some research. That's it. I'm enjoying my
old age. But I really look forward to your retorts.


03 Sep 2010, 10:25 AM


Waldo Mushman
Your comments led me to do some research.


As of this morning I have opened a short position in LLEN and ordered initial research. I will increase my
short as I reach metaphysical certainty that the company is presenting fraudulent information. I also need to
satisfy myself that the actual operations will not support the company without the infusion of more capital.


At this point in time I am still unprepared to discuss the company with any authority and I will post my
criticisms on a relevant thread, when and if I delevop any.

In response to your points - 
A.) Auditors have been virtually immune to 10(b)5 actions. The standard has been a plaintiff proving that the
auditor actively aided and abetted the commission of the fraud. That standard was expanded recently
(appellate case) and now envisions "a duty to correct" provision that brings auditors directly into the mix for
the first time. (Overton vs Todman). I have done and have paid for extensive legal research on the topic and
you are wrong regarding both the liability and the likelihood of being sued. "Reasonable reliance" has been
the effective shelter of choice. 
B.) The macro themes behind the stories are always compelling. That is the threshold condition before you
can peddle a dream. No one sacrifices their oldest son for a used Buick, but if the lord above offers eternal
salvation, Junior had better run. Coal is not going to be a point of contention. LLEN's revenues and profits will
be.


Congratulations on what has clearly resulted in a satisfied life. We all aspire to enjoying the time given to us. I
would strongly disagree about money. At this stage of life (I am 61) spending money is far more rewarding
than saving it.

Waldo...I appreciate your non-prejudiced response to an easily debatable topic.


You are truly an individual to be looked up to and seem well versed.


We will just have to wait and see.


Your macro themed contention is great, except with emerging economies. Paul Krugman, arguably one of the best
economists, proved that different strategies such as China's approach towards its own basic materials and energies is
essential. Coal is an absolute industry for some great competition which will definitely lead to a need for more capital
within L&L strategy as well as other competitors.


"Reasonable reliance"...I love that you brought it up and love that you've spent a great deal of money on
understanding the concept.


May I ask, based on your experience with the market, when and how can a company be added to an index. What is
the process?


Being that every side of an argument can be defended, what is your assessment of Dickson Lee and Norman Mineta?


Our ideas differ greatly about money...as you may feel your life is ending...I always worry about the lives of those
important to me. A topic that means nothing to the related article.

now ~$0.50 (50-cents/share). That's a heck of a track record...

Is there an easy way to determine if a Chinese listing is an RTO or is this information buried in the original new issue
prospectus that was issued several years ago? Even if the IPO prospectus was the only document where the reverse
takeover was disclosed, knowing this fact would help identify such a company. Is the prospectus required to be filed
with SEC and if so, could it be searched for keywords to identify an RTO? If so, what would be such keywords, say for
example "reverse takeover"? It would be great to have an easy way to identify an RTO to help with the elimination
process and find deserving Chinese companies with serious and honest management.


19 Sep 2010, 06:05 PM


CSMhater
The easiest way to tell if a Chinese listing is a RTO vs. an ADR is by the type of SEC form they file.


10-K/10-Q => RTO (Just like any American company, since they have technically become an American
company via "reverse acquisition" - usually stated in Company History in SEC filing)


20-F => ADR (At least for level 2 and 3 ADR's. They are required to file 20-F form filings - these are basically
the equivalent of 10-K filings. However, level 1 ADR's are not currently required to file a 20-F filing and can
only be traded on the OTC market and are not required to issue quarterly or annual reports in accordance
with U.S. GAAP.)


Hope this helps.


19 Sep 2010, 11:21 PM


Waldo Mushman
Easiest way to avoid the RTO's and freakish variations on the theme is to limit yourself to ADRs of Chinese issues
traded in HK or Shanghai. If its not an ADR presume its garbage. You'll be right about 80% of the time.

Tx for the advice CSMHater, Waldo. It is ironic that in the particular case of reverse mergers, the required SEC filings
are an adverse implication. Usually if a company has to abide by the full US financial disclosure rules, its considered
to be a safer investment. One thing I noticed, some of the Chinese companies have respected funds such as
Renaissance Technologies, Heartland Advisors as investors, maybe even in some reverse mergers. Those guys arent
throwing their money away. They must be doing good due diligence.


20 Sep 2010, 11:06 AM


Waldo Mushman
Not to be unkind, but if you think any of the institutions are so wise and diligent then you need to put your money in
their funds.


You are unfamilar with the terms they acquired the stock under, whether they have hedges in place, what the current
opinion is, or the research they did before entering the position. Riding coattails is rarely a successful outsiders
strategy when you don't have the goals, information, or basis the other guy has.


John


20 Sep 2010, 12:13 PM


sikako?
I have also noted that Rentec owned a lot of Chinese RTO's as of 12/31/10.


I wouldn't be surprised if the Rentec's trading system does one of the two following things or both:


1) Assumes that the SEC filed financials are correct with the same probability as in the whole sample


2) Buys any sort of beaten down stocks for a temporary bounce around the quarter and year ends


04 Apr 2011, 11:49 PM


ebeng
Institutions actions is only one of many things I look for evaluating stocks. Blindly mimicking them wouldnt make
sense because of the reasons you cited. And also many of them are much less careful with their money, because
they have so much of it, because they have been fleecing investors so easily with exorbitant fees. Having hedges
against a position in itself shouldnt be a negative. An individual investor should also hedge, especially by not putting
too many eggs in the same basket. Heartland is a long term investor. While Renaissance has the flagship hedge
funds, they also have regular mutual fund-like entities. If they have been buying over several years, increasing their
position it is a positive sign.

an outside firm, that is looking for reasons (so called evidence or proof of fraud) to be used to run down a company so
they can make money shorting the stock, would have any better insight into finding evidence of fraud than an auditor
with full access to inside information that an outsider would not have, would have a better picture of whether or not the
company was somehow defrauding investors, unless the audit firm is also in on the fraud!!!!!!


For now, I choose to believe that most of the auditors are not frauds, and thus most of the China RTOs are not frauds.


That does not mean I believe they are all good investments!
