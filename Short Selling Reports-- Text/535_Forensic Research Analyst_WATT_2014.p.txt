WATT? 'Be Prepared To Lose All Of Your Investment'
Jul. 30, 2014 11:56 AM ET55 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


WATT's wireless charging technology is unlikely to reach commercial feasibility in
the foreseeable future given lack of capital investment, regulatory barriers, and
technology hurdles.


While WATT's expense base is growing, its business model is not expected to
generate revenue anytime soon.


Barring an improbable technology breakthrough, the company may face insolvency
without future rounds of equity dilution.


WATT's equity has been pumped up and may face strong selling pressure when the
IPO lock-up expires in two months. Insiders have made tremendous returns on
paper.


Outperforming even GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) as the best-performing IPO of the 2014
vintage, Energous Corp. (NASDAQ:WATT) has seen its share price more than double in
less than four months of trading. Even more impressive, since the company was seeded
with $10,000 out of WATT founder Michael Leabman's parents' house in October, 2012,
the value of that initial investment has skyrocketed 25,970% in 19 months to over $25
million in gains. This return compares to outlier best-in-class returns of 4,000% in Apple's
(NASDAQ:AAPL) share price and a 1,100% increase in Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG)
(NASDAQ:GOOGL) share price over 10 years of booming, profitable growth!


A simple reading of WATT's S-1 shows us that there is very little business here other than
a catchy ticker symbol. We agree with WATT's own SEC filings that warn investors that
the company's equity may end up being worthless.


WATT claims to be a company that is developing technology that can enable wireless
charging or powering of electronic devices at distance. WATT's technology powers
devices by surrounding them with a three-dimensional ("3D") pocket of energy formed by
radio frequencies.

5/19/2018 WATT? 'Be Prepared To Lose All Of Your Investment' - Energous Corp. (NASDAQ:WATT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2358075-watt-be-prepared-to-lose-all-of-your-investment 2/21


Sound almost as intriguing as 3D (NYSE:DDD) and 3D printing? As CEO Steve Rizzone
describes to Fox Business News, "Energous has the technology that is going to
fundamentally change the way the consumer charges their wireless device." In this video,
WATT shows an impressive demonstration of how consumers could charge their
smartphones wirelessly without any battery pack accessory using WATT's technology.


What are the problems with the WATT wireless charging vision?


As we learn later in the Fox interview Q&A session with Rizzone, WATT does not
actually possess the technology to wirelessly charge devices without a battery pack.
Here is a YouTube video where WATT's founder and chief technology officer, Michael
Leabman demonstrates what WATT's technology can actually do.
As we can see, WATT's current prototype, which is not yet commercially available, is
expected to cost $75-125 for a battery pack, and an additional $300 for a wireless
router with a 15-foot diameter range that will transmit power to the battery pack.
We wonder why a consumer would pay ~$375-425 for this set of accessories when
consumers today already have the following cheaper options to charge their devices:


1. Plug their device into a wall outlet for free using OEM-provided accessories.
2. Purchase one of dozens of extended battery charging sleeves or charging blocks


that exist today. WATT's cumbersome solution costs ~4-10x more than these
accessories.


To be fair to WATT, the company claims that these initial prototypes are just the first step
towards the dream of true wireless charging. The company has announced four JDAs
(joint-development agreements) with Korean electronic accessory companies, and
promises investors more partnership announcements in the future. WATT hopes that
some of these partners will develop wireless charging accessories to display at CES in
2015. However, JDAs are common in the consumer electronics industry and do not
require partners to make significant investments. Many JDAs do not result in the
commercialization of any new products, but end up being merely research & development
exercises.


We would not get very excited about JDAs or the next generation of WATT's "technology"
for several reasons outlined in WATT's own S-1:


WATT has no working commercial technology:


"Our efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our technology... the technology
concepts we are applying to develop commercial applications of wireless power for

fixed and mobile low-power rechargeable devices have not been previously
successfully applied by anyone else... our business may fail."
Lack of technology should not be too surprising to investors, since the company has
only spent a cumulative $3 million on research and development activities since
inception as of March 31, 2014.


WATT has no revenue, yet growing expenses:


"We have not yet demonstrated our ability to generate revenue, and we may never be
able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis. As a result, we
have incurred losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses
and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future."
From the company's first earnings call in May 2014: "We understand that for the first
two years we are not going to have EBITDA and earnings growth that you would
expect from a public company."
As of the first quarter 2014, WATT has $2 million of quarterly operating expenses, up
20% quarter-over-quarter, with plans to grow up to 39 employees. At just the current
$2MM quarterly burn rate, WATT will have spent all of its cash balance from the IPO in
only three years, but the business plan includes increasing expenses, growing the
employee count up to 39.


FCC regulatory approval will be required for power transmission for consumer product use
cases that have never been granted before in the history of the industry:


"Our remote charging technology involves the transmission of power using RF energy
waves, which are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission
("FCC")... because our technology involves the transmission of power greater than the
power threshold limits of Part 15, we also expect to need to obtain FCC Part 18
approval. To our knowledge, the transmission of power using RF energy waves by a
consumer product at the ranges we are proposing is novel and there can be no
assurance that we will be able to obtain this FCC approval or that other governmental
approvals will not be required. Our efforts to achieve required governmental approvals
could be costly and time consuming."


To put icing on the cake, WATT is warning equity holders that their investment may be a 0,
given the speculative nature of WATT's activities:


"As an investor you may never recoup all, or even part of, your investment and you
may never realize any return on your investment. You must be prepared to lose all of
your investment."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2358075-watt-be-prepared-to-lose-all-of-your-investment 4/21


At the current expense run rate, WATT's cash runs out in 3 years, and WATT has plans
to increase expense levels from the current run rate. Increased spending would
accelerate the timeline to insolvency, unless WATT can succeed in licensing its
technology to generate material levels of revenue or complete another capital raise
that would likely dilute equity holders.


Perhaps most importantly, even if WATT can defy the odds and reach a technological
breakthrough, is it already too late to license wireless charging technology to the industry
giants?


According to VentureBeat, the iPhone 6 from AAPL will include wireless charging
capabilities.
GOOG launched a wireless charging device in November of last year for the Nexus 5
Duracell, owned by Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), is backing PowerMatt to install
wireless charging stations in Starbucks.
And the list of established power electronic and technology companies entering the
wireless charging space goes on and on...


So how was this high-tech company formed? For $10,000 out of an LLC based in the
founder's parents' house in Colorado a little over a year and a half ago.


Per the S-1:


From September 2010 to September 2013, Michael Leabman was chief technology
officer of a company called TruePath Wireless, a service and equipment provider in the
broadband communications industry.
"On November 8, 2012, DvineWave Holdings LLC, an entity formed by the parents of
Michael Leabman, our Chief Technology Officer, to make an investment in the
Company, purchased 1,924,812 shares of common stock in exchange for $10,000."
DvineWave Holdings address is founder Michael Leabman's parents' house in Denver.
So for Leabman's parents' generous investment of $10k, they created their position in
WATT at a valuation of half a penny! At a price of $12.99 today, that's a return of $25.9
million, or 25,970% over 20 months!
Now here comes the even crazier part. On January 23, 2013, MDB Capital entered
into a Placement Agent Agreement with the company less than 3 months after the
initial $10,000 capital investment. MDB was paid via a "Financing Warrant" for
$550,000 that was converted into 152,778 shares at an exercise price of $3.60 at the
time of WATT's prospective IPO. Also on January 23, 2013, the company entered into
a consulting agreement with MDB to advise on "financial, strategic, and intellectual

property advisory services" for 278,228 shares, at a price of $0.005 per share. We
have never encountered an investment bank willing to advise a company less than 3
months after its incorporation only capitalized by $10,000. Even more importantly, with
less than a year of work by Leabman and only $10,000 invested in the technology at
the time of MDB's 2013 involvement, how far along could WATT's wireless charging
technology actually be? Our intuition says Apple, Google, Duracell, et al are a lot
further along in cracking the wireless charging code than WATT...


What is MDB Capital, and why would it bet on a 3-month old company like WATT?


According to the company's website, based in the financial mecca of Santa Monica,
California, MDB Capital is "Wall Street's only IP-driven public venture bank, with over
15 years of experience launching disruptive technologies into the public markets. We
maximize the value of disruptive technology companies by positioning them to attract
growth capital, strengthening their IP portfolios to create sustainable competitive
advantage, and connecting them with a base of high-quality investors with deep
technology expertise."
MDB's website includes a PowerPoint presentation that highlights the success of this
"IP-driven public venture banking approach" taken with Uni-Pixel:


What the presentation does not show is how Uni-Pixel is down more than 70% since
the "Validation" phase highlighted above...

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2358075-watt-be-prepared-to-lose-all-of-your-investment 6/21


Moxreports.com memorializes MDB's involvement in Uni-Pixel's fall from grace:


"Two things are contributing to the continuous drop. First, two short biased articles
came out questioning Unipixel's technology. Second, immediately after the short
articles, MDB Capital removed all of its research reports from its website with no
announcement or explanation. These pages had all been available to any reader up
until two weeks ago when they were suddenly removed. MDB had also eliminated all
reference to a number of former case studies which highlighted 10 bagger stocks
which have since imploded to pennies on the pink sheets. Many investors who have
become extraordinarily bullish on Unipixel are likely not aware that MDB takes large
equity stakes in the low float stocks that it covers (including Unipixel) and then
employs... analysts... to write bullish reports on these stocks. MDB then reserves the
right to sell these shares as a principal, and even take short positions. MDB stocks
have demonstrated a persistent pattern of surging (sometimes by several hundred
percent) following MDB's involvement and a flurry of optimistic but vague press
releases. The low float of these stocks contributes to the exceptionally sharp rises
that can be seen even with the slightest amount of positive news. Yet MDB's deals
also have shown a persistent pattern of imploding thereafter, at which time MDB
ceases research coverage. By that time MDB has presumably exited the stock."

5/19/2018 WATT? 'Be Prepared To Lose All Of Your Investment' - Energous Corp. (NASDAQ:WATT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2358075-watt-be-prepared-to-lose-all-of-your-investment 7/21


WATT currently has a market capitalization of ~$150 million ($12.99 stock price on
nearly 12MM of fully diluted shares). While this is small compared to capitalizations of
other publicly traded stocks with millions or billions in revenues (WATT has no
revenue), it is worth noting that the WATT IPO has been a big success story for MDB.
Utilizing Capital IQ, below we pull the list of companies MDB Capital has advised on
equity issuances since 2008, and can see that WATT currently has the second-largest
market capitalization out of twenty deals, second only to ImageWare (OTCQB:IWSY),
which has a $210 million market capitalization.


Now that we have an understanding of MDB Capital, let's return to the steps that led up to
the IPO of WATT:


On January 28, 2013, Leabman made an investment himself, investing a sum of $417
(note that is four hundred seventeen dollars, we are not leaving out a decimal point),
also at a half-penny valuation. So Leabman himself has enjoyed a 25,970% return
(generating over $1 million in profits) over just 18 months. It is worth noting that
Leabman did not invest his $417 until after the company had entered the private
placement agreement and consulting agreements with MDB Capital.
"On March 1, 2013, Absolute Ventures LLC, an affiliate of a director of the Company,
Greg Brewer, purchased 668,337 shares of common stock in exchange for $160,000,
or a valuation of $0.24. At a price of $12.99, Brewer has generated gains of over $8
million on his initial investment, or 5,326%, in just 16 months." Here is Absolute
Ventures LLC's address.

On May 16, 2013, MDB Capital helps raise a $5.5 million convertible note investment
for the company at a conversion price set equal to a 50% discount to the prospective
IPO price.
In October 2013, just six months prior to the March 2014 IPO, WATT added a couple
things all publicly traded companies need: a management team and some office
space. "We entered into a Standard Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease with
ProSoft Engineering, Inc. for our principal office space located at 303 Ray Street,
Pleasanton, CA 94566... Greg Brewer, a member of our board of directors, is the
owner and founder of ProSoft Engineering, Inc." Stephen Rizzone (CEO and
chairman), Thomas Iwanski (chief financial officer), and George Holmes (VP of Sales)
join the company. Michael Leabman gives himself the title of chief technology officer.
In addition to its other collected fees and stock ownership, MDB was granted an
"Underwriter Warrant" exercisable at $6.00 for 10% of the IPO share amount, effective
on the date of an IPO offering and subject to a 180-day lock-up.
Finally, the IPO was declared effective on March 27, 2014. On April 2, the company
consummated the public offering of 4,600,000 shares of common stock (including
600,000 shares issued pursuant to the over-allotment option granted to the
underwriter) at $6.00 per share. WATT raised $24.8 million of net proceeds.


What kind of company goes public with an interim CFO that is currently employed as a
"full-time" CFO at another publicly traded company that is being accused of accounting
fraud?


WATT's S-1 reads:


"Mr. Iwanski joined the Company in October 2013 as a financial consultant and in
December 2013 was appointed Chief Financial Officer"
WATT is "highly dependent on certain key members of our executive management
team. Our inability to retain these individuals could impede our business plan and
growth strategies, which could have a negative impact on our business and the value
of your investment." WATT lists Iwanski as one of four key executives in this risk factor.
Amendments to the S-1 filed later subtly mention that Iwanski is "interim" CFO
There is no mention anywhere in WATT's SEC filings that Iwanski was appointed "full-
time CFO" of Medbox (MDBX) as of April 15, 2013.


MDBX followers have poked fun about "fraudulent statements" made by the company
regarding when precisely MDBX hired Iwanski as CFO, and WATT seems to be having
similar trouble figuring out when exactly Iwanski was hired at WATT and what his role was
at the company.

During Iwanski's tenor as "full-time CFO," according to MDBX's original April 2013 press
release, Citron Research has accused MDBX for "MULTIPLE FRAUDS," including making
the statement that "THE COMPANY LITERALLY HAS 2 Sets of Financials… or maybe
3."


Perhaps what is more telling is that Iwanski has separated ties with WATT to work at
MDBX. Does this mean Iwanski sees more upside in MDBX than in WATT?


"On June 5, 2014, Energous Corporation (the "Company") reported that it has
concluded its consulting agreement with interim CFO, Tom Iwanski. The Company has
retained Lonergan Partners, a leading Silicon Valley executive search firm, to identify a
permanent CFO."


We believe there is significant downside to WATT's share price


The company needs to succeed in achieving an improbable technological breakthrough to
commercialize wireless charging, but recall, the business was only funded with $10,000
from Leabman's parents up until January 2013. Even with subsequent funding rounds,
WATT has only spent $3 million in research and development since inception as of March
31, 2014. Furthermore, FCC regulatory approval for novel consumer electronic
applications is required. Subsequent successful commercialization with technology
partners is also needed. We believe that the company will likely fail to generate any
revenue, given these hurdles. In the absence of these improbable events, we believe that
the equity is likely worthless, and WATT will be required to raise further primary capital to
maintain its solvency. We are very wary of the 180-day IPO lock-up that expires at the
end of September, in which millions of shares will be eligible for sale. These pre-IPO
investors have realized incredible short-term returns on paper by investing in WATT,
but have not yet been able to monetize their investments in the public market.

I like focus on technology on such articles and tend to agree that Watt has nothing spectacular and may be
obsolete in the near future.

BATS
per the links in the articles, AAPL is considering the capacity to use the CHARGING PADS which may be "wireless"
with a range of maybe 5 inches, as is the case with the GOOGL articles


comparing apples to oranges here.


seems like facts are being blurred to support the short thesis.


WATT's solution would enable a truly wireless charging experience in an enclosed space using technologies that can
be integrated with current WiFi tech.


and of course WATT is running through all of its cash as a developmental stage tech co. similar to many junior
biotechs... I would bet they raise more cash through equity sooner rather than later.


but then as always bulls make money bears make money but sheep get slaughtered.

BATs, for wireless charging over distance WATT's approach is vastly inferior.


Witricity is a real company - spinout from MIT, partnered with Intel, Toyota and many others, and it's
technology is significantly more advantageous (e.g. 95% efficiency of power transfer).


From my research WATT's approach is a joke and even if they can produce it will be a commercial failure for
reasons highlighted here.


30 Jul 2014, 12:43 PM


BATS
you may be right about efficiency, but i would only point out the range issue.


also how less efficient is WATT how did you arrive at those numbers?


according to what i've read briefly from their website the WiTricity website their range is much less than
WATT.


i believe the WATT metrics are 16W inside 5ft, 
5-10ft - 8W 
10-15ft- 4W


 
i have no position in WATT btw so either way it doesn't affect me

WATT is running in the 20% efficiency range. Per public disclosures.


WATT is still skinny on details of its approach but it seems to also require that it track the exact 3D location of
a device so it can do some beam forming and blast the RF radiation right at the device. Wouldn't want it in my
pocket next to my nutz when that is going on.


The reality is the battle is already over. Either Qi or Rezence (or both) will emerge as the wireless charging
standard as they are backed by all of the major players. Intel just licensed Witricity last month for Rezence
applications, for example.


My opinion is WATT is DOA. The industry has gone in a different (superior direction).


There's a chicken/egg problem as well - wireless charging is most usefull away from home or office. E.g.
Starbucks is putting in PowerMats. Unless handset makers and others bin all of their plans for an inferior

technology and build out proprietary infrastructure based on WATT, then they are done. It won't happen. All in
my opinion only.


My expectation is they'll come out with a clunky battery pack that you have to slap on your phone and a pricey
base station that won't really be helpful in a home or office environment when a charging cord is just fine.


The only thing that would convince me this isn't a zero in the making is a major licensing deal with a major
player (e.g. Qualcomm, Intel, Google, etc.). I put the odds of that at below 1%.

For an example of a real company in the space, check out WiTricity:


http://www.witricity.com


Partnered with Intel, Toyota, Mediatek and many others. Magnetic induction over distance is vastly superior in terms
of performance and efficiency.


My understanding is WATT's product blasts about 10 watts of RF into a room. That is effectively like a microwave
oven and most of the energy will be dissipated as heat. It's also about 200x the amount of RF used in a typical WiFi
router (50 milliwatts, or 0.05 watts).


I am short WATT.


I hope I don't get any recalls now that the cat is out of the bag. If my borrow cost goes up I'll send you the bill.


Oh, good article.

Investors need to keep an eye on the 37 patent applications that the S-1 say are on file. Having no issued patents
could be a challenge for WATT moving forward, and investors need to be informed about the company's patent
positioning.

Markman - my research into the company and related/ legacy entities lead me to suspect that many of the
patents are unrelated. to wireless charging.

Shorts and self-serving attacks, regardless of how nice the graphs are, will always be viewed with skepticism...and
given the tight float, i expect dumb money to sell...and the stock moves higher. In fact, it'd be GREAT to get more
shorts on board...it'll just make the next squeeze that much better :)

I think the company (and investors) and really banking on the whole "GoPro ecosystem" coming to fruition
sometime in the future. They're looking to be a media company as well as a hardware provider. That said, it's
one of those companies that years down the road, after the crash (big, small, medium, who knows) we may
look back at it and regard it as the Millennial version of Pets.com.


 
I should add that they do make a really, really good camera on a stick.

Radio waves, or ANY waves are transmitted radially (4∏).  
At a distance of 15 feet, the area of the radio sphere is A = 4πr^2 = 2827 square feet. The surface of a cell phone is
about 1/8 square foot.  
To direct 1 W of power into a cell phone at a distance of 15 feet, the amount of power the generating station must
provide is: 1 * 2827 / (1/8) = 22.62 kW.


Good luck with that. You might as well stick you head in the microwave.

The company has zero connection to MDBX and the former interim CFO/consultant, Thomas Iwanski, is no longer
involved. That's what these guys do -- innuendo and guilt by association to create fear, uncertainty and doubt.


Energous was taken public by MDB Capital. I've made a LOT of money betting on MDB Capital-backed deals,
including CLIR, HEAR (formerly PAMT), IPWR, RESN and WATT. I never participated in UNXL's rise and fall -- there
was a fortune to be made on the way up, and I missed out. Management's failure isn't MDB's fault.


FYI, there was a similar short/bear attack with another MDB-banked deal in the Fall of 2012 called Clearsign
Combustion (NASDAQ:CLIR). I wrote at $5 that it was a screaming buy. The stock went as high as $12 and trades
around $8 today.


Smart money was buying WATT today and will be buying more tomorrow with the shares "on sale."


30 Jul 2014, 06:52 PM


Grant Payne, Contributor
Nothing you said changes the fact that they have zero revenue, an extremely likely rush of insider selling after
the lock up, and technology that isn't even all that new or proprietary. My money would be on Google making
wireless charging commercially viable before these guys do. You should also probably disclose whether or
not you're being paid by WATT or MDB to write bullish arguments.

BIgDogDog
I have bought most of MDBs deals, CLIR, WATT, PAMT (now HEAR) and IPWR and I have made money on all of
them. The CEO of WATT is a stud having numerous exits already. Comparing the founder of WATTs stock to an
increase in GOOG or AAPL is stupid. All founders of all tech companies get issued cheap stock. That is why they are
founders. WATT has no competition. Powermat has already flopped..Best Buy doesn't even carry it anymore...and
Witricitys range is horrible.


With respect to the technology, this Hugo Drax fellow is clueless. It shows he has no idea how it works. First of all it's
microwaves not radio waves. He is assuming it is an isotopic spherical emitter (look it up). WATT uses an energy
pocket that's the whole point of the technology. How to use multiple antennas to create an energy pocket the same
size as the phone.


And as far as efficiency ... It's about 20 percent efficient right now at 10 feet. That means for 1 watt transmitted it takes
5 watts of power. This will improve to about 30%. Remember it cost you a like a dollar of power to run your device for
a whole year. That is why you can charge mobile devices with it but not cars. Use witricity if you want to charge cars.
But Witricity does not have the range WATT does. That is why WATT great for things like phones and wearables.


I love these shorts that try and act smart. You can make fortune just buying every time one of these hit pieces come

>>It shows he has no idea how it works. First of all it's microwaves not radio waves.<<


With all due respect you obviously have no idea what you are talking about. Microwaves ARE RF waves. The
term "microwave" just describes RF between the 300Mhz and 300Ghz range. They are the same thing -
electromagnetic radiation.

>>He is assuming it is an isotopic spherical emitter (look it up). <<


First, it's isotropic, not "isotopic". Second, he specifically mentioned beamforming.


Unfortunatley WATT has no issued patents to review, no technical whitepapers, or anything else that
someone skilled in the art can review.


I would love to read how the laws of physics can can be upended by creating "3D pockets" of energy".


>>But Witricity does not have the range WATT does.<<


You do not know the range that Witricity will be able to achieve:


1) They were at about 3 meters (10 feet) in 2007.


2) They are also developing repeaters that will be able to extend range significantly.


 
Witricity also falls below the FCC threshold for safety, and already complies with FCC radio interference
regulations.


WATT on the other hand will be blasting lot of radiation. I think they may have a huge FCC problem. Note the
FCC is also in the process of reopening safety and exposure limits for exposure to electromagnetic radiation:


http://bit.ly/1s72Lgt


If WATT's approach exceeds that of Part 15 as the author suggests, and it needs to get Part 18 approval,
given the "novel" concept here I think this could take years (if ever), and the FCC may very well decide to wait
until it's new rules are drafted.


They will also face other hurdles - remember the uproar and parent concern about putting WiFi in the
schools? WATT's emitters are 100-200x more powerful from what I can tell.


Another issue will be that operating in the WiFi spectrum it's not clear what interference issues could arise.


People obviously don't understand what they own here.

Good news: the technology is real. RF can be used to power devices. What this company seems to have, is a phased
array approach (been around 100 years , literally) augmented by state of the art software and antennae meta
materials to get better performance, efficiency etc . It WILL work. 
Bad news: the FCC is crystal clear on how much RF you are permitted to transmit - their claims are dramatically

outside the bounds of what is permissible. On the earnings call they specifically said they were pushing back their
FCC application. ie they know they are non compliant with regs.  
How it will play out. They will continue to sign JDA's. They probably get a few patents issued (they have zero
currently) When the lock up for the underwriter frees up in late Sept. the stock will come under selling pressure. They
will have the technology in products for the CES but will NOT have FCC approval, hence no ability to sell. In March of
2015 the stock will come under pressure again as managements stock lock up expires. Once management has sold
its shares the company will announce a highly dilutive secondary, as they will still not have FCC approval and no clear
path to revenues. They will then spin the story towards going after an even bigger market in the lower power space.
The problem is Qualcom pretty much owns that turf ............... once the story changes, and it will - the greater fool
theory will be the only way out


20 Aug 2014, 12:05 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
I agree Samantha. I would also note that even with FCC clearance the commercial hurdles are enough to kill
it IMHO. Too expensive, clunky, and without charging stations all over the place rather useless. But FCC
issues are enormous.


20 Aug 2014, 12:10 PM


Benjamin Padnos, Contributor
Wrong. Energous is on track for FCC approval. In the unlikely event that they don't, there's a back-up plan in place:
licensed spectrum. They can partner with AT&T, Verizon, or others who don't fall under FCC Part 18 restrictions. I'll
address this in more detail in a future Seeking Alpha article.


20 Aug 2014, 04:57 PM


samantha paxton
Benjamin, take the time to read the transcript of Aug 12. It is in black and white. The company has delayed its FCC
application. They know they are outside the regs. They are NOT going to submit an application which will result in a
rejection before management has the time to sell its shares (April 2015). Also note how they company stated they
would power 24 devices up to 6watts per device in both the May call and the filing docs. They are now talking 16
devices at 4 watts. 30% decrease in number of devices as well as power, all before a single patent issued or FCC
application filled out. The one thing I can not find is any reference to this "back up plan" you mention. I had you
figured for a bull in WATT- if what you are saying is true , that is not a bear story , its a death knell.


22 Aug 2014, 12:58 PM


samantha paxton
While I maintain a bearish optic on this company- for ever growing reasons - I do think todays action (down 17%)
warrants consideration for a small buy. Obviously some smart money is getting out of the shares prior to the stock
lock up release - that said, it seems a bit over done. 
The company will be pounding the press release pavement hard in next few weeks and they will probably be able to
get a bounce going. A small buy now may be worth considering. just make sure you get out before end of month.

company to embed WattUp wire-free charging into their products."
