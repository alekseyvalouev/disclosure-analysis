CVD Equipment's Defense Shows No Errors In Our Prior Article
Sep. 3, 2013 10:39 AM ET73 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


This morning, CVD Equipment Corporation (NASDAQ:CVV) released a brief statement
(here) in response to our article about CVV's declining operations. Alpha Exposure
believes this statement only serves to support our article that highlighted CVV's poor
operations and precarious financial situation (here). It is important to note that President
and Chief Executive Officer Leonard Rosenbaum did not refute any of our claims.


Mr. Rosenbaum did not refute that CVV's backlog is down to the lowest level in nine
quarters due to declining orders.

He did not refute that CVV spends very little on R&D and holds an insignificant IP portfolio
of patents and intellectual property, as found in Note 6 of CVV's 2012 Annual Report
(here).

Lastly, the CEO did not refute that CVV produced underlying operating losses in the first
half of the year after adjusting for a one-time gain from a sale of a building that will not
recur.

In our experience, when two sides have a disagreement, the side that bases its argument
on factual evidence is more often in the right. If you read our last article, you can see that
we presented a factual argument. In contrast, the Company's press release states that we
are "purposefully attempting to create a negative picture" by publishing an article that is
"misleading" and "scandalous and injurious to the public." The Company also attempts to
discredit our article by calling us "internet bloggers," and criticizes our anonymous nature.
However, in not one single instance does the Company identify one misleading or
incorrect fact in our article.


Alpha Exposure stands by our article and believes CVV's statement today only further
supports our view that CVV continues to be a great short. At Friday's closing price of
$11.22/share, we believe CVD is a compelling short and believe true underlying value is
only $5 per share based on its historic earnings, which is a generous valuation for a
company that has since turned unprofitable and is now shrinking.

Disclosure: I am short CVV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Why would the Company talk about the backlog down or one time gain in today's press release? They stated both of
those things in the last earnings press release. They also talked about why backlog was down. The company never
claimed to have intellectual property. The lack of it does not effect the future potential of orders or the customer list.
This article is a non-event. Short are now trapped and subject to any contract news that would create a short squeeze
of nice proportions.

Your article was an attempt to scare inexperienced shareholders by putting a negative spin on the effects of their wise
decision to redtructure the company for the coming deluge of orders. Fortunately, their many customers end up
paying the way for research that makes them more and more the expert on graphene production and applications.
Graphene will revolutionize energy storage and fresh water availability..The two biggest problems of our time. 
You and your hedge fund friends have quite a business going here, stealing from the innocents. Why not try applying
your talents to something positive, that would help the world?

Well said.


I own a bunch of stocks. The idea that I might tell people and explain why and expect price to change
because of it is assinine. It presumes I know something no-one else does.


A complete stranger telling me he's short therefore I should be is naive. Just get short and stay quiet about it.
Why tell others ?


The author must very young. He'd be short Tesla at $50 if he's at all consistent.

WHO is "our", "we" and "us" that you keep referring too. Why dont you disclose?... Are you talking about the (your)
hedge fund which is short 10%+ of this miniscule/tight float?


Are the shorts getting nervous thats its not responding to this PR like it did the last short article? Are people more
educated about CVV and what position they are actually in now that the consolidation/relocation is complete?


Huge Squeeze coming. Multi million dollar contract news due any day, per the 8/14 news release, hence the shorts
working so hard to cover now.

But then again, a major short squeeeeeze after a gap up on multi million dollar pre market contract news is fine as
well.


Most of these systems are $1,000,000+ each. From the 8/14 release.


***I am happy to announce we just received an initial $1 million follow-on order to commence manufacturing on some
portions of a much larger system and we anticipate that additional multi-million dollar portions will be awarded in the

It's worth saying you don't have to own the IP to make a ton money on it. Having access to the IP of many
different players in the industry and being seen as a go-to CVD provider is way more valuable than trying to
compete with Universities and massive tech companies alike. If they can extract a fraction of the value from
everyone else's IP, they don't need to own it themselves, and they don't have to bother with protecting it or
maintaining it.


I thought this point in Apha's critique was way off base and shows a misunderstanding of CVD's previously
communicated strategy. I see CVD's startegy to hold little IP on their books, but invest heavily in R&D to get
IP-like know-how as a smart way to provide industry-leading service to their many clients instead of
competing with them.

The response from the company was laughable and self-defeating. If the CEO is going to come out and state that an
article contains significant factual errors, he should be able to point to a single one.


Makes me wonder they put the quotation marks around "significant factual errors" for a reason. He also hedges by
stating "certain investor websites" and "certain of these articles".


Going to check this company out as a short candidate. Sure seems like a turd on the surface.


03 Sep 2013, 01:40 PM


InvestorWisdom
Why does he have to repeat what he has previously stated in the PRs and filings?


Hes just responding to the investor emials that flooded them since last week. Hes not going to outline the
companies whole business plan and financial situation in a single PR. lol


Alpha Exposures claims do not mention all of the details that have been given by the company over the past
year. He entirely leaves out the fact that sales were at RECORD LEVELS the quarter before the
consolidation/relocation started. He wants us to ignore the obvious reasons for the declining revs and assume
the company is going to fail entirely, which is a blatant distortion of the facts.


Another example is the claim that the company competes with Apple. It doesn't take much research to figure
out how blatantly inaccurate that claim is, including others. Do your research. The shorts are desperate to
cover their 10%+ short, this is why they timed this article the day after it was hitting a new 52 week high on
heavy volume. They had to stop it and were willing to distort the facts to keep from losing more money.


This has all the makings of a major squeeze play. They better cover before the wave of contract
announcements which are coming, per the CEO in the 8/14 news release. tic toc

Author’s reply »  You actually make my point for me - the sales were at record levels 18 months ago and the
backlog was at a record in 2011. Since then, there's been a steady decline. You want to believe that this is
solely due to the move in HQ, but that doesn't come close to explaining the continuous decline in backlog
since June, 2011. I offered a different explanation - the company got a single large solar order that it's almost
done working through and the company is now returning to its historic level of results. We will see who is right
-either backlog accelerates and you're correct or things stagnate / decline and I am correct.

You want me to believe almost $50,000,000 in revenues in 2011-1012 was due to a "single large solar order"?

Why did they not announce that mystery $50,000,000 order??? Why do i only find an order for $3.4 million in
late 2010, which does not even represent 10% of the revenue over those 2 years.


CVD Equipment Corporation Receives $3.4M Order For Solar Production Tools

See what Jim Cramer and Stephanie Link are trading today.


CVD Equipment Corporation (Nasdaq: CVV) announced today that it has received an initial order for $3.4
million from a solar panel manufacturer to provide deposition production tools for their solar factory. CVD
continues to benefit from the increased demand for products that generate or save energy and we anticipate
that this trend will continue to create demand for our products and services for many years to come.


CVD’s endeavors into Graphene materials and equipment was also given a boost this past week when two
physicists working at the University of Manchester were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery
and isolation of Graphene. Graphene, a one-atom thick material, is not only the thinnest material in the world,
it may also be the strongest substance ever discovered (stronger than steel). Graphene has the potential to
transform electronics by allowing for faster computers and folding touch screens, lighter and stronger aircraft
and cars and a host of other applications.


The large demand for energy savings, energy generation materials and products needed to address rising
energy and environmental costs creates a growing demand for manufacturing solutions using nanotechnology
and thin film coatings on glass, wafers and other substrates or materials. Using our Application Laboratory,
we continue to perfect and expand the multiple areas where our process solutions can be applied. The solar,
energy and nanotechnology markets offer significant growth opportunities for our technologies because they
deliver favorable performance and cost benefits. These fields will benefit further from a renewed drive for
energy savings and ecologically safe energy generation.

From 2010 to 2012 their total revenue was $69,409,209, with the strongest quarter being in 2012 (right before
the move began).


Again, show me a "single large solar order" that accounted for most of this money.


Wouldn't that be news worthy?

>>Why does he have to repeat what he has previously stated in the PRs and filings?<<


He didn't stated that Alpha Exposure's article was full of factual errors in previous PRs and filings. That is a new
statement by the company, and the fact (fact!) that he didn't back it up with a single bit of substance is quite telling.


>>Hes not going to outline the companies whole business plan and financial situation in a single PR. lol<<


You really think he would have to lay out the entire business plan and "financial situation" to point out a factual error in
the article? Nope. For example "The author mistakenly reports our backlog as X but it is actually Y".


>>>Alpha Exposures claims do not mention all of the details that have been given by the company over the past
year<<<


So how is being silent on something a "significant factual error"? Don't you have to write something on a topic to be in
error? E.g. I think you are completely wrong in your political views. I don't need to hear what they are though, they are
just wrong.

Because he more correctly focuses on forward looking items like the book to bill ratio. Hint: you have to book it before
you can bill it.


I see in the 10-Q it stated:


"During the six months ended June 30, 2013, and to a LESSER EXTENT in the three months ended June 30, 2013,
the results of operations were significantly impacted by this transaction due to the substantial amount of time and
effort dedicated to renovating and moving into our new facility which proved to be disruptive to our continuing
operations. We completed the relocation to our substantially larger facility in the closing days of March 2013."


So in the June quarter, post "relocation" sales were $4.85 million vs. $7.1 million in the prior year quarter.


From the 10-Q:


"This decrease is attributable to both accepted while we were transitioning into our new facility and the reconstructing
of equipment during the period."


The "relocation" argument I haven't looked into, but it seems bogus on the surface - most real companies would light
up the new facility and make the transition relatively seamless to clients. So in my opinion they are either using it as
an excuse for weak results, or they are operationally incompetent - or both.


I'm aware of no company that stops taking order during a "relocation" , particularly when orders take up to two years,
hence the backlog declining 32% to $5.5 million is troubling.


>>He wants us to ignore the obvious reasons for the declining revs and assume the company is going to fail entirely,
which is a blatant distortion of the facts.<<


Sorry, I think you are the one distorting here. Lets say for a minute you are right, that this big problematic relocation is
responsible for many millions in lost revenue (and more in backlog)- the company per the 10-K only has $2 million of
machinery and equipment and $1.5 million in lab equipment. For $3.5M or call it even $4M they could have just lit up
the whole new facility with shiny new equipment and not turned away a single new order or job while they "relocated"
the old equipment.


This from the 10-K is hilarious:


"As of December 31, 2012, our order backlog was approximately $8,342,000 compared to approximately $16,198,000
at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $7,856,000 or 48.5% compared to $16,198,000 at December 31, 2011. The
decrease is directly attributable to the purposeful reduction in the amount of new orders accepted during this transition
phase of moving to our new facility."


What kind of company torches it's business "purposefully" by 50% due to a facilities move?


"Another example is the claim that the company competes with Apple."


No, his point was that many companies are pouring massive dollars into R&D to the graphene space. CVV has about
$42K worth of intellectual property. The point is there can't be much of a moat when you don't even dig one.


>>The shorts are desperate to cover <<


In my experience the louder pumpers shout this, the better the short candidate it probably is. I think I will do more
work on this name.

I disagree with your argument that they handled the relocation incorrectly by reducing orders. Reducing
orders and making sure the company can deliver is a better strategy than overpromising and underdelivering
which may permanently damage the brand. The cost of setting up a whole new facility in addition to the cost
of the materials for the orders would've hurt their bottom line SO MUCH more than just scaling back for a
while. In addition it would've put their staff under tremendous pressure and would likely have impacted their
delivery and talent retention. This was just growing pains, and growing in a measured and careful way is
smarter than trying to run before you've tried walking.


However, I was surprised we didn't start hearing about the "order reduction strategy" PRIOR to the move, and
have been annoyed with management that it didn't come out until orders had been declining for a while. In my
mind, this is either a failure in timing of communication (if it was planned) or a late excuse for poorer-than-
anticipated performance which means they didn't expect it to impact them as much as it did. Either
explanation leaves me questioning their skill in managing the move. My solice lies in the fact that they are a
CVD company, not a facility movement specialist, so hopefully this pain really is behind us as the CEO said.

Check out the facility on Google Street View - this isn't a NASA facility - if it's all specialty equipment for
different customers they could have just gradually moved it over. My guess is done properly they could have
done it over a long weekend. Or just use 2 facilities.


I see it as a convenient excuse. Show me any company out there that has purposefully cleaved it's business
in half because of a move. It's ridiculous.


Pull up Google Street View and look at their old facility:

Your DD is limited. Not only did they have to relocate more than one facility into a single facility that is
130,000 square foot. They also had to breakdown and relocate cleanrooms, delicate/expensive lab
equipment, very large and heavy production systems, raw materials, etc, from more than one location. There

The new facility also had to be redesigned to their floor plan and they added 10,000 Square feet.


Moving this type of company is never easy. Its not just office equipment and computers!


This is why this is such a great opportunity to get cheap stock before they get back on track. The shorts want
everyone to think they are doomed to fail, but they are actually ready to meet current and future demand,
which will be massive.


PS: Their production systems have to be broken down and rebuilt. Its not like moving a piece of furniture. This
is a lot of work, for EACH system.


Heres an example (out of many) of what they had to move. http://bit.ly/15DwKOO

They completed most of the backlog and choose to quote on less work until they had an idea on when they
could complete the difficult move. This turned out to be the wise choice, the move took way too long.


You can easily upset customers when there are millions on the line. There is an international tech race taking
place. Its highly competitive and time is money/lost potential


We'll know business is picking up if we see a string of contracts before end of year, as the CEO predicted in
the 8/14 news release

Author’s reply »  How can you say that they chose to quote on less work when the CEO repeatedly made
statements in their earnings releases that quotations levels were high?


04 Sep 2013, 02:43 PM


TEWeber
They didn't really "torch their business by 50%" as you say, but rather went back to a historical revenue level
for the old facilities. They had massive orders due to very high demand for their new products and did the
best with the facilities they had to fill the large orders - hence revenue doubled for a while. Then they had to
figure out how to make 2x revenue and future growth sustainable so they needed new facilities, and it seems
they thought it'd be easy just like you did. Instead it took a year.


I think the move was botched due to legal and other issues compared to their originally communicated Q3
2012 plan. I remember reading that they couldn't move into the new facility and sell the old one yet because
of a legal issue, and I'll leave it to someone else to dig up details. The most likely explanation is that they
purposefully took orders to a lower level because they didn't know when/where they'd be moving and didn't
want to underdeliver. I am curious what they told their customers, and I don't think it's surprising AIXG had
some win announcements in this intervening time.

" high quotation levels" just means the amount of AVAILABLE WORK to quote on. These are not signed
deals.


This is why they are confident that the numbers will return, now that they will be more competitive in the
quoting process. They are no doubt becoming more efficient by combining multiple locations into a single
location with twice the size, with a streamlined floor plan. It takes a lot of smart planning to land many 7-8
figure orders. These are nor small/simple quotes


The definition of a Quote is: a quotation giving the estimated cost for a particular job or service.


04 Sep 2013, 02:54 PM

Good question. In August 2012 Rosenbaum noted:


"We have also started to expand our sales effort with additional representatives, sales assistants, and direct
sales personnel. Although we have allowed our backlog to decrease to a more manageable level to ease the
transition to our new quarters, based on the continuing high level of interest in our products are confident that
orders will increase going forward"


So....if you're going to turn away all that business and all those customers that are tripping over themselves,
why would you ramp up a sales force a year ago - to go after business you aren't allowed to take? And they
state that orders will increase going forward, when they actually have declined?


Very fishy.


The most logical conclusion is they are blaming the horrible performance on the big bad relocation. It's a
pretty stale excuse in my view.


04 Sep 2013, 02:57 PM


InvestorWisdom
It takes a lot of smart planning to land many 7-8 figure orders and quoting CUSTOM work makes it even more
difficult, ESPECIALLY while concentrating on a massive relocation/consolidation.


Did they screw up the move? Yes, i think they took way too long, but this does not mean that demand wont
return now that their focus is turning back to landing this available business.


I just cant see how they are doomed to fail. Their capacity was MAXED before the move and this sector is
closer now than ever from erupting.


04 Sep 2013, 03:01 PM


InvestorWisdom
Again, they make MANY products, in MANY different categories. They could not sell EVERYTHING (during
the move), but were still able to sell $22,000,000 worth of product over that period, which is their 2nd best
year in their history.

Their growth BEFORE the move had maxed their capacity for larger scale stuff, but they are still able to sell
smaller add on equipment, services, materials, parts, etc to new and existing customers, which requires sales
people, right? They did not COMPLETELY shut down, the larger sales force was probably a big step towards
being able to maintain decent sales during the period.

For made-to-order specialty manufacturing companies like this, the Engineers are the ones who quote on the
large custom contracts, not sales people, especially ones that were just hired. You need someone with the
ability to read blueprint, calculate raw material prices, time, etc.


Im sure the company Engineers have to work with their customers Engineers constantly and have a complete
understanding of the complexity and requirements involve with each contract. One bid thats too low can cost
the company a ton of money. They cant rely on salespeople for this.


Sales people handle routine phone calls and orders, like replacement parts, materials sales, etc which can be
done by anyone, even during a move. They dont have the skill to quote complex engineering projects that
require custom modifications. They are just a middle man in the process.

I agree with the fundamental assessment that if orders do not pick up, then the value of this stock will fall
substantially, though my valuation estimate is to c$8 rather than c$5. I do think CVV has been very slow about taking
orders over the last few months, and I believe they've now allowed others (like AIXG) to compete in a space where
they previously seemed to be alone, likely impairing future profits. I am long, though less long than previously, and I
am cautiously optimistic about this one as I wait to see the backlog grow again before adding weight.


The CEO's best possible response over the next couple weeks wouldn't be refuting petty hype claims, but would be
publishing press releases about large graphene orders, or being very candid about order pipeline opportunities and
risks. If I were in his shoes, I wouldn't have bothered responding directly, but would have gotten a PR piece published
about some of my upcoming potential big orders. Something like "CVD in talks for large orders with X and Y". The fact
that he did not respond this way worried me a bit, though he may not want to give away information to competitors
(though I imagine savvy competitors would have an idea of who CVD is talking to already?).

They only release news when a deal is signed, not before, which is wise.


The "we expect too" PRs are usually fluff and not viewed too favorably by the markets.

think the shorts lit a fire under his rear and we will see more news soon.


04 Sep 2013, 09:28 AM


TEWeber
That's a fair point on the fluff pieces being poorly received. I also hope this motivates some more sales action
from CVD.


I was surprised the stock moved so much with this op-ed article, as I assumed most of the financial facts
he/they presented were well known, so all it added to the discussion was the an opinion that orders and sales
will not turn around and CVD's strategy of not having IP is unwise. It also claimed the company is all hype and
has been lying about opportunities, which I think are quite baseless allegations. The stock price response has
inspired me to comment for the first time, as it seems these discussions do have a massive impact on stock
value.


I've put in many hours of DD research and valuation work on this one, and the original article mirrored some
of my own fears and frustrations about declining sales, not being told about the "purposefully reduced orders"
strategy before the move, and the risk that quotations may not turn into new orders.


It was bad form to call the CEO a liar. One could get across the same message that this may be a short
opportunity without saying "hype" and "lies" and instead using the phrase "poor management". For example:


"Sales are declining and there is no backlog left to keep revenue afloat. Without some new orders in the near
term, both revenue and profit will continue to shrink. There appears to be significant risk that CVD's high level
of quotations will not turn into new orders as CVD may have lost their competitive edge through a painful and
poorly-managed facility move. They have admitted to purposefully turning away orders and this may have
pushed customers into the arms of competitors, significantly impairing shareholder value."


04 Sep 2013, 10:04 PM


InvestorWisdom
Its the dumb money that sells instantly when there is a negative opinion piece out. Too many people rely on
others for their DD and do not verify the facts themselves. The just hit the sell button because they assume
others will be selling as well and they want to be first to the exit. The shorts often use this to their advantage,
especially after a stock is up significantly over a short period.


It was not hard to knock the top off this relatively unknown stock, especially when most of the recent buyers
dont have a complete grasp of the sector and events that have transpired. This is exactly what the shorts
used to their advantage.

and suffer the direct blow.


CVV still had $22 million in revs during 2012. Its not like they didn't get anything done, they just couldn't quote
and/or complete as many jobs while concentrating on the move.

I'm not short, but am evaluating it. Average EBITDA is about $2M for last 5 years (due to a $5M blip in 2011 -
in 2012 it was $1.75M).


On a very good day a business like this might be worth 6-8x. Let's be generous and use 8x. That's a $16M
value. Add $5M of net cash and it's basically worth in the $20M range if you could convince a buyer that it's
not falling off a cliff (which it seems to be). So it seems at least 3x overvalued.

04 Sep 2013, 02:02 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
>>So $40,000,000 in assets doesn't add anything to the valuation?<<


Nope. You don't get to double count - either the business is valued as a going concern or you can value it at
liquidation value. Cash is worth cash (say $5M net). The real estate is worth maybe $10M. Maybe 10 cents on the
dollar for "inventory" and used machinery. And of course you have to pay off your liabilities.


>>Their talent, experience, IP and market position doesn't add anything to the valuation?<<


See above. A business is worth the cash it can generate. I see no IP here. If there was they could charge more would
have a return on equity above 1.4% (2012), and an operating margin abovet 6%. Ask yourself why they can't charge
more.


>>The future potential of Nano materials in nearly every aspect of life doesn't add anything to the valuation?<<


Not to this company, so far as I can tell.


>>The fact that they are clean, profitable and rarely dilute (less than 1,500,000 in 6+ years) doesn't add anything to
the valuation?<<


In 2007 the company had 3.3 million shares outstanding, had $14M in sales and $1M in EBITDA. For the last twelve
month the company has $16M in revenue and an EBITDA loss of $1.2M, but the share count is over 6 million.


>>You have a very simplistic way of evaluating stocks.<<


It depends. Small, shrinking, barely profitable, no-moat contract manufacturing businesses I value based on cash
flows.


Cumulative free cash flow for the last decade is about minus $12 million (cash flow from ops minus capital
expenditures).


Show me any other publicly traded company that cleaves its business and turns away customers, let alone for a
mundane facilities move.


We can agree to disagree - you think it's a great investment, I think it's worth about 80% less. That's what makes a
market, no?

I understand that you cannot count the whole asset amount, but my point is that you were not adding this at
all in your valuation, along with everything else. CVD (via FirstNano subsidiary) has grown the longest
Nanotubes every created. They are pioneers in this sector with decades of experience. They are not a tag-
along company. This counts for something, they have a TRUSTED NAME


Most of their past equipment orders were for smaller scale R/D work, but this is changing as these products
start to get mass produced and require larger scale "CUSTOM production equipment", which CVV also
provides. If you think there is no potential to grow with Nano materials, that discredits your whole opinion in
my book. You obviously have not done the DD, but you will see with time. Demand will strip supply of both
equipment and materials. There are no large suppliers for everything CVV offers. CVVs capacity was MAXED
the quarters before the relocation.


"In 2007 the company had 3.3 million shares outstanding"


My statement was correct. Theres been less than 1,500,000 issued since 2007.

Dilution in 2007 does not matter. All public companies issue shares to grow and it worked out well for them.
Whats more important is the dilution SINCE THEN and for what purposes


My comments were 100% factual regardless of what filing i used 6 years ago. They have issued less than
1,500,000 shares since 2007 (after a tranche of growth funding in mid 2007). Thats a FACT and i backed it up
with info from a 2007 filing.


Its disingenuous to try and lead people to believe that they have issued almost 3,000,000 shares (doubled the
OS) since 2007, when after that last tranche of growth funding they issued very little to present (less than
1,500,000 in 6 years). YOU are the one who selectively choose your date to try and twist the point i was
making. You had to go back 6+ years to find dilution that sounded worthy to harp on. Thats misleading

Soooo....there is a magical arbitrary cutoff when dilution matters and when it does not, and you have chosen
2007 as being irrelevant?


Let's review what you wrote:


>>The fact that they are clean, profitable and rarely dilute (less than 1,500,000 shares issued in 6+ years) <<


6+ years.


It's September 4th, 2013. Exactly 6 years ago it was September 4th, 2007.


Exactly 6 years ago CVV had 3.3 Million shares outstanding, per the June 30, 2007 10-Q.


It wasn't until September 25, 2007 that CVD issued 1.2 million shares at $4.75:


http://bit.ly/1dHEacR


Bringing the share count to 4.5 million as of Sep 30 2007.


So that's a big problem for you. It seems that *within* the last 6 years they indeed diluted massively to the
tune of nearly 3M shares. So your "less than 1,500,000 in 6+ years" is proven wrong.


Even though you are proven 100% wrong, it doesn't matter. You just made your statement a few weeks too
early.


The whole thing is silly really, it doesn't change the facts on the ground today - an overvalued no-moat
floundering business. Or so it seems to me.


04 Sep 2013, 04:02 PM


InvestorWisdom
"Soooo....there is a magical arbitrary cutoff when dilution matters and when it does not, and you have chosen
2007 as being irrelevant?"


Yes, that is correct. Dilution for growth in 2007 does not matter now. The ***POINT*** i was making is that
theres been very little dilution since 2007 and that is an absolute fact. Heck, the TOTAL 6,000,000 O/S is
nothing for being in business so long.


Again, trying to make a big stink about a tranche of stock that was issues 6 years ago isn't the type of DD i
care about debating. It maters not in regard to their current situation. If anything, you have proven my point
and demonstrated how responsible they have been with share issuances.

Could it be that you don't realize that the CVD business is very cyclical? 
Their big competitor AIXG has lost money in 2012 and 2013 after big profits in 2011. Their 2nd quarter sales was 175,
46, 44 in 2011,12,13 
CVV made a profit every year and had sales of 7, 7, 4 in those years. 
They were smart enough to regroup during the bad times when nobody was buying semiconductor production
equipment. The cycle is now starting to turn around and they will soar.  
Thanks for giving me an opportunity to load up on the cheap!

I think Kubiko has a point and investorwisdom should accept facts. It seems to me investorwisdom is suffering some
availabillity heuristics... Classic.


I'm long and will stay long. CVD is about a lot more than graphene, and besides that, cashflow analysis alone on a
company that is trying to establish itself in a possible future game changing market (nano, graphene, power supply,
research, etc.) is not sufficient enough. There are deffinitely risks, but the returns on a 10 year horizon can be huge.
Cashflow analysis do not reflect the potentials in companies like this for the far future. As I've stated before, this is not
Apple or MacDonalds for that matter...


I beleive in nano and graphene for the power industry and chip and transhumanism trends that are developing as we
speak. The new UAV technology for the chip industry will be added with elements of graphene within the next 5 years
I think.


You believe in a future potential or not, but to base it on classic fundamentals alone seems a bit to narrow for me.


I'll keep my longs and will add when backlog improves and add more if there is trending improvement.


Good luck.

Ummm, those are granting of restricted stock units. Being given shares for free is a bit different than an open market
purchase, no?

1. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents a contingent right to receive one share of CVD Equipment Corporation's
common stock. 
2. Vesting occurs as to 1,603 common shares, 2,003 common shares, 2,404 common shares, 2,804 common shares,
3,205 common shares and 3,606 common shares respectively on each of November 15, 2013 through 2018. 
3. Any unvested portion will terminate upon termination of service.

Eating crow this morning, Alpha Exposure? Just deserts, hope your short position was really substantial!

Author’s reply »  They did well in terms of contracts expected this quarter. It should take their backlog back to 16-
17mm or about where they were at the end of 2011. It's a good start. I'm down about -10% since writing this and that's
right in line with the russell 2k so not too concerned yet. We will see what the coming quarters bring.

16-17MM backlog? What am I missing? The 10Q states $3.99M as of Sep 30 and $4.2M in orders since - this
would be about $8.2M in backlog (less whatever they have burned through of the $3.99M in the past 6
weeks).


This thing still looks outrageously overvalued to me. If we are back to "normal" operation now this is a $20M
annual business doing about $0 in operating income (even backing out the bad debt expense). With an
enterprise value (adjusting for cash and debt) of $74 million?


Looks like this company has always struggled to eke out $1 or $2M in EBITDA except for 2011.


It's also not clear that the $622K allowance for the bad solar deal covers all it - just management's evaluation.


An upside valuation IMHO would be from an acquirer standpoint:


Take operating income of about zero, add back half the G&A ("synergies that a buyer could blow out) of about
$3M (annual) and add back about $2M in depreciation and this is maybe a $5M EBITDA business to a buyer.
At most you might see 8X (more like 6X as buyers won't pay a lot for synergy), so call it 7X $5M = $35 million.
You can't double count the real estate as it's a needed asset to run the business. But give them some credit
for the $10.7M in cash so call it a $46M EV. Less the $5M in LT debt and you are basically at $40M for the
equity.


That would be about $6.50 per share in an upside scenario for a buyer who can blow out costs. Current
shareholders have to eat the full G&A so I think it's worth far less.


Just back of the envelope here - looks really really overvalued to me, graphene hype notwithstanding.

I haven't shorted it yet but it's on my watch list. I generally don't like shorting companies below $100M market
cap so maybe in the $15 range.

You were warned. I provided extensive research as to why your claims were wrong and this would not go to
$5.


You did not care about the facts/reasons for the slowdown.

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  They said they expect $12 million or orders this quarter. Would take backlog to $16-17
million. I don't see why that's exciting but it's better than they had been doing. They got a big 1x solar order in
the past and then it faded away. I'd like to know what's behind this slug of orders. I still don't see anything
differentiated in their business that means it should trade north of 15x EPS so the stock is already implying
close to $1 in EPS - unrealistic IMO, but the press release (not the Q) was positive so it's not surprising to see
the stock rally.

CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--


CVD Equipment Corporation (Nasdaq: CVV) announced today that it received a multi-million dollar order from a major
aviation component supplier.


Leonard A. Rosenbaum, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We have been working with this customer
since 2010 in developing their next generation of equipment to manufacture their composite products. We are pleased
to have now been awarded this order for a multi-chamber CVD coating system and look forward to also meeting their
future production needs.


“On November 15, 2013 in a press release I had forecast orders for Q4 - October 1, 2013 thru December 31, 2013 to
exceed Twelve Million Dollars ($12M). My timing as to exactly when these expected orders would be placed however
was slightly off. With this order and other orders for the period from October 1, 2013 thru January 31, 2014 we have
now received orders exceeding Twenty-One Million Dollars ($21M).


“Going forward, the Company is well positioned in a number of major areas that should prove beneficial for long term
growth: 1) Sales of research systems to universities, research laboratories and start-up companies; 2) Sales of
Chemical Vapor Deposition systems to industrial customers for current limited production needs; 3) Sales of
advanced industrial manufacturing systems for large scale production; 4) Our wholly owned subsidiary, CVD Materials
Corporation for industrial material coating services; and 5) Our Application Laboratory, to develop processes for next
generation equipment.


“With the increased capacity of our new facility, CVD is positioned to accommodate the opportunities presented to us
as we continue to experience an increase in demand for our products and services - a trend that we anticipate will
continue for many years to come.”
