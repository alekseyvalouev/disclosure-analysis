Summary: Marathon Patent Group, Inc.
(MARA)


Marathon recently announced an agreement for the acquisition of Global Bit Ventures


Inc. that will leave prior common shareholders with just 19% of the company.


GBV was an entity set up only in August of this year and appears to have an undisclosed


security interest with the former CFO, EVP and Secretary of Marathon.


Marathon has multiple concerning parallels to Riot Blockchain, which recently engineered


a similarly dubious pivot to the “blockchain.”


BDO resigned as auditor November 27. Per the �ling “the resignation of BDO was not


recommended by the Company’s audit committee.”


We are urging strong caution to investors in Marathon regardless of one’s views on


blockchain technology.


With “blockchain mania (https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-23/blockchain-


mania-and-mi�d-ii)” in full swing, Marathon Patent Group Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MARA)) has seemingly hitched itself to the blockchain wagon


and rode the wave to nearly 5x returns in a matter of weeks. The company’s blockchain focus


has come about through a series of rapid shifts that are eerily similar to the questionablePrivacy  - Terms


Marathon Patent Group: Bright Red Flags

acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend) (NASDAQ:RIOT


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT)).


In Marathon’s latest 10-Q


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315217013526/form10q.htm) �led


on November 20  the company describes its business as being “to acquire patents and patent


rights and to monetize the value of those assets to generate revenue and pro�t for the


Company.”


Yet despite that stated business model, the company has seemingly abandoned much of its


focus on patents and patent rights and instead shifted gears toward blockchain assets


including cryptomining.


Global Bit Ventures Inc. (GBV) Acquisition
Raises Questions


Rather than purchase cryptomining assets directly from manufacturers or suppliers, the


company decided instead to purchase an entity that owned the cryptomining assets. On


November 2, 2017, the company announced via press release


(https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1166/marathon-patent-group-to-acquire-


global-bit-ventures-inc) that it had “entered into a de�nitive purchase agreement to acquire


100% ownership of Global Bit Ventures Inc. (“GBV”), a digital asset technology company that


mines cryptocurrencies.”


The company has been scant with details on the transaction thus far. On a conference call


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4128185-marathon-patent-groups-mara-ceo-doug-croxall-q3-


2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) following the announcement, the company


detailed that the acquisition includes 1,000 Ethereum mining servers, though it failed to


disclose the cost or value of the servers when asked by an investor. Another investor asked


“How long has the company (GBV) been in existence?” The company declined to disclose this


information as well, suggesting instead that they would wait until an S-4 was �led before


disclosing.


We found the above non-disclosures to be troubling. The agreement with GBV stipulates


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315217012312/form8-k.htm) that


the company is to issue 126,674,557 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the

shares of GBV, which represented roughly $188.7 million at the time of the announcement (and


roughly $750 million at current share prices.) The Agreement And Plan of Merger


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315217012312/ex10-1.htm) �ling by


Marathon detailed the ownership of Company Shareholders (ie: GBV shareholders) at the


closing of the transaction:


Immediately after the conversion of the Company Shares, the Company Preferred


Shares and the conversion of the Company Debt, the Company Shareholders will


own 81.0% of the Parent’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis at the time of


Closing.


Consequently, the agreement and merger plan leaves current Marathon common shareholders


with only 19% of Marathon on a fully diluted basis at the time of closing. Given the extremely


high cost of the acquisition, we would have fully expected the company to answer basic


questions about the value of the assets being acquired and details around the entity.


We decided to check the Nevada Secretary of State �lings


(https://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?


lx8nvq=2JdJ34RbFADWgm%252bUhh%252br2Q%253d%253d&nt7=0) on GBV for ourselves and


we found that the entity was established August 9, 2017, mere months before the transaction


was announced.


We also found that one bene�ciary of the transaction appears be none other than Marathon’s


former CFO, EVP and Secretary, John Stetson. A Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) �ling


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/20171024-global-bit-ventures-ucc-�ling)


shows what appears to be a previously undisclosed security arrangement between HS


Contrarian Investments LLC (“HS Contrarian”) and GBV. HS Contrarian is run by John Stetson,


according to the �rm’s website (https://www.hscontrarian.com/team). Stetson’s previous roles


at Marathon are described in SEC �lings


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1076682/000141588915003237/majesco8k_oct1201

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
It’s unclear from the UCC �ling what the amount of HS Contrarian’s interest is, but the �ling


notes that GBV had agreed not to grant a security interest in the named collateral to any other


entity. Therefore, HS Contrarian’s interest appears to represent the highest seniority in GBV’s


capital structure.


We have contacted Marathon’s investor relations and asked about the relationship between


GBV and Stetson, and whether there was any public disclosure of the relationship. Should we


receive a reply from the company we will update this accordingly.


Aside from the security interest between GBV and Stetson’s �rm, we also noticed another


interesting connection. GBV’s o�cer/director �lings


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/global-bit-ventures-articles-of-incorporation)


with the Nevada Secretary of State only listed one individual, Jesse Sutton. Sutton was the


former CEO and co-founder of Majesco Entertainment, according to his Linkedin Pro�le


(https://www.linkedin.com/in/suttonjesse). The Majesco entity morphed late last year into a


company called PolarityTE through a reverse merger. Stetson is currently the CFO, EVP, and


Director of PolarityTE (https://www.polarityte.com/about/board-of-directors)(NASDAQ:COOL)


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COOL), highlighting that the interwoven business interests


of Stetson and Sutton appear to have converged with GBV.

(On a related note, we wrote an article last week (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4130500-


polarityte-investors-beware) about PolarityTE and its public entity which has been reverse


merged at least six times into a variety of di�erent businesses and which we believe is replete


with its own unique set of red �ags.)


Alarming Parallels With Another Newfangled
“Blockchain” Company, Riot Blockchain


On the subject of executive crossover, Marathon appears to have signi�cant overlap in the


individuals involved with Riot Blockchain, another public company that abruptly reinvented


itself as a blockchain play. A recently amended S-3 �ling


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000555/bioptix_s3.htm) for


Riot shows that Stetson participated in common stock, convertible preferred stock, and


warrant transactions with Riot (note that Riot has recently changed its name from Bioptix Inc.


and that the amended S-3 �ling still re�ects the old company name). Aside from Stetson, the


recently named


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000107997317000620/riot_8k.htm) CEO of


Riot Blockchain, John O’Rourke (http://riotblockchain.com/management-team/), is to hold an


approximate 41.04% stake in the common stock of Marathon per a November 29th prospectus


amendment


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315217013901/form424b3.htm).


Aside from the links with key individuals, we noticed several other parallels with Riot. In our


piece about Riot (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131031-riot-blockchain-sudden-business-


pivot-suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend) we described how Riot also


decided to purchase an entity containing cryptomining equipment and how we believed it to


be an irregular transaction. There is a rush towards the bitcoin revolution


(https://bitcoinrevolution.cloud/bitcoin-revolution-scam/) at the moment, and monitoring for


fraudulent uses of the currency, or concerning acquisitions, is one of the ways the economy


can self-regulate itself. When examining Riot’s transaction side by side with Marathon’s we


identi�ed the following:


Riot announced the purchase (https://ir.riotblockchain.com/press-releases/detail/14/riot-


blockchain-enters-agreement-for-acquisition-of-1200) of its cryptomining entity on


November 2nd, the exact same day that Marathon announced its own purchase


(https://ir.marathonpg.com/press-releases/detail/1166/marathon-patent-group-to-


acquire-global-bit-ventures-inc) of an entity containing cryptomining assets.


Both entities being acquired were incorporated in Nevada.


Both entities being acquired had short corporate histories. Privacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

Both deals were non-cash, dilutive stock transactions.


Both Riot and Marathon seemingly paid above-market rates to acquire entities containing


cryptomining equipment that could have been purchased directly.


We �nd it concerning that these two separate companies both enacted dramatic pivots toward


blockchain business models seemingly in lockstep and in such unusual fashion.


BDO Resigned As Auditor Just Weeks Ago


The company recently announced that BDO had resigned as its auditor near the end of


November. Per an 8-K �ling


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315217014039/form8-k.htm):


On November 27, 2017, the Company received notice from its independent registered


public accounting �rm, BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”), that it resigned as the Company’s


auditor e�ective immediately. The resignation of BDO was not recommended by the


Company’s audit committee nor was the audit committee’s approval required.


Per the same 8-K �ling


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1507605/000149315217014039/form8-k.htm), on


November 30, 2017, the board appointed RBSM LLP as the company’s independent registered


public accounting �rm. We checked the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)


website and found the latest inspection report


(https://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Reports/Documents/104-2017-023-RBSM.pdf) on RBSM


(https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?


FirmID=FF52C953BA4C311AE62ACA93859166BE). The report highlighted what appeared to be


some signi�cant de�ciencies:


Certain de�ciencies identi�ed were of such signi�cance that it appeared to the


inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained


su�cient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the �nancial


statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the


applicable �nancial reporting framework. In other words, in these audits, the auditor


issued an opinion without satisfying its fundamental obligation to obtain reasonable


assurance about whether the �nancial statements were free of material


misstatement. Privacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The report went on to detail individual failures relating to audit procedures on several of its


issuer clients. In one instance it noted a “failure to perform su�cient procedures to test the


existence, completeness, and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business


combinations.”


Given the unusual business combination with GBV as detailed above, we hope that RBSM has


taken steps to ensure that going forward it follows audit procedures relating to business


combinations (and in general).


Note that the PCAOB report also underscored that “the fact that one or more de�ciencies in an


audit reach this level of signi�cance does not necessarily indicate that the �nancial statements


are materially misstated” and that inspection teams are limited to information available from


the auditor. Nonetheless, we view the resignation of BDO and the replacement with a lesser-


known �rm of questionable quality to be another reason to tread carefully.


Conclusion


We have no strong bearish or bullish view on the future of blockchain technology. We


genuinely hope the technology is implemented broadly and that currency and information can


be e�ectively decentralized through its use. Regardless of one’s views on blockchain technology


however, we think Marathon is a name that investors should avoid. We urge cautious investing


to all.
