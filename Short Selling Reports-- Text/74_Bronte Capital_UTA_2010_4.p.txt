The sometimes eccentric views of John Hempton

Follow up on the Universal Travel Group post
I woke up this morning  to find people on the Yahoo chat board saying that I should be hanged and 
the company saying they deny “all the allegations contained in the blog” and telling me they “will be
aggressively pursuing all legal remedies.”


To the latter there is a simple defense to this – which is to demonstrate that their site did not work.  I
have done so with a video (now placed on YouTube).  I am not going to embed it because it is frankly
boring as most of my readers would know how to book a plane flight or a hotel online anyway.


Several journalists wanted my comment – and it was the same… just test it out.  Everything needed
to verify my blog post can be done from your office in your little hedge fund or in the SEC.  Journalists
both inside China and outside China have asked me for comment – and the comment is the same…
just try and book certain things with the website.


I was explicit – there is an old-fashioned phone-based travel agency underlying this site.  If you are in
China and you give your 11 digit mobile phone number there are many places where you think you
are going to complete the booking process online and then a box turns up to expect a phone call from
a person to actually complete the booking process.


As far as we can tell this is not an internet travel agent in that you cannot finalize a transaction online. 
This is from a company that once said this in their press release: 


The new website will integrate the Company's three previous, separate ones (Classic,
TRIPEASY, and Easytrip versions) into a single more integrated and streamlined
platform. Accessible via http://www.cnutg.com , the website is a result of a year of
research and development based on customer ratings and feedback. It offers
comprehensive and timely travel information and services, including guaranteed low
prices, high visual appeal, map support technology and easy payment functions.
Additionally, new functionality such as the ability for customers to purchase cell phone
minutes using the website should drive additional customers to the site.


My explore found no map functionality, no online payment mechanism, no formalized customer
feedback system – indeed very limited cookies.  There was a distinct lack of information (fare terms,
reasonable sized pictures of hotels etc).  The site did not match the press release. 
You can still however buy many things offline.  As I said – there is a travel agent there – one that pays
real commissions out.


Alas there were some things we could not find any way to buy with the website at all such as
international hotels.  That is despite the company announcing a partnership with Agoda (Priceline). 
This was what the Agoda announcement said:


Under the agreement, Universal Travel Group will offer its customers access to Agoda’s
international network of hotels. Through the updated cnutg.com website, travelers will
be able to enjoy special Agoda promotions and instant confirmation at tens of
thousands of hotels worldwide.  Through this partnership with Universal Travel Group,
Agoda intends to increase its exposure in the large Chinese travel market.


The press release announcing this partnership had contact phone numbers from Universal Travel
Group and no contact phone number from Priceline.  Anybody want to check with Priceline
management how much business Universal Travel are doing with Agoda?


That said the company has fixed a few things on the website since my post.  For instance the English
tab on beta.cnutg.com now works.  It did not work prior – and the first I heard about it working was
when I was flicking through the posts on Yahoo (if only to identify any direct death threats).  Also the
“pick up at the airport in Shenzen” option has been disabled for me – but as of a few minutes ago it
was still available for a journalist in Beijing when he tried to book a flight out of Beijing.  Also now
rather than some error messages I am now getting a “we will dial you back to complete” message
which is clearly an improvement.

Posted by John Hempton at 4:59 PM  


But life is not about travel companies in Shenzen and their trolls on the Yahoo chat board thinking you
should be hanged.  Life is joyous.  Travel is one of the things that is fun – and so is YouTube. As I
said, I made a YouTube video of me testing the site – and showing some of the glitches – especially
the international hotels glitch.  Alas it is boring and this blog aims to entertain.


So rather than think about me being hanged I suggest you look at this interpretation of Lady Gaga.  It
made my day…

John, 
 
Whether it was your intention or not, you have caused the UTA stock to fall and it's
shareholders to suffer losses and damages. If UTA doesn't sue you, I am sure that a few
angry investors with deep pockets (and investments/long-positions in UTA) will probably
come after you. They may not succeed but you're going to have to deal with some legal
hassles which I am sure you're not new to. 
 
In any case, I hope you've learned a lesson. If you're going to write an "independent"
research about a public company, and then short it, you better be prepared to defend
your actions. 
 
Best defense is to say that you contacted UTA and asked about the "questions" about the
Internet Travel agency issues -- and they did nothing or did not respond. In your case,
you didn't even bother to contact the company and inquire why the website did not work
or function the way you expected. You just went out on a witch-hunt to advance your own
agendas -- without giving UTA a chance to defend itself. Sorry John... but that's pretty
shady...

Well done John. Look's like you've flushed out another bunch of fraudsters. Here's an
article just published in the NY Post. 
 
------------------------------ 
 
One of the biggest mysteries on Wall Street yesterday surrounded a little-known, publicly
traded Chinese travel company, Universal Travel Group, which came under fire for being
built on air. 
 
The questions started flying after Australian money manager, John Hempton of Bronte
Capital, posted a blog item saying the online booking and travel company, which is listed
on the prestigious New York Stock Exchange, has very few real services. 
 
"It looks like this travel site is all front end, no-back end -- there is no actual booking, no
mechanism of collecting payment -- no nothing really," Hempton said on his blog,
referring to the site, en.cnutg.com. 
Universal Travel ringing the NYSE bell on June 30. 
Universal Travel ringing the NYSE bell on June 30. 
 
Hempton said he tried and failed to book a hotel. And when he tried to buy a flight, the
Web site told him to pick up his ticket in a city nowhere near to where he was traveling to
or from. 
 
When the report surfaced, shares in the company plummeted, dropping as much as 31
percent before closing at $3.86, down 19 percent. 
 
The company denied the allegations and said Universal Travel "will be aggressively
pursuing all legal remedies against Bronte Capital and John Hempton for the damages
caused." 
 
But the mystery didn't end there. 
 
Universal Travel raised $20 million in June through a secondary offering of 2.85 million
shares at $7 each. 
 
The Bronte report was posted one day after the end of the lock-up period following the
offering -- during which insiders are not allowed to sell shares. It could not be learned if
investors fleeing the shares yesterday included insiders. 
 
The investment firms that underwrote and managed the June offering, Brean Murray
Carret and Rodman & Renshaw, didn't respond to requests for comment. 
 
In the afternoon, the company's most recent auditor, Acquavella Chiarelli Shuster
Berkower, didn't help matters. 
 
"We're no longer their auditors. I have nothing to say to you," said Dave Svoboda, a
member of the firm, told a reporter seeking information. 
 
Shortly after that, Barry Kitt, a big investor in Chinese companies and general partner in
the Plano, Texas, hedge fund, Pinnacle Fund, said, "I don't own the stock so I don't care,"
before hanging up the phone. 
 
Kitt is listed as the company's 11th largest investor, with 0.75 percent of the outstanding
shares as of the end of June. 
 
Universal Travel, which is based in Shenzhen, China, was flying high only recently. On
June 30, CEO Jianping "Jenny" Jiang rang the opening bell on the NYSE. 
 
The stock moved to the Big Board in October 2009, after being accepted on the American
Stock Exchange in May of that year.

artistes do the hard yards as you do and dig out the truth rather than spread rumor.

John - I can't find anything wrong with what you did. I don't see any outlandish claims, it
seems you're just the messenger. Which brings up an old saying: "Don't shoot the
messenger" 
 
to Kenneth, commenting above: John doesn't need to defend his actions - there's nothing
to defend. He said you can't book trips online via this "online" travel site. it's not debatable
- it's fact.

Congrats, John, 
for that research. I`ve seen some comparable thorough work of short sellers in my life,
but they never made it public.  
You have been open and transparent so the only legal hassle I'd expect is for the UTA
management. Keep up the good work.

Since i actually work in one of the largest Online travel sites in the World, I know a thing
or two. I tried a simple negative test. I tried to Depart on 23 September and Return on the
20th September. Yes, you should not be able to even continue with this selection past the
first page. However, on this website there was no error and it let me select flights for both
legs of the trip. 
 
Then during the confirmation screen the return date automatically was changed to the
23rd ( the date of departure ), without even telling me. Try this on a site like
travelocity.com where the Return date is selected before the Departure Date. You will see
an error ( Your entered date is invalid. Please enter or select a different date.). This is the
simplest form of error checking that a travel website could do. I am shocked that even this
is not in place.

John how much did you make by shorting the stock yesterday? Accusing the company of
being a fraud and then saying that the web site needs some improvements are two
different things...

John, 
 
You are very dishonest in this new post. Your previous post clearly claimed that UTA is a
"fraud" to benefit your short position. The article was written without minimal amount of
due diligence. 
 
UTA is primarily a domestic company in China, serving primarily second and third tier
cities there. Its primary products to package tour - sold via agents. It had almost no
international exposure so far, except some attempt by the company to partner with
Priceline. 
 
You clearly do not understand how online booking is done within China, made no attempt
to contact the company when you discovered deficiencies in company's English version
of the web site, and mis-represented company's financial. Yet you are just a "messenger". 
 
BTW, the Chinese version of the web site works fine, and has much richer functionalities.

I never even received an email on creating an account there. When i did a hotel
reservation in China, I got a standard message :"Success! Your order has been
completed! Please check your email for details regarding your hotel reservation. 
# ● If there are any problems, please call us toll-free at 400-888-9966." 
 
I had not even logged in. I wonder how they will send me the email :)

"Whether it was your intention or not, you have caused the UTA stock to fall and it's
shareholders to suffer losses and damages. If UTA doesn't sue you, I am sure that a few
angry investors with deep pockets (and investments/long-positions in UTA) will probably
come after you. " 
 
He did no such thing. If UTA is a fraud, then those investors' stakes are worth nothing to
begin with -- only they don't know it yet. The shares would have continued to trade down
and they would have eventually lost everything. This is the difference between a "paper
loss" and an "economic loss". If anything, John simply brought the economic loss into the
open. 
 
Then again, if John is wrong, then UTA stock will eventually recover, and those investors
should be thanking John to be given an opportunity to buy more cheap stock. 
 
Besides, JH made no misstatements of fact and therefore is not liable for anything. The
company is not going to do anything -- and in fact if they really try to make a big mess out
of it, their fraud would become even more exposed to the world, and they would shoot
themselves in the foot.

Mike, 
 
"Then again, if John is wrong, then UTA stock will eventually recover, and those investors
should be thanking John to be given an opportunity to buy more cheap stock." 
 
If the company is NOT fradulent and John Hempton was wrong, then there will be
investors and took a HUGE loss in the past 2 days. What about those investors? 
 
They suffered REAL losses based on a misleading article written by John Hempton. Not
only that, but Hempton took a short position on UTA stock so he's incentivized to say
negative things about the company. Whether the facts are accurate or not, real investors
suffered REAL losses because they sold in panick over what Hempton wrote. Hempton's
article did not paint an accurate picture of the company -- and did not contact the
company to provide a balanced, unbiased view. 
 
Moreover, John Hempton did not provide disclosures on whether he owned or shorted the
stock or the timing of his trades on UTA. Did he own a short position before writing the
stock or only after writing about the fraud allegations? He did not disclose this and thus,
his article and his actions seem extremely shady.

John, while I am all with you on the general issue, I have no problem with taking the
return flight before the departure. Airlines might not like this for nonlinear pricing
reasons[*], but for mathematically trained people there should be no problem with that. Of
course the significantly larger half of the population would probably get confused by it... 
 
 
[*] I have flown on the same airplane with two tickets from different airlines (code
sharing). It was a hassle to make sure the seat next to me stayed empty, but ultimately
they've figured it out. No double miles nor booze though. Similarly people sometimes skip
legs of their flights, which may or may not be legal in some areas of the globe. Saturday
stay is another issue. Stupid fine print.

Well done John, you deserve to benefit from your research. Hope your short was
extremely profitable. Kenneth, Kenneth, UTA management has a responsibility to deliver
on their grandiose plans; they should be sued for talking up the stock and making fanciful
mis-statements!!  
Investors who have been misled by CEO 'Jenny' should be asking for some answers. She
however is safely tucked away in China where her investors cannot book a flight to on
their own companies' website. Why did they not do their due diligence on this like

volume/liquidity and making rich people richer. 
 
nicely done John. great analysis and I'm sure you saved some pensioners future losses
by uncovering this clearly ridiculous fraud. 
 
Look forward to more research on companies you're short

@Kenneth: 
Are you serious? First, did you read the article - there WAS disclosure that he was short.
It makes no sense to - and I mean, no sense, unless _you_ are up to something unethical
- to make an accusation that is so clearly false (you should do more than look for the
keywords "Disclosure:" even though that would suffice. Did you read the article? 
And the "investors who suffered real losses" based on his misleading article? Well, if you
are an investor, you can ride it out until he is proven wrong. They are "investors" right -
can hold for more than a day or two, no? (And "misleading" - love to hear a bit of concrete
justification for that accusation!) 
 
Do you not acknowledge the tiny chance that the investors actually lost money by
investing in a less-than-adequately presented enterprise (in English we call this fxxxx)
and the only harm they suffered was not being able to unload their losses onto an even
greater fool? Is this not even conceivably possible? 
 
We need to call ask the CFO to clarify things and put JH in his place. Or the accoutants.
Or the auditors. Or NYSE. Oops, what a coincidence, such bad timing. Oops, how
unlucky. Oops. Oops again. My what bad luck.

@ Everyone short 
 
It's so sad that you are all siding with John Hempton on his article whereas (well it's
obvious since you'll find more loyal Hempton fans on his blog than those like me, who are
trying to make sense of it all). 
 
In any case, the REAL sad part of this whole thing is that you've all made the
CONCLUSION that UTA is fraudulent and a scam. 
 
This is UNTRUE, well, at least not proven yet. As in the rule of Law, in the United States
at least, INNOCENT until proven GUILTY. 
 
You (John included based on his analysis) have ALL written this company off as a scam,
fraud, shell of a company, etc. However, you have not even given the company a chance
to respond to these allegations. You've all come up with this conclusion on your own and
from Hempton's comments -- which are of course, biased because he is SHORT. 
 
It's so sad...you're all making this incredible CONCLUSION that UTA is a scam -- without
any facts except that the website has problems -- to back it up. 
 
Yes, I will concede that their INTERNET travel website SUCKS and has REAL issues.
However, problems with a website (my company develops websites for a living) does not
translate into fraud. Just because Yahoo or Google's websites are down or experiencing
problems or technical glitches, DOES NOT MAKE GOOGLE OR YAHOO FRAUDLENT

COMPANIES. 
 
Sheesh, I know you are all short and have an incentive for the company to fall -- but
seriously, stop drawing conclusions based on one person's opinion that UTA's website is
crappy. Crappy website does not equal fraudulent company. It means they need to hire
better engineers to fix up their website! 
 
WAKE UP PEOPLE and STOP THE WITCH-HUNTING. You've already made profits on
your short positions -- and IF (thats a big IF) this company truly is empty and fraudulent
as Hempton accuses, then I will eat my words and come back and post a public apology
on this blog. 
 
However, UNTIL THIS HAPPENS, I will continue to defend what I believe -- which is, UTA
has a crappy website, but is far from a scam.

I need to speak a little about travel in China. China is a large country with an enormous
emerging middle class and this class will travel. That said, I need to mention "Universal
Travel Group, (UTA) en.cnutg.com. There is a guy from, Bronte Capital, that badblogged
this Chinese online travel company, Universal Travel Group. Seems his worst fear is that
the website, (en.cnutg.com) is acting funny. I tried it and it is acting funny, slow at some
corners plain stupid at other turns, but for the most part OK. To this I say, I have been in
the online travel biz since 1996 and I saw Hotels.com grow up and have growing pains,
I've seen Travolocity.com go through digital nightmares, Orbitz.com destroyed a whole
online community of affiliates in one fail swoop. All i'm saying, is that, we growers, have
all had our growing pains. Universal Travel Group, (UTA) wants to compete and it will and
it will also fix the bugs, (bugs are never completely fixed, just as Micro something or
another). To all this I say "This to shall pass".

Kenneth - what you seem to fail to understand is that if John Hempton is wrong, then a
selloff in UTA stock is a blessing to you and anyone else who wants to be long UTA. It's
nothing more than an opportunity to buy more stock cheaper. 
 
You seem to have some bizarre idea of what is "right" and "wrong" in investing. there are
certainly unscrupulous people out there who spread rumors about stocks in attempts to
manipulate them, but John Hempton's post here, even if he turns out to be wrong, is not
anywhere near that category.
