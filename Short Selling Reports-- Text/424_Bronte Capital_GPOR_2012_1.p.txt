Wexford Capital and Gulfport Energy
Gulfport Energy is a reputable Oklahoma based oil and gas company with widespread interests
including in Canadian oil sands (via Grizzly Oil Sands) and in the Utica shale. It trades on the
NASDAQ and has a market cap of a little over 1.2 billion dollars. The ticker is GPOR. 
 
 
Wexford Capital is a reputable hedge fund and investment group based in Greenwich Connecticut
with (according to the website) $5.6 billion in assets under management. That is more than 100
times what we manage. 
 
 
The principal of Wexford is Charles E Davidson. He has a fine CV which I have cribbed from the
website: 
 
 


Charles E. Davidson, 59, co-founded Wexford in 1994 and serves as its Chairman and
Chief Investment Officer.  Mr. Davidson has primary responsibility for the overall
strategic direction of Wexford’s investment activities and serves as the senior
portfolio manager for the Wexford Spectrum Funds and the Wexford Catalyst Funds.
 From 1984-94, Mr. Davidson was a General Partner of Steinhardt Partners, L.P. where
he was responsible for all fixed income arbitrage, risk arbitrage, private equity,
distressed/bankruptcy and special situation investments of the multi-billion dollar
hedge fund.  From 1977-84, Mr. Davidson was employed by Goldman Sachs & Co.
where he was the head of domestic corporate bond trading and proprietary trading.
 Mr. Davidson holds an MBA and a BA in economics from the University of California –
Los Angeles.


Last week I read the proxy for Gulfport Energy which goes through the relationship with Wexford.
There, properly disclosed, are many related party transactions. 
 
 
The hedge fund I run is (apart from the management contract) involved in no related party
statements so I find complex related party transactions surprising. However, as I said, they are
properly disclosed. Here are a list of related party transactions from the last proxy: 
 
 
 


... Based solely on Form 4 filed with the SEC on March 13, 2012 by Charles E.
Davidson. Represents 5,336,526 shares of common stock held by CD Holding Company,
LLC. Mr. Davidson is the manager and a member of CD Holding Company, LLC and the
Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of Wexford Capital LP...


... We are a party to administrative service agreements with Stampede Farms LLC,
which we refer to as Stampede Farms, Everest Operations Management LLC, which we
refer to as Everest, and Tatex Thailand III, LLC, which we refer to as Tatex III. Under
these agreements, our services include professional and technical support and the
fees for such services can be amended by mutual agreement of the parties. Each of
these administrative service agreements may be cancelled (1) by us with at least 60
days prior written notice and, (2) by the counterparty at any time with at least 30
days prior written notice to us and (3) by either party if the other party is in material
breach and such breach has not been cured within 30 days of receipt of written notice
of such breach. We did not provide services under any of these agreements in 2011
and received no reimbursements thereunder. Each of Stampede Farms, Everest and
Tatex III is controlled by Wexford Capital LP, or Wexford...

additional payment of $6,152,000. The remaining interests in Bison are owned by
entities controlled by Wexford, including Windsor Permian LLC, or Windsor. Bison
owns and operates drilling rigs. 


During the fourth quarter of 2011, we purchased a 25% ownership interest in Muskie
Holdings LLC, or Muskie, at a cost of $2,142,000, subject to adjustment. The
remaining interests in Muskie are owned by entities controlled by Wexford,
including Windsor. Muskie holds certain assets, real estate and rights in a lease
covering land in Wisconsin that is prospective for mining oil and natural gas fracture
grade sand...


... Effective as of November 1, 2007, we and Windsor entered into an area of mutual
interest agreement to jointly acquire oil and gas leases in the Permian Basin. The
agreement provides that each party must offer the other party the right to
participate in 50% of each such acquisition. The parties also agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, to share third-party costs and expenses in proportion to their
respective participating interests and pay certain other fees as provided in the
agreement. During 2011, we acquired approximately 604 net acres from Windsor
under the terms of this agreement for an aggregate of $1,102,000. Windsor is
controlled by Wexford. 


Windsor is the operator of all of our acreage in the Permian Basin. As operator of
these properties, Windsor is responsible for the daily operations, monthly operation
billings and monthly revenue disbursements for the properties in which we hold an
interest. For the year ended December 31, 2011, Windsor billed us approximately
$56,103,000 and at December 31, 2011, we owed $5,593,000 for these services. 


Effective April 1, 2010, we entered into an area of mutual interest agreement with
Windsor Niobrara LLC, which we refer to as Windsor Niobrara, to jointly acquire oil
and gas leases on certain lands located in Northwest Colorado for the purpose of
exploring, exploiting and producing oil and gas from the Niobrara Formation. The
agreement provides that each party must offer the other party the right to
participate in such acquisitions on a 50/50 basis. The parties also agreed, subject to
certain exceptions, to share third-party costs and expenses in proportion to their
respective participating interests and pay certain other fees as provided in the
agreement. We are the operator of this acreage in the Niobrara Formation. As
operator, we are responsible for daily operations, monthly operation billings and
monthly revenue disbursements for these properties. For the year ended December
31, 2011, we billed Windsor Niobrara $6,642,000 and, at December 31, 2011, Windsor
Niobrara owed us $3,557,000 for these services. Windsor Niobrara is controlled by
Wexford. 


In February 2011, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to
acquire certain leasehold interests in acreage located in the Utica Shale in Ohio. The
agreement also granted us an exclusive right of first refusal for a period of six months
on certain additional tracts leased by the seller. As of December 31, 2011, we had
acquired leasehold interests in approximately 98,000 gross (49,000 net) acres in the
Utica Shale in Eastern Ohio under these and other agreements for approximately
$118,421,000. As of February 20, 2012, we had closed on additional acquisitions
bringing our leasehold interests to approximately 107,000 gross (53,500 net) acres.
We have commitments with various future closing dates that could increase our
acreage position in the Utica Shale to an aggregate of approximately 125,000 gross
(62,500 net) leasehold acres. Entities affiliated with Wexford, primarily Windsor Ohio
LLC, or Windsor Ohio, participated with us on a 50/50 basis in the acquisition of the
leases described above and, at December 31, 2011, held leasehold interests in
approximately 49,000 net acres for which they paid approximately $118,413,000,
excluding fees and expenses of $1,184,000 billed under the acquisition team
agreement described below. We are the operator on this acreage in the Utica Shale. 


Effective July 1, 2008, we entered into an acquisition team agreement with Everest
to identify and evaluate potential oil and gas properties in which we and Everest or
its affiliates may wish to invest. Pursuant to this agreement, Gulfport and Everest
each agreed to form an acquisition team. Upon a successful closing of an acquisition
or divestiture, the party whose acquisition team identified the acquisition or
divestiture is entitled to receive a fee from the other party and its affiliates, if
applicable, participating in such closing. The fee is equal to 1% of the party’s
proportionate share of the acquisition or divestiture consideration. The agreement
has a one-year term unless earlier terminated by either party upon 30 days notice. 


From time to time, certain of our petroleum engineers provide services relating to
evaluation of potential investments to Wexford and geological evaluations, seismic
review and similar services to Tatex II and Tatex III. Wexford, Tatex II and Tatex III,

respectively, have agreed to reimburse us based on the amount, scope and nature of
services provided by our petroleum engineers to such entities. We did not provide any
services under these arrangements in 2011.


 
As you can see there are considerable (properly disclosed) related party transactions with Wexford.
Helpfully they include a summary:
 


Our Relationships with Wexford and its Affiliates 


Charles E. Davidson is the Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of Wexford and he
beneficially owned approximately 16.8% of our outstanding common stock as of
December 31, 2011. Wexford is the manager of the Wexford-controlled entities
described above. As manager, Wexford has the exclusive authority to, among other
things, purchase, hold and dispose of the assets of each such entity. Mr. Liddell, our
Chairman of the Board, is the operating member and, in some cases, an officer, of
certain of these entities. All distributions made by these entities are first paid to the
Wexford members in accordance with their respective ownership interests until they
have received amounts equal to their respective capital contributions. Thereafter,
distributions are to be made 90% to the Wexford members in accordance with their
respective ownership interests and 10% to Mr. Liddell. Mr. Liddell is not currently
entitled to, and has not received, distributions from any of these entities. All
transactions between us and these entities are reviewed and approved by our
independent directors.


 
All for thought and consideration of my readers.
 
 
 
John
 
Disclosure: We are short Gulfport Energy and have been for some time. We recently increased the
position.

In principle that could just mean that Wexford is a big (controlling?) shareholder in
Gulfport and Davidson has a lot of his own money in Wexford as an LP. (It may not mean
that ... but it is a possibility).

@SB 
 
Gulfport only has 55mm shares floated, so 5% would be ~2mm shares.  
 
According to their most recent SC 13G/A, the only entity to own more than 2mm shares is
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.  
 
I wouldn't be surprised if Davidson has his own money in Wexford as an LP but you'd
think that would merit disclosure.

So, it smells a little by rewarding a large shareholder with multiple contracts. What is the
total annual value of these contracts? Is it enough to singk the stock? 
 
Is that why you are short, just because it smells?

Certainly the potential for self-dealing is huge.

Wow. I've never seen so many related party transactions in one place with a single
related party.  
 
It's unusual. Reminds me of private equity where they invest a ton of LP money in a
company, then pay themselves a bevy of fees and finally get a nice carried interest if the
investment actually works out.  
 
I wonder if Gulfport employees all have to buy their cars at a particular dealership
controlled by Wexford? 
 
Does this come up on their quarterly earnings calls?

So Gulfport lends money to Grizzly. Grizzly pays PIK interest since it is not generating
any cash flow and then they do a debt-for-equity swap. How come the ownership
structure does not change? Do you think Wexfort also had a loan that was pro rata to
their ownership?

Some of these comments, not to mention the reality that situations like GPOR have
existed in the past, currently exist, and will continue to exist in the future ... lead me to the
belief that people either don't read the fucking (excuse my french) SEC filings, and/or if
they do, they're no better than sheep that go 'Baaaaah!' 
 
Maybe it's me, maybe I'm missing something...but I really would using the 'other' F-bomb.
I may in the future.

Regarding the complexity of Wexford's relationship with Gulfport in Ohio. 
 
Rhino Resources touted by Wexford - 
http://beta.fool.com/insidermonkey/2012/... 
 
files regarding to agreement with Gulfport and Windsor a Wexford affiliate pertaining to
Gulfport lease activity in Ohio.

All in all Wexford appears to have a very complex relationship with its clients
