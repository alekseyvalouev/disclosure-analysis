Samsonite International SA (HK: 1910), the world’s largest luggage maker, is listed in Hong Kong and headquartered in 


Mansfield, Massachusetts, in the United States.  Despite a history of mediocrity which included lurching from the precipice 


of one restructuring to another, today Samsonite trades near all-time highs.  Indeed, Samsonite trades at a premium valuation 


in line with luxury brands such as Burberry (BRBY) on an EV/EBITDA multiple.  We believe this premium is entirely 


unjustified, especially given Samsonite’s questionable accounting practices and poor corporate governance.       





We suspect that Samsonite has concealed slowing growth through debt fueled acquisitions and that it has massaged earnings 


and inflated margins through highly questionable purchase price accounting.  Samsonite should trade at a discount to its 


peers because of corporate governance concerns regarding its audit profile, dodgy related party transactions between the 


Company and Indian entities controlled by the CEO and his family, and CEO’s Ramesh Tainwala’s resume fraud of claiming 


to be a doctor when he is not.  


Samsonite is a mid-level brand masquerading as a premium luxury player.  Samsonite is more sensibly compared to a peer 


group of mid-tier brands such as Michael Kors (KORS), Tapestry (TPR) and PVH.N.  Using this peer group, we value 


Samsonite as a blended average of four methodologies yielding a share price of HKD 17.59 per share, 48% below 


Samsonite’s last traded price.   





We also call on Samsonite’s board of directors, and in particular the audit committee, to appoint an independent audit firm 


to scrutinize all transactions involving its South Asian joint venture, the Company’s treatment of inventory, its purchase price 
accounting and disclosed and undisclosed connections between Samsonite and its CEO.  Ultimately, we believe that 


Samsonite is simply carrying too much baggage to trade at such a high premium. 





1. Purchase Price Accounting Games.  We believe that Samsonite has used purchase price accounting to inflate margins 


and earnings, masking what we believe to be a core business which is likely struggling.  Like an addict searching for 


its next fix, Samsonite has already announced its search for its next acquisition (in women’s handbags).  The market 


should be skeptical. 





a. Tumi: Payables from Thin Air.  On August 1, 2016, Samsonite acquired US-listed bag maker Tumi Holdings 


Inc. (“Tumi”) for $1.8 billion.  Samsonite paid 13.6x EV/EBITDA for Tumi, leaving the Company with $1.88 


billion in debt.  In its last 10-Q filed with the SEC prior to the acquisition, Tumi reported only $39 million in 


accounts payable as of June 26, 2016.  Yet in Samsonite’s purchase price accounting of the Tumi acquisition, 


Samsonite claimed that Tumi had $139 million of payables as of August 1, 2016, $100 million more than Tumi 


reported just one month earlier.  Tumi’s payables were historically predictable and were subject to short term 


maturities.  To put it in context, in the previous 10 quarters, Tumi had never reported over $48 million in payables 


(and never more than $79 million if we include accrued expenses).  Yet Samsonite’s purchase price accounting 


valued Tumi’s trade and other payables at an amount almost exceeding Tumi’s pre-acquisition balance of total 


liabilities.  In our view, this is a significant red flag and evidence of purchase price accounting games.  By 


overstating Tumi’s balance of payables at acquisition, we estimate that Samsonite can avoid having to run at least 


$62-$100 million in subsequent expenses through its income statement, thereby artificially inflating reported 


profits.  This amount is material given Samsonite’s slim margins and likely enabled the misperception of growth 


upon which its premium valuation is based.  





b. Tumi’s Asian Distributors: Under-Reported Inventory Balance.  In 2017, Samsonite acquired Tumi’s Asian 


distributors (including China) for $64.9 million.  Notably, Samsonite’s purchase price accounting reported only 


$9.4 million in acquired inventory, despite CEO Ramesh Tainwala admitting on a conference call that the acquired 


distributors carried 5-6 months of inventory on their balance sheets at the time of their acquisition. Acquired 


inventory

Samsonite International S.A.│ HK: 1910                                                                www.blueorcacapital.com 





inventory should be marked at the cost such distributors previously purchased such inventory from Tumi.  Yet 


Tumi sold $71 million in Asia in 2H 2016, primarily to Asian distributors.  Excluding online sales and sales to 


Japan, India, Thailand and Indonesia, we calculate that the markets for the acquired distributors accounted for 


68.9% of Tumi’s Asian sales.  If Tumi’s sales to the acquired Asian distributors were an estimated $46.4 million 


in 2H 2016, and such distributors carried six months of inventory on their balance sheet upon acquisition, then 


the value of acquired inventory should be $46.4 million, not $9.4 million as reported by Samsonite.  We believe 


that Samsonite played inappropriate purchase price accounting games by marking down the value of acquired 


inventory by 80% at the time of the purchase, thereby allowing it to claim inflated margins when such inventory 


was later sold. That would also explain why margins did not erode in Asia when simple logic indicated there 


would be compression. 





2. Zero Margin Inventory Foreshadows Falling Profitability.  Pursuant to IFRS rules, Samsonite carries its inventories 


at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”).  By definition, any inventory carried at NRV will not be sold 


for a positive gross margin (as it is valued below cost).  At FYE 2017, Samsonite reported that $229.6 million of its 


inventory was carried at NRV, on a year-end balance of only $542 million in finished goods.  At FYEs 2016 and 2017, 


Samsonite carried 46% and 42%, respectively, of finished goods at NRV, or in other words, below cost and at a price 


where Samsonite does not expect to make a profit! This raises a troubling question.  If at the beginning of Samsonite’s 


most recent fiscal year, almost half of the finished inventory on its balance sheet was carried at below cost, how did the 


Company maintain its margins in FY 2017?  Samsonite supposedly turns its inventory once every four months, meaning 


the zero-margin inventory should have worked its way through the Company’s income statement in FY 2017.  But 


margins were mysteriously unaffected.  One possibility is that Samsonite is simply hoarding a growing balance of stale 


inventory, but this trick cannot work indefinitely.  Eventually, such inventory balances must either be written off or 


sold at or below cost – at which point the Company’s margins will come crashing down.     





3. CEO Resume Fraud.  Samsonite’s CEO, Ramesh Tainwala, has at various points in his career held himself out as a 


doctor.  Although his bio on Samsonite’s website currently omits the reference, on Bloomberg, and in other media 


sources and regulatory filings, his bio lists a Doctorate Degree in Business Administration from the Union Institute and 


University in Cincinnati, U.S.A.  But when we called Union’s registrar, a representative told us that Tainwala never 


attained a doctorate, but that he merely enrolled in a program from February 1992 to September 1993.  Union offers 


online degree programs, so it is unclear whether he ever physically attended a class.  A credential check through the 


National Student Clearinghouse, which verifies degrees, confirmed his enrollment dates and that Tainwala never got a 


degree.  Yet there are numerous examples in the media, in Samsonite’s U.S. SEC regulatory filings (prior to Samsonite’s 


privatization), on the website of family owned Tainwala chemicals, in Indian regulatory filings and even in a Samsonite 


earnings call after it went public in Hong Kong, in which Tainwala is introduced or referred to as a “Dr.” or as a 


“PhD.”  In our opinion, this is classic resume fraud, and any legitimate fortune 500 company would remove a CEO 


caught making such material misrepresentations about his educational history.   





4. Red Flags at South Asian JV.  From an auditing standpoint, the entity which is likely most vulnerable to accounting 


manipulation is Samsonite South Asia Private Limited (“Samsonite South Asia”), the Company’s 60/40 joint venture 


with the Tainwala family.  Given that Samsonite South Asia is owned in part by the CEO’s family and engages in a 


number of related party transactions with family owned entities Abhishri and Bagzone, its transactions should be subject 


to a higher degree of oversight by Samsonite’s audit team.  They are not.    





a. Indian Auditor Resignations.  In 2016, KPMG’s Indian affiliate BSR & Co (“BSR”) resigned as auditor of 


Samsonite South Asia, citing an “unwillingness to be re-appointed.”  It was replaced by Spark & Co., a small, 5-


partner firm based in Pune, India.  Spark resigned after only one year and was replaced by another small firm, 


meaning that Samsonite South Asia is on its third auditor in three years.  It is a red flag that such a key subsidiary 


would replace a KPMG affiliate (which would give the Boston-based audit team a trusted partner to scrutinize the 


JV’s accounts) with a succession of tiny firms which do not appear to have the resources or independence to 


properly audit the books of a material subsidiary of a global brand.   





b. Lack of Internal Controls.  Samsonite South Asia’s registered email address in its Indian statutory filings is not 


an @samsonite email account, but a Gmail account Samsonite.secretarial@gmail.com.  Proper internal controls 


require corporate communications to be on a corporate email server and for official business to be conducted only 


on corporate email.  It evinces a weakness in internal controls that Samsonite South Asia is conducting official 


business through a Gmail account.

5. Audit Red Flag: Manual Journal Entries?  Samsonite’s Boston-based auditor identified revenue recognition policies 


across jurisdictions as a key audit matter in both FYs 2016 and 2017.  Notably, KPMG revealed that it reviewed a 


number of “manual journal entries” recording transactions to revenue at year end.  Why is a supposedly sophisticated 


global brand, and an HKD 49 billion global company, manually recording revenue transactions in journals?  Sales first 


recorded manually in a journal are vulnerable to manipulation.  Samsonite is not a neighborhood Chinese restaurant – 


so why is it conducting internal accounting like one?  





6. Web of Related Party Transactions.  Samsonite engages in a number of related party transactions with entities owned 


and controlled by its CEO and his family members. Such transactions are unbecoming of a global, professional 


organization and raise a number of troubling questions about Samsonite’s corporate governance structure and the 


sufficiency of its internal controls.   








a. Disclosed Entity #1 – Abhishri.  Samsonite admits that it sells raw materials to, and buys raw materials and 


finished goods from, Abhishri Packaging Pvt (“Abhishri”), an Indian manufacturer of hard-side luggage products 


owned by the CEO’s family.  In FY 2017, Samsonite disclosed to purchasing $10.5 million from Abhishri, up 


51% from FY 2016.  Publicly available Indian statutory accounts for Abhishri indicate that Samsonite accounted 


for 58% of Abhishri’s sales in 2017.  In addition, Abhishri’s statutory Indian accounts indicate that it buys 


products from Samsonite’s Chinese suppliers.  Why is a global retail brand purchasing finished products from a 


low-value Indian luggage manufacturer owned by the CEO and his family?  Why is Abhishri also purchasing 


from Samsonite’s Asian supply chain? Couldn’t Samsonite simply eliminate the middle man?  How is the 


Company’s Boston-based auditor sufficiently positioned to check the integrity of such transactions? The CEO 


controls both the Company and the supplier, which we believe is a significant red flag creating the risk of 


accounting impropriety. 





b. Disclosed Entity #2 – Bagzone. Samsonite also sells luggage to Bagzone Lifestyle Private Limited (“Bagzone”), 


a Tainwala family owned retailer which sells Samsonite’s products through 85 exclusive and 46 multi-brand 


luggage stores in India.  Samsonite disclosed $11.2 million in sales to Bagzone in FY 2017.  Notably, Samsonite 


also discloses a large receivable balance from Bagzone equal to more than 100% of sales.  Bagzone’s mounting 


receivables balance raises the question of why the related party retailer gets better credit terms than other 


distributors?  It also raises the possibility that Bagzone is hoarding increasing amounts of worthless inventory on 


behalf of the Company.  Channel stuffing through related parties is always a danger when there are not sufficient 


controls, and we think the risk is material in this case.    





c. Undisclosed Related Parties.  We have also found evidence of undisclosed connections to entities controlled 


and owned by the Tainwala family which, according to online corporate record databases such as Informix.In, are

registered using an @samsonite email address.  For example, in 2017, Samsonite’s CEO and his family formed 


Parikrama Logistics and Holdings LLP (“Parikrama”), which according to the Indian Ministry of Commerce, is 


listed as a luggage and travel goods manufacturer.  Records state that Parikrama’s registered contact email is 


sharad.thanvi@samsonite.com, a Samsonite employee.  Yet Samsonite never discloses Parikrama or any 


transactions with the entity.  It is difficult given the limited public information to verify the volume of transactions, 


if any, between Samsonite and such undisclosed related entities, but family-owned businesses registered with an 


@samsonite email address are a governance red flag and create the material risk of impropriety.  We call on 


Samsonite’s board to appoint an independent auditor to investigate these entities.   





VALUATION 





Today Samsonite trades near all-time highs.  On an EV/EBITDA or FCF multiple, Samsonite trades closer to Louis Vuitton 


(LVMH), Prada (1913.HK), and other true luxury brands whose gross margins are 900 bps higher.  Samsonite even trades 


at a premium valuation in line with Burberry (BRBY), a significantly more valuable brand with much lower debt.   





We think comparing Samsonite to Burberry is ridiculous, given the difference in brand notoriety, gross margins and 


frequency of purchase.  Consumers shopping for a Burberry bag are paying a significant premium and are likely to purchase 


at least one item per season to keep up with fashions.  By comparison, consumers purchase luggage much less frequently.  


Ask yourself, when was the last time you bought a suitcase?   





Nor are the brands comparable.  Consumers looking for luxury luggage are not buying Samsonite or Tumi, but luggage 


produced by luxury fashion brands like Prada, Louis Vuitton or Gucci (Kering).  Case in point.  In March 2018, Cristiano 


Ronaldo was named the global brand ambassador for Samsonite’s American Tourister brand.  But Ronaldo posted this photo 


to Instagram in April 2018, traveling with an ultra-fashionable Louis Vuitton suitcase.  Not Tumi, not Samsonite and clearly 


not American Tourister.  Samsonite’s luggage is not luxurious or fashionable enough for even its own celebrity 


spokesperson.   





 
Source: Instagram 





Luxury fashion labels such as LVMH destroy inventory rather than discount it.  Their brands are so valuable they would 


rather set unsold items on fire.  But even a cursory browse online turns up retailers offering Samsonite luggage for 50% off, 


including at Macy’s, Sears, and Kohl’s.

Tumi is Samsonite’s high-end brand.  Yet it is popular not with the jet-set crowd, but over-zealous business school students 


and bleary-eyed McKinsey consultants.  Functional, rather than fashionable.  Samsonite’s name brand is traditionally mid-


level.  It will never be priced as high as Gucci or Ferragamo.  American Tourister is a discount brand sold at Wal-Mart.  





Assembling a proper peer group for Samsonite is difficult because of the absence of other pure play luggage makers.  But 


in terms of gross margins and brand reputation, it is smarter to compare Samsonite to a peer group of mid-tier brands, 


including Tapestry (TPR) (which owns Coach and Kate Spade), PVH.N (which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger), 


Hugo Boss (BOSS.DE), Michael Kors (KORS.K) and Ralph Lauren (RL).  Even this comparison is charitable, as consumers 


are more likely to care about a fashionable item from Ralph Lauren (and purchase such items far more frequently) than a 


suitcase they keep in their closet and replace every eight to ten years.     





But our point is that even if we are charitable, and value the luggage maker on a median EV/EBITDA multiple (11.0x) as 


such mid-tier brands (TPR, BOSS, KORS, RL, PVH), Samsonite’s stock appears grossly overvalued.   





There are signs that the wheels are beginning to come off.  Samsonite reported negative operating cash flows in Q1 2018 


for the first quarter in two years.  Without more acquisitions, we believe that the Company will struggle to hide deteriorating 


cash flows and other material weaknesses in its underlying business.   





For the purposes of our valuation, we value Samsonite as a blended average of four methodologies.  Please see the Valuation 


Section at the end of this Report for our detailed calculations.  A blended average of our four valuation approaches yields 


a share price of HKD 17.59 per share, 48% below Samsonite’s last traded price.   








There are reasons to believe that our valuation is conservative, and that the down side could be even more significant to 


Samsonite’s stock price.  First, we compare Samsonite to fashion brands like Ralph Lauren, Kate Spade and Calvin Klein, 


which is likely charitable.  Second, our valuation does not quantify the growing balance of stale inventory which we believe 


will hamper growth and crush margins.  Third, we apply only a 15% corporate governance discount. 





We believe that Samsonite’s board of directors has no choice but to terminate Ramesh Tainwala for fabricating a doctorate 


credential on his CV.  We also believe it is imperative for the board of directors and particularly the audit committee to 


appoint an independent audit firm to scrutinize all transactions involving Company JV Samsonite South Asia, the Company’s 


treatment of inventory and its purchase price accounting.  This inquiry must also scrutinize the litany of disclosed and 


undisclosed connections between Samsonite South Asia, Abhishri, Bagzone and other entities owned and controlled by the 


Tainwala family.     





Ultimately, we believe that Samsonite is simply carrying too much baggage to trade at such a high premium.

INTRODUCTION: A HISTORY OF MEDIOCRITY  


Samsonite traces its origins as far back as 1910, to a Colorado trunk manufacturer.  Despite longevity, consistent 


success has eluded the luggage maker.  Samsonite was listed on the Nasdaq from 1994 until 2002, when it was delisted 


for failing to meet the exchange’s minimum listing requirements.  In July 2003, a private equity group led by Ares 


recapitalized the Company, reportedly as Samsonite was only weeks from bankruptcy.   


Despite continued unprofitability, the Ares group sold Samsonite to private equity firm CVC for $1.7 billion in 


2007.  CVC pushed for growth by expanding the number of Samsonite retail stores. 


The timing could not have been worse.  Secular headwinds during the financial crisis, lagging retail sales from brick-


and-mortar stores, and $1.34 billion in debt from the privatization weighed on Samsonite until it declared bankruptcy 


in 2009 and went into chapter 11 restructuring.  As part of the 2009 restructuring, Samsonite wrote down $1.5 billion 


in debt and closed 84 American retail locations, 49% of its stores in the U.S.  


In chapter 11, CVC recapitalized Samsonite with an additional $110 million in cash equity investment.  Samsonite’s 


current chairman, Timothy Parker joined as CEO as part of the restructuring.  Two years later, Samsonite went public 


in Hong Kong in a June 2011 IPO.  Even the IPO was disappointing, with Samsonite raising just $1.25 billion despite 


targeting $1.5 billion in capital.  Despite an oversubscribed book, Samsonite’s shares priced at HKD 14.50 per share, 


even though just days prior the Company had targeted an IPO at HKD 17.50 per share.   


Samsonite’s current strategy is to spit in the face of prevailing economic and consumer trends.  Brick-and-mortar retail 


stores are struggling as consumers shift discretionary purchasing online.  In 2017, retailers closed almost 7,000 stores 


in the U.S., beating the previous record for store closures in 2008 during the doldrums of the financial crisis.  More 


than 300 retailers filed for bankruptcy in the first half of last year.  It has become axiomatic that Amazon and e-


commerce platforms represent an existential threat to the survival of retail operations.  Such trends are not limited to 


North America. Chinese shoppers show an even more aggressive preference for online shopping.  Even high-end 


luxury brands have struggled.  Hermes and Louis Vuitton closed 62 stores in China in 2017. 


Yet in spite of what has been called a global “retail apocalypse,” Samsonite has aggressively expanded its retail 


footprint.  Samsonite added 127 net new company operated retail stores in 2017.1  This was merely a continuation of 


Samsonite’s recent push to grow through the addition of retail floor space.  Samsonite added 285 net new stores in 


2016 (202 from the Tumi acquisition), and 162 net new stores in 2015.2  In aggregate, Samsonite added a startling 574 


net new stores in the last three fiscal years.   


To date, Samsonite’s reported financial performance has not reflected these secular headwinds.  Indeed, Samsonite 


trades at a premium valuation in line with luxury brands such as Burberry on an EV/EBITDA basis, a premium we 


believe is entirely unjustified.  We suspect that Samsonite has concealed slowing growth through debt fueled 


acquisitions and that it has massaged earnings and inflated margins through inappropriate purchase price accounting.  


But investors have yet to unpack Samsonite’s baggage.  Until now.

PURCHASE PRICE ACCOUNTING GAMES 


We believe that Samsonite has used purchase price accounting to inflate margins and earnings, masking a core 


business which is likely struggling.  Under accounting rules, an acquiror values a target’s balance sheet assets and 


liabilities at fair market value and allocates the excess of purchase price over net assets to goodwill.  Because this 


process leaves the acquiror’s management team with significant discretion on the marks, it is vulnerable to accounting 


impropriety.   


Companies like Samsonite buying growth through expensive, debt-fueled purchases and playing accounting games 


with the acquisitions are like drug addicts.  Such habits are easy to begin, but very difficult to stop.  The temporary 


boost to financial statements from an acquisition quickly fades, forcing serial acquirers to look for their next score.  


Fresh off of a spat of major acquisitions, Samsonite has made rumblings about its next fix, saying in March 2018 that 


it now desires to acquire a women’s handbag company.  But if history is any guide, the market should be skeptical.  


In some ways Samsonite reminds us of an early-stage Valeant, another company which used aggressive accounting 


and serial acquisitions to mask fundamental weaknesses in its core business.     


1) Tumi: Payables from Thin Air 


In 2016, Samsonite’s core business was flailing.  The Company’s net profits for the first half of FY 2016 were only 


$82.4 million, down 12.7% from the same period in FY 2015.3  The decline in profits was notable because revenue 


was up slightly in the period, signaling an erosion of operating margins.  Like many businesses faced with eroding 


profitability from a slow-growing business, Samsonite turned to debt-financed acquisitions. 


On August 1, 2016, Samsonite completed its acquisition of Tumi Holdings, Inc. (“Tumi”), the luggage and bag maker 


famous for its popularity among khaki-pants wearing McKinsey consultants and over-zealous business school 


students.  The acquisition did not come cheap.  


Samsonite paid $1.8 billion to acquire Tumi, which at the time was a publicly listed company in the United States, 


taking it out at a multiple of 13.6x EV/EBITDA.  To finance the purchase, Samsonite borrowed $2.4 billion in debt 


(a term loan plus a revolver), which after paying down its existing facilities left Samsonite with $1.88 billion in debt 


at the end of FY 2016.   


We believe that Samsonite has engaged in questionable decisions with respect to the purchase price accounting for 


the Tumi acquisition.  IFRS rules give an acquiror discretion to mark up or down a target company’s assets and 


liabilities to reflect their fair market value at the time of the acquisition.  Certain categories allow for more discretion.  


Estimates of intangible assets for example, involve more of a judgment call than the fair value of receivables or 


payables, the values of which are more readily verifiable because of their shorter-term maturities, predictability and 


established billing and credit terms with customers and suppliers.   


In Tumi’s last quarterly report prior to the acquisition, Tumi reported $39 million in accounts payables as of June 26, 


2016.  This figure was largely unchanged from the quarter ending December 2015 ($36 million), indicating that Tumi’s 


cash conversion cycle and payables balances were relatively predictable.

Source: Tumi 10-Q, for quarter ending June 2016 


Yet in Samsonite’s purchase price accounting of the Tumi acquisition, the Company claimed that Tumi had $139 


million of trade and other payables as of August 1, 2016, $100 million more than Tumi reported just one month before.     


 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Results 


Samsonite’s purchase price accounting reported a balance of payables for Tumi ($139 million) that easily exceeded 


Tumi’s pre-acquisition reported payables ($39 million).  Even if Samsonite included Tumi’s accrued expenses as 


“trade and other payables,” it is only an additional $38 million.  Samsonite’s purchase price accounting reported a 


balance of trade and other payables almost as large as the balance of total liabilities ($143 million) reported by Tumi 


in its SEC filings for the quarter ending one month before the acquisition.   


The balance of payables should not be an area of purchase price accounting subject to much discretion.  It is simply 


an aggregate of outstanding bills owed to suppliers, papered by invoices that were most likely sent before or around 


the time of the acquisition.  Tumi stated in its SEC filings that such obligations were “short term maturity,” making 


them easier to estimate.   


To put this in context, in the previous 10 quarters, Tumi had never reported a balance of accounts payable higher 


than $48 million.  If we include accrued expenses and income taxes payable, Tumi had never reported a balance of 


total payables and accrued expenses higher than $78.5 million over the previous ten quarters.

Source: Tumi Quarterly Financials 


But on the acquisition date (August 1, 2016), Samsonite reported that Tumi’s trade and other payables were $138.7 


million.  This was $61.6 million more than Tumi reported in payables and accrued expenses just a month prior, and 


$67.2 million more than Tumi’s average balance of payables and accruals in the previous ten quarters.      


In our view, it appears that Samsonite simply conjured the additional payables out of thin air.  We believe that this is 


a significant red flag and evidence of accounting impropriety.   


The potential benefit to Samsonite is obvious.  By overstating Tumi’s balance of payables at acquisition, Samsonite 


can avoid having to run at least $61.6 million in subsequent expenses through its income statement, thereby artificially 


inflating margins. This amount is certainly a material amount to Samsonite.   


We calculate that the Company’s EBITDA would be 12% lower and its earnings would be 24% lower than reported 


if Samsonite had to recognize an additional $61.6 million in expenses on its income statement in H2 FY 2016 and H1 


FY 2017.  By inflating the balance of acquired payables at Tumi, we believe that Samsonite was able to materially 


inflate its margins during those periods.

It is no wonder Samsonite’s Massachusetts based auditing team at KPMG identified purchase accounting for the Tumi 


acquisition as a “key audit matter” in FY 2016.

Payables are not an area subject to much discretion, especially considering that Tumi’s payables were relatively 


predictable based on its historical financial statements.  In our opinion, Samsonite’s purchase price accounting decision 


to inflate Tumi’s payables by $61.6 million smacks of accounting games to artificially inflate earnings by avoiding 


the recognition of expenses.  But this is far from the only acquisition-related red flag. 


2) Tumi’s Asian Distributors: Under-Reported Inventory Balance 


In 2017, Samsonite acquired Tumi’s distribution network in South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, China, Indonesia and 


Thailand, for a total consideration of $64.9 million.  Notably, Samsonite’s purchase price accounting reported that the 


value of the inventory acquired in the transaction was only $9.4 million.  


 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Report 


From a strategic standpoint, the decision is curious.  Acquiring a distribution network with a host of brick-and-mortar 


locations is spitting into the winds of a global (and Asian) retail apocalypse.  Perhaps predictably, such distributors 


made a net loss of $0.2 million in FY 2017 (post-acquisition).   


Much like the Tumi acquisition, the purchase price accounting for Tumi’s Asian distributors raises a number of red  


flags.  Given that Samsonite acquired a network of distributors and physical stores, it is conceivable that Tumi’s gross 


margins would increase.  Indeed, the Company reported that Tumi’s gross margins increased by 400bp year-over-year 


in FY 2017.   


But it is costly to run brick and mortar stores, so analysts would expect operating and EBITDA margins to come down 


as Tumi increases its operating footprint.  Yet this was not the case.  Samsonite’s blended operating margins for all 


brands in its Asian segment barely changed between FY 2016 and FY 2017.  Tumi’s reported adjusted EBITDA 


margins even increased year over year by 80bp to 21% in FY 2017.4 


 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Results; Samsonite 2017 Result Presentation 


There should have been negative pressure on Tumi’s operating and EBITDA margins given that at the time of 


acquisition, purchase price accounting conventions require Samsonite to mark the acquired inventory at its fair value.  


But this convention is vulnerable to accounting slights of hand: if Samsonite recorded the acquired inventory at below 


market value, then after acquiring the distributors it could later sell the inventory for a price above its mark and

maintain (or even grow) its reported margins.  That would explain why Tumi’s reported EBITDA margins did not 


decrease when simple logic suggests there would be compression.    


There is evidence to confirm this thesis.  Samsonite’s CEO admitted on Samsonite’s Q3 2017 earnings call that the 


Company was acquiring inventory it previously sold to Tumi’s Asian distributors at the same price at which it sold 


such inventory to them.  Samsonite’s CEO further revealed that the acquired Tumi distributors were carrying about 5 


to 6 months of inventory at the time of acquisition.   





Source: Q3, 2017, Samsonite Conference Call 


The numbers do not add up.  Acquired distributors should be carrying inventory at the same price which, pre-


acquisition, such distributors purchased the inventory from Samsonite.  If the acquired Asian Tumi distributors were 


carrying 6 months of inventory at the time of the transaction, then by simple logic that balance would represent six 


months of prior sales from Tumi to its acquired Asian distributors.   


Samsonite disclosed that in the first half of 2016, Tumi’s net sales in Asia were $62 million.

Samsonite reported that Tumi’s total sales in Asia were $133 million in FY 2016, meaning that sales in the second 


half of that year were $71 million.5  Other than a few stores in Japan, we also know from Tumi’s prior SEC filings 


that almost all of its sales in Asia were as a wholesaler to third-party distributors.6   


Per Samsonite’s disclosures, Japan and India accounted for 14.5% and 11.6%, respectively, of its Asian sales in FY 


2017.  We believe that this blended geographical breakdown of sales in Asia is representative across Samsonite’s 


brands, including Tumi.   


 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Report 


Samsonite acquired Tumi’s distribution network in China (23.2% of sales), South Korea (17.7% of sales) and Hong 


Kong (12.2% of sales).  Samsonite also disclosed that the acquired Tumi distributor in Hong Kong included sales to 


distributors in other parts of the Asian region (Australia 6% and other 9.8%).  We can therefore calculate that the 


acquired Tumi distributors should account for 69% of Tumi’s Asian sales.

If Tumi’s sales in Asia (before Samsonite acquired the Tumi distributors) were $70.8 million in 2H 2016, then 


excluding online sales (4.7%), sales in Japan (14.5%), Thailand (2.7%), Indonesia (2.5%) and presumably sales in 


India (11.6%), six months of inventory for the acquired Tumi distributors should have been at least $46.4 million.  


Yet Samsonite’s purchase price accounting for the acquired distributors valued 5-6 months of their inventory at only 


$9.4 million, which we calculate is 80% less than the amount of Tumi’s sales to such distributors in the previous 


6 months.  


  
Source: Samsonite Public Filings, Blue Orca Calculation 


We believe that Samsonite played purchase price accounting games by marking the acquired inventory below both its 


fair value and the price at which Samsonite sold such inventory to its distributors.  Then, post-acquisition, Samsonite 


was able to sell the acquired inventory, thereby inflating EBITDA and operating profits by at least $37 million.7   


In further support of our suspicion, Samsonite claimed that of $64.9 million in total consideration, $52 million or 80% 


of the value of the acquired distributors was either goodwill or nebulous “customer relationships.”

disclosures, that the acquired distributors held 6 months of inventory on their balance sheets at the time of the acquisitions.  If we 


subtract sales to non-acquired distributors (ex Japan, Thailand, India and Indonesia) and online sales, we estimate that Samsonite 


sales to acquired distributors was $46.4 million in 2H FY 2016.  Given that Samsonite marked the acquired inventory at only $9.4 


million, we estimate that the understatement (i.e., market value of acquired inventory minus recognized amount) was at least $37 


million.

What customer relationships were so valuable for distributors selling luggage through retail outlets? It is our suspicion 


that Samsonite inflated the value of nebulous customer contracts to offset the inappropriate markdown in inventory.  


That would explain why Samsonite’s margins in Asia did not compress despite an enlarged operating burden.   


There is also evidence to support this suspicion from previous Samsonite acquisitions, albeit at smaller dollars.  In 


February 2015, Samsonite’s UK subsidiary Samsonite Limited acquired UK based luggage retailer Rolling Luggage 


for £11 million.  Companies House records from Samsonite Limited show that the Company marked down the value 


of acquired inventory by 49% upon acquisition. 


 
Source: U.K. Companies House Filings, Samsonite Limited, FY 2016 


When it acquired Rolling Luggage, Samsonite slashed the value of the target’s inventory by 49% below carrying 


value.  As a result of its purchase price accounting, Samsonite reported that Rolling Luggage had negative book value 


at the time of acquisition and thereby allocated more than 100% of the purchase price to goodwill.   


Without the financials of Tumi’s acquired Asian distributors, it is impossible to know for sure if Samsonite slashed 


the value of acquired inventory in its purchase price accounting as it did with Rolling Luggage.  But that would explain 


how Samsonite acquired a network of distributors and brick-and-mortar retailers yet did not report a decline in Tumi’s 


EBITDA margins in FY 2017.  


We calculate, based on Samsonite’s disclosures, that the acquired Asian distributors accounted for $46.4 million in 


Tumi sales in 2H 2016 (ex. Online, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia and India), and we know from Samsonite’s CEO that 


the distributors held 5-6 months of inventory at the time of acquisition.  We estimate therefore, based on the $9.4 


million in disclosed inventory at the distributors in Samsonite’s questionable purchase price accounting, that 


Samsonite inappropriately marked down the value of acquired inventory by approximately 80%. 


Samsonite’s margins are slim, so the benefit to marking acquired inventory below its market value would be 


significant.  An extra $37 million would flow straight to Samsonite’s bottom line and mask a struggling underlying 


business.8     


                                                           
8 Calculation is as follows.  We estimate that the value of six months of acquired inventory at the Tumi Asian distributors was 


$46.4 million; minus $9.4 million in disclosed value of acquired inventory, yields $37 million in inappropriately recognized profits.

In this report, we have presented evidence of what we believe to purchase price accounting games in connection with 


both the Tumi acquisition and the rollup of Tumi’s Asian distributors.  We estimate that inappropriately increasing 


Tumi’s balance of payables, and inappropriately marking down the value of the distributors’ inventory, allowed 


Samsonite to inflate reported profits by an aggregate of $99 million.   





 
Source: Blue Orca Calculation 


We believe that with proper purchase price accounting, Samsonite would have reported 12% less EBITDA and 19% 


less in earnings over 18 months ending H2 2017.  This amount is clearly material, as it would exceed the Company’s 


reported EBITDA growth in FY 2017.  As discussed in our valuation, Samsonite trades at a premium valuation in line 


with luxury brands because of its perceived growth.  But we think such growth is largely illusory, and is more likely 


due to inappropriate purchase price accounting rather than a solid underlying business.

ZERO-MARGIN INVENTORY FORESHADOWS FALLING PROFITABILITY 


Despite reporting seemingly impressive margins, Samsonite’s balance sheet shows a growing balance of zero-margin 


inventory.  Not only is this mounting balance a red flag which undermines confidence in the Company’s reported 


profitability, but the buildup of effectively stale inventory foreshadows a future margin crash.    


Pursuant to IFRS guidelines, Samsonite carries its inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). 


 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Report 


Samsonite defines NRV as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less than the estimated costs 


of completion and selling expenses.  Inventory which Samsonite expects to sell at a profit is carried at cost.  By 


contrast, any inventory carried at NRV on its balance sheet is by definition carried at a mark below cost, meaning 


that Samsonite does not expect to sell such inventory at a positive gross margin.   


Alarmingly, the percentage of Samsonite’s inventory carried at a mark below cost (i.e., at NRV) has risen dramatically 


in the last two fiscal years (FYs 2016 and 2017).   


 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Report 


In FY 2017, Samsonite reported that $229.6 million of its inventory was carried at NRV, on a year-end balance of 


only $542 million in finished goods.  In other words, Samsonite did not expect to make a profit on 42% of its 


inventory of finished goods!

Samsonite’s financials show a significant increase in the percentage of inventory carried at NRV in the last two years 


(42% in FY 2017 and 46% in FY 2016), well above historic averages.  Despite the large percentage of inventory at 


NRV, the write-downs associated with such inventory were only $6 million and $6.2 million in FYs 2017 and 2016 


respectively.   


If Samsonite did not expect to sell almost half (46%) of its stock of finished inventory for a profit, how did the 


Company maintain margins in FY 2017?  


 
Source: Samsonite Public Filings 


The cash conversion data also suggests that margins should have suffered.  Samsonite’s average reported day sales in 


inventory (DSI) was just over 120 days in FY 2017.  If the Company is turning over its inventory every four months, 


and 46% of its inventory was marked below cost at the beginning of FY 2017, how did it churn through the stale 


inventory without profit margins declining?   


 
Source: Samsonite Public Filings 


As the Company acquires distributors, it makes sense for DSIs to increase, but Samsonite still reportedly turns over 


its inventory roughly three times per year.  The NRV-inventory balance raises the question of how the Company sold 


a little less than half of its inventory balance at zero gross margin without overall margins suffering?  


It could be that rather than selling such NRV-carried inventory, Samsonite is merely hoarding it in a warehouse 


somewhere.  In 2017, as part of disclosures around the Company’s continuing connected transactions with the CEO’s 


family company, Tainwala Holdings, Samsonite reported an increase in related party transaction volumes due to its 


“increasing inventory storage requirements.”

Although the dollar volume under the contract is small, given the increasing balance of NRV-level inventory, it is still 


a red flag that the Company is turning to related parties controlled by the CEO for its increasing inventory storage 


needs. 


If Samsonite is hoarding increasing amounts of stale inventory, it would explain why margins are apparently immune 


in the short term to a growing balance of stock marked below cost.  But this cannot continue indefinitely.  Eventually, 


such inventory balances must either be written off or sold at zero margin – at which point the Company’s margins will 


come crashing down.  


A growing balance of NRV inventory may also explain the heavy discounting of stock that we see in online advertising 


for Samsonite luggage.   








Source: https://moat.com/advertiser/samsonite?report_type=display  


A cursory browse online turns up other retailers offering Samsonite luggage for 50% off, including at Macy’s, Sears, 


and Kohl’s.  Even Samsonite’s own websites, including fast growing-brand American Tourister, is offering significant 


discounts off of customer favorites and new luggage.  Marking down inventory 50-70% does not leave much room 


for Samsonite to achieve its reported 56% gross margins.

CEO RESUME FRAUD 


Any investor who dismisses evidence of questionable purchase price or inventory accounting or other red flags by 


relying on the credibility of Samsonite’s leadership is likely to be sorely disappointed.  In our opinion, we have 


identified a classic case of credential fraud which we believe should lead Samsonite’s board of directors to remove its 


CEO, Ramesh Tainwala.   





Although his bio on Samsonite’s website omits the reference, evidence suggests that Tainwala has held himself out as 


doctor, a credential we believe he has falsified.   





Tainwala claims that he holds a master’s degree in Management Studies from the Birla Institute of Technology and 


Science in Pilani, India (1982).  But a master’s degree is no doctorate, and would not confer on him the right to refer 


to himself as a doctor.   





Rather, Tainwala appears to have held himself out as a doctor based on a claimed doctorate degree in Business 


Administration from the Union Institute & University in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Indeed, his bio on Bloomberg lists this 


credential even though his official Samsonite bio does not.  





 
Source: Bloomberg Screenshot 





The Wall St. Journal’s online database also refers to him as a doctor and references his supposed doctorate from 


Union.  Indeed, we have found numerous articles in the media, including executive profiles which quote Tainwala and 


refer to him as a doctor. For example, a March 2017 profile in the magazine Marwar India, quotes Tainwala, and refers 


to him as a doctor.   





 
Source: http://www.marwar.com/cover-story/family-and-fortune.html 





Tainwala’s doctor credential also appears in formal settings.  A publicly available securities filing in connection with 


the sale of family business Tainwala Polycontainers Limited to Bombay-listed Time Technoplast from 2006 states 


that “Dr. Ramesh Tainwala” received a “Doctorate in Business Administration from the Union Institute 


Cincinnati,” in the United States.

There is also evidence that Tainwala used the doctor credential in his time at Samsonite.  In Samsonite’s SEC filings, 


made prior to its privatization, including a 2007 S-1 and 10-K, the Company refers to him as a “Dr. Ramesh Tainwala.”  


So does the Company’s 2006 10-K.   





In Samsonite’s S-1 2011 earnings call, its first call as a public company in Hong Kong, the Company introduces 


Tainwala as a doctor.  





 
Source: Bloomberg Earnings Call Transcript 





In a February 2010 slide presentation celebrating Samsonite’s 100-year anniversary, Tainwala’s profile as President 


Greater Asia refers to him as a “Dr.” and states that he had a PhD in business economics.

Yet when we called Union Institute and University in Cincinnati, the registrar’s office told us that Tainwala only 


enrolled from February 1992 to September 1993 and that he never obtained any degree.   Union offers online 


degree programs, so it is unclear whether he ever attended a single class in Cincinnati or enrolled remotely from India.   





In the United States, anyone seeking to verify an individual’s educational credentials can submit a request through the 


National Student Clearinghouse (“NSC”).  After speaking with the registrar at Union, we submitted a request through 


the NSC to confirm the registrar’s information.  The NSC, which any investor or journalist can use to submit a similar 


request, confirmed that Tainwala never obtained a degree from Union and only attended from 1992 through September 


1993.

In our opinion, this is classic credential fraud.  We have found numerous articles in the media referring to Tainwala 


as doctor, suggesting that he has represented himself as a doctorate in his capacity at Samsonite.  For example, a 2012 


interview refers to him as a doctor and president of Samsonite’s Asia Pacific and Middle East.  An online record of a 


2016 decision by Indian tax authorities likewise refers to him as “Dr. Tainwala.”   





This misrepresentation is not limited to informal settings.  Not only did Samsonite’s SEC regulatory filings and Hong 


Kong earnings call refer to him as a doctor, so does the annual report of Indian public company Basant Agro Tech for 


which he served as an independent director.    





 
Source: Basant Agro Tech Annual Report, 2011-2012 





Even today, the website for his own company Tainwala Chemicals refers to him as “Dr. Ramesh Tainwala.” 


 
Source: http://www.tainwala.in/about_us.html 





We think that Samsonite is somewhat aware of the problem, because the CEO’s official bio on the Samsonite website 


and the Company’s annual reports omit any mention of a supposed doctorate or Union Institute and University.  Yet 


prior Samsonite SEC filings and a Hong Kong earnings call introduced him as Dr. Tainwala, indicating that at some 


point the Company changed its mind on Tainwala’s credentials and how to refer to him.

The abundance of references in the public forum, in media and more official filings, suggests that Tainwala has held 


himself out as a doctor despite not obtaining such a degree.  In our view, this is classic resume fraud, and any legitimate 


fortune 500 company would remove a CEO caught making such representations.  





Yahoo removed CEO Scott Thompson for claiming on his resume that he had a dual major in computer science when 


he only majored in accounting.  Thompson blamed the search firm which had submitted the resume with a false 


credential to Paypal (where he previously worked), but that excuse did not save him.  Nor did it save former Radio 


Shack CEO David Edmondson who resigned when it was discovered he made up psychology and theology degrees.  


Corporate boardrooms are littered with the carcasses of executives who have told far more minor lies on their resumes. 





Investors are particularly reliant on the creditability of management given the number of related party transactions 


between the Company and its CEO (and his family), and the considerable discretion of Samsonite’s management over 


critical areas such as purchase price accounting.  In our view, evidence of credential fraud is emblematic of a loose 


relationship with the truth, and Samsonite’s board has no choice but to remove him.

RED FLAGS AT SOUTH ASIAN JV 





From an auditing standpoint, the entity which is likely most vulnerable to accounting impropriety is Samsonite South 


Asia Private Limited (“Samsonite South Asia”), the Company’s 60/40 joint venture with the Tainwala family.  Given 


that Samsonite South Asia is owned in part by the CEO’s family and engages in a number of related party transactions 


with family owned entities Abhishri and Bagzone, its transactions should be subject to a higher degree of oversight 


by Samsonite’s audit team. 


But incredibly, Samsonite South Asia is not audited by a local KPMG affiliate.  Rather, it has been audited by a 


succession of tiny Indian firms, which (if recent past is any guide) resign after one year.  There is also evidence of a 


lack of proper internal controls at Samsonite South Asia.   


1) Indian Auditor Resignations 


In FY 2015, Samsonite South Asia was audited by Indian KPMG affiliate BSR & Co.  But Indian regulatory filings 


show that BSR then resigned and “expressed their unwillingness to be re-appointed” as statutory auditors.  


 
Source: Indian FY 2015 Statutory Filings of Samsonite South Asia Private Limited 


Why would a local KPMG affiliate be unwilling to audit Samsonite South Asia’s financials when the Boston-based 


global audit team remained the Company’s auditor of its consolidated Hong Kong financials?  


Not only is it a red flag that KPMG-affiliate BSR resigned, but also that it was replaced in FY 2016, by Spark & Co., 


a small, 5-partner firm based in Pune, India.  Until a recent facelift, Spark’s website included the hilarious stock photo 


of a goofy white guy.  Nothing about its website or its operation indicate that Spark has the independence or 


qualifications to be auditing the material subsidiary of a billion-dollar global brand.

This same stock photo is used to sell watches and high-speed internet, hardly a credible look for an auditor.

Curiously, Spark resigned after one year, also citing an “unwillingness to be re-appointed.”  An odd choice for a tiny 


firm like Spark to reject a big account for a global brand.

Samsonite South Asia’s auditor resigned in FY 2015 and FY 2016.  For FY 2017, it appointed Kangude & Waghmode 


Chartered Accountants, which does not even have a website that we could find.  How can such a small, local 


accountant have the resources, expertise and independence to audit a key subsidiary of a billion-dollar brand?  


KPMG’s primary audit team is located in Boston, Massachusetts, and likely requires a local Indian partner it can trust 


to audit a subsidiary which is partly owned by, and transacts with, the Tainwala family.  Indeed, KPMG affiliates audit 


Samsonite’s other subsidiaries in the U.K., Australia and the Netherlands.   


India is the jurisdiction in which investors want the Company’s auditor to be most vigilant in policing transactions 


between its CEO, his family and Samsonite. Yet the local KPMG affiliate resigned, and now Samsonite South Asia is 


on its third auditor in its last three years.  Moreover, Samsonite South Asia has appointed two tiny audit firms that do 


not appear, in our opinion, to be in the league required to audit the material subsidiary of a global brand.  These audit 


red flags suggest Samsonite should trade at a corporate governance discount, not a premium to other global brands.  


2) Lack of Internal Controls 


There is also evidence of a lack of internal controls at Samsonite South Asia.  In its Indian regulatory filings, Samsonite 


South Asia’s registered email address is not an @samsonite email account, but a Gmail account listed as 


Samsonite.secretarial@gmail.com.

This email account also appears as Samsonite South Asia’s registered email address in online corporate databases.  


We believe that it is a significant red flag that such a vulnerable entity would conduct business through a generic 


Gmail account and not through an official @samsonite email account.   


Proper internal controls require corporate communications to be on a corporate email server and for official business 


to be conducted only on corporate email.  It allows Company auditors and record keepers to maintain proper records. 


We consider it suspicious that such a vulnerable entity like Samsonite South Asia would not use an official 


@samsonite email address for record keeping, which, in our opinion, evinces a material weakness in internal controls.

AUDIT RED FLAGS: MANUAL JOURNAL ENTRIES? 


Samsonite’s audit profile also raises a number of red flags and corporate governance concerns.  Samsonite is audited 


by a KPMG team led by an engagement partner based in Boston, Massachusetts.9 Although it is difficult to pin down, 


we believe that CEO Ramesh Tainwala works from a combination of India, Dubai and Hong Kong.  The CFO and 


General Counsel work out of Samsonite’s Massachusetts headquarters.   


In its FY 2017 annual report, Samsonite’s chairman (Timothy Parker) admits that the Company currently needs greater 


central oversight.  We question whether Samsonite’s self-admitted “decentralized management” is appropriate given 


the number of material transactions in which the Company engages with its CEO and his family-owned related party 


suppliers and customers.   





 
Source: Samsonite 2017 Annual Report 


How can a Boston-based auditing team effectively scrutinize a decentralized structure in which the supply chain 


includes material transactions with Chinese manufacturers and an Indian related party owned by the CEO’s family?  


In our Report, we have identified a number of accounting red flags surrounding Samsonite’s inventory, including the 


increasing balance of inventory carried at NRV which, although it must be sold below cost, does not seem to impact 


Samsonite’s reported margins.  Samsonite’s treatment of inventory is also a key component of our analysis of purchase 


price accounting with respect to Tumi’s Asian distributors.  


It is therefore notable that KPMG has identified Samsonite’s revenue recognition as a key audit matter in each of the 


last two years.  Specifically, KPMG has flagged and tested transactions at year end based on the “inherent risk around 


consistent application of … revenue recognition policies” in the various jurisdictions in which Samsonite operates.  





 
Source: Samsonite 2016 Annual Report; Samsonite 2017 Annual Results 


In order to address the key audit matter of revenue recognition, KPMG disclosed a number of procedures it 


implemented to check the Company’s books and records.  Notably, KPMG disclosed reviewing “manual journal 


entries” of transactions recorded to revenue during the last month of the last two fiscal years.

Why is a global retailer recording revenue from a manual journal entry?  We would expect, given the level of supposed 


sophistication and professionalism of an HKD 49 billion market capitalization company, that revenue transactions 


would not be jotted down with pen or pencil at year end.     


What transactions are papered using a journal? We can assume that the transactions are material, otherwise they would 


not have been reviewed as part of a key audit matter.  Do such journal entries relate to sales or transactions to Tainwala 


owned related parties?  


Samsonite is not a neighborhood Chinese restaurant – so why is it conducting internal accounting like one? Not only 


is this a corporate governance concern, but an auditing red flag unbecoming of a supposedly professional global brand.

WEB OF DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTIES 


Samsonite continues to engage in a number of related party transactions with entities owned and controlled by its CEO 


and wanna-be doctor, Ramesh Tainwala and his family members.  Such transactions are unbecoming of a global, 


professional organization and raise a number of troubling questions about Samsonite’s corporate governance structure 


and the sufficiency of its internal controls.   


Furthermore, we have conducted independent due diligence on publicly available records in India and have discovered 


a number of non-disclosed entities owned and controlled by the Tainwala family for which online corporate 


registration records reveal an “@samsonite” email address.    We call on Samsonite’s board of directors to appoint an 


independent auditor or law firm to scrutinize the propriety of these connections.   


1) Disclosed Related Party Transactions 


Ramesh Tainwala’s rise through the ranks of Samsonite is interwoven with the Company’s increasing involvement 


with his family enterprises in India.  In 1995, Samsonite entered into a JV with Ramesh Tainwala and companies 


controlled by him and his family (the “Tainwala Group”).  Samsonite continues to own and operate the JV, Samsonite 


South Asia, with the Tainwala group today.  In 2006, the Company entered into another 60/40 JV in the middle east 


through the joint venture Samsonite Middle East FZCO, incorporated in the United Arab Emirates (“Samsonite Middle 


East”).   


In addition to their ownership interest in Samsonite South Asian and Middle Eastern subsidiaries, Tainwala family 


companies manufacture luggage for Samsonite and sell Samsonite products through a chain of family owned retail 


stores in India.

Why is a global retail brand purchasing finished products from a low-value add Indian luggage manufacturer owned 


by the CEO and his family?  How is the Company’s Boston-based auditor sufficiently positioned to check the integrity 


of such transactions? The CEO controls both the Company and the supplier, which we believe is a significant red flag 


creating the opportunity for accounting impropriety.  


In addition, Abhishri’s statutory Indian accounts state that it has unhedged foreign currency obligations to Chinese 


firms which also supply to Samsonite.  These balances imply that Abhishri is also buying products from Samsonite’s 


Chinese suppliers.  For example, Abhishri’s statutory filings imply that it purchases from JingYu Lock Hong Kong 


Co. Ltd. and Xian Kombo Import and Export Co. Ltd.

We also found records that other companies with whom Abhishri does business also supply Samsonite, including 


Yurongxing Metal Zipper (Shenzhen) Co Ltd and Wujiang Yiwei Textile Co Ltd.   


If Abhishri is buying from Samsonite’s Chinese suppliers only to sell luggage to Samsonite, what is its value in the 


supply chain? Such ties indicate that Abhishri is merely a middle-man between Samsonite and its Chinese suppliers, 


which raises the question as to why the Company would do business with Abhishri in the first place?  


Abhishri’s financial profile, evident from publicly available Indian statutory filings, also suggests the supplier is 


struggling with meager margins and increasing debts.  


  
Source: Indian Statutory Filings; FYE March 


Given the lack of audit oversight over transactions between the Company, its 60/40 JV Samsonite South Asia, and 


Abhishri, we think it is a significant red flag that the CEO’s family owned entity is also a middle man between 


Samsonite and its Chinese suppliers.   


Why doesn’t Samsonite just transact directly with its Chinese suppliers and eliminate Abhishri from the supply chain? 


What is the purpose of such related party transactions?  Such related party transactions suggest Samsonite should trade 


at a corporate governance discount, not a premium valuation on par with Burberry.  


b. Bagzone 


Samsonite also sells luggage to Bagzone Lifestyle Private Limited (“Bagzone”).  In 2009, Samsonite entered into a 


deal with Bagzone, which is controlled by the Tainwala Group, to be the preferred dealer of Samsonite and American 


Tourister products in India.  As of FY 2017, Bagzone operated 85 exclusive Samsonite retail outlets and 46 multi-


brand outlets in India.

Samsonite disclosed $11.2 million in sales to Bagzone in FY 2017.  Notably, Samsonite also discloses a large 


receivable balance from Bagzone equal to more than 100% of annual sales.  Although Samsonite is recognizing sales 


to the family-controlled entity, the receivables balance suggest Bagzone is struggling to pay the Company for the 


luggage it buys.

Source: Samsonite Public Filings 


As of FY 2017, Bagzone’s receivables balance owed to the Company exceeded 100% of Samsonite’s sales to the 


related party. 


Bagzone’s mounting receivables balance raises the question of why the related party retailer gets better credit terms 


than other distributors.  It also raises the possibility that Bagzone is hoarding increasing amounts of worthless 


inventory on behalf of the Company.   


Channel stuffing through related parties is always a danger when there are not sufficient controls, and we think such 


a risk is material in this case.   Indian statutory filings indicate that Bagzone purchased $18.1 million in stock in trade 


in 2017 (FY ending March), of which $11.2 million came from Samsonite.  Although Bagzone appears to purchase 


62% of its inventory from Samsonite, it has failed to consistently generate a profit.

Note: Bagzone’s statutory filings report sales for FY ending March, so our calculation of 


the percentage of sales to Samsonite is an estimate based on matching Samsonite’s 


disclosures for FY ending December with Bagzone’s filings for the year ending March. 


Like its relationship with other Tainwala controlled entities, Samsonite’s dealings with Bagzone are suspicious and 


unbecoming of a global retailer.  The relationship presents a myriad of corporate governance risks, including channel 


stuffing of low or zero margin inventory, which can essentially sit with a CEO-controlled Indian distributor.  The 


appeal of Bagzone to the Tainwala family is also confusing: the Indian distributor lost money in two of the last three 


fiscal years. 


Samsonite might try and retort that transactions with Bagzone are not material, as they account for $11 million of the 


Company’s consolidated FY 2017 revenues of $3.5 billion.  But investors will recall that Valeant made a similar 


excuse with respect to Philidor.  When short sellers alerted the market that Valeant secretly controlled an obscure 


distributor, Valeant dismissed the allegations on account that sales to Philidor were immaterial and about 5% of 


company revenues.  Yet the dollar volumes of transactions with Philidor did not have to be large in order to artificially 


inflate Valeant’s earnings. 


There is a similar risk with the related party transactions between Samsonite and the private entities controlled by its 


CEO and his family.  Measured as a percentage of revenues, such transactions appear small.  But Samsonite’s profit 


margins are thin, so even small dollars are material to the Company’s reported growth and profitability.   


Samsonite is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  If transactions with Abhishri and Bagzone are supposedly 


immaterial to the Company’s financial position, then there seems little reason to justify the corporate governance stink 


of a supposedly global retailer continuing to buy luggage from, and sell luggage through, entities controlled by the 


CEO and his family.  Put simply, if such transactions are immaterial, why doesn’t Samsonite get rid of them?   


But if Samsonite continues such dealings, despite their malodorous appearance, then shareholders are in their rights 


to question such transactions.  To start, how can Samsonite’s auditor, whose principal engagement partner sits in 


Boston, Massachusetts, have any hope of verifying the transactions between Tainwala Group entities which sell 


luggage to and buy luggage from the Company’s Indian subsidiary – which is itself 40% owned by the Tainwala 


Group?   


We question whether an auditor sitting in India could adequately police such transactions.  We think it is hopeless for 


an auditor in Boston to safeguard shareholder’s rights on dealings between Indian entities under the thumb of its CEO.  


2) Undisclosed Related Party Connections 


We have also found evidence of undisclosed related party entities controlled and owned by the CEO and/or his family 


which, according to online corporate record databases, are registered using an @samsonite email address.  Some of 


these entities also appear to operate in the luggage space.  It is difficult given the limited public information to verify 


the volume of transactions, if any, between Samsonite and such undisclosed related party entities, but such entities are 


significant governance red flags and create the material risk of impropriety.  We call on Samsonite’s board to appoint 


an independent audit firm to investigate these entities and their connection to the Company.

The online corporate database, Informix.In, states that it is pulling information from “official company registers and 


other public data sources.”  We question why such privately held entities are using @samsonite email addresses if 


they are not affiliated with or transacting with the Company.  Another possibility is that Company resources are being 


inappropriately used by the CEO and his family to handle private business concerns.   


That said, we must caveat that in the case of every entity listed above except Parikrama, registration emails found in 


Indian statutory filings list Tainwala.secretarial@gmail.com, not an @samsonite email address.   We are unsure why 


there would be a discrepancy, but the presence of an @samsonite email address in online record databases suggest 


that perhaps Company employees may be involved in the record filing process. 


Rather than trade at a premium valuation in line with peers like Burberry, webs of connections with related party 


entities (some disclosed, others not) suggest Samsonite should trade, in our opinion, at a corporate governance 


discount.

VALUATION 


Today, despite purchase price accounting games, a growing balance of inventory carried at NRV, a number of 


governance and audit red flags, and a host of highly dubious related party connections (disclosed and undisclosed) 


between the Company and its CEO, Samsonite trades near all-time highs.

On an EV to EBITDA basis, Samsonite trades at a premium valuation in line with Burberry (BRBY), a significantly 


more valuable brand with much lower debt.

We think comparing Samsonite to Burberry is ridiculous, given the difference in brand notoriety, gross margins and 


frequency of purchase.  Consumers shopping for a Burberry or Louis Vuitton bag are paying a significant premium

and are likely to purchase at least one item per season to keep up with fashions.  By comparison, consumers purchase 


luggage much less frequently.  Ask yourself, when was the last time you bought a suitcase?   





Nor are the brands comparable.  Consumers looking for luxury luggage are not buying Samsonite or Tumi, but luggage 


produced by luxury fashion brands like Prada, Louis Vuitton or Gucci (Kering).  Case in point.  In March 2018, 


Cristiano Ronaldo was named the global brand ambassador for Samsonite’s American Tourister brand.  But Ronaldo 


posted this photo in April 2018, traveling with an ultra-fashionable Louis Vuitton suitcase.  Not Tumi, not Samsonite 


and clearly not American Tourister.  Even celebrities paid to promote Samsonite’s brands prefer higher end luggage.    





 
Source: Instagram 





Luxury fashion labels such as LVMH destroy inventory rather than discount it.  Their brands are so valuable they 


would rather set unsold items on fire.  But even a cursory browse online turns up retailers offering Samsonite luggage 


for 30-50% off, including at Macy’s, Sears and Kohl’s and Samsonite’s own website.   





Tumi is Samsonite’s high-end brand.  Yet it is popular not with the jet-set crowd, but over-zealous business school 


students and bleary-eyed McKinsey consultants.  Functional, rather than fashionable.  Samsonite’s name brand is 


traditionally mid-level.  American Tourister is a discount brand sold at Wal-Mart.  





Assembling a proper peer group for Samsonite is difficult because of the absence of other pure play luggage makers.  


But in terms of gross margins and brand reputation, it is smarter to compare Samsonite to a peer group of mid-tier 


brands, including Tapestry (TPR) (which owns Coach and Kate Spade), PVH.N (which owns Calvin Klein and 


Tommy Hilfiger), Hugo Boss (BOSS.DE), Michael Kors (KORS.K) and Ralph Lauren (RL).  Even this comparison 


is charitable, as consumers are more likely to care about a fashionable item from Ralph Lauren (and purchase such 


items far more frequently) than a suitcase they keep in their closet and replace every eight to ten years.     





But our point is that even if we are charitable, and value the luggage maker on a median EV/EBITDA multiple (11.0x) 


as such mid-tier brands (TPR, BOSS, KORS, RL, PVH), Samsonite’s stock appears grossly overvalued.

For the purposes of our valuation, we value Samsonite as a blended average of four methodologies.  First, using 


historical figures, we believe it is appropriate to adjust Samsonite’s reported EBITDA for the year ending Q1 2018 to 


deduct dubious purchase price accounting benefits from the Tumi and Asian distributor acquisitions.   





We believe that Samsonite inappropriately inflated Tumi’s reported payables and accrued expenses by at least $62 


million in its purchase price accounting.  The inflation of such liabilities allows Samsonite to avoid having to recognize 


subsequent expenses on its income statement.  Because Samsonite purchased Tumi in August 2016, we adjust 


Samsonite’s Q1 2018 EBITDA to deduct 33% of that amount, or $21 million, in expenses we believe should have 


flowed through the Company’s income statement over the last four quarters.   





In addition, we also deduct what we believe to be illusory profits from inappropriate purchase price accounting with 


respect to the acquired inventory for Tumi’s Asian distributors.  By marking the value of such inventory down to only 


$9.4 million at the time of acquisition, even though the distributors carried 5-6 months of inventory on their balance 


sheets, we believe that Samsonite was able to unjustly inflate reported EBITDA by at least $32 million in the year 


ending Q1 2018.10   





Such deductions are not de minimis.  Samsonite’s shares trade at a premium because its growth trajectory is seemingly 


immune from the global retail apocalypse.  Yet such adjustments suggest that Samsonite’s reported growth is likely 


not as robust as the company claims.  Samsonite claimed that its EBITDA grew by $58.8 million in TTM ending Q1 


2018 (11%), but by our estimates, purchase price accounting games with payables and inventory inflated reported 


EBITDA by $53 million in that period.  Had the Company used proper purchase price accounting, we believe that its 


reported growth would have been far lower.  Not only would Samsonite then trade off of a lower EBITDA number, 


but we believe the share multiple premium Samsonite enjoys over other mid-tier brands would disappear once its 


financials reflected slower growth.    





If we take Samsonite’s adjusted EBITDA and apply the median multiple of our peer group of five mid-tier brands 


(11.0x), we get a 34% downside to Samsonite’s stock before applying any corporate governance discount. 


                                                           
10 Calculation is as follows.  2H 2016 Tumi sales to Asian distributors was $70.8 million.  We assume, based on Samsonite’s 


disclosures, that the acquired distributors held 6 months of inventory on their balance sheets at the time of the acquisitions.  If we 


subtract sales to non-acquired distributors (ex Japan, Thailand, India and Indonesia) and online sales, we estimate that Samsonite 


sales to acquired distributors was $46.4 million in 2H FY 2016.  Given that Samsonite marked the acquired inventory at only $9.4 


million, we estimate that the understatement (i.e., value of acquired inventory minus recognized amount) was at least $32 million 


as of LTM ending Q1 2018.

Simply adjusting for two instances of inappropriate purchase price accounting and applying a median multiple of a 


charitable peer group, we calculate that Samsonite’s shares are worth 34% less than their current trading price.  But 


we also believe a corporate governance discount is appropriate given the CEO’s resume embellishment, the accounting 


red flags such as auditor resignations at Samsonite South Asia, and the number of questionable transactions between 


the Company and related parties owned or controlled by the CEO and his family.  If we apply only a 15% governance 


discount, we value Samsonite’s shares at HKD 19.11 on an EV/TTM adjusted EBITDA basis.   





We reach a similar conclusion on a forward basis.  The consensus street forecast is that Samsonite’s EBITDA will 


grow by 17.15% in FY 2018.  But we think much of this growth is likely illusory.   





As discussed in this report, Samsonite is carrying an increasing balance of inventory at NRV.  At the beginning of FY 


2018, Samsonite disclosed that 42% of its finished goods were carried at NRV.  Such inventory, by definition, must 


be sold at zero margin.  Samsonite’s margins have thus far not been affected by this growing balance of unprofitable 


luggage, but the pain cannot be delayed indefinitely.  





It is difficult to be precise about the exact effect on such NRV inventory on Samsonite’s margins and growth.  But the 


trend, in our opinion, clearly indicates that Samsonite’s growth is not as robust as the market believes.  It would also 


corroborate anecdotal evidence from Samsonite’s online sales practice in which Samsonite’s very own website offers 


luggage for sale at deep discounts to its list price.

If Samsonite’s online retail platform is offering luggage at a 50% discount, how will the Company sustain its 56% 


gross margins going forward?   





In order to be conservative, we assign a growth rate of 10%, rather than the 17.5% consensus forecast for EBITDA 


growth.  We believe this growth rate is generous yet still accounts for the ill effects of the growing balance of NRV 


inventory on the Company’s balance sheet.  Analysts forecast that Samsonite’s peer group will report less than 1% 


EBITDA growth, given global retail headwinds, so we think our use of 10% growth in our model is highly generous.

Because Samsonite is trading at all-time highs, by assigning a more modest growth rate (10%) to Samsonite’s adjusted 


TTM Q1 2018 EBITDA, we value its shares at a significant discount to current market price on a forward EBITDA 


basis. 








Applying only a 15% corporate governance discount and a median multiple of peers, we value Samsonite’s shares on 


a forward basis at HKD 19.00 per share, 44% below Samsonite’s current price. 





Another way to value Samsonite’s shares is as a multiple of free cash flow.  This metric will generally be immune to 


the purchase price accounting games played by management.  If we simply value Samsonite’s shares at the median 


multiple of mid-tier brands on an EV/TTM FCF basis (21.2x), without applying a corporate governance discount we 


would value Samsonite’s shares at HKD 9.51 per share.

The table above underscores just how overvalued Samsonite is.  Without a corporate governance discount or any 


deductions for purchase price accounting, valued on the same multiple of free cash flows as its peer, we estimate 


Samsonite’s shares to be worth 72% less than its last traded price. 





We believe that an EV/EBITDA multiple is the best valuation method for Samsonite, because it accounts for the high 


amount of debt it has relative to its peers.  Comparing Samsonite’s 2.8x net/debt to EBITDA ratio to both luxury and 


mid-tier comps, Samsonite is the obvious and massive outlier.  Indeed, three have net cash (SFER.MI, BRBY, and 


RL) and only one comp, PVH.N, has close to Samsonite’s leverage. 





 
Source: Thompson Reuters 





Although we believe a valuation on an EV/EBITDA multiple is superior because it accounts for Samsonite’s 


substantial debt, we are sensitive that the sell-side analyst community prefers to value Samsonite on a P/E basis.  When 


we value Samsonite on forward P/E basis, the impact of adjustments for purchase price accounting games or NRV 


inventory are just as significant.

In our model, we assume a 5% organic growth rate in earnings, which we believe is in line with analyst forecasts and 


consistent with the Company’s reported historic organic growth (excluding acquisitions).  Even on a forward P/E 


basis, at a median multiple of our peer list, we value Samsonite’s shares at 33% below current price.   





A blended average of our four valuation approaches yields a share price of HKD 17.59 per share, 48% below 


Samsonite’s last traded price.   








There are reasons to believe that our valuation is conservative, and that the down side could be even more significant 


to Samsonite’s stock price.  First, we compare Samsonite to fashion brands like Ralph Lauren, Kate Spade and Calvin 


Klein, which is likely charitable.  Second, our valuation does not quantify the growing balance of stale inventory 


which we believe will hamper growth and crush margins.  Third, we apply only a 15% corporate governance discount. 





We believe that Samsonite’s board of directors has no choice but to terminate Ramesh Tainwala for fabricating a 


doctorate credential on his CV.  We also believe it is imperative for the board to appoint an independent audit firm to 


scrutinize all transactions involving Company JV Samsonite South Asia, the Company’s treatment of inventory and 


its purchase price accounting.  This inquiry must also scrutinize the litany of disclosed and undisclosed connections 


between Samsonite South Asia, Abhishri, Bagzone and other entities owned and controlled by the CEO and his family.     





Ultimately, we believe that Samsonite is simply carrying too much baggage to trade at such a high premium.
