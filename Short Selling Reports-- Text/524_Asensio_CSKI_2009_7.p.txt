China Sky’s Reported Inventory Belies Its Stated
Earnings and Sales.


Posted on May 5, 2009 by Asensio.com


An analysis of China Sky One Medical, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: CSKI)


inventory reporting, as well as certain customer and supplier


disclosures, raises serious questions about the accuracy of its


reported sales and earnings. See attached Exhibits 1 – 4.


Reports previously issued by asensio.com revealed discrepancies in


China Sky’s stated EPS, gross margins and average sales prices,


along with concerns about its corporate governance and auditors.


The inventory analysis was performed for each year that China Sky


has been a public company and filed financial disclosures. The


analysis compares the inventory levels each year and against other


comparable Chinese companies.


China Sky is claiming that its annual sales have increased more


than twenty-fold since 2004, but its finished goods inventory has


declined in absolute terms by 75%. China Sky’s finished goods


inventory was four times greater in 2004 than in 2008, while its


sales were more than 20 times greater in 2008 than in 2004. China


Sky’s finished goods inventory level implies that it turned over


finished goods more than 365 times in 2008, and only 4.5 times in


2004.


In 2008, China Sky reported $91 million in sales, but the company


reported just $55,614 in finished goods inventory at year-end. In


2004*, China Sky reported $4.2 million in sales, while it reported


$229,136 in finished goods inventory at year-end.


The $55,614 in finished goods inventory China Sky reports having at


the end of 2008 implies that it had less than one day’s worth of sales


in finished goods inventory, using the average daily sales in the


fourth quarter. This is also the case for 2007. In 2004, however, the

company had 81 days of sales in finished goods inventory. See


Exhibit 2.


There are other irregularities in China Sky’s reported inventory.


Exhibit 4 shows the questionable reductions in the company’s


disclosed finished goods inventory that have occurred during the


fourth quarter the past two years. In 2008, finished goods inventory


declined 92% in the fourth quarter. In 2007 there was nearly a 93%


decline. In 2006, the decline was 41%.


China Sky’s inventory claims appear irregular when compared to


other public companies selling so-called traditional-Chinese-


medicine products in China. As shown in Exhibit 3, in 2008 China


Sky had an inventory turnover ratio that was nearly ten times


greater than the average inventory turnover of three other


comparable companies. While comparable companies report as


much as 184 days of inventory on hand, China Sky only had 7 days


of total inventory on hand at the end of 2008.


An analysis of China Sky’s procurement and distribution is


contained in Exhibit 1. This exhibit compares customer and


supplier relationships in 2006 versus 2008. The company claimed to


have customers covering the same geographic area in 2006 and in


2008. While reported revenues increased from $19.9 million in 2006


to $91.8 million, China Sky’s number of customers actually


decreased from 900 to 233 over the same period, according to China


Sky’s 10-Ks.


Exhibit 1 also notes the discrepancies in China Sky’s disclosures of


supplier and customer relationships between the 2007 and 2006 10-


Ks. For example, in its 2006 10-K the company stated, “No one


supplier accounts for more than 20% of our total raw material


purchases.” However, the 2007 10-K apparently contradicts this by


stating that the supplier Harbin Yongheng Printing Ltd. accounted


for 27% of inventory purchases in 2006. The nature of these


supplier and customer relationships and the conflicting disclosures


about those relationships only add to questions about the seemingly


unbelievable reported inventory figures.


China Sky claims in its 2007 10-K that it “has a small inventory on


hand primarily due to the enhanced productivity of newly


purchased equipment and machinery, and the popularity of


Company products in the market.” This is the only basis China Sky


gives to explain its irregular inventory level.


Perhaps China Sky is referring to its newly acquired transportation


equipment as an explanation for its inventory. China Sky reports


$885,880 in transportation equipment at year-end 2008, up from


$318,779 at year-end 2007. China Sky does not disclose how it


distributes $91 million worth of product throughout 22 provinces of
