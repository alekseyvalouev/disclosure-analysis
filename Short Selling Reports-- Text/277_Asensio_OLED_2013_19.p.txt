Universal Display claims “obsolescence” as an
excuse for its accounting irregularities.


Posted on November 6, 2013 by asensio.com


Wednesday, November 6, 2013.   According to documents recently


made public Universal Display Corp. (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) has


been the target of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)


inquiries since April of this year, investigating UDC’s accounting of


its Samsung contract. UDC’s responses to the SEC show that there is


considerable uncertainty about whether Samsung will continue


making license payments to UDC. UDC itself revealed this in its


responses to the SEC’s inquiry into UDC’s irregular revenue


recognition practices.


Since UDC started receiving semi-annual Samsung license


payments, UDC has followed the highly irregular accounting


practice of reporting that revenue only when it actually receives the


cash from Samsung in the quarter in which the cash payment is


made. Faced with the SEC inquiry into this matter, UDC defended


this accounting policy by stating that the license fees are “not fixed


and determinable,” according to UDC’s SEC filings. The SEC targeted


UDC’s revenue recognition in a letter dated April 30th that tells UDC


to explain “why you [UDC] believe the amounts due from SDC


[Samsung Display] are not fixed or determinable until they become


due and payable.” UDC’s incredibly complicated response to the


SEC’s simple inquiry points to the uncertainty surrounding the


payments from Samsung, which UDC has not discussed with its


investors.


To defend its accounting practices in response to the SEC inquiry,


UDC pointed to the supposed risk of “obsolescence.” UDC stated that


it chose its irregular revenue recognition “[b]ecause …. the risk of
technological obsolescence can be considered high.”

We believe that UDC’s “obsolescence” justification really points to


the termination rights in Samsung’s contract and the increasing


likelihood that Samsung could use these termination rights as a


result of recent and future negative rulings on UDC’s key patents.


UDC has not disclosed Samsung’s termination rights in its August


2011 contract.


The SEC inquiry letters also point out that UDC is avoiding accruing


for any contingency loss related to patent litigation. The SEC


pointed specifically to a recent negative patent ruling to ask why


UDC did not disclose contingency losses in the notes to the financial


statements. The SEC’s letters suggest that UDC should be capitalizing


the full amount of licensing payments and evenly amortizing the


capitalized amount over the life of the contract. Instead, UDC


refuses to capitalize its Samsung contract payment due, which it


argues allow it to avoid disclosing contingencies related to patent


invalidation or early termination of the Samsung contract.


UDC’s evasive explanations to the SEC are only part of much


broader disclosure problems addressed in prior asensio.com


reports, ranging from patent litigation disclosures to sales


breakdowns to promotional statements to investors about its


management’s past that misrepresent its patent management


expertise.
