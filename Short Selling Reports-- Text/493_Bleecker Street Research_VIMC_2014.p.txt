Vimicro: Numerous Red Flags Make This A Strong Sell
Oct. 7, 2014 9:57 AM ET19 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


VIMC share price has risen over 200% because of misleading press releases.


VIMC management has $.19 options which vest in the coming weeks.


VIMC management has been registering millions of dollars worth of stock to sell.


Numerous other red flags covered in the article.


Vimicro (NASDAQ:VIMC) is a Chinese company that produces video surveillance
technology and products. It is not a particularly good company, yet it's stock price has
risen over 250% in the last month alone. VIMC IPO'd in 2005 offering 8.7 million shares at
$10/ share in an offering lead by Morgan Stanley. I believe that there are some red flags
that investors could be potentially ignoring.


A Revolving Door of CFOs


VIMC has seen an alarmingly high level of turnover at the CFO position, and some of
these CFOs have been involved with questionable companies in the past.


In the past three years no CFO has stayed longer than 12 months and the company went
an entire year without a CFO from April 2013 to April 2014. Turnover of that level should
alarm investors. Digging deeper into the past of these CFOs reveals some interesting
background. Take for example Mr. Wu. In the press release announcing his introduction as
CFO the company gave a brief biography.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545575-vimicro-numerous-red-flags-make-this-a-strong-sell 2/17


Mr. Wu is an experienced corporate finance and management professional, with
nearly 20 years' experience working with leading multinational and local Chinese
companies in China in technology and other sectors. Before joining Vimicro, he
worked as China Managing Director at Dragon Bay Capital, a China-focused
management consulting firm. He had also served as CFO positions in several
companies, including China Natural Gas, China Medicine Corporation and
AlliancePharm US LLC, as well as a Senior Finance Manager at Motorola, Inc. He
earned an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a
Master of Arts in Criminal Justice from Indiana University.


In the 2011 20-F they left out a few positions that they mentioned in the press release


Peidong (Richard) Wu joined our company in 2011 as our chief financial officer. Mr.
Wu is an experienced corporate finance and management professional, with nearly
twenty years' experience working with leading multinational and local Chinese
companies in China in technology and other sectors. From 2006 to 2011, Mr. Wu
worked as China Managing Director at Dragon Bay Capital, a China-focused
management consulting firm. He has also served as chief financial officer and china
managing director at The AlliancePharm US LLC from 2000 to 2006. Mr. Wu
received his MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a
M.A. degree in Criminal Justice from Indiana University.


In the 20-F there was no mention of his role as CFO of China Natural Gas and China
Medicine Corporation. Perhaps it was because they were attempting to hide the fact that
both companies were zeros. China Natural Gas was first of fraud accused by Alfred Little
in May 2010. Two years later the SEC brought charges of fraud against China Natural
Gas, charges which were eventually settled in 2013. In the case of China Medicine
Corporation the stock now trades at $.01/ share after its accountant resigned and the
company said its financial statements from 2008-2010 were unreliable.
BigClassAction.com provides an overview:


On February 22, 2011, China Medicine issued a press release announcing that
Frazer, LLP, the Company's accountant, would be declining to stand for
reappointment. On the news, the Company's stock lost more than 40% of its value
from February 23, 2010 to March 23, 2011.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545575-vimicro-numerous-red-flags-make-this-a-strong-sell 3/17


Then on March 23, 2011, China Medicine filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") announcing that its board of directors (the "Board")
had concluded that the Company's financial statements filed with the SEC for the
2008 and 2009 fiscal years and the quarterly reports during the fiscals years 2008,
2009 and 2010 were unreliable. China Medicine also disclosed that certain
accounting and reporting errors were identified with respect to improper activities by
certain employees at the Company's subsidiaries. The Company purportedly intends
to restate the previously issued financial statements and has withdrawn its
application for a NASDAQ listing. In reaction to the news, on the next trading day,
China Medicine's stock dropped by over 53% from $1.16 per share on March 23,
2011 to $0.54 per share on March 24, 2011 on heavy volume.


On July 8, 2011, the Company announced that its earlier financial statements for the 2006
and 2007 fiscal years were also considered materially unreliable. In reaction, China
Medicine's stock lost 10% closing at $0.72 per share down from $0.80 per share on July 8,
2011.


Just six months after this restatement Mr. Wu joined VIMC taking the role of CFO.
Perhaps Mr. Tang's record is better? The 2012 20-F gives Mr. Tang's bio.


David Tang rejoined our company in 2012 as our chief financial officer and was
appointed to the position of chief strategy officer in April 2013. Mr. Tang is in charge
of investment, investor relations and strategic business development activities. He is
an experienced financial professional with extensive experience on investments.
Most recently, Mr. Tang was active as an investor and as a managing partner of iFirst
Capital LLC, a Shenzhen-based VC/PE firm. Before that, Mr. Tang served as Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of Vimicro from July 2008 to November 2010.
Prior to that, he served as the Chief Financial Officer of CNinsure Inc. a NASDAQ
listed company operating in China, and before that, Mr. Tang served as the Chief
Financial Officer of IRICO Group and Chinasoft International, both Hong Kong-listed
companies. Prior to those positions, he worked as an equity research analyst at
Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. Mr. Tang received an MBA degree from the Stern
School of Business, New York University


While Mr. Tang certainly has a cleaner record than the previous CFO, it is not without
blemish. His previous role as CFO of CNinsure had issues, although no where near the
level of the issues Mr. Wu had. CNinsure was the subject of a $19/ share buyout offer but
the deal fell through after accusations of irregularities in the sales incentive program of the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545575-vimicro-numerous-red-flags-make-this-a-strong-sell 4/17


company. After Mr. Tang left the company in April 2013 the VIMC had no CFO for the next
year, so during that time there is no CFO that was involved with previous failures. Current
CFO Peter Li appears to be the only CFO in the last four years that has not had any
issues in previous roles. He was previously the CFO of Hollysys Automation and Yucheng
Technologies. Yucheng Technolgies went private at $3.88/ share in October 2012 and
Hollysys trades on the NASDAQ with a market cap of $1.2B.


Auditor Issues???


While a high level of CFO turnover is surely something of note, it does not by itself mean
anything. A recent press release announced that Grant Thornton was replacing Ernst &
Young as VIMC's auditor. I found this interesting because I had not seen any press
release announcing that Ernst & Young was resigning as auditor. That is likely because
while the press release announcing the auditor change appears on the NASDAQ website,
it does not appear on VIMC's website under the rest of their press releases. While the
press release contained the usual "the split was amicable" type language, it did have
another interesting nugget of information. At the bottom of the press release, under "About
Grant Thortnton" was the following information:


Grant Thornton, China firm of Grant Thornton International, is headquartered in
Beijing, with approximately 150 partners and 3,000 professionals in 19 offices in
China. Grant Thornton offers a full range of services including assurance, tax,
advisory, asset valuation and project cost management. Grant Thornton serves a
broad client base that encompasses more than 140 public companies and over
2,000 state owned enterprises


(SOEs) and privately held businesses, as well as foreign-invested enterprises,
including US-listed companies such as Yanzhou Coal Mining Co., Ltd. (NYSE:YZC),
e-Future Information Technology Inc (Nasdaq:EFUT), China Finance Online Co.,
Ltd. (NASDAQ:JRJC), etc., and HK-listed companies such as Brilliance China
Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114.HK), SINOPEC Engineering (Group) Co., Limited
(02386.HK), Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (0175.HK), Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.,
Ltd. (1171.HK), etc..


I noticed immediately the companies that Grant and Thornton had audited. Being familiar
with JRJC and having published negatively on it recently I was curious what the other
companies were. While YRZ is a $5B market cap mining company, EFUT is a $16M
market cap online company that has had little success. JRJC recently went on a run up

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545575-vimicro-numerous-red-flags-make-this-a-strong-sell 5/17


similar to what VIMC is doing now. For those unfamiliar with the story JRJC announced a
joint venture, the stock went parabolic, but has crashed over 30% in the last 5 days when
earnings were released and those that had bought into the hyped up growth story were
disappointed. It is interesting that JRJC and EFUT were two of the companies listed in the
auditors description, likely implying that those are the largest US listed companies that
they audit. If VIMC was rapidly growing why would they be trading down auditors like they
just did?


VIMC's Competitors


These are just a few of the competitors that VIMC lists in its 20-F:


1. Ali Corp
2. EMPIA Technology
3. Sonix Technology
4. Sunplus Technology
5. Texas Instruments
6. HiSilicon Technologies
7. Ambarella
8. Sony
9. Samsung


10. NXP Semiconductors


Interestingly enough none of those companies even mention VIMC as one of their
competitors, odd since VIMC describes itself as a "leading video processor and video
surveillance provider." But that should not be the main takeaway. Instead it is interesting to
note how much better funded its competitors are and how much more they spend on R&D.
In 2013 VIMC spent just $11 million in R&D. Here's what it's competitors that had readily
available filings spent on R&D:


Company 2013 R&D Spend


It's unclear how VIMC can compete with these companies given its miniscule R&D spend
compared to its competitors.


Sneaky Insider Selling?


While the share price has been shooting up, insiders have been registering shares to sell
via Form 144's. Below is a screen shot of the registrations to sell shares from Bloomberg.

VIMC Doesn't Own All Of The Entity Mentioned In Recent Press Release


A recent press release said that VIMC had gotten a had won a contract worth $12M. The
press release read:


Vimicro International Corporation ("Vimicro" or the "Company"), a leading video
surveillance technology and solution provider in China, today announced that its joint
venture, Shanxi Zhongtianxin Science and Technology Co. Ltd. ("Zhongtianxin"), has
won a contract to provide SVAC-compliant video surveillance cameras and system
to the Traffic Police Detachment of Taiyuan for RMB76 million, or USD12.4 million
approximately. The project is expected to be completed by early 2015.


"We are pleased to have won this contract to supply our SVAC-compliant video
surveillance products and system to the Taffic Police Detachment of Taiyuan,
following our successful implementation of Phase I of Tiawang," commented Dr.
John Deng, Vimicro's Chairman and CEO. "This contract win validates further
adoption of SVAC national video surveillance standard from public security video
surveillance system to local traffic control monitoring in Shanxi Province. As the only
proven provider of SVAC technology and solutions in the marketplace, Vimicro will
continue to leverage its first-mover advantages to capitalize on the megatrend of
SVAC national standard adoption by the government, to further establish itself as a
leading player in China's video surveillance market."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545575-vimicro-numerous-red-flags-make-this-a-strong-sell 11/17


Peter Li, CFO of Vimicro, commented, "In the meantime, we have won the
competitive bidding of Phase II Tiawang for Taiyuan City of Shangxi Province, which
will be announced at future due time."


No where in the press release do they mention that they just have a 50% ownership stake
in the JV that won the contract.


Additionally, Zhongtianxin is a related party which was respnsible for almost ⅓ of VIMC's
total revenue. Again from the 20-F:


In September 2012, we established Zhongtianxin with Guoxin Group and VMF
Consulting Company (a related party entity controlled by Zhonghan (John) Deng and
Zhaowei (Kevin) Jin, who are members of our management team and managed by
Xiaodong (NASDAQ:DAVE) Yang, who acted as our director until May 2012) to
focus on our surveillance business. Guoxin Group and VMF Consulting Company
agreed to make cash contributions of RMB98 million and RMB4 million, respectively,
to Zhongtianxin. In addition, Vimicro China agreed to make a cash contribution of
RMB26 million and provide certain intellectual property, appraised at RMB72 million
by an independent third-party valuation firm, as part of its investment in
Zhongtianxin. As of December 31, 2013, these amounts had been paid in full.Our
investment in Zhongtianxin is accounted for using the equity method as Guoxin
Group may exercise substantive participating rights in accordance with the
constitutive documents of Zhongtianxin.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545575-vimicro-numerous-red-flags-make-this-a-strong-sell 12/17


In 2013, our sales to Zhongtianxin totaled $21.3 million. This amount primarily
consisted of the sales of inventories from Vimicro Tianjin and Vimicro Fuzhou
to Zhongtianxin to carry out its surveillance projects in Taiyuan and Baoding.
We also purchased inventory from Zhongtianxin in the amount of $3.7 million. In
addition, as of December 31, 2013, the amount due to us from Zhongtianxin totaled
$19.4 million. This outstanding amount primarily consisted of accounts receivable.
As of December 31, 2013, we had an amount due to Zhongtianxin of $6.8 million
which was related to prepayments made to vendors by Zhongtianxin on behalf of our
company.


More importantly VIMC's revenue from related parties has been increasing rapidly, which
could mean that some of the revenue is coming from uneconomic transactions.

Additionally, VIMC has an incredibly high DSO (days sales outstanding)

Comments (19)


This combined with the increase in revenue from related parties could suggest that the
company is struggling to collect its account receivables from related parties.


Options Vesting


VIMC management has options at $.19 that will vest in a few weeks. These options were
granted as part of the 2004 Share Option Plan. These options were re-priced in 2008
because the stock price had fallen so much that management no longer believed it was
enough to incentivize management.


Source: 20-F


Conclusion


A massive run up in the stock price right before options vest, misleading press releases,
hidden registration of shares to sell by management, increasing revenue from related
parties. This is just another stock that has been over-hyped and pumped on misleading
news. It will end the same way the countless others have.

Peter Li is a great guy and has always been CFO of co's with strong fundamentals. He has no reason to join a scam! I
think the fundamentals have changed materially and shorts may be premature

So your counter argument is Peter Li is a great guy? lol sub $5 we go but not after insiders cash in those
options!

'No idea if Caesar's CFO is above suspicion'. 
But the great presentation as how to find a short candidate's catalysts.Thanks to the author as also his tip rank rating
is unquestionable.100 pc correct shots so far,though those are few.I wish advisor shares should take your services. 
I got into the put as a small position first thing in the morning but finding that mkt is still in denial mode got out at 20 pc
profit. 
Adam,thanks for providing the link of instablog.I hope SA is thinking to add the symbols of instablog also in search
function else the very idea to write there is less meaningful.(All the more reason Adam,when your ranking is 6 times
better than that of Michael Blair in TRanks.He shorts the bullet train as a habit and still get published to play with our
time.At some point these authors should be made accountable.)

Sub 5 doubtful. The fundamentals have changed materially and your limited knowledge of the robust growth may
prove toxic to shorting at 9 dollars. It's a market and shorts are welcome at this early stage in VIMC's revenue and
earnings explosion. If option redemption is your best argument, then you should be short every stock in the market.
That's a pretty crappy premise upon which too short!

meanwhile in the real world vimc shares are down 12%.

No chance VIMC will return to 3. The underlying fundamentals, as seen in financial results, are accelerating. Shorting
accelerating fundamentals "ain't" smart. But I hope you keep shorting and shorting. If the business grows from 90 to
150 mil next year, you will be torched!

VIMC's fundamentals hasn't been changed for a long time. It's a IC design house, but no new products for a
long time. It got a few new business with government recently but that can't be lasting.


14 Oct 2014, 07:37 AM


jack2000
The fundamentals of VIMC hasn't changed at all. It got a few new business from government recently, but that doesn't
implies the fundamental has changed. It can't be lasting without new products. Can you find out any new products
from VIMC in the past year? That would be a difficult task.


14 Oct 2014, 07:34 AM


sandiegosam
Why have they received numerous contracts of late? Your thesis is because mgmt owns some options. Lame thesis.
VIMC could go to 5 or 15 - I don't know...But, your thesis is awful. The company sales and earnings have been rising
rapidly and should accelerate given the large contract wins....not a time to be shorting!

that leading chinese agencies would purchase outdated technology? Might want to rethink your short!

Investment Highlights 
1) Continuing winning orders from Taiyuan City and massive orders from Guangdong Province is expected to come
later next year. The recent orders from Taiyuan City have a total contact size of 320M, and all the orders are expected
to complete in the early to 2015 and be recognized as revenues. Also, Vimicro's recruitment activities in Hunan
Province is intensive in the recent month, and we believe that implementation of SVAC in Hunan and company related
good news are likely with high probability. 
2) Chip 718 will be fully launched in November, simultaneously compatible with SVAC/H.264 and H.265, which is
used in security surveillance project for both government and enterprise level. The more economical version with less
functions, CHIP 718L, will be rolled out next year. 
3) SVAC will be the “Standard" in China with high probability, cooperation with Haikang and Dahua provides bright
future. First, Vimicro is one of the leader working with the government developing the SVAC standard, with absolute
first mover advantage in core areas such as calculating, coding and de-coding. Moreover, H.264 and 265 have some
fatal limitations when applying in security surveillance; H.265 requires more resources in bandwidth and memory
space. China is promoting cyber-security, anti-terrorism,and social harmony across the country, and the one fits with
the self-developed and manufactured theme would be the SVAC standard.


Maintain "Buy" recommendation and increase the 12 month price target to $15.8. Vimicro successfully transform as
the leading security surveillance solution provider in China, and will benefit from the continuing SVAC standard
implementation in the country wide level. We expected the gross margin to gradually increase from 33% to 38% in the
near future and net profit margin is expected to be 10% to 13%. We increase the forecast as: 2014-16 Revenue to be

Here is a note from local chinese investment bank. I think they are better able to do DD than any of these researchers
who have made really shank short arguments. Here goes 
Investment Highlights  
1) Continuing winning orders from Taiyuan City and massive orders from Guangdong Province is expected to come
later next year. The recent orders from Taiyuan City have a total contact size of 320M, and all the orders are expected
to complete in the early to 2015 and be recognized as revenues. Also, Vimicro's recruitment activities in Hunan
Province is intensive in the recent month, and we believe that implementation of SVAC in Hunan and company related
good news are likely with high probability. 
2) Chip 718 will be fully launched in November, simultaneously compatible with SVAC/H.264 and H.265, which is
used in security surveillance project for both government and enterprise level. The more economical version with less
functions, CHIP 718L, will be rolled out next year.

3) SVAC will be the “Standard" in China with high probability, cooperation with Haikang and Dahua provides bright
future. First, Vimicro is one of the leader working with the government developing the SVAC standard, with absolute
first mover advantage in core areas such as calculating, coding and de-coding. Moreover, H.264 and 265 have some
fatal limitations when applying in security surveillance; H.265 requires more resources in bandwidth and memory
space. China is promoting cyber-security, anti-terrorism,and social harmony across the country, and the one fits with
the self-developed and manufactured theme would be the SVAC standard.


Maintain "Buy" recommendation and increase the 12 month price target to $15.8. Vimicro successfully transform as
the leading security surveillance solution provider in China, and will benefit from the continuing SVAC standard
implementation in the country wide level. We expected the gross margin to gradually increase from 33% to 38% in the
near future and net profit margin is expected to be 10% to 13%. We increase the forecast as: 2014-16 Revenue to be
95.5M, 146.1M, 198.7M, representing growth of 48%、53%、36%; net profit to be 3.9M, 14.6M, and 21.9M,
representing growth of 147%、270%、49%. We employ the PEG valuation method to give target price of $15.8,
corresponding to 0.8 times diluted PEG with 73% upside potential.
