Missing Pictures Of 21Vianet Group's MNS Ghost Offices

Summary


A recent article used photos that we mistakenly uploaded in a clerical error to
attempt to discredit our evidence.


As you can see below, the photos we actually took are of the exact same locations
as those erroneously uploaded and are easy to confuse due to their similarity.


Meanwhile, VNET is already tampering with the evidence within their control, such
as their list of data centers on their website.


Attempts to discredit the copious evidence we produced by singling out a couple of
pictures we allegedly never took smacks of an attempt to divert attention from the
substantial issues.


Those issues include iJoy's inexplicable financials and related party transactions, the
major discrepancy between MNS Entities' financials and their SAIC filings, illegal
MNS operations, serious balance sheet issues, etc.


This article published in response to our first report on 21Vianet Group ("VNET")
attempted to discredit over 100 exhibits and an attached 77-page appendix with more
exhibits that we published. PDF versions of those reports can be found on our website or
on Scribd.com (report here and appendix here).


Despite the author's attempt to divert attention from the key issues, the key issues remain
unresolved despite a conference call the company held in response to our report on
September 11, 2014. As we expected, the company, as well as the author of the short
article that tried to discredit us, failed to address any of the key issues, which include but
are not limited to the following.


1. iJoy's inexplicable financials and ridiculous near 100% profit margins (as disclosed in
the 2013 20-F, page F-39) after years of miserably unprofitable financial performance
as disclosed in SAIC filings (see section beginning on page 40 of our first report)


2. The trail of events that strongly suggests iJoy's acquisition was orchestrated to
roundtrip acquisition proceeds and cash balances into VNET by pumping the
company's cash balances up through a loan to the seller and the purchase of

equipment shortly after the acquisition (see pages 46-50 of our first report). The receipt
we showed of a transaction with one of China's five largest iron ore importers suggests
fake contracts were used to roundtrip the cash in as software revenue (see page 57)


3. The long list of red flags from a review of MNS acquired subsidiaries' SAIC filings, not
the least of which include ghost office registrations with the SAIC for all MNS
acquisitions and a 51% overstatement of consolidated revenue reported to the SEC
when compared to revenue reported to the SAIC (see pages 63-64 of our first report)


4. The fact that per China's telecom regulations and China Telecom's internal policies,
VNET's MNS subsidiaries are operating illegally (see pages 94-99 of our first report)
and are not appropriately licensed (see pages 82-84 and 100-101) and VNET remains
on China Telecom's blacklist of illegal bandwidth reselling as recently as August 6,
2014 (see page 94)


5. The fact that over half of VNET's reported partnered data centers (the list of 60 we
investigated was taken from VNET's own corporate website, as noted in Appendix A of
our report) had contracts that were already terminated some time ago or were never
partnered to begin with. Interestingly, VNET's website has begun making some
changes to their data center list, omitting certain data centers listed before our article
was published and including certain others. We have screen shots of the original
website contents and will publish the "before and after" screen shots once VNET is
done tampering with their previously disclosed data center list.


6. Clear evidence that all the issues mentioned above are only getting worse over time as
VNET acquires highly suspicious and troubled non-core businesses at larger and
larger valuations to continue its modus operandi of consolidating acquired revenue to
generate financials that cannot be explained by fundamentals. The last of these
transactions is Aipu, which has been banned in three cities, was investigated by the
SAIC and China's state-owned CCTV for consumer fraud, was denied a listing in
China's A-share stock market and was acquired at a 20x multiple to the valuation at
which the #2 insider sold (see pages 108-155 of our first report).


Of course, we are purposely not mentioning dozens of other red flags that abound for the
sake of brevity, but the list is very long.


Instead of addressing these substantial issues, all the author of the "Bogus Exhibit" article
can point to at the moment are three pictures that were uploaded in a clerical error for
which we have matching pictures we took. See below for yourself.

The dozens of locations we visited to verify the existence of VNET's many acquisitions
(we were unable to verify any MNS acquisitions or iJoy, among others we have yet to write
about) were generally difficult to find. The Fujian and Jiujiang's offices were particularly
challenging to locate exactly, and it took our ground team two days to finally be able to
take pictures. Taxi drivers or our own personal drivers were not able to find them from the
streets, so we mapped their location through Baidu, collecting pictures from the Web

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2494535-missing-pictures-of-21vianet-groups-mns-ghost-offices 8/25


whenever available to help our ground team pinpoint the offices. When we tagged these
pictures, of which we have over 200 for the MNS subsidiaries alone, the pictures above
were tagged improperly. When we uploaded our substantial over 120-pager, the document
we submitted to SA contained three incorrect pictures, which we have rectified above.


Contrary to what the "Bogus Exhibits" author suggests, all these pictures were taken in
good faith and reported as is, with no modifications. All one has to do is log in to the SAIC
site themselves, pull the same records we did and go verify that our pictures are 100%
real in person. We encourage investors to check the latest SAIC filing documents from
their official website http://www.saic.gov.cn/ywbl/zxcx/djqyxxcx/ and pay an in-person visit
to all the MNS subsidiaries and iJoy offices.


For those not wanting to do that, we provided screen shots of all registered office locations
in our report. Even the company admitted to investors that the office locations were
accurate and in their conference call, only challenged the number of employees that iJoy
has, which apparently is between 30-40 as opposed to the 5-8 we reported from SAIC
filings. The company may very well have hired more people into iJoy or shifted Fastweb's
employees or otherwise reorganized since the 2013 acquisition, but the facts remain that
upon time of acquisition, the SAIC reported a smaller number of employees and financials
that do not even remotely resemble the post-acquisition performance of iJoy.


We leave you with some more pictures of the areas surrounding the locations where ZYTL
and YJHT should be per SAIC registration as well as the promise that very shortly, we will
disclose more evidence of VNET's highly suspicious transactions (we have yet to discuss
related party transactions in detail) as well as poor corporate governance. Expect an
article with those details shortly, as soon as we are able to submit it to SA's editorial team.

Its impressive how quickly you guys scrambled to take the "real" pictures as soon as it was exposed they were simply
copied and pasted from other websites!

Even if they did, SO WHAT????


Isn't the point that VNET acquires ghost offices? And how does showing pictures later change that fact?

I could not care less where the pictures came from, a ghost office is a ghost office!!

With exception of the gate, even these pictures don't show the matched structures. Rather weak response in my
opinion.


15 Sep 2014, 07:40 AM


AlphaBetter, Contributor
These guys produce evidence that there are ghost offices and they supply links to the SAIC to verify the
locations, and all you can say is the other pictures don't exactly match the erroneously posted picture?????


How about the fact that the company has no offices???? Isn't that the point?


How some people get caught up in tearing down an author while ignoring the KEY argument and point is
unbelievable. Why should investors trust anything the company says when there are dozens of pictures that
are verifiable through the SAIC of ghost offices? Do you like investing in companies that acquire ghost offices
with shareholder cash?


Unbelievable... I'm not saying VNET is a fraud or not, but to point to these pictures and not have a ton of
questions is incredibly irresponsible as an investor.

It is... which reflected my opinion at the time. As disclosed I have been both long and short it. I think we both
know NQ is a joke whose most valuable asset for some time has been entertainment. I only watch it to see
what completely idiotic announcement they will come up with next. :)


15 Sep 2014, 10:25 AM


Robert Zangrilli, Contributor
Yes, COMF it looks like from your comments you were short NQ when it doubled last summer and long when
Muddy Waters demolished it at $22.


You also sing the praises of blatant NQ pumpers like Toro Investment Partners and Trade Star in your
comments.


Given your NQ experience, the fact that you're supporting another Toro-pumped stock like VNET is seriously
absurd.


The bottom line is your judgment is lacking, and you have no business interjecting yourself to criticize minor
issues with Trinity's research.

Robert engaging in a debate merely as a means for each of us to protect our conditioned egoic identities robs
us of our most valuable asset...free attention. I am sure every commenter and contributor on SA at one time
or another has felt the strong desire to validate themselves to a public they have never met. I can admit to
feeling that draw on occasion and would even offer that upon reflection my comment about the Instablog post
was just such an attempt. Thank you for your post which drew attention to this unnecessary behavior.


As a thank you, I would offer a book which I think you might enjoy. It's called The Untethered Soul by Michael

I think the key thing is that these offices are ghost offices and Trinity shows the investors the real 21ViaNet's MNS
business and iJoy. I think they did a great job to help investors to know the truth of the company.


I think Trinity is right, company is trying to avoid answer all these redflags and questions that Trinity report raised.
What company did so far is a disaster conference call and to find some weakness part of the report instead of explain
the questions and redflag. they also spread out the rumor that Microsoft wants to invest in them. just remind investors,
the reason 21ViaNet uses VIE structure is that telecom space in China is not allowed to have foreign investment.


try to think about this way, if 21ViaNet is clean enough, why they performed like they are fraud in the conference call
and answered all these questions without confidences.


In addition, all Chinese ADR started independent investigation process after got attacked. the recent examples are
NQ and MONT, which both started independent investigation shortly after attacked by Muddy water and Gravity. why
21ViaNet afraid of doing independent investigation?


Looking back to all Chinese companies got short attacked, Sino-forecast, Longtop, DGW, CCME, CIS, and more 20
companies got delisted. some of them ended up privatize like Focus-Media,AsiaInfo, VanceInfo, Spreatrum, MONT.


I think for investment decision, you have to think the likely that company will de-listed or go private. I think no-one will
privitize 21ViaNet if stock is above 5 dollars.

Not being able to speak English is not a factual basis for fraud. My opinion is that Chinese companies should
never let their non-English speaking executives answer questions from English speaking analysts, regardless
of their rank. No matter how hard they try, the executives come across as incompetent and out of touch.

Independent Investigations are worthless unless the entire scope of work is disclosed in writing and the
resulting report made public. We are talking about a company that provides the critical internet backbone in
China to some of the most important global companies in the world not to mention the Chinese government
itself. This company is not going away.


15 Sep 2014, 08:23 AM

"We are talking about a company that provides the critical internet backbone in China " do you really know
21ViaNet business. Internet Backbone, backbone network only can operated by Telecom Operators in China
according to the law.


21ViaNet's is doing IDC, which compete with China Telecom and China Unicom. pls all the evidences listed in

I am short this stock, as I talked in my other comments and I will keep short. I am a Chinese working for local
telecommunication operators. I see 21ViaNet's people also on this blog, then please answer my questions.


1)Why you made changes on your own website's IDC center list after this Trinity published their report? as China
Telecom and MIIT started nationwide investigation into illegal bandwidth reselling business, have you tried to spin off
MNS business? can you tell investors that how many of IDC centers were terminated by China Telecom and China
Unicom as you violate their contract doing illegal bandwidth reselling. I know you had to do so after acquired the
garbage Aipu and VPN business. let me tell the investors, it is gray area in China you resell the bandwidth to your
clients like Baidu or Tencent, but it is100% illegal to resell bandwidth to the operators like China Mobile, and cable
operators. that is why ChinaCache's resell their bandwidth to their own clients are fine with government, but 21ViaNet
resell their bandwidth to China Mobile is not Ok with government.


2) pls show your IDC operation license, are u allowed to operate your IDC business nationwide or just in some region.
you can not keep this business through bribery some government officials, you know in China central government are
cracking down all the bribery case. do you think 21ViaNet executives will get involved in some bribery cases?


3)as you are competitor to China telecom and China Unicom, do you think the report is backed by China Telecom and
China Unicom, as many of evidences from China Telecom.if the report is backed by China telecom and China
Unicom, are feel your IDC business and MNS business will get hit..


15 Sep 2014, 09:44 AM

I think now 21ViaNet has several issues: 
1) auditor will come to talk with companies, asking about iJoy, MNS, account receivables. the auditing process will be
much more complicated now, as now US SEC could access China based auditor's documents, so that is why Auditor
applied extensive auditing process and why NQ and Montage delay their 20F forever.


2) political risk: as now every Chinese news reported 21ViaNet and fraud, so government will put eyes on it and China
telecom operators will take advantage of this opportunity to kill 21ViaNet as they are competing on IDC.


3)MNS risk: now China Mobile was disclosed to use illegal bandwidth from 21ViaNet. then what China Mobile would
do. of course, they will terminate every contract with 21ViaNet on MNS business. MNS now still 30% their revenue
and all their EBIDTA profits. without MNS's shine, 21ViaNet looks ugly naked. Investors will realize that IDC business
is just something keep burning cash and not making any peny for ever. China IDC is oversupply right now.


4) acquisition: 21ViaNet needs to keep doing acquisitions to keep their ball rolling. with the fraud allegation, no one
wants to be acquired by 21ViaNet if they have real business.like Dermont, I think Dermont's owners are unhappy with
the stock options they got from 21ViaNet, as stock price has been down from 30 to now 20.


5)financing: the key driving for 21ViaNet growth is their ability of borrowing money from capital market. after fraud
allegation, no-one will give 21ViaNet loan any more..

Regarding the pictures of empty offices, I think the opinion of Deutsche Bank in its credit research of 21Vianet
published on Sep 12 quite useful.


" Other allegations about ghost offices and inconsistent SAIC filings are not new in our view and they haven't had
much teeth in past short seller reports on other Chinese companies. We believe it's not uncommon for companies to
have a registered office different from their main office and there are valid reasons for local filings to differ from the
international ones. In addition, in VNET's case some of their employees work at their customers/partner's sites; "


15 Sep 2014, 11:34 AM


Keubiko, Contributor
This is the standard response about ghost offices from companies that use them.


Just like NQ, they say it's just like "registering in Delaware". What they never do is address the fact that many
addresses do not PHYSICALLY exist. Companies that register in Delaware will use a law office or other
address that actually exists. You can't just register in Delaware under "1234 Go F Yourself Lane, Delaware".

some small firm could have ghost offices, as they could not pay the rental fee, so they use some address just

ghost offices?  
after consolidate into 21ViaNet and offices moved, the regulation in China required the company to change
their registration address. why they did not do that.

also the licesnes 21ViaNet shows on MNS business is all ISP and ICP license, not bandwidth reselling
license. bandwidth reselling need basic telecom license,which 21ViaNet does not have. they are misleading
investors that they have all these license, but none of them allow them to do bandwidth reselling busines in
china.

Author’s reply »  It's not just that, which is indeed a good point.


It's also that some of these offices cannot even be used as "Delaware addresses" because one of them is a
converted government building!! It is very very clear that these ghost offices were not used for
correspondence of any kind because the point about physical locations for some being pure fantasy aside,
how are you going to get any correspondence sent to a government building that only government officials
can enter in the first place.

By reading the company response. the biggest question for me is still that if MNS business is illegal or not and the
company response does not reduce my concerns. no evidences that 21ViaNet could reselling the bandwidth to China
Mobile with a bunch of ISP and ICP licenses.  
question 2 is that they compared IDC number and utilzation rate, how do they approve the number they provde are
right. 
Account Recievable explianation makes no sense. they said because of tax change, but before tax change their AR
ramp very fast.  
there are still many red flags and unanswered questions that waiting for the auditor to give the final judgement like all
other Chinese companies got fraud allegations in the past.

Trinity and some others, what do you mean by "illegal"? It only shows you don't understand China, its dynamics and
its reforms. Barely 25 years ago, private ownership of anything, including one's soul was illegal. Strictly speaking, it is
still "illegal" today. Deng Xiaoping's reform help China overcome this illegals. You need to really understand the
situations and reform programs of the China's telecom industry before talking.

simple queston, if it is not illegal, why ViaNet on the blacklist of China Telecom for doing bandwidth reselling.
evidence tells, not just imaginations?

Do your own readings on China telecom sector reform 2001-2011, then you will know. And you use the word
'backlist' , taken from trinity report, you implicitly accept what the report said is true. Again, do your research
on what happened in 2010, what China Telecom did to the telecom sector that year. I can only tell you these
much. The rest are not free.

Chinainsights, have you ever been to China? Did you go to China in June, July? From June, Yahoo, Google,
Onedrive were all suspended because of the June-4 Tiananmen anniversary. Basically, all "sharing" and
email services were either shut down or dramatically slowed down. Google's services are still totally
inaccessible now. And To use Trinity's words, they are illegal! You kind of like that, huh?


16 Sep 2014, 12:42 AM

so u agree there is political risk that Microsoft will be suspended anytime in China. so how client could trust to
put contents on Microsoft cloud anymore in China, if government could suspend Microsoft cloud service
anytime they want. that is big question investors need to seriously think of.  
most of sell-side report talks about the big picture of Microsoft Cloud business in China. have they really think
through this risk and current Microsoft' situation in China.

well, the news said Microsoft cloud service was suspended in the early July. when is Tianan men square
event, June 4th. why Microsoft cloud was suspended in the early July , a month after June 4th, some sort of

China government for Tiananmen Square thing?

While I think it was not a good idea to have the exact pictures as it allows doubt to creep in...the rebuttal by the
Company was pathetic at best.....seriously read over it and then look at the market cap...


16 Sep 2014, 01:52 PM


oyechacho
The rebuttal by the company was such a joke. Basically, it said, everything the shorts said is forged, and for
the real answer just believe what we say not what they say. This stock is going to sit around this level or grind
down is my prediction until their 2014 20-F gets filed with no issues at all whatsoever. The shorts don't have
to be 100% right, they just have to be 1% right for an audit not to go well.


What do you mean about the "exact pictures" by the way? Did I miss something in the rebuttal presentation
by the company?

No I meant that trinity made a clerical error……okay I guess I can believe that….I wish they had newspapers dated
when they took the pictures…but o well…  
I don’t get how these IB bank are giving upgrades when VNET is basically showing more of its hand through the
rebuttal…and its NOT GOOD news even if you believe the company is real.


16 Sep 2014, 04:08 PM


TrinityResearch, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The pictures we took are 100% real and were taken exactly when we said we took them,
during our six months of investigations. The fact that we put the original pictures used to direct our folks
(which we uploaded in error) on this article is precisely why you should believe that. To your point, why would
we do that if we had something to hide which we don't? When we make errors, we will admit to them and
explain them. In this situation, the error was purely clerical, not one of interpretation of evidence. The
evidence, as you can see above, stands irregardless of what the company or its supporters will have you say.
The pictures correspond to the ghost addresses we showed from the SAIC filings.


The fact that the company or the longs are quibbling over whether we actually did or did not take pictures of
their ghost offices is even more damning than anything they said in that weak rebuttal. Expect some words
from us on that soon by the way. Why would the company quibble about pictures if they had more substantial
points to make?


Anyone who reads the rebuttal piece with a careful and skeptical eye will find red flags even in the evidence
they put forth in their rebuttal. For example, why are the SAIC filings for all their MNS acquisitions not
produced? They only showed a few, four or so. Why not all? And why is the profit for those few filings they
showed covered up? What is there to hide?


In the end, their auditors will have to step up and verify everything themselves. With the 2014 fiscal year audit
right around the corner, we expect serious problems for the company, and we will be sure to tell you all about
it as we track that process. We are very interested to see it unfold.


16 Sep 2014, 04:36 PM


Will Vanguard, Contributor
I am not doubting you on the pictures, I actually believe you, however the longs are delusional and will take any
reason to grasp onto hope... an unfortunate error. This Company's response was trivializing more than anything. I
hope to see one of your reports soon. I think a dribble out of more information on your part is beneficial as the 120
page report allowed them to kitchen-sink a long-winded response of nothing.

Trinity - are you still short? If not, can you be accounted for financial terror you unleashed on US investors
who lost money due to your fabrications. Don't tell me somebody who is paying $1.9B to take the company
does not any better than you do.


Groups like you causing so much financial losses to US investors should not be pardoned

@ stockplaza,


No offense, but $23/share sucks. You can continue harping on Trinity all you want. But the stock price
suggests that the broader market thought their allegations had at least some merit. Otherwise it would be

Titan - don't confuse accusations vs. normal business issues. 
VNET has done on par with several China ADRs like YY BABA QIHU BITA BIDU etc.  
None of the China ADRs are trading at China tech valuations, that's driving many to seek re-listings per
bloomberg including BIDU JMEI http://yhoo.it/1G6nlSf


Yes, VNET had some business headwinds, none of which are related to accusations made by this hit and run
author. If the allegations had any truth, the stock price should have done to zero like the author opined and
would not have received a PE offer or Xiaomi investments etc.

From the OPTIONS PUT volume the quick hit and run Trinity seems to be having a follow up report in the next couple
of days (Huge number of November PUTS bought). It seems another "get rich quick" scheme of Trinity is IMMINENT
anytime now. I have HEDGED my positions accordingly.
