FAB Universal's Failure To Disclose 100 Million RMB Debt Adds To
Problems
Nov. 18, 2013 10:15 AM ET7 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Questions regarding the motives of the FAB Universal (NYSEMKT:FU) management team
and the transparency of its Chinese operations first surfaced in back to back Seeking
Alpha articles published on September 26 and October 1 discussing massive dilution
headwinds on the horizon. The dilutive events that could ultimately result in 37.9 million
shares hitting the market arose from the back door RTO transaction that FAB's Chinese
subsidiary used to go public in April 2012.


Next, after an over two-year hiatus since Alfred Little (A*L) published his last report
leading to the delisting of a ChinaHybrid, SinoTech Energy, A*L broke his silence. On
Thursday November 14, 2013, A*L put out a scathing report concluding that FAB
Universal is a fraud. A*L's report went beyond capital structure issues and addressed FU's
operations through intensive on-the-ground research. He found FAB guilty of rampant
piracy, back-end deals with franchisees that guarantee returns, and of inflating its kiosk
count by as much as 10 times. A*L's findings put into question 90% of FAB's kiosk
revenues of $26 million reported for the first nine months of 2013 (see page 28 of the Q3
10-Q). We had opened up an investigation into FU's operations several months ago and
our initial attempt (or should we say inability) to locate FAB kiosks in Beijing leads us to
believe A*L's claim that FAB has grossly exaggerated its kiosk count.


New Evidence of Deception Brought to GeoInvesting's Attention


On Friday, November 15, 2013, a Seeking Alpha contributor, "Unemon1" alerted
GeoInvesting to an undisclosed RMB 100 million ($16.4 million) Chinese bond issuance
by FAB. The implications of this development are significant, especially when one
considers that FAB operates through Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) wherein U.S.
investors have been found historically to have questionable legal claims to assets and
cash flows.


Verification of FAB's undisclosed bond issuances is confirmed by three
independent and authentic sources:


In April 2013, FAB issued RMB 100 million ($16.4 million) of bonds to Chinese investors
through one of its VIE subsidiaries, Beijing Fab Digital Entertainment Products Co., Ltd.
("FAB Digital"), and failed to disclose this debt in its U.S. filings. Page 37 of FAB's 2012

10-K clearly shows that FAB Digital is a subsidiary of FAB. (FAB's corporate structure
diagram is presented later in this report). This bond issuance should have been
reflected in both FAB's second and third quarter 2013 10Q filings, but it was not.


For now, let's take a look at how easy it is to prove FAB's bond offering.


A public announcement regarding the bond offering was posted on August 2, 2013 on
the official website of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
Wind Info, China's leading financial data provider (the Chinese Bloomberg), disclosed
information about the bond offering.
An asset management report shows that a mutual fund sponsored by China's Daton
Securities owns 20,000,000 RMB of the FU bonds.


Independent Verification Number One


A public announcement posted on August 2, 2013 on the official website of the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange clearly stated that 100 million RMB in bonds (collectively, the "12 FAB
Bond") had already been issued by FAB Digital


. The announcement was dated August 1, 2013 (The 12 FAB Bonds were issued on April
25, 2013).


As shown in the screenshot below, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced under item
3 that:


"…


3. Beijing FAB Digital Entertainment Products Co., Ltd 2012 annual Small Medium
Enterprise Private Placement Issuance of Bond, Ticker "118109", the bond's short
name is "


(12 FAB Bond)." The total size of the issuance is RMB 100,000,000 with a coupon
rate of 11.00%. The bond matures in 3 years, with attached option for the issuer to
adjust the coupon rate at the end of 2nd year and the option for the investors to
redeem.

Independent Verification Number Two


Wind Info, China's leading financial data provider (the Chinese Bloomberg), displays the
following information regarding the 12 FAB Bond:


Independent Verification Number Three


A mutual fund sponsored by China's Daton Securities named "Daton Three Stone No. 2
Aggregate Asset Management Plan" reported holding 20,000,000 RMB of the 12 FAB
Bond, according to its 2013 2nd Quarter Asset Management Report dated July 20, 2013,
as shown below:

FAB completely failed to disclose this debt in its financials filed with the SEC.


Below is a screenshot of FAB's consolidated balance sheet taken directly from FAB's Q3
10-Q filed on November 14, 2013:


A simple review of each of FAB's liabilities shows no sign of the $16.4 million FAB Digital
debt.


By failing to disclose this debt, FAB violated many SEC rules including:


Section 17(a) of the Securities Act for making untrue statements of material fact and
engaging in transactions that deceived purchasers of FAB common stock.

FAB's SEC Filings Confirm that Fab Digital Entertainment Products Co., Ltd. is
indeed the FAB Digital that issued the 12 FAB Bonds


As shown in the following organizational chart copied from FAB's 2012 10-K, FAB
conducts its operation in China through a series of contracts (VIE agreements) that
allowed them to consolidate the operations of its two main Variable Interest Entities (VIEs),
Beijing FAB Culture Media Co., Ltd ("FAB Media") and its wholly owned subsidiary, Beijing
FAB Digital Entertainment Products Co., Ltd. ("FAB Digital").


According to page 49 of the 2012 10-K shown below, FAB Digital was incorporated in
September 2003 with registered capital of 1 million RMB.

FAB disclosed in its Definitive Proxy Statement filed on 6/15/12 (link here and excerpted
below), that the legal representative of FAB Digital is Mr. Jiliang Ma, who is also a 40%
owner of FAB Media. Mr. Ma was also the authorized signing representative of FAB Digital
on FAB Universal's various publicly disclosed VIE agreements that enabled FAB's
consolidation of FAB Media and FAB Digital.


"…

The Chinese name of FAB Digital is


, which we confirmed using the Beijing Enterprise Credit Website operated by Beijing
Government's State Administration of Industry and Commerce ("SAIC") (link here and
here). As shown in the screenshots below, FAB Digital


was founded on September 3, 2003 with 1 million RMB registered capital and with Jiliang
Ma serving as its legal representative. FAB Digital's business scope of "distribution and
rental of audio, visual and other media products" described in SAIC records matches FAB
Digital's business description in FAB's 10-K.

Conclusion


In contrast to A*L's allegations, FAB's very obvious failure to disclose $16.4 million in debt
should take very little time for securities regulators and FAB's auditor (Friedman LLP) to
confirm. In fact, this should take Friedman, CEO Chris Spencer, CFO John Busshaus, the
NYSE, SEC, or even Jim Rodgers all of 20 minutes or at most one day, being generous,
to confirm this.


FAB indicated on Friday November 15, 2013 that they would respond to the A*L report in
short order. At this point, FAB's U.S. management should proactively halt their own stock
to protect investors and commence an independent investigation to carefully check these
very serious allegations.


Disclosure: I am short FU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

FAB has no way out of this. Complete failure to disclose a highly material debt issuance. The cash on FAB's books
can no longer be trusted. Last two 10-Q's have to be withdrawn. Stock should be halted and delisted.

I'm surprised this hasn't gotten more attention...if FU really didn't disclose their bond offering the stock will crash. And
when you consider the other accusations that they are selling pirated material it makes me really surprised the stock

Jim Rogers bought some shares (10.000). It seems logical because he is part of the board of directors. So I guess he
wants to give a signal. If he was more positive he would not buy 10.000 shares but 1 million.

Amazing what some quick google searches turn up...


On FAB Universal's Director Doug Polinsky:


"...Douglas M. Polinsky, previously served as CEO of a gambling-machine company that made headlines years ago
because of its suspected ties to the Mob. " 
http://bit.ly/1aDVbkS


"As for Polinsky, he was once CEO of International Gaming Management, a publicly traded distributor of gambling
machines. His father, Jerrold, controlled the company and in 1997 was charged with crimes, including fraud.
