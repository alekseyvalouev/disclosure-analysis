Our full 27-page report on Montage Technology Group Ltd. along with its two appendices
can be found here.


Montage Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MONT) is a Chinese fabless (short for
fabrication-less) semiconductor company focused on the set-top box chip market. We
believe that Montage Technology Group Ltd. ("MONT") is grossly overstating its
revenue, and that MONT's actual revenue is significantly lower than MONT has
reported to investors due to overwhelming evidence that MONT's largest distributor
is nothing more than a shell company used to help fabricate MONT's financials.
LQW Technology Company Limited ("LQW"), a Hong Kong entity which MONT claims
accounted for 71% of its revenue in the first 9M of 2013 (up from 50% in 2012), is
secretly 100% owned by Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Technology Co. Ltd.
("SMMT"), an undisclosed entity established by MONT and a MONT employee. Our
evidence includes the following:


1) Chinese corporate filings showing that LQW (the distributor accounting for 71%
of MONT's reported 2013 revenue) is owned by SMMT, an entity established by
MONT and a senior MONT employee


2) LQW filings and registration/passport information showing that one of the two
directors of LQW provided a false residential address that actually belongs to
Phoebe Su, the VP of Finance and Administration at MONT


3) Photographic evidence from visiting the registered office of LQW showing that
the "office" is actually nothing more than a small, 1,000-1,500 ft  warehouse room.
We visited on a recent weekday afternoon, and it was padlocked. A security guard
working at the building stated that LQW had moved into its room a few months ago,
but that he had never seen anyone from LQW entering or exiting the premises


4) Documentation showing that the current registered office of SMMT doesn't even
exist


5) A recorded conversation with an officer/shareholder of SMMT where she denied
selling set-top box chips (MONT's bread and butter), refused to meet in person, and
insisted on conducting future correspondence through text messages rather than

Introduction


LQW was founded by Anthony Ho (an ex-employee of MONT CEO Howard Yang at
Newave Semiconductor) in October 2011 (the exact same month MONT claims to have
started doing business with it ), and 100% ownership of LQW was transferred over to
SMMT on February 2, 2012-less than four months after it incorporated.  SMMT was
formed by MONT and a senior employee at MONT (Lei "Larry" Wu/吴雷). Wu and MONT's
VP of Finance and Administration (Lin "Phoebe" Su) were appointed to the roles of
general manager/executive director/legal representative and auditor of SMMT,
respectively.  Every single job posting for MONT that we came across that listed MONT's
subsidiaries included SMMT as one of them.  This includes the corporate description
attached to jobs posted as recently as January 10, 2014.  SMMT has had two registered
offices, both of which were down/across the hall (same floor of the same building) from
offices registered to MONT.  Other sources, including a recorded interview with an
employee of MONT and published articles, refer to SMMT either as part of MONT or
interchangeably with MONT.


As of today (February 6, 2014), the registered address of SMMT is Room 303-30, Building
33, 680 Guiping Rd., Shanghai.  We tried to visit the purported office. Room 303-30 does
not exist and SMMT had no office anywhere on the floor or in the building. Below is
the building directory for the third floor of Building 33, 680 Guiping Rd., Shanghai:

There are only five separate offices located on the floor, none of which belong to SMMT
and none of which are number 303-30. We also asked staff at other offices on the floor,
and they claimed to have never heard of SMMT.


We also visited LQW. LQW's registered "office" is actually nothing more than a small
warehouse room that we estimate to be between 1,000 and 1,500 square feet. We
visited the registered address of LQW on a recent weekday afternoon, where we found
LQW's door padlocked and did not see any employees. A security guard working at the
building during the day said that LQW had moved into its room a few months ago,
but that he had never seen anyone from LQW entering or exiting the premises. See
below for pictures of the front entrance of the registered "office" of MONT's largest
distributor:

Prior to MONT going public, ownership of SMMT was transferred from Larry Wu and
MONT to two women, Zhu Yan (朱焱, received 60% of SMMT) and Chen Yueci (陳悅慈,
received 40% of SMMT). SMMT also changed its legal representative from Larry Wu to
Zhu Yan. Zhu Yan is also legal representative for a Shanghai subsidiary of a Hong Kong
entity controlled by the parents of MONT President Stephen Tai. During a recorded phone
call with Zhu Yan on January 15, 2014, she claimed that she was not in the office and
would not be working for the next few weeks since she was not feeling well and Chinese
New Year (which was weeks away at the time of the call) was coming up. During the call,
we inquired about obtaining price quotes for set-top box chips (MONT's bread and
butter), and Zhu Yan appeared to be uncomfortable. She claimed that she was not
selling such products, stated that she only had a small relationship with MONT (a
strange comment for the legal representative and 60% owner of the parent company
of LQW, MONT's largest distributor), and insisted that we continue future
correspondence through text messages rather than calls. We believe that Zhu Yan is
a front for MONT.


Following its acquisition of LQW, SMMT appointed two directors at LQW: Chen Yueci (陳
悅慈) and Zhu Dexiu (諸德秀). We found that LQW's Hong Kong filings include a false
Shanghai mailing address for Zhu Dexiu. The address listed in LQW's corporate
filings for LQW director Zhu Dexiu actually belongs to Phoebe Su-the VP of Finance

and Administration at MONT!  According to her passport and registration record, Zhu
Dexiu doesn't even live in Shanghai-she lives in Anhui. We believe Zhu Dexiu is also a
front for MONT.


Though MONT failed to disclose this in its prospectus, SMMT was accused by SARFT (a
Chinese government agency) in March 2010 of selling illegal chips with receivers set to
allow the owner to receive free signals from Chinese satellites, who would otherwise have
to pay monthly fees for cable. ,  The satellite signals were intended for rural locations
that were too remote to access television signals via cable, however, many set-top boxes
were being illegally sold to urban residents. According to an article published on
tech.163.com (part of NetEase), the cost of buying a satellite set-top box using such chips
was approximately the same as the cost of six months of paying for cable.  We believe
that the actions of SARFT against SMMT caused MONT to effectively fold all real
operations at SMMT and, along with deteriorating financials, drove the decision to
use that entity to facilitate financial shenanigans.


Based on the evidence we have uncovered, we believe MONT is producing
significantly less revenue than it claims and is likely not profitable. We are shocked
that investors have purchased MONT equity without forcing the company to address the
fact that the vast majority of MONT's reported revenue is coming from a recently-formed
entity with no public website and no discernible business relationships with any entities
besides MONT.


Background of SMMT


MONT claims in its S-1 filing that LQW made up 50% of its 2012 revenue and 71% of its
revenue in the 9 months ending September 30, 2013. This is how the relationship is
portrayed by MONT:

However, as we will show, LQW is owned by SMMT. SMMT, in turn, was established by
one of MONT's Shanghai subsidiaries and a MONT employee. See below:


Below is the document for SMMT showing its initial capital structure:

MONT eventually changed the ownership of SMMT to two women, Chen Yueci (陳悅慈)
and Zhu Yan (朱焱), with Zhu Yan appointed as legal representative. We believe that
these two women are shills, and the intent of the ownership change was to try to make it
seem as though SMMT is not related to MONT. Zhu Yan is also the registered legal
representative of Yunduan Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (筠端科技(上海)有限公司,
"Yunduan Shanghai"), which is a subsidiary of Yunduan Media Company Ltd. ("Yunduan

HK"), a Hong Kong-based entity that lists Stephen Tai's (the president of MONT) parents
as its only directors. See below for a visual representation of the relationships between the
parties and MONT:


There are a couple other items worth noting. First, LQW, Montage Semiconductor Hong
Kong Company Ltd., Montage Technology Hong Kong Co. Ltd., Montage Technology Co.
Ltd., and Yunduan Media Company Ltd. all used the exact same law office: C.K. Mok &
Co. We were unable to find any company-owned website for C.K. Mok & Co., and online
sources indicate that it is a very small practice (<10 lawyers).


Second, many of the registered addresses for the entities listed above were either
identical or within the same hall:


1. SMMT's original registered address was:


Room 402, 4th floor, Building 32, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai


Montage Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. has used the address:


Room 406A, 4th floor, Building 32, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai


Yunduan Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. has the exact same address:


Room 406A, 4th floor, Building 32, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai


2. SMMT later changed its registered address to:

Room 303-30, Building 33, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai, China


This happened around the same time that Montage Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
changed its address to:


Room 303-27, Building 33, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai, China


Note that the picture in the Introduction to this report shows that neither of those
addresses exist anyways.


3. Yunduan Media Company Ltd. has the following registered address in Hong Kong:


Room 8, 4th Floor, King Commercial Building, Nos. 2-4 Chatham Court, Kowloon,
HK


Montage Technology Co. Ltd., Montage Technology Hong Kong Co. Ltd., and Montage
Semiconductor Hong Kong Co. Ltd. also used the exact same room as a registered
address:


Room 8, 4th Floor, King Commercial Building, Nos. 2-4 Chatham Court, Kowloon,
HK


LQW was Acquired by SMMT Less than Four Months After Incorporating


LQW was incorporated by Yat Hing Anthony Ho in Hong Kong on October 20, 2011. LQW
has no public website, and we were unable to find any mention of other business
relationships it may have. The below excerpt from LQW's Memorandum and Articles of
Association for LQW show that when it was formed, only one share was issued and it was
issued to Anthony Ho (for LQW's full Memorandum and Articles of Association and other
relevant LQW documents, see Appendix to MONT Initiating Coverage Report - LQW
Corporate Filings on gravityresearchgroup.com):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1999841-is-montage-technology-still-fabless-if-it-is-fabricating-its-revenue 10/39


Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Technology Co. Ltd. (SMMT) acquired the single
share of LQW (which represented a 100% interest) from Anthony Ho on February 2, 2012.
See below for the relevant excerpt from the Hong Kong Annual Return filed by LQW with
the Hong Kong Companies Registry in October 2012:

"上海瀾起微電子科技有限公司" refers to SMMT despite what the English translation says.
The characters "瀾起" are pronounced as "lanqi" as indicated in the translation shown in
excerpt shown above, but actually translate to "montage" in English! For example, if you
look at the emblem on the top left corner of the MONT corporate website with the
language set to Chinese, it shows the following logo:


The characters shown in the above logo mean "montage," and match the third and fourth
characters in the sequence "上海瀾起微電子科技有限公司." Please note that the
characters "瀾" and "澜" are interchangeable in Mandarin-the first represents the

"traditional" method of writing the character while the second represents the "simplified"
way of writing it. This excerpt above showing the share transfer was part of the Annual
Return filed with the Hong Kong Companies Registry on October 20, 2012-since the share
transfer was in February 2012, the "current holding" space for Anthony Ho is left blank due
to the fact that he no longer owns an interest in the firm, while the current holding for
SMMT now includes the share that was transferred to the firm from Anthony Ho. The
transfer of ownership to SMMT is a serious cause of concern for investors because we
believe that SMMT is effectively controlled by MONT and our site visit to LQW's registered
address suggests that it may not actually have any operations. Additional evidence to this
point includes:


1. The address in the Hong Kong filings for LQW show that the residential address of Zhu
Dexiu (a director at LQW) is Room 2103, Block 2, No. 88 Si Nan Road, Shanghai:

However, that is not Zhu Dexiu's address-- that is the address of Phoebe Su, the VP of
Finance and Administration at MONT! See below for Lin "Phoebe" Su's ID card taken from
MONT's Chinese corporate filings:


Below is Phoebe Su's personal information from her passport/registration records in an
easier-to-view format:


According to her passport and registration record, Zhu Dexiu doesn't even live in
Shanghai; she lives in a village in Anhui! See below:

2. Contact information posted online for SMMT includes a phone number (+86 (021) 5169-
6833) that goes directly to MONT's phone system, and the Chairman/contact person listed
is Wu Lei, who is a pre-IPO shareholder and employee of MONT. , , ,


Wu Lei is also a Series A and Series B-2 investor in MONT per the S-1 filed on 8/21/2013,
and is named on patents awarded to MONT.  We believe MONT made an intentional
error when writing the section describing the related parties signing the Investor Rights
Agreement who were insiders. See below excerpt (emphasis added):


"In connection with our private placement of Series B-2 preferred shares in October
2009, we and our shareholders entered into an Investor Rights Agreement ("IRA").
The following parties to the IRA are our related parties: Howard C. Yang, Stephen
Tai, Jung-Kung (Jackie) Yang, Xunren Yang, Shuzhuang Liang, Kuai Lap Tai, Iong
Wa Chao and Absolute Pioneer Co., Ltd., being our directors, immediate family
members of our directors or entities controlled by our director; Shawn Si, Kenneth
Chew, Jack Gu, Phoebe Su, Liang Wu, Shung Ho Shaw, Alan Tzi-Hong Yiu and
Pannyun Yiu, being our officers or immediate family members of our officers; and
AsiaVest Opportunities Fund IV and Intel Capital (Cayman) Corporation, being our
principal shareholders."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1999841-is-montage-technology-still-fabless-if-it-is-fabricating-its-revenue 15/39


However, in reviewing the signatures of the IRA, we found that there was no one named
Liang Wu signing the IRA. There was, however, a signer named Lei Wu. We believe the
mistake in writing Liang Wu in the section listing officers was an error intended to help
mask the fact that Lei Wu is an insider. In its most recent S-1/A filed on January 27, 2014,
"Liang Wu" shows up again-this time listed as a selling shareholder even though there is
no Liang Wu on the list of pre-IPO investors!  In a different part of the S-1, an employee
"Larry Wu" was named as a "key shareholder" prior to the IPO along with the CEO of
MONT, the CFO of MONT, and another employee (Shawn Si).  Given that Lei Wu is the
only shareholder with the surname "Wu" listed in the schedule identifying shareholders
and insiders, it is clear that Lei Wu's western name is "Larry." We confirmed this through a
MONT patent showing that Lei Wu's American name is Larry.  His LinkedIn profile shows
that he is Engineering Director at MONT.  Below is his information, retrieved from his
registration records:


3. In every job posting we came across for MONT where MONT listed its subsidiaries,
MONT lists SMMT as one of its subsidiaries. It is listed alongside the other Shanghai
subsidiaries-so there is no question of simply miswriting the names. , , , ,  Below is
an example of the text we would find:

"Montage Technology Group Ltd. (Montage Technology) was founded in May 2004,
with four subsidiaries and one branch, namely: Montage Technology (Shanghai) Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Co., Montage Semiconductor
(Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Suzhou Montage Microelectronics Technology Co., Ltd., and
Montage Technology Hangzhou branch, with additional offices South Korea and the
United States. Montage employs nearly 400 people."


It is true that the Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Co. is not the exact name of LQW's
parent company-it is Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Technology Co. Ltd. However,
searching the database of registered Shanghai companies, we found that there is no
entity that begins with "Shanghai Montage Microelectronics" (上海澜起微电子) other than
SMMT.  Therefore, it is clear that the entity MONT is referring to in its job postings is in
fact SMMT.


1. In an announcement by the State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C., SMMT is
listed as the new holder of a layout design patent that was applied for on October 10,
2011-the same application date as three other design patents awarded to Montage
Technology (Shanghai) Co. in the same announcement!  This notice also re-confirms
that at the time of the announcement (February 6, 2012), the addresses of Montage
Technology (Shanghai) Co. and SMMT were within the same hall (room 406 and room
402 of building #32, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai, respectively)


2. In a March 2010 government decree from the Chinese government, SMMT was listed
as among companies accused of producing illegal satellite channel demodulator chips.
See the decree here and the list of companies and banned products.


3. In a March 2010 televised interview between a reporter and Gu Jie (顾杰, a MONT
employee) regarding MONT's history and its prospects going forward, the reporter
inquires about Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Technology Co. Ltd., and Gu
responds to him as though SMMT is the same entity as MONT. For instance, he calls it
"Montage Technology" (the commonly abbreviated name for MONT's publicly
disclosed Shanghai subsidiary, Montage Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.) and claims it
was formed in 2004 (Montage Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. was formed in 2004-
SMMT was formed in 2008).  There are other articles referencing the same interview-
here is one link.


LQW's founder and general manager, Anthony Ho, was previously "Director of sales Asia
Pacific" for Newave Semiconductor Corp. from December 1999 through September 2001
and held similar positions at National Semiconductor and Marvell Semiconductor per his
LinkedIn account:

Newave Semiconductor Corporation was a firm started by the CEO of MONT in 1997:


"In 1997, Dr. Yang co-founded Newave Semiconductor Corp., an integrated circuit
design company located in China."


Additionally, both Yang and Ho worked at National Semiconductor prior to the founding of
Newave, and Ho, along with the President Stephen Tai and at least two other senior
employees at MONT were employed by Marvell Semiconductor at the same time as
Anthony Ho.


MONT's Ever-Changing Revenue Figures


There are many inconsistencies among the revenue figures within MONT's filings and the
revenue figures Management has provided to analysts. We compared numbers between
analyst reports, an investor presentation, and MONT's SEC filings. No two independent

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1999841-is-montage-technology-still-fabless-if-it-is-fabricating-its-revenue 18/39


sources provided perfectly matching figures-in fact, even different pages within the same
SEC filing yielded conflicting figures! We believe this type of discrepancy is symptomatic
of fraud.


For instance, page 17 of the S-1 filed on 8/21/2013 reads as follows:


"We have sold a substantial majority of our set-top box solutions to end customers
through three independent distributors, LQW Technology Company Limited, Qinuo
International Co., Ltd. and China Electronic Appliance Shenzhen Co., Ltd. Sales
through these three distributors accounted for 50%, 18% and 9%, respectively,
of our total revenue in 2012 and 67%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of our total
revenue in the six months ended June 30, 2013."


On page F-11 of the same filing, MONT provides the following table depicting the
percentages of revenue for its largest customers:


Matching up the revenue numbers for CY 2012 in the table above with the figures from the
excerpt on p. 17 of the S-1, we can determine that Company A is China Electronic
Appliance Shenzhen Co., Ltd. ("CEAC"), Company C is Qinuo International Co., Ltd., and
Company D is LQW Technology Company Limited. However, after substituting for the
actual company names, none of the revenue percent figures for 2013 match between the
table on F-11 and the figures on p. 17! See table below:


We found similar inconsistencies when comparing the revenue by distributor from MONT's
S-1 filing with the figures provided in analyst reports, which we believe came directly from
MONT Management. See below for a chart from one analyst report that matched the
figures provided by other analysts:

These figures are consistent with the figures provided by other analysts, and presumably
were obtained from Management. However, the revenue from distributors is different
between the analyst reports and the MONT S-1. While the difference may seem small in
terms of percent of revenue, the difference in revenue attributed to CEAC for 2012 is 80%:


In yet another set of figures taken from a November 2013 investor presentation, MONT
claims that ILDO was 9% of 2012 revenue, which conflicts with the 7% attributed to ILDO
in the analyst report and with the total lack of mention of ILDO in MONT's S-1:

The slip-ups continue throughout MONT's prospectus. On page 84 of its prospectus dated
September 25, 2013, MONT claims that 82% of its total revenue is sales through
distributors:


"Sales through our distributors accounted for 82% of our total revenue in 2012."


This is consistent with the tables within the prospectus depicting Companies A/B/C/D- in
total, those four distributors made up 82% of MONT's 2012 revenue according to the table
on F-12 of the September 25, 2013 prospectus. However, there are two problems with
this. First, according to the pie charts in the analyst reports, MONT purportedly has at
least six distributors (so two other distributors on top of Companies A/B/C/D), and
distributors make up at least 88% of MONT's total revenue (the sum of the directly
attributed revenue from the pie chart above). Second, on page F-24 of the same
prospectus, MONT provides a table showing that revenue generated through sales
directly to end customers was $12.2mm, or 16% of total revenue:


This doesn't balance with the 82% distributor revenue share from the prior statement on p.
84 of the September 25, 2013 prospectus or with the figures provided to the analysts
covering the company which attribute 11% (or potentially even less) of the total 2012
revenue to direct sales (see "other" segment of the pie chart). Alone, it is possible that a

genuine company could make one of these mistakes on accident. In aggregate, however,
we believe that the volume of slip-ups by MONT is frequently symptomatic of falsified
accounting and fraud.


LQW Distribution Arrangement


We find the distribution agreement to be very strange and suspicious. To begin with, the
distribution agreement is exceptionally short and basic for a distributor that is selling
$50mm+ worth of revenue. Second, the agreement is dated January 15, 2013 and
backdated to begin on January 1, 2013- after MONT reported that LQW was 50% of its
revenue in 2012. If LQW had a prior distribution agreement with MONT, it should have
started in 2011-when MONT claims to have begun its business relationship with LQW. If
the agreement changed in 2013, MONT would have presented an amended agreement in
its SEC filing, or at the very least would have made some reference to a prior arrangement
between the two companies. Finally, Article 1 of the distribution agreement appoints LQW
as "exclusive global distributor" of "the Product," which MONT refused to disclose. This is
interesting because in the appendix to the agreement, LQW provides a list of four other
(censored) distributors for "the Product" and in its S-1 filing, MONT states that distribution
agreements are typically for defined customer bases and/or geographic areas:


"We typically enter into distribution agreements with our distributors, with each
distributor covering a defined customer base and/or geographic area."


We have reproduced the agreement below for review:

Summary of Facts


Below is a summary of the critical facts that support our thesis. The sources are provided
within this report, however, we have also uploaded a more detailed 35-page document to
www.gravityresearchgroup.com/reports (Appendix to MONT Initiating Coverage Report -
Sources of Facts) with the sources for each of these facts provided in identical numeric
order, and encourage readers to review it in conjunction with this report. We have also
uploaded a separate appendix (Appendix to MONT Initiating Coverage Report - LQW
Corporate Filings) with full corporate filings for LQW that investors may use to verify
excerpts provided within this report and the other appendix to this report.


1. According to MONT, LQW comprised 50% of MONT's 2012 purported revenue
($39.1mm) and 71% of MONT's purported revenue in the first 9M of 2013 ($53.6mm)12

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1999841-is-montage-technology-still-fabless-if-it-is-fabricating-its-revenue 24/39


2. In 2010, before MONT began to use LQW as a distributor, MONT reported 26.9%
gross margins and -28.5% net margins. In 2011, after adding on LQW as a distributor,
MONT reported 73% revenue growth, gross margins that were twice as high as 2010
and net margins of positive 15.8%


3. LQW was incorporated in October 2011, the exact same month MONT claims to have
started doing business with it.


4. LQW was established by a former senior employee of the CEO of MONT
5. LQW is currently 100% owned by Shanghai Montage Microelectronics Technology


Company Limited ("SMMT") and was acquired by SMMT within 4 months of
incorporating


6. LQW's registered "office" is actually nothing more than a small warehouse room that
we estimate to be between 1,000 and 1,500 square feet. We visited the registered
address of LQW on a recent weekday afternoon, where we found LQW's door
padlocked and did not see any employees. See the Introduction section of this report
for photographs. A security guard working at the building during the day said that LQW
had moved into its room a few months ago, but that he had never seen anyone from
LQW entering or exiting the premises.


7. LQW uses the exact same small law office (C.K. Mok & Co.) as all three of MONT's
Hong Kong subsidiaries (Montage Semiconductor Hong Kong Company Ltd., Montage
Technology Hong Kong Co. Ltd., and Montage Technology Co. Ltd). We were unable
to find any company-owned website for C.K. Mok & Co., and online sources indicate
that it is a very small practice (<10 lawyers). We find this highly unlikely to be a mere
coincidence given that there are hundreds of law offices doing business in Hong Kong


8. After LQW was acquired by SMMT, Zhu Dexiu (諸德秀) was appointed as a director of
LQW. The address in the Hong Kong filing for LQW shows that Zhu Dexiu's residential
address is Room 2103, Block 2, No. 88 Si Nan Road, Shanghai. However, that is not
Zhu Dexiu's actual address-- that is the address of Phoebe Su, the VP of Finance and
Administration at MONT! According to her passport and registration record, Zhu Dexiu
doesn't even live in Shanghai; she lives in a village in Hefei! We believe Zhu Dexiu is
being used as a front for MONT


9. SMMT was formed as a joint venture between MONT and a senior employee at MONT
(Wu Lei/Larry Wu/吴雷). 90% of the registered capital for SMMT came from Larry Wu
(who is a senior employee and shareholder of MONT), and 10% of the registered
capital came from MONT's Montage Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. subsidiary


10. Larry Wu was also appointed as legal representative, executive director, and general
manager of SMMT

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1999841-is-montage-technology-still-fabless-if-it-is-fabricating-its-revenue 25/39


11. Larry Wu is still currently listed as the contact person for SMMT on multiple
websites , , ,


12. The phone number posted online for SMMT (+86 021-51696833) is the same as the
phone number posted for MONT. We called it to see what would happen-it goes
directly to MONT's interactive voice response system!


13. The original address of SMMT is listed as Room 402, 4th floor, Building 32, 680
Guiping Road. This is across the hall from an address of MONT (Building 32, Room
406-A, 680 Guiping Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai). Later, SMMT's registered address
changed to Room 303-30, Block 33, 680 Guiping Road, Shanghai-this is nearly the
same as another address purportedly held by MONT (Room 303-27, Building 33, 680
Guiping Road, Shanghai)


14. As of today (February 6, 2014), the registered address of SMMT is Room 303-30,
Building 33, 680 Guiping Rd., Shanghai. We tried to visit the purported office. Room
303-30 does not exist and SMMT had no office anywhere on the floor or in the
building. See Introduction for relevant pictures


15. The Vice President of Finance and Administration at MONT (Su Lin/Phoebe Su/苏琳),
was appointed as the initial auditor of SMMT


16. In every job posting we came across for MONT where MONT listed its subsidiaries,
MONT lists SMMT as one of its subsidiaries. It is listed alongside the other Shanghai
subsidiaries-so there is no question of simply miswriting the names


17. According to a recent filing, ownership of SMMT was transferred to Zhu Yan (朱焱,
received 60% ownership) and Chen Yueci (陳悅慈, received 40% ownership). We
believe this was done to make it more difficult for investors to link MONT with LQW in
advance of the MONT IPO


18. The current legal representative of SMMT is listed as Zhu Yan
19. Zhu Yan is also the legal representative of Yunduan Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.


("Yunduan"), which is owned by Yunduan Media Company Ltd (a Hong Kong entity),
which is controlled by the parents of Stephen Tai (President of MONT). A website
listing contact information for Yunduan  shows that Yunduan's address is the exact
same address (down to the room letter) that previously belonged to MONT


20. During a recorded phone call with Zhu Yan on January 15, 2014, she claimed that she
was not in the office and would not be working for the next few weeks since she was
not feeling well and Chinese New Year (which was weeks away at the time of the call)
was coming up. During the call, we inquired about obtaining price quotes for set-top
box chips (MONT's bread and butter), and Zhu Yan appeared to be uncomfortable and
claimed that she was not selling such products. She stated that she only had a small
relationship with MONT (a strange comment for the legal representative and 60%

continue future correspondence through text messages rather than calls. We believe
that Zhu Yan is a front for MONT


Closing Thoughts


In 2012, MONT's revenue was in decline for all of its distributors except for LQW, which
was mysteriously experiencing massive growth:


The trend has continued in 2013 (excluding a $690,000 increase in revenue from China
Electronic Appliance), with revenue from LQW nearly tripling, with the decline even
extending to reported direct sales despite the uptick in reported memory buffer revenue,
which we believe would more likely be from direct sales rather than through distributors:


Below are revenue figures for MONT broken out by distributor for all available periods.
Again, the revenue for distributors other than LQW is in decline, while the LQW revenue is
increasing rapidly:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1999841-is-montage-technology-still-fabless-if-it-is-fabricating-its-revenue 27/39


This decline is especially poignant in light of the fact that MONT's distribution agreements
grant each distributor a specific territory or customer base, meaning that LQW could not
have taken business from other distributors:


"We typically enter into distribution agreements with our distributors, with each
distributor covering a defined customer base and/or geographic area."


We believe that the decline in revenue from agreements with companies such as Qinuo
and CEAC provides a more realistic view into the actual condition of MONT's business.
The STB industry is extremely competitive, and even the most dominant player in
emerging market STB chips is reporting margins well-below the figures MONT is
reporting:


We do not believe that MONT's claimed revenue is real, and we do not believe that MONT
has sufficient scale to be genuinely profitable. We also believe that MONT's business
began deteriorating in the past and continued deteriorating to the point at which
Management elected to invent LQW and go public on the US market.


A common modus operandi of alleged Chinese frauds has been to hire CFOs from North
America who do not speak Chinese or have significant experience doing business in
China. These include Duoyuan Global Water, Duoyuan Printing, Longtop Financial
Technologies, Sino-Forest, and others. We believe that MONT CFO Mark Voll has been

the inside. We rate the stock a strong sell, and we believe that its auditor will resign and
that SEC action is imminent.

Gravity Research's website was only created July of last year, and they use an anonymous domain registration. A
check on http://bit.ly/LCp6ld and a trace route shows that they use a server in Sweden. If you look at the results of
their previous reports (of which there are only two), they are a mixed bag. Just as you should be cautious of this
company, so should you be cautious of short sellers using "research". Good luck to you all!

Gravity Research looks like Citron Research which came up with shorting thesis on VJET couple of months ago. No
legitimacy, suddenly springs up one day on all social media (twitter, SA, etc) and tries to prove the point. I would be
happy if they can provide their contact and address details on their website instead of complete anonymity which
raises doubt they're in collusion with some SS and just want to pull the stock down. The two other stocks which
they've posted research reports on in the past (Avanir, Raptor) were the ones which were were hot momentum stocks.
Maybe their stratagem is to pick a stock which has surged very high in recent times, and initiated a short coverage on
it. SEC please investigate!

No leap of faith in Gravity Research is required. Whether you trust them or not, the 37 citations listed at the bottom
are independently verifiable. Ignore the analyst, and draw your own conclusions from the sources supplied.


My guess is that Gravity Research maintains their anonymity simply because they cannot afford the legal battles
normally resulting from publishing such analysis.

Brilliant article. Thank you for sharing. More than 24 hours have elapsed since this piece got published on the web
and there is still no evidence that LQW actually sells anything in the real world. Our gut feeling on this one is delisting.
The longer it takes for anyone to come up with a credible defense makes it less likely that any credible defense is
going to come.

It should trade at $6 even without any fraud


If the fraud is real, it will go to $1

Moreover on Jan 31, MONT priced its follow-on public offering of 5,350,000 ordinary shares. Of these,
4,350,000 ordinary shares were sold by certain selling shareholders. In addition, the selling shareholders
have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 802,500 ordinary shares. 
In other words, Insiders are dumping hard and want to sell even more.

Who will buy the shares?


08 Feb 2014, 11:51 AM

jsIRA, 10 million shares changed hands over the last two days. Apparently, someone is still buying.


08 Feb 2014, 05:29 PM 


Kevin Porter
Owen yes, there will be buyers at $10


then at $5 and at $1 too

Just one curious dump question: why the stupid INTEL owns 6.4% of MONT? No wonder INTC stock never took off.


09 Feb 2014, 01:19 AM 


Owen
Where do you see Intel (INTC) owning 6.4% of MONT?


09 Feb 2014, 09:15 AM 


Kevin Porter
ksu, lol really ridicolous


longs are really desperate if they need to come out with this stuff

Kevin:


If you go to Yahoo, financial and MONT site, take the look of ownership and then major holders, the first is
INTEL: Intel Corporation 1,695,666 6.40 27,656,312 Dec 31, 2013. It is not ridiculous (not redicolous like you
wrote) at all.


15 Feb 2014, 09:31 AM 


loufah
when you says "INTC stock never took off", can you define "never" and "took off", because looking at a chart,
I don't see how what you're saying is true.


16 Feb 2014, 02:31 PM 


ksu
If you take a look of INTC's stock chart, April 2010, it was $24 and now, it is still $24. Very poor performance,
right?


16 Feb 2014, 02:38 PM 


Owen
Right, and that's all because this $120 Billion company owns $27 million of MONT. Got it.


If MONT drops to zero, this $27M loss translates to a $0.005 per INTC share, but sure, that explains
everything.


Genius.


16 Feb 2014, 02:53 PM 


Kevin Porter
@ ksu  
a 123B company owning $27M of a small company means nothing, that's what is ridicolous


Nymex owned an even bigger stake in OPBL and OPBL was a fraud anyway


18 Feb 2014, 08:21 AM 


loufah
"If you take a look of INTC's stock chart, April 2010, it was $24 and now, it is still $24. " That's a strange
definition of "Never", but thanks for answering.

MONT 
I also urge longs to read MONT SEC filings. 
From the latest 10Q filed Nov 12, 2013 
1) We are a company registered in the Cayman Islands. 
A set-top box company registered in the Cayman Islands ? 
This casts a lot of doubts 
2) For the 3 months and 9 months ended September 30, 2013, we generated 91% and 91% of our revenue from
sales of set-top box solutions. 
Pace plc (PCMXF or PIC.L in London) is the #1 seller of set-top boxes by number of units shipped in the world and
has an Operating Margin of only 5.38% (Trailing Twelve Months). Yet MONT is able to report an operating margin of
22% (Trailing Twelve Months). Doubts.


09 Feb 2014, 03:30 PM 


loufah
I imagine ARM has higher margins than the companies that fabricate their designs, too.


10 Feb 2014, 06:01 AM 


Kevin Porter
PCMXF has 5% operating margin 
ARRS has 4% operating margin 
and both trade at very low price/sales


Using the same metrics, MONT should trade at about $5 even without any fraud


If the fraud is real, it will go to $1


10 Feb 2014, 08:14 AM 


dchobo
Lots of companies are registered in Cayman. Pace and Arris are equipment vendors. MONT is a chip vendor.

Seriously, dchobo, don't waste your time on this joker. His agenda doesn't involve fact-checking.


10 Feb 2014, 09:03 PM 


Kevin Porter
dchobo 
1) true about the Cayman but that doesn't mean the numbers are exactly reliable ... 
2) so you have a chip vendor making much more than equipment vendors, is that logic ?  
Owen enough of your personal attacks, or you'll get sued believe me


11 Feb 2014, 11:59 AM

Kevin, what's your opinion about today's buyout offer?


10 Mar 2014, 10:36 AM 


Kevin Porter
A company hiring a third party to review a possible major fraud and in the meanwhile receiving a buyout offer
? 
one of the funniest stock ever

"This casts a lot of doubts" - No, it doesn't. Most Chinese cross-listed companies do it using the same or similar
ownership structure. Educate yourself on how Chinese ADRs are set up before generating bogus scuttlebutt.

another BS from WS...about to buy the dips...watch it, the stock price will bounce back pretty soon. When I see these
crooks (Holzer & Holzer, Pomerantz, Howard Smith, The Rosen Law) file a lawsuit against companies, I'm quite sure
it's all non-sense. Those so called law firms filed a lawsuit against Tesla as well, and guess what happened?

The gravity research, it'll not appear any more. Its existing is just to poison MONT along a lunch of shorties and
benefited from the price drop of MONT. This "faked" business is going to be bought out at $21 or more. I think most of
these shorts has bought back, if not, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

A comment few minutes ago by 'Aristides Capital'


Mark Voll MONT CFO did indeed say "Our other distributors don't have websites either." Mark Voll is either lying or
embarrassingly clueless. Here's the website for China Electronic Appliance Shenzhen Co., Ltd. http://bit.ly/1h751xo  
Here is the website for Qinuo International Co Ltd: http://www.qinuo.com.cn 
LQW is MONT's only distributor without a website.  
In addition to having cool websites, both businesses are also linked to extensively on Chinese business directories;
LQW seems strangely absent from this thing called the Internet.


MONT has given no credible defense whatsoever on LQW to date.

yes the situation is more suspicious than ever


10 Mar 2014, 02:13 PM 


Jonas500_
yes !!


20.75 is an excellent price to sell or short


10 Mar 2014, 03:00 PM 


ksu
If you really to short, 21+ will be a good entry unless there is other white knight(s) to come in. The most you
can lose is ~$0.50 and if the buyout is not true, well, you'll get a lot of money back.


11 Mar 2014, 10:59 AM 


Jonas500_
Well yes


If LQW is fake as it seems, you get 100% or almost 100% while risking only 2-3%

A link to the 2nd Gravity report replying to MONT.

RDA is another fabless company in China. 
RDA trades at 2.0x sales and has an operating margin and a profit margin of about 11.5%


MONT trades at 4.8x sales and has an operating margin and a profit margin of about 24% which is more than twice
RDA.


Even if MONT revenues were real, the margins are really doubtful. 
Imo both revenues and margins are doubtful and the Gravity report is credible. 
The reported numbers are really very strange.


MONT revenues and margins started to skyrocket in 2011 which is exactly when their main distributor (the accused
LQW) was incorporated... 
And while revenues and margins started to skyrocket in 2011 the cost of sales was basically flat... it really seems a
kind of magic

In 2010, before MONT began to use LQW as a distributor, MONT reported largely negative net margins (-28%). In
2011, after adding on LQW as a distributor, MONT reported 73% revenue growth and net margins of positive 15.8%. 
LQW was incorporated in October 2011, the exact same month MONT claims to have started doing business with it.


And according to the Gravity Research report, The phone number for SMMT, the owner of LQW (+86 021-51696833)
is MONT's phone number, it goes directly to MONT’s interactive voice response system !
