Miller Energy: Pipe Dreams, Production And Bizarre Financing

It is recommended that this article be read in conjunction with the prior report on Miller
Energy Resources (NYSE:MILL).


Cash Concerns And Timeliness Of Annual Meetings


Miller's cash is running low at $4.3MM as of 10/31/12. Following FY11 (4/30/11), the CEO,
Scott Boruff, took (pg. 35) a $1.1MM cash performance bonus (25% of 10/31/12 cash) and
presumably will hope to receive a similar bonus for performance this year which will
further drag down the company's cash.


The most recent annual meeting took place on April 12, 2012; however, this meeting was
for the year ended 4/30/11. Miller holds its annual meeting for the prior year, less than 20
days prior to the end of the NEXT year. Typically companies host annual meeting 4 or 5
months after year end with the typical calendar year filer hosting meetings in April or May.
Miller waits more than 11 months.


By delaying the filing of the proxy and annual meeting till the last possible opportunity for
last year Miller management is able to delay disclosure of compensation arrangements for
its executives as well as updated options awards and any related party transactions. This
allows Miller management to prognosticate about the future and things to come while
quietly sweeping their poor execution for the year before under the rug. Imagine if you
turned in your expense report for 2011 in December 2012; your boss would laugh at you
and tell you not to expect to get paid back. By failing to file a proxy with any urgency, Miller
CEO is able to defer disclosing amounts related to his personal use of the corporate jet to
fly to vacation destinations in Florida which should be disclosed under "other
compensation" in the proxy.


Production Expenses


In the 10Q, MILL reported oil and gas operating expenses of $4.871 million for the quarter
ending 10/31/2012, on production of 78,145 boe (barrels of oil equivalent) for production
costs of $60 / barrel. This is obviously a much higher cost than the company's reserve
report assumes to calculate MILL's PV-10 value, which some investors are using to justify
Miller's valuation. However, if the cost assumptions underlying the report prove to be
optimistic, any valuation derived from the PV-10 calculated in the report will prove to be

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1101061-miller-energy-pipe-dreams-production-and-bizarre-financing 2/8


too high. As detailed in my last article on the company, Miller's reserve report assumes
that operating costs / barrel for the company's developed but non-producing assets will be
under $15/boe and operating costs on undeveloped assets will be less than $6/boe.


This is a convenient time to point out that much of the work Miller is currently performing
on the Osprey platform over the next year, if successful, will go towards restoring
production to levels that had already been achieved by Pacific Energy when they
controlled these assets. In the most recent quarter, Miller's average net production was
less than 900 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The bull thesis for Miller assumes that this
higher production will lower production costs per barrel to what is assumed in the reserve
report. However, this does not appear to be a reasonable assumption, since Pacific
Energy had Alaskan production over 6,000 barrels boe per day (more than four times
higher than Miller's current production rate) yet still experienced operating expenses over
$40 per boe (more than double the cost assumed in Miller's reserve report) in 2009.


This is before considering the fact that for the PV-10 to be an accurate representation of
the value for Miller's assets, the reserves need to be developed in a timely fashion, with
capital available to finance this development. In the case of Miller, both of these
assumptions appear to be tenuous at best.


Miller has nearly run their current credit facility up to the limit, and has had to place the
proceeds from their recent preferred stock sales into an escrow account with their lenders
who then allow disbursements from the account for approved capital expenditures. In
addition to this, Miller has been unable to meet the covenants of their debt facility, and is
at the mercy of their lenders to obtain waivers in order to avoid default.


Miller sticking to a development schedule has proven to be a bad bet historically.


1. Miller's CEO stated on their most recent earnings call (12/10/2012) that 10 days was a
conservative estimate for completion and testing of the RU-3 well. However, 11 days
later, the company released an update stating the well had still not been completed,
again promising another update as soon as well testing is complete. This update itself
was over 2 weeks ago, and includes what appears to now be another missed deadline,
when the company stated they expected to complete RU-3 and move to RU-4 "in the
first week of January 2013".


2. In the same earnings call estimating a 10 day completion time for the RU-3 well, Miller
also noted that drilling of their Olsen Creek prospect which they had planned to begin
drilling by the end of 2012 would be pushed into summer 2013.

3. Before receiving a waiver from their lender, the minimum level of production
acceptable for Miller to remain in compliance with the production covenant of their
credit facility was 1,500 bbls per day for 10/31/2012, when actual production averaged
less than 1,000 bbls per day for the quarter.


4. Finally, for further demonstration of Miller managements' poor long term ability to meet
production plans, one can go back to the Q3 2012 earnings call, from 3/12/2012.
When asked about where he saw total company production by calendar year end
2012, Miller's CFO responded, "We think that the total company view by the end of the
calendar year should be in the 4,500 to5,000 barrel-a-day range." In the most recent
10Q, filed on 12/10/2012 Miller noted that the first production measurement date for
the Apollo Credit Facility will be 1/31/31, when the required level will be 1,700 barrels
per day, and based on current production levels, they would not be in compliance.


Cook Inlet Energy:


When discussing opportunities, Forensic Accounter reminds shareholders that when
David Hall mentions the failures of "previous operators", he is in fact talking about his
team and their employment with the prior owners of these assets.


Cook Inlet Energy is the corporate subsidiary of MILL through which the company
acquired their Alaskan properties. Cook Inlet Energy was formed by former employees of
the bankrupted owner of the acquired assets, Pacific Energy. In fact, David Hall (the
current CEO of the Cook Inlet Energy subsidiary and MILL director), has been involved in
the operation of these same assets since 2000 (when they were owned by Forest Oil).


Keeping The Lights On


It is critical that Miller get the RU-3 well completed successfully in a timely manner since
the company is a net buyer of natural gas while operating in a region where XTO, an
Exxon (NYSE:XOM), subsidiary recently had to shut down two of their production
platforms in the Cook Inlet due to a natural gas supply shortage in the region.


Pipe Dreams


Miller filed plans for approval of a pipeline which is expected to cost $50MM and begin in
2014. Given the company's cash of $4.3MM as of 10/3/12 and declining production,
funding this large capital commitment would be incredibly difficult. Common shareholders
should expect either a secondary or the slow trickle of dilution as Miller makes use of its
at-the-market offering. Keep in mind that the lower the stock price goes, the worse the
dilution gets for each dollar raised in such a fashion.

Summary


Forensic Accounter continues to believe that Miller management paints a rosy outlook for
the company and makes use of side projects such as the pipeline and horizontal drilling
program to create talking points for use in finding additional sources of capital to
supplement the languishing pace of progress being exhibited in Alaska.

There's a certain clique of detestable people who are still simply livid that Miller was able to acquire the Alaskan
assets the way they did; and they're simply not going to stop with the scurrilous innuendo until they're finally silenced
with a lawsuit or something more draconian.

I am also a long investor who appreciates the ability to add even more shares at a lower cost. That having been said,
I disagree with what I consider to be misleading comments. Pacific may have had 6000 pbd from its Alaskan
operations at some point BUT Miller did not purchase all of those. I think that David Hall and Miller have done an
outsanding job of restoring production on the Osprey to it cururent levels which are significantly higher than the 20
(twenty)bpd when Pacific Energy abandoned them. I run my own business and fully understand that sometimes things
do not go as planned and delays frequently occur. We are dealing with Alaska and its rough climate which can and
does cause delays. Parts and supplies can be hard be obtain and probably take time to arrive. As for the pipe
dreams, Miller mentioned in their update that Tesoro is paying for some initial engineering which obviously helps the
company. Miller has great assets and appears committed to doing things right which is taking longer than expected
but which should provide long lasting shareholder value.

You are right Zheeeem . The 25 million that Apollo gave to MILL to pay off all the insiders with a 15 million "next
tranche" promise when MILL raised 15 million (Which hasn't yet occurred even though MIL raised 15 million) while
overseeing all financial conditions,(including financing of insurance premiums) is perfectly normal finances for a NYSE
company.


That and to have present CEO and his father in law founder selling and/or filing to sell a majority of their stock while
some insiders file to sell 100% of their stock is not bizarre at all.


How dare they put "bizarre financing"in their title line.

Thank you, thank you, but my point was that this article says absolutely nothing about financing, bizarre or otherwise.


It seems like a hack job, and "Forensic Accounter" seems to have established himself as a contributor solely to do a
hack job on Miller.

I am taking a long-term approach with Miller Energy Resources. During late 2012, I purchased 1,000 Miller Series C
preferred shares at $22.90 each. My brokerage allowed me to reinvest the first $410 I received from the December 3,
2012 partial payment for most of October and all of November 2012. The next payment expected will be in March
2013 for over $500; it is due to be announced during February 2013. This will also be invested into my Miller
preferreds. The coupon price is $25 per share. Good news also was released January 30, 2013, about MILL's RU-4A
site. Miller's plans seem to be getting closer to reality.
