CITRON UPDATES ZILLOW


 


While Control of Content Slips Away,
 Insider Stock Sales Continue


In Citron's comprehensive report on Zillow just
over two months ago
[http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/09/zillow-v8a-�nal-Sept-
25.pdf] , we highlighted the critical structural
weakness in Zillow's business model :  their main
revenue channel is generated to the detriment of
their primary customers, Real Estate brokers.   


"Zillow takes the intellectual property of
individual realtors (syndicated residential real
estate listings), mixes it together with some
other content, and displays it for users. Realtors
typically perceive that Zillow is re-branding their
listings as its own, and then promptly tries to sell
" the lead" (generated by advertising the listing
agent) right  back to the realtor who generated
the listing in the �rst place. This has been the
cause of much of the backlash."


— From Citron Research on Zillow, Sept 25, 2012


Citron believes the balance of power with regard to
control of content is the largest structural threat to
Zillow's business.  Evidence shows that balance of

power is shifting right now, and the market hasn't
priced in the risks.


Background


Zillow and the other online real estate database
sites buy the vast majority of their real estate


listings from 3rd parties "syndicators", who
aggregate large numbers of listings from brokerage
�rms.  The aggregation and redisplay of this
content is unpopular with many agents because
�rms like Zillow and Trulia sell ad space to other
agents (not the listing agent) to these listings, who
have subscribed for ad impressions by geographic
area, thus burying the listing agent contact data.


There is a serious con�ict of interest brewing here,
and Citron's opinion aligns with many industry
professionals that Zillow is strategically too low on
the Real Estate content food chain to control its fate
or justify its huge multiple.   


   Recent Developments


The most recent evidence of the shift in the balance
of power, which Citron believes has not been
re�ected by the market, is explained here.  It comes
from real estate industry news source Inman: :

[http://www.inman.com/news/2012/11/26/point2-
will-limit-third-party-sites-use-listing-data]


In a groundbreaking policy shift, Point2, the
number two syndicator of RE leads, gives
brokerages and MLS's more control over how their
listings data is used by publishers like Zillow and
Trulia, strictly limiting what publishers can do with
data they get.  This new policy goes into e�ect Jan 1,
2013. 


" The new policy, set to go into e�ect Jan. 1,
states that Point2-fed listings may not be
re-syndicated, must prominently display
the listing broker and agent's name and
contact information and must not be used

to sell leads to other agents or brokers,
among other terms. "


"Brokerages who are members of the 300-
plus MLSs and Realtor associations that
Point2 receives listings from will have to
indicate, on a case-by-case basis, whether
they wish to send listings to publishers
who don't agree to the tighter data-use
provisions."


Gregg Larson, one of the authors of the
"syndication bill of rights", an industry initiative to
regain control of the use of listings for the bene�t
of RE agents, commented :

In unstated acknowledgement of this looming
threat, Zillow begain attemping to sign up
brokerage �rms for direct submission of listings, in
exchange for prominent listing placement and
other perks.  The broker-direct feed program began
in July, and now after 5 months of operation,
includes just 48 brokers. 


Zillow's CEO had the opportunity to lend clarity to
the question on a Bloomberg TV appearance just
this morning, but he of course said nothing about
this looming threat; instead de�ecting questions
about insider stock sales and pointing to a slight
improvement in US residential real estate, which
itself has little correlation to Zillow's 860m market
cap.

   Keep Following the Money
Citron reminds readers that in the two months
since its Zillow report, and despite the 25%
depreciation in Zillow's stock price since then, the
drumbeat of insider sales continues unabated, with

no less than 85 new insider sales transactions
representing 176,000 shares and over 6 million
dollars in cash extracted by Zillow's insiders.  This
"small" amount, in the CEO's words, represents
over 4 times the run rate of enterprise net income
when compared to Zillow's most recent quarter, its
"most pro�table quarter ever".  And that's just in
the last two months.


   Conclusion
Something is really wrong with this picture.  Zillow's
churn rate is still undisclosed, and there are
unmistakeable signs that the balance of power with
regard to ownership of Real Estate listings is
shifting.   While a recent commentator noted that
Citron was in the "wrong pew in the right church", it
is Citron's opinion that it’s the long-term
shareholders in this stock who don't have a prayer.


Cautious investing to all.
