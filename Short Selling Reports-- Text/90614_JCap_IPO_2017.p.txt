 ‣ Disaster waiting to happen
IP Group has hurried to diversify risk from its biggest asset, Oxford 
Nanopore, a company that cannot make its technology work 
but whose valuation has been bloated by successive rounds of 
investment. Now, facing cash shortages, the company looks to be 
on the precipice of a major devaluation if not failure. That single 
company could drag down IPO’s price by 20%.


 ‣ Screwy book values
IP Group is an accounting game more than a company and has an 
atrocious track record of delivering bankable returns.


 ‣ Can’t help themselves
Private investors in IP Group share a collusive interest creating high 
paper values for tech concept companies that generally fail.


 ‣ SELL
We think the company is worth half its posted value at best.

Playing the DIY Valuation Game
Only children believe that, when a stage magician taps an empty box 
with a wand and opens the box to let a dove fly out, he has created life. Yet 
the market believes that IP Group (IPO LN, IPZYF OTCMKTS), fresh off 
a merger with Touchstone Innovations (IVO LN), has done just that. The 
reality is that IP Group is just a black box with no transformative power, 
and its valuation of £1.50 per share is inflated by around 50%. Right now, 
the company faces the threat of a sharp devaluation of its principal asset. 
We believe the merger was to avoid the collapse of IP Group when its key 
portfolio company, Nanopore, is significantly written down or closed. 


This grab bag of a company derives all its revenue from paper-only gains 
in more than 200 portfolio companies as well as from the smaller venture 
funds all jumbled inside, and yet never manages to make cash gains.


What has kept IP Group alive since it listed in 2006 are valuation-inflating 
infusions of cash in the portfolio companies by funds that are also inves-
tors in the listed parent. These funds share a perverse incentive to overpay 
in order to boost the valuation they can book. Portfolio company valua-
tions are magnified on the books of the parent and from there to the funds 
that own IPO. That creates a deeply embedded conflict of interest for inves-
tors that incentivizes them to embrace write-ups and avoid write-downs no 
matter what the market is telling them.


“IP Group is really good at persuading its shareholders to invest in the 
portfolio companies,” said a former member of the executive team in a 
phone interview with J Capital. “They all want valuations to rise.” No one 
has an interest in a down round or write-offs, and write-offs should be 
common at a company working at the seed stage of new technologies. Both 
institutional holders and management are rewarded based on increases in 
the book valuations rather than from cash returns.


IPO and its pyramid of investees are worth a small fraction of the traded 
price, which has recently swollen to £1.59 billion after merging with 
Touchstone, itself a controversial and failed experiment with a similar 
business model. The group’s very existence relies upon a continuing flow 
of capital into questionable technology companies.


The key investor behind each level of funding is the British fund manager 
Neil Woodford. Woodford had a stellar record as a large-cap investor but 
has been heavily criticized, including by the Financial Times,¹ for his bio-

tech frolics. “It has become very high profile for Woodford to invest in your 
company,” said the former executive. Woodford is under intense pressure 
this year, as his funds have seen £1 billion in redemptions following poor 
performance.²


The crown jewel and largest part of IP Group’s portfolio is a DNA sequenc-
ing company whose technology, after a decade of commercialization ef-
forts, has failed to generate material sales. The company, Oxford Nanopore, 
is valued on paper at £1,250.3 million but in our view is actually worth-
less and running out of money. Nanopore may already be looking for a 
new round of equity and could need an emergency cash infusion as early 
as January, if the 2017 burn rate matches what it was in 2016. Since 2009, 
Nanopore has generated 54% of the IP Group’s “revenue” by booking most 
of the group’s fair-value gains. Now, that valuation game may finally be 
ending: Nanopore is burning so much cash that we think it could fail early 
next year. That failure would catalyze a significant drop in NAV and cause 
losses for shareholders as well as a re-rating of the stock--something IP 
Group has flagged on page 40 of its 2016 Annual Report.


The potential for imminent failure of Nanopore may have been a key mo-
tivation behind IPO’s recent hostile takeover of Touchstone. The merger 
diluted Nanopore to 18% of combined company NAV and therefore will 
soften the impact on managerial bonuses of any write-down in Nanopore’s 
value.


The rest of the portfolio comprises a motley basket of tech ideas, some 
plausible and some downright silly but generating negative returns for IP 
Group. The group also manages venture capital funds for fees, but those 
funds, says a former member of the IP Group management team whom we 
interviewed by phone, do very poorly. Like IP Group itself, managed funds 
North East Technology Fund and IP Venture Funds I and II have yet to see 
lucrative exits. “There’s an agency challenge,” said the former manager. IP 
Group also pours capital into university tech-transfer platforms like Oxford 
Sciences Innovation and Cambridge Innovation Capital for no visible ben-
efit (unless you care about gratitude by university science departments).


IP Group has not had a single home run. The total of proceeds from dispos-
als since 2008 is £40.9 million, and that compares with a total of £346.3 
million invested in portfolio companies in the same period (including the 
acquisition of Fusion, an investment platform). Other gains are paper-only, 
with little prospect of being realized in cash.

IP Group (IPO LN)

IPO and IVO themselves, whose share prices track NAV, have also been 
poor investments. IVO has seen a 5% decline in its share price since its 
listing on AIM in 2006, and since that time, IPO has gained 17%. The LSE 
over the same period returned 275%.


In our opinion, IP Group’s profits are an accounting fiction and could 
quickly evaporate. We value Nanopore, currently 18% of portfolio value, at 
zero. The rest of the portfolio is too opaque for accurate evaluation, but ex-
ternal analysis like this groundbreaking Kauffman Foundation report has 
determined that 75% of venture capital funds render zero gains at termina-
tion and only three in 100 funds beat public market gains. IP Group had 
ample time to prove that it is among the three, and it has failed to do so. 
We assume there is salvage value in IP Group’s portfolio holdings but that 
most of the companies will fold. We therefore assign a 50% discount to the 
portfolio assets ex-Nanopore. That leaves us with a target price of £0.80, a 
47% discount to the stock’s price on December 13. The short-term catalyst 
for re-rating will likely be a write-down in the value of Oxford Nanopore. 


We discovered IP Group as a candidate for further evaluation by screening 
listed fund managers that have not achieved cash realization from exits. 
Forensic accounting analysis revealed valuation-inflating infusions of 
cash in the portfolio companies a small group of investors. Because Oxford 
Nanopore is such an outsized portion of the IP Group portfolio, we focused 
our primary research on that company, speaking with scientists we located 
through blogs and Twitter accounts and contacting Nanopore customers 
and former employees of the company for color on the product and pros-
pects for future sales. Interviews were largely conducted by telephone and

via email. IP Group products and services are highly technical and scientif-
ic in nature. We had four scientists with relevant knowledge review critical 
sections of the report at various stages of drafting.


We have contacted IP Group to discuss issues raised in our research and 
the company was unable to coordinate a time for a telephone conference. 
Company management is generally open and helpful.


In the early days, Nanopore’s process seemed to eliminate the require-
ment that strands of DNA be tagged with dyes or other markers to 
make it easier to “see” the nucleotides that make up the DNA. Bulky 
and expensive equipment, typically using lasers, is needed to read these 
dye-terminators. Nanopore measures electrical impulses that occur as 
strands of DNA pass through a tiny biological hole called a nanopore. 
That should make sequencing fast, cheap, and easy to do. DNA blocks 
part of the protein pore while it transits. Nanopore applies an electric 
current and measures the change created by this blocking to identify 
specific nucleobases. This is something like blocking water coming out 
of a tap and using the direction of the water to identify the object that 
blocked the tap. A semiconductor or “ASIC” specially designed to “read” 
the electric current is installed in the Nanopore device to record the 
electric “squiggles.” Those squiggles are sent to a powerful computer 
that runs machine-learning algorithms to translate the squiggles back 
to DNA sequences.


The process sounded good, but Oxford Nanopore couldn’t solve the 
technical problems. A former Oxford Nanopore scientist told us that 
the nanopores are unstable, need refrigeration, and have a shelf life of 
a relatively brief eight weeks. The sequencing is error-prone. The algo-
rithms the technical team wrote to interpret data have to be updated 
all the time, but they are embedded in hardware, so the sequencers in 
the market have glitches that can’t easily be fixed. Nanopore has failed 
to cooperate with the scientific community, so no one writes compatible 
software to make the Nanopore technology more useful. “Nanopore has 
a very bad relationship with the scientific community,” said a scientist 
who was formerly employed by Nanopore. “I wondered why, and then I 
realized that Nanopore is not paid by customers; it’s paid by investors. 
Maybe that is why they close the doors to the scientific community.”

Pore Man’s Technology
Oxford Nanopore is the principal driver of IPO’s valuation: IP Group’s 
19.7% stake in Oxford Nanopore is valued at £246.3 million, or 18% of the 
total portfolio. We believe this company will eventually go to zero; as soon 
as January, its value could be written down. That is because Nanopore is 
burning around £5 million each month, based on its financial statements 
and the comments of insiders, and the company had £64 million in the 
bank at the end of 2016 despite having raised £100 million in December 
2016.


Oxford Nanopore had a breakthrough about 15 years ago. The problem is 
that the company never figured out how to commercialize the technology, 
and now it has been surpassed.


Critically, Nanopore has not figured out how to make its sequencing cheap. 
Although the smallest of the Nanopore devices sells for just $1,000, the 
cost of getting data out of it, according to a former data scientist who 
worked three years for Oxford Nanopore, is roughly 100x that of sequenc-

ing by the industry leader, Illumina (ILMN US), or $1,000 per microbe ver-
sus $1,000 for at least 100 microbes by an Illumina device. Much of that 
cost is hidden until the customer acquires a device, because it’s the cost of 
calculating results. The genomics expert Shawn Baker, writing on Quora, 
estimates that sequencing a genome on a MinION costs about $90,000. 
This compares with $1,000 for sequencing a genome on an Illumina device. 
Independent estimates for sequencing on a device from competitor Pacific 
Biosciences (PACB US) suggest a cost of $3,000 for a genome. Since the hu-
man genome was successfully mapped in 2003, sequencing has fallen in 
price by nearly five orders of magnitude—far faster than the price of semi-
conductors. In a world where companies like 23andme will provide gene 
testing to consumers for as little as $130 per sample, the Oxford Nanopore 
proposition looks very outdated.


Nanopore was formed as a spin-out from the University of Oxford in 2005, 
with seed funding from IP Group, by a team of three: the renowned chem-
ist Professor Hagan Bayley, Gordon Sanghera, a scientist who had spent 
most of his career at the diabetes diagnostics company Medisense, and 
Spike Willcocks, a biochemist. Although the men are by all reports talent-
ed scientists, Nanopore staff we spoke with believe that management are 
terrible custodians of shareholder value and have created a siloed company 
in which researchers do not talk to development team, and no one dares 
challenge management. 


It turns out that scientists do not necessarily know how to build business-
es. Former middle management interviewed by phone told us that Nano-
pore managers are “failed" as academics and yet lack managerial expertise. 
Research is conducted without regard for commercial value. Different de-
partments are asked not to communicate. Certain researchers control spe-
cific technologies, putting the company at risk of losing the technology if 
those people leave, and no one can challenge executives.


“There’s a very significant waste of resources internally, like duplicated 
posts,” said a former technical employee.


The Hype
Faced with these problems early on, Nanopore management doubled down: 
they took the nanopore research idea and made it into science fiction. The 
executives have been promoting a vision of Oxford Nanopore devices in ev-
ery shirt pocket, allowing citizen-scientists to sequence microbes as they 
walk through subway stations and airports or drink a glass of water.


In 2012, CEO Gordon Sanghera claimed that Nanopore would be sequenc-

ing the human genome in 15 minutes by the next year. The company said 
the technology would allow computation on a smart phone. In 2012, Sang-
hera said that Nanopore’s GridION and MinION devices—neither of which 
yet existed--were “poised to deliver a completely new range of benefits to 
researchers and clinicians." The MinION was not available until 2015 and 
the GridION came on the market in March this year. Neither device--both 
of which have been sold in very limited numbers and appear to be plagued 
with problems--is remotely capable of sequencing the human genome in 
15 minutes. 


In an April 2016 article in The Atlantic, CTO Clive Brown talked about how 
Nanopore would enable an “internet of living things”:


“What if you can track every beef burger? What is it, where did it 
come from, and what’s growing on it?” he asks. “What if every pack-
age that goes through an airport had a swab taken off it? Or the 
air supply in a hospital? We have interest from plant breeders who 
want to track what’s happening to their crops. I spoke to someone 
in the defense industry who wanted to detect pathogens in real-
time on the London Underground.” 


The company promoted the idea of this brave new world through their 
“London Calling” annual conference and heavy promotions of an experi-
ment in a young scientist went to Africa to look for the Ebola virus with a 
MinION device. The Atlantic in 2015 wrote admiringly of the Ebola epi-
sode, and analysts bought the idea. But these promotions were half-truths 
at best. In reality, according to several DNA scientists, Nanopore field se-
quencing requires a mobile lab with refrigeration and uplinks for massive 
data streams. It would be cheaper and more effective to transport blood 
samples to labs. Said one scientist who formerly worked for Nanopore, in a 
phone interview, “Portability is a myth.” 


“The citizen scientist is really far off,” said DNA scientist Keith Robison, 
who writes a blog called Omics! Omics!⁴ Robison says that, despite claims 
to simplicity, Oxford Nanopore’s technology requires sample preparation 
that is very difficult without scientific training.


 “If you want to do directed testing for Zika, Ebola, or whatever, you can 
quickly generate a dipstick test that will be cheaper,” says Robison. “If you

know what you’re looking for, there are simpler strategies.”


Finally, Nanopore’s reads are fatally error-prone—5-15%, according to 
DNA scientist Dr. Bhagyashree Birla as well as an article in Nature that 
appeared in June 2016.⁵ PacBio has roughly the same amount of errors on 
the first read-through. But PacBio sequencing can be repeated over and 
over until errors are very low, while Nanopore sequencing cannot. For one 
thing, Nanopore’s errors are not random, so the same error is often intro-
duced if the sequencing is repeated. That is a fatal flaw. 


Over-promise and Under-deliver
Nanopore’s principal product is a handheld sequencer called the MinION, 
announced in 2012 but first made commercially available in May 2015. In 
January 2014, Nanopore announced that the early access program for the 
MinION was “heavily oversubscribed,”⁶ but the MinION saw less than £1 
million in revenue in 2015.


The MinION contains just one flow cell. A flow cell is a single-use car-
tridge containing the nanopore, an ASIC, a plastic casing, and the other 
components of the sequencing reaction. Nanopore gives away the MinION

for free with a consumable “starter pack” that costs $1,000. It’s a “razor-
razor blade” idea, based on the idea that the company will develop a wide 
base of installed devices and then sell lots of consumable kits. But the 
computational requirements and the unreliability of the technology make 
that impossible. Indeed, Nanopore’s low sales have not supported the idea 
that customers will buy lots of consumables.


The only other product that has actually launched is the GridION X5, 
a desktop device that processes up to five MinION flow cells. This was 
launched in March 2017. People in the sequencing community say that 
Nanopore launched the GridION to access the institutional market, since 
the MinION has failed to boost sales. 


Behind the GridION launch is an underlying problem that Nanopore would 
prefer investors not dwell on: its long-promised PromethION device is so 
plaugued with technical problems that it may never launch at all. A former 
Nanopore employee told us that the PromethION may not be possible. “They 
can’t fit enough computing power in the box,” he said. The Nanopore pro-
cess is just too data-intensive. 


The PromethION is a benchtop device that is intended to process 48 flow 
cells. It was originally promised for 2015. In 2014, the company was solic-
iting $135,000 “early access fees” from buyers of the PromethION. In July 
2015, Nanopore again offered an early access fee of $24,000 and a deposit 
of $75,000. But in 2016, deferred income was only £1.4 million, less than 
half the level of 2015, and in late 2017, the machine has still not launched. 


Robison believes the PromethION and the GridION represent throwing in 
the towel on the “citizen scientist.” In November 2016, Robison wrote a 
blog post entitled, “Is the PromethION a Strategic Error?” Having failed to 
sell a lot of MinION devices, the company is trying to capture the institu-
tional market.


Other products remain theoretical. The VolTRAX is supposed to simplify 
and automate sample preparation but it is in development and a former em-
ployee of the company does not expect that the technical problems associ-
ated with the VolTRAX will be overcome. The SmidgION is a mobile phone 
sequencer announced in May 2016 but also in development.

“One person says the CTO announces products that don’t exist and 
before we know if they’re possible (usually they’re not and so we 
waste months and millions)’. Is ‘Prometheon’ one such product?”⁷


The shift toward large, institutional analyzers and away from the hand-
held versions betrays a fundamental flaw in the MinION idea. The vision 
of Stanley-and-Livingston-style researchers slashing through underbrush 
with MinIONs in the pockets of their bush jackets was a potent story for 
selling the potential of the company, but practicalities have overcome it.


“Commercialization is a complete failure,” said a former employee in a 
phone interview. “The marketing and product strategy are completely dys-
functional.”


Nanopore China 
After a decade without revenue, Nanopore showed some progress in 2016 
and has sold several of the newest Nanopore devices, the GridION, in the 
Chinese market in 2017. The company announced that it has appointed 
a distributor in China, Shanghai NanodigmBio. But every one of the six 
Chinese GridION and MinION buyers we spoke with said they were disap-
pointed and did not plan to buy again. These companies had made their 
purchases because the device seemed to offer “long” gene sequencing for a 
fraction of the price of PacBio devices, which most of them own. The buy-
ers said the Nanopore sequencers are error-prone and deliver much less 
data than promised. 


An employee of one of the three Chinese buyers Nanopore recently an-
nounced confirmed that the company had purchased three sequencers from 
Oxford Nanopore, but “We’re not very satisfied with the results. We defi-
nitely will not buy more,” he said. “Their technology is not very mature…. 
We spent all this money, but we achieved about 10% of the expected re-
sults.” He added, “We think about 80% of what company management says 
is bull.”


A second said that his company had chosen the MinION for its low price 
and advantages in long sequencing. “But we weren’t very satisfied with the 
results. Their management says the device can process several megabytes 
but we only got to 30 kilobytes, 1,000 times worse than reported. . . . Now 
we’re mostly using PacBio—their stuff is much more reliable and mature.”

The third customer, Bioscikin, is a subsidiary of Simcere Pharmaceuti-
cal and an investor in Oxford Nanopore’s most recent, 100 million round.⁸ 
Simcere Pharmaceutical is also intimately linked with the lead investor in 
Nanopore’s 2016 round, GT Healthcare. Bioscikin employees did not com-
ment on the quality of Nanopore equipment.


A genetics institute in Beijing conducted a detailed comparison of exist-
ing technologies for long sequencing. One of the researchers said that 
Nanopore’s reads are the longest but that the institute chose to buy PacBio 
equipment. A management employee of a key partner to Nanopore in a 
phone interview said [our translation], “The cost for Nanopore reads is very 
high; basically it’s very hard to make commercial. Even though the ma-
chine isn’t that expensive, the materials are, because you need to do a lot 
of tests.” 


Quite a few companies in China use PacBio technology, the interviewee 
said. The list price is about four times as high as that for Nanopore, but us-
ing Nanopore is in the end more expensive. Every one of the organizations 
interviewed preferred Illumina technology.


Competitors
Nanopore’s valuation compares negatively with comparables in public mar-
kets. Pacific Biosciences has only $346 million in market cap despite $91 
million in 2016 sales. PacBio’s is the most widely used long-read platform, 
called single-molecule real-time sequencing or SMRT. But, despite revenue 
growth, PacBio can’t earn an operating profit, and the stock price hasn’t 
gone anywhere for a long time.


Nevertheless, PacBio gets better reviews from users. The key is that PacBio 
opens itself to the research community and encourages complementary 
software, while Oxford Nanopore is inimical to scientists. 


Illumina is the market leader in sequencing and specializes in “synthetic” 
long-read sequencing. That is, instead of reading a long strand of DNA, 
Illumina’s technology marks short strands and assembles them in a com-
puter based on the tags or “barcodes.” This synthetic assembly allows the 
researcher to see larger structures and may displace long-read technolo-

gies like PacBio’s and Nanopore’s. 


Illumina, a profitable company with $2.4 billion in revenue, is valued at 30x 
earnings. Investors sensibly recognize that DNA sequencing is falling in price 
at the fastest rate yet seen for a technology.


Short-read sequencers tend to be faster, more reliable, and cheaper. Long-read 
sequencers see more complexity and can be better for “de novo” sequencing 
of unknown organisms, if phasing of DNA structures is relevant. Short-read 
technologies probably have an edge in diagnostic applications and long reads 
in research applications. Illumina is the industry giant in short-read sequenc-
ing and PacBio in long reads. 


Driving the valuation
The importance of Nanopore to IP Group’s accounting profits can hardly be 
overstated. Revenue in this company consists almost entirely of fair-value 
gains from successive investment rounds. Since Nanopore has been particu-
larly successful raising money, it has delivered on fair-value gains and car-
ried IP Group’s NAV increase each year. From 2009 until June 2017, changes 
in Oxford Nanopore’s fair value comprised 65% of IP Group’s total gains and 
54% of IP Group’s total revenue. In the years 2012-2016, Oxford Nanopore’s 
changes in fair value were 69% of IP Group’s total changes in fair value, or 
59% of IP Group’s total revenue.

All of these paper gains rely on up-rounds driven by the same small group 
of investors. Since 2008, Nanopore has raised £407.34 million. Excepting the 
London-based fund Odey and a mysterious Chinese fund called GT Healthcare, 
all funding participants are also investors in IP Group and others of its invest-
ees. They are IP Group, Invesco—Neil Woodford’s former employer—Lansd-
owne, a London fund typically co-invests with Invesco and Woodford, and of 
course, Woodford Investments. We are in no way accusing Woodford or other 
funds of wrongdoing but simply pointing out that it would be very hard for a 
manager invested in many layers of this company to disentangle the narrow 
interest of fund investors from the broader interests of IP Group shareholders.


“They don’t have a successful product and they have unlimited money,” said 
a former member of the IP Group management team who has worked with 
Nanopore. “Every year they say they will float [on public markets] and every 
year they don’t, because they would have to show revenue and they can’t do 
that.”

ment capital and promises of another round should Nanopore reach develop-
ment targets that were not publicly delineated. At the end of the first half of

2013, the companies ended their cooperation when Nanopore apparently be-
gan looking for paths to commercialize its technology without Illumina. Ross 
Muken, an ISI analyst, wrote at the time that the break-up would not affect 
Illumina’s share price, saying that the fracturing of the Illumina and Oxford's 
relationship would not affect Illumina's share price since most investors had 
heavily discounted the success rate of Oxford Nanopore.


"We continue to view Oxford as an intriguing company with a compel-
ling technology. However, the technical complications of nanopore-
based sequencing make the commercial feasibility of the products 
highly uncertain," he wrote.


Legal challenges 
Oxford Nanopore was sued for patent infringement by Illumina, which 
claimed exclusive rights to Oxford Nanopore’s particular type of biological 
nanopore. Oxford Nanopore settled the lawsuit in August 2016 and resolved to 
use a different nanopore on which Illumina does not have a patent.

In March this year, PacBio filed a complaint against Nanopore, claiming in-
fringement of a sequencing technique. PacBio has a patent on the double-read 
process, which lets you check results by simultaneously reading both strands 
of DNA. This action has not been resolved. PacBio won an action against 
Nanopore in late 2016 that effectively barred Nanopore from selling the Grid-
ION in the United States. However, in March this year, Nanopore’s CTO Clive 
Brown said that, in May, the GridION X5 kits would no longer use the technol-
ogy in dispute.⁹ There has been no further announcement.


IPO’s Other Concept Companies
Nanopore is the most outsized of IP Group’s poor bets. The rest of the port-
folio holds little of near-term commercial promise, and there have been no 
highly remunerative exits to date.


IP Group’s gains rely entirely on fair-value gain from Nanopore. The company 
has invested £341.9 million since 2008 in its portfolio companies and realized 
a cash gain of £40.9 million. The 10-year fair-value gain is £564 million, but 
the record shows those gains will not be realized. Besides, nearly all of the 


gain derives from Nanopore, which is a 
ticking bomb. 


Touchstone is no better. In total, from 
its listing through the 2017 Interim 
report, Touchstone invested £372.4 mil-
lion in portfolio companies and realized 
£51 million in cash. The portfolio total 
fair value gains have totaled £88.7 mil-
lion. Its portfolio companies collectively 
raised £1.7 billion over the same period. 
That amounts to an average annual gain 
of 4% on the portfolio investment on a 
straight-average basis—should the fair 
value gains be realized. That 4% does 
not take into account the roughly £80 
million sunk into Touchstone the parent 
company. Touchstone has a cumulative 
£455.7 million over 10 years under its 
belt in proceeds from financing.

The problem, according to a longtime executive of IP Group interviewed by 
telephone, is that IP goes into very small companies at an early stage of devel-
opment, and these companies have minuscule chances of success. The investor 
needs to be ready to cut them loose when they don’t meet targets. IP Group, 
this former executive said, is really good at persuading its shareholders to 
invest in the portfolio companies. But they all want valuations to rise, and no 
one has an interest in a failure that would decrease NAV. 


“If you can get into a traditional PE, that’s better than IP Group,” said the ex-
ecutive. “Realizing cash income is the main thing for VCs.”


In general, Touchstone and IP Group portfolio companies are small and specu-
lative start-ups based on technology that has no proven commercial applica-
tion and sometimes has already proven a failure. A few examples of portfolio 
companies:


 ‣ Circassia, a public company that wants to vaccinate people against their 
cats, but whose share price has fallen by 75% since its vaccination failed 
miserably at trials in June 2016.


 ‣ First Light, a company in the discredited technology of cold fusion.
 ‣ Veryan, which is developing a new device for stenting coronary arteries. 


But trials thus far have not shown efficacy for stenting. 
 ‣ OxSyBio, one of the companies that, like Nanopore, emerged from the 


Oxford University laboratory of chemist Hagan Bayley. The team has 
never successfully commercialized a research idea.


 ‣ Genomics plc is a genomics company whose main purpose seems to be 
to create a market for Oxford Nanopore—a company we think is a zero. 
In IP Group’s annual report, the company explains that Genomics “was 
the first to sequence Multiple Human Genomes using hand-held Nano-
pore technology.” The company generated a book gain of £4.9 million in 
the first half of 2017 for IP Group.


 ‣ Cell Medica, a company that has been much more successful raising 
money--£77 million so far, from Touchstone, Woodford, and Invesco—
than in developing its proposed immunotherapy for cancer.


 ‣ Ultrahaptics: A technology designed to enhance virtual reality with a 
sense of touch. The company is struggling to find use cases for its tech-
nology and has been promoting in-air dashboard controls in automo-
biles. 


 ‣ Nexeon, a lithium-ion battery company, since 2004 has been exploring 
silicon anodes. IVO invested an additional £30 million last year. The 
competition in l-ion batteries is intense.


 ‣ Salunda: Offers devices to monitor machinery at the poles or in very 
high altitudes.

IP Group’s 38.9%-owned in-video advertising portfolio company Mirriad 
Advertising plc is set to list on AIM before Christmas and is being valued at 
£63 million. That would bring IP Group’s fair value to £24.5 million, up from 
the carrying value of £13.4 million reported at the 2017 Interim. Excluding 
Oxford Nanopore, this gain of £11.1 million would rank among the highest 
fair-value gains for IP Group historically but, depending on other results in 
H2 2017, would fail to make up for the poor gains in 2016, when IP Group 
invested £33.8 million and realized a deflation in fair value, posting net gains 
of only £7 million.


Trying to Make Two Stones Float
We think the driver behind the November 1 hostile takeover of Touchstone 
was to dilute the effect of a potential Nanopore write-down. This view is cor-
roborated by a former member of the management team who knows both 
companies very well. IP Group “had too much commitment to Nanopore,” he 
said. The merger “solves their biotech problem. . . If Nanopore was to blow up, 
it would have a huge effect on IP Group.”


The Touchstone merger does not create shareholder value but does help man-
agement preserve their bonuses under the current incentive scheme. With 
Nanopore comprising such a high proportion of IP Group’s NAV, a write-down 
would almost negate any chance of management receiving compensation 
under the LTIP for at least three years. Under the LTIP scheme, management 
is evaluated based on “Total Share Returns” (share price performance rela-
tive to the FTSE 250) as well as growth in “hard NAV”—NAV minus goodwill 
and intangibles. Since the share price of IP Group (and other listed PE groups) 
typically mirrors NAV, these performance metrics are closely linked.


In order to qualify for compensation under the LTIP, management is required 
to grow hard NAV by a minimum threshold of 8% per annum over a consecu-
tive three-year period. A substantial write-down of Nanopore would lower 
management’s odds of achieving this threshold. Because performance is mea-
sured on a three-year basis, a write-down in 2017 would impact compensa-
tion in the following three years. It is worth noting that, for the financial year

2016, neither TSR nor hard NAV performance met the minimum threshold 
under the LTIP. Hard NAV was tracking at 6% annual growth versus the 8% 
minimum hurdle.  A write-down in Nanopore would only make the 8% target 
even more elusive.


Management owns very few shares in IP Group. The largest portion of poten-
tial compensation for executive directors of IP Group comes from the LTIP. 
The CEO, or instance, can earn up to 300% of his base salary under the LTIP 
but only 100% of his base under the annual incentive scheme (AIS). Manage-
ment compensation under the LTIP has increased in recent years – in 2015 
for instance, the maximum payout for CEO and other executive directors were 
previously capped at 100% of base. 


As managers of a larg-
er company, IP Group 
executives will also 
likely find justification 
to increase their base 
salaries post acquisi-
tion. Given that com-
pensation is based on 


“size and complexity” of the underlying business, 
our best guess is that salaries go up.

Here is what Alan Aubrey’s compensation will look like should NAV meet the 
target:


The business reality is that merging the two companies is like tying two 
stones together and expecting them to float. Once the portfolio companies are 
unstrung and evaluated on their merits, there is very little to like about either 
IPO or Touchstone. Both Touchstone and IPO Group have diluted sharehold-
ers and invested their money for lackluster returns. Prior to the merger, IPO’s 
NAV per share had seen 343% dilution since the 2006 IPO. 


How IP companies perform 
Funds like this just don’t work. Study after study has demonstrated that 
around 90% of venture capital funds make low returns. The CFO of one private 
equity company in the U.S. commented, “VC as a sector delivers very poor re-
turns…we say it is not an asset class.” The Kaufman Foundation in Kansas City 
reviewed its own historical performance with its $250 million VC fund and its 
$1.83 billion endowment fund and concluded that “Returns data is very clear: 
it doesn’t make sense to invest in anything but a tiny group of ten or twenty 
top-performing VC funds.” IP Group, and its new merger partner, Touchstone, 
are not among those top performers.

versities are not at all unusual and generally perform very poorly. Xperi Cor-
poration (XPER US, down 48% since inception) creates and licenses audio, 
imaging, semiconductor packaging, and interconnect technologies. Trading at 
2.4x book value, the company has a negative 8.8% return on assets. GSV Capi-
tal Corp. (GSCV US, down 57% since inception), investments in venture capi-
tal-backed companies. Firsthand Technology Value Fund Inc. (SVVC US, down 
69% since inception) invests in early-stage technology companies, mostly in 
cleantech. The list goes on. In fact, among tech-focused listed VC funds, none 
has performed well.


Echo chamber: the Woodford Funds
The most prominent investor in IP Group and many of its portfolio companies, 
Neil Woodford, has taken aggressive positions in small biotech names, includ-
ing highly publicized failures like Circassia and Northwest Biotherapeutics, a 
company focused on developing a vaccine for brain cancer. Woodford’s funds 
are invested not only in IP Group but in portfolio companies Oxford Nanopore, 
4D pharma, Horizon, hVivo, Ultrahaptics, and many smaller companies as well 
as in some of the investment funds IP Group owns. 


The Woodford funds’ involvement in IPO portfolio companies at the seed 
and private equity level as well as in the listed company create an unavoid-
able conflict of interest and positive feedback loop on the valuation, which 
ultimately is being determined by a small number of investors. When, for 
example, Nanopore’s “value” in 2016 jumped 39%, from £899 million to £1.25 
billion, the Woodford funds were able to record a nearly 28% return and IP 
Group booked £7 million in revenue from the fair-value gain of its holding, a 
full 92% of the group’s revenue in 2016.

In the Woodford Equity Income Fund portfolio, Oxford Nanopore is the 26th-
ranked contributor to fund performance out of 156 holdings at the end of the 
first half of this year.


The leader of Oxford Nanopore’s £100 mln raise last December was a little-
known fund based in Hong Kong and Nanjing called GT Healthcare (coinci-
dentally, a name shared by an Invesco fund that ran from 1997 to 2005). Seek-

ing Alpha described GT Healthcare as a pan-Asia fund with a focus on China:


Oxford Nanopore’s “fund-raising was led by a new investor, the pan-
Asian fund GT Healthcare, which has a particular focus on China. The 
round also included existing investors Woodford Investment Manage-
ment and IP Group.”


In fact, GT Healthcare looks very much like a British fund transplanted to 
Asia. In addition to Nanopore, it reports investing in Immunocore, Jupiter 
Diagnostics, and Organox, all British companies, and RareCyte, based in Se-
attle, with no reported Asian operations.¹⁰ Of the investees, Immunocore is 
also a Woodford investee and Organox is another Oxford University company. 
That leads us to suspect that GT Healthcare may be another in the cluster of 
related-party funds that are helping pump up Nanopore’s value—but we have 
no evidence that that thesis is true.

GT has little presence in China. The company cohabits with Simcere, a phar-
maceutical company formerly listed in the U.S. and privatized in December 
2013 and of which GT Healthcare’s managing partner, Alan Au, was a director. 
Simcere Pharma is named on the GT Healthcare website as a “cooperator’ and 
is a buyer of Nanopore devices in China.


Summary
Like other listed IP companies, IP Group has been a terrible investment. Even 
the meager returns the group has realized have been essentially invented 
by agreement among the clubby group of investors in British university IP. 
At private equity funds, partners whose investments don’t achieve exits are 
forced out. At IP Group, the unnatural body just keeps walking.


Oxford Nanopore’s last raise, which concluded in December 2016, assigned a 
valuation to Nanopore far in excess of much larger competitors with proven 
products. It is hard to imagine how the company could raise more money at 
the same valuation. If there is a raise, it will likely be on distressed terms. A 
loan from the parent would prolong Nanopore’s life, but not for long.
