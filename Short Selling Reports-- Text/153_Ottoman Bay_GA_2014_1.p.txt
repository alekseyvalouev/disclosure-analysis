Giant's Dubious Proposal - Unmasking Questionable Behavior
Jan. 3, 2014 1:24 PM ET46 comments
by: Ottoman Bay


We believe Giant Interactive (NYSE:GA) has defrauded investors and that the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission will bring charges against the company. We will
present evidence that we believe shows Chairman Shi Yuzhu has diverted resources from
the company, through a series of "undisclosed" related party transactions, in order to
siphon tens of millions of dollars of shareholder cash out of the company and into his own
private equity firm. More alarmingly, Giant's "independent director" Jason Jiang, who sits
on the audit, compensation and corporate governance committee, is an undisclosed
related party to Chairman Shi Yuzhu through their affiliation in Yunfeng Capital. Yunfeng
Capital is a private equity firm both Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiang are founding partners and
directors of -- this is a clear conflict of interest and a direct violation of NYSE
independence requirement 303A.02 and SEC guidelines. We believe Jason Jiang will be
forced to resign.


In addition to the regulatory headwinds, we see numerous red flags surrounding the
chairman's recent "non-binding" buyout proposal. We believe Shi Yuzhu has little interest
in taking Giant private and more of an interest in liquidating shares at inflated prices. Giant
has a record of fairly egregious fraud and money laundering in the past, and we believe
the issues covered will encourage even the most speculative private equity affiliate to
strongly reconsider risking his or her investor's capital in Giant Interactive. Investors
should note that Barings Private Equity is no stranger to walking away from bad
businesses even after proposals were made -- see China Ambow and Harbin Electric as
recent examples. Absent Giant's purported buyout, investors will certainly be left with a
weakening business operating in a hypercompetitive, fragmented gaming market that is
experiencing significant pricing competition and consistent share losses. We believe
Giant's shares will ultimately be worth far less than the $7 Chairman Shi Yuzhu liquidated
6% (11 million shares) of his Giant stake for in June 2013.


If the Chairman Thinks It's Worth $7, Then We Think It's Worth $7 -- or Less


On Nov. 25, 2013, Giant's board announced that it received a "proposal of going private"
for $11.75 from its Chairman Shi Yuzhu. Note that a proposal is not a buyout offer -- it is
just that, a proposal.

5/22/2018 Giant's Dubious Proposal - Unmasking Questionable Behavior - Giant Interactive Group Inc. (NYSE:GA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1927341-giants-dubious-proposal-unmasking-questionable-behavior 2/18


Year to date, Giant Interactive has returned 109% and is trading at valuations the
company hasn't seen in five years. The natural question investors should ask themselves
is: Why does the founder propose to take Giant private now? Furthermore, if the chairman
believes the company is truly undervalued, as his MBO suggests, why has he continued to
liquidate his stake in Giant alongside the run-up? We believe this is a development that
should always give investors pause.


To provide context, in April 2013, Shi Yuzhu abruptly resigned as CEO of Giant Interactive.
The following month, in June 2013, Shi Yuzhu announced that he would be selling 15.1m
of his shares in GA and granting underwriters an additional 2.3m shares for overallotment.
After backlash from the investment community, Shi Yuzhu sold 6% of his stake (11m
shares) at a price of $7.25 Ads (a YTD +42% premium). Note that $7.25 was a 15%
discount to the $8.50 trading price before the initial announcement; implying underwriters
weren't exactly bullish on the stock. The transaction came as a surprise to the market and
represented the first share sale by Shi Yuzhu since the company went public in 2007. The
company explained the share sale as an opportunity for Shi Yuzhu to "diversify his
personal holdings" and improve liquidity in the company's shares.


Thus does a conundrum rear its head; fast forward to November 2013, just five months
after Chairman Shi Yuzhu sold his first significant stake in the company, when Giant
received a less-than-transparent "non-binding" proposal from its chairman and an affiliate
of Baring Private Equity Asia to acquire shares for $11.75. That meant effectively buying
back his own shares at an astonishing 62% premium to the $7.25 he sold his shares for
just five months before. We believe this is a perplexing action that merits a healthy dose of
skepticism and increased scrutiny.


Post Buyout proposal, the Chairman Is Still Disposing of His Shares


Click to enlarge images.


Just one month after Chairman Shi Yuzhu put a promise ring on the fingers of
shareholders, he turns around and sells another 5% of his stake or 11.8m shares through
his investment company Vogel Holdings to Barings Private Equity. Shi Yuzhu's perpetual
selling reeks of liquidity issues rather than an honest buyout proposal.


What Does the Chairman Know That We Don't?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1927341-giants-dubious-proposal-unmasking-questionable-behavior 3/18


1. Investors should question why Chairman Shi Yuzhu appears so anxious to dispose of
his shares in Giant, selling a combined 11% of his stake in the last six months at far
lower valuations than his purported buyout price.


2. Investors should also note that transiting the shares through its affiliate Barings Private
Equity guarantees that liquidating the chairman's shares would not be transparent as
Barings is not required to register share sales with the SEC as Shi Yuzhu would.


3. If the chairman truly believes there is value in GA above 11.75, diluting his stake at any
opportunity he gets is an odd way of showing it.


The lack of disclosure also speaks volumes about the chairman's true intentions. We find
the proposal incredibly opaque and lacking any real merit. A legitimate proposal
traditionally has the following engagements in place, which can give shareholders
confidence in management's ability to execute:


1. There is no definitive funding.
2. There are no definitive partners.
3. There is no definitive timeline.


Investors were presented with the following: "We intend to finance the Acquisition with a
combination of debt and equity capital. Equity financing would be provided from the
Consortium Members and any additional members we accept into the Consortium."


Investors should note that Barings Private Equity Asia is no stranger to partnering with
bad businesses and then walking away even after proposals are issued. Note that Giant's
proposal is "preliminary" and "non-binding." Investors don't need to look very far to find
Barings buyout partnership with China Ambow in March 2013, which cost Barings $43
million on a $57 million investment, shortly after the resignation of four of the company's
independent directors and its auditors.


"Education in China is a sector in which Baring Asia has had extensive prior investment
experience," said Barings' Chief Executive Jean Eric Salata in a statement prior to its
investment. Investors can also add add Harbin Electric to that list. Barings quickly walked
away from Harbin Electric in 2011, another U.S.-listed Chinese company, shortly after
questions began to arise about the company's fraudulent operations and lack of corporate
governance.


What Else Is Giant Hiding?

5/22/2018 Giant's Dubious Proposal - Unmasking Questionable Behavior - Giant Interactive Group Inc. (NYSE:GA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1927341-giants-dubious-proposal-unmasking-questionable-behavior 4/18


In 2010 and 2011, Giant Interactive came to symbolize how founders of Chinese tech
firms used their companies as personal investment vehicles, often to the detriment of
minority shareholders. For Chairman Shi Yuzhu, old habits die hard. On September 2011,
GA moved $50m from Giant's balance sheet to purchase "unregistered" shares of Alibaba.
Instead of purchasing the shares directly, as any legitimate business would do, Giant
opted to purchase (if, in fact, the shares were purchased) the "unregistered" shares
through Yunfeng Capital.


What Giant Interactive dubiously failed to disclose to both shareholders and inquiring
regulators is that both Chairman Shi Yuzhu and supposed "independent director" Jason
Jiang are founding partners and directors of Yunfeng Capital. Note that, for obvious
reasons, this related party transaction is not disclosed in any of the company's SEC
disclosures or filings -- an obvious violation of SEC guidelines. Furthermore, transiting the
money through Yunfeng guarantees that the price Giant paid for the shares (if, indeed, it
bought them) would be not be transparent. Investors should question why management
believed Yunfeng, the chairman's private equity firm, was an appropriate vehicle to
purchase shares and even more appropriate not to disclose the relationship. 


Source: Yunfeng's website.


Eighty percent of equity investee losses have come from GA's investment in the
chairman's private equity firm, Yunfeng Capital. Even more concerning, GA's investment
in Yunfeng has experienced significant equity investment losses, which the company hid
from investors by not taking impairment charges. This was enough to garner the attention
of regulators. On July 12, 2012, the SEC, through its correspondence with Giant
Interactive, inquired into the significant equity losses the company had incurred related to
its equity investments and why the company had not taken related impairment charges.
Giant noted that "approximately 80% of the losses from the Company's equity method

investees came from its share of investment losses in Yunfeng Fund." The company
claimed to have paid millions in "structuring fees" to the Chairman's private equity firm. We
find Giant's excuse implausible and shareholders should question where the cash really
went.


If Giant Can Knowingly Deceive the SEC, Why Not Investors?


On July 26, 2012, the SEC probed Giant Interactive regarding the business activities of
the Yunfeng Fund, Giant provided less than transparent answers.


Just a few notable disclosures Giant coincidentally left out:


1. Investors should ask themselves if Giant's intention was to be honest and transparent,
why was Shi Yuzhu and independent director Jason Jiang's related party affiliation to
Yunfeng Capital not disclosed in any of GA's SEC filings, particularly after the SEC
raised pointed questions about the business activities of Yunfeng?


2. Why did Giant's management team feel it was appropriate to invest in "unregistered"
shares of Alibaba (again, if indeed they bought them) through the chairman and
independent directors private equity firm without disclosing the relationship to investors
and regulators?


3. Given GA has a record of fraud and money laundering in the past, how can investors
trust the parties involved given an apparent conflict of interest and the lack of any
proper disclosure to the public? What else is Giant hiding?


One Giant Puzzle - Another Chinese Margin Miracle



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1415016/000114420412041060/filename1.htm

5/22/2018 Giant's Dubious Proposal - Unmasking Questionable Behavior - Giant Interactive Group Inc. (NYSE:GA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1927341-giants-dubious-proposal-unmasking-questionable-behavior 6/18


To start, Giant's corporate operating margins of 61% are spectacular. So great, in fact, that
they seemingly wallop even their Chinese competitors by thousands of basis points -- a
development that should always merit increased scrutiny.


Management claims R&D is the lifeline of their business, yet we find that over the last
three years, Giant has consistently chose to reinvest its capital in speculative off balance
sheet investments that provide no strategic value and are purely financial in nature rather
than on developing their alleged 87% gross margin and 61% operating margin gaming
portfolio. From FY 2010 to FY 2012, Giant spent $28.2m, $36.6m, and $52.5m for an
aggregate of $117.2m. Conversely, Giant has spent $186m on financial investments over
the same period. Yet we find no real income these investments. Like a typical Chinese
fraud, Giant's balance sheet is akin to a personal financing tool for the chairman. This
behavior was so peculiar it even caught the attention of the SEC, which requested that GA
elaborate on these investments and revise its risk factors to include this risk to
shareholders in a July 12, 2013 correspondence.


Shareholders should ask themselves if Giant's gaming business were really growing at
~15%-20% annually with 61% operating margins, why is management so eager to allocate
capital toward financial investments that provide zero strategic value? Does Giant really
generate all of its profits from its gaming business?


Investors should note that Giant operates in a highly competitive, fragmented gaming
market where other competitors have seen their margins converge. Other Chinese leaders
like Shanda Games (NASDAQ:GAME) and Changyou (NASDAQ:CYOU) have largely
struggled amid increased competitive pressures and decelerating revenue growth. For
instance, online game revenues for Changyou grew just 7% in Q3, while Shanda's actually
fell 11%, with no signs of improvement anytime soon.


Speculative Investments Made by Giant


1. $126m in real estate trusts, including property projects in Ningbo and Chengdu that is
managed by China Resources SZITIC Trust Co. Ltd. and property projects managed
by Huaneng Guicheng Trust Co. Ltd.

2. $50m in Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiang's private equity firm Yunfeng Capital.
3. $5.6m in a convertible bond from Minsheng Bank, of which Shi Yuzhu is a major


shareholder and a board member.
4. $4.8m equity investment in Beijing Innovation Work Investment center, an early-stage


China-based internet and technology investment fund.


Independent Director Jason Jiang Will Be Forced to Resign


Independent director" Jason Jiang will be forced to resign from Giant Interactive's board of
directors. Giant's appointed "independent director" is a business partner to Chairman Shi
Yuzhu, through their affiliation with Yunfeng Capital, a private equity firm both parties are
founders and directors of -- a glaring conflict of interest and clear violation of NYSE
independence requirement 303A.2. Note that Jason Jiang was recently put on the "special
independent" committee to evaluate management's recent buyout offer.


Source: Yunfeng's website.


We believe Giant deliberately appointed Jason Jiang to perpetuate the chairman's
misdeeds. Nine months before Giant Interactive moved cash into Yunfeng, then
"Independent Director" David Yu was forced to resign. Giant noted that because Mr. Yu
was an affiliate of Yunfeng, whom the company would do business with in the future, he
would no longer meet NYSE independence requirements.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1927341-giants-dubious-proposal-unmasking-questionable-behavior 8/18


Giant interactive then replaced David Yu with Jason Jiang, whom GA also claimed is an
"independent" director, yet it is clear Jason Jiang is an affiliate of Yunfeng and a friend of
chairman of Shi Yuzhu. To compound matters, Jason Jiang sits on the compensation,
corporate governance, and audit committee -- the committee in charge of reviewing
related party transactions. Since Jason Jiang's appointment, Giant has made questionable
investments in real estate and other speculative investments, which suggest that Jiang's
appointment has perpetuated Shi Yuzhu's use of Giant's balance sheet as his own
personal piggy bank.


Conclusion


GA is trading at an artificially inflated price of nearly $11.25 on a P/E of 13x (vs. peers of
~9x). The only reason for this elevated price is the hope of an MBO, and absent those
hopes GA shareholders would certainly be left with a weakening business trading at levels
far lower than the $7 Chairman Shi Yuzhu liquidated 6% of his Giant Stake for in 2013.
We believe the issues covered will encourage even the most speculative private equity
affiliate to strongly reconsider risking their investor's capital in GA. We believe Barings will
walk away from this bad business, as it has from so many other flawed U.S.-listed
Chinese companies in the past.


We believe It is important to get the entire story and give the company a chance to explain
itself, thus we have made repeated attempts to address our concerns with management
and investor relations to no avail. Ultimately, Giant Interactive shareholders will be forced
to look at their promise ring with wonder, doubting if it was ever anything more than a
cubic zirconia.


Giant's VIE structure demands that shareholders have full faith in the integrity of the
chairman, because it is Shi Yuzhu who ultimately owns and controls the operating
business in China. We believe that Giant's chairman has irrevocably broken the trust of
shareholders, rendering, in our view, the company's shares only as valuable as the
chairman's apparent respect for his fiduciary duties.

I can't comment on a number of the points made, but the fact that the proposal is non-binding is not unusual. In fact, it
is standard when an insider proposes to buy a company that it is initially non-binding. The BOD of directors will not
enter a binding transaction without a review by outside advisors under the auspices of a Special Committee. I'm
curious to hear comments on the other points made.

i think your article raises valid questions -- among them, where is the line between legitimate leverage of personal
assets and entering into a series of fraudulent transactions at the detriment of shareholders?


clearly there are serious questions here and, personally, I have felt the 'offer' wasn't legitimate in the first place. If
China is serious about being a player on world equity markets, this must be dealt with in a more transparent way than
is currently being done.


I thank the author for this opine and the data presented. It very much creates a pause in the cause of GA. Something

Author’s reply »  This money laundering accusations alone should worry any legitimate investor -
http://bit.ly/1bEq6Ln. We don't believe Baring's will risk their LP capital on an investment as speculative as GA. As we
noted, once Barings walks away Shi Yuzhu will have to find alternative financing, which we believe will be harder to
do. Furthermore, the lawyers who were already reviewing the merits of the deal now know that Shi Yuzhus
"undisclosed" related parties were responsible for reviewing managements offer. A clear conflict of interest.


From the article: http://bit.ly/1bEq6Ln 
"Commenting on the fraud, a consumer rights activist told the Dahe Daily reporter that Giant had served as a money
laundering platform for a long time, as customers' money was transferred to the company's accounts when they made
online transactions.

I noted some of these findings to other investors. China is just a landmine. Shi Yuzhu has a terrible reputation as a
manager. Im sure lawsuits from some of the lawyers who were originally reviewing the buyout offer will have a field
day with Giant now. I cant imagine Barings not walking as well, they seem pretty conservative. Itll be interesting to see
how this thing fairs at the open on Monday

I really liked the article -- because I really hate scumbags.


If you thought of this company as a family, Shi Yuzhu would be the equivalent of the sleazy second cousin who
smokes, wears sleeveless undershirts out in public, lives in a trailer park, and molests his 12 year old stepdaughter.
From what you describe and document, he strikes me as the type of person who would knock down a little old lady
and snatch her purse if he thought he could get away with it.


When you have cesspool bottom slime like Shi Yuzhu, the best thing you can possibly do is expose them to a lot of
daylight. That tends to kill them. Bottom slime cannot prosper if you have transparency and daylight.


Thanks Ottoman Bay for doing your part.

The author is too naive to draw the conclusion. No matter what, Shi Yuzhu still holds rest of his 89% holdings in GA.
He and Alibaba's Ma Yun are super close friends. Jason Jiang, the founder of Focus Media (FMCN) just privatize the
FMCN. Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiang are good friends too and they win the battle against Muddy Water. GA only counts
for a small percentage holdings of Shi Yuzhu's equity. These powerful business man won't risk their reputation on GA.
It is just not worthy it at all.

I bought GA today after this paper published.  
The author of this paper do not know this company.

Is this a short now? I did not notice $GA drop like NQ, the allegations seem legit and concerning to the stock holder
community in general.

That's it. I'm bailing. I am not sitting around and waiting for answers to the articles accusations. I'll take my 46% profit
and run and not look back. Say bye-bye. Bye-bye.

in Nov!. Who are you kidding?

That's easy to explain qmjava. Instead of waiting for 11.75 a share, I bailed at the market closing price on

I am trying to understand OB's argument on the independence of one of the directors' Jason Jiang. According to 20-F,
page 29, it says below. Isn't it something GA can argue as a line of defense.


"As a “controlled company,” we are exempt from certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance
requirements, which may result in our independent directors not having as much influence as they would if we were
not a controlled company.


As of March 31, 2013, Yuzhu Shi, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, and his daughter Ms. Jing Shi
beneficially owned approximately 54.82% of the total voting rights in our company. As a result, we are a “controlled
company” as defined under Section 303A of the Listed Company Manual of the NYSE. So long as we remain a
controlled company as defined under that rule, we are exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance
requirements, including:


• 
that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;

• 
that we have a corporate governance and nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;
and


• 
that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.


Although we voluntarily comply with the compensation committee, and the corporate governance and nominating
committee requirements of the NYSE, we do not currently voluntarily comply with the requirement that a majority of
our board of directors consist of independent directors. As a result of our reliance on the “controlled company”
exemption, our independent directors might not have the same degree of influence on the decisions of our board of
directors that they otherwise would. "

Come on, we are waiting for lower price to buy the stock. Please try harder and offer more material evidences.
Current evidences are ...actually too naive to drag the price down. Come on, modify your methodology, do not make
simple mistakes such as comparing the margin of GA with Tencent and other companies. You must know the
difference between the self-developed games and franchised games, right? You must know that Tencent is not a pure
game company, right?

I think it's a fruitless short. SEC has better time chasing big hedge funds fooling investors with 4/40 fee structure by
doing insider trading than chasing a stock which has MADE investors money and is interested in getting out of the US
market for good so SEC wont' even have to worry about it in the future. The only guys who are unhappy are the short
or the one who got shaken and sold because of chairman's sale at $7. On the other hand, if investing in some other
side projects for better yield are considered fraud, then you should argue why China Mobile spent almost $5Billion
buying a 20% stake in a Shanghai bank. Would you short that as well? The point is simple. Chairman and so is Baring
want to privatize this thing and relist in another market such as Hong Kong which people are more crazy on Internet
names like Tencent and Alibaba.

Author’s reply »  Wow - Yunfeng Capital has removed Chairman Shi Yuzhu from the Yunfeng website to hide his
affiliation with the private equity firm.


Luckily OB, took a screenshot of the website for this article. Again, another example of a fraudulent company erasing
evidence. You can compare our screenshot to the new website for yourselves.

Perhaps Jack Ma is too busy trying to figure out where he should list his stock than trying to update his website for
OB. And he finally did it at OB's request. As one can see, many other faces are removed at the same time. As they
are LP, money comes and goes. They are not GP. Try again OB.

OB, perhaps you were looking at an old website and it just happened they haven't updated all the profile for awhile.
Jack Ma is too busy going around trying to figure out where he can list his Alibaba. You can see many other faces got
removed at the same time. Not just Jason and Shi. Maybe you have just prompted them to update their website with
more recent info.


06 Jan 2014, 08:23 AM

If OB thinks GA is overly inflated at 13x PE, then he better looks beyond US listed stocks and look at a recent HK
game IPO called Boyaa Interactive. The stock was oversubscribed 800 times back in November and listed at a 30%
gain on first day. It's trading at 23x PE and still going higher. As Bruce Lee once said in "Enter The Dragon", "Don't
think. FEEEEEEEEL! It's like a finger pointing at the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the
heavenly glory! " As of why chairman likes to sell before he buys, I guess your guess is as good as mine. Maybe he
attempted to shake off those loose hands and made a low ball bid only to find out smarter guys like Baring or other
PE firms want to step in to join the party and try to materialize the whole grand scheme thru some LBO type deal. For
those who are short, be careful. Until it's binding with a heavy termination fee and there's no Go-shopping around,
anyone can still come in to bid higher. Maybe a bid of $12-$13 is being entertained somewhere and you will end up
saying "Oh NO".

I don't know what is the fuzz of shorting a name that SEC is probably happy to see them getting out of the US market
through a proper binding offer with some Chinese money so all the US mum and pop retails can happily get out
instead of more scandals and a big drop on the name and everyone jumps up and down and SEC end up wasting
time answering complaints. 
If one is arguing about corporate governance in China using US standard, I think they are barking at the wrong creek.
It's almost like lobbying China human rights in front of Guantanamo Bay.


If I am not wrong, Baring is involved in buying 11.8mio shares @ $9.79 on 25th Nov through a share purchase
agreement with Shi and Vogel. And if the "Going-Private" transaction occurs within one year and Baring is not part of
the buyer consortium, Baring will have to pay Vogel the difference between the Purchase Price and the Going-Private
Price. (from latest 13D). So Baring just like to get themselves to a "Lose/Lose" situation? If people trashes the stock,
the deal got called off, their investment is down the drain. And if the stock goes higher and they are not part of it, they
still have end up paying the difference between (11.75 - 9.79) times the number of shares which they are obligated to.
I assume these Baring guys after learning from the previous mistakes that OB had mentioned, would have read all the
annual filings like OB would have read plus more dil diligence info in China before making such announcement. They
are PE firms and I am sure they have private investigators around fishing all the dirt of these China guys before
partnering with them for anything. I am not saying these guys are clean. Question is how dirty can they get? Small
dirty or Very dirty. If it were a China PE firm making a proposal, I would be a bit more scared and don't even bother
looking at it.


Also, on the point on the cash being deployed in investment not related to Games development such as real estates
trust, I guess this is China. Everything is "Relationship" driven. You do me a favor, I do you one. It's almost
questioning why China Mobile bought a 20% stake in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank for $5Billion. Would you
hence say China Mobile is a fraud then?


Just for FYI, Boyaa Interactive International (434.HK) which is a game IPO done last year in November was
oversubscribed 800 times and is up 60% since IPO and still going higher. Still having the same 60% Gross Margin
profit.


At the end of the day, All Chairman and Baring care is: Can I get this stock out of US and relist in Hong Kong at higher
multiple?

Barings will walk away from this deal. Longs will be left with a business worth far below the $7 the chairman
sold his stake. Your upside is only 11.75.

I dont think that is accurate. If you go to this link - Yunfeng details out all of the "co-founders".

I dont know what is going on but its pretty fishy.


" Yunfeng is the result of combining the Chinese first names of Mr. Jack MA (Yun), Chairman of Alibaba, and
Mr. David YU (Feng), Founder of Target Media. In addition, there are more than 10 other co-founders,
including Mr. Yu Zhu SHI, Chairman of Giant interactive group, Mr. Yong Hao LIU, Chairman of New Hope
Group, Mr. Guo Jun SHEN, Chairman of Intime Investment, Mr. Yu Suo... "

Spartan Investors
Good work OB. Ive been in and out of GA for some time and have completely lost confidence in management.


I also found GAs response pretty terrible/skeptical and it appears wall street agrees, given the stock didn't respond at
all to managements comments.


GA is the only reported 87% gross margin, 61% operating margin business that no other suitors have an interest in
buying. Also, the lack of enthusiasm for this deal by the Chairman is very surprising. Shi Yuzhu diluting his stake is a
HUGE red flag, this is in complete contrast from what you see in a management buyout. Typically, the goal of MBOs
is to strengthen the managers' interest in the success of the company. The Chairman "diversifying his personal
holdings" doesn't give investors confidence that he believes there is real value here.


Furthermore, part of the original posters argument is that management hid Shi Yuzhus relationship to YF for a reason.
Its clear they did not care to address that either. Also, correct me if im wrong, but this is an absolute contradiction.


"Neither Mr. Jiang nor Mr. Shi is himself a limited partner investor in the Yunfeng e-Commerce Funds invested in by
Giant. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Shi do, however, have a small indirect interest, i.e., 0.52% and 0.92% respectively, in the
Yunfeng e-Commerce Funds by virtue of Yunfeng Fund L.P."


Thus, investors will have to take their chances on a binary event – either the going private deal is funded and closes,
or it does not, and the stock falls to mid to low single digits. There is really no other outcome. Shorts have an
asymmetrical risk/reward while longs just have risk.

I'm thinking this isn't an investment: It is an I.Q. test.


It is a simple "yes" or "no" question, the one they give to the people who first demonstrate that they can dress
themselves. If they get it wrong, they still belong in supervised living conditions. If they get it right, well, it was a pretty
easy question . . . . they still have to prove they know how to safely cross the street or they still might not be ready to
be on their own.
