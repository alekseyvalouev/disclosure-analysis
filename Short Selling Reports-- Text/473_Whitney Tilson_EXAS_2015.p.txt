Why Exact Sciences Is A Great Short At $10
Oct. 7, 2015 9:46 AM ET169 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force’s Colorectal Cancer Screening Draft
Recommendation issued yesterday is devastating for Exact Sciences' only product,
Cologuard.


I think this is the beginning of the end for the company.


My price target for the stock a year from now is $3, so I shorted more yesterday.


The shares of one of my largest short positions (~3%), Exact Sciences, crashed by more
than 46% yesterday to close at $9.98 after the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force's
Colorectal Cancer Screening Draft Recommendation listed Exact's sole product,
Cologuard, a poop-in-a-bucket screening test, as an "Alternative Test" rather than a
recommended one, and said numerous damning things such as:


The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the impact of screening with FIT-DNA
[Cologuard] on cancer incidence, morbidity, quality of life, or mortality.
Evidence on the optimal screening interval, if any, is lacking.
A theoretical concern about FIT-DNA is whether its use might lead to more frequent
and invasive followup testing in persons who are not at increased risk of colorectal
cancer because of patient or clinician concerns about abnormal DNA results.
There are no data that evaluate how to implement FIT-DNA into a longitudinal
colorectal cancer screening program.
…empiric evidence is lacking on appropriate followup of abnormal results, making it
difficult to accurately bound the potential net benefit of this screening test.


I haven't written about Exact Sciences prior to now because it isn't a fraud/scam or doing
nefarious things like so many of the stocks I've written about on Seeking Alpha (see Chris
DeMuth's summary of my calls on WRLD, LRN, LL, IOC, DDD and UNIS). Exact has a
real product that addresses a very serious problem, the low screening rate for colorectal
cancer, the second-leading U.S. cancer killer. Nevertheless, I felt (and still feel) that it's a
great short because the test has significant drawbacks that will severely limit its adoption
and, in light of this, the valuation is absurd.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3555646-exact-sciences-great-short-10 2/39


While I've never published an article about it before now, I did pitch this stock as my
favorite short at the Robin Hood Investors Conference a year ago when it was at $24.22
(click here to see my slide presentation). In light of the 59% drop in the stock since then, it
might appear to have been an easy short, but it was anything but. I first shorted it at
$14.22 in April 2014 and watched it soar over the subsequent 15 months to a peak in late
June of $32.85. This was extremely painful, but I was confident in my analysis and didn't
cover a single share - in fact, I added to the position on a number of occasions, most
recently just a couple of weeks ago at $19.57 - so it's nice to see my analysis (and
stubbornness) pay off.


Why I Shorted More


Now I have a high-class problem: what to do when an investment works? While it can be
dangerous adding to a short position that's already fallen a lot, it can also be highly
profitable if the stock continues to plunge, as my experience with Lumber Liquidators
demonstrates.


The only rational way to think about this is to pretend like I never had a position and was
looking at this stock for the first time today. In the case of Exact Sciences, I fail to see how
a "single product" diagnostic company, whose test just got body slammed by a highly
influential group, could be worth anything close to its current market cap of nearly $1
billion.


I expect that the USPSTF report, which could hardly have been more damning, will cause
what little demand there is for the test to plunge (what physician is going to prescribe an
"Alternative Test" when far cheaper, established "Recommended Screening Tests" are
available?) and many good salespeople to flee (one friend, who knows many Exact
salespeople, tells me that the sales force is in a state of chaos, hardly surprising since
most of their options are now underwater). As a result, I think the company is likely to miss
analysts' revenue estimates by a country mile. Specifically, Canaccord and Wedbush, in
their latest reports, predict 2016 revenues of $112 million and $113 million, respectively,
which I think is laughable.


In Q2, Exact's revenues were $8.1 million, which analysts expect rose to $12.6 million in
the just-ended Q3. I have no view on whether Exact will meet this number when it reports
earnings at the end of this month, but I have a strong opinion that the company has almost
no chance of meeting analysts' consensus going forward revenue estimates of $18.2

million in Q4 and $139.8 million next year. In fact, I think Q3 may well prove to be the peak
and that the company's revenues will be well less than half what analysts are currently
forecasting.


Enormous Cash Burn


If I'm right about a massive revenue miss, this, by itself, will crush the stock - but in
addition, I think it will be difficult for Exact to reduce the enormous cost structure it's built
up in anticipation of Cologuard's launch. As this chart shows, the company has been
burning an average of $37 million over each of the last three quarters:


Quarterly Free Cash Flow Over the Past Three Years


Note: Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditure. 
Source: S&P Capital IQ


Assuming Exact burned a similar amount in Q3, then it has roughly $350 million in net
cash remaining (nearly $4/share, thanks to a very well-timed secondary offering in July at
$25.50), which gives the company some breathing room. But investors who think this cash
provides much downside protection for the stock are mistaken, in my opinion, because it
will be needed to cover the company's large ongoing losses and thus will never be
returned to investors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3555646-exact-sciences-great-short-10 4/39


Further adding to Exact's potential problems are two agreements with the state of
Wisconsin and the city of Madison. Earlier this year, the company struck a deal with the
Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in which Exact will receive $9 million in tax
credits, but only "by investing $26,264,000 in capital expenditures in Wisconsin and
creating 758 new full-time positions - with an average wage of $24.47 per hour - in the
state by December 31, 2020." Additionally, Exact is on the verge of signing an agreement
with the city of Madison whereby the company would receive a $12 million grant to build
its new headquarters in a downtown development. In exchange, however, Mayor Paul
Soglin notes that "Exact Sciences will provide financial guarantees to bring at least 400
jobs to the headquarters facility and repay the city if those jobs are not created or if the
jobs are relocated from the facility in the future." These agreements will make it very
expensive for Exact to downsize, should that be necessary.


Thank You, Analysts


As Exact reports the dismal sales and enormous losses I expect over the next year and
the stock continues to collapse, I think analysts will eventually throw in the towel, just as
they did with Lumber Liquidators. For now, though, they're in denial: of the three reports I
read Monday, by the analysts at Jefferies, Canaccord and Wedbush, not one downgraded
the stock and they generally said positive things such as:


We'd be buyers below our price target of $18;
Initial reaction appears overdone… we continue to view Cologuard as a potentially
game-changing test; and
We expect volatility, but reiterate our BUY rating.


Tuesday morning, the Canaccord analysts issued a new report in which they took down
their numbers, but reiterated their BUY recommendation and wrote: "With EXAS' stock
down ~45% following the news, but with EXAS owning a great test across a large sales
force with strong commercialization intact, and Medicare unaffected (~60% of payors), we
think the risk/reward is to the upside today."


I am grateful to these analysts for propping up the stock enough for me to add to my short
position above $11 Tuesday. (Hat tip to the two analysts who've consistently been spot-on:
Dr. Cathy Reese at Empire Asset Management and Bryan Brokmeier at Maxim Group).


My Price Target is $3

I think Exact's stock will trade down over the next year to a slight premium to cash (which I
estimate will be about $2.35/share a year from now), which would put the stock around $3,
a very nice return on my short from current levels.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is

showing the huge sequential quarterly testing gains.

Not sure about your valuation. Doctors will order ColoGuard if patient wants it and insurance pays. I would insist on
this test rather than a colonoscopy

I think many people think as you do and many more will agree to be screened that will not go through
colonoscopy.

PSalerno, Contributor
Most people do not get screened at all, and among those screened many do not want colonscopy, 8 million of
them are doing fecal tests hoping to be negative and to avoid colonscopy. Some of them will shift to
Cologuard because of its better sensitivity.

Money may also be behind the USPSTF report. Colonoscopies bring in a lot of money. Colonoscopies are also not as
accurate as gastroenterologist would like you to believe.


Of course Cologuard is an alternative test, i.e., it is an alternative to colonoscopy.


07 Oct 2015, 10:58 AM


Vivian Embro
Currently, a one-time test Cologuard was 92% sensitive for cancer. Research also showed that the false positive rate
was about 13%.


News article: MONDAY, Aug. 11, 2014 -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved a new at-
home, DNA-based stool test that screens for colorectal cancer with more than 90 percent accuracy.


The decision was based on an FDA panel's unanimous decision in March that the benefits of Exact Sciences Corp.'s
Cologuard test outweighed its risks.


Consider colonoscopy - Depending on the clinic and physician, a colonoscopy might have a lower rate of success.
The Annals of Internal Medicine, says the colonoscopy is much less accurate than anyone expected. Colonoscopies
are still a highly effective cancer screening test, gastroenterologists say, but instead of preventing 90 percent of
cancers, as some doctors have told patients, they actually might prevent more like 60 to 70 percent. Also, a
colonoscopy can be dangerous, because problems associated with the procedure are not exactly rare.


As techniques for sDNA are refined, the Cologuard test will become even more accurate. Of course, one downside of
Cologuard is all that money that will never flow into the hands of health professionals.


Additionally, side effects and risks from Cologuard are not that uncommon. (Unfortunately), I can not find the journal
article that lists the negative events by percentage.

Vivian Embro
My mistake. I stated:


Additionally, side effects and risks from Cologuard are not that uncommon. (Unfortunately), I can not find the
journal article that lists the negative events by percentage


It should read: Additionally, side effects and risks from Colonoscopy are not that uncommon. (Unfortunately), I
can not find the journal article that lists the negative events by percentage.


Sorry about that.

I'd be careful with this one. Lot of politics at play. First, the USPSTF "draft" (key word) recommendation is just that - a
draft. These guys have financial incentive to recommend colonoscopy procedure and they are getting ready to be
exposed! EXAS will also have a say in the draft and can change the wording (and if this happens, the stock will again
soar), and meanwhile, the wording in this draft is much more positive than the previous - where Cologuard procedure
not even classified as useful - and now it is 'alternative'... actually this is moving in the right direction! 
I am not long on this stock (although considering it under 10) but I sure as heck would not be short. You are messing
with politics. The first poster on this thread that mentions about his cousin not pooping in a cup is a joke - he'd rather
have a colonoscopy? This story has not ended IMO.

User 24503613
The USPTF monkey academics put the screws to Cologuard and not the innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs,
investors who believe that this test will TRANSFORM into multiple products. Butt snakes' days are about over for
screening...but their lobbying interests are at play here. Guidelines from the government = politics. Also, did anyone
notice the errors to specificity in the monkey models? Positive investor sentiment is broken. Will it return?


07 Oct 2015, 11:49 AM

I was a big fan of EXAS and made money on the long side. Then the deep six trial results came out and it was clear
the Cologuard was running on empty. I shorted at 10 but covered at 11, again at 12 and covered at 13. Then it went to
32.


Go figure!


It was fun watching all the subsequent hype and reading the press releases over the years as the CEO tried to tap-
dance media-spin around a reality that should have been obvious to all medical professionals with clinical experience.


However, you should not discount the Pancreatic cancer DNA test. That gives the company value and should become
a "front-line" test if a doctor suspects that condition- notoriously difficult to diagnose and usually is after it is too late.


07 Oct 2015, 11:50 AM


Vivian Embro
You still have to realize Cologuard by its very nature is more accurate than a colonoscopy. There are also less
adverse effects from a Cologuard test.


EXAS also has an excellent pipeline of non invasive products. They are developing tests for Esophageal, pancreatic
and lung cancer.

"You still have to realize Cologuard by its very nature is more accurate than a colonoscopy."


as an M.D., I feel compelled to point out to possible readers who may need colon cancer screening someday
that your statement is absolutely, 100%, in every possible context, wrong.

There are no adverse affects from a Cologuard test. What, a possible paper cut when sealing the box?


07 Oct 2015, 05:03 PM


GlibSonoran
While it's true that there's no "evidence" that ColoGuard is more accurate than colonoscopy, you have to
realize that given the method of assessing Colorectal Cancer test accuracy it would be nearly impossible for
any test to be seen as more accurate than colonoscopy.


Why? Because colonoscopy is the reference for assessing the accuracy of the other tests. All these studies
compare the test's results to the results of a colonoscopy, and the colonoscopy is then assumed to be 100%
accurate and definitive, even though we know it's not.


If a molecular screening test like Cologuard were more Sensitive than a colonoscopy (highly likely since
Colonoscopies are visual exams highly dependent on the skill of the examiner and how well the patient
cleansed their colon beforehand) by current study methods it just would appear that the test just had a lower
specificity i.e. more False positives (sound familiar Cologuard?). This is because the study's reference
colonoscopy wouldn't be able to confirm the cancer/precancerous tissue that was actually present.


Also, as noted in the USPSPF draft, the biggest and only risk of "harm" with any of this testing is undergoing a
colonscopy itself.


From the draft: 
"The harms of stool-based tests primarily result from adverse events associated with colonoscopy performed
for the followup of positive screening results...


Colonoscopy has both indirect and direct harms. Harms may be caused by the bowel cleanout prior to the
procedure (e.g., dehydration and electrolyte imbalances), the sedation used during the procedure (e.g.,
cardiovascular events), or the procedure itself (e.g., infection, colonic perforations, or bleeding)."

What a fantastic and most central point that really has not gotten the recommendations it deserves.


This issue has been overlooked (or consciously ignored) repeatedly by all those who tout the supposed
infallibility of so-called <<The Gold Standard>>


Our own doc takes that stance whenever he launches into his standardized <<You need a colonoscopy talk>>
to new patients.


Odds are most internists and GPs likely do so as well because that is what they have been told since med
school and therefore it is what they BELIEVE (barring exposure to new testing technique the System's
Gatekeepers are now pushing back against).


That resistance even though their <<standard>> is clearly deeply flawed inasmuch as it doesn't usually detect
pre-cancers


Stepping back on this, the genuflection to <<The Gold Standard>> is, at its heart, nothing more than circular
reasoning but with the very real consequence of unnecessary expense and most importantly , unneeded of
risk to patients via unnecessary colonoscopies for all the reasons that have been cited.


For those familiar with the Philosophy of Science literature about how change and advancement occurs in
science, the core concept centers around <<Paradigm Change>> and how challenges to orthodox
AUTHORITIES and BELIEFS occur within scientific pursuits.


And that is what is really going on here.


If interested, see a small book <<The Structure of Scientific Revolutions>> by the late U of Chicago prof
Thomas Kuhn. His descriptions of revolution in scientific research closely parallel what we see here in this
<<fight>> between different factions in the Cologuard vs invasive colonoscopy controversy.


Only here all that is exacerbated because there are both egos and lots of patient fees involved.


Thus I wouldn't be surprised that many patients who want Cologuard; who understand its superior benefits
may well have to fight tooth and nail with their docs to get them to write the script.


That is likely in no small part because the doc sees that not as an informed patient who seeks the least-
invasive, least-risky test first, but simply as a challenge to his/her professional education and <<superior
wisdom>>.


Albeit wisdom perhaps based on dated concepts --and ones an overworked doc likely doesn't even have the
time (or motivation) to fully investigate.


All this might and will quite naturally lead hackle-raising ego-brusing conflict between informed patients and
their <<medical professional>>

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3555646-exact-sciences-great-short-10 11/39


I dare say many who have written highly-informed posts here know more about the nuances of these
arguments--about false positives vs false negative, etc. -- in the context of this specific test than do their docs.


So not only vested interests about money are involved but, too, the very real potential for conflict arising
between patient vs health provider's knowledge base and conflicting egos.


Yet another example of the ongoing question in the Age Of The Internet as to <<Who is the doctor here?.


Those docs with thinnest skins and most massive egos are not likely well-disposed to be challenged on what
they see as their sole claim to expertise.


So maybe the FDA should include a Black Box Warning with this product:


CAUTION your insistence to have this test performed vs a colonoscopy may be hazardous to your ongoing
relationship with your medical provider..


Sad, but probably true...

I'd buy some put options to short the stock but I didn't get a fill yesterday on my bid. Nice call Tilson!

There are over ten million FITs done annually at a low compliance rate which limits effectiveness. Cologuard at a
higher compliance rate every 3 years (or two it seems USPSTF is open to after further study) makes far more sense.
Consider that it is already covered by CMS, so doctors will gravitate towards ordering Cologuard over FIT since they
know folks won't do the FIT every year. Here's why:


http://1.usa.gov/1L6NrIj


http://bit.ly/1L6NrIk


It is completely disingenuous to keep going to the "ick" factor since FIT is a worse experience. Are you aware that FIT
requires poo handling?


Given the high sensitivity that Cologuard has, many people will probably opt for it than colonoscopy over time knowing
that worst case is they get a colonoscopy if there is a positive which means about 88% likely they have cancer. So
what if the test has slightly lower specificity, better to be super sensitive with a few extra false positives with the only
"negative" outcome being having to go to the "gold standard."


The USPSTF report is hardly damning. FOBT was REMOVED, while sDNA-FIT and CT were added. With what is
apparently an A rating from USPSTF, that brings mandated insurance coverage from age 50 to 75 (65-75 already
covered by CMS) opening up twice as much market for the Exact Sciences. I am very confident that USPSTF will
shed clarity soon, perhaps by adding a word to their document, i.e. Alternative become Recommended Alternatives.


The asymmetric upside with EXAS is that Cologuard starts to replace colonoscopy, especially if moved to every other
year, which is consistent with how often most people go to the doctor and do tests. This could very well happen given
that sensitivity for the Cologuard (which is improving) and Colonoscopy are very similar. Again, so what if there are a
few extra false positives with the "negative" result being "gold standard" colonoscopies. I think UHC will consider this
possibility as it would save them money. UHC has been looking for lower reimbursement and interestingly, language

I have respect for Whitney Tilson, who is also a layman. However, I feel he is wrong about Cologuard and Exact
Sciences. Clearly, he does not understand how or why the USPSTF report was written as it was. In fact, when you
read the report, they state a colonoscopy can be dangerous and essentially praised Cologuard, but of course, they
can not show bias.


Yes, Cologuard is an alternative to colonoscopy.....but what's new?


07 Oct 2015, 02:41 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Cologuard is more an alternative to FIT than to colonscopy. Only for those colonscopies with weak indication
Cologuard can be considered as a possible alternative because it is less risky and painful.

Think it over and stay healthy:


"Another important issue to consider is that the USPSTF's recommendations aren't always widely adopted by the
medical community, evinced by its controversial recommendation against PSA testing for prostate cancer and
recommendation that mammography screening be optional."

Cologuard can be considered the test of choice for those falling within the guidelines established by the manufacturer.
A colonoscopy is indicated for those who do not fall within Cologuard's guidelines or for those receiving a results from
a Cologuard test warranting further evaluation.

Good call, Whitney. All of our shorts are small these days but we also shorted yesterday morning.


This is a test that private insurers do not want to cover. Why? Because the people getting this test are, for the most
part, people who decline the gold-standard test (colonoscopy). So the insurance company can either spend nothing
on those patients, or they can spend $500 for this overpriced test, and then if the test is positive, the patient is going
to get a colonoscopy, and there will be many, many extra colonoscopies for false positive tests.


If USPSTF had given this test an A or a B rating in spite of its marginal receiver-operator curve, then insurance
companies would have pretty much been forced to cover it. Same for a strong recommendation from American
College of Gastroenterology. In the absence of those, insurance companies will be loathe to cover.


And given that the test isn't super-accurate, and involves poop, that is a lot to overcome. I don't see how they can
possibly sell enough of these to be profitable.


As a doc, I'm glad it's out there as an option for select patients, but as an investor, this is a short.

don't the insurance companies still have to pay for cancer care for those who don't test? Or, are you

USPSTF did give Cologuard an "A" rating from what I can tell. I think clarification will come soon enough that
they simply created a new group for newer tests that need further longitudinal study.

Cologuard IS "super-accurate" and FIT involves poop too. In fact, FIT is quite "ickier" than Cologuard.


07 Oct 2015, 04:29 PM


Biotech Vet, Contributor
Actually colonoscopy is considered the "gold standard" for one main reason. Studies have shown that it
lowers CRC mortality. However what many people, including many doctors, don't know is that there has never
been published a prospective randomized controlled trial of how well Colonoscopy actually performs with
respect to sensitivity and specificity. A trial is underway in Europe (involving multiple colonoscopies - probably
hard to recruit for that) but none have been published. In the mean time a number of very large recent studies
have shown that colonoscopy is NOT a very golden standard - especially with respect to detection of
adenomas. This is important because there is a growing appreciation of the large numbers of interval cancers
that arise from people who just had a colonoscopy 3-5 years ago. It has long been known that there is a
strong dependence on adenoma detection rate with withdrawal time in colonoscopies - with endoscopists who
have long withdrawal times (>8.3 min) detecting far more than those with short withdrawal times. Further a
recent study in Gastroenterology evaluating highly experienced endoscopists ( a minimum of 100
colonoscopies performed) showed that even with long withdrawal times there was a huge disparity in
adenoma detection rate - a fact also recently confirmed in a very large meta-analysis published in JAMA (one
man's adenoma is another's insignificant finding). What does this mean? It means that if we assume that
adenoma incidence is relatively constant across US and European screening populations then a large
number of colonoscopies are missing pre-cancers. You had better hope you had a good endoscopist. 
Colonoscopies are performed and interpreted by humans and they are not uniform in quality and we are now
starting to learn just how bad some of them are. Cologuard has the advantage of being interpreted by a
machine with the uniformity of quality standards that inhere to such a technique.

with respect to paying for cancer care for those who don't test, given that the average length of insurance with

switched insurance carriers once or twice.

if Cologuard were the best thing since sliced bread, this would not matter. it would be in the standards and it
would be widely used. but the fact of the matter is that it is a pretty marginal test from a sensitivity/specificity
standpoint, which is why it wont catch on in the absence of uspstf or ACG pushing its adoption.

Tilson has an history of mistakes as he shorted at 14 before the stock hit 32, but what is important is that the

It is interesting that the author invests more in the opinion of the USPSTF, the same folks that brought you "no

Clinic and other well respected medical institutions who have endorsed Cologuard without reservation. 
The credibility of the former and a dime will get them a 10 cents cup of coffee; the

In Cologuard and related screening products there is a potential to reduce the flow of funds now accruing to
all the vested interests favoring the status quo.


And who might they be? Let us count them:


Docs referring to and endoscopists performing colonoscopies; anesthesiologists; hospital accountants &
administrators concerned with maintaining patient volume and a full house; nursing staff, OR and floor; device
makers; drug makers, bill coders, and more.


So why any surprise the system is still touting colonoscopies as <<THE Gold Standard>>> ?


In fact I've heard several docs using the same words and arguments as has Aristides Capital (above). All as if
reading from a widely-approved and widely-accepted script and so one that is accepted w/o question.


But apparently, despite those assertions there are, to date, a lack of independent confirmation of that <<Gold
Standard>> tout...At least per the highly informative post above by <<Biotech Vet>> (date & time-stamped 7

I disagree, there is no conflict of interest between Cologuard and colonscopy, as they are complementary and
Cologuard will not decrease the number of colonscopies, just select better the patients.  
The economic conflict is with the insurers.

The contention that it selects "better" patients for colonoscopy implies that other patients will not get
colonoscopies, so your conclusion is not consistent with the premises.


12 Oct 2015, 10:37 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
We do not understand each other. Of course there are many who do not get colonscopy and many who do
get colonscopy. Cologuard can identify those who are at higher risk better than FIT. This is the utility and this
is why I told that Cologuard is not in competition with colonscopy. Eventually some who did not get
colonscopy will be more keen to get one. It depends on people's will to get screened. My forecast is not
changed a tad after this decision that for me is logical and expected.

In other words, there is no competition neither conflict of interest between Cologuard and colonscopies
because Cologuard will identify more positives compared to FIT, so the number of colonscopies will be higher.
This can be partially compensated by the fact that some of those at average risk could choose to get
cologuard instead of the more risky and painfull colonscopy.

PSalerno, Contributor
The investment depends on the scientific basis of the test. The stock price is irrelevant, as the market does
not understand this business. If the CMS maintain the reimbursement many doctors will prescribe Cologuard.
We do not know how many, what is important now is the number of the test. How many of the 8 millions doing
fecal tests will shift to Cologuard ? Some of them will be reimbursed, and USPTF acknowledged that
Cologuard is more sensitive and potentially can identify more cancers, but the problem is the cost, even for
the higher number of colonscopies. I do not see a quick recovery in the stock price, neither a short squeeze,
but a slow one.


14 Oct 2015, 12:36 PM

If you consider the product as good as a colonoscopy just for comparison, in the long run, the insurance
companies will have to bend over and pay. It's just like any new surgical procedure that replaces an old
one....I think the product needs to be cost effective which it should be a reachable goal within a certain time
frame.


But, all things equal, is the company profitable enough on the long run to be a standing alone business? Or,
it's better fitted to be a division of another company? If you're bleeding cash for a while, you need to have
answer for these questions quickly.

There is no substitute for colonscopy. Cologuard will need more colonscopy than FIT or gFOBT. The problem
is that had Cologuard been recommended, the insurers would be forced to pay and for them the price is too
high. They are a powerful lobby in USA. If medicare will keep paying I think enough doctors will order

Strange decision for something that seemed like a lock on approval.


08 Oct 2015, 10:44 AM


Tetragrammaton
The USPSTF Draft Recommendation in its present form appears to be pushing the absurd idea that positive results
from "poop on a card" (cheap, simple, quick, but not very accurate) should be followed by (old-fashioned , rather
expensive) sigmoidoscopy rather than current state-of-the-art (quite expensive, much better) colonoscopy.


In other words, detecting a suspected bleeding polyp or cancer should be followed by a doctor peering up a
sigmoidoscope, which can see up only half of the colon and may not have the capability of excising polyps, rather
than a colonoscopy procedure with a modern-day instrument which can visualize the whole thing plus a piece of the
small intestine. (Plus, of course, pre-cancerous polyps can be removed immediately). This recommendation leaves
part of the colon unexamined, and defies common sense.


I hope the public comments will help straighten out some of the thinking here, and place the EXAS test in a more
appropriate context. In many situations the the EXAS test, at around $300, is a direct, quick, safe and comfortable
substitute for a colonoscopy costing $1,000-5,000 (price depending on doctor, hospital, insurance, etc.). The
possibility that the recommendation will be promptly modified within a few weeks could certainly put the shorts in a
twist.

PSalerno, Contributor
USPSTF recommended gFOTB and FIT over Cologuard, but, on the positive side acknowledged that Cologuard is
more sensitive. 
The problem is that, being Cologuard a new test, obviously there are no enough data about the reduced mortality, so
the advantage is theoretical.  
Additionally Cologuard needs more colonscopies as follow up than FIT and gFOTB, so there is a problem of cost for
the insurers and the problem of more potential damages made by the colonscopies. In the future studies will show if
this increased number of colonscopies will led to a further reducttion in mortality rate. 
So Cologuard is not dead, it needs just more data and the number of the tests will keep growing, but in the near future
there is no hope to get the millions of tests the bulls were hoping for. I am bullish now on EXAS until the CMS will
cover and pay the test.

>>Additionally Cologuard needs more colonscopies as follow up than FIT and gFOTB, so there is a problem

That's only true for a Cologuard on a 1 year interval, which neither the company nor Medicare is even
considering. Given the slow growth of colon cancer you'd have to be foolish to recommend using a test with
92% sensitivity every year (colonoscopy only has a 94% sensitivity and its test interval is every 10 years). The
only reason FIT & FoBT are recommended annually is because their sensitivity is so poor that they need the
multiplicative effect of multiple tests to be effective.


Cologuard on a 3 year interval, as is recommended by Exact and was agreed to by Medicare, results in fewer
colonoscopies than any of the tests the USPSTF examined.

They considered Cologuard every 3 years, but said that, in order to have the same result, Cologuard needs more
colonscopies. Of course being less specific with more false positives, and also more sensitive with more true positives
the colonscopies will be more. Even if made every 3 years and not every year like FIT, they fear more colonscopies
are necessary. 
But I think the main point is the lack of data for the incidence on mortality. This is absolutely normal and they are not
negative on Cologuard, they just said that it was difficult to recommend it for everyone. That means the doctors are
free to make their valuation for every individual patient. I think that out of 8 million or so patient doing FIT , probably 4-
8% will shift to Cologuard.  
USPSTF was ore negative on PSA than on Cologuard and many doctors keep testing PSA. So it will take time but we
'll see a change in the market.

They didn't consider Cologuard every 3 years, they *only* considered a 1 year interval. Here are the Lifetime
Colonoscopy comparisons with 3 year Cologuard:


******* 
Lifetime Number of Colonoscopies, per 1000 Screened:


Colonscopy 10year interval: 4,049 
FIT 1 year interval: 1,757 
gFOBT 1 year interval: 2,253 
Cologuard 3 year interval: 1,714 
***********


13 Oct 2015, 05:53 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
They considered both: They said that "evidence on the optimal screening interval if any is lacking". In other words,
benefit from Cologuard at 3 years interval is not enough supported. 
They added that "CISNET modeling suggests that annual screening with Fit-DNA from age 50 to 75 could potentially
yeld approximately the same numbers of life years gained as the recommended strategies previously listed".
"However this requires a larger number of colonscopies...". 
In other words they said that if Cologuard is made every year the number of colonscopies is higher, if it is made every
3 years there is not enough evidence of the life years gained.

5/23/2018 Why Exact Sciences Is A Great Short At $10 - EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3555646-exact-sciences-great-short-10 24/39


Yes that's exactly what they said: More colonoscopies are needed if you use Cologuard annually (which no one has
ever suggested, so where did this come from?). And that they didn't have information about the 3 year interval. But
that's not what *you* said, you said this:


"They considered Cologuard every 3 years, but said that, in order to have the same result, Cologuard needs more
colonscopies."


... and that's wrong, they never claimed that Cologuard on a 3 year interval would result in more colonoscopies (and it
won't, it'll result in fewer lifetime colonoscopies than any of the other tests).


Their lifetime Colonoscopies number is not something they got from a study, they calculated it themselves for each of
the tests, based on CRC incidence, test sensitivity and test specificity. So they could easily have determined lifetime
colonoscopies for Cologuard on a three year interval (which would make a lot of sense since this is Exact's
recommendation and the Medicare reimbursement agreement), but didn't choose to.


14 Oct 2015, 04:44 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
I have simplified for brevity, but every 1year or every 3, the nut is that if you want to detect more CRC you have
necessarily to do more colonscopies with both more false and true positives. My take is that they could not
recommend generically Cologuard for economical reasons, private insurers cannot be forced to fully cover the test. 
Probably EXAS should make a deal with insurers accepting a partial coverage and making discount for low income
people. But I am bullish on EXAS now, because there are many situation where Cologuard is better than other stool
tests, not just for sensitivity, but probably even for specificity and doctors know what situations because most of them
have a brain, they are not like wall street analysts and investors. USPTSF had not the job to specify those situations,
but they said that doctors will decide when adopting Cologuard.

PSalerno, Contributor
I am hyper bullish on EXAS right now. I would give up and sell my position only if Medicare will not reimburse the test
anymore. I have doubled my position 4 times, even using options and now my average cost is well below 9. I can still
double 3 times making my position 8 times bigger without EXAS being my top 1 . Will double at 6.2, at 5.25 and at 4.
But the stock may already have bottomed at 6.79. 
The move below 10 was purely tecnhical because many funds rebalanced and sold EXAS just because it went down,
without any consideration for the fundamentals. They bought other risky stocks like DYAX and JUNO which are
loosing more money than EXAS. Hilarious.

16 Oct 2015, 02:57 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
To have a squeeze you need high volume and the volume is low today. The funds stop selling and the stock is going
up. 
Do you think EXAS will miss estimates ? They are quite low, EPS -0.44 and 12.6M revenue. I do not know about EPS
because the expenses are difficult to predict, but I think they will beat revenue forecast. So a move higher is also
possible after earnings.


16 Oct 2015, 03:08 PM


Skaterdude
As you know after reading many of the posts on EXAS articles, they won't be making a profit for about a year.
Pretty sure you'll see a similar growth in revenues to the recent past though. It's just a matter of scaling up
sales to reach the breakeven and then profits from the facility they've already built.


16 Oct 2015, 04:12 PM

As I stated before, If the company keeps bleeding cash, how long do you have to seek a sale? And, putting
investors at an unease situation. If you increase revenue, you'd probably have a 2/3 years of investors'
patience until the business start going south due to losses.(A good example of this is $ANGI).

I shorted ANGI around 25-30, and covered just below 10, but it is a different situation. In biotech I wrote
against AMRN which was also in a different situation. The market is acting like if EXAS had no hope to sell
their product. That is not the case. Cologuard is approved by FDA and reimbursed by CMS. Totally different
from AMRN. EXAS should show positive earnings in 3-4 quarters.

tradebr2010
 
I think $ANGI, although it's a tech co, was the same. The company went public, grew revenue but bled cash
for 10 years until Mr. market got tired,and put the stock in its place. From $30's to $5's, where it belonged on
valuation.


$EXAS has a product that will make the company grow but the company keeps bleeding cash. At a certain
point in the future, the company will be either sold or restructured to be profitable. The stock price will reflect
that. Different industries, same situation. 
I guess with my background I tend to oversimplify analysis. But, at the end of the day, all businesses goes to
phases where growth can be painful. And, if not well executed, will turn into a failure, or a sale whichever
comes first. The success will come from growth with losses and then growth with profits. However, high
growth is a must!


17 Oct 2015, 03:56 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Simplify analysis is good, and it works very well if you are able to focus on the most important points. I am not expert
in technology, but in the case of ANGI I tolked to some experts and they told me that their business model was unable
to make a profit, and they convinced me. I was also long YELP which was a competitor. 
In the case of EXAS, if Cologuard will keep growing as I think in 3-4 quarters the company will be profitable as the
expenses are mostly the same and some of them are una tantum. The sentiment had a dramatic change but nothing
has changed if not expectations. EXAS was trading at 23 before their product got a $500 reimbursement and without
having an "A" recommendation from USPTF. With the same sentiment now it should trade above 23, not below. This
is why I was bearish on EXAS before at 23 and above and bullish now at 10 and below.

PSalerno, Contributor
Yes, probably it will take a while. I saw your analysis about revenue and losses, but you have to consider that revenue
is growing at faster pace than losses, and this is what makes me oriented to the long side.


09 Nov 2015, 09:15 AM


tradebr2010
A few points I have on this:


1) Revenue growth is a reality - It had to be anyways for investors keep going supporting the company


2) One trick pony so far until other products emerge, and make significant impact on growth. If you have 3 or
4 products sharing revenue growth, that would be the ideal situation. 
In this case, the company with 1 product would be fair more suitable to be a division of a greater business,
not standalone at all.


3) I think we need to see SG&A stable and reduced with growth. That's why I'm so fixated on the $12M
revenue against $75M expenses. The company has a very high break even.


In summary, whichever price is fair for the stock long term(for me projected FCF per share, and discounted at
a decent return-12%), the company has long ways to achieve it.


09 Nov 2015, 09:31 AM


Skaterdude
I have to agree on the high break-even. It depends a lot on the assumptions you make as to how cost scales
with volume, but there aren't many ways it comes out well in the model I've tried out. Pricing will be very
important, as will sales commissions.


09 Nov 2015, 08:11 PM


tradebr2010
You have the other issue of the 1 trick pony too. R&D will increase if the company plans to develop other
products.  
In my experience, sales comissions should be fixed as a percentage of each unit sold. That's the easy way to
control it, and makes sense financially to the company. 
Now, the G&A component is the rough one to fix. Chopping expenses on a growing enterprise is extremely
challenging. It can be a moral downer if poorly executed. However, it will need to be done somehow once
$EXAS become more of a mature enterprise.


09 Nov 2015, 08:43 PM

I'm actually more concerned with the breakeven point for the existing facility. It is currently underused and the

PSalerno, Contributor
Companies with only one product are risky. Management should spend money carefully for the pipeline until
Cologuard will not achieve a net profit. I agree with the average analysts estimate loss of 1.75 EPS for next year
2016. Gross margin is 40%, so the revenue growth will have strong impact on earnings in 2017, reversing the loss
after breakeven. In the last 2 quarters alone, revenue sequentially grew from 8.1 to 12.6M, while loss was quite stable
growing from 39.3 to just 43.2 M. In the case of start up companies you have to look at margin because many
expenses are fixed.

Skaterdude
Well, that's a bit of a problem. Revenue grew by $4M and the loss grew by $4M? Doesn't seem like you can
infer a lot from that. Don't get me wrong, I'm long on this, but it's a very speculative situation without knowing
more about the cost structure so one can more accurately model potential outcomes.


09 Nov 2015, 08:13 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
In absolute terms loss grew 3.9M and revenue 4.5M, but on percentile the difference is a lot bigger as revenue is
growing 55% sequentially and it will be more clear in the next few quarters. At that time I will look at revenue growth
and gross margin.

Worth reading in its entirety; most especially the paragraphs about inadequacy of automated cleaning system of
previously-used endoscopes and the risk that introduces to disease transmission from one patient to the next.


Also the several paragraphs detailing a rather protracted multi-year history of the FDA's negotiations with this
equipment vendor.


We recall reading a sequence of stories in the mainstream press a year or so back about such instances of cross-
contamination among patients in which improperly-cleansed endoscopes were used at one medical facility, (located in
the upper Midwest as best we remember).


Doubtless this is hardly the kind of information the US Endoscopy establishment would like to see widely-
disseminated among a public many of whom already range on a continuum from unenthusiastic to fearful to outright
rejecting the prospect of having a routine colonoscopy for screening purposes.....


So obviously better news for alternative screening tests....


18 Nov 2015, 09:21 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
Yes, 2% of colonscopies end up with some problem, so Cologuard should gain a niche between FIT and colonscopy
as primary screening. It is possible that USPTF in his final decision will be more clear about the utility of Cologuard. It
should clarify that there are no data, but the DNA test with the better sensitivity compared to FIT should be an
improvement. Also USPTF was against PSA test but this test had a reduction of just 18% between 2010 and 2013, so
not everyone is listening and the debate is still open for PSA as well as for Cologuard.

No it was not, exactly as I said above , the USPSTF clarified that Cologuard has better sensitivity than other
fecal test and serology tests and put Cologuard in the same level as other tests including colonscopy, each of
them with advantages and disadvantages. It is responsibility of the doctors to choose the most appropriate
test case by case. 
Also the one year time frame price target posted by Tilson was never reached and the stock is now up more
than 4 times that level at 12.4 after hitting an high above 13. I am again on the green now having averaged
down and sold many 8-10 puts. My forecast for EXAS never changed, neither when the stock was at 30 with
the analysts predicting 10-14B revenue, neither when it was at 5, when people were thinking that Cologuards
has no future. It is possible that Cologuard could make 500M-1 B revenue in the future, even if it is growing
slower then expected and spending more than expected. This price makes sense again now, but it would be
risky to buy at this level above 12.

Whitney finally covered his short. He has to be one of the worst investors on Wall Street. He was given a gift from the

Where did you take the news Tilson covered just now ? I took profit too early around 15-20, but above 35 I am
short through puts. EXAS will not eradicate colon cancer, colonoscopy already had good result in reducing
mortality, but further progress will be more difficult. Cologuard will have a market, probably reaching 1 Million
tests per year, may be 2, that's all.


12 May 2017, 04:22 AM


morlockx15
All things figured in, EXAS is still losing money on every Cologuard test. A lot of money. On the CC, one
questioner asked the key question: How many people who completed the test three years ago are going back
for "seconds?" My guess is not many, but lets see the numbers. If EXAS is smart, they will make up an
excuse not to track that parameter. Compliance, BTW, is is only 2/3 and more likely to fall than to improve.


I have never recommended shorting EXAS due to their other DNA tests which probably explains its lofty
valuation and also is the only reason EXAS would be a takeover target.

EXAS had a pipeline even when it was trading at $5 and every biotech stock has a pipeline. I don't think it
could be a takeover target just because the pipeline, until they have not another promising product patented
and approved. Additionally they have a particular relation with the Mayo clinic and will resist to any hostile bid.
Anyway if they have another good product the stock can spike higher, so shorting with puts is the best
solution and without being too ambitious with the target.

12 May 2017, 01:38 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Also I agree with Morlokx about the reduction in compliance after 3 years, for a very simple reason: those
who had a false positive (12-13%) and had an useless unpleasant colonoscopy, hardly will take another test
after 3 years, but most probably will choose a different screening strategy among those supported by the
USPSTF.


12 May 2017, 02:11 PM


Kirk Spano, Marketplace Contributor
Compliance seems sticky around 70%, but we'll see as we enter 4th year in 2018. False positive rate has
been about half of your assertion in real world experience, see investor presentation. And seriously, when you
go for a colonoscopy after a positive Cologuard, if they tell you there's no cancer, will you really be mad?


12 May 2017, 02:16 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
False positive rate is more than I stated, as I considered all non advanced foundings and they are reported in
the USPSTF guideline with 87% specificity, but the specificity for colorectal cancer is only 84%.  
Sorry but I trust more the USPSTF. So, again those who had an unpleasant useless colonoscopy will not
probably take another cologuard after 3 years with the risk to make another useless colonoscopy after only 3
years. 
Then there is the problem of lower sensitivity. Cologuard misses 8 cancer out of 100 and 58 advanced
adenomas or flat polyps out of 100. Some of them will develop cancer so Cologuard will miss more than 8
cancers out of 100, probably 10.

far lower. Trust USPSTF??? Ha, that's laughable, they fired the guy you trust because he was a goof. New
USPSTF chair is very on board with Cologuard. Once, USPSTF corrected their ambiguity, EXAS is up 500%
in about a year from the falsehood induced bottom.


Also, did you know that 15,000 people DIE from colonoscopy each year? So, not only is Cologuard going to
crush FIT market like FIT did to FOBT (which was about a 4-5 year process), butt it's going to take a
significant share of colonscopy too. EXAS is easy going to the $60-100 range on Cologuard in the next few
years. The pipeline is free right now and it's a significant free call on some big tests, i.e. blood based long
cancer test (vs biopsy).

To be fair, if a false positive Cologuard test results in a colonoscopy that finds nothing, you do not have to be
screened again for 10 years, unless you have risk factors.

My info come from the scientific literature and you have no idea how the USPSTF works. It is not an
institution ruled by a dictator taking decisions alone. There is a panel of independent experts voting the
resolution. 
The risk of death from colonoscopy is very small, around 0.03%. Even considering all the side effects,
Colonoscopy every 10 years is the best screening capable to safe more lives. The studies quoted by
USPSTF show very clearly that colonoscopy on 1000 screened averts 24 cancer deaths versus only 20 with
Cologuard. In term of life years gained, colonoscopy gains 270 years versus only 220 with cologuard every 3
years. The death from colonoscopy for 1000 patients is 0.3, a lot less than 1. As showed in the study made by
Bronstein the risk of CRC after a negative colonoscopy is very low, so there is no need to make colonscopies
at shorter intervals.


12 May 2017, 04:50 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Yes, so all the false positives are lost for Cologuard and probably even after 10 years they will not take
COloguard anymore.


12 May 2017, 05:06 PM


morlockx15
What company would take out EXAS for the Cologuard test? If an asset loses money continuously, then it is
not an asset but a liability.

5/23/2018 Why Exact Sciences Is A Great Short At $10 - EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3555646-exact-sciences-great-short-10 34/39


PSalerno, Contributor
Cologuard will be profitable, as expenses are growing less than revenue and margins are improving with
volume.  
Anyway for the reason we discussed above the revenue will struggle to reach 1B. They need 2M tests every
year to have 1 B revenue and to make 2 M tests every year they need 6M patients. It will take years to do that
result and growth will be low in single digit at that point. Share count is increasing 10% every year, so they will
have 160M shares. 1B:160= 6.25 Sale per share. At 4 x sales stock price should be 25 in 2022. Assuming an
optimistic net profit margin of 25% they will make 250M, $1.56 EPS at 18PE the stock could trade at 28. with
20PE it will trade at 31. Those who buy now at 34-35 are philanthropists financing cancer research. This is
why my puts are doing well.

This is playing like some tech companies, revenue growth only matters.Who cares about profits! 
Congrats on the longs on this one!But, I still think the company business bleeds money galore. I got 1 Jul 21, 17 $29
PUT just for the heck of it!I'll add to it accordingly.

Nice to see EXAS trading once again along with my expectations. The Citron report is coming with good
timing, it is a better report than Tilson even if I do not agree 100% with Left, but his report is better and well
timed. Good for us.


15 May 2017, 12:29 PM


Special Ops
Your expectations???


Did you expect that the stock would trade OVER $50???


Of course not. 
You've been 100% Bearish on shares of EXAS in 2017.


That's a FACT.


25 Oct 2017, 03:37 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
Yes, my post is dated May 15th, I bought 35 strike May puts few days before when EXAS was trading above
$35 and the stock moved in line with my expectation as at that time was already lower below 32 and a few
days later, when I took profit, went even lower below 30 on May 18th. Great profit for me. I hope EXAS will go
at 60 to short again. EXAS is my favorite and most profitable short, but the best short trade is yet to come, the
big crash will happen in the next 1 or 2 years.

This is when the stock rallied from the low 13's to over 50.


You missed the entire move. 
That is a FACT.

Great short going forward. Got to hand it to Conroy- he knows what the Street wants to see and what to evade and
cover up. Not sure whether to short before earnings or afterward- I am sure EXAS with put out superficially "positive"
quarterly numbers.

At some point EXAS will be again a great short like in the past, but unfortunately this article was very
superficial and written when EXAS was a buy, even if it went even lower below 5 and took many months to
recover to 20.


27 Oct 2017, 09:14 AM

You said that at $20 and $30 and $40. 
lol


The stock is now over $51 and people aren't even expecting "great" numbers this quarter due to the
Hurricane impact on the quarter in FL and TX


27 Oct 2017, 12:28 PM

Aha! Has EXAS pre-warned on that? What people aren't expecting "great" numbers?


They need a clean trajectory on sales in order to maintain the stock's momentum. No one seems to care
about advertising and sales expenses.

I have often wondered why people that are anonymous posters on the internet actually think that they have
credibility when it comes to posting performance claims... many of which are "after-the-fact" and 99% of the
time are unaudited and undocumented claims.


Unlike most of the posters here, Kirk Spano is a registered investment advisor and his performance data has
been AUDITED.

from 13 to 58 is just a 346% gain in 1 year. ITUS had a 650% gain in 8 days and YOU totally MISSED.

Don't worry Salerno, timing is everything. I'm with you. As it goes higher on revenue growth, eventually holders will
notice the cash bleeding didn't stop together with more opex increase... Until then, let's praise the bulls on this one
trick pony!


06 Nov 2017, 10:14 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
They are increasing capacity from 1M tests to 2-2.5M and this comes at a cost. They are financing a
longitudinal study for Cologuard, asked by authorities because we still do not know the performance of
Cologuard on repeat customers after the first intake, and this will come at a cost too. They are not even
talking about future studies necessary to go ahead with the pipeline which is sleeping.


06 Nov 2017, 10:25 AM


tradebr2010
Whichever the case may be, bulls took over for a while. But, FCF bleeding and higher opex can only be
ignored for sometime, unless you're a tech company! 
Most of the people posting bull comments are drunk in short term profits, congrats on the great trade! But the
reality, long term, financials have a long way to improve, and growth in a 1 product company is very limited
and risky.
