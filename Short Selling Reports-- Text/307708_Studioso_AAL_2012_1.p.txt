AMR	Shareholders	Will	Get	Zero	In	Any	Takeover	Deal
Jan.	31,	2012	3:59	PM	ET22	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


Despite	delusions	to	the	contrary,	"investors"	are	playing	a	game	of	the	greater	fool	by
continuing	to	hold	shares	of	AMR	Corporation	(AAMRQ.PK).	Even	if	the	company
receives	a	takeover	offer	from	US	Airways	or	another	suitor,	shareholders	are	likely	to
receive	zero	once	the	company	is	restructured.


In	the	unlikely	situation	that	shareholders	receive	a	non-zero	amount	(either	as	takeover
consideration	or	as	part	of	a	company	restructure),	that	amount	is	likely	to	be	much	lower
than	the	30	January	closing	price	of	$0.71.


Background	and	NYSE	trading	history


On	29	November,	AMR	filed	for	Chapter	11	bankruptcy	protection.	On	that	date	the	stock
reached	an	intraday	low	of	$0.20,	giving	the	company	a	valuation	of	$67	million.	It	then
rose	sixfold	in	the	following	6	trading	days,	reaching	an	intraday	high	of	$1.20	on	7
December.	This	gave	the	bankrupt	company	at	$402	million.	Following	that,	the	stock	fell
as	low	as	$0.24	on	4	January,	which	was	the	last	day	it	was	listed	on	the	NYSE.


Pink	sheet	trading	history


On	5	January,	shares	of	AMR	started	trading	on	the	pink	sheets.	The	shares	rose
gradually	from	$0.24	on	5	January	to	0.44	on	19	January.	Since	then	the	stock	rose	as
high	as	$0.74	on	24	January.


The	Chapter	11	process	in	general


Chapter	11	bankruptcy	protection	allows	companies	to	restructure	their	debt	to	a	more
manageable	level,	so	they	can	continue	to	operate	as	viable	entities.	The	two	usual
outcomes	of	the	Chapter	11	process	are:


Creditors	of	the	company	receive	less	than	the	full	amount	they	are	owed.	They	may
receive	a	cash	payment	and/or	new	debt	to	replace	existing	debt.
The	shares	of	the	bankrupt	company	are	cancelled,	and	therefore	shareholders	(who
rank	junior	to	creditors)	receive	zero.

As	part	of	this	process,	creditors	are	sometimes	given	shares	in	the	company.	This
provides	partial	compensation	for	receiving	less	than	the	full	value	of	the	amounts	they	are
owed	by	the	bankrupt	company.	The	company	can	then	relist	their	new	shares,	as	a	viable
entity	with	a	lower	level	of	debt.


The	Chapter	11	process	for	AMR


In	AMR's	bankruptcy	filing	it	listed	assets	of	24.7	billion	and	liabilities	of	29.6	billion.	As
discussed	above,	the	usual	process	is	for	creditors	to	receive	an	amount	less	than	what
they	are	owed,	with	existing	shares	cancelled	as	part	of	the	bankruptcy	process.	Existing
shareholders	can	only	realistically	expect	to	receive	a	non-zero	amount	if	creditors	are
paid	in	full.	However,	given	that	AMR's	liabilities	are	$4.9	billion	more	than	its	assets,	it
should	be	clear	that	shareholders	are	excessively	optimistic	if	they	expect	to	receive
anything	in	a	balance	sheet	restructuring.


Takeover	possibility?


The	rise	in	AMR's	shares	since	5	January	can	largely	be	attributed	to	several	reports
discussing	potential	bids	for	the	company.	Media	reports	have	listed	Delta	Air	Lines
(NYSE:DAL),	US	Airways	(LCC)	and	TPG	Capital	as	interested	buyers.	More	recently	the
stock	rose	above	$0.70	in	the	days	following	another	report	discussing	a	potential	bid	by
US	Airways.


As	described	above,	in	Chapter	11	bankruptcy,	creditors	become	the	de	facto
shareholders	of	a	company.	Therefore	even	if	AMR	receives	and	accepts	a	takeover	offer,
this	offer	will	almost	certainly	be	made	to	its	creditors	only,	with	current	holders	of	AMR
stock	being	"offered"	nothing.	For	example,	if	Delta	or	US	Airways	make	a	bid	for	AMR,	a
takeover	bid	may	take	the	form	of	$0.40	cash	for	each	$1	of	debt	held.


AMR	bonds


Nearly	all	of	AMR's	bonds	trade	below	30	cents	in	the	dollar,	despite	recent	takeover
rumors.	The	trading	of	these	bonds	confirms	that	current	shareholders	will	probably
receive	nothing	when	AMR	is	reorganized.	If	AMR	stock	held	any	long-term	value,	the
company's	bonds	would	be	trading	much	closer	to	100	cents	in	the	dollar.	Furthermore,
these	bonds	are	the	only	AMR	security	that	hold	any	realistic	chance	of	gaining	in	value	in
the	days,	weeks	and	months	to	come.


AMR's	stock	is	trading	above	$0.70	on	the	"greater	fool"	theory	and	is	likely	to	be	worth
zero	when	the	company	is	reorganized,	even	if	the	reorganization	takes	the	form	of	a
takeover.

Trimming	the	fat	is	always	good.	But,	they	came	out	last	week	saying	that	the	trimming	was	going	to	start	at
the	executive	level.	This	is	a	great	sign.	There's	always	an	executive	VP	that	has	an	assistant	that	has	an
assistant	that	has	an	assistant.	Then	there's	the	Director	in	charge	of	towlet	bowl	washing,	who	has	an
assistant,	who	has	an	assistant...	etc.	It's	time	for	the	executive	VP	to	actually	do	his	job	for	once	and	skip	the
golf	course	this	year.	Or	he	can	be	outside	looking	in!
