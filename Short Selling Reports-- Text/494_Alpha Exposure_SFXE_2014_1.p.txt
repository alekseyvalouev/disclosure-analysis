SFX Entertainment: Playing House Music In A House Of Cards

Summary


CEO Robert Sillerman has so far reneged on his promise to purchase shares.


We examined why and found a company that's misrepresenting itself.


The company has an over-levered balance sheet and heavy cash burn, and we
believe the equity is worthless.


While SFX Entertainment (NASDAQ:SFXE) proclaims itself to be a leader in EDM and
house music festivals, we believe that SFXE is actually a house of cards headed towards
imminent collapse. Despite owning a portfolio of popular EDM concerts, SFXE is over-
levered, unprofitable, and burning through its cash reserves at an alarming rate. All an
investor needs to do is connect the dots, focusing on the CEO's actions, the recent debt
offering, and absence of 8-K exhibit filings. Investors do not want to be caught holding
SFXE shares when the bass drops.


What happened to Robert Sillerman's 10b5-1 plan?


On June 11, 2014, SFXE announced that Chairman and CEO Robert Sillerman had
instructed his advisors to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 stock purchase plan to purchase up to
2 million shares of SFXE. The release states, "Robert F.X. Sillerman, Chairman and CEO
of SFX Entertainment, Inc., today announced that he instructed his advisors to file a stock
purchase plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 promptly following the Company's release of its
second quarter financial results in August 2014. Mr. Sillerman's plan will have a term of
one year and provide for the purchase of a maximum of 2 million shares of SFX
Entertainment."


SFXE shares closed the day at $6.96.


On the August 14, 2014 second quarter 2014 earnings call, Robert Sillerman confirmed
the Rule 10b5-1 plan and stated that he thought SFXE shares provided compelling value.
In his opening remarks, he said, "I announced a 10b5 program, which will have a term of
one year, where I will acquire or seek to acquire up to 2 million additional shares. There's
no greater expression of my confidence in the platform, the people who are achieving this
and most importantly the loyalty and affection of our fans; they are here to stay."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548075-sfx-entertainment-playing-house-music-in-a-house-of-cards 2/21


Later in the Q&A section, he added, "I am very comfortable with the QMA position, and I'm
demonstrating that by a 10b5 that is put in place, and details of which will be forthcoming."


On the strength of Robert Sillerman's comments, shares of SFXE closed at $6.75, up 4%
on the day.


Despite two announcements of entering into a 10b5-1 trading plan, Robert Sillerman has
not purchased a single share of SFXE stock. Any share purchases by executives, even
those executed under a 10b5-1 plan, are required to be filed in a Form 4 within two
business days. These requirements are clearly outlined by the SEC in this document. As
seen here, purchases by executives under a Rule 10b5-1 plan are not exempt and must
be filed in a Form 4. SFXE has not filed a single Form 4 outlining any purchases of stock
by Robert Sillerman.


We do not know if the CEO has canceled the plan, but we do know that no insiders have
purchased a single share of SFXE in the open market. The share price has fallen by over
33% since the second quarter earnings announcement, which is when the 10b5-1 plan
was put in place. The CEO's 2 million shares would have cost him $13.5 million after the
second quarter conference call. They would now only cost him $9 million.


If SFXE shares were so compelling at $6.75, why hasn't Sillerman purchased any shares
as they've fallen to $4.49? The shares must look like a veritable bargain now. Assuming
Sillerman hasn't bought any shares, a good assumption given the obligation that he would
have to file a Form 4, he has saved himself at least $4.5 million. We believe Sillerman has
not purchased any shares because he doesn't want to throw his money away.


SFXE raised debt because it's burning so much cash


On September 24, 2014, SFXE raised $85 million of second lien senior secured notes due
in 2019. Total debt now stands at $305 million, all due in 2019.

On September 18, 2014, Moody's rated the notes Caa1. This rating is several notches
below investment grade, meaning that Moody's believes that the notes carry significant
default risk. Moody's defines corporate bonds rated Caa as "to be of poor standing and
are subject to very high credit risk," as seen here.


Historically from 1920 to 2007, corporate bonds rated in SFXE's range had a cumulative
default rate of 42.9% over a five-year period, as seen on page 24 of this Moody's report.
That means that approximately two in every five of these lowly rated companies default
during a similar five-year period as these bonds default. This compares to a 1.7%
cumulative default rate for Investment Grade bonds and 16.7% for Speculative Grade
bonds. Based solely on SFXE's rating, it's nearly a coin flip as to whether or not the
company defaults.


But the chances of default look much higher when SFXE's financials are analyzed. SFXE
burned through $48 million of cash in the second quarter alone, and finished with $59
million of cash and $162 million of net debt. This is significant financial deterioration from
the end of the first quarter 2014 when SFXE had $106 million of cash and $124 million of
net debt.


These EDM festivals, despite being popular, aren't nearly profitable enough to finance
SFXE's operations much less service its debt or fund its acquisition spree. In the first half
of 2014, SFXE reported an operating loss of $79 million and a net loss of $107 million.
EBITDA in 1H 2014 was negative $32 million, which is a loose proxy for cash flow. Even
on an adjusted EBITDA basis, which is the most favorable way for SFXE to report its
financials, it lost $22 million in the first half of 2014.

Without its recent capital raise, if SFXE had continued its current cash burn rate, it would
be out of cash by the end of the year. We believe this is why SFXE rushed to raise
additional debt despite having to increase the consent fee by 400% from $2.50 per $1,000
to $10.00 per $1,000 principal amount. It is also most likely why Robert Sillerman has
refused to purchase any SFXE shares.


While Sillerman has not purchased any stock, we do acknowledge that Robert Sillerman
did purchase $10.0 million of the 2019 notes in a private placement on September 18,
2014. Presented with the choice of equity or debt, Robert Sillerman chose to invest in the
debt of SFXE, which is structurally senior, rather than to purchase equity and align himself
with suffering shareholders. We believe this is a clear signal of his views regarding SFXE's
equity value…


Additional red flags and who is the CFO?


There are additional red flags that we have observed with SFXE. First, despite claiming
that SFXE has signed $50 million to $60 million in Qualified Marketing Agreements
(QMAs), SFXE has not filed any of these agreements as exhibits to its financial reports.
The SEC requires "material definitive agreements" to be filed as an 8-K and included as
an exhibit in the next registration statement (SEC Disclosure Requirements).


These QMAs are supposedly significant for SFXE and the company claims they will
contribute meaningfully to profits and cash flows. We question how material they actually
are when the company refuses to file these agreements as exhibits. Either the
agreements are material and the company violated securities laws or the agreements are
immaterial and the company misled investors. Frankly, both possibilities should trouble
investors.


Lastly, we ask, "Who is in charge of these loose financial controls?" We'll note that the
CFO Richard Rosenstein (bio here) doesn't have a CPA or CFA and has no prior training
as a CFO in any capacity, at either a private or public company. He does, however, have

experience as a stock analyst and previously worked at Keel Capital Management LLC, a
failed hedge fund that closed in 2007.


Conclusion: SFXE price target of $0


We believe that SFXE will go bankrupt and that the equity is worthless. We have set a
mid-term price target of $0. There is simply too much debt at the company. Cash burn is
high and net debt levels have been increasing. We believe the risk of default is high and
increasing by the day. In addition, we believe SFXE is trying to hide the truth from
investors. Despite touting the significance of its QMAs, SFXE has refused to file the QMAs
as financial exhibits, which means that they must not be material agreements. The SEC
has clear rules for materiality and required filings.


Lastly, Chairman and CEO Robert Sillerman has not purchased stock in SFXE despite
multiple statements regarding an 10b5-1 plan. We believe this is the clearest message
possible that even SFXE doesn't believe its equity is worth investing in.

I'm short since 7.12 and I agree with your assessment of the equity. I made my decision to go short because I have
insight in the nightclub/festival/ent... business and I did my research on Sillerman. A tiger doesn't change their stripes
so its important to note his past behavior. I will probably cover sub 3 because I feel as if he will try to take the
company private or sell to private equity when it makes sense. Research his history with 19 Entertainment, it mirrors
his business philosophy with SFXE.

Sell asap and walk away. This company does not have any long term prospects. Maybe if the hype machine
gets going you can squeeze another dollar out of it but if the sale doesn't go through this thing will eventually
go bankrupt.

"Sillerman’s $4.75 a share take private offer is non-binding and it stipulates that stockholders can remain
investors in SFX alongside him."


That means that you can STILL hold on to the stock and wait until the company starts to show a profit after
next summer's concerts.

Your assertions are too weak to support such a bold statement (SFXE being a house of cards). I agree that the lack of
any Sillerman purchases is troubling. However,


On Sillerman's alignment with shareholders: 
-You omit that a large part of his net worth is derived from SFXE, so if it fails he has a lot to lose. 
-He gets a $1 salary and did not sell any shares in the IPO. So again, is he spending the past 2-3 years of his time for
nothing? Does not make sense. 
-You also omit that he has personally garanteed the 2019 notes. Thus means that he has much more to lose if the
company goes bankrupt than his initial investment and his time.


On the debt: 
-It comes as no surprise that SFXE's debt has a low credit rating. Anyone familiar with the process knows that part of
the rating is the probability of the bankruptcy and part of it is the recovery rate. Look at SFXE's balance sheeet. All
intangibles. Recovery will be so low, the bonds of course should be considered junk.


On the cash burn: 
-You either do not know the company well, intentionally want to mislead readers or simply did a poor work. SFXE's
results are heavily skewed towards H. Even next year the company may have a minimal EBITDA in H1 (assuming
things go well), while the bulk of profits and cash flow is generated in H2. Focusing solely on H1 2014 is plain wrong. 
-You also fail to examine what are the the causes of cash burn. Firstly, in such companies (look at Live Nation, for
example), amortization expenses are high. Thus, operating income is skewed. Looking at the cash flow statement,
you will see that the oparting cash flow burn was only $9 million, a far cry from the data your reported. The main
cause of cash burn is capex for acquisitions. Were those to stop, the company would be on a much more solid ground
when it comes to liquidity and solvency.


But when you lost all credibility, was when I read about the CFO: 
What kind of accusation is that he has no CFA or CPA? That is plain ignorant. Also, he has never been CFO in the
past? Newsflash, all CFOs at least once became CFOs without prior experience.

Probability of default and LGD are different figures in credit methodologies. This is most clear in CDOs where
a senior tranche can be rated AA or even AAA but have an LGD of near 100% if it's a thin slice of the
portfolio's value.


09 Oct 2014, 02:29 PM


Stealth Eye
This is a grossly misleading assessment of value for SFXE or any company. In order to determine if a Company will
go bankrupt, you need to look at the future cash flows and performance. This is a roll up story and the Company is
spending massive amounts of capex NOW in order to generate cash flow in the FUTURE. Sure it is possible that
execution is horrible and that they have either spent too quickly or have lapsed operationally, which is a good reason
why the stock is down since IPO, but all you did was list net debt and cash numbers over the last two quarters, claim
the CEO is bailing because he hasn't bought 2mm shares (when he already owns 36mm) and state the CFO doesn't

I thought at first Salvatort was agreeing with your general assessment but needed to expand on it to validate it.
Reading further it seems he's trying to make a bull case. To understand SFXE you need to understand main street,
not wall street.


1. If operating cash flow burn is "only" 9 million but you need to take a loan of 75million to float the company then you
need to scale the 9 million to the specific business. Its a lot to SFXE.


2. The business of EDM is not a growth business, the SFX model is to acquire existing businesses with low margins
in hopes of slightly expanding top line and bottom line revenue. If a large shift occurs in culture, weather, sentiment on
recreational drugs then the business will take the brunt with lack of diversity. Who would buy a 5-6yr old nightclub and
expect it to as good as years 1-2?


3. Sillerman has a history of blowing shareholders money and screwing investors. He will most likely come out on top
by taking the company private or selling and taking advantage of beneficial terms for himself. He controls the entire
board.


4. People need to quit looking at SFXE as if its a tech or a biotech stock, there isn't a catalyst for massive growth. At
best its a slightly profitable company and at worst it doesn't exist.

this 8k argument is simply false and based on misrepresentation.


they DID file an 8k for mastercard. august 5th. pull it off edgar.


19th june viagogo. 8k.


i could go on.


they have done EXACTLY what you claim they have not.


they do not have to file the actual agreement.


just about NO ONE does that.


it would be dropping your pants to competitors, leave you wide open for other similar negotiations, and likely violate
confidentiality.


others have covered your lack of understanding on cash flow and on the plant/harvest cycle of a business like this, so
i'll leave that alone other than to say they are right and you are wrong.


this argument seems long on innuendo and misstatement and very short on truth and facts.

Author’s reply »  In your case, I would suggest abiding by Mark Twain's advice that "It's better to keep your
mouth shut and appear stupid than open it and remove all doubt."


What the company did was file its press releases as 8-Ks and not its contracts. SEC regulations require that
contracts be filed if they are material. Hence the contracts are either not material or the company violated
SEC regs. Choose one but both are bad news.


08 Oct 2014, 12:08 PM


The Reward Is More Cheese
Morganovich, while I do see 8-Ks for Mastercard and Viagogo, they are press releases with no financial
terms, not the agreements. The author sought the agreements themselves to be disclosed.


Material agreements with customers, master franchisers, etc. do require public disclosure. Confidentiality
clauses never override government disclosure requirements.


One has to assume SFXE's legal advisors did not believe these deals material enough to disclose, in other
words, they aren't expected to add much to revenue.

lol. weak ad hominem and grandstanding, the last refuge of those with no argument.


you should take your own advice.


very, very few companies release the full contracts. most, for the reasons i laid out above, do just as sfx did.
of the few that do release contracts, most redact the dollar values, royalty rates, etc anyhow.


the requirement is not at all what you are describing.

anac outlicences their lead drug to sandoz. it's as material as it gets.


http://bit.ly/1rXAER9


some terms, but no copy of the contract, just a link to the press release.


guys like oesx announced a deal ($6.2mm that is around 10% of revs and did not 8k it at all)


this is positively normal. it's VERY rare to disclose a full customer contract.


adherex was unable to announce extremely material drug trial results because their partner had the right to
release the data and wanted to wait for ACOG. the company had to bow to that.


either you have no idea how disclosure works, or you are just trying to be deliberately misleading.

neither makes you look credible.


but, by all means, keep making a fool of yourself.


but thanks for the buying op.


some reading for you:


"Because material contracts do not have to be filed as exhibits to the Form 8-K reporting the entry into the
agreements, there is time to prepare confidentiality requests before the due date for filing the agreement. If a
reporting company expects to file for confidential treatment, it must be careful not to undermine its request by
disclosure contained in the narrative description of the agreement contained in the Form 8-K. Rather, the
description itself could reference areas for which confidential treatment is being sought. Note that a
confidential treatment request should not be overbroad. The request must contain an analysis of why
confidential treatment is appropriate to prevent competitive harm to the company. It generally should not
encompass a matter that is subject to a specific SEC disclosure requirement, information that is material to
investors or information that already is publicly disclosed. See Division of Corporate Finance, Staff Legal
Bulletin No. 1 (with Addendum), February 28, 1997 (Addendum included: July 11, 2001). The request must be
filed by the date the next Form 10-Q or Form 10-K is filed (or the Form 8-K if the contract is being filed with
the Form 8-K). The portions of the contract for which confidential treatment is requested must be redacted in
the exhibit to the applicable report. If the confidentiality request is ultimately denied by the SEC, the
applicable agreement will need to be refiled as an exhibit, including the formerly redacted portions of the
agreement for which confidential treatment was not obtained. "


oops. there it is from the horse's mouth. you are dead wrong.


cheese-


disclosure? yes. disclosure of the full contract with terms and dollar amounts?


no.


that is actually very rare in an 8k. as laid out above in the guidelines, doing so actually prevents one from
making a (generally granted) confidentiality request.


your assumption about their legal advisers is simply incorrect.


the way sfx handled this is very common and you are trying to read something into it that is not there. if they
seek to honor confidentiality, they then HAVE to not include the material contract .


08 Oct 2014, 03:53 PM

Author’s reply »  Your quote is perfect. The company needs to file all material contracts and it can then redact
the confidential portions thereof.

your reading comprehension is letting you down.


they do NOT have to file the contracts. they have to file notice that they were entered into.


read the first sentence dimwit:


"material contracts do not have to be filed as exhibits to the Form 8-K reporting the entry into the agreements"


now read it again.


what does that say? contracts do not have to be filed with the 8k announcing them.


the company has until they file the next 10k to apply for confidentiality and either then include redacted
versions or even not include them at all depending on the discussions with the SEC.

Robert did put in 10 million of his own money recently to fund part of the $75 million second lien secured notes.


Robert F.X. Sillerman, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors, entered into a
purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Sillerman will purchase in a private placement
$10 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 9.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the
“Sillerman Notes”). The Sillerman Notes will constitute an additional issuance of and will be issued under the same
indenture as the Company’s existing 9.625% Second Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2019 issued on February 4,
2014 (the “Existing Notes”) and the Sillerman Notes will be part of the same series as the Existing Notes. Except as to
certain issuance-related matters, the Sillerman Notes will have identical terms to the Existing Notes.

You argue in your article that the company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Why would the CEO purchase debt
and possibly lose it all? I realize that the senior secured notes have been "guaranteed" by the company, its
subsidiaries, and U.S. Bank National Association. The risk of these types of notes are considerably less in the
event of bankruptcy. The yield 9.625% also seems high considering that these bonds are less risky than say
other forms of debt securities. However, if the company was in the kind of financial trouble that you describe
in your article, it would have been a fool's errand to put any amount of money at risk in the event of
bankruptcy.


Sillerman wants a return on his investment. He also knows the company needs additional cash. I still think it
is too early to determine whether or not this company will be successful or not. To me, if they can pull a profit
in the third quarter, this company has a future.

Caribe Capital, Contributor
oops.


look, he bought $2.5 million or so in stock today.


"Robert F.X. Sillerman, today completed the purchase of 575,000 shares of the Company's common stock in
two transactions that had been in negotiation prior to the publication of an online post today. Form 4s detailing
these transactions will be filed shortly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). In
addition, Mr. Sillerman has filed a stock purchase plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1 to purchase up to an
additional three million (3,000,000) shares of the Company's common stock following the release of its third
quarter operating results which will occur in mid-November. The Company will file a Form 8-K shortly
reviewing Mr. Sillerman's stock purchase plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1."

you can think whatever you want. but you're wrong. everything you "think" keeps being shown to be false.


ceo not putting money in/buying stock: wrong.


companies have to include a copy of the contract with a material 8k: wrong


you can annualize cash flow from a business that is highly seasonal: wrong


the big cash drain is from ops and not from acquisitions: wrong.


seriously, you have not been right about anything but the credit rating.

This whole argument is just so misinformed. If you want to make a case for why to be short something, do it
with numbers and future projections of cash burn. Analyze their assets, tell me why their concerts aren't going
to generate the cash they say they will. Explain why EDM is a fad and therefore SFXE's assets (EDM
concerts) are not worth what Sillerman thinks they are. To make a qualitative argument around the CEO not
yet buying shares WHEN HE ALREADY OWNS 32 MILLION OF THEM, showing they burned cash the last
two quarters because they were buying assets, showing off your knowledge of SEC rules (even though
morganovich showed how you were misinterpreting them), and then claiming a CFO is under qualified due to
a lack of CPA or CFA is the most ignorant short case I have ever seen. Thanks for letting me buy shares at
$3.75 yesterday, I should send you a commission. If this thing does indeed go bk, fine, but you will have been
lucky, not correct.

Tru Blu in your first post you state ... I have insight in the nightclub/festival/ent... business. In your second post you
state ..... At best its a slightly profitable company and at worst it doesn't exist.


With this insight you have, shouldn't you know if it exists or not? Have you attended or watched on the internet any of
the nonexistence festivals? Tell us more about the insight you have.


08 Oct 2014, 11:47 AM


Trublu
Hi Duckbert,


My insight into SFXE is that i'm up 50% from the last time we talked. Your rebuttal to my statement that at $7 SFXE is
a big short was posting their festival calendar. Hope you are doing well.


Festivals do exist its true, SFXE as a company won't exist if they continue on this path. Electric Zoo was closed due to
a couple deaths last year in NYC and this year it did not sell out. Two insurance claims in two years will effect their
margins greatly. Even if their other festivals sell out they only make a couple million each and interest payments on
300million in debts will swallow that whole.


SFXE purchased large portions of Opium Group, MMG (Liv Nightclub), Air Nightclub which are businesses that
decrease in revenue over time. Opium Group is down over 10% from last year and SFXE paid a premium to get a
majority piece of the group. Bad decisions overall, bad business, bad equity.


Do you need more proof than a 70% drop since IPO or do you need more insight?

Trublu, you didn't answer my question about your insight but instead gave evidence that the company does exist. You
single out a couple possible negative events but ignore positive ones such as Tomorrowland and TomorrowWorld etc
which are much bigger and more profitable events. Does your insight tell you how many deaths occurred during New
York Yankees games? You might be surprised. Congrats on your success so far on selling shares you don't own and
sold without the owner's permission. Before you question Sillermans's ethics perhaps you should look in the mirror.

The other thing that nobody is addressing is how SFXE expects to get the same amount of sponsorship revenue as
LiveNation, who has 60m attendees to their events and makes about $280m per year in sponsorship revenue, thats
about $4.6/attendee. SFXE just has 3m attendees to their events (attendance to LiveNation EDM events alone is
roughly that amount) and has guided to about $150m in sponsorship revenue, which is about $50/attendee.
Sponsorship $/attendee ratios like that are common place for sports leagues that are broadcast to billions of people
around the world, and where attendance isn't necessarily confined to attendees at the particular event. Will SFXE's
festivals be broadcast to billions of people around the world? I know some of the Tomorrowland videos online garner
100m views or so, but as Psy (Gangnam Style singer) will tell you, he only got $870k for 1 billion views on YouTube!

It's true that there are many red flags and very big question marks here, but no matter your views on the company
surely most everyone should be able to agree that this article is terrible.  
The case is basically "Cashflow isn't good enough and they need money. Why is Sillerman pumping money INTO the
company instead of spending it on the stock market?? Ah, because the debt is structurally senior and he knows
they're about to default." 
Again, there are issues and I'm not sure where all this will lead, but that is just about the stupidest thing a person has
ever come up with.


Add onto that the fact that it isn't even mentioned that most of the major events are during the second half of the year,
and this analysis becomes sketchier than even the company.


That goes for your assertions as well Trublu, EDM is indeed currently a massive growth business, although no doubt
it can't stay that way for very long. But right now massive new festivals are constantly appearing and SFX is
expanding its brands, adding days and weekends etc. It's shaky, but it's a growing market - that's the entire reason
that this company exists. 
And every single person who knows anything about electronic music would prefer controlling a 5-6yr old club venue to
one that's brand new, are you insane? Not that it's very relevant here.


(long may-june, short since then)  
mainly because of the massive short interest and downward pressure - it's something like 25%, but also since while I
very much believe in the business model I'm not at all confident that they can actually pull it off properly.

On Sillerman not buying shares: 
The main issue that can be argued for why he hasn't bought more shares is because of the material, non-public
information he has when deals are being done. Management usually cannot buy shares while a deal is being
negotiated because such deals can be considered material enough to affect the share price. SFXE bought Plus Talent
and Monumental Productions in September and I'm sure negotiations were going on for months prior to the
announcement.


On QMAs: 
Like someone commented above, SFXE has filed 8-ks for many of their marketing deals. They have not included
economics because that would destroy any negotiating power they have. Livenation also does not discuss economics
on their sponsorship deals.


On the cash burn: 
Salvatort hit it on the head- 3Q is their big cash quarter (at least for now) and they are in INVESTMENT MODE,
making a lot of acquisitions. If we still see cash burn in 2015 then I would be more worried.


On the debt: 
Yes, they are pretty heavily levered but assuming you believe the $60m EBITDA run-rate on sponsorship deals going
forward, they have decent coverage of 2x-3x of interest expenses.


Catalysts going forward: 
1. Obviously more sponsorship announcements would be great 
2. Sillerman buying more shares now that the deals have been announced. 
3. 3Q earnings: 3Q is their biggest quarter and positive signs on revenues and cash flows would be very encouraging.
Also more clarity on the call regarding any operating leverage in the events segments (as promised), and more clarity
on the sponsorship pipeline would be great.


08 Oct 2014, 12:44 PM


Deep Insight, Contributor
In your own article, you have noted that the plan has a one-year termination date. It seems premature to hang the
main argument of your article on the idea that Sillerman has avoided purchasing SFXE shares. It was only mid-June
when the announcement was initially made giving him plenty of time to complete his promise. Additionally, it seems
you have misstated the dates in your first two quotes as they both read: August 14, 2015.

As long as the few analysts covering the stock don't reverse their Buy or Strong Buy ratings, the stock will recover.
Although everyone on seeking alpha is open to their opinion (foolish or not) I feel somewhat more safe taking advice
from professionals who actually have a budget to conduct research to support their thesis, even though this is not
always effective. There are many ways to grow a business.  
Either you just hope the product you have slowly becomes mainstream or you can expand via acquisition, which will
lead to debt. The issue is how much leverage? C-rated debt isn't the best to take out anymore loans so they should
really stop or risk paying high interest in the future. Hopefully the acquisition period is over for SFXE and they will
concentrate the next few quarters on:  
Increasing attendance at high margin festivals (over 10k people) 
Either merging the smaller ones together or getting rid of them by spin-off or carve out 
Getting new marketing deals


All to pay of debt and start making profit a few quarters in the future.  
Whoever bought shares up until yesterday is essentially in the red, but the next few quarters will shed light on the
companies prospect.  
It is simply to early to determine whether or not the company will default and using metrics such as the z-score are
useless due to negative numbers the company has at the moment (because of its acquisition spree)


08 Oct 2014, 01:54 PM


The Reward Is More Cheese
Other than the CFO comment, I think the author nailed it.


The business model is dubious, cash is burning with no end in sight, the company is overlevered (2nd lien?
seriously?), and Sillerman has a long history of deviousness.


Regret not shorting when there was still borrow.

Alpha Exposure you are writing an article for your own purposes. Your analysis of cash flow is not correct.
The negative cash flow from operations was $9 million for the quarter. That is $3 million per month. The
remaining outflow of cash was mainly for acquisitions. Cashflow from operations will be positive this quarter.
Your distortions were made for your own benefit to drive the stock price down. What is your basis for claiming
that EDM is dying or any other wild claims you make? You are a short with an agenda and did not disclose
that in your story. You got the knee jerk reaction that you hoped for. Maybe you don't realize but that tactic is

Any investor who plans on purchasing shares would initiate a position when he thinks it's at its lowest. Sure
even if he doesn't buy at $5 but he does at $4, he is buying shares nonetheless. It is completely logical to wait
it out for a little bit and go long when you think the stock price has bottomed. And being CEO, he probably is a
lucky one to have the information to easily determine a bottom.  
Buying at 4,5 or 6 would have been better for investors but you need to look at it through the CEOs eyes as
well. They don't just dumb money out because they feel like it. A buy is a buy

The disclosure shows that a portion of the purchase was made yesterday. And if the CEO made a purchase in
reaction to your article, you don't need to get defensive about it. You should be honored that somebody would
put up nearly $3 million to prove you wrong. But it ultimately demonstrates confidence in the value of equity.


And for the record, Sillerman stated that share buyback plan was to occur after Q3 results.


Q3 the company will have produced a total of 26 festivals, that includes TomorrowWorld and Electric Zoo. I
believe the Q3 results are crucial for the company. If it can't make it during festival season, I don't see how it
has any chance at all. That the CEO wants to execute the 10b5-1 plan AFTER Q3 results demonstrates
confidence.

that the October 8 purchase was made at $5 per share, way above yesterday's market price, verifies the

The company is based on rolling up more companies at a lower EBITDA then the stock is commanding and that the
sellers accept part payment in stock. Therefore the stock needs to be liquid. Sillerman had to purchase the 575,000
shares from inside sellers that were anxious to get out and if they sold in the market the stock would collapse and the
company would not have stock at a good price for other acquisitions. There are probably many other insiders either
subject to a lock up agreement or looking for ways to sell before its too late. In addition, I read his purchase of the $10
million in debt as something he needed to do to convince other lenders to invest in the debt and amend the old debt.
If the debt holders did not amend the debt and the company could not sell new debt the game would be over. I also
believe that if you look at comparitive earnings of many of the recent events they might be losing money or not as
profitable under SFXE ownership. I think this company will continue to disappoint and eventually be owned by the
debt holders who have security on the assets. Currently it has a enterprise value of approximately $700 million which I
believe is way too high. For disclosure purposes I am short the stock. Lastly go to link below that says it all.

Seven months on since this article was written, it seems to me that Alpha Exposure’s prediction of SFXE’s "imminent
collapse" was wrong. However, SFXE is a house of cards with too much leverage so, absent a material equity
investment, a collapse appears likely to me….whether SFXE has publicly traded shares or not.


This company should never have gone public in October 2013. Shame on the underwriters and investors who bought
into Sillerman’s dream (scam?). Financial performance has been atrocious when compared to expectations set by
management since the IPO. Considering how negative operating cash flow has been *every single quarter* (yes,
even during the acquisition spree), combined with management's history of failure to meet its own projections, who
truly believes SFXE will generate positive cash flow in 2015? The latest disappointment: Rock N Rio.


This underperformance wouldn’t matter so much if SFXE weren’t so highly leveraged. As of 5/8/15, SFXE’s total debt
was $320M, and it’s only going higher from there with potentially $25M of earn-out payments due by 9/30/15. With
that level of debt, ongoing negative cash flow, minimal organic revenue growth, and bloated SG&A (even excluding
non-cash compensation), SFXE is no longer financeable on its own. Thus, on 3/16/15, Sillerman committed to cash
collateralize up to $31M in new loans under SFXE’s credit facility.

If Sillerman is unable to complete a buy-out and no bona fide offer for the company by a third party materializes, then
I believe that SFXE’s stock will — and should — drop precipitously. Based on fundamental value analysis, SFXE’s
equity is highly overvalued by the market now. There ought to be a correction. However, there are more than 10M
shares short at the moment and many sellers will cover their positions after/during a plunge so it’s hard to predict how
low the stock price will drop and for how long. In a scenario where the stock price drops to $1-$2/share and the
company edges closer to bankruptcy, perspectives will change for most participants with influence (Sillerman,
lenders/advisers like Jefferies and UBS, public equity investors, strategic buyers, private equity sponsors, etc).


Many say the writing is on the wall; I’m not sure the story is over yet. I would appreciate insights and predictions from
well informed, intelligent parties.
