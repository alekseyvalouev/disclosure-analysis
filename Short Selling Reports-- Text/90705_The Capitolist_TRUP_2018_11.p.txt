TRUP


After noticing that several veterinarian clinics used the same or similar language in
marketing Trupanion I looked at the "neutral" review site petinsurancereview.com
that is cited in the marketing materials.


My concern was that petinsurancereview.com was part of the marketing effort not
an actually "neutral" review site for consumers.


Petinsurancereview.com does not seem to be a fully independent as it is owned by
a UK based "digital marketing agency" named Equimedia.


What Equimedia does for its clients with this review site is unclear.

Follow Me Down The Rabbit Hole


If you have not been following the $TRUP story with me you should know the ground
rules. In August I published the core thesis around the valuation of NASDAQ:TRUP
being between $20/share and $10/share depending on their growth rate and the amount
of regulatory overhang the company would experience over the coming years (LINK).
The core thesis is that companies in hypergrowth mode garner massive valuation and
then - in the process of fighting to maintain those valuations - cut corners on
compliance. I still believe that TRUP is fundamentally overvalued and target the lower
end of my range for a variety of reasons.


A few days ago I published, "Trupanion: NAIC To Address Pet Insurance This Weekend"
the intention was to better explain (via a few examples) why the state insurance
commissioners would spend an entire year on a white paper. My theory was that they
found the same odd examples of inappropriate marketing that I found using google.


In the process of researching that article I found several websites with similar language
regarding a "neutral review site" petinsurancereview.com.


The specific language verbatim: "For those of you who enjoy digging deeper and
doing some of the research yourself, there’s a great website we recommend you
consider: http://www.petinsurancereview.com . This site is neutral and does a good job
of presenting the facts about pet insurance and helpful ways to make informed
comparisons between different pet insurance companies."


I found this language in Beverton, OR (here) and in St. Augistine, FL (here) and in
Dracut, MA (here). So I thought, "lets look at petinsurancereivew.com and determine if
it's really neutral and free of conflicts"


I'm going to run through the evidence I have gathered quickly here and we can regroup
on the backside.


Petinsurancereview.com was bought by "By You LLC" a subsidiary of Equimedia in 2018
- article here. In the article it state clearly that:


"Independent UK digital media agency, equimedia, has announced its entry into the lead
generation space with its acquisition of the US–based Pet Insurance Review, for an
undisclosed sum."

"By You LLC"


The ONLY comment that is placed at the bottom of the article is by "Dan Levitan"


Equimedia acquires US-based Pet Insurance Review


Is this the same Dan Levitan is on the BOD of TRUP?


The truth is I don't know, this could be a member of the BOD making a strange comment
about Trupanion in a deal that seemingly has nothing to do with them... or it could be an
imposter. Either way it got me looking for ties between Equimedia and Trupanion
because it looks really odd.


A search for "agents" of "By You LLC" yields the following result in Utah.

But How is this connected to TRUP?


Source: Utah Agent Search


So I have linked "By You LLC" to Petinsurancereview.com to Equimedia in one
screenshot. I feel like this is progress.


If you scroll down the page you can see that TRUP's insurance arm (American Pet
Insurance Company) is listed at an affiliation (alongside Nationwide)

Conclusion


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the


I can understand the urge to say "so what?" - I have not been able to prove
malfeasance - in fact I have not accused anyone of it. However, a few things should be
noted as fact:


petinsurancereview.com calls itself a neutral and independent site, but it is owned by
a corporation that provides digital marketing solutions and according to linked in has
at least some relationship with TRUP (given the linked in profile above).


1.


All of these relationships remain undisclosed in the TRUP SEC filings (or at least in
the review that I performed).


2.


None of these relationships are disclosed to the consumer who is using
petinsurancereview.com to make decisions.


3.


Equimedia views petinsurancereview.com as a "Lead Generation" site.4.


In my mind this is simply one more example of the consumer being denied the full
information they need to make a proper decision when purchasing pet insurance.
Whether it is the Veterinarian channel - or petinsurancereview.com - the multiple
potential conflicts should be (and potentially are) causing indigestion for the state
regulators. I don't see the state regulatory situation abating in the near term, to me this
looks like a multiyear process whereby all the companies in the space will receive
examinations of greater frequency and detail.


I remain concerned as to exactly how this language (specifically suggesting a lead
generation site, owned by a digital marketing firm, posing as an independent review site)
found its way onto the web sites of three different veterinarian clinics in three different
states. I am continuing to work that issue.

In the end - we are still talking about an insurance company trading at a massively
