Sungy Mobile Q2 '14 Earnings Preview: GOMO A No-Go
Aug. 25, 2014 2:41 PM ET19 comments
by: TrinityResearch


Summary


We believe GOMO has substantially overstated operating metrics and financials in
the past, particularly for their launcher and literature products, the two largest
contributors to revenue.


In spite of these overstated numbers, GOMO should turn in their worst quarter ever
on 8/27, whiffing on every metric: revenue, EPS and Q3 guidance.


The most damning negative will be severe degradation of its flagship product, Go
Launcher, which is the main reason QIHU invested but has now lost strategic
interest.


The Getjar acquisition that promised entry into the mobile platform market has
turned into a full-blown disaster that has key employees leaving in droves.


We expect the recent resignations of several key executives to continue with the
resignation of the CFO, which will put into question GOMO's overstated metrics and
financials.


A quick glance at Sungy Mobile's (NASDAQ:GOMO) chart since the 11/21/13 IPO tells the
story of a company that has corrected substantially from its IPO euphoria. The bottom
appears to be in, with the stock trading sideways at about $10.50 since mid-July.

However, we believe there is still substantial downside because the extent to which
GOMO has begun a full-blown collapse will become apparent when they report Q2
earnings on 8/27.


There is simply no other way to interpret the following recent evidence:


Sharp decline in usage metrics for all of the major mobile apps that comprise their
"Go" line of products: Go Launcher, Go Locker, Go SMS Pro and Go Weather (and
other smaller, inconsequential apps that never took off as these others once did)
Sharp increase in usage metrics for all of Go's major competitors
China Mobile's recent ban of a substantial amount of GOMO's literature product (which
contributed about one third of FY 2013 revenue) due to excessive pornographic/adult
content
Ongoing free fall of 3G.cn, GOMO's mobile portal that has become so irrelevant it does
not even show up on any of the major third-party mobile portal ranking tables in China
anymore
A recent and still ongoing exodus of key execs, with internal talk of more resignations
to come shortly


Entire Line of "Go" Apps Well Past Their Short-Lived Peak


We have been highly skeptical of GOMO's reported numbers since the IPO because the
download and usage metrics as well as interest indicators do not bear out the purported
scale of GOMO's user base and the type of growth the management team has been
guiding to.

At the highest level, a simple trend analysis on Google for GOMO's three flagship Go
products and their next generation launcher (Next Launcher) tells the story of a company
that has to be in substantial decline from a usage and therefore revenue perspective.


Google Search Trends from 2011-August 2014 (100 represents all-time peak)


While search data is not perfectly correlated to download or monetization data, the
correlation is significant, since the amount of Internet chatter a mobile app generates is a
decent proxy for the amount of usage it gets. For example, WhatsApp, which has been
around for at least as long as the core Go apps, has a very different search trend chart:


Google Search Trends for WhatsApp from 2011-August 2014 (Aug score is 100, all-time
peak)


The same trend analysis for other popular apps such as Snapchat, Tinder, Viber, 360
Launcher, Clean Master, Battery Doctor, etc. produce similar results.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2449365-sungy-mobile-q2-14-earnings-preview-gomo-a-no-go 4/20


What makes GOMO such an analyzable company is that most of its revenue (over 70%,
according to their IPO prospectus and road show presentation) comes from outside of
China. Mobile metrics for Chinese companies are notoriously hard to track because the
app distribution and app platform ecosystem is much more fragmented than in the rest of
the world, where two or three huge players (of which Google and Apple are usually the top
two) tend to dominate. But outside of China and a few select much smaller emerging
markets, the rest of the mobile world is well-documented by third parties such as App
Annie.


Below are some charts from App Annie of GOMO's supposedly wildly popular products in
various parts of the world ex-China. We selected USA, Japan and Korea in particular
because those are the largest and most developed mobile app markets outside of China
and are therefore a good benchmark for global companies with the type of scale GOMO
claims. But similar charts can be generated for most countries that App Annie tracks.

Many of the claims GOMO made during various meetings and interviews we were part of
throughout the past couple of quarters were unverifiable and often, we found them to be
untrue. For example, the company told us that they are the largest launcher developer in

the Korean market, but our research suggests that nobody is close to Kakao, the company
that makes the most popular messaging platform in the country. Also, they claimed that a
lot of the new growth was coming out of Southeast Asia, where they were seeing
explosive growth. Meanwhile, our checks with some of the largest carriers and
smartphone distributors in the region bore out a reality that we had suspected from prior
work in the region. While the numbers may indeed be stronger on a relative basis, there is
no chance those regions can make up for the fall in the key app markets because
monetization in Southeast Asia pales, by at least two orders of magnitude, in comparison
to that of the developed regions.


Can GOMO's Numbers Be Real?


Given all that as context, GOMO's numbers make zero sense.


Below is a chart of the key metrics from their past earnings calls.


How can GOMO's declining interest and usage worldwide (Google's data is global) deliver
these types of numbers? How can GOMO's reported numbers be doing anything but going
down?


There are only three possibilities behind this massive discrepancy between third-party
data and GOMO's reported data:


1. Possibility 1: GOMO's new products are absolutely crushing it and making up the
shortfall in their core products



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/8/24/29409765-14089331188657134-TrinityResearch_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2449365-sungy-mobile-q2-14-earnings-preview-gomo-a-no-go 10/20


2. Possibility 2: GOMO finally cracked the China market, which was less than 30% of its
revenues in the past, and that mega-market is what's more than offsetting the obvious
decline everywhere else


3. Possibility 3: GOMO, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is not reporting accurate
numbers


New Products Not Crushing It Either


The only two new products in their portfolio that have anywhere near the kind of scale to
be able to fit possibility number 1 are the Next Launcher and the recently acquired GetJar.


App Annie's results were a little more favorable for Next Launcher than Google's (see first
chart), but there was no third party source we found that showed any growth in Next.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2449365-sungy-mobile-q2-14-earnings-preview-gomo-a-no-go 12/20


On 2/12/14, GOMO announced the acquisition of GetJar, a mobile ad network based in
California. Given that their office is a few miles from Google's, one would think that
Google's trend analysis might have some merit:


Google Search Trends for GetJar from 2011-August 2014


What's more, we spoke to a former employee who had recently left GetJar and learned
that there has been an exodus of talent from the company, with key engineers and product
people having left or preparing to do so. Apparently, the acquisition and integration is not
going well, and we have to believe the numbers can't be doing too well either.


GOMO a Nobody in China


Admittedly, the Chinese market is much harder to analyze and quite fragmented, but if any
company was showing the kind of growth in China necessary to offset the broader decline
in GOMO's metrics, at least Baidu, the Google of China, would show some signs of
prominence.


A recent search on Baidu's version of Google Trends showed such little volume related to
any of GOMO's products that they didn't even register on a chart. We had to scroll down to
the rankings to verify that GOMO is well behind all the usual suspects who lead the app
market in China.


Baidu Shows 30% YoY and 5% MoM Decline for Go Launcher

Baidu Shows Go Launcher Hopelessly Behind Competition


Baidu Shows Go Launcher Hopelessly Behind Competition


If those charts do not suffice, then perhaps the outcome of a recent conversation we had
with QIHU's corporate development team will. QIHU was the largest strategic to invest in
the IPO because they were interested in the launcher product. However, now that the
launcher has not only stopped growing but actually reversed and started a decline, all
strategic interest is apparently gone.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2449365-sungy-mobile-q2-14-earnings-preview-gomo-a-no-go 14/20


So back to our three possibilities… if it's not Possibility 1 and it's not Possibility 2 and
there are only three possibilities, then….


Key Executives Bailing


Maybe a hint that Possibility 3 might have some merit is the fact that GOMO's own
executives are running for the hills.


Here is a list (probably incomplete) of all the executives who have left GOMO that we
have tracked:


Chief Marketing Officer Zhang Minhui inexplicably left the company two months before
the IPO
Former CFO Yang Shuqin also left the company two months before the IPO after a
total tenure of a whopping four months
Audit Committee Chair and director of GOMO's board Jonathan Zhang left the
company six months after the IPO
VP of Sales Cao Ming left the company in June. Cao was not just a VP of Sales. He
was one of the founders and set up the sales team at GOMO from scratch
VP of Product and head of the launcher division Xin Li also bailed a few weeks ago


And we have already discussed the exodus in play at GetJar a few short months after the
acquisition.


It is one thing to lose executives when a company is in trouble or under investigation or
very obviously cratering financially. But why are all these key people bailing if the
company is growing as nicely as is shown by the previous chart we put together of
GOMO's quarterly metrics??


Who could be next?


Given the pattern above and the puzzling disconnect between third-party data and
GOMO's numbers, we suspect current CFO Winston Li will bail next, followed by the audit
chair. That would make two resignations for each of the key finance positions at GOMO in
about a year, which should create a total loss of confidence in the company's numbers
thereafter.


Could one or both of these executives have left or announced their intent to leave
already?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2449365-sungy-mobile-q2-14-earnings-preview-gomo-a-no-go 15/20


Aside from the obvious degradation in the metrics we have shown, there are two clues
that bad news, and probably of the very bad variety, are imminent.


First, the company suspiciously announced a $20 million buyback right before their
blackout period before earnings. Typically, this type of news, which is generally perceived
as a positive, is announced during the earnings call and not immediately before. So why
before? To us, it is an obvious move to do damage control after the earnings event. What
makes this move even more suspicious is the fact that the co-founder, Chairman and CEO
Deng Yuqiang recently elected not to exercise his stock options expiring in April, which
resulted in a decrease of his personal stake in GOMO from 22.1% of fully diluted shares
(per the 2013 20-F filing) to 19.4%.


So the CEO was not willing to put his own money behind his business, but when it comes
to shareholder money, why not? If that is not shady, we don't know what is.


Caught with Their Pants Down


As if there was not enough drama at GOMO, there is one last issue that has caught our
undivided attention.


The numbers we are most interested in learning about this quarter have nothing to do with
the Go line of products or the new and improved Next launcher or even GetJar. We are
fascinated by how the reading/literature app is doing.


Although the management team does not appear particularly fond of this business,
preferring to talk about launchers instead, mobile reading is about a third of GOMO's total
revenue and therefore a very important cash cow for GOMO.


Mobile reading publishes both original and third-party content (on a revenue-sharing basis
with content providers) largely through third-party distribution channels. By far the most
important distribution channels are China's three state-owned carriers China Mobile (the
largest), China Unicom and China Telecom. GOMO's own distribution channels, a barely-
downloaded app called GG Book and the portal 3G.cn that is many years into a steep
decline, are a small percentage of total distribution.


Recently, the Chinese carriers led a major coordinated crackdown on content providers
and were understandably quite tough on porn. This was part of a central government effort
to purge the Chinese Web of porn, as reported here. Even some of China's largest
companies, like Sina.com (NASDAQ:SINA), were subjected to full scrutiny. Some
businesses were completely shut down, like Kuaibo, the top competitor of listed online
video sharing company Xunlei (NASDAQ:XNET).

Comments (19)


We learned recently that China Mobile, the largest mobile carrier and a huge channel for
GOMO's reading product, banned GOMO during this porn crackdown because the vast
majority of their paid users were paying for porn.


What numbers GOMO reports for reading/literature will tell us lot about how the company
has been managing its financials this quarter, and whether we are right to strongly suspect
that Possibility 3 will result in a very bad outcome for GOMO shareholders even at this
seemingly depressed $10-11 level. As with its Go line of products, we expect the company
will somehow find a way to report flat to slightly down quarterly sequential numbers for
reading/literature despite taking a big hit from China Mobile and possibly other carriers as
well.


One way to look at the GOMO stock price chart at the beginning of this article is to say
that the shares are off 70% from their 52-week high and so GOMO is due for a bounce.
The more accurate way to look at that chart is to recognize that GOMO is only down 20%
from its IPO day close but is much worse off than it has ever been, having lost half a
dozen senior execs and a substantial portion of the acquired GetJar team, having lost all
the momentum in its products which are now in decline, having lost a huge chunk of its
reading/literature cash cow unexpectedly and about to lose more senior executives and
possibly their new CFO.


We attempted to contact the company but were told that they are in a blackout period due
to the upcoming earnings call this week and to expect an update on their key operating
metrics then. We look forward to that update. This week's will be an interesting earnings
call indeed. We believe it will provide the negative catalyst for GOMO to drop another leg.

Author’s reply »  Because those are cumulative numbers. What you should care about is the trend, month
over month, quarter over quarter, year over year. The company has obviously had past success of some sort
with their launchers, which is why it has almost $400 million of market cap for a company that does not have
much beyond its launchers. That said, that market cap will erode quickly if the trend is downward, as we
suggested it is.


We only have to wait a few days to find out whether the trend is up or down. And more importantly, we will
find out whether the numbers make sense given the trends....

Author’s reply »  When the CFO does not return your calls, answer emails, or show up to meetings, guess
what, it is not hard to call his bailing. Especially when he was so present during the IPO and when the stock
was ripping.


The AC chair did not resign as the old one did already... YET... We think that is probably imminent too. They
have gone through 2 CFOs and 1 audit chair/director in less than two years.


This ship is sinking fellas.

I actually liked there products/etc. and made a small speculative bet based on the financial data/etc. awhile
back at average prices around $12. I sold today and will move on. I almost sold prior after reading this but
thought it was 50/50 that they would somehow eek out one more win.


I hope you made a large bet and a good profit. This is a great example of proper due diligence and going
deep on a small-cap (where it's even more valuable - as there is much less scrutiny on their statements).


I'm again reminded that I'm bad at placing speculative bets ;)

Nice work Trinity.


I will say there is plenty of issues with GOMO. Active users shrunk (albeit only slightly). However, I will say Sungy is
still a top company as far as downloads as of July. 
This is iOS and Google combined. GOMO has no iOS products as far as I'm aware so showing up on this list gives
them some credibility still. Valuations may make this a bit more interesting if they can grow the user base again.

Again GOMO has problems, but they are still the 4th largest by download and 2nd highest revenue
generating app company in the world on GooglePlay. They could be smoke an mirrors with the numbers, but
AppAnnie independently validates that they are generating a very significant amount of money from these
apps.

Most people who jumped on GOMO long in the past were hypergrowth investors/traders. I believe that GOMO at
$6.30-$6.40 today currently makes a great value play and a likely M&A target.


GOMO's growth has decelerated, however; even if we discount growth, their apps, most notably their launcher app,
has been downloaded over 200 million times and all of its apps have been downloaded 436 million times. Let that
number sink in. That's a lot of worldwide eyeballs for which the likes of Google or Facebook or any Chinese
equivalent, wouldn't mind owning. I think GOMO looks incredibly cheap due to its strong cash position and no debt
and positive income each quarter.


GOMO sits on $3.40 per share cash.


They've been reorganizing since August....$20M buyback, new compliance officer, rearranging folks to keep in line for
Nasdaq requirements, cutting 100 people or 12% of their workforce. I just see a lot of value sitting here for someone
to want.


And just a reminder:

I just wanted to add, GOMO hit a low of $5.90 on Sept 25 and a month late its high since then of $8.64 on October 24.


The things that have happened between those dates have been corporate restructuring announcements and the
acquisition of MobileWoo.


I assumed the market liked the corporate restructuring due to the rise in stock price in the end of October.


I fortunately just happened to come across this company/stock over the weekend which gave me a chance to do
some research, and I noticed a volume surge on Friday with downward pressure on its price. I decided to take a
chance today that the value of GOMO in the $6's would be strong due to underlying value and could catapult back
into the $8's if anything of significance was announced. We shall see as I believe 400 million eyeballs, strong cash,
earnings positive, presents a great value at this level. Good Luck!
