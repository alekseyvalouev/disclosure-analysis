Gray	Fox	Petroleum:	A	Promoted	Stock	At	Risk	For	A	Trading	Halt
Mar.	4,	2014	10:06	AM	ET25	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


(Editor's	Note:	This	article	covers	a	stock	trading	at	less	than	$1	per	share	and/or	with	less
than	a	$100	million	market	cap.	Please	be	aware	of	the	risks	associated	with	these
stocks.)


The	Fraud	Research	Institute	has	completed	its	investigation	into	Gray	Fox	Petroleum,
Inc.	(OTC:GFOX)	and	holds	a	very	strong	opinion	that	since	its	inception,	this	public	entity
has	been	cultivated	by	stock	promoters	for	the	sole	purpose	of	acquiring	dirt-cheap	shares
and	liquidating	them	at	artificially	inflated	prices.


As	we	recently	have	witnessed,	the	stocks	most	frequently	suspended	from	trading	by	the
Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	seem	to	be	heavily	promoted	penny	stocks	that
own	few	assets	aside	from	intangibles	such	as	oil-and-gas	lease	agreements	or	property-
purchase	agreements.	Some	examples	of	those	stocks:


Centor	Energy,	Inc.	(OTCPK:CNTO)
Nevada	Gold	Corp.	(OTC:NVGC)
Sovereign	Lithium	Inc.	(OTC:SLCO)
Norstra	Energy	Inc.	(OTC:NORX)
Southern	USA	Resources	Inc.	(NYSEARCA:SUSA)
Polar	Petroleum	Corp.	(OTC:POLR)
Guar	Global	Ltd.	(OTC:GGBL)
ARX	Gold	Corp.	(OTC:DUCP)
Far	Vista	Petroleum	(OTC:FVSTA)


We	are	of	the	opinion	that	for	several	reasons	which	are	outlined	in	this	report,	GFOX	is	at
risk	of	an	SEC	trading	halt.	Even	if	the	stock	is	not	halted,	it	most	certainly	will	collapse
once	the	stock	promotion	campaign	ends	and	shares	revert	to	their	intrinsic	value,	which
probably	is	less	than	$0.05	per	share.	We	fully	expect	shares	of	GFOX	to	drop	by	40-60
percent	very	soon,	and	in	the	long	term,	we	expect	shares	to	decline	by	90-99	percent
from	current	prices.

1.	A	lease	purchase	agreement	with	FFMJ,	LLC	is	highly	questionable,	because	the
Nevada	Secretary	of	State	considered	FFMJ,	LLC	to	be	in	default	at	the	time	the
agreement	was	signed.


2.	David	Lubin,	the	attorney	who	assisted	in	the	filing	of	the	Company's	S-1	registration
statement,	also	assisted	two	promoted	penny	stocks	which	eventually	were	halted	by
the	SEC,	including	Biozoom,	Inc.	(OTC:BIZM).


3.	GFOX	boasts	an	$85-million	market	cap,	but	operations	are	very	limited	and	their
primary	asset	consists	of	an	oil-and-gas	lease	acquired	for	$250,000.


4.	The	company	has	zero	employees	besides	its	25-year	old	president	&	CEO.
5.	The	company	entered	into	six	share	purchase	agreements	with	Rooftop	Investment
Ltd.	We	have	reason	to	believe	that	all	six	contain	at	least	one	material
misrepresentation.


6.	An	offshore	entity's	name	is	misspelled	in	all	GFOX	filings,	the	director	of	that	entity
has	spelled	his	own	name	differently	in	separate	SEC	filings,	and	the	corporate
address	for	the	offshore	entity	suspiciously	has	been	redacted.


7.	There	is	a	possibility	of	illegal,	unregistered	shares	entering	the	marketplace	because
of	an	unjustified	reliance	on	an	exemption	from	registration,	which	reminds	us	of	the
BIZM	debacle.


8.	An	offshore	financier	of	GFOX	has	participated	in	several	dubious	penny	stock
dealings,	one	of	which	was	suspended	by	the	SEC.


9.	The	promotional	advertisements	featuring	GFOX	are	incredibly	deceptive,	omit
material	information	about	the	company,	and	appear	to	violate	the	Federal	Trade
Commission's	truth-in-advertising	rules.


The	Company's	headquarters	is	a	virtual	office	in	Dallas,	TX,	owned	by	Regus,	and	we
have	attempted	to	contact	them	via	telephone	for	over	one	week	and	have	been	unable	to
get	a	response	from	their	investor	relations	team.	An	email	sent	to	ir@grayfoxpetro.com
has	also	gone	unanswered.


Company's	History


Gray	Fox	Petroleum	Corp.	(OTC:GFOX)	originally	was	incorporated	in	Nevada	as	Viatech
Corporation	on	Sept.	22,	2011.	The	company's	founder	and	sole	officer	at	that	time	was
Viatcheslav	Gelshteyn,	who	was	issued	7	million	shares	at	a	price	of	$0.001/share.	The
original	business	plan	was	to	provide	3D	rendering,	architectural	animation,	and
visualization	services.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2065913-gray-fox-petroleum-a-promoted-stock-at-risk-for-a-trading-halt 3/20


On	May	25,	2012,	with	the	help	of	David	Lubin,	the	company	filed	its	S-1	registration
statement.	That	statement	became	effective	on	Sept.	12,	2012.	As	part	of	the	statement,
the	company	raised	$20,200	by	issuing	2,020,000	shares	at	a	cost	of	$0.01/share.


Approximately	one	year	after	GFOX	filed	its	registration	statement,	the	founder	sold	his	7
million	shares	to	Lawrence	Pemble	for	$50,000.	At	the	time,	Pemble	was	a	25-year	old
residing	in	the	United	Kingdom	and	working	for	East	African	Gold	PLC.	Shortly	after
Pemble	purchased	the	7	million	shares,	he	canceled	4.7	million	of	them,	executed	an	8-
for-1	forward	split,	and	changed	the	company's	name	to	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	Corporation.


By	June	2013,	after	the	issuance	of	the	founder's	shares,	the	S-1	capital	raise,	Pemble's
4.7-million	share	cancellation,	and	the	8-for-1	forward	split,	the	capital	structure	for	Gray
Fox	Petroleum	looked	like	this:


Shares	Authorized 75,000,000	shares


Shares	Outstanding 34,560,000	shares


Lawrence	Pemble 18,400,000	shares	(restricted)


S-1	Capital	Raise	($20,200	@	$0.01/share) 16,160,000	shares	


(free-trading)


About	Gray	Fox	Petroleum


On	July	5,	2013,	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	purchased	22	separate	oil-and-gas	leases	from
FFMJ,	LLC	for	a	price	of	$250,000.	GFOX	maintains	a	100-percent	working	interest	and
an	82-percent	revenue	interest	in	the	32,723-acre	prospect	located	in	the	Butte	Valley	Oil
Play	Region	of	North	Central	Nevada.


This	lease	purchase	agreement	marked	GFOX's	entrance	into	the	oil-and-natural-gas
industry,	but	we	must	question	the	validity	of	the	transaction.	The	agreement	was	dated
July	5,	2013,	but	according	to	a	Nevada	Secretary	of	State	business	entity	search,	FFMJ,
LLC	already	was	in	default	at	that	time.	Therefore,	we	question	whether	FFMJ,	LLC	was
able	to	transact	business	and	execute	the	lease	purchase	agreement	with	Gray	Fox
Petroleum.

7/18/2019 Gray Fox Petroleum: A Promoted Stock At Risk For A Trading Halt - Grey Fox Holdings Corp. (OTCMKTS:GFOX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2065913-gray-fox-petroleum-a-promoted-stock-at-risk-for-a-trading-halt 4/20


Gray	Fox	Petroleum	Corp.	is	a	"going	concern"	company,	with	no	revenues	and	zero
employees	besides	Pemble,	its	25-year	old	president.	So	far	during	its	exploration	phase,
the	company	has	accumulated	a	deficit	of	$557,555.	GFOX's	balance	sheet	lists	$29,084
cash	and	equivalents	as	of	Dec.	31,	2013.	Despite	atrocious	financials	and	such	minimal
operations	to	date,	Pemble	took	$311,099	in	salary	for	the	nine	months	ending	Dec.	31,
2013.


The	company's	most	recent	quarterly	report,	released	on	Jan.	24,	2014,	clearly	states	that
Gray	Fox	Petroleum	is	a	shell	company,	as	defined	by	Rule	12b-2	of	the	Exchange	Act.


Between	July	17,	2013	and	Feb.	18,	2014,	the	company	entered	into	six	separate
securities	purchase	agreements	with	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.,	issuing	an	aggregate
1,130,000	shares	to	the	investor	for	total	proceeds	of	$680,000	($0.60	per	share).	We	will
discuss	these	purchase	agreements	in	much	greater	detail	in	a	later	section,	but	they
consist	of	the	following:

During	the	next	12	months,	GFOX	intends	to	conduct	geological	mapping,	gravity
surveying,	and	2D	seismic	coverage	on	the	West	Ranch	Prospect,	and	develop	an	initial
exploration	plan	to	identify	drilling	targets.	According	to	the	company's	website,	Gray	Fox
has	developed	an	"8-Phase	Exploration	Program	for	the	West	Ranch	Prospect	which	is
designed	to	identify	new	drilling	targets	on	the	32,723-acre	project."	An	initial	exploration
plan	has	been	developed	to	identify	those	new	drilling	locations,	and	the	company
currently	is	in	search	of	additional	sources	of	capital	for	the	funding	of	short-term
operations.


On	Jan.	24,	2014,	GFOX	engaged	Gaffney,	Cline	&	Associates	to	assist	the	company	with
an	independent	technical	and	economic	due	diligence	report	for	the	West	Ranch
Prospect.


Suspicious	Share	Purchase	Agreements	with	a	Foreign	Entity


A	common	practice	with	promoted	penny	stocks	is	to	raise	capital	via	Regulation	S,
enabling	an	individual	or	legal	entity	residing	outside	of	the	U.S.	to	acquire	shares	of
common	stock	that	do	not	have	to	be	registered	under	the	Securities	Act	of	1933.
Generally,	when	a	company	raises	capital	through	an	initial	or	secondary	offering,	those
shares	must	be	registered	by	filing	a	registration	statement.	Lately,	it	has	become
increasingly	difficult	and	time	consuming	to	register	shares,	a	fact	that	most	likely	is	the
result	of	a	crackdown	by	the	SEC	in	an	effort	to	curb	unscrupulous	promoters.	However,
when	raising	capital	via	Regulation	S	and	relying	on	an	exemption	from	the	Securities	Act
such	as	Rule	144,	shares	do	not	have	to	be	registered.


Regulation	S	clearly	states	that	sales	of	securities	outside	the	U.S.	must	be	made	in	good
faith	and	not	as	a	means	of	circumventing	registration	provisions	of	the	Securities	Act.	We
believe	there	is	sufficient	evidence	to	suggest	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	did	not	act	in	good

participate	in	stock	purchase	agreements	with	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	without	being
subject	to	the	registration	provisions	of	the	Securities	Act,	a	clear	abuse	of	Regulation	S.

Feb.	18,	2014	Securities	Purchase	Agreement	between	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	Corp.
and	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.


First,	we	must	point	out	the	inconsistency	in	the	spelling	of	the	name	of	Rooftop
Investments	Ltd.	Within	the	text	of	each	of	the	securities	purchase	agreements	to	which
we	link	above,	the	purchaser	is	listed	as	Rooftop	Investments	Ltd,	with	an	s	at	the	end	of
Investments.	However,	a	Marshall	Islands	corporate	entity	search	yields	only	one	result	for
a	corporation	containing	the	word	Rooftop.	The	Marshall	Islands	entity	incorporated	on
May	28,	2013,	the	one	that	has	entered	into	numerous	share	purchase	agreements	with
Gray	Fox	Petroleum,	is	named	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	-	no	s	at	the	end	of	Investment.


We	also	should	point	out	that	in	more	recent	stock	purchase	agreements,	the	name	of
Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.'s	director	is	spelled	differently.	In	the	earliest	of	the	six
agreements	to	which	we	linked	above,	the	director	is	identified	as	Renee	Berlinger.	In	the
five	subsequent	agreements,	he	is	identified	as	Rene	Berlinger,	with	only	one	e	at	the	end
of	his	first	name.	Arousing	even	more	suspicion	is	the	fact	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.'s
address	has	been	redacted:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2065913-gray-fox-petroleum-a-promoted-stock-at-risk-for-a-trading-halt 8/20


In	our	opinion,	Article	3.02	of	every	stock	purchase	agreement	between	Rooftop
Investment	Ltd.	and	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	has	been	misrepresented.	Specifically,	it	appears
Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	was	formed	solely	for	the	purpose	of	acquiring	shares	of	Gray
Fox	Petroleum.	Note	that	Rooftop	was	incorporated	just	a	few	weeks	before	July	17,
2013,	the	date	of	the	first	of	these	stock	purchase	agreements.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2065913-gray-fox-petroleum-a-promoted-stock-at-risk-for-a-trading-halt 9/20


Adding	to	our	suspicion	is	the	lack	of	Google	search	results	for	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	or
Rooftop	Investments	Ltd.	other	than	the	ones	pertaining	to	the	stock	purchase
agreements	with	Gray	Fox	Petroleum.	It	appears	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	conducts	no
other	business.


The	likelihood	substantially	increases	that	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	was	incorporated	for
the	sole	purpose	of	entering	into	stock	purchase	agreements	with	GFOX	when	you
consider	Berlinger's	past	dealings	with	penny	stocks.	On	Dec.	9,	2011,	Seahorse
Investments	Ltd.	was	incorporated	in	the	Marshall	Islands.	Several	weeks	later,	it	entered
into	a	consulting	agreement	with	Harmonic	Energy,	Inc.	(ASUV).

Proof	that	Berlinger	is	a	principal	of	Seahorse	Investments,	Ltd.	can	be	found	in	a

As	we	have	shown,	there	is	reasonable	evidence	to	suspect	Rooftop	Investment	Ltd.	was
formed	for	the	sole	purpose	of	acquiring	GFOX	shares	through	stock	purchase
agreements.	If	that	is	true,	shares	acquired	would	not	be	exempt	from	registration,	and
any	open	market	sales	would	be	illegal.	It	reminds	us	of	the	Biozoom,	Inc.	trading
suspension,	except	that	in	that	case	it	was	Rule	144	that	was	unjustifiably	relied	upon
rather	than	misrepresentations	and	an	abuse	of	Regulation	S.


Tobin	Smith:	GFOX	Promoter	Recently	Fired	by	Fox	News


Despite	awful	financials	and	a	"going	concern"	designation,	GFOX	shares	have	nearly
tripled	during	the	past	few	months,	and	the	company	now	commands	a	lofty	$95-million
market	cap.	We	believe	the	stock's	movement	is	entirely	due	to	promotional	propaganda
led	by	terminated	Fox	News	contributor	and	dubious	stock	pitchman,	Tobin	Smith.


The	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	promotional	landing	page	begins	by	suggesting	that	a	two-way
bidding	war	between	Noble	Energy,	Inc.	(NYSE:NBL)	and	EOG	Resources,	Inc.
(NYSE:EOG)	may	already	be	in	the	works.	Representatives	for	both	companies	denied
these	suggestions,	and	neither	had	heard	of	Gray	Fox	Petroleum.

7/18/2019 Gray Fox Petroleum: A Promoted Stock At Risk For A Trading Halt - Grey Fox Holdings Corp. (OTCMKTS:GFOX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2065913-gray-fox-petroleum-a-promoted-stock-at-risk-for-a-trading-halt 12/20


Tobin	Smith	enthusiastically	urges	investors	to	buy	the	stock	up	to	$4	per	share,	and
argues	for	a	$6.20	short-term	price	target	primarily	based	on	the	location	of	Gray	Fox
Petroleum's	West	Ranch	Prospect	and	its	proximity	to	several	major	oil	producers.


Alluding	to	the	proximity	of	major	producers	is	a	common	practice	for	oil-and-gas
promoters.	Smith	used	the	same	tactic	in	his	North	American	Oil	&	Gas	Corp.
(OTC:NAMG)	promotional	campaign	by	referencing	nearby	leases	owned	by	Occidental
Petroleum	Corp.	(NYSE:OXY).


In	addition	to	alluding	to	the	proximity	of	major	oil	companies,	Smith	uses	a	number	of
deceptive	and	misleading	statements	in	the	GFOX	promotional	advertisement:


GFOX	could	be	sitting	on	anywhere	between	$1	billion	to	$5	billion	of	oil;
GFOX	properties	could	hold	a	potential	reserve	of	250	million	barrels	of	oil;
An	early	$10,000	investment	could	return	$282,000	within	weeks;


The	paid	propaganda	even	includes	a	hypothetical	chart	showing	GFOX's	share	price
moving	from	$1	to	as	much	as	$141	based	on	pie-in-the-sky	oil	recovery	projections	that
will	never	come	true.

In	the	eyes	of	the	stock's	promoters,	whether	or	not	oil	actually	is	discovered	is	irrelevant.
Promoters	like	Tobin	Smith	are	getting	paid	in	cash	to	publish	advertisements	containing
outlandish	and	misleading	statements	in	order	to	convince	naive	investors	to	buy	shares
of	penny	stocks	like	GFOX.	The	advertisements	are	paid	for	by	large	shareholders	who
are	selling	stock	to	those	naive	buyers.


The	GFOX	promotional	brochure	and	the	statements	made	by	Smith	are	more	great
examples	of	the	type	of	deceptive	advertising	we	discussed	in	a	previous	report.	As	we
explained,	the	major	crackdown	on	unscrupulous	penny	stock	promotions	is	coming	from
all	angles.	In	addition	to	the	possibility	of	an	SEC	suspension,	the	highly	misleading	GFOX
advertisements	may	lead	to	an	investigation	by	the	Federal	Trade	Commission	(FTC).


While	the	FTC	never	has	scrutinized	penny	stock	promotional	brochures,	the	GFOX
advertisement	featuring	Tobin	Smith	appears	to	be	both	deceptive	and	in	violation	of	truth-
in-advertising	rules.


Past	Tobin	Smith	Promotions


Tobin	Smith,	the	former	Fox	News	contributor,	has	been	involved	in	many	penny	stock
promotions	through	his	stock	promotion	company,	NBT	Equities	Research.	Not
surprisingly,	every	single	public	company	NBT	Equities	Research	has	been	paid	to
promote	has	declined	considerably	in	share	price.	GFOX	will	be	no	different.

We	began	receiving	Gray	Fox	Petroleum	Corp.	promotional	advertisements	featuring

WSGP 4/22/13 $0.80 $1.94 $0.077 (96%)


PSON 9/18/12 $0.60 $1.48 $0.24 (84%)


GFOX 11/18/13 $1.00 $2.72 $2.39 (12%)


Smith's	four	promoted	stocks	prior	to	GFOX	dropped	by	an	average	of	90.5	percent	from
their	peaks.	Assuming	GFOX	already	has	peaked,	we	urge	investors	to	get	out
immediately,	because	the	stock	is	only	12	percent	off	of	its	highs	and	still	has	a
tremendous	amount	of	downside.


Conclusion


Since	the	inception	of	the	Fraud	Research	Institute,	we	have	published	six	short-biased
research	reports	on	small	public	companies	that	were	subjected	to	some	form	of	stock
promotion.	To	date,	all	six	of	these	short	ideas	have	yielded	potential	returns,	ranging	from
50	percent	to	99	percent.


We	analyze	trends	daily	in	this	small	marketplace	and	take	great	pride	in	always	trying	to
stay	ahead	of	future	trends.	Most	recently,	the	biggest	trend	in	the	OTC	marketplace	that
can't	be	ignored	is	the	large	number	of	SEC	trading	suspensions.	Depending	on	which
end	of	the	trade	you	are	on,	SEC	suspensions	can	be	highly	profitable	or	highly
devastating.


Take	CNTO,	for	example.	The	SEC	suspended	trading	at	$2.09,	and	when	trading
resumed	two	weeks	later,	the	stock	dropped	to	$0.11	within	one	week.	For	short	sellers,
these	returns	are	impeccable.


Gray	Fox	Petroleum	undoubtedly	is	high	on	the	SEC's	radar.	In	our	opinion,	it	is	the
promoted	penny	stock	most	likely	to	be	suspended	next.	However,	Gray	Fox	Petroleum
shares	will	be	slashed	by	more	than	40	percent	in	the	short	term,	with	or	without	a	trading
suspension.	Minimal	assets,	possible	misrepresentations	made	within	share	purchase
agreements,	a	severe	lack	of	ongoing	business	activity,	and	a	very	misleading	and
deceptive	multi-million	dollar	advertising	campaign	designed	to	sell	stock	to	naive
investors	are	just	some	of	the	reasons	we	hold	such	a	strong	opinion	about	the	impending
collapse	of	Gray	Fox	Petroleum.
