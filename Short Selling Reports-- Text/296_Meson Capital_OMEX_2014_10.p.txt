New Lawsuit From Investor Highlights Imploding Odyssey Marine-
Related Private Company
May 12, 2014 9:57 AM ET16 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


New lawsuit from a large investor in Seagrass Recovery questions shell games:
related-party transactions used to allegedly siphon money into insiders’ pockets.


Seagrass is run out of same office as Neptune Minerals under the same CEO:
OMEX co-founder John Morris.


Josh Adam, SVP Finance at Neptune under CEO John Morris, raised $27.5mm for
OMEX via Oceanica / Mako Resources LLC (via unregistered private securities).


We believe OMEX is desperate to raise capital and will require a massive discount to
the current $2.06/share to close.


A recent article in the Columbus Dispatch, home of the original investors in the SS Central
America project who have yet to see a dime, compared buying shares in Odyssey Marine
(NASDAQ:OMEX) to buying a lottery ticket. We certainly share the sentiment that OMEX
should not be considered an investment where you expect to make money but at least
lotteries are FAIR. We think a more appropriate analogy might be buying a lottery ticket
where every previous winner has been a relative or friend of the lottery organizer.


New public court documents relating to a lawsuit in Pinellas County, Florida shed light on
the web of private non-arms-length companies OMEX has been using for years, in
addition to how the co-founder of OMEX treats his investors.


An investor who has been an employee and investor in Seagrass Recovery since 2007,
after numerous reasonable attempts to accommodate Seagrass, had not been paid what
he was owed and filed a notice of default July 15, 2013 on his $1,500,000 note.


On Jan 15, 2014, a Judge ORDERED that Seagrass make its books and records available
and to reimburse the investor's attorney's fees.


As of February 3, 2014, all of the officers and directors of Seagrass resigned, including
CEO John Morris and Michael Barton (husband of Laura Barton, a current OMEX officer),
leaving just Walter Copeland as sole director and CEO.

March 25, 2014 the Judge found Seagrass in contempt of court for failing to comply with
the order to deliver books and records and reimbursing the investors attorney fees.


Related party Transactions used to Siphon Money into Insiders' Pockets


In addition to the disturbingly confrontational tone and belligerence with which the OMEX
co-founder attacks his investors, the filed complaint also questions related party
transactions that appear to be used to siphon money out of the company and into insiders'
pockets. For example, Gulf Bargeco, LLC is managed by John Morris and his wife Eleanor
Morris and is a shell company with the same office as SRI to own barges that were
allegedly leased to Seagrass at 10X fair market rates.


Given this alleged conduct by OMEX's co-founder, we question whether OMEX is utilizing
other undisclosed related party transactions to siphon money out of the company - for
example, have relatives of CEO Greg Stemm (who was paid $1.3mm in 2013) been hired
as "consultants" while not actually performing legitimate services to the company?


The OMEX Web of Private Companies


In addition to John Morris being the co-Founder of OMEX, there is a current connection as
these structures have been used with OMEX for years that we have been documenting
since October 2013 at www.omextruth.com. We have included a diagram of all of the
entities in the OMEX web that we are aware of at the moment including Neptune Minerals
and Seagrass, both run out of 5858 Central Ave Suite A., St. Petersburg, Florida.

How Does OMEX Bridge the Looming Cash Shortfall?


With OMEX's private company "funnels" unwinding:


· Mako Resources (owner of Oceanica shares) has not exercised its options to inject more
capital in 2014

· Seagrass appears to have imploded with all officers resigning


· Neptune Minerals appears insolvent and desperate to raise capital at new low valuations


If OMEX cannot raise capital indirectly via these related private companies by selling
unregistered securities (while using questionable brokers with numerous FINRA
sanctions) - they will only be able to turn to the public markets, which we believe means
selling shares at a massive discount to the current $2.06/share.


Disclosure: I am short OMEX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

JP Morgan is the exclusive advisor to Oceanica. Goldman Sachs is the advisor to Neptune Minerals. GALT invcestors
made 2x their initial investment in about a year- I dont think you'll find many unhappy investors that have dealt with
John Morris. 
"· Neptune Minerals appears insolvent and desperate to raise capital at new low valuations." For starters this is
completely false; Neptune is quite solvent and employs some of the most cutting edge minds in the mining business
and they are embarking on some pretty darn interesting stuff (you would have to go outside your comfort zone and
ACTUALLY call one of the companies- for once-that you spend so much time bashing). Second, hasn't your biggest
holding, Lucas Energy (LEI), and in which until recently you were the COB, just raised capital at the equivalent of
$0.36, a 40% discount to last sale? 
Hyppocrite (sic) much?

SA you police the comments posted, why are you not policing some of these authors that do not respond to


virtually any comments and whose articles are filled with one-sided half-truths -- direct quote "... these structures have
been used with OMEX for years that we have been documenting since October 2013 ..." (grade school math, date of
article May 12, 2014 less date documenting started [as per author] October 2013 does not equate to YEARS and in
fact does not even equate to ONE (1) year). In another part of this Supposed article the author tries to make it appear
that OMEX is responsible for the money that would go to the original investors of the SS Central America, "...home of
the original investors in the SS Central America project who have yet to see a dime ..." when in FACT OMEX gets
paid by the project and does not control money that goes to the original investors -- that would be the person that
skipped with the money before OMEX even got involved.

Come on SA there are countless good authors here on SA and some are even newbies, but they at least try to state
the facts as they know them and they follow up on their articles comments so that others may learn and they might
learn as well from the interaction, they don't try to mislead, omit or distort. I have repeatedly stated that I and I know
others would like to hear the bad with the good as far as OMEX (and other investments), but that is in regards to the
actual facts and interaction to the comments so the SA community might learn more and/or do more of their own due
deligence by further investigating what an author has stated.


A lot of us that are reading SA are reading it because we are expecting more than other sites (eg Barron's) that used
to be thought of as good are delivering.


Lest we forget Meson claimed in a previous article that he "... vowed to give any personal profit to charity... " that
arised from him shorting OMEX. He is also on record as stating about the SS Central America project "... it’s unlikely
Odyssey will find any easily recoverable gold. ...". Where is the info that OMEX has already recovered 1,000 ounces
of gold on a passby of the site (eg easily recoverable objects that requires little disturbance to the site).


Come on MESON a number of us are still waiting for you to address comments from several articles past -- as they
say inquiring minds want to know ...


Well said Shipbuilder.


As most investors in OMEX will know OMEX definitely has fluctuations in price and it appears that Mr. Market is finally
seeing through all of Meson Caps shaningans -- even if the media still has not! Up over 4%.

All.......READ CAREFULLY. THIS IS BIG. IT IS THE REASON WHY OMEX STOCK IS MOVING HIGHER TODAY.


Investors are beginning to realize that they got their wish on the HMS Victory recovery. No, OMEX does not have
permission to recover the Victory yet. BUT, the Central America recovery is like "the Victory on STEROIDS".


if there is gold on the victory, according to Odyssey's chief researcher Neil Cunningham Dobson, it is in the form of
Spanish gold moedas. These are numismatally insignificant coins that trade about 1.5 to 1.75 times spot gold. The
rare US gold coins , private mint assay bars and other artifacts on the Central America are far more valuable.


Essentially, investors got their wish about a large, valuable gold recovery for OMEX, but they just didn't realize ii. It
just came in a way that many did not comprehend, because they wanted to see the headline with "Victory gold
recovery" in it. But believe me, we got what we wanted, and more. The CA recovery IS the Victory recovery on
steroids. And gold is just laying around for the picking.


The shorts are going to feel the heat sooner than later. I think that Omex's stock price march to higher levels has just
started, and will continue as more investors scrutinize the OMEX site evaluation and better understand that the real
value for investors (in very short order) lays with the Central America, not the Victory. (Although some future recovery

of the Victory, if gold is found on that site, would still be a nice pick up too!) Very soon, more investors will pile into
OMEX while the price still has a 2 in front of it, because they're realizing it's DIRT CHEAP.

Ship, I too think picking up gold on a simple pass by is amazing and very good news. I appreciate your
fleshing out the potential collector market value.


My question is how liquid and large are the markets for items like that? Can it bear a large increase in supply
and still pretty much maintain that remarkable premium?

Well All, SA deleted my post about my opinion concerning this latest Meson article. I was certain to state carefully that
I was not bashing Meson, and I hope some of you had a chance to read it because I felt my opinion on their motives
was relevant to understanding the current dynamics of OMEX as a company and understanding the current volatility
being experienced by the stock as an investment. That is still where it's at for me and I think that this SA site
embraces that philosophy. And just for the record, I do also read and consider Meson's and others opposing opinions
as they are also providing information which can be valuable to investors. I just don't always draw the same
conclusions that they do.......but that's America. I'll be commenting again.

ship, I like you embrace and welcome opposing opinions as they help us learn more about not only a
particular stock, but different ways of looking at things -- to this regard I have learned much from such.
However, there is a difference between an opposing position and articles or comments that serve not to yield
knowledge to others based on facts or even honest opinion, but are meant for the main purpose of shorting a
stock. This is something that, unfortunately, is all to common in the political arena (from most politicians
regardless of stated ideology), and that for the most part is not a rampant issue on SA. Hopefully SA will
understand that we are not trying to curtail opposing positions, but instead have all be more accountable and
follow up on their articles.

Papa,


Excellent question and the answer is definitely yes, the market will stay solid on pricing for these type of numismatic
collectibles because they are very rare.......especially the private mint assay bars. Before Tommy T and company
brought up the first recovery of gold bars and coins in 1989-1991, the private mint assay bars were so rare that only
one or two would come up to auction every 10 years or so. Thompson brought up 532 bars of private mint
gold.......the collector market could easily absorb another 500 of these type bars and prices would rage because they

are in such hot demand due to rarity. Remember too, that these bars are even more rare if they are larger (over a few
hundred ounces) and are rarer depending on the private California assay company. The twenty dollar double eagles
also contain a component of rarity and condition that drives value. The only small downside is that many of the $20
gold pieces were dated 1857-S from the Frisco mint, so they diluted the market in the 1990's which is why they are
the least expensive of the 1850's double eagles. But even if there is more dilution of 1857-S double eagles, they will
be in mint state grades, and the higher mint state grades will always command a higher premium in the coin market.
Also understand that the collector coin market in the United States is huge and big money transactions occur every
day. There are plenty of ways and outlets to sell numismatic coins and collectibles are their established collector fair
market value.

Burned through $10mm in Q1 alone. This is actually even worse than we were expecting.

Finished paying off convertibles (in cash last few quarters), new line of credit.


But of course if nothing much comes up from the Central America and they fail to monetize or find new
partnership arrangements for Oceanica and Dorado doesn't do any charter work and no Galt like entity
provides some venture capital for a piece of future action etc, they may have to rustle up some more
convertibles.


Lot of Ifs though....

Well they did have to come up with the mobilization costs associated with the SS Central America not to mention
expenses related to the 6000 meter ROV/testing. By the way, did you see the news that hybrid deep-water ROV
called Nereus imploded while on a dive at 6.2 miles? Those things don't grow on trees and nothing is a certainty at
those kind of depths. Makes one appreciate what OMEX has accomplished doesn't it

Meson,


I agree that financial condition for any company (publicly traded or not) is important and no one who reads the articles
and commentaries on seeking alpha is ignorant of that fact. And I will say that I watch the numbers too. But, financials
and cash on hand are only one part of the equation when trying to assess a company like Odyssey Marine.


We all read the Q1 report and we all know that they took $13M to pay down debt which they paid off 61% of their debt
on the books as of end of year 2013. They also have a $10M dollar credit facility with Fifth-Third bank which they
have not tapped yet. So between their $5.8M on hand and untapped credit facility, they have $15.8 million in usable
working capital. This is sufficient for Odyssey especially when they are currently involved in a project which will result
in more revenue very soon.


The real assessment today lies in the fact that they are currently working a high visibility and high profit potential
project which has already yielded unexpected positive results. I know you don't believe the economic potential is
there, but you are a pretty intelligent guy and you have to be thinking (especially now that OMEX brought up a 1000
ounces of gold just in one 2 hour recon dive), gee, maybe there is more gold and valuable cargo down there than I
thought. And your research ability precludes that you probably already know that the gold just brought up is worth
more than $1300 per ounce. Numismatic value is real and there is an established market to sell numismatic coins and
collectibles at real market determined value.


So I agree that financials are important, but under the current captured business climate at Odyssey Marine, they
have more than enough money to capitalize and reward investors even if the Central America gold recovery is not as
substantial as many of us think it will be. Of course, as each day goes by, it becomes more clear that there is more
and more and more gold waiting in the wings of this recovery. In all my years of watching and investing and profiting
from OMEX stock, Let's just say that over the next three months, "It's all about the gold".

Author’s reply »  The $10mm credit line is only available to draw against gold collateral that they bring up
from the SS Central America, not before.

(i) $2,000.00 per coin for any $20 Double Eagle 
(ii) for each gold bar, 50% of appraised market value


It looks like their cash is roughly zero today pro forma for debt paydown post Q end and 3mm/month cash
burn consistent with Q1. That's against $3+mm payables

Well,


Not suprisingly, we have a disagreement on gold coin and gold bars value. Given that I've been a rare coin dealer and
still buy and sell coins on a casual basis, if the values you cite above are what OMEX says they are going to sell their
recovered assets for, I will personally go down to their offices in Florida and offer them $3500 per coin and 75% of

market value on each gold bar, and I will still make a large profit selling them into the numismatic market and via large
well publicized auctions.


However, I would also be followed down there by 100 other dealers and collectors who would happily pay even more
than that.


One thing is clear. Our disagreement will be cleared up in a few short months.
