Senseless Chinese capital expenditure: Trina Solar edition
The one thing we know about the solar panel industry is that it is glutted. Solar panel prices are
collapsing as has been observed many times on this blog. 
 
Trina Solar reported yesterday. Bad numbers as expected. To quote them as to the glut: 


Despite this achievement [which in Trina's case was increased sales], growth in
worldwide module capacity and peaked channel inventory resulted in significantly lower
product prices which adversely affected our bottom line results, whereby our cost
reduction was not sufficient to offset lower ASPs [ie average selling prices].


I promise you I am not telling anyone anything new here. If you are an investor in the solar-panel
industry and have not noticed a supply glut then you are completely non-observant. 
 
What is strange though is that despite the supply glut the capital expenditure in this business - that is
building new plant and machinery - goes on regardless. 
 
Here is a line from the balance sheet: 
 
 


Trina Solar Limited


Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets


(US dollars in thousands)


     
  December 31,  September 30,  December 31,
  2011  2011  2010





 
Property, plant and equipment  919,727  783,328  571,467


 
 
Property plant and equipment at Trina went from 571 million to 920 million in one year. And in the
year when the industry became hopelessly oversupplied. 
 
Moreover the rate of increase accelerated in the fourth quarter when the oversupply was obvious to
anyone to see - when anti-dumping cases against loss-making Chinese solar panel makers became
vogue. 
 
There are lots of things that might be going on here. The company might have a great new technology
which is worth investing in even though the industry is glutted (indeed the company points to its
"honey" technology). Or the company might be insane. I have my thoughts but I do not have enough
knowledge to be certain. 
 
But one friend suggested that this is just an analogue for all of China. Who cares if office buildings are
glutted? Just build more. Who cares that the high-speed-rail between two cities you have never heard
of, a railway line that consumed valuable steel and concrete by the millions of tonnes is mostly run at
a third capacity with empty trains? Build more. 
 
"Build it and they will come" may be the Chinese mantra. Usually only works in Hollywood films. 
 
 
 
John 
 
PS. I should disclose that Bronte still has a short-biased straddle on Trina - but it is a much smaller
position. We closed a fair bit for profit - but traded that bit not so well. I should have covered the short
end more aggressively when the stock was $6.

You're assuming a market-based economic model. China experts generally believe the
gov will prop up the largest 2-3 solar companies no matter what, and force the rest to shut
or merge. Therefore, it is essential that they remain among the largest to survive.  
Also, the Chinese planners claim they're going to grow their internal solar market by
orders of magnitude in the next 15 years, so negative gross margins for a few quarters
may pay off.

Racist title my ass. 
 
Well over half the capital expenditure in the world is happening in China. China
dominates steel for instance - 
 
Australia is a first derivative of that - we export iron ore and coal - 
 
If the Chinese capital expenditure is generally wasted it will end and Australia will
(economically) crash. 
 
It is a simple fact of life that the capex is Chinese. 
 
There is a view amongst some bearish fund managers (including me) that much of it is
wasted/senseless/nonsense not driven by markets. 
 
That matters. 
 
What should I call it if I can't call it Chinese?

to be fair investing through a downturn for marketshare is a time - honored strategy and
theoretically should work if you have the lowest cost of production, which Trina claims
(and on an efficiency adjusted basis they are below First Solar by a fair margin with
polysilicon at $30 / kg). Add to that what the first poster mentioned that China will bankroll
the top producers and allow the marginal to die and that China will invest in downstream
subsidy of the solar market and it's not impossible to envision TSL surviving and being
thinly profitable in the future. Whether it will ever be a business that generates good
returns on capital for shareholders is another story, I doubt it.

The Chinese RTOs were easy pickings because they tended to be small, private, and
located in politically nonstrategic sectors. You could short them with reasonable
confidence that they would not be propped up. 
 
Not so for companies in strategic sectors. Economic analysis is not enough in these
situations. 
 
The straddle is clever, since it removes the political factor from the analysis. As with all
straddles, it relies on the options being underpriced relative to the actual probability of a
move.

You may want to pick something other than rail to illustrate your point of wastage. Train
tickets are still hard to buy esp during the Spring Festival season. High speed rails are
generally well occupied even though they still may not make economic sense even at full
occupancy. Transportation by rail is still generally hard to procure. Much of the regional
coal shortage is rail capacity related not coal production related. 
If Australians can build bigger homes and account for that as residential investments, in
theory there is nothing wrong with Chinese building loss making solar producers that
actually produce something that can meet policy goals of more sustainable energy
supplies. The problem is that Chinese government policy may not reflect the demand of
Chinese populace. The mismatch produces strange bed fellows: on one hand we have
the Chinese subsidy mostly flowing outside of China up till now so essentially not
benefiting the general Chinese populace; on the other we have the beneficiaries of the
subsidy (Western consuming countries) vociferously protesting the benefits they received.
This is rather similar to the issue of agricultural subsidy in the developed countries. In
theory people in less developed countries could have enjoyed the subsidy and just go on
with their lives doing something more profitable. But in reality the inability of their society
to adapt led to charges of social destruction by the West. In China's case the roles have
flipped.

Asian includes India in most people's language. It is not clear there is an excess of
infrastructure in India. 
 
-- 
 
I will give another example though. The capital spending of the Chinese mobile phone
companies has is now flat. That is all that is needed. 
 
Do you think flat or more than flat is needed in India?

To H.Z. 
 
Rail is a great example of Chinese capex waste. It's senseless to cite the Chinese new
year travel, which is a short spike and well above normal demand; if capacity is built
according to this short spike, the overcapacity for the rest of the year will be truly
horrendous. The regular (non high speed) rail passenger ticket pricing is artificially
depressed in order to lower inflation and create shortage. This shortage is crucial for
officials to benefit personally as tickets are allocated to scalpers. Freight tariffs are also
set low to create shortage, so officials can allocate quotas. There is no difficulty in buying
high speed rail tickets whatsoever, because high speed rail is way ahead of demand in
china.

This reminds me of the SRAM/DRAM market in the 90s. I traded in/out of Micron and
watched with amazement how the memory manufacturers would continue to build new
fab facilities in the face of global gluts and industry losses. 
 
I've always been skeptical when US manufacturers make dumping claims against low
cost Asian exporters but thought it possible that the South Korean memory manufacturers
were willing to suffer losses in the short/medium term to effectively run the competition
out of business - Chaebol had huge resources before the late 90s Asian crisis and could
cross-subsidize losses for a long time. 
 
The solar case today is obviously different but I can't imagine anyone beating the
Chinese on cost. All they have to do is hold out until the competition is run into the
ground. Whether this is technically dumping is irrelevant - the competition will be bankrupt
by the time the case is settled.

The Chinese motor industry is similar - plants running at 50 - 60% of capacity, but capex
to double size typical. While the JV's with foreign brands are minting cash, the Chinese
brands are loss making in aggregate. I think that it may be much easier to pad a loan for
an expansion project to cover your existing losses than to get specific facilities extended
for working capital etc.

planned economy it merely plays an accounting role" Sir Andrew Crockett (former

The wrong questions are being asked. What should be asked is if the current capital
spending will be depreciated before increased demand justifies it. For the semiconductor
and the solar panel industry this is probably not the case. The rate of depreciation is just
too great. The infrastructure capex probably is justified. 
 
Frontloading infrastructure capex makes sense. Railroads, bridges and tunnels will still be
there in a hundred years. A high speed train line between Beijing and Shanghai that is
time competative with airlines will still be competative in a hundred years time. A slow
depreciation rate over time warrants investing in over capacity now. 
 
Applying this criteria to real estate capex raises uncertainties though. The Empire State
building, 40 Wall St. and the Chrysler building were all built for over capacity during the
Great Depression. But over the years those buildings met with a growth in demand for
office space. In China however it seems that real estate is being built with a thirty year life
cycle in mind, and it is unclear if demand will catch up with capacity within that time
frame.

IF said...


Ferry has a good point. I always marvel when driving over the Golden Gate and Bay
Bridges. I can't possibly imagine them being at capacity in the thirties. And still they are
here, meeting modern demand.

Anonymous, 
I think you are confusing lack of economic profit and non-optimal allocation of resources
with total wastage. Without price transparency and open competition you may have waste
relative to optimal resource allocation, but that is hardly proof that the whole thing is
senseless.

I'm curious about Ferry's "30 year lifespan" comment about Chinese real-estate. I
understand the recently built American houses (thin sticks of wood covered by wire mesh
and stucco on the outside and drywall on the inside, or mobile homes of even flimsier
design) falling apart after an average of 30 years, but I thought the Chinese were building
hi-rises made of reinforced concrete. How do you cut corners on a reinforced concrete
building so that it lasts only about 30 years, without making it so flimsy it collapses
immediately? 
 
A primary goal of the Chinese leadership is to erase the memory of past humiliations at
the hands of the West, by "making the rest of the world addicted to cheap manufactured
goods, the same way we were once made addicted to opium"--words of a Chinese official
in an interview that I read long ago. In all the mercantilists (Japan, Germany, South
Korea, Taiwan) industrial policy is motivated by memories of past military defeats and
anticipation of future military conflicts. Capital investment is not intended to raise future
civilian consumption or living standards, but rather to prepare for war. If capex
significantly reduces the possibility of losing a war, then it is typically a good investment,
regardless of the discount rate used, since losing a war is an absolute disaster for civilian
living standards.

H.Z,  
 
My comments were less intended to "prove" the Chinese rail capex waste (I think so but
takes a lot of space) than to simply point out the many errors in your statement about
chinese rail demand. Without understanding demand you can barely begin to have a view
on capex.

I base the 30 life cycle on common complaints of rushed real estate developments and
comments like these: 
 
"In April, Qiu Baoxing, vice-minister of the ministry, said during an industry forum that
Chinese buildings can only stand for between 25 and 30 years. In contrast, the average
life expectancy of a building in Britain is 132 years and they last around 74 years in the
United States." 
 
The reason a buildings needs replacement in thirty years time is usually not that it is
about to collapse, but that cheap and rushed construction created a building that is more
expensive to maintain than a better constructed new building. Things like sick building
syndrome will also play an important reason for the future demolition of the current
inventory.

Can somebody explain to me where the money is coming from for the increased capex?
Is it really "under the table" funding from the government, or does Trina truly have the
cash reserves (and/or bona fide credit lines) to pay for this stuff?  
 
As an investor, it makes me nervous to think that Trina's financial statements could be
providing less than the whole truth. I feel like this has been an undercurrent in the
accounting of all of the publicly-listed Chinese PV companies, but up to now there has
been no proof except for unusual line items like this one in the balance sheet.  
 
So, please fill me in: Is Trina the solar version of Enron?
