Uni-Pixel Investors Getting Fooled Again
Sep. 27, 2013 10:35 AM ET251 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Unfortunately, investors have fallen again for Uni-Pixel's (NASDAQ:UNXL) tomfoolery. We
believe that Wednesday's press release was Uni-Pixel's weak attempt at hiding the
stunning news that they have yet again failed to meet production and revenue targets.
Whereas this past summer, Uni-Pixel blamed the delay on Windows 8.1, this time Uni-
Pixel offered no excuses. We believe it is clear that UniBoss, now repackaged as "InTouch
Sensors Powered by Kodak," cannot be manufactured and that Uni-Pixel has another
failed product on its hands.


Like the nearly 70% drop this summer from a high of $38.70 to a low of $12.30, we expect
a similarly dramatic fall in the share price as investors realize that Uni-Pixel has failed with
the launch of another product. Uni-Pixel investors do not want to be left holding the bag
(or broken TMOS, Opcuity or DiamondGuard) and should discard their shares of UNXL.


Another Misleading Press Release


Investors have clearly taken Uni-Pixel's press release on September 25, 2013 (here) as
positive, taking Uni-Pixel's stock price up more than 15%. However, it is clear from the
press release that Uni-Pixel has again dropped the ball with InTouch Sensor. In fact, we
think Uni-Pixel has essentially come out and said they are nowhere close to launching
InTouch Sensor. Investors should be very wary.


Uni-Pixel has missed their shipment deadline


First, it is clear that Uni-Pixel will miss the crucial October 1 shipment deadline and that
the Company has once again delayed shipment and commercial roll out of UniBoss. For
months, Uni-Pixel has said that in order to get product on the shelves for the all-important
holiday season that the Company needed to start physically shipping product to suppliers
by October 1, 2013. On the 2Q 2013 conference call (here), Reed Killion said, "For us, the
drop dead date to ship product would be in October, October 1."


In the Wednesday press release, the Company makes no mention of imminent product
shipments by October 1. Instead, Uni-Pixel only offers a vague timeline for a "commercial
rollout of InTouch Sensors… over the weeks and months ahead." We believe that is a
clear signal from Uni-Pixel that they will be unable to meet their "drop dead date."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1717132-uni-pixel-investors-getting-fooled-again 2/57


Uni-Pixel has failed to receive product qualification and certification


Why will Uni-Pixel be unable to ship product by the October 1 deadline? It is because Uni-
Pixel has not been qualified or certified for production. On the 2Q call, Williams Financial
analyst Cody Acree asked, "Reed you mentioned going to issue a press release as you
receive those qualifications and moving towards production, did I hear that correctly that
you will come to the market with the press releases, is that correct?"


Reed answered, "Yes."


The announcement of "production level process qualification and data collection to
support and achieve ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 certifications" was supposed to be a
positive catalyst for Uni-Pixel, along with product shipment by October 1st. The fact that
Uni-Pixel has not issued a press release regarding successful product qualification and
ISO certification shows Uni-Pixel is nowhere close to production.


Uni-Pixel no longer expects revenues in Q4


Lastly, a subtle change in wording shows Uni-Pixel is moving the goalposts yet again on
investors. Through their history, Uni-Pixel has been very clear about the importance of
revenue generation. In the 2Q 2013 press release, Uni-Pixel stated, "We continue to be on
track for generating production revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013."


CEO Reed Killion reiterated that goal and said, "Our goal is production level shipments
and revenue in Q4."


Now, the Company makes no mention of fourth quarter revenues and instead simply
states, "We remain on track to begin commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2013."


We think it's curious that Uni-Pixel no longer mentions revenues. In fact, there is not one
single mention of the word "revenue" in the entire press release. Why was there such a
clear change in wording? What is Uni-Pixel trying to hide from investors?


Eastman Kodak is an unreliable partner


We also find it curious that Eastman Kodak CEO Antonio M. Perez is prominently quoted
in the press release and supposed to add gravitas. This is the same CEO that led Kodak
into bankruptcy while grossly missing financial targets.


For example, in 2008, Kodak CEO Antonio Perez promised revenues of $7.7 billion to
$8.3 billion for fiscal year 2009. Kodak missed the mid-point of that target by $400 million
and came in at $7.6 billion, which was below the low-end of the revenue range.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1717132-uni-pixel-investors-getting-fooled-again 3/57


(Click to enlarge)


The story repeats itself in 2010. Kodak issued guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.7 billion of
revenues, and missed their target by another $400 million.


(Click to enlarge)


Then in 2011, fresh after 2 consecutive years of revenue misses, CEO Antonio Perez
issued 3-year forward 2013 revenue projections. He forecasted that total revenues would
grow approximately 1% from 2010 levels and reach $7.4 billion by 2013.

(Click to enlarge)


It should not be a surprise that Kodak failed to meet his projections.


Two months before Kodak declared bankruptcy in January 2012, the Citi analyst covering
Kodak expected 2012 revenues of $6.2 billion and $6.4 billion in 2013, which was well
below Kodak's original forecasts. That is a miss of nearly $1 billion!


The inclusion of comments by Kodak CEO Antonio Perez was supposed to bolster Uni-
Pixel's case. However, astute investors should look to his performance while at the helm
of Kodak to judge his credibility.


The Competition Has Passed Uni-Pixel By


Meanwhile, during these "delays," competitors have quickly surpassed Uni-Pixel, entered
the complex touch screen ecosystem and received actual production orders. For example,
Shenzhen O-Film Tech recently announced orders from 6 major PC vendors for a low-cost
ITO replacement touch panel. The article can be found here. According to DIGITIMES, the
major PC makers include Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY),
Asustek Computer, Acer and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), and the orders are for
notebooks, tablets, and smartphones. Eager holiday shoppers will find many O-Film
products, but they will not find any Uni-Pixel products on the shelves this Holiday Season.


Moreover, it's not solely small competitors like O-Film Tech. Just last week, Sharp
(OTCPK:SHCAY) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) displayed their own versions of large,
metal mesh, touch screen panels at the Touch Taiwan and International Display
Manufacturing Conference. At the conference, Sharp showcased 20", 32", and 70" touch
panels, and Microsoft highlighted a 55" touch display that Microsoft made with Corning.
These aren't small competitors by any means. Not only is UNXL falling behind, but it is
also clear that UNXL has to compete against behemoths in the competitive touch screen
space.


Conclusion


So let's review:


Uni-Pixel has not received production qualification and ISO certification. They
promised a press release and have not issued one yet.
Uni-Pixel also promised fourth quarter revenues. However, based on Wednesday's
press release, Uni-Pixel will miss their "drop dead" deadline of shipping product by

certified.
UNXL believes having quotes from Kodak CEO Antonio Perez gives them cover. We
know Antonio Perez's track record when it comes to financial projections.

Author’s reply »  So this article at the end of last year - http://seekingalpha.co... - projected a minimum of $96
million in product revenue this year and at least $1.56 EPS. Instead, it now appears that total revenue will be
$5-10 million and that product revenue will be approximately $0. EPS now looks to be negative yet again. As
far as I can tell, there's no reason whatsoever to cover. All I see is a perennial failure that has repeatedly
misled investors.

I don't know why I bother to respond to these articles given that they are so full of misinformation, but here I go again:


1. There was nothing misleading about the press release. It clearly states that UniBoss was rebranded, had some
nice quotes from Kodak CEO to show Kodak's support, and discusses some long-term goals.


2. The October 1st date is suggested as when Uni-Pixel needs to have a PO in order to have screens in products by
Christmas. Even if they don't, they can still ship 2 weeks later and have screens in products by early January.
Tablets/Laptops/Devices are made year round, not once a year.


3. You state that they unequivocally will miss the October 1st deadline, but offer no proof as to why. It is still very
possible that they get the waiver and ship by then.


4. Microsoft does not make touch sensors... They are just marketing the product.


5. And now you attack Kodak as well? Big whoop, they missed their goal by a few %. That isn't exactly fraud.

Misleading press release ? Or yet another misleading article designed to allow short-sellers to cover ? Tomfoolery ?
Absolutely ... and shareholders will NOT be fooled by short-sellers again. Kodak will make 100% sure that "In-Touch"
will be a hit. They don't have 41 employees working full-time on UNXL build-out for the fun of it. Still LOL at 5 million
short-sellers who can't yet figure out what EPS of $3.14 will bring PPS wise. Cover your short that's in trouble or face
bankruptcy very soon.

Kodak doesn't have customer line up for touch screen so they are hedging their bets with the other touch
screen. This is a new business for kodak so they will be learning how to enter a new market. The ceo even
said it is unfamiliar business.

what boggles my mind here is that this stock can even be at half the levels it previously achieved in spite of
the management's timeline now being widely discredited, and more importantly in spite of the myriad
competitors that ARE actually executing in the thin film metal mesh space. the price story is gone, the margin
story is gone, and yet the stock still trades at half of what it used to. should be more like 5 on its way to 2.

day on the upside when the bell rings, especially so close to PR about orders and production. Only thing I think about
? EPS of $3.14 in 2014 and even if just $1.00 ? A minimal 3-bagger from here.

Alpha Exposure,


This 'summary point' is false: Uni-Pixel also promised fourth quarter revenues. However, based on
Wednesday's press release, Uni-Pixel will miss their "drop dead" deadline of shipping product by October 1,
which will be impossible to meet since they have not been qualified or certified.


It is not impossible to meet, as they can get a waiver. Furthermore, they can still get qualified and ship later in
Q4, thus creating Q4 revenues. These products, however, will most likely not be on shelves in Q4.


Next:


You state that many asian manufacturers have surpassed Uni-Pixel since they have been shipping product.
True, but is the product as cheap and/or the same quality? Uni-Pixel differentiates themselves for being both

inexpensive AND high quality. There have been many reports that the metal mesh from youngfast, O-Film,
and others is low quality and therefore relegated to low-end products.


Next: 
You state that Sharp and Microsoft are creating metal mesh sensors, but provide zero evidence to support
this. Most likely the products they were showcasing were using metal mesh purchased from some other
manufacturer. These companies aren't in the touch sensor space.


I could go on, but I'm bored. As is evident, I was working my way up from the bottom of the article... Found 3
major errors in just the last 2 sections. Start submitting those corrections!

Author’s reply »  None of these are errors in the article. Try again. For instance, I stated that Sharp and
Microsoft are making large touch panels as an example of companies that are today producing large format
touch screens and that don't need UNXL. I did not state or imply that either Sharp or MSFT is making a new
touch sensor which would compete with UNXL (if it ever ships a product). I genuinely think you've lost
objectivity on this company. IMO it's a scam and this is its third go at scamming people.

Nice lies Alpha Exposure. But lets re-read your article how you wrote it:


First, you talk about competitors such as O-Film. Then, you directly say: "Moreover, it's not solely small
competitors like O-Film Tech." (this implies that whoever you list next is also a competitor). You then talk
about Sharp and Microsoft making touch screen panels. So far you have a lie by implication.


But then, immediately after describing Microsoft's / Sharp's products, you state: "These aren't small
competitors by any means. Not only is UNXL falling behind, but it is also clear that UNXL has to compete
against behemoths in the competitive touch screen space."


This time you DIRECTLY state that Microsoft and Sharp are competitor's (large ones at that, behemoths). So
yes, this is a blatant error. You directly stated and implied that both Sharp and MSFT are making a new touch
sensor which would compete with UNXL.


28 Sep 2013, 12:16 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Your reading comprehension is quite poor. I don't think anyone believes that MSFT is
making touch sensors. It's a commodity business that will revert to commodity margins. It's also a business
where UNXL is falling behind the competition. Remember this article where you touted the stock?
http://seekingalpha.co... How are those earnings projections looking now? You're the one misleading
investors.

>>Two days before the announcement with their first purchaser (possibly Dell), the company announced in an
analyst call that they expect to produce 60,000 units/month by the end of Q1 2013, 175,000 units/month by
the end of Q2, 700,000 units/month by the end of Q3, and 1.3 million units/month by the end of 2013. <<


Chris - the above quote is in your December article. Surely you must concede at this point that the company
has totally blown its targets and timelines, and anything management says about same must be taken with a
whopping grain of salt, no?


Question - at what point would you throw in the towel? If still no commercialization or meaningful revenue by
the end of Q4? Q1? Q2? A company trading at a $220 million valuation with virtually nil revenue needs some
real revenues at some point. If we are at the end of Q3 2014 and still nothing but fluff will we just talk about
how exciting 2015 will be, etc?


You can only move the goal posts so many times without it getting ridiculous.

STJ
such a ridiculously moronic piece, a last gasp short covering attempt for sure. Only problem is the stock won't go
down more than a few percent on this one and production orders coming within weeks. That's pretty evident in this
recent statement by the company:


"With the unmatched capabilities of our touch sensor technology,  
and the strength and support of Kodak and UniPixel’s other global partners, we look forward to  
making the commercial rollout of InTouch Sensors a success over the weeks and months  
ahead.”


Yes, that does say commercial rollout within weeks. Twist it any way you want. The meaning is clear for anyone who
does an objective read.

If the first article this guy wrote would have been true this discussion wouldn't be happening and UNXL would
be dead in the water. Here we are. The first article was based around the "facts" that the product was
complete rubbish. Pretty sure this isn't the case.

You can believe whatever you want re: the accounting article. If the stock goes to the mid $20s I will publish

misread the press release.

I love reading comments on UNXL stories. Longs accuse shorts of misinformation year do the same. When is options
expiration?


27 Sep 2013, 05:50 PM


Loren Paz, Contributor
This sounds very similar to the last UNXL short article with not making the August 1 deadline, competitors pulling
ahead, etc. But then again most long and short UNXL articles all revolve around the same main points. Either they
say their touch sensors is sham, will never make it to market, and the stock will become worthless. Or they say the
touch sensors will revolutionize the industry and the stock will go to the moon.


However it seems everyone writing aren't touch screen experts and are just stock traders pretending to be. So they
don't really know any better on the success or failure than anybody else.


Like other story stocks with little to no any revenue, UNXL is a highly speculative play. History doesn't seem to be on
UNXL's side but it's certainly possible they finally got it right and can commercialize a product. But it is a lot safer to
wait until they have actual production orders before buying, unless you feel like gambling.

I am short. I agree with others that the press release was not substantial. Yes, they are re-branding the product from
uniboss to intouch. I don't think OEM cares about that. The end consumers wouldn't care about that since intouch is
not a recognized brand.


UNXL seems like it will miss its deadline Oct. 1. If you don't ship the product by then the OEM can build it in to the
product and missing crucial holiday selling season. This is not trivial as some longs make it out to be.


28 Sep 2013, 08:47 AM


chkecheze
The issue isn't whether they ship by Oct 1st. The short thesis has always been that they will never ship at all
because the company is a scam. Now the shorts are saying only that they won't ship this yeay. I guess now
they are admitting it will ship but just not by Oct 1st. Shorts are a joke and will eventually get theirs. I will lmao

advantage is gone. I think this is a scam and the stock will go to $5 in the medium term. Is this clear to you?


28 Sep 2013, 10:33 PM


smilytmm
My point is that a rally in the the share price due to the press release was not warranted and that is the main
reason I entered my short position.


On other short thesis, I think that there are several other points.


1. Insiders are selling


2. Management over-promise and under-deliver; historically failed to deliver


3. The product, uniboss or intouch will not deliver the competitive advantage that the management says and
the longs believe. It seems that the longs believe everything from the management without proof of actual
production which is odd.


I think UNXL had been promoted systematically and it is now in a downtrend spiral that it will not be able to
recover nor deserve. With that said, I will cover my shorts when I make enough profit.

Is it not true that UNXL claimed their unnamed OEM (supposedly Dell) returned the Uni-Boss screens & there would
be a delay in roll out due to the new Windows OS update... NOT because they didn't actually work? IF there had been
NO delay of the Windows updated OS and UNXL were telling the truth then presumably that OEM would now have
their product on the shelves. So how come they are still talking of finding a resolution to the quality control issues "in
the weeks & months ahead"? It appears to me that it was very lucky that the Widows delay did happen and that OEM
(whoever it actually might be) didn't hold their breath coz they obviously still wouldn't have anything that works from
UNXL even after all this time! One thing has now become VERY obvious... that roll out delay had nothing whatsoever
to do with Windows.... Uni-Boss didn't work & those screen were useless.... thats why they were returned! No wonder
they have to rebrand Uni-boss, it comprehensively failed despite all the lies & I believe it's been ditched. I believe they
have in conjunction with Kodak... now come up with something that's rather different & its not just a new name. In
other words its start again time (yet again!!) it's just that they haven't admitted it yet & that's why UNXL are still in
"weeks & months ahead" mode. Just about where they are always are! I wonder what excuse they will come with next

From Uni-Pixel’s 9/25/13 release:


“Kodak CEO Antonio M. Perez said: ‘Working together, Kodak and UniPixel are quickly approaching the global market
rollout of a functionally printed touch-screen sensor. In light of the initial interest for this product, we believe this
solution has the potential to shake up this large and growing market. The superior technologies that both companies
are contributing to this product will enable us to produce and deliver touch-screen sensors at the very highest level of
quality, durability and value. 'InTouch Sensors™ Powered by Kodak' exemplify the kind of breakthrough solutions you
can expect from the new Kodak.’”


There are no financial projections in this statement from Perez, therefore the forecasting errors you cite, which are
taken out of context and not unusual for companies in the consumer technology arena, have little relevance.


What IS relevant, Alpha Exposure, is Mr. Perez's successful 25-year career at Hewlett-Packard, where he rose to the
senior management level and headed one of Hewlett's most successful businesses, its consumer products group,
which included Hewlett's dominant laser printer business, as well as its ink jet printer business. Perez is a respected
technology executive whose integrity has never been questioned, to my knowledge, and is to be commended for his
efforts at Kodak, which as you know, he joined in 2003, which was far too late to save Kodak from the ravages of the
shift from analog to digital in the photography business. He is to be commended for his efforts to bring Kodak through
that crisis in a way that preserves and utilizes Kodak's dominant technological expertise in film.


It's doubtful Mr. Perez would associate himself with and spend millions of dollars of shareholder's money on a scam.

Moreover, your article did falsely state that Sharp and Microsoft are competitors of UNXL, which was followed by the
following post from you at 10:54 pm on 9/27 that falsely denied you had said that in your article:


“None of these are errors in the [9/27] article. Try again. For instance, I stated that Sharp and Microsoft are making
large touch panels as an example of companies that are today producing large format touch screens and that don't
need UNXL. I did not state or imply that either Sharp or MSFT is making a new touch sensor which would compete
with UNXL (if it ever ships a product). I genuinely think you've lost objectivity on this company. IMO it's a scam and
this is its third go at scamming people.”


From your 9/27 article, under the headline “The Competition Has Passed Uni-Pixel By,” showing the aforementioned
post from you to be false:


“Moreover, it's not solely small competitors like O-Film Tech. Just last week, Sharp (SHCAY.PK) and Microsoft (MSFT)
displayed their own versions of large, metal mesh, touch screen panels at the Touch Taiwan and International Display
Manufacturing Conference. At the conference, Sharp showcased 20", 32", and 70" touch panels, and Microsoft
highlighted a 55" touch display that Microsoft made with Corning. These aren't small competitors by any means. Not
only is UNXL falling behind, but it is also clear that UNXL has to compete against behemoths in the competitive touch
screen space.”

Seeking Exposure thinks it's all a scam, yet here's a comment a few weeks back from an insider actually working with
the company -


"Synaptics CEO expresses confidence in Uni-Pixel, Barron's says 
Synaptics (SYNA) CEO Rick Bergman stated in an interview with Barron's following his company's fourth quarter
report that he continues to have enthusiasm for partner Uni-Pixel (UNXL), which Bergman said is helping to bring
down the cost of touch control for PCs."


Seriously, how dense do you have to be after reading that to still think it's just a big scam? Who carries more

Having enthusiasm for a partner is about all he could say, would you expect him to say our partner is a fraud
or our partner stinks? It doesn't have to be a scam to fail, do you think that Sony developed Betamax and
thought it was a scam?


29 Sep 2013, 12:48 PM

The partner has inside knowledge of developments. Do you think he would have said anything at all about
UNXL if things were not tracking well? Chalk it up to one of those obvious common sense things...

I don't know how old you are but common sense has never been that common and is often wrong. You should
learn to read, listen, between the lines this especially true when listening to CEOs talk. 
Having said that I still think there is a small chance that UNXL could become a small player but I wouldn't bet
on it at this point.

Alpha Exposure-


You come off as a bit of a simpleton by pointing out that the word "revenue" is missing from the latest press release
and accusing other of having poor reading comprehension skills while being completely unaware that the term used in
the press release - "commercial production" - means the exact same thing as "production revenue" which was used in
prior press releases.


It's pretty clear that you're either dishonest or a complete dolt but I'll allow that those may not be mutually exclusive
attributes in your case.

Alpha Exposure, 
You apparently believe many things that Kodak, Synaptics, Dell, Intel, N-trig, etc. clearly do not believe. With
your dishonest track record on this stock, I cannot even convince myself that you truely believe this. IMHO, I
think that you just want others to believe this "opinion" could possibly be reality and to act or choose not to act
accordingly.


30 Sep 2013, 10:17 AM


bullchin
Jbird. Just the fact they didn't achieve ISO certification and mention about a wavier should tell you Dell or Intel
would not be interested in it. The ISO certification is a world wide acceptance and that is a fact. Alpha
Exposure is not offering opinion but a result of reality since the reality of not meeting the deliver deadline is
just additional to their management skill of they can't execute their production plan (lack of experience).  
However you choose to keep believing management of what they will say next till they don't meet again.  
LOL. Please provide strong fact why people should be buying this stock however don't offer what
management said. We already know they been saying it for years.


12 Oct 2013, 06:24 PM


JBird61
"the fact they didn't achieve ISO certification" - that is not anything close to fact. Please provide the slightest
evidence (not just your opinion) that there has been any snag in the ISO certification process. That process is
not complete and is progressing as expected, yet you say it is "fact" that they failed. Just more bullchin FUD.


13 Oct 2013, 11:24 AM


bullchin
Am glad you are still around Jbird. I wonder if you realize some of your longs has dropped out.  
Hmmm, you said they are not finish and still progressing with ISO certification. In one way we both agree ISO
certification is important to obtain for world wide acceptance.  
How do you think it will take to get ISO certification and be in production if they received the rollers in later
June? Most of the people really thought they had it before that time. Just reading some of their claims as
lowest cost alternative metal mesh when they never have anything in production so how claim be made?  
"Leadership in performance engineer films" When they never sold anything film at all then have agreement
with kodak, the film specialist.  
Just read all their materials of how great these products they have but never production yet so you know they
are struggling to put it together.


They hired a pro at production to shorten their production time early in May but still no production yet.  
On conference call they met with potential purchase order and now waiting for a waiver in the coming weeks
since they didn't provide iso certification. 
Therefore to me this is a failure but you think more time as they are progressing.  
How long do you think it takes to get ISO certification? Less than 3 months otherwise they ran into production
time.

UNXL MANAGEMENT IS HOSTING A CONF CALL WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND ANALYST CODY
ACREE ON WEDNESDAY AT 10AM PST. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SHORT INTO IT.


30 Sep 2013, 01:00 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
I have a crazy question. If the CEO stated this on the August 8 conference call:


"We're confident we will achieve this target since last month we already reached equipment capacity of 200,000
square 
feet per month in our Texas facility. This keeps us on track to ramp up equipment capacity to 700,000 square feet per 
month by the end of September...."


If two months ago you could produce a bunch of stuff, and people want to buy the stuff, wouldn't you be selling some
stuff?


30 Sep 2013, 01:23 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
CEO quote from exactly 5 months ago (April 30):


"We met our milestones of shipping production level product by the end of April by fully calibrating and qualifying our
printing and plating lines. We've begun shipping initial batches of sensors to our PC maker licensee. The initial
shipment quantities on the production line started at 50, moving to hundreds and thousands over the next several
months."


Q: Okay. And then so do you still think, I mean when do you think that we would actually see the first products using
your 
product on the shelf?


CEO: "It's a process that we believe will put us on the shelf in the September timeframe third quarter."


On the shelf. Pretty definitive. Now we are talking about "commercial production trials underway" and "initial interest"
and "commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2013".


I'm still pretty hazy on why, with supposedly 200,000 square feet of capacity online since June they aren't able to sell
anything?


Is it not obvious they are having trouble getting something done here?


I don't really care about Kodak (a train wreck of a company). To me it looks like UNXL is a customer that wants to use
some of Kodak's empty space and Kodak equipment (sitting in excess inventory???) to try to make a go of it. Why not
say some good things about how encouraging it all is.

right, that's why the product was rebranded as "InTouch Sensors Powered by Kodak" ..... because they are

What's the downside for Kodak? Are they really risking anything? Any real capital or cash against this
project? What is their downside if UNXL crashes and burns - almost none. Yet seemingly they get a huge
piece of upside.


To me it looks like Kodak simply gets a very low cost call option on UNXL actually delivering, and at a
minimum some PR talking about how they are involved in new exciting areas (can't talk about film cameras
any more...). Maybe UNXL is even paying them for use of the Kodak name. We would know if they actually
disclosed some details of this material contract.


"Powered by Kodak" = "Intel Inside" = little value.


In my opinion.


30 Sep 2013, 02:31 PM


bullchin
no downside to kodak as this is a new business for them as well. It is all within the bankruptcy report with sky
high projections. Most former shareholders of kodak mentioned using unxl stock price as a terrible indicator to
project future earning when unxl didn't have any positive earnings.


30 Sep 2013, 07:52 PM


bullchin
Your right, they have manufacturing problem making their touch screen because they never done it before so
they are fumbling to get there.  
I like your Kodak. Train wreck company. No one realize that yet.  
The interesting point between kodak and unxl is both are using each other to boast themselves to
shareholder of potential explosive profit with unproven product. Both failure to display product development
cycle and doubt they even started that yet.

Keubiko... If you read the last press release, UNXL admit they have a new exciting film... it was a little dressed up but
that fact is there if read properly... It wasn't just about a new name for an existing product. Uni-boss no longer exist as
a product... probably because they never did find a way of testing the sensor without breaking it. Now that the

delay as was claimed then the unnamed OEM (Dell?) would now be installing Uni- boss. They are not because they
can't, it no longer exists despite all the supposedly intensive help & support in getting it validated by major companies.
So what happened to that contract? Anyway... all this means is that we are now at the beginning of yet another
exciting new era & UNXL in conjunction with Kodak will now proceed to develop another product "in weeks & months
ahead" incorporating the new film mentioned in that rebranding release. In the meantime they are now talking to
Asian companies about this amazing new product that they hope to develop. The Dell contract will have to wait a
while because they will have to go ahead & release THEIR new devices incorporating Windows 8.1 next month but
rather unfortunately with ITO screens! Maybe by next years 4Q they just might be in a position to bring InTouch to
market.


30 Sep 2013, 03:32 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
LindonT (and others),


InTouch is not a different product than UniBoss. It is the same product, rebranded. This is why the headline of
the PR is "Uniboss Touch Sensor Film Rebranded as InTouch Sensors"


The PR even specifically states that InTouch uses the UniBoss Production Process


30 Sep 2013, 04:07 PM


LindonT
Yes... UniBoss is a production process & that process remains. But the film they have now started developing is
named PRO-CAP. They are doing that & have given it the moniker InTouch because the last lot was a load of crap &
didn't work! If it had, then now that the Windows OS delay is over & if the claim about the only reason for the delay
was the delay of the OS. Instead of a pack of lies, then Dell would be back on track & ready to stick it on the shelves
in time for the new OS release.


30 Sep 2013, 05:31 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
pro-cap is projected-capacitance touch (http://bit.ly/16DBDyU)


It is a type of touch sensor, compared to IR or Resistive, for example. UniBoss is for pro-cap styled touch
sensors. This is nothing new. Stop spreading false information.

Chris... they & YOU claimed that UNXL would start shipping late August or early September. It was claimed that time
period was missed due to the delay of the Windows OS update. If the UniBoss sensor DID work as YOU claimed it
did... & that the delay in UniBoss was NOT due to any design flaws... then where is it now? Why are they not shipping
it now? Why are they only now entering into commercial trials if all that was not a pack of lies? Why are they now
STILL talking about the weeks & months ahead? THAT film, with what they claimed they could get over 70% yields
from, just like the first film which they could only get 20% yields from WAS obviously just as flawed at the time they

There is another company very similar to UNXL. It is NEON, if you review SA under NEON and their press release
and their conference, it says the same thing. NEON is only 6 months trailing unxl.  
To the long, it may be a buying opportunity for the same reasons.  
For Chris, you mentioned about NEON on other sites as well.  
You are truly working on these two stock with the same vapor.  
You have the same approach for both stock with questioning other people regarding their info.


Now i question your info as well working on these two same stock.


Both are touch screen too.  
You are in a class by yourself. I am sure for not, even the longs will question you and wonder how much you are
invested in both stocks saying the same thing.

Only UNXL management claim they are the least cost metal mesh touch screen at $20. 
They didn't sell anything yet but claim to be the least cost. It was only an estimate from their demo.  
Are they going to sell it to OEM or Kodak at that price or higher and how much?  
What is the actual cost of making after production is set up?  
What are the variable cost that will make it more expensive?


30 Sep 2013, 10:40 PM


bullchin
UNXL already said the burn rate will be the same next quarter, how is that possible?  
They didn't expense out of cash to kodak yet so should 24 million come out 3rd quarter or will it be 12 million? No one
know but we do know cash needs to come out to pay for it. 
Plus pay for the other machines, additional salaries??? 
What else?  
If they do expense 3rd Quarter then negative earnings will be awful high?  
Am sure institutional investor will be looking for milestone set up between kodak and unxl of who will be responsible
for what and when.

I don't get it, how can a scam be expecting 2 purchase orders that will produce revenue in Q4 and have 20 active

target put out by Williams.


02 Oct 2013, 06:57 PM

Key word is expecting 2 purchase order. How do you convert expectation to actual sales? What do you think
is involved?  
20 active engagements means what? Trade exhibit for more in depth displaying?  
How much earnings per share would you like to have in order for stock to be at $60.00?


Remember ITO is currently cheap so switching is the cost factor plus how much and how long does it take to
test our UNXL touch sensor for durability?  
Temperature, humidity, dropping, scratching etc.....  
You can say but give it to some kids and see how fast it can last.

Bullchin, 
Do you only ask uninformed questions? Do you do your own research or do you rely on others to answer your
every minimal concern? Is your only purpose to create uncertainty and doubt in readers' minds?


"Remember ITO is currently cheap" is a blatant falsehood! Cheap is a relative term, and yes, prices have
decreased some. But calling ITO cheap is like calling gold cheap at $1,300/oz because it is down from its
peaks the last couple years. http://bit.ly/17wgNiy


Which is more durable in a kids hands, Bull, a thin plastic flexible sensor or one made of an ultra thin friable
ceramic material on glass? (FYI Bull, that was a rhetorical question, because the answer is obvious to every
reader.)

The quality of the script is not very good (not sure why).


Alpha Exposure - What are your opinions on the conference call today? With UNXL having Intel and Kodak in its
corner, do you feel like your position has lost some water? If not, what about the conference call did not convince
you?


02 Oct 2013, 09:57 PM

It's easy Kingry. All stock prices price will fall in line with earnings. Stocks are earning driven or value driven.
UNXL is currently enjoying future expectation of enormous growth but reality is entry to existing market
requires much more hurdle to pass.  
What is everyone's earning expectation for 3rd quarter? It will be high negative value for sure.

Kingry,


Thanks for the transcript. The audio call is also posted on Unipixel's website (http://bit.ly/VxnEPy).


As for Alpha Exposure's response.... it doesn't matter what Uni-Pixel says on the call, he will always say that
they will never produce. Given that the Oct 1st deadline was internal (as was reported multiple times back in
August), and on this call Reed was very confident to receive the waiver and a PO within the next month, I
would say that the future is very bright.

Yes, Bullchin, earnings will be negative in Q3 similar to Q2 in my expectation - as burn rate has NOT
increased much from the million per month (despite you trying to imply repeatedly otherwise). However, we
were just told yesterday that Q4 will have $10 million in engineering revenues PLUS volume production
revenues. With only 12 million shares outstanding, how do you figure that to be in EPS for Q4 and for the full

Reed has always been confident when he speaks every year and never deliver his promise. He struck out
more than one home run, raising equity is his greatest victory in his pass history.  
His presentation is good but his execution of his strategy has been poor.


04 Oct 2013, 07:10 AM


bullchin
We already know Kodak also partner with another firm to produce ITO next to UNXL therefore we Intel will
most likely partner with another firm till they make final decision of who will produce for them. Given no ISO
world acceptance, UNXL failed big time.


12 Oct 2013, 06:27 PM


Buysider2
Bullchin: You are confusing capital expenditures that are recorded on the balance sheet with costs that are expensed
in the income statement. The $12 million UNXL will invest this year to help set up the Kodak manufacturing facility will
be primarily a capital expenditure and be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and not as a cost in the income
statement. In the future, the annual depreciation of that asset will be recorded as a cost in the income statement.


Also, the so-called “burn rate” does not usually include capital expenditures like that $12 million. “Burn rate” is a term
ordinarily used with developmental or start-up companies and refers to the monthly, quarterly, or annual rate the
company is “burning” through its capital as it develops product and gets into production. What exactly is included in
the “burn rate” tends to vary with the person using the term, is often defined by the person using the term, particularly
if his or her definition varies from common practice, and can sometimes be determined by the context in which the
term is used.


Ordinarily, the burn rate does NOT include the variable and semi-variable costs of production that are included in cost
of goods sold (COGS) and which are subtracted from sales revenues to get gross profit.


Burn rate usually refers to so-called “operating expenses” which are usually labeled "Selling, General, and
Administrative (SG&A)" costs and "Research and Development" costs on the income statement, and which are
subtracted from gross profit to get operating profits, which operating profits are also known as “Earnings Before

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1717132-uni-pixel-investors-getting-fooled-again 33/57


Interest & Taxes (EBIT)." EBIT usually excludes both interest costs and so-called “Other Income” items, which other
income is usually income unrelated to the company’s chief business. If we subtract the net of interest costs and other
income from EBIT, we get pretax-profit.


Finally, the unit cost of UNXL’s product at the COGS level will depend a lot on the yield of its process (the defect rate),
as defects must be expensed even though they are not sold. For a given yield, the unit cost is easily determined – it is
the materials and variable labor cost per finished unit, which costs can be closely determined by the design and by
prototype runs that measure average labor productivity at full-volume production rates, plus a per-unit allocation for
the defective units that are scrapped and a per-unit allocation for the expected manufacturing overhead items to be
included in COGS at full-volume production rates, which costs, except perhaps for the full-volume defect rate, can be
closely estimated in advance.


Regarding whether InTouch is the lowest cost product among its competitors: A leading analyst writing on UNXL has
publicly estimated that the initial unit manufacturing cost for the InTouch product, before Kodak's and UNXL's SG&A
expenses related to the product, and included in COGS related to the product, should be about $4 a unit, and that
therefore at a unit price of $20 a unit, the gross profit that Kodak and UNXL will share according to a formula that has
not been disclosed but that UNXL has said will be “equitable” (implying roughly a 50/50 split for both parties, but not
less than 50% for UNXL) will be $16 a unit (before UNXL’s and Kodak’s respective SG&A expenses related to the
InTouch product).


That would result in an unusually rich gross margin for a company (Kodak) supplying manufacturing services to an
OEM (UNXL), but one that would seem to be justified by the unique and critical technological, engineering, and
manufacturing resources, expertise, and skill Kodak brings to the effort. As a small company with limited resources,
it’s hard to see how UNXL could enter this competitive market and supply the huge volumes its customers will need
without a company like Kodak as its supplier.


That also leaves a lot of room for a reduction in the $20 price should the competitive situation require it and still leave
room for substantial profits, particularly at the volumes one can envision might be attained. Again, the key question
here does not seem to be whether or not the product is the lowest cost product in the market, but whether or not it can
be manufactured in the high volume customers need, with the yield that is necessary, and with the quality and
performance in the field that UNXL’s OEM customers and end-user customers will require.


03 Oct 2013, 11:45 PM


bullchin
buyside. That was awesome analysis but not convincing enough bc the 4.00 per unit does not add up to materials
costs analysis. the 20.00 selling price is not what was mentioned in all unxl communication.


I do agree on the analysis of expenditure however cash was not debit 12 million or 24 million which has not been
established as of yet.

Williams Financial is a well known UNXL pumper and there was not a open Q&A session. All the questions were
made by Willians!!! Nice set up! 
UniBoss/InCell is not qualified.The in-line inspection equipment is not installed!  
Killion is certain that he will get a waiver to start shipping and that there will be production in Q4. 
TRANSLATION: The waiver is not happening; there will be no production in Q4.

Ivan: 
TRANSLATION of your post: your bias will never allow you to believe a word that comes from UNXL
management or the independent analysts that cover them - you choose to conclude the opposite.


04 Oct 2013, 10:06 AM


STJ
Analyst: And Reed when might we start to here more about the economics of the Kodak relationship?


Reed Killion: When we start shipping the product.


Analyst: So as early as possibly the first quarter?


Reed Killion: In Q4.

Ivan Jimenez, Contributor
He is lying you know. 
That was not a conference call, that was a PR stunt. 
The real question that where not asked?


What is your yield?


Are the test units qualified?


The Windows 8 excuse was just BS.


You guys are getting fooled and you will pay for it. 
Mark my words.

Agreed 1000% 
Reed skate thru the production process.  
Large companies such as INTEL or Kodak requires ISO certification. No waiver from these companies.  
They are still in documentation stage and can't get it right.

So when the analyst he corrected talked about shipping as soon as Q1, that analyst was referring to 2015. 
Wow, I think that statement pretty well sums up the credibility of the shorts here.

The price of touch solutions in general are dropping dramatically. Even Reed Killion mentioned the price war!
http://bit.ly/1fPiZI5. Also http://bit.ly/1fPiXzM. A report from Fort Mill Times states that Cambrios Technologies silver
nanowire is the sensor of choice for Levono's 20 inch AIO & the OEM will begin shipping the device shortly:
http://bit.ly/1fPiZI6 ohm-to-deliver-advance... Seems that's one major player who don't go too much on the UNXL BS
about world beating technology! Reed Killion also spoke about how much they can get out of their 17 inch width film...
that equates to almost 432mm. Atmel's film is 500mm wide.... rather a substantial difference when considering the
metre volumes involved & yields. Atmel stated in their last call that there will be news of a tier one OEM XSense
release early this quarter at the latest. In the meantime In UNXL's is now entering commercial trials with their world
beating, ever so robust (so much so that they can't test it without breaking it) and cheap as chips sensor. They even
promise commercial roll out this quarter... that is truly world beating... the stuff ain't even validated for mass production
yet!

"Our technology allows these companies to get there.The companies that are trying to get there now based
on the fact that they have capacity are not seeing the profitability numbers that they would like to see
especially to invest in more capacity when you got a OGS established which is a one glass solution and
based on ITO cost from 300 million to 500 million to get to a 1 million units a month capacity as opposed to
our solution where the capital is equipment cost are around 15 million. The dynamics are changing and we
are on the good side of that curve."

Intel, is looking at all producers no doubt and yes they do make mistakes, although I think you were implying
that because intel shows interest you should be an investor in UNXL. Intel would be a far better use of your

It does with Atmel too! Also much the same can be said about Kodak being open for business. Their
agreement with UNXL is not exclusive! They are working with a silver mesh company & have said they open
to using their experience with film with any metal mesh company. Far to much importance is being attached to
UNXl working with other companies. It means very little.

The insider should be selling but Reed said no. I think the investment bankers or market maker are tying his hand

Any comment on whether unxl will be putting in 12 million or 24 million to Kodak?  
Looking at cash balance, the money is still at unxl so how do you start partnership without putting money in...... 
Kodak will start outline the production cycle where UNXL has to perform and meet these milestone Plus iso testing
then product testing. It will take at least 9 month to accomplish therefore it will not be 4Q.

Your so right, the volume is light and think they are having a hard time maintaining price level without anymore buyer.
The institutional conference didn't really add volume to push high so you know the interest is very little at this point.

No ISO certification is a big thing and probably have production issues such as embossing copper or other metals
without losing resolution, or without cracking the thin film sheet being produce given the heating temperature. It is a
complicated process and yet early in the year they said they were producing but somehow not being able to produce.  
Bet, they are looking for someone to help this thru this hurdle as they are stuck.  
To make it flexible, to create iso certifaction, and keep cost low but likely cost will go up then find someone who wants
to buy their product.


07 Oct 2013, 09:43 PM

Your comment is pure speculation on your part, Bull, that any production problems exist. Can you offer the

All discussion has been about administrative issues waiting on the customer, certification, and when a PO will
arrive, yet you want to turn the discussion to 'somehow not being able to produce' which exists only in your
mind.


Your comments demonstrate a clear lack of understanding of their process and even the fundamental physics
of PET film. I'm not sure why I bother responding to such bungled disinformation.


08 Oct 2013, 09:41 AM

Do you have evidence that production is running?  
With what read Reed said about getting a wavier already tells me that production is a problem, less than
getting certification plus still lack product testing.  
Product cycle develop is something i do know.  
No billion dollar company will risk the chance of losing their brand quality image without certification. How
long does it take to put their product into production? It has been more than 6 months of saying it will be
deliver and it is not. They have no experience putting anything in production so they are buying time.


09 Oct 2013, 07:15 PM

Jbird. The fact that unxl management has not delivered what they had promise or they have re promise
something else is evidence that they are not close to selling their metal mesh.  
What keeps you long, Jbird? Their promise and re promise of what is to come?? still waiting for that promise
in June or July?  
What other hurdles do you think they have now before actual SALE is made? Saying purchase order? sale is
the key.

announced that they will the same touch solution in the whole range of their future releases at least for the next 6
months. The Samsung Round on sale in S.Korea tomorrow will also has flexible tec. It will be either their own tech,
named Youm, or Atmel's XSense.... I'm betting XSense. LG nexus 5 due out anytime soon will have flex tech
according to market reports & so will their new LG Z, they have also said everything they do from now on will have the
same tech. One thing for sure... It ain't gonna be InTouch Sensors Powered By Kodak!!! this also ignores a whole
plethora of Asian copper mesh makers who are already shipping... ( & causing very dramatic price falls in touch
solutions generally) Probably low grade stuff but they are filling their boots!!! Graphene... only has one 
problem they need to resolve how to turn OFF the signals... once they can do that all other touch solutions will be
history. Graphene... For those who don't know the story it is 100 times stronger than metal & only one ATOM thick....

After reviewing all the comments, opinions, etc. and then looking at the performance of the stock, I believe that the
shorts have a better position. How many CEOs would tell the shareholders, analysts, potential buyers the
unvarnished truth while experiencing problems with production, certification, cost increases, etc.? The answer to my
parenthetical question is not many or even none. His answer to production comes as 200,000 sqare feet to 700,000
sq ft tells you nothing. They bought a bigger building. They still have to build machinery to make the device.
Production is still a long time coming.

Carclo have just announced that in a judgement issued 7th October they have won the right to have their claim that
UNXL have stolen their technology... heard in the English high court. The announcement includes a statement that
this means that UNXL will be responsible for the majority of Carclos legal fees. As a long time Carclo holder I'm just
thinking about all the lovely royalties that will flood in if UNXL ever do get it together & take over the world of touch

The only reason UNXL filed to have the case heard in a Texas court is because they have a blatantly obvious
case to answer, Carclo then filed to have it heard in a federal court... UNXL didn't even want to risk that for
the same reason. It was then referred back to Texas. The Texas judge has obviously agreed with the English
judge that UNXL DO have a case to answer & most probably wouldn't want to be embarrassed by finding
against a local resident. Kodak are already in for a sizeable chunk of any revenues.... their is now a strong
possibility that UNXL will try to reach an out of court settlement with Carclo... They are culpable & they know
it!

Further to Carclo's 6 month Trading Statement issued to the London Stock Exchange, Carclo state that XSense is in
full production... they have already accrued £1.6m revenue since start of shipping to Atmel last month & WILL BE
released in a number of tier one OEM devices over the next 6 months.


10 Oct 2013, 07:25 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
LindonT:


I did not see any indication in the half year update by Carclo that XSense is "in full production," or that Carclo
has "accrued £1.6m revenue since start of shipping to Atmel last month." All I saw was that a start-up of "full
scale manufacture of coated film" has begun, and that Carclo has recognized CIT revenues (which also
include the amortization of the $10 million Atmel prepayment and other revenues not related to XSense) of
£1.4m for the 6-month period April-September (meaning, virtually no production revenues related to XSense
for that period).


No product on any store shelf in any country currently contains XSense.

That "full scale production" START UP actually commenced in April 2012 with dismal results, and has
resulted in the complete commercial failure of XSense, with zero products on the store shelves for reasons

a secret disruptive agent put in place by the ITO industry to try to disrupt disruptive technology from disrupting ITO
world domination from whatever company & simply hate the fact that ITO's time is coming to an end!


10 Oct 2013, 02:34 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
LindonT:


I don't understand. Are you saying that Atmel shipped thousands of nonqualified sensors for free to Asus last
year and that is why Asus never put them in any product sold in a store (but instead gave them back to Atmel
to demo them to gullible investors)?


Remember, in its annual report, Carclo told us about Atmel’s announcement in April 2012 of the commercial
launch of its XSense touch sensor product based on CIT’s fine line technology and that production shipments
to multiple customers were expected to commence shortly...


How can the ITO time come to an end, when for a 10-inch sensor, the two-ply ITO patterned film is about $0.3
per diagonal inch, while XSense' patterned film is about $1.0 per diagonal inch, that is 3x as expensive? Or
when in the past 9 months there have been over 1 billion ITO touch sensors shipped vs zero XSense sensors
shipped?


10 Oct 2013, 03:10 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
I found LindonT's comment about RxR being a secret agent for the ITO industry to be quite tongue-in-cheek
and humorous. But when RxR then defends his position by quoting random ITO facts, it just becomes even
more hilarious. Perhaps LindonT is correct about RxR's secret position.


Also, to RxR, you can't possibly quote ITO prices in terms of a diagonal inch because the price changes
drastically depending on the size of the screen. Also, there is no way it is only $0.3 per diagonal inch for ANY
size, given that the newest iPhone (with a 4" screen) has a $41 touch module.


Now yes, I know, a touch module isn't the same as just the patterned film.... But given that most reports state
that the sensor is at least half the cost of the total module, this would put the sensor at a minimum of $20, or
around $5 per diagonal inch, not $0.3.


10 Oct 2013, 03:38 PM


LindonT
Chris... your wasting your time buddy! He hates all things & all companies regardless of their name, which threaten
ITO domination. Don't forget this is someone who visited the continents of the world trying to track down Xsense in
the Asus with a magnifying glass & maintains that it was conclusive proof that those products from Carclo's initial
prototype production line never existed because he never found any proof that they did. A truly awesome undertaking!

Bear of the Day:


Uni-Pixel (UNXL-Free Report) designs and develops functional electronic conductive films and durable wear
resistance films used in sensors and display applications for consumer and industrial products. The $200 million
company had virtually no revenues in 2012 and is projected to have only $21 million this year.


Uni-Pixel's patented technology, the Time Multiplexed Optical Shutter (:TMOS), can be used in mobile phones, digital
cameras, notebook computers, televisions, as well as display and interactive technologies in the energy,
transportation and entertainment industries.


The future of touch, sensor, and gesture technologies looks bright, with Oppenheimer projecting the consumer
gesture control market to be the fastest growing segment as it expands fivefold from $850 million in 2013 to over $4
billion by 2017. That's a compound annual growth rate of 50%!


But the recent backslide in sales at UNXL has forced analysts to cut 2013 earnings estimates in the past two months
from an expected gain of $0.46 to a loss of 5 cents. And just last week, that profit outlook got cut in half again with the
consensus now at a loss of 10 cents for the year.

the 24th at 13.74, bottomed on the 30th at 12.96, then rallied hard through August 13th to 17.43.... Nice try
Zacks. Now they are trying again with a bearish mention on October 9th, then again on the 14th (today).
Perhaps we will get one more attempt from them before a huge rally?


Here is Zacks' commentary: http://bit.ly/1bRtk4s

Real Time 1
Chris what's in it for Zacks to be negative? I see that the CFO sold another 31000 shares under the "automatic sale"
system (a system only set up in the last two months.) What in it for the CFO to do that if the company is so fantastic?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1717132-uni-pixel-investors-getting-fooled-again 45/57


In the previous thread where I pointed out serious red flags in UNXL's q1 2013 financing quarter where the results
appear contrived (I was CEO of a small but profitable public company for nearly 20 years) you said I was "grasping for
straws".  
However I do not have a position in Unxl short or long so what do you think my motivation is?


Despite all the noise about Unxls manufacturing partners and manufacturing efforts the all important identification of
who the supposed pc manufacturer customer is still not identified to this day.


This would not be a problem except that Unxl has a history in the past. of getting involved with great manufacturing
partners and efforts and not delivering revenues from customers. What's in it for Unxl not to say who their main
customer is.


I can see what's in it for Kodak to be positive. They are getting paid by Unxl to set up the facilities.


By the way does Unxl have any contingent obligations to return the money they received? Where is the disclosure of
these agreements in the SEC filings? Especially the one recorded as revenue in q1 2013. 
When the CFO sets up automatic sales of shares and the company continues not to identify there customer I hardly
think that "I am grasping for straws"  
it is you that appear to be doing that.

Real Time 1,


It isn't very hard to imagine why a firm like Zacks might 'time' their releases to coincide with certain unrelated
events. They haven't commented on a single analyst update until now, and all of a sudden they released a
negative note on UNXL on Thursday and Monday.


As for insider selling, you may notice that it is pretty much just the CFO and a few directors. The directors are
paid 100% in stock (no cash salary), so it makes sense for them to sell a small amount every now and then to
collect income. The CFO still owns lots of stock when you include his options/warrants. I have heard rumors
that his personal financial advisor has been encouraging him to diversify his portfolio away from 100% UNXL.
I think most of us here would agree that it is generally wise to have a diversified portfolio.


It is true that the PC Manufacturer is still a mystery, but the ecosystem partner (who was previously a mystery
yet strongly rumored to be Intel) was announced to be Intel. This further gives me confidence that the PC
Manufacturer is Dell.


Kodak, another large company giving credence to UNXL, is not getting paid by UNXL in any way. Quite the
opposite, as they are putting forth ~$12M of their own money to build out facilities. If UNXL fails tomorrow or
next year, Kodak is out ~$12M.


As far as I have been able to understand, UNXL does not have any contingent obligation to return the money
they have received from the PC Manufacturer / Intel. So far this only amounts to $5M (in Q1), with around
$15M expected in Q4 or early Q1 '14.

Confidentiality for competitive reasons is commonplace. This would be at Dell's request, not a decision left to
UNXL.

Real Time 1
You still have not answered the question what's in it for Zacks? What's in it for me to spread "FUD"? You may very
well be correct about the CFO's reason to sell his stock.  
It is also is possible that the CFO just plain views the investment as too risky and entered into an automatic sales plan
as a graceful way of getting out of the stock. 
Wake up and see the world the way it is!


14 Oct 2013, 04:17 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
Real Time 1,


I don't think anybody is saying that UNXL is a risk-free sure thing. They are saying that it is a very good bet,
i.e. large reward for the amount of risk.


As for Zack's... You don't know who there clients are. You don't know the positions of their clients. How
exactly does Zack's make money? It is not unreasonable that somebody connected with Zack's could have a
financial interest in UNXL going down. Thus they use Zack's as an outlet to spread FUD.


You may notice that many of the points that Zack's made in its article weren't even accurate. Clearly the
"analyst" didn't do very much research and was just rushing to throw something out there.

still progressing very well. The analysts (many of whom didn't exist back in December) are still projecting
$3-$4 in EPS for 2014, however I think that UNXL could actually come in higher.


There are many factors of course, but I don't think most investors realize the explosive potential of UNXL's
growth. The capacity is there, the interest is there. Nobody ever wants to be first though since it is "untested"
in the real world. The PC Manufacturer is boldly taking the first move, and they will be rewarded thusly, but of
course they are also being very cautious and making sure to test, double test, and triple test everything. Once
InTouch is in a product, I expect many other companies to jump in quickly. There is a reason Uni-Pixel is
building out so much capacity.


14 Oct 2013, 05:53 PM


smilytmm
As I am short on it, I don't believe that will come true since no evidence have been presented that would
indicate that.


To me, UNXL keeps saying wait till next year for the big return and from what I can see, they just keep
rehashing the same story to raise money from investors; paying themselves handsomely.


Chris, looking at your profile and the history of articles and comments, it appears that you are a hardcore long
who have all of your eggs in UNXL. I hope for your sake that you have hedged position on this.

Tecradar.pro have reported that Intel have sent 13.5 inch silver nanowire reference designs to OEM's in an effort to
introduce it to a wider audience. Far too much is made of Intel being UNXL's ecosystem partner... they are an
ecosystem partner to many other companies including Atmel who they have also helped with reference designs which
have since been sent to OEM's, Intel have no allegiance to UNXL whatsoever. Dell's shareholders have now agreed
an offer to take the company private... their supposed contract with UNXL (if it even exists) is therefore now open to
cancellation. Chris... your claim that you've "heard rumours" about what personnel financial advice has been given to
a member of UNXL's management team is BS... to try to give that piece of BS credence by suggesting what a wise
thing it is to have a diversified portfolio is scraping the bottom of the barrel... much the same can be said about your
"understanding" that UNXL do not have any contingent obligation to return any money they have been paid... you
have no idea what the terms of any contract are, nobody does.

so one morning in the weeks ahead you wake up to announcement of a waiver in combination with a Purchase Order

The CEO can get away with saying pretty much what he likes under the insurance umbrella of the 'forward looking
statement' without risking jail time... he's experienced enough... he's been doing it for years! But even if he gets the
ISO waiver, (which BTW is a damming inditement of this company that they need a waiver.... ISO qualification would
have been driven through & sorted by any professional & responsible management team a long time ago) they got a
much bigger problem... testing it & validating it for mass production, the same problem they've had all year. Testing it
without breaking it. The same problem this guy said they had resolved & were ready for shipping on last April's call!
When they done that they got an EVEN bigger problems... their market is shrinking before their very eyes.... Kodak
will relive them of some pretty substantial revenue... & Carclo are after what's left!

Kodak recently posted some job postings for operators of the printing/plating machines for the purpose of
creating touch screens with their partner Uni-Pixel. Clearly Kodak thinks they are going to be producing very
soon (operator, not engineers / installation teams).

Chris... "these will be the first operations positions to be filled... etc. etc." "the successful candidates will initially focus
on learning the mastering and printing elements etc. etc." It takes around 6 months to train operators for what are
highly skilled operations... even when they have some prior appropriate experience in the field. How strange that only
now are they advertising for the FIRST operation positions to filled. After the interviewing & short listing procedure is
completed the lucky chosen ones should be ready for action just in time for the 2014 3Q. Unfortunately the market will
have long since been divided up by whole host of touch solution manufacturers by then. Apart from Cambrios with
silver nanowire there is a whole host of others who have already joined the copper mesh party in recent months. The
market has become so congested that there are now reports of company casualties expected next year due to the
cost of touch solutions dropping like a stone! The Chinese have been a notable omission in the metal mesh space,
probably because of their vested interest in ITO... but now even they have started coming to play! On a further note,

Your right again LindonT.  
Notice, this is still an project initiation stage in product development cycle with much more hurdle and steps to
accomplished before QA testing so at best, this employee can be move to another position with the other
touch screen process.  
Remember Killon said the machines were placed end of June so we are now in Oct, what did they do in the
last four month? Just a new name. They still have to test market the product before showing and test it to get
certification which Texas plant didn't accomplish and looking for a wavier.  
Who will really give a wavier in such high competitive place, there are other alternative ITO ready to sell.


16 Oct 2013, 09:30 PM


Chris Hofmann, Contributor
LindonT,


I actually disagree with you and you continue to show how ignorant you are of this subject matter. The current
employees have been and will continue to act as temporary operators until more permanent ones are able to
come in. Furthermore, you don't think a company like Kodak has a few operator's hanging around that they
can transfer over if needed?


A company will only go out and hire permanent operators once they have a need for them, i.e. once the
process is completed and works. No point hiring operators if the process might not work. What do you say
then? "Congrats on getting the job, but unfortunately we actually don't need you because the machines don't
work properly.... oops!"


This hiring announcement tells us that Kodak now has full faith that the operation is successful, and now they
need to start thinking about the future operations, not the manufacturing / engineering / installations.


Perhaps it will be 2014 3Q when the first official operator is hired and trained, but temporary operators will
happily get the job done until then.


17 Oct 2013, 08:49 AM

Chris.. so you believe that up to now UNXL have only used "temporary operators"? What happened to the
operators that were involved in its previously validated, ready for shipping incarnation last April? Were they
only temporary operators? How come its Kodak who are doing the advertising & are going to be the employer
& not UNXL? Why, if testing equipment installation, testing, validation, production & sales are all expected to
be completed this month are they only now thinking about employing "permanent operators" (the FIRST
positions to be filled!!) which wont be available for operations till around this time next year! Your quite right to
say there is no point in hiring operators if the process did not work... "oops"... wasn't it supposed to HAVE

worked as long ago as last April!!! by your own definition you've just admitted it never worked before! The
truth is, your whole concept/excuse of temporary/permanent operators is fiction. It didn't work, they have not
proved it does work & if it ever does work it won't be until the end of next summer at the earliest. UNXL are
now the bit player in this partnership, it is becoming obvious that Kodak are taking over the whole project. The
world has moved on very considerably in the last few months... InTouch Sensors Powered By Kodak with its 6
+/- 1 thickness is optically inferior to XSense which is now of such quality that its unrecognisable from the
even the sub 5 micron lines they had only 12 months ago, UNXL rolls are only 432mm wide where
ATML/CAR have moved to 500mm wide. The implications of those two difference alone are huge & obvious
when considering yields & scaling up to larger screen sizes. Factor in Cabrious Tech's ClearOhm silver
nanowire which is intended for middle end devices & it becomes obvious who the two main players in this
space are going to be. At best, UNXL with its inferior mechanical embossed version of copper mesh is going
to be competing at the low end of the market sometime next fall... & that is already VERY heavily congested.
Cambrious already have Acer, Levono & NEC on board. ATML 3Q call is due 30th this month, expect to see
they have Samsung & LG on board. UNXL are talking about licensing Asian companies... they need to!

Chris Hofmann, Contributor
LindonT,


Everything I said was in reference to the Kodak facility, which is not the same as the Lufkin Facility. You
clearly don't know how their partnership works. Big surprise to all the shorts... UNXL isn't just 'renting space'
at Kodak. Kodak will be the company actually manufacturing 'InTouch', hence why it is called a manufacturing
partnership. So yes, obviously, Kodak is the one doing the hiring.


There is also a big difference between 'working' for prototypes/small-runs and 'working' for purchase orders.
The process has worked for a while, but they still had to make various tweaks here and there in order to
receive a PO, which clearly Kodak now thinks they are about to receive.


17 Oct 2013, 10:57 AM


LindonT
Chris... yes, I'm well aware why they called it a "manufacturing partnership" & also the revenue implications of that!
Your assertions about working on prototypes & "the process worked for a while, but they still had to make various
tweaks here & there"... in view of all the BS we were fed about it last April & since.... Is nothing short of priceless!!! No
worries... they'll carry on "tweaking"

Actually no... No reason to because Carclo unlike UNXL isn't a one trick pony nor is so incredibly hyped up. I've held it
for around 4 years so already doing quite nicely, also of course although Carclo could reasonably said to be
capitalised around the same sort of area as UNXL the sp is lowly priced. ANY share of the touch screen market even
a very small slice will cause a nice swing upwards... no one expects astronomical rises... but the future is of CIT is
VERY rosy! It'll do for a while longer yet, at least till Graphene makes its presence felt & then all other touch solutions
will be history. All the major PC OEM suspects have teams working on its development, Samsung have the record for
the number of patents for it... a listed English company have the licence for a procedure called Catalyx which uses a
catalyst to produce it from biogases such as methane, seriously overcoming the traditional production costs... many
companies are already producing sheets of it for other applications, it's known as the hardest substance ever found,
100 times stronger than metal, superconductive & only one atom thick & completely flexible. The one remaining
problem is how to turn OFF the signals, there are companies all over the globe working on that & once its resolved
then we will have the definitive future of all things 'touch' .... & many other applications across the whole industrial
world.

Thank you bullchin, in the light of Chris's new claims that the original UNXL production line was only working on
prototypes/small runs & worked for a while but they had to make tweaks here & there & after all we were told about it
& how many thousands of rolls it was going to be pushing out by September & claims that it was fully validated &
ready for shipping orders to Dell. I would like to ask why it is STILL not yet in full production. What was the outcome of
those 'tweaks' on THIS one particular print line. Forget the new lines being installed... just think about this one original
print line. Even IF ( a ludicrous if) we are now only moments away from qualifying the new installations... WHY is the
line that has been in existence since last year STILL not operational if UNXL have not been lying in their teeth. The
ONLY reason that those 50 rolls were returned was because Dell changed the design... NOT because of any design
FLAWS... that is what we have been told! It is totally obvious that line is STILL not qualified even now & never has
been because the process DIDN'T work, despite all the incredible claims for it over the last year! EXACTLY the same
false claims that UNXL are famous for as outlined in the Barron's article that Bullchin recently posted. The headline at
the top of this Article is absolutely on the money... Investors HAVE been fooled yet AGAIN over the last year... &
Chris's statement about "tweaks here & there" is all the proof you need.... but incredibly even now are unbelieving that
they are STLL being fooled.

LindonT,


You enjoy playing your word games. But it is rather childish.


Name a production process that doesn't tweak on a regular basis, much less a new and developing process. I worked
in the steel industry for 15 years using what was basically the same process developed several hundred years ago.
We tweaked on a daily basis and made major capital improvement tweaks annually trying to reach higher production
rates and better yields and economics. Your argument that an outsider mentioning tweaks is proof that the UniPixel
process doesn't work is such a stretch that you have a hard time convincing yourself - your readers are not swayed.


Funny that 'Dell' and Intel are foolish enough to be PAYING UNIPIXEL TO BUILD OUT THAT PRODUCTION that you
claim to be complete lies and utterly non-functional.


I thought it funny that you accused RXR of being an ITO industry shill while YOU ARE CLEARLY A CARCLO SHILL.
None of your 'opinions' about UniPixel can be taken with less than a block (not a grain) of salt.


19 Oct 2013, 10:40 AM


bullchin
Jbird. I am glad you were a steel expert. You are quite familiar with how cost of making steel in the past
versus cost of making it now. We already seen many steel companies default in the 80;s because import was
killing their business model and manufacturing process was expensive nor competitive.  
New management came and revamp making it more efficient to stay as ongoing steel company including
merging.  
Taking the same concept as you mention, you have to acknowledge unxl have never manufacture anything in
their life except to raise money so why are you optimistic of their manufacturing process without ISO? Even
you would agree getting ISO is one important aspect of global sale.  
Intel and or Dell as you mention wouldn't be involved unxl because they are smart firms and smart firms don't
deal with shames, right? Intel and Dell are exploring stage of reviewing only. They are not committed to
setting up milestone yet so you know they are not even close.  
Let's say i can use carbon graphite to make replacement steel beam, would you talk about how I would
manufacture that cheaper and how i was going to do it before buying it from me? What questions would you
ask me? I trust you are steel expert because you said so.

UniPixel process didn't work is that the print lines he spoke about are still not in production & no new orders have
been received regardless of Chris's imagined tweaks here & there! 6 months out of production is an awesome lot of
tweaking! Or do you imagine that they ARE in production, maybe stockpiling all those thousands of square feet of
screens... if so, to who's design? UniBoss didn't work & that is why we are here 6 months later with zero production of
a saleable product despite being fully calibrated & qualified 6 months ago & why no new orders have been received
since. The reason the UniPixel process doesn't work is because the process is a mechanically embossed process
which is fundamentally flawed. Nomatter what the ultra fine tolerance the mechanical side of high speed, precision
equipment is manufactured too it will require constant re-calibration to allow for the microscopic wear almost as soon
as the equipment comes in to use. That is why they couldn't even produce 50 rolls of satisfactory quality. That is why
they have trouble quality controlling it... the results are always going to be inconsistent, especially when working down
to around 6 microns. Chris's guess... (& obviously its no more than a guess) that it "worked for a while" is more than
likely quite a good guess... but at 6 microns give or take 1... a very short while... it's gonna take a lot more than a few
tweaks here & there. That writing has been on the wall for a long time & many others have realised it... most notably
amongst UNXL's most ardent supporters (along with Chris) Green River Assets (GRA) . The fact that UNXL's
attempts to have Carclo's claim that they are a bunch of robbers heard in a Texas court have been rejected by a
Texan judge speaks volumes. Carclo announced their intention to sue in the summer of last year... & the papers were
duly filed with the English high court in December. It is my belief that UniBoss originally started life with a similar
etching process to Carclo's. I believe that process had to be quickly changed to an embossing technique because of
that announcement to sue! The whole process has been a rushed & botched effort to avoid litigation & having their

whole project legally cancelled. Using a mechanical process for high speed embossing at anything like 6 microns
doesn't work & never will work.

I have been screaming exactly during the last year.


How long will the machinery run until the plates need to be replaced and the equipment recalibrated?


I think that the wear and tear of plates at 6 microns will be almost instant. And these will need to be replaced
after every run forcing a recalibration of the equipment. Not only that but even temperature can change the
consistency of the resin complicating things more. Not to mention that the inspection equipment could
damage the sensors...


The cost of recalibration and plates will eat any profit and significantly reduce any yield; making the process
not cost effective. But the longs will see this happening until it is too late.

Ivan: Absolutely true. The analogy a precision engineer used for me was a formula 1 race car engine. In car
computerised re-calibration is constantly going on even whilst the race is in progress, but even so, a new
engine is already being prepared for the next race a couple of weeks later because the one that completes
the race is only fit for being binned. Bearings, couplings & drive shafts wear! Rollers have bearings, couplings
& drive shafts. Even the slightest microscopic wear when working to an accuracy of anything like 6 microns
will cause havoc. One way of keeping production going to try to meet purchase orders... is to build lots of
production lines! Not really a sustainable business plan tho!! Especially when 6 microns & 17 inch film has in
anycase already been left well behind by other competitors!

I believe that that's the real reason they made so many production lines before qualifications. 
When Carclo/CIT only had a pilot one that got qualified and then they expanded.  
Too many unknowns here to be an investor, there is no way to determine what type of yield they will have if
any.

Exactly Ivan... Installing so many lines when they are not even producing from one that was supposedly fully
operational 6 months ago & no new orders received since tells the story. I also wouldn't be surprised if their
next 'blame it on others excuse' will be .... "sorry folks but contrary to our hopes the waiver wasn't granted but
we will continue our scheme to become ISO qualified & remain laser focused on fully calibrating & qualifying
the new installations"

Absolutely. Ivan.  
This becomes inconsistent product leaving Intel and or Dell with unreliable products tarnishing their name.

lol. He will likely say that or say our partners will provide us more time to become iso certified in `1Q 2014

JBird. What questions will you ask during their 3quarter conference that will be meaning for you?  
I doubt you give an honest answer.


19 Oct 2013, 10:07 PM


LindonT
Bullchin... maybe Jbird is unsure what to ask. A couple of pertinent questions in order to clarify things would
be to ask what the percentage of saleable yields actually were after fully calibrating & qualifying the first
production line last April and also if they expect the same sort of percentage from the new production lines.
We might then learn if the suspicion that their process requires several production lines to achieve over 70%
saleable yields... is unfounded. Another question might be to ask why they "surprisingly" failed to provide their
UNXL appointed expert witness (Judge John Ward) in the jurisdiction case... with all the material evidence
concerning the NDA 2010 agreement. http://bit.ly160ioNa

I've covered my shorts on this till the Q conf call. The CEO may attempt to spin the negative and the longs may bite
again. If so, I will short again.

STJ
100 of the Jan '15 60 calls just purchased this morning...


23 Oct 2013, 10:41 AM


bullchin
STJ meaning someone sold those calls to hedge their position.


23 Oct 2013, 07:18 PM


STJ
of course it is much more meaningful that somebody was willing to bet the stock will be above $60 (plus the
premium) in 14 mos, than somebody merely hedging a short position in the stock, or the other case which
would be somebody just betting the stock goes down. Note the steady rise in open interest of this contract
lately.

"While the notebook segment remains cloudy, we do believe SYNA has won the touch controller for Samsung's
Galaxy S4," analyst Rajvindra S. Gill said. "In our view, the initial design was won by ATML, but SYNA ultimately won
out due to its Hover technology. An initial teardown (i.e., China handset) has verified that SYNA is supplying the touch
controller while ATML is providing the sensor hub. Based on our estimation of the Galaxy S3 sell-through in 2012 -
around 80MM units and our forecast of 100-120MM in 2013, we believe this sizable program could add an
incremental $100MM-$120MM of revenues and $0.50-$1.00 of Non-GAAP EPS. Moreover, our detailed analysis
reveals SYNA has gained significant share at most of the leading smartphone platforms – NOK, BBRY, HTC, LG and
SYE – and maintained its dominant position at Huawei and ZTE."


And SYNA we know has been singing the praises of their relationship with UNXL.
