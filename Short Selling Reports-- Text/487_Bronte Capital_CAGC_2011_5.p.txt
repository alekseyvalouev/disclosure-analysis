China Agritech: Getting Wayne Tsou of Carlyle to explain
Chinese excellence in nanotechnology production
China Agritech - as has been discussed in previous blogs - manufactures and loads 200 thousand
tonnes of dry fertilizer and 13 thousand tonnes of liquid fertilizer using a mere 105 manufacturing staff
and just over 6 million dollars in capital.  
 
Obviously these staff are super-strong - as just filling and sewing closed the fertilizer bags and loading
the trucks would be problematic.  My previous posts have focused on the Herculean efforts of staff
just loading trucks - and only at the Anhui plant.  The rest of the company of course has to be much
bigger than that. 
 
It also appears that the manufacturing is considerably more sophisticated than I thought.  For
example [China Agritech has] combined innovation and technology in [their] liquid and powder
products utilizing nano-honeycomb embedding technology and microelement deep complexing, which
makes them more environmentally friendly and effective with a higher content of nutrients than
traditional organic fertilizers. 
 
This is pretty sophisticated stuff.  Most companies doing nano-production measure their output in
something ranging from thimbles to maybe one or two tonnes.  A123 has - as I have blogged about
earlier - had enormous expenses in scaling their manufacturing.  
 
But China Agritech is special.  It does nano-prodution using sophisticated things I do not understand
(like nano-honeycomb embedding technology and microelement deep complexing) on the scale of
hundreds of thousands of tonnes per annum.  And it does it with minimal staff and just over $6 million
in plant and equipment. 
 
Whilst I do not understand how they do it fortunately we have a highly qualified guide.  His name is
Wayne Tsou - and he is the managing director of Carlyle Asia Growth Partners.  He is of course
entirely suited to the job.  He not only has a Juris Doctor from the Harvard Law School - he is a
scientist!   He has a Master of Science from CalTech and a Bachelor from University of Michigan.
 Sure he is an electrical engineer by training - but so is my business partner and I don’t hold that
against him... 
 
Anyway Wayne Tsou has (at least before the controversy) vouched in the press for China Agritech
and their technology.  To quote: "we [Carlyle] are encouraged by the Company's current operations
and future outlook. Carlyle always has been active in investing globally in technologies and
companies focused on sustainable development. We intend to continue to provide resources and
assistance to help China Agritech achieve its strategic goals and expand in the Chinese agricultural
market." 
 
Fine words - and as Carlyle is a fine firm I presume those words are backed by actions and that
Carlyle really is in there helping China Agritech with its technology.  And that Wayne Tsou can explain
what is meant by nano-honeycomb embedding technology and microelement deep complexing.  
 
I only wish he would.  
 
You see I have approached Mr Wayne Tsou to answer questions about Carlyle’s involvement in China
Agritech and what contributions Carlyle made to their technology.  Like the other Carlyle participants
in this well promoted stock Mr Tsou has been strangely silent. 
 
Nonetheless Carlyle is a reputable firm - and if they say they are dealing with someone who can
manufacture nano-products on a vast scale without much in the way of staff or capital equipment it is
not for me to disbelieve them.  If they think investing in nano-honeycomb embedding technology and
microelement deep complexing makes sense - then I presume they did some due diligence. 
 
But I am an ornery mongrel.  I remain short.

stop sniping at these China stocks using your blog already. 
 
if you want to do a Kerrisdale on these China stocks, then do it the Kerrisdale way--put
out a proper research report. 
 
stop pussyfooting and get serious already.

The mere presence of superstar talent like Gene Michael Bennett on the Board of
Directors must certainly put Wayne and Anne's minds at ease. 
 
It sure makes me feel better.

Hey now -- no picking on any Harvard Law School grad who is not named Jim Cramer.

Why are you picking on GMB. He is a great indicator of direction and I have made plenty
of money off of his "talents".

How on earth are the US regulators allowing this fraud to continue trading on the
NASDAQ? From $13 to less than $8 in 6 weeks. Are any regulators in the US awake?

Thank you for putting up these blogs. The price reaction gave me nice entry points to this
stock. I think CAGC stock is moving higher soon after the audited earnings will be
posted...

Some of my best friends went to Harvard law school. 
 
I am of course shockingly underqualified. I went to Adelaide and the Ozzie Nashnal
