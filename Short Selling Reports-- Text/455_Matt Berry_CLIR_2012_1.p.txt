Clearsign: The Reinvention Of Fire Or...?
Sep. 25, 2012 7:54 AM ET17 comments
by: Matt Berry


Clearsign Combustion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLIR) claims a new technology, ECC, which
stands for "Electrodynamic Combustion Control." It refers to effects that electric fields can
have on flames.


"We are developing a revolutionary new technology that promises to improve key
performance characteristics of industrial combustion systems including energy
efficiency, emissions control, fuel flexibility and overall cost effectiveness. ECC™
can be used anywhere there is a flame, regardless of fuel type, in the world's
commercial, industrial and utility combustion systems." ~ Clearsign homepage


The following passage appears to be an admission of a weak point for Clearsign, but after
studying the history behind the technology, the statement itself appears to be inaccurate,
while at the same time ironically revealing an even greater weakness:


"Our technology has not been tested or verified by any independent third party."
(Prospectus)


As far as the four stated effects of ECC technology is concerned, I disagree. The
technology of applying electric fields to flames is not new. In fact experiments were first
performed about 200 years ago. See the document dated 1814: "The Bakerian Lecture:
One some new electro-Chemical Phenomena." However, in Clearsign's Whitepaper and in
the video narrated by CEO Richard Rutkowski, ECC is supposed to be a revolutionary
new step in combustion science. Are we really supposed to believe that there was no
history behind the science? In the next passage, "buoyancy" refers to "the natural
tendency of a flame to float upward" (E.G., a candle) and "momentum" refers to a flame
jetting from pressurized gas (E.G., a propane torch).


"Until now, combustion engineers have had only buoyancy and momentum forces in
their tool kit for shaping wayward flames. ECC technology provides a third force of at
least an order of magnitude greater than either buoyancy or momentum to shape
flames." ~ Clearsign Whitepaper, Clearsign Video


And in an SEC "risk" disclosure,

"Although at this time we do not believe that any of our potential competitors has
technology similar to ours, …" ~ Prospectus


It's true that electric fields influence flames, and it's true that ECC technology uses electric
fields, but it is not true that this third influence on flames is either new or unique to ECC
technology.


So, the basic fact that electric fields affect flames is nothing new.


Clearsign's Whitepaper mentions 4 effects, which we itemize in the table below, left
column. In the right column, we find what the rest of the world already knew and when
they knew it. (Some of Clearsign's presentation reads like a textbook of established
science.)

2012 First: "CO is reduced, owing to the


increased homogenization of the flame and


increased mixing with the air stream as well as


the increased mobility and collisions of HCO+


with oxidants and neutral free radical species


such as OH, known to catalyze CO oxidation.


For example, CO oxidation occurs primarily by


CO + OH = CO2 + H (6)"


1997 "A systematic experimental study of


electric field effects on flame stability was carried


out by Calcote and Berman, which revealed


enhanced stability of both laminar and turbulent


flame types. Sepp and Ulybyshev reported that


the emission of carbon monoxide (CO) by a


methane diffusion flame was decreased by more


than one order of magnitude by applying a


voltage of 1 kV." ~ Sepp's and Ulybyshev's work


was published in 1997. Electric Field Effects on

(Further research)


2012 Second: "Particulate is dramatically


reduced."


[figure 2] "Particulate reduction via ECC


technology. Biomass is suspended in a small


crucible held over a propane diffusion flame (not


visible), generating copious quantities of soot


(NYSE:A). The electric field is switched on and


the particulate is eliminated immediately …"

improve the character of the combustion,


whereby more complete combustion takes place


and carbon, soot and other objectionable


products of combustion are eliminated …" ~ W.

2012 Third: "Heat transfer is enhanced. Since


the thermal flow can be directed toward (or away


from) various surfaces, one may use ECC


technology to enhance heat transfer to boiler or


process tubes or insulate surfaces such as gas


turbine blades and critical engine parts from hot


flue gases.


1952 "We have found that we can … (NYSE:F)


materially increase the efficiency of the heat


transfer between a heat source and the point of


application." ~ W. L. Kaehni, et al Patent


2,604,936


2012 Four: "4. Flame shape is dramatically


affected. Tailoring flame shape is critical as


unwieldy flames are a major source of concern


in many units; e.g., process heaters in refining


and petrochemicals and boilers. In one interview,


a heater expert for a major refiner reported that


unruly flames could force as much as a 30%


derate in process output for some heaters; i.e.,


flame shape is critical in most combustion


applications. Until now, combustion engineers


have had only buoyancy and momentum forces


in their tool kit for shaping wayward flames. ECC


technology provides a third force of at least an


order of magnitude greater than either buoyancy


or momentum to shape flames."


1952 "When no current is supplied and no


electrostatic field is present, the flame appears


as shown in solid lines. It is a wavering,


elongated yellow flame from the upper end of


which rises a ribbon of soot or smoke showing


poor combustion. The wall 3 soon reaches a


moderate temperature and remains at that


temperature. When the current is turned on and


the electrostatic field created several phenomena


occur. The flame shortens and bends toward the


wall 3, as indicated roughly in dotted lines. It


becomes more intense and the heat generated is


materially increased. The soot disappears and


the combustion takes place with a clean clear


flame." ~ W. L. Kaehni, et al Patent 2,604,936


Does Clearsign really have a unique technology? It certainly appears that it wants us to
believe that it does. We are reminded that it is actually a discovery company. It has no
marketable products.


"We have no committed sources of financing and we do not expect to earn revenues
in the near term." ~ Prospectus


As it goes with discovery companies, everything hinges on the team … the discoverers.
Who are the scientists? Although Clearsign has no patents, they've listed two applications
for patents in their prospectus. Clearsign can now advertise the fact that they have "patent
pending" technology … but almost anybody with a competent attorney can apply for a
patent. So in our due diligence we need to ask ourselves, is this a business of inventing
patents or of patenting inventions? I ask this because after researching this company I

https://seekingalpha.com/article/886951-clearsign-the-reinvention-of-fire-or 5/26


question the sincerity behind these two patent applications. Of the five "inventors," some
of them have no credible scientific experience with combustion, and others have aligned
themselves with questionable scientific projects in the past.


CEO/Co-Founder Richard Rutkowski and CMO/Co-founder Geoffrey Osler have histories
with business development, finance, and stock promotion. As inventors, where is the
experience and education with combustion science to warrant investor confidence? (In my
opinion, SEC risk disclosures should include patent "inventors" who have personal
interests in using the words, "patent pending," as a promotional tool.)


During Mr. Rutkowski's tenure at Microvision Inc. (NASDAQ:MVIS) there was a man
named, Chris Wiklof, who was referred to as "Director of Product Management." In his
LinkedIn Bio, he refers to his role there as "Director of Patents at Microvision." It appears
that Mr. Wiklof's job during and after Rutkowski's tenure at Microvision is to help build
patent portfolios. Other than his work on Clearsign's patent applications, I have found
nothing in his history which shows a series of experiences leading up to a groundbreaking
advance in the science of combustion. (A list of Wiklof's patents can be found here and
here) He appears to be fulfilling his role as patent agent ‒ and in smoothing out the rough
edges, he has made some contributions. Aiding an idea's patentability permits, if not
obligates him, to list himself as one of the inventors. (There is an interesting debate about
this last point, here. It's not that clear-cut.)

Clearsign Combustion will succeed or fail based upon its scientific validity, and thus there
is an inverse benefit-ratio when it comes to business promotion and bad science: the
greater the ability of the CEO to raise money and promote the stock, the greater the extent
of damage to investors if the science behind the patent is shoddy or commercially
infeasible. On the other hand, if the managers of a company are incompetent and the
science unrealistic, then it will come down all the sooner anyway. So, we will focus on the
scientists here, the ones who introduced Clearsign technology through the currently
pending patent applications, the ideas of which were first filed in April 2009.


Thomas S. Hartwick, besides being listed as an inventor on the patent application, is also
listed at the top of the "Technical Advisors" found in the Prospectus. Recently, he got
tangled up in a bio-fuel scandal.


There was a Mr. John Rivera who was deeply involved with two companies ‒ U.S.
Sustainable Energy Corp (USSE) and Sustainable Power Corp. (OTC:SSTP). Also
involved was a "technology" sometimes called the "Rivera Process" or the "SSTP
process" and which claimed a bio-fuel called "Vertroleum." (Source Documents.)


According to court documents, in a Summary Judgment on July 2011, (Case 5:08-cv-
00245-DCB-JMR)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/886951-clearsign-the-reinvention-of-fire-or 7/26


"The central fraud alleged involves claims by Rivera that USSE could produce viable
commercial biofuel and fertilizer products." (Page 2.) (USSE = US Sustainable
Energy Corp.)


"Rivera was also the principal shareholder of SSTP. According to the Commission,
Rivera used SSTP for misconduct similar to that alleged in this case." (Page 3, Note
2)(SSTP = Sustainable Power Corp)


"The defendants also argue that two purported contracts filed with their response
demonstrate that USSE (or, later, SSTP) was commercially viable." (Page 20)


As you can see from the court documents, the case was so strong that it did not need to
go to trial: John Rivera received a summary judgment from a federal judge. (The story
gets a little weird at this point: Mr. Rivera was said to have died just before sentencing and
his credibility was so low that many thought he might have faked his own death, but that
was apparently not the case).


In the middle of the SEC suit, Dr. Hartwick, with his credentials, is presented to investors
by SSTP. Hartwick's job appears to have been twofold, first, to communicate the science
to the average investor:


"'As we received consistent, encouraging information from the university that
conducted testing at our Baytown facility, we felt it wise to retain someone of Dr.
Hartwick's stature and reputation to help disseminate in layman's terms how
effective and efficient the SSTP process is,' stated Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer, M. Richard Cutler." ~ Sustainable Power Corp. Appoints Dr.
Thomas S. Hartwick as Scientific and Technical Advisor to the Company


And second, to validate the "SSTP Process," which had been subject to doubt, given
recent scrutiny,


"'When I was approached to review the SSTP process and the utilization of the
proprietary catalyst, I spent nearly five weeks reviewing the technical data before I
agreed to accept the position as scientific and technical advisor. Only after I became
convinced that the technology was based on sound scientific principles would I
accept this position,' stated Dr. Thomas Hartwick." ~ Sustainable Power Corp.
Appoints Dr. Thomas S. Hartwick as Scientific and Technical Advisor to the
Company

As far as I know, Dr. Hartwick enters the scene after the SEC began its case against John
Rivera and continues to work with it while the case is ongoing. It is difficult to imagine Dr.
Hartwick not realizing what was happening around him. Nonetheless, his role, whether
active or passive, lent credibility to the ongoing business of SSTP.


Again, according to Businessweek's bio of Dr. Hartwick:


"Dr. Hartwick's function is to provide advice and counsel on the commercialization of
SSTP's Green Energy Vertroleum(NYSE:R) process utilizing Sustainable Power
Corp.'s proprietary catalyst to ... produce biofuels, biogases, and biochar."


In general, lacking a real technology, a fraud needs to associate itself with credible
institutions and people. Here we see something like that, twofold: a strong association had
been made between Texas A&M and the SSTP process, facilitated by the association with
Dr. Hartwick and his prestigious credentials.


"Sustainable Power will shortly announce the results from the Texas A&M's report on
the Company's process for converting biomass to liquid fuel, flammable gas, and
biochar after a review of the report is completed by Sustainable Power's Technical
Advisory Board headed by Dr. Thomas Hartwick." ~ Sustainable Power Corp.
Reports That Texas A&M University Completed an Analysis of Its Green Energy
Technology (See also SSTP's Summary of a Comprehensive Report by Texas A&M
University.)


In the end, John Rivera lost the case in a Summary Judgment. Investors lost money. I
don't know how Dr. Hartwick faired. SSTP now trades at less than a penny. Now we find
Dr. Hartwick with Clearsign Combustion, as the first-named inventor on one patent
application, second-named on another, and here he is again as Technical Advisor. He has
moved from the science of biofuel to that of combustion. In my opinion, either this
constitutes a very big intellectual leap among very different scientific disciplines or there is
not really as much science here as there is a story of science.


Now Clearsign has brought on "Technical Advisors," many from the University of
Washington. According to the prospectus, they can be paid in cash or shares and they
typically enter non-disclosure agreements. They joined after the provisional patent
application was already filed. Presumably the research, testing, and preparation for the
patent application had taken place even earlier.

In short, it is clear that the technology behind the patent applications was developed
before the new University of Washington advisors came on board. I find no other credible
scientists preceding the articulation of Clearsign technology as found in the original April
2009 patent application. We have the three 2008 founders of the company, Goodson,
Rutkowski, and Osler. And Hartwick and Wiklof received restricted shares also in 2008.
Mr. Rutkowski and Mr. Osler are businessmen. Why are they listed as inventors? Mr.
Wiklof is the patent agent. Mr. Hartwick's recent work with SSTP we have seen. These are
four of the men behind the 2009 patent application, an expression of Clearsign
technology.


That leaves us with Mr. David Goodson ‒ Clearsign's Chief Science Officer, co-founder,
Director and largest shareholder. In the prospectus, the first thing that struck me was that
as Chief Science Officer he was nonetheless referred to as Mr. Goodson and not Dr.
Goodson. That might or might not be a serious matter, but the second conspicuous point
in his bio revealed a crack which provoked a lot more study and which eventually revealed
severe fractures:


"Mr. Goodson's scientific interests began in high school when he collaborated with
James Watson and Francis Crick, co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, to place at
the top of the International Science Fair." ~ SEC filed Prospectus (The claim is
repeated on Clearsign's website.)


First, the prospectus tells us that Mr. Goodson was 69 in April 2012, so that means that
when Goodson was a senior in high school (about 17) that Crick and Watson had not yet
won their 1962 Nobel Prize and were still obscure. If they had met after Crick and Watson
became famous then Goodson would have been around 19 or older in high school,
suggesting that he had been held back one or more years during his early years.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/886951-clearsign-the-reinvention-of-fire-or 10/26


Also, Mr. Watson is 84 (born April 1928), and Crick, if he were living, would be 96 (born
June 1916). So, when Watson was 17, Goodson was about 2. When Crick was 17,
Watson was only 5 … and Goodson was not even born yet. So a "collaboration" among
high school peers cannot be what Goodson's biography means.


And there are geographical problems. Crick was British. Watson is American.


Goodson's years in high school, age 14 through 18, would be about 1957 through
1961.
"On 8 September 1954, Crick sailed from New York. .... Crick had a job in Cambridge
again, though it was only a seven-year contract from the Medical Research Council."
(Francis Crick: Discoverer of the Genetic Code, By Matt Ridley; Page 85,86)
Watson: "Since the fall of 1956, he has been a member of the Harvard Biology
Department, first as Assistant Professor, then in 1958 as an Associate Professor, and
as Professor since 1961." ~ Nobelprize.org


Perhaps they were all pen pals? ‒ in which case being one of the few to recognize the
genius of Crick and Watson, before the rest of the world did, Mr. Goodson most certainly
would have known the value of the correspondence and undoubtedly would have
preserved it. Perhaps it will be auctioned off in Sotheby's someday?


Should I say that such a "collaboration" has only the slightest possibility of being true or
should I say that it is highly unlikely?


Here is another instance where Mr. Goodson's credentials appear to be inflated. In the
very same passage, the prospectus states:


"Mr. Goodson's numerous US patents include US 4,110,086, US 4,675,029, US
9/760,214 and US 5,702,244." ~ Prospectus


The suggestion here is that Mr. Goodson has "numerous patents," of which a mere four
are mentioned. In reality, I have found only three patents where Mr. Goodson is listed as
an inventor, the first and fourth patents in the list above, and then another patent
4,093,430, which is the Apparatus corresponding to the above listed Method, 4,110,086.
(They are essentially the same technology.)

As for the other patents listed above, there is indeed a patent numbered 4,675,029 but the
inventors here are Dan A. Norman and Stanley J. Frazier. Mr. Goodson is not listed.


I spent some time on the phone with the US Patent Office to confirm the above and the
following. His other claimed patent, "9/760,214," refers to an application, not an issued
patent, and that application shows the status: "Abandoned ‒ Failure to Respond to an

This is the Chief Science Officer of a discovery company. He is also the first and second-
named inventor on the two patent applications mentioned in Clearsign's prospectus.


OK, the patent which was said to belong to Mr. Goodson was really an abandoned
application for a patent. Mr. Goodson later re-applied for this patent ‒ with Mycoferm
Technologies Inc as the assignee ‒ a company he founded. It suffered the same fate and
was also "Abandoned" due to "Failure to Respond to an Office Action." However, there is
something interesting about the abandoned application. Its basic idea was to apply
electricity to biomass and accelerate the fermentation process.


"Apparatus and method for enhanced biomass production by electrical waveform
shaping are disclosed. The invention relates to cultivating a biological source cell in
a liquid-medium bioreactor and applying a waveform regulated electric field potential
to the source cell, wherein the liquid medium comprises one or more ionizable
components." Goodson's patent application


Compare this to Clearsign's idea,


"Our Electrodynamic Combustion Control technology introduces a computer-
controlled electric field into the combustion zone to improve control of flame shape
and heat transfer." ~ Clearsign Combustion website


Perhaps Mr. Goodson really has mastered two completely different scientific disciplines
and it is just a coincidence that both utilize electric fields. Or, is this more like Saturday
afternoon sci-fi where, from Frankenstein to the Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes, we
can apply electricity and expect an amazing transformation? Now we have Clearsign
taking the age-old human fascination with fire and applying our new fascination with
electricity, and reinventing how fire is going to burn in the future.


Is there a pattern here? We have moved from applying electric fields to biomass to
applying electric fields to fire, and with both efforts, "Patent pending," seems to be enough
to ask investors to put up money. This was also the case with the John Rivera scam
mentioned earlier:

"Rivera also submits a purported patent application and related correspondence to
attempt to show USSE's commercial value," the judge wrote. "It is undisputed that
Rivera filed patent applications which were never completed, and which lacked
sufficient details to allow the patent applications to be evaluated." ~ Federal judge:
biofuels deal was a scam


Mr. Goodson's company, MycoFerm Technologies, appears to have been dissolved in
2003. Although its patent application was also abandoned, perhaps it still served its
purpose? Here is a page advertising Mycoferm's "patent pending" technology and pitching
for investor funds : "MycoFerm Technologies, Inc., Develops New Fermentation
Technology."


"MycoFerm Technologies, located in Bellevue, WA, has developed a new patent-
pending technology-Enhanced Growth Technology (NYSEMKT:EGT)-that has the
potential to revolutionize the fermentation industry. "


"MycoFerm has developed a completely new fermentation process that can be
installed in existing facilities or incorporated in new construction."


"The company's revenue model is based on licensing EGT to customers. License
fees will be based on a combined percentage of energy savings and increased
biomass yields."


"The company, located in a cell-growth research facility vacated by a major
pharmaceutical company, is seeking $1.5 million dollars to fund the further
development of its technology in order to provide industrial scaleup-expected to take
from 4-6 months-and for additional corporate and market development, and will fund
the Company to revenue generation, approximately 12-14 months." ~ ("MycoFerm
Technologies, Inc., Develops New Fermentation Technology," HTML and Google s
PDF Quick View) (For another article, see Feeding the yeast to make medicines)


Clearsign's Chief Science Officer has been involved with other companies as well. Here,
Mr. Goodson's bio is inflated by the suggestion that a dissolved company is being actively
managed:


"Mr. Goodson is also Executive Director of the Alternative Energy Resources
Alliance (AERA), a Washington State non-profit foundation dedicated to the
development of new forms of electromechanical conversion technology."
(Prospectus, 2012)

AERA had been dissolved "due to the failure of the corporation to file an annual list of
officers" ‒ and it was dissolved a year before the prospectus was filed. (AERA corporate
registration and website, letter received from Washington State Government.)


Nonetheless, it's the science behind Mr. Goodson's AERA that also concerns us. It might
provide some insight into Mr. Goodson, the Chief Science Officer, who is going to help
investors commercialize a "new" technology. On the homepage:


"AERA has a global sense of implementation, and believes in studying immediate
and readily available solutions for the planet's problems." ~ Alternative Energy
Resource Alliance (Note the phone number. It will come up again ... and again later.)


"Immediate and readily available solutions"…?


"AERA's latest project, the Horizon project, uses the potential of the Earth's rotation
to directly produce electrical energy. This is attained by treating the Earth as a giant
battery, where each side of the horizon is treated as the positive and negative end of
the battery. When the horizon passes through a location on the Earth that is about
120 miles across (where the dark side meets the light side) the potential difference
between these two points becomes the source of the earth's battery. Energy created
in this zone can be stored in giant capacitors that capture the free charge in the
earth's surface, thus enabling the distribution of energy to electrical transmission
sites stationed in the proximity of the horizon storage devices. These storage
devices can be positioned around the world. … The most important aspect of this
project is that it will provide readily available energy in order to replace coal burning,
hydroelectric power, nuclear energy, and the use of other fossil fuels." ~ The Horizon
Project


AERA is listed in the prospectus as one of Mr. Goodson's credentials and as if Mr.
Goodson is actively managing it, although it was dissolved. Other active companies
however are not mentioned. Why not?


Here we have "The Remediators," whose CEO, Howard Sprouse, is the trustee for
Goodson's shares in Clearsign. It was formed shortly after Mycoferm was dissolved.

Goodson is modestly listed on The Remediators' website as a business advisor; however
he is actually listed as Chairman of the company with the Secretary of State of
Washington. If you're interested in some of the ideas behind the science, see the
presentation by CEO Howard Sprouse on Youtube.


Here's another Goodson-related company, more recent. If you copied down the phone
number for AERA earlier, you might want to compare it with the phone number listed at
"Human Energetic Systems Corp." In his other bio at Businessweek.com, Mr. David
Goodson is listed as the Chief Technology Officer. Besides the identical name and phone
number, the company is also in the same vicinity as other Goodson businesses. As for the
science, we'll need to forget the electro-fermentation, remediation by fungi, extracting
power from the Earth-battery, and Clearsign's ECC technology. We're looking at,


"… developing a medical diagnostic device that measures the body's internal
electromagnetic field to discover knowledge of disease conditions …" ~ Web Page


Just this last June, Goodson also started up a business called "Transvolt International
Energy Corporation." This company has the same address registered with the Secretary
of State of Washington State as AERA, and of course AERA's link to Goodson is filed with
Clearsign's SEC documents, so everything links up. What is this company about? It's
impossible to say for sure, but there are some clues. Here is a passage from AERA:


"The primary key to the AERA approach is the electrical engine. This device was
actually developed in the early 1920's by early innovators at MIT. J. G. Trump and
Van de Graaff were the primary developers of the motor which at that time could
generate 20,000 watts of electrical power when in its braking mode." ~ Advanced
Car and Train System

Knowing the phone number for both AERA and Human Energetics, I tried it in a Google
search and found the following post:


"Back in the 60's, or approximate timeframe, ions were injected into a non-
conducting liquid for purposes of creating a Van de Graaff generator type device."


….


"Does anyone know where one might obtain the source of materials that describe
this device. At one time I thought I had a copy of this, however, that has been far too
long for me to know where it might now be and where in the hundreds of boxes I
might locate it."


"I'm also interested in finding drawings or plans for the construction of a Trump
Electrostatic motor. The patents on the device do not clearly indicate the actual
layout of the switching of components. The Trump motor was developed along with
Van de Graaff at MIT back sometime in the 1930's and it utilized an extremely high
voltage (1,000,000) electrostatic field to make the motor work. It demonstrated an
extremely high efficiency in conversion of the electrostatic charges inside the motor
on discs containing pie shaped sections. My plan is to merge the fluidic charge
carrying aspect of the higher current density for use and conversion for the Trump
motor." ~ General Mills Fluidic Electrostatic General

By this time it is difficult to be surprised by anything regarding Mr. Goodson. We note first
that the phone number is the same as AERA's and Human Energetics. The very specific
reference to both Van de Graaff and Trump matches up with the text on AERA -- and of
course the poster identifies himself as "David Goodson."


The post was dated May 27, 2012, about one month after Clearsign's IPO and two weeks
before Goodson filed for the formation of Transvolt International Energy.


It is an interesting request for information ‒ especially the drawings and plans ‒ on a very
basic level. It almost sounds like a hobby or someone preparing for a presentation. I would
not have given this post so much thought and room for doubt had I not already researched
AERA and his other questionable claims and enterprises.


"Does anyone know where one might obtain the source of materials that describe
this device."


As I write this, Clearsign Combustion is trading at around $7 a share and has a market
cap of around $65 million ‒ without anyone bothering to have a third-party test the
scientific claims.


One can't prosecute insincere science. One can however take part in the debate and thus
aid the greater exposure of relevant facts.


As investors, we might ask, Are Clearsign's patent applications here to protect investor-
owned technology and the commercialized products that follow? Or, do they exist to
create a story, elevate investor expectations, and sell shares to benefit insiders? Why has
the company gone directly to investors without first testing the technology through third-
parties?


Disclosure: I am short CLIR. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

It is amazing that they let anyone publish on Seeking Alpha. This person put a lot of work in to make a point that is
irrelevant.


Technology is completely unique from what was developed before and is evidenced by its performance that was not
possible before with previous technology.


IP strategy to protect those innovations that make this technology unique is in place to protect it even though this
author wouldn't have access to it because it is not published.


I hope he gets short more...when validation does appear in the form of partnerships to commercialize the technology,
all his arguments will seem silly.

Author’s reply »  You may or may not be the Christopher A. Marlett who was listed as a beneficial owner of
910,052 shares of CLIR (17.3%) and co-founder of MDB Capital. There are so many impostors on the Net; a
full disclosure would be nice.


MDB Capital http://bit.ly/QiAN0f 
Prospectus http://1.usa.gov/QSjMHB


CLIR prospectus: “… our initial public offering underwritten by MDB Capital Group LLC, of $12 million of
shares of common stock ….”


CLIR prospectus: “…. the payment of a $1,000,000 consulting fee in the form of common stock issued at
$2.20 per share to MDB Capital Group LLC for services including assistance with building an intellectual
property development strategy, retaining appropriate executive personnel, and advising with respect to the
development of our business.”


Really? “… assistance with building an intellectual property development strategy” … Is this real?


If you are the same Chris Marlett, may I ask if you also helped out with the technology? Afterall didn’t the
CEO and CMO contribute enough to get listed as inventors on the currently pending patent application? Did
CLIR’s Chief Science Officer really collaborate with Nobel Prize winners? CLIR claims a patent for him upon
which he is not listed as an inventor. Another patent said to belong to him was actually an abandoned
application. Here are some other ideas from a company he founded: http://bit.ly/QiANgs.


Who uses Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc to plug for CLIR? And why? http://bit.ly/QSjMHD 
http://bit.ly/Q6BJkw


Does CLIR really try to suggest that until now the known influences on flames have been only buoyancy and
momentum? …. Is it really as if the effect of electric fields on flames was not known and was something
entirely new?


CLIR is a discovery company. It has no patents, no marketable products. 
"Our technology has not been tested or verified by any independent third party."


Why not?

CLIR: "We have no committed sources of financing and we do not expect to earn revenues in the near term."


Back to your points: 
Investors couldn’t say “is evidenced by its performance that was not possible before with previous
technology”” if, as you say, the technology is “not published.”


Not being published, there is no "evidence" for us to work with. So if, as you say, there is no public access to
the information how would we be able to say that the “Technology is completely unique from what was
developed before” ??


Trust in what you or CLIR says? Not having such evidence, we have to look to the quality of the story tellers,
especially the “science team.”


The technology behind the current pending applications was introduced to the US Patent office in April 2009.
Besides Goodson, the other inventors on this currently pending patent, and who were on CLIR’s science team
at that point were:


Hartwick: Tech Advisor for CLIR was also Tech Advisor for SSTP. SSTP was involved with USSE and John
Rivera. Research “SSTP Vertroleum Fraud”: http://goo.gl/PemqJ


Rutkowski and Osler are businessmen. What are they doing on the patent as “inventors”?


Wiklof is the patent agent.


Where are the credible scientists behind CLIR’s expression of its technology: the patent application filed in
April 2009 and currently pending?

Yes, the same Chris Marlett. I'm obviously very conflicted because I believe in the company and have money invested
in it. Just like I was conflicted in the last two public companies I launched into the public markets. VirnetX (VHC-
AMEX) which we took public at a tiny valuation in the face of articles like yours and it now trades at over a $1B market
cap and Medivation (MDVN-NASDAQ) which we took public early and it now trades at a $4B market cap. So if you
want to learn more how we have had success, I'd be happy to discuss with you and the particulars of ClearSign. I'm
quite sure the company would also be willing to help you understand why doing a surface analysis like you did doesn't
quite do you or your readers justice. Or you can just take shots from your armchair and stay short...you pick.

CLIR claim that he was inventor on all of the patents mentioned in his SEC bio? Where are CLIR disclosures
of Dr. Hartwick’s involvement with SSTP? Why are the CEO and CMO listed on the pending patent as
Inventors? What backgrounds do they have in combustion science?


You are correct about “surface analysis” ‒ For example, if there is really nothing behind a technology, then
after thorough research one will have to present that in fact there is nothing but surface.


If you or your Chief Science Officer have greater depth to provide, please do so. If you can tell investors what
technological advance CLIR has that has not already been proven effective (or ineffective) by established
science, then present it.

Hey Mr. Berry, 
How's that shorting of QIHU going? Ouch! 
I am agreeing with Mr. Marlett here. He seems to have a bit more success than you do, and in fact has a large
business that you mention, MDB Capital, that has way more cred than you will ever have.


I have one question for you: 
This company's tech is called "ECC" - correct? 
I am assuming that the "C"ontrol of their technology is being done via a modern day technology called a computer. I
am very sure that all the references you brought up occurred before the invention of the modern day microchip. I am
very sure a computer and software is around their lab, and being used. 
As an example - I do know about internal combustion engines, which have been around for quite a long time too. Do
we accept the technology of these engines as well known. Sure, but that doesn't stop people from using modern
technology to improve them. Google "direct injection" if you like. 
My hope is that inventors keep revisiting the past, and using new technology to make the future better. 
Happy shorting

Question: Does 440/month even come close to 400/quarter? A third grader could figure this out. Where do
you stand on this?


There was ZERO explanation for the downshift in numbers. If Kai-Fu Lee “proved” Qihoo’s monthly 400
ARPU, then he refuted Qihoo’s new numbers. If Kai-Fu LEE “proved” quarterly 400 ARPU, then he proved
Qihoo’s Q1 ARPU claims were indeed unrealistic. In short, Qihoo had already tried to GO BACK to realistic
numbers. But it really doesn’t matter. Kai Fu can say one thing, Qihoo another, and people will only believe
the most recent STATED conclusions, regardless of how obvious the contradictions are.

not met my standard. I reported the facts in the above report; they are solid and have serious implications. I
myself have nothing to do with the existence of those facts.


ECC: The addition of a computer does not account for the four key effects mentioned in the Whitepaper. The
effects are due to the electric field itself and have been known for a long time. The expression of CLIRs
technology by way of the current pending application actually took place in April 2009. The inventors were
Goodson, Hartwick, Rutkowski, Osler, and Wiklof. Reread the piece and tell me, who put together this
currently pending expression of CLIR’s technology? Are they qualified? Was this a sincere attempt to patent a
revolutionary technology or is this an "IP strategy" to help sell shares to late-coming investors?

Interesting article, off base, lots of details, heck of a lot of homework, but what can one expect from a professional
Shorty, but more on that later.


Firstly, I want to state that I am long on CLIR and here is why. In my past life, I was a Mechanical Engineer with
specialized experience in Combustion and Combustion Process Control. I spent almost 30 years in the business
before I retired and bought a horse and cattle ranch. I did real well in the past and was able to build myself a nice, tidy
portfolio. I manage my portfolio and have done fairly well with it since I retired to the Ranch. One lesson I learned
early on, you can’t do enough home work when you are investing in stocks. I spend many hours with my laptop doing
research on current and potential investments.


I found CLIR doing such research. I did my DD before I bought in. Yes, CLIR is a developmental company. They do
not have a product to take to market, as of yet. Their proof of concept so far is a paltry 400 Mbh. They are moving
next to 1,000 Mbh which is the next logical step in the process. In addition, CLIR is also exploring the myriad of
potential applications for the technology. They are protecting the Intellectual Property as they go. Not the fastest
process, but it is the most logical.


I was very fascinated by the list of old patents you dug up. Yep, electrical conductivity of the flame has been known for
many years. Flame conductivity has been the basis for basic flame/burner management systems since the late 40’s.
You don’t think the big boys of the Combustion Industry, like Siemens, Honeywell and United Technologies have not
researched these patents in the past. Of course they have. If what CLIR has developed is old Tech, why is it not
already utilized? It’s not.


You dug up some interesting info on some of the players, but you missed the person doing the actual development
completely. I have met the chief engineer doing the development work and he is the real deal. You see, the

combustion business is actually a very small world. There are only a few that have the experience to develop new
combustion tech. It only takes 10 or 15 minutes to figure out who is a charlatan and who is not when you have spent
years building and tuning industrial burners. Further, a good engineer can spot another good engineer in a heartbeat.
He was one of the main reasons I bought in.


I have also met the inventor. And like most true inventors I have met, he tends to be on the edge. One kind of needs
to be out on the fringe to continuously think outside the box. I would also guess for every good idea, there are a
number of bad ones. Tesla was considered a kook. Steve Jobs was also thought of as a kook. The list goes on. These
guys tend to live in their own little universe. It tends to go with the territory. After I met him, I did my own home work
on the man. Found the same postings and different business interests, oh well. He has a couple of other interesting
ideas as well. I really do not care about past ideas. I care about this idea and I believe it is a good one.


As for the minor details about who’s name is on what and if they are business types or whatever seems like minutia.
You really did not or could not discuss the Technology. I would guess you do not understand it. You don’t have a clue
as to why it works or why it won’t. So you went after whatever you could dig up to try and stir the pot. What is your
motivation to spend so much time researching this company? Are you doing the investing community a service? I do
not think so. It looks to me to be strictly self-serving. You found a company with low volume and a fairly steady share
price. So you figure, you can torch them with an article, scare off a few investors and hopefully drive the price down.
Short them and make some fast cash. A Professional Shorty Move, smacks of attempted manipulation to me. Does
not the SEC have issues with this kind of thing? I read the other articles you have authored, all slam jobs. You short
them too? How about your announcement on your blog that you are shorting CLIR? You run this through your short
simulator? The problem with you shorty’s is that you all think small. Folks like Chris see the big picture. Too bad you
can’t figure it out.

If you sincerely believe the above, I suggest that you contact the SEC. I use my real name. I do not use a
nick. As for how I feel about this, I would love for the report I have already submitted to the SEC to get extra
attention.


You can’t have a competent scientific procedure without scientists. And you can’t leapfrog the scientists and
land on a comprehended technology ‒ on the contrary, you will only land on a story of technology. You just
told a nice story.


“If what CLIR has developed is old Tech, why is it not already utilized? It’s not. “


You’ve stood the issue on its head. The fact that it is old and is not being utilized probably means that it has
not been found to be useful.


If we want to identify the discovery company most likely to find a new technology, then we need to find a
seriously good team of scientists. Should we pretend that CLIR can have a credible scientific presentation

without having credible scientists? Where are the scientists who put together CLIR’s technology?


CLIR has patents pending. These are formal expressions of its technology. That expression was used to help
the company go public and continues to help promote the stock price. However, today’s expression was
actually put together in April 2009. Was it sincere? The “inventors” were ….


Chief Science Officer and CLIR inventor, largest shareholder and director, Goodson ‒ CLIR’s SEC filed
documents claim he collaborated with Nobel Prize winners when in high school. That story is highly
improbable. CLIR claims two patents for him ‒ on one he is not listed as the inventor; the other is an
abandoned application -- not a patent. He also started up a company and solicited for investors based upon a
“patent pending” idea which would apply electric fields to the fermentation process. This sounds too familiar.
This patent application was also abandoned. (See above) Credibility is at stake here: this is the Chief Science
Officer. (And what degree does he have? I can’t find it. A disclosure from the company would be nice.) Why
isn’t there a disclosure in SEC documents declaring his relationships with these other companies? To say that
his other science projects are “outside the box” is a nice spin: http://bit.ly/QiANgs.

Rutkowski and Osler are businessmen, not combustion scientists.


Wiklof is a patent agent.


Where are the scientists responsible for the original formulation and expression of CLIR’s technology?

Matt: 
You just seem to be hung up on this Science thing, but again you don’t seem to know the difference between
Scientific Inquiry and Engineering Design Development. The following explains the difference.


From Wikipedia:


The scientific method (or simply scientific method) is a body of techniques for investigating phenomena, acquiring
new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must
be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning. The Oxford English
Dictionary says that scientific method is: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th
century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and
modification of hypotheses."


The chief characteristic which distinguishes a scientific method of inquiry from other methods of acquiring knowledge
is that scientists seek to let reality speak for itself, supporting a theory when a theory's predictions are confirmed and
challenging a theory when its predictions prove false. Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another,
identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methods of obtaining knowledge. Scientific researchers
propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena, and design experimental studies to test these hypotheses via
predictions which can be derived from them. These steps must be repeatable, to guard against mistake or confusion
in any particular experimenter. Theories that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many independently

derived hypotheses together in a coherent, supportive structure. Theories, in turn, may help form new hypotheses or
place groups of hypotheses into context.


Scientific inquiry is generally intended to be as objective as possible in order to reduce biased interpretations of
results. Another basic expectation is to document, archive and share all data and methodology so they are available
for careful scrutiny by other scientists, giving them the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them.
This practice, called full disclosure, also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established
(when data is sampled or compared to chance).


The engineering design process is the formulation of a plan to help an engineer build a product with a specified
performance goal. This process involves a number of steps, and parts of the process may need to be repeated many
times before production of a final product can begin.


…component, or process to meet desired needs. It is a decision making process (often iterative) in which the basic
sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated
objective. Among the fundamental elements of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria,
synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation.


The engineering design process is a multi-step process including the research, conceptualization, feasibility
assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool
design, and finally production. The sections to follow are not necessarily steps in the engineering design process, for
some tasks are completed at the same time as other tasks.


You don’t seem to get the concept that CLIR is doing Engineering Development. The science of flame electrification
has existed for many years as you pointed that out very well in your article. What really is apparent is you are arguing
Apples when in reality, CLIR is building Oranges. It really comes down to the old “Build a better mouse trap” thing.
This is how innovation works. A few examples: bulky main frame computers have become tablets and smart phones,
drum brakes have now become disc brakes, ice boxes have become refrigerators and light bulbs have gone from
filaments to led’s. Each of these started with a basic idea or concept, or shall we say theory but the engineers figured
out a better way to make each of these better. I really don’t believe there is a requirement that an innovator has to
have a Phd. to be innovative. Innovation and creativity is not limited to scientists. There is guy that lives North of me in
Seattle, never finished college but started a small software company, I think he has done alright.


Now with every one of these innovations, patents have been issued to protect the innovator. The same thing holds
true with CLIR. They are building a better mouse trap. It might turn out that their innovation may have a dramatic
effect on the combustion industry or maybe not, after all they are a development company. Protecting their interests
with patents only makes sense. Edison’s light bulb and LED’s both make light. They are both based on the use of
electricity to generate photons but are they the same? No they are not. However each is covered by separate patents.


Back to the questions in my first comment. Answer these please. You can’t discuss the technology you apparently
don’t know enough about it to tell us why it won’t work or how it relates to past work in the field. All you can do is
question the names on a patent filing. Question a resume statement or the past history of an individual. Can you tell
me you have never fudged your resume, told a girl a tall tale or exaggerated a size? Please answer my questions. If
you won’t then I will just continue to believe your article is just self-serving dribble intended to promote your stated
short position.

Author’s reply »  Steven:


You’re not really saying that fudging a resume can ever find a place within an acceptable business standard,
right?


And do you really think that Gates and Goodson belong in the same category … as thinkers? … as
businessmen? Do Crick and Watson belong in the same category as Goodson?


Gates’ track record speaks for itself … but so does Goodson’s. Both of these individuals have histories. There
couldn’t be a greater contrast. Gates got where is today by way of his sharp mind and business acumen. (I
am Long MSFT.) As for Goodson’s track record, the Chief Science Officer, please re-read the above.


You’ve told a nice story of science. But the problem is … we can’t get to the science. Show me a credible
scientist capable of articulating ClearSign technology in April 2009. See, the expression of Clearsign
technology takes place in April 2009. That’s when the first provisional patent application was filed. That and
another patent application were used in the 2012 prospectus to help CLIR sell shares to investors. The
applications are still pending. Those applications list the gentlemen detailed in this article. Who put ECC
technology together? Please reread. Where are the scientists?


As MDB Capital put it, 
“In addition, the team retains the original inventor of ECC, Chief Scientist David Goodson, who founded Air
Pollution Systems and holds multiple US Patents.” ~ MDB Capital Group, Sept. 7, 2012, research initiation.


Scientific discussion here is precluded, first, by the absence of a credible scientist and second, by the fact
that the history of the technology in question has been presented to Investors as if it is something new. Much
of what Clearsign suggests as a “new” technology is already 50 years old.


Is CLIR patenting inventions or inventing patents?


If we are after scientific discovery, shouldn't an IP Strategy come from a reputable scientist and not MDB
Capital (with serious fees)?


Why were the CEO and CMO listed as "inventors" on the currently pending applications?

Not sure how, but SA thought my comment was offensive and deleted it.


Essentially, Matt, I wish that I had read your post before investing in CLIR. It just seems too shady to have lied about
patents, current associations, and actual scientific discovery. Hopefully our positions will work for us in the end, and I'll
be happy to wash my hands of this mess.

Matt, do you expect the SEC to get involved with this one; and where do you look to cover ($4, $2, 0)?


After lock-up expired I see no reason why this can't be shorted with reckless abandon.

We'll see what happens.


Cash per share is around a buck right now. At the rate of cash burn, if no other investments take place, we
might be at about 50 cents in a year. Barring new information, I’m looking at those numbers.


I believe the CLIR story is worth zero -- I would never go long this stock, even if it traded below cash – these
guys pay themselves too much and with the words "these guys" I include MDB Capital's IP "consulting fees".
But there’s always room for a new story -- a MOU, a mystery-customer, an amazing breakthrough (like this
one http://sdrv.ms/VNbwMD) … etc. …it's amazing how little it takes to get people to throw their money on a
story .... so who knows how long it will actually take.
