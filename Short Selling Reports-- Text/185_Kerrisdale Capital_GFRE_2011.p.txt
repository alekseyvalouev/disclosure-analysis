Gulf Resources: Financial Claims Are Beyond Reason
May 19, 2011 9:06 AM ET97 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


A report that was published by Glaucus Research Group on April 26th highlighted the
many shortcomings of Gulf Resources (GFRE), a Chinese firm that manufactures
bromine, crude salt and related chemical products. The Glaucus piece builds a convincing
case that Gulf misrepresents itself in its SEC financial filings.


Among other items, Glaucus shows that the company's claimed assets appear to actually
be owned by a private conglomerate owned by GFRE's chairman, and not by Gulf.
Glaucus also argued that local Chinese filings show a much smaller business than is
indicated by SEC filings, that the company's largest customer is an undisclosed related
party, and that Gulf's initial reverse merger partner was China Finance, Inc., which
vanished from the public markets in 2009 with no explanation and was an organizer of
other dubious Chinese reverse merger companies like Orient Paper (NYSEMKT:ONP) and
Universal Travel Agency (UTA).


Given that there was other material to focus on, Glaucus did not devote much time to
address the company's extraordinary business claims.


In this article, we will explain why certain of Gulf's business claims are too good to be true,
with a focus on the most important financial metric of all: profit margins. In particular, we
compare the financial metrics of GFRE to those of three other comparable companies:
Great Lakes Chemical, Israel Chemicals (OTCPK:ISCHY) and Haiwang Resources.


Haiwang is a particularly applicable comparable because the company is a direct
competitor to GFRE. It manufactures a similar portfolio of products in the same region as
Gulf and filed an S-1 (.pdf) with the SEC earlier this year.


Below is a comparison of the two companies' segment breakdowns:

See GFRE's 10K (.pdf) and Haiwang's S-1 (.pdf) for supporting documentation for the
above graphs.


For Great Lakes, we use data from 2004 (available here (.pdf)), the last year prior to its
being acquired by Crompton Corp. Bromine, crude salt and chemical products
manufacturing has stayed sufficiently competitive since 2004, such that Great Lakes'
financial figures from 2004 should be applicable.


Israel Chemicals, whose annual report is available here (.pdf), features a smaller bromine
segment as percentage of sales than our other comparables, but nevertheless provides a
useful data point when examining GFRE's too-good-to-be-true operating metrics.


As a final point, we also discuss how we could not find Gulf's subsidiaries or its products
on three leading Chinese vendor transaction websites, but were able to locate their
competitors. This is highly unusual given that GFRE claims to be "…one of the largest
producers of bromine in China…"


PROFIT MARGINS


In the table below, we compare GFRE's profit margin to that of the three comparable
companies:


GFRE's profit margins in 2010 are not outliers; the company has posted an EBITDA
margin of 40% to 50% since 2007 (see the GFRE 10Ks for 2009 (.pdf) and 2010 (.pdf)).
These margins are extraordinarily high when compared to the comparable companies. We
remind investors that GFRE operates a commodity business, and does not benefit from
unique technology, brand recognition or other competitive advantages. Rather, the
company credits the following as drivers of its business:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270786-gulf-resources-financial-claims-are-beyond-reason 3/28


We compete in our business based on price, our reputation for quality and on-time
delivery, our relationship with suppliers and our geographical proximity to natural
brine deposits in the PRC for bromine, crude salt and chemical production.
Management believes that our stable quality, manufacturing processes and plant
capacity for the production of bromine, crude salt and chemical products are key
considerations in the awarding of contracts in the PRC. (source (.pdf))


It is highly unusual, and in our opinion nearly impossible, for a commodity manufacturer to
consistently produce the types of margins typically only achieved by the likes of Microsoft
(NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other businesses with unique products,
unless the commodity sector is benefiting from abnormal supply-demand imbalances.
Judging from Haiwang's S-1 (.pdf), we can see that bromine manufacturers in Shandong
are not benefiting from any unusual supply-demand dynamics.


According to this S-1, there are approximately 75 licensed bromine producers in Weifang
City, Shandong Province, which produces approximately 85% of all the bromine produced
in China. We spoke with representatives from multiple bromine producers in Shandong
province, including Shandong Longwei Group Company Limited, Shandong Haihua
Group, Sinobrom Albemarle Bromine Chemicals Co. and Haiwang. Based on our
discussions, the production methods and sources of brine for the manufacturers in the
Shandong province are relatively indistinguishable. Given that Haiwang and other
competitors appear to be reporting reasonable margins, it's likely that GFRE's true
margins are materially lower than its reported ones.


Furthermore, there is ample evidence that bromine manufacturing in China is only
marginally profitable. Bromine in Weifang City is produced from brine water which is
concentrated seawater that is found underground, as is explained in Haiwang's S-1. The
bromine concentration of the brine water available in China is similar to that of ocean
water (for instance, see Albemarle's graphical depiction here). As can be seen from the
chart, bromine production from Chinese brine water is less efficient than production from
other brine sources, such as those available in the US or the Dead Sea.


For instance, this Haaretz article writes about how bromine manufacturing in China
"border[s] on economically unfeasible levels because the concentration of bromine fell
from 0.3 grams per liter to 0.2-0.18 grams per liter, compared to 10-12 grams per liter in
the Dead Sea".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270786-gulf-resources-financial-claims-are-beyond-reason 4/28


Extracting bromine from less concentrated brine sources requires different methods of
production that increase production costs (see here). The mothballed factories that GFRE
has acquired to support its alleged increase in production capacity are likely orphaned
facilities that are indistinguishable from the many small producers in the area.


In short, bromine manufacturing for Shandong producers like Gulf is a high-cost
enterprise. In light of this fact, Gulf's high reported margins are difficult to believe.
Furthermore, it is especially difficult to believe that a Chinese producer like Gulf can
achieve dramatically higher margins than producers like Great Lakes or Israel Chemicals,
which benefit from more attractive sources of brine water, modern facilities and economies
of scale.


INVENTORY TURNS


We will also compare Gulf's inventory turns to those of the comparables. Below is a
comparison of the inventory turns of Gulf Resources to comparable companies.


GFRE reported inventory turns of 48x in 2010, compared to a range of 3x to 7x for the
comparable companies. Inventory turns of 48x are unusually high regardless of the
industry. It's particularly suspicious for a chemicals business. GFRE's inventory consists of
raw materials and finished products. Raw materials to produce bromine, crude salt and
brominated specialty chemical products include brine water, chlorine, sulfur, vitriol, ethane
and ethyl ether. Brine water is pumped from underground through extraction wells, passed
through transmission pipelines, moved to a refining plant, and oxidized through the
addition of chlorine.


The resulting bromine is then blown out using compressed air and absorbed by sulfur
dioxide or soda, while the remaining brine water is pumped into brine pans where it is left
to evaporate. Companies like GFRE and Haiwang then sell some of their bromine
supplies and use the remainder to manufacture chemical products. This manufacturing
process is described throughout GFRE's and Haiwang's annual reports, including here
(.pdf).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270786-gulf-resources-financial-claims-are-beyond-reason 5/28


Given this manufacturing process and the finished products of both bromine and chemical
products, we do not believe that the company is able to turn over its inventory every 8
days. In its S1, Haiwang discusses how it stores its inventory to receive additional revenue
from price hikes.


DEFICIENT PRESENCE IN MARKETPLACE


In searching the internet to locate a suitable bromine manufacturer in China, there are
many sites available for buyers. The primary sites are:


www.icis.com - provides chemical and energy market intelligence and a supplier search
function.


www.chemnet.com - Chinese business-to-business website focused on the chemical
industry.


www.alibaba.com - small business e-commerce site representing multiple industries.


The competitors named in the filings of GFRE and Haiwang were easy to find on the sites
mentioned above. The table below lists the firms that GFRE and Haiwang describe as
their competition in their 10K and S1. It also indicates which supplier sites their products
are showcased on.


Finding a supplier site with GFRE's products was more difficult. After conducting a
supplier search, we found no mention of Gulf Resources or its operating subsidiaries
(Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company and Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry
Company) on www.chemnet.com, www.icis.com or www.alibaba.com.

Comments (97)


The twelve companies in the table above are not companies we chose at random; rather,
they are listed as competitors by GFRE and/or Haiwang. Not finding GFRE's products on
the same sites is unusual for "…one of the largest producers of bromine in China…"


If we examine other sites that are less comprehensive or appear less relevant in the
Chinese chemical market, such as www.lookchem.com, www.globalchems.com and
www.made-in-china.com, we find mention of GFRE's subsidiaries Shouguang City
Haoyuan Chemical Company and Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry Company.
However, these entities are listed not as suppliers; rather, the actual listed supplier is
Shandong Haoyuan Group (not GFRE), and these legal entities are mentioned in the
company description of Shandong Haoyuan Group.


Readers of the Glaucus report may recall the central argument made by Glaucus
questioning the ownership of GFRE's operating subsidiaries and suggesting Shandong
Haoyuan is the actual owner of the assets. Attempting to locate GFRE's products online
points potential bromine purchasers to Shandong Haoyuan Group, not Gulf Resources.
These findings support the claims made by Glaucus.


CONCLUSION


When examining a Chinese reverse merger company featuring the many red flags raised
in the Glaucus report, it's important to do due diligence on whether the company's
operating financial claims are believable. Based on our analysis, we think that GFRE's
business claims are not within the realm of reason.

I have been on site at the company, hired my own auditor to do an extensive financial review and legal review from

I am confident this guy or others have not visited as I had reps there for months. We are considering our own suit for

Kerrisdale and Glaucus is a fraud. He rushed this out when he was losing. This is a crap report.


I challenge you guys to reach out to me to discuss this garbage you reported.

Just want to point out, again, that GFRE's response to concerns about inventory was wholly inadequate. They claim
they keep inventories low due to the hazards associated with bromine, however to produce bromine on demand
they'd require equally large inventories of chlorine, a much more hazardous chemical.


I have no position in GFRE, as my broker doesn't have enough inventory to short.

Well Chlorine gas is easy to manufacture with NaCl (salt), H2O, and a voltage source. You can also generate
it using HCl (cheap) and a stronger oxidizer (e.g. H2O2 30%...cheap), so I wouldn't be too surprised if they

Their 10-k suggests that GFRE get their chlorine from outside suppliers. They name "Shandong Haihua
Chlorine & Alkali Colophony Chemicals Company Limited" (among other diversified companies which could
easily produce some chlorine) as one of their "principle suppliers". I can't find any explicit statement saying
that "we purchase x% of our chlorine from Shandong Haihua", but they make no mention of producing it
themselves.

will sign up. If class action lawyers do not approach me I will look to go with corporate counsel. I have supported the

The inventory claims haven't been refuted - two sentences saying "bromine is dangerous so we keep
inventories low" are not enough to explain how this company can turn over inventory eight times as fast as
their competition.


Again, chlorine, the reagent they use to make the bromine (check the 10-K), is more dangerous than bromine.
It's more reactive than bromine (this is what drives the reaction which produces the bromine) and it's a gas,
not a liquid. If you have to choose between keeping an inventory of a hazardous gas and a hazardous liquid,
you're going to pick the liquid (bromine) every time.


19 May 2011, 10:47 AM


Stark Baddiin
That may be the case, but given you need to possess one to make the other than you have no choice but to
hold the chlorine as they need it to produce the end product.


If they have customers willing to take end product immediately you sell it. Especially if its contracted out
already. You are upset that they sell their product quickly? Have you been to the site and watched the
shipping process?


This is an easy business to check out if you actually spend time there and watch the end product shipping
process.


19 May 2011, 10:58 AM


Pat Carroll
This is exactly the point I'm making. GFRE says they produce bromine on demand to prevent holding a large
inventory because it's hazardous. To produce bromine on demand, they need to hold more chlorine on site,
because it's very difficult to buy chlorine on demand.


I can envision a scenario where GFRE would have more control over chlorine delivery (i.e. would be able to
receive small shipments that would reduce the quantity of hazardous chemicals they store on site) than most
commodity chemicals: chlorine is produced with NaOH, and in most places there's much higher demand for
NaOH than chlorine, so a chlorine manufacturer may be willing to do whatever it can to get rid of excess
chlorine. That said, shipping costs would be astronomical, and given the low grade of GFRE's bromine-
containing this doesn't mesh well with GFRE's reported margins.

Hey Chemical engineer, who are trying to fool. Bromine is extremely volatile in nature and bromine vapor are

Perhaps you're thinking of sodium chloride, or some other chlorine salt. Elemental chlorine (the compound
used to make the bromine) is a nasty, nasty gas which you're not going to find in meaningful quantities in

After some private message conversations with Stark Baddiin, I'll admit my argument a large hole. It assumes
that there is unpredictability in demand for GFRE's bromine, and that they have to keep some inventory
(either bromine or chlorine) to meet that demand. If every pound GFRE makes flies off the shelf as soon as
they produce it, then their low bromine inventory would not require the correspondingly high chlorine inventory
which would contradict the "concern for safety" they used to explain their high turnovers. (I know this is an
awkward sentence, but I can't think of a more concise way to say it)


Chlorine is more hazardous than bromine, though. Don't try to fight me on that, "materials scientist".


19 May 2011, 01:06 PM


Pat Carroll
If I have to choose between handling a pound of liquid that will kill me and handling a pound of gas that will
kill me, I pick the liquid. The question isn't the toxicity in ppm. Never mind the fact that you can smell chlorine
at concentrations well below toxic.

Actually bromine is more hazardous to human being than chlorine for a fact that Bromine is a very potent
carcinogen unlike chlorine.

See my other comment. Their 10-K strongly suggests that they buy their chlorine.


19 May 2011, 02:45 PM

Liquid vs solid argument can be twisted to suit any purpose. I can say that a liquid would be more dangerous
since it contains higher concentration of an element. For example, what would be more harmful to a skin,
being in contact with an vapor of an acid or liquid acid?


19 May 2011, 02:55 PM


Pat Carroll
Ok, how about this: bromine's primary hazard comes is its vapor. At room temperature, a hypothetical vat full
of bromine will only be ~20% vapor. A hypothetical cylinder of chlorine is 100% vapor. When you "spill" your
bromine, even on a hot day, only 20-30% of the bromine is released as a gas. The rest takes some time to
evaporate. Meanwhile, 100% of the "spilled" chlorine is released as a gas. Liquid bromine is nasty, but the
primary hazard is inhalation based.


Let's stop this pointless argument and say chlorine and bromine are comparably hazardous. Reducing your
inventory of bromine product doesn't make you any safer if you have to replace it with an equal molar amount
of chlorine.

Bromine is not an IARC carcinogen. There are plenty of bromine compounds that are carcinogenic, but what
we're talking about is elemental bromine and elemental bromine alone.

With the commodity boom going on, you're seriously comparing profit margins from 2004 to 2011? The world has
gone through a lot these last 7 years, and your comparison is absurd.


How about comparing Chevron's profit margins from 2004 to 2011 and writing an article - "Chevron: Financial Claims
Are Beyond Reason"?


19 May 2011, 10:30 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We note that GFRE has had consistently high margins from 2007 to 2010. Given the
changes in the supply-demand market for bromine during that time, it's difficult to believe that GFRE achieved
the margins that it claims.


Comparing GFRE's margins in 2010 to Great Lakes' margins in 2004 is applicable simply because of the
dramatic difference between GFRE's margins in 2007-2010 when compared to Great Lakes' margins in 2004.
The bromine and bromine derivatives manufacturing sector remains a commodity business today as it did in
2004.

Comparing margins of a few hundred million in revenue business to a $5 billion business is very difficult to do.

SA_Member_344233
Supply and Demand differences, you mean the price of Bromine doubling in the last few years?


Your comparison is like comparing Freemont Copper and Gold with itself at the peak and bottom of a
commodity cycle.


"Freemont must be a fraud because it has a 300% increase in EPS over the last 2 years..." - Only to later
realize that copper prices have gone up 400%.


I go back to my original statement, where are your facts? You have only used the following tactics: 
i. Guilt by Association (China Finance - ONP) 
ii. Rehashed old arguments that have been refuted (Glaucus)

Bromine prices were $1500 per ton in 2004 and pushing $4000 per ton in 2010. Then there is the low cost of
labor in China. There is absolutely no way you can compare these two companies on different continents with
those price differences. You were reaching and you know it.

19 May 2011, 11:27 AM


Stark Baddiin
Sahm Adrangi is the owner of Kerrisdale. I am sure you can find his information as well. You can google it as he
illegal markets his "fund" all over the internet. According to a site they manage no money of size.


What i find amusing is the guy distributes his returns all over the internet for his fund and brags about all sorts of stuff.
If this guy was a real manager he would know that its highly illegal to market over the internet and throw his returns
around to the public domain.


This guy clearly doesn't have a general counsel or anyone guiding him what is illegal and what is not as marketing or
sharing your returns over the internet is very illegal.


This guy is a piece of work. He profited off the hard work of muddy waters in CCME. So what does he do? He thinks
he can do it himself by writing very poor articles, without covering his behind with real due diligence like MW and AL
do.


I wouldn't want to be in his shoes for this pathetic attempt or for his marketing of his "fund" over the internet.

Manipulating securities is illegal. He tried to replicate a model from real research firms (MW, etc.) and failed to

Hester, Contributor
The only people who should be in court is GLRE management, but they never will, as long as they stay out of
the U.S. For the time being, they'll just keep tricking people into giving them money.


Ever wonder why GLRE has issued over $23 million in equity over the last two years? They supposedly made
$80 million in profit and had an average net cash (minus ALL liabilities) balance of $45 million? I guess they
just really needed that $23 million, despite the fact that they issued the equity with their stock at a low single
digit p/e.


20 May 2011, 12:09 AM


Stark Baddiin
No, no its not common practice. They don't tout their returns as this amateur does. I am sure he has legal
counsel for this behemoth of a "fund". You definitely don't tout returns without stating asset values as well. Tell
him to give his lawyer a call and ask them what they think of that action. Better yet tell him to call the local
SEC branch and see if its ok just to be sure.


Regard GFRE or GLRE as you refer to it. Why is it a scam? Please point me to the actual prove that you
have. Just claiming its a scam because this joker rights a poor article doesn't prove much.


I am also pretty sure you either work for him or are him so your credibility is limited. Have you been to the
company? Has Glaucus or the author? No, none of you have.


How about this. I will name you all in a lawsuit and we will see how you are all affiliated at that point when you

The SEC needs to investigate these research reports to determine the level of fraud. Clearly, there are insiders that
are gaining from these reports, and by creating panick, they short the stock and profit handsomely. Investors in Gulf
Resources should report this to the SEC to investigate the reports, the unusual large volumne of trading associated
with the reports, and whether there are "insiders" benefiting from these reports. I am surprised Gulf Resources's
investor relations team has not followed-through with this issue. It does not make these reports and the insider-trading
legal merely disclosing that the writer(s) are selling Gulf Resources short.

The SEC is investigating the fraudulent filings they receive from companies like Gulf, not investors that investigate
fraud. Gulf's IR firm handles issues like this, not their legal team. Because as we all know, their legal team is busy
finding a way to slowdown Gulf’s equity dilution.


CCG already instructed Gulf to announce a share buyback. That's the new standard response to allegations of fraud.
Unfortunately for shareholders, Gulf has no intention of consummating any such shareholder friendly action (unless it
can be used to perpetrate fraud). Is it making sense how this works? Their IR firm tells them to announce a buyback
or dividend plan and retail investors get bullish. Then institutional investors ask management, "Hey, what's the story
with the buyback?" At which point management delivers the response that their IR firm coached them to provide: "Oh,
ugh re don't know if re can get millings of RMB converted into USD to buyback shares..re trying to figure out how."
When investors figure the game out, they either sell or flip to the short side.


Look at Gulf's response to the Glaucus Report. You have two parties providing contradictory SAIC filings so obviously
someone counterfeited filings. Do you find it probable that a non-Chinese citizen would counterfeit filings, disseminate
them and hence expose themselves to allegations of market manipulation, wire fraud and other charges? Market
manipulation and wire fraud are crimes you can commit wantonly as a Chinese national residing in China.


Also, think of the skew in terms of compensation involved in a scenario like this. Let’s say Glaucus or somebody finds
a way to borrow $10 million worth of Gulf shares and that the stock drops to $0. Fantastic, they’ve made $10 million,
great work! But if you’re a stock promoter, extracting $10 million from an endeavor like this indicates
underachievement. As a stock promoter, you stand to make way more than $10 million. Hence, absent the threat of
extradition, a Chinese fraudster should be willing to say or do anything to keep the money tree growing.


Good luck with the RTO’s guys!

Did the author read the S1 he is using to compare GFRE - the non-existent firm in the S1 says they are going to get
Bromine from Sea Water - no need to buy anymore land guys - we are just going to use Sea Water - and this is the
firm you use to dis-credit GFRE - its not even a real firm - I had people in China look for it - does not exist folks


Keep in mind that this firm is not public on any exchange - is not a State Owned Enterprise nor is it one of the 20 well
know Bromine firms in the area that you can find on Govt web site - it does not exist anywhere - just in this S1 that is
truely a fake made up in April for this short attach - wow


And they go on to say in the S1 that they have a 2,000 ton holding tank for Bromine - sure, keep the stuff around to
sell on the spot market - I would love to see that pass inspection by the fire dept and authorities in China who are all
over these plants - does not happen - no one stores Bromine in large holding tanks - do you know who damaging that
would be and how dangerous.


Firm in China have been using Steel jugs for years - the same ones you can see on the GFRE web site. These guys
say they buy from smaller firms and then resell - nice try - state agencies in China - SOE and private firms have solid
relationships with those who they buy from - its not a market - they say the have 20 or 30 sales people - Bromine
sales is not like selling any other commodity - it is very specific and SOE and private firm need licensed and
dependable sources or risk problem with local govt agencies - the business model that this S1 lays out has no bearing
on how the Bromine or Chemical market operates in China - it is a S1 hoax made up by Shorts to get you to sell your
shares

very interesting:

NEXT STEP, CONTACT KERRISDALE 
I wrote to Kerrisdale to inquire if the firm would be willing to answer some questions via email. I received a prompt
reply from Sahm Adrgani, writing, “Sure, ask away.” I composed my questions and sent them to him. Curiously, he did
not respond. The following day I wrote to ask him if he planned to send the answers. His response: “No thanks.”


These were the questions:


Are you the male narrator in the videos, i.e. the guy who grew up in China? Can you please send me your bio? 
What made you decide to produce a report on CEU? How did you come across the company? Do you all have an
expertise in investing in China-based/U.S. listed companies? Do you have a large portfolio in this sector? Do you
have an expertise in the education market in China? 
Have you personally visited the company? If not, who was it that visited with the video camera, i.e. will you share a
name? Have you met with management? 
Were the videos which focused on CEU’s website made here in the U.S. or in China? If not in China, did you have
someone in China check the links and the payment systems? 
I culled thru the site (from the U.S.) and see that there are a number of links that bring up the error message, but
there were WAY more that led to legit pages. The narrator in the video does not note that. Why not? Did he randomly
choose links or were his choices pre-determined? 
Do you generally cover China-based/U.S. listed companies on your blog? When searching for China companies on
your blog, the next one to come up is Suntech from a post in 2009. So I don’t see much from this group of companies. 
In most of your recent blog posts, you mention at the beginning that Kerrisdale’s accounts own stock in the company
and, in each case, those are positive posts (you do not mention Kerrisdale account own or do not own stocks in
CEU). 
Can you point me to a post where you begin the post mentioning “accounts managed by Kerrisdale currently hold
shares” in a company for which you published a “Sell” or otherwise negative report about? 
Does Kerrisdale currently hold stock for its clients in China Distance Learning? 
GOOSE & GANDER 
I guess when it comes to short sellers, what’s good for the goose is not good for the gander. I thought my questions
were fair. Muddy Waters had answered some questions I sent them about their RINO report and added that they also
do proprietary research for private clients (lest I think the relatively new firm’s only claim to fame and revenue is to
publish negative reports on China-based/U.S. listed companies and then short sell the stock). However, I sent a
follow-up question to ask if their private clients were privy to their reports ahead of publication. No reply.

Kerrisdale does list their address on their web site: 20 West 55th Street, 6th Fl., New York, NY 10019. I have not had
time to swing by their building with a video camera as they did CEU’s, but I did call Skyline Developers who manages
that piece of very expensive property. The main office had not heard of Kerrisdale. They had me call the building’s
front desk. I was told by the person answering the phone, “Never heard of them.” I asked a second time and said they
would be on the 6th floor. He repeated he had never heard of them.


I am also confused where Muddy Waters is located—China, U.S., other? There is no address on their site. Are they
sub-letting from Wikileaks? All to say, there is not so much transparency in these so-called “research firms”
questioning other companies’ reporting.

Good for you Fha,


This guy “not a real company” knows nothing about GFRE and China. He just quotes Glaucus Research
Group “another person and not a real company” because he missed the bottom due to a great earnings
report. Now he is trying the same trick as Glaucus Research Group to get investors to sell so that he can get
out of his short position and go long. They want you to believe them over the independent (western) auditors
and the SEC filings. What a joke!

It's just interesting to see how "investors", or speculators got panic and sell off their shares after seeing negative
"public" reports posted by some vague so-called researchers with high tech gears like a camera phone and some
imaginations they exaggerate base on little flaws they could find in the company. People do react quicker and more
responsive on negative news rather than positive news. It's just sad.

Yeah, but here is the thing: Haiwang had an EBIT Margin of 36% for the last 6 months of 2010 (their 2010 reporting
year ended in June). So Haiwang's EBIT margin of 36% compares nicely to GFRE's 43%. This is out of the same
table that the 2010 FY 16% value came from, so it is an interesting omission from this article.

cheers
In the beginning, the author points to Glaucus reports saying that it highlighted shortcomings of GFRE and briefly lists
those shortcomings. He then says that since Glaucus did not discuss outrageous financial claims, he is discussing
here, as if he is building on to the Glaucus case. However, he does not say that shortcoming discussed by Glaucus
were effectively refuted by GFRE. That shows you can put together everything negative published (by anybody) about
a company without looking at the facts and add something else to that just to propagate your agenda.

I plotted shares-short vs. share price going back to May 2010. The graph is in my profile at: 
pulse.yahoo.com/_Z5EKN......


I'm not sure if that link will work, but its the only photo i have uploaded.


The graph is broken into four parts: 
1) Short interest increases and share price falls 
2) short interest increases and share price increases 
-- This is normal, an unexpected increase in price is a short opportunity 
3) short interest decreases and share price falls 
-- This is normal, shorts ar covering as price comes down 
4) Price collapses and short interest sky-rockets 
-- This is crazy. Shorts cannot cover, no-one is selling 5M shares at these prices. Their only hope is delisting.


Opportunity: Super massive short squeeze if a fund takes interest or buyback is executed.


Risk: Major shareholders say "screw-it" and take the company private, then re-issue on another exchange.


My only prediction: Expect non-stop hit-pieces as shorts try to cover, they need someone to sell them 5M shares and
so-far no-one falling for it.

Interesting web site about hit pieces (and Kerrisdale):

Haiwang is a good comparison as its in the same producing region. However did Kerrisdale even read or understand
the S-1 filing form Haiwang????????  
Look at p45 of the S1, Haiwang's margins for Bromine and Salt were 48% for the six months ended 12/31/10. 
Look at page 59 of the S-1, which gives the cost to produce the Bromine, with costs well under 2K (from 1342 to 1577
$/ton BR) its incredible that anyone would state that producing bromine in China was a marginal endeavour?

90% of the information hit piece authors are writing about in their reports are false and disproved. They may have a
genuine question or two (which they should ask the companies counsel about), but instead they publish a report that
is intended to be very damning purely to affect the stock price. This would be defined as manipulation, yellow
journalism (if any of these individuals were actual journalist) and is intended to profit due to the drop in the stock price
the day the report was issued.

Judgment day is coming.


The individuals outlined below have reported to the SEC for using negative hype in the market to profit. These
individuals know that they could post anything of negative taint and a stock would drop immediately. The latest case I
am following this was done and proven and reported to the authorities. Let’s see what they think in the long run. –
Madoff got away with it for a number of years, but I believe this one will get rectified shortly. A small fraction of my
correspondence below.


----------------------


sec.gov/news/press...


----------------------...


The following information on our site needs to be investigated.


hitpieceresearch.com


These individuals are using naked short selling tactics to profit off inside information and unproven (and later
disproved) allegations.


Unregulated "Research" Firms such as:


Kerrisdale Capital 
Glaucus Research Group 
Alfred Little 
Geoinvesting.com  
Absaroka Capital


And individuals such as:


Richard X Roe (on seeking alpha) 
Rick Pierson (on the street.com)


Are all using naked short selling and front running reports that intend to move the market to profit at the expense of
the average shareholder.


The companies they have employed naked short selling tactics, then wrote reports that contained allegations that
were easily disproved by the companies. Yet the damage was done. The securities fell, by at times, greater than 30%
in value despite the allegations being disproved by the company.


Naked short selling techniques and the use of manipulative "research" reports by unregulated firms should be
investigated for the good of the American people, the global market place and the integrity of the markets.


They won't stop until this is taken serious. They are not intending to help uncover fraudulent activities. They are using
the buzz of the 14 out 600 companies that have been halted to manipulate other securities.


All integrity and rules of the market are being destroyed due to lack of enforcement.

Hester, Contributor
"90% of the information hit piece authors are writing about in their reports are false and disproved."


Since way more than 10% of the "hit pieces" on this site have been on CCME and RINO, two companies proven to be
brazen frauds, it's pretty easy to tell that "statistic" is utter bullshit.


You know I could point you to a dozen long articles on CCME and others where the author stated false or disproven
information. Why not go after them? At least a little. Why not go after the myriad of fraudulant Chinese RTO's stealing
from US investors?


Oh, I know why...  


11 Jun 2011, 11:01 AM


Arthur_Big
Hester - thanks for swearing at me. That helped prove your point in a very classy way!


You should know exactly why i don't cover company's specifically as I don't do research on companies as I have
stated numerous times, so i guess you as well as everyone else does know why.....


I am focused on manipulation and insider trading. There has been a few cases that have proven fraud, yet those
cases involved insider trading.


What these rest of hit pieces are trying to do is ride the wave to use the negative environment to manipulate other
securities based on allegations that have been proven wrong. Using volume manipulation, shadow bidding, naked
shorting through offshore accounts and trading between them to say out of the REGSHO limits.


Can you deny any of these things are being done?


12 Jun 2011, 05:08 PM

"allegations that have been proven wrong"


Since you claim this is so prevalent could you share maybe 10 examples by the major players like Al Little,
Citron and Muddy Waters?


12 Jun 2011, 05:55 PM


Arthur_Big
Thank you for the homework assignments boss. I will do the same.


Out of the hit pieces on the comapnies I am following can you provide 10 claims that were proven true? Actual proof
not claims by the author.


I cover now: 
Rick Pearson 
Richard X Roe 
Absaroka 
Glaucus

I have done what you have asked read my prior posts.


13 Jun 2011, 07:13 AM


nostores
Nice, so you don't even cover Muddy Waters or Citron? The former being one of the best at front running damning
pieces and the latter having been doing what you call insider trading for 10+ years now?


And i'm not surprised that you can document a single case of 90% lies as you suggested.


13 Jun 2011, 07:45 AM


Arthur_Big
I have. Read my posts.


Do you really think I am going to do better than the Canadian SEC? That one is already being investigated. I followed
them till that point.


Citron the same - I believe they are already being investigated - so no reason for me to follow.


Now I am covering the smaller people that have rode the coattail and have been more egregious in their sloppy
reporting. The people that don't do any work other than spinning information in their favor and posting damning
allegations that they have no proof of and trade on it. This one is easy as people i have reported to have found my
help in pointing them out very helpful.


Just wait until you see what I have coming. You shouldn't be surprised based on what I have been saying. Pretty sure
you are aware of one of the parties that will be involved.
