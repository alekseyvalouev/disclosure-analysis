Lumber Liquidators - Management's Silence And Broker's Rebuttal
May Validate The Worst Fear
Jun. 24, 2013 8:06 AM ET35 comments
by: Xuhua Zhou


Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) experienced a roughly 7% sell-off since my last article was
published highlighting the existence of illegal and noncompliant toxic product in its
inventory. Despite having offered to send the company my noncompliant sample and the
relevant lab reports, I have yet to correspond with anyone from Lumber Liquidators.
Instead, Lumber Liquidators initiated an End of Quarter CLEARANCE sale for all its
flooring products per a marketing email received this Sunday. The company chose not to
follow up on credible questions raised about its product safety and instead launched a
marketing sales campaign to get rid of existing inventory faster. It could be that Lumber
Liquidators management needs to make analyst projections for the second quarter or it
may be trying to unload all noncompliant inventories before the California Air Resource
Board starts to crack down on the issue. Regardless of the rationale, it is hardly a
responsible decision on the part of Lumber Liquidators.


Rebuttal from Analyst at Piper Jaffray


It seems always to be the case when an insightful negative piece of analysis gets read by
market participants, certain Wall Street cheerleading brokerage firms would come out and
reiterate their bullish sentiment on the stock. They summarily dismiss serious questions
raised in the analysis and respond to every question with a simple and uniform answer -
we spoke with the management; everything is fine. After raising the price target from $90
per share to $97 per share on Monday of last week, Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith
issued another commentary on Friday responding to the evidence I presented in my
Thursday article. Mr. Keith summarily dismissed the issue I raised by stating:


"After completing our own research and speaking with members of LL
management team, we believe many of the claims made in the report are
misleading."


Before discussing in detail the lack of merits presented in the referenced commentary, I
would like to note that reading this comment was a déjà vu moment for me. Almost exactly
five months ago on January 23rd, 2013, I published an article on Joy Global (NYSE:JOY)
discussing the ramifications of the revealed misdeeds at Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1517322-lumber-liquidators-managements-silence-and-brokers-rebuttal-may-validate-the-worst-fear 2/12


raised serious questions about Joy Global's acquisition of IMM. The concerns raised in the
article were essentially proven true after Anonymous Analytics released a detailed 46-
page report showing with documents the financial irregularities that were present at the
time of IMM's acquisition by JOY. Another Piper Jaffray analyst posted a response to the
concerns raised in my article on the same day dismissing all questions raised in the
article. The analyst reiterated his buy rating with an $84 price target and advised its clients
the temporary dip in JOY's share price was a buying opportunity.


Clients who heeded Piper's advice lost almost 25% while S&P 500 Index gained 6.5%.
JOY is a member of S&P 500 Index.


Fast forward five months, Piper analyst again stated the following:


"Today's sell-off in LL shares as a result of a short report posted on Seeking Alpha
presents investors with an attractive buying opportunity."


Investors who plan on heeding Piper's advice and buy into LL's stock on the dip should be
aware of its prior track record given the eerie similarity of the setup between JOY and LL.


Piper's defense came in three folds:


1. Quality Control is taken very seriously at LL with the management stating all of its
products are CARB Phase 2 compliant. Then, the analyst noted the CARB regulations
are not yet adopted nationally. Even if it were to be adopted, LL will be overly
compliant. Products are extensively tested by 3rd party with random sampling.
Additionally, LL also spot tests on products at its facility in China.


2. Due to the amount of products I tested, the results suffer from sampling error hence
the result may not be valid.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1517322-lumber-liquidators-managements-silence-and-brokers-rebuttal-may-validate-the-worst-fear 3/12


3. The negative review issue I noted on Reseller Reviews is a result of cherry picking
data to put a negative spin on the company. Piper believes it is much more helpful to
also consider reviews found on Google Shopping with over 2400 largely positive
reviews because sample size is 28x larger.


Before the product quality issue can be addressed, it is imperative for investors to
understand which review website holds more value. In my humble opinion, Piper's claim
that Google's review is more relevant is one of the most preposterous opinions rendered
by a professional who is supposed to possess extensive knowledge to analyze the
consumer space. The Google reviews are notoriously known to be subject to easy
manipulation. The issue got so severe that Google itself had to issue a warning to SEO
and businesses to avoid fake reviews. In the case of Lumber Liquidators, the reviews on
Google Shopping are especially suspicious. Investors should take time to scroll down a
number of pages and actually read the reviews. Most of the reviews came from Online
Shopper (I do not think many consumers who purchase LL products do so exclusively
online). And almost 96% of the reviews or 3168 of them came from a single source,
Bizrate. Of the 11 opinions sourced from Epinions, 8 of the 11 reviewers gave LL 1 out 5.
Reseller Ratings is noted in my prior article which is also almost exclusively negative. The
reviewers through Epinions and Reseller Ratings are all individuals with names yet the
ones from Bizrate are uniformly online shopper. Amazingly, the equity research analyst at
Piper believes those online shopper reviews should be relied upon by investors to
determine the quality of LL's products and the level of its consumer satisfaction.


Needless to say, it is my strongest belief that somebody has been rigging Google reviews
and an email has been sent to Google to request an investigation on the matter due to the
apparent data discrepancy. It is my view that Google has a strong interest in ensuring the
integrity of its review product and we may see a slightly different Google review on LL in
the next few weeks should anything unusual gets discovered.


Furthermore, it is puzzling to me how Piper can state all of LL's products are compliant
with CARB Phase 2 when my lab report clearly demonstrates egregious noncompliance.
The noncompliant flooring product that was tested came straight from a box purchase at
Lumber Liquidators and that box is clearly non-compliant as demonstrated by the
presented lab report. The statement is patently false. Additionally, while the sample size is
small, they are selected randomly. Precisely because of that, there is a greater potential
variation of the extent to which LL has been selling noncompliant products. If anything,
investors should be concerned more by my ability to identify one egregious violator after
testing merely three products sourced from China. Finally, that very tested box was sold to

me as a consumer in the state of California. It is a clear violation of the relevant laws and
regulations governing formaldehyde emission standards in the state of California. Even if
we take a step back from a regulatory perspective, that box of flooring is supposed to go
into somebody's home and will be emitting excessive levels of formaldehyde heightening
that entire family's risk to a slew of incurable diseases such as leukemia for years to
come. It is simply wrong regardless of how one may look at the situation.


Management's Silence


After publishing the article on Thursday, I have been expecting to be contacted by
someone from Lumber Liquidators to address the situation and supply them with the
evidence and sample I tested. Unfortunately, I have yet to hear from anybody. Obviously
well-aware of the situation and my concerns, LL's management thus far has chosen a path
of inaction hoping the issue will simply blow over. From the commentary published by
Piper Jaffray, it appears the management stated to the analyst that all their products are
CARB Phase 2 compliant without addressing how I was able to purchase a sample that
emits over two times the CARB phase 1 limit. Instead of using its proper channel, a press
release, to communicate with its shareholders, LL has chosen to hide behind a speaker. Is
it because the management wants to shield any potential liability and therefore does not
want to make any statements they know to be false? Maybe, maybe not. But it does not
strike me as the management genuinely intends to deal with the issue in a proper fashion.


Activism Helps


In light of the lack of proper response from Lumber Liquidators, I believe further activist
activities may be warranted to ensure the public interest can be preserved in this matter. I
plan to spend a portion of my profits from shoring LL to engage a public relations firm to
raise the general consumer awareness on the formaldehyde issues in flooring products. It
is not limited to Lumber Liquidators but also other flooring retailers. Further, a plan is
developed to initiate active conversations with members of Congress who have
demonstrated interest in the formaldehyde issue. Public letters can be found here, here
and here. Finally, as a LL customer, I may plan to file a class-action lawsuit against
Lumber Liquidators so other similarly situated can be properly compensated for the harm
caused by the potentially unscrupulous products.


Conclusion


In conclusion, I remain steadfastly short Lumber Liquidators with the belief that Lumber
Liquidators' future will be clouded by its past. Even with an improving housing market and
growing demand for home renovation, consumers will become aware that the risks of

purchasing cheap products go beyond the mere lack of durability. Finally, at $76 a share,
Lumber Liquidators still trades at an outsized valuation despite the substantial risks
present in its business model and its future.


Disclosure: I am short LL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Thanks for the follow up article--and for your original article too--I am very glad to have this information. I hadn't seen
your new article when I commented on one of the comments you received in the prior article. That comment
downplayed the potential impact of consumer concern and anger--I think that assessment was wrong.


I just went to my garage and found that I have nearly a full box of the flooring left. If you don't mind, I am going to
send you an email to get additional information about what you found out about labs, testing protocol, prices, etc.


24 Jun 2013, 12:13 PM


Xuhua Zhou, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Yes of course. Please send me an email I'm more than happy to explain the process I went
through for the testing. It costs a little over a thousand dollar for a single sample. Let's hope LL didn't get you
contaminated products in your home.

And I really do think you are providing very valuable information. Indoor air pollution really is so much bigger a
problem than the vast majority of people realize. I don't think that most people would suspect that the air in
most houses and buildings is much, much, much than the air outside. The air outside has gotten MUCH
cleaner than it was in 1970. Unfortunately, the air indoors hasn't changed nearly as much--and most people
spend a lot more time in their homes than they do outdoors.

Have you tried to engage any local media outlets to run a test and story on your findings? This is exactly the kind of
hook they would love to have you "Stay tuned until 11 to find out which home improvement company may be poising
you!"

What was the approx cost of lab testing? Where can i find such a lab should I want to engage a similar testing of their
products? Many thanks for your thoughtful and detailed analysis!

Author’s reply »  quickshot, the process is detailed in the first article as well as the labs used. You can even
purchase the same product that I linked in the article to test and see if it emits .17 ppm.

juscheckingin
Would be interesting to see what you would learn if you reached out to current and prior LL executives. FB and Linked
In would be helpful in finding these individuals.


This doesn't sound like something that just started happening...maybe has been going on for a period of time. I'm
assuming that LL has sold quite a bit of Bamboo flooring over the past several years.


As biohawks indicated, local media would love to jump on something like this.

"obvious hidden agenda" ?????


The first line in each article is "I am short LL."


Hidden behind what??????


One reason why Seeking Alpha wants the authors to disclose their positions is so that everything is upfront.
That eliminates the need to impugn an author's motives or make personal attacks. It is OK to just plain
disagree. Really.


25 Jun 2013, 01:55 AM


cheeees
I'm long LL. I respect what appears to be diligence in your preparation of a short report to help boost your investment
thesis. I don't get the impression that you have identified with any degree of certainty the extent of any non-
compliance on LL's part. All I see from your two articles is a report of smoke with questionable evidence of fire.


Referring to Grant's Interest Rate Observer in the first article does add credibility to the short case on valuation but in
spite of his credentials I am still not sure why Grant would apply a 14 PE or lower to the stock that's much more like
Home Depot or Lowe's (24 PE) than it is similar to Bed Bath and Beyond or Walmart (14 PE). Rising interest rates are
not great for the housing recovery so I can see what could have initially put LL on his radar.


This follow up seemed a little weaker, starting with how your "credible claims prompted an end of quarter clearance
sale." Retail stores have sales all the time. Was the sale really because of your article? If LL was at all concerned
about Formaldehyde laced inventory it would make sense they would remove the product from inventory as opposed
to selling it for a lower profit while increasing any liability down the road from your impending class action law suit.


i also disagree with "your strongest belief that someone has been rigging google reviews." Even if LL has infiltrated
the Google Reviews to sell more wood I just think that Piper Jaff wanted to point out that you cherry picked. Read a
yelp review of your favorite restaurant and I promise someone has had a bad experience.

I am also not surprised that LL Management isn't responding to your letters because you don't have any legal
authority and are clearly looking to profit on the claim. That's what lawyers are for and I'm sure they are busy
positioning the company to continue participating in the housing recovery.


Nothing against shorting or using Seeking Alpha to stir the pot but I'm not selling LL because of these accusations
and I feel bad for anyone that is spooked. Sorry to be so long winded! Cheers, Cheeees


24 Jun 2013, 08:10 PM


Commonman1111
Cheeees,


While I respect your long position, and I agree with some of your points, I disagree with more.


I agree that any clearance sale/email by LL probably has no relation to this article. And regarding the "suspicious"
Google reviews, there still is no "proof" of tampering.


However, the author claims to have laboratory findings, so I don't see how you can say that he has "questionable
evidence." And, you wrote, "If LL was at all concerned about Formaldehyde laced inventory it would make sense they
would remove the product from inventory as opposed to selling it for a lower profit while increasing any liability down
the road from your impending class action law suit."


That is the point that the author is trying to make: LL is NOT concerned with Formaldehyde laced inventory because
they seem to be intentionally looking the other way.


And regarding any "legal authority" that the author has or does not have, does this make a difference when anyone
presents laboratory findings? And wouldn't a normal reaction by a company be, "We are looking into this."

Cheees, Commonman --


I just want to say that I genuinely appreciate the comments that each of you all made: More than that, I
appreciate the manner in which you both did it.


What makes this site great is being able to hear opposing viewpoints. It makes us all smarter to consider
those. Too many people turn a disagreement or different viewpoint that can be healthy and beneficial into
something personal-- immediately cutting off any real exchange of ideas and making it unpleasant to boot.


I wish both you gentlemen the best.

Thank you for the continued dialogue. As an investor and human I am not thrilled that our world is full of manufactured
goods containing carcinogens.


http://1.usa.gov/16w9JjH


In fact I recently returned a picture frame to the retailer once I noticed that I overlooked the formaldehyde warning.


And according to this website a retailer can sell phase 1 compliant products in CA until the end of 2013 so its not clear
to me if any laws are actually being violated. Is the author's tainted sample not phase 1 compliant? In the same way
New York City restaurants are still, for now, serving 20 oz sodas, perhaps they are looking the other way for the next
few months. It would actually make sense to see some more aggressive liquidation on the phase 1 compliant
products in question between now and then.


http://bit.ly/16w9JjJ


The Hardwood 101 section of the website is very transparent for the inquisitive customer. According to the Better
Business Bureau (BBB) Lumber Liquidators has an A+ The company has been in business for more than a decade
and this issue is not new. Just look at the dates of the user reviews that express these concerns.


The author prepared a very long research report suggesting that LL will be the next Brazilian Blowout then waited for
a volatile time in the market to post the article with price destruction, in my opinion, as his/her objective. I agree the
company should be looking into this and I am sure, regardless of how many shares senior management sold over the
last year, that they are.

The author wrote "It appears the management stated to the analyst that all their products are CARB Phase 2
compliant without addressing how I was able to purchase a sample that emits over two times the CARB
phase 1 limit. "


This suggests that it is neither CARB 1 or CARB 2 compliant.


25 Jun 2013, 12:45 PM


McMarc
What the author does not understand is that CARB Phase II applies only to the plywood or composite panel that is
just one raw material input that goes into finished flooring. There currently are no regulations on formaldehyde
emissions from the finished product. He/she should read the regulations more carefully.


The scaremongering about 0.17ppm is also quite funny. I have no idea of CARB's thought process when they came
up with their regulations, but Phase I MDF allowed 0.21 ppm! Phase II thick MDF allows 0.11 ppm, and thin MDF is
now 0.13. Why was plywood only allowed 0.08 in Phase I, and now only 0.05ppm in Phase II? In Europe, similar rules
exist for formaldehyde emmissions. Interior use hardwood plywood must be rated E0 (under 0.05ppm) or E1 (under
0.15 ppm). All engineered flooring made in Europe must use E1 certified plywood. Of course E0 is also allowed, but
the fact of the matter is all flooring manufacturers use E1.

I am not a scientist nor would I claim to be, but the fact that MDF was allowed 0.21ppm in Phase I makes me think the
levels of formaldehyde in a finished product (not even regulated by CARB) of 0.17ppm does not translate into "the sky
is falling".

He's hiding. not only was his a misguided rant, he's a self- confessed short on LL who is probably getting a severe
squeeze. LL currently asking $85 at today's (7/10) open. When this thread began, LL dropped as low as $71 on Fed
fears and I cost averaged my long position at that time. Planning to sell all at $90, the interim high just before the
pullback.

A big thank you to everyone who helped talk down LLs price over the course of this thread. Just sold my entire
position at 95 which included everything I picked up at $71 during the course of the preceding exchange. Very
interesting there's been no response to any of the recent comments by the author of this blog. Would ask that all the
naysayers make it happen another time. It's nice to be able to make outsized profits like this without thinking. Thank
you, again

Hi econ,


Yep, that's for sure.


It's more likely that the longs held on and the shorts covered at some point. One and 1/2 years is a long time for a
short to hold, but not so with a long.


Shorts tend to be opportunistic and longs tend to be optimistic. Pity those that bought in at over $90.


On some other LL threads there are some long time holders.


A ray of hope yesterday ... clobbered again today. Lessons here for everyone.

Yea your right definitely harder to hold a short. Definitely sad for the longs. Hopefully they salvaged some value.
Wouldn't be surprised to see some lawsuits and the stock go down more but I don't trade anymore so I'll just watch
and see.

Hi Econ,


I'm still an active trader but I don't go near stuff like this. Learned that lesson decades ago.


The only reason I have any interest in it is I turned on 60 minutes to watch the piece about Larry David and
saw the LL piece.


It's a curiosity for me.


Take care.
