Summary:  Ladenburg Thalmann
Financial Services Inc. (LTS)


The SEC recently leveled allegations of securities fraud against Ladenburg’s Chairman and


largest holder, Phil Frost, who owns ~34% of Ladenburg’s common equity.


The company was struggling before the recent news. Ladenburg has regularly generated


net losses to common holders and its balance sheet has become increasingly leveraged.


When factoring in Ladenburg’s preferred stock – with a liquidation claim of $425 million


ahead of the common – the balance sheet is already in deeply negative equity territory for


common holders.


Ladenburg has been issuing more debt and more preferred stock to pay out hefty


dividends and to support common stock buybacks. This dynamic never ends well.


The controversy is likely to lead to further fundamental deterioration; �nancial �rms are


sensitive to reputational risks. Plus, the worst may not be over; signs point toward


possible criminal charges.

Ladenburg: Near-Term Headwinds And
Unsustainable Balance Sheet Engineering


Published on September 18, 2018



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We think Ladenburg’s (NYSEMKT:LTS (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LTS)) common equity is


intrinsically close to worthless. The company has generated consistent net losses for its


common shareholders and operating cash �ows have regularly failed to cover payment of its


hefty preferred dividend.


The balance sheet looks deceptively secure at �rst glance, but tangible assets available to


common shareholders amount to only $126 million after stripping out (i) the massive $425


million preferred holder’s liquidation preference (ii) goodwill, and (iii) intangibles.


Comparing those $126 million in remaining assets against the company’s $357 million in


liabilities leaves common holders in starkly negative equity territory.


The picture got signi�cantly worse earlier this month when the SEC �led a complaint


(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp24262.pdf) alleging fraud against


Ladenburg’s Chairman Phillip Frost. The common equity dropped about 15% on the news,


which is roughly where it trades as of this writing.


We don’t think the market has fully priced the impact of this news. The company’s already poor


earnings and unsustainable balance sheet are likely to deteriorate further from here:


Investment banking clients are less likely to associate their businesses with a �rm whose


Chairman and key holder is facing fraud charges.


Asset management clients are more likely to take their business to another �rm due to


concerns about the reputation of the �rm.


Top talent across all divisions will be more likely to leave for a �rm with stronger �nancial


footing and a stronger brand.


Ladenburg has been in the headlines regularly since the SEC complaint and the potential for


more negative attention still looms given that signs point toward possible criminal charges. We


think the responsible move would be for Phil Frost to resign as Chairman to avoid further


reputational risk to the �rm.


A true separation might be easier said than done however. In addition to his role as Chairman,


Frost is also the company’s largest holder with ~34% of the outstanding common equity and


~5% of the outstanding Series A preferred shares.


The balance sheet has plenty of liquidity for now with approximately $263 million in cash


(including the latest bond o�ering (https://ir.stockpr.com/ladenburg/press-


releases/detail/2501/ladenburg-thalmann-announces-closing-of-public-o�ering-of)) but in the

absence of a sudden turnaround in fundamentals, we think operating performance and the


preferred dividend will slowly eat away at that liquidity until common holders are left with


nothing.


Signs Point Toward Possible Criminal Charges


In the near term, headline risks still loom. On September 7 , the SEC �led litigation


(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2018/lr24262.htm) against Ladenburg’s Chairman


Phillip Frost, among others. Note that Ladenburg was not mentioned in the complaint


(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp24262.pdf) and (other than Frost) no one


associated with Ladenburg was alleged to have committed any wrongdoing.


The complaint’s (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp24262.pdf) allegations


accuse Frost of aiding and abetting multiple pump & dump schemes led by notorious penny


stock �nancier Barry Honig. Frost stands personally accused of violating 7 sections of the


Exchange and Securities Acts.


The complaint described one of the fraudulent schemes as relating to “Company A” which has


been identi�ed by the WSJ (https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-teva-chairman-blockchain-


investor-accused-of-pump-and-dump-scheme-1536351719) and others


(https://www.marketwatch.com/story/prominent-health-care-investor-phillip-frost-charged-by-


sec-with-pump-and-dump-schemes-2018-09-07) as Biozone Pharmaceuticals (now renamed


Cocrystal, NASDAQ:COCP (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COCP)).


As I’ve written previously (https://hindenburgresearch.com/opko-health-if-these-sec-charges-


were-surprising-then-you-havent-been-paying-attention/), in early 2017, investigative reporter


Teri Buhl wrote that the FBI and the California Department of Justice (DoJ) had been involved in


the investigation of Biozone. Per the article, entitled “California DOJ investigating Honig and The


Frost Group (http://www.teribuhl.com/2017/02/09/california-doj-investigating-honig-and-the-


frost-group-2/)”:


This reporter has seen a letter from the FBI that states this person is a potential victim


of securities fraud. A check in the FBI’s victim noti�cation system, seen by this reporter


at press time, show the investigation is still active but doesn’t list speci�cally who the


investigation is about. Biozone is the only company the person interviewed by the FBI


held stock in.

The SEC is a civil agency, whereas the FBI/DoJ are focused on criminal matters. If a civil matter


is referred for criminal prosecution (or if the FBI/DoJ requests the SEC’s expertise on securities


matters) then the two will often work together. The apparent coordination between the DoJ


and the SEC indicates that parallel criminal charges could follow these SEC civil charges.


Indications show that both civil and criminal agencies are continuing to build their cases, which


further indicates that more news could follow. The SEC’s litigation release


(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2018/lr24262.htm) on the day of the complaint


stated that there is a “continuing investigation”. Weeks ago, Buhl wrote on Twitter


(https://twitter.com/buhlreports/status/1038145448341643264):


…based on multiple sources the FBI has recently been interviewing new informants in


this case.


Lastly, the SEC often provides notice of its intent to sue in order to seek to negotiate a


resolution with parties in advance. Based on a statement (http://investor.opko.com/news-


releases/news-release-details/opko-comments-sec-complaint) made by Frost’s biotech


company, Opko Health (NASDAQ:OPK (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPK)), it appears the


SEC had not a�orded Frost & Opko the opportunity to settle. Per the statement, “the SEC failed


to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to �ling the complaint.” The lack of any such


discussion could indicate that another shoe is poised to drop.


Balance Sheet Leaves Common Holders
Vulnerable


The recent controversy seems to be adding to an already troubling situation for common


holders.


A basic review of the �lings might leave common holders with a false sense of security. As


of Q2 2018


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029730/000102973018000012/ladenburgthalmann


2018q210-q.htm#s81A5DEF529CB6D2006C2FEEF3B99EC7B), the balance sheet shows a


healthy $205 million in cash and shareholders’ equity of $390 million. Despite these high-level


signs of health, a deeper look tells a di�erent story:


Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference. The Series A Preferred shares are a quiet little


balance sheet item that has a massive impact on common shareholders. As of the mostPrivacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
recent quarter the company had 17 million Series A Preferred shares outstanding with a


liquidation preference of $25 per share. In aggregate, this amounts to over $425 million in


liquidation preference standing in front of common shareholders. This item alone would


render common shareholders in a negative equity position in a liquidation scenario as of


the latest balance sheet.


The Series A preferred share class also pays a cumulative


(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cumulative_preferred_stock.asp) 8% dividend per annum


(Pg. F-33


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029730/000102973018000002/ladenburgthalmann


201710-k.htm)), which amounts to about $34 million per year. This creates a massive drag on


earnings and cash �ow available to common holders, as we’ll get into further below.


Goodwill and intangibles. Ladenburg has been highly acquisitive and has accumulated a


large goodwill balance. Intangibles consist of items such as technology, non-compete


covenants, relationships with advisors, and trade names. (Pg. 20


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029730/000102973018000012/ladenburgthal


mann2018q210-q.htm)) We exclude these to get a sense of the hard asset base available


to common.


What are common holders left with after factoring in the preferred liquidation preference, and


goodwill/intangibles? Negative $231 million in equity:


With a lack of tangible assets to support the common equity, shareholders are left to rely on


earnings and cash �ow to sustain the value of common shares.

Unfortunately, Ladenburg has consistently generated negative annual net income available to


common holders. Annual operating cash �ows have similarly failed to support the preferred


dividend.


Net Income Available to Common Has Provided
No Support


The past 3 years of net income shows that common holders are losing ground. We can see that


after factoring in the preferred dividend the common holders have been incurring consistent,


unsustainable net losses:


The cash �ow picture tells a similar story. Cash �ow from operations simply has not covered


the preferred dividend for the past 3 annual periods:


So how has the company managed to meet its generous preferred dividend payments (not to


mention the common stock buybacks and common stock dividends)? Largely through the


issuance of debt and yet more preferred stock:

these years)


It looks to us like the company has consistently used new money to support its existing


obligations. This situation was unsustainable long before Ladenburg’s Chairman was alleged by


the SEC to have committed securities fraud.


Net Income: Modest Improvement In the Past 6
Months Helped By Accounting Methodology
Changes


So far, we have done a basic review of the past 3 years’ annual �nancial statements. Notably,


reported metrics have improved in the �rst 6 months of 2018. In that period, net loss available


to common was $2.2 million. At �rst look, this appears to be a stark improvement compared to


the �rst 6 months of 2017, which saw a net loss available to common of $18.2 million (pg. 2


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029730/000102973018000012/ladenburgthalmann


2018q210-q.htm)). Could this be signs of a major turnaround?


Not necessarily. The improved numbers look to be due in part from a change in accounting


methodology (https://ir.stockpr.com/ladenburg/press-releases/detail/2497/ladenburg-reports-


second-quarter-2018-�nancial-results). The latest earnings release

1. The booking of revenue for commissions on future renewals of insurance policies sold for


sales that are estimated to happen in the future.


2. Capitalizing costs to obtain a contract with a customer rather than booking the costs as


period expenses.


3. Amortizing forgivable loans to independent �nancial advisors over the “expected useful


lives of their relationship period” rather than amortizing the loans based on their actual


legal terms.


For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new accounting standard was an


increase in net income attributable to the company by $5.7 million. All told, these numbers


represent an improvement over prior periods (with or without the adjustment), but it still


leaves common holders with a net loss in either accounting scenario.


Cash Flow Improvements In The Past Quarter
Looks Unsustainable


Similarly, cash �ow from operations during the 6 months ended June 2018 was $26 million


compared to negative $3.7 million in the comparable 2017 period. This is substantial


improvement. However, the numbers have been erratic:


Q1 ’18 Cash �ow from operations: Negative $15 million (Pg. 4


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029730/000102973018000007/ladenburgthal


mann2018q110-q.htm#s543E569D0ACC5267A0C360FA34FD18DC))


Q2 ’18 Cash �ow from operations: Positive $41 million (Pg. 4


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1029730/000102973018000012/ladenburgthal


mann2018q210-q.htm#s81A5DEF529CB6D2006C2FEEF3B99EC7B))


So why the enormous variance? Net income available to the company was $9.3 million in Q2


versus in $5.5 million Q1, which doesn’t explain the wide gap. The other key sources of


operating cash �ow consisted largely of pushing out payables and pulling in receivables:


+$9.2 million net additions to commissions and fees payable


+$8.6 million net additions to accrued compensation payable


+$1.9 million net additions to accounts payable and accrued liabilities


+$4.1 million net receivables collections


Operating cash �ow of $41 million in a quarter that saw only $9.3 million in net income is


clearly not a sustainable balance. Cash �ow should revert in the next quarter or two; the key


question for us is ‘how big will that swing be’?

It is essential that the company �nd sustainable growth that can actually support the preferred


dividend without relying on short-term working capital swings and without levering up the


balance sheet further. Given recent headlines however, we think it is unlikely that we see any


near-term positive surprises.


Liquidity: Fine For Now But A Ticking Clock For
Common Holders


The company has raised $202 million in cash in roughly the past year and a half through the


net issuance of debt, preferred stock, and common stock. There is no immediate threat from


the debt waterfall as the majority of Ladenburg’s $194 million in notes payable don’t come due


for 9-10 years. (Sources: Pg. 1

announcement (https://ir.stockpr.com/ladenburg/press-releases/detail/2501/ladenburg-

With roughly $263 million in cash (counting the recent debt o�ering


(https://ir.stockpr.com/ladenburg/press-releases/detail/2501/ladenburg-thalmann-announces-


closing-of-public-o�ering-of)) and no major debt maturities on the horizon, Ladenburg has


enough to sustain its preferred dividend for the foreseeable future.


However, with the balance sheet levered up and with a tremendous amount of preferred stock


outstanding there seems to be little left for the common holders. Over time we think the


preferred dividend will suck the cash out of the business, barring a sudden and sustained


improvement in fundamentals.


What Should Ladenburg Do From Here?


We think Phil Frost should resign to avoid more reputational damage to the �rm. As the


investigation and enforcement process continues forward, it is almost assured to create more


negative headlines and spook clients.


Additionally, we think the company should suspend its common stock dividend and buyback


programs. Both strike us as little more than window dressing. Issuing debt and preferred stock


to support common stock buybacks and dividends is nonsensical. This is especially the case

when common shareholders are regularly experiencing net losses and negative to spotty cash


�ow.


We doubt the company will do this (because of the negative signaling it would create in the


short term) but it would nonetheless extend the runway.


Conclusion: We’re Short The Common And
Keeping An Eye On The Preferred


We think the common is already intrinsically worth close to nothing and makes for an obvious


short here. The potential for more near-term headline catalysts and the risks of poor near-term


operating results would disproportionately a�ect the common holders.


We’re keeping an eye on the preferred but not taking a position either way. There looks to be


enough liquidity with the cash balance to keep the dividend chasers happy for the foreseeable


future, but we don’t have enough faith that the fundamentals will hold up to justify a long


position or even a pair trade.


Best of luck to all.
