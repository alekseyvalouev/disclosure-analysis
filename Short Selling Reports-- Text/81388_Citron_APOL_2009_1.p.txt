Needless to say our country is in a mess. We have allowed greed to blur the lines
between right and wrong and the result is the headlines that we are forced to read daily.
Unfortunately, this greed is not limited to banks and brokerage firms, but its reaches
have extended to the sacred institution of education. This year alone almost 600,000
education jobs are at risk because of state budget cuts. Yet, the University of Phoenix
(NASDAQ:APOL) continues to roll on as the #1 largest recipient of Government
guaranteed student loans in the country. When you see how they operate their
business you will be appalled.


Citron believes there are many headwinds facing the company including:


Increasing Cohort Default Rate for loans


Price Competition in the industry


Looming restrictions on student loans


This report will focus solely on Apollo’s unsavory business practices and the tactics they
use to deceive the government and their own customers.


All of the referenced documents in this report have just been made available in the
public record within the past 5 weeks.


Before we go any further, let us put one thing in perspective:

The state of Arizona has already announced that they are cutting more than $133 million
from public K-12 education for the coming year 2009. That is less money than the
insiders of Apollo have reaped from stock sales in the past 8 weeks alone!


Qui Tam


The ongoing Qui Tam lawsuit against Apollo has released some astounding documents
over the past month. All investors must understand that it is ILLEGAL for “for profit”
education companies to financially incentivize enrollment counselors for performance.
This is the heart of the qui tam suit and challenges a practice that, if eliminated, could
topple Apollo’s entire business model. While this case has been grinding ahead for quite
some time, these pieces of evidence were recently submitted into the court record. They
show UOP engaging in intentional and systematic deception of the government about its
compensation scheme for enrollment recruiters.


As documented in the suit, earlier in the decade Apollo embarked on a path of becoming
more of a marketing company than an educational institution. Since the year 2000,
Apollo has seen their enrollment increase in size by 200%, the faculty increase 100%,
during which time the ranks of its enrollment counselors swelled by a staggering 1000%.


Expressed another way, the student to faculty ratio went up from 9:1 to 15:1 while the
number of enrollment counselors per student ratio nearly tripled from 166:1 to 69:1.


Nice Case Summary (PDF) [ See page 48 ] 
And just to address skeptics who think we have cherry picked a few docs from the case,
it should be noted that Plaintiffs have submitted over 25,000 documents in hard copy,
and thousands more in electronic form that document their claim of performance-based
compensation for enrollment counselors at UOP.


Confidential Memo!!


Below is a compensation table in which the exact number of enrollments generated by
an employee is correlated to a specific salary level, pay cut, and/or cash award and/or
time off. The company has marked it “Confidential” — until now, that is.

Below is a set of internal emails in which supervisors are specifically coached by senior
staff to refrain from referring to “starts” or “enrollments” in written performance reviews of
enrollment counselors, although it is obvious that that is the main evaluation criterion.
Supervisors are coached specifically to rewrite page 1 of their reviews because “The
Department of Education audits these reviews”. 
Exhibit G (PDF)


Trying to Fly Under the Radar


The testimony of a former employee, who testifies that a company official (Director of
Enrollment Dustin Phillips) stated that the “performance matrix” (compensation schedule
for EC’s) was constantly being reformulated as part of a “smoke and mirrors” effort
intended so that Apollo could “fly under the radar” with regard to Department of
Education audits and prohibitions on incentive compensation. 
Exhibit K (PDF)


The Company Admits Wrongdoing


And lest you think this evidence is just little bits of exception and trivia culled by
disgruntled employees, look at the jaw-droppingly explicit admissions from former
President Brian Mueller and his crew at an analyst group meeting in 2006, now
excerpted as a trial exhibit: (Mr. Mueller abruptly resigned this year with no explanation
after spending 20 years at Apollo.)


Counselor compensation is one of the biggest advantages our company has had over
the years. It is our ability to incent enrollment counselors for their performances.


We’ve got 3,800 sales people…that we are able to drive specific performance levels
that we have not been able to drive in the past


Apollo Admission in Analyst Day Presentation (PDF) 
To which Citron comments: “Sales people? He really said that?”


While we do not believe at this point that APOL will get put out of business by the
Federal Government, we do believe there is an inherent risk to their franchise,
especially with an administration that has promised to focus on accountability.

Apollo’s application for re-certification under Title IV has now been on month-to-month
status for the last 19 months… we can see why.


What is chilling to Citron is the amount of insider selling of Apollo stock over the past 3
years (in the hundreds of millions), during which time they delay the inevitable court date
while claiming that they do not pay their enrollment counselors incentive compensation
for performance.


Glengarry Glen Ross - Phoenix Style


The boiler room mentality was revealed on the same analyst day quoted above when
former President Brian Mueller stated:


We call them six times a day for four days, 24 times in the first four days. We don’t
leave messages; we want a live voice. When we get a live voice, then we want to
transfer that prospective student to an enrollment counselor who’s best able to
convert that student.


Just to prove that these tactics are not a thing of the past we refer to yet another lawsuit
that was re-filed in January of 2009. Filed by a former employee, Chad McKinney, the
lawsuit portrays an unmistakable boiler room work environment. The former employee in
this lawsuit stated he was harassed because he would not commit unlawful acts in
recruiting students. The suit confirms that his salary was based on enrollment goals.


If I met a “goal”, which in essence was a quota of 4 new students per month, I was
not to be reprimanded. If I did better on the quota I was told I would get a 20%
increase in salary after 6 months.


Without even discussing the merits of the case, it is the attachments that corroborate
everything Citron has discovered about Apollo.

According to the lawsuit, blitzes are designated times (by the manager), three times a
day, during which enrollment counselors were expected to not leave their cubicles, even
to go to the bathroom, and to make as many telephone dials as possible, and schedule
as many student appointments as possible. To show how “boiler room” this whole thing
is, just look at this email from Carlyn Lindsten, associate director of enrollment. No
editorial comment is necessary once you read them. The Blitz (PDF)


Trick Messages


Another popular tactic of Apollo Group is to use trick messages to get leads to return
phone calls. Below is an email from Barbara Keramati and Marive Wright, enrollment
managers, instructing their sales force on how to trick prospects into returning phone
calls:


Trick Messages (PDF)


Only Starts Count


The most damning email came from an enrollment manager who tells their staff the true
spirit of their recruitment effort:


Remember, students have to attend three nights or post three weeks in order to get
START credit, which is what counts in the end.


Starts Count (PDF)


It is not surprising that this type of recruitment pressure has led to a graduation rate of
4% according International Center for Education Statistics, an organization within the
Department of Education. Now true, this number only includes those students who have
never enrolled in college previously. However, we cannot explain how bad this is without
making a comparison. Just look at Arizona State (same state) which has a graduation
rate of 56%. [ Click on “Graduation and Retention Rate” within link, above. ]


Welcome Mr. Arne Duncan

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak


In the midst of the government discussing a new era of oversight that is as far-reaching
as salary limits for White House personnel as well as proposed salary limits on
government-assisted financial institutions, we welcome a new Secretary of Education,
Arne Duncan. Mr. Duncan, a known reformer, has promised to reform education in the
United States. In a CNN interview given just two days ago he makes these comments
regarding the proposed $150 billion education stimulus package: 


Yeah, we’re going to have to keep very close track of the money, and we’re going to
have to implement this impeccably. And it’s very important, as you said, that the
money goes where it’s needed.


So how will Mr. Duncan assess the value of $2.5 billion of Government guaranteed
student loans being funneled through Apollo’s enrollment/recruitment boiler room sales
operation next year, only to result in hundreds of millions of dollars flowing straight to
company insiders as they cash out their stock?


Aren’t there more effective ways to shore up the country’s secondary education
institutions than this?


Conclusion


So let’s get this straight. The largest recipient of student loans in the country is a for-
profit school who uses trick phone calls and boiler room tactics to get students enrolled.
They admittedly pay incentive compensation to their army of enrollment counselors, a
practice which could easily jeopardize 75% of their revenue. The school has one of the
lowest graduation rates in the country …and yet the business model exists only because
of US Government loan guarantees.


And we are supposed to believe that this house of cards is invulnerable to education
reform? And further, investors should march to the analysts’ drumbeat that their
business is going to grow enough to justify the lofty multiple of a growth stock, as they
marshal the public’s money into the face of wave after wave of insider stock sales?


Cautious investing to all.
