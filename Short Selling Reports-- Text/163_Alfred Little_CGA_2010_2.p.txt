China Green Agriculture Fails to Answer Questions Raised by IFRA
Sep. 3, 2010 8:20 AM ET9 comments
by: Alfred Little


Wednesday after the close China Green Agriculture (NYSE: CGA) reported its fiscal fourth
quarter and annual results followed by a conference call discussion with the analysts
following the company. Notably absent from the call was anyone asking tough questions
or demanding management provide a detailed response to the due diligence findings of
the International Financial Research & Analysis Group (IFRA) that I summarized and
linked to earlier this week.


Yesterday my friend uploaded a copy of IFRA’s latest update. You can download a copy
for yourself here.


Here are the key updates from the report along with my comments:


A) VAT:


According to SAT records, from July 2008 through April 2010 Jinong paid VAT of
only 469,000 RMB (about $67,971). This small amount is completely inconsistent
with the large amounts reported on CGA’s balance sheet each quarter as shown
above. The difference is nearly $15 million (assuming each quarter ending balance
payable was in fact paid according to the regulation, which only gives companies 30
days to pay before serious penalties are applied). We have repeatedly asked CGA
management to provide an accounting of this huge shortfall. Where did these funds
go? To date management has refused to respond other than stating on their
conference call that the records we obtained were “incomplete”.


Comment: Obviously a huge discrepancy and even though going forward this is no longer
an issue, management needs to account for $15M in historical taxes they claim they paid
that cannot be verified by government records. 


B) Greenhouse Land Purchase:

Yesterday, CEO Tao Li claimed on the conference call that the evidence we collected
regarding the greenhouse land purchase was, similar to the tax records,
“incomplete”. He asserted that in addition to our well-documented costs there was
another 54.8 million RMB land use rights transfer payment to an undisclosed SOE.
Tao Li did not offer any proof of this payment nor do we think any valid proof exists.
From a review of the extensive evidence and PRC law:


1. It is clearly stated in the land use right transfer agreement that CGA subsidiary
Yuxing (Yuxing) acquired the land use right from Hu County government's Land and
Resource Bureau. There is no possibility of payment made to a 3rd party. The
agreement is titled "State-Owned Land Use Right Transfer Agreement" and it clearly
stated the seller is the Land and Resource Bureau of Hu County, Xi'an, Shaanxi.
In the Notice of Approval of the Land Use Right Sale issued by Hu County People's
Government, file number - Notice #16 (2009), it is clearly stated that, on April 3rd
2009, the local government had already taken back the ownership of the Land Use
Right that was subsequently sold to Yuxing. The document also indicated the land
use right was granted to Yuxing by the Hu County government according to the 26th
and 60th meeting by its standing committee. There clearly was no 3  party involved
in this transaction.


2. The same notice clearly pointed out the specified usage of the land is for
agriculture. Agricultural use land is much lower price than industrial use land. In fact
the “comparable” prices quoted by CGA management on the conference call were
for land sold for industrial purposes, a much higher cost use. We are preparing a
table of real comparable sales and will circulate in a subsequent update.


3. The designated receipts issued for the payment in the sale each indicate the
seller is the government, not the farm that previously owned the land.


4. Calculation of the Deed Tax does not support management’s inflated claim
because regardless of whether the land use right was purchased from a 3rd party or
the government, deed taxes are required to be calculated and paid based on total
sale price. In this case, the deed tax receipt and proof of completion from the Land
and Resource Bureau shows the 3% deed tax is applied only to the RMB17.35M
recorded purchase price not the RMB73.2M inflated purchase price claimed by CGA
management.

5. Finally, the sale price of the land use right was the result of an appraisal by a 3rd
party appraisal firm and approved by the Land and Resource Bureau. In the official
Confirmation Report of Land Appraisal issued by the Land and Resource Bureau
(confirmation file #14 dated August 5, 2009), the bureau acknowledged the
appraised value of RMB17.33M properly reflects the real value of the land. 


In this case, the overwhelming evidence strongly contradicts CGA’s disclosed
purchase price. The difference of $8,181,372 (over 4X) cannot be account for. CGA
management has still not provided any valid explanation or proof otherwise. And
seriously, who has ever paid over $120,000 per acre for undeveloped farmland?
Where did the money really go?


Comment: My farming friends say they would feel they’d hit the jackpot if they could sell
their farmland for $120,000 per acre! Even 1/4 of that is still an incredibly high price in
most parts of the developed world. 


C) Large Sales and Net Income Discrepancies:


On yesterday’s conference call, CEO Tao Li and CFO Ken Ren asserted that the
amounts reported to the SEC are correct and that all the SAIC records are
“incomplete”. This combined with all the other claims by management that their PRC
records are supposedly “incomplete” is nonsense. We remind investors that
management signed off on all these records and has yet to offer any additional
records to supplement those we collected from reliable sources. We clearly do not
believe such records exist, though management might certainly be trying to create
some right now in response to our repeated challenges.


Comment: Agreed. CEO Tao Li signed both sets of documents and needs to provide a
detailed reconciliation, if possible.


D) Insane valuation paid for Beijing Gufeng:

Comments (9)


When queried on yesterday’s conference call, CFO Ken Ren agreed that Gufeng’s
2009 earnings quality was “low”. So we ask: Did Gufeng intentionally shift some
revenue from 2008 to 2009? How does Gufeng explain the opposing trends in
earnings and cash flow from 2008 to 2009? What value can investors place on these
low quality earnings? Most importantly, why would CGA pay such a huge purchase
price and where is this money really going? To date management has provided no
meaningful response.


Finally, what was the point of acquiring Gufeng when CGA's own facility is at merely
40% utilization? And why is management, in addition to retooling Gufeng, spending
$7 million to add another 200k tons per annum production line? And if it only costs
$7 million to build 200ktpa capacity why did they value Gufeng’s existing, admittedly
outdated, 300ktpa plant at $33M purchase price +$14.7M working capital infusion?


Comment: I get the impression CEO Tao Li thinks his investors are completely stupid.
Gufeng didn’t make any money last year, why should CGA value it any higher than the
reproduction cost of its assets? If CGA can add another 200k tons capacity for $7 million,
then they shouldn’t have paid more than $7X1.50= $10.5 million for Gufeng's outdated
and unprofitable 300k ton plant. The total $45M acquisition cost is impossible to
comprehend.


I hope CGA management will soon provide some detailed answers to all of these
questions. Meanwhile the stock continues to fall under pressure despite the strong
reported earnings and low valuation. The market clearly has little confidence in these
results or CGA's future. Nor do I.

I used to trade this stock and made some money on it. But I haven't in a while. Too scary.


This is an excellent example of what can happen when you invest in a China companies.

I think the questions asked are reasonable but you lose credibility by telling outright lies about the conference call.
While your made-up company, IFRA, was not mentioned by name, several analysts (at least 3, by my count) asked
specific questions about "rumors" related to the company's land purchase and VAT payments. The questions were
answered, at length. It's outright false--and maybe criminal (I'll check with the SEC and let you know)--to claim that
these questions were ignored on the call.


As for the land purchase price, check the type of land that was bought and location (not farmland in the middle of
nowhere) and I think you'll find that the price was much more reasonable. I've done the research on land prices in the
area of the purchase, while you called a few farmers somewhere in China. Not particularly credible.

Actually, if you read his article carefully, there is one piece of official government documents specifying the
usage of that piece of land was for agricultural purpose. After listening the the conference call, I think this
directly contradicts with management's claim that the land they bought was for industrial purpose.


In fact, judging from the price reaction to the conference call so far, do you really think those questions were
properly "addressed" at length? My impression with that part of the call was mostly, the CEO speaking in a
different language and the CFO coming back to the analysts some quite unclear answers plus denying the
existence of such problems. I was not impressed with the new CFO. It was surprising he could not answer
some basic questions related to accounting and taxes, and had to get help from the CEO for almost every
question.

Hey, Goobers. Were you unaware that Chinese companies don't operate in a free-market economy? I don't know if
you know this, but the government is kinda intrusive in business over there. Just an FYI. Oh, and this big revelation
you're having, it's already priced into the stock. Why else would a company growing 80% have a 6x P/E?

I sure hope so. That's why I own stock in CGA and YONG. Chinese government seem to be highly interested in
making sure their large population gets fed enough. Might be purely humanitarian, but likely so they will be good
worker bees to keep the economy humming with 8%+ annual growth rates. Note YONG just got a nice new line of
credit from the Agriculture Bank of China that will help their growth efforts. YONG's EPS is $0.54 vs CGA's $0.90 and
CGA is flush with case and no debt. Assets to liabilities fantastic ratio. IF CGA got into $ need, they'd get help, but
appears smooth sailing ahead for CGA.


Gov't wants those fertilizers (especially green stuff) to flourish. Won't let um go under and will support rapid growth, if
they need help. Judging from CGA's track record, they "can do" on their own. Besides, what major analysts are

One thing will never get out of style is food. Food shortages dominated China's 5000 year history. Gold is beautiful
and good to own, but you can not eat gold. Investing in food and food production will not be bad.

Value Digger, Marketplace Contributor
his other article about the chinese companies listed in us exchanges thru a reverse merger, serves specific intentions.
it is his desperate effort to make the weak hands give the undervalued chinese stocks to the american funds. these
american funds know that china is the only way where they can invest to make real money for the next years due to
the slow growth of the american economy.


this is why you all need to read this which counters Little's clueless article.
