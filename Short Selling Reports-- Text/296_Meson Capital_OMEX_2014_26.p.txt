Oceanica Hits A Wall: Suspended At SEMARNAT Pending More
Information
Nov. 26, 2014 11:32 AM ET44 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


According to SEMARNAT website, Oceanica's approval process is now
"SUSPENDED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION".


According to local article, CIBNOR, a Mexican government agency seems to be
asking for many more data points that could take years to collect.


Given OMEX's perilously weak liquidity, delays at Oceanica or HMS Victory could
mean the end, shortly.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s two big projects right now are HMS
Victory and Oceanica. SS Central America is still tied up in the court of appeals so does
not appear to have any prospect for generating cash in the near future. The Odyssey
Explorer is on its way to the UK arriving in 2 weeks according to AIS. Will this be just in
time for an unpleasant surprise change of heart or attack by the actual Admiral Balchen
family? We shall see.


Any shareholder can visit Mexico's SEMARNAT site to see the official progress of OMEX's
application. As a reminder this is the EIA that took many months longer than expected to
collect more data and "vet approval" with local interests, expanding to over 4,000 pages
including appendix.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2714095-oceanica-hits-a-wall-suspended-at-semarnat-pending-more-information 2/12


The final entry entered today is "SUSPENDED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION". Given
that the EIA was so delayed and supposedly pre-vetted this certainly seems odd?


Perhaps it is less surprising when readers consider that the company responsible for
performing the (Oceanica) EIS for the project is QV Gestíon Ambiental, QV Environmental
Management, under the direction of Martín de la Cruz Quijano. Quijano is an ex-
SEMARNAT functionary from SEMARNAT's Environmental Impact and Risk Division.
During his tenure with SEMARNAT, Quijano worked for the controversial director Ricardo
Juarez who was investigated by the Ministry of Public Service and removed from office by
the government of Felipe Calderón.


According to a local article in Mexico, "Don Diego mining project has errors and
omissions: CIBNOR", the cause may be due to a government agency CIBNOR asking for
more information about the project which would include baseline testing and actual
environmental samples being taken as opposed to the theoretical analysis supplied by
OMEX based on dredging in the UK.


CIBNOR (previously CIB - Center for Biological Research) was established in 1975 by the
Government of the State of Baja California Sur and CONACYT [National Council for
Science and Technology] to promote science and technology development in the area.

We cannot know for sure at the moment as OMEX has not disclosed any updates. When
will the process get back on track?


Expect to see more of the NGOs, including US-based ones speaking out against the
project as it does not to have even considered the impacts on the fisheries.

Entertaining. But ill-informed as usual. Had you done even the smallest amount of due diligence by contacting
Semarnat, you would know that this is standard procedure for a mining application. When Semarnat requests more
information, they stop the clock on the 90 day cycle. But if you can get a little hype in your headline, why bother with
the facts, right Ryan?


Whatever happened to all of the large NGO pressure you were expecting to rain down on Oceanica? Weren't you
expecting CEMDA to come out swinging after the environmental hearing? Where are they? Why are none of the
credible NGO's protesting?


Cibnor hasn't done anything but ask questions. Why did you fail to mention this article in BCS yesterday which said
that another large fishing interest, the National Institute of Fishing (Inapesca) thought that Don Diego was "feasible for
implementation"? Did that not fit your story line so well?

"CIBNOR asking for more information about the project which would include baseline testing"


"Ask" seems the key word. Do any of the parties asking questions have the power to "demand" further
testing? Do any of them have the equivalent of a UN security council veto?

That is not how the process works. SEMARNAT is the over arching governmental group that issues the
environmental permit for the project. They do not keep all of the expertise in house, and rely on other
appropriate government agencies and subject matter experts as sub-contractors.


As an example, an Australian subcontractor killed the Los Cordones mining project.


28 Nov 2014, 12:27 AM


Papaoomowmow
"As an example, an Australian subcontractor killed the Los Cordones mining project. "


That's a truly hilarious example. You are comparing a "faintly possible" enviromental jaywalker (Oceanica) to
the virtual certainty of a serial killer (Los Cardones)


Everyone and everyone's cousin was opposed to Los Cardones, which had been rejected twice before. Why?
It was open pit gold mine of almost 300 acres planning to use cyanide extraction, and so would have
eventually released over 73 tons of arsenic in the milling process....in an area of high rainfall. Thus
permanently polluting the aquifers to a truly deadly degree.


28 Nov 2014, 10:54 AM

You missed the point of the example. You asked about the different entities and how the process works.

Mature response Ryan. I doubt the people who trust their money to you, if any, are impressed with your cartoons. As
for substance, where does it say they are requiring studies that will take a long time? They are requesting an annual
report, which sounds more like a report on how operations are affecting the area, not before they start. They are also
requesting verification of compliance with obligations under the EIA. Again, sounds more like verifying that work being
done is complying with standards set forth in EIA.

The bottom line is the necessity of the Mexican government to make this happen. It will take jumping hurdles and
we've seen Odyssey go the extra mile. It just makes common sense that Mexico (with the agricultural need for
potash) and even the UN will give up objections and enable this project to go through --

I may be one of the posters you are referring to. Don't believe I've posted here before, but have been a
member for a few months. Not an OMEX employee. Is that the best response you have? Keep up the really
hard-hitting, intelligent responses to legitimate questions from investors, Ryan. You failed to respond to any of
my points (and those made by others) that the article you use as the premise for your hit piece says CIBNOR
is asking (not requiring, since they don't have that authority) for monitoring and annual reports, not requiring
studies beforehand. Of course, SEMARNAT doesn't have to listen to them at all. But why let facts get in the
way of your spin. You never have before.

I do not have a recent profile and comment on various stocks, mostly when I find incorrect information being
disseminated to the readers of Seeking Alpha.


It would appear that those who don't read Spanish may have been mislead in this article's interpretation regarding the
latest news report (if you can call anything reported by Carlos Ibarra a news report). The BCS Noticias blog link
Meson Capital forgot to add, but thankfully Rory Duncan provided above, has the following summary introduction:  
La Paz, Baja California Sur (BCS). Pese al rechazo a la minería marina por parte del sector pesquero, habitantes de
comunidades aledañas y del alcalde de Comondú, Venustiano Pérez, la Comisión Nacional de Pesca (Conapesca), a
través del Instituto Nacional de Pesca (Inapesca) opinó que el proyecto Don Diego “es viable para su realización”.


Translated, it means that despite the rejection by the local fishing interests and local politicols in Comundu, the named
key fishing governmental entities believe the project is "viable for its realization". 
The article goes on to explain that these governmental entities are requesting that once the mining begins to take
place, that proper safeguards are monitored to assure compliance with the environmental protections which have
been proposed by Oceanica itself in their MIA application.


This all sounds very appropriate and correct to demand a serious compliance and monitoring of a project of this
nature. It does not, however, request that additional long-term studies be conducted as wrongly suggested by the
author of the article. I suspect his Spanish is not that good, so wanted to clarify the facts.


27 Nov 2014, 01:06 PM


26922203
Your response is entirely based on an article that was not provided by the author. There is more than one
relevant BCS Noticias article that is out there.


"It is considered that the information is insufficient since the purpose of identifying impacts, both negative and
positive are quantified robustly, information baseline must be provided with the accuracy that defines a well
defined production project".


An information baseline would likely take years of studies, as many of the affected species are seasonal
migrations.  
There is no data provided on the noise impacts of the separation barge shown in the EIS. It has never been
built, so how would one study the noise of equipment that does not currently exist?

"Nor shows objective data on the effect the phosphate release or exposure, increased turbidity and
suspended solids destruction of benthic environment will all have, and synergistically on the food web, system
operation and especially on fishery in the region, "says CIBNOR.


There are plenty of examples, including one of the latest mines rejected by SEMARNAT, Los Carbones,
where there was correspondence back and forth without suspension of the project.


Basically, you attempt to state the author made up baseline testing and long term studies requirements based
on an article provided by a third party, and not the actual article the authors statements were based on.


Now you just look foolish.

I would have to state that it is very difficult, without seeing the actual documents that CIBNOR and others have
provided, to make any relevant claims on what may or may not be approved or timeframes.


Looking back to the original Seeking Alpha article. The author states in the beginning that the SEMARNAT website
shows the project "SUSPENDED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION". this is NOT the typical response when
SEMARNAT responds with correspondence.


Typically, in the evaluation process, there is a notification of correspondence back to the applicant. The applicant then
provides a response. The process is not suspended while the correspondence is responded to.  
Evaluation can take as long as it takes, it simply has recognized timeframes for correspondence and response. There
will be a correspondence, then a timeframe for response, then correspondence, etc. this can go on in the official
cycles, as long as needed before SEMARNAT is satisfied to move to Elaboration.


The request for additional information in the evaluation phase and suspension of the evaluation process is not typical.


Without the actual documents, it is not prudent to comment on what is stated.

I will say, that in regards to the BCS Noticias article, many posters here are certainly cherry-picking the information.
The particular article referenced by Rory is cherry picked as well. The provided reference is a followup to this article,
http://bit.ly/1HJKn5x 
This article appears to state that CIBNOR is not supporting the EIS, and that there are significant errors and
omissions to the EIS.  
From both articles, it should be noted that while the Deputy Directorate of Fisheries Research Inapesca Pacific, stated
the project is viable, it also stated that viability was predicated on consent by CIBNOR on the impacts to marine life.
The impacts to marine life are not what fisheries have provided a response to, they differed to CIBNOR for that part of
the evaluation. Fisheries noted that there would be 'devastating' local impacts, and wanted to make sure the impacts
were monitored and mitigated. As noted, there was no mitigation plan submitted with the EIS.


Again, this is not primary source, but as long as the posters here are quoting the BCS Noticias articles, please include
all the relevant data, not just the parts of sentences, albeit out of context, that support your position.


My conclusion: Looking at the SEMARNAT website, the project has had a significant setback.


Additional comment: Further research notes that it appears that when SEMARNAT expects a significant response
time for information, they can suspend the process, rather than simply cancelling it.


27 Nov 2014, 06:44 PM


Rory Duncan
269222 said “The author states in the beginning that the SEMARNAT website shows the project "SUSPENDED FOR
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION". this is NOT the typical response when SEMARNAT responds with correspondence.”


Anyone with an internet connection can visit SEMARNAT’s website and see that 269222 is simply fabricating a story.
Semarnat suspends applications for additional information regularly. In fact, it is highly common. Most of those
requests are fulfilled in a few weeks. Some take longer, some shorter.


Look at project 15EM2014E0036 which was suspended on 10/13 for more information, reinstated on 10/29, and
resolved on 11/18. Or look at 29TX2014VD005 which was suspended for more information on 7/15 and reinstated on
8/5 and resolved on 9/23. Or you can look at 06CL2014H0006 which was suspended for more information on 9/12
and reinstated on 10/13 with resolution on 10/28. Or project 15EM2014V0030, 12GE2014V0009, or
17MO2014G0002. It is so inconvenient when facts get in the way of the story you’re trying to spin!


What is interesting is that after the applicant responds with required additional information, Semarnat typically
resolves the issue within a couple weeks. So, we can conclude that when Oceanica responds, they are very likely
near the end of the process with Semarnat. This is certainly NOT the “significant setback” that 269222 and Ryan
Morris would like investors to believe.


269222 also states that, “it should be noted that while the Deputy Directorate of Fisheries Research Inapesca Pacific,
stated the project is viable, it also stated that viability was predicated on consent by CIBNOR…” Yet 269222 fails to
provide any support for this statement. Support does not appear in the articles to which he has referred.


Regardless, it appears that very little environmental opposition has surfaced regarding Oceanica. There’s a reason for
that. Oceanica has provided a very detailed application that is filled with empirical evidence supporting the idea that

Did you see the request for information?


That is the significant setback.


29 Nov 2014, 12:42 AM


Rory Duncan
Wrong yet again, 269222. There's absolutely no setback. So what if Cibnor requests information? You can
request more information also, but it's not going to matter. Cibnor has no authority. You've got nothing.

Of course; I don't believe anyone here has an edge on the decision, but it just as easily be an approval. How
many mining projects that have been approved, in Mexico or elsewhere, have ever received overwhelmingly

an NGO, but I just haven't been able to find one.


Also, regarding your semarnat quote below: ""Finally, the environmental office believes that “the omissions

I'm sorry, but I do not see that that is a quote from SEMARNAT. At best, it looks like the author is putting
quotes around a statement without proper citation. Regardless, it is typical BCS Noticias stuff. They don't
have the same journalistic integrity (Ibarra) as a real news source and their bloggers take very very
"generous" liberties with their stories, to say the least. It seems, however, that everyone has come to terms
with the fact that there should be a decision BY January.

"It means there will be a decision by January." 26922203(aka Garscrappa)


SO: "We" (meaning you and Meson Cap) went from last year Oceanica being a fraud, to there is just clay, to
there is too much NGO opposition, to CEMDA will shut the project down, to "99.99% chance this doesn't get
approved," to "SIGNIFICANT setback", to: " it means there will be a decision BY (emphasis mine)
JANUARY??????" THAT IS YOUR THESIS NOW? A significant setback is a decision that was expected by
mid December to now BY JANUARY? Doesn't BY JANUARY mean, like, DECEMBER? Looks to me that the
CIBNOR is just putting their mark on the project and making sure that they are "involved" and that their
requests are heard, as what they are asking for can be done in parallel with the project.

Perhaps you should concentrate on reading the source documents, rather than spending time trying to identify
posters.


You do not appear to be competent in either.

Author’s reply »  semarnat: "Finally, the environmental office believes that “the omissions detected by CIBNOR,
confirms that there is no real basis: the project is based on assumptions and extrapolations; CIBNOR’S point of view
is very good”."

Exactly. I am not sure why most of the posters insist on cherry picking and arguing a certain sentence, when the
overall intent is very clear.

You guys are brilliant. Meson and 269222 broke it here on the pages of SA, folks. SEMARNAT has a new policy
where they will comment on the merits of an MIA, and the opposition to that application, BEFORE rendering an official
decision. And they'll do so via an obscure left-wing blog site run by young enthusiasts. What a stroke of genius.
Maybe this means that SEMARNAT is going to move their offices into BCS Noticias' headquarters so the information
can flow even more smoothly?

oooooooh, the BCS Noticias is really outdoing itself today.....take a look at this article....http://bit.ly/1weVG2a .... They
now say that Inapesca's decision to support Don Diego was actually dictated by SEMARNAT! Watch out, BCS! You
might just end up telling the world that Don Diego is already approved!
