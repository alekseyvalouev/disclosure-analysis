Our Criticism Our intense fundamental and forensic 
due diligence uncovered evidence of 


slowing U.S. growth, and margin 
pressure being covered-up. We also 
expressed grave concerns about the 
Company’s strategy to build a U.S. 


manufacturing facility and believed its 
capex costs seemed overstated, which 
would allow capitalization of costs on 


the balance sheet and potentially 
overstate earnings


Boulder Brands was facing a patent

Executive Summary
6


Spruce Point Is Short WD-40 (Nasdaq: WDFC) 
And Estimates 55% - 60% Downside Risk


At The Core, WD-40 Is An Oil-Based Lubricant Being Sold At Above Market Prices And Heavily Dependent On Its Brand Equity
 WD-40 relies on a trade secret, and has no patents, to protect itself in the market place from dozens of cheaper all-purpose and specialty 


lubricants in a variety of saturated retail channels, and user end markets
 WD-40’s heaviest users are maintenance and repair specialists, notably in the auto market. A long-term challenge facing it is the 


electrification of cars, which have fewer moving parts and require less regular maintenance
 In addition, WD-40 sells into the bicycle and motorcycle markets. Each of these markets are also under long-term pressure from changing 


customer preferences, in addition to the electrification of the market. Independent bicycle dealerships are in long-term decline, while 
children (the next generation of users) are also purchasing fewer bicycles


 We believe the product is also coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny. By analyzing changes in its product fact sheet, we see that 
more disclosures about the hazardous nature of the chemicals contained in the product are being highlighted


 Because of these hazards, we believe WD-40 is not well suited to an e-commerce environment. In fact, WD-40 recently added a 
disclosure statement in its product fact sheet that it does not recommend transporting it by air. The FAA also added WD-40 to its list of 
products that cannot be carried on, or packed in luggage, by the public when flying commercial air


Spruce Point believes that WD-40 (Nasdaq: WDFC or “the Company”) is widely misunderstood and believed to be defensive, but in reality, 
is facing both long and short-term secular pressures. With the Company recently upsizing and drawing down 100% of its credit facility, a 


size 1,500% larger than the previous recession in 2008-2009, we believe a massive hole in its balance sheet has been exposed. Our 
forensic review and channel checks indicate record bloated inventories, and material financial strain. We believe it will have to drastically 


reduce its optimistic 3-7% sales target and re-set investor expectations meaningfully lower. Trading near all-time highs and at an 
unprecedented 6x sales and 28x EBITDA, we believe shares are a horrible risk/reward. We see 55% - 60% downside risk ($75-$85/share).

A Major Hole In 
Its Balance 


Sheet Exposed


Investors Fail To Understand Changes In WD-40’s Business That Expose It To Much Greater Risk Today vs. The Last Crisis
 Late Friday on March 27th, WD-40 drew down the remainder of its $150m credit facility. During the prior crisis, it had a small $10m facility 


that was never utilized. We believe this gigantic draw down exposes a major hole and problem with its business. WD-40 is levered only 
0.7x Net Debt to EBITDA and projected to generate $30m+ of free cash flow. Why would it need to max out its credit line?


 In our view, WD-40 has no visibility in an economic recession. It missed FY 2009 sales and EPS estimates by 13% and almost 10% at 
the mid-points, respectively. In FY 2008 it missed sales and EPS by 5% and 13% and the mid-points, respectively. This time around, the 
economic crisis is greater, and we expect a much larger miss of its targets


 WD-40’s business has grown much more international today vs. the last financial crisis 10yrs ago. Today: 63% international sales vs. 
52% during the last crisis. WD-40 now obscures country-level revenue detail. However, we estimate the U.K is 37% of total revenues vs. 
9% during the last crisis. We estimate 75% of WD-40’s cash is in its U.K. subsidiary. First Brexit, and now a coronavirus scare, has sent 
the Pound to multi-year lows which we believe has compounded WD-40’s challenges


 Working capital strain has materially intensified. Based on our analysis, working capital to sales is currently 16.3% of sales, almost double 
the 8.6% of sales in 2007


 By closely examining the composition of WD-40’s inventory accounts, we observe that Finished Goods make up an increasing 
percentage of the overall balance, and more than prior to entering the last crisis. Days of Inventory and its Cash Conversion Cycle are 
near all-time highs. In our opinion, this suggests that inventory is building up and not selling-through to customers

Spruce Point Is Short WD-40 (Nasdaq: WDFC) 
And Estimates 55% - 60% Downside Risk


We Believe WD-40 Has Few, If Any, Growth Avenues Left And The Company Is Leaving Subtle Hints We’re Right
 As a 65+ year old company relying on a core lubricant product, it’s easy to understand that finding new markets and introducing new and 


successful products can be challenging 
 We observe that WD-40 is taking actions consistent with a mature company, including investing less and less in R&D every year, and 


covering-up disclosures about challenged products and ventures (recently WD-40 BIKE)
 WD-40 continues touting geographic expansion with a $1bn market opportunity. A year ago, it even listed Venezuela and Iran as market 


opportunities for its products. However, it recently omitted these countries from its latest investor presentation
 By far, WD-40 has been promoting its ambitions in China, once claiming sales would be $100m. Yet, 17 years ago it admitted that 25% of 


the market was counterfeits. We find evidence that counterfeits continue to plague its growth ambitions there. Asia-Pacific and China have 
recently become an extreme weak spot for the Company, and while it blames the issue on “formulation changes” and China holidays, we 
suspect there are more structural issues that will hamper its ability to reach its lofty Chinese goals


 WD-40 is also promoting a new product for the recreational vehicle (RV) industry, but the timing of the introduction is terrible given that 
nearly all major RV industry players have suspended production, and there’s concern that long-term industry sales have peaked


 With respect to channel distribution, we find that WD-40 has already penetrated major categories: mass merchants (WalMart, Target), 
home improvement stores (Home Depot, Lowes, Ace Hardware), auto repair shops (AutoZone, Advanced Auto, Pep Boys), drug stores
(Rite Aid, CVS), and dollar stores (Family Dollar, Dollar General)


 Our channel checks show some retailers offering their own store brands, like WalMart, and in some cases offering competing products up 
to 60% lower in price than WD-40’s comparable product. In the home improvement and auto center market, we find that PB Blaster is 
becoming a formidable competitor, driving more intense price promotion


 WD-40 recently started disclosing reductions to sales for rebates, coupons and cash incentives. The disclosure may have been pushed by 
the auditor, which recently added rebates and marketing program accruals as a “Critical Audit Matter”. By closely analyzing recent trends, 
we find that WD-40 gave its largest incentives in Q1 2020. We believe this supports our channel check concerns

Recent Management Transition Plan Announcement More Evidence That The Best Days Are Behind WD-40
 A majority of the executives are 60+ years old, and with a small company of ~500 employees, investors should pay attention to recent 


management transition plans. Unfortunately, not all are in shareholders’ best interest such as the CEO now assuming the Chairman role
 WD-40 recently promoted internally a new Chief Accounting Officer. A background check reveals that during her previous tenure at Cymer 


(formerly: Nasdaq: CYMI), it disclosed accounting errors and a material weakness related to income tax accounting. It’s noteworthy that 
WD-40 just disclosed a $0.63 per share reserve for uncertain taxes


 In our view, there is evidence insiders act in their own best interest. Insiders have misdirected 62% of total free cash flow since 2007 
towards stock repurchases at increasingly inflated prices. This has allowed insiders to materially reduce their ownership and capital at-risk. 
Current insiders own a record low 1.9% of total shares 


 In addition, we see evidence of management making usual adjustment to EBITDA bonus targets by ignoring certain expenses that look 
ordinary and necessary to execute its business plan


 WD-40 would benefit from replacing its auditor PwC, which has audited the Company for so long that no one is even sure when the 
relationship began. The current audit partner has a self-proclaimed focus on healthcare and biotech, not retail or chemicals

Spruce Point Is Short WD-40 (Nasdaq: WDFC) 
And Estimates 55% - 60% Downside Risk


Covered By Just Two Analysts Suggesting 15% Upside, No One Has Explored The Downside Case Until Now
 Despite a $2.7 billion dollar market cap, WD-40 is largely under-followed by the sell-side brokerage community. Instead, it appears the 


CEO has sought endorsement from retail investors through channels such as CNBC’s Mad Money
 The two analysts covering it have price targets of $210 and $225, implying approximately 15% of upside on average. Yet, we don’t


believe either analyst has conducted a rigorous forensic review and channel checks that indicate significant financial strain and long-term 
challenges that will cap upside potential


 The analysts push the Company narrative that WD-40 is recession resistant, yet don’t point out that during the last crisis WD-40 wildly 
missed its targets and experienced declining sales and EPS. We believe this time around, the magnitude of the miss will be greater


 Collectively, the analysts still see top line growth this year of 1.3% which will rebound to 6.6% in FY 2021. We view both of these 
forecasts as wildly optimistic in light of continued long-term challenges, and price increases put though in the recent past which aren’t 
likely to be repeated. To be clear, we view analysts’ estimates as aggressive even before the recent economic turmoil brought about by 
the virus


 Sell-side analysts also point to the recent plunge in oil as a catalyst to buy the stock. While we acknowledge that 33% of WD-40’s cost to 
produce a can is petroleum-based specialty chemicals, this benefit comes at the same time as severely depressed economic activity 
also affects sales. In addition, WD-40’s competitors (already pricing products below WD-40) get the same benefit and can become even 
more price aggressive to take share 


 Furthermore, the magnitude of oil’s decline during the last crisis is comparable to today’s from a percentage decline of approximately 
70%. We see that it took until Q3 for the Company to say that oil benefited gross margin by 200bps, and that was a full year after oil 
peaked over $140/bbl in July 2008. What’s also important to realize is that WD-40 had ~40 days of inventory outstanding then vs. ~80 
today. As a result, we believe it will take even longer for it to realize the full benefit of lower oil


 WD-40’s valuation relative to its own selected peers set of specialty chemical and auto part distributors exposes its extreme valuation. Its 
valuation becomes even more expensive once it becomes evident that overly aggressive estimates for 2020-2021 will be difficult to 
achieve. The multiple has actually expanded during the current crisis to all-time highs, and the bullish analysts’ even think there is more 
room for valuation expansion. We beg to differ. Only distorted financial logic would argue that WD-40 should experience multiple
expansion while an enormous hole in its balance sheet exists.


 Currently trading at 6x and 27x 2020E consensus sales and EBITDA, WD-40 is priced beyond perfection. Once investors come to grips 
with the reality that WD-40 will repeatedly miss aggressive forecasts set by management, and reiterated by analysts, we believe its 
multiple will compress to more realistic levels in-line with low/no growth consumer product and specialty chemical peers. At a generous 
2x and 12x sales and EBITDA multiple on our lower financial forecasts we estimate 55% – 60% downside risk


 For investors holding out hope that WD-40 is a take-over target, we point out that larger companies such as Dupont and Newell Brands 
have competing products in the space; neither have invested in developing the product category, or made an offer for WD-40. 
Furthermore, any financial or private equity buyer would struggle to make the math work at its current excessive valuation

Well Oiled Machine, Or Clever Stock Promotion?


WD-40’s share price defies logic and trades at an extreme valuation. Post the last financial crisis in 2018, management 
has directed ~62% of total free cash flow into repurchasing shares at increasingly inflated prices, while it methodically 


reduces its stake in the Company to almost nothing. The Company claims it is “recession resistant”, but we will explain 
why we expect the Company to experience significantly worse financial performance vs. the prior cycle, and investors 


should brace for significant disappointment.

Promotional Company And CEO


WD-40 “secret formula” is not patented, and instead a “trade secret”. The CEO, a salesman by background, used the 
Company’s 65 anniversary as a publicity event to showcase itself  with armored guards. However an expert lab analysis 


decomposed the WD-40’s chemicals and claims to have figured out the secret sauce. In addition, WD-40’s regulatory 
Safety Data Sheet also give clues about its composition.(1) What’s left, we believe, is nothing more than a blue and white 


can which can be easily replicated as we’ll show later.


Source: Times of San Diego, Sept 2018


“Trade secret protection, particularly for the Company’s most valuable product formulation for the WD-40 Multi-Use Product, requires 
specific agreements, policies and procedures to assure the secrecy of information classified as a trade secret. If such agreements, 
policies and procedures are not effective to maintain the secrecy of the Company’s trade secrets or if chemical disclosure regulations do 
not allow for continued protection of essential elements of the Company’s trade secret formulations, the loss of trade secret protection 
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

“Dominant” In An Industry Larger Players 
In The Market Deem Less Attractive?


WD-40 talks about its market dominance and great market position. Spruce Point believes it is a market that others 
chose to largely underinvest in because there either isn’t enough growth, or its not financially attractive enough to 
deepen the channel. For example much larger companies with greater financial resources, including DuPont and 


Newell Brands, each have multi-purpose lubricants, yet neither appear to have interest in acquiring WD-40 or 
expanding their offering further.

Largest Auto End User Under Long-Term 
Pressure In An Electric Vehicle World


Setting aside the current economic crisis where industrial and transportation activities are depressed, we observe that 
WD-40’s largest end user is in maintenance, repair and overhaul services. In particular, as articulated by the CEO, the 
major end market exposure is in the automotive sector. Unfortunately, experts believe the long-term green solution is 


towards electric cars, which have fewer moving parts, break-down less frequently, and require less maintenance. 
This inevitably translates into less use of WD-40’s lubricants in the long-term.  


Source: WD-40 Corporate Presentation, Feb 2020


“The great thing about our end users is the variety of our end users. From that, what we call our novice end-users. The guys sitting on 
his patio on a Saturday afternoon, drinking his beer, using about $0.40 worth of WD-40 multi-use product a year. To the guy who's 
earning his living, whether it be in San Diego or London or Shanghai or Sydney, make repairing a motor vehicle who could 
use up to $70 worth of WD-40 a year. Our lifestyle products like 3-IN-ONE, our new range of 3-IN-ONE RV products that are helping 
RV and camper -- people, campers, keep their equipment in good condition. And then WD-40 specialist, a line of product developed
especially for those heavy end users.”

“The electric vehicle has one moving part, the motor, 
whereas the gasoline-powered vehicle has hundreds of 
moving parts. Fewer moving parts in the electric vehicle 


leads to another important difference. The electric vehicle 
requires less periodic maintenance and is more reliable.”

“They have fewer moving parts, so there's less to build and 
less to break down. Many of the jobs needed to put internal-
combustion vehicles on the road and keep them there, CRS 
says, will no longer be needed..Conventional powertrains 
may have as many as 2,000 moving parts, Canis notes, 


while electric powertrains may have as few 20.”

What About Bicycles?


WD-40 sells to independent bike dealers and claims “Passionate Hobbyists” are end users. Unfortunately, kids (or future 
hobbyists) are less interested in bikes both in the U.S. and in the U.K., WD-40’s largest foreign market. Casual and 


regular bicyclists are in perpetual decline as are independent dealerships. 


Source: WD-40 Corporate Presentation, Feb 2020


“And from 2018 to 2019, children’s bicycle sales decreased 7 percent in 
dollars and 7.5 percent in bikes sold, a drop serious enough that retailers 
have already goosed prices to make up for lower demand, according to 
market research firm NPD Group.”

What About Bicycles And Motorbikes? 


Recent data from the National Bicycle Dealers indicate a substantial decline of independent bike dealerships. Meanwhile, 
using iconic Harley Davidson as a proxy for motorcycle demand, we observe that sales fell for a fifth year in a row as the 


it struggles to find new buyers, and has its own electric bike debut. 


“According to the National Bicycle Dealers 
Association’s 2017 report, the number of 


independent bike dealers (IBDs) in the US has 
decreased from 4,256 in 2010 to 3,700 in 2016, a total 


decline of 13 percent.”


“In some part, this has mirrored flat to declining revenues 
in the bike industry as a whole—an overall decline of 3.5 


percent over the same period.”


Source: “Hey, Bike Shops: Stop Treating Customers Like 
Garbage”, Bicycling.com, June 2019


Harley has for years failed to increase sales in the 
United States, its top market accounting for more than 


half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-
boomer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is 


finding it challenging to woo new customers.


“Harley said Tuesday that retail sales volumes dropped 
4.3% last year from 2018. Motorcycle sales in the U.S., 
Harley’s biggest market, fell 5.2% in 2019, the fifth straight 
annual decline”

China Reality: Never-Ending Counterfeit 
Challenges


Spruce Point believes part of WD-40’s international challenges, and why It will continue to disappoint expectations, is 
rampant counterfeiting. The problem persists in China, where more than 17 years ago, it admitted that 25% of share in 
China was counterfeit. The Company has been silent on the matter since. As recently as last year, a criminal gang was 


busted in China for producing and distributing counterfeits. Despite this, sales in China continue to disappoint. 


“The fake WD-40 is sold in cans which 
feature a slightly smaller 350ml can. The 
fake WD-40 also can be distinguished by 


the description on the can which is printed in 
Chinese. The real WD-40 is made in USA. It 
is sold in a 382ml can and features printed 


instructions in English and 
Chinese.” (source)

“US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
has seized a shipment containing nearly 
1,500 cans of counterfeit WD-40 brand 


lubricant sent from China at the San Juan

products have been circulating in the 
Singapore market.”(2)

Latin America Challenges


WD-40 blamed Latin American challenges on Argentina, citing sales down 10%. We conducted a channel check at a 
major home improvement chain that sells in Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, Columbia and Mexico and Brazil. At the low end, 
a 5.5oz container cost over $6.00 or more than 2x the price available in the U.S. The fact of the matter is that WD-40 is an 


expensive product in some countries where the locals may seek cheaper alternatives.

“We had -- we suffered from the Argentinian 
economic situation. We had some phasing issues in 
Mexico with orders. And then our business in Central 
America and the Caribbean was phased based upon 
price increases that happened last year, and there 
was pre-price increase buying last year, so the 
comparison wasn't favorable. So they were the main 
three areas that caused the Latin America business 
to be down. It's the first time we've seen Latin 
America fail to grow since 2012 and we certainly 
expect normal service to be resumed in 2020.”

WD-40 Is Not The Best: Experts And Customers

While WD-40 may justify its higher price by its best-in-class product quality, our research suggests this may not be 
not true. WD-40 may be the most widespread brand name, but it may not be the superior product. One customer

frequent applications due to its significantly longer duration.

Only Desperate Buyers At Drug Stores


Consumers that would be absolutely desperate and have an immediate need for WD-40 would pay more than a 100% 
premium to the price at a national drugstore chain. Although, we doubt that the first place that comes to mind to find 


WD-40 is CVS or Rite Aid. We suspect much of this overpriced inventory isn’t selling well.

Discount And Rebate Strain


WD-40 recently started disclosing reductions to sales for rebates, coupons and cash incentives. The disclosure may 
have been pushed by the auditor, which recently added rebates and marketing program accruals as a “Critical Audit 


Matter”. By closely analyzing recent trends, we find that WD-40 gave its largest incentives in Q1 2020. This is supported 
by our channel checks which show greater in-store promotion.

“The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the cooperative marketing program accruals is a 
critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management to estimate the cooperative marketing program accruals, which 
in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment in performing procedures to evaluate the status of trade promotion activities within the 
cooperative marketing program accruals, and (ii) there was a high level of audit effort and subjectivity in performing procedures to 
evaluate the current and past trade promotion spending patterns and the status of trade promotion activities used to determine the 
cooperative marketing program accruals.”

Liquidity Becomes Tight


Late Friday on March 27th, WD-40 disclosed it had drawn down its entire credit facility. We will explain why the 
magnitude of the draw down should be incredibly alarming in the context of its business.

“During the week of March 23, 2020, WD-40 
Company (the “Company”) drew an additional 
$80.0 million in U.S. Dollars under its existing 
line of credit agreement with Bank of America, 


N.A. (the “Credit Agreement”), bringing the 
balance on the line of credit to approximately 
$149.0 million. As a result of this additional 


borrowing, the Company has now drawn almost 
the entirety of the $150.0 million available under 


the Credit Agreement.  Although the Company 
does not have any current need for this additional 
liquidity, the Company decided to draw this $80.0 


million to ensure future liquidity given the significant 
impact on global financial markets and the 


economy as a result of the recent coronavirus 
outbreak. For additional information on the terms 
and conditions of the Credit Agreement, see the 
Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on 


March 19, 2020, which includes a copy of the 
Credit Agreement as Exhibit 10(a), incorporated 


herein by reference.”


“On March 16, 2020, WD-40 Company (the “Company”) entered into 
an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended and 
Restated Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of 
America”). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement modifies 
the Company’s existing Credit Agreement dated June 17, 2011 (as 
amended on January 7, 2013, May 13, 2015, November 16, 2015, 
September 1, 2016, November 15, 2017, February 23, 2018 and 
January 22, 2019, the “Credit Agreement”). Capitalized terms not 


otherwise defined in this report have the meaning given to such terms 
in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  The Amended and 


Restated Credit Agreement increases the Revolving 
Commitment from $100.0 million to $150.0 million and increases 


the sublimit for the Revolving Commitment for borrowing by 
WD-40 Company Limited, a wholly owned operating subsidiary 
of the Company for Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India, 


from $50.0 million to $100.0 million. In addition to other non-
material and technical amendments to the Credit Agreement, the 
Amended and Restated Agreement modifies certain restrictive 


covenants. An exception to a prohibition on Investments has been 
added to allow for intercompany loans or advances from any Loan 
Party to Subsidiaries which are not Loan Parties in an aggregate 


amount of up to $5.0 million outstanding at any time.  In addition, an 
exception for Investments not otherwise covered by an exception has 
been increased from $2.5 to $5.0 million. The Amended and Restated 
Credit Agreement includes a new schedule of Permitted Consolidated 
Capital Expenditures to permit the Company to make contemplated 


capital investments in the current and future fiscal years of up to 
$30.5 million in fiscal year 2020, $19.0 million in fiscal year 2021, and 


$15.0 million for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025”

A Hole Appears In WD-40’s Balance Sheet


Source: Company filings
Note: WD-40 increased capex projections from $25m to $31m for 2020, but given historical operating cash flow of $60m+ per year and projected net income of $65-$66.2m, 
it shouldn’t need such a high borrowing

In September 2008, we entered into an 
unsecured loan agreement for the 


aforementioned $10 million credit facility, 
which expires in October 2011. The proceeds 


of the new credit facility are available for 
general working capital purposes.  The credit 


facility is currently undrawn.


As of November 30, 2019, the Company had a balance 
of $58.6 million of outstanding draws on the line of 
credit. During the week of March 23, 2020, WD-40 


Company (the “Company”) drew an additional $80.0 
million in U.S. Dollars under its existing line of credit 
agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the “Credit

additional borrowing, the Company has now drawn

under the Credit Agreement


+1,500%


Something looks incredibly wrong with the magnitude of WD-40’s recent full credit draw-down. WD-40’s balance sheet 
still appears quite strong with Net Debt / EBITDA of just 0.7x. During the great financial crisis, WD-40 secured a $10m 
credit facility which it never had to use. Recently, WD-40 used 100% of an upsized $150m credit facility. To put this in 


perspective, the credit facility is 15x bigger despite sales and EBITDA having grown 33% and 90% respectively.

Evidence of Ballooning Inventory


Source: Company filings


By closely examining the composition of WD-40’s inventory accounts, we observe that Finished Goods make up an 
increasing percentage of the overall balance, and more than prior to entering the last crisis. In our opinion, this 


suggests that inventory is building up and not selling-through to customers.

Evidence of Peak Financial Strain

Spruce Point’s working capital analysis has proven a prescient indicator of numerous financial disasters. 
We conducted a similar analysis on WD-40 and find that its current working capital to LTM sales ratio is materially 


higher today at 16.3% of sales than it was prior to the last financial crisis.

Extreme Exposure To Currency


We estimate 75% of WD-40’s cash is in its U.K. subsidiary. A falling British Pound creates material risk to the business. 
The Company doesn’t quantify the amount, but based on its UK filings, we can estimate the exposure. First Brexit, and 


now a coronavirus scare, has sent the Pound to multi-year lows

“All of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in 
currencies other than the U.S. Dollar and a 


significant portion of our consolidated cash 
balance is denominated in these foreign 


functional currencies, particularly at our U.K.

a result, our cash and cash equivalents balances are 


subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these 
functional currencies against the U.S. Dollar at the

Greater International Exposure Will 
Exacerbate WD-40’s Pain This Cycle


Looking carefully today vs. the last financial crisis, we see that WD-40 is materially more exposed to international 
markets today (63%) vs. the last crisis (52%). The Company now obscures country-level revenue detail. However, we 


estimate the U.K is 37% of total revenues vs. 9% during the last crisis. 


Global operations outside the U.S. expose the Company to uncertain conditions, foreign currency exchange rate risk and 
other risks in international markets.  The Company’s sales outside of the U.S. were approximately 63% of consolidated net sales in 
fiscal year 2019 and one of its strategic initiatives includes maximizing the WD-40 Multi-Use Product through geographic expansion 
and market penetration.

WD-40 “Recession Resistant” According To 
The CEO 


Investors should not rely on history for a guide to WD-40’s future. The CEO claimed last year that the business was 
recession resistant, and that business was stable, and would have grown, if not for currency movements. 


“And then can you just, I mean, there's been a lot of investor anxiety, I guess, over the potential for a recession 
in the U.S., at least. Can you just remind me how your business behaves in a recession? Is it actually a 
little bit countercyclical? Or can you just give a little bit color about the nature of your business in that kind of 
environment?”


WD-40 
Analyst 
Linda 


Weiser


CEO Ridge 
Response 
To Analyst


“We're not recession proof, but we have been called recession resistant. And past history, I've been 
around for 30 years in the business. We've come through, we continued to invest in our business through the 
recessions, whether there will -- and the other thing that plays even more in our favor now is our geographic 
diversity. In 2008, when we had the financial crisis, our business was actually sideways, we actually 
grew a little, and if it wasn't for the collapse, if you will, of the pound-U.S. dollar exchange rate, we would have 
grown. But the impact was more in the U.S., not in Europe. So let's hope that we don't talk ourselves into a 
recession, and let's hope that we continue to make large hotdogs and put them on good buns and don't actually 
find ourselves in that position. But we feel that our spread across geography and our spread across trade 
channels gives us the best chance we can possibly have to ride through different economic conditions in 
different countries at different times around the world.”

Reality From The Financial Crisis


It’s unclear what the CEO meant when he said its business was “sideways” during the last crisis. All of its key 
financial metrics declined by single digits. Today, its business is more levered and has greater international exposure. 


As a result, we expect a much larger impact to Company results.

Already Missing Targets Before Things Went 
From Bad To Horrible


Spruce Point believes that long-term fundamental challenges are already beginning to weigh on WD-40, and this is before the macro 
environment went from bad to horrible with the coronavirus. Notice the acute weakness in Asia, notably China, where management 


claims it has a large market opportunity. The CEO is adamant that recent results “no way reflect a trend”.


• Total net sales for the first quarter were $98.6 million, a decrease of 3 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. 
Translation of the Company's foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable 
impact on sales for the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, total net sales for the first quarter would have been $100.8 
million, relatively constant compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. 


• Diluted earnings per share were $0.88 compared to $0.95 in the prior year fiscal quarter.
• Gross margin percentage was 54.3 percent compared to 55.1 percent in the prior year fiscal quarter.
• Net sales of maintenance products, which are considered the primary growth focus for the Company, decreased 3 percent in 


the first quarter when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales of WD-40 
Multi-Use Product within the Asia-Pacific segment


• Net sales in Asia-Pacific decreased 15 percent in the first quarter due to a 21 percent decrease in sales in the Asia-
Pacific distributor markets and a 23 percent decrease in sales in China. The decline in sales in both regions was attributable 
to the timing of customer orders from period to period. These declines were partially offset by higher sales in Australia which 
increased 5 percent compared to the prior year fiscal quarter.

Source: Q1 2020 press release and conference call


"Our guidance reflects the Company's current view of the business," said Jay Rembolt, WD-40 Company's vice president and 
chief financial officer.  "The revenue softness we experienced in the first quarter was primarily driven by the timing of customer 
orders and we expect that sales activity will shift into later quarters.  We remain comfortable with our current guidance range 
and are reiterating it today.“


CEO Ridge on Conference Call: “Though these results may look disappointing, they no way reflect a trend. In fact, we see 
lots of opportunities for growth as we continue to maximize the product line through geographic expansion, increased market 
penetration and premiumization of the blue and yellow can with a little red top”.


The Company reiterates the following guidance for fiscal year 2020:
• Net sales growth is projected to be between 3 and 7 percent with net sales expected to be between $436m and $453m.
• Gross margin percentage for the full year is expected to be between 54 and 55 percent. 
• Advertising and promotion investments are projected to be between 5.5 and 6.0 percent of net sales.
• The provision for income tax is expected to be between 20 and 22 percent.
• Net income is projected to be between $65.0 million and $66.2 million.
• Diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $4.74 and $4.83 based on an estimated 13.7 million weighted average 


shares outstanding.

Limited Visibility Into Financial Targets 
During Past Recession


In our view, WD-40 has no visibility in an economic recession. It missed FY 2009 sales and EPS estimates by 13% and 
almost 10% at the mid-point, respectively. In FY 2008 it missed sales and EPS by 5% and 13% and the mid-points, 


respectively. This time around, the economic crisis is greater, and we expect a much larger miss of its targets.


WD-40 Company expects fiscal year 2009 net sales to grow 2%-8% to $323-$343 million. 
The company expects earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.85 based on an estimated 16.6 million 
shares outstanding. “These are very unusual times and we are aware that we may need to 
do things differently,” Ridge said

Recent Organizational Changes And Long-

We believe investors fail to see that the current long-tenured management team is rapidly aging (the average executive 
age is 60 years old) and that organization changes could strain the Company. WD-40 has only 495 employees, and if it 


cannot promote internally, will have to recruit outside talent.

Absurd Bonus Calculations


We illustrated how WD-40 insiders have used the corporate buyback in a period where they have sold a significant 
amount of stock to reduce their ownership to record low levels. In addition, we believe insiders milk compensation 
with loose pay practices. To illustrate, management recently adjusted its EBITDA bonus calculation for advertising 
and sales promotion expense “to increase digital presence and build brand awareness”. Excuse our ignorance, but 


how can this cost not reasonably be expected to form a part of the Company’s core operations?

Chief Accounting Officer’s Past History With 
Errors And Material Weaknesses 


Spruce Point believes that investors should be concerned that Ms. Rae Ann Partlo, WD-40’s long-time Corporate 
Controller, and now Chief Accounting Officer, came from Cymer Inc. Cymer, a manufacturer of light sources for the 


semiconductor industry, which also was based in San Diego. During Ms. Partlo’s tenure at Cymer, it disclosed 
accounting errors and a material weakness related to income tax accounting. This is interesting in light of the Company 


disclosing provisions for uncertain tax in July 2019 that were used to lower EPS estimates by $0.63 cents.(1) WD-40’s 
auditor also disclosed income taxes and the uncertain tax position as a “Critical Audit Matter” in the recent 10-K.(2)

Who’s Auditing WD-40?


Audit Partner Self-Proclaimed Focus on 
Biotechnology and Healthcare


Other Public Companies Audited By WD-40’s 
Engagement Partner


Source: PCAOBSource: Twitter


Spruce Point believes its time for a new auditor to review WD-40’s books. PwC has been the auditor since at least 
1972, but in reality has no idea how long its been checking the books. The current audit partner admits she is focused 


on the biotechnology and healthcare industries, not chemicals or consumer products which is more germane to 
WD-40’s business. Her other listed clients, Sophiris Biotech and Vital Therapies (now Immunic) are penny stock and 


microcap companies.

A Retail Geared Stock Promotion?


Spruce Point is concerned to see WD-40’s CEO promoting his investment case on Jim Cramer’s Mad Money, a venue 
that attracts many retail investors. The CEO offered a perplexing view on his Company, claiming they are in the 


“memories” business. 


“If you asked me what business we’re in, we’re in the memories

Sell-Side Promotion


WD-40 has just two analysts that form the “consensus” bullish view, a view we argue is based on incomplete analysis 
and overly-optimistic assumptions. Recent optimism centers on oil input costs declining, which is a potential benefit 
we address later, that is at least 6 months away, and won’t forestall extreme short and long-term demand destruction. 


With an average sell-side price target of $217.50 (implying just 9% upside), we see an incredibly poor risk/reward.

WD-40’s valuation is disconnected from reality, yet overly bullish sell-side analysts see room for more expansion?

Food For Thought: 
Is WD-40 More Valuable Than Coca-Cola?


Coca-Cola is an iconic world-wide American brand that also depends on its “trade secret” formula and brand equity. To put WD-40’s 
extreme valuation in perspective, we compare the two. Not only does Coca-Cola have broader diversification, but also significantly higher 


margins and growth potential despite being 88x larger.

Drop In Oil Prices Not A Near-Term Benefit


Some bulls might argue that the unprecedented drop in crude oil is a massive windfall for WD-40. The Company says that 33% of its 
cost of to produce a can is petroleum-based specialty chemicals. Of course, the problem is that low oil prices are coinciding with 


severely depressed economic activity which we expect to materially depress sales. In addition, WD-40’s competitors (already pricing 
products below WD-40) get the same benefit and can become even more price aggressive to take share. Moreover, the impact of oil 
prices flowing through is upwards of 120 days, and that is after the Company must work through its record bloated finished goods


inventory. Current inventory days outstanding are near 80.

Jan 9, 2020:  Q1 2019 Comments On Oil 


“Pricing wise, we have a very -- our current pricing 
structure is in place and we see no reason to change that 
current pricing structure. You're right about that, it is about 
90 to 120 days. We are on FIFO with -- in that time 
between when it's -- when the new lower material costs 
come into our manufacturing facility, and by the time it 
gets through to us, inventory, and on the end, it's 90, 
120 days, maybe a little bit more. So -- which is why we 
haven't really made any changes to guidance going out.”


WD-40
CFO


Rembolt


“Okay. And then going back to the price of oil coming 
down. How long will it take -- are you in FIFO, first of all? 
How long will it take for you to benefit from those costs? I 
know that the intermediary has to come down as well, but 
it sounds as though they may be. And so let's say that you 
benefit from it in a 90 to 120 days, as Jay mentioned. Will 
you, at that point, have to give a price?”

Case Study: What Happened Last Time Oil 
Crashed To WD-40’s Margins


The magnitude of oil’s decline during the last crisis is comparable from a percentage decline of approximately 70%. We 
see that it took until Q3 for the Company to say that oil benefited gross margin by 200bps, and that was a full year after 


oil peaked over $140/bbl. in July 2008. What’s also important to realize is that WD-40 had ~40 days of inventory 
outstanding then vs. ~80 today. As a result, we believe it will take even longer for it to realize the full benefit of lower oil.


Oil Drop Magnitude MUCH Larger In 2008-09

Management Comments On Oil


“If oil stays down and we get the conversion, given that 
and the savings that we anticipate from the improved 
manufacturing process from the capital equipment we 
have invested on our package lines to improve line speed 
from smart straw, all of those things aligned, we should 
see some sort of at least stabilization and improvement in 
our gross margin, particularly in the second quarter.”
