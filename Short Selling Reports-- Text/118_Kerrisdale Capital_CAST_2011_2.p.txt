ChinaCast: Chinese Filings Reveal Serious Red Flags
Nov. 29, 2011 6:34 AM ET35 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


We have written a 40-page report where we present compelling evidence that ChinaCast
Education Corporation (OTCPK:CAST) has materially misrepresented itself in its SEC
financial statements. Our full report is available by clicking here (.pdf).


We have also written a letter to the company's auditors discussing our findings. The letter
is available here (.pdf).


ChinaCast has long occupied a special place within the U.S.-listed Chinese smallcap
universe. As fraud after fraud has been exposed within this sector, CAST has been upheld
as the baby thrown out with the bathwater, the one shining beacon within a sea of scams.


As such, we decided to conduct deep-level diligence on CAST, to determine whether the
perceptions match reality. Our findings have led us to conclude that CAST is beset by a
long list of red flags. Based on our evidence, we believe CAST has materially
misrepresented itself in its SEC financial statements. We have shared our findings with
senior partners at Deloitte LLP, and urge them to consider our evidence when conducting
their audit for ChinaCast for the fiscal year 2011. We have also shared our report with the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ stock exchange.


Below we summarize certain red flags we found during our diligence on ChinaCast.


SAIC Filings report that the ELG business is substantially smaller than what is
claimed by CAST in SEC Filings


We acquired the SAIC financial statements for ChinaCast Li Xiang Co., Ltd. ("CCLX") and
ChinaCast Technology (Shanghai) Ltd. ("CCT Shanghai"), which are the main operating
subsidiaries that comprise the ELG segment. ELG accounted for 66% of the Company's
gross profit in 2010 and for 100% of the company's gross profit prior to CAST's first brick-
and-mortar college acquisition in 2008.


According to SAIC filings, the subsidiary accounting for the ELG segment generated
revenue of less than half of that reported in SEC filings from 2007 to 2009. In our report,
we include photocopies of the annual inspection reports, as well as signed attestations by
the subsidiaries' legal representatives attesting that the information in the SAIC filings is
valid and accurate.

Of particular relevance to us are the 2008 and 2009 Annual Inspection Reports.
Companies in China undergo annual inspections by their local branches of the
Administration for Industry and Commerce. Included within these annual inspection
reports are financial statements, as well as attestations by the companies' legal
representatives that the contents of the Annual Inspection Reports are accurate and valid.


Below are links to photocopies of the 2008 and 2009 CCLX annual inspection reports, as
well as English translations.

In these documents, we see full balance sheets and income statements for fiscal years
2007, 2008 and 2009.


Below is a table summarizing the revenue and profit reported by CCLX in 2007, 2008 and
2009 (we use average annual exchange rates):  


As we can see here, CCLX reported USD $10m, $14m and $6m of revenue in each of
2007, 2008 and 2009 in its SAIC filings to the Shanghai branch of the Administration for
Industry and Commerce. In contrast, ChinaCast reported $25m, $29m and $29m for its
ELG segment according to its SEC filings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.

We can see that CCLX operates a profitable operation, according to SAIC filings, and
posts revenue that is materially higher than other Chinese companies we have previously
alleged to be fraudulent, such as China Education Alliance (CEU) and Advanced Battery
Technologies (OTCPK:ABAT). Nevertheless, according to SAIC filings, ChinaCast's ELG
revenue is less than half of what it claims in SEC filings. According to 2009 SAIC financial
statements, the CCLX annual revenue reported in China was less than one-fifth of the
SEC revenue reported by ELG.


CCLX's annual inspection reports include attestations by its legal representative that the
information included in the annual inspection report is accurate and valid. Below we paste
the relevant section from the 2008 annual inspection report, as well as an English
translation:


On the left, we have pasted the original Chinese photocopy of the attestation, while on the
right we have provided an English translation of the primary document. Note that in the
signature line, we see the name of Yin Jianping, who is currently the Vice Chairman of
ChinaCast and has been previously described as "responsible for [ChinaCast's] overall
management, operations and strategic direction" (see here). Mr. Yin was the legal
representative of CCLX prior to 2010.


We have also acquired historical SAIC filings for subsidiaries ChinaCast Co. Ltd. ("CCL")
and ChinaCast Tecnology (Shanghai) Ltd. ("CCT Shanghai"), and provide them below.

CCL SAIC Filings and Annual Inspection Reports (Chinese) (.pdf)


CCL SAIC Filings and Annual Inspection Reports (English Translation) (.pdf)


Based on our reading of the company's SEC filings, CCL is not consolidated into the
company's SEC financial statements and CCT Shanghai is supposed to be a non-
operational shell whose revenue is merely the profit generated by CCLX. Nevertheless, an
examination of the annual inspection reports of CCL and CCT Shanghai will demonstrate
that even if the revenue of all entities were added together, the combined revenue would
still fall substantially short of what the company reports for the ELG segment in its SEC
filings.


Misappropriated Funds During College Acquisitions


Beginning in 2008, ChinaCast launched an expansion into brick-and-mortar colleges and
universities in an effort to broaden its asset base within the growing Chinese education
sector.


On April 11, 2008 and September 17, 2009, the company acquired The Foreign Trade and
Business College of Chongqing Normal University. On October 5, 2009, CAST acquired
Lijiang College of Guangxi Normal University. On August 23, 2010, CAST acquired Hubei
Industrial University Business College (HIUBC). These three brick-and-mortar universities
comprise the Traditional University Group ("TUG") segment of ChinaCast.


Numerous red flags were highlighted about these acquisitions in a series of six research
reports published by OLP Global LLC. As of our report's publication date, these six reports
can be found on the internet by typing the words "OLP global chinacast mailchimp" into
Google.


We were impressed by the depth of diligence conducted by OLP and recommend all
parties interested in ChinaCast acquire and read these reports.


The dates and titles of the report were as follows:

We highlight the two transactions that concerned us the most.


Allegations Regarding Foreign Trade and Business College of Chongqing Normal
University


The company announced in SEC filings that it acquired a business college in 2008 for
RMB 480 million. Yet, Chinese filings show that CAST paid only RMB 165 million for the
asset. We question what happened to the remaining RMB 315 million, and whether it was
misappropriated by insiders.

5/23/2018 ChinaCast: Chinese Filings Reveal Serious Red Flags - ChinaCast Education Corp. (OTCMKTS:CAST) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/310684-chinacast-chinese-filings-reveal-serious-red-flags 6/19


On April 11, 2008, the company acquired an 80% stake in the Foreign Trade & Business
College of Chongqing Normal University ("FTBC Acquisition"). The company reported in
SEC filings that it paid RMB 480 million for the acquisition. However, SAIC filings show
that CAST's wholly owned subsidiary Yupei Training Information Technology Co., Ltd. paid
only RMB 165 million for the asset. When research firm OLP Global demonstrated this in
a report, the company responded that the remaining amounts were paid by CCT
Shanghai. However, the 2008 SAIC filings for CCT Shanghai report that no funds were
paid by CCT Shanghai for the FTBC Acquisition, and that cash paid for acquisitions from
CCT Shanghai was negligible in 2008. When OLP explained this in a subsequent report,
CAST did not reply.


We provide links to the relevant source documents in our longer report.


Allegations regarding Lijiang College


CAST appears to have overpaid for its 2009 acquisition of Lijiang College by at least RMB
113 million, based on information from SAIC filings as well as documents filed with
Chinese securities regulators that are easily accessible on the internet. We question
whether the RMB 113 million was misappropriated during the acquisition.


For the acquisition of Lijiang College of Guangxi Normal University in October 2009,
ChinaCast disclosed in SEC filings that it would pay a total consideration of RMB 365
million, of which RMB 295 million was paid in 2009 and the remaining contingent
consideration would be paid in 2010. But Shanghai Xijiu Information Technology Co. Ltd.
("Xijiu"), the entity from which CAST purchased Lijiang, had only paid RMB 182 million to
acquire Lijiang several weeks earlier, according to Chinese filings. Furthermore, Xijiu was
set up by a former CAST employee and its 100% owner at the time of the acquisition was
a farmer from Fujian province who did not graduate high school. It strikes us as unlikely
that an under-educated farmer was the ultimate recipient of the proceeds from the
acquisition of Lijiang College. The question emerges whether this acquisition was used to
misappropriate funds during the acquisition of Lijiang College.


In our longer report, we provide source documents detailing the acquisition of Lijiang
College by Xijiu from its sellers Wuhan Humanwell Hi-Tech Industry Co., Ltd.
("Humanwell"), a publicly listed company on the Shanghai Stock Exchange with the ticker
600079, and Wuhan Hengjiantong, a private company. Through Chinese filings, including
documents submitted by Wuhan Humanwell to the Shanghai Securities Exchange that are
publicly accessible to anyone who visits here, as well as the SAIC filings of Xijiu, we can
see that Xijiu purchased Lijiang College for only RMB 182 million.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/310684-chinacast-chinese-filings-reveal-serious-red-flags 7/19


Yet while Xijiu paid RMB 182 million to acquire Lijiang College, ChinaCast paid RMB 295
million to acquire Xijiu. The RMB 113 million difference went to Xie Jiqing, a farmer from
Fujian province. Let's not forget that Xijiu is an entity set up by a former CAST employee,
and that Xijiu had purchased Lijiang College only a few weeks before CAST purchased it
from Xijiu.


What happened to the RMB 113 million difference between the price paid by CAST and
the price paid by Xijiu for Lijiang College? Who exactly is this farmer who happened to
gain control of a British Virgin Islands-based entity that purchased a college in China and
then flipped it for a quick RMB 113 million profit to ChinaCast? Did the RMB 113 million
end up in his bank account, or in someone else's?


Unnecessary Capital Raises


When we come across U.S.-listed Chinese companies exhibiting red flags, such as
mismatching SAIC financial information and suspicious acquisition transactions, we
examine whether the companies have conducted unnecessary capital raises at low
valuations.


ChinaCast has completed several secondary public offerings. They also conspicuously
diluted their outstanding shares in 2008 by voluntarily reducing the strike price of their
legacy SPAC warrants in order to raise $15 million from three hedge funds.


The first secondary public offering was announced on September 26, 2008. The company
raised $11.1 million of capital through a secondary equity offering arranged by Roth
Capital. Roth also received warrants in addition to their customary underwriting fee. The
offering was priced at an 18% discount to the closing price of CAST stock on the day prior
to the announcement, and a 31% discount to the average closing price of CAST stock for
the 30 days prior to the announcement. These are large discounts.


At the time of the capital raise, the company was trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.9x
and a P/E ratio of less than 10x. These were low multiples for a company that was
supposedly growing through the recession unfazed (non-acquisition-related gross profit
increased 25% from FY 2007 to FY 2008).


At the time of the capital raise, the company had $57 million of cash on the balance sheet,
and according to its SEC financial statements, the company generated $11 million and
$31 million of cash flow from operations in 2007 and 2008, respectively. According to the
offering prospectus, the proceeds would be used to "fund product development, corporate
5/23/2018 ChinaCast: Chinese Filings Reveal Serious Red Flags - ChinaCast Education Corp. (OTCMKTS:CAST) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/310684-chinacast-chinese-filings-reveal-serious-red-flags 8/19


growth and for other general corporate purposes." The offering was completed five
months after the completion of the FTBC 80% stake acquisition, and it would be nearly a
year before CAST announced its next college acquisition.


In our opinion, CAST's first secondary offering suffers from many of the red flags we have
seen in the past. The company raised cash from US investors despite reporting
substantial cash on the balance sheet, healthy operating cash flow and no immediate
need for the cash proceeds. Furthermore, the capital was raised while the company was
trading at a low valuation, and at a large discount to its prior 30-day trading average.


Chinacast's second public offering to US investors was announced on December 2, 2009.
The company raised $46.7 million in an offering arranged by Roth, Brean Murray and
Global Hunter. The offering was priced at a 6% discount to the closing price of CAST
stock on the day prior to the announcement, and a 4% discount to the average closing
price of CAST stock for the 30 days prior to the announcement.


At the time of the capital raise, the company was trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.3x
and a P/E ratio of 31x. These multiples and discounts were reasonable metrics at which to
raise capital (assuming, of course, that the EBITDA and EPS figures were accurate).


At the time of the capital raise, the company supposedly had $100 million of cash on the
balance sheet, and according to its SEC financial statements, the company generated $31
million and $20 million of cash flow from operations in 2008 and 2009, respectively.
According to the offering prospectus, the proceeds would be used "for working capital,
future acquisitions and general corporate purposes." The company had closed its Lijiang
College acquisition three months earlier, and therefore the company did not need the
capital for the Lijiang acquisition. The company announced the HIUBC acquisition in April
2010, four months after the capital raise, and the total spent on HIUBC according to SEC
filings was $66 million.


Again, this secondary capital raise struck us as unnecessary because the company
supposedly had $100 million of cash on its balance sheet for potential acquisitions, such
as the one of HIUBC announced several months later.


Lastly, in June and July of 2008, the company voluntarily reduced the strike price of its
warrants to allow several hedge funds to exercise their otherwise out-of-the-money
warrants. The company even issued additional shares to the hedge funds as part of the
warrant amendment. Press releases announcing these warrant amendments can be found
here and here.

5/23/2018 ChinaCast: Chinese Filings Reveal Serious Red Flags - ChinaCast Education Corp. (OTCMKTS:CAST) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/310684-chinacast-chinese-filings-reveal-serious-red-flags 9/19


To understand the nuances behind this action, which we consider highly dilutive and
essentially equivalent to a capital raise, it's important to provide some background.
ChinaCast was originally a Singapore-listed company that switched to a U.S. exchange by
being acquired by a U.S.-listed Special Purpose Acquisition Company ("SPAC") in
December 2006. This SPAC had warrants outstanding at the time of the 2006 acquisition
that were exercisable at $5.00 and expired in March 2009. In 2006 and 2007, no warrants
were exercised. In 2008, the Company's shares fell below $5, rendering the warrants out-
of-the-money.


Intuitively, the potential removal of CAST's large warrant overhang should have been a
boon and welcomed as a silver lining to the company at the time. The legacy SPAC
warrants would constitute more than a third of the company's outstanding shares upon
exercise, and if they expired worthless, the intrinsic value of the common shares would
increase substantially.


Yet, when the company's stock price declined below $5, ChinaCast voluntarily entered into
an agreement with three shareholders in June and July of 2008 to reduce the exercise
price to $4.25 in order to allow the hedge funds to exercise their warrants. Even more
conspicuously, ChinaCast issued additional restricted shares to entice the hedge funds to
participate in the transaction. In total, three hedge funds exercised 3.5 million warrants,
increasing the Company's outstanding shares by 13%. The 537,311 newly issued
restricted shares increased the share base by another 2%.


The warrant exercise resulted in $15 million of new cash being sent to CAST's bank
accounts.


This transaction effectively functioned as a capital raise. When the hedge funds exercised
their warrants, the company essentially raised $15m of new capital by issuing shares.


As with the two public offerings, let's examine the company's financial metrics at the time
of the warrant amendment. As of the day of the first announcement, the company was
trading at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.4x, pro forma for the acquisition of the 80% stake in
FTBC made two months prior to the warrant amendment.


As with the first capital raise, we note again the low company valuation at the time of the
warrant amendment.


Prior to the warrant exercise, the company supposedly had a cash balance of $57 million,
if we use the cash balance as of June 30, 2008. We question why the company needed
the cash receipts from the warrant exercise, and why they were willing to reduce the strike

price of the warrants when the company was trading at such a low valuation.


Conclusion


We believe that ChinaCast Education Corporation is misrepresenting itself in its SEC
financial statements. Based on our evidence, we believe that the actual underlying ELG
business has historically generated materially less revenue and profit than what the
company has reported in SEC filings. We also provide evidence that funds may have been
misappropriated during two of the company's college acquisitions; when faced with these
allegations, the company's unwillingness to publicly address these issues in a clear,
straightforward manner made us further concerned about CAST.


Below, we summarize some of the most serious red flags that we found when researching
ChinaCast:


The SAIC filings for the main operating subsidiary of the company's ELG
segment show materially less revenue and profit than what the company reports
in SEC filings. In our report, we include photocopies of the annual inspection reports,
as well as signed attestations by the subsidiaries' legal representatives attesting that
the information in the SAIC filings is valid and accurate.


SAIC filings provide evidence that shareholder funds were misappropriated
during the company's acquisition of a business college in 2008. The company
announced in SEC filings that it acquired a business college in 2008 for RMB 480
million. Yet Chinese filings show that CAST paid only RMB 165 million for the asset.
We question what happened to the remaining RMB 315 million, and whether it was
misappropriated by insiders.


Filings with Chinese Securities Regulators and the SAIC provide evidence that
funds were misappropriated during the acquisition of another college in 2009.
During CAST's 2009 acquisition of Lijiang College, Chinese filings show that CAST
paid at least RMB 113 million more than what the sellers of the college sold it for. The
RMB 113 million difference appears to have been pocketed by a farmer from Fujian
province through an intermediary holding company previously set up by CAST. We
question whether the RMB 113 million was misappropriated during the acquisition. We
are furthermore concerned by CAST's unwillingness to directly address these specific
allegations in a public manner when it had the opportunity to do so.

Comments (35)


The company has repeatedly raised cash through secondary equity offerings
and unnecessary warrant amendments, despite having a large amount of cash
on its balance sheet. In multiple situations, capital was effectively raised at low
valuations, diluting shareholders in what we believe would be an irrational manner if
the company's SEC financial statements were accurate.


We urge officials at Deloitte, NASDAQ and the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review our report. In our opinion, CAST is providing misleading financial information to one
set of regulators, given that SEC and SAIC financial statements diverge by a material
disparity. We believe it is the American regulators and investing public that are being
misled.

Some of that money probably went to a special off-the-books expense account called "bribes, gifts, and
entertainment". The rest into the pockets (or real estate investments) of the company's directors. Just a wild guess
though...

I agree with your synopsis and while there aren't any shares available for shorting, short-sellers have to be somewhat
worried about the pending buyout "take-private" offer. It hasn't yet been disclosed who made the offer and at what
price, but I suspect it was coming from Ned Sherwood. Now what bothers me about this is the fact that Ned Sherwood
was the board of director that bought over $20 million worth of stock on the open market at much higher prices and
was then kicked off the board by mnagement. Why ? LOL. What stinks further is the fact that the company came out
and said they would be ceasing their share repurchase, claiming they couldn't get money out of the country. Total B.S.
IMO. A Rochdale securities specialist then did a conference on Chinese companies and stated that if a company tells

you they can't get money out of the country, it's definitely a red flag since it's rather easy to get money out of the
country when going through the proper procedures. Personally, I think Ned Sherwood is behind the offer and did he
make the offer for the purpose of unloading his $20 million (plus) stake in the company, not really intending to buyout
the company ? Just speculation, but it would make sense, especially since the Chinese can't be trusted for squat.

Out of the money DEC puts were being heavily bought right after buyout talks were announced. Does this make
sense in light of recent insider open market purchases at considerably higher prices ? Only if the PUT buyers were
preparing a hit piece to manipulate the price of the stock down.

Or if insiders knew the buyout and the company's sheets were a sham.

Thanks for the article, I appreciate the analysis

To be honest this is all old news and already for most part rebutted by the company.


Maybe your goal is to get the stock cheaply before the PE-deal emerges.

Night Heron, Contributor
Very convincing analysis. So what's your opinion of the buyout offer publicized on 11/15?


29 Nov 2011, 11:39 PM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks night_heron. That's obviously a very good question.


At this point in time, the information related to the purported buyout offer has been very limited. The
Company's press release, available at http://bit.ly/vOh4TG, does not provide enough information for public
investors like us to form a sufficiently meaningful opinion.


So at this point in time, we're withholding our opinion on the supposed buyout offer until more information
emerges.

interesting tweet read a bit ago, warrants my comment and further look.


first observation.


who would be interested in seeing kerrisdale trading records.


15 days ago company said got bid to go private. 
takes about 15 days to put together a hit piece 
hit piece released saying not much.  
Kerrisdale covers short saving themselves from huge loss when company provides further detail on going private.


i would have to guess this will warrant a further look by the law.


01 Dec 2011, 11:36 AM

its entertaining that i asked alfred little and chrissy wu the same questions a while back about their intentions, timing
of trades, front running of market moving information and manipulation of data to enable them to profit at the expense
of others.


if what you are doing is illegal than why can't you answer my question above about the timing of the report and what
you put in the report? you conveniently avoided my question but responded to another - that just cries guilty in my
eyes.


Barry Minkow thought he was flying high for awhile, but that didn't last. So did Raj, now he is pleading for forgiveness
to stay out jail next to madoff.

Kerrisdale - lets make it simple.


is it legal to do what you do? yes or no?

do you short stocks, write reports and then cover your short positions after disseminating a report that contains
statements that if released would have a material effect on the stock price? if not why would you go through the effort
and take a short position.


clearly upon "learning" of the information in your report, which you claim is significantly different than what's in the
public filings filed with the SEC you made the decision to short the stock.


then your write a report containing such information.


then you release the report.


then the information has a material effect on the stock price.


would that information be considered material information which differs from the publicly available information?


02 Dec 2011, 11:19 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  At the end of the article, we write: "Please read our full disclaimer at the end of our report
here (.pdf)." That full disclaimer, which comprises two pages, provides the disclosures necessary regarding
our financial interest and trading.


We have external counsel who have provided legal advice regarding disclosures that we need to make about
our securities positions with respect to companies that we write about. We believe we have made those
necessary disclosures.


02 Dec 2011, 11:37 AM


Arthur_Big
thank you for the response.


so your disclaim that you manipulate stocks and trade on material non public information or make up information? not
sure disclaimers protect you from breaking the law.


question - if i tell someone that i robbed a bank does that make it legal?


02 Dec 2011, 11:43 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Based on our understanding of the law, we don't commit any illegal acts when we take a
short position in a stock and write an article alleging that the company has misrepresented itself in its SEC
financial statements, as long as that article discloses our financial interest in the security described therein.


02 Dec 2011, 04:41 PM

also just in case you are not familiar with US law. ignorance is not a defense.


material information or false information.

who advises you on the law - bert and ernie?


would this information that you are disclosing have a material effect on the stock price in your opinion?


key word material. no seriously who is your lawyer? thats really funny that they advised you on that.


good luck using a disclaimer as your defense.


02 Dec 2011, 04:54 PM

Arthur Big can you sue Kerrisdale? You've been commenting on a messageboard for 8 months alrdy and it's
having no effect. Muddy Waters also came out with a hit piece last week. I think a lawsuit has a bigger effect
otherwise they will keep writing hit pieces.


02 Dec 2011, 06:50 PM


Arthur_Big
it takes a while for the law to act, but they will. i am not going to sue because i have not lost anything in these stocks. i
believe 70% of these guys are getting sued though.


after tre.to came out with their independent report you don't think john paulsen is going to use muddy waters for
manipulation? i am pretty sure they will.


prediction 1 year from now  
- al little alias will be in jail  
- carson block will be in jail and will be the running joke of manipulating markets 
- kerrisdale will be in jail 
- geo will be in jail 
- glaucus will be in jail 
- absaroka will be in jail

Good for Kerrisdale if they can profit on the short side from their research. Obviously those that sold on the hit piece
were just gambling and didn't execute their own DD. That's their tough luck.


CAST fraudulently stated that they suspended the share buyback, claiming they couldn't get money out of the country.
Anyone who has a clue whatsoever knows that statement is total B.S.


03 Dec 2011, 10:27 AM


Arthur_Big
keep drinking the Kool aid.


can you admit that what kerrisdale did is no different than a pump and dump? you claim they profited from their report.
profited from the effect a negative report caused - meaning they issued a report to move the market to profit. I think
thats illegal.


funny that you are an expert on the tre.to investigation. i assume you are one of those that say harbin was a bad
situation for shareholders.


also funny you claim "fraudulent" on CAST argument. there are certain businesses that can move money out of china
based on what we learned over last few month but not sure thats across the board. your use of the word fraud is
entertaining though.


i surely wouldn't want to be in kerrisdales shoes as they are soon to be state issued in my opinion.


03 Dec 2011, 04:16 PM


JoeNatural, Contributor
Arthur, if I were Kerrisdale and had their on-the-ground resources in China, I'd already be working on my next
hit piece. There's so much fraud in China, I can't see straight. That said, it's tough to judge how to play many
of these stocks, as HRBN got bought out even though their land deal was a huge fraud. Fraud doesn't
necessarily mean a death sentence.


05 Dec 2011, 12:40 PM


bloodyzbub
Hey Sahm, how'd this short play work out for you? 
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Nice to see you take one in the pants, but I tell you what, go ahead and jump back over and short GURE again...we
should be getting a tender offer soon. Everything you publish is garbage and a blatant attempt to negatively/materially
effect a stock that you've shorted.


But here's the good news, everything I stated above is based on my research/experience of your firms activity and is
expressly my opinion. I currently hold a LONNNGGG position in GURE. Do you know what the difference is between
a jail cell holding an uneducated child rapist and that of a cell holding a Yale graduate? 
NOTHING.

Alpha Vulture, Contributor
When I look at http://yhoo.it/tmn8JM I see that insiders have been buying significant amounts of stock, for a total of
roughly 30M. That seems to be a very significant amount compared to the amount of money they got by issuing
shares/lowering the strike of warrants. How does this fit in a fraud thesis?


08 Dec 2011, 11:32 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for the comment. Broadly speaking, just because there are insider purchases does
not mean that a company is not committing fraud, in my opinion. We've seen numerous instances where
there have been insider purchases at companies that we believe are misrepresenting themselves in their
SEC financial statements. China Marine Food, for instance, announced insider purchases after allegations
regarding their dubious Xianghe acquisition were published. The same occurred at SkyPeople Fruit Juice
following the Absaroka report.


A lot of the buying shown on your link are by Fir Tree and Ned Sherwood, both of whom have been involved
with the company since well before the 2010 wave of Chinese fraud reports.


There's no doubt that we and Fir Tree/Ned Sherwood strongly disagree on whether CAST is an appropriate
long or short. They trust the company's numbers. We, on the other hand, do not and explain our reasons in
our lengthy report. We don't think that Fir Tree and Sherwood had properly done their homework on the stock.
Furthermore, we don't think that they're genuine insiders and are rather outside investors who simply talk to
management a lot. If there was fraud being committed at the company, I don't think that they'd be privy to it.


As for the true insider purchases, again, these insider purchases don't explain why some farmer pocketed
millions of dollars during the Lijiang college acquisition or why the ELG segment has SAIC financials that are
materially lower than what the company reports in its SEC filings.

A Sino Forest reference from Arthur Big?


You know they are delaying 3rd quarter results and are defaulting on their debt?


Clearly you didn't read the independant report or process memorandum as it was more incriminating than the MW
report.


At this point the auditors, government, institutional investors, and bondholders agree with Carson Block.


Kerrisdale or anybody else does no wrongdoing when they short a stock and write a report about it, unless you can
prove that they intentionally wrote wrong misinformation in the report. Out of all your comments you've never once
pointed out an inaccuracy. So you add no value to any discussions.

if what you are saying that they never had inaccuracies than you are stating they are trading on material non public
information?


I think i would rather have the Minkow than the Raj.

Arthur_Big
If  
1) absaroka was in congressman  
2) their information was actually right


then maybe what they do would be legal. Instead they are just manipulating markets. funny they claim they are
actually just trading on material non public information than disseminating it in a research report to move the market.
not sure which one is the lesser of two evils in the eye of the law.


27 Dec 2011, 06:16 AM

its amusing that the Chinese authorities are investigating manipulation by hit piece authors before the US authorities.
Great thing about a communist country, when you want something done you do it. The US legal system here takes
months if not years.....
