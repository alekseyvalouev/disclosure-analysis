CSKI’s Earnings Miss and Altered Patent Claims


Posted on March 17, 2010 by Asensio.com


Today China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) reported fourth


quarter and fiscal year 2009 earnings.


asensio.com previously reported on a controversy surrounding


CSKI’s patents – namely, that CSKI did not have any patents, though


it claimed to have patents worth $15 million – and a lawsuit filed


against CSKI’s auditor for securities fraud related to the patent


claims.


CSKI’s 2009 10-K shows a significant difference in its accounting of


patent values. The audited financial statements state, “Historically,


we included our proprietary technologies and SFDA licenses for


drug batch numbers under the category of patents. We now believe


it is more accurate to categorize such IP in separate categories.” The


breakdown of intangible assets thus no longer includes any line-


item for “patents.” Meanwhile, the total intangible assets have


increased approximately 58% to $25.1 million over the period from


December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009.


While CSKI claimed “7 patents” in its 2008 10-K, CSKI’s 2009 10-K


states, “As of the date of this filing, we own two registered patents


for product packaging. As of December 31, 2009, these patents have


nominal carrying values.”


CSKI’s net income was below the company’s guidance given in its


November 2009 earnings release. Net income for 2009 was


approximately $34 million, while CSKI had guided for net income of


$39 million.
