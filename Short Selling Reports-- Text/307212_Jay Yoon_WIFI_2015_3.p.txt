Boingo	Wireless:	Share	Dilution	Likely	Given	Recent	Shelf	Filing
Sep.	17,	2015	9:30	AM	ET5	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


Boingo	recently	filed	an	S-3	on	September	11th.


This	shelf	registration	for	$125mm	of	securities	strongly	indicates	that	a	secondary
offering	may	soon	occur.


I	recently	spoke	with	Peter	Hovenier,	the	CFO	of	Boingo.	I	came	away	from	this
conversation	with	an	increased	conviction	in	my	short	thesis.


Boingo's	excessive	and	misguided	executive	compensation	plan	is	another	point	of
concern.


In	August,	I	published	a	couple	of	articles	on	SA	which	outlined	my	short	thesis	on	Boingo
Wireless	(TICKER:	WIFI)	("Boingo"	or	the	"Company").	In	my	reports	(found	here	and
here),	I	argued	that	Boingo's	highly	unprofitable	DAS	strategy	and	deteriorating	Retail
subscriber	base	would	lead	to	severe	liquidity	problems	for	the	Company	in	the	near
future.	Since	publishing	these	articles,	I	have	uncovered	additional	information	which
further	support	my	bearish	views	on	the	Company.	This	additional	information	will	be
discussed	in	the	sections	below.	In	the	first	section,	I	will	discuss	Boingo's	recent	shelf
filing	which	strongly	indicates	that	the	Company	will	soon	raise	capital	via	a	secondary
offering.	Given	the	Company's	large	ongoing	cash	burn,	it	is	likely	that	Boingo	will	try	to
raise	a	significant	amount	of	cash	and,	in	turn,	dilute	current	shareholders	by	a	significant
amount.	In	the	second	section,	I	will	provide	my	key	takeaways	from	a	recent	conversation
that	I	had	with	Peter	Hovenier,	the	CFO	of	Boingo	Wireless.	On	August	25th,	I	had	the
opportunity	to	speak	with	Mr.	Hovenier	about	Boingo's	business.	As	I	will	discuss	in	detail,
the	information	that	Mr.	Hovenier	provided	to	me	during	our	conversation	strengthened
many	of	the	key	points	of	my	short	thesis.	Finally,	to	conclude	this	article,	I	will	discuss
how	the	Company's	excessive	and	misguided	executive	compensation	plan	may	have	led
to	management's	decision	to	pursue	an	unprofitable	business	strategy.	It	appears	that	the
Company's	current	executive	compensation	plan	incentivizes	management	to	grow

revenue	with	no	regard	for	profitability.	This	misalignment	between	executive
compensation	and	business	performance	provides	yet	another	reason	for	Boingo
investors	to	sell	their	shares.


Recent	Shelf	Filing	Has	Negative	Implications	For	Boingo	Shareholders


On	September	11th,	Boingo	filed	a	shelf	registration	(form	S-3)	which	gives	them	the
ability	to	issue	up	to	$125mm	in	new	securities.	The	Company	stated	in	its	prospectus	that
proceeds	from	the	sale	of	new	securities	would	be	for	general	corporate	purposes.	In	my
first	article	on	Boingo,	I	stated	that	the	Company	would	likely	have	to	raise	a	significant
amount	of	cash	in	order	to	fund	their	significant	ongoing	cash	burn.	The	filing	of	this	S-3	is
a	strong	indication	that	this	prediction	will	soon	prove	to	be	correct.	In	my	opinion,	the	fact
that	the	Company	may	soon	raise	a	large	amount	of	capital	is	a	negative	development	for
Boingo	shareholders.	Given	the	Company's	weak	FCF	position	and	substantial	existing
liabilities,	it	is	likely	that	Boingo	will	raise	capital	by	issuing	new	shares	rather	than	issuing
debt.	As	a	result,	existing	shareholders	may	soon	find	their	ownership	in	Boingo	diluted	by
a	significant	amount.


This	potential	capital	raise	supports	my	assertion	that	Boingo	is	in	a	very	precarious	and
challenged	financial	position.	As	I	mentioned	in	my	prior	articles,	the	Company	has	burned
through	cash	at	a	rapid	pace.	From	Q4	2011	-	Q2	2015,	the	Company's	net	cash	position
has	decreased	from	$94.4mm	to	just	$7.5mm.	Recently,	Boingo's	net	losses	have
accelerated	as	the	Company	has	signed	an	increasing	number	of	DAS	contracts.	These
contracts	boost	cash	flow	in	the	short-term	but	are	highly	unprofitable	over	the	long-term.
As	a	result,	the	Company	now	finds	itself	in	a	deep	financial	hole.	For	example,	if	the	one-
time	cash	infusions	received	from	DAS	buildouts	are	excluded,	the	Company	would	have
generated	a	FCF	loss	of	$37.6mm	during	the	first	six	months	of	FY	2015.	This	represents
an	annualized	FCF	loss	of	over	$75mm.	Unless	management	shifts	its	business	strategy
and	stops	signing	highly	unprofitable	DAS	deals,	the	Company	will	need	to	continually
raise	new	capital	in	order	to	keep	the	business	afloat.	Unfortunately,	it	appears	that
management	has	no	intention	of	changing	its	strategy.	Thus,	although	a	capital	raise
would	sustain	Boingo's	business	over	the	short-term,	I	believe	that	management's
unprofitable	DAS	deals	will	eventually	lead	to	insolvency	for	the	Company.


Key	Takeaways	From	My	Conversation	With	Boingo's	CFO


On	August	25th,	I	had	the	opportunity	to	speak	with	Peter	Hovenier,	the	CFO	of	Boingo.
Before	discussing	the	details	of	our	conversation,	I	would	first	like	to	thank	Mr.	Hovenier
for	taking	the	time	to	provide	me	with	his	views	on	the	Company's	business	strategy.	It	is

rare	for	members	of	management	to	reach	out	and	interact	with	individuals	who	are	short
their	stock	and	actively	publishing	bearish	research.	With	that	said,	my	conversation	with
Mr.	Hovenier	did	little	to	change	my	opinion	that	Boingo	has	a	severely	flawed	and
unprofitable	business	strategy.	In	fact,	the	additional	information	that	Mr.	Hovenier
divulged	actually	strengthened	some	of	the	key	points	of	my	short	thesis.


For	example,	during	our	conversation,	Mr.	Hovenier	provided	a	breakdown	of	the	DAS
segment's	gross	margins.	He	stated	that	DAS	buildout	revenue	carries	a	gross	margin	of
~25%.	In	regards	to	DAS	access	gross	margin,	he	was	a	bit	less	direct.	Mr.	Hovenier
stated	that	DAS	access	gross	margins	were	~25%	for	contracts	signed	prior	to	FY	2013
(like	the	Dallas	Love	Field	contract).	On	the	other	hand,	for	contracts	signed	during	and
after	FY	2013,	he	stated	that	DAS	access	gross	margins	were	much	higher	at	an	average
of	~70%.	Assuming	that	it	takes	approximately	one	year	to	deploy	a	DAS	system	after
signing	a	contract,	I	estimate	that	DAS	access	gross	margins	are	~25%	for	any	nodes
deployed	prior	to	FY	2014	and	~70%	for	any	nodes	deployed	during	and	after	FY	2014.
As	of	Q2	2015,	Boingo	had	deployed	a	total	of	9,500	nodes.	6,300	or	66%	of	these	nodes
were	deployed	prior	to	FY	2014,	while	the	remaining	3,200	nodes	or	34%	were	deployed
during	and	after	FY	2014.	Thus,	on	a	blended	basis,	I	estimate	that	DAS	access	gross
margin	is	currently	~40%	(25%	pre-FY	2014	gross	margin	*	66%	+	70%	post-FY	2014
gross	margin	*	34%).	Putting	it	all	together,	based	on	the	information	provided	by	Mr.
Hovenier,	I	have	provided	below	my	estimate	of	Boingo's	combined	DAS	gross	margin:


As	shown	above,	based	on	information	disclosed	by	Mr.	Hovenier,	I	estimate	Boingo's
consolidated	DAS	gross	margin	is	currently	~31%.	By	comparison,	in	my	initial	article	on
Boingo,	I	estimated	consolidated	DAS	gross	margin	was	between	29%	-	43%.	Thus,	my
initial	estimate	of	the	DAS	segment's	gross	margin	(29%	-	43%)	appears	to	be	fairly
accurate	as	31%	falls	within	the	lower-end	of	this	range.	More	importantly,	the	DAS
segment's	relatively	low	gross	margin	of	31%	provides	strong	support	for	my	assertion
that	the	DAS	segment	is	highly	unprofitable.	In	the	table	below,	I	have	provided	my	current
estimate	for	the	DAS	segment's	profitability	assuming	a	31%	gross	margin.	Note	that	I
included	a	similar	table	in	my	initial	article	on	Boingo.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3514306-boingo-wireless-share-dilution-likely-given-recent-shelf-filing 4/8


The	assumptions	that	I	used	to	estimate	the	DAS	segment's	annualized	1H	2015	results
are	as	follows:


1.	Results	were	annualized	by	multiplying	the	revenue	and	expense	items	by	2.
2.	Revenue:	Assumed	60%	buildout	revenue	/	40%	access	revenue	split	as	provided	by
management	during	their	Q2	2015	earnings	call.


3.	Gross	Margin	-	Buildout:	25%	as	per	my	discussion	with	Mr.	Hovenier.
4.	Gross	Margin	-	Access:	40%	as	per	my	discussion	with	Mr.	Hovenier.
5.	Total	Operating	Expenses:	Total	DAS	revenue	accounted	for	34%	of	Boingo's	total
revenue	in	1H	2015.	Thus,	I	assumed	DAS	accounted	for	34%	of	all	operating
expenses	(network	operations,	development	&	technology,	S&M	and	G&A	expenses)
in	1H	2015.


The	above	table	appears	to	confirm	my	claim	that	the	Company	is	signing	uneconomical
DAS	contracts.	Assuming	consolidated	DAS	gross	margin	of	31%,	I	estimate	that	the	DAS
segment	generated	a	net	operating	loss	of	$17.7mm.	Thus,	by	providing	a	breakout	of
DAS	gross	margins,	Mr.	Hovenier	has	indirectly	strengthened	one	of	the	key	points	of	my
short	thesis.


In	addition	to	discussing	the	DAS	business,	Mr.	Hovenier	also	provided	his	views	on	the
Company's	overall	cash	flow	situation.	According	to	Mr.	Hovenier,	excluding	upfront	DAS
buildout	payments,	Boingo	is	currently	generating	a	FCF	loss	of	~$20mm	every	six
months.	This	represents	a	total	FCF	loss	of	~$40mm	on	an	annualized	basis.	Based	on
the	first	six	months	of	FY	2015,	excluding	net	cash	from	DAS	buildouts,	the	Company
actually	generated	an	annualized	FCF	loss	of	over	$75mm.	Thus,	I	believe	Mr.	Hovenier	is

understating	the	annual	cash	burn	of	Boingo's	business.	That	being	said,	by	stating	that
the	Company's	annual	FCF	loss	would	be	~$40mm	without	the	benefit	of	upfront	DAS
buildout	cash	infusions,	Mr.	Hovenier	basically	confirmed	/	acknowledged	that	the
business	is	in	a	very	precarious	position	from	a	FCF	perspective.	$40mm	of	annual	cash
burn	is	a	very	large	amount	relative	to	the	size	of	Boingo's	business.	On	top	of	this,	Mr.
Hovenier	also	confirmed	that	the	Company	has	deferred	a	significant	amount	of	capex
payments.	In	my	first	two	articles,	I	provided	the	following	table	which	shows	the	amount
of	unpaid	PP&E	liabilities	on	Boingo's	balance	sheet	as	of	Q4	2014	and	Q2	2015:


As	shown	in	the	table	above,	the	Company	deferred	$21.1mm	of	capex	payments	in	1H
2015.	In	total,	as	of	Q2	2015,	the	Company	has	$33.2mm	of	unpaid	PP&E	liabilities	which
will	have	to	be	paid	at	some	point	in	the	near	future.	Some	readers	on	SA	commented	that
this	capex	related	liability	was	a	non-cash	item	that	had	already	been	funded.	However,
Mr.	Hovenier	has	confirmed	that	this	is,	in	fact,	a	real	cash	liability	that	will	have	to	be	paid
by	the	Company.


In	summary,	my	conversation	with	Mr.	Hovenier	strengthened	many	of	the	key	points	of
my	short	thesis.	Given	the	relatively	low	DAS	gross	margin	figures	that	Mr.	Hovenier
disclosed,	my	claim	that	the	DAS	segment	is	highly	unprofitable	appears	to	be	accurate.
Mr.	Hovenier	also	confirmed	that,	excluding	one-time	DAS	buildout	cash	infusions,	the
Company	is	burning	a	significant	amount	of	cash	per	year	(over	$40mm).	Finally,	Mr.
Hovenier	also	confirmed	that	Boingo	has	significant	unpaid	capex	liabilities	in	excess	of
$33mm	which	will	have	to	be	paid	in	the	near	future.	Thus,	given	the	Company's	highly
unprofitable	DAS	business,	large	annual	cash	burn	and	significant	capex-related	liabilities,
it	comes	as	little	surprise	that	the	Company	needs	to	raise	new	capital	from	outside
investors.


Excessive	Management	Compensation	Is	Another	Point	of	Concern


Since	FY	2013,	Boingo	management	has	received	an	excessive	amount	of	stock-based
compensation.	For	example,	from	FY	2013	to	Q2	2015,	the	Company	awarded	a	total	of
3.72mm	restricted	stock	units	("RSUs")	to	its	employees.	The	vast	majority	of	these	RSUs
were	awarded	to	members	of	key	management.	RSUs	are	much	more	valuable	and
expensive	than	stock	options	because	there	is	no	strike	price	attached	to	an	RSU.	When

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3514306-boingo-wireless-share-dilution-likely-given-recent-shelf-filing 6/8


an	RSU	vests,	the	holder	of	the	RSU	will	receive	one	share	of	stock	without	having	to	pay
a	strike	price.	In	other	words,	the	value	of	an	RSU	is	equal	to	the	stock	price	on	the	day
that	the	RSU	vests.	By	contrast,	the	value	of	a	stock	option	is	equal	to	the	stock	price
minus	the	exercise	price.	If	an	option	has	an	exercise	price	of	$7	and	the	current	stock
price	is	$10,	then	the	option	has	a	value	of	just	$3	when	exercised.	From	this	comparison,
it	is	clear	to	see	why	RSUs	are	so	much	more	valuable	than	stock	options.


As	mentioned	in	the	prior	paragraph,	Boingo	has	awarded	a	total	of	3.72mm	RSUs	since
FY	2013.	At	the	current	stock	price	of	$7.95	(as	of	Sept	15th),	these	RSUs	grants	are
worth	~$29.5mm.	Over	80%	of	these	RSUs	were	granted	to	the	following	members	of
management	-	David	Hagan	(CEO),	Peter	Hovenier	(CFO),	Dawn	Callahan	(Chief
Marketing	Officer),	Nick	Hulse	(President)	and	Tom	Tracey	(Senior	VP	Operations).	This
means	that	~$24mm	(80%	*	$29.5mm)	of	RSUs	have	been	awarded	to	just	5	key
executives	over	the	past	two	and	a	half	years.	This	works	out	to	an	average	of	$1.9mm	in
stock-based	RSU	compensation	per	executive	per	year.	In	my	opinion,	this	is	simply	an
excessive	amount	of	management	compensation	relative	to	the	size	of	Boingo's	business.
Keep	in	mind	that	this	does	not	even	take	into	account	stock	option	grants,	base	salary
and	bonuses	that	these	executives	have	also	received	during	that	same	timeframe.


To	make	matters	worse,	80%	of	management's	RSU	vesting	and	bonus	payouts	are	tied
to	revenue-based	performance	targets.	For	example,	in	FY	2014,	the	vesting	of
management's	performance-based	RSUs	was	contingent	upon	the	Company	achieving
year-over-year	revenue	growth	of	at	least	7%.	The	problem	with	performance	targets
based	primarily	on	revenue	growth	is	that	it	can	reward	management	for	growing	revenue
at	the	expense	of	profitability.	Over	the	past	few	years,	this	is	exactly	what	has	occurred.
From	FY	2012	-	FY	2014,	Boingo's	GAAP	EPS	has	declined	from	$0.20	to	a	loss	of	$0.55.
Despite	the	sharp	decline	in	profitability,	management	received	~$24mm	in	RSU
compensation,	as	well	as	generous	bonus	payments.	This	misalignment	between	Boingo's
executive	compensation	incentives	and	shareholder	interests	is	a	significant	problem.	In
my	opinion,	revenue	growth	based	performance	targets	is	part	of	the	reason	why	Boingo's
management	has	pursued	its	current	DAS	strategy.	Even	though	the	Company	is	losing	a
significant	amount	of	money	on	its	DAS	contracts,	signing	these	contracts	allows
management	to	hit	its	RSU	and	bonus	performance	targets.	Overall,	the	Company's
misguided	and	excessive	executive	compensation	plan	is	another	significant	red	flag	that
should	concern	Boingo	investors.

Despite	Boingo's	recent	decline	in	share	price,	I	believe	that	the	Company	remains
significantly	overvalued.	Given	the	Company's	recent	shelf	filing	and	poor	FCF	generation,
it	appears	that	a	significant	secondary	offering	will	happen	over	the	next	few	months.	In
addition	to	this,	my	conversation	with	Boingo's	CFO	strengthened	my	conviction	in	many
of	the	key	points	of	my	short	thesis	(e.g.	unprofitable	DAS	business,	poor	FCF	generation,
significant	deferred	capex	liabilities).	Finally,	management's	excessive	compensation
structure	that	rewards	revenue	growth	with	little	regard	for	profitability	is	another	point	of
great	concern	for	investors.	Given	all	of	these	factors,	I	continue	to	believe	that	Boingo	is
a	tremendous	short	opportunity	at	the	current	share	price	level.

Ok	i	spent	a	few	minutes	on	this.	Jay	is	correct.	They	are	effectively	receiving	an	upfront	payment	from	the	facility	to
build	the	DAS	network.	They	then	use	that	cash	to	purchase	the	equipment	and	installation.	The	reason	they	need	the
125m	is	because	they	cannot	fund	the	expense	side	of	the	90m	in	deferred	revenue	that	they	have	already	been	paid
for.	So	100%	of	the	expense	related	to	it	is	coming	directly	out	of	the	business	so	~70m	as	a	total	asspull.	So	in	effect
it	is	debt	incurred	in	full	as	they	provide	the	service.	So	yes	their	balance	sheet	is	completely	upsidedown	due	to
accounting	and	cash	timing

Adam	s
To	add	to	that,	the	current	market	cap	is	~290m	When	they	issue	125m	in	debt,	say	80	is	already	committed
with	another	20m	in	debt	on	BS.	So	roughly	EV	is	now	190m.	Obviously	itll	take	them	a	year	or	so	to	burn	the
80m	tied	to	deferred	revenue.	That	puts	the	stock	at	$5.	Then	look	at	the	EBITDA	rate	of	about	28m	a	year.
That	puts	the	multiple	at	just	under	7x	which	is	fairly	generous.	I	tend	to	agree	with	your	short	thesis	fairly
strongly,	however	the	timing	may	drag	out	depending	on	borrowing	cost.
