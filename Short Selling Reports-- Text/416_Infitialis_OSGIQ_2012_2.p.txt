Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. - Why The Equity Is Worthless, Part
II
Nov. 29, 2012 7:40 AM ET45 comments
by: Infitialis


Following a collective discussion amongst Infitialis members we have decided to republish
our original report on Overseas Shipholding Group (OSGIQ.PK) with a revised model for
valuing the company that is more encompassing. Initially we had decided to work from the
June 30 figures in order to demonstrate how unlikely any equity recovery would be. In the
revised version we account for events reported subsequent to June 30 increasing the
cash balance for OSGIQ due to a draw down on a banking facility that was reported on
August 1.


Having decided to include subsequent events we felt it also necessary to include Charter
In obligations totaling $1.13 Billion (previously excluded for simplicity) as well as make
more realistic projections for Receivables and Inventories (whereas we previously chose
to treat the June 30 figures as reliable). Keep in mind that there may be significant
additional holes in the balance sheet that were not reflected as of June 30. Rarely does an
Audit Committee state publicly that financials previously disclosed should not be relied
upon without significant charges or discrepancies being uncovered upon a restatement.


We will now complete the same exercise and include the cash balance subsequent to
June 30 by relying on a press release issued on August 1, 2012 that discussed an
additional draw down. All things being equal we have also included liabilities such as
Charter-Ins and Construction Contracts which we chose to ignore for simplicity and as we
had originally felt would not be necessary to prove the lack of equity coverage. Finally in
order to prove just how worthless the equity is we will project the liabilities and assets
three separate times incorporating different variables reflecting a base, bull, and bear case
for both debt restructuring and asset recoveries. This sensitivity analysis confirms that
equity investors purchasing shares of OSGIQ today are not only playing with fire but are
literally burning their hard-earned capital by purchasing this worthless stub.

If equity investors want to be intellectually honest about including post June 30 assets
they must also be objective about including liabilities and encumbrances. In the table
above we have done just that including Charter-Ins and Construction Contracts. In this
revised report we will value the equity three separate times representing three different
scenarios (Base, Bear, Bull) for debt reduction and asset recovery.


In the base case table of tangible assets we now include the $343 million cash drawn in
July and disclosed in the August 1 press release. From this figure ($550 million) we
subtract $45.9 million equating to three months of losses for OSGIQ. All things being
equal and as we have made no additional impairment to the cash in the base case
(disregarding future losses while in bankruptcy and/or legal fees which are both
guaranteed) we impaired the receivables and inventories amounting to an unrealistic $273
million down to $224 million by simply excluding the "other receivables entry" which
amounted to $48.9 million.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1034851-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-why-the-equity-is-worthless-part-ii 3/15


Under our base case scenario, which completely disregards actual vessel values and
does not impair cash by any amount during bankruptcy, there exists a $3 million
deficiency when weighing the liabilities against the assets. Realistically this "base case"
is really the most optimistic case for OSGIQ equity holders but once again we stress that
this projection bears no connection to reality. Each month that bankruptcy drags on will
produce at least $15.3 million in negative cash flow for OSGIQ while legal and
administrative fees in bankruptcy will amount to additional millions of dollars
conservatively speaking.


Under our bull case scenario for (OSGIQ) we reduce the Charter In obligations by a
whopping 50%, unrealistically erasing over half a billion dollars in unsecured liabilities.
Though unrealistic, the logic employed in this calculation essentially disregarded all
charter in obligations past 2014. Ultimately this calculation will prove way too optimistic but
we decided to be very aggressive here in order to appease some readers who believe this
to be a likely scenario.


Under our bull case for asset recovery we assume that OSG will only burn $100 million in
cash while in bankruptcy. This unrealistic amount equates to only two quarters of negative
cash flow leaving no room for legal and administrative expenses. Moreover we value the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1034851-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-why-the-equity-is-worthless-part-ii 4/15


vessels at $2.55 Billion, an amount that is $550 million above our most optimistic
valuation of the vessels, a valuation that was completed with the assistance of
independent consultants and industry trade publications.


Under the bull case scenario where we pretend that somehow OSG will emerge from
bankruptcy within six months, pay no legal or admin fees, liquidate its vessels at a 25%
premium over prevailing market prices, and reduce its charter in obligations by 50% ($550
million) there remains a $176 million dollar deficiency when weighing the liabilities
against the assets.


Bear Case for Equity Recovery


The purpose of this report is to provide an objective review of why equity is worthless. For
that reason even in our bear case projection we reduce the debt load. In every Chapter 11
concessions are made by debt holders but this means little for equity holders as it would
be inconceivable that a debt holder - any debt holder - would elect to lose principal or
interest for the benefit of the equity holder. Under our bear case scenario we reduce the
Charter In obligations by about 35% reducing them from $1.1 Billion to only $700 million.
While completely arbitrary we believe that a net reduction of 10% of the debt load may be
achievable in bankruptcy ($400 million) so we felt comfortable with this figure.
Unfortunately for equity holders this does nothing to change their fate as readers
can see by reviewing the bear case asset tabulation.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1034851-overseas-shipholding-group-inc-why-the-equity-is-worthless-part-ii 5/15


While we call this the "Bear Case" it is still extremely optimistic. Here we reduce the cash
balance by $150 million assuming the company will remain in bankruptcy for 9 months or
more and spend at least a few million on legal and administration fees. Next, we impair
Voyage receivables by only $35 million (impairing the charter ins will require concessions
on both sides of the ledger) and reduce the inventories by $9.3 million assuming about an
80 cents on the dollar recovery. Finally in what is surely not a "bear case" assumption we
actually increase the value of the vessels by $100 million from our optimistic valuation of
$2.0 billion outlined in the first version of our report. We do so in order to account for some
of the US Flag operations which readers believe will command a premium.


Under our bear case recovery scenario a deficiency of $854 million exists when
weighing the liabilities against the assets. Realistically, the recoverable assets may fetch
only 70% of the figure we estimated which is roughly what bond investors are projecting
by valuing the debt at $.41 cents on the dollar.


Weighing All Three Scenarios: Base, Bull, Bear


Weighing all three scenarios provides a snapshot of why we are so certain that OSGIQ
equity is worthless with an average deficiency of $344 million amounting to over ten
times the current equity value. Put differently before shares of OSGIQ can be worth $.01
(one penny) OSGIQ bonds have to rise by over 150% and the company's assets
have to fetch at least $344 million more than what they are worth today.

This was the first time Infitialis ever had to revise one of our reports and we had no
qualms about doing so. In fact we enjoyed the process very much. As our ultimate
objective is to seek market truth we welcome and even encourage our readers to
challenge our views both publicly and privately. With that said the fundamental logic
behind our original point has not only remained the same but it has strengthened. While
readers may have disagreed with how we arrived at our conclusion in the last report they
can now see that no matter through which prism the OSGIQ assets and liabilities are
viewed there can be no way for equity holders to receive any value.


Disclosure: I am short OSGIQ.PK. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have
no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I just commented on your previous one. After seeing this published, you have secured my belief that this is zero even
more. It is totally ridiculous that this is trading at pre-bankruptcy areas. This is a bankrupt company with no equity, I
will look to short this.

By the way, the unsecured bank facility is trading in the low 80s. That pretty much answers the question of whether or
not it is technically senior due to guarantees from the subs. It is senior. In my humble opinion, that still makes the
bonds at $.40 on the dollar slightly interesting. Basically, buying the bonds here is similar to buying the company at
about 5x mid cycle EBITDA.

OSG is quite different from Genmar. The US flag arm is more profitable than ever and the LNG and FSO are in the
black. I believe that board members and their families held nearly 30% of the outstanding shares. Although this
doesn't show on a balance sheet I think it may play into the equity issue.

OSG is not Genmar. The US flag arm is very profitable and the LNG and FSO are in the black. In the Intl crude and
product markets its all about the rates. Renegotiate the charter-ins and clarify the alleged tax issue. In two years the
charter rates could easily be quadruple those of today. It's a gamble but the return to profitability could be as fast as
the slide to bankruptcy...and if the banks take that view then OSG survives.

Hi - very respectable that your revised your thesis. But you're trying too hard and you're off the mark again. The
charter-in obligations are indeed onerous, but they are not crystallized not balloon debt payments. Any obligation is
the difference between charter-in rate and the market rate or other charter-out rate that OSG earns, spread over the
next few years. In fact, OSG's cash burn will now be solely due to certain MR charter-ins and nothing else (except Q3,
where all the international crude and clean fleet may have lost cash). Half of the charter-ins relate to the U.S Flag
fleet, which is profitable, and the international MR market is improving, with a huge spike in the Caribs in Q4.


So you need to rethink your tables again. You can wait a couple of weeks to see the company's statement of assets
and liabilities in bankruptcy court, can't you.


It's not that OSG needs to come out of Ch11 any time soon anyway. They do have some valuable businesses and
they could convince any judge that the rates may turn - a couple of completely worthless tanker companies, Omega
and Marco Polo, have been fighting creditors for more years in U.S. courts - it is unimaginable that OSG will not get a
break if the mysterious tax issue (????) is resolved. Even Torm's shareholders kept 10% of the company (even if
probably not for long).


This is not a defense of the company; rather, an observation that you are short a bit too late.

Infitialis, Contributor
Author’s reply »  With respect, saying that we are "a bit late" on the short side is uncalled for when you have
no idea when we initiated our position. Meanwhile, your post history on SA indicates that you have been long
since at least "$9.35" saying things like "the risk is acceptable" or that the stock was a "traders dream" on
October 13 from which the equity subsequently declined by nearly 80% in less than 4 trading days. We are
unsure as to how you could qualify OSG on October 13 as a traders dream - as far as we are concerned a
"dream" investment should first avoid permanent loss of capital and second provide a risk adjusted return that
is in excess of the indices. It is now our turn to say that the rest of your comment loses any credence due to
the fact that you are a bag holder hoping for some equity recovery. Hoping for a prolonged bankruptcy in
order to renegotiate some lines is naive and will result in significant operating losses for OSG. The asymmetry
is simply not there to go long this stub. Conversely, shorting this stub at $1.00+ (or any price above $.50
cents) is a guaranteed winner. We will not longer be responding on this topic and feel very confident that
OSGIQ is a zero. In the future we would appreciate a reader disclosing they have been long for weeks or
months when commenting on our position. Good Luck! Infitialis.

The stock had been a traders dream: long and short within a very wide range. I am not a trader myself but it is
true that I had a number of positions from time to time, eventually with a net loss, not because I thought the
company was well-run but because I thought the banks would chicken out.


I thought I was contributing to your calculations but you are choosing a different way to argue, which is quite
distasteful. It is true that I don't know when you initiated your position but it is reasonable to assume that it
was fairly recently. Most people that shorted in the 20s don't write articles about a penny stock. In my view
your response is haughty and verging on the hypocritical: "commenters to disclose positions?" Geddatahere.

Your first article was so convincing that I sold 3/4 of the 100,000 
shares I had purchased at .51 at .76, too soon perhaps but still 
realizing a tidy profit. When Part ll was published with all of the 
additional information, I was so convinced that I sold the remainder  
at .89. Today, as it went to $1.20, I realized that since I never had 
any intention to sell any of it until the Delaware BK Court was 
actually deliberating this case, the possibility exists that in your 
efforts to save us all, you actually have cost me around $69,000.

This is why chapter 11 is so tricky. I got in at .55 and just got out. I had a feeling with the low float and high
short percentage this had the chance to explode up. And it still could run crazy to 2 or 3 bucks who knows.
Eventually it will be worthless. It would be nice to have an assessment of how to trade this now, as it will not
emerge from bk anytime soon. Good luck.

A quick question to Infitialis: why do the construction contracts and derivative contracts liabilties not also have
potential assets listed?


If the construction contract is with a shipyard (as I assume it is) in a rising market it can be onsold at profit, for
example Golar LNG sold multiple contracts it had initiated pre-2008 at very healthy margins. Not that kind of market
today and it certainly matters when OSG signed the contracts but at the very least new building contracts can recover
some of the liability. The only time they would be a dead loss is contractual obligation payments for cancelled
contracts.


Similarly there should be something recoverable from any FFAs enetred into, even if OSG bet on the market going the
wrong way, for example if they enter into an FFA at $8,000 USD p/day and the market went to $10,000 USD, the
contract can still recover .80c on the $1 (give or take).


Disclosure: no position


04 Dec 2012, 05:05 AM 


NZ Jeremy
Whoops, I've obvously had a brain melt there on the FFAs math, my point is the derivative and construction
liabilities need a bit of clarification before there can be listed as liabilities.


Is this covered off in the explan. notes?

What is the rush to exit bk? There isn't any urgency. So they operate as debtor in possession. Maybe pull a reverse
stock split - worthless as it is and take the company private. This depends on how the US flag vessels were paid for.
And then there is the Jones Act a law designed to sink every American shipping company.


Baltic Exchange spot charter rates are in the tank. As long term charters conclude tanker assets are parked in Hong
Kong or Singapore. Think of it as reinvestment risk only its a 500,000 ton ULCC.


OSG does not have a consistent fleet of ships: Panamax, Suezmax or Afrimax. Each designation is a different set of
vessel accounting rules.


There is a glut of tankers waiting for a berth in Alang. There is a generation of new builds to go on-line in 2014.
Financing is through German Banks and Industrial Banks of Korea and China. 
They want their money and there is no rush to judgment on their part.


The future is usually uncooperative give or take an economic disaster or two. Beyond that, if afreighment, long term
charter rates or spot increase over break-even then 3 billion red could zero out.


Not that this helps now. Which is why a reverse split, then private with a possible IPO five years out is plausible. As
far as stockholder law suits: don't think they have standing. A dumb investor who knows nothing of the business
deserves to get burned. There are too many amateurs screaming you screwed me, too many laws I have to know in
order to not screw them and myself. I hope the case gets trashed and restructuring can proceed.

Nice analysis but there is life after DOA. Especially for OSG - they got good ships.


I have NO position in OSG nor do I intend to take one with/in the next 48 hours, if ever.

In reviewing OSG's bk filings I find it amazing that each of their ships is a separate corporation/LLC etc. It reminds me
of the story about some NYC taxis each being a separate corporation which leases the required medallion. Each car
corp carried the minimum required liability insurance so that in case of a grevious accident, the injured party gets to
have the car but the medallion survives unto another day.  
I don't know if 181 ship corporations are a standard practice in the shipping industry but if onerous contracts/charter
ins/outs were written only with the separate ship corps without a separate guarantee by OSG then it would seem that
OSG could clean their deck of problem obligations of some of their wholly owned ship corp subsidiaries. They have
started to reject some of these charter-ins through the bk process.

As OSGIQ continues to increase in value day by day,  
I wonder how your short position worked out for you? 
With 79% institutional ownership and few insider sales, 
could it be that so very many professional investors 
with investigative abilities far surpassing mine are being 
completely careless with their clients money, given the 
iron proof case you have made for the total collapse of 
this company. I would think such a disregard would 
warrant comment by market gurus on all of the cable 
stations as well as criminal action. Could it be that after 
your exhaustive research for the two articles, you missed 
something? I would have bought back in on the pullback 
to .75 but I was afraid you'd be writing weekly updates.


07 Jan 2013, 12:45 PM 


Harfang
Maybe you are not responding anymore, but it's all well and good to call this a zero, it clearly is, but with the borrow
over 100% you better be right damn soon. What is the catalyst for this to die?


Point being, I've heard all these shipping companies are zombies because the debt holders don't want to take control
of the ships so they would rather just refinance and let the equity stay out there.

The slogging on of this equity appears to discount the heavy lift that Infatalis has made here. Today we see the report
of approval of another loan (25 million) -- to fund payments to lender and to maintain OSG ships. Sounds more like a
going concern. Given the picture painted here I would expect no one to extend money. But the article states after
objection of lenders was lifted the loan was approved.


So why do these big positions remain? Have they written off their loss and are rolling the dice? Is that prudent
behavior?


06 Feb 2013, 10:22 AM 


PaulKrupa
So. Here we are several weeks later and OSGIQ is inching its way back north. Why? The bonds seem to have
recovered some as well. 
The bankruptcy proceeds with no indication that company is headed for liquidation. One report said rejected charter
party can join the other unsecured creditors. Does that put them in front of equity holders for any unpaid charters?
Given that no one has commented recently and the twitter activity has disappeared I suspect the liquidation crowd
has lost their heart for this one. Given tanker rates and projections due to over tonnage it doesn't look rosy for any
recovery. Yet if OSG intends to be a going concern it might be a worthwhile exercise to guess at asset values.

to dissolve the AK oil business partnership until at least after BK. initial intention for bk was stated as debt restructure
but it seems the lenders are not looking at any restructure. No data on that. They had secured additional 25 million
loan in feb which seemed amazing at the time. Also a retention incentive program was viewed by court this week.
There was some objection but no info on resolution. Volume was 2 M shares yesterday.

Stock went from 70 cents to over 4. Bad call.

So could the same 'magic' happen to Excel Maritime Carriers after yesterday's bankruptcy rumors?

All bonds over .90 on the dollar and the equity trading around the $4 level..


Would be nice to hear from the author, especially after bragging about the track record..

The entire purpose of this article was to conduct a 'short and  
distort' operation. The perps succeeded in bringing the price 
down immediately so they could replace the stock they had 
borrowed and sold at a much higher price. Frequently this 
sort of attack on a company facing reorganization under 
chapter 11 results in the destruction of the distressed company. 
In this case, it is hard to destroy a company that started the 
procedure with two billion cash on hand. Now that unprofitable 
leases have been renegotiated the pps will continue to go up. 
The question here is did these perps continue to hold shares 
so they could benefit twice as they rode the price back up, or 
are they watching in astonishment, having duped themselves?

He was quite arrogant in one of his responses. You really think he's going to show up and admit he was wrong? If you
look at many of his other blogs, shorting ideas seems to be a focus.

This stock is not going away. If bonds want to own it, they can buy their shares like everyone else.

"OSG pro formas post chapter 11 http://1.usa.gov/1xQImj2"


5.4x net debt ($1.5b) to replace a 6.0x net debt problem ($1.9b); and the hedge funds hope to take 95% of the equity
in exchange for filling a $400m hole ($200m of which is already offered by Jeffries as unused credit capacity, per their
debt commitment papers). The hole would be zero but for the hedge funds' fees. They're over-capitalizing the
company, diluting shareholders, and calling it an investment. What a circus.

1 OSGIQ = right to buy 12 new at $3. 'Murderers row' of smart hedgie co-investors. I see spin-off/ acquisition potential
here.

The backstop is just a dilution mechanism (i.e. over-capitalize the company in order to steal it). After
shareholders have been diluted, the credit funds will commence asset sales under protection of S.363,
keeping the equity upside for themselves. This proceeding has devolved into sad joke.
