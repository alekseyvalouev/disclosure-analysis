Analysis Of NCR's Lackluster Quarter And New Details Of Bad Capital
Allocation Revealed
Apr. 29, 2015 11:53 AM ET7 comments
by: Ben Axler


Summary


NCR disappointed on top-line revenue this quarter, but engineered a 4c non-GAAP
EPS "beat." A closer look reveals questionable acct'g adjustments are the culprit.


NCR's reported operating cash flow appears overstated. Balance sheet changes in
deferred revenue don't tie to the cash flow statement.


Investors hoping for an imminent catalyst to unlock value had their hopes dashed as
the company suggested this would be "value destructive."


Questionable business relationship with Empower Software analyzed and hiring of a
Global VP of Business Development with a checkered past are revealed.


Shareholders should demand swift executive changes to restore confidence at NCR.


Last week, we profiled our short thesis on NCR Corp. (NYSE:NCR), a company we
believe has limited strategic alternatives, as it struggles to execute a levered acquisition
transformation strategy, a history of bad capital allocation, aggressive accounting, and a
management team with a questionable legacy at Symbol Technologies. In our follow-up
report, we will profile a blatant example of poor judgment and capital allocation to support
our opinion that NCR's shareholders should demand immediate change at the executive
level. But first, let's review NCR's recent quarter and further dispel any notion that value-
enhancing alternatives are imminent and that NCR had a stellar quarter where it "beat"
Street estimates


Dissecting NCR's Lackluster Q1 2015 Results


First off, contrary to a hasty and "recycled" news story by the Wall St. Journal last week
that NCR was seeking strategic alternatives, the company sent a somber message to
overly optimistic investors that nothing imminent is brewing. As Spruce Point suggested
earlier, NCR has few (if any) alternatives and that the mostly like path forward will be a
slow decline of its business. NCR outlined its view of the situation with the following quote:

"There would be, if you pull the business apart significant dyssynergy for example,
all of my divisions here of a common services delivery infrastructure around the
world, I don't have a separate services business for retail and financial and
hospitality. All of them share a common supply chain infrastructure; plants,
distribution centers, and of course we get lots of value from that scale. And they all
share a common G&A infrastructure and it will also - it'd be very difficult if not
value destructive to rather pull it apart."


To support our view that NCR's business is declining, consider that it reported $1.47 billion
and $0.23 GAAP / $0.43 non-GAAP for Q1. Street analysts were calling for $1.49 billion
and $0.39 non-GAAP. So NCR missed revenues by ~1%, but on the surface, beat bottom-
line estimates by $0.04. We will dissect this $0.04 non-GAAP earnings beat further, but
first we must point out the following.


Consider that all of NCR's GAAP financial results produced significant YoY
declines:


1. Gross margin contracted from 27.4% to 26.4% (100bps)


2. Segment operating income declined from $155m to $146m ( 5.8% decline / margin
contracted 30bps from 10.2% to 9.9%)


3. Income from operations declined from $108m to $95m (12% decline / 70bp margin
contraction)


4. GAAP diluted EPS declined from $0.31 to $0.23 (26%)


NCR can try to blame all its problems on currency movements, but digging beneath the
surface shows there's much more to the story. Getting back to NCR's magical $0.04
earnings beat, let's take a closer look at its bridge between GAAP / non-GAAP results.


Consider that this quarter NCR took a $16m restructuring charge, and says that $0.07
should be added back to get to non-GAAP EPS.

Now, in just the prior quarter, Q4'14, NCR took a $33m restructuring charge, and it added
back $0.10 to get to non-GAAP EPS.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3116286-analysis-of-ncrs-lackluster-quarter-and-new-details-of-bad-capital-allocation-revealed 4/21


So, if investors and analysts are to believe that a $33m charge is equal to a $0.10, add
back in Q4'14, why should they believe that in Q1'15 a $16m charge (approximately 50%)
should be equal to a $0.07 add-back? The diluted share count barely budged between
quarters from 171.3m to 171.6m this quarter. The only other variable would be the
effective tax rate, which Spruce Point believes should be normalized and applied
consistently.


Therefore, we estimate the real add-back should be approximately $0.05 and not $0.07. In
other words, NCR appears to have picked up a $0.02 benefit from a fuzzy and opaque
calculation.


NCR Still Appears To Be Overstating Operating Cash Flows


On the conference call, NCR's CFO made the following comment:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/4/29/545066-14303100398591926-Ben-Axler_origin.jpg

"The AR facility - that was really a better way to finance then our revolver. So we're
using our AR base to effectively borrow and that's treated similar to the revolver as
part of the financing cash flows. So that's part of financing."


However, it is quite clear that something seems fishy at first glance of NCR's financials.
Consider that in 2014, it reported that "Payments on revolving credit facilities" were
($1,050)m while "Borrowings on revolving credit facilities" were +$1,146m.


Therefore, the net inflow from revolving credit borrowings was $96m.


Curiously, this $96m borrowing amount is stated in the notes as having been drawn on the
A/R securitization facility of its financials, not its revolving credit facility. NCR lists its
ending revolving facility balance at zero for both 2013 and 2014. So why didn't NCR
clearly lay out a line item that showed the $96m coming from the A/R facility?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3116286-analysis-of-ncrs-lackluster-quarter-and-new-details-of-bad-capital-allocation-revealed 6/21


If investors and analysts are confused by this, they certainly aren't alone. Either NCR has
clearly made an error in its financial reporting, or it is attempting to obfuscate results.


It's also worth taking a closer look at NCR's 8-K filing on the establishment of the A/R
facility on November 21, 2014. NCR makes the following disclosure:


"The Company is independently liable for its own customary representations,
warranties, covenants and indemnities as the originator and as the servicer of the
receivables, and to the extent additional originators become party to the A/R Facility,
will be obligated to guaranty the performance of the obligations of such originators.
The Company will include NCR Receivables' assets, liabilities and results of
operations in its consolidated financial statements."


So here we have a statement that says NCR is running the results of NCR Receivables
through its results of operations in its consolidated financial statements. Could it be any
clearer now that the company's operating cash flow is indeed benefiting from the A/R
facility?


Cloud Sales Growth Of 20% Matched With Zero Growth In Deferred Revenue…
Seriously


NCR continues to tout that is "Cloud" (formerly software-as-a-service) revenue grew from
$113m to $134m year over year, or 20% on a constant-currency basis. When analyzing
cloud companies, it's important to look at deferred revenue as a key measure for the
health of the business. In this case, NCR reported Q1'15 "deferred revenue and customer
deposit" of $588m. Curiously, in Q1'14 NCR reported "deferred revenue and customer
deposit" balance sheet account was listed as $587m. In other words, NCR's cloud
revenue growth of 20% was matched with virtually zero growth in deferred revenue. We
challenge investors to find another SaaS/Cloud company with this sort of financial profile.


Also, NCR focused investors on its improved operating cash flow results for the quarter. A
closer look reveals that NCR recorded an enormous benefit of $110m from change in its
"deferred service revenue and customer deposit" - this was the single biggest contributor
that allowed NCR to grow its YoY operating cash flow from $31m to $79m. However, a
closer look at the QoQ balance sheet account change would indicate that the operating
cash flow should have gone up only by $94m ($588m - $494m). This would make
adjusted operating cash flow $63m, and not $79m.

Be Careful, Leverage Is Rising And Intangible Amortization Is Most Of The Non-
GAAP Adjustment


NCR's Adjusted EBITDA declined in Q1'15, and while its debt declined, so did its excess
cash. The net result is that NCR's leverage ratio ticked higher QoQ from 3.1x to 3.2x. We
still argue this leverage is understated due to its unfunded pension liability, capital leases,
etc., and is closer to 5x.

A majority of NCR's non-GAAP EPS "beat" came from a $0.12 add-back due to
acquisition-related amortization of intangibles. These are real costs related to the
company's recent acquisition spree, but have been capitalized on the balance. We argued
before that we believe it has made terrible recent acquisitions. What we find unusual is
that NCR splits these costs among three income statement categories: Cost of products,
services, and SG&A.

Pattern Of Bad Capital Allocation And Leadership:


As disciplined investors, we take every precaution to understand the executive team in
charge of guiding the strategic decisions of the company, and make sure they are diligent,
and focused on creating long-term value. We avoid investing in companies that are
excessively promotional with "Celebrity CEOs." There is ample evidence to suggest that
companies with Celebrity CEOs are bad for companies (here). A research reported
entitled "Understanding and managing CEO celebrity" (here) offers both pros and cons,
and suggested a matrix with four types of CEOs based upon degree of fame and
reputation. In our initial report, we provided evidence to suggest that NCR's CEO had
among the worst reputations (here). NCR may not be a household brand name, and it
receives a low score on Ranking The Brands (here); therefore, we believe its CEO's fame
score is low. According to the matrix, and in our opinion, NCR's CEO is best classified
among the "Silent Killers."

One way in which we believe the company's CEO has been a Silent Killer is by engaging
promotional deals and wasteful capital allocation decisions with his "buddies" that don't
appear to benefit NCR's shareholders.


For example, in 2011, NCR announced (with no financial details) that "NCR and Empower
Software Solutions sign referral agreement." Empower is described as having a Workforce
Management software designed to provide customers, particularly in the retail industry,
with a strategic resource to help them deploy staff more effectively.


Commenting on the announcement, EVP John Bruno said:


"Empower's technology can create new value for customers, especially when
combined with our assisted- and self-service solutions, and is highly aligned with our
hardware-enabled, software-driven business model."


Now, if you're confused as to why a workforce management product has any
synergy with NCR's retail point-of-sale checkout devices, you're not alone!

Commenting on the deal from Empower's side, its CEO Seth Bernstein said:


"We are pleased to create a dynamic new sales channel for Empower while
providing NCR's customers with an opportunity to leverage their technology
investments."


Who Is Seth Bernstein And What Do People Think Of Him?


Seth Bernstein is currently listed as both a Director of Outerwall (NASDAQ:OUTR), a $1.3
billion market cap company known for its Redbox kiosks, as well as a Director of Lighting
Science Group (OTCPK:LSCG), a penny stock that has burned $165m in the past three
years and has an accumulated shareholder deficit of $487m as of its last Annual Report
on March 30, 2015.


There are various public biographies available for Mr. Bernstein. According to LSCG's
proxy statement filed August 1, 2014, Mr. Bernstein is 38 years old and:


"Seth Bernstein serves as Global Vice-President for Business Development
and Strategy for NCR Corporation, a global technology company. He is also a
Senior Advisor to Craig Cogut and Pegasus Capital and Pegasus Capital and
Mr. Bernstein have entered into a general consulting agreement pursuant to which
Mr. Bernstein provides consulting services to Pegasus Capital. Prior to joining NCR,
from 2007 to 2011, Mr. Bernstein was owner and chief executive officer of Empower
Software Solutions, a leading national provider of innovative and state-of-the-art
human resources solutions. Mr. Bernstein is also a member of the Board of
Advisors of KPMG LLP, a director of Forstmann Little and Company, a member of
the University of Central Florida's Board and Athletic Board, and the Board of the
American Spectator. He and his wife founded the Kids House organization where he
currently serves as a board member. He is also the Chairman of the Compound
Foundation. Mr. Bernstein is a graduate of the University of Connecticut.
Pegasus Capital intends to elect Mr. Bernstein to serve as a director pursuant to
certain rights set forth in the Series I Certificate of Designation and described
elsewhere in this Proxy Statement."


According to Outerwall, Mr. Bernstein was elected to its Board on December 4, 2014 (8-K
Filing) and sits on its Compensation Committee (here).

"Seth Bernstein was named as a director of Outerwall in December 2014. He has
served as the president of Pegasus Advisory Group (a private equity firm) since
October 2014. Mr. Bernstein served as global vice president for business
development and strategy for NCR Corporation (a global technology company)
from 2012 to 2014. Prior to joining NCR, he was owner and chief executive officer
of Empower Software Solutions (a national provider of human resources solutions)
from 2007 to 2011. Mr. Bernstein is also a director of Lighting Science Group
Corporation (a provider of light emitting diode lighting technology), and serves on the
board of directors of Spirit Music Group (a music publishing company), Six Senses
Hotels Resorts Spas (a hospitality management company) and several other private
companies."


There are various other public references that detail Mr. Bernstein's past, such as the
Orlando Business Journal where he says he attended University of Connecticut (here), an
article about Stromberg where he was appointed CEO in Jan. 2003, and prior to that was
described as "one of the pioneers" of Zurich Payroll. There are also Internet articles (here)
and (here) that suggest Mr. Bernstein is a billionaire, part-time sports agent/advisor (here),
and a fixture on the Hamptons social scene (here).


However, most interesting is that Mr. Bernstein appears to be a close social friend of
NCR's CEO Bill Nuti. In the Pinterest picture (here), Bernstein (second from left) can be
seen with Nuti. There are other public photographs (here) and (here) showing Mr. Nuti and
Mr. Bernstein attending various social events with athletes and entertainers. Mr. Bernstein
appears to have a history of associating himself with professional athletes such as former
Celtic Dee Brown, who he hired as COO of Stromberg in 2003, but appears to have "left
the firm just a few weeks later," according to a Bernstein quote.


Having later sold Stromberg in April 2004 to Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), a multi-billion-
dollar company, it would appear to be a deal to lend credibility to Bernstein's career.
Paychex reported in its Annual Report that it paid $13.6m for the business while the press
release indicated Stromberg had sales exceeding $20m. A sales multiple of just 0.7x
revenues may indicate that Stromberg was struggling at the time of the sale, or a very low
margin business. One review of Stromberg on Glassdoor.com indicates that:


"The salary was decent and good benefits…until the house of cards crashed. Seth
Bernstein pointed it towards a volcano and lept off before anyone was able to look
out the window."

Mr. Bernstein would next get involved with a company called Empagio, the predecessor of
Empower Software via a name change, and stay there through June 29, 2012, when a
new CEO was appointed, and Mr. Bernstein was given the title of "Founder and Chairman
Emeritus." During this period, it appears that Mr. Bernstein created a loyal following of
detractors. In fact, a blog was created called "Seth Bernstein - Bad Capitalism." A
selection of quotes are provided below:


Date and Poster Quote


"The Shocker" - April 25, 2008 I was looking at Empagio web site again recently


and noticed Seth's bogus claim to have been


president of Paychex is no longer there. Looks


like the Paychex lawyers got wise to it and


forced its removal. I am sure he will still claim


this in person though. In addition, his bogus story


of purchasing Stromberg and growing by a


grossly inflated amount and selling it to Paychex


has also been removed.


When will this boy realize he can't continue to


spread these types of lies and get away with it.


The past will always catch up with you.


"Interested Observer" - May 15, 2008 Seth does watch the Internet and thinks he can


cover his tracks and keep people from finding


out other people's opinions of him. And yes, he


continues to try to "clean up his image" in written


form - like removing his bold-face lies from his


bio on the Empagio website (I hear he was


legally forced to remove the "fabrications").

"Dana" - May 26, 2008 What's even more frightening is this new


company he's took over, Empagio (located in


downtown Orlando, FL) is related to human


resources outsourcing for HR executives. Seth


Bernstein and Human Resources… uggg. Kinda


makes me feel like the last guy… with spit-up in


my mouth. You should see the massive number


of lies he wrote about himself on the Empagio,


Company -> Management Team -> webpage.


Seth Bernstein is obviously delusional… and


now the truth comes out. Freedom of Speech


rocks! I guess you forgot about those simple little


constitutional rights, huh Seth?


"Interested" - January 27, 2009 At the root level, I think he's the definition of


psychopath: completely self-absorbed with no


regard for others. However, they say 70% of


psychopaths active in society are in business as


salespeople. He lives in a world where morals


are fuzzy, and he's been taken advantage of by


lawyers and bankers as often as he's tried to


take advantage of others.


Our background checks on Mr. Bernstein suggest the following:


1. His description that he was a "pioneer" of Zurich, a small payroll services company,
appears to be embellishment, and that his role was as a salesman, not the CEO, founder,
or business strategist that would lead one to believe he was the pioneer.


2. The media's characterization of him as a "billionaire" may be exaggerated. He has
never appeared on any of the Forbes billionaire lists we can find (here). Also, does it stand
to reason that a billionaire would need to take the job of Vice President of Business
Development role for NCR?


3. His description as to having served as a member of the Board of Advisors of KPMG
may not be accurate. We cannot find any indication that KPMG even has a Board on its
website (here).

4. His description as first being a Senior Advisor to Pegasus Capital and then later
President of Pegasus Advisory Group offer conflicting descriptions of his role.


5. His description of being approximately 38 or 39 years old may not be accurate. His
work history dates back to at least prior to 1997 when he was with Zurich, and further
states that he won awards with ADP for two consecutive years. This suggests he would
have been in the work force by at least 1995 at the young age of 19 or 20, an age range
where most kids are completing their early college years. Our background check indicates
Mr. Bernstein may be closer in age to 47 or 48 years old.


6. Our attempt to verify that Mr. Bernstein graduated from the University of Connecticut
came back with the following comment: "Applied, Never Attended."

Clearinghouse (here)


Now we pose the million dollar questions to NCR's management:


1. Why was Mr. Bernstein hired as Global Vice President for Business Development and
Strategy for NCR Corporation - a very senior role within the organization - in the face of
publicly available evidence that suggests Mr. Bernstein's past business experiences were
problematic.

2. Why didn't NCR issue a press release announcing the hiring of Mr. Bernstein or the
creation of a very senior role.


3. What role did Andrea Ledford, NCR's Senior Vice President of Human Resources, have
in approving the hire of Mr. Bernstein? Andrea's career has followed Mr. Nuti's career very
closely. According to her biography, before joining NCR in February 2006, Ms. Ledford
was EMEA Leader, Human Resources, at Symbol Technologies, Inc. from 2002 to
February 2006 and held a variety of leadership roles at Cisco Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ:CSCO) in EMEA, Asia/Pacific and Latin America


4. Why has NCR never disclosed any tangible business resulting from the Empower
Software / NCR "referral alliance."


5. Mr. Bernstein recently left to become a director at another public company called
Outerwall. Is there a connection or coincidence with the fact the NCR has done business
with Outerwall in the past, and sold its money-losing entertainment division to it in 2012
(here).

Mr Spacely
You raise some valid points that investors should not overlook, but much of this analysis is grasping at straws and
does not suggest the company is 70% overvalued. If I use the mosaic theory and look at the same information, I come
up with a different conclusion. You make your money both selling short reports and shorting stocks. Enough said.


Let me address some of your concerns.


AR facility - You said in your prior report and again here that they report their AR facility in their cash from ops. The
CFO said they report it in financing and you show in the slides above that they do indeed show it as financing. But yet
your heading says its in cash from ops. It is not. What is included in the operations is the cost of the financing which is
probably in the Other income line. I agree that they are not very clear by lumping it with their revolving facility but they
do tell you about it. This may not be the best presentation but there are numerous companies that only show change
in debt on the SOCF. NCR at least breaks out long term debt and short term. You were able to dig through the reports
and find out all the numbers you needed. I too was able to do that and so too should everyone else. This is not a big
deal


Deferred rev – First and foremost, this is a balance sheet item so it’s a point in time not a rolling number. The absolute
change from one point to another is not reflective of the underlying changes. Second, DI is the SaaS growth engine
and despite the company saying it grew 20% yoy, DI was acquired in the middle of Q1 14. On a PF basis, DI grew
~$10m yoy. On a def rev balance of nearly $600m, that is a rounding error. Plus the company has so many revenue
elements included in that def rev balance that you cant accurately make the conclusion you do. Third, I’m not an
expert but there are a number of ways that cloud/SaaS revenue can show up in financials. The first thing to
understand is what actually makes up cloud rev. Cloud is a loose term and means whatever the person saying it
wants it to mean. Many people use the word cloud or SaaS but are actually talking about very different delivery
models. Anyone following a Cloud/SaaS company knows the first thing to do is figure out exactly what they mean by
the word. Your presumption is that def rev should grow in equal amounts to their bookings. But this is not the case. A
booking does not equal rev and thus def rev. Let’s say they book a $1m contract. If they bill and collect a one year
subscription, then yes, def rev should reflect the balance of the year that is left on this billing because they have

collected the cash but not yet delivered the service. But if they bill and collect qtrly, then def rev will barely change
because all the movement occurred intraquarter. Also, on the one hand you complain that the level of def rev didn’t
change, but then agree that it contributed to cash flow. That says, as would be expected, they converted def rev to rev
and then reloaded it with new sales. Again, nothing unusual here.


Amortization of intangibles – “What we find unusual is that NCR splits these costs among three income statement
categories: Cost of products, services, and SG&A.” You obviously don’t understand amortization of intangibles. These
are from acquired assets. They can be related to software IP (Products), the value of a workers knowledge (services)
or a trademark (SGA). And yes, these are costs of their acquisitions, but they are non cash adjs to the P&L. To get an
accurate assessment of the earnings power of the current business it makes sense to exclude them. If you want to
assess the success or failure of the acquisition there are other ways to do this, like ROA or ROIC.


In the end, you raise some valid points that merit close watch by investors. NCR is not a very ethical company as
evidenced by their long list of legal cases. But I don’t believe they are trying to deceive investors. In fact, most of what
you call out, you were able to piece together through NCR's own disclosures. Their presentation may not be the best,
but I think they offer a wealth of information in the notes of the statements that allow analysts to make their own
adjustments. I would argue that NCR offers some of the better disclosure.


I think like most F500 companies, they are big and unwieldy and have many competitive forces to battle which is
never easy and fraught with peril. As long as they disclose those dangers, investors can make their own
assessments. But thank you for pointing out some of the more egregious.

Neither articles by the author impacted negatively on the share price, NCR has even moved up a bit after-market after
a positive closing. May be readers do not take the alarming points made in the articles seriously or even use them as
counter indications?

Very interesting article.


The only feedback I am qualified to provide, regarding why a company like NCR would partner with a company like
Empower: many retailers' choose to have their Point-of-Sale system also double as their Time Clock system. Since
many POS systems have this functionality, a new POS implementation frequently includes integration to a time &
attendance/scheduling system. So when NCR gets in the door with a POS sale, there's a natural opportunity to
introduce Empower.

AX..Wow...Great research..I bailed on NCR after my thesis that they would capitalize on the chip card and ATM
refresh in the wake of the TGT hack...having briefly & profitably traded NCR 1999-2000, I failed to recognize they no
longer were positioned to capitalize on that great opportunity.  
When IR repeatedly fails to respond in any way to inquiries, it's a bit of a red flag. 
Anyway, I'm short based on your excellent research...seeking vengeance. Please keep articles coming. 
A minor suggestion: Make articles shorter and single themed...this one could have been two articles, one on the
accounting issues and another on the CEO connections.  
Thanks for posting.

I could honestly write a Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings series Book combined about NCR. Mr. Nuti has stated on
many occasions that "Numbers Don't Lie" and that is complete utter lie how he conducts business. Very disingenuous
to the highest and most lower than dirt degree there possibly could be. It's a total pyramid scheme how the business
is run and if you read the history behind the company, they still conduct business the same way, just like a Pig with
different shade of lipstick.
