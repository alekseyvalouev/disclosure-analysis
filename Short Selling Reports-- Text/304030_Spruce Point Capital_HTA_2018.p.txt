Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Is Short Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. 
(NYSE: HTA) And Sees 20% To 40% Downside Risk


HTA’s Chief Executive Officer Has A History of Failure And Non-Shareholder Friendly Outcomes: At Spruce Point, we like to follow executives who 
have destroyed shareholder value in the past as this pattern often repeats itself. HTA’s CEO and Chairman Scott Peters has been linked to multiple 
bankruptcies and liquidations (Grub & Ellis, NNN Realty Advisors, G REIT, T REIT, and Golf Trust of America).  Furthermore, we highlight a corporate 
and personal web of inter-relationships that links both HTA and CEO Peters to multiple bad players in the REIT industry, including Tony Thompson who 
was barred by FINRA and Nick Schorsch, Former Chairman of American Realty Capital Partners (ARCP, now VEREIT (NYSE: VER)), whose firm 
manipulated non-GAAP results and had its CFO convicted of fraud.


HTA’s Existence Began As A Non-Traded REIT Prior To A Direct Listing On The NYSE: Spruce Point has had many successes shorting companies that 
have taken back-door or non-traditional listing channels to come public, most notably the early China scams. Within real estate, the Non-traded REIT 
(NTR) industry is known to be a conflict-ridden business.  NTRs are sold to retail investors through broker-dealers who earn egregious commissions 
(upwards of 10%).  In general, for every $10 share purchase, about $1.50 is spent on up-front fees and acquisition expenses, leaving only $8.50 to be 
invested.  After Scott Peters (and his executive team) scraped fees from raising $2.2bn under the NTR umbrella, management listed the Company on 
the NYSE in 2012 without raising capital via a traditional IPO. In doing so, we believe public investors may not have received the benefits from a 
rigorous underwriting and due diligence IPO process.


In Our Opinion, HTA Is Likely Manipulating Its Quarterly Same-Property Cash Net Operating Income (SPNOI) Results: We have conducted a statistical 
analysis of quarterly SPNOI performance, and believe it is highly likely that this measure is being managed in a manner to show consistent results.  In 
our analysis, we compared HTA’s quarterly SPNOI results with its Medical Office Building (MOB) peers. HTA demonstrates the least volatility (i.e. 
lowest standard deviation) by a significant margin.  We point to potential accounting maneuvers and culprits of how the comparisons have remained 
so consistent throughout its public history, and share scary similarities of reported results with the Brixmor accounting scandal.


We Can’t Reconcile HTA’s Same-Property NOI Margin Profile: Same-property revenues have grown on avg. by 1.9% and same-property expenses are 
down by 1.1% since 2013, yet, there is no commensurate SPNOI margin expansion.  We provide an illustration of how we believe HTA’s margin profile 
should be expanding according to its reporting, and illustrate why the math doesn’t appear to work. HTA may be achieving its consistent SPNOI results 
though uneconomic means: e.g. entering into expensive long-term fixed-price contracts, and/or selling properties at unattractive prices. 


Serious Concerns With The CFO And Accounting Function: Despite CFO Robert A. Milligan claiming to have worked for Bank of America/ML from July 
2007 - Jan 2012 as a VP in corporate banking advisory, there is no FINRA record to evidence his employment. Milligan’s public profile also says he is 
CFO/Treasurer/Secretary, yet he also signs HTA’s SEC filings as Principal Accounting Officer (he is an MBA, not a CPA). HTA has a named Chief 
Accounting Officer, David Gershenson, as part of its executive team. SEC rules state that the Chief Accounting Officer must sign the 10-K filing; why 
hasn’t he done so? HTA’s accounting function appears in disarray with a majority of the staff sitting in South Carolina, two thousand miles away from 
its executive office in Scottsdale, Arizona. Our analysis shows that a majority of HTA’s accounting team has been in place less than one year, suggesting 
significant internal turnover and an inexperienced team overseeing the numbers.


Spruce Point believes Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. (HTA or the Company) and its Audit Committee should open an 
investigation into its reporting of Same-Property Cash NOI, which exhibits virtually no volatility - a statistically unlikely outcome.

An Audit Committee Review of HTA’s Consistent 
Results Should Be Conducted By A Third-Party


Management Is Incentivized To Deliver SPNOI Growth In The Exact Narrow Range That They Have Operated In: Management bonus 
incentives seem to neatly align to deliver SPNOI growth in the range of 2% to 3%.  SPNOI growth is the most important (i.e. highest weighting) 
performance metric in determining management compensation.  We also don’t understand why management is being compensated as if they 
surpassed the “3% SPNOI growth metric.”  HTA has reported 2.9% annual SPNOI growth (i.e. below the 3% high target) for each of the last three 
years.  Although, HTA has awarded its management team as if they surpassed the 3.0% SPNOI performance.


Industry Outlook For MOB REITS Is Not Favorable:  Rising interest rates combined with a higher cost of equity for the public MOB REITs is 
leading to a higher cost of capital.   HTA currently trades at a discount to the market’s estimated NAV, which makes acquisitions increasingly 
difficult, especially since management has shown a willingness to issue more equity in recent years. Investors have become complacent with 
expecting growth from acquisitions and we see the acquisition environment slowing significantly.   Furthermore, private capital investors are 
flowing into the MOB space.  These private investors seemingly have a lower cost of capital given their lower return threshold which in turn 
create a more competitive property acquisition market.   We believe this backdrop caused management to panic into overbidding for the Duke 
Portfolio at an original cap-rate below 5%.  


It Appears HTA’s Board Shows Signs of A Cabal of Rubber-Stamping CEO Loyalists: In the context of CEO Peters being paid $8 to $10m per year 
for consistently hitting magical SPNOI numbers, investors should scrutinize several directors with associations to Scott Peters past failures. Are 
these Board members really independent?  For example, W. Bradley Blair II (co-founded Golf Trust of America with Mr. Peters) has been the 
Lead Independent Director and also serves on the Audit and Compensation Committee.  In addition, Gary T. Wescombe (Chairman of G REIT 
where Mr. Peters was the former President and CEO) joined the board of HTA a month after it was formed and serves as the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee. 


Management Constantly Promotes Its Consistency of SPNOI Results: If you preach long enough to the choir, eventually they will sing to your 
tune, or at least that is what it appears HTA’s management is hoping for. We highlight numerous quotes over the last three and a half years 
illustrating how important it is to HTA’s management to repeatedly communicate the narrative of consistent SPNOI growth. By repeatedly 
touting the word consistency, coupled with SPNOI results that have virtually no volatility, its easy to see how HTA can appease its dividend 
hungry, risk averse investors. Furthermore, management has engaged in promotional marketing of its stock to retail investors through video 
shows such as Mad Money and The Motley Fool. Even worse, management disguises bullish Seeking Alpha blog endorsements as company press 
releases, a potentially misleading tactic illustrating just how far management pushes the envelope to promote itself.

HTA’s Share Price Has 20% - 40% Downside Risk 


Insiders Are Selling, While Passive And ETF Driven Money Is Buying, Who Is Laughing All The Way To The Bank? Spruce Point has consistently 
warned about the disturbing trend in the money management industry of blind index buying displacing fundamental and engaged ownership. 
HTA’s CEO, and all insiders combined, have been consistent net sellers of stock over the years. While increasingly using equity to fund its growth, 
it appears management has put no additional capital at risk to maintain ownership. As a result, insider ownership sits at an all-time low of just 
0.9% percent while large institutional money managers needing to pedal REIT funds and ETFs to retail investors gobble up more shares


Analyst See 17% Upside To HTA’s Share Price, Yet Are Not Discounting Potential Financial Restatement Risks:  Even with HTA’s share price 
down ~13% YTD, and it trading below the market’s estimated NAV, HTA told investors yesterday at the NAREIT conference it would not be a 
buyer of its own stock, and doesn’t see it as “accretive” at this level. Despite this bold statement, approximately 60% of sell-side analysts still 
have a “Buy” recommendation while the remaining 40% see its shares performing with the market as a “Neutral or Market-Perform”. Why 
should investors buy when: 1) Both the Company and insiders aren’t buying, and 2) Analysts covering HTA have been overly optimistic and 
inaccurate about their share price forecasts? We expect a further re-rating lower in the share price should HTA’s Audit Committee open an 
investigation into its abnormal financial reporting practices. We provide case studies to analyze what happened at other REITs with similar 
accounting issues surfaced: VEREIT, Inc. (VER) – formerly known as American Realty Capital Properties, Inc. (ARCP) – and Brixmor Property 
Group, Inc. (BRX) both fell ~40% and ~20%, respectively, after each company acknowledged manipulating certain non-GAAP metrics.  In our 
opinion, the evidence suggests that similar irregularities may exist at HTA and we show a comparative framework between HTA and BRX.  Given 
these precedent accounting case studies in the REIT sector, we believe HTA’s stock could trade to a range between $15 and $20 which 
represents approximately 20% to 40% downside

Chairman & CEO Scott Peters:
An Impeccable Record of Corporate Failure


Investors who have backed Scott Peters have not faired well in the past.  There are multiple instances where companies that were
managed by Scott Peters have ended in bankruptcy or liquidations, yet Peters benefited.

• He resigned after less than 8 months on the job (and 4 months 
after the above quote)


• GBE filed for bankruptcy due to “the tenant-in-common assets 
managed by NNN’s illiquid partnerships [that] were highly 
leveraged and the fees that NNN had generated [that] were not 
sustainable” according to Forbes


Sep 2004 - Nov 2006 Triple Net Properties, Inc.

We question the independence given the direct linkages to Scott Peter’s past corporate failures. In 2018 HTA 
implemented a retirement age of 78 (with a two year transitional period) for Board members. With DeWald and Fix the

HTA’s Statistically Improbable 
“Consistent” Results
18


The Narrative of “Consistency”


• 1Q15 Earnings Call: “As we look specifically at the first quarter, our results were again very consistent and dependable. A 6% increase in FFO per share to 
$0.37; 3% same-store NOI growth, the 10th consecutive quarter of growth at 3% or higher” –Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 2Q15 Earnings Call: “We continue to produce consistent results. 6% increase in the FFO per share to $0.38; 3% same-store NOI growth, the 11th consecutive 
quarter of growth at 3% or higher” –Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 3Q15 Earnings Call: “We're focused on the type of asset that's going to fit into our consistency, because we've now been consistent for 12 quarters in a row.” –
Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 4Q15 Earnings Call: “2015 was another consistent year with disciplined growth on both the internal and external fronts. Our portfolio is built to deliver 
consistent growth and it did.” –CFO, Treasurer, and Secretary, Robert Milligan


• 1Q16 Earnings Call: “…our results continue to be consistent, reliable and driving cash flow to the bottom line.” –CFO, Treasurer, and Secretary, Robert Milligan


• 2Q16 Earnings Call: “We generated 3.1% same-store NOI growth, which we have consistently generated over the last 15 quarters since the fourth quarter of 
2012.” –Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 4Q16 Earnings Call: “As we've discussed, we are well capitalized and positioned to provide quality medical office solutions for our tenants and consistent
performance for our shareholders who have come to rely on the stability and consistency of our performance.” –Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 2Q17 Earnings Call: “In addition, HTA continued to execute on its existing portfolio, delivering strong and consistent operating results.” –Chairman, CEO, and 
President, Scott Peters


• 3Q17 Earnings Call: “We have established a stable and consistent stream of cash flows for our shareholders…” –Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 4Q17 Earnings Call: “…a track record of bottom line growth where our consistent same-store growth and investment activities have allowed us to grow 
normalized FFO per share…” –Chairman, CEO, and President, Scott Peters


• 1Q18 Earnings Call: “This platform continues to deliver consistent cash NOI growth that will continue to translate to annual bottom line results.” –Chairman, 
CEO, and President, Scott Peters

The Evolution of The Definition of The 
Same Property Pool


Source: Q1’18 and Q2’12 Company filings


The definition of Same Property Pool has been altered throughout HTA’s public history.   Below, we show how the latest 
definition allows for significantly more room for management discretion. For example, management just needs to show 


“intent to sell” to remove properties – it can always change its mind later.   


Same Property Pool Definition: 2Q12 Same Property Pool Definition: 1Q18


To facilitate a comparison of NOI between periods, we calculate comparable 
amounts for a subset of our owned properties referred to as our “same 
properties.” 


Same property amounts are calculated as the amounts attributable to 
properties which have been owned and operated by us, and reported in our 
consolidated results, during the entire span of both periods compared. 
Therefore, any properties either acquired after the first day of the earlier 
comparison period or sold, contributed or otherwise removed from our 
consolidated financial statements before the last day of the later comparison 
period are excluded from same properties.


To facilitate the comparison of Cash NOI between periods, HTA calculates 
comparable amounts for a subset of its owned and operational properties
referred to as “Same-Property”. 


Same-Property Cash NOI excludes properties which have not been owned and 
operated by HTA during the entire span of all periods presented, excluding 
properties intended for disposition in the near term, development and land 
parcels, HTA’s share of unconsolidated joint ventures, notes receivable interest 
income and certain non-routine items. 
Same Property Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net 
income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its 
financial performance. Same-Property Cash NOI should be reviewed in 
connection with other GAAP measurements.


Note: that the current definition now allows HTA to 
remove properties from the same property pool that 
are INTENDED for disposition and/or development.   


Further, the catch all phrase of excluding “certain 
non-routine items” seems like a blank check to 
exclude items in order to achieve the desired result

WELL, VTR and HCP SPNOI growth is for the MOB portion of their real estate portfolio


Comparable MOB-focused REITs show significantly more volatility in their quarterly SPNOI results than HTA. 
Investors should be asking how is this possible, and if so, why has HTA’s management chosen to operate its business 


in this manner, when no other company in the industry elects to do so.

Weaknesses In The Accounting Organization


1) We observe that Mr. Gershenson worked at BDO and has his CPA address 
registered in South Carolina. He likely audited Golf Trust of America, the CEO’s former 
company which was based also in South Carolina and audited by BDO
Source: Company Filings, LinkedIn.com
2) SEC 10-K Part D. (2)(a): “The report must be signed by the registrant, and on behalf 
of the registrant by its principal executive officer or officers, its principal financial officer 
or officers, its controller or principal accounting officer, and by at least
the majority of the board of directors or persons performing similar functions”


A majority of the accounting team is new as 8 of the 13 team members 
we’ve identified on LinkedIn have one year or less of experience with 
HTA.  Further, a majority of the team is not physically located with the 
executive leadership team in Arizona, but is located in South Carolina 


Robert Milligan, CFO, is neither an accountant, nor is he the Chief 
Accounting Officer, but he has been signing SEC documents stating that 
he is the “Principal Accounting Officer”.  This is despite HTA having 
named David Gershenson as its Chief Accounting Officer in July 2017. (1)

Potential Culprits:  SSPOI Comparison of 
2015 vs. 2014 


Source: 2 & 3‐YEAR SAME PROPERTY GROWTH (2/16/17), FY15 Proxy. All figures $ in millions


In February of 2017, HTA provided a two and three year same property growth analysis.  We compared this to the annual 
same property cash NOI comparison provided in the FY15 Proxy.  We found that the properties that were removed from 
HTA’s same property base during 2016 had been growing NOI at 8.0%.  We find it suspect that HTA would remove these 


properties given their growth.   Perhaps, removing properties that will provide difficult future comparisons is one way that 
HTA manages to a consistent Same Property NOI growth of ~3.0%.  We also estimate the cap rates achieved from the recent 


sales may suggest uneconomic decision making in order to manage the SPNOI


The properties that were removed from the 
Same Property Base during 2016 were 


accretive to Same Property NOI growth in 
2015 as they grew by 8.0%.   Is HTA 
removing properties from the Same 


Property Base that provides more difficult 
future comparisons?

Y/Y growth 8.0%


We estimate the dispositions of the SWLTC 
and NAH Senior Care were sold at a blended 


cap rate of 8.7%, which suggests HTA 
received relative poor economics for selling 
these assets.  Selling assets at unattractive 


prices to potentially managing financial 
results would be a poor business decision

Potential Culprits of Accounting Issues


Source: Company filings


A 1% quarterly move in NOI currently represents about $800K.  Therefore, classification of immaterial expenses may 
give HTA the ability to achieve the desired SPNOI


How much discretion does management have in allocating administrative expense to 
properties vs. administrative expenses at the corporate overhead level?  


Are there any expenses that management has designated as “one-time” that should 
be allocated to property expenses.


The reconciliation from NOI to SPNOI for the prior period comparison requires a 
calculation to understand the movement of properties into the same property pool.  


We believe that the rental expense allocation in the prior period comparison could be 
adjusted up or down to achieve the required results.

In the last four proxy statements, management has been incentivized to deliver exactly 3.0% SPNOI Growth.  
Anything above 3.0% is NOT further incentivized with additional bonuses.  Somehow, management is operating below the “high” 


target in the three previous years, but still being awarded according to the “high” outcome

removed the historical average 3.1% SPNOI growth reference. Recall, in Q1’18 SPNOI growth was reported at 2.3%, but

HTA’s Stock Promotion Disguised As

Dividend paying REITs are often geared to retail investors for their steady monthly or quarterly income 
potential. HTA also often issues equity to fund its aggressive growth strategy, and relies on a network of 


brokers to sell its stock to mutual funds and ETFs geared towards REIT investors. We find it concerning that 
HTA peddles promotional buy recommendations from Seeking Alpha bloggers disguised as press releases.
