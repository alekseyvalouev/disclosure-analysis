Don't Believe In Affymax - The Stock Is Probably Worthless
Aug. 29, 2013 12:13 PM ET91 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Investors in Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY) would like you to believe that Omontys will make a
miraculous comeback and that Affymax will be a major winner. My belief is that the last
AFFY article contained multiple factual errors that when refuted show that the future for
Omontys is in fact dire. At the conclusion of this article all doubt should be removed
regarding the low likelihood that Omontys returns to market.


Truth #1: The Death Rate of Epogen is 0.0027% vs. 0.024% of OMONTYS


Falsehood #1: The Death Rate of Epogen is 0.85% vs. 0.02% of OMONTYS


This error comes from mixing data from www.drugcite.com with the safety data that was
reported by the company. The data from drugcite shows "For each adverse event listed,
percent (%) represents percentage of the adverse event to all adverse events reported for
the drug. Percent does not represent a rate related to drug utilization." In essence, a
comparison between drugcite adverse event rates and those of a patient population is
comparing apples and oranges. This is incorrect data analysis and should be discarded in
favor of analysis which compares the number of treated patients in each group who die in
the same period of treatment. The correct analysis is further explained below.


Truth #2: Europe was never going to approve Omontys due to safety concerns


Falsehood #2: European approval is merely delayed due to ongoing root cause
analysis


The most recent Affymax article states that Takeda withdrew from consideration for
European approval "because they were doing the "root cause analysis" they would not be
able to complete the investigation because it was still in process and "ongoing" despite the
fact that severe reactions were not present at the time of the clinical trials." However, there
is no evidence to support this conclusion. The truth is that we showed you an excerpt
directly from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use that stated the CHMP
"was of the provisional opinion that Omontys could not have been approved" due to "study
results indicating that Omontys may increase the risk of death or heart and circulatory
problems." It is clear that the EU application was withdrawn because Takeda
(OTCPK:TKPHF) could not get Omontys approved due to its safety profile.

Truth #3: Fresenius (NYSE:FMS) is running away from Omontys


Falsehood #3: Fresenius supports Omontys


The prior article wants investors to believe that Fresenius supports Omontys based on a
letter from Fresenius from February 13, 2013. Again, this is an out of context data point
because the recall did not happen until February 23, 2013. Pasting an outdated letter to
suggest that Fresenius is comfortable with the Omontys safety profile is not relevant,
especially in light of the recent conversation we had with Fresenius IR during which they
stated they would not "risk its franchise on a drug with unknowns like Omontys."


Truth #4: Epogen is safer than Omontys


Falsehood #4: Omontys is just as safe as Epogen


The last article wants investors to believe "Apples to Apples (not Apples to Oranges) --
each drug projected to 260,000 doses, the calculation shows that OMONTYS actually has
less fatalities than Epogen." Yet again, this is incorrect analysis because the safety data
we cited in our prior article was based on patient numbers and not on dose numbers. The
safety data that shows Epogen is safer than Omontys is based on 25,000 Omontys
patients being treated for approximately 2 months as opposed to 260,000 Epogen patients
being treated for a full year when the data is adjusted for the fact that the data covers a
period 6x longer for Epogen (12 months) as compared to Omontys (approximately 2
months). It is statistically invalid to do a comparison between the number of deaths in a
patient population treated for a year and a patient population treated for only 2 months.
The Baird analyst made the appropriate adjustments, and it clearly shows that Omontys is
9x more likely to cause a patient to die as compared to Epogen.


Conclusion


The recent article on Affymax recommending the stock on the potential for Omontys to
return to market draws the wrong conclusions based on outdated data and incorrect
analytical methods. The truth is that Omontys is more dangerous than Epogen, the EU
was well aware of the safety problems, and Fresenius is running away from the drug. It
remains our conclusion that Omontys is unlikely to be approved to return to market and
that Affymax's stock will probably be worthless.


Disclosure: I am short AFFY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Many of your statements are fabricated.


You make it sound like you know what Takeda and Fresenius are doing.


They sure aren't talking to you !!!


----------


From an Investor:


I spoke with a pharmacist who is also in investor relations. The company has looked at the SA article that allegedly
quoted Takeda and the company says the Takeda part is erroneous , that the composition is still that they can make
no announcement or decision regarding the return of Omontys or the non-return until they have completely their
investigations into the causality of the hypersensitivity reactions.


He said it was company policy not to give his name but said to encourage anyone on the Yahoo message boards who
doubts the veracity of my report to call Takeda themselves. make sure to all Takeda in the US. The number is (877)
825-3377. 
-------


Alpha uses words like...I think...Probably its worthless. A pure Con friend.


Your articles are worthless IMO.


Also the drug is known as OMONTYS, and if you did some real research you would know how to spell it. LMAO!

Author’s reply »  There is nothing fabricated here. Your analysis is shoddy and deserves to be called out. You
incorrectly mix up adverse event rates in a population and the % of specific adverse events among all
adverse events. You make baseless claims about the EU when the CHMP put out a release. You direct
people to letters from Fresenius that support Omontys from before the recall. You don't adjust event rates
between populations treated for a year and those only treated for two months. I will give you the benefit of the
doubt that it's simply oversight; the alternative is that you're trying to mislead people.

Confirm that your own fabrication dissapointed your expectations disallowing you adequate time to cover your
Short position. To funny you are desparate again today...Not working you are in trouble and if you did not
speak to anyone at Takeda you may have crossed the line...Longs need to confirm this, if it is a fallacy then
the SEC is notified and civil litigation for all longs that sold could be brought to bear...

I like your moxy Alpha but if I could recommend a plan of action for you due to the hard line (questionable or
not) stance of the pro AFFY holders. Don't reply, don't question them, let the stock jump, as apparently the
buying is decently strong after all the events that have happened to the company. When it gets to a high
enough level (in your view) short more. I do my research on my own and come to my own conclusions and
buy or short companies, sooner or later the truth is reflected. Another company I follow is in BK and
worthless, yet the action has doubled the price in a few days, unfortunately many will loose following false
statements. If you believe in your research don't press it so hard as it just comes across as less believable the
more you fight with others that have opposite beliefs. Be patient and trust yourself.

Sorry for the late response. Was in meetings and talking to investors Buying UNXL, a stock that you were
shorting at $15 according to your article in June. http://bit.ly/18lpcSE


Oh, today it hit $19.30.


I was in buying UNXL in the $15s in early August and also wrote up a research article too. How contrarian to

Anyways, I have spoken to AFFY at great length. I questioned the restructuring ..."actions".....pay offs of
creditor obligations....etc....


Their comment was...


If we were to go into BK do you think that we would have paid off the banks, suppliers and closed out the R/E
lease...NOT LIKELY !!!


If so, the company would have done so several months ago. And it didn't.


They can't control the campaign working against them and made that perfectly clear, however they are aware
of it.


Their comment....ready.....Well we're still here!!!


----------


Also -- Going back a few months there was also Fear Mongering on:


iStar Financial - SFI at $2s - $3...where I bought.....BK never happened...SFI saw $12's.


Genworth Financial - GNW - Stock was $4...Now $12


Cheniere Energy - LNG - In at $3 - $5...Now $29


Others: QCOR at $20....BBY, GMCR, LNKD type scare tactics then shorts got BURNED severely! This noise
offered great buying opportunities!!!


Do you get my point!

From an AFFY investor!!!!


"Following a large number of patients who received an initial dose of Omontys injection in early to mid-
February, serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported. As a result, Affymax and Takeda decided to
voluntarily recall Omontys and suspend promotional activities in the US. In June, Takeda withdrew the
European Marketing Authorization Application after determining that a risk mitigation plan would not be
completed during the European MAA timeframe. An investigation is currently ongoing into the root cause of
the hypersensitivity reactions. If we can identify and address the underlying cause, the FDA has said they
would work with us on appropriate next steps for the product."


Definitely not the response AE claimed. This would certainly be ILLEGAL !!!

OK so EPOGEN is safe and doesnt cause any DEATHS?

You know nothing about BIOTECHS or TECH stocks Now do you ??


Ohhhh and your prior article on UNXL - what happened there in July - Aug - Losing ???? We are making B A N K !!!


Ummm Ba BYE!!!


29 Aug 2013, 12:28 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Both drugs have death as a potential adverse event as a result of taking them. Omontys just
has 9x as many deaths on an annualized basis. Omontys is not safe in comparison to Epogen and therefore
is unlikely to ever come back to market.


As regards track record, I would say that everyone's is mixed. My short in UNXL has been very profitable, but
my long in ONTY was a disaster. The short in CLSN was also good.


Here are some of your losers:


• VHC declined -44% since you recommended it on February 27, 2013 
• VVUS declined -57% since you recommended it on July 18, 2012 
• VRNG declined -28% since you recommended it on June 19, 2012 
• IDIX declined -44% since you recommended it on June 12, 2012 
• THLD declined -28% since you recommended it on May 11, 2012

"Omontys just has 9x as many deaths on an annualized basis"


Now that i see this here i'll repeat a question i asked further down in the thread; how many of the epogen
deaths were within the first 2 months of the patient's treatment regimen? A simple % will do.


29 Aug 2013, 01:21 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I don't know. Takeda will need to show that Epogen deaths are front-loaded in the treatment
cycle in order to get Omontys approved again. I'm skeptical they will be able to show this without a trial and I
think a trial would be unethical to run. Chicken and egg problem. It's one of the major reasons I think Omontys
is unlikely to ever come back.

"I don't know. Takeda will need to show that Epogen deaths are front-loaded in the treatment cycle..."


You should know if you're going to make the claim you made regarding 9x by extrapolating out to a year. IF
epogen's were front loaded they would extrapolate in the same ballooned fashion as you did with omontys. IF
they were one might credibly presume those affy patients who survived their first two months would survive
the full duration of their regimen, unless dying from other causes of course.


I kind of suspect you do know if the epogen deaths were or were not front loaded. Since i have no proof i
won't accuse you of that. I will accuse you of shoddy research to reach the conclusions you did when
comparing epogen and omontys, because of your own admission of not knowing. It's information that would
be easy enough to track down if one wants to make an accurate case, and easy enough to ignore or say, "I
don't know," when one does know and it falls against their argument.


"Goes to credibility, your honor."


I think you'd better go do more research, then come back and report to us. If you don't come back and report
to us i imagine we will know what that means. I further imagine It would mean amgen was willing to kill for
profit while takeda was not.


I'll be waiting.

Just a question, on UNXL. If you were short at 15 how have you been profitable on UNXL, when it's currently
at $19.21? Did you short way before that $15, I think you did mention you shorted at $15, or was that just the
price on the date of your article?


30 Aug 2013, 01:30 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I have been short since the $40s. My first article was at $27. $19 is < $27. I actually covered
around $16 and missed the bottom and am reshorting it now. It and ARNA are my most profitable shorts this
year.


30 Aug 2013, 02:36 PM


TheeDudeness
That makes sense then. You were short then wrote the article after you'd already taken sufficient profits.
Covered at $16. I'm not sure shorting now one can expect the same type of returns.

Good luck on AFFY, I'd likely take the opposite position at this point. Shorting a $1.60 stock...doesn't seem
worth it. Seems to lend itself to undervalued as well. However if you shorted in Feb, bravo.


30 Aug 2013, 03:04 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I think UNXL goes < $10 if they miss the Oct 1 deadline. It will create serious doubt that
anything will ever be shipped.


I shorted AFFY around current prices on average - some a bit higher and some a bit lower. My target price
based on multiple scenarios is $0.44. A decline of about 70% from my first article would be a much better
than average return for me.


30 Aug 2013, 03:08 PM


TheeDudeness
Yeah, but the likelihood that UNXL will miss the October 1 deadline is substantially less now. Kodak, just due
to their sheer size and legacy, lend some creditability.


Very true on AFFY. However, it takes forever for biotechs to die. DSCO is a prime example. The chances it's
going up a dollar or down a dollar are about the same.


30 Aug 2013, 03:56 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I think AFFY is entirely dependent on the outcome of the Omontys investigation and that we
should know within a few months whether or not Omontys is coming back. If not, AFFY should go to $0.10
and they probably file for bankruptcy to expedite a liquidation.


On UNXL, my opinion is that there is very little chance that they meet the October 1 deadline. The bear thesis
is that they will never be able to produce Uniboss and if they miss the Oct 1 deadline, that's supportive of the
bear thesis. I'd be shocked if the analysts don't downgrade and I think the stock goes to < $10. Remember
that the company has a history of signing partners (remember Samsung?) and then being unable to get their
supposedly revolutionary technology to work. I think that's repeated again with Uniboss


30 Aug 2013, 04:10 PM


TheeDudeness
Hmm, it's possible on AFFY. Analysts are pretty across the board on this one, 1 buy, 1 hold, 1 sell. Basically 2
sells. Also they have been burning cash like crazy, and revenue in general has been decreasing. Long term it
doesn't look great.


UNXL is a little different. Saying that just because 1 thing didn't go through a different one won't is a risky
belief. Just because I flipped heads doesn't mean it's going to happen again. A lot of people have confirmed
the product this time. While you did post some pictures that call into questions the product, too many experts
are saying the complete opposite.

Why would you not comment on Fresenius executive tonque slip in mentioning Takeda having agreement almost
done to test DNA in Fresenius facilities which is very likely to be post marketing authorization requirement? Are shorts
little bit scared of that scenario?


29 Aug 2013, 12:29 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I welcome Takeda completing its investigation and believe that there are three possibilities:


1) The upside - they identify some sort of subgroup that reacts badly to Omontys and are able to get the FDA
to allow them to bring Omontys back with little or no testing. This has a de minimus probability in my opinion. 
2) The middle ground - they identify some sort of subgroup that reacts badly to Omontys and are then told
that more testing / a new Phase 3 etc is needed to bring Omontys back. In all likelihood this results in
abandoning Omontys since running a trial would be unethical 
3) They are either unable to identify a subgroup that is disproportionately affected or they identify one that is
very broad, both of which are likely to result in immediate abandonment of Omontys


I think #3 is most likely, then #2 and then #1

that?

Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  There is zero evidence of human error. It's all speculation that the problems were human
error. There is no reason to believe that human error should be a bigger problem with Omontys than with
Epogen yet the death rate is 9x (and the hypersensitivity even greater) with Omontys when compared to
Epogen.

Author’s reply »  A year ago a friend of mine suggesting QCOR and laid out a credible case that it was only
worth $10/share. Thankfully I never shorted. But that doesn't mean that there wasn't a well-reasoned short
thesis. It was simply wrong in the end.

QCOR was wrong in the end. 
GMCR was wrong in the end. 
NFLX was wrong in the end. 
Smart shorts made plenty of profit along the way though.


AFFY will be wrong in the end as well.

Now you reveal your true self. There never was a well reasoned short thesis for Q. It was orchestrated by a
well known short and the orchestration is very much akin to your behavior with AFFY and UNXL. It's no secret
that the organized attempt was incubated by Citron and you can read Andrew Left's "thesis" on his website
regarding Q...it's still there predicting single figures on July 2012 when he wrote the missile filled with half-
truths, mistruths, and innuendos . Your predictions and negativism are eerily similar for AFFY.


29 Aug 2013, 07:57 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I genuinely believe that AFFY will decline a lot in value and that it is most likely (90+%
chance) worthless. I also think that UNXL is overvalued and have started shorting it again in the last few
days. I expect them to miss the October 1 deadline and for the stock to trade down in a significant manner.

"you brought this $27 stock close to $2 now and still you don't want to cover"


Shorties didn't do it. It is due to that the O recall news brought AFFY stock price from $27 down to $0.8. However,
many "smart" shorties started to short it about that price range. Have fun!


AE still tried to use misleading data from drugcite.com to cover his ass. He hasn't provide a thread of real credible
sources to support his claim of 0.0027% death rate of Epogen. Please don't quote data from one analyst with financial
interest, especially from Baird hedge fund. The rest of his article is just childish argument with his wishful thinking.

Dude, 
when ever someone is 100% sure about anything, you know they are talking out of their Asshole... You would have
more creditability if you were a little more humble about your opinion. No one can be absolutely sure about anything. 
There were no deaths associated with subcutaneous administration so it can definitely be brought back in some way.


Chill out dude, your shorts are showing... ha.. ha...

Author’s reply »  I have simply said that I think it's highly likely the drug doesn't come back and IMO opinion
there is not enough evidence to suggest that subcutaneous administration is truly safe.

nyjohngrey
I am the investor who called to Takeda to verify Alpha Exposure's statements.


Tellingly, the rep ended the call by saying "Thank you for calling Takeda/Affmax" even though I had called Takeda.
IMO, a way for Takeda to signal they are a team with Affymax, and not about to abandon them.

Yes, please answer below question: How comes O works fine (100%) when administered subcutaneously if this is a
killer drug?

I don't buy this small sample size crap. It is a BS. All one dose is administered subcutaneouly and that
reaches the blood instantaneouly . This should react right away more adversely as opposed to the iv one if it
is something wrong the product. But it did not happen at all. What does it tell you shortie? There is nothing
wrong with O and the fact will come out any time now. Affy will rock instantaneously! Long will win!!

ChrisWestLA
Alpha Exposure-


Your articles and comments are well reasoned and intelligently presented. However, it appears the lion's share of your
data is "old news" -- albeit presented in a unified format highlighting the negative argument re. AFFY.


The ONE item that appears new to my eyes is your statement that Takeda IR "clearly" told you it was "Highly Unlikely"
for Omontys to return to the market.


I spoke to Takeda IR representative Christopher O'Riley yesterday (8AM Tokyo Time) and he indicated that HE never
said what you reported. Nor did he believe that anyone at IR would make any statement containing the words "highly
unlikely" or similar with reference to any of their properties. HOWEVER, he was one of five IR representatives, and
was the only one in at the time and could not immediately confirm with the other four reps. Moreover, he indicated
Takeda's position remained that they are "looking into this product [Omontys] and continuing to examine the cause for
its original withdrawal." He finished by saying Takeda had not changed its official position or made any amendments
or alternative position statements on the matter. In a final (disconcerting) statement of equivocation, Mr. O'Riley did
mention that an IR representative COULD have given their PERSONAL opinion to a caller, but he did not know nor
did he have any factual background to suggest such did occur.


**I am hopeful that AFFY or Takeda releases a statement ASAP addressing the alleged IR Statement made to Alpha
Exposure suggesting the "Highly Unlikely" return of Omontys to the market.**


29 Aug 2013, 02:36 PM


pharmaman58
That makes three communications with Takeda IR--none confirming the author's statements. Wheels starting
to come off a bit.

are you kidding me?...I had to do a double take to see if it was the same author who wrote the hit piece the other
day...it is!


Look Alpha ex, you stated your opinion and succeeded at driving the pps down with your doomsday heading, now
your back at it a couples day later?People are interpreting it in several different ways,either you are pissed that a
rebuttal was published which stopped the downturn and you were disappointed or your so childish that you have to
have the last word and subsequently have turned S.A. into a glorified Yahoo msg board...which is it?You are making a
fool out of yourself at this point, this latest "affy is worthless" article is a joke, not for the body of the article, but the
timing. Please explain what your purpose of regurgitating the same article from two days earlier was?...as your
credibility is riding a thin line at this point,as you clearly are showing that you feel your first article didn't do enough
damage. most authors publish their work, then go away until there is something important to say that they haven't
addressed...enlighten me...why?

Author’s reply »  I believe there were significant factual errors in the rebuttal article. This article points them
out


29 Aug 2013, 03:27 PM


John Gibson, Contributor
62 deaths for Epogen divided by 260,000 administered = .000238. 5 deaths for Omontys divided 25,000 administered
= .0002. looks about the same.


29 Aug 2013, 03:23 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  This is addressed in the article. Those are patient numbers and not dose numbers. Epo is a
year in duration and Omontys only ~2 months. Hence the adjustment.


29 Aug 2013, 03:27 PM


John Gibson, Contributor
gotcha. I understand your points, but I don't think the odds are as heavily weighted against them as you. I like
the risk/reward of being long rather than being short. Why short something when most the bad news is
already priced in? Anyways, thanks for your insights.


29 Aug 2013, 03:35 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The stock is clearly pricing different odds than what I think are justified.


29 Aug 2013, 03:52 PM


pharmaman58
John--Of the five deaths, two were due to cardiovascular events--a fact Alpha knew but did not mention or
figure in his calculations.


29 Aug 2013, 06:10 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Two replies: 1) The company thinks that they were cardiovascular related events but they
are nonetheless still being investigated and 2) It is unclear how many of the Epogen deaths were related to
issues other than Epogen so this is an all-comers analysis and therefore apples to apples - it would be
incorrect to compare scrubbed data on Omontys against raw data on Epogen

Alpha-- 
Raw versus raw data--no problem with that.


My problem is that you knew 40% of the fatalities associated with OMONTYS administration are nearly
certain to be fatalities from cv events. This is a statistics changer and needed a call out. But guess what? No
call out.


The real point here is this: your 9x greater fatalities thesis is flawed. But it was effective in driving down the
share price temporarily.


30 Aug 2013, 08:37 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  So you think there are no CV events in the Epogen data?


Or you think it is unlikely or implausible that the CV events were related to Omontys despite the CHMP saying
it saw "study results indicating that Omontys may increase the risk of death or heart and circulatory
problems."?


Or you think it would somehow make it more likely the FDA lets Omontys back on the market if it only caused
5x as many deaths?


IMO, you do not have a valid criticism of my use of "9x"


30 Aug 2013, 09:54 AM


liangy01
I have a problem to agree with the way to extrapolate the 2-month O data in order to compare with the 1-year
E data and concluded accordingly that E is "9X' more deadly. Drug toxicity profile versus fatality over time is
not necessarily linear and depends on the mechanisms of action. Adjustment needs to come with statistical
confidence intervals.


30 Aug 2013, 12:55 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I wish we had data for the 260,000 patients treated with Epogen for just the first two months
of their treatment. I agree that would be a better comparison. The problem is that unless the FDA lets
Omontys run further trials such a comparison will be very difficult. Also, don't discount the hypersensitivity and
anaphylactic reaction data. Those are very serious side effects and even without a worse safety profile re:
death, those SAEs should have been enough to cause the drug's removal from the market since Epogen is so
much safer.


30 Aug 2013, 01:22 PM


ChrisWestLA
At the end of the day, I don't think anyone knows anything more than they did last week -- except for the highly
questionable Tedaka IR alleged statement re. the "highly unlikely" return of Omontys to the market. Which statement

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - February 23, 2013 - and OSAKA, Japan, February 24, 2013 – (BUSINESS WIRE) –
Affymax, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFFY) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) today have decided to
voluntarily recall all lots of OMONTYS® (peginesatide) Injection to the user level as a result of new postmarketing
reports regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening or fatal. The
companies have been working actively with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which has indicated its
agreement with this decision. The companies have also issued a letter to health care professionals indicating that no
new or existing patients should receive OMONTYS.

Tylenol is causing 500 deaths a year - CNN was reporting this weekend. Still Tylenol is on the market. I'm sure O is
coming back. I doubled my position last week.


03 Sep 2013, 01:28 PM


John Powers
You're risking your whole bet on 5 deaths. That's to big of gamble for my liking. IV iron can cause anipahylatic shock,
dialysis centers have deaths frequently. ESA's have quite the iffy safety profile. Considering the health of most of this
country I'm surprised there aren't more deaths. I think your biggest flaw in reasoning is your interpretation of the FDA
and how they'll act. IMO they are not the strict organization you think. Shelving the drug permanently only looks bad
on them after they approved it not to long ago. What will it say about future trials for the rest of big pharm? Affymax's
extensive patient trials did not meet that goal. Not a single death was caused by an allergic reaction. Safety profile
was considered the same. IMO O will return later this year with a black box warning.


04 Sep 2013, 03:18 AM


godwinpeak
O anaphylaxis has killed .02% of its patients, or 2 in 10,000; [this is 83 times more than anaphylaxis deaths in the
general population].


Anaphylaxis from all sources kills .00024% of its victims, or 2.4 in 1,000.000*


*Source Wikipedia: "Currently, anaphylaxis leads to 500–1,000 deaths per year (2.4 per million) in the United States"


Takeda has a serious problem with O and anaphylaxis, and possibly CV problems too. Dr. Daniel W. Coyne, a kidney
specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that unless the problem was because of contamination, “this
could easily lead to withdrawal of drug approval.” He said that “two in 10,000 deaths on first exposure is
unacceptable, compared to nothing like this” with Epogen. NY Times (Feb. 24, 2013).
