Zhongpin: Overstated Income, Excessive Capex and Deceptive SAIC
Filings
Aug. 17, 2011 10:21 AM ET18 comments
by: The GeoTeam


We recently conducted thorough due diligence on Zhongpin Inc. (NASDAQ:HOGS).
Based on our work and the observations of our investigators who have visited HOGS
facilities on various occasions, we conclude that: HOGS is in fact processing and
selling pork products in China. However, while HOGS is clearly not an "empty shell" we
did find clear and substantial evidence of possible fraudulent activities.


Summary of Findings


Overstatement of SEC net income vs. SAIC filings by nearly 500% in 2009.
GEO estimates 2010 net income of $10-20 million vs. $58 million reported to the SEC.
Deliberate manipulation of SAIC filings.
Likely diversion of almost $150 million of reported capex.
Inconsistent trends between inventories and sales.
Repeated capital raisings, despite assurances to investors that none were needed.
Capex concerns already noted by Roth Capital resulting in downgrade.


What Is Zhongpin Inc. Hiding From Roth Capital?


In its 2011 second quarter conference call, Zhongpin (HOGS) refused to respond to Roth
Capital's questions, posed in an earlier research note, concerning the accuracy of the
average capex and land use rights spent for the average slaughtering facility alleging
costs are high relative to peers in the industry.


We find HOGS refusal as a blatant disrespect for an Investment Bank, which is attempting
to proactively bring clarity to the ChinaHybrid space, as a huge and obvious red flag that
leads us to question the legitimacy of HOGS' operation. The reasons that HOGS gave to
ignore Roth's request were unacceptable.


Reason 1: HOGS said it had concerns about 'selective disclosure.' We find this mind
boggling since this is what analysts do. They ask questions and then disclose their
findings. Regardless, we hardly find Roth's questions to justify capex as classified in
nature.

Reason 2: Risks to competitive advantage if the information gets out. We believe this is
just a ridiculous boiler plate answer. This is the same answer that many fraudulent
ChinaHybrids used when they were attempting to explain why they did not report accurate
numbers to the SAIC, even as they bragged that being a U.S. listed company gave them
increased exposure, and basically belittling the fact that any legitimate competitor could
easily access public SEC filings. HOGS, we have a little secret for you. You are not
operating in a covert environment where your formidable competitors do not have access
to the same information you do.


Reason 3: Professional auditing standards and precision that might or might not be
applied by Roth. Talk about getting punched in the face. HOGS, are you really claiming
that Roth is unqualified to interpret answers to simple CAPEX and land use rights issues?!
You had no problem with them building forecasting models based on information you
provided to them. You also had no problem raising money through IBanks, but now that it
seems you feel they may not be qualified to fully understand the 'complicated' swine
business. Are you telling us that we should take analyst financial estimates with a grain of
salt? Please enlighten us on the complexity of the accounting issues regarding land use
rights and use of capex. Educate us.


Red Flags Flying Over HOGS


In evaluating HOGS, there are an abundance of red flags indicating the high likelihood of
deceptive practices, including:


As reported to the SEC, over 6 years HOGS' revenue has increased 20 fold (2,000%)
to nearly $1 billion in 2010 from $42 million in 2004. During that time, store count has
only roughly doubled.
Zhongpin has often misled investors by repeatedly stating in its filings that it could fund
its expansion through access to lines of credit and internally generated cash flows.
Ensuing actions to quickly proceed to raise equity capital contradicted these
statements.
Zhongpin's debt/equity capital raises since its reverse merger in 2005 have been
excessive - raising $432 million in debt and equity capital so far.
Substantially all of the capital raised has been poured into capex to expand new
facilities, with the result that the company has been able to generate very little if any
free cash flow in its history.
This massive capex expansion has aggressively continued despite consistently low
profitability with a net income margin of only 6%.

Zhongpin has misrepresented its business using the term "stores" to describe simple
one man, 6 foot wide meat counters located within open air vegetable markets. Few of
the "branded stores" are even free standing buildings.
Zhongpin has misrepresented its focus on higher income customers. Zhongpin sales
counters ("stores") are located within low cost open air vegetable markets which are
frequented by low income Chinese. In addition, the majority of these "stores" are
located in China's poorest provinces such as Henan, with only a minority located in
higher income areas such as Shanghai and Tianjin.
Zhongpin only recently disclosed its list of store locations on its website, and the list
was unusable since it did not contain actual business addresses. Instead, the
company used district names or names of entire cities to identify many stores.
Moreover, the list was in a format that could not to be printed and was subsequently
removed from the website. Visibility is the lifeblood of retail stores, so the reluctance to
reveal their locations is highly concerning.
Zhongpin's claims in a recent press release that it operates at higher standards and
efficiencies than its industry peers:


"Zhongpin's "advanced" processes produce higher yields of carcass meat and all
pork products than are typical." 
"Zhongpin's advanced industrial cluster concept usually results in more rapid
improvement in capacity utilization for new plants than is typical." 
"Zhongpin's capital investment intensity is intentionally higher than is typical". 
"Zhongpin's gross profit margins are significantly higher than Chinese industry
peers".


Source: HOGS press release Dates June 6, 2011


We believe a HOGS price per share of over $5.00 does not take into account the
probability of materially overstated net income or the possible diversion of capex.
Investors should note that other Chinese small cap companies with similar circumstances
have suffered auditor resignations, trading halts and even delisting of their shares.


Given our findings and despite the share price of HOGS hovering near its 52 week low, we
have initiated a short position in the company's shares.


Key Findings: Overstated Income, Excessive Capex and Deceptive
SAIC Filings

Based on examination of SAIC filings, HOGS overstated net income in its SEC
filings by 500% in 2009 and manipulated SAIC filings to ensure they matched SEC
filings


The pattern of discrepancies in HOGS' SAIC filings vs. its SEC filings is notably
consistent with recent China small cap frauds.In particular, SEC net income was
irrefutably overstated by nearly 500% in 2009 vs. SAIC filings and by nearly 200% in
2008. Moreover, when observing the separate 2009 and 2008 SAIC filings for HOGS'
Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise ("WOFE"), it appears the numbers have been
manipulated to match SEC filings even though they should not for reasons we
discuss in this report. In fact, our estimate of 2010 net income of $10-$20 million is a
fraction of the $58 million reported by HOGS in its SEC filings.


High likelihood of almost $150 million in questionable capex based on apparent
overpayment for capacity


Effectively most of the $432 million net debt and equity capital raised from 2006 through
the first half 2011 has been plowed into capital expenditure on a massive scale, with the
result that HOGS has been able to generate very little if any free cash flow in its history. Of
much greater concern is the fact that for competitors, additional or incremental slaughter
capacity (i.e., capex) costs are around $330 per ton while HOGS claims to be spending
around $515 per ton for current initiatives through 2012 which is about 56% higher
than the average of its industry peers, and already spent $682 per ton for its
initiatives between 2006 and 2010, more than double its industry peers' capex. This
led us to surmise that HOGS' slaughter assets are either highly underproductive in
generating sales or that HOGS is paying nearly double the price of their industry peers for
identical capacity. Even staying on the conservative side, we conclude that HOGS has
overpaid for its capex by over $150 million. If not in capex, where did the money
go?


Blatantly misleading investors regarding liquidity and capex needs


HOGS has repeatedly disclosed in SEC filings that internally generated cash and access
to lines of credit , "will be sufficient to finance our investment in new facilities, operating
requirements and anticipated capital expenditures". Despite such assurances, the
company has a pattern of raising excessive debt and equity ($432 million since 2005,
about half coming from equity) in short order following public assurances that equity
capital would not be necessary. (Appendix I)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 5/22


HOGS' excessive dependence on external financing has led it to become one of the most
prolific self-promoters in the China space. The company attends numerous investor
conferences promoting its stock and recently announced a stock buyback of up to $10
million. When management was asked on a recent conference call about the purpose of
the buybacks their candid response was to "increase confidence in the stock price".


We don't view buy backs representing less than one day's trading volume for HOGS as
adequate to boost investor confidence in the stock. In fact, the opposite happened as
indicated by the decline in stock price during the days preceding the call.


It's not what they say but what they do!


HOGS raised over $150 million in Q1 2011 alone (over 1/3 of current market cap). The
massive fund raisings will likely continue as long as the market allows the company to
perpetuate and sell its apparently embellished story. What does HOGS have to say for
itself? Investors clearly don't believe it!


Company Sponsored Investors' Day at Production Facilities in May 2011 Falls Flat
and Market Responds


On May 30 and 31 , when the share price was $15.25, HOGS held an investors' day
providing a tour of its production facilities in Tianjin and Change. In the first three days
following the tour, the stock price dropped by over $2.00 to close at $13.19 on Friday,
June 3 , a new low for the year. In response to the share price drop, HOGS issued a
press release on Sunday, June 5  to address investor concerns. The company also
announced a proposed share buyback of up to $10 million. Since then, the stock has
fallen another 35%, and currently trades at $8.6 (as of business close on August 15,
2011)


The issues that HOGS 'self-disclosed' in its June press release (after the investor tour) are
as follows:


1. "Zhongpin's gross profit margins are usually higher than Chinese industry peers."
2. "Zhongpin's advanced processes usually produce higher yields of carcass meat


and all pork products than are typical."
3. "Zhongpin's advanced industrial cluster concept usually results in more rapid


improvement in capacity utilization for new plants than is typical."
4. "Zhongpin's capital investment intensity is intentionally higher than is typical."
5. "Zhongpin has chosen to focus on high income markets and provide the highest


product quality and safety to its customers."

The answers to these questions were also provided by HOGS, and in each case the
company was somehow "special" or "unique" compared to its industry peers in this
very competitive space. Specifically, HOGS stated that it is focusing on "high income
markets" and is catering to customers who require the "highest quality and highest value
products". These claims are clearly contradicted by the location of HOGS' stores that are
typically in lower priced, open air vegetable markets frequented by lower income Chinese
in the poorest provinces.


Investor Conference Call - The More Investors Learn, the Less They Like (i.e.,
Believe) the Story


On July 19 , when HOGS was trading at $10.25, management held a conference call to
address 'share price volatility' following a negative report on the company written by China
Economic Review. The report questioned, among other things, the existence of HOGS'
retail stores. Management's presentation during the call included the posting of a list of
over 1,300 retail stores.


Upon examination of the list, investors came to realize that it was in Chinese only and that
actual store addresses were not provided. Instead, in many cases investors were given
names of entire towns or districts. The share price fell by more than 20% to as low as
$8.18 during the two days following the call. That price represented a new low for the year,
down by 47% since the investor tour was conducted in May.


Of concern is that the list of retail stores was posted on the HOGS website in a format that
could not be printed or saved, and even more concerning is that the list has since
been removed from the company's website. Now, we cannot find the list of HOGS'
retail stores on its website.


SAIC Filing Patterns Consistent With Confirmed China Small Cap
Frauds


In evaluating HOGS' SAIC filings, we took a comprehensive approach, evaluating the
SAIC financial statements of both the individual subsidiaries and the parent company or
"WOFE".


Consolidated SAIC filings of operating subsidiaries do not match SEC filings


In 2008 and 2009 HOGS had 13 and 14 operating subsidiaries, respectively. Two more
subsidiaries were added in 2010 and therefore are not relevant to 2009 and 2008 SAIC
documents. We obtained 2008 and 2009 SAIC filings for most of the subsidiaries that


th

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 7/22


were operating in those years and several, including the largest (39% of 2009 revenues)
subsidiary, were audited. Specifically, we obtained SAIC data for 11 of 14 of Zhongpin's
2009 subsidiaries and 11 of 13 of the company's 2008 subsidiaries (Appendix IV).


We consolidated the financial data filed by the operating subsidiaries with local Chinese
authorities and compared it with what was filed with the SEC and the differences are
striking. SAIC vs. SEC revenues were in line with SEC documents which dramatically
increases the legitimacy of the SAIC filings. However, net income reveals a completely
different story. We are willing to attribute some of the revenue discrepancies to
differences in Chinese and US GAAP but we believe the net income discrepancies
are just too great to be explained away. The cumulative net incomes reported for 2008
and 2009 by the majority of HOGS subsidiaries in their SAIC filings are a fraction of what
was reported to the SEC.


Of particular note is that the differences are not only massive but increasing. We can't
think of any plausible explanation for the disparities between the filings other than the SEC
filings are apparently inflated:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 8/22


Net Income $ 45.6 m $ 7.6 m 500%


EPS $1.46 $0.24 508%


*SAIC numbers used as the base values.


Notice that from 2008 to 2009, EPS reported in SAIC filings actually fell from $0.36 to
$0.24, a 31% decrease. During the same period HOGS reported a 39% EPS increase to
the SEC.


We need to stress that the subsidiaries for which we do not have SAIC files would not
materially impact the results of our findings. Given that SEC revenues are only about 25%
more than SAIC revenues it does not seem plausible using HOGS' margins that the
revenues from the 2 or 3 subsidiaries we did not obtain would come close to bridging the
significant income gap. In fact, assuming the missing subsidiaries could bridge the
revenue differences, those entities would have to earn after tax margins of around 18% in
2008 and 25% in 2009 to ensure that overall SEC and SAIC net incomes match. We don't
believe even HOGS management could paint such a scenario. For more supportive
evidence on why these subs should not influence our findings, please see Appendix IV.


Based on the analysis above, we conclude that 2009 net income was less than $8
million, in contrast to the $46 million reported to the SEC. For 2010, HOGS reported
net income of $58 million; however, we estimate HOGS 2010 net income as being no
greater than $10-20 million. We believe that the HOGS story confirms a wildly held belief
by ChinaHybrid skeptics that many U.S. listed Chinese firms grossly inflate SEC margins.
The HOGS case parallels that of delisted company Fuqi Intl, a real company that
embellished its story and fabricated margins.


Apparent manipulation of parent company's or WOFE's SAIC filings to ensure they
match SEC filings


ChinaHybrid management teams are by now well aware that investors are examining their
SAIC filings. US analysts and investors are no longer willing to take SEC filings and audit
reports at face value. They now look for corroborating evidence to validate SEC filings that
is provided by filings Chinese companies are required to make with local government
agencies, especially SAIC filings which are easy for US investors to access.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 9/22


In response to this, the managements of some Chinese companies are taking measures
to avoid the issues raised by mismatched filings by not only ensuring new filings
are consistent with SEC filings (i.e., by forcing filings to match) but by also
amending previously filed reports. We are not yet sure how they are doing this or who
is aiding in this deceptive practice, but we intend to investigate further.


What is particularly noteworthy with HOGS' SAIC filings is that while the consolidated
net incomes of the company's operating subsidiaries do not come close to
matching the SEC filings, the financial statements of the WOFE do in fact match
what was filed with the SEC. So, it seems the consolidated net income reported by the
WOFE is dramatically greater than the sum of its operating subsidiaries.


That is simply not possible and makes little accounting sense since consolidation would
result in less cumulative net income, not more. That's because related party balances are
eliminated in consolidation which reduces consolidated net income.


Furthermore, the WOFE, as clearly stated in SEC filings, has no meaningful operations. It
basically exists to aid in capital raising goals and receives cash flows, such as potential
dividends, from its subsidiaries. In the end, it would be much more convenient to
amend/compromise one filing (the parent/WOFE) than to coordinate the amendment
of many (11 or 12 in HOGS' case) subsidiaries. HOGS; where are the true financial
statements of your WOFE?


Given this odd set of circumstances we can only conclude that HOGS' management
amended the filings of its WOFE apparently for no other purpose but to ensure the
financial statements reported to the SAIC are consistent with what was filed with
the SEC.


We have seen cases where the parent company (WOFE) filed its own financial
statements with the SAIC along with separate consolidated financial statements including
its subsidiaries but have not seen another case like HOGS where the parent company
filed only consolidated financial statements.


There are other apparent issues associated with the SAIC filings of HOGS' WOFE that go
beyond the suspicious matching of the financial data in those filings with the data reported
to the SEC. First, annual inspections are performed by various PRC government agencies
(SAIC, SAT, SAFE, Customs and others). Those agencies require the financial statements
of the WOFE to complete their inspections.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 10/22


The WOFE is therefore required to file its own audited financial statements with the
SAIC. In the case of HOGS, its WOFE submitted only consolidated financial statements
and not its own making it impossible for the agencies to complete their inspections.
Second, as we stated, HOGS' SEC documents clearly state that the WOFE only exists to
receive cash flows, such as potential dividends, from its subsidiaries so it has no
meaningful operations.


Thus, the WOFE's true financial statements (which should not be consolidated) should not
reflect meaningful revenues or net income (Appendix II). So it seems HOGS can't please
both the PRC government agencies and US investors seeking to validate SEC filings so
they chose to please the investors.


Based on our findings concerning the SAIC filings of HOGS' WOFE, we can only conclude
that the 2008 and 2009 filings were revised to match the company's SEC filings and
deceive US investors who would take comfort in knowing the SAIC and SEC filings reflect
the same financial data. The trap management finds itself in is that they only amended the
WOFE and not its subsidiaries. We understand the practicality of forcing the WOFE SAIC
filing to match the SEC filing but when the SAIC filings of the subsidiaries are also
examined, as we did, the ploy becomes transparent.


Diverting Funds Via Phantom Capex - If Not Capex, Where Did the
Money Go?


Between 2006 and 2010, HOGS invested capex of approximately $405 million to increase
capacity by 594,000 tons.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 11/22


We estimate HOGS spent an average of $682 per ton ($405mm divided by 594,000 tons)
for its facilities which is three times our estimate for industry peer People's Food's most
recent facilities expansion in 2006. According to a recent Jefferies research report, other
peers China Yurun and Shuanghui spent around $330 per ton of new capacity in
2008/2009 - about $185 per ton less than HOGS plans to spend on new facilities through
2012.


Even allowing for wage and materials costs inflation in recent years, the difference
between HOGS costs and its industry peers are just too great to ignore.If our assumptions
are correct, we have to ask: Where did the 'extra' money that was supposedly spent
on capex go?


Following is a list of capex per ton reported by HOGS and its industry peers in recent
years:


Table 3 - Capex per Ton - HOGS vs. Peers


Company - Year Capex per Ton


People's Food - 2005 (Source: 2005 People's Food Annual Report)* $262


China Yurun - 2008/2009 (Source: Dec. 2010 Jefferies Report, pg. 8)** $338


Shuanghui - 2008/2009 (Source: Dec. 2010 Jefferies Report, pg. 8)** $328


HOGS 2006 - 2010 (Source: HOGS Annual Reports) $682


HOGS 2011 - 2012 Est. $515 (based on Table

*We only used 2005 data since it was the highest capex per ton instance for People's
Food from 2002 to 2010, offering us the most aggressive number. Consequently, this was
also the year of the most recent substantial capex project for Peoples Foods over this
period.

We believe it is reasonable to assume that no more than 20% of the difference between
HOGS' capex spending and that of its peers can be attributed to technological or
geographic differences and wage and materials costs inflation. The rest of the differences
are not easily explained.

Repeatedly Misleading Investors Regarding Liquidity
Requirements


Zhongpin has repeatedly chosen to raise equity capital in the periods immediately
following statements strongly indicating that it had sufficient cash on hand and access to
lines of credit to fund operations into the foreseeable future. This is a top 3 Red Flag that
we use to identify suspect companies. No additional equity capital was required as per
statements in 10K 2005, Q3 2007, Q3 2009, Q3 2010 and 10K 2010 filings, after which
they either filed a shelf and/or raised money shortly thereafter:


Q1 2006 - $23.1 million in preferred stock
Q4 2007 - $46.4 raised via private placement
Q4 2009 - $57 million equity capital raised
Q4 2010 - Filed for a shelf for $250 million
Q1 2011 - $66 million equity capital raised


Zhongpin's most recent misrepresentation of capital requirements occurred in late 2010.


November 9, 2010- HOGS discloses in its 10-Q for the period ended September 30,
2010 that existing funds "will be sufficient to finance our investment in new facilities,
operating requirements and anticipated capital expenditures of approximately $105.8
million over the next 12 months."
December 11, 2010 - Within 1 month, HOGS filed a $250 million shelf filing (over

*Making this number eye-opening is the $457 million that has been spent on capex
through first half of 2011.


Appendix I shows a series of SEC disclosures spanning several years, HOGS explicitly
notes that it will not need to raise additional equity capital. It then proceeded to do just
that shortly thereafter. The information in the appendix reveals that HOGS was very clear
in its filings to supposedly differentiate between when it needed or did not need to raise
equity capital. This shows that HOGS' SEC filing statements were not boiler plate in
nature and management knew exactly what it was saying.


Additionally, in order to sustain a multiyear financing binge, HOGS has devoted extensive
efforts to promote its stock. Zhongpin has become one of the more prolific presenters at
international investor conferences and has issued press releases indicating impending
stock buybacks by management and the company.


Over the past 12 months, HOGS has presented at or attended the following events to
promote its stock price:


September 13, 2010 - Rodman & Renshaw Conference, New York, NY
May 16 & 17, 2011 - Morgan Stanley Investor Summit, Hong Kong
May 23 - 26, 2011 - 2  Annual Deutsche Bank Access Conference, Singapore
May 30 & 31, 2011 - Facility Tours
May 31 to June 1, 2011 - 2  Annual World Meat Exhibition, Beijing, China
June 1, 2011 - J.P. Morgan China Conference, Beijing, China
June 28 - 29, 2011 - 11  Annual Oppenheimer Consumer Conference, Boston, MA
July 29, 2011 - Facility Tours


Finally, despite its seemingly urgent need for more capital, HOGS made the contradictory
announcement on June 6, 2011 that it would be buying back up to $10 million in stock.


Unrealistically Low Inventories Implies Inflated Sales

Hogs inventory as a percent of sales has declined from 7% in 2006 to 2.8% in 2010. We
believe this is strange since the business has not changed substantially. It would therefore
seem logical that the inventory as a percent of sales would not change by so much unless
the business has changed, which it has not.


A change from 7% of sales to 2.8% of sales is very significant, and is a red flag because it
is not likely they would be able to operate on such a smaller amount of inventory in
relation to sales. It is noteworthy that accounts receivable also declined as a percent of
sales over time. It seems plausible that hogs was reporting its true inventory, but using
inflated sales in 2010 to support the capex spending they have reported. This would
account for the decline in both inventory and accounts receivable as a percent of sales.


While it is possible there is another explanation, we believe inflated sales makes the most
sense in this situation. It's also curious that HOGS inventories declined in some years
where sales were supposedly expanding rapidly.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/287972-zhongpin-overstated-income-excessive-capex-and-deceptive-saic-filings 16/22


We view the HOGS case as a new and potentially more sophisticated form of deceptive
practices than we have previously witnessed in the China small cap space. We have
already exposed the more blatant and easy to identify frauds committed by PUDA, YUII
and others.


We are not calling into question the viability of HOGS as a real company, but rather the
company's claim to be as large and profitable as portrayed. We believe it is not.
Consider, for example, that the company's 2009 SAIC and SEC documents do not
match.SEC net income in 2009 was nearly 500% greater than SAIC net income. And,
adding further to our concerns is that we estimate 2010 net income at no more than
$10-$20 million vs. $58 million reported by HOGS to the SEC, so there are clearly issues
with the company's numbers.


We believe that HOGS may have also taken the additional step to amend the SAIC filings
of its parent company or WOFE. The company's SAIC filings are in line with
corresponding SEC filings. This ploy, however, is readily noticed since the WOFE, by
definition, should not recognize the consolidated revenue and net income of its
subsidiaries. Further, management did not take the time and effort to also amend the
SAIC filings of the subsidiary companies leaving the parent/WOFE exposed like the prince
with no clothes.


Furthermore, in the SAIC file of the WOFE, financial statements exist for only after 2008
but the WOFE was established in 2005. We find it very odd that we could not locate 2005-
2007 financial statements in the SAIC filing even though they should be included.


There is also the issue of HOGS' capex which far exceeds the costs per ton of its industry
peers. HOGS claimed capex for capacity expansion of around $515 per ton for its
2011/2012 initiatives and about $682 per ton for the period from 2006 to 2010, the latter
being more than double the capex costs reported by its industry peers. In fact, Roth
Capital recently dropped its rating on HOGS based on capex concerns. We note that
HOGS management apparently got the capex memo as the cost per ton for capacity
expansion initiatives announced in its Q II earnings release are significantly less than
previous expansions. The company's August 8  press release details three capacity
expansion initiatives that will cost an aggregate of $183 million and add 325,000 tons
capacity. That's an average cost of around $563 per ton, still well above the costs per ton
reported by other major pork processors.

Comments (18)


Finally, there is the issue of HOGS' inventory levels vs. its sales. In 2007, HOGS
generated $291 million revenues and ended the year with $26 million inventory. In 2010,
the company recorded revenues of $947 million and, once again, ended the year with only
$26.5 million inventory. How is it possible to generate more than three times the
volume of sales with the same inventory levels?


Based on our findings, we can reach no other conclusion than HOGS has consistently
embellished its story since becoming a public company and that its financial results have
been exaggerated to a material extent. We are therefore short this stock.


Our high end 2010 net income estimate of $20 million based on SAIC filings equates to
EPS of $0.56. Applying a P/E of 5 or generous P/E of 10 on this EPS estimate yields a
price target of $2.80 to $5.60.


Disclosure: I am short HOGS. Risks do exist when shorting companies where revenues
between PRC and SEC filings are in line, but diverge on the net income line. Such
companies still may possess some “perceived” value as a going private candidate (to
institutional firms who may be oblivious to the fraud case), especially if the net income
difference is related to tax avoidance schemes. Still, in the current environment,
companies that may have manipulated SEC documents have left themselves open to
significant risk. We will have more on the “going private games” and why we think PE firms
may be making some risky bets that might not pan out. See our Terms of Service here.

This article is even worse than CER. It only computes the numbers and claim new findings. Apparently, it doesn't
know that the pork price in China increases from 14 Yuan in 06 to 28 Yuan in 08, and the exchange rate appreciate
from 8.3 to 6.3, not mention to the new management and infrastructures. Using GEO's method, goog is too good to
be true to achieve such a high growth, isn't it? Facebook would be a joke, for it doesn't generate any profits in public

if you look at inventory turnover for the industry it follows a similar pattern to HOGS; it has to do with the pig prices.
When pigs are expensive inventories tend to decrease as they are now and when they're cheap companies build up
some, not much inventory as 55% of hogs sales are chilled meat which is processed and sold within a week. Also
people's food inventory turnover days have come down from about 43 days in 2006 to 19 in 2010. biggest concern is
however capex spending and why it is so much higher than its peers


17 Aug 2011, 07:01 PM


parry89
if you look at inventory turnover for HOGS competitors like yurun and people's food you see they follow a similar
trend. These companies build up some inventories when pigs are cheap and when they're expensive like they are
now and in 2008 inventories tend to be very low. Seems like an efficient way of doing business. Also HOGS is
concentrated in one province so you would expect their inventories to be lower. And 55% of their sales are chilled
meat which is processed and sold within a week.


So pretty useless arguments about inventories but capex is definitely a concern which we alread knew from Roths
report(Y)

If you are correct then investors would have a pretty solid lawsuit against Zhongpin's auditors. The accounting firm
conducting the quarterly and annual work is a BDO international member firm with deep pockets. I have a hard time
believing they are failing to perform appropriate due diligience to provide an unqualified audit opinion. Above you do a
great job of providing facts that are based significantly on speculation and guestimates... I guess if I was short a
Chinese stock I would craft an article like this too... It is the fasionable thing to do! Good luck with your trade.

There are lots of numbers and insightful comparisons but there are lots of hype and emotions in this report as well!
This hype calls for verification of the numbers and opinions presented. For example, some vagueness that leads to
misrepresentation is about HOGS shares repurchase program. The program was intended to show investors
confidence in the stock price – this is in every corporate finance book. Of cause $10 mills are not enough to beat
short-sellers but it was not the purpose in the first place. To tap into credit line from Chinese government for
countering short sellers in USA is no way some reasonable investor would expect from HOGS. There is also illogical
to blame company for attending numerous investor presentations in contexts of accusations for a limited disclosure. 
The article also provides lots of information about HOGS price action and presents it like investors response to the
company underlying business fundamentals and this is not completely true. HOGS stock price is suffering of
extensive shorting attack. It is not investors who sell the stock; it is short sellers from big banks with intent to make
quick profits on their ability to manipulate small cap stock using loopholes and luck of enforcement from SEC. Traders
at large banks have ability to sell stock short without borrowing it! They can do this legally for a short period time (2-3
days settlement) but they do it illegally for a longer time effectively increasing the float of the stocks. Basically
someone other than company itself is issuing their stock just to make money by propelling the price to fall! Here is the
link to the list of stock that have been short without borrowing them and this list includes HOGS: “The list consists of
stocks for which sellers failed to deliver 10,000 shares or more in the past five trading days and the level of “fails” is a
minimum of 0.5 percent of the shares outstanding.” www.bloomberg.com/news... 
My point is that the article is interesting to read but I would not jump to sell my position in HOGS because there are
ambiguities and some uncommunicativeness of facts or factors affecting recent price decrease.

Very simple logic, provided 'revenues between PRC and SEC filings are in line', the net income was audited by
auditor deducted by the all expenses, including the assets depreciation like you said the fixed asset was too high.


The data from Jefferies is wrong, the CapEx per ton is different among company b/c some company include the
logistic and others do not; Go investigate how much it really needs per tons first.


also the gross margin for Yurun and Zhongpin almost same, higher than Sideli and Shuanghui also People's Food,
b/c they have much proportion in upsteam produciton which is tax exempt. I compared all the top 5 hogs company,
there is no obviousely difference to gross margin, net profit margin.

This is a conspiracy to short the chinese food industry, the top 5 only have less than 5% of market, there is a huge
opportunity with the policy to increase sales of chilled pork to around 30% of total pork sales in China; they deserve

Also the EPS for Hogs of 2011 will surge to at least 2.1 dollars, b/c the 1st and 2nd brand are now experiencing the

in good quality.

In Shuanghui 2010 Annual report Page 34:

regurgitating boiler plate verbiage. When Roth actually shows us how they reconcile the differences, then they can
talk. Now for the truth... We published a legal opinion and numerous articles on how the SAIC process works. (Really,
in many cases the SAIC filing is all you need, but investors want to complicate the space and require more types of
proof).

SeekingTruth78
Let me get this straight. 
First of all, you are telling me not to reference investment banks while you referenced Roth Capital in your
original article on Zhongpin? How inconsistent! Either you believe Roth Capital or you don't. You are trying to
twisted the story by making use of their claims that agree with your story while refuting their other claims that
refute your thesis. By the way, Roth Capital merely raised a question about Zhongpin's capex (which Laoding
provided a good answer to that in the above), it was totally not the equivalent of a fraud call.


Secondly, in the articles you've cited, you were only trying to prove that SAIC filings of FIE were audited, but
that wasn't even my point at all. I was questioning about the reliability of SAIC-SEC comparison, not whether
SAIC filings were audited or not. You said "when Roth actually shows us how they reconcile the differences,
then they can talk." From that, I see you are merely speculating that accounting principles could not explain
part of the difference in Zhongpin's earnings. I can make an equivalent statement that "unless Geoinvesting
can show me how the differences are not reconcilable, they can talk." Actually that is a better arguement than
yours since you are claiming Zhongpin is a fraud, thus you must provide definitive proof, not speculation. By
the way, Zhongpin explained perfectly clear in their conference call that part of the difference was caused by
different treatment of a writedown in 2009 between Chinese and U.S. GAAP. What you have is mere
speculation based on an incomplete set of SAIC filings you've gathered.

Finally, the logical inconsistency shown in your article about Zhongpin makes me wonder how serious should
you be taken by the investment community. Here is one example. You claim in your article that Zhongpin's
2008 SAIC filing for its wholly-owned parent company was manipulated. I think you can either trust the SAIC
or you can't, and there is no middle ground. If SAIC filings could be easily manipulated, we must disregard
SAIC filing altogether because the accuracy and reliability of these filings simply could not be guaranteed. But
if we do accept that SAIC is an impartial and just enforcer of regulations, then the company's 2008 SAIC
filings for its wholly-owned parent company, which matched its SEC filings quite well according to you, should
be telling the whole story. Otherwise the SAIC would charge Zhongpin for false reporting, but we've heard
nothing of the sort. You can't just say the incomplete set of SAIC filings you gathered on Zhongpin's
subsidiaries is accurate because it support your thesis, and the SAIC filing for the wholly-owned parent
company was manipulated because it doesn't support your claim. Be consistent.


I am not even going to talk about store numbers and capex expenditures as they are already proven or
justified by other investors. Debates on SAIC filings remains inconclusive, but it is in my opinion that they
should be disregarded.
