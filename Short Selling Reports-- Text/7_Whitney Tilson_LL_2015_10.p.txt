Answering Questions About Lumber Liquidators
Mar. 30, 2015 1:04 PM ET54 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


I have no connection to Sunshine Park, Larson/GCM or Drury.


Tom Sullivan is grasping at straws in trying to link me to Barry Minkow.


Regulators appear to be moving quickly, but it will still likely take months before any
take action.


A response to Lumber Liquidators’ highly misleading and disingenuous statements
on testing.


Regulatory action won’t drive the stock to zero immediately; if that happens, it will
likely happen over time due to lawsuits.


How to analyze the tests 60 Minutes did.


I no longer read the message boards for the articles I publish because the attacks from
anonymous trolls causes me too much agita, but I do want to hear thoughtful comments
and questions so I invited my readers to communicate directly with me via Seeking Alpha
messaging. Seven people took me up on this offer, so I posted my replies on the message
board and wanted to share them more broadly here.


Question 1 (from Eric):


Dear Mr. Tilson,


I appreciate your effort of answering the questions that many of us have had. Would you
consider provide further transparency and give us some information about your
connection to GCM and its joint plaintiff Sunshine Park LLC? Lumber Liquidators had
claimed that GCM and Sunshine Park LLC are motivated by short sellers, but Sunshine
Park LLC had remained silent through the trial. Do you know anything about who is behind
this entity?


Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your answer.


My reply:


Dear Eric,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038656-answering-questions-about-lumber-liquidators 2/20


Thank you for your question. It's an easy one: contrary to the company's claim that "These
attacks are driven by a small group of short-selling investors who are working together…",
there's no such conspiracy (at least to my knowledge). I have no idea who the hedge
fund(s) are behind Sunshine Park LLC, nor have I met or had any communication with
Denny Larson, the executive director of Global Community Monitor, or Richard Drury, the
prominent environmental attorney, both of whom were featured in the 60 Minutes story.


I can only assume that the hedge fund(s) behind Sunshine Park figured out, as I did, that
Lumber Liquidators was poisoning its customers, but chose a different route than I did to
be an activist (by hiring Larson and Drury).


Question 2 (paraphrasing questions from multiple people):


Lumber Liquidators' founder and Chairman, Tom Sullivan, accused you at the end of his
CNBC interview of being linked to twice-convicted felon Barry Minkow. What is your
response?


My reply:


Tom Sullivan's attempt to smear me by association shows how desperate (and clueless)
he is.


This is an old and not-very-interesting story, but here goes: After Minkow finished serving
7½ years in prison for the ZZZZ Best scam, he appeared to have turned over a new leaf,
becoming a pastor and doing great work uncovering frauds. His original targets were
penny stock companies and Ponzi schemes - and, as former fraudster himself, he was
very good at identifying frauds/scams to the point where he became a guest on Your
World with Neil Cavuto as a fraud expert, was profiled by The Wall Street Journal,
Bloomberg News and 60 Minutes (how ironic, eh?), and received a letter of commendation
from the FBI for bringing something like 18 scams to their attention so they could shut
them down.


He ended up establishing the Fraud Discovery Institute, a for-profit investigative firm, and
some of his early work was top-notch, pioneering research on the multi-level marketing
industry. I thought the industry was (and still is!) really scummy and had a short position in
Usana at the time, so I signed up for Minkow's service, paid him $70k from May 2007
through April 2008, and he shared his research on the MLM industry with me. (I also liked
the idea of a fraudster turned fraud-catcher and wanted to support him, as I believed -
very wrongly, as later events showed - in his redemption story.)


Then his research slowed to a trickle, so I stopped paying him and we lost contact.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038656-answering-questions-about-lumber-liquidators 3/20


In 2009, unbeknownst to me, he began a reprehensible short-and-distort campaign
against Lennar (NYSE:LEN), the homebuilder. Lennar sued him, showed what he was
doing, and a judge sent him back to prison in 2011 to serve a richly-deserved five-year
sentence. (See Wikipedia for the full story.)


I had nothing to do with any of this, but Sullivan is obviously insinuating that I'm doing to
his company what Minkow tried to do to Lennar. This is, of course, absurd.


I am guilty of perhaps wasting my money and certainly being a bad judge of character in
this particular instance - a master con man fooled me (and a lot of other folks) - but that's
all.


Question 3 (from Ray):


"I value what you do and it is not always easy to be facing off an evil doing company or
entity.


What is puzzling to me is that why California CARB regulatory agency has not stepped
forward to put an end to the mis-labeling practices of LL or other companies doing the
same?


Is there anything that we can do to help?"


My reply:


Dear Ray,


Thanks for your question. I'm not surprised that CARB hasn't taken any action yet. My
experience with most regulatory agencies is that they take forever to take action, even in
the most obvious cases of wrongdoing. In fairness, it can take time to document
everything, to ensure that whatever action they take will hold up in court when the
company inevitably countersues/appeals.


I think there's a lot of scrutiny/pressure on CARB (and other regulatory agencies like the
Consumer Product Safety Commission), however, so I'd be surprised if there isn't
meaningful action in the next month or two.


Question 4 (from Clayton):


Whitney I was hoping you can comment on LL's quote on CARB, located on the third line

"CARB has indicated to us that no one in the industry is required to conduct
deconstructive testing for compliance purposes "


Why is CARB apparently telling LL one thing and you another?


My reply:


Dear Clayton,


Thank you for your question. This is a typical statement from Lumber Liquidators: true but
highly misleading and disingenuous. CARB doesn't require testing of finished laminate at
all (only the initial medium-density fiberboard, before it's made into laminate), but if testing
of finished product is done, it specifies clearly that it must first be deconstructed.


If you're interested in the details of exactly why Lumber Liquidators' claim that 60 Minutes
(and others') testing is "improper" is wrong - it's their testing that's questionable and/or
improper - I suggest reading a few of my articles:


Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB;
Lumber Liquidators' Campaign Of Distraction And Deception;
A Response To Lumber Liquidators; and
Explaining Lumber Liquidators' Reckless Strategy And Rebutting Its Claims About
Deconstructive Testing.


Question 5 (from Ken):


I see the issue not as "this test vs. that test" but whether or not there was deliberate mis-
labeling of product and if LL had knowledge, should have had knowledge or was complicit.


Obviously, the factory workers statement is anecdotal evidence.


My question is simply:


What steps are or can be taken to investigate the veracity of their claims? .... and are they
underway or likely to be pursued?


Is there any indication of what tests the mill used to certify the product ... was it
deconstructive?


Thank you.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038656-answering-questions-about-lumber-liquidators 5/20


Thanks for your questions. To the first one, in addition to a half dozen or so regulatory
agencies looking into Lumber Liquidators, there are nearly a dozen lawsuits against the
company (here is a list). Most (if not all) of these entities will likely get all of LL's emails,
have the board and management give depositions under oath, etc., so I have little doubt
that the truth will come out.


I've talked to many knowledgeable people, observed the company's behavior, and applied
common sense - all of which has led me to the conclusion that I've published in a number
of articles: that they knew they were buying (and selling to their customers) non-CARB-
compliant laminate.


To your second question ("Is there any indication of what tests the mill used to certify the
product ... was it deconstructive?"), the initial tests the company relied on (the only
required tests) were of the medium-density fiberboard (MDF) before it was processed into
laminate by the Chinese factories. There's obviously no issue of deconstruction here.
Then, the company tested the finished product and, contrary to CARB's clear guidance,
didn't deconstruct the laminate (i.e., sand off the outer layer). I discuss this at length in
four prior articles:


Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB;
Lumber Liquidators' Campaign Of Distraction And Deception;
A Response To Lumber Liquidators; and
Explaining Lumber Liquidators' Reckless Strategy And Rebutting Its Claims About
Deconstructive Testing.


Question 6 (from Igsman):


Now that the government has decided to do testing consistent with the companies view on
how it should be tested, the game has changed. Failure of the test will almost certainly
result in immediate chapter 11 for the company, as they would be ordered to replace all
flooring at their expense. I do not know how a manager with a fiduciary obligation would
be able to hold a position into and all or none scenario. they would be liable to for holding.


My reply:


Dear Igsman,


Thank you for your question. I disagree with your premise that "the government has
decided to do testing consistent with the companies view on how it should be tested." As I
explained in my latest article (Why the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038656-answering-questions-about-lumber-liquidators 6/20


Conference Call Portends a Double Whammy for Lumber Liquidators), there are two types
of tests, one of which involves deconstruction and one of which doesn't. Numerous tests
of LL's Chinese-made laminate show that it will fail both tests in spectacular fashion.


I also disagree with your assertion that "Failure of the test will almost certainly result in
immediate chapter 11 for the company, as they would be ordered to replace all flooring at
their expense." I don't think anything will be immediate - if LL does go to zero, it will
happen over a long time I'd guess because it's not clear what regulators will require LL to
do to remedy the problem, nor that the correct solution for most (or even a small
percentage) of homeowners is to rip out the existing flooring. If the flooring was installed a
year or two earlier, most of the formaldehyde has likely "off-gassed" and thus don't pose a
danger. This doesn't mean LL is off the hook, however, as these homeowners, if they
suffered coughing, bronchitis, etc., will still have a strong claim for damages. It's long-
tailed legal liabilities like these that would eventually bankrupt the company, not short-term
regulatory action.


Lastly, I disagree with you here: "I do not know how a manager with a fiduciary obligation
would be able to hold a position into and all or none scenario. they would be liable to for
holding." Lots of investment managers, myself included, invest in tainted businesses in the
hopes that things turn out better than expected - and if they don't, they don't (nor should
they) face liability.


Question 7 (from Christian):


I compared your data that you took from the 60 Minutes home model tests and compared
it to the actual tests from the 60 Minutes website and couldn't make them tie. Perhaps you
might explain in a comment how your 3 sample numbers, 268, 93, 57 ppb [from my article,
A Response To Lumber Liquidators], can be footed to the pdfs of the tests that 60 Minutes
posted. Thanks in advance


My reply:


Dear Christian,


Thank you for your question. It's a long answer, so bear with me.


First, download the tests 60 Minutes did, which they posted here.

1) In the folder named "CBS - HPVA Test Results," open the pdf entitled "1350
Summary.CA 01350 VOC Test Report_CBS News_1-5-2015". On page 2 of the pdf, in the
middle of the page, in red, under "Estimated VOC Concentrations - Flooring (μg/m3)**",
you'll see that the formaldehyde reading is 113.6. And on page 3, in the same space, you'll
see that the formaldehyde reading is 329.3.


2) In the folder named "CBS - Benchmark Test Results" (this is the other lab 60 Minutes
used), open the folder named "Benchmark - CDPH," and in there you'll find an 8-page pdf
named "CBS News CA 01350 Test Report 12WS." On page 7, about halfway down the
page, you'll see that the formaldehyde reading is 69.96.


OK, so now we have the results from the three California Dept of Public Health (CDPH)
real-world tests - the kind that the Consumer Product Safety Commission will be doing:


1) 329.3 micrograms per meter cubed


2) 113.6 micrograms per meter cubed


3) 69.96 micrograms per meter cubed


Now, we need to convert micrograms per meter cubed into parts per billion, which you do
by dividing by 1.227 (or 1,227 for parts per million).


(This number comes from the volume of 1 mole of gas at 25C (24.47 L) and the molecular
weight of formaldehyde (30.03 grams/mole). See e.g. ASTM D6007 equation (6); see the
middle of page 2 of this white paper.)


So:


1) 329.3 micrograms per meter cubed = 268 ppb = .268 ppm


2) 113.6 micrograms per meter cubed = 93 ppb = .093 ppm


3) 69.96 micrograms per meter cubed = 57 ppb = .057 ppm


Even the lowest of these three numbers is massively higher than the limits regulators have
set to protect everyone, including children. Here are three formaldehyde limits set by two
regulators:


1) The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment sets formaldehyde
limits of 55 micrograms per meter cubed for acute (short-term) exposure and 9
micrograms per meter cubed for 8-hour and chronic exposure. (9 micrograms per meter
cubed = 7 ppb, which is the figure I used in my article, A Response To Lumber

Comments (54)


Liquidators, when I wrote: "Lumber Liquidators claims that 'The emissions from our
laminate floors will typically only add approximately 5 ppb to a home when first installed.' If
true, this would be good news since regulators have set 7 ppb as the limit to protect
everyone, including children.")


2) The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, in another
document (see page 5), sets formaldehyde limits of 40 micrograms per meter cubed for
"No Significant Risk Levels (NSRLs) for Carcinogens."


3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards sets formaldehyde limits
of 0.016 ppm (16 ppb) for an 8-10 hour period.

jazzkool
Whitney, there have been a lot of comments about LL's profit rate not being highly unusual and the commenters
questioned whether unusual earnings should have been the basis for shorting the stock. Also, I seem to recall that
some expert of non-American descent advised you that LL was not complying with California's standards, and this
was another factor in your decision to short the stock. Is there any basis for the statements that LL's earnings were
not so high as to cause you to question them and therefore short the stock. Also, if you got info on LL's non-
compliance, did you or the expert share this info with the State of California.


If you have already answered these questions, please ignore.

It seems that you were pretty quick to believe that notorious convicted felon Minkow redeemed himself. Yet now it
seems that you are rushing to call executives with no criminal history "evil" based on junk science, regulatory gotchas,
and speculation. In both instances you were hoping to make money.


Perhaps you might be interested in investing in the prison artwork of Charles Manson? Some people think that he has
redeemed himself; others believe that he is innocent of criminal charges. But who cares about that? He's getting very

If Ichan was going to invest, if he was going to short the stock he would have announced it first. If he is long, then he
is going to buy all that he wanted to invest and announce it later. I think he is going long based on the current
situation, but that is if he is investing at all.


Good Luck.

Yes Icahn went long HLF when Ackerman was short HLF and I think that was more personal than business. I
do not recall seeing HLF in his recent list of holdings. Icahn has made a lot of his wealth buying the debt of
companies in trouble. If they make their debt payments he wins and if they fail to, he can force the company
into bankruptcy and actually wins by owning the assets without the liability exposure. Icahn has acquired a
few casinos by buying the debt. Buying the debt does not require the same regulatory fillings as owning
equity.

What raised the red flag for me when I watched the 60m piece was the visit to the Chinese factory. They went
there with hidden cameras to expose the culprits and they got every other detail needed in the centre of the
frame but missed the faces of the factory workers whose confession was the most important evidence against
LL.

anyone can pay someone in China to say what he wants that someone to say. Good luck with the court on

Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi Paul 9898


You forgot to think about the fact that if these Chinese factory workers will take money to lie (as you suggest),
they'll also take money to mislabel product.


Whether they take money to lie about mislabeling, or take money to mislabel ... both are money-for-lies.


So your comment, besides being offensive, proves nothing.


31 Mar 2015, 03:09 AM


crushedbyoil
Reel, "offensive"? China is well known for its custom of bribery.


I've talked with people who've visited relatives there: Everyone says bribery is common.


It might similarly be "offensive" to acknowledge Libya and Iraq are dangerous areas to invest in currently, but
it's also the truth.


31 Mar 2015, 10:42 AM

I think what Reel Ken is saying by "offensive," is aggresivly attacking one side of the alleged "allegation" of
bribery! The argument would be that it can go either way! Either way "it is what it is"....money for lies! Doesn't

help either side! If they will lie about being compliant for 60 Minutes the argument would be why wouldn't they
also lie for LL in the mislabeling? IMO I really don't think 60 Minutes would take the chance of paying off a
Chinese factory worker.

Reel,


it's not a stereotype.


To invest, one must be able to trade on statistical trends. It's cold reason.


Bribery is very common in many parts of the world. It is necessary to pay bribes in parts of the world, and one
cannot make investment decisions if ignoring customs.

This says nothing negative about the Chinese. China has one of the most incredible civilisations. Who could
look down on them? If anything, China looks down on everyone else.


Currently China is also known for its low quality products. Jackie Chan (out of a sense of Chinese
nationalism) publicly criticised it for this and created outrage. This says nothing negative about the Chinese.
China is growing at a rapid pace, and it has been an incredible success story. Facts are facts. There's no
place for emotion in investing.


If the polity of China continues to grow, it could become the dominant world power, though it will have to
adjust.

Hi crushed,


I know you mean well.


But you are slightly off base. You implied that these particular workers, for whatever reason, would take
money and lie.


You are accusing people you do not know, have never met and will likely never meet or speak to of a
proclivity towards crime.


If the "Chinese" qualification is innocent, I accept that from you. But, nevertheless, it is offensive to accuse
complete strangers of crimes based upon no evidence, whatsoever.


That's my point. You may want to mull it over.

Bribery in China tends to involve officials, not workers. But it seems fitting to assume workers would similarly
accept a bribe.


Xi Jinping has been cleaning China up, and I wish him the best. I expect any society growing at China's
speed will have its problems.


If you succeed in creating an investment environment here at SA where facts about foreign economies are
removed, it will result in fewer successful investment decisions. I know ethnic Chinese who visit China
regularly. I know for a fact that bribery is part of society there. I don't for a moment view America as better
than China.

If you want to create an environment at SA, where personal attacks against innocent people is the norm, I'd
just as soon call you out on it.


There is a big difference between saying there are people that lie/cheat and accusing specific people of lying
and cheating. Specific people, by the way, that you do not know, have never met, and have no information
whatsoever about ... that is ... other than they said something you don't agree with.


if you can't see the difference, I'll say a prayer for you.

Reel,


this is a ridiculous debate. You simply don't want mention of Chinese bribery, because it harms your
argument. So, you're declaring it "offensive" [to your bank account].


If you ban people from defending LL, I imagine you will sound much better at SA.

What case can you make that China no longer has a culture of bribery? Crying "offensive" is not an argument.

I suppose the tax deduction is false actually, but regardless we see constantly in the news lately about bribery
accusations, spurious antitrust cases against foreign firms, changes in local deals. When BABA went public,
there were concerns that American stock holders could eventually be declared non-owners. That's why I fear
buying Chinese stocks.


The environment there is not the same as in the US.

The corruption crackdown has recently affected Chinese markets. I'm pretty sure I've seen articles here on
the reduced casino and gold demand. Google search brings up Prada's and Gucci's profits as down from the
corruption crack down.


If you talk with travelers to China, they will say members of the Communist Party eat well and buy luxuries.
And they'll say it's possible to buy one's way out of crimes. Perhaps that's changed, but that's what I've
personally heard. The wikipedia entry estimates 3% of Chinese GDP is from bribery. The claim is uncited, but
regardless.


Perhaps 5 years from now you can argue China no longer has a bribery culture.

I have to put my two cents in at this point. I've been following this board from the beginning regarding the expose on
LL. As someone in the flooring industry I possibly have an ax to grind with Tom Sullivan and Co. How ever I feel that
Mr Tilson is right on in his assessment of the facts of the tests and worth of the Co at this point. The public has been
harmed and illegal acts commuted at multiple levels. Criminal charges should be leveled against Sullivan and his
cohorts. Too much to gloss over. SEC violations CARB miss labeling LACY act violations environmental violations.
Come on this bunch. Should have been called out way before this. Could RICO be used in this case ? Keep with it Mr
Tilson don't let anyone deter you from your mission.

You are absolutely right on.

Hi Foxyloxey, 
I agree! I'll even go further and say let's take Tilson out of the picture and then let's look at the bigger picture we have

lies and bad business practices and I've talked to installers who refuse to to install their sub standard products. I've
even read complaints from former employees who have left LL's because they feel the company has no moral
principles in how they train their employees to treat customers! And this was all before the 60 Minutes expose aired! 
Now,......I really don't care what Mr. Tilson's motive is, but he just put the icing on the cake! Lumber Liquidator's was
like an overvalued big bubble that was about to burst and Tilson just stuck the pin in it. LL knew a year and a half ago
about high levels of formaldehyde in their products and what did they do? They settled a class action suit out of court
and swept it under the rug. And then we have the Lacy act violations and now the mislabeling of their products. They
care about their customers?????? I don't think so! I feel bad for the employees that may lose their jobs due to the
business practices of this company but don't blame Tilson....blame LL. This is a company who is dishonest, deceitful
and unmoral to say the least. I have no position here but I think LL is finally getting what they deserve!

im with you whitney 
tommorow im putting 200k of my hard earned money and adding to my shorts 
ive made fortune shorting garbage.. and LL is a big pile of it 
lying to the public - completely denying the problem, blaming shorts instead of coming clean... this company will take

Foxyloxey, 
You are absolutely correct...."it is a crock of BS." I get the feeling that some people on this thread are thinking
....poor Lumber Liquidators! Mr. Tilson took down a good American company! Fact is....they are not a good
American company. I have personally had to deal with their BS so I know what I'am talking about. I've been in
business for many years and I have to tell you I have never seen a company with such a setup in which they
can totally exonerate themselves from any responsibility in all my life. It actually makes me nauseous when I
hear Tom Sullivan say how much he cares about their customers! I can show him hundreds of complaints
where his company didn't give a damn! And your right Foxyloxey.....I too am amazed that he's gotten away
with all the lies and cheating for as long as he has! Well, now the tables have turned and I hope he gets what
he deserves!

Hi rip2451, 
Do your research as I have and you will see all the complaints! I wish I could post them all here because after
you read them your jaw would drop as mine did when you read how this company has treated their
customers! I'll give you a place if you want to read some complaints.......go to their very own Facebook page
and look on the left side where it says "post to page" and click on it and then read what people are saying!
I've been following these complaints for over 2 years....before the 60 minutes expose! Then after your done
there, just "Google" "Lumber Liquidator complaints." I'm sure you'll have several hours of reading material.

CPSC mandate is to say if the products are safe or not safe and will not leave a verdict open to debate. 60m clearly
communicated that LL products are not safe. Being in a position to influence the public this makes 60m liable for
compensating the public and the shareholders for all damages from making false statements.


31 Mar 2015, 09:10 AM


HeadyChick
talk to any contractor and they will tell you about the slippery slope in dealing with the public. people complain.
sometimes they don't like their selection, after all. sometimes two spouses don't agree. sometimes the contractor
doesn't do a good job. sometimes there is flawed product.


I worked in retail putting myself through school and sold paint / wallpaper. I reflected on that not long ago when I was
picking some paint colors and my painting contractor REFUSED to offer an opinion. smart guy. expensive job and he
didn't want to be involved in a do-over if I decided later that I didn't like the color.


contrast those thousands of LL complaints with millions in sales and establish a ratio. most people don't take the time
to write glowing reviews but boy does it feel good to pound out a complaint. axe grinding is more satisfying.

Whitney Tilson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I continue to respond to questions and comments sent directly to me via Seeking Alpha messaging
(as I am not reading the message board). Here is my reply to one question:


Question:


elg38 March 30 at 1:57pm  
Do you acknowledge and can you explain why roughly 1/3 of laminate tested by carb using the deconstructed method
fails but no enforcement actions have been taken? Also, do you think this is a problem potentially for HD or LOW?
Thanks


My reply:


My understanding is that the when CARB has tested other companies’ laminate, the results are mixed. For example, if
there are three samples, maybe it’s .05, .08 and .12 (vs. the CARB standard of 0.11), so that would be a 1/3 failure
rate, but CARB doesn’t act because only one of three failed, and by only a little bit, which seems reasonable to me.


In contrast, nearly every sample of LL's Chinese-made laminate that I, 60 Minutes and Drury have tested (over 200 in
total I think) has failed -- and the average formaldehyde level has been 6-7 TIMES the CARB limit.


I don't think HD and LOW have a problem for two reasons:


1) The people I've talked to in the industry consistently tell me that HD and LOW have good reputations, very serious
compliance programs, pay the Chinese mills more to make sure they get CARB-compliant laminate, etc., whereas I’ve
heard from multiple sources that LL is exactly the opposite.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038656-answering-questions-about-lumber-liquidators 19/20


2) According to what I saw on the 60 Min story (in the shocking chart early in the segment), Drury tested at least some
HD and LOW laminate and it was well below CARB limits.

Whitney Tilson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  And here's my reply to another:


Question: 
Judicious March 31 at 5:08pm  
Hi Whitney -


Wondering if you were aware the Hagens Berman suit is alleging LL is offering bogus testing kits (the firm tweeted
$LL on this just a few minutes ago). I don't believe you've touched on this anywhere. How/when do you think this
claim could be substantiated?


Thanks.  
My reply:


I saw the news (BTW, there’s a Bloomberg story on it today). I hadn't heard about this angle -- rather, I'd heard that
they were comparing the results from their tests to OSHA standards, which are meant for the workplace and are
MUCH higher than standards for the home, where children are exposed. I assume that regulators like CARB and the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, once they confirm what I believe to be true -- that LL's Chinese-made
laminate is drenched with formaldehyde -- will demand that LL do proper testing with lower limits.


01 Apr 2015, 11:26 AM


Clayton Rulli, Contributor
Whitney, your interpretation of the OSHA standards are a little misguided. Since most installers are exposed
to freshly unwrapped flooring, much of which is freshly cut and not to mention includes saw dust particles, for
8 hours a day, how are these standards mediocre as you insinuate in your answer? Do you think the flooring
should be safe enough to be chewed on as a baby toy? If you knew OSHA like I do with other regulations, the
flooring standards are probably overboard if anything.


06 Apr 2015, 08:34 AM


HeadyChick
Speaking of formaldehyde drenched flooring, the Chinese company (A&W) that inspired Xuhua Zhou to accuse LL of
selling toxic laminate is selling flooring in the USA under the brand name, Ark Floors. Would you happen to know
what retailers distributes their flooring? (that might save me some time researching this stuff.)


Were any of their floors tested? With A&W's track record in China being the inspiration of Xuhua Zhou's accusation
against LL ~ how could this be overlooked?


A&W, parent company of Ark Floors, has been receiving funding by the Carlyle Group (CG). Perhaps you should
include CG in your list of evil companies?

Doing more "background checking" as per Tilson's request. Below is a link to another story Tilson brought to 60 mins.
He claims in the video that during the 2010 time frame the US was about to face a tidal wave of forecloses from Alt A
mortgages and that another severe crisis was just about to happen, potentially even bigger than the 2008/2009 crisis.


Does the hyperbole sound familiar? This second crisis never happened. There was no tidal wave of defaults.


As per Tilson's own suggestion please do your own homework on his background.

User 1056791
According to Dow Jones Newswire in late 2010, apparently Tilson defended convicted fraud felon Barry
Minkow after news of yet another Minkow SEC investigation came out. Tilson was quoted by DJN as saying
that he was "very confident Barry Minkow will be exonerated." Within six months Minkow was arrested (and
later convicted) for stock manipulation conspiracy. (Tilson was not involved in the conspiracy.)


It might indicate that Tilson jumps to overconfident opinions based on speculation and limited information. It's
an attribute common in tort lawyers skilled in demagoguery, not in successful, level-headed investment
managers.
