Are Herbalife's Nutrition Clubs Operating In Violation Of The Law?

Introduction 
As a longtime entrepreneur and business owner, I can understand the allure of the
Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) Nutrition Club. Distributors are able to launch their own
establishment with minimal upfront investment. Combine that with the assurance of riches
from their mentors and many see the business opportunity as the chance of a lifetime.


The addition of Nutrition Clubs to Herbalife's selling model has provided Herbalife with the
potential to dramatically increase revenue and provide it with its most essential success
catalyst-its ability to recruit new distributors and increase the retention rate of current
distributors.


It was no surprise that the clubs were a major focus for Herbalife during its analyst
presentation on January 10th. While Bill Ackman presented some less than desirable
photos of Nutrition Clubs during his "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" presentation,
Herbalife responded with a heartwarming video to show that you can't really judge a club
by its cover.


Ackman presented some of the onerous restrictions placed on club owners (as discussed
in the next section), yet in our opinion he failed to unearth what we believe is a significant
concern - the legality of the Herbalife Nutrition Clubs.


The Rules 
If you want to open a Herbalife Nutrition Club you need to abide by an exhaustive list of
rules and regulations. Yet, they are also sure to note that distributors are independent
business operators and that Herbalife does not "approve, endorse, authorize, guarantee
or assume any obligation with regard to Nutrition Clubs".


With that noted let's highlight some of the key points in the Herbalife Nutrition Club Rules:


1. Nutrition Clubs are not franchises 
2. Nutrition Clubs are not restaurants or carry-outs 
3. Nutrition Clubs are not food service establishments 
4. Nutrition Clubs are not retail stores 
5. Nutrition Clubs cannot post prices for products but may charge a membership fee 
6. Nutrition Clubs may keep inventory on hand and may sell product at retail

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 2/35


7. Nutrition Club owners must deface or destroy product labels and containers before
disposing in order to protect against counterfeiting  
8. Nutrition Clubs must cover the windows so that the interior of the club is not visible from
the exterior 
9. Herbalife instructs distributors that all opened products must be consumed on club
premises. 
10. Herbalife instructs distributors that any opened product cannot be removed from the
club. Following these instructions, distributors are given the false information that: "This is
a key differentiation from operating a retail location, which is not allowed". 
11. Herbalife's Nutrition Club Manual is 32 pages; yet devotes a mere 54 words describing
regulatory requirements, i.e., business, tax and health permits and/or licenses in
connection 
12. Open/Closed sign cannot be visible from the exterior.  
13. Clubs cannot advertise on radio or television


Why is Herbalife Concealing its Nutrition Clubs?


The aforementioned club rules are just a sample of the restrictions placed on distributors
who run Nutrition Clubs. Some of the restrictions are just plain laughable:


At first blush I thought Herbalife enacted the above procedure to ensure concealment of
Nutrition Clubs from the public and regulators. Good for Herbalife for taking all steps
necessary to ensure that bands of dumpster divers don't have an opportunity to find an
empty Herbalife product container, which could obviously be used for the illicit purpose of
counterfeiting Herbalife's products.


Well, there you have it! Nutrition Clubs are NOT retail stores or outlets. This is curious,
given the fact that "Club operators may keep product inventory on hand, and they may sell
their inventory at retail".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 3/35


So, just to be clear, a Nutrition Club is not a retail store, but a club may sell inventory at
retail.


Please note this exchange between top sales leaders Amber Wick and Mary Holloway at
the Herbalife Nutrition Training Seminar at Herbalife Extravaganza 2011: (note these
comments are made with the Vice President of Global Ethics and Compliance Frank
Lameberti sitting on the stage)


AMBER: When we say we're not a retail establishment, does that mean that
we cannot retail out of the establishment? No. It means that when we walk in
the front door, we don't necessarily want it to look like a retail smoothie shop.


This is a building where we do many things….it doesn't mean though that we
don't retail out of the nutrition club. In fact, it is that we want you to retail.


We don't want it to look like exclusively like a RETAIL smoothie shop because
it's not. There are so many more things that are done inside of the building. But
I hear sometimes that people don't necessarily want to retail out of the nutrition
club.


Well we do wellness profiles at a table, one on one presentations…where
people walk out with their program.


MARY: But they didn't go to the shelf to pick it up. We had it in the back, and
we just go pull it in the back from our cabinets and bring it out front and write
up on it and get em going on the products.


Herbalife explicitly says that a Nutrition Club is "not a retail store or outlet". You also "may
not operate on the premises of retail establishments".


But according to Amber and Mary as stated above, you can 'hide' the product in the back
room and bring it out when someone wants to buy it. It's clear that Nutrition Club owners
are selling product, they just don't want anyone to know about it.


The big question: Why would Herbalife go out of its way to conceal the fact that they are
actually retailing products from these locations?


It is in our opinion that Herbalife is intentionally attempting to conceal the fact that these
are "retail operations" because of the increased scrutiny and obligations that Herbalife
would be 
exposed to.

Note that Herbalife is also quick to distance itself from any association with the word
'Franchise'. From Jon Taylor, a noted MLM expert:


"Are MLMs franchises? Though many promoters refer to their MLMs as ―like
a franchise or as an―unfranchise- or even as a ―personal franchise, the last
thing MLM executives want is to have to comply with franchise disclosure
requirements, including a franchise disclosure document that could be
hundreds of pages long with financial data, background of founders, etc."


In one look at the requirements of the Franchise Disclosure Document, it's clear that there
are many disclosures that Herbalife would rather avoid -- especially point 19, which relates
to Financial Performance Representations.


While we are less concerned about the Franchise issue, Herbalife is concealing the fact
that they are operating Retail Food Establishments because they are fully aware that they
are in violation of FDA, state and local laws and regulations.


Food Establishments


According to the FDA's Food Establishment Safety Guidelines, a "Food establishment" is
an operation that "stores, prepares packages, serves, vends, or otherwise provides food
for human 
consumption".


They also state that "A private home, a room used as living or sleeping quarters, or an
area directly opening into a room used as living or sleeping quarters may not be used for
conducting 
Food Establishment operations."


Herbalife is headquartered in California. This is from the California Retail Food Code:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 5/35


Q: Can I prepare food in my home for sale to others?


No. In California all food that is intended to be sold to the public, must be
prepared in an approved commercial food preparation facility. Such facilities
cannot be connected directly to a private residence.


Q: Who needs a Permit to operate a food facility?


Any person, business, or organization that prepares, sells, or gives away food
to the public needs a permit…operator…must show that the facility meets
minimum requirements of the California Retail Food Code.


The picture above represents a typical nutrition club, where distributors serve shakes to
customers, prepared in a blender and made with milk.


Milk is defined by the FDA as a "potentially hazardous food" and therefore requires
stringent guidelines relating to the preparation and storage any foods served using milk as
an ingredient.


Watch Dr Luigi Gratton prepare a Formula One shake with milk (the recommended way of
preparation).


And, remember, according to the FDA, a distributor preparing and selling shakes to clients
from their home would be in violation of the laws:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 6/35


A private home, a room used as living or sleeping quarters, or an area directly
opening into a room used as living or sleeping quarters may not be used for
conducting food establishment operations.


Retail Selling Establishments


A Retail selling establishment is a fixed location from which a person sells products and
services; as opposed to direct selling (the model Herbalife uses) which is the sale of
products or 
services person-to-person away from a fixed location.


State; City; County and/or federal regulatory agencies impose numerous regulatory
requirements on retail selling establishments. These requirements include, but are not
limited to, business licenses; zoning approval and physical location requirements such as
number of parking spacing and fire and safety code compliance. Additionally, operators of
retail selling establishments must procure the appropriate retail sales tax license and remit
the requisite sales tax to the appropriate licensing authority.


I contacted my local regulators and found that opening a Nutrition Club wouldn't be a walk
in the park as Herbalife suggests. I was advised to find a location and submit plans --
showing sq. ft., parking, accessibility, fire protection, bathrooms, etc. If it met zoning and
building requirements, my next steps would involve obtaining license board and health
department approval.


Herbalife informs distributors (1) they are permitted to operate a Nutrition Club from a
home or office and (2) the retail sale of unopened products does not give rise to the Club
meeting the legal criteria of a retail selling operation. In fact, according to its Corporate
Nutrition Club manual, only the sale of opened products would cause clubs to meet the
criteria of retail selling operations.


Herbalife's directive to "acquire any necessary licenses" does not constitute clear notice
that licenses and other regulatory requirements must be met before a distributor can
operate a Nutrition Club.


Clear notice would be something like:


LICENSES MUST BE OBTAINED AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MUST BE
MET BEFORE A DISTRIBUTOR CAN OPERATE A NUTRITION CLUB


(NYSE:A) Contact the appropriate local, state or federal government agencies in order to
acquire all necessary business, tax and health permits and/or licenses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 7/35


(NYSE:B) Distributors must submit proof to the company that she/he has obtained all
requisite licenses, health permits and fulfilled all regulatory requirements before
commencing operation of a Nutrition Club.


(NYSE:C) Distributors cannot operate a Nutrition Club from (1) a private home; (2) a room
used as living or sleeping quarters; or (3) an area directly opening into a room used as
living or sleeping quarters.


(NYSE:D) Distributors cannot operate a Nutrition Club from an office or any other
commercial location until she/he has obtained all requisite licenses; health permits,
inspections and approvals.


Conclusion


We believe that Herbalife is intentionally concealing the existence of its home based and
commercial nutrition clubs. This is due to our belief that a significant portion of Herbalife's
home and commercial based nutrition clubs are in violation of FDA and local, state, city
and county laws.


We believe that the authorities have the legal right to shut down each and every non-
conforming Herbalife Nutrition Club in existence until the clubs are 'up to code' in regards
to obtaining the appropriate permits, licenses, training and equipment.


We believe that the average time for the typical commercial Nutrition Club to get "up to
code" would take between roughly 6 months to 1 year. This would lead to a significant
disruption in Herbalife's current business model.


We also believe that Herbalife at some point (due to its onnerous club rules and
regulations) could be forced to become a franchisor to these stores, in turn potentially
changing the entire business model for Herbalife.


It is important that investors realize the extent that Herbalife has gone to conceal what is
supposedly the future of the company.


While the legality of the clubs is not our only concern with Herbalife (please read our first,
second, and third report on HLF for more details), we believe that it should be a major
concern for all investors.


Many believe that the only legal action that Herbalife might potentially face would be via
the FTC or the SEC, yet we believe that the legality of its Nutrition Clubs should be front
and center as part of the entire debate surrounding this company.

Shorts have it a$$ backwards-


Ackman does a little research-> shorts stock


then takes 8 months to put together research for presentation to public on December 20th as to why they
shorted the stock


declares Herbalife an illegal pyramid based upon their study of 0.1 % of Herbalife product sales researched
on eBay (ASSumes 65% of SRP based on those 0.1% of sales)


Takes another 1 1/2 months to come up with 40 pages of questions so he can find out information to support
his short position


My comment: As with this article, shorts are trying to throw mud up against Herbalife's wall to see what will
stick and anything is open game because the real reason they are doing it is just to make a profit on their
short position.

Author’s reply »  Yes, believe it or not Mexico's food safety laws are fairly stringent.


If you can read spanish, have fun leafing through all of the rules and regulations.

I'm not here saying that Mexico's regulators would clamp down on those violating food or local laws more
forcefully than the US, but just note that there are laws in place.


Plus, there have been problems in the past with Nutrition Clubs in Mexico --including clubs that have out-side
signage. This does not replace the rules but it does show us that in Mexico, like in the US, Herbalife Nutrition

Author’s reply »  If you believe that Ackman did a 'little research' you obviously didn't read his 'Questions for

I openly admit that we are short, and have been researching and following Herbalife for quite some time now.
I am publishing the facts about what we have found, things that I believe the investing public should be aware
of. Especially for those that are considering following the lead of big hedge fund managers like Loeb.

Like most of the articles by shorts here on Seeking Alpha-> throw as much mud as possible hoping
something will stick but not really presenting anything new or definite. ****Are**** you really sure about your
short case or are you just hoping something will work?

Perhaps for now. These NC are a growing in the US. And many shop operators will lose their investment
when HLF is forced to close.

Shorts serve a useful purpose in the market, in rooting out the weak and indefensible companies that deserve
to go down. In Ackman's case the words 'weak' and 'indefensible' cannot be applied to HLF. Another thing the
market is good at is punishing huge short mistakes with huge short losses!


08 Feb 2013, 06:02 PM


LouisRenault
I read this article with interest, until the description of the ingredients sold in the Nutrition Clubs. It becomes
clear the the writer has never actually visited a club and ha s little idea of how or what is sold in one. This
same type of lazy, (no), research is also apparent in Ackman's original presentation - "volatilia ad sibi similia
conveniunt"?

Have everyone's job assigned by the government?

Cannon your way off the subject... I'm talking about nutrition clubs breaking rules that Herbalife set forth for
them to follow. I think they should be able to advertise, not have their windows covered and other things to
help their business grow. But Herbalife set these rules for them to follow so they should be following them
right? So if they are breaking these rules the company set they are in violation and are wrong.

Shortzilla...in addition to the issue of health and safety issues...what about illegal competition?


competitirs like Starbux, McDinald's etc. all serve "breakfast drinks" (smoothies, etc.) through legitimate retail
channels...


Herbalife then circumvents regulations to secure competitive advantage for market share...


regulation is as much about establishing a level playing field for free market participants as it is consumer protection...


I like the article...well done...

I operate a nutrition club and we do have a health and safety licence and we consistently Score 100% for
compliance.We follow all of the same rules that other establishments do and we are good citizens in our
community. Our Nutrition Clubs do not use milk to make smoothies or store products for retail and by all state
and local laws we are a legitimate Club. You are invited to visit a local nutrition club and see how great they
really are.

Any stock can be subject to scrutiny at any time by regulators. Look at S&P, JPM, and many, many, more.
Analysts can destroy a stock with a headline. Keep writing your "tomes". The general public is beginning to
think it's hilarious. Nutrition Clubs, and Girl Scout cookies. Sheesh! How many serious complaints of much
greater importance do you think regulators have, or do you think they have nothing better to do? Here's the
main thing, and I can't emphasize it enough; Government agencies will not be swayed by a small portion of
the general public, ESPECIALLY when "activists" are obviously trying to profit by the action. People in stocks
know about this controversy. The general public doesn't know that a pyramid is any more than a building in
Egypt. For the FTC to act on this would bring the house (and Senate) down on their heads. Senator Orin
Hatch (R UT) represents a state where the greater part of the population are MLM distributors in herbs and
vitamins. For years, the FDA has been trying to bring charges against them. Public opinion says NO. You
might have had a chance when this thing started. Ackman blew it, especially with his "95 Thesis" yesterday.
That's desperation. He's turning into a big joke (WEN, JCP, HLF). Are you going to continue to visit his "club",
Shortzilla?

Here is part of the Prepaid Legal Service story so you can understand that a lot of bad things can happen to a
MLM but it still keeps on keeping on (Fortune Hi-Tech is an exception since they may have had a commission
structure that wasn't legal):


Here is a link:http://bit.ly/VLoePv


NOTE: To make a long story short(1997 to 2011), Prepaid had all kinds of trouble with the SEC, legal
problems, etc. and with shorts attacking plus Cramer, Greenberg & more but in 2011 it was taken private at a
share price that was over double what it was when the short attack began:


In 2001, the Wyoming Attorney General issued a press release announcing "When we discovered that Pre-
Paid was using prohibited income representations to promote their multilevel marketing program, we warned
them that the representations were prohibited by Wyoming law". Pre-Paid paid $4,000 in lieu of civil penalties,
reimbursed the state for $1,000 in costs, and refunded $2,000 to participants who claimed to have been
misled.[5][6] In July the same year, the company was forced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to stop counting the commissions they paid out to sales associates as assets, instead of
expenses,[7] the same way other types of insurance companies do, though they did not release their
updated, halved, 2000 earnings figures until February 2002.[8]


Pre-Paid Legal has faced ongoing troubles in Missouri. After the company settled complaints in 2001, a
number of similar suits arose. The company won in a jury trial against two plaintiffs,[9] but after losing others,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 13/35


including one in which a former customer was awarded $9.9 million[7][10] settled with more than 400 others.
The company, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce of which Pre-Paid Legal CEO Harland Stonecipher is a
director,[11] have described the lawsuits against the company as "frivolous" and "abusive".[12]


Pre-Paid Legal reported to the SEC that less than 25% of its sales representatives sold more than one
insurance plan in 2005, but avoids reporting such information to prospective sales representatives.[13]


In October 2009, Tulsa World reported[14] that Pre-Paid Legal had been subpoenaed by the SEC for various
documents including those pertaining to a stock repurchase program that Pre-Paid started in April 1999. (And
in 2006, the company said it would repurchase $27.4 million of shares owned by executives.)[13] The SEC
reported that thus far that its demand for documents is a "fact finding" mission.


On November 19, 2009, Pre-Paid Legal announced[15] that it received a complaint from the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC). The proposed draft complaint alleged that Pre-Paid's "ADRS program and related
materials violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act regarding asserted misleading representations, express or
implied."[16] On July 27, 2010 the FTC ended its three year investigation of Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc.
without any action.[17]


Forbes magazine again in November 2010 ranked Pre-Paid Legal Services as number 78 out of the 100 best
companies in America.


In January 2011, Pre-Paid Legal agreed to merge with entities formed by MidOcean Partners, a premier
private equity firm headquartered in New York which it says is "focused on the middle market." The
transaction would result in the company becoming privately held. The deal closed on June 31, 2011.[18]


On September 10, 2011, the company announced [19] that it would change its name to LegalShield. The new
corporate name for the 40 year old company was said by the company to be part of an overall re-branding
initiative following the acquisition of Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc. by MidOcean Partners.


NOTE: I repeat-> Herbalife will get through this short attack and the share price will continue to rise (maybe
even from Herbalife being taken private)!!!!!!!!!!!!

After Ackman's public presentation last evening T THE "Harbor Investment Conference" attempting to scare
shareholders and - more importantly - to badger and cajole regulators to act, HLF is up over $1.00 in trading
on Valentines Day.


Ackman should have closed his short when his position hit $24 and change and the trading volume would
have given him the opportunity.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167481-are-herbalifes-nutrition-clubs-operating-in-violation-of-the-law 14/35


Now with more institutional and long-term investors "holding" the stock, Ackman NEEDS regulators to act and
to shut down the company or his entire thesis is kaput and he takes a huge loss in an enormous short
squeeze.


All HLF has to do is "survive", even if one of the regulators come back and tell the company it will have to
make some changes to its operating model to fully comply with the law.


HLF has dozens of attorneys working in their camp and they are more than likely pouring over the legal
guidelines to make sure the company is in compliance with the law. Don't you think?

I own an Herbalife Nutrition Club and I have all the necessary permits. It took less than one month to submit and be
approved. I was open in 7 weeks. The reason we do not have street signage and have our windows blocked from
view is not that we are hiding. If that is the case you could say we are "hiding" in plain sight. Rather, because we
obtain new clients not from a "retail" environment where we wait for people to walk in, but because we attract new
clients just like any other MLM person, through personal contacts, referrals and networking. You make this seem like
a conspiracy on the part of Herbalife corporate. The company is distributor driven and we, the distributors ( or rather
one savvy group whose success was then modeled by the rest of us) saw a way to have a place for our customers to
come for help. I still have to go out and make my business happen. Indeed, those that sit around and wait for people
to find them as if they are running a retail establishment usually do not survive.That is because they have left Direct
Marketing ( otherwise know by us as working a daily method of operation) out of the equation. .

Author’s reply »  Thanks for responding. I'd like to ask you a few questions about your club. Be as open and
honest as you like:


1. Has Herbalife corporate ever come to inspect your club? 
2. What were your startup costs in opening the club? 
3. How many daily customers do you have? 
4. What are your weekly sales figures? And weekly overhead/expenses? 
5. In your opinion why do you believe Herbalife demands for you to block windows and not post signage?  
6. Do you think its somewhat strange that Herbalife demands that you deface labels of containers before
disposing?


08 Feb 2013, 12:00 PM


Shep1789
Sure, although I would like to point out that all of these questions have been answered before on this site with
the other 15 articles written by Matt Stewart.


1. Corporate has never traveled to inspect my club but we were required to send pictures that show we are
conforming to their regulations. We also have had other club owners with more experience come in and tell us

things that should be changed. 
2. We spent roughly 5k to open our club with a little more put aside in case we did not immediately hit our
daily numbers. 
3. We have between 15 and 35 customers a day. 
4. Our overhead is as low as possible because the club is run to break even, we don't make any money off of
it and it is used as a tool to introduce the community to the Herbalife products. My money is made mostly
from retail sales and downline distributors who also use the club. 
5. Herbalife asks us to block out the windows because they don't want the product to be considered strictly
retail products, they like having independent distributors and don't want distributors without a club to think
they are at a disadvantage. I don't mind this because I can promote my business as so much more than just
selling products because we spend so much time on free events, like fit camps, and weight loss challenges.
Having a club though adds validity to your business because you aren't meeting people at your home or at
another retail establishment to sell your products....  
6. Yes, it is strange, but I don't consider this a big deal, just trying to protect the product.


08 Feb 2013, 12:17 PM

1. Yes, Herbalife has been here to visit. Numerous times. I have also given tours to Stock companies. 
2. $5,000 (I have all permits, insurance, and I am a Corporation) 
3. As low as 25, upwards to 140. 
4. Weekly sales? For Shakes consumption? Products?  
Overhead expenses? This depends on the amount of consumption. 
I have owned my Nutrition Club for 6 years, and the growth has been amazing. The benefit... we have lost
over 19,000 pounds in the community. I also own stock. And, I have taken Herbalife for over 30 years. No
sales pitch necessary... I have a wonderful healthy life. 
5. We can have a sign with our name on it. My sign is no different than others in my plaza. WIndows tinted?
Strange? As I view the businesses here in my plaza, so does the Accounting business and the Massage
business.  
6. Deface containers? I think that is smart business. Its a great way to keep honest people honest. No label?
You could not fill with a less than quality product and re-sale as Herbalife.  
My turn for a question..... Have you had your shake today?


08 Feb 2013, 03:22 PM

One of the reasons for defacing used Shake Powder cans is because there has been counterfeiting efforts by
"knock off" artists in several countries around the world.


08 Feb 2013, 03:47 PM

I don't know why anybody would criticize defacing the containers or making them unreusable. Seems
reasonable to me to protect the integrity of the product.

But, once again, testimonials and anecdotes about weight loss and efficacy of the product are all HLF
distributors can hang their hat on.........why? Because in spite of paying millions to nobel laureate's to add
credibility to the products, they have no scientific research or evidence that shows these products work any
better than any other products costing half as much.


And yes, I did have a whey protein shake today. bought the product on the internet for about 1/5 the cost of
HLF. Very tasty and healthy and a tremendous value. They probably can charge a lot less because they don't
ship 70+ cents out of every dollar received to some up line pyramid recruiters............... guessing.

Defacing the labels is really no different than designer clothing stores shredding expensive articles of clothing
before throwing them away to cut down on fraud. 
http://nyti.ms/WUVzp7 
http://bit.ly/W5RfCc


In the case of Herbalife, they have a brand name container, it would be very easy for someone to go to a
discount store and purchase bulk quantities of a similar product and repackage it in the Herbalife containers.
If you destroy the labels of empty containers you cut down on the likelihood of that happening.

Formula one sells for $37. If you purchased a similar product for $7 congratulations. It's either not not
comparable, does not meet label claim or near cost.

How is a "private" Herbalife nutrition club any different than a local ethnic club that serves beer and food?


Both do not hold themselves out to public / retail customers for their business. It is strictly by invitation, word
of mouth, or membership. No advertising or window signs. Shouldn't you be advocating for the closure of
"every" private club that serves food on its premises?


So long as the club owner is meeting the "letter and intent of the law" they are in operating compliance. And
since they are individually owned and operated, if one or more is not in compliance, it is not a direct issue for
Herbalife (the company). Herbalife is merely the supplier of the product(s) and product literature offered in
these private clubs.


Not hard to figure out.

Nutrition advice should not be given bt distributors!!!

@fat888 
You really need to do your homework before making idle comments about nutrition. Diabetics rely on
PROTEIN to maintain a level BGL. 
It's harder to digest, so it enters the blood on a slower level. It's not a "Dairy Queen" type of shake. :/

C Michael Croston-


Perhaps you sir, should avoid a field (dietetics), in which your knowledge is insufficient.


Protein has no immediate impact on serum glucose levels following ingestion.


It has no serum glucose stabilizing effects following ingestion.


http://bit.ly/YOiXUz


 
BTW, If a nutrition club owner (not licensed by the state to provide medical nutrition therapy) provides "bad"
nutrition advice to a customer (perhaps who has diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or both)... and that
customer subsequently is harmed by the advice (i.e. requires medical intervention for a high or low blood
glucose, or treatment for acute renal failure due to incorrect dietary initake) what do you suppose the legal
liability looks like for HLF?

one point. I'm happy to say my A1c is below 6 for some time now. My weight has gone from 295 to 215. I was
making a comparison of a protein shake (which have a sugar substitute in most cases) to the apparent ones
that were mentioned in a previous comment.

Foods are broken down to sugars(glucose). Refined sugars go directly to the bloodstream. Complex sugars
(carbs), are slower.  
Protein itself breaks down into amino acids and forms of sugar, at times. The digestion of protein can slow the
digestion of carbs, thus slowing the rate of blood glucose "spike" within the 2 hours post meal. I wasn't trying
to give biological advice. I was comparing shakes for cryin' out loud. 
Regarding "advice", there's a ton of it out there, much of it stemming from doctors that treat patients as cattle,
making diagnosis in 5 minutes time, then forgetting what the patient was being treated for in cases of multiple
disease. I've been diagnosed with CHF (15%ef) Diabetes, chronic gout, chronic kidney failure(stage 3) and
I've had two total hip replacements. The only reason I'm functioning was to learn, to take responsibility for my
own health and find what works. Asking questions of those more experienced can lead to answers. No one
that I know in this type of business gives advice. These are food supplements, not medicine. Anything beyond
discussion is against the law. On more than one occasion, a doctor said I wouldn't leave the hospital alive.
That was "bad" advice.

level distributors, who are conned into thinking they have legitimate shot at achieving financial success. They
then ship that money to higher level recruiters who probably don't even know the low level person being taken
advantage of. In other words I hate pyramid schemes.

Im still so confused as to how these low lever distributors are able to clime to multimillionaires in only a couple
of years if they are ALL getting taken advantage of. It must be a giant conspiracy and only certain people can
do it, man.... sounds like any other corporation in America where only certain people make it to the top. Kind
of like our friend Matt Stewart, who keeps writing all the articles because he is short HLF. Only Matt is still
listed as VP of RBC on their website. On average, they make 125K in a year, while the people at the bottom
make closer to minimum wage with no chance of moving up with Matt.

Mr Hudget 
Do you have another handle? Your writing reminds me of someone.


Just wondering.


08 Feb 2013, 11:48 AM


hudget
These low level distributors climb to be millionaires in a couple of years? Do you really believe that? Take a
hard look at the disclosure statements...........and if you are telling that story to the people you recruit you are
simply doing exactly what many claim is wrong with these schemes. Sure the very few in chairmans club
make something like 15 million each. Trust me pal, you and your recruits are not going to see any of that.


You are a distributor and you are telling new recruits they can "climb to be millionaries" in a couple years? Do
you tell them the odds that they are going to make it to millionaire status? Do you tell them that the odds are
99 to 1 that they will fail. That the odds they make it to the top are something like an astronomical 10,000 to
1?


They literally would be way better off mathematically to go to a casino and put it on the pass line and let it ride
about 10 rolls in a row.


this is part of the major problem with these schemes as I see it. You are probably an honest, hard working
distributor and you probably actually believe you and those you talk into the scheme are going to make
millions with this scheme. but if you recruit 10,000 people maybe 1 of them will actually accomplish that. the
rest are going to spend money, lose money, and move on.


And something else that really bothers me. Is that if someone makes it big with these networking MLM
schemes, and actually makes big money, it seems to me they only do that by recruiting and help recruit
thousands that lose money to facilitate their making that money. That is called a pyramid. That is what the
FTC needs to investigate vigorously and to protect people from.

Don't assume hudget. None of these short sellers have any proof and merely speculate. I never guarantee
anyone they will succeed in this business and I actually recommend that the average person NOT buy a large
amount of products before they realize whether or not they can sell them. It does take a very special person
and a very dedicated person to climb up in an MLM, some people have it and some don't, but remember that
it only costs 68 bucks to get started with Herbalife, not a big number. The majority of people that start in
Herbalife make back enough money to cover what they have spent and move on because they realize it is not
for them, and the majority would recommend it to someone else, how do you explain that? This isnt that hard

to understand, you assume that all distributors have no morals and use bs tactics to drain low income for
every penny and then move on without any proof that this occurs, although I can tell you from experience that
we care about everyone who signs up and do our best to help them succeed, and those that don't succeed
still come into our club and enjoy a shake from time to time.


08 Feb 2013, 12:31 PM

I am not assuming. I am responding to your statement that " low lever distributors are able to clime to
multimillionaires in only a couple of years". That is simply not true for 99.9999% of the people you and others
recruit into the networking MLM scheme.


Fact: Most (90% plus) lose money and quit let alone become millionaires. Statistically someone starting today
has a virtual zero percent chance of making millions.


You also say: "The majority of people that start in Herbalife make back enough money to cover what they
have spent"


Again, this statement is also not supported by the disclosure statements or other documents that HLF
releases. There is no factual evidence to back up that statement.


Once again, we see unfounded statements and claims being made to people. These people are enticed into
the bottom of a system that is going to cost the vast vast vast majority of them $ and it is mostly for the benefit
of the very very few at the top.


Read and review and truly understand the financial disclosure statements being put out by HLF and other
MLM's which will help anyone who understands these documents that this is a very low level probability for
any financial success let alone riches. Of course many simply want to believe and can't be bothered with the
facts.

hudget: "Fact: Most (90% plus) lose money and quit let alone become millionaires. "

1.we know these low level distributors ship money to hlf--extremely large quantities of money!! We know HLF
ships no money to them. 
2.We know they pay hlf for the product, for handling, for shipping, for sales tax.  
3.We know they pay ALL their own expenses 
4.We know they pay to attend rah rah....pump me up.... I mean training sessions. We know they pay for
promotional items such as tshirts etc. We know they pay at least $59 to join and have to sign a large lengthy
document-which seems odd just to buy at discount. 
5. We know anyone can buy hlf products on the internet for 35% off suggested retail and we know the lowest
of these distributors are only getting it for 25% off when they buy from the company.........plus all the other
admin charges, plus sign up charges they pay to HLF 
6. We know most non sales leaders quit within a year and many more quit after that. 
7. We know most sales leaders quit within a few years. 
8. We know the % that make money from hlf, and how much they make per the disclosure statements just
submitted by HLF. 
9. We know hlf pays hundreds of millions if not billions to distributors only if they recruit, and the vast majority
of that goes to the very few top echelon of pyramid scheme recruiters/distributors. 
10. We know the odds of making it to the top echelons for a person starting now is close to zero percent
based on history over the last several years of people starting and quitting and advancement rates 
11. We know those at the top almost never leave and those at the bottom churn to the tune of 90% plus. 
12. We know HLF is hanging their "we are not a pyramid" claim based on the huge amounts of retail profits
they claim these "distributors" are making. We also know hlf does not track these sales or profits, HLF can not
prove these retail sales or profits. HLF can not prove any retail sales or profit apparently. This is very
convenient for HLF when they track almost everything else and spend millions on IT every year..............it also
seems quite strange and as I have stated before that tupperware TUP can and does track every retail sale
and lots of other detailed information around the world on weekly basis.


So, we know a lot. They try to hide a lot. And a reasonably intelligent person can deduce from what we know
that the vast majority (I will stick with 90% because I am kind and want to err on side of conservatism) of new
so called "distributors" lose money and virtually none of them make any meaningful income/profit selling retail
products for HLF.

Let me ask you a simple question. Why would a non-sales leader buy any product from Herbalife, what do
they intend to do with that product?


08 Feb 2013, 04:38 PM


curiouser ann
They are not ALL getting taken advantage of. Just approx 99.8% of them, hahaha. Rising to millionaires...did
you actually read the latest disclosure?


Second, a hierarchical structure is not a pyramid scheme! What terrible logic..

much better than paying to be a salesperson for an MLM and losing money....

hudget
J2L: " Let me ask you a simple question. Why would a non-sales leader buy any product from Herbalife, what
do they intend to do with that product?"


I think those low level distributors buy because they are conned into thinking they have a shot at getting rich
and have been told wonderful stories about the health results using the products. They don't receive any
scientific proof of the products effectiveness of course because non exists, but most don't really care......a
good story about riches and health sells. that is why the high level distributors show their fancy cars and
homes and talk about making millions in a few years. that is also why it is so important that effective recruiters
lose weight and appear to live a healthy life style.......even if they have to starve themselves to make
appearances. Even Mark Hughes the founder, had to hold up appearances and I read was taking a lot of
drugs, etc to try to keep up his energy and image............basic... a big charade with a lot of self delusion
mixed in with group delusion. He apparently died of an overdose drugs/alcohol trying to keep the dream alive
and image going.


What they do with the product--self consume, give to family, give to friends, neighbors, anyone they think
might be a down line for them...try to get them started on product by giving it away...... all in the hopes of
inducing some of them into the scheme also........ which they are told by their "up line" is the key to success.


they also get tag teamed by their direct upl ine and his/her up line to bring a little more "support" to him as he
does all this and is encouraged to buy more as that is what it takes to make it big. Maybe they sell a little but
probably for less than their total costs. Stubborn and/or stupid ones keep reordering with constant
encouragement of their "up line" and keep self consuming and giving away and selling a little at cost or below
trying to build their "team".


Eventually most quit having lost money. Many also lose credibility and strain or severely damage personal
relationships.......es... the real zealots that can become very obnoxious when they get the MLM "fever".


That's my take anyway, ......................... you asked.

up, or if they would recommend the product or signing up to be a distributor. Then maybe we'd know!


If only there was a way to do that ...

I have listed fact after fact to support my thesis, HLF disclosure statements support this thesis, and you say
no evidence? You are just completely brainwashed, a paid troll, or incredibly slow.

Bravo C44, 
I too have no dog in this hunt but believe that it is abominable the way the shorts act, supposedly in the name
of saving someone from their own actions.


In the long run all these public proclamations against the MLM business style is an attempt to erode our
already fragile freedoms.


It's a slippery slope from what the HLF shorts are currently wanting to the government preventing people from
not making risky stock market trades or "reinvesting" citizens' 401k's and IRA's in to T-bills in the name of
looking out for the welfare of the citizens' retirement.

You are entering the bottom of a pyramid scheme. When you buy product from HLF as a distributor HLF will
immediately send 70% of that money to your up line recruiting pyramid. Your chances of making money
selling this product profitably at retail are virtually non existent. You are paying more for this product from the
manufacturer, or your up line sponsor, than you can buy it for on the internet. You will pay a lot of hidden fees
and handling charges and pay all your own expenses which are substantial. The company has no scientific
evidence to validate the health and weight loss claims, these products are not different than many others you
can buy at much lower cost. Most of the anecdotes you have probably have heard many times from the
person who just recruited you are false regarding profit potential and health potential. You have a 99.9%
chance of losing money. Many people do lasting damage to relationships by entering these schemes. Your up
line and their up line will become your "newest bestest friends" so long as you continue to buy product and
feed money to them for recruiting you and for the people you recruit. In effect, you have just sat down at a
poker game and you can not identify the sucker in this game because you are not looking in a mirror. Please
sign here and happy recruiting and welcome to the bottom of the pyramid.-

Ackman did raise this general issue regarding the HLF's so-called Nutrition Clubs in his 'questions' to HLF published
on 02/07/13. Your comment, however, does add a great deal of useful information to the discussion of whether HLF's
so-called Nutrition Clubs may violate retail or health & safety laws and regulations. Another potential legal problem for
the HLF Nutrition Club model is that some states prohibit persons from providing nutritional advice unless they are
licensed as "dietitians" (or a similar d esign ation) to do so.

I found a great thread dating back to 2002 - 2003 on ripoffreport.com that gives great first-hand accounts on how
people get sucked into and scammed by Herbalife. It doesn't matter that this was pre Michael Johnson because the
recruiting tactics and pyramid structure are the same. I had always wondered what those "lose weight now, ask me
how" and work from home signs on the side of the road were for.

I own a nutrition club. We went through all the appropriate channels and got all the permits before opening. We don't
use milk (substitute an additional protein product from Herbalife) and fruit is frozen so we don't need any other health
code permits. The business itself is privately owned but our distributors sell products at retail out of the club.
Someone can't just walk in and grab a product off the shelf without sitting down with someone, part of the business
model. We put on FREE fitness camps, weight loss challenges, have partnerships with other businesses who do yoga
and other fitness related activities and are known in the community as promoting healthy active lifestyles. Have you

Not short HLF. It is commendable that you are following regulations, but most dealers have no idea that they
need a business license, collect and remit sales taxes, inspections and several others as noted by the author.
That would sink most of them.


They dodge licensing, codes and regulations because this is a minuscule segment and the health department
and others have bigger fish to fry.


Drug dealers are a larger problem and there they are.

Well I appreciate you commending me for following regulation but everything else you stated is purely
speculation. Neither you or the author have any evidence that the way that I run my club is not the way that a
majority of clubs are run. I do know this, not by speculation, but because I've been to multiple clubs in my own
state and they are all run the exact same way and all go through the appropriate channels. One in particular
in our state sells well over 100 memberships a day and is owned and operated by two former police officers.

that serve some purpose in making things fair, competitive, and safe.


Want to have salespeople but not pay them according to labor laws? Get them called independent contractors so their
costs appear off your books (Internal Revenue Code Section 3508, added first in 1982):

So, are new "distributors": 1) independent business owners operating in many cases without registered
businesses? 2) discount buyers and hobbyists? 3) independent contractors? (this is how IRS treats them,
unless they fail for 3 years, at which point they are hobbyists) or 4) de facto entry level sales people, whose
inventory purchases, capital investments, and "continuing education" fees provide most of the company's
business?


 
MR. TOPOROFF: The Direct Selling Association, the typical members, when they go to sell their opportunity,
do they offer any kind of training or assistance? Is that part and parcel? 
MR. ELLMAN: No. And in fact, we cannot, because all the direct sellers are independent contractors. And by
putting training requirements on the companies, whether forced or voluntary, of the sales people, you would
run a serious risk of having these people characterized as employees

It has been educational watching the Attack by the Shorts unfold against HLF. Honestly, I don't see how it is legal. Tell
an average person who isn't an active investor about it and they will be surprised that people can "borrow" shares,
sell them, and then launch a publicity campaign based on half-truths and outrageous statements ("I will drive the price
to $0" and "Herbalife is a "Pyramid Scheme") so they can buy the shares back at a lower price, all for only one reason
- so they can make a profit.


What is funny and also sickening is that some of the Shorts like Ackman and some of the posters try to portray
themselves as do-gooders and impartial analysts, when it is clearly just part of their effort to gain credibility so they
can more effectively drive down the price by fooling those who are easily scared, naive or weak-minded.


They have been very effective so far and have brought out several "experts", none of whom withstand scrutiny and all
of whom derive income from trashing MLMs or have an ax to grind.


How many times can Ackman scream "Fire" and fool everyone into running for the exits? It seems like people are
starting to ignore him. I actually hope it works one more time so I can load up on HLF.


I am long HLF and NOT a distributor, although I buy their products and like them.

his Short position when the regulators show-up in El Segundo if they haven't already...


your ad hominem attacks are pointless...if yo are long...what is the fundamental argument? What is the
thesis?

Granted, many don't understand how shorting a stock works, but that certainly doesn't make it illegal or
unethical. In fact, shorts can provide a buffer for those that try to promote a stock beyond its underlying value.
Shorts will also be the (only) ones that will buy your shares once a company collapses and everyone tries to
recover a little money. In addition, when discussing the underlying value of a stock, there is nothing wrong
with assuming either side of the discussion (stock over valued - stock undervalued) In fact, the share price
reflects the "balance" of that discussion at any given time it trades - and - gives both sides the opportunity to
make or lose money. In the case of Herbalife the opinions obviously are more extreme than usual because
one camp believes in the companies "story" of great growth and income, and the other camp believes the
company is illegal and the stock has no value. I happen to belong to the second camp, and like everyone
else, I like to make a profit - just like all the longs and the other shorts, nothing wrong with that.

You're an idiot. I said that to demonstrate what an ad hominem comment is since you demonstrated in your
accusation of dhuddle that you don't know.


I believe that dhuddle questioning the legality of the current HLF's shorts actions really bothered you and so
that you leveled false charges.


You're last question, which you have asked before, equates to proving that HLF is not a fraud. That is an
impossibility, just as you can't prove you're not receiving money from Ackman to bad-mouth HLF nor any
other negative.


You demonstrate once again how ridiculous your attempts are for logical reasoning. Keep trying, though.

he creates a new one. At last count hes up to about 20 ID's which he tries to use to validate anything his other

alaintmypal,


I am an individual making posts critical of MLMs in general and I know that I only have one ID, and I am not
short HLF.


Note that there have been a number of excellent articles published on Seeking Alpha recently critical of
Herbalife and MLMs in general and they are by different individuals, giving their real names, who are not short
HLF, either.


Technically, in fact, I am long Herbalife because I have money in Fidelity Growth Company, the largest
institutional holder of HLF as of last fall, anyway. I also have money in Fidelity Magellan, which is further down
the list but also a big institutional holder of HLF. Thank goodness HLF is less than 1% of the fund in Growth
Company....I checked.


Despite the fact that technically I have money invested in HLF in the form of my mutual funds, I think that the
MLM model is fundamentally flawed and abusive and I will continue to speak out against it.

Powerskake says:

Just because they don't call it recruiting dollars does not mean they are not paying for recruiting.


FACT: Unless you recruit someone, HLF pays you NOTHING 
FACT: When a person you recruit buys product, or a person they recruit buys product, HLF pays you money
and your upline money. 
FACT: HLF pays billions to distributors who recruit and have recruited, and nothing to distributors that don't
recruit and have not recruited.


We know they don't pay when someone sells product at retail, we know they don't pay for training, we know
they don't pay for promotional items, we know they don't pay for shipping, we know they don't pay to educate
their distributors about nutrition, but they do pay when someone recruits someone who buys product. Those

Well the author was responding seems he/they went home. So I will restate the same question from above.


You attempted the same "self-serving" attack on USANA last year and at that time you announced your positions. So,
regarding Herbalife, a few questions:


1. Have you initiated a short position on Herbalife?


2. If so, when?


3. If so, what is your short position price (static or average)?


4. Did you set a stop loss?

why would a person pay 10-20 times more for a product that could be bought anywhere (gnc, super markets, etc...)
when these products are just as good or better?


what makes herb life products 10-20 times better then established larges companies like unilever, PG, GNC.


putting aside all other factors in this day in age of computers and internet where people endlessly search for the best
price for goods and services, how can you get people to pay for such premium prices for herblife products.


I own a retail store and people are comparing my prices with similar products on the internet everyday?


so can some answer me why would i pay such a premium for herb life products?

Jr that is a great question -


Unbelievable, and yet true. Why would people pay a premium for HLF products?


This is the kind of basic question that Ackman did not fully cover in his research. If he had he wouldn't have
lost so much money. Since you have initiated the question maybe your research will be more thorough in
finding out the answer?

Formula 1 retails in the US for approx $37 for 22 servings. I'd like to see a comparable retail product that sells
$1.90 - $3.70? They don't exist.


Now you know why its unbelievable - because its not accurate!

jr13284: "why would a person pay 10-20 times more ..."


Why indeed! But where are you getting your pricing information?


Even Ackman's presentation doesn't claim that.


Ackman's and Herbalife's pricing comparison is here:

Carl Ichan understands the business model enough to invest in $HLF to the tune of 14 million shares! Haha! $47 in
afterhours. "Mother of all shorts", he says...

Saying Herbalife violates the FDA is like saying a hedge fund violates SEC rules regarding the public sale of
securities.


You're literally missing the *entire point* of all the "weird" rules.
