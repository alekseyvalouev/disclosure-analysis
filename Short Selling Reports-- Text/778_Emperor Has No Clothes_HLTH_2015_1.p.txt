Nobilis: About To Fall From Nobility, Part I, 65%+ Downside
Oct. 9, 2015 10:00 AM ET153 comments
by: The Emperor Has No Clothes


Summary


Surgical center roll up with a management team having experience with prior roll ups
losing 90%+ of shareholder value; defunct roll up and Nobilis have the same
chairman, 3 CFOs,


Insiders have cashed out more than $50 million in the year-to-date period (~9% of
current market cap).


Accounting red flags: 4 CFO changes in a handful of years, along with recent auditor
resignations; potentially overstated revenues; newly acquired acquisitions with
Accounts Receivable issues.


Questionable marketing, with paid studies touting inappropriate success rates for its
medical procedures.


The company is significantly overvalued, and appears to be guiding for unachievable
targets; 65%+ downside in current stock price.


Nobilis | A Brief Overview


Nobilis (HLTH, TSX:NHC) (formerly known as Northstar Healthcare) is a roll up of
ambulatory surgical centers and medical services companies. The company owns surgery
centers in Texas and Arizona, and provides marketing and management services for its
own as well as third-party facilities. Nobilis has acquired various surgery centers, where it
uses its marketing engine to refer procedures to doctors who perform surgeries at these
facilities. The plan is for this marketing engine to drive growth at owned and acquired
facilities. One of Nobilis' key acquisitions included the rights to AccuraScope, which is a
spine surgery that offers patients a very short recovery time versus traditional procedures.


"The Emperor Has No Clothes" has a solid track record, and Nobilis' stock is likely
to drop in a similar style

Fear the Roll Up | Roll Ups Rarely End Well, and Nobilis' Version is a Disaster
Waiting to Happen


Roll ups have a recurring pattern of being bad stock market investments. The strategy
sounds appealing to investors as an acquiring entity goes out picking up businesses and
putting them together with the promise of significant synergies and cost reductions.
Investment banks and their analysts love roll ups as well, as the constant stream of
acquisitions provide continuing opportunities for transaction advisory and financings
related to paying for them, both of which all add up to rich fees.


For investors, roll ups are not nearly as attractive. Acquisitions give the impression of
growth, even if the actual businesses are not growing, or even in decline. Management
can continue to pay themselves handsome wages as top line expansion continues to
reinforce the market excitement about the company's underlying "growth" story. Even the
traditional earnings measures of the most conservative value investors can be distorted by
all the opportunities in merger accounting to shift expenses and pad post-acquisition
results. Synergy realizations are rare, and are more often than not unlikely to be realized.


A Team with Well-Catalogued Experiences of Failure


Management teams of public companies often give comfort to investors in their stocks by
listing a history of successes at prior companies and with experience in the underlying
industry. As a result, stockholders can hang their hats on the likelihood of success based
on management's skills and history of success. Nobilis' management does not follow this
pattern, as it has no successes, as far as I can see, that resulted in any creation of
shareholder value.


One would expect to see a recurring pattern in the backgrounds of a management team
for a medical company to have lots of like experiences in the medical industry. But Nobilis
has a different pattern. Instead, we see a common background in a company called Acro
Energy Technologies.

Acro was not a successful medical company that trained future leaders of the industry.
Instead, it was a failed company in the solar industry. But while it was not in the actual
business of medicine, it was a roll up. And a great example of why roll ups are such a
dangerous animal for investors.


Current Nobilis chairman of the Board, Harry Fleming, was Acro Energy's founder and
chairman. He tells us all about his plan for Acro in a July 2009 interview. Harry explained
that "a couple of years ago, we formed a shell, and we took it public on the Toronto stock
exchange. The reason we did this, we wanted a vehicle to roll in other integrators
throughout the country."


After noting that he didn't really have any background in the solar industry, he confidently
stated: "we saw an opportunity. We think it's really going to take off even more than it has
the last two years. And the market's really being driven by the Chinese panel
manufacturers that are day-to-day driving down prices, which really is going to make this a
mainstream product starting in the year 2010".


He further exclaimed: "and we can really take advantage of what we see is going to be a
just tidal wave of business as we hit the year 2010. So we want to get as big a footprint as
we can to really take advantage of the huge increase in business that we're seeing".


The tidal wave did not work out like Harry expected, as we see that in February 2013,
Acro Energy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. And investors were not the only ones who
suffered in this roll up. A poster claiming to be a former Acro Energy employee responded
to Harry's 2009 interview by saying: "Harry Fleming is a disgrace to the state of Texas…If
you are contemplating doing any business with Harry Fleming, my only words are... don't
do it" (Source: The BusinessMakers).

In the case of Nobilis , the company has guided to having picked up undervalued and
bankrupt assets. But with this management team and these assets, this story is likely to
end very badly. However, the reality is that these assets were undervalued and bankrupt
for a reason. If the underlying acquisitions are garbage, accumulating various acquisitions
just yields a larger pile of garbage (Source: Bloomberg).


Out of the above noted acquisitions, Athas is the largest, and will be well documented
throughout the rest of this report. The Victory Plano & Healthcare acquisitions come from
a bankruptcy on the back of inability to collect accounts receivable, and Nobilis seems just
as unlikely to change this reality. The third largest acquisition, First Nobilis, was formerly
public and fell over 80% due to lawsuits against the company.


Nobilis (NHC, HLTH) is the Same Story as Acro Energy, and is Likely to Follow in the
Same Failed Footsteps


We have already seen the striking overlap of management between Nobilis and Acro. But
the similarities go even further. Just like Acro, Nobilis is based in Houston, Texas. And just
like Acro, it listed on the Canadian exchange, despite having no business operations in
Canada. And just like Acro, Nobilis chose Calvettii Ferguson & Wagner, a small
accounting firm with limited public company experience, to be its auditor. But the one
minor difference is that unlike Acro, Nobilis jumped on the scene with a bang.


In May 2007, Nobilis (named Northstar Healthcare at that time) went public with a ~$150
million IPO. Just like Acro Energy, Nobilis was planned to be a roll up, although this time it
chose ambulatory surgical centers as the place to find a new "tidal wave of business".
Donald Kramer started out as the CEO of Northstar, and showed every bit as much talent
as Harry Fleming. With fresh investor money burning a hole in his pocket, Kramer quickly
purchased 55% interest in the Palladium for Surgery and 60% in Medical Ambulatory
Surgical Suites. It is pretty interesting to note that Palladium was an asset that was

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 5/68


already partially owned by Kramer, so he basically paid both himself and his partners a
significant sum of money using shareholder cash (there has got to be some kind of related
party issue here, but we will get to that in a moment). But just as fast as they were
purchased, Northstar's two acquired assets were performing poorly, and the stock price
followed suit. Inside a year and a half, Northstar wrote off $131 million of the acquired
assets (through a hit to goodwill and intangibles).


This was followed by Kramer being kicked to the curb from his CEO position. He was also
concurrently served with a lawsuit by Northstar. Presumably afraid of the suit, Kramer
participated in an emergency financing by Northstar (easy, as it had no other shareholder
demand for its shares) and regained control of Northstar. And, of course, he immediately
squashed the lawsuit against himself and sold the remaining portion of Palladium into
Northstar, which shortly thereafter went bankrupt (Source: TheStreet). Suffice to say that
Kramer proved very adept at making money for himself, even if his shareholders did not
fare as well. In the end, Northstar's share value fell over 90% the first time Kramer was at
the helm (the stock price achieved highs of $19.26, before trading below $1; Source:
Bloomberg).


Unlike Acro, Northstar had enough money to stay alive (barely), but due to declining sales,
the stock languished below $1 for five years, and management was in need of a miracle.
Fortunately, they found someone in the miracle business.


Selling Miracles | Enter Lawrence Rothstein and Athas

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 6/68


Our story now turns to anesthesiologist Lawrence Rothstein. In 2001, he lost his medical
license for the first (but not the last) time: "Rothstein's medical license had been
suspended by the state of Ohio in 2001, medical board records stated, after his arrest for
possession of cocaine. It was reinstated after he underwent rehab and attended AA
meetings". (Source: The Dallas Morning News)


Despite his obvious affinity for the pharmaceutical side of medicine, Rothstein proved to
be amazingly energetic, and decided to pursue advances in surgery. Although not actually
a surgeon, he developed a minimally invasive spine surgery, which was ultimately
trademarked as AccuraScope. This procedure offered patients a treatment that seemed
miraculous. The procedure involved entry through the base of the spine with an
endoscope, followed by moving up the spinal canal to work on disks and burn off nerves
with a tiny laser; it did not cut through muscle or bones like traditional back surgery, and
thus, had greatly reduced recovery time. Further, since it involved using a laser, it naturally
sounded advanced. These features resonated as a very marketable product. The allure of
the outpatient procedure made it quite marketable and was soon discovered by someone
else in the miracle business, Joe Sam Bailey.


Joe Sam Bailey was a Baptist preacher who claimed to have a Ph.D. in theology (but from
an unaccredited university). Joe heard about Rothstein's miracle procedure and went to
visit and observe the magic. He quickly understood the marketing potential of the
procedure and phoned business partner Chris Lloyd to tell him the good news. Bailey,
Lloyd and Rothstein soon formed a company called North American Spine.


North American Spine performed no surgeries, but took a cut for focusing on the
marketing of the surgery. The company marketed this using online ads and celebrity
endorsements. It also used seminars, led by Joe Sam Bailey, to convince patients that this
miracle surgery would cure their chronic back pain quickly and with very little pain or
recovery time. Once potential patients were hooked, North American Spine would refer
them to anesthesiologists and "pain management specialists" to perform the surgery.
While the sales pitch of cured chronic back pain was easy, the reality could be very
different.


Normally, spinal surgery is performed by orthopedic surgeons who specialize in the
musculoskeletal system, or by neurosurgeons who specialize in the nervous system. Both
of these specialties require years of training and experience with the components that
make up the very complicated and highly vulnerable spine. Yet, other doctors, such as
anesthesiologists, have pursued this area of practice and have capitalized on the promise

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 7/68


of a simple-sounding surgery to relieve pain. From the early stages of the emergence of
these procedures, prestigious institutions, such as the Mayo Clinic, have warned of the
risks involved: "At Mayo Clinic, we don't use or recommend laser spine surgery".


Other sources describes issues with the procedure as follows: "Complications stemming
from the Accurascope DND include but are not limited to permanent nerve damage, pain,
weakness, numbness, paralysis, and incontinence". Whilst using this surgery, Rothstein
accumulated over 40 malpractice lawsuits against him. He settled lawsuits at $5 million
and $1.4 million where "judgment [was served] after a jury found he performed a surgical
procedure that permanently maimed a patient". The $5 million judgement was settlement
where the patient suffered brain damage.


After settling a few lawsuits, Rothstein inevitably disappeared, but not before filing for
bankruptcy to avoid having to deal with his remaining malpractice suits. He also lost his
medical license for a second time, and this time for good, on April 9, 2013 (Source: State
Medical Board of Ohio). The document justifies revoking his license, because "from in or
about 2002 to in or about April 2009, you undertook the care of Patients…you
inappropriately utilized laser endoscopic technique, performed procedures that were not
medically indicated and/or were clinically contraindicated, and/or failed to provide
appropriate follow-up care".


The Big Sale | Athas Sold for 26x its Prior Price


Despite the fall of AccuraScope's developer and founder, North American Spine's two
other founders were undeterred. Though their entity, Athas, had purchased North
American Spine's facility for a measly $1.3 million, they were able to sell Athas to
Nobilis for $34 million less than 24 months later. North American Spine has
relationships with physicians and facilities, and refers patients through its marketing
channel to both physicians and facilities. No sale of a questionable spinal procedure to a
patient who does not need it could ever be as impressive as the sale of Athas for 26x the
price it was valued at less than 24 months earlier (note that there appears to be no major
change in financials or operations over this time). Nobilis shareholders may have been
deceived (or maybe just desperate) in this transaction, but the dynamic marketing duo of
Lloyd and Bailey were able to pull off another miracle, but as you would expect, only for
their benefit.


And despite the departure of Rothstein, problems with AccuraScope continue to be
reported. In a September 11, 2015 article, we learn about a family that is suing North
American Spine for their father's death as a result of a surgery at its facility, where spinal

fluid leaked through his body to his brain. Here is a key expose which illustrates just how
bad North American Spine is. In summary, it appears that North American Spine might be
overcharging for its surgeries, and the article further demonstrates that patients' lives are
being ruined, but surgeries continue to be performed by anaesthesiologists (not surgeons,
which appears wrong given the experimental nature of the surgery, and its very
questionable results). The company has been sued on the basis that "There has been no
reliable testing of [the] surgery to show that it is a medically valid procedure, nor what the
associated complication rate is". Online reviews of this experimental surgery are
questionable, at best, and some describe it as terrible (Source: ComplaintsBoard). The
results of the AccuraScope surgery have not changed even with other doctors performing
the surgery.


Not only was Chris Lloyd rewarded with a very large payout from Athas (at the cost of
Nobilis shareholders), he was even given the position of CEO in the new company so he
could continue the roll up strategy created by his new friends Harry Fleming and Donald
Kramer, both of whom relinquished their positions in Nobilis as quickly as they could. Chris
has continued his marketing strategy at Nobilis, and the stock price of is thriving for now.
Despite this reprieve, the fundamental basis of the company seems very shaky, and I think
this too shall pass. The first sign of this is key insiders selling one-third of their holdings in
the year-to-date period.


The Little Sales That Are Not So Cute


At North American Spine, Joe Sam Bailey would hold seminars touting his education
(Ph.D), in addition to touting AccuraScope success rates, despite his unaccredited
education in Theology and questionable success rate data. An extract from a lawsuit
against the company illustrates that North American Spine exaggerated success rates -
Nicholas Vanderburg (Plaintiff) vs. Defendants (Riverview Health, Lawrence Rothstein,
Steven Rothstein and Dayton Laser Spine), paragraph 40: "Thereafter, on or about June
23, 2009, Nicholas Vanderburg contacted North American Spine and received information
for his review. During his telephone conversation, Vanderburg was assured that the
procedure was safe, he would have no down time and it was about one hundred (100%)
effective".


First and foremost, per this source, the company itself appears to have stated that
success rates are difficult, as the studies are difficult: "as with other types of minimally
invasive spine surgery, no such trials have been done for the AccuraScope. 'Doctors don't
like to do them,' Wells said. 'Secondly, those are massively expensive." Now, there are
multiple holes to poke in this statement, the first of which is that if trials have not been

done, how does Nobilis continue to put out success rates? Further, if studies have not
been done, would it not be in Nobilis' interest to sponsor a study? Now, if it has not, does
that imply that the company is scared of the results or unwilling to find out?


However, Nobilis continues with the Athas style of publishing success rates. As of its April
7, 2015 press release, the company said: "Medical research has shown that the
AccuraScope procedure has an 82% success rate and saves patients an average of
$23,190 in out-of-pocket costs over 5 years by reducing expenses including medical visits
and medications." In this article written by Doug Swan, he references five studies that
North American Spine previously used as sources: one was written by Rothstein and a
related doctor, another was once again written by a doctor related to North American
Spine (Dr. Kenneth Alo), the third is of current trends in the industry, the fourth is a Korean
report which Dr. Alo was once again linked to, and the final study had nothing to do with
North American Spine-like procedures. This all begs the question of how Nobilis is still
standing by the 82% success rate noted in the April 7, 2015 press release.


Once again, Doug Swanson catches North American Spine with misleading statements,
given the company claims to have been vetted by a major university, when in fact, it was
not. See the following quotes: "Last year, North American Spine sought to have a judge
stop a Florida woman from complaining about the AccuraScope procedure on a website.
In its petition, the company said the AccuraScope is 'the only minimally invasive procedure
vetted by a major university (Louisiana State University) establishing both the procedure's
efficacy as well as its overall cost savings'... This was a reference to Erich Richter, who
formerly taught at LSU. He disputes the company's assertion. 'It is not vetted or
approved by LSU,' he said. 'There was no study by LSU.' Nor has there been a study
by West Virginia University, where Richter now teaches".


But not to worry, although Athas was acquired for its marketing prowess, it was missing an
integral piece, and that was resolved on April 29, 2015, when Nobilis entered into an
agreement with Renew Spinal Care. Renew Spinal is effectively a marketing firm and run
by Joe Sam Bailey. "Nobilis is excited to work with the innovative marketing team at
Renew. Renew currently operates in Texas and Florida as it contemplates expansion into
strategic markets nationwide,' said Chris Lloyd, CEO of Nobilis".


Who is paying for this?


For a surgery that is supposed to cost $25-30k, it is pretty unbelievable that there are
cases where it has cost $94,000 and $90,176 in certain cases, especially for an outpatient
procedure, which typically lasts 45 minutes. A Bloomberg article also highlights that a 45-

minute surgery by an anaesthesiologist cost $95k in some cases - seems a little
excessive, if you ask me. And this patient's surgery had poor results, just like the rest, as
they exclaimed "this has just devastated my life".


From what I have found, most of the big insurance companies do not cover
AccuraScope or similar minimally invasive spine surgeries. See the following quote from
the previously linked Dallas Morning News article, where neither Aetna nor Blue Cross
cover it: "Some insurance plans cover treatments such as the AccuraScope - and other
types of minimally invasive spine surgery - partially or not at all. Aetna, for example,
considers the AccuraScope-type procedure to be 'experimental and investigational'... An
Aetna policy bulletin says the effectiveness of such measures is unproven and may entail
'significant risk' of injury and infection... An Anthem Blue Cross insurance policy statement
classifies the procedures as 'not medically necessary'". I have also spoken with Humana
(NYSE:HUM) - the company indicated the surgery is experimental and not covered.


Here is a blog post from just under 2 years ago, which flags various issues:


"I had a consult with this North American Spine for what is essentially percutaneous
laser discectomy on a herniated disc. This is a 15 k procedure I found out at other
practices throughout the country. They want to bill my insurance company 35k for a
regular discectomy and also inquired about acupuncture and other non related
surgical procedures. Then they said they have $900 administrative fee if I get the
procedure. They said insurance doesn't cover this fee and its their own fee. I asked
what it was for and they only could state for administrative fee".


One part of the excitement surrounding Nobilis' stock relates to growing the mix of in-
network surgeries, but this is odd, given insurance already appears to be skeptical of the
surgery. Additionally, one of its recent acquisitions, Victory, was shut down because of
shift to in-network and the resulting inability to collect on accounts receivable that it was
owed by insurers. On June 12, 2015, the Victory CEO said, "'Unfortunately, as out-of-
network providers, we came under attack by large insurance carriers. Even though we
were able to execute in-network agreements with three large insurers, the extreme
slowness and lack of payment from the carriers constrained liquidity significantly. We have
responded by reducing expenses and changing our facilities to provide fewer services and
kept our emergency rooms open. Unfortunately, now we have no other choice except to
sell our facilities with the intent of remunerating secured and unsecured creditors alike". It
appears that Nobilis' strategy has substantial risk.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 11/68


Considering that major insurers are not insuring this procedure, yet somehow, per the
Dallas Morning News article, "Her total bill was $94,514. Harrison's share of that was
$9,500. Insurance paid some of the rest", and the July 31, 2015 review here, "You give
them your Insurance they call and say, You Qualify", it appears that the company is getting
it through insurance somehow - I just cannot see how. Perhaps the secret sauce of the
"marketing engine" is really just the ability to get normally not insurable procedures
reimbursed by insurers. And it is easy to see the results, as Nobilis' Revenue per
Procedure is dramatically higher than that of its competitors (even with a significant year
over year drop). There competitors include Amsurg Corp. (NASDAQ:AMSG), Surgical
Care Affiliates Inc. (NASDAQ:SCAI), United Surgical Partners (formerly USPI) and
Surgery Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) (Source: Company Filings).


This issue is corroborated by the Athas financial statements, which state that
"Approximately 10% of the Company's patient volume consists of cash paying ('selfpay')
patients without any reliance on third-party support." But how is it possible that insurance
is paying for this if they do not allow it? Per my review, Aetna (NYSE:AET), Anthem Blue
Cross (NYSE:ANTM) and Humana do not insure AccuraScope or similar procedures; so,
who exactly is insuring this? How is it being put through insurance? Is there risk of not
being paid by insurers?


Somebody is Definitely Getting Paid


In 2014 alone, three individuals were paid $8.4 million. When you consider this in context
of the entire Nobilis company posting a net income figure of $3.6 million, the number
becomes pretty troubling. The key takeaway is that Kramer, Lloyd and Fleming took home
2.3 times what shareholders could (they were paid $8.4 million, compared to net income
of $3.6 million). What is even more weird is that Chris Lloyd (new and current CEO) only
officially became involved with the company on December 1, 2014, when Nobilis

5/19/2018 Nobilis: About To Fall From Nobility, Part I, 65%+ Downside - Nobilis Health Corp. (NYSEMKT:HLTH) | Seeking Alpha

purchased Athas - so, if Chris was only working at the company for 30 days (of which
some would be holidays), did he really deserve total compensation of $1.9 million. Does
this imply that on a run-rate basis, Chris could have made over $20 million in 2014?
Something appears amiss?


(Source: Management Information Circular, per Sedar, on April 7, 2015.)


A Big Valuation and a Big Supply of Shares to Sell


Current valuation: Even with the most bullish of expectations, Nobilis is still overvalued,
despite the retreat of its stock price in the last few months. If the company achieves the
very debatable guidance that it has laid out, it will still be valued at 12x 2015E EBITDA.
The following table illustrates how significant Nobilis' valuation is. There is no way a
glorified marketing engine deserves any of these multiples.

(Source for management guidance update, source for balance sheet info: Nobilis' latest
10-Q)


More shares for management: It is important to note that the company has a mostly
unnoticed 3.8 million shares that are virtually certain to be granted, but are currently not
included in analyst reports (most analysts have shares outstanding in the low-70 million
range), Google Finance (below 70 million shares outstanding) or Bloomberg (71 million
shares outstanding). If valuations are kept constant at $519 million market capitalization,
this would imply a stock price of 5% lower ($519 million market cap / 77M shares
outstanding). Note: 77M shares comes from 70.9M o/s from the company's latest 10-Q,
additional 3.8M aforementioned, 3.7M in-the-money options with average strike of $2.13).


Insider sales: Key insiders, including the former CEO and CFO and new CEO, have sold,
on average, 11% of their total holdings year to date.

(Source: Sedi Filings)


This implies that insiders have sold over $35 million of stock this year alone (equivalent to
at least 6% of the company). Chris Lloyd and his fellow Athas founders have cashed out
an additional $15 million ($3 million on closing of the deal, and an additional $12 million of
debt that was paid back with the GE Capital financing). This implies that insiders have
sold at least $50 million this year. If Chris is really excited about being CEO of Nobilis, why
has he cashed out such significant amounts of money this year?


Peculiar last financing: On April 21, 2015, Nobilis initially announced a $40 million offering,
with $35 million in gross proceeds for the company and $5 million for insiders (Donald
Kramer, former CEO, and Harry Fleming, current chairman). However, once initial
indications confirmed the market's appetite for a Nobilis offering, the offering was
expanded to raise $70 million - now, I will be the first to agree that this is pretty normal.
However, there were multiple issues with the details of this offering for anyone who
decided to read through the minutiae. First, the entire incremental amount of capital being
raised, $30 million, was for shares being sold by insiders Donald Kramer and Harry
Fleming. In addition to this, Nobilis would attach warrants to all shares sold by Donald and
Harry, and this appears to have happened at no additional cost to them. In the end,
Donald and Harry sold 3.8 million shares for $34.3 million.


Nobilis' overly optimistic guidance: Although the company's guidance is highlighted above,
I wanted to poke some holes in its likelihood. One example of the current team's prowess
in providing financial guidance can be observed in its commentary on share-based
compensation guidance. During its Q1 2015 earnings call: "[Question] Sheila Broughton,
Analyst: Do you have any kind of guidance on looking ahead where we should think of
share-based comp on a quarterly number?... [Answer] Andy Chen, Chief Financial Officer:
No, actually right now, we basically have accruing expenses all of those share-based

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 15/68


compensations on the annual basis. So we don't expect to have any more increase
unless, there is other new senior staff joining us. So at this point, the current number is
pretty much steady." Q1 2015 share-based compensation was $2.8 million. Anyone who
took the effort to check if Andy Chen's guidance was correct, with share-based
compensation staying steady going forward, would have learned that the Q2 2015 share-
based comp was over 120% higher than that in Q1 2015, at $6.2 million for the quarter.


Per the Q2 2015 conference call on August 14, 2015, CEO Lloyd gives us some pretty
vague insight into how Nobilis comes up with its guidance through discussion of its
forecasted budgets, "we're dealing with millions of page views, thousands of inquiries, you
kind of get a predictability based on statistics. So you can kind of look forward and
understand what the budget will hold". Normally, if we were talking about a technology
company, I would understand utilizing page views to help drive forecasts. First off, the
company provides no details as to how page views have progressed or changed over
time. But even more important is that we are talking about medical procedures, and it is
unlikely that Nobilis is able to forecast 2016E guidance based on page views today. It is
important to note that Nobilis' guidance will get a little better with the Victory acquisitions
this year, but only from a top line perspective as we have described with roll ups. In the
end, what is important is that the company is driving profitability, and I do not think that
Nobilis will drive profitability, given the accounting issues that it has, potential
overcharging, the various lawsuits that are outstanding and all the issues in this report
(Source: Q2 2015 financials, which drive the run-rate numbers).


In addition to the above, I challenge any shareholders to call management or Investor
Relations of Nobilis to ask how they attain comfort over their guidance for 2016E. More
likely than not, you will not be able to get any rational response as to why Nobilis'
management expects such significant improvements in both revenue and EBITDA.
Instead, you are more likely to get a response like the following, which Chris said during
the companies Q4 2014 conference call: "Because we're in such a hyper growth mode,
trust me, we're scratching our head to try to give you guys the best information to
showcase how well we're doing because we are doing very well". Does this mean that
Chris Lloyd, the former accountant who started North American Spine in 2009, after over
six years in this business and having a background in accounting, is unable to provide any
color as to how he has come up with his overly optimistic guidance. Color me skeptical.


Target valuation: Based on the fundamental business issues that I have described, along
with overly optimistic guidance with low likelihood of success, it is my view that the
stock could trade down to $1.85/share, which would represent a generous 12x 2015E

EBITDA multiple, based on Q2-2015 run-rate EBITDA levels ((12x multiple x $13.1M
EBITDA less $14M debt) / 77.2M shares). My target price, thus, implies a 65%+ downside
in the current stock price.


Are Nobilis' Financials Any More Reliable Than The Company's Surgical
Procedure?


Any roll up with multiple mergers is going to lead to some complicated accounting. And
Nobilis takes this even further with many subsidiaries and partial ownership of entities.
Appendix A shows Nobilis's complicated organization, with 31 different entities and
multiple ownership percentages. All this for a company that brought in only $49 million in
revenue last quarter, for a shockingly low revenue per entity of less than $2 million. And of
all the accounting firms to audit that complexity, which one did Nobilis pick? None other
than tiny Calvetti Ferguson, with a total of 38 professionals. Barely more than the number
of entities it audited at Nobilis. And the company's CFO situation inspires no more
confidence. Since 2010, Nobilis has changed CFOs four times (Source: Bloomberg,
Company Filings).


In August, Calvetti resigned as auditor. This follows closely after the last CFO change in
July. A new CFO and a new auditor are now charged with figuring out all the complicated
arrangement and deals built up over the years. While this does not guarantee that any
problems will be found, it definitely increases the uncertainty.


Even my outsider's review of Nobilis' financial statements uncovered some potential
issues. Per the organization chart or the following statements, "The Company assigned
100% of its equity interest in MSID to NHC ASC - Dallas, of which the Company owns
35% as a result of syndication... In November 2013, the Company sold 15.1% of its
ownership interest in the Kirby Partnership to existing physician limited partners,
effectively decreasing the Company's ownership interest to 25%" - so this means the
company owns 35% of MSID and 25% of Kirby. However, it appears to be fully
consolidating both entities. The effect of this would be to inflate revenues so that the
growth story appears better than it really is (Source: Nobilis' latest 10-K).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 17/68


If the company were to proportionally consolidate revenues, its 2014 revenues would be
meaningfully lower by $36 million for a total of $44 million, as reflected in the following
adjusted chart (Source: Nobilis' latest 10-K).


It appears that Nobilis does not have control over these two subsidiaries. Also, if $44
million is the right number for revenue for 2014, then revenue growth is 44%, not the
astronomical 161% the company reported. It is noted that Nobilis retains the benefit of
fully consolidating FNH and FNSC in the chart above.


Conclusion | A Potential House of Cards


Nobilis has no accolades which would cause me to believe that the company can be one
of the few successful and sustainable roll up strategies. Instead, it has a history of poor
management with two prior roll ups that resulted in over 90% losses to shareholders (Acro
Energy and Northstar Healthcare from 2007-2010). Fundamentally, Nobilis is very unlikely
to make bullish guidance, yet management is extremely well paid and sells stock
relentlessly. One of its primary marketed experimental procedures (AccuraScope) has
questionable insurability, unsubstantiated success rates, lack of recognition from any
institutions (insurance, university or medical bodies) and a poor history, with patient lives
being ruined. And to top it all off, the company's accounting situation appears unstable
and vulnerable. This report is part I of a potential multi-series write-up, as Nobilis' depth of
issues runs deep.

This research leaves a lot out, though. And Stevens Investments is still onboard. Did you see the report they
posted on the Nobilis site? Have to download the pdf, but they said they "reiterate our confidence in Nobilis'

Critical Thought
Yesterday (October 11, 2015), Nobilis announced a full review (See their Website October 11, 2015 in
Investor Relations/Press Releases). It reads:


The Independent Counsel appointed to conduct this Review are Robert R. Hopper, Esq., Managing 
Partner, Robert R. Hopper & Associates, Attorneys at Law, Minneapolis, MN; and, Lanny J. Davis, Esq., 
Lanny J. Davis and Associates, Attorney at Law, Washington, DC. Both of these counsel are exceedingly 
experienced attorneys with the integrity to lead and guide this process.


In my view, these two gentlemen are some of the top guns in the legal profession. Mr. Davis used to be
Counsel for President Clinton and I think did some work under George W. Bush too. Mr. Hopper is equally
magnificent. They will leave no stone unturned and their legal opinion on this research will be welcomed.
Nobilis is using some of the best in the industry. This says a lot for them and how serious they are taking this
research.


I trust what they come up with and do and am impressed with Nobilis' selection. All I can say is I hope Mr.
Emperor ran his article through a legal team before publishing because Mr. Hopper and Mr. Davis are very
accomplished Attorneys who are thorough in their analysis and opinions. Their litigation success rates (just
Google them) is also impressive.

ranked 142 out of 149: http://bit.ly/1RKQwCc).


Assuming I'm not confusing the firm (you can check this yourself: http://robertrhopper.com), the real question
becomes: why didn't they hire a Sidley Austin or another well known law firm?


The guy Davis has a degree from a top law school but he's a crisis manager. Again why didn't they hire a top
notch law firm well-known on the street to exonerate themselves from these claims?


Anyone who owned NHC (and I did for a very long time) knows the history of Kramer and Fleming. I was
cheering when they stepped aside. What I didn't realize until this article is that they were replaced by
someone who appears to be equally bad.


If these guys did not disclose the issues and valuations of Athas then I would call for a criminal investigation.
How exactly did they pay so much more for Athas than its value 24 months earlier? Why did they not disclose
the caliber and qualifications of the people running Athas, and the fact that it's (at best) a shaky unproven
venture? At worst some kind of quack treatment?


That's what I want to know as a shareholder who sold on this article.

What did you short the stock before this? This report moved the stock -20% and its based on accusations and
speculation about management? It seems this author is the only one damaging shareholders value. The Net Patient
Service chart is taken out of context and it is supposed to represent the improvement of the facilities they own under
their management, not the revenues they earned from that facility. Read the latest 10-k for yourselves, the average
revenue per patient and and case load in 2014 blew up for MSID, increased by over 700 cases and they charged an
average of $7000+ more for each case... Because of Nobilis's management and high margin surgery approach and
Athas's marketing. Irrational investors out there, have an opinion, and don't just trade based on accusatory articles
based on out of context statements.

It's not taken out of context at all, as the company clearly consolidates the revenue from these entities. See

Yes, i read that before posting and fully understand they are consolidating the revenue, and yes they may not
own the majority of those two facilities but the trends and improvement in revenue is obvious. Their business
model is working and generating those revenues. Look at the growth for MSID... but that is now overlooked
because this article chose to point out how they consolidated the business on there FS... like yeah they might
not technically be all "nobilis's" but thats taken care of on the bottom of the income statement and why they
don't have much in earnings... Who is valuing this stock based on revenue and not revenue and earnings
growth potential... whats the important factor to take away is their business strategy works, and they're
improving the profitability of all establishments they work with, thus the inorganic growth model and buying
assets for cents on the dollar. They transferred ownership through syndication to specific physicians probably

the massive fall today, which hurt HLTH's investors... and market manipulation is not cool.

Physician-Owned Forest Park Medical Center to Pay $215,000 to Resolve Kickback Allegations Under Civil

January 15, 2015


Western District of Texas

Forest Park Medical Center, LLC (“FPMC”), a physician-owned hospital located in Dallas, Texas, will pay $215,000
under a civil settlement with the United States Department of Justice, announced Acting United States Attorney
Richard L. Durbin, Jr. The settlement resolves allegations that the hospital paid kickbacks in exchange for referrals of
patients covered by the federal workers’ compensation program, known as FECA.


FECA, a federal health care program administered by the United States Department of Labor (“DOL”), provides
workers’ compensation benefits to federal workers who suffer job-related injuries. The program covers roughly three

here is another article on Forest Park, and shows the challenge and pressures of out of network model, and
how less lucrative the in network model is as they tried to change but not enough revenues to support facility


Forest Park Medical Center of Frisco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal court on Tuesday.


The medical center, which opened in Frisco Square in July 2012, is part of the Dallas-based Forest Park
Medical Center network of physician-owned facilities. It owes more than $14 million to creditors, according to
several media reports.


According to court documents, the hospital was based on an out-of-network model that relied on higher
reimbursement rates for its operations. But that model has not generated enough revenue to sustain
operations, documents say. So the center shifted and began contracting with insurance providers for in-
network procedures, but those reduced rates haven’t been enough to increase medical center’s overall
revenues, documents state.


Without more patients, the hospital can’t generate enough revenue to operate and service its debt, the
document states.


The hospital employs nearly 160 people.


Court papers describe the hospital as “a luxury medical care facility” with features “such as a lobby water
feature, soothing scents in the HVAC system, meals cooked to order by an on-site chef, green views from
every room, calming colors and low lighting to increase relaxation, and softened textures.


“It is currently minimally staffed for an average daily census of 1-3 inpatients per day and up to 200
outpatients per month, but has a fully staffed maximum capacity of 54 inpatients per day and 1,000
outpatients per month.”


An initial hearing is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in federal court in Plano. Click here for details on the
bankruptcy filing.

One of the reasons why US healthcare companies may choose to list in Canada is because although a US
healthcare company of Nobilis' size would likely be considered insignificant in the US capital markets, it would
hold some weight in the HC sector on a Canadian exchange. Listing in Canada can provide increased analyst
coverage, trading liquidity and more institutional/retail demand. There is approx. 260 non-Canadian
companies listed in Canada.

I have no problem with taking a negative view on a company, but as it’s gotten easier (through the Internet and TV)
and more economical (through the options market) to conduct bear raids, there’s a much greater risk that short sellers
can manipulate the markets and try to bring companies down.

Critical Thought
This article is a great learning piece. Here's my opinion:


1. Short a stock at around 1 buck above the margin cutoff. 
2. Get some research and question everything the management is doing. Even challenge the figures. 
3. Write a scathing Opinion article to protect me from liability. 
4. Trigger Margin Calls. 
5. Collect my Profits. 
6. Reinvest those profits into buying up the stock. 
7. Wait for rebuttals to my opinions. 
8. Quietly double dip.


Hmmm. This may not be happening but I am real suspicious here.

I guess we can ask ourselves this:


1. Why would we release an opinion on Friday at 10 am EST. This is just before the Canada Thanksgiving
Long Weekend? Timing is everything. 
2. Why would our Title read "Part 1"? Does this imply a Part 2 or 3 or? Why can't we complete our entire
opinion in one swoop? 
3. On a Friday, it is harder for the company to respond. It takes them time to review the opinion first before
commenting allowing the thing to stew over the weekend. 
4. The Banks have time to trigger the Margin Calls over the weekend?  
5. Just my thoughts but the people involved in management seem to be very reputable who have too much to
lose to file false statements.


Maybe the Emperor will be able to have clothes and nice ones at that.


Again, this whole thing just doesn't hit me right on many fronts. Call me a skeptic if you want.

The author falsely claims that Nobilis is overstating its financial situation by consolidating 100% of the revenues from
several subsidiaries that it has less than a 50% interest in. But the company is also including 100% of the expenses of
those same subsidiaries and then deducting from net income an amount attributable to non-controlling interests.
Perfectly acceptable accounting procedure.


09 Oct 2015, 07:35 PM


Critical Thought
I might be wrong here so certainly correct me if I am.


I thought a company must pass a full blown Audit successfully before being accepted as a listing on NYSE and the
Russell. Nobilis was listed in 2015 on both.


As I recall, the Audits the company must pass to gain a listing are thorough and unforgiving if they are out by even
one penny.

10 Oct 2015, 03:02 AM


The Emerging Market Advocate
Whenever I read a research report from an investment bank, or Seeking Alpha, I try to figure out if there are biases
and then take these into account when I am figuring out how much weight I will put on the report. If an ibank continues
to raise money for a company then they might be biased, and I look at their report to see if it seems too weighted to
the upside with little attention to any negative company news.


When I read your report it was alarming as to how negatively biased the report was (I assume you have shorted this
stock). Here are some examples (going through your report from top to bottom) of what I believe to be your very one
sided and skewed report:


1) “Fear the Roll Up”- you basically slam roll ups but as any investor knows some roll ups work tremendously well
(ask Soros, Buffet, Gates and Huizenga about their stakes in auto dealership roll ups http://for.tn/1LnAiy6 ) and some
don't. For example in Canada some of the most successful companies over the past many years have been
Constellation Software,the Boyd Group and Valeant..all roll ups. VERY BIASED. 
2) Management- you are trying to say that the management teams of one failed company are the exact same as NHC
and thus the fate of NHC is a done deal. The fact that the previous CEO was known to have a spotty business past
has been known by Canadian investors for a long time which is one of the reasons he is no longer CEO. The thing is
management has changed and seems to be doing a credible job. The jury is out, but so far so good. BIASED. 
3) Garbage In Garbage Out- you are basically saying that if a hospital had problems it will continue to have problems.
Have you ever heard of a turnaround? There are private equity firms and CEOs who make their living on turnarounds-
this is what NHC is trying to do with the hospitals they are buying. So far they seem to be doing a credible job, but I
would say the jury is still out. VERY BIASED. 
4) Nobilis same story as Acro- you are trying desperately to make any connection to Acro. It is based in Houston-but I
know there are a lot of good companies based in Houston. It is listed on a Canadian Stock Exchange-but I know there

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 32/68


are a lot of good companies listed on Canadian exchanges including US based businesses. It has the same
accounting firm-it did but doesn't any more (see point 5 below). You go on about a guy named Rothstein – does he
have anything to do with NHC (maybe I missed it). You go on about this back surgery and make it seem sleazy
because some (not all) insurance companies won't pay for it- do you know how hard it is to get insurance companies
to pay for new treatments? Most insurance companies do not like to pay out money and companies have to spend
tons of time and effort trying to get covered. BIASED. 
5) Issues with the accounting firm. On the one hand you are saying that the previous small accounting firm was too
small, didn't have public company experience and was involved in Acro. You are trying to invoke fear. Then you are
telling us they resigned, trying to instill more fear. But the fact is, as I am sure you are aware, an accounting firm must
resign before another could be hired. The new firm Crowe Horwarth ( http://bit.ly/1LnAgpX ) , is a large accounting
firm. Isn't this a good thing- A firm moving to a large well known accounting firm? EXTREMELY BIASED. 
6) Insider sales. You tell us on the one hand that some of these people are “bad” people like Kramer and Fleming, but
on the other hand you are upset that they are selling? The fact is that I think most people think this is a good thing.
They have moved on from management (or have been pushed out) and now they even have less to do with the
company. I am not sure why this would be a bad thing. With respect to Chris Lloyd – he seems to be buying shares
even at prices of US$6.80 ( http://bit.ly/1LnAiy9 ) -isn't this a good thing and why didn't you mention this? VERY
BIASED. 
7) Chris Lloyd. You cast aspersions but when I look at his resume ( http://bit.ly/1LnAgpZ ) I see a guy who has worked
at one of the top Accounting firms and who has had some good successes in his career. BIASED. 
8) “Peculiar Last Financing”. Peculiar..how? They raised more than they thought they could..this is a good thing. The
company probably did not want more dilution so did not take the additional funds, but instead allowed the insiders to
sell-which is a good thing instead of having them dribble the shares out in the market? The warrants were on the
insiders shares allowing them once again to sell privately instead of dribbling them out...isn't this a good thing?
EXTREMELY BIASED. 
9) Guidance. You are trying to say that no one can rely on guidance. I would say that is true for many public
companies, but especially companies that have raised a lot of cash and are about to do acquisitions. When will the
acquisitions close? How large will they be? How accretive will they be. So I guess I am saying that guidance is a
guess at this time, but to cast aspersions on the fact that the company is somehow pulling the wool over investors'
eyes is BIASED. 
10) Target Valuation. You have used the last quarter to value NHC, even though they are acquiring lots of companies
and seem to be adding value to the ones they already have. BIASED. 
11) “A potential house of Cards”. Wow-you are really trying to put the fear into investors. You then go on to say this is
“Part 1” of a “potential” multi series report. Is this not an attempt to put even more fear into the market? Even though
there are some bad research reports out there they always give a complete story not half a story. EXTREMELY
BIASED.


In conclusion, if you want us to look at your report as anything more than a slam piece to try to make someone money
on the short side, then you should be less biased, more balanced and it may be a little more credible.

Critical Thought
Impressed,


I think Emerging Market Advocate did a nice job questioning the interpretation of the facts.


One thing he especially stated was Credibility to any report is based on how rounded the facts are presented.
As any good lawyer will tell you, the truth is how you perceive the facts presented. The more you present
facts in a way that shows both concerns and positives, the more credible you are in how you are interpreting
the facts. I go back to the fact that revenue is reported to be growing per quarter unless someone can show
me a fact that the management key players are being dragged out of their offices in handcuffs charged with
Fraud. So far, this is a fact. And in business, that's the main fact I rely on.


What fact has really surprised me here is that someone with a pen name "Emperor has no clothes" can make
a stock price drop 27%. This is a fact because just before this report, the stock was doing ok. I can see this
possible if a prominent Analyst who affixes his name to a report comes out with a balanced analysis.


So as investors. Are we going to listen to "Bugs Bunny", "Darth Vader", and "Elmer Fudd" coming forward
with their interpretation of the facts and treat them as gospel? If that is so, maybe we should check the local
public bathroom stall to get the scoop on the next buy or short with data attached to the toilet paper complete
with commentary on what the facts really mean.

Best do a little fact checking before you accept medical information on complex medical procedures from an
anonymous poster who claims to be shorting the stock of the company he has made the claim against!!

The stock dropped 27% because the market obviously found what the author wrote credible. Seeking Alpha
publishes many short articles (and many more long articles) a week; they normally don't have such an effect.


I don't understand your ad hominem attacks at all; nobody ever accuses the author of a long article he's
actually long the stock, even though it's exactly the same; I personally very much prefer authors to put their
money where their mouth is and hold actual positions based on what they're writing.

Hi Bart,


Your comment stating "I much prefer authors to put their money where their mouth is and hold actual
positions" is really the crux of my concern. This means the chances of Bias towards interpretation of facts is
much higher. For liquid stocks like Apple, you would be correct that opinions from Phantom writers either way
would not have a huge impact. However, a small company with a smaller following can have more magnified
effects (unfortunately)


Actually, in this case, I would have held the opinions of higher credibility if the author did not disclose they
were shorting the stock but merely sharing their research and fact interpretative findings. This way, they truly
have nothing to gain or lose by their interpretations.


Frankly, if the opinion was the opposite (as in long) and the article wasn't balanced towards both sides, I
would have the exact same concerns as well. As was said earlier, the more balanced, the higher the
credibility in my view.


Also, if the Author announced who they were and worked for a credible Investment firm, they would also
massively increase credibility in my eyes.


You are correct. Many did consider this article as credible based on the stock drop. This really concerns me
as to how some investors make investment decisions through "Daffy Duck" or other Phantom Name crafted
reporting. Perhaps that may explain why many of them lose their shirts in the markets.


I personally will not make my Investment decisions from "Stock Girl" or any other phantom pen name
personally and would also factor in the motive to writing. The higher chances of no gain or loss to the author,
the higher the credibility as well.


Remember, any fact can be interpreted both ways.

Hi Bart,


I do have one last comment as I think my points are clear.


I have to ask you, If you have a root canal that needs tending to, do you:


1. Call a Proven, Certified Dentist with the knowledge and provable credentials to preform the task at hand
or... 
2. Find a Drug Addict in the Back Alley by the name of "Hammer" recite to you the process of how to
successfully complete a root canal from a Dentist Book he has at hand.


Both Parties have the facts at hand to perform the task.


Who are you opening your mouth to complete the job?


Well, the answer you provide here explains why this article and its impact was alarming. By the way, I have
NO shares in NHC or HLTH, I just see the results and reactions somewhat confusing and perplexing.

Just one quick comment: if anybody is known to have a bias towards interpretation of facts it's the analysts
working for the investment firm you speak so fondly of.

Hi Bart,


Well, I just had to respond to your latest post. I read William Matson's Article and his article is well thought out
and uses the verifiable numbers to do the talking. He is right; there are SA articles that are very well crafted
and frankly good advice which result in wealth building. He is also right that some analysts in investment firms
do hold back on sell recommendations. Like anything, there are excellent Analysts and others that are not as
good. Also, one must separate the wheat from the Chaff in SA Articles too.


The Key difference here is William a verified MBA (Harvard), CFA and CFP and does not hide it either. I doubt
You would see William write under "Chicken Guy" or some other pen name. When you read his article, he lets
the literature from highly credible Universities and his number crunching savvy to do the talking. He is
someone I am going to follow.


This article on the other hand does more than number crunch. It, in my opinion:


1. attacks the credibility of the players involved in efforts to slight them as deceiving and incompetent. These
border on Personal attacks in my view. 
2. Ignores the announced numbers of revenue growth over the past 3 quarters. At least he could announce
and explain his thoughts on them. 
3. Paints a brush that roll ups are bad. Roll ups can be successful as well. Berkshire Hathaway is an excellent
example of this. 
4. One past failure from a person does not mean their future business practices are not successful. Buffett
has had his share of past business failures and I certainly would not call him a failure! He is about as
successful as you get. 
5. Ignores that some business people are magical at turning businesses around quickly and profoundly. 
6. Is an announced short (I think that is your stance as well based on your profile) which automatically skews
the information. 
7. Forget the insider buying (i.e. Lloyd 1 Million Plus in August at $6.80 in August, 2015) 
8. Ignores recent Russell/NYSE Listings (2015). 
9. Isolates one failure law suit to mean bad practice all around. Operations on Human Beings naturally have
risks. 
10. Ignores that there are many Americans who are well off who pay full price for luxury medical services. 
11. Ignores that the new Accounting Firm is larger and better recognized.

12. Fails to explain large, recent private placement purchase at $9.00 CDN a share and they paid this before
the new additional facilities were acquired.


All the work I read from William Matson does none of this in terms of balancing the facts and therefore, in my
view, well done, balanced, thought provoking work. Thanks for sharing that article by William. I appreciated it.
He is certainly a "Dentist".

A classic manipulation of the market through creating an artificial fear but this is usually short term ,,Just hope
management will come with a good response up to legal action on all the culprits behind this attack..


10 Oct 2015, 12:52 PM


The Emerging Market Advocate
You did quite a hatchet job on NHC. How easy is it to do a hatchet job on a company or a person...pretty easy I would
say. Let me give it a try.


Let's look into the “Emperor Has No Clothes” .


1) This is from your profile: “I have a background in business...” ...a big sarcastic “wow,” so do most investors and the
majority of humans that live on this earth. But wait you “deal with internal models, analysis, sales pitches and ad
information daily”...sounds like you may be a lackey at a large or mid-sized company....this is not impressive and
frankly in my opinion casts doubt on your business understanding in general and investor acumen. 
2) You say, “In my downtime, I am enthusiastic about the markets highs, lows and volatility. “ Really? Sounds a bit like
technical analysis to me, but you are writing about NHCs fundamentals...a bit of a mismatch? 
3) But here is where you try to set yourself apart, “I believe in real lags between market and business reactions, with
the former often in advance of the latter, and vice versa. I look to call manic enthusiasm with a distinct opportunity to
go short. A change in sentiment is all it takes. I research fundamentals while scavenging for value. “ Sounds like a
bunch of motherhood. How about looking into ROI, fundamental market research, the competition, etc.  
4) Your profile was so short, I decided to go to your twitter page you provided (perhaps you should take the link
down). You have 5 tweets (last tweet was September 2014), 12 following and 5 followers. Let me guess the followers
are your mom, dad, sister, brother and grandmother? Am I close? 
5) Your twitter name is TheEmperor93...I am guessing that is your birth year? If true that would make you 22 years
old...and you think you have investing experience?

6) “TheEmperor93” has a porn site...is that you or just a coincidence? I am hoping and trusting that it is not you, but
can you see how casting aspersions can hurt a company and its managers too? 
7) Talking about misleading numbers, you state that you wrote a negative piece on GrowLife after it was halted. You
claim that your report was issued when GrowLife was at 50 cents, but it looks like from the charts that it was at 50
cents when it was halted, and opened at way less than this (hard to tell from charts but maybe in the 20 cent range?).
So you basically wrote a negative piece on a company that was halted and being investigated by the SEC but you are
taking credit for the decline during the day it reopened...shameful.


Once again, I am all for serious but balanced research (positive and negative) not hatchet jobs.

I have a relatively large position in HLTH. I suspect that the hit from the article has been taken and the stock will trade
in a lower range until the company reports around mid-November. The proof is in the financial results. I am holding
until then.

Convex Ideas, Contributor
@k9justice, Headfake on Stockhouse pretends he is the Emperor, that he closed half his short, that basically the
company is a buy at a lower level; that this is just a deramping trick, and his language is colourful, very provocative. I
does not ring true...I doubt that Headfake is the Emperor. Why would he bother giving up his endgame so quickly after
a 27% drop and in such a low-class way that ruins his reputation after a thesis which has earnt applauds from the like
of Aristides capital?

Critical Thought
One can learn from situations like this from an Investing Perspective. My learning here are:


1. Buy Stocks that are not vulnerable to wide swings. This means (Unfortunately) upstarts are out regardless of their
reported rise in revenues. This is because Investors, at times, are driven by emotion versus rational thought. This is
sad as upstarts rely on Investment to make their visions come true. 
2. Go into highly liquid stocks and learn their daily/weekly swings. For examples, I have made good money buying
COST at the lower end of the range and selling a buck or 2 higher in the range. 
3. Volume is the barometer of emotional state of investors. Higher volumes on the upside can indicate positive

investor emotions and visa versa.  
4. Employ well plotted/thought out stop loss strategies. You may get whip sawed here and there but your losses will
always remain at a minimum. 
5. Understand that any report from anyone can trigger a massive fluctuation and this is even more pronounced with
lower cost stock with limited follower base. 
6. Even thought you see a report as bias, the market determines its value...not you. 
7. Investors spook easily regardless of rationale.


So, in a way, this whole thing has become a good, new learning experience. I always know and have learned that
even when I make a mistake, I can recover from future successful decisions. For example, I have lost 40 to 50% of
my investment portfolio when I started due to my inexperience, lack of discipline from following simple rules. However,
from these experiences, I not only recovered from them I flourished. One rule I especially have is to listen to my
judgements based on my rules.


Happy Investing! I hope you all flourish even if you encounter a few road bumps along the way.

Statement from the Nobilis Health Corp. Board of Directors October 11, 2015 
The Nobilis Board of Directors and its Audit Committee have been made aware of and have reviewed a blogger's
posting on a site called "Seeking Alpha". This anonymous posting contains significant inaccuracies, inflammatory
accusations and several misrepresentations concerning our company, its management and our financial condition.
While we understandably have serious disagreement with these scurrilous claims, as to their validity and accuracy,
the public and investors should know that the Nobilis Board of Directors and its Audit Committee take seriously any
and all such claims made publicly about our company, as we understand the material effect such claims may have on
our reputation and on our financial integrity. Accordingly, in an effort to address these allegations we believe that full
disclosure and complete transparency is the appropriate way to show our commitment to the public, our investors and
our regulators. To this end, the Chairman of our Audit Committee, Steve Ozonian is announcing that the Committee
and the Board's Independent Directors have appointed and retained an outside Independent Counsel who will
conduct a full review of each and every allegation raised by this blog. This Review will be presented to the public as
an Independent Counsel's Report and will be based upon a pre-commitment to full transparency and disclosure. The
Independent Counsel appointed to conduct this Review are Robert R. Hopper, Esq., Managing Partner, Robert R.
Hopper & Associates, Attorneys at Law, Minneapolis, MN; and, Lanny J. Davis, Esq., Lanny J. Davis and Associates,
Attorney at Law, Washington, DC. Both of these counsel are exceedingly experienced attorneys with the integrity to
lead and guide this process. Mr. Ozonian, his Audit Committee members and the Independent Directors have the
endorsement of Nobilis' full Board of Directors to engage Independent Counsel and undertake this Review. All of
Nobilis’ Directors are confident that the work of the Independent Counsel and their Review will show that these
allegations have no merit whatsoever and that when brought to the "light of day", these allegations will be completely
dismissed and the truth in Nobilis' financial integrity will prevail.

Management’s Initial Response to Seeking Alpha October 11, 2015


Nobilis’ Management has reviewed the inflammatory and slanderous anonymous blogger’s posting on the crowd
funded tabloid Seeking Alpha and has prepared the following brief response to that posting’s most outrageous
innuendo. While the Company does not make a habit of responding to bloggers or commenters in other investors
forums, least of all anonymous ones, it is making an exception in this case because of the clear harm done to the
Company’s shareholders, which was the obvious intent of this blogger and those colluding with him or her to
manipulate our Company’s stock price for their self-interested gain.


1. The So-Called Accounting Red-Flags are Simply Red-Herrings.


Each allegation implying that there is financial impropriety at the Company is belied by the facts as detailed in the
Company’s corporate disclosure.


FACT: There are no auditor issues. The Company’s prior auditor, the regional firm Calvetti Ferguson and Wagner,
resigned at the Company’s request to make way for Crowe Horwath, a nationally-recognized accounting firm, to
assume the role. This change was a continuous subject of discussion with our institutional investors. The 8-K

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 41/68


announcing the resignation, as required by law, clearly stated that Calvetti’s resignation was not the result of any
dispute with the Company. Additionally, Calvetti continues to work with the Company on internal controls auditor – a
fact omitted by the anonymous blogger in order to mislead the investing public.


FACT: There are no personnel troubles at CFO. Four of the Company’s last five CFOs remain engaged with the
Company, in the various roles of Chairman, Executive Vice President of Finance, Tax Counsel, and as the current
CFO. The changes were made as the Company quickly outgrew the expertise of each successive CFO. It is thus
outrageous for the anonymous blogger to imply that the change in CFO was to somehow hide information. Every CFO
is available to assist the new auditors with any questions they may have and are prepared to stand behind their
accounting – another fact omitted by the anonymous blogger in order to mislead the investing public.


FACT: There are no accounts receivable issues with Accurascop-branded procedures. The anonymous blogger
misconstrues and misunderstands the way that Accurascope-branded procedures are billed. Such procedures are
billed under several codes depending on the unique surgery selected by the physician for a given patient. The fact is
that a “brand” is not the same as a “CPT code”. The anonymous blogger is using a false distinction to mislead
investors – our revenues bear this out. Further, the collectability of accounts receivable owed to now-bankrupt
companies is utterly irrelevant to the collectability of Nobilis’ accounts receivable. The reasons behind Victory
Healthcare’s inability to collect accounts receivable is related to historical issues at Victory that are in no way, shape
or form related to Nobilis – yet another fact omitted by the anonymous blogger in order to mislead the investing public.


2. Our “Questionable Marketing” is Unquestionably Appropriate and Unquestionably Successful.


FACT: Our marketing materials appropriately describe the relatively risks and benefits of our branded procedures and
the success rates are supported by medical research as well as our own data. The anonymous blogger quotes “other
sources” for “complications stemming from an Accurascope DND”. In fact these “other sources” were a standard
informed consent document of which some form is required for every spine procedure performed in the State of
Texas.


FACT: The research backing up the clinical and economic efficacy of our branded procedures is valid and compelling.
The author attempts to denigrate the validity of the research by implying that we somehow paid for the results. These
studies followed standard protocols for the production of peer reviewed medical research. As is customary, the
physicians actually performing the procedures were instrumental in both the aggregation of data as well as the
publishing of results and all of these activities were performed outside of the purview Nobilis/Athas.


FACT: Consumerism in healthcare is here to stay. Nobilis recognized the impact of greater patient financial burden
coinciding with the disruption of traditional medical referral patterns brought about by the increased availability of
medical information. Nobilis invested heavily in meeting patients’ changing healthcare consumption patterns and is
well positioned to continue to benefit from these trends. The author’s contention that our healthcare marketing is
somehow peculiar or unethical is ill-informed at best.


3. We Stand by Our Guidance.


FACT: Nobilis Management reiterates its guidance. In the summer the Company issued guidance for 2015, which
increased our earlier forecast for the year. The Company stands by its updated summer forecast. Indeed, the
Company has witnessed 19 quarters of sustained growth with triple digit growth throughout 2015.


4. Our Insiders Remain Significantly Invested in Nobilis and its Successes .
5/19/2018 Nobilis: About To Fall From Nobility, Part I, 65%+ Downside - Nobilis Health Corp. (NYSEMKT:HLTH) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 42/68


FACT: No Insiders Have “Cashed Out” . Insiders and Management continue to own approximately 25 million shares
and share units. This includes the holdings of Kramer, Fleming, and Lloyd, among others with smaller holdings.
Contrary to the anonymous blogger’s assertions, Chris Lloyd has not sold a single share of Company stock. These
are yet again more facts selectively and deceptively omitted by the anonymous blogger in order to mislead the
investing public.


FACT: Large insider sales by Kramer and Fleming were a matter of extensive public disclosure a at the request of our
investors and occurred Investors demanded the participation of Kramer and Fleming in the May private placement, to
both reduce the concentration of shares held by management and limit the dilutive effect of the capital raise. Further,
the Company chose to participate in the private placement only to the extent that it had a capital need on the heels of
its 25 million dollar debt raise with GE Capital. The facts here simply speak for themselves.

Critical Thought
Wow,


Based on the above statement, here is what I predict. I could be wrong, but have seen similar situations in the
past:


1. A complete independent company review will be under foot. No stone will be left unturned. Evidence will be
gathered. 
2. IF and I mean IF there is any material fact that "Emperor has no clothes" mislead, misinterpreted or made
false statement(s), the company will pursue a Court Order to get his/her name released. 
3. Then the company will have a sea of Attorneys file legal action(s) against "Emperor has no clothes". 
4. The Emperor will need to put on some nice clothes for Court. 
5. Any gains made by the Emperor will be used as a down payment for all the legal fees he/she will need to
endure. 
6. Then comes the "piggy bank" suits from Mutual Funds, Institutional Investors if they lost significant sums of
money. 
7. The Opinion defense only works if they can show they made no money from their statements as making
money could possibly be seen as stock manipulation. 
8. I almost forgot. If and I mean IF there is any evidence of stock manipulation, Emperor could be in Court
with the SEC and other regulatory bodies as well.


In my opinion, Emperor, Part 2, 3, 4 etc. should be crafted under thin egg shells. My suggestion would be to
ensure any commentaries are read by your Attorney, and some prestigious financial experts including
Accountants. One must stand behind their data.


However, if everything you stated is fully truthful, not twisted and fair comment, you should be able to ride this
storm fine.


If I was in your shoes, I would run to the nearest Corporate/Tort Law expert. But, that's only my opinion.

Hi Bart,


By saying "seeing similar situations like this" I am referring to my personal experiences as a legal expert. Not
knowing all the facts here, I am only stating the processes typically done based on past situations I have been
involved with. After a thorough independent investigation, one determines the action(s) to pursue or not. If,
after a thorough investigation, there is no evidence of false light, libel, slander, etc., the legal team
recommends that no action(s) are pursued. However, every word in a statement is analyzed to determine
whether there has been a balance of probability that a tort has been committed. 
Sometimes, they will launch a massive action(s) to save face even though the laws of probability of winning is
slim. From my experiences, companies, if they feel that their formal reporting is at question, will fight for their
very lives and spare no expense to clear their names. To them, spending millions of dollars on reviews and
litigation is necessary and a crucial investment. I think Nobilis will go through this exhaustive cost because
they now need to protect their reputation and defend any possible regulatory questions. The biggest threat to
them in my view is the doubt that their financial reporting is true and accurate.


Again, I am NOT involved whatsoever and thus privied to the details so I can only go by my experiences.


If EVERYTHING Emperor stated is fair comment and free of any bias, misinterpretations, he/she will be fine.
That is why one must be so careful knowing the line between fair comment and tort violations. Personally,
whenever I write on a company, I go to great pains to ensure the thoughts are balanced and number
crunching is irrefutable to protect myself and whoever I am writing about. I personally never discuss
management personally for fear that my information is one-sided and perceived as damaging.


In my opinion, Nobilis may feel that they have no choice to go through this exhaustive process to protect them
but unforeseen consequences like class actions, SEC investigations, etc. I do see them based on my past
experiences to come out fighting hard. The Investigation is their way to look before they leap.


In my opinion, Nobilis has really no choice but to invest a lot of resources in this and predict they will.


One easy thing, I think they can most likely prove damage was done on a stock price/monetary basis.


Also, I do predict based on past experiences that the regulatory bodies will be involved as well. Again, and I
repeat again, this is only based on past experiences. I do not have all the facts (or are privied to them) to
make a statement beyond my past experiences.

I asked for an URL, because the assumption the company in question might go after the author of a short
piece is very often suggested, but never actually materializes. At best if a company can really argue an article
is factually incorrect, Seeking Alpha removes it. But really, as far as I know, it never went beyond this.


So as far as my experience goes in "similar situations like this" (and there have been quite a lot; Seeking
Alpha regularly publishes these kinds of pieces) companies put out one or two PR's right after the article and
then never revisit the issue again. Seeking Alpha-posters that never made a post before pop up out of
nowhere and apart from defending the company most of all personally attack the author and this website for a
few days and then disappear again.  
Also, in my experience, looking back a year or so later those anonymous authors were often (but definitely
not always) dead right with their analysis. Maybe this one will be an exception to that rule: we'll have to wait &
see.

Hi Bart,


I am unsure how this one will pan out. However, Nobilis hiring Mr. Hopper and Mr. Davis tells me they are
very serious at pursuing as these are the best in the business Lawyers (just read their bios and you will see
what I mean). You are correct in that some companies don't pursue anything other than talk about it.
However, they don't usually announce best in the business hiring of Attorneys for review. This case may be
unique as the stock drop appears to be related to his article and was profound. Also, lawyers soliciting Case
Actions doesn't help matters much. Not knowing the past situations you have seen, I can assume perhaps the
immediate effect on stock price was not as profound as this situation was. In my opinion, the hornet's nest
was cast when the author said " potentially overstated revenues" in his/her summary. These 3 words
personally got my antenna up. This can imply fraud or deception on the part of the company. I am not sure
about the other situations you have seen, but implying deception on public financial records is like slitting the
underbelly of any company and usually, when this happens, they fight for their lives and do act swiftly and
with the full force of the law. In other words, they don't and won't let that slide.


You are also right about seeing people pop in and pop out too. I know in my case, I read SA and rarely
comment. The reason why I popped in was because of the unique analysis of the article, my opinion that the
tight rope between fair comment and attraction of liability may have been crossed and being dumbfounded
that a phantom writer got such profound credibility. I just have never seen this happen before. This one I am
following closely out of curiousity and intrigued on the results, if any.


You are right, I have read articles with very accurate analysis on SA. Actually, I have made money from some
of the excellent articles published. However, none of the ones I have seen infer a company is being dishonest
through "potentially overstated revenues." All the Articles I have read on SA that are of high quality 99%
percent of the time are published by folks with real names attached.


You are right...we will see. I do know from prior knowledge both Mr. Hopper and Mr. Davis are Attorneys who
a relentless and aggressive on defending their clients. From my readings, these gentlemen usually only take
on cases where the commitment on the part of the client is Marathon in length. These two gentlemen are not

Reason for Report: Company Update 
Remain Highly Confident in Management, 
Business Model; Maintain OW and $10 PT 
INVESTMENT CONCLUSION: 
Following Friday's ~27% share price decline due to a short report 
littered with dubious assumptions and lazy/flawed financial analysis, 
we reiterate our confidence in Nobilis' management team, business 
model, and our financial estimates. The Company's history naturally 
creates concerns, but our vetting gives us great resolve that the 
December 2014 acquisition of Athas transformed the growth profile 
for Nobilis while bringing significant new talent to manage the new 
company. We are also comfortable with the Company's accounting 
and cash flow profile. The issues raised in the short report are not 
new and we do not believe the current management team is 
attempting to hide anything. We reiterate our Overweight (Vol) rating 
and $10 PT. 
KEY POINTS: 
Confidence in management team and business model 
unwavering: With the acquisition of Athas in December 2014, Nobilis 
transformed the company's growth profile as we expect HLTH 
generates ~$40 million in 2015 EBITDA-NCI compared to ~$10 
million last year. Led by CEO Chris Lloyd, we are confident that 
HLTH is operating state-of-the-art surgical hospitals/ASCs that we 
expect to organically grow by double-digits through strong physician 
recruitment and a differentiated DTC marketing platform. CEO Lloyd 
owns stock and options representing ~4.7 million shares, ~6% of the 
Company, so is highly invested in the success of the Company which 
we view favorably. Also, contrary to the short analysis, Lloyd has not 
sold any shares. Nobilis recently hired Kenny Klein to the CFO 
position while moving Andy Chen to head revenue cycle 
management efforts. The Company also recently replaced its auditor 
with Crowe Horwath, a top-10 US accounting firm, which we view as 
a major upgrade. We believe HLTH's revenue cycle is a core 
competency so remain very comfortable with the cash flow profile. 
Due to HLTH's high out-of-network business (~70% of revenue), 
DSOs should be high, but we expect 1Q16 cash flow to be strong 
reflecting the highly seasonal nature of the business. The assertion 
that insurance companies do not pay for the spine surgeries that 
HLTH is performing is simply not accurate. On an annualized basis, 
we estimate free cash flow at ~55% of EBITDA-NCI. Further, we are 
comfortable with the Company's accounting for its joint ventures 
which is quite common in the ASC industry due to high physician

Nobilis Health is an owner, operator and manager of

Company is headquartered in Houston, TX. 
Stephens Inc. Page 2 
consumerism proliferate in the US, more healthcare procedures are being delayed until the end of the year when 
deductibles have been exhausted. This is particularly true with higher price-tag surgeries and is exasperated further
for 
HLTH as they are all private pay (other publicly traded ASCs derive roughly a quarter of revenue from government 
payors). To run rate what HLTH has done YTD simply does not reflect reality. We estimate that HLTH generates 57% 
of total 2015 EBITDA-NCI in 4Q and remain highly confident in our $40.8 million estimate. We expect EBITDA-NCI to 
increase ~36% in 2016 to $55.4 million. Our 2016 growth assumes ~15% growth of facilities in the portfolio as of 
January 1, 2015 and an incremental ~$9 million from the Victory hospitals acquired this year. We do not include future 
acquisitions which are likely. 
Valuation discount to peers is comical: HLTH is currently trading at 9.7x our 2015 EBITDA-NCI estimate and 7.1x 
our 2016 estimate. This compares to the peer group averages of 15x and 12.5x, respectively. But, the peer group 
estimated growth rate is ~19% compared to our 36% estimated growth rate for HLTH. (Note: unlike the recent short 
analysis, our valuation analysis does not use Canadian dollars to calculate enterprise value while using USD for the 
denominator). Our $10 PT is based on 13x our Street low 2016 EBITDA-NCI estimate of $55.4 million.

Anyone know if HLTH trading was halted on the NAS on Friday?


On the TSX, IRROC (Canada's FINRA) halted NHC for the single stock circuit breaker reason (share price dropped
10% or more in 5 minutes).


I know such rules exist in the US, but 10% moves seemed to be confined to stocks in the S&P500 or Russell 1000.

Analysts covering the stock came out swinging over the weekend, with a comment from Mackie Research’s
Healthcare analyst Andre Udin,


“Our view: the best evidence of acquisition success is the First Nobilis Hospital (acquired control in September 2014
for $7.5 million, and as of September 2015, management expects it to add $8 to $12 million in EBITDA net to NHC in
F2015, so they will have paid less than 1x EBITDA). The best evidence of organic growth is its same-facility (i.e.
same-store) H1/15 y-y revenue growth of 41%. The article says the stock is overvalued relative to its 2015 guidance,
though the 2016 guidance is more important. The Company’s F2016 guidance contemplates comparatively
conservative growth of 20%, so we believe the guidance is very achievable.”


Keith Hinton, an analyst with Sidoti and Company in New York said in a note yesterday morning, “We strongly
disagree with the conclusions of a recent short report alleging issues with the Nobilis business model.


After the open on Friday, a bearish article was posted to the investor website Seeking Alpha by an anonymous
blogger. The stock immediately began to trade down significantly, and HLTH closed down 27% on more than 4.8
million shares traded (more than 10x normal average trading volume). The author made many claims against Nobilis
and the company’s management team, including claims of deceptive accounting practices and unethical marketing
campaigns, and indicated a 
fair value for HLTH stock of less than $2 per share. We disagree with the majority of points made in the article, and
we remain bullish on Nobilis’ growth and profitability prospects. Furthermore, after the selloff, we think the stock’s
valuation is even more attractive.


Warning to Canadian Companies 
The unwillingness and inability of United States regulators at the SEC to stop what amounts to stock manipulation in
its most blatant form constitutes an emerging and increasingly onerous threat to Canadian companies dually listed in
the United States.


In what has emerged as a regularly perpetrated scam, short sellers commission articles by faceless and nameless
anonymous writers who create huge (3,000 words+) essays of highly dubious and distorted allegations that
essentially paints the target company in a fraudulent and deceptive light. Investors – easily spooked in today’s climate
of volatility – rush to the exits upon publications of the rumours, and seek clarity after the fact.

The short scammers cover their positions and ride off into the sunset with a tidy profit. So far, the SEC hasn’t lifted a
finger to pursue the culprits despite repeated such short assaults against Canadian companies resulting in massive
shareholder losses. The fact that companies are domiciled in Canada renders them of tertiary interest to the SEC,
who prioritize American companies, and because the Seeking Alpha publication is based in Israel, is outside of the
purview of Canadian regulators.


Thus, a regulatory no man’s land has been created.


For its part, Nobilis has issued a 3 page rebuttal of against the representations made in the short seller’s hit piece,
and has convened an independent legal panel to assess the allegations of the hit piece, in view of its destructive
effect on shareholders.


Nobilis is a Buy 
The insidious nature of such negative publicity is in its utterly un-restrained slander against the company, as its
authors exploit the regulatory ambivalence upon which they count. In this piece in Seeking Alpha, the author titles the
piece as “Part 1” implying that there will be more negative research published imminently. This has the effect of
dissuading shareholders who might otherwise be interested in capitalizing on the opportunity to buy Nobilis shares
cheaply.


That being said, in view of the fact that the anonymous author has zero authority, credibility or accuracy, the stock
now remains what is probably today’s greatest opportunity.

4. Our Insiders Remain Significantly Invested in Nobilis and its Successes. 
.


FACT: No Insiders Have “Cashed Out”. Insiders and Management continue to own approximately 25 million shares
and share units. This includes the holdings of Kramer, Fleming, and Lloyd, among others with smaller holdings.
Contrary to the anonymous blogger’s assertions, Chris Lloyd has not sold a single share of Company stock. These
are yet again more facts selectively and deceptively omitted by the anonymous blogger in order to mislead the
investing public.


FACT: Large insider sales by Kramer and Fleming were a matter of extensive public disclosure and occurred at the
request of our investors. Investors demanded the participation of Kramer and Fleming in the May private placement,
to both reduce the concentration of shares held by management and limit the dilutive effect of the capital raise.
Further, the Company chose to participate in the private placement only to the extent that it had a capital need on the
heels of its 25 million dollar debt raise with GE Capital. The facts here simply speak for themselves.

ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) and surgical 
hospitals. The Company, through the acquisition of 
Athas Health in December 2014, is also a pioneer in 
direct-to-patient (DTP) marketing campaigns utilizing

Company is headquartered in Houston, TX.

consumerism proliferate in the US, more healthcare procedures are being delayed until the end of the year when 
deductibles have been exhausted. This is particularly true with higher price-tag surgeries and is exasperated further
for 
HLTH as they are all private pay (other publicly traded ASCs derive roughly a quarter of revenue from government 
payors). To run rate what HLTH has done YTD simply does not reflect reality. We estimate that HLTH generates 57% 
of total 2015 EBITDA-NCI in 4Q and remain highly confident in our $40.8 million estimate. We expect EBITDA-NCI to 
increase ~36% in 2016 to $55.4 million. Our 2016 growth assumes ~15% growth of facilities in the portfolio as of 
January 1, 2015 and an incremental ~$9 million from the Victory hospitals acquired this year. We do not include future 
acquisitions which are likely. 
Valuation discount to peers is comical: HLTH is currently trading at 9.7x our 2015 EBITDA-NCI estimate and 7.1x 
our 2016 estimate. This compares to the peer group averages of 15x and 12.5x, respectively. But, the peer group 
estimated growth rate is ~19% compared to our 36% estimated growth rate for HLTH. (Note: unlike the recent short 
analysis, our valuation analysis does not use Canadian dollars to calculate enterprise value while using USD for the 
denominator). Our $10 PT is based on 13x our Street low 2016 EBITDA-NCI estimate of $55.4 million.

Just verified the last 2 short seller claims - QIWI (15-June) and AQWP (10-Aug). 
Both stocks were already significantly down from their highs before the hit pieces went out. These stocks probably
went lower due to market correction sell off in Aug and these currently trade at : QIWI (~20) and AQWP (~16). What
did short seller articles actually achieve is move AQWP by $2 and QIWI by $7. Compare this with almost 40% market
which is very comparably lower.


In my opinion, NHC is going to be no different, so I will be a buyer at every opportunity. US is going to do well and
specifically markets will start looking at small caps for growth and this is just the kind of stock I look for buying

The Nobilis management team fully supports the decision of the Board's Special Committee and independent
directors to hire attorneys Lanny Davis and Robert Hopper and to conduct an independent review of all the Blogger's
allegations. Management agrees with the decision to report on findings of fact directly to the Special Committee and
independent directors, and supports the Board's commitment to publish the results of the independent review.


Nobilis Management has reviewed the anonymous blogger's spurious and misleading posting on the crowd funded
website Seeking Alpha and provided comment on the company's website at: http://tinyurl.com/nhn... or
http://bit.ly/1PbhPY2


Management would like to point out that the author is a self-admitted short-seller who stands to make substantial
profits via distortions that lead to an erosion in investor confidence followed by a sharp decrease in the Company's
share price.


Evidence accompanying official demands for inquiry regarding the post as it relates to a market manipulation scheme
has been filed with the Ontario Securities Commission by Canadian financial institutions.


As to the facts in response to the blog, we await the work of the Special Committee formed by the Board, which
retained independent counsel Robert Hopper and Lanny Davis, to complete its independent review and publish the
results, regardless of what they are.

Look at transaction in Canadian Insider it shows the insider buying in few thousand of stocks routinely. While less
than 10,000 stock insider buys can be ignored, but there is also insider private acquisition of ~1million stock acquired
at 6.80USD on 16-Aug, this is significant.


Why would insider buy 1million position ?

Why didn't they hire a well known firm like Sidley Austin? If all they are doing is rebutting factual allegations, we don't
need attack dogs or PR people.


You people keep attacking the guy who wrote this article as if the history of Kramer and Fleming were somehow
untrue. I know that history and I wouldn't trust either of them in any way.


How many of the houses that have come out to defend NHC (2 so far?) got fees from underwriting the private
placement?


What I want to see is an explanation about how they paid so much more for a company like Athas less than 2 years
after it was worth almost nothing; how the qualifications of the people running the company were not made clear; a
factual statement about whether accurascope is or is not an FDA (or whichever regulating body) approved treatment
(it might even be a quack treatment for all I know); how compensation for management was determined etc.


Those are the real allegations in the blog article and they need to be investigated. Given the history of NHC (which
traded for pennies on the verge of bankruptcy not so long ago), these allegations should be investigated by the SEC,
TSX, the AMA (or whichever professional society deals with back surgery) and the Texas or Federal District Attorney's
office IMHO on behalf of shareholders. If there were violations of securities laws, I want prosecutions and jail time.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3561556-nobilis-fall-nobility-part-65-percent-downside 58/68


William Mitchell College of Law 
Doctor of Jurisprudence (J.D.) (1984 – 1987) 
Activities and Societies: “Excellence in Trial Advocacy” Award


Note the date: 1987. Also from his website:


Randy Hopper is the Founder and Managing Partner of Robert R. Hopper & Associates, L.L.C., a
professional firm he founded in 1978.


He founded his law firm before he had a JD! (?). More importantly. His degree is from William Mitchell College
of Law. From the law school rankings,


http://bit.ly/1MQNxbJ


it's ranked 142. Close to the bottom of the list. There are only 149 schools in that ranking.


This is a small law firm from Minnesota. Nothing at all like a Sidley Austin or Kirkland. Why didn't they hire a
well-known firm?


Let me also help you with Lanny Davis. From wiki:


Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer and columnist for Salon, criticized Davis in 2009 for Davis's perceived failure to
disclose his clients. Greenwald asserted his clients included dictatorships and opponents of unions and health
care reform.[22]


According to Salon columnist Justin Elliot, Davis "specializes in lobbying for controversial corporate and
foreign clients, particularly those seeking Democratic representation in Washington".[23] He has "built a client
list that now includes oligarchic coup supporters in Honduras, a dictator in Equatorial Guinea, for-profit
colleges accused of exploiting students, and a company that dominates the manufacture of additives for
infant formula", as well as an "Ivory Coast strongman whose claims to that country’s presidency have been
condemned by the international community and may even set off a civil war". Among his clients are "Ivory
Coast leader and flagrant human rights violator Laurent Gbagbo" and "Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,
the longtime dictator of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea."[23] "Just as Davis was assuring the American press that
his client, Gbagbo, opposed violence, Gbagbo's forces were in fact mounting a campaign of organized
violence against the opposition".[24] The latter representation has earned him criticism from human rights
groups, who claim that he "appears to be engaged in little more than a whitewashing exercise designed to
rehabilitate the image of the Obiang regime on the international stage".[25] Similar criticisms were aired in an
acerbic exchange with Jon Lovett in The Atlantic.[26]


Is this the kind of person this company needs to defend itself? How about some facts? Is the spinal center for
real, FDA approved, legitimate? Why did they pay so much for that company 2 years after it was worth close
to nothing? Were problems and lawsuits by patients disclosed?


This is what I want to know. Not BS and crisis managing lawyers (one with a name degree and the other with
about as no name a degree as you can hold). BTW: do you work for the company? If you were a shareholder
like me, you should be irate that such issues were not disclosed to us. Or if the article is factually untrue then
it should be simple to refute the allegations.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(Business Wire)-- 
AmSurg Corp. (Nasdaq: AMSG) today announced a proposal to combine with Team

ratio of 0.768x AmSurg shares per TeamHealth share, which will result in pro

receive cash consideration of $11.49 per share. The proposal has a total current 
value of $71.47 per TeamHealth share, or a total enterprise value of $7.8 
billion, based on AmSurg`s closing stock price yesterday. This represents a 
current premium of 36% to TeamHealth shareholders.


Christopher A. Holden, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmSurg, said, 
"Our proposed combination will be transformational for both AmSurg and 
TeamHealth shareholders as well as for the physician services sector as a whole. 
TeamHealth shareholders will receive immediate cash value equivalent to 22% of 
its market capitalization, and share equally in our combined company`s upside. 
The combined company will have significantly enhanced free cash flow, expanded 
opportunities to accelerate growth, an attractive risk profile, $200 million to 
$290 million in annual synergies, and the ability to rapidly de-leverage. 
Comprising a network of more than 1,200 healthcare facilities and approximately 
20,000 clinicians, AmSurg and TeamHealth together will become the most 
comprehensive provider of outsourced clinical services to health systems, and 
will create a platform for unprecedented growth in the sector. Together, we will 
hold leading positions in several industry verticals: ambulatory surgery, 
anesthesia, emergency services, hospitalists, radiology and neonatology."


"This combination will be a true partnership that will integrate our 
industry-leading physician sub-specialties and expand and deepen the combined 
company`s health system relationships, instantly creating an extensive national 
geographic footprint," said Mr. Holden. "Our combined scale and comprehensive 
service portfolio, coupled with a shared commitment to quality and coordination 
of care and maintaining close physician relationships, will have tremendous 
benefits for our health system clients, payers, physicians, and the employees of 
both companies."


Mr. Holden added, "We believe AmSurg`s successful acquisition and integration of 
Sheridan can serve as a roadmap for the partnership with TeamHealth. The 
financial performance of AmSurg since closing that transaction has exceeded our 
initial public guidance on every metric. Engaging now also gives us the 
opportunity to further enhance shareholder value by optimizing the financing of 
the AmSurg/TeamHealth and TeamHealth/IPC transactions and could decrease 
aggregate financing expense by $100 million to $150 million. We believe strongly 
in this combination and hope TeamHealth`s Board will engage with us promptly to 
reach an agreed transaction."


Under the terms of the proposed merger, the combined company would assume the 
TeamHealth name, and TeamHealth would continue to operate out of its 
headquarters. The Board of Directors will include representatives from AmSurg 
and TeamHealth. Mr. Holden will be Chief Executive Officer and will lead a

management team comprised of senior leaders from both organizations. The AmSurg 
and Sheridan operations will retain their brands.


Guggenheim Securities and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are acting as financial

connection with the proposed transaction.

proposed merger in September 2015. Below is the text of a letter that was sent

Apparently the author of this hatchet job is an employee of a certain hedge fund out of Toronto. It now looks like legal
proceedings are under way against them. I bought this stock 30 minutes before it plummeted on Oct 9th and was
directly affected by their actions. Next time someone posts something about a company consider if it is a balanced
argument or a self serving rip off job like the above. I don’t know if Seeking Alpha will publish this but I think they are
partially responsible for this too. And for all the people who thought this was such a great piece of research engage

what are you talking about? the whole point discussed here is that the article is compeltely false after
independent review. 
Ron Geffner, regulator, spoke on BNN and mentioned that in case Anson is indeed liable and had misled the
audience, plus aplied aggressive types of short selling, they could face charhes. For seeking alpha it would
then also be difficult to argue there was no wrong doing on their side

Nobilis Sues Anson Funds and Anson Analyst Sunny Puri for $300 Million 
HOUSTON, TX--(Marketwired - November 05, 2015) - Nobilis Health Corp. (NYSE MKT: HLTH) (TSX: NHC) ("Nobilis"
or the "Company") announced today that it has filed suit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Sunny Puri,
Anson Canada, Anson LP, Anson Capital, Anson Investment Fund, and Anson Catalyst Fund, along with John Does 1
through 20. The claim alleges that these individuals perpetrated a scheme to damage Nobilis' reputation and business
relationships in order to profit through short-selling of Nobilis stock. Nobilis is seeking monetary damages in excess of
$300,000,000 along with punitive damages. Nobilis expects to add more Anson affiliates and other participants in the
scheme as defendants.


The complaint specifically alleges that the Anson family of hedge funds and associated-individuals devised and
participated in a "short attack" scheme against the Plaintiff, Nobilis Health Corp., in which the defendants broadcast
false and defamatory information about Nobilis in order to drive down the price of Nobilis' publicly traded stock (the
"Nobilis Common Stock") so that the defendants could profit from short positions they had taken in Nobilis Common
Stock and derivative securities thereof. The key to the scheme was the written attack (the "Article") on Nobilis'
business which the defendants prepared and anonymously posted under the pseudonym "The Emperor Has No

Clothes" to the website "Seeking Alpha" (http://bit.ly/89UJPz) ("Seeking Alpha"). The Article made numerous
statements of purported "fact" about Nobilis' business that were false and defamatory, including allegations that the
Company's auditors resigned amid controversy (untrue), CFOs had been shuffled to hide impropriety (untrue),
insiders had sold all of their Nobilis Common Stock (untrue), that the Company was hiding poor performance behind
acquisitions (untrue), that major insurers would not pay for certain medical procedures billed by Nobilis (untrue), and
several other false, defamatory and misleading statements.


Nobilis Common Stock traded at $6.81 at the open of trading on Toronto Stock Exchange on October 9, 2015 -- the
day the Article was broadcast. At close that day the price was $4.93. Over the next two weeks Nobilis Common Stock
continued trading downward to a low of $2.83, a drop of approximately 60% from price at the open of trading on
October 9, 2015. That decline translates to a loss of over $300,000,000 million in market capitalization.


Nobilis believes it is entitled to damages for reputational harm, disruption of its business and affairs, loss of corporate
opportunities, costs of investigating and correcting the false and defamatory statements, costs of defending against
investor litigation initiated as a result of the false and defamatory information, and other consequential damages
resulting from the defendants' scheme and market manipulation.


The case is Nobilis Health Corp. v. Sunny Puri, M5V Advisors, Inc (c.o.b. as Anson Group Canada), Admiralty
Advisors, LLC, Frigate Ventures, LP, Anson Investments LP, Anson Capital, LC, Anson Investments Master Fund, LP,
AIMF, GP, Anson Catalyst Master Fund, LP, ACF GP, and John Does 1 through 20, Court File No. CV-15-11162-0000,
Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Nobilis management is in discussions with US-based counsel regarding the
Company's legal recourse against parties located in the United States.

There seems to be a trend of shorting Canadian listed companies. But this is creating some very good opportunities.
The best one,to my mind, was DH corp. I have no problems with short sellers in general. None whatsoever. The
question is simply was there fraud? It will not be simple to figure that out however and the emperor can now afford
some very good legal counsel.

16X EPS whereas it traded at 43x EPS before the article. Granted it growing fast we should heva better

Jesus,


Look at the way this stock crashed from ~$19 CDN to twelve @#$% cents. Noone can believe that the only problem
with this company is outside stock manipulators.

I disagree. We've had a terrible downturn since August and the Healthcare sector in particular has been slammed.
This stock is in the penalty box in the market's eyes. I really it is very under valued but right now the market
psychology is against it. If you own it I would hold it. If you don't own it I would consider it a good purchase at these
levels. Just my opinion of course.

Set new lows today at $2.56 as the slide continues. health sector is toxic now and oil going higher.
