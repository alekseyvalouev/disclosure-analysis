J2 is a digital media roll-up that has acquired 186 businesses since its inception. Its CEO describes the company’s


“acquisition system” as its “single great competitive advantage”.


We suggest the contrary and believe J2’s opaque acquisition approach has opened the door to egregious insider


self-enrichment, which we approximate totals $98 million to $128 million based on publicly available


information.


For example, we uncovered that J2 acquired a newly formed entity based out of its own VP of Corporate


Development’s personal residence for $900 thousand. The entity had unde�ned “intellectual property” and no


employees or apparent assets. No con�ict was disclosed.


The VP of Corporate Development who was on the receiving end of the payday handled 135 of J2’s acquisitions,


representing ~73% of the company’s acquisitions to date.


It appears to be a pattern. J2’s Chairman formerly controlled


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000156459018030855/lens-8k_20181210.htm) a di�erent


publicly traded company alongside the noted VP, stacked with various J2 board members and insiders. Its


European subsidiary racked up ~€14 million in losses despite having virtually no assets. The entity was based


out of the same personal residence and was also acquired in part through a related party transaction with the


Chairman. The stock of the parent company is down ~99%.


J2 recently committed $200 million of shareholder cash to a newly-formed investment vehicle run by its


Chairman, who has a track record of venture investment failures. The investment vehicle’s leadership includes


other J2 execs and insiders. J2 expects to commit another $100 million to the vehicle.


That investment vehicle, in turn, made its �rst investment of an estimated $12 million into a newly-formed


home video business established by the Chairman’s nephew. That business is already dormant, according to a


former employee.  Once again, no con�ict was disclosed.


Despite J2’s proxy describing all but one of its board members as “independent”, we found decades of


intertwined �nancial interests between board members and executives, calling that independence into


question.


Concurrently, a slowing stream of acquisitions has helped to unearth a decline in J2’s key business metrics:


digital tra�c is down (despite support from recent acquisitions), and cloud cancel rates are ticking up with ARPU


falling.


J2 Global: Troubling Related Party Transactions,
Looming Impairments And A Suspicious History Of
Insider Enrichment Spanning Decades


Published on June 30, 2020



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000156459018030855/lens-8k_20181210.htm
The underperformance has been masked by tricky accounting. The company has never taken a goodwill


impairment, yet subsidiary �lings report multiple material goodwill impairments that don’t appear to coincide


with parent �nancials. We estimate at least $155 million in impairments based on visibility into $700 million in


acquisitions.


J2’s European business (13% of revenue in 2016), which was overseen by the aforementioned VP of Corporate


Development, has seen its revenue decline 27% in the subsequent 3 years with operating income swinging from


$5.5 million to negative $13 million.


We believe the company’s audit committee simply cannot be relied upon, as a majority of the committee has


worked together for years prior to serving on the board of J2 in roles that reveal con�icts of interest.


The “independent” board approved the cancellation of J2’s dividend to “create greater shareholder returns over


the near, medium and long term”. This apparently includes massive loss-making capital commitments and


management fees to related parties.


J2’s young, newly minted CEO was compensated over $45 million during his �rst year in the role, more than the


CEOs of Microsoft and J.P. Morgan, despite J2 being a fraction of the size. We can’t help but wonder whether the


board and executive team could be simply trading favors, in a manner consistent with J2’s actions for decades.


COVID-19 has now o�cially halted the company’s acquisition model. We feel this is a crucial opportunity for


the company’s auditors to examine all of the transactions we lay out in this report (including all


acquisitions made under the former VP of Corporate Development) and take necessary measures to prevent


what we believe to be additional misuse of shareholder capital going forward.


Update 7/1: Following publication, the company responded


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630006133/en/J2-Global-Responds-False-Claims-Distortions-Short-Seller),


including a clari�cation on a transaction we had estimated, along with various other explanations. We have updated the


piece to replace our estimate number with the newly-reported number, and to add other elements of their response.


Introduction To J2 Global


J2 Global describes itself (https://www.j2global.com/about/) as a “leading internet information and services company”.


Its business consists of a portfolio of over 40 major digital media brands, including well-known sites such as IGN,


Mashable.com, SpeedTest.net and numerous others (https://www.j2global.com/brands/technology/).


The company started (https://www.forbes.com/2004/02/04/cx_ah_0204j2global.html#4061134957e3) as “JFax” in


1995, originally focused on forwarding faxes and voicemail messages to e-mail. It changed its name to “J2 Global


Communications” in 2000 to pursue a more diversi�ed strategy.


These days, the company can best be described as a perpetual roll-up that has engaged in a decade-long spree of


acquisitions in the digital media space.


J2 segments its business into two categories: “Cloud Services” and “Digital Media”. [Pg. 16 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000026/jcom-20200331.htm)] The company’s Cloud Services


business generates ~48% of its revenue from its legacy online fax service customers, but also includes online backup


services, e-mail services, encryption services and other subscription-based cloud services.[1]


The digital media side generates revenues primarily from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees,


performance marketing and licensing fees.

In the past, notable short sellers [1 (https://citronresearch.com/citron-exposes-the-dirty-secrets-of-j2-global-jcom/),2


(http://www.glasshouseresearch.com/reports/accounting-concerns-�nally-catch-up-with-j2-global-jcom)] have taken


aim at J2’s roll-up model, alleging aggressive accounting and unsustainable business metrics. The company has


withstood these critiques, helped by sell-side cheerleading of J2’s acquisition roll-up model and economic tailwinds


that had buoyed most businesses.


Today we bring new evidence to light that we believe should catalyze an auditor intervention —we have discovered a


series of related-party transactions that appear designed to enrich insiders over the course of the past decade. We


have also found evidence of undisclosed goodwill impairments at JCOM’s subsidiaries.


Combining the above with what we believe is a complete lack of corporate governance at the company, we think our


�ndings should be a wake-up call for J2’s shareholders and its auditors. We are notifying their auditors of our �ndings


as well.


The Bull Case: J2 is a Finely-Tuned Acquisition Machine That Has Grown
Revenue For 24 Straight Years and Has Generated Positive Operating
Cash Flow


J2 bulls argue that the company is a growing �nancial powerhouse, having achieved


(https://www.j2global.com/about/) 24 consecutive �scal years of revenue growth. It is an active acquirer of


businesses, having deployed approximately $3 billion of acquisition capital since its founding to acquire 186 di�erent


companies (https://www.j2global.com/about/).


It has never taken a goodwill impairment in its history, which bulls point to as an example of its disciplined acquisition


approach.


The company’s CEO, Vivek Shah, recently stated:


“If you asked me, ‘what is the single great competitive advantage of the company’? It’s that acquisition


system.” [3:52 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5hakF4CABQ&feature=youtu.be&t=232)]


The company says (https://www.j2global.com/about/acquisitions) its “deep industry knowledge, technological


expertise and investment acumen” allows it to invest capital wisely and successfully integrate each acquisition. The


company has generated $418 million in operating cash �ow over the TTM period, with 34% EBITDA margins. [Source:


FactSet]


J2 now consists of over 40 major brands with 4.6 million subscribers and over 1,100 advertising partners.


A March 4, 2020 investor presentation (https://investor.j2global.com/Cache/IRCache/4f7e7018-af01-0da3-d06e-

�rm as having “exceptional �nancial performance”. Its charts paint the picture of a perfectly consistent growth


trajectory.

From the outside, JCOM looks like a perfectly tuned acquisition machine that has integrated hundreds of disparate


media companies into a cash �ow-generating powerhouse.


Reality Check: The Stark Reality At J2 Includes Insider Self-Dealing, An
Alarming Lack Of Governance Since Inception, Looming Financial
Impairments And A Legacy Business In Decline


Contrary to the picture that the company has painted, we found a vastly di�erent reality at J2.


Related Party Transactions: J2 and its executives have a several decades long history of related party acquisitions


and undisclosed self-dealing, including:


1. Using $900 thousand in shareholder capital to acquire a newly-formed entity set up by J2’s then VP of Corporate


Development. The entity was headquartered at his personal residence in the Netherlands, and the con�ict was


never disclosed.


2. Committing $200 million of shareholder cash to the J2 Chairman’s newly-formed VC �rm despite a consistent


track record of prior investment failures. J2 expects to commit an additional $100 million, for a total of $300


million.


3. One of the earliest investments made by the VC vehicle, an estimated $12 million, was to an entity whose


incorporation documents list J2 Chairman Richard Ressler’s nephew and lawyer – an indirect related party


transaction. We discuss this entity in more detail below.


4. J2 Chairman’s track record includes the initial backing (https://bhcourier.com/2010/01/22/assil-named-to-


medical-advisory-board/), majority ownership


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000156459017024943/lens-ex991_7.htm), directorship and


a�liated executive role (https://www.ocbj.com/news/2017/dec/20/presbia-cuts-back-execs-resign/) in publicly


traded biotech company called Presbia that itself operated a newly-formed entity out of the exact same


personal residence owned by J2’s VP of Corporate Development. That company has seen its stock fall ~99%


in the last 5 years.


5. Previously, J2 had acquired yet another entity based out of the same employee’s personal residence back in


2004.



https://bhcourier.com/2010/01/22/assil-named-to-medical-advisory-board/

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000156459017024943/lens-ex991_7.htm

https://www.ocbj.com/news/2017/dec/20/presbia-cuts-back-execs-resign/
To reiterate: J2’s former VP of Corporate Development had formed 3 entities out of his house that were then


acquired/operated by J2 and another company headed by J2’s Chairman that cost/incurred losses totaling an


estimated $11 million.


That same VP of Corporate Development was responsible for 135 M&A transactions at J2, according to his LinkedIn


pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=bf&trkInfo=AQG0WUpCDH-


MMgAAAXFkQYYggYOFPofTozWCEt2ulN5C6W8-


ZBkqCCvb5Xkfc8SyuWLGXhEVYTxCWJTDuQWryNL6kqKdLRDL38Ih8sFrZT6oiXvWjntlsM0tmh5ppYLd4Dzk2O0=&origina


lReferer=&sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjeroen-van-der-weijden-2331a7%2F). That


number represents ~73% of the acquisitions in the company’s history.


J2 has historically provided limited disclosure to investors on its acquisition portfolio, raising the prospect of broader


malfeasance given 1) this individual’s oversight of these transactions and 2) the close ties he had with the company’s


Chairman.  He was also integral in J2’s European expansion, helping J2 acquire dozens of businesses. Contrary to sell-


side perception, many of these businesses have shown signi�cant fundamental deterioration and warrant further


impairment testing.


Executive enrichment: Executives have also enriched themselves overtly, which shareholders have ignored due to


J2’s perceived impressive growth: J2 paid $45 million in total compensation to its CEO in 2018 [Pg. 38


(https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/107261319000140?cik=1084048)]; more than the CEO of $1 trillion dollar


Microsoft and $250 billion J.P. Morgan. Shah was named CEO


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170928005358/en/j2-Global-Announces-Vivek-Shah-Chief-Executive)


three days after J2 agreed to commit $200 million to the investment vehicle managed by J2’s


(http://ocvpartners.com/team/) outgoing CEO, the EVP of Strategy, and the current Chairman. [Pg. 51


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000107261319000140/def14a_18300.htm)] We �nd it uncanny


that Shah was awarded a ludicrous pay package precisely when related party transactions diverted assets to other


key insiders.


J2 Executive Excess Self-Enrichment


Undisclosed Goodwill & Intangible Impairments: Whereas J2 hasn’t recognized goodwill impairments at its parent


level, audits at J2’s subsidiaries show a slew of goodwill impairments. We have also found signs that multiple


acquisitions are clearly underperforming and likely necessitate obvious impairments that haven’t been taken.



https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=bf&trkInfo=AQG0WUpCDH-MMgAAAXFkQYYggYOFPofTozWCEt2ulN5C6W8-ZBkqCCvb5Xkfc8SyuWLGXhEVYTxCWJTDuQWryNL6kqKdLRDL38Ih8sFrZT6oiXvWjntlsM0tmh5ppYLd4Dzk2O0=&originalReferer=&sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fjeroen-van-der-weijden-2331a7%2F

http://ocvpartners.com/team/

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000107261319000140/def14a_18300.htm
1. As one example, a key J2 subsidiary recorded an €22 million impairment despite zero goodwill impairment


recognized at the parent corporation.


2. Of J2’s 14 “feature” web-based brands, 9 have seen Alexa tra�c rankings plummet in the past several years,


making them obvious candidates for goodwill impairments.


3. Trouble with the perfect acquisition machine:


Everyday Health, J2’s largest acquisition, saw an immediate post-acquisition revenue drop of ~25%, yet no


impairment was recorded. Instead, J2 went on a spree of asset disposals/acquisitions that obfuscated the


entity’s �nancial position.


J2’s key European subsidiary has seen its revenue decline 27% in the past 3 years, with operating income


swinging from €5.2 million to negative €11.5 million.


4. VDW, a dissolved undisclosed related-party transaction that should likely be a full write-o�.


5. The VC vehicle J2 has invested in has an asset that appears to be a con�icted related party. A former employee


we spoke with said the operations are currently dormant and its sta� have been laid o�. (Note that another of


the VC vehicle investments is down 50% since IPO which will re�ect on the �nancials on a mark-to-market basis.)


Even though the company has completed $2bn of acquisitions since 2012, mostly in digital media (and cloud services


businesses), J2’s predominant legacy fax segment still represented 64% of LTM operating income. Last quarter, it


accounted for 83% of operating income despite the time, cash, and assumed debt through J2’s acquisition spree.


Approximately ~$700m of acquisitions for which we have visibility are seeing revenue declines, appear to be


underperforming, or have been outright dissolved.  That is approximately 1/3 of acquisitions completed since 2012


(of $2bn) – yet we have seen no impairment of goodwill to date. We estimate $155 million in impairments across this


subset based on our review. If extrapolated across the acquisitions for which we have zero to little visibility the


picture likely worsens.


The disproportionate underperformance of the marquee Everyday Health acquisition should round-out the need for


investigation. The opaque nature of J2’s M&A program has also left investors in the dark on the magnitude of insider


enrichment and fundamental deterioration of the underlying businesses.


Corporate governance appears to be non-existent—Clear Con�icts Among Independent Board Members


The current situation at J2 has been enabled by a corporate governance vacuum. The Chairman and multiple


“independent


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000016/j22020proxystatement.htm)” board


members, including the chairs of the audit and compensation committees, have numerous overlapping business


interests, calling their actual independence into question.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000016/j22020proxystatement.htm
1. “Independent” Chairman Richard Ressler has outside business ties with much of the board, along with


multiple J2 executives. As noted above, Ressler’s new investment �rm Orchard Capital Ventures (“OCV”), which


itself is sta�ed with senior J2 executives, received a $200 million commitment from J2’s shareholders, with the


expectation that it will increase to $300 million. [ 21 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000026/jcom-20200331.htm)] The transfer was approved by


J2’s audit committee [Pg. 22 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000026/jcom-20200331.htm)], which is Chaired by long time


Ressler associate Brian Kretzmer.


2. “Independent” director and audit committee chair, Brian Kretzmer, has a work history with J2 Chairman


Richard Ressler dating back nearly three decades.


Most importantly, Kretzmer consulted for the OCV a�liate (http://ocvpartners.com/2017/09/22/richard-ressler/)


Orchard Capital (https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?


q=cache:g6_mhAI8ZvUJ:https://www.kretzmerconsulting.com/services.html+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). This is a


�agrant con�ict of interest, given that as chair of the audit committee Kretzmer then approved the $200 million


commitment of J2 Capital to OCV.


This con�ict was not disclosed to investors. Instead, it appears steps were taken to conceal it. Kretzmer removed his


role at Orchard from his personal website (https://www.kretzmerconsulting.com/key-assignments.html), but we can


see from an earlier Google cached version (https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?


q=cache:g6_mhAI8ZvUJ:https://www.kretzmerconsulting.com/services.html+&cd=5&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) that


Kretzmer worked on M&A for Orchard Capital:


Beyond working for the predecessor entity of a $200 million related-party transaction that he “independently”


approved, Kretzmer had additional ties to Ressler. Kretzmer was CEO of IT company MAI Systems Corp while Ressler


was Chairman. [Pg. 19 (http://get�lings.com/o0000892569-02-000822.html)] Kretzmer was also a Director at


investment company CIM Real Estate Finance Trust (https://www.cimgroup.com/about/leadership/w-brian-kretzmer),


founded by Ressler. He also worked with telecommunications company Universal Telecom


(https://www.kretzmerconsulting.com/key-assignments.html), one of Ressler’s former portfolio companies

Ressler and director/audit committee chair Kretzmer. Ross served as director (http://get�lings.com/o0000892569-02-

Digital media business in decline. The company’s other segment, digital media, is showing sharp declines in page


views among key brands. The segment also faces headwinds from the Covid-19-associated economic crisis,


particularly as advertising budgets and rates are slashed across the board.


Overall: Investors in the Dark and Auditors Sitting On Their Hands Leads to J2 Global’s Equity Being


Uninvestible


Investors have taken for granted that the company’s acquisition spree has been additive. Yet the absence of thorough


disclosure related to the company’s governance and unexamined deals has left investors in the dark to potential


write-o�s and insider self-dealing. This state of a�airs has been permitted by a lack of truly independent board


oversight and a sleepy auditor. All told, we think J2’s executives have used the booming equity markets to steadily


enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders.


At the moment, shareholders likely feel secure with the business generating free cash �ow (~$75 million as of last


quarter (https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000026/jcom-20200331.htm)). 


But its reported growth metrics (both cash �ow and revenue) have largely relied on acquisitions. The company has


paid $375 million for acquisitions over the past 4 quarters alone. On the company’s recent quarterly conference call,


management announced a halt on M&A due to COVID-19. In the absence of M&A, we expect free cash �ow will


materially erode over the coming quarters, leaving shareholders with a $1.5 billion pile of debt that presents a danger


to equity holders.


We think this is a crucial time for auditors to closely examine the evidence we will present below.


Part I: Related Party Transactions And Insider Self-
Dealing


J2 Shareholder Cash Was Used to Purchase A Newly-Formed Entity Based
Out of J2’s Long-Serving VP of Corporate Development’s Personal
Residence In The Netherlands


As we will show, we think J2 has engaged in insider self-dealing for a long time, continuing to this day, with investors


completely unaware.


In one obvious example, in 2015, the company acquired an 11-month old entity based out of a J2 employee’s


apartment in the Netherlands for $900 thousand, without disclosing it as a related-party deal.


The J2 employee, Jeroen van der Weijden, had a decade-long relationship with J2’s Chairman and had worked at J2 for


at least 11 years by the time of the acquisition, per his LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?


trk=bf&trkInfo=AQG0WUpCDH-MMgAAAXFkQYYggYOFPofTozWCEt2ulN5C6W8-

that post-publication, the company stated that Jeroen was a consultant not an employee, contrary to the


representations on the LinkedIn pro�le. Per the same LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?

“sourced and handled over 135 M&A transactions” for J2 since 2004, serving as “GM Europe” and “VP Corporate


Development”.


This apparently included advising the company to purchase his own entity where he was the sole employee and its


“intellectual property”.


The Company Completely Failed to Disclose the Clear Con�ict (And
Barely Disclosed the Deal at All)


In October 2015, J2 announced in a press release


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151005005526/en/j2-Global%C2%AE-Raises-Guidance) that it had


acquired 9 businesses. Among the acquisitions, listed under “Intellectual Property” on the press release, was a


company called VDW (Netherlands).

J2’s 2015 annual report (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/108404816000015?cik=1084048) did not mention the


transaction by name or give any more color on it. Since the press release tucking it in with eight other acquisitions


was the only evidence we could �nd of the transaction, it was easy to miss.


The company only reported the initials of the entity, “VDW”. Its full name, according to Dutch corporate records


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/3CyJSdaYrnHOmE), is actually Van der Weijden M&A Consultancy BV. It was set up


11 months earlier, in December 2014, in the name of long-time J2 employee Jeroen van der Weijden, according to the


same records. Perhaps that is why the company thought “VDW” was a better choice for its disclosures.


The company was registered to Van der Weijden’s personal residence in Amsterdam (at Pieter Pauwstraat 2A-H),


according to the same corporate records, and listed a total of zero employees.

https://www.kadaster.nl/
The company never disclosed the purchase price for VDW, but based on an analysis of the price of the other


transactions that quarter we estimated the number.[2] We emailed the company asking to provide the number and


had not received a response as of publication.[3]


Following publication, the company disclosed (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630006133/en/J2-


Global-Responds-False-Claims-Distortions-Short-Seller) the purchase price. It also stated that Jeroen was a consultant


not an employee, contrary to the representation on his LinkedIn pro�le.


We urge the company to provide shareholders and its auditors full detail on this transaction along with any additional


con�icted transactions.


As we will show, this personal residence housed four di�erent businesses: (1) J2 Global NV (2) VDW (3) Presbia


(discussed below), and (4) a business run by Jeroen’s brothers.


A Month Later, the Newly Enriched Employee Purchased a California
Mansion


About one month after the purchase of his “Intellectual Property” company, Jeroen bought a $2.5 million mansion in


California with a heated saltwater pool, tennis court and steam room, according to California real estate records.

The Acquired Entity Was Dissolved Shortly A�er the Employee Le� the
Firm


Jeroen left J2 in 2018, according to his LinkedIn pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-van-der-weijden-2331a7/).


The Netherlands Chamber of Commerce registry for VDW says that the corporation had been dissolved shortly


thereafter, e�ective October 18, 2019.


(Source: www.kvk.nl (http://www.kvk.nl) company pro�le for Van der Weijden M&A Consultancy BV


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/hLFORDhtcjoJ9))


Given that Jeroen was already working for J2 as an M&A advisor, per his Linkedin Pro�le, we found it tremendously


odd that the company acquired his M&A advisory consultancy �rm, without disclosing the obvious con�ict, then just


dissolved the entity shortly after he left. In the company’s response post-publication, it stated the dissolving


corporate entities following acquisition is normal. 


Lastly, and perhaps most troubling, Jeroen held key responsibility for the 135+ acquisitions he oversaw while at J2. We


only went through a fraction of the deals (largely because of J2’s opaque disclosures) and found obvious red �ags. Per


Jeroen’s LinkedIn pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-van-der-weijden-2331a7/), he managed:


“Sourcing and handling over 135 M&A transactions, while managing all aspects of the acquisition process


from scoping, planning, execution, follow up, and reporting.”

Note that J2 has completed 186 acquisitions, suggesting that Jeroen, who was apparently the bene�ciary and key


participant in an undisclosed related-party transaction, was involved in over 73% of J2’s acquisitions.  Given that the


audit committee nor the head of M&A appear to be functioning appropriately, it is our view that independent and


external parties should conduct investigations on each and every one of the 135 deals that Jeroen oversaw.


Related Party Transactions and Insider Self-Dealing: J2 Committed �200
Million Of Shareholder Cash to a Newly-Formed Investment Vehicle �un
by J2’s Chairman, Richard Ressler


Two years after the VDW acquisition, J2 continued its string of insider self-dealing with a massive allocation of cash to


an investment entity controlled by insiders.


In 2017, J2 committed $200 million of shareholder funds to Orchard Capital Ventures (“OCV”), a venture capital fund


formed in the prior year (https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=201617910410-20931274) by


J2’s Chairman Richard Ressler. Ressler is OCV’s majority equity owner despite J2 comprising almost 77% of the equity


of the fund. [Pg. 88 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000012/jcom2019123110-


k.htm#s17B963005B4958AABB1C1805AA5D13BE)] [Pg. 21 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?


doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000026/jcom-20200331.htm)]


The deal was approved by J2’s audit committee [Pg. 51


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000107261319000140/def14a_18300.htm)], which as we detail


further in Part II, likely unbeknownst to investors, appears heavily con�icted.


We calculate that J2 will pay OCV $36 million in management fees alone, given its fee structure. [Pg. 88


(https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000012/jcom2019123110-k.htm), Pg. 2


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404818000001/jcom20171231ex-109.htm)] This could


increase if the fund earns any performance fees.


It might seem strange that (once again) J2 is paying millions to its own insiders to invest in ventures, given that J2


is already in the business of investing in and acquiring other ventures.


The overlap with J2’s business model is clear from OCV’s own description (http://www.ocvpartners.com/portfolio/) of


itself:


“OCV’s core focus sectors include information technology, cloud businesses, e-commerce, media &


telecommunications, life sciences & healthcare, and clean technology.”


Meanwhile, J2’s website (https://www.j2global.com/about/acquisitions/) states:


“At J2 Global, we seek to acquire and support internet-enabled companies in a variety of sectors, including


media, technology and services.”

https://www.j2global.com/about/acquisitions/
Bizarrely, when pressed on this issue, J2 seemingly tried to explain this away by stating that OCV’s investments are a


strategic mis�t for J2. Speci�cally, the company claimed to be shelling out the $200 million in order to


(https://investor.j2global.com/�le/Index?KeyFile=390450412) “invest in promising businesses and technologies that


were not a �t with J2’s public company environment.”


The lack of liquidity in these investments is noteworthy. J2’s leverage has continued to climb and has constrained J2’s


balance sheet. The company’s dividend was suspended


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190507006140/en/j2-Global-Reports-Quarter-2019-


Results#:~:text=j2%20also%20announced%20that%20its,retain%20and%20redirect%20that%20cash) in mid-2019,


making room for large capital calls into its Chairman’s illiquid investment vehicle.


J2 Chairman Richard Ressler’s Track Record Includes a Slew of Failures,
Along With Signs of Other Undisclosed Related-Party Dealings


Given that the newly-formed OCV had no track record, we explored Ressler’s track record outside of J2 in order to


understand whether the massive diversion of resources to his �rm was the best possible use of investor capital.


We found that Ressler’s other venture investments comprised a remarkable string of investment failures, marred by


signs of related-party transactions and forms of self-enrichment. A brief case study of his investment in a company


called Presbia follows. (In Appendix A we break down Ressler’s track record – in summary, 10/12 investments were 0s


or near 0s.) 


Other venture investors seem to have come to the same conclusion on Ressler’s track record. In January 2018 (shortly


after J2’s massive allocation to OCV was signed), J2’s CFO, Scott Turicchi, stated that OCV would raise a further


$100m+ dollars from other investors – predominantly on the back of Ressler being a “savvy investor”. [Pg. 20

O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=14b5f97a-b920-ada8-0173-517008e7bb95&iid=4154619)]


That interest never seemed to materialize however. Per OCV’s 2020 ADV �ling with the SEC


(https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/291680/PDF/291680.pdf), it manages around $240 million, meaning


that J2’s commitment likely will make up almost 85% of the �rm’s gross assets.

J2 Chairman’s Questionable Investing Record: Key Role at a Public
Biotech Company That Saw 14 Million Euro Disappear Through an Entity
Based out of the Same J2 Employee Residence in The Netherlands.


Its Stock is Now Down ~99%.


Richard Ressler’s “savvy” investment experience includes controlling publicly traded biotech company, Presbia, a


medical device company focused on a product meant for aging-related farsightedness. The company, whose board


was stacked with J2 insiders, is down ~99% since going public in 2015 (https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/presbia-


prices-ipo-10-below-range-2015-01-29), amidst a series of questionable dealings.


Presbia’s board was stacked with J2 insiders:


Richard Ressler, J2 Chairman


Robert Cresci, J2 Director


Zohar Loshitzer, J2 EVP of Corporate Strategy and former Chief Information O�cer



https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/presbia-prices-ipo-10-below-range-2015-01-29
Mark Yung, recent managing principal of related OCV


(Source: Presbia website (https://presbia.com/presbia-team/#direct), accessed on 5/4/2020 – since then, Yung, Farrell,


Au�arth and Cresci have been taken o� (https://presbia.com/presbia-team/#directors) the site)


Shortly after its IPO, on June 9, 2015, Presbia dismissed its big-4 auditor, Deloitte “e�ective immediately


(https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-15-218032/)” in favor of lesser known Square, Milner, Peterson, Miranda &


Williamson, LLP.


This move appears to have foreshadowed what was to come. Recall from the earlier section that we identi�ed an


apparent undisclosed related party transaction whereby J2 acquired an entity based out of the personal residence of


its employee, Jeroen Van Der Weijden, in the Netherlands. Here is the address:


We discovered that Presbia also had an entity based out of the exact same residential address:

compressed.pdf), accessed from Presbia’s website 5/4/2020)


The entity run out of Jeroen’s house seemed to be focused on selling and marketing [Pg. 71


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000156459018007285/lens-10k_20171231.htm)]. It managed to


rack up ~14 million Euro in losses despite minimal assets and seemingly minimal operations, per Dutch corporate


�lings (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/e5jl4Po5UkQhkz):


(Source: Presbia Netherlands annual statements 2018 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/e5jl4Po5UkQhkz))


The entity was apparently sold to Presbia in part from Orchard Capital, an investment vehicle run by Richard Ressler,


per the Dutch corporate records (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/uExJce2LHemNn4). Once again, we view this as a


major red �ag and a clear pattern of behavior:

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/e5jl4Po5UkQhkz

https://www.slideshare.net/secret/uExJce2LHemNn4
The entity didn’t seem to be critical to Presbia’s operations—it was eventually placed under liquidation “in an e�ort to


simplify the Company’s organizational structure.” [Pg. 26


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000156459019011513/lens-10k_20181231.htm)]


The loss Presbia drummed up, apparently from Jeroen’s 400 sq ft apartment, is alarming to say the least. Around this


time, J2 also acquired VDW from Jeroen, as we noted earlier in our report.


We wonder—why were multiple businesses established at a key J2 employee’s apartment involved in deals overseen


by J2 Chairman Richard Ressler?


By 2019, after burning through its resources, Presbia was delisted


(https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Presbia+%28LENS%29+will+be+delisted+from+Nasdaq+and+tradin


g+of+its+ordinary+shares+will+be+suspended+at+opening+of+business+on+April+25/15392571.html) from the

by its eventual VP of Corporate Development, Jeroen Van der Weijden (for context, this ~$1-2m was 1-2% of the then


JCOM revenue). Per J2’s �lings, Jump was described as a provider of fax-to-email and uni�ed messaging services,


which �ts with J2’s primary focus at the time.


Per Dutch corporate records (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/NaKy9qVraEl2Uw), Jump was later reorganized as J2


Global Netherlands, and was based at the exact same residential apartment that later J2 acquisition VdW was


registered (along with the subsidiary of Presbia mentioned earlier):


We reiterate: Why did J2 and its related individuals acquire multiple entities run by the same individual based out of


the same residence?


Inside OCV’s Portfolio: An Estimated �12 Million Investment in a Niche
Home Movie Business Formed By Ressler’s Nephew (That Now Appears to
be Dormant)


So what investments are J2 paying OCV to manage? One example is Red Carpet Home Cinema


(https://www.redcarpethomecinema.com/how-it-works), a niche business formed by Ressler’s nephew that allows the


ultra-wealthy to screen movies in their homes for a $10,000 set up fee and $1,500 per movie.


Per his LinkedIn, Richard Ressler’s nephew (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-black-507702101/), working for OCV as


a Principal, became CFO of Red Carpet just as J2 got its �rst capital calls from OCV. [Pg. 45

the entity itself, according to California registration documents

half the board (https://www.redcarpethomecinema.com/about) at the �rm.


Red Carpet seems to also be a rather odd �t. The entity was a brand new startup with no revenue[4], which violates

We attempted to visit the o�ce pre-COVID during working hours but the door was locked and no one appeared to be


there.


Similar types (https://observer.com/2019/04/streaming-vs-movies-box-o�ce-screening-room/) of businesses had


already tried and failed, including one that included (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ticketmaster-


executive-joins-prima-cinema-601933) the CEO of Red Carpet as a director.


Red Carpet appears to be on a similar trajectory. A former employee told us that the �lm units are “sitting in a


warehouse right now” and that due to COVID-19 they had to “rev everything down because the world changed”. Per


the former employee:


“Once theaters close, studios don’t release �lms, and if they don’t release �lms the product I was


working on doesn’t exist. Well it does, but it just doesn’t have any o�erings.”

Inside OCV’s Portfolio: Part Overlap with J2’s Own Investment Approach
and Part Biotech (Which OCV Principals Have a Disastrous Track-Record
With)


We can’t help but wonder if J2 will end up paying for OCV’s tech portfolio down the line, further directing incentive


fees and other bene�ts to its insiders for performing the work they were supposed to already be doing on behalf of


J2’s shareholders. Thus far, OCV’s portfolio (http://ocvpartners.com/portfolio/) consists of:


Four companies that have overlap with J2’s investment mandate. (Techstyle


(http://www.techstylefashiongroup.com/), Invoice2Go (http://invoice.2go.com/), Social Native


(https://www.socialnative.com/), and SafeBreach (https://safebreach.com/)). Our concern here is that OCV is just


buying these companies with a view toward �ipping them to J2 later at a premium, which would allow insiders


to pocket performance fees and principal gains. Examples:


Invoice2go (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invoice2go-raises-10-million-attracting-new-and-


existing-investors-and-hemi-zucker-from-ocv-partners-to-join-the-board-of-directors-300710137.html) sells


invoicing solutions to small businesses via subscriptions. J2 has multiple small business subscription


(https://www.j2global.com/brands/communications) and technology services


(https://www.j2global.com/brands/technology).


Social Native (http://www.ocvpartners.com/2019/07/17/social-native/), a marketing tech company o�ering


branding and content solutions. J2 has an entire section of its website devoted to marketing tech


(https://www.j2global.com/brands/martech/).


Six companies that are healthcare/biotech related, which OCV principals have a disastrous track record


in (over 95% historical losses). (Finch, Ossio, Precision Biosciences, Praxis, 1200 Pharma, ByHeart.) OCV’s


principals have little experience in this sector, with the exception of driving one biotech company, Presbia, into


the ground, as we will show. Another, Precision Biosciences, is already public and down ~50% since its IPO last


year (https://precisionbiosciences.com/precision-biosciences-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-o�ering/).


Two companies that are niche businesses. Figure 8 (http://ocvpartners.com/2019/08/26/�gure8/) runs the


Museum of Ice Cream (https://www.museumo�cecream.com/) and Red Carpet Home Cinema


(http://ocvpartners.com/2019/03/05/red-carpet/) aims to cater to the ultra-high-wealthy with an in-home movie


screening business.


Part II: Tricky Accounting: J2’s Public Entity Has Never
Recognized Any Goodwill Impairments


J2 has impairment reviews on a yearly basis, yet we see no impairments to goodwill or intangibles on its acquisitions


for the last decade. [pg.72 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?

He also described the challenge of keeping track of performance in a roll-up with hundreds of acquisitions:


“All these tuck in acquisitions, they kinda just get shoved in to the broader J2 umbrella, within the business


unit, within the division – and they don’t really get tracked anymore. It’s impossible to track the revenue


that derives from ‘Acquisition Y’ versus what was there before. And the costs of course get blended together.


It’s really hard to track some of these tuck-in M&A.”


We reviewed international �lings for J2’s acquisitions to get a picture of how individual acquisitions are actually


performing. This included �lings from Sweden, Ireland, Britain and Denmark.


Our review uncovered multiple examples of goodwill write-downs and impairments at subsidiary levels that are


simply not carried up to the parent company �nancials. Post-publication, the company stated


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630006133/en/J2-Global-Responds-False-Claims-Distortions-Short-


Seller) the lack of reported parent impairments is because “J2 assesses the fair value of goodwill at one level below


the segment level which is the business-unit level.”


Furthermore, we found clear signs of a warranted impairment at J2’s largest acquisition, Everyday Health.


J2’s Largest Acquisition, Everyday Health, Was Acquired in 2016 for �493
Million. It Saw an Immediate Annual Revenue Decline of ~25%.


J2 Has Yet to Record An Impairment. Instead, Everyday’s Financials Have
Been Obfuscated Through A Series of Acquisitions And Divestitures


In December 2016, J2 acquired Everyday Health for $493.7 million, its largest-ever acquisition. [Pg. 75


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404818000001/jcom2017123110-k.htm)]


At the time, Everyday Health was a portfolio of health-focused online properties that included consumer and


professional oriented brands such as Mayo Clinic Diet (https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/mayo-clinic-


diet.aspx), MedPage Today (https://www.medpagetoday.com/), and What to Expect (https://www.whattoexpect.com).

shows consistent rising revenue at Everyday Health Group, suggesting that the acquisition has been a raging success:

The public �nancials of Everyday Health show that LTM revenue up until September 2016 (months before the


acquisition) was $254 million [Pg. 2

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1358483/000157104916012926/t1600124_10k.htm)]. The 2017 numbers


declined precipitously (to $171 million), but rather than recognizing the underperformance and taking a goodwill


impairment, J2 went on a spree of divestitures and acquisitions in the division that e�ectively obfuscated the


reported metrics.


The company explained the 2017 dip by calling it a period of “shrink to grow” where it was divesting assets.


But even after factoring the 2 divestitures from that year, year over year revenue in the division declined by an


estimated $65 million, or 25%.[5]

Revenue in the Everyday Health division still has not reached its pre-acquisition levels despite the 5 subsequent


acquisitions folded into the subsidiary.


Such a steep revenue decline seems to clearly warrant a goodwill impairment, yet the company has taken none to


date.


Once again, this is J2’s largest acquisition and shows clear signs of impairment. Rather than addressing it, a slew of


new M&A deals have simply papered over the issue.


Tricky Accounting: A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of J2 Reported €36
Million (~�50 Million USD) in Impairments, Yet the Parent Reported
None. (This Shouldn’t Be Possible)


For example, subsidiary J2 Global Holdings is the 100% owner of entity J2 Global Ireland. [Pg. 25


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/xtifbz6CaIMNhl)] The parent shows zero impairments in 2015, but the latter—a


wholly owned subsidiary—shows €22 million in impairments in the exact same year. This shouldn’t be possible. Post-


publication, the company stated (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630006133/en/J2-Global-


Responds-False-Claims-Distortions-Short-Seller) that this occurs because “J2 assesses the fair value of goodwill at one


level below the segment level which is the business-unit level.” The end result is that the reported parent �nancials


don’t report goodwill impairments.


Here is the parent showing no impairments:

is the wholly owned subsidiary of the entity that didn’t [Pg. 59

Cumulatively, we found 36 million Euro (~US$50 million) of impairments at the subsidiary level that did not seem to


make it to J2 Ireland’s parent. J2 Ireland’s parent shows no impairments (or diminution) to its investments as of our


latest data for the year ended 2018 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ji3xixGxcTn22i). Inclusive of vdW, we have


identi�ed four dissolutions of acquired entities at the subsidiary level.

Filings across multiple European subsidiaries shows several acquisitions have had signi�cant revenue declines. These


European acquisitions and entities look to have been supervised by Jeroen – the key man in a series of suspicious


transactions described earlier.


All told, it seems that multiple J2 European assets are deteriorating, yet we have seen no goodwill impairments


recorded at the parent level.

Bottom Line: The Market Has Been Enamored with J2’s Acquisition
Spree, Yet It Has Been a Grand Waste of Time and Energy—83% of Last
Quarter’s Operating Income Was Still its Legacy Fax and Email
Marketing Business (and 64% on an LTM Basis)


The sell-side has consistently praised J2’s acquisition machine as a key driver of the business, awarding it growth


multiples based on its ability to acquire and integrate new businesses:


Yet J2’s boring (and declining) legacy businesses remains the real driver of its results. While the e-fax and email


marketing segment accounted for only 26% of revenue over the last twelve months (LTM), it accounted for over 64%


of LTM operating income. Last quarter it accounted for 83% of operating income despite the time, money and e�ort


invested into M&A. [Pg. 41 (https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404820000026/jcom-

Part III: A Corporate Governance Vacuum


Insider Enrichment: J2’s Newly Appointed CEO Was Paid An Astounding
�45 Million In His First Year As CEO; More Than the CEOs of J.P. Morgan
and Microso�


J2’s CEO, Vivek Shah, is relatively young and had limited executive experience


(https://www.j2global.com/about/leadership/vivek-shah/) when starting his role as CEO of J2. He had served only as


CEO of J2 acquisition Zi� Davis for two years and, prior to that, in various management positions at Time Inc. 


Despite this relative lack of experience, Shah made an astounding $45 million in his �rst year as CEO.


(Source: JCOM 2019 Proxy Statement (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/107261319000140?cik=1084048), pg. 38)


Shah strikes us as both articulate and intelligent, yet we �nd no justi�cation for that compensation, stock-based or


otherwise, which puts Shah among the highest paid CEOs in the world. For comparison, J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon,


who oversaw (https://�nance.yahoo.com/quote/JPM/key-statistics?p=JPM) a $258 billion bank with $877 billion in


assets, made (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jp-morgan-dimon-compensation-idUSKCN1PB2R0) $31 million in


total compensation in 2018. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was running a $1.17 trillion company, made


(https://www.salary.com/tools/executive-compensation-calculator/satya-nadella-salary-bonus-stock-options-for-


microsoft-corp?year=2018) $28.5 million in total compensation the same year.


We think J2 has a looming problem with its historical acquisition portfolio, which makes us wonder whether Shah is


being compensated for taking on hidden risks. We also wonder whether his generous compensation was related in


any way to the generous commitment of hundreds of millions to the J2 Chairman’s/former CEO’s own investment


vehicle, which took place within days of Shah’s assumption of the CEO role.


Corporate Governance: We Think J2’s Auditor/Audit Committee Is
Missing In Action.

We believe that given the magnitude of the related party transactions, impairments that don’t show up in the parent


level’s goodwill and aggressive accounting �agged by other critics, it’s obvious that the company’s auditor, BDO, and


J2’s audit committee are either willfully ignorant or simply asleep at the wheel.


Unlike many similarly sized publicly traded companies, J2 does not use a big 4 accountant.


In 2015, J2 upgraded from auditor SingerLewak LLP to BDO (pg. 50


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404815000003/jcom2014123110-k.htm), pg. 49


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404815000003/jcom2014123110-k.htm)), having earlier


downgraded to SingerLewak in 2007 from the well-known Deloitte & Touche (2007 auditor


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000107261307000654/exh-23_14988.htm), 2008 auditor)


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000107261308000558/exh23-1_15746.htm).


Beyond the con�icting board and executive associations described earlier, there has been signi�cant employee


turnover in J2’s �nance and accounting departments. We reviewed company disclosures and employee LinkedIn


pro�les and found a pattern of relatively short tenures and a large number of key departures.

Underneath all of the acquisitions and supportive accounting, J2’s legacy businesses simply look to be fading. Key


metrics from both of the company’s major segments show declines and the quality of each segment appears to be


deteriorating.


Cloud Services Segment Cancel Rate Is Rising While Average Revenue Per
User Falls


For example, while subscriber revenue continues to rise in the company’s cloud services segment as a result of


continued acquisitions, the company’s average monthly revenue per Cloud Business Customer (ARPU) has fallen


while, at the same time, the company’s Cancel Rate has ticked upward.


(Source: J2 Annual Reports, Hindenburg Chart)


The key to the Cloud Services is the company’s faxing software, which comprises 23% of total company revenue.


[Pg.14 (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/108404820000012?cik=1084048)] Faxing continues to be in secular decline as


technology evolves and other internet-based solutions become more ubiquitous.


J2’s key patent (https://patents.google.com/patent/US6208638) that once gave it a moat in the fax-to-message space


expired in 2017, allowing competition to chew away at its user base. Well-known players in the cloud computing


industry, like DropBox which acquired (https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-acquires-hellosign-for-230-


million/) HelloFax in 2019 (now HelloSign), are threatening J2’s historical cash cow. Ironically, J2’s own subsidiary


PCMag, ranked (https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-online-fax-services) its own faxing service (eFax) as just the


fourth best service in its “Best Online Fax Services for 2020”, behind HelloFax.


J2’s Digital Media Assets Were Already Declining Pre-COVID.


Now the Pandemic Has Depressed Revenue Across the Sector.

BuzzFeed has called (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/coronavirus-news-industry-layo�s) the


coronavirus a “Media Extinction Event”, noting that there has been a “free fall” in advertising revenue, despite the fact


that online tra�c for many publishers has risen.


J2 notes that the “majority of [its] revenue within the Digital Media business is derived from short-term advertising


arrangements and a reduction in spending by or loss of current or potential advertisers would cause our revenue and


operating results to decline.” [pg.12 (https://www.bamsec.com/�ling/108404820000012?cik=1084048)]


Yet even prior to COVID-19, J2’s brands seemed to largely be underperforming. Tra�c growth has been a di�cult to


measure metric for J2’s digital media segment, since tra�c is inclusive of acquired assets. But despite J2’s acquisitions


of BabyCenter, Castle Conolly Top Doctors and Spiceworks in 2019, the company recently posted declining annual


tra�c numbers for the �rst time in years.


(Source: J2 Annual Reports, Hindenburg Chart)


JCOM’s website (https://www.j2global.com/brands/technology/) is quick to tout ownership of its marquee names, like


IGN, Mashable and Humble Bundle. But reviews of J2’s digital media portfolio up until April 2020 show that the Alexa


rankings for its featured digital assets have mostly plunged over the last 3 years.


Per our call with a J2 investor relations rep, he emphasized that tra�c does not always translate to revenue, and


revenue does not always translate to EBITDA. While this is true, tra�c and revenue certainly help.


9 of the 14 website-driven names appeared to be in major downtrends, even through the COVID-19 pandemic,


while three sites appeared around the same and two sites have increased their rankings.


For example, here is IGN’s Alexa ranking over the last 3 years:



https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/coronavirus-news-industry-layoffs

https://www.bamsec.com/filing/108404820000012?cik=1084048

https://www.j2global.com/brands/technology/
And HumbleBundle.com showing a similar decline:


Mashable’s Alexa ranking has also plunged over the last 3 years:


AskMen.com also appears to be in steep decline:
As is ExtremeTech.com:


And Geek.com:


Babycenter shows a similar trend:
O�ers.com has also seen its Alexa rank fall:


Spiceworks.com is clearly in a downtrend:


 EverydayHealth.com, J2’s largest acquisition, appears to be close to where it was 3 years ago:
BlackFriday.com, a seasonal business, is o� its highs but slightly above where it was years ago:


PCMag.com is slightly higher than it was three years ago:


And Speedtest.net and WhatToExpect.com appeared to be the two brands that were able to buck the trend:
Overall, J2’s digital media assets already appeared to be struggling pre COVID-19. Without M&A to plug up the holes


and obfuscate the declines, we expect the numbers to worsen materially. J2 pulled its guidance last quarter given the


uncertainty.


Conclusion: We View J2 Global’s Equity As Uninvestable


While J2’s legacy business troubles and aggressive accounting have been addressed by other critics in the past, we


believe the revelation of the major red �ags we are bringing to the table today, combined with an unprecedented and


existential macroeconomic threat to its legacy business, may �nally put J2 in a position that could (and we think


should) lead to:


1. An external investigation into J2 acquisitions practices (in particular to those during Jeroen van der Weijden’s


tenure) and the CEO’s compensation (including the decision making process that went into it).


2. A review by the company’s auditors into the company’s acquisition history and aggressive accounting – and


speci�cally goodwill and impairment testing.


3. A much-needed board shake up.


4. A repricing of the company’s stock to account for these risks, incrementally commensurate to the �nancial risks


at a company with over 3x turns of leverage (as well as cancelled dividend) and looming impairment questions.


5. Vastly more detailed disclosures about key metrics and bene�ciaries of historical acquisitions and future


acquisitions.

Presbia Failure


A formerly publicly traded biotech company that was recapitalized by Cresci and later �led for


delisting and registration termination in 2019. The last quote (https://www.google.com/search?

The accountant (http://webpro�le.info/mslavin/index.html) at OCC (and CFO of its various entities at one time) lists


amongst his skills the following “discovered legal method for company owners to withdraw funds from business while

As was Presbio LLC


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000119312514367362/d623106dex1011.htm), related to


Presbia.


OCV’s o�ce (http://ocvpartners.com/contact/) is same as CIM Group’s o�ce


(https://www.cimgroup.com/about/o�ces) (another Ressler entity with a publicly traded vehicle


(https://www.cimcommercial.com/).)


Pieter Pauwstraat was 400 square feet and housed VDW Consulting (bought by J2), VDW Hold Co. (which spun


o� VDW Consulting), Presbia (a public company that lost 99%, who’s subsidiary was managed by Jeroen), and J2


Netherlands (Jeroen’s �rst business sale to J2 Global).


Appendix C: A Close Associate of Ressler Worthy of Mention


We thought it was worth mentioning Zohar Loshitzer, J2 Global Executive Vice President of Strategy for over 15 years.


Zohar has seemingly been Richard Ressler’s right-hand man for nearly thirty years and overlaps with him at no fewer


than nine separate entities. His associations with Ressler include J2 Global, Presbia, OCC, and now OCV. Their


relationship goes back as far as 1995 with the formation of OCC and Orchard Telecom – one of the telecom entities


formed by Zohar that became part of Presbia. Others included Imali and MTP Consulting that drew signi�cant fees


from public entities on behalf of Zohar. These fees help to round out what we view as a long-running insider


enrichment process that we estimate totals well over $100 million.


Appendix D: Estimated Impairment Components


Impairment Components


Everyday Health Acquisition $70 million


European Acquisitions $50 million


VDW Acquisition $900 thousand


Red Carpet Home Cinema (OCV Investment) $10 million


Precision Biosciences (OCV Investment) $5 million


Total $155 million



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1591096/000119312514367362/d623106dex1011.htm

http://ocvpartners.com/contact/

https://www.cimgroup.com/about/offices

https://www.cimcommercial.com/
We estimated based on the following factors:


Everyday Health was a $493 million transaction that saw its revenue decline ~25% in one year. A correlation of


acquisition value to revenue suggests an impairment of $123 million. We added back $30 million due to gains


on sale of 2 subsidiaries of Everyday [Pg. 14,


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404817000012/jcom2017093010-q.htm) Pg. 79


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404818000001/jcom2017123110-k.htm)] and haircut


our own estimates by 25% in the interest of being conservative.


We estimated VDW based on footnote 2 and have since updated the number based on the newly reported


�gure per the company’s response (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200630006133/en/J2-Global-


Responds-False-Claims-Distortions-Short-Seller).


We discounted the estimated $12 million Red Carpet investment based on J2’s proportional ownership of the LP


equity in OCV.


We estimated the small size of the OCV investment in Precision.

contacted the co-founder of Salesify that had been acquired in that quarter, who described the sale as being for a


“near 9 �gure exit”. We estimated this at $90 million total, and $73 million net of $17 million in earnout compensation


[Pg. 81 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404818000001/jcom2017123110-k.htm)]. The


other acquisition that quarter which was suggested as being on the larger side per J2’s quarterly conference call was


LiveVault, which had originally sold for $50 million (https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-


tech/2005/11/iron-mountain-locks-up-all-of-livevault.html) to Iron Mountain and then was later sold to J2. We


contacted investor relations at Iron Mountain and asked for the sale price to J2 but they refused to disclose it. We


assume given the quiet nature of the deal that it was a loss, and estimated $30 million. This left $88 million left for the


quarter across the 7 deals, roughly $13 million each. Our review of several deals suggested a minimal revenue/likely


acquisition price, which ultimately left us with an estimate of ~$20 million for VDW.


[3] We also spoke to an investor relations representative that seemed to think the acquisition was related to Ookla:


“that was an Ookla IP acquisition. We wanted to keep that technology for ourselves…(it was) software that we were


utilizing and we wanted to keep it in house. So we paid to keep it in house.” The explanation didn’t make a lot of


sense to us (why would a U.S. company like Ookla be using software developed out of Jeroen’s apartment?) and we


�gured he may have simply been mistaken but we wanted to include it in the interest of not leaving something out


that could be relevant.


[4] OCV set up a separate investment vehicle (https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/6451633) called “OCV


Red Carpet 1” on June 20 , 2017, the same day Red Carpet was originally formed in Delaware, indicating its support


for the business since inception.


[5] We arrive at a total revenue adjustment of $18 million as a result of the net divestitures. To arrive at this, see the


press release (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171012005480/en/j2-Global-Completes-Acquisitions-Q3-


2017-Announces) announcing 3 divestitures, 2 of which are Everyday Health related. The company discloses a $23


million revenue decline for 2017 for all three. We add back ~$3 million for the unrelated acquisition (Web24) given its


lack (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140922005050/en/j2-Global-Acquires-Web24-Group-Pty-Ltd.) of


reported revenue, suggesting its modest size [Pg.79


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084048/000108404818000001/jcom2017123110-k.htm)]. We also add


back $2.2 million for 1 month of eHealthCareers (which was acquired in December) per its run-rate prior to J2’s


acquisition [Pg. 18 (https://s2.q4cdn.com/537623210/�les/doc_�nancials/quarterly/2018/q2/dhi-
