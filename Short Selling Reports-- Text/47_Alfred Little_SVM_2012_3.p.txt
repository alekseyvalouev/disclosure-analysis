Silvercorp Reluctantly Discloses Significantly Lower Resources And
Grades For Key SGX Mine
Aug. 24, 2012 5:38 PM ET46 comments
by: Alfred Little


In today's report, I dig beneath the headlines to point out the recent reversal of fortune of
Silvercorp Metals' (NYSE:SVM) key SGX mine that accounted for 74% of SVM's total
production the last three years. SVM has done its best to mask the abrupt decline in the
SGX mine from investors. Nevertheless, it is now clear that the SGX mine has much lower
silver resource estimates than SVM previously disclosed and much lower grades of ore
recently produced.


1. AMC Mining Consultants 2012 Ying District Technical Report Discloses Much
Lower Silver Resources for the SGX Mine


Last year, I suggested SVM should upgrade its independent Qualified Persons (doing
business as "BK Exploration Associates") on the SGX mine to a major multinational
geological consulting firm with offices and staff in China. On 12/29/11, SVM responded by
engaging AMC Mining Consultants ("AMC") of 200 Granville Street, Suite 1330, in
Vancouver, Canada, to prepare updated technical reports on SVM's Ying District (including
SGX) and BYP mines (press release here). Like "BK Exploration Associates," AMC
disclosed that it heavily relied upon translations of key Chinese documents prepared by
SVM. AMC's principal geologist, Brian O'Connor, actually visited the Ying district mines in
February and April 2012.


On 6/5/12, SVM announced (here) highlights of the much-anticipated AMC technical
report with the promotional headline:


"Silvercorp Reports Significant Gain in Measured and Indicated Mineral
Resources and Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Ying Silver-Lead-
Zinc Mining District, Henan Province, China"


The "significant gain" touted in the headline referred to the 28% (21 million ounce)
increase in the combined Measured and Indicated mineral resources of the SGX, HZG,
HPG, and TLP/LM mines in the Ying district. As I show below, SVM's press release in
my opinion is highly misleading because it masks a dramatic 79% (60 million

ounce) decline in the Inferred silver resource, 46% (55 million ounce) decline in total
silver resource, and 59% decline in the silver grade of the Inferred resource at the
SGX mine.


The following tables compare the SGX silver equivalent resource estimates and metal
price assumptions as of 12/31/11 in AMC's technical report dated 6/13/12 (page iii) to the
SGX silver equivalent resource estimated as of 12/31/10 in BK's technical report dated
5/20/11 (page 7):


The large declines in silver resources shown in the tables above occurred despite
changes in the 2012 measurement criteria, last year's massive exploration program, and
significant higher metals price assumptions. These three factors should have significantly
boosted estimates, as follows:


1. SVM now uses a minimum silver cut off grade of 150g/t instead of 300 g/t, allowing it
to count far more resources in its calculations.


2. SVM used significantly higher metal price assumptions for silver equivalent
calculations allowing for more marginal resources to be counted


3. SVM completed its largest underground drilling exploration program on the SGX mine
to date, adding 61,066 meters to the 174,836 meters previously drilled as well as
11,186 meters of new tunnels


Ceteris paribus, these three positive factors should have resulted in a much higher silver
resource estimate. Why did the exact opposite actually happen? Why did SVM not
publicize this huge 60 million ounce decline in Inferred SGX silver resources?


Buried in its 6/5/12 press release, SVM attributes the decline in Inferred resources to:


"…conversion of Inferred Resources to Measured and Indicated categories by
extensive tunneling and drilling in 2011, and to a change in the grade interpolation
approach in 2012."
5/18/2018 Silvercorp Reluctantly Discloses Significantly Lower Resources And Grades For Key SGX Mine - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (NYSE:SVM) | S…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/827521-silvercorp-reluctantly-discloses-significantly-lower-resources-and-grades-for-key-sgx-mine 3/20


SVM's explanation is misleading. Measured and Indicated silver resources increased by a
combined 4.9 million ounces, plus SVM purportedly produced around another 4 million
ounces, but these amounts do not come close to explaining the 60 million ounce decline in
the Inferred silver resource.


Therefore, the vast majority of the decline must be attributable to AMC taking a
more conservative approach than BK resulting in a much lower Inferred silver
resource estimate for the SGX mine. Looking back at my warnings last year that the
SGX resource estimates were likely too good to be true, the following table clearly
shows that I was right:


Are AMC's findings surprising? Not to anyone who seriously looked at SGX
resource data available from the local Chinese Land & Resources Bureau.


The biggest "red flag" that the SGX mine appears to have less resources than SVM
previously claimed was published on the Luoning County Land & Resource Bureau
("LRB") website on 11/30/09 listing the resources of the TLP, HPG and SGX mines in the
Ying district (a translated copy of the LRB web page can be found here).


The table below summarizes the LRB published silver, lead and gold resources  of the
TLP, HPG and SGX mines and compares them to the total resources disclosed in the
January 2010 Mineral Resources Estimates provided on page 10 of the 2/26/10 NI43-101
technical report on the Ying District mines:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/827521-silvercorp-reluctantly-discloses-significantly-lower-resources-and-grades-for-key-sgx-mine 4/20


For the TLP and HPG mines, the relative variance is reasonably small (in the range of
+69% to -42%). For the SGX mine, however, the NI43-101 resource estimate is over
900%, or ten times, higher than the LRB published resource estimate!


Why is the Chinese resource estimate for the SGX mine so much further at variance
relative to the other mines? I first pointed this out in my reports last year. SVM has
never, to date, offered any explanation for the widely different variances.


Mysteriously, after the publication of my reports last year, the LRB removed this
data from its website (invalid old link here), probably at the request of SVM. To date,
the LRB has not published a revised version of these resource estimates on its
website.


2. SVM Tried to Conceal that is SGX Grades are 32% Lower than Last Year


In its 2013 Q1 earnings press release (link here), SVM tried to avoid disclosing a dramatic
decline in the silver head grade of SGX ore by combining the results of the several Ying
mines together as a "district." For the entire district, the silver grade declined 16.2% from
271 g/t to 227 g/t.


However, in response to an analyst inquiry on the conference call, SVM Chairman Rui
Feng was forced to admit that the SGX silver head grade fell from 444 g/t a year ago
to "around 295 or 300" g/t, a decline of over 32% and double the decline of the
district.


Feng then said the grade would probably be the same for Q2 2013, thus admitting that
there would be two quarters of dramatically lower ore grades from the SGX mine, as
shown in the following chart:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/827521-silvercorp-reluctantly-discloses-significantly-lower-resources-and-grades-for-key-sgx-mine 5/20


In its press release announcing its Q1 2013 results (link here), SVM provided the following
ludicrous excuse which blamed short sellers for the sharply lower production
grades:


"The "Short and Distort" attack last fall has caused Managements' time being
inadvertently, but necessarily diverted to deal with the crisis, which caused delays
implementing certain development plans at the SGX mine, resulting in a gap in the
mining schedule of blending ore from different zones with different grades."


The big decline in the SGX silver grade to 295-300g/t in the quarter ended 6/30/12 was a
huge surprise to investors who on the 5/18/12 earnings conference call (highlighted
transcript here) in which Rui Feng reiterated 2013 guidance (link here) of 460 g/t. Once
again, I question SVM's unwillingness to disclose negative material information.


Furthermore, on 8/1/12, the day before SVM reported horrible Q1 2013 results and many
weeks after SVM management became aware of the sharp declines in the SGX silver
grade and Inferred resource estimate, SVM announced positive drilling exploration results
for the SGX mine (link here).


I view the 8/1/12 positive announcement as a highly promotional attempt to support
SVM's stock price that was teetering at the $5 level ahead of the terrible Q1 2013
results SVM reported the next day.


Conclusion


- Rui Feng comment to shareholders at SVM's annual meeting in Vancouver on 9/23/11, according to The Globe & Mail

Comments (46)


In September 2011, I warned that Chinese government mining reports from 2005 to 2010
appeared to show much lower grades and resources for Silvercorp Metals' key SGX mine,
compared to SVM's 2004-2011 technical reports. As I have shown in this report, SVM's
recent disclosures prove that I was completely justified in my concerns about the SGX
mine last year.


I challenge SVM management in the future to:


1. Be honest with investors and admit that the SGX mine is no longer as great as
previously touted.


2. Provide transparency by continuing to break out the SGX mine production and grades
as long as it remains SVM's key producing property.


3. Strictly follow its own Corporate Disclosure Policy (highlighted here) and stop
concealing and delaying disclosure of bad news.


If SVM management refuses to change course, the stock will continue to attract short
sellers who will continue to publicly point out SVM's many red flags. SVM, like its fellow
litigants Deer Consumer Products (NASDAQ: DEER - Halted) and Sino Clean Energy
(NASDAQ: SCEI - Delisting), deserves greater scrutiny.


Over the course of the last year SVM's Chairman Rui Feng has offered plenty of fire and
brimstone in the media against his critics, wasted $4 million on a lawsuit that is now
dismissed, and conducted an all-out personal war against me in China. Recent SVM
disclosures prove Rui Feng's actions are wrong.


Disclosure: I am short SVM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Question 1: 
700+ g/t in the article is it silver equivalent or did you compare the wrong numbers


also q2: 
ps why should we even bother with your article when we already know this from the management own statements
and you are just replaying it again eh?


we can see that from production reports that it can vary foolish.


they said it themselves foolish alfredlittle.


q3: 
also do you even know what inferred means? 
please do tell us what inferred means


shall I repeat this again last year education tutorial you failed even in reading?


inferred = low chance of having said silver deposits and not guaranteed. foolish Jon Carnes.


praying that others dont know anything about mining or something?


you fool as well your own report is 30g/t -5g/t -275g/t remember


that was when you picked up the rocks randomly going to the milling sites.


ps for the 275 g/t sample you probably owe SVM thousands of dollars in value of ore. you essentially stole the ore. so
thus should be arrested already. better return it now maybe you dropped that 275 g/t great ore btw back on the
properties then.


275 is about average actually for many mines.


the 300 g/t big deal we know there are variations hardly fraud that you speak of.


oh ps do you not think svm should hold back the good ore and only smelt the crappy ore? after all


EXK was holding back silver as well.


given price of silver was down during the quarters it would be wise to hold back the good stuff.


you are still acting like an ego maniac btw.


we know who you are jon carnes of eosfunds


you invested in many Chinese companies and btw a lot are probably frauds and lost money. also you likely shorted
them behind your clients backs like goldman sachs. like obviously.


joe ramelli your employee also attacking zagg I heard since 2010. zagg = for apple products. and you even attack
american companies.


you are a bankster through and through pumper and dumper. 
sending spies and pumping up fraud caps then shorting them afterwards goldman sachs style


I dont know why you are still free.


You are basically like Jonathan Lebed I am sure you know who he is cut from the same cloth.

This article is such a load of bs. No new information provided here really, while ignoring all the recent great news from
the company such as this bonanza discovery: http://goo.gl/K9ErI


You are grasping at straws at this point, Jon. With silver on the move, you should just give up and cover your shorts
already. LOL


24 Aug 2012, 06:43 PM


geo8211
lecture again about the 5 categories for lazy Jon Carnes that cannot google it


1.Proven reserves: are those which have an over 90% chance of being present


2. Probable reserves: are those which have a 50% chance of being present


3. measured less than 50 %


4. indicated 25% or less


5. inferred slight chance of it present about 10%


so thus you are a fraud alfred little : jon carnes


you still harp on about grades but dont even know the differences when I am telling you right here right now actually
told you 1 year ago but you fail at educating yourself.


you also fail at knowing what difference is between 700+g/t equivalent resources.


you compared 700g/t equivalent with  
300g/t real resources


you yourself are the one misleading people with your fraud information.


go back to making fraud companies then exposing them thanks. 
accusing legit companies when you have no ties to and accusing them is not working out for you.


did you do what I say and investigate silvertip mines that svm bought from ssri yet?


I guess Silver standard resources is also a fraud then eh? rofl. god. get a clue and man up for once.


well I suppose this is secretly implied you agree svm is legit then if this is all you have thanks for confirming bye.

here is a tiny bit  
secret so to speak that Jon Carnes doesnt want you to know


the exploration of bk was using silver equivalent resources 
700 g/t grade silver in mines average = impossible almost no mines did this.


they used zinc lead copper etc credits to add as silver oz profitability like all miners do ask HL,EXK, AG etc and you
would know anyone in mining knows this.


amc mining: was using real silver resources.  
300-400 g/t is actually regular grade that happens frequently. 
and the real legit amount


foolish ones that actually believed AL Jon Carnes he must think people are sheep well certainly many are geez told
them to research my god.


anyway I hope none of you got fooled by this pump and dumper making fraud caps in his eosfunds then shorting them
first and exposing them right after


also he has been shorting zagg and bashing it with joe ramelli since 2010. ps i dont like zagg either their ceo made a
boneheaded mistake selling a few million stock? .geez.


p.s. to all look closely at the reports and don't be misled


24 Aug 2012, 06:56 PM


geo8211
here is some more info for you guys now that i have time to do some research and post better get ready Jon Carnes: i
am actually having some fun making fun of his amateurish mining knowledge.


proven + probable is actually reported up rather than down


http://mwne.ws/MRwKXP


http://bit.ly/MRwNmw


compare them both


proven + probable = 41 million in 2011  
vs 
37 million 2010 
with a probability of 50-100%


41 oz x 30 price of silver * (50-100) = 615 million to 1.230 billion


2011 
48 million in 25-50+% oz.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/827521-silvercorp-reluctantly-discloses-significantly-lower-resources-and-grades-for-key-sgx-mine 10/20


vs  
2010 
43 million


48 oz x 30 *(25-50) =360 million to 720 million


these 2 alone would make sgx mines able to produce 
1 billion to 2 billion in revenue for that mine alone.


That is excluding sgx inferred so what does it matter lets look at inferred.


2010 
you siad 75 million oz lets say of inferred at 10%. 
vs  
2011 
15 million


15 million *30* 10% = at most 45 million worth or less 
75 million *30* 10% = at most 225 million worth or less


2011 
so 0-45 million


2010 report 
0 dollars to 225 million. 
difference of 0-180 million only like I said.


net net its pretty much even sorry Jon Carnes YOUR MATH is WRONG 
learn geology measurements first.


just a few million oz weighted at 50-100% rather than your  
0-10% probability btw 
inferred are subject to change of course.


i wonder if using less sample made it less likely to hit the good spots eh? could be ahem 150g/t vs 300 g/t but never
the less.


inferred you should multiply them by 10% which means 60 million oz becomes only 6 million oz. at 30 bucks that is a
value weight of 180 million not much at all really.


SO I did all the calculations for the lazy ones


ps i should remind people inferred all go into indicated measured probable and then proven categories over time.


so they went through their inferred resources and pushed them onto the higher probabilities net net this article was all
about NOTHING.


JON CARNES GO TO GEOLOGY SCHOOL PLEASE.

Nice job Alfred. It looks like there are several lemmings here who refuse to remove the blinders. Oh well, their loss.


I sure wish you'd give LPH a look, as the contents of their July 2nd PR should be replicated by EVERY Chinese
company if they wish to become transparent. ALso, LPH has always had virtually no shorts in the stock and has never
been attacked. Their fuel facility acquisition should be announced any day now and that will bring EPS up to $1.00 on
an annual basis. I see LPH not only surviving in the fraud-filled space, but thriving.

didnt you read my calculations your alfred little is wrong face the facts


oh i should mention again to remind you again inferred moves to


proven <--probable <--measured <--indicated<-- inferred


yet you clearly do not understand anything about mining, 
please explain the lecture I have just given you if you understand to prove yourself competent thanks.


by my estimates the inferred to proven probable was almost exactly the amount lost in inferred gg your hero
article reeks of fraud and deception


and we already did research on jon carnes we know who he is. 
if you cannot argue with facts spin spin spin all you do oi vay.


please stop thinking people in the mining space are STUPID.


we do our research more in depth than you think especially since we dont trust this bs market in the first place
you think? nor do we trust you the government nor the management we trust ourselves and common sense

stupid not to he lives there


if you have an argument please refute my claims tyvm. i dare you to refute the claims i made about this article
then not to mention everything JON CARNES said was already made public which he didnt need to

but to your question on lph it certainly is higher chance of fraud than others given low pe and no dividend and
no defense by the management their mannerisms already give them an air of fraud alert.


but never the less jon carnes is quite bitter he cant pin anything on his attempt at accusing legit companies of
frauds.


lph could be one of his old chinese holdings he might have some dirt on them though. lets see if he has any
spies in there too.

Well arn't you the nice guy Jon Carnes, saving all us investors from the evil SVM. A company that pays a dividend
every quarter. A company that employs hundreds, pays huge taxes and has grown from pretty much nothing in 5
years to become a major producer. I see from your latest, that you have backtracked from your infamous : "Is SVM a
1.3 billion fraud" statement from 2011. I guess that court case got you scared, eh? Try that in Canada and you'd
already be paying, back! Oh Yeah, you arn't out of the woods yet 'cause SVM is appealing and I am hearing of an
investor led class action may be in the works.


Now you are using cute graphics, that are visually misleading. You use nice shots at R Feng and you are cherry
picking data while ignoring the fact that P&P reserves have increased year over year.


I appreciate that your defaming attacks are now opinions that is for sure. Anyhow, good luck with your short when GC
gets going and when managment gets the head grades back to where they should be.

Yes the suit was dismissed but it is also under appeal. These guys are hiding behind loose defamation laws in the US.
However, they are not out of the woods yet.

so in case you are still ignoring my posts because you refuse to answer them


here is the lowdown.


proven + probable + measured and indicated = coincidently almost = to the amount of lost in  
inferred


remember inferred = less than 10%.


do the calculations 
coincidentally lowest bound is about 75 million min 
highest is 195 million dollars max.


the loss of inferred calculated at 10% is about loss of 0 min -180 million MAX.


thus net net the average is actually up


If you want to calculate them separately the probabilities are


proven = 75-100 
probable = 50-75 
measured = 25-50 
probable = 10-25 
inferred = 0-10%


this article has only proven one thing you are in fact showing that svm is even more legit than other miners.

"alfred little"...er.....jon carnes talking about inferred..lol


Folks, SVM proven and probable reserves INCREASED 36% from 2011 and 2012....Proven and probable are the real
deal and the numbers educated investors look at..not inferred!


from SVM press release regarding the INCREASE in resrves


"In the 2012 Ying Technical Report, contained metal in combined Proven and Probable Reserves increased by 36%
for silver, 28% for lead and 58% for zinc"

Author’s reply »  Would anyone care to speculate what lowering the cutoff 50% and nearly tripling the Silver

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Why does SVM not provide an apples to apples year over year comparison of resources?
The vastly different assumptions, all else equal, should result in a much bigger resource (measured, indicated
and inferred). Even with the huge boost from changing the assumptions, SGX Inferred fell 79% (60M). SGX
Measured went up 7M. Indicated fell 2M. I find that very very suspicious.


26 Aug 2012, 01:23 PM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
It seems to me they simply used a different method to calculate inferred resources, you said it yourself:


"These decreases are due to the conversion of Inferred Resources to Measured and Indicated categories by
extensive tunneling and drilling in 2011, and to a change in the grade interpolation approach in 2012."


You go on to say:


"SVM used significantly higher metal price assumptions for silver equivalent calculations allowing for more marginal
resources to be counted."


You wanted them to keep using $6.50 for the price of silver, is $19 still not conservative enough for you? Furthermore,
this along with the reduced cut-off grades actually has the effect of bringing down the overall AgEq grade because
you get increased contribution from lower grades of the other metals at a lower ratio than before ($1/$19 = .05 vs.
$0.4/$6.50 = .06 previously)

meaning he reported a lot of us while he left his alone I'm just going to report him in all his articles then and
see what happens to get back at him.


what the heck is he talking about free speech, he is censoring us when we expose him.

Author’s reply »  Sorry, but reading all these comments can anyone simply explain the likely reasons for the 79%
decline in Inferred resources of the SGX mine, rather than making excuses that investors should not be concerned by
the revision?


15 Sep 2012, 10:41 PM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Obviously you didn't read the comments that closely. I know geo's are sometimes rambling but he has the
right idea so I'll try to summarize them:


1. This was a different, more accurate survey of resources using a different method. Therefore, it was able to
ascertain that some of those "inferred" resources were in fact actually there, hence the increase in
"measured" resources.


2. The lowered cutoff grade and increased metal prices does not automatically increase the amount, and
especially the grade, of resources that will be reported. In fact, the lower cutoff grade will obviously lower the
overall silver head grade because of basic math, furthered by counting lower grades of other metals at a
lower ratio to the new higher (but still very conservative) silver price.


3. You have cherry picked the one mine and one category that had a significant decrease in resources (again
though, only in the much less important "inferred" resources).


4. The other projects and resource categories where most future production will actually come from increased
substantially, and I personally would rather have 30% more birds in the hand than 50% more birds in the
bush.


16 Sep 2012, 12:05 AM


Kebor Dello
79% or 179% decline in resources don't change anything for you. 
You are short SVM, and SVM stock price is up considerably. 
That's what counts for you and where you lose your shirt and short.

RE-POST  
AFTER JON CARNES asked seeking alpha to delete:


EVIDENCE that JON CARNES IS IGNORING PRESENTED: 
mistakes INTENTIONALLY made by Jon Carnes:


1. proven and probable left out 
2. only calculated measured + indicated and inferred (refer to #1 mistake) 
3. intentionally forgot inferred ---->is used to transfer resources to ---->measured + indicated and then -----
>proven and probable 
4. forgot to mention inferred counts for 0 min - 10% max weight. 
mid point being 5% thus 60 million oz is about worth  
0-3-6 million oz of silver 
0-90-180 million dollars at 30 dollar silver.


5. result Proven + Probable + measured + indicated gains already overwhelm his calculation of inferred.


JON CARNES ARGUMENT FAIL.


if you keep deleting posts will keep re-posting and make yourself more obviously a fraud.


Also keep asking other news agencies to keep spamming in your favor with no real facts pertaining to your
accusations then while it makes it even more obvious you paid for them or influenced it in a big way. Don't
think people don't realize this.


your gloating(ego maniac) is giving yourself away.

Author’s reply »  Illuminati, regarding 3) of course I picked the SGX mine, because that is the mine I focused
on in my reports last year that strongly suggested that the resources and grades at SGX were overstated.
Now it appears I was correct to be skeptical of the SGX mine.

Ah, yes, the ultra scientific study of rocks that had supposedly fallen off SVM's ore trucks, glad you were able
to draw enough confidence from those statistically insignificant results to place such a huge bet with your

You mentioned the rock and the truck but forgot about the Polaroid camera used in the same operation.


21 Sep 2012, 03:34 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Illuminati, my main point last year was that SVM reports dramatically lower resources and
grades for its core SGX mine to Chinese authorities. I provided 3 Chinese reports evidencing the lower
resources and grades.


One year later, after AMC reviews the SGX figures, SVM changes course and reports to is US/Canadian
investors dramatically lower resources and grades for its SGX mine (which it now groups with the other Ying
district mines in order to try to mask the decline).


A year later, the discrepancy has narrowed. This pattern has been repeated dozens of times by other Chinese
operating companies. It could indicate fraud. Or it could indicate that SVM lied to the Chinese authorities. Not
many companies risk doing that, though, since they could face severe punishment. Lying to foreign investors,
however, has yet to result in a single fine.

In the NI43-101 technical report, where in the world are you seeing that there are supposedly 766K tons of Pb
and 3553 tons Ag?


In proven resources for SGX, I see 80K tons of Pb, very close to the 70K tons reported on the LRB web page,
and Ag is 437 tons, close to the 353 on LRB.


I believe you may be confusing proven and inferred resources again.


24 Sep 2012, 03:52 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The figures on the LRB site represent 331+332+333 under the international standard used
in China (roughly equivalent to measured+indicated+inf) My article clearly cited page 10 of the 2/26/10 NI43-
101 as my source for the resource estimates disclosed by SVM. You will have to convert troy ounces of silver
to metric tonnes to be comparable to the LRB data.


25 Sep 2012, 11:06 AM

and you still fail to address the key issue.


YOU left out PROVEN and PROBABLE intentionally or don't have any other way to justify your claims so you

changing your accusation again and again.


ps the one you cited from the first g/t is equivalent resources meaning it has to calculate the resources taken
by lead zinc copper etc.


the second one is likely REAL silver.


no mine today has ever had an AVERAGE grade of 798 g/t. 
if there were then that would actually make a world record or come close to it.


and again you still fail at clearly ignoring  
inferred ->indicated->mea...


and intentionally IGNORING the most important categories IS A BIG DEAL.


This fact alone means you completely did everything wrong on your reports.


Hence why you need to keep changing your story now to try and protect what ever little reputation you gained
from your AL gig.


and again I will reiterate READ MY CALCULATIONS and respond legitimately if you even want to be credible.


01 Oct 2012, 03:12 PM


Frank Steele
Wow, your whole premise is because inferred resources decreased through reclassification the company is a fraud?


Better write an article on the fraud at First Majestic Silver, as they decreased not just their inferred tonnage, but their
measured and indicated as well. It must be a cover up!


23 Sep 2012, 07:24 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Hi Frank, I never said SVM is a fraud. I simply raised a long list of red flags and
inconsistencies between Chinese and US/Canadian data that could indicate the possibility of fraud. I hoped
SVM management would address my concerns. To date SVM management has very selectively and
inadequately addressed the issues and ignored the most important ones. Furthermore, SVM management did
their best to mask the huge decline in SGX resources and grades, which was my key area of concern last
year. Then there is the Globe & Mail's findings that SVM paid for the Chinese police to stop my research
efforts and arrest my analysts. That is the biggest red flag of all now!

AMC and BK?

Again here's some more info to help AL understand how resource estimation works if he ever wants to actually try to
understand it: scroll down to the last chart in this article:


http://bit.ly/WRNEHU


You'll see that when the company first did a survey in 2010 that estimated proven and probable reserves, it led to a
decrease in measured and indicated reserves, and again in 2012 when they did another test with more drilling,
inferred resources went down since they were converted into M&I, which is exactly what happened with the SGX
mine.
