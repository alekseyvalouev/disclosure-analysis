AMERICAN
SUPERCONDUCTOR
(NASDAQ:AMSC)- ONE
PRODUCT + ONE
CUSTOMER + ONE
COUNTRY = MANY
PROBLEMS


During the past week, many companies associated
with the wind industry in China have shown
weakness.  Citron would like to single out one
company which we believe has a lot more downside
potential….and it seems as if the CEO agrees with
us.


Background


American Superconductor is a classic old-school
“story stock” … a company with an electric
distribution grid innovation – a superconducting
wire, that when supercooled, carries 100 times
more electricity.  The company has touted this
invention for more than a decade as “the next big
thing”…but other than a single demonstration
project, it has never been monetized.


A couple of years ago, AMSC bought a small
German wind turbine design �rm named Windtec,
which had a promising relationship with one of
China’s largest wind turbine manufacturers,
Sinovel.  As Sinovel has solidi�ed its market share in

China, AMSC began to announce huge revenues for
delivering its electricity management componentry
for those units.


In fact, AMSC’s �lings disclose that its Sinovel
revenues represent 67% to 76% of its revenues for
various periods spanning 2008 and 2009.  So
investors had better heed the company’s
relationship to this one customer…if Sinovel gets a
cold, AMSC catches a �u.


This week, Miao Wei, vice minister of Industry and
Information Technology came out and called many
China wind power projects “vanity projects” made
the whole industry sit back and give one collective
headscratch.

What about the numbers?


Oddly enough, even during this enormous boom
time of shipping to one customer, AMSC was never
really able to put up a huge pro�t.  After reporting
huge losses for years, the best they have been able
to put up in 2009 is an 12c qtr, a run rate which
prices the company for a 60 P/E … if they can keep
it up.  Last quarter was so back-end loaded to
Sinovel, that the company had to �eld questions by
analysts about the unexpectedly high receivables
number it reported, to which it replied that it had
already collected.


But Now The Game Has Changed


Two events occurred this month that raise the
uncertainty level for AMSC’s future:


Firstly, Sinovel has �led to go public and we get a
peek into their business.  Without a prospectus yet,
this is what Citron was able to learn.


Sinovel estimated its 2009 production at 2,000 sets
of 1.5 Mw turbines and 100 sets of 3.0 Mw turbines.

That totals appx. 3,300 Mw of production, for which
AMSC has been earning, according to our math,
about $36K pre Mw, or about $118 million for
2009.  However, its revenues attributable to Sinovel
for 2009 were $198 million, leading to a substantial
concern of an $80 million disconnect between units
AMSC is delivering and completed turbines that
Sinovel is actually installing.  It appears that AMSC is
booking 140-200% more revenue from Sinovel in
the current year that Sinovel actually delivers to the
market.  While it initially could have been
considered a “ramping up”, that myth is now
debunked.  Unfortunately for AMSC, by the time
Sinovel’s installs catch up with inventory, it might be
too late.  Citron notes that Sinovel is now opening
new research facilities … and wonders how long
AMSC’s sweetheart deal survives before Sinovel
turns out its own power subsystems to replace
AMSC’s high margin power module.


But it Gets Much Worse


All we’ve heard from China for the last 2 or 3 years
was that they were going full blast on wind turbine
installations, and determined to become the world
leader in wind power.  This weather has changed
dramatically on this story over the past week,
beyond the above vanity comment.


1. China dramatically tightening credit,
which is slowing down the
proliferation of capital intensive
projects, particularly those notorious
ones that are leading to
overbuilding.


2. China clamps down speci�cally on
wind turbine production due to
oversupply.

[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010

turbine-output-capacity-
update1-.html] Global growth in the
turbine business is down from 30%
to 40% earlier in the decade to 8%,
and China is idling 40% of its wind
turbine factories.  Also investors
must note this piece, which observes
that pricing per kilowatt has fallen
nearly 20% during 2009.  This is
projected to lead to a further
narrowing of margins in the business
looking forward.

3. Now comes word that Chinese
o�cials are �oating a rethinking of
the massive commitment to wind
energy:  “China ‘not suitable’ for wind
power generation”, according to a
government o�cial in the Beijing
Times.

decades, but we note a signi�cant “wind shift” that
Chinese o�cials are beginning to mention them, in
light of life-expectancy concerns for capital-
intensive wind projects, particularly those that
publicly get tagged as “vanity projects” by
government o�cials.


Insider Sales


CEO Greg Yurek alone has sold over 375,000 shares
just this year, and consistently bangs out his
options as they are earned, retaining fewer shares
than he’s sold just during 2010.


Conclusion


Citron believes AMSC is vulnerable to the perfect
storm of converging concerns, not even considering
an escalating trade con�ict with China.  Looming
over AMSC is its extraordinary revenue dependency
on a single customer, with no real transparency on
how it maintains huge gross margins by providing
an increasingly commoditized subsystem, in China,
the most price-competitive marketplace on earth.


Additionally, it now faces vulnerabilities due to a
concern of an over�lled pipeline, plugged by a
downturn in China’s rate of installation of wind
turbines, caused by macro-economic conditions, as
capital for projects of questionable return dries up.


And when in doubt, Citron advises readers to
“follow the money”.   The furious rate of CEO
Yurek’s insider selling should cause any investor to
ask why they should be on the other side of his
trade.


Cautious investing to all.
