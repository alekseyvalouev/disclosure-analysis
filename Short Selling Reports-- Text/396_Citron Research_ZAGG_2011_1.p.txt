5/27/2018 ZAGG: What A Mess Under those Covers – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/zagg-what-a-mess-under-those-covers/ 2/12


Citron notes the insightful writings of others on
this red-flagged company, in particular Roddy Boyd
at  http://www.thefinancialinvestigator.com/
[http://www.thefinancialinvestigator.com/] and
Worthless Pennies, 
http://www.scribd.com/doc/45466615/ZAGG-
Presentation-12-14-10-Final-2
[http://www.scribd.com/doc/45466615/ZAGG-
Presentation-12-14-10-Final-2] , who have both
carefully documented the personal backgrounds of
a number of dodgy players in gadget protector
company ZAGG. 


However, Citron advises that to get to the heart of
ZAGG’s current problem, investors need to follow
the money.  If ZAGG’s current financial reporting
were as clear as its gadget protectors, we would
be inclined to withhold judgment on management’s
history.


But while the company is battling scarce cash, it
is perilously dependent on a single concentrated
retail relationship that in Citron’s opinion puts it at
huge risk of restatement.  Meanwhile there’s a
very troubling track record of insider
transactions among management that are


adverse to shareholder interests, an 11th hour
auditor switcheroo last year, and a long record
of abject failure at executing on “the next big
thing”.


For its readers, Citron notes these data points and
connects the dots.   For reasons we will document
below, it is Citron’s opinion that the company is in
desperate need of additional financing, and the
coming dilution will be at the hands of existing
investors to fund a business model that has
bankruptcy written all over it.


   Please Define “Execute”


Let’s evaluate this company from another
perspective:  What management says vs what
has really happened.


Last week the CEO of ZAGG came on CNBC and,
while dodging the real questions of the company’s

lack of cash flow, stated  “We are proud that the
company has ‘executed’ its business plan.”  When
Citron heard this, we didn’t know if he meant
executed (to carry out fully) or executed (to put to
death).  It seems that EVERY new business ZAGG
has entered over the past few years has been a
colossal failure.  Here is a sample of their press
releases and results.

To make matters worse, on the deal for the ZAGG
box, they had their own head of the audit
committee hoodwink them for over $4 million. 
When the head of your audit committee pulls a fast
one on the company, it is like your own mother
telling you “you’re ugly”.

Beneath the constant stream of cheerful sounding
PR’s, the company’s actual financial condition as
reported in its filings is appalling. There are

in ZAGG’s reported numbers, including increasing
SG&A as a percent of revenues, declining inventory
turns, and that glaringly small cash balance.  But
all you need to know is the little chart here from
Google finance that shows the cash flows of the
company


http://www.google.com/finance?
q=NASDAQ:ZAGG&fstype=ii
[https://www.google.com/finance?
q=NASDAQ:ZAGG&fstype=ii]   (Click the “Cash
Flow” tab)


So the business was generating zero cash a year
ago.  Since then, operations have burned an
increasing amount of cash, which loans and
equity issuance have shored up until now.   


 


Cash was so scarce at the end of last quarter
($1.7m), that the question could legitimately
be asked whether the company could make
payroll this month.  (SGA alone was $8.78m last
quarter)   And that is before considering how
iFrogz’s current burn rate will be funded.

   Kissing a Frog Doesn’t Make it a
Prince


ZAGG’s stock got a big boost when it acquired
competitor iFrogz for about $100 million in stock
and cash.


Why has the company has not filed the required 8-
K disclosing the financials of the acquired
5/27/2018 ZAGG: What A Mess Under those Covers – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/zagg-what-a-mess-under-those-covers/ 7/12


company?  Are we to believe that this acquisition
was done without benefit of an audit?  If not, how
could it be accurately valued?  If so, why haven’t
the audited numbers been shared with the
market?  iFrogz is itself just a wannabe competitor
for Skullcandy, and also competes directly with
ZAGG SKU’s, Citron wonders why this acquisition is
a justification to bid up the stock ?   ZAGG
mentioned that iFrogz has operating margins in the
20% range, but we find that hard to believe — that
is the range of the established brand Skullcandy
line.


For stock market history buffs, Citron believes
ZAGG has “Forward Industries (NASDAQ:FORD)
written all over it.

The problem is that accessories for electronic
gadgets is fundamentally a brutally bad business.
 The Financial Investigator and Worthless Pennies
did a fine job in describing the competitiveness
and razor thin margins of the screen protector
business.   The huge proliferation of SKU’s for each
new model of gadget is a big problem under the
best of circumstances.  Then there’s colors and
styling.  For runaway models such as iPad2, there’s
no barrier to entry.  The competitiveness and non-
differentiation in the iPad case business is so bad,
that even the New York Times ran a feature article
on the space just yesterday:

   The #1 Question Management
Will Not Answer

Ask anyone who works for Best Buy corporate
about Best Buy’s policies for returns of unsold
accessories (not to mention why they don’t private
label their own).   We have.   Also, if any of
Citron’s readers visited Consumer Electronics Show
over the past two years, you would note that there
are halls and halls dedicated to low price cell
phone covers that can be imported from China for
pennies.  It has become the ultimate commoditized
product in the accessory market.


Because of ZAGG’s concentration of sales to Best
Buy, investors are desperately in need of
transparency with regard to its rapidly rising
inventory.  How much of this “inventory” is good
inventory and how much is required to be bought
back from Best Buy?  Is this number accounted for
in write-downs?  It is a VERY simple question, but
management provides only circular answers.  They
have always maintained that Best Buy cannot
return product to them.  To this we say Bullshit.


On November 9, 2010, the Company conducted its
Third Quarter Earnings conference call.  Robert G.
Pedersen II, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,
and Brandon T. O’Brien, the Company’s Chief
Financial Officer, participated in the call on behalf
of the Company.  During the question and answer
portion of the conference call, Mr. O’Brien was
asked questions about Best Buy’s right to return
products sold by the Company to Best Buy.  In
response, Mr. O’Brien stated that the Best Buy
contract did not allow Best Buy to return products
to the Company.  As clarification to Mr. O’Brien’s
statement, the Company notes that Best Buy can
return products to the Company under limited
circumstances, including where products are
defective or for other similar customary
reasons. 


What defines a “customary reason”?  Are you
recognizing revenue on these “customary reason”
returns?  Would any of your sales terms to Best
Buy qualify as consignment basis ?   Do you pay
cash incentives to Best Buy?  How are inventory
levels determined?

The language employed by ZAGG to define this
relationship is extremely unusual; we could find
only a handful of companies in recent years that
used it … most have since ceased filing. 


   Is Management Worthy of
Investors’ Trust ?


To illustrate just how untrustworthy management
is, from the 10-K filed March 25, 2011, we learn of
the resignation of director Lorence Harmer.  But
magically, we learn that he resigned as Audit
Committee Chair back on November 5, 2010, over
four months prior!  Now that would have been an
event for which a definitive 8-K should have been
filed.


“On March 14, 2011, Lorence A. Harmer
resigned as a director of the Company.  Mr.
Harmer had served on several of our Committees
through November 5, 2010 including serving as
the Chairman of the Company’s Audit
Committee; as a member of our Compensation
and Stock Option Committee; and as a member
of our Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee.  Effective November 5, 2010,
Randall Hales was appointed as the chairman of
our Audit Committee.”

[http://www.faqs.org/sec-filings/110325/Zagg-
INC_10-K/#ixzz1RQMFlYt6]


 


We wouldn’t quibble if this was just one of those
“for personal reasons” resignations.  But it seems
Mr. Harmer had entered into a major related party
transaction with ZAGG over the “ZaggBox”, which
resulted in ZAGG having paid out deposits of over
$4 million dollars, for which it got nothing.  This
has now been papered over by a promissory note
from Harmer, secured by real estate with collateral
value insufficient to cover the principal.  And this

http://citronresearch.com/zagg-what-a-mess-under-those-covers/ 10/12


blatant related party transaction was
conducted by the Audit Committee Chair!


The larger problem here is ZAGG’s corporate
transactions are laced with inexplicable and
indefensible related party transactions similar to
this one.  


   Beware the PIPE


The absence of an 8-K with accurate financials for
iFrogz, along with Northlands constant table-
pounding begs us to ask the question … what will
come first:  the 8-K or the PIPE offering?


 


It has been a long time since we’ve seen an
analyst with the conviction of Northland’s – 4
upgrades and reiterations in the last week!   


Too bad Northland can’t anoint ZAGG as its “Pick of
the Year 2011”, that choice having already been
reserved for CCME.

Pick-of-2011-Northland-Securities
[http://www.scribd.com/doc/47598147/CCME-Top-
Pick-of-2011-Northland-Securities]


Do you think Northland might possibly have an
interest in getting a piece of the action in ZAGG’s
financing ?    


   Note to management: 


Don’t bother responding to this report.  ZAGG is
now a company with an enterprise value
approaching half a billion dollars … act like one. 


The problems in this stock are not the shorts.  It is
Citron’s opinion that this is what the market
demands of ZAGG: 


File an 8-K with the audited financials of
iFrogz


Give Wall Street fully transparent
disclosure on your entire relationship with

Best Buy, and


Start turning a cash profit 


   Conclusion


ZAGG’s stock is priced not for its current business,
but in anticipation of a highly profitable future. 
However, it is Citron’s opinion that ZAGG
management is simply not credible, and its track
record is not worthy of investors trust.  
Management’s track record is laced with blatant
self-dealing, execution failures, and disclosure
omissions.  The lack of transparency in its most
concentrated retail channel relationship puts it at
severe risk of a devastating earnings restatement.


Meanwhile, ZAGG simply has to raise cash.  It is
Citron’s opinion that a PIPE could come any day,
and a secondary would follow an 8-K on the iFrogz
acquisition.  It is Citron’s opinion that absent their
ability to raise cash from investors, ZAGG is a
likely candidate for bankruptcy inside of 24
months.


Citron disagrees with The Financial Investigator on
only one point:  the one where Roddy Boyd states
there is no barrier to entry to ZAGG business. 
NOT TRUE.   It is Citron’s opinion that the barrier
is that very few companies want to enter into a low
margin, money losing business.
