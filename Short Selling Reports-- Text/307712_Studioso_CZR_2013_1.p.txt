Caesars	Entertainment's	Future	In	Doubt:	Parabolic	Rise	Provides	An
Excellent	Opportunity	To	Exit
Feb.	11,	2013	6:00	AM	ET17	comments

On	Thursday,	7th	February	at	12.50pm	ET,	Caesars	Entertainment	(NASDAQ:CZR)	was
trading	at	$8.56,	with	a	market	capitalization	of	$1.07	billion.


On	Friday,	8th	February,	CZR	reached	an	intraday	high	of	$14.25	and	closed	at	$13.91.	In
less	than	two	trading	sessions,	the	stock	gained	over	66%.	From	the	intraday	lows	of
$7.12	reached	on	29	and	30	January,	the	stock	doubled	-	all	in	less	than	two	weeks.	At
Friday's	close,	the	company's	market	capitalization	has	ballooned	to	$1.743	billion.


What	caused	the	spike	in	the	CZR	share	price?	Not	much.	As	described	by	Seeking
Alpha's	Market	Currents	on	Thursday,	"Gaming	companies	with	ties	to	New	Jersey	are	on
the	move	after	Governor	Chris	Christie	asks	for	revisions	to	a	bill	covering	online	gaming
in	the	state."


Boyd	Gaming	(NYSE:BYD)	and	Zynga	(NASDAQ:ZNGA)	have	also	risen	sharply	since
that	announcement,	however,	not	anywhere	near	as	much	as	Caesars.


The	debt	market	also	suggests	that	the	move	in	Caesars	is	overdone.


This	page	shows	the	various	bonds	issued	by	Caesars,	and	their	worrying	details.


Most	issues	are	rated	no	higher	than	CCC,	and	many	are	trading	at	yields	in	the	high
teens.	The	most	active	bond,	(CUSIP	413627BM1,	10%	coupon	due	15	December	2018),
recently	traded	at	69.15,	to	yield	18.93%.


Despite	the	manic	activity	in	Caesars'	common	stock	on	Thursday	and	Friday,	CZR	bonds
only	moved	marginally	higher.	For	example,	the	above	December	2018	bond	was	at	65.50
before	the	online	gaming	announcement.	Even	after	price	rises	on	Thursday	and	Friday,
the	prices	and	yields	of	Caesars'	junk	bonds	strongly	suggest	that	the	online	gaming
announcement	will	have	little	effect	on	Caesars'	long-term	solvency.


Balance	sheet


Looking	at	the	most	recent	10-Q	for	Caesars,	we	can	see	the	following:

(all	figures	in	millions	of	dollars	as	at	30	September	2012)


Tangible	Assets 21,200


Goodwill 3,100


Other	intangibles 4,042


Total	assets 28,342


Current	liabilities 2,625


Long-term	debt 19,961


Deferred	credits	and	other 892


Deferred	income	taxes 4,749


Total	liabilities 28,228


Non-controlling	interest $81


Caesars	stockholders'	equity $33


Total	equity $114


We	can	see	clearly	that	Caesars	is	a	highly	leveraged	company,	with	nearly	$20	billion	of
debt,	compared	to	only	$114	million	in	equity	(and	only	$33	million	of	this	attributable	to
Caesars'	shareholders).	Furthermore,	if	we	exclude	goodwill	and	intangible	assets,	then
the	company	has	net	tangible	assets	of	about	negative	$7	billion!


Profit	and	loss


(all	figures	in	millions	of	dollars	for	9	months	ending	30	September	2012)


Revenue 6,572

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1169991-caesars-entertainments-future-in-doubt-parabolic-rise-provides-an-excellent-opportunity-to-exit 3/4


Expenses 6,654


Loss	from	operations 82


Interest	expense 1,574


Other	gains	/	income 89


Loss	from	continuing	operations 1,557


Not	only	is	Caesars	a	highly	leveraged	company,	it	is	struggling	to	earn	a	profit	from	its
operations,	before	considering	the	over	$1.5	billion	in	interest	expense	it	incurred	in	just
the	first	9	months	of	2012.


Secondary	offering	of	stock,	and/or	a	chance	for	insiders	to	exit?


Occasionally	biotech	companies	will	soar	by	50%	or	more	in	a	day	or	two,	just	like	the
recent	action	in	Caesars.	Like	many	biotech	companies,	Caesars	has	a	weak	balance
sheet,	and	is	generating	substantial	losses	each	year.	Like	many	biotech	companies,	this
spike	in	the	company's	share	price	provides	a	great	opportunity	to	sell	additional	stock	at
an	unusually	high	level	in	order	to	reduce	the	company's	debt	burden	and	interest
expense	burden.	One	would	not	be	surprised	if	Caesars	took	this	opportunity	to	sell
additional	common	stock,	if	the	share	price	remains	at	these	lofty	levels	in	the	coming
days.	On	this	topic,	on	12	April	2012,	the	company	filed	a	prospectus	to	sell	up	to	10
million	shares	from	time	to	time.


Furthermore,	the	spike	may	provide	a	chance	for	insiders	to	sell	some	of	their	shares
while	the	company's	share	price	and	trading	volume	remain	high.


Summary


Caesars'	long-term	future	is	in	doubt	as	evidenced	by	the	high	yields	its	bonds	attract	and
the	ratings	assigned	to	these	securities.	This	was	true	before	the	online	gaming	news
released	on	Thursday	and	little	has	changed	since	then.


Caesars	is	making	miniscule	operating	profits,	but	these	are	tiny	compared	to	the	massive
interest	expense	it	incurs	on	its	near	$20	billion	in	long-term	debt.

Caesars'	balance	sheet	is	a	good	example	of	an	overleveraged	company	that	will	most
likely	need	to	be	restructured	in	the	years	to	come,	either	as	a	friendly	negotiation	with
bondholders	or	in	bankruptcy	court.


The	negligible	change	in	the	price	of	Caesars'	bonds	on	Friday	confirms	that	the	online
gaming	announcement	will	have	little	effect	on	the	company's	long-term	viability,	and
suggests	that	the	66%	price	rise	in	the	company's	stock	following	the	online	gaming
announcement	is	excessive.

million	in	revenue	for	Caesars	and	$84	million	in	earnings	before	interest,	taxes,	depreciation	and	amortization".

This	is	a	tiny	amount	compared	to	the	company's	$1.55	billion	loss	from	continuing	operations	in	just	the	first	9	months
of	2012.
