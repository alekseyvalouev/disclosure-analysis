Focus Media: One strange disclosure, three interpretations
 


Here is a disclosure from the Focus Media 20F filing: 
 
 
 


2009 Disposition 


In 2009, we aborted a contemplated initial public offering for its Internet advertising segment due to the economic recession in


late 2008. As a result, between August and December 2009, we disposed of six underperforming subsidiaries in that segment


through a series of individual transactions with their respective original owners. Each of the subsidiaries was considered a


component of our company, and their results have been included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of


operations. The results of discontinued operations include net revenues and pretax losses of $127.6 million and $45.4 million,


respectively, related to these subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on disposal of $44.1 million.





The following table summarizes the acquired subsidiaries in the mobile handset advertising services segment and Internet


advertising segment that were sold back to their original owners in 2009:

7. Dongguan Yaya(7) 2007-10-1  Mobile handset advertising services $ 1,540,612  2009-2-28  $ 1,588,110  
 
(1) The original sellers which subsequently repurchased Catchstone were Only Education Holding Limited and Maxnew Holdings


Limited, BVI companies owned by a single PRC individual unrelated to our company.


(2) The original seller which subsequently repurchased WonderAd was Megajoy Pacific Limited, a BVI company ultimately owned


by seven PRC individuals unrelated to our company.


(3) The original sellers which subsequently repurchased Jiahua were two PRC individuals unrelated to our company.


(4) The original seller which subsequently repurchased Jichuang was Richcom International Limited, a BVI company owned by a


single PRC individual unrelated to our company.


(5) The original sellers which subsequently repurchased Keylink Global Limited were four PRC individuals unrelated to our


company.


(6) The original sellers which subsequently repurchased 1024 were two PRC individuals unrelated to our company.


(7) The original sellers which subsequently repurchased Dongguan Yaya were Sinoalpha Limited and Max Planet Limited, BVI


companies each of which is owned by a separate single PRC individual unrelated to our company. 
 








I want you dear readers to read and try to understand this disclosure. 
 
It says that we (Focus Media) were planning to IPO our internet
advertising segment but we aborted that plan "due to the economic
recession of late 2008". In other words we thought they were businesses
worth taking to IPO. 
 
Instead we took seven of our businesses and disposed of them at losses.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Focus Media: One strange disclosure, three interpretations


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/09/focus-media-one-strange-disclosure.html 2/7


Six of them we disposed of to the original owner. 
 
WonderAd and several others were given to the original owners.
14,926,003 dollars was paid for WonderAd. That was also the loss on
disposal - so presumably the business was given back to the original
owner. Same is true of Jiahua, Wangmai, Jichuang and 1024.
Donggyuan Yaya was also given away. 
 
There was a loss on disposal of $44.1 million from these subsidiaries. 
 
Prior to disposal these subsidiaries had $127.6 million in revenue and
$45.4 million in pre-tax losses. So they were big revenue earners - but
presumably they had over $170 million in costs. In China where wages
are low that is a lot of costs - they appear to have been large operations
with a lot of staff. 
 
Because they had large losses ($45.4 million pre-tax) and they did not
collapse I presume that Focus Media injected a great deal of cash into
the subsidiaries before it gave them back to the original owner for
whom in most cases the ownership vehicle was an untraceable British
Virgin Islands company. 
 
I have three possible interpretations - and without doing due diligence I
could not easily be certain which (if any) is the correct interpretation. 
 
Interpretation A: the accounting statements are entirely accurate 
 
In interpretation A the accounts are entirely straight. Focus Media
purchased many independent British Virgin Island companies running
internet advertising businesses in China. 
 
These businesses had well over $100 million revenue. 
 
However they all failed and cash - probably $40 plus million - needed to
be used to fund operating losses. 
 
Given the (not inconsiderable) pain of funding those operating losses
they wanted to close the businesses. But rather than close them they
found that the original owners were happy to take them back for no
consideration. Presumably the original owners can fund the losses and
know how to turn the businesses around. 
 
So they gave the businesses back to their original owners for no
consideration and closed the book on the whole sorry saga. 
 
Interpretation B: Focus Media management participated in the
looting of Focus Media 
 
These businesses were good or bad or possibly even non-existent.
However over $40 million dollars was paid for the businesses and the

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/09/focus-media-one-strange-disclosure.html 3/7


businesses were given back to the original owner (making the original
owners $40 million better off). Moreover a further $40 million was injected
into the businesses to just zip up the scale of the looting to something
even more attractive for the thieves. 
 
That is why you would do it in the British Virgin Islands. No tax to pay on
stolen money - and the companies are untraceable. Yipee! 
 
Interpretation C: The money was never there, the losses are fake
and they are used to wash fake profits 
 
In interpretation C, Focus Media reports fake profits over its main
businesses. These fake profits result in fake cash on the balance sheet
(something that is easily found by auditors). So they produce fake losses
to offset them. 
 
What better way to fake losses than buy some businesses, have
operating losses and write them off? 
 
And where better to locate the fake businesses but the British Virgin
Islands where they are untraceable? 
 
In this interpretation the underlying profitability of Focus Media is
grotesquely overstated. When the fake transactions stop the fake losses
stop and the fake profits get revealed. The poor private equity buyers
(and the suckers who lent them 1.5 billion dollars) are left holding a
turkey. 
 
Summary 
 
As I said it is very hard to tell which interpretation is correct without doing
due diligence. But due diligence is going to be very hard because the
losses are buried in untraceable British Virgin Island subsidiaries. I hope
Focus retained enough documentation to verify the first interpretation -
and I hope the auditor has traced the BVI subs. Moreover I hope the
original owners can be found. 
 


Which interpretation is found to be correct under due diligence matters a
lot for the take-private deal. 
 
The first two interpretations are acceptable to the PE buyers and if either
is true the deal will probably close. 
 
If the acquisitions were bad (as per the first interpretation) then the PE
buyers can stop that prospectively. After all PE buyers can do due
diligence and do not have to close bad acquisitions. 
 
If the company was looted (as per the second interpretation) then the PE
buyers can stop that prospectively - after all Carlyle and Fountainvest
should be competent to construct rigorous financial control of businesses
that they acquire.

The third interpretation is utterly terrible for Focus Media stock. In that
case Focus Media is a Chinese display media company that uses very
complex BVI transactions to fake their profits. Real profitability would be
low - but ultimately unknowable. The privatisation will fail under due
diligence. 
 
Moreover what is left would be a Chinese display media company which
fakes their accounts using untraceable BVI entities. What is that worth?
Certainly far less than the current multi-billion dollar market cap. 
 
Now of course off the disclosure I can't tell which of these three
interpretations is correct. But if the deal fails then intellectually you are
led to the third interpretation. The upside for the stock is to $27 - the bid
price. The downside? Large.

This transaction stinks to high heaven. 
 
Had it happened later when there was more of a focus on China frauds this company
would have gone down. 
 
I can't believe the SEC did not investigate.  
 
Current shareholders should take the buyout deal. It is better than staying with suspect
management. And of course, this is a Neil Shen deal.

I guess you already heard about this.  
 
"Chinese Business Leaders Condemn Citron 
 
Citron is an âinvestment analysis companyâ owned by Mr. Andrew Left, a man with a long
record of fraud, deceit, and unlawful behavior. Citronâs reports take advantage of the
information asymmetry between China and the US, and boldly tell lies, knowing that their
American readers have no way of verifying them." 
 
Some kind of backlash that was bound to happen. But the comments don't give them
much sympathy:

John, you use the present tense in Interpretation C. Where are the fake profits going
today? 
 
New acquisition spending in the years following 2008. 
2009: "Nothing significant" 
2010: $5.3m 
2011: $8.7m, with an additional $15.5m of future earn-outs. 
 
They've claimed over $250m of net profit from 2009 to 2012-Q2. They haven't been
spending it in acquisitions. There wasn't any major reduction in screen counts or per-
screen revenues. 
 
To resolve this with Interpretation C means that the fraud must have been accelerating,
right?

not to say these transactions aren't most likely fraudulent, but focus media didn't
necessarily have to inject any cash into these companies, as they could be non cash
costs eg. asset writedowns. 
 
Assuming Focus bought these businesses at book value, that means they had $44mn of
book value. And if the business for some reason is no longer viable and you have to write
everything down you would end up with roughly $44mn of losses (which was their
reported loss). Thats your entire book value wiped out, and the business is therefore
worth zero. Since its not worth anything, they just gave the businesses away. The whole
thing still stinks, but technically, no extra cash infusion was needed and it does explain
why they gave the businesses away.

Frauds pretty much always accelerate. When you're borrowing from Peter to pay Paul,
you always want a bit extra just in case... Which means you then need to borrow more
from Paul to repay Peter!

StanCard - not true my friend. Losses were larger than acquisition price and larger than
total assets. 
 
Losses had to be paid for in cash. I did not match the cash exactly because of the
problem you spotted.

Kai-Fu Lee works in the Internet sector in China. And most of the "Chinese business
leaders" who signed onto his letter are also from ... surprise! ... The Internet sector. 
 
The Internet sector depends on faith, to a greater extent than any other sector of the
economy except banking. They're looking for angel funding. Then they're looking for VC
funding. Then they're looking for investors dumb enough to buy their IPO at inflated
prices and cash everyone out. 
 
Their greatest fear is that someone will come along and point out that the emperor has no
clothes. Especially someone with a great deal of credibility, from having exposed so many
frauds in the past. Because then, the angel/VC/IPO pyramid will collapse.

also agreed to permit The Carlyle Group to appoint an observer to our board of directors
for a limited period of time.â

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Focus Media: One strange disclosure, three interpretations


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/09/focus-media-one-strange-disclosure.html 6/7


 
Form 20-F 5/6/08 fn 3 p. F-17 âOn March 28, 2007, the Group acquired Allyes Information
Technology Company Limited (âAllyesâ), the leading internet advertising company in
China. The purchase price included cash of $70,000,000 and 19,969,080 ordinary shares
having a fair value of $154,281,112â¦â 
 
Form 20-F 6/20/11 p. 72: âIn January 2010, certain employees and management of Allyes
and certain members of the Companyâs management and directors entered into a
definitive agreement with the Company and Allyes to buy-out an aggregate 38% interest
in Allyes from the Company for a cash consideration of $13.3 million. On July 30, 2010 â¦
the Company sold to Silver Lake Media the Companyâs entire remaining 62% ownership
interest in Allyes at a cash consideration of $124 million.â 
 
Form 20-F/A 4/24/12 p. 120 âIn January 2010â¦ in order to encourage Allyes Online
management to invest (and thus remain with the business), Jason Jiang [Focusâ founder
and CEO with @ 18% ownership] and Kit Low, who... was in the process of being
appointed its chief financial officer, offered to invest their own capital in Allyes under the
same terms that Focus Media was offering to Allyesâ management. By making this offer,
Messrs. Jiang and Low attempted to show their confidence in Allyesâ business, so that
they could encourage the remaining Allyes team to invest, stay in their positions, and
commit to Allyesâ successâ¦ This transaction was part of initiatives we are taking to
incentivize management to enhance the future business model of Allyes and thereby to
seek long term sustainable growth for the Group and investors." 
 
Form 20-F 5/6/08 Fn 17 p. F-28âIn March 2006, Weiqiang Jiang, father of Jason Nanchun
Jiang, provided a short-term loan to the Group of approximately $2.5 million to relieve a
temporary shortage of Renminbi the Group experienced at that time. The loan was
unsecured and non-interesting bearing. At the end of June 2006, the Group paid $2.5
million to Everease and they remitted this fund to Weiqiang Jiang on our behalf to repay
the loan outstanding.â 
 
Could this be the same Jiang Weiqiang who was the Director-General of the International
Bureau of the State Council Information Office?  
 
Happy shorting!

The sad reality is that the fiction extends into the buyout itself. Just as was the case with
Harbin, the numbers make no sense if you actually believe the headline numbers. Very
much as the revenues were bogus and the earlier acquisitions were bogus...so too is the
privatization deal a construct of imaginary numbers. 
 
Were any of us the fly you described we would probably appreciate the controlling
shareholders discounting their shares a billion dollars and only makinng 200 million on
the fraud. We might see Carlyle taking 40 -50% of the transaction cost back in fees. We
might see the China development bank pissing off 5-600 million because the Vice
Chairman said it was a good idea. 
 
The players didn't walk a multi billion dollar offer into the public arena without a bit of DD.
The unanswerable question is whether they can make the numbers work fully
understanding that the US valuations are unsupportable.  
 
The conceit of your presentations is that you presume some new found level of honesty
that cloaks Carlyle et al, but was absent earlier. This is a deal FMCN is convinced will
make significant money and they are also convinced they can get it done. IMHO

This is an awful deal for the pe firms. They will get ripped off.  
 
But even if they become aware of this during due diligence they will close the deal. 
As you mentioned in a previous post Focus Media is linked to the chinese establishment.  
The western pe players don't want to damage their precious relationships by breaking the
deal now. So many well connected people have something to gain from this deal. You
don't want anybody to loose face, do you ?

And it's only clients' money after all. The fiction can go on for years before anybody needs
to write-off the investment. Most individuals involved in the deal will be with other
companies by then.

Pe firms are desperate to do a high profile china deal. Otherwise they get heat from LPs
for sitting on so much cash and charging mgmt fees for doing nothing for so long.  
 
Does it matter to them if fmcn is real or not?

Is it possible that these PE firms would buy this company to cash out the insiders as
basically a form of massive bribe, so they can then do other profitable or questionable
business in China?
