Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


 
Recently Bronte advertised for an entry level position. We have now
hired. 
 
There was one interview question which nobody gave an entirely
satisfactory answer to, and many people gave unsatisfactory answers
to. 
 
This is not surprising. I don't have an entirely satisfactory answer either.
The question was about Alibaba - the Chinese internet giant - and the
only reason I am going public is that Barrons has asked several of the
same questions and Alibaba has responded. 
 
As preamble I told the prospective employees what Alibaba was and
what Singles Day was. This was graduate recruitment so I could not be
sure that everyone would know even that. So I said: 
 
i). Alibaba inside China is the biggest but not only online shopping site
with Tabao and TMall. These were essentially flea-markets where lots
of people had stalls (shops within shops) and they sold a huge number
of items. Think of it as a combination of Amazon and Ebay and you will
not be far wrong. 
 
ii). Alipay is the standard way of paying for something online. Think of
it as the equivalent of PayPal. Note there is a major competitor
(Tenpay). 
 
iii). Singles Day is a sort of anti-Valentines Day. On Valentines Day if you
are attached you go out with your beloved. On Singles Day you go out
and try to find a beloved. However more importantly it was the big day
of online sales - think of it as Black Friday in America or Boxing Day in
Australia. It is the biggest shopping day of the year.


I then gave the candidates two stories about Alibaba on Singles day.
One was sourced from the BBC and one from an Australian website. The
BBC reported in US dollars, the Australian site reported in Australian
dollars. [Ultimately both are sourced from an Alibaba press release.] 
 
I also indicated that the questions would be along the lines of "how
interesting is this" and "how much bigger can it get". The rule of thumb
of course is that if an internet company can grow 500% from here you

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 2/35


probably should own the stock. However if it is near the end of its
growth period you should not own the stock - because it will derate. 
 
Here were the articles - and I want you to read as if you were doing the
job interview. Allow yourself 15 minutes... 
 
The BBC article... 
 
and the Australian article... 
 
http://www.powerretail.com.au/news/singles-day-2014/ 
 
Starting question: How much bigger can this get? 
 
Lots of people started by arguing from China's growth rate - and they
got projections 5x, 10x bigger than now. But a few noted that 278
million deliveries on Singles Day was "a lot" and thought that maybe it
could double from here but ten times was not likely. 
 
But at this point I wanted to explore the 278 million deliveries number.
So the question is "how many internet users in China". Most people
guessed a number that was reasonable - so I pointed them to official
numbers. Roughly 650 million would be a good guess. The official
number at the end of 2013 was 618 million - and the growth rate has
already slowed. 
 
So there was 278 million deliveries for a total prospective 650 million
users. In one day! The question is how much bigger can this get and
what drives it to be bigger? 
 
I then pointed them to official numbers that said that Amazon
(worldwide) had 244 million users. That was 244 million separate
accounts made at least one order in the past twelve months. The
Amazon numbers are here. 
 
Alibaba delivered more parcels in a single day than Amazon had users in
a whole year. 
 
Most people then figured that the users had multiple deliveries which is
I guess a possibility. However it worth comparing this to Cyber Monday
in the US. This article - which I presume is accurate - gives Amazon
orders for Cyber Monday. To quote: 


In order to uphold its reputation for fast deliveries, Amazon
hired 80,000 seasonal workers in anticipation of Cyber Monday
and the holiday shopping season, according to a report
released by the company. Last year, Amazon sold about 426
items per second on Cyber Monday, and the online retailer
expects to sell even more this year.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 3/35


426 items per second is almost 37 million items. This is more directly
from an Amazon press release. Singles day is 7.5 times bigger. To match
Amazon in timeliness of delivery they would need to hire 600 thousand
seasonal workers who work at the same efficiency as Amazon workers.
Note that Amazon workers work with a lot of robots and other
technology to pick and file and deliver items. 
 
The Alibaba 20-F (the SEC filed annual report) does not show anything
like this number of employees... to quote: 
 
Employees
       As of March 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we had a total of 20,674,
22,072 and 34,985 full-time employees, respectively. Substantially all of
our employees are based in China.
       The following table sets out the breakdown of our full-time
employees by functions as of March 31, 2015:





At the accounting date the total number of employees was under 35
thousand. Amazon - which has much smaller peak loads and far more
obvious investment in high efficiency warehouses has more than 150
thousand employees. 
 
However Footnote 1 on the above table notes that this does not include
"third-party consultants and contractors that we employ, substantially
all of whom are based in China. These consultants and contractors
primarily performed work related to sales, research, logistical support
and customer service."

The number of employees presented in this table does not
include third-party consultants and contractors that we

Our total number of employees increased to 34,985 as of
March 31, 2015 from 22,072 as of March 31, 2014. Of the
increase in employees, approximately 7,300 was due to the
completion of our acquisitions including UCWeb, OneTouch,
Alibaba Pictures and AutoNavi, and a majority are engaged in
engineering and data analysis.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 4/35


If Alibaba were as efficient as Amazon (meaning just as many
computers/robots etc) and had the same delivery schedules as Amazon
there would need to be about a million employees at Alibaba and its
consultants and another 600 thousand or so seasonal employees around
Singles Day. 
These numbers are consistent with the annual report. 
 
Again to quote the 20-F. 


We believe that orders from transactions generated on our
marketplaces represented a significant portion of our delivery
partners' total delivery volumes in the twelve months ended
March 31, 2015. According to data provided by them as of
March 31, 2015, our top 14 strategic delivery partners
employed over 1,400,000 delivery personnel in more than 600
cities and 31 provinces, directly controlled municipalities and
autonomous regions in China. Collectively they operated more
than 100,000 delivery stations. This network managed the
delivery of over 8.6 billion packages from our China retail
marketplaces to consumers in the twelve months ended March
31, 2015.


It may be possible that Alibaba has outsourced logistics almost entirely
- with a million outsourced employees controlled by 35 thousand in-
house employees. The numbers in the annual report are consistent with
this. This however is a much more "virtual" view of Alibaba than I had
previously held. Amazon wins through logistical superiority. You would
not want to compete with them. Alibaba it seems wins through
logistical outsourcing of the highest quality. 
 
We should also note the scale of the 8.6 billion packages the network
claims to have delivered. UPS delivered 4.6 billion packages per
year and had 435 thousand employees, 539 aircraft (including charters),
about 100,000 delivery vehicles and almost 2000 operating facilities.
[UPS factsheet here.] 
 
To truly deliver at a larger intensity than Amazon Alibaba and its
outsource network would need more staff or capital (or both) than
Amazon and UPS combined. 
 
The size and scope of Alipay
 
Only a couple of my candidates (all of whom wound up on the short list)
noticed the throw-away line in the Australian article about the size of
Alipay. To quote:


At the peak of the event, 2.85 million transactions were
processed every minute by Alipay.


Now I asked "how many transactions per day do you think is 2.85 million
in the peak minute"?

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 5/35


If they started to multiply by 60 and then 24 this was a problem.
Obviously the peak minute is much higher than the volume at 3AM. I
mean when have you ever used PayPal at 3AM? The peak day is
obviously enough less than 24 hours worth of the peak minute. 
 
A pretty good guess is that the peak day should be between 4 and 9
hours of the peak minute (in other words the peak day is somewhere
between 2.85*60*4 million transactions and 2.85*60*9 million
transactions). This seems sensible. I have discussed with several people
in the payment industry the ratio of peak minute to peak day volumes
and got numbers in this range - but I do not have definitive numbers. [If
someone from PayPal or Visa wants to come through with something
definitive I would like it.]
 
7 hours of peak minute (which my informal research says is reasonable)
is about 1.2 billion transactions in the day. That is two per internet user
in China. That is to say a large number.
 
Now Alipay is roughly the equivalent of PayPal. It might be used more
than PayPal because people send remittances on it. It is unlikely to be
used as much as Visa. After all Visa is used in the shops all the time.
Look at your own life and ask yourself how much you use Visa and how
much you use PayPal.
 
We can do a comparison to Visa. Visa overbuilds capacity - they
have built capacity to 56 thousand messages per second. We know from
another press release that was about 4 times the actual peak in 2013.
So the 2013 peak was 14,000 transactions per second - which is 840
thousand per minute.
 
Visa's peak transaction volume globally is only about 30 percent of
Alipay's peak minute. This suggests a level of shopping in China that
puts the US, Europe and most of Asia to shame.
 
So I asked: Are there any other ways of reconciling these numbers?
 
Some people suggested (a) multiple deliveries for items, (b) that many
of the items delivered were virtual items such as emoji and their
delivery is not technically problematic and (c) insufficient data handling
capacity and hence queuing explaining the almost absurdly large peak
minute on Alipay.
 
So I asked: How would you test this. And I got some interesting answers
- some of which might require a little work to pan out. However some
answers wound up looking silly. If you think for instance that a
substantial proportion of the transactions are low-value emoji then the
remaining transactions wind up with implausibly high average value. 
 
But a few - knowing Bronte's history - suggested that we could not
dismiss the idea that Alibaba was faking their numbers.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 6/35


 
Most people who suggested that knew what an extraordinary (and
potentially outrageously profitable) suggestion it was. After all some
two-bit reverse merger Chinese company might be a fraud - but you can
only make a limited profit from that. The idea that Alibaba - a company
with half the market cap of Google might be making its numbers up is -
well - extraordinary.
 
So I responded - fairly - that 
 
(a) extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence (known
ubiquitously as the Carl Sagan standard), and
 
(b) extraordinary claims offer extraordinary opportunities for profit (as
the market is very wrong) and hence it might be worth gathering the
evidence so we can accept or reject the extraordinary claim.
 
And so here was the key point to the question: how would we go about
gathering that evidence and what sort of evidence would you
require to put the trade (short Alibaba) on? 
 
I should be clear that I do not have the extraordinary evidence - but
I do think it is a thesis worth testing...
 
This was a tough question - and I did not expect many (if any) good
answers. So I am going to leave it to you dear readers for comments. I
am perfectly willing to accept answers which demonstrate that the
"fake numbers" thesis is wrong. Indeed the thesis is extraordinary and
hence likely to be wrong.
 
However before I go I should look a little at delivery data. The 20-F
(quoted above) suggested that the delivery network had 1.4 million
employees and over 100,000 delivery stations. This suggests an average
of 14 employees per delivery station and there must be a huge number
with less than 10 employees including the truck drivers who actually do
the delivery.
 
There was a Wall Street Journal story recently about delivery
infrastructure in the provinces. There was a picture of a delivery
station in Northeastern China. It was - to put it mildly - crude.

Another image of even more crude sorting technology heads
a Bloomberg article: 
 


 
 
 
Ramping something with this lack of automatic sorting technology up
for Singles Day would require a lot of staff. Some candidates thought of
trying to count them. 
 
With 100,000 delivery stations it is unlikely to be possible to do it on a
statistical basis by counting trucks. There are far too many locations
and they are too heterogeneous. 
 
Maybe you could do it with official employment numbers. But in China
that is almost certainly a dead end. Chinese employment numbers are
amongst the most suspect of all Chinese economic data. 
 
Alibaba's own promotion material contains several videos of their
logistic operations. Here is a video interview of a woman describing the
seasonal work packing boxes for Singles Day.

The woman states she will normally pack about 200 packages a day but
on Singles Day she will do 800-900. If it takes her 50 seconds to pack a
package (reasonable looking at the process) and she takes 5 minutes
break per hour packing 800 packages will take about 12 hours. I guess
that is reasonable. But to do the volume for Singles Day would require
350 thousand such people just in packaging, not even delivering. 
 
The company has videos of its logistics as well. Here is a summary video
- with pictures of the delivery network: 
 
 
 





 
 
(The original can be found here...) 
 
The company also has b-roll material (which they license widely) which
has quite extensive video of the conveyor belt systems and the sort. 
 
 


 
 
Strangely much of the material involves people standing around and
multi-handling material on conveyor belts rather than doing the real
function of a sorting facility (that is making choices therefore sorting).

Similarly there is b-roll material of packaging happening in one of
Tabao's merchant shops. This involves distinctly low-tech (and slow)
packaging and sorting for Singles Day. It is however clearly in part
aimed at a Western audience (and presumably Western investors) as the
whiteboard is in part in English. 
 
 





 
We have some data about the size and the amounts of capital deployed
in this delivery network. Here is a relatively old fact sheet (stated
volume has risen substantially since then). 
 
http://www.alizila.com/fact-sheet-cainiao-alibaba-groups-logistics-
platform 
 
Here is an article and video about Alibaba/Tabao rural service centers: 
 
http://www.alizila.com/cainiao-alibabas-logistics-arm-opens-video 
 
There is some evidence in this video about people making multiple
orders as in some rural centers there is a single woman who places
multiple orders for an entire village. The distribution center however is
not heavily endowed with advanced technology. There is no evidence
that in any way the capital equipment at Alibaba and its distribution
partnership comes close in scale and quality to the infrastructure of
(say) UPS. However the delivery volumes are larger than UPS and Fedex
combined and the employment levels are similar (in aggregate). 
 
It is worth comparing this to videos of Amazon's warehouse and packing
system.

 There is also a Fedex and UPS documentary on Bloomberg which gives
some idea of the scale of these behemoth organisations. When this was
filmed (2012) the combined volume of UPS and Fedex was well below
the volume of Alibaba's delivery network. Still it is worth comparing
how much capital equipment the US giants have to how little is in the
Alibaba network: 
 
 





 
 
At this point I know the numbers are wonky - but working out whether
this is material or not (or how material) will require some fine
measurement techniques. 
 
The two best candidates both had good ideas on this - but again
testability is going to be hard. I would accept ideas by email too.
 
 
Thanks.

A few ideas: 
 
- Quantification of a certain product needed for delivery: trucks, scanning machines, etc 
- Quantification of warehouse capacity needed for delivery: can it satisfy peak demand? 
- Quantification of labour needed for delivery: slack in the labour market enough to satisfy
temporary worker demand? 
- Estimate Baidu search query spike to see how much Singles Day shopping is likely to
have increased compared with other dates of the year 
- Check with supplier data: delivery volumes for Shunfeng 顺丰 etc 
- Double-check government VAT tax receipts 
- Double-check macro data on retail sales, and compare with retail as % of GDP figures 
- Double-check with a popular item sold on Taobao/Tmall: how much do their sales go up
on Single Day? 
- Customer surveys: "how many packages do you buy 1) on Singles Day 2) per year"? 
- How much do competitors' sales (eg JD.com 京东 or Amazon.cn 亚马逊) go up on
Singles Day: contrast and compare 
- Check whether Alibaba has lied in the past, if so they are likely to have continued to do
so 
- Check cash flows: if Singles Day is a huge event, then cash flows are likely to spike for
that quarter (OCF can be manipulated though, as they seem to be doing) 
- Ask industry experts: consultants, professors. If anyone, they should be able to come up
with ideas on how to double-check the numbers

If ali is a cross between Amazon and eBay then there is a part (eBay) that doesn't need
warehousing and logistics as it is done by the seller. It depends how big the eBay part is
to judge the numbers.

The volume comparison (thus labor required) between amazon and alibaba is not a great
one. Mainly because amazon holds inventory and needs workers to pack and deliver.
Whereas, alibaba, is more like ebay in this area. It is a platform for merchants. The
merchants are 'individually' responsible for packing and delivering.

One thought and one thought only. Is Alibaba's delivery network more like that of e-Bay?
In that it's the sellers themselves, running their virtual storefronts, who do the packaging
and dispatching? 
 
Or is it more like Amazon, where Alibaba handles all of that?


September 16, 2015 at 5:37 PM


John Hempton said...


Alibaba has its own delivery network which it owns a stake in and provides software for.
That is well documented on their IR site. 
 
It delivers more than UPS and FEDEX combined.

So, what percentage of Alibaba's yearly business is supposedly in this one Singles Day? 
 
Also, what's up with the other book of the accounting? Where's all Alibaba's profits are?

P.S. Also, Alibaba's claim that the amount of their active accounts does indeed approach
the amount of chinese online shoppers as a whole can be tested by a fairly simple and
cheap online survey.

The long way: sign up to Alibaba, place a couple of orders with tracking, watch the route.
That should identify logistic centers. Then online research or even a site visit to gauge
their capacity. 
 
Might also be worth the effort to sign up as a seller and carefully observe the experience. 
 
Since both times, we're trying to verify magnitude, not +- 20%, should be telling enough.

Reach out to German retail giant Metro and verify that the only thing Alibaba does for
their TMALL shop at https://metro.tmall.hk/ is assisting in customs clearance. As far as I
understand everything else, logistics, warehousing, packaging is handled by Metro and its
employees. The question is... how much of that insane Singles Day volume is handled by
Alibaba and how much by its Tmall merchants with little or no involvement of Alibaba
workers.

interesting article and very well written. I just want to add some personal experience as a
foreigner living in China. It is 4pm in the afternoon and my wife has received already few
deliveries from Taobao. In my office (20 people) the door constantly rings with deliveries. I
estimate that each person receives on average at least 1-2 deliveries per day from
taobao. I don't really know how to explain it - Taobao is so pervasively embedded in
people's everyday life and shopping habits that it is difficult to believe unless you
experience it. When my family spend summer back in the US, we never shop on Amazon
as much as we shop on Taobao. We buy something on Amazon perhaps once a week I
would say. Ok, twice. But here we buy something on Taobao EVERY DAY. And normally
multiple purchase every day. I (nor anyone I know) ever goes to a mall to buy something.
The sheer size of cities makes it so much more convenient to get your shopping done on
Taobao that it makes no sense to do otherwise.  
Regarding Alipay, it is widely used not just to buy items on taobao. I give you an example
- today I purchase some coffee capsules from Nespresso. Alipay is the payment system.
Very few commerce sites in China ask for credit card numbers (penetration is still low).
Everyone asks for your Alipay login. So I would not be surprised if a significant amount of
transactions on Alipay has nothing to do with Alibaba core business.  
Regarding logistic during single day. Again, it is difficult to describe. I will give you some
anecdotal evidence. There are two stores near my office - neighborhood-size logistic
centre (third party. There are several logistic companies and yes, Alibaba owns stake in
the largest if I am not mistaken). When you see the word logistic center don't think of the
super massive infrastructure that Amazon operates. Sometimes there are multiple
centers servicing just a neighborhood - a-la mom and pop. As a cycle to work, these
centers are normally closed (early in the morning) and if I stroll by during the day, they are
busy but nothing strange to really notice. During Single Day - oh man. It is incredible. The

packages spill out of the store, on the sidewalk and occupy part of the street disrupting
traffic. It is a madhouse at all time of the day and nite - hundreds of people coming and
going. Delivery men stacking up their bicycles and scooters to the brim. It is hard to
believe. And indeed delivery times lengthen a bit. normally you get something from tabao
within 24h. No matter where the seller is in China. It is freaking efficient. I don't know how
it is done. During Single Day, I think deliveries lengthen to 48h or 72h.  
And yes - taobao is predominantly an infrastructure where each seller runs its own
business.  
I am not sure this helps at all the convo.

I am an equity analyst in an Asia hedge fund and I cannot help to leave a comment on
this Blog. I really suggest writer of such articles to consult Company before you make
accusations, because some of the questions will be easily answered (of course, unless
some of the writers are ill motivated). 
 
Regarding this case,  
1. One of the most basic concept is that Alibaba has a different business model with
Amazon, as has been pointed out already in the previous comments. Alibaba operates a
platform, which allow sellers and buyers to transact. Alibaba's revenue comes from
commission and advertising.  
 
In other words, unlike Amazon, Alibaba itself does not operate warehouses or delivery
teams, and they do not take inventory risk. Comparing Alibaba's staff number with
Amazon and thus draw a conclusion of logistics capacity is not appropriate.  
 
2. China Smart Logistics, which showed up a couple of times in the article, is a Logistics
Information System company. I have to emphasize again, Information System. There is
no warehouses or logistics team.  
 
3. The 278mn orders is the orders made on that Single Day, which does not automatically
mean that all 278mn orders are delivered on the single day. In fact, the 278mn orders
could take many days to complete, depending on the logistics capacity of sellers on
Alibaba's platform.  
 
I don't want to write too long, but you get the idea. Please further investigate and clarify
with company if possible. JD.COM (JD:US) is more close to Amazon's business model in
China, FYI.

Good read, fascinating logic. 
 
However, as others have noted, the premise of the question seems to be a
misunderstanding of Alibaba's business. Alibaba is mainly a shopfront (eBay). Alibaba
introduces buyer and seller and then 'supervises' the sales transaction through things
such as "buyer protection" http://activities.aliexpress.com/adcms/www-aliexpress-
com/buyerprotection/index.php?spm=2114.11010108.1000001.1.EGb058. Its not true
escrow but it seems to work. 
 
The merchants themselves stock, pack and dispatch purchases. Ali's Singles Day
number is basically just recording transactions which it has booked for other merchants.

I think Alan has made the point. Once a mainlander, here is my 5 cents: 
 
The 3 biggest logistics companies, mainly partner with Taobao, are SF Express, ZTO
Express and STO Express. SF Express has international network. The rest 2 are
mainland only. SF Express has 12000 'service centers' in mainland China, according to
their website: http://www.sf-express.com/cn/en/others/about/expanding/ It is reasonable
to assume the three have more or less the same size of network. So total service centers
are about 36000, which means each service center need to handle 7700 orders to fulfill
278mn orders on singles day. I think that isn't entirely impossible.  
 
Chinese logistics companies might not have the technology Amazon has, but the workers
are much more hardworking. Because the service centers are mostly operated like
franchise, most workers are also owners, and it is not unusual to see them working 5 am
until 10 pm, everyday.

"Strangely much of the material involves people standing around and multi-handling

My guess is they are arranging the packages so that the bar code can be scanned easily.
There seems to be a bar code on just one side and they don't have multi-directional
automatic scanners like in the UPS video.  
 
If the numbers add up there is vast potential to improve operations. 
 
To check your thesis you need more data. Offer to buy tracking data from customers for a
rebate, but don't say you need it to check a short thesis :-)

Thanks - interesting article. 
 
In terms of the amount of packing/sorting required, it's conceivable for merchants to pre-
pack many items (so just need to attach printed label + invoice), or even for them to pre-
sort the packages by provinces/cities, to save processing time.  
 
One key aspect of the Singles day promotion is that the merchants prepare for days or
even weeks for the event and it's them who drive which items get sold in vast volumes, by
setting the discount.  
 
I would echo some previous comments about a) Ali is just the middle man; b) logistic
operations are big and efficient. But another factor is the fact that some merchants might
not be reporting wholy correct numbers to Ali, i.e. when they say to Ali or the customer an
item has been 'shipped', what they really mean might be that they have received an order
and are in the process of preparing for it. Another possibility is that the merchant has
'shipped' the item to the warehouse of the logistics company, where delays are very likely
to happen due to the huge strain on the system.  
 
I had the impression that delays in shipping for up to 2 weeks are common and are
tolerated by customers. After all the discounting is very significant.

Using analogies with foreign companies can lead to oversimplification. Alibaba is
effectively both the eBay (Taobao) and Amazon (Tmall) of China. As many have pointed
out, many shops on Taobao handle their own logistics, so the comparison to Amazon
does not apply. 
 
However, it is Alipay in particular that is mischaracterised by calling it an equivalent of
Paypal. The Alipay app can be used to pay in grocery stores (for example in Suguo
supermarkets), for taxis and many other things that have no relation to Alibaba. Unlike
Paypal, Alipay also provides an escrow service. Funds in an Alipay account accrue

interest at a slightly higher rate than in banks. I know of trading companies sometimes
paying suppliers using Alipay because of its advantages vs. the slow, bureaucratic and
awkward banking experience in mainland China. A comparison to Paypal is of no use in
evaluating the limits of Alipay's business.

John, exaggerating Singles Day volume for promotional reasons is entirely possible, but
doesn't make for a great short thesis. Consider QIHU, which has lied about its market
share in every single press release for 5 years...claiming to touch hundreds of millions of
users is impossible to verify and says something about the company's integrity, but not its
profitability. (There have been other, valid reasons to short QIHU but that is hardly one of
them).  
 
BABA may overstate Singles Day a bit in its press releases but that does not call the
financials into question.

John, like many of the posters have noted, Amazon doesn't seem like the right
comparison, but more so ebay. It is not a retailer in any sense of the word. It is a capital
light logistics company that has a marketplace matching buyers and sellers, analogous to
priceline, expedia, and ebay. JD.com is the Amazon model and I would note is 1/2 as big
as Amazon and growing triple digit.  
 
For checks, I would start with the logistics partners. There are so many publicly traded,
state owned, and 3rd party companies to tap into for information. And on alipay vs.
paypal, I think its important to focus on the fact that alipay is ubiquitous, used offline and
is the defacto standard for online payments. Tenpay and Baidu would be good places to
start to look into Alipay. 
 
Next take a look at JD.com. It is 1/2 as big as Amazon on a GMV basis already and is
growing GMV 100%'ish so will be larger in probably 4-6 quarters. JD.com is everything
Amazon is. They own the logistics network AND they own last mile delivery, so even
more capital intensive than Amazon. And in addition to JD, Tencent would be a great
place to start your checks given they have a large equity stake and provide traffic to JD
thru wechat. How could JD.com be 1/2 as big as Amazon??? 
 
One thing that doesn't seem to be getting brought up at all, when looking at baba's scale,
is that Tencent's user base is 2-3x as big as baba's. How does that occur with only 650m
internet users? How could Tencent have 900m users? C-Trip and Qunar each have
200m'ish users...Maybe they are all lying...Or maybe there 1.4bn people in China and
maybe the 650m number is off? 
 
You have put together a thoughtful article but there are many places to look and dig. Why
not start with ex-employees?

Because "guestimating" the variables is so imprecise, I personally think that the ONLY
way to get a smoking gun on BABA is to have a "hidden camera type interview" similar to
the circumstances set up on Lumber Liquidators factory ops in China. Essentially, there
would be Chinese logistics/ops/accountants that would know the truth, if indeed they were
faking the numbers.

I've worked in the technology and e-commerce space for the last decade and follow
technology and architecture pretty closely. One thing that hasn't been covered in your
write-up is looking at the technology stack that would be necessary to support that many
transactions per second. 
 
At that scale there has to be a pretty significant data pipeline in place to move data
around, reconcile transactions, etc. One interesting line from Square is this: 
 
For every payment received there are "roughly 10 to 15 accounting entries required and
the reconciliation system must therefore scale at one order of magnitude above that of
processing, which already is very large.” 
 
http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/3/24/big-small-hot-or-cold-examples-of-robust-data-
pipelines-from.html 
 
At an engineering level having the skills and practical experience handling that kind of
volume at scale makes you part of a very, very select group with very, very high demand.
One thing that I'm surprised at is how little is known around their technology stack,
because, frankly, at that scale your infrastructure is custom-built. Meaning that you don't
go pick up a switch or router off the shelf from a major vendor but instead you build them
from parts. 
 
It is odd that I haven't seen any overview of their technology architecture leak given their
size and history. Given the amount of cross-pollination between engineering talent
between China and Silicon Valley I don't think its just a cultural barrier. There are some
articles but not as much as I would expect. Harder to find information on them than
Google which has been fairly good about keeping things close to the vest. 
 
Looking at metrics around the technology stack (bandwidth, servers, data centers, etc)
may give you some additional dimensions to compare against Amazon. Everybody has to
buy from Intel. 
 
http://www.alizila.com/fact-sheet-alicloud-alibaba-group%E2%80%99s-cloud-computing-
business 
 
Some other data points. 
 
For example, a record amount of traffic and transactions occurred on Nov. 11, 2014,
during Alibaba’s 11.11 Shopping Festival, which saw peak order creation volumes of
80,000 orders per second. 
 
To get 11.11 orders to homes in farflung cities in a matter of days instead of weeks, SF
Express, one of China’s leading shipping companies, will be flying 36 cargo aircraft
capable of hauling 1,800 tons of packages daily. 
 
Alipay said peak transaction-processing volume will reach 30,000 payments per second
this year, compared with 15,000 during 11.11 last year.

anything. 
 
On the other hand, the most likely explanation is that the merchants pre-package dozens
or hundreds of the "most likely to sell" items, such that all they have to do to fulfill the
orders is to stick on a shipping label. 
 
I would suggest that you do a contest: In exchange for a chance to win a RMB100 Alipay
gift card, ask people to send in their shipping information, such as the tracking number,
date ordered, etc. Then, correlate the numbers with other available information. . . 
 
Have fun with that!

Cannot help on the parcels, but in the online payment industry one transaction does not
necessarily count as one payment. Instead, a transaction is referred to as any exchange
of information on which a fee can be levied. So for example a real world credit card
transaction can easily translate in a bundle of 5+ transactions from a payment provider
perspective: check if credit card number exist, transmission of 3-digit security number,
transmission of name, expiry date, amount, actual payment, confirmation of payment
etc... - all depends on the fee model of the payment company. 
Don't know if this applies here, but it's a common reason for seemingly overstated
tranaction counts.

John - is a "delivery" in China the same as the USA? In the USA you could say it is very
much vertically integrated - Amazon staff process an order from "click buy" through to
picking/packing/consignment, then FedEx/etc staff process the package from
consignment through to the buyer's front door. There is only one break in the chain there.
Maybe there are multiple breaks in China? Or maybe the chain is a different length -
maybe they don't deliver to the buyer's front door? If their logistics chain is different, then
the number of staff employed by each organisation (Amazon/FedEx/etc equivalents) will
be different. 
 
To prove up your thesis, I suggest you trace how a "click buy" from say the top 8 Alibaba
retailers turns into a buyer unwrapping their parcel. It will either be vastly different to what
happens with Amazon, or Alibaba is going to explode.

Alipay is widely used for transactions outside of Alibaba. From the prospectus: "For the

marketplaces was settled through Alipay." 
 
If we take the 278m deliveries and assume each required 1 payment transaction (I'll
come back to this assumption later), then we'd have 278m Alipay transactions on
Alibaba. If we assume Alipay's 75% share of Alibaba’s GMV also applies to the # of
transactions, then Alipay accounted for 208.5m (278m X 75%) transactions on Alibaba.
Furthermore, if Alibaba accounts for 29.7% of Alipay's transactions, then Alipay may have
processed 702m (208.5m / 29.7%) transactions on Singles Day. But this 702m is well
below your 1.2b transactions estimate. (And further, the 702m is probably high, I'll come
back to this) 
 
I think your 7 hours of peak transactions significantly overstates the # of transactions.
There is huge volume at the very beginning of the day as customers try to take advantage
of limited quantity deals or time-expiring deals. (Think midnight crowds outside of Best
Buy on Black Friday) The peak # of transactions almost certainly occurs in the first few
minutes. 
 
On Singles Day, Alibaba and/or its employees post updates of the cumulative GMV for
the day. Alibaba reportedly generated 57.1b RMB of GMV on Singles Day. The #s I’ve
seen: 
- 1b RMB GMB in the first 2 minutes 
- 10b RMB GMV in the first 38 minutes 
- 20b RMB GMV by around 7am 
- 30b RMB by around 11am 
- 40b RMB by around 4pm 
- 50b RMB around 9pm 
- remaining 7.1b RMB of GMV was generated from 9pm to midnight 
 
This implies GMV per minute peaks in the first two minutes and then drops off
significantly (by more than 90%). On my calculations, GMV per minute was:  
- first two minutes: 500m RMB per minute 
- 12:02 to 12:38: 250m RMB / minute 
- 12:38 to 7am: 26m RMB / min 
- 7am to 11am: 42m RMB / min 
- 11am to 4pm: 33m RMB / min 
- 4pm to 9pm: 33m RMB / min 
- 9pm to midnight: 39m RMB / min 
 
A few further calculations: 
- if we assume the "peak" 2.85m Alipay transactions per minute applies to the first 38
minutes and then scale the number of transactions/minute in line with Alibaba's GMV per
minute, then on my calculations, Alipay processed 618m transactions 
 
- if I assume the "peak" 2.85m Alipay transactions per minute only applies to the first 2
minutes and then scale the # of transactions/minute in line with Alibaba's GMV per
minute, then on my calculations, Alipay processed 325m transactions 
 
Unfortunately the quote is unclear on what "peak of the event" applies to, but the range of
Alipay transactions could be 325-618m if “peak” refers to 1) the first 2 minutes; or 2) the
first 38 minutes 
 
Getting back to the 1 Alibaba delivery = 1 Alipay transaction assumption. If Alibaba
represents 29.7% of Alipay transactions (the actual statement is that Alibaba represents
29.7% of Alipay total payment volume, but let's assume payment volume per transaction
are similar on and off Alibaba), then the 325-618m Alipay transactions implies 96m to
183m Alibaba transactions.  
 
Why does this range not match the 278m deliveries number? My guess is that many of
the Alipay "transactions" on Alibaba represent a payment for a basket of items. This
basket can consist of items from different sellers on Alibaba's platform. As a result, 1
Alipay transaction could result in more than one delivery as each of the merchants would
arrange delivery to the same end customer. The 96m to 183m range for # of transactions
on Alibaba implies that the range of deliveries per transaction is between 1.2-2.9. In other
words, each order may consist of items from between 1.2 to 2.9 different sellers on
Alibaba.

Alibaba almost outsources all its logistics. I doubt they really own large warehouse coz
only a relatively new business, aka tmall grocery, carries inventory. In that sense, it's
more like ebay. Btw JD.com resembles Amazon much more. The online shopping
situation is a bit different from the experiences you might have in western countries where
a lot of brick and mortal stores have built their own websites. In China, online shopping is
more centralized on taobao, tmall, jd, and yihaodian. Tmall provides infrastructure for big
brands to open their online stores. 
 
Besides, Alipay is used more frequently than you might think. The scope of usage
includes payments in physical convenient stores, most cabs, local restaurants, movie
theaters etc. The offline usage is most likely limited within only large cities. Tenpay is a
formidable competitor.

John, 
 
I want to comment on just a specific part of your analysis - extrapolating the peak minute
trxns to the daily trxns. The figure refers to Singles Day, and there is more than a
reasonable chance that the 7-hour thumb rule cited by you may breakdown here, simply
because the peak just ends up being that much higher. Such high numbers can usual
disrupt the entire trxn distribution set for the day - consider this, by this rationale, the 278
mm trxns, already a feat beyond even Alibaba's expectations, would be achieved in a
bare 100 minutes or so.

I think above Anonymous commentator made excellent points. Although I'm frequently on
the shorting side of BABA, it mainly was because the growth should slow down
significantly. The golden time has already passed.  
 
Some personal experiences as a mainlander. Indeed Taobao and Alipay are used ten
times more frequent than one thinks, especially if he is from Europe or America. The
craziness of commercial real estate has driven most price sensitive purchases online,
including buying apartment, groceries, in-call massage (not the exotic), anything you can
think of. Alipay is ubiquitous. It connects almost all shopping malls, most restaurants,
college dinning halls, utilities, railway stations and taxi.  
 
Next on Alibaba's business model. Alibaba is not like Amazon, it doesn't do any of the
logistics. The business model is more selling traffic(ads, search results, promotions), data
services, payment processing, and infrastructure to mom-papa stores online, a light
capital service or internet companies. The model had a good time as online shopping
burgeon and a much larger market for almost all offline store owners. The flaw of the
model is essentially Alibaba is milking small business owner(sellers) to feed
customers(buyers). If someone successfully builds a brand on Alibaba, he is very likely
move out of it and build his own online storefront or maintain the storefront on Alibaba,
but not likely to put a lot marketing budget on it. Alibaba will still make a ton of money as
there is always people want to open business as long as Alibaba is a traffic hub. 
 
Third on the Singles event. It is almost certain on 11.11 you will get the lowest price
through the year. It works as Alibaba puts a set of strict pricing rules on sellers. So what's
reasonable for customers is they will make a lot more purchases on that day to get
guaranteed best price. For sellers, the huge traffic usually offsets the reduced margin.
This is observable by looking at monthly GMVs. 11.11 diverted a lot of GMV from October
and December. 
 
Fourth on US peers. I have lived in US for more than 5 years. I say Black Friday and
Cyber Monday have become more tradition than real discount festival. I wouldn't feel
surprised if all of sudden everyone ditches Black Friday shopping as a lot of retails don't
offer same discount as their Chinese peers.  
 
Some data crunching: 
1. 278 million orders, GMV is 57.1b RMB< so 205RMB/oder. It is not very outrageous if
you are told electronics are the most popular category.  
 
2. 278 million orders, 586 million packages for the whole industry. 2.1 package for each
order. Buyers usually have multiple items from different sellers.

3. All the packages are processed in about 7-10 days, peak is around 100 million
package. According to industry statistics, on average daily processing is 33.09 million
package. Only look at peak speed, 1.4 million employees in total for the delivery network,
on average each deliver 71 packages a day on peak. Not too ridiculous. 
 
4. Alipay's peak would probably last less than a few minutes, maybe is the processing
speed at first second. Above anonymous commentator's 600m transactions make more
sense. If we used that, average value per transaction is 57.1b/600m=95rmb or $15. Not
outrageous. 
 
5. Alipay has excellent infrastructure, but may not make a good comparison to Visa as
Alipay involves simpler transactions. When on 11.11, everyone has already beefed up
their Alipay wallet instead of routing through multiple banks/intermediaries like Visa
purchases. Even that, Alipay said goodbye to Oracle and migrated to OceanDB. If we
could look at more technical details of Oracle DB and OceanDB, we could have sneak
peak at Alipay's scale.

As many commentators have said before, using Amazon as the model is barking at the
wrong tree. BABA is a middle man who has perfected the OTO model. Pretty much all its
logistics is outsourced. 
 
As for the growth potential, we have about 1 billion mobile phone users in China today,
half of them being smart phone users, i.e. phones that can access the internet. There are
also between 150 and 200 million PC connected to the internet, so the figure of 650 to
700 million internet users makes sense. That leaves another 500 million mobile phone
users who will progressively convert to smart phones and also be able to access the
internet. Therefore, in 3 to 5 years from now, we should end up with more than 1 billion
internet users that will continue to boost BABA's GMV numbers even if BABA's market
share drops from 75% today to say 60% in 3 years time... Also all smart phone users do
not necessarily shop online yet. If of the 500 million smart phone users only half have
done one transaction online in the last 12 months, that leaves room for doubling the
number of transactions as more and more users do actually make one transaction online,
plus the doubling of users over time. I would not be surprised to see BABA's GMV at least
doubling over the next 3 years and perhaps even quadrupling over the next 5 years...
One trillion dollars in 5 year from now...

Keep it simple guys 
 
What’s important to note is that Alibaba’s platforms merely facilitate the transactions.
They manage the marketplace and charge a small commission, but don’t hold – or sell –
any merchandise themselves.(they dont make any shipping) 
 
EBAY doesn't this kind of business but Amazon doesn't 
 
Amazon has 2 retail business: 
1st party, they sell their own items and they make the shipping (inventory risk) 
3rd party, they sell 3rd party items but they make the shipping for them (no inventory risk) 
 
Yes they have expensive valuation (AMZN or BABA) but you have to understand the
business model before to extrapolate any numbers and searching frauds...

you think for instance that a substantial proportion of the transactions are low-value emoji
then the remaining transactions wind up with implausibly high average value. 
 
Spun this around for a bit in my head last night and would suggest that those numbers
become much more reasonable if Alibaba is in large part a trading rather than an
eCommerce platform. Component parts and commodities trading and hedging; financial
instruments and currency exchange; and gambling. 
 
Some Google searches turn up 'smoke':

Remember where it came from? 1688. 
So another profits center: 
A. I knew a lot of manufacturers paid 20K - 50K RMB consultancy fees/year to get
industry/trends reports from Ali. 
 
B. I knew a lot of small shop-owners must pay large amount of ads/promo fee to
Tmall/Taobao/1688.  
 
I didn't read the IPO specs or annual reports as I foresee there is no buying opportunity
so far, maybe in 2018. Need to check the latest annual report for A and B profits. 
 
The magic side of Ali is that they don't have to do physical logistics, and that's why it can
grow so fast. But this is the weakest point so far. JD is the same kind of Amazon.  
 
Alipay won't grow much in China, and it doesn't belong to Alibaba. The regulators had
laws to restrict it already. Possible it can extend to SE Asia or any emerging markets. 
 
The specialization shopping site will be the trend, and Taobao won't last long as the
consumers grow mature. Should compare profits from Taobao and Tmall (can last
longer). 
BTW, I heard that Ali won't take many new stuffs this year(from school career talk).

China is a very different economic environment. Unskilled and semi-skilled labor is
abundant and extremely cheap. Sophisticated automation equipment is expensive and
difficult to keep running in China. 
 
Businesses in China take a very different approach to peak capacity than a business like
Amazon. Nail shops, hair salons, real estate agencies, and restaurants will have a staff

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 22/35


sized for their physical infrastructure, which is their primary cost, e.g. a nail shop with 6
work stations will have a staff of 6 all day long (and often all night long) independent of
demand. The staff often lives upstairs and makes a very meager net wage. It is
interesting to watch how the staff transfers tasks to this business downtime. 
 
It is not directly relevant to your questions, but I find it very interesting to see how small
restaurants manage space, their largest expense. Many small restaurants put as much
space as possible into the dining area. Many will not have the space to operated the
kitchen and clean tableware at the same time, so at peak they will bus tables to the
sidewalk and substitute a large inventory of tableware for the space required to clean it,
which will happen at off-peak. And this is not in some rural province, you can see this in
central Shanghai. These are simply rational responses to different economic and
regulatory conditions. 
 
Logistics can be unbelievably different. Electric scooters are zipping around everywhere
with giant bundles of packages dubiously attached to the scooter for delivery. If you
spend some time at the loading dock of a commercial building there will be a never
ending stream of guys on scooters delivering packages. For larger deliveries, a well used
van might show up, often with the wife and young child in tow, and the ubiquitous folding
blue cart will come out of the van and a larger delivery will be made. And ever so
occasionally, a high cube might actually show up and back up to the dock for a very large
delivery. It is truly astounding how many people are employed in logistics. 
 
Indeed, the technology is very primitive. The sidewalks in front of the delivery services are
littered with packages. Trucks drive up and their contents are thrown out onto the
sidewalk. But keep in mind that China developed a nuclear capability not with fancy
electronic computers but with giant roomfulls of human computers with abacuses. What
would you do if fancy material handling systems were expensive and difficult to maintain
in your environment (and hence failure prone) and that unskilled or semi-skilled labor was
cheap and you have the economic power to get them to work 18 hour days at peak load? 
 
Your question about the possibility of the statistics is interesting, but to answer it well you
need to have a better understanding of how China actually operates. The implicit
assumption that Alibaba should (or must) operate like Amazon is flawed. And once you
understand how logistics works, I think you will find it (at least in principle) easy to
measure. 
 
The more interesting question of how much more this can grow requires even more
insight into the daily lives of ordinary Chinese consumers and how their demographics
and habits are evolving, and why. And right now whats driving that is mobile. And that
answers your question about Alipay.

Peak capacity: 
My understanding from my over 300+ purchases from Taobao is that none of them comes
from Alibaba itself. Marketplace is the dominant part. Also I experienced 11.11 inside
China in my previous job. At my office in Shenzhen, every floor's reception desks (we
took multiple floors of the building) were filled with packages from 11.11 orders until the
end of November. This is the major reason why capacity is not a good short thesis
because how Chinese accepts and are used to delays at times like this is unimagined in
western culture. Of course if you have an option to pay much less in Amazon, it still
makes sense to wait for a month for let's say, a gift you prepare for Christmas. 
 
Logistics: 
Merchants and logistics companies in China seldom make large capital investments in
order to save fixed costs. Wages for delivery boys in the rural areas are still remarkably
cheap. Try to quote for delivery from Zhongtong versus that of UPS you can see the price
difference is huge. (To be fair, Chinese "express courier" are no express)  
 
Taobao business: 
In my network I know very few shops actually use Tmall's full service solution
(warehouse, logistics, branding, site setup and monitoring) but many do pay for
advertising.  
So without looking at their 20-F I guess the main revenue for Taobao is therefore
advertising fees and transaction-based commissions. They created a market place where

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 23/35


hundreds of thousands of merchants compete for the 1st place in search. A search on
"torch" in Taobao returns 430k results while there were only around 6k at ebay. 
The fake goods story didn't hurt Alibaba much because buyers already know they are not
buying the same things from department stores. Buying stuff tagged with big names (e.g.
Samsung batteries, Prada wallet, Sealy mattress) from Taobao is a newbie move. For me
I rather buy local start-up brands that put emphasis on product specs and durability
(keywords are instead: "1000+ recharge cycles", "top layer full grain leather" and "high
carbon spring"). 10 years ago no China brand invested in quality because there was no
channel for end-customers review. Now they have and this is a big change for an average
person's life as the everyday products' quality improves. 
 
Alipay: 
To understand the stretch of Alipay let me introduce Dianping and Meituan, the largest
group deals sites in China. Think of them as Groupon and Yelp combined that, in my
opinion, has a better business model than otherwise separated because they encourage
repeated purchases. Using these apps to look for restaurants or services will return both
deals (immediately usable) and the customers' reviews which is pretty awesome to the
user. Alipay can be used to pay for purchases made in both apps. In fact most Chinese
apps and e-commerce sites use Alipay as payment solution. Some stores outside China
started to allow Alipay as a payment method. 
 
Overall: 
As a Hongkonger I have every reason to hate China. But for Alibaba, there isn't yet
another way for an average person to start their own shop and acquire customers as
easy as in Taobao. Even if Alibaba bloated the figures it's still a sound business.
Customer experience is absurd in China both in shops and in websites but they don't care
about it more than price and product, this is where Taobao comes in. 
Financial wise, I believe Jack Ma and his team are too damn smart to be hacked. I met a
guy at Tencent who is already much smarter than me, and he still wishes he could join
Alibaba. Think through how the business has been organized and expanded and you may
be convinced that it is not worth the effort to short it.

You said Alibaba was a combination of Amazon (retailer) and eBay (platform for retailers),
but then your comparison is only to Amazon. What if you assume Alibaba is 90% eBay
and 10% Amazon. You end up with huge numbers of transactions, but most don't require
much effort by Alibaba.

Alibaba has its own delivery network which it owns a stake in and provides software for.
That is well documented on their IR site.

This is actually quite timely as I was just in China speaking with a service provider that
offers logistic solutions for the likes of Alibaba, JD.com, Taobao etc (banking side).
Outsourcing is a very common theme in China and this occurs on multiple levels from
warehousing, management of warehousing, workers in warehousing, logistic trucking
companies and finally delivery person at your door. What I can confirm is this particular
service provider has grown exponentially to meet the demands from these online
retailers. The issue they are facing right now is they can’t expand fast enough to keep
pace with client demand (online retail sales growth vs. physical construction of logistics
infrastructure – acquiring land, government approvals, design, constructions). I can’t
disclose their numbers but suffice to say they are growing rapidly and so are their main
competitors in this market.

Lots of work have been put into this article 
 
But as an ex-CPA at Big 6 (then Big 5, 4..) I can not understand one thing.  
 
You ask: " So I asked: How would you test this."  
 
Why not order something yourself?  
 
If you take a look at www.aliexpress.com it can't be easier. 
Choose shops that look different, see what happens. 
And think through all the process along - how put smth into "shopping basket", how
purchases are grouped, presented, how shipping calculated, how paid .. how delivered.. 
 
Eg why for most goods "shipping is free" with China Post. And how this works out if the
goods cost only pennies anyway.  
 
See how the tracking works. how you get the number, how is the "progress" on tracking
websites.  
 
And - how the packages look like when you get them!  
 
I can confirm, they ABSOLUTELY look nothing like from Amazon. Never ever.  
 
Never have I received anything from Amazon that is wrapped in an old chinese
newspaper! (that was a bag of tea) 
 
And - when you actually receive the goods from mail, you have to log in and confirm
receipt.  
 
ONLY AFTER THAT the funds are transferred to the poor merchant who is trying his-her
best in English, in some small (million-inhabitant) town, the name of which most people
have never heard of.  
 
Shipping overseas can take up to 60 days! Who has all the money until then? Good
question. a simple multiplication excercise. And do all payment transactions have to be at
the very millisecond the pay button is clicked? If you order you'll see they are "being
verified" sometimes for days, and that's off peak period.  
 
 
And eg if you look at feedback people leave, you'll see other interesting facts, that
Russian is the second language for commenting on goods.. and they often recently
comment that goods are received in less than a week.  
 
 
Conclusion - good fieldwork is what is missing from this otherwise great article! 
 
just my 5 c

My average order from aliexpress is <10 USD.

Very interesting read. On the Alipay peak transaction volume subject, I think you are way
overestimating the length of peak time. 7 hours of relatively stable peak time may be
reasonable on a normal day, but on a fanatic sales day like the Singles Day, peak time is
shortened to a much shorter period of time. Read again what the article said: "At the peak

of the event, 2.85 million transactions were processed every minute by Alipay." So if
Alibaba had 5.7 million transactions in two minutes, that statement is technically true. And
having 5.7 million transactions in two minutes is very different from having 1.2 billion
transactions in 7 hours, which I agree with you is outrageous. The analogy here would be
on Black Fridays here in the US, many stores like Walmart or Best Buy open at midnight
and you have people camp out and wait in line. So shortly after midnight - maybe 12:10 -
12:15, you will have a peak transaction volume as all those people start to check out. The
same thing happens on Taobao/Tmall on Singles Day: many sales events start on a
specific time, let's say 9 pm. So it's not unrealistic that you have a massive of transactions
concentrated in the two minutes from 9:01 to 9:03.  
 
Would like to hear your thoughts on this.

Harrison said...


This is much easier to solve than many are making out to be. 
 
Having lived in China for 4 years, everything people are saying about Alibaba being a
platform that facilitates transactions rather than an inventory-focused Amazon-like retailer
is correct. They say that their top 14 strategic partners employ 1.4mm employees and
that is only the top 14. If UPS has almost half a million employees, it is easy to see how
the entire Chinese logistics industry has triple or quadruple that number. It is important to
take into account that Chinese labor has historically been so low cost that automation is
generally much lower in all industries and so there is significantly more labor used in
logistics/distribution than you would see in developed countries, which is exemplified by
the picture you posted making the system seem so radically unsophisticated...that's
because it is! 
 
The key piece to verifying the puzzle you pose about Alipay/Alibaba is in this Worldpay
press release: http://www.worldpay.com/sites/default/files/china-singles-day-2014-
spending-soars.pdf 
 
In it they state a few key stats that can help us put the entire picture together, assuming
Worldpay (which is about to go public) isn't lying. They say that their average user made
5.3 purchases on Singles Day and spent an average of 95 pounds in total. Their number
of transactions increased 455% versus their average day. 
 
First, if there were 278mm Singles Day deliveries and each user purchased an average of
5.3 items, that gets us to 52.5mm shoppers on Alibaba's platforms on that day. In other
words, only 8.1% of Chinese internet users and 3.8% of the total Chinese population
used Alibaba on Singles Day. Not exactly a staggeringly high number. If you think the
Chinese internet will expand to penetration rates much higher than today (very likely),
then it isn't unlikely that you could see 6-7% of the entire population using the platform. I
don't think anyone would call this a stretch. So the answer to the question 'how much can
Alibaba grow?'is 'by multiples of its current revenues and earnings but probably not by 5x-
10x'. One thing people miss out on when thinking about Chinese internet growth is that
China never had a well developed retail industry and the people did not have bricks-and-
mortar shopping habits developed over decades. In many ways, China skipped this step
and jumped straight into internet retail as its period of rapid growth started after the rise of
internet infrastructure. Many people assume China's internet population has the same
growth characteristics as the US with added growth because of the emerging market
aspect, but this simply isn't true. 
 
Second, Alipay averages 80mm transactions per day. Assuming that increased by the
455% that Worldpay cited, you get to 364mm transactions. That is an average of 252,778
per minute. The peak transaction volume was 2.85mm, or 11.3x the average, which
doesn't seem crazy. I'm sure that at 11:11 AM/PM they do some additional aggressive
discounting making volume spike to that level in a very concentrated time period, so it
isn't as simple as multiplying 2.85m x 60 x 4 or 6.

cacophony said...


Third, we can further triangulate Alibaba's numbers through the Worldpay press release
by using sales numbers. Sales were $9bn for Alibaba on Singles Day. With 364mm
transactions, that equates to $24.73/transaction. The average user purchased 5.3 items
and therefore spent ~$131 per person. In GBP terms (using Singles Day's USD/GBP
exchange rate), users spent an average total of 82.32 pounds versus Worldpay's
reported 95 pounds per user. Alternatively, you could say that $9bn in sales divided by

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 26/35


278mm singles day deliveries is $32.37 per transaction, not too dramatically far off from
the $24.73 cited above and equal to 107.78 pounds total per person. 
 
These numbers tie together too well and make the premise that Alibaba is fabricating its
numbers unlikely. There are additional complications for Alibaba itself in its vendors
sending false information as many people noted here as well. 
 
Just to be clear, I'm not an investor and wouldn't ever invest in such a company with
exactly zero shareholder protections and terrible corporate governance. This is the real
issue and not the scalability of the company, how big it can get, and whether or not they
are exaggerating their numbers.

Three ways to back-check Alibaba's numbers: 
1. Do Alibaba's sales each quarter change as if they are influenced by the Chinese retail
economy as a whole? 
2. Are Taobao and Tmall noticeable in their sales data (and maybe they're still too small
to matter)? 
3. Pick a few representative locations (urban, rural, etc...) and monitor deliveries on a
"Regular" day, vs. the normal shipping time lag after singles day. Alternatively,
interview/poll a sample of their shoppers and vendors and see if the numbers are in the
ballpark with Alibaba's numbers. 
 
Three reasons not to expect 500% growth: 
1. Competition is increasing for them, not decreasing. There is no monopoly model, other
than size efficiencies and convenience related to Alipay. 
2. Their network effects appear limited to primarily China. As China develops and labor
becomes more expensive, making many of Alibaba's goods relatively more expensive,
what is their strategy for expanding to other countries in terms of the sellers? Do they
make more money from having more sellers, or having more buyers? 
3. The Chinese economy is already overheatedly inefficient from malinvestment and more
correction is coming. 
 
Three reasons to expect 500% growth: 
1. As China develops, more internet users and more disposable cash. Still plenty of
population to get online and start selling/shopping, although maybe not 5x enough. 
2. Even with corrections and slowdown, long-term China still has a lot of room for catch-
up growth. 
3. Alibaba over time, while still sourcing in China, will sell internationally, tapping much
larger purchasing pools. This requires shipping/customs changes for them, but it's within
the realm of possibility,especially with free trade movements and their ability to contract to
outside delivery providers. 
 
Some of the above aren't as easy to test as they are to get opinions on. I lean towards
the not-500% model myself, primarily for competition and economic reasons, which may
not be fast enough to sustain a short position.

difference between Western and Asian ways of looking at things. 
 
Consideration 1: Transactions... what is THEIR definition of a transaction? Most of the
numbers probably came from the hundreds of millions of users of Alipay. Alipay needs to
be looked at vs a significant % of the sum (Visa + MC + Amex + PayPal + Apple Pay +
ATM purchases). Add to this the three main B to C shopping sites (Tmall, Taobao and
Juhuasuan) a transaction could include the number of clicks vs number of sales
completed.  
 
Consideration 2: Received and Shipped. Given 1,000,000 orders received and 200,000
shipped yields 1,200,000 received and shipped. Step 2 of that 1M received, say on Tmall,
700,000 were transacted through Alipay that is another 700K received and 700K shipped
(completed). As such the 200,000 physical shipments could be reported as 2.6M receipts
and shipments. 
 
Consideration 3: Are the employment numbers only for the group HQ level or do they
include all of the sub business? 
 
Bottom line is like any business start with the money and follow it. 
 
Alibaba.com is B2B there are reportedly 100's of thousands of sellers paying a,
guesstimate, of 0-$10k annually for membership and add ons. That is Alibaba group
revenue source from that entity. 
 
B2C sites - Don't try to compare to Amazon as you would be trying to compare to
Amazon Prime not normal Amazon where you are buying directly from the seller who
does the fulfillment. eBay is closer so you look at what % do the Alibaba sites make per
transaction? 5-10%? What is the transaction value for the three shopping entities?  
 
Alipay - There are no fees to the user but what are the transaction fees? 3%? so again
need to come up with what is their annual transaction rate and that is this revenue
stream.  
 
Does the sum of that make a real business? Probably, but, as you are obviously doing,
you need to check the facts to understand what is really going on. 
 
Good luck!

Of course, it is most desirable to collect granular facts, that are possible to gather, and
then to see if they fly in the face of Alibaba's claims. 
 
But given the level of dominance suggested by the reported figures, some questions
come to my mind: 
- what makes Alibaba dominate the Chinese market in such a dramatic manner (if Alibaba
is more like eBay, may be first mover advantage got them their dramatic dominance, but if
they are sufficiently like Amazon, then I wonder what their claim to dominance is) 
- worth studying the number two in the industry - how large, growing faster or slower than
Alibaba, comparing metrics 
- Comparing them to Flipkart and Amazon in India might be interesting too.  
- Both Flipkart and Amazon are market place models (quite like Alibaba it appears) but
both of them seem to believe that they need to do at least a part of the
warehousing/sorting themselves (Fulfilled by Amazon style). Hard to fake those numbers
- in an outsourced model, it is easier to claim that your amorphous army is omnipresent. 
- And it is not clear as to who the winner will be. There are others beyond Flipkart and
Amazon and those others are still fighting to be the eventual winners.  
- So what is so different about China's market that lends itself to extreme dominance by
one company in an otherwise incredibly competitive space

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 28/35


This is a great example of an analyst who has gone through tons of information but still
has no idea what he is talking about because he has never personally assessed the
situation. Here are his fatally flawed assumptions. 
 
1) Purchasing Behavior on Taobao is similar to Amazon. 
In the USA, Amazon is used for deals, gifts, and unique purchases. However US
consumers would never think of purchasing mundane items like napkins, toilet paper, or
cheap items unless they are in bulk. The shipping costs just offsets the costs and people
want it now, not next week. 
In China, people buy EVERYTHING on Taobao. Everything. Even all of these cheap
commodity items can be bought on Taobao. The reason they buy it on Taobao is because
its frequently cheaper than the store, there is wider selection online, shipping is fast
(usually within 3 days), and frequently shipping is free or really cheap. Everything is in
place to make online shopping for everyday products economical for everyone. 
 
2) Taobao holds inventory and fulfills orders like Amazon. 
This is just not the case. While Taobao does offer fulfillment, it is largely a marketplace.
They don't require the large logistics network that Amazon does. 
 
3) Delivery companies in China operate similarly to those in the USA. 
When I read this article and they start estimating the number of delivery trucks needed by
the Chinese logistics suppliers, I just laugh to myself. I don't think it's even on the authors
radar that electric bikes exist, much less how much you can fit on a single bike. Yes, they
have trucks, but they just haul stuff between distribution points. The actual delivery
happens on deliveries bikes which anyone who has even vacationed through China for a
few days has certainly seen. One bike could be packed to carry 50-70 packages for just
as many customers. Also the delivery bikes don't get caught up in traffic like trucks do,
stop lights are optional, and they can pull up to the very door of the building and park
unlike any automobiles can. 
 
So to boil this down to metrics, the key differences between US and China based delivery
companies is 1) population density 2) delivery efficiency (i.e. number of packages that
can be delivered by 1 employee per hour) 3) the volume of parcels and 4) the overhead.
For Chinese companies, the first three metrics (pop density, delivery efficiency, volume) is
much higher in China while the overhead is much lower. This is a HUGE oversight in this
article. 
 
4) Only consumers are purchasing online 
A HUGE mistake this guy makes is assuming that all of Tabao's orders are B2C when
there is a ton of B2B. In reality, almost all of the small and medium businesses purchase
a large amount of supplies and products online. Taobao offers a much wider selection at
better prices than can be had through wholesalers and representatives. The amount of
B2B purchases on Taobao is MASSIVE. 
 
Are the numbers 100% accurate? I don't know, but there are so many holes in his
comparisons that you could drive a truck through. He just doesn't understand the China
market.

Bedford's Law (Law of first Digits)  
Consider looking at the numbers (financial statements) with Benford's Law. (Wikipedia is
a great starting explanation).... 
 
In short, in natural systems, 1 is the first digit 30.1% of the time; 2 is first 17.6%;.... 9 is
first 4.6% of the time.  
 
In places where people are cooking the books they typically fail to cook them properly.
(That is to say there are too many made up numbers starting with 7, 8 or 9.) This can be
used to check for "areas of interest" in expense reporting. This has been proven to work
in company Financial Statements or in elections results in third world countries.
(populations of people are natural and the dictator faking results has two make election
numbers starting with 7,8,or 9 and not enough starting with 1.) One of the advantages to
this is that it can be very fast, but all data is not natural.

$9 billion in 278 million orders equates to about $30 per order. Others have pointed out
that orders are not fulfilled by Alibaba. It is also likely that some of the purchases are
online books, music, computer games, and videos so there is no physical delivery. Maybe
online purchase of travel tickets? With a $30 average, the odds are that the average
package size is small and the physical package count is much less than 278 Million -
regardless of who is delivering. 
 
That said - China is still a poor country, I suggest that the limit of self indulgent purchases
for Singles Day is going to be about double the current $9 Billion - and then only when
incomes double. 
 
It might still be a fraud. 278 Million is a lot of orders in one day for one portal.

The authors/interviewer has good questions, but is short of both business model of
Albaba and qualitative skills, plus lack of time for quantitative calculations. I am sorry for
being blunt: 
 
1) Albaba business model does not include giant own warehouse and not hire many
delivery staffs, because it is a flea market where millions of sellers arrange delviery with
buyers. It has 1.4 M people as its delviery partners across China. 
 
2) Quantitatively, based on the data the interviewer provided in the article, we can see: 
 
a) the annual average of deliveries/staff/day (if all staff participate in delviery and working
300 days/yr) is over 35 for UPS and below 21 for Albaba delviery partners). Given UPS
have likely higher percentage of overhead and less working days than Chinese couriers,
the effecieincy of UPS is even more superior than Albaba's partners. This outcome
defeats the author's statement.  
 
b) the peak handling capacity per day per handler is 462 for Amazon and less than 200
for Albaba partners. In fact, Albaba partners often have delay on Single Day which further
decrease their delivery number per staff on the peak day.  
 
c) For the payment transactions, the author's assumption of 7 hours of leads to average
transaction during Single Day is less than 662,000 per min vs. 840,000 for VISA, if the

Single Day lasted only 7 hours. The 2.85 million per min is likely a very short period and
irrelevent to his argument. 
 
d) additionally from BBC data, order size is less than $34 each (RMB200). Given report of
the average spending that day per user is over RMB1,000/person, ach user likely have 4-
5 deliveries,which makes the participatants of the Single Day is less than 12% of Albaba
users. It sound reasonable but the author may not know it.  
 
Albaba data actually looks rational (I am not saying true or false). Albaba is not
quantittively as efficient as Amazon, UPS or VISA, but its business model have mades it
successful in money-making. 
 
For interviewees, you neeed to decide if it is poltically wise to state so blunt as me or on
the oposite sides even work for this interviewer.

Hi John, 
Here is a logistics angle which you can explore: 
Alibaba's partners have 100,000 stations which deliver 8600 MM packages in a year. This
translates to 230 packages per delivery station on normal days. Have excluded Single's
day. 
 
230 seems to be a very low number per delivery station. One lady (from your example)
could pack 230 orders in about 4 hours. 
 
For Single's day, to maintain the same delivery schedule, assuming enough spare
capacity in the delivery stations, each delivery station would have to clear 2800 packages
in a day. In absence of spare capacity, the delivery schedule would have to increase. 
 
So 12 shifts (2800/230) are required to clear the packages. This means 12 times the
present workers are need to work. 
 
Alternately, the delivery schedule would increase to 12 times. Assuming current schedule
of 3 days, this would increase delivery schedule go 36 days which is unacceptable from a
customer's standpoint. 
 
Let's assume a hybrid. Delivery stations run at 75% capacity (space to store goods). So
each delivery station could store 288 packages in a day. If this cleared at 4 times the
average rate. It would come to 1150 packages a day. This would increase delivery time to
7.3 days from 3 days. 
 
This looks like an acceptable number. This is assuming all sellers have the required
inventory in place. If that is not the case, this would further increase delivery schedule.

Lots of discussion on Baba GMV here. The main points I'd make or emphasize are: 
 
- Per SEC filings, much of Alibaba's "GMV" is settled outside the platform. They refused
to disclose the amounts. The site operates much more like a Craig's List or Yellow Pages.
Unfortunately, it sports an Amazon valuation. 
 
- The bulk of the transaction value is not "retail". It's comprised of financial products,
industrial goods, real estate and distressed assets.

A very significant part of GMV comes from tier 1 and tier 2 cities. These are VERY
densely packed places. Rural is growing, but off a small base. E-commerce is still mostly
a big city phenomenon, despite articles you see now about rural growth. 
 
Often, entire tower blocks will have a delivery center where people can go pick up
packages. I'm talking about a tower block that might have 2000 people, with one delivery
point. You do not see that in the U.S., outside of maybe NYC. 
 
Packages are delivered often on ridiculously overloaded electric bikes or scooters
(purposely modified to be delivery vehicles). These are much cheaper and nimbler than
trucks. 
 
I think the comparison to UPS/FDX is misplaced. Although the DCs might be significantly
less efficient than U.S. comps, the actual last mile may be significantly more efficient. 
 
I've read that Alibaba's delivery network has more than 1.5 million employees. That
seems logical and about right.

To confirm the #s, simply do 200 surveys of consumers within China: 
 
1. How many items per week do you order online? 
2. How many items per week do you order from Alibaba? 
3. How many items are delivered (physically) versus delivered digitally (books, music,
etc.)? 
4. How long does it normally take for the physically shipped items to arrive? 
4. Please answer the same 4 questions, except for Singles Day only? 
 
Or you can simply use deductive reasoning, as follows: 
 
1. People who have something to gain financially from cheating will be tempted to do so. 
2. People who are tempted to do so will normally be stopped by potential sanctions
applicable to cheaters who are caught. 
3. In China, there are very few sanctions for cheaters who are politically or otherwise
connected. 
4. If a cheater is basically immune from sanctions for cheating, he will almost certainly
cheat. 
5. Alibaba is politically and otherwise connected in China to the elites; Alibaba also will
gain financially from cheating (higher stock price). 
6. Alibaba will almost certainly cheat.

I suggest you to read more about the business mode of Taobao (and Tmall). Because
obviously you know nothing about it other than "an online shop". The biggest problem
with your analysis, as pointed by many before, is that they don't process any parcel.
Someone asked if Taobao is eBay+Amazon, then how big is the eBay part? Well from the
logistic perspective, it is 100%. Taobao(Tmall) is basically a platform, on which people (or
companies) open their own shops and sell, pack and ship their goods. And you must
experience Chinese logistic today. There are more than 1,500,000 people in the field, and
they are using tricycles to deliver (Nevertheless there are still complains that they
received their item after a month of Singles day). Go to a Chinese university (in a bigger
city especially) and see how the "express" work. I think one or two tricycles would deliver
more in an afternoon there than a UPS truck in a whole day. The universities may be an

extreme example (where young students are gathered the most) yet just bear in your
mind how dense are the cities in China are (and how many people there in total).
Therefore logistic can be far more efficient, in term of number of parcels delivered. 
Hire a Chinese student and let her/him guide you through Taobao and explain how
Taobao works. (Consider to hire me! ;p) 
And just one more point how you can make mistakes while trying to understand others by
your imagination. "On Singles Day you go out and try to find a beloved", you mentioned.
Yet today in Chinese internet culture... No sir. It's a day for you to cry alone in your home.
Or at most go out celebrate your single status (with your friends). Your interpretation is
truly FRESH to me, to everyone in China I guess.

I do not think alibaba make up the numbers, rather it is the way of how consumers using it
that distort the actual reality. Eg sellers in taobao is famous for their 刷单 activity to push
up the sale and get good comment on their products, to and fro, build up the transaction
numbers.  
 
Cainiao smart logistic is getting bigger and better, huge demand will drive innovation to
the point that they will beat amazon in logistic very soon, the picture that you are relying
on was small scale delivery point, try to search the big one, you can see the differences.
Rather than relying on western media, better to have a on the ground approach to china
to know what is it like. Two things you had get it wrongly, first anglo superiority mentality,
ecommerce is one of the sectors china outperform the west in clear advantage, you used
too much of western company as standard indicator when a lot of them is already on the
losing sides. Alipay is used in many daily routine transaction eg vending machine,
payment for bills, payment for offline purchase in shops, normal lunch payment and many
more. It reach a point where mobile phone tied with alipay app is the wallet for ordianry
chinese in china. Paypal or visa has a lot to learn from it, which explain why you fail to
understand because you are using western standard, when alipay is future standard for
the west.  
 
Secondly, alibaba is not just a ecommerce company, they are in fact more than that and
will be even more in years down the road. I wouldnt waste much time on illustrating, as it
all reports in chinese media, go read it yourself, Alibaba is innovative in finance,

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Job interview questions: The size and scope of Alibaba


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/09/job-interview-questions-size-and-scope.html 33/35


travelling, entertainment, health, logistic etc. some of them still beginning but the way they
approach to new industry with new way to do things, it really make me wonder how big
they can become, even if some business eventually failed like 11main.com, their
innovation spirit is something western company can learn from. If you think ecommerce,
alibaba had hit limits in china, think again, they are with seller and manufacturer sides,
unlike amazon with buyers sides, enemy with sellers and unrelated with manufacturers.
Alibaba can reach globally with their vast amount of sellers selling all kind of things that
amazon wouldnt even sell. They are in fact in a path to be more successful than amazon
in exploring global market, at the same time building up buyers satisfaction. China
ecommerce is not whats alibaba aiming for, global market is their aim, if you take that in
mind, you will know that the number reported this year will be small in comparison if they
successfully going global. 
 
Extra points to add, to balance your view, some direct report from chinese media is one of
the sources to rely on. I always find that western always lag or not reporting whats going
on in china, making western investors in blind on the reality. Same logic applies, If you
are investing in japan market, japanese linguistic skill in your employee is crucial. Hope it
helps.

If everything turn out to be ok, no accounting issues, alibaba will be something amazon,
ebay, paypal, visa, master need to learn from. I cant believe those elite companies turn
out to find themselves living in stone age.

Alibaba processed $14 billion over 460 million packages. I saw the mailing system, the
images, are you kidding me? I don't believe it. Why don't we have cameras from the
mailing place and trucks comming out of the distribution system, then we will know if this
is true. Honestly, it logistically impossible. Or have jack ma, show the alipay credit
statement which would be verified by a real US auditor, then I will believe. Plus, baba still
sells alot of fakes and he said his company is going after them, yeah ok.

These are the same people who built the Great Wall of China, without robots. And btw, I
have used Paypal at 3:00 AM. And btw II, I read that Jack Ma employs 2,000 persons just
looking for counterfeit goods.

Louisville attorneys warn of unintentionally buying, selling counterfeit goods

LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) – A Bullitt County man was indicted on federal charges after he
bought counterfeit bike helmets online and sold them on eBay. But his attorneys said their
client did not know the goods he was purchasing off a wholesale site were counterfeit.  
 
Matthew Stepp is being charged with seven counts of mail fraud and two more counts of
trafficking counterfeit goods. His attorneys, Jimmy Nicholson and Greg Troutman, said
Stepp bought Giro Aeon Specialized and Catlike bicycle helmets off of the websites
Alibaba.com and AliExpress. 
 
Both websites are part of the Alibaba Group, according to the company’s website, they
are a global e-commerce site that sells a variety of items at wholesale from
manufacturers across the world. 
 
  
[MORE: Couple faces judge in connection to 3-year-old's death] 
 
“They sell a myriad of goods and the come represented as genuine so when you buy
them you are led to believe they are legitimate,” Troutman said.  
 
Nicholson and Troutman said the websites are to blame for the federal charges, and
Stepp has been under the impression he has been purchasing legitimate goods from the
website.

“No one ever indicated these helmets we're anything but authentic,” Nicholson said.  
 
Stepp’s attorneys said in November of 2014, his home was raided by US Customs and
Border Patrol and officials seized the helmets. 
 
Punishment for the charges could mean up to 20 years in prison. Instead, Nicholson and
Troutman are placing blame on the site that sold Stepp the bike helmets in the first place.  
 
“Alibaba and AliExpress should really be prosecuted,” Nicholson said. 
 
If it turns out the goods are counterfeit as stated in the federal indictment, Stepp’s
attorneys will argue he did not know the goods were counterfeit.  
 
“How do we know the suit I’m wearing or the Cole Hahn shoes that I’m wearing are
legitimate and not knock offs? That’s the issue here,” Troutman said. “The prosecution
has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt he knew that what he was selling
was counterfeit. If it takes an expert to figure out whether the goods or real or fake how is
the average person supposed to know that?” 
 
Now they are warning other buyers and sellers to be cautious of these wholesale sites. 
 
“The buyers and the sellers both need to be aware of what they're getting,” Troutman
said.  
 
Stepp and his attorneys have filed a civil suit against Alibaba and AliExpress. WAVE 3
News reached out to the company for comment but did not hear back as of Thursday
evening. 
 
Stepp is scheduled to appea

There has always been lots of "I Love Alibaba" rhetoric out there. I understand, I get it.
Alibaba is ubiquitous, everyone in China uses it. It's everywhere. It's a "beloved"
company. The concept is GREAT! Conceded. My concern has always been about
shareholder value and transparency. Unfortunately, Alibaba has neither. What's the real
value of this stock? People are beginning to catch on. I've posted a Video Clip from
CNBC, Pacific Square's Herb Greenberg saying the same things I've been saying for
more than a year on my blog. 
 
http://deep-throat-ipo.blogspot.com/ 
 
I especially liked Herb's characterization of Alibaba's financials as "a wet, tangled, ball of
yarn". Again, it's all in the filings, all we have to do is read them.

Sure, you the author wouldn't qualify for the entry level job after posting this post. 
 
You aren't familiar with Walmart, (big box stores) pre-automation days. Read up on that
material and books. 
 
Do you know how many ten of thousands of goog, msft employees are unlisted because
they are contract, part time? Did you know, of the campuses overseas that goog owns
and operates under various company names, that perform the back end work for goog
main products? No. You don't know much apparently. Warren Buffet sits at his desk and
never visits his investments. You are far from a Warren Buffet. All other investors go to
plants, sites, buildings first hand before making such large blank statements.

Jack, good to hear from you again! Well thought out, measured and researched
commentary as always. Don't get so upset though, you've had a good run. But, we're
onto you. Luckily, if you stay in China you'll be insulated from US prosecution. The SEC
can't/won't extradite. The truth will set you free. Hallelujah!

John, BABA's share price has almost doubled since you put out this post two years ago.
Maybe it's time to do a follow-up. 
 
You'd probably agree that BABA's sheer size shocks people, which naturally leads to
doubts about the validity of its reported numbers. If I were you, I'd reexam what
promopted me to think there is any comparability between the Single Day package
number and Amazon's total number of accounts. Investors' home bias?  
 
In contract, the market seems to give Amazon a free pass. The market is fine with AMZN
not disclosing readily available operating stats such as number of accounts and pacakge
volume. Why don't AMZN share information on the profitability of its Prime members as a
cohort? No one questioned why a company constantly touting its cash generation ability
had to raise 100% of the purchase price in debt to acquire a company 3% of its size?
