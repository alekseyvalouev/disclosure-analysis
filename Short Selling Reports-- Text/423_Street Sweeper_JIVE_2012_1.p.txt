Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings?
May 4, 2012 8:35 AM ET1 comment
by: The Street Sweeper


Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) may look incredibly hip right now, as a standout performer
in the popular social media space, but the company largely owes a short-term "sympathy
rally" - trumpeted by a suspicious firm that placed a bet on its stock - for its superstar
status.


After debuting as a hot new Internet play last December, when it jumped 25% at the
opening bell, Jive soon lost its early sizzle and spent more than a month simply trying to
hold onto its original gains. That pattern continued until early February, when Facebook
registered for its initial public offering and set off an explosion that ignited even long-shot
players in the field. Jive itself finally caught on fire at that point, a notorious stock promoter
loudly broadcasting its outsized gains, and spent two full months on a flight due north that
took its stock all the way from $15 to $28 a share.


Jive executives now look incredibly rich as a result. They control almost a third of those
high flying shares, records indicate, with the two young cofounders - who established Jive
while in their early 20s (before Facebook revolutionized the entire industry) - boasting a
combined net worth of more than $300 million all by themselves.


Since introducing its "Jive Engage" social networking platform to the business world five
years ago, however, the company itself has yet to earn a dime.


"Apparently, there is inherent value in any software company that has the word 'social'
included in their business summary," a Motley Fool contributor marveled back when Jive
first escaped from the powerful forces of gravity. "But what has changed?
(NYSEARCA:AND) what will happen once the FB hysteria settles down?"


If recent history serves as any guide, the answer could prove quite scary. The most
notorious high flier in that breathless rally, heavily promoted BroadVision
(NASDAQ:BVSN) has already catered multiple times since it peaked above $55 in early
March and now trades at barely half the price that it commanded two months ago.
Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) sparked a similar chain of events before it went public, too,
launching overheated "sympathy plays" that soon fizzled out and have since landed near
the bottom of their all-time trading range. Even Groupon itself, the star attraction of that

5/22/2018 Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560071-jive-software-a-social-butterfly-with-borrowed-wings 2/9


big production, soon lost its early shine and followed up with such a dismal performance
that the early $30 high flier now fetches barely one-third of its peak price and hovers less
than $1 above single-digit territory.


Based on its hefty $1.48 billion market value, Jive may look like an accomplished
powerhouse with enough strength to weather a potential storm. In reality, however, Jive
remains the same vulnerable company that languished around $14 a share - barely half its
recent high - just three short months ago: a bleeding Internet player with expanding
revenues but no earnings anywhere in sight.


At this point, in fact, Jive has still yet to achieve the key milestones credited to the
company before it even went public last year. When Forbes introduced Jive as a sexy IPO
candidate last summer, following discussions with its senior management team, the
magazine indicated that the company enjoyed a measure of financial strength that
remains lacking to this very day.


"Jive has passed a $100 million revenue run rate, according to people familiar with the
company," Forbes stated at the time. And "the company says it has been profitable since
day one."


That glowing review soon looked like outright fantasy, however, actually rivaling the
exaggerated hype that has followed since that time. When Jive filed for its IPO a few
weeks later, it supplied official financial statements that exposed the true condition of the
company.


Jive did not respond to questions for this story.


Blood Stains


For starters, as The Wall Street Journal quickly emphasized, Jive generated sales that
were "significantly less than the roughly $100 million often seen these days as a
benchmark for technology companies ready to go public." Jive had instead mustered
revenue of just $34 million during the first half of 2011, corporate filings show, and would
go on to report total sales of $77 million - about 25% shy of the levels suggested earlier -
for the entire year.


Far worse, of course, Jive had yet to show a profit on its books at all. The company had
instead spent five straight years losing money, its corporate filings now reveal, with its total
deficit set to balloon past $100 million (following a $50 million loss in 2011) by the time the
current year came to an end.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560071-jive-software-a-social-butterfly-with-borrowed-wings 3/9


Warning that this trend would likely continue for the "foreseeable future," Jive originally
pegged its own value at just $8 to $10 a share. Although Jive hit the market as a $15 high
flier, the stock soon found an early ceiling at $17 a share -- $11 below its recent high - and
then stalled out in the mid-teens after that time.


Even after a month-long slide that has dragged the stock below $24 a share, Jive still
looks wildly overvalued when compared to the rest of its peer group. Jive currently trades
at almost 19 times its prior-year sales, records show, in a booming software technology
sector that trades at barely three times its recent sales instead.


In other words, that multiple reveals, investors are paying the equivalent of $19 for every
$1 in sales reported by the company last year. They're paying a high price for future sales
as well, records indicate, by effectively spending $13 for every $1 in revenue anticipated
from Jive this year and almost $10 for each $1 in revenue expected from the company the
year after that.


Market bears have placed sizable bets against Jive in the meantime. Early this year, when
the lockup period still remained a distant threat, short sellers limited their trading in the
stock. Over the course of the past two months, however, they have rushed to borrow and
sell a huge number of Jive shares that they expect to repurchase at much lower prices
and then bank the difference as a tidy profit.


By mid-April, records show, they had sold a whopping 2.5 million shares of the stock short
-- more than double the number they had sold just six weeks earlier -- in a bold display of
their growing confidence. With a full 10% of its available stock shorted at that point, Jive
featured a far higher short interest than two better-known bear targets in the social media
sector - fellow newcomers Groupon and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) - that have since tanked
and now trade around their all-time lows.


For now, at least, Jive still stands out from the crowd. While the stock has taken a 15%
haircut over the course of the past month, it still remains at the high end of its overall
trading range.


Wall Street research houses actually viewed Jive as richly valued before it shot toward the
moon, records indicate, with several of them launching coverage of the stock with cautious
neutral ratings as a result. At first, they set target prices well below recent levels and -
clearly blindsided by the powerful advances that would follow - only later raised their
targets in order to reflect those enormous gains.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560071-jive-software-a-social-butterfly-with-borrowed-wings 4/9


Take UBS, for example, one of the underwriters that brought Jive to the market in the first
place. In late January, about two weeks before Jive even launched its breathtaking rally,
UBS analyst Brent Thill initiated coverage of the stock with a lukewarm neutral rating due
entirely to the high price of its shares.


Although he acknowledged several other risks, clearly legitimate in their own right, Thill
seemed willing to overlook those at the time. For starters, he noted that Jive competes
against a group of larger rivals - ranging from heavyweights Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
and IBM (NYSE:IBM) to "high-profile Salesforce.com" (NYSE:CRM) and "freemium-based
Yammer" (which charges nothing for its service) - but felt comforted by the fact that the
company kept expanding its market share, anyway. (Notably, records show,
Salesforce.com now boasts a major contract with a giant technology company that ranks
as a treasured client of Jive itself.) Thill also recognized that Jive would likely remain
unprofitable for years, a trend that he accepted as a tradeoff for rapid revenue growth, and
briefly mentioned another threat -- which could soon hammer the young stock - as well.


Like several other newcomers to the sector, such as LinkedIn (LNKD) and Groupon, Jive
withheld the majority of its stock from the public market when it debuted on the Nasdaq
exchange. Come June, however, Jive must lift the restrictions on that stock - most of it
originally issued for around $5 a share or less - and could see its freely trading "float"
expand to roughly three times its current size as a result.


Even LinkedIn, a standout performer among the new social media stocks, took a massive
hit back when its "lockup" period came to an end. LinkedIn actually dragged Groupon
down along with it (as covered in more detail in the related story seen below), while Zynga
- which debuted just three days after Jive itself went public - recently suffered through a
similar meltdown of its own.


While Jive itself could soon face similar exposure, Thill devoted most of his attention to
more upbeat topics when reviewing the company instead. He focused primarily on
revenue growth, predicting that Jive would continue to outpace the competition in this
particular category, and assigned a hefty 40% premium to its stock as a reward. At that
point, however, Jive already traded within $1 of the 12-month target price that resulted
from his careful exercise.


Back then -- with the stock boasting the highest multiple in its entire peer group - Jive still
hovered around $15 a share.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560071-jive-software-a-social-butterfly-with-borrowed-wings 5/9


Enter Jonathan Lebed, a past target of securities regulators bent on resurrecting another
stock in the social media space.


Lebed now promotes risky stocks on behalf of the so-called "National Inflation
Association" (NIA), its own co-founder has acknowledged, which began touting
BroadVision - a hopeless loser in recent years - the day before Jive went public and
brought some fresh attention to the group. The NIA owned 158,000 shares of BroadVision
going into that publicity campaign, a stake that would rapidly skyrocket in value from $1.31
million to $8.92 million on constant hype,with the firm urging investors to buy the stock
even as it regularly dumped those same high flying shares.


For Lebed, the reported mouthpiece of that organization, stock promotion has delivered
riches well beyond those achieved by traditional means. He actually perfected the art as a
teenager, records indicate, and wound up downright famous - or at least infamous - as a
result.


"If you go to Wikipedia and look up 'pump and dump,' the first (example) they show is
Jonathan Lebed," celebrity investment broker Peter Schiff noted last year on his popular
radio program. "It's almost as if he invented it!"


Just like the doomed microcap names that Lebed has favored in the past, records
indicate, BroadVision responded in dramatic fashion. A listless single-digit stock before
the NIA endorsed it, BroadVision suddenly exploded on a massive surge in volume and
practically quadrupled - soaring from roughly $8 to $32 a share - by the time that
Facebook sparked the sudden craze for Jive itself.


Once that happened, signaling that the fever could prove contagious, Lebed began
trumpeting Jive as an impressive high flier as well. The NIA wound up with a multimillion-
dollar position in Jive itself the very next month, with the firm soon cutting that $2.5 million
stake by almost half - as the stock hurled toward its peak - and ultimately dumping it
altogether.


"Jive is also looking very strong in recent days," the NIA emphasized in the meantime. "If
the whole enterprise social space starts taking off together next week, they could become
the second-biggest story on Wall Street today, right after the #1 story - the Facebook IPO!"


The last major sympathy rally to ignite the technology space ended very badly for some
investors, however. With excitement building ahead of the Groupon offering last year,
records show, antsy investors began snatching up shares of companies with a presence

5/22/2018 Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560071-jive-software-a-social-butterfly-with-borrowed-wings 6/9


in the same space. That hype resurrected an outfit known as Local.com (NASDAQ:LOCM)
-severely wounded after TheStreetSweeper had exposed its flaws - by sparking a sudden
burst of interest in its shares.


While Local.com had languished below $4 a share before that time, the stock rocketed
toward $7 on the initial buzz and -- with the help of additional chatter -- still hovered
around the $5 mark one short year ago. But the stock tanked by the time that Groupon
finally went public, sinking another 18% to $2.64 on the day of the actual IPO, and has
spiraled even lower since that time.


As noted above, Groupon itself soon cratered as well. Groupon arrived on the market just
as LinkedIn saw its lockup period come to an end and ruined the honeymoon that young
stocks frequently enjoy. Both stocks fell in unison on the downpour of LinkedIn shares,
The New York Times observed as they plunged, with Groupon taking such a painful hit
that it wound up within a nickel of its original offering price.


"The expiration of LinkedIn's lock-up period is likely weighing on the minds of some
investors," the newspaper decided, "who are worried that Groupon's stock will take a
beating once employees are allowed to sell their shares."


Dark Prognosis?


While Groupon has yet to face that particular test, which looms ahead next month, the
company has messed up so many times by now that its stock chart already looks like a
disaster. Despite its brief time on the market, Groupon has already managed to: miss Wall
Street profit estimates by posting an outright loss the first time it released financial results;
restate its numbers utilizing proper accounting techniques that made its results look even
worse than they already were; prompt a reported investigation by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission because of that same financial restatement; ruin the credibility of
its boardroom audit committee to such an extent that it replaced most of its members in a
desperate effort to regain investor trust; and destroy all of its IPO gains, with its shares
falling to barely half of their offering price, before its lockup period has even comes to an
end.


So far, Jive itself has provided only one quarterly update to Wall Street since going public
late last year. (The company will follow up with a new set up of numbers next week.)
Although Jive beat Wall Street expectations with those year-end results, records indicate,
the company still lost plenty of money - and fell short of its own financial targets - in the
process. As it turns out, corporate filings show, Jive hoped to book more business and
burn less cash than it did in the second half of the year.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: A 'Social Butterfly' With Borrowed Wings? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560071-jive-software-a-social-butterfly-with-borrowed-wings 7/9


Nevertheless, when Jive released those numbers to the public, CEO Anthony Zingale
seemed totally delighted with the recent performance of the company. Indeed, Zingale
specifically stated that Jive felt "thrilled to announce record financial results" that clearly
represented "a strong finish to a remarkable year" for a company "well-positioned to
execute on (its) growth strategy."


Despite that upbeat tone, however, the news looked rather bleak. While revenue soared
by an impressive 53% in the fourth quarter, records show, expenses literally exploded
(with overhead costs more than doubling) over the course of that same period. As a result,
operating losses skyrocketed by a whopping 85% -- easily outpacing the growth in
revenue - during the final quarter of that celebrated year.


A scrappy underdog that has somehow overcome long odds from the start, Jive selected a
CEO who fits that same kind of image. His story, as reported by Forbes (back when Jive
was "profitable") last summer, goes something like this:


A bartender's son who grew up in Cleveland, Zingale bootstrapped his way through
college at the University of Cincinnati by working as a summer trash collector. Armed with
a dual degree in business and engineering, he then headed out to Silicon Valley and soon
made a new for himself as a rising star in the field. He paid his dues at a string of
technology companies, starting with giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and then went on to
serve as the turnaround CEO of scandal-tainted Mercury Interactive before ultimately
landing at Jive itself.


Back then, records show, Jive looked downright incapable of spawning paper millionaires.
The company generated a meager $17 million in revenue during 2007, when Zingale
originally joined the board, and wound up with less than $10 million in the bank by the end
of the following year. By the time that Jive appointed Zingale to serve as its CEO in the
first half of 2010, however, the company had already confirmed plans for a public offering.


When that IPO finally took place - more than two years later -- Zingale sounded like the
humble son of a bartender once again.


"About two-thirds of the perspective in the Valley, I'm not a fan of," he told Forbes right
after Jive stormed onto the Nasdaq exchange. "I'm not a fan of 'It's all about me.' I'm not a
fan of 'I've got to be on the cover of your magazine.' I'm not a fan of 'I make all the
decisions, and all the success is because of me.'"

Today, Jive itself could arguably confess the same kind of thing. It could deliver a
message - validated by the evidence presented above - that goes something like this: It's
not about Jive, or the decisions that it has made, or the success that it hopes to one day
achieve. It's about Facebook, and its decision to go public, and the success that it brought
to other names in the group.


It's about a temporary rally, hyped by a seasoned promoter, that managed to reignite even
a burned-out Internet stock.


With Lebed serving as its reported mouthpiece, the NIA relentlessly touted BroadVision
and routinely spotlighted the impressive gains recorded by Jive itself as well. At the same
time, records show, the firm also began to quietly dump its BroadVision stock - striking it
rich on the very hype that it helped create - along the way. The NIA then emerged with a
multimillion-dollar position in Jive itself, its disclaimers now reveal, and promptly started
cashing in its profits on that highflier, too.


Notably, his fellow NIA co-founder has revealed, Lebed himself once offered this advice:
"Don't invest in the promoted stocks." His record only underlines that message. If Jive
follows the same familiar pattern established by other Lebed picks over the years, history
indicates, the stock has likely peaked - at an artificially high price - on a powerful mix of
hope and hype alone.


"Nobody makes investment decisions based on reading financial filings," Lebed declared
in a big article published byThe New York Times years ago. "Whether a company is
making millions or losing millions, it has no impact on the price of the stock. Whether it is
analysts, brokers, advisors, Internet traders, or the companies, everybody is manipulating
the market.


"If it wasn't for everybody manipulating the market," he concluded, "there wouldn't be a
stock market at all."


Disclosure:


I am short JIVE. Prior to the publication of this investigative report, TheStreetSweeper
(through its members) established a short position in JIVE with the intention of profiting on
any future declines in the stock price. Currently, TheStreetSweeper has sold a total of
93,529 shares of JIVE short at an average price of $23.91 a share. Going forward,
TheStreetSweeper may choose to adjust the size of this investment - by increasing,
decreasing or covering its short position in the stock - and will fully disclose the details of
any future transactions as those trades occur.
