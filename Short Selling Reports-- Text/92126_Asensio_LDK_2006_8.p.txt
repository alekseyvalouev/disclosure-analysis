Déjà vu for LDK in Latest


Press Release.


Christmas came early for LDK Solar Co., Ltd. this year. On


December 17, 2007, the company’s independent audit


committee, comprised of two “independent” directors from


LDK’s board, announced that the company’s independent


review was complete after �nding “no material errors in the


Company’s stated silicon inventory qualities as of August 31,


2007.”


The December 17 press release closely echoes LDK’s


statement on October 4, 2007, after an employee’s internal


report documenting existing investor concerns over


inconsistencies in the company’s inventory and cost/expense


reporting became public. In the October 4 release, LDK


claimed that an internal review of the inventories revealed


“no material discrepancies as compared to LDK’s �nancial


statements.” To verify the results of its internal investigation,


LDK formed an independent audit committee. The


committee then retained Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP to


serve as the independent legal counsel for the committee.


Simpson Thatcher hired Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to serve


as the auditors for the investigation.


It remains di�cult to identify a di�erence between LDK’s


hasty internal review and the work of the independent audit


committee. LDK executives led both investigations. In early

December, LDK CFO Jack Lai publicized details from the


auditors’ review, including the schedule of the investigation


and the status of the �eld research. In addition to �nancing


the investigation, LDK executives communicated with the


independent advisors throughout the investigation.


The independence of the audit committee and its advisors


remains doubtful. It should also be noted that LDK’s


December 17 press statement does not mention the status


of the SEC’s ongoing investigation of the company’s


reporting practices. LDK is not �nancing the SEC’s


investigation and is unable to in�uence its results or timing


and cannot comment on the investigation’s status. Investors


should remain wary of the promotional activities of a highly


questionable, recently formed solar company engaged in


irregular transactions with its suppliers and wait for the


�ndings of the SEC.
