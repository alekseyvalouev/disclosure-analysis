SFX Entertainment: The House Of Cards Is Collapsing

Summary


SFXE shares are down over 70% since we published on the stock.


We believe there is still another 100% decline to go.


SFXE is quickly running out of cash and liquidity.


Ticket sales and festival popularity appear to be in decline.


We believe bankruptcy is next.


In October 2014 (here) and November 2014 (here), we wrote up our short case on SFX
Entertainment (NASDAQ:SFXE). Our write-ups highlighted SFXE's over-levered balance
sheet and heavy cash burn and warned investors of an upcoming collapse in SFXE's
share price. Since our publications, SFXE shares are down over 70%.


Recent negative developments at the company and continued cash burn make us believe
the company is now hurtling towards bankruptcy. We remain short shares of SFXE with a
price target of $0.


Robert Sillerman has pulled his bid


We never believed Sillerman's bid (here) was legitimate. First, Sillerman had no financing
in place. Second, Sillerman stated he'd vote for a better deal if it was only 2.5% higher
than his bid. We believed this did not indicate firm interest on his part and that it was
merely bait as he fished for a buyer. Lastly, it appeared that Sillerman himself had cash
issues. His termination fee, should he walk away, was payable in shares of SFXE and not
cash. Also, the provision that allowed shareholders to stay in the equity in the private
NewCo suggested that Sillerman would prefer to spend less cash in taking the company
private.


When Sillerman failed to meet SFXE's request for financing commitments last week
(here), we weren't surprised. We believe his statements that he is still interested in taking
SFXE private, albeit at a lower price, don't carry much water either. We will explain why
below.


It's easy to see why Sillerman walked away: SFXE is hemorrhaging cash

The cash burn issues that we highlighted previously have only continued at SFXE. It has
failed to produce positive CFFO in any single quarter since going public and net leverage
has risen every single quarter.


It's also worth noting that cash flows and net leverage would be even worse if Spotify had
not advanced SFXE $10 million for their Content Agreement (see Note 15 in the 2Q 2015
10-Q here). While a $10 million upfront payment is nice, it's still less than 3 months of
cash burn at the company.


Limited liquidity sources remaining

SFXE's liquidity issues are evident in other ways as well. First, SFXE disclosed in Note 5
of its 1Q 2015 10-Q (See "Credit Facility Second Amendment" here) that Barclays had
pulled its credit line and required SFXE to fund 105% of any amount it wishes to borrow
on the Revolver. Second, it was reported by Forbes in early August (here) that SFXE had
stopped paying distributors and music labels for putting their music on Beatport. While this
was resolved shortly thereafter (here), it is not an indication of financial strength at SFXE.


In fact, things have gotten so bad that despite the egregious lending conditions with the
Barclays credit line, SFXE withdrew $24.2 million under the Revolver and only had $5.9
million of availability, as of June 30, 2015 (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" here). In
order to collateralize the revolver, SFXE had to borrow money from Sillerman Investment,
an entity controlled by Robert Sillerman, and pay a 12% interest rate.


With additional debt availability severely restricted and expensive, any future capital
injection would require equity. However, SFXE's ability to tap the equity markets is
effectively shut off after its disastrous share issuance on June 17, 2015 (here). SFXE
shares quickly broke the $4.34 issuance price and fell 70%. We don't believe any
shareholders would be interested in another deal.


SFXE itself acknowledges its liquidity issues in its latest 10-Q filing (See "Future capital
requirements" here). It noted that it has significant cash needs coming up:


Furthermore, SFXE is not certain it can meet these financial requirements:

The bond market has certainly reacted negatively to the SFXE disclosures and news flow.
SFXE bond prices have collapsed in the last three weeks, according to internal runs from
Barclays, which underwrote the debt. It appears that debtholders think a default or
bankruptcy is highly likely and that SFXE's equity is worthless.

The signs of the company's disintegration aren't limited to the financial markets. A quick
review on Glassdoor.com indicates that SFXE is losing employees (here). One employee
wrote on June 2, 2015, "get your money out before you go bankrupt...will probably be this
year."

The average Glassdoor.com review for SFX Entertainment is 1.9 stars with a deteriorating
trend.


Has EDM peaked?


Lastly, it appears that the popularity of EDM music festivals has peaked, or at least the
popularity of SFXE's properties. First, SFXE's Deferred Revenues balance in 2Q 2015
shows a decline, despite continued acquisitions and a greater number of festivals. Ticket
sales collected in advance of an event are recorded as Deferred Revenues by SFXE. If
the festivals were growing in attendance and people were purchasing more tickets, we
would expect an increase in Deferred Revenues. The opposite is happening for SFXE,
which indicates that ticket sales are likely declining.


This is especially alarming because SFXE is hosting more festivals this year in the 3rd
quarter than last year, and more festivals are on sale as of the end of the quarter. This is
an indication that the festivals are seeing falling ticket sales, which is alarming for SFXE's
future prospects.


The lower attendance trend is evident in other channels as well. If one looks up popular
SFXE festivals such as Tomorrowland on Google Trends, you can see that search trends
have peaked and are declining.

Mysteryland, a major festival in the Netherlands since the 90s, appears to be in rapid
decline.


Life in Color, which helped popularize "paint parties," appears to have peaked and interest
is now waning.

Most shocking, the decline in popularity appears to be global. Stereosonic, a major festival
in Australia, has been seeing declining search trends.


Google Trends shows similar declines in other major SFXE properties such as Electric
Zoo and Sensation, as well as for the term "Electronic Dance Music."


Conclusion: SFXE remains a compelling short

We believe SFXE is under significant financial duress. It is quickly burning through cash
and has limited financing options. We believe the company is on its way to bankruptcy and
that Robert Sillerman's latest interest in taking the company private carries little weight.
While the company and Sillerman have stated that SFXE extended the offer period to
October 2, 2015 in order to "allow potential bidders and their financing sources to have
visibility into the Company's performance during its peak festival season," we believe this
is a false statement. Deferred revenues, a proxy for ticket sales, are declining, and SFXE
has substantial cash requirements that it says it may not be able to meet. We believe
management has stepped away because they can see that SFXE is going to go bankrupt.
We share this view and have a price target of $0.

Wow. Good for Author, bad for people that stayed on this ship...

Sillerman could come back with a $2 ps offer . I believe an asset sale alone is worth far more than $2. He would profit
from buying at that price as would a perspective raider. I don't think it's over yet . They still have valuable assets
others would be interested in at these stressed sp levels .

I would not remain short as the very easy money has been made. Down here at $1 means you can wipe out the debt
and have all the equity for $400 million. The current management has shown themselves woefully incapable but that

doesn't mean all those assets they acquired aren't worth something to other more capable groups. The rest of the
industry has been making money and i believe others have kept a watchful eye on the SFXE implosion.

DLee13, what do you mean "wipe out the debt and have all the equity for $400 million."? Please elaborate on
how that would work. Specifically, how does that not wipe out the current shareholders if the company goes
through Chapter 11?


20 Aug 2015, 09:50 PM


DLee13
At a $1 the market cap of the company is about $100 mill. So theoretically somebody could buy all the shares
and then payoff the debt (which is around $300 mill) for $400 mill. That's not gonna happen but it at least
gives you an idea of relative value. If this was say the coal business where every player is having trouble, i'd
ride this thing closer to zero. But like i said before, the other players in the industry are making money so i
think its more likely that somebody comes in before it hits Chapter 11.


21 Aug 2015, 12:41 PM


Alec Mazo, Contributor
thanks DLee13, but i don't think that is a viable scenario. It would be cheaper for an interested buyer to take
the company over during Chapter 11 with a complete wipeout of the current shareholders and a restructured
debt, say 50 cents on the dollar... so the total cost would be $200m instead of $400m.


I'm speculating on the debt of course, as it could be much worse than 50 cents. That's to be revealed during
reorganization due diligence of any interested buyers.
