We have calculated BPT's future cash distributions in several oil price scenarios, and we
believe shares will almost certainly go below J.P. Morgan's $40 target price in the near
term.


Background on BPT


BPT is not an oil company. It is a trust that was formed solely to receive quarterly
payments of cash from British Petroleum. Every quarter, cash from British Petroleum
comes in to BPT and is distributed to BPT shareholders.


One day, BPT will stop receiving cash and will shut down. We believe this day will come
in a few years.


The amount of cash received by BPT shareholders every quarter is determined by a
formula described in the terms of a contract from 1989 called the Overriding Royalty
Conveyance. All BPT shareholders can use this formula to calculate how much cash
they will receive. The formula uses several inputs, including the price of oil, US inflation,
and the amount of oil production from BP's Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska.


The Conveyance explains the precise circumstances that would lead to BPT shutting
down. When that happens, BPT shares will be canceled, and shareholders will be left
only with the cash they have collected before that day.


Calculating BPT's cash flows


The formula to calculate BPT's cash flows is as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2962396-bp-prudhoe-bay-royalty-trust-j-p-morgan-says-sell-stock-will-go-below-40?source=all_articles_title 3/7


BPT's future cash flows are very predictable if you make assumptions about the future
price of oil, and if you assume that the BP Prudhoe Bay oil field produces more than
90,000 barrels per day. The other inputs to the cash flow formula are specifically defined
in the Conveyance.


Shareholders should note that "Adjusted Chargeable Costs" are not the actual costs of
running any oil field; rather, they are a set of figures that have already been defined in
the Conveyance contract.


These "Adjusted Chargeable Costs" rise significantly over time according to the terms of
the Conveyance.


As "Adjusted Chargeable Costs" go up, BPT shareholders get paid less and less.


When will BPT be shut down? How much cash will shareholders receive?


BPT will terminate when the total cash sent from British Petroleum to BPT falls below $1
million for two consecutive years, according to the Conveyance. At that point, BPT
shareholders will likely be left with nothing.


We have modeled BPT's future cash flows in several different oil price scenarios.

The financial models show that in all scenarios close to today's oil price, BPT's total
future cash distributions per share are less than the cost of buying one share today.


At $50 per barrel of WTI crude (close to today's oil price), BPT's distributions go to zero
by 2020, and the total distributions to BPT shareholders before termination will be less
than $17 per share. Our calculations show that the net present value of those
distributions discounted at 10% is less than $14 per share.


This scenario suggests downside of nearly 80% from yesterday's closing stock price.


At $70 per barrel of WTI crude (significantly above today's oil price), BPT's distributions
will drop to zero by 2023, and shareholders will receive less than $45 per share before
BPT is shut down.


How much is BPT worth if oil recovers?


Both J.P. Morgan's calculations and our calculations suggest that BPT is wildly
overvalued even if the oil price recovers.


Below, we show our projections for the value of BPT's shares if we assume that oil
recovers to higher oil prices.

Even if oil goes back to $90, we believe the net present value of BPT's future
distributions is less than the current stock price.


We encourage anyone who owns or is thinking about buying BPT to calculate the trust's
cash flows for his or her self.


If you want to find a way to play an oil recovery, we recommend you look elsewhere.


But what about the yield?


We understand that investors may be tempted to purchase BPT because of the yield. In
January, BPT paid out a quarterly distribution of $2.69 per share to its shareholders. At
first glance, this looks like an attractive yield.


However, a high yield on a stock is only valuable if the yield is sustainable.


BPT's current distributions are unsustainable and are projected to go to zero in a
handful of years. Don't take our word for it - take J.P. Morgan's.


BPT has paid out dividends for a long time, but the contract signed in 1989 was
specifically designed to terminate one day. The "Adjusted Chargeable Costs" go up
every year according to the Conveyance, which causes the total cash distributed to BPT
to go down, and once cash distributions fall below $1,000,000 for two years, BPT
terminates and shareholders are left with nothing.

encourage you to do your own calculations.


Even if the oil price recovers significantly, over the entire life of BPT, shareholders are
likely to receive less in dividends per share than the cost of buying one share today.
