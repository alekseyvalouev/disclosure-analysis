The Undisclosed Lawsuit That BofI Holding And H&R Block
Shareholders Should Know About
Feb. 2, 2015 7:30 AM ET76 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


BOFI has not disclosed a ~$400M breach of contract lawsuit dating back to July
2012.


The breach of contract case is set to go to jury trial in October.


The damages claimed in the lawsuit appear to be material in relation to BOFI’s book
value.


BOFI states in its SEC filings that it is not involved in any material legal proceedings.


In our opinion, Gregory Garrabrants displayed a rather distasteful sense of humor during
the BOFI 2Q15 earnings call. When a KBW analyst inquired as to whether regulators had
asked BofI Holding (NASDAQ:BOFI) to tweak anything in its business model as part of the
H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) approval process, he had a rather odd response:


I have to say, Julianna, I'm going to give you like the award for that. I think my dad
had a good sense of humor and he used to say - when you get a question like have
you stopped beating your wife, you always have to stop and say, wait a minute, what
was that question?


We find nothing humorous about domestic violence.


We are glad that sell-side analysts are beginning to ask the same questions we have been
asking.


We did have one question for management coming out of the earnings call that we were
unable to ask.


Why is BOFI not disclosing a lawsuit from 2012 that is going to jury trial in October of this
year?


Given this case pertains to an acquisition of deposits and breach of contract, we think
H&R Block shareholders would be particularly interested in the details of the lawsuit.

Two current and active lawsuits (links provided below) have been brought to our attention
since our first article on BOFI. We encourage readers to digest the contents of the lawsuits
on their own and form their own conclusions. We provide short summaries below.


Undisclosed Lawsuit #1 - Breach of Contract Claim


BOFI is accused of breaching a contract with Waterfield Financial Services in connection
with an acquisition of deposits.


We summarized the damages claimed in this case below:


Undisclosed Lawsuit #2 - Class Action Wiretapping Lawsuit


BOFI is accused of recording phone calls without the plaintiff's permission.


In its most recent 10-Q, under legal proceedings, BOFI states the following:


Item 1. Legal Proceedings:


"We are not involved in any material legal proceedings. From time to time we may be
a party to a claim or litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business, such as claims
to enforce liens, claims involving the origination and servicing of loans, and other issues
related to the business of the Bank."


We reviewed BOFI's financial statements dating back to 2012 and found no mention
of any active legal proceedings.


We have no view on the merits of the lawsuits. Given the nature of the lawsuits, we do not
believe that they fall under the category of "ordinary course of business" lawsuits. We also
note that the damages claimed in the breach of contract lawsuit appear to make up a
significant proportion of BOFI's book value.

BOFI has also countersued, and the case appears to have been actively litigated for
several years now. We therefore found it highly irregular that BOFI has never disclosed
the existence of these lawsuits in its public filings, particularly given that the July 2012
case is set to go to jury trial in October 2015.


Most public companies that we follow provide ample disclosures regarding lawsuits of this
magnitude. Details provided generally include the name of the case, the venue, a brief
description of the case, and some commentary on the merits of the case. Therefore, the
lack of any mention of these court cases surprised us.


Just look at H&R Block's filings to get a sense for what standard litigation disclosures look
like.


We already covered the numerous questions we have about BOFI's disclosures in our last
article:


BofI Holding: Will Regulators Strike?


We were also surprised BOFI received no questions about its loan book performance on
the earnings call. We note that non-performing and delinquent loan issues appear to be to
manifesting themselves at BOFI, with NPLs / 90 day past due delinquent loans picking up
rapidly sequentially. Despite these trends, BOFI yet again recorded an incredibly small
allowance for loan loss provisions:

Given the uptick in NPLs, one would expect to see loan loss provisions grow
commensurately with the NPL growth. We plotted out BOFI's allowance for loan losses
against its NPL balance. For those less familiar with bank analysis, we looked at the size
of BOFI's loan loss reserves in comparison to its non-performing loan balance. For a bank
growing loans at a 50%+ pace, one would expect the allowance for loan losses to run at
>100% of current NPLs in even the healthiest of banks in order to capture loan growth.
We also plotted out the sequential growth in BOFI's allowance for loan losses against its
NPL growth in the past two quarters. In our opinion, both metrics point to management
under-reserving against future loan losses.

Other questions that we think should have been asked on the earnings call:


What proportion of your loans are to foreign nationals? Given the recent appreciation
of the USD, do you see any risk of an uptick in defaults in your foreign national loan
portfolio given mortgage affordability has stepped down meaningfully for non-USD
denominated home buyers?

Based on your recent loan to Vapor Hub International (OTCPK:VHUB) (see loan
agreement here), is BOFI now entering the penny stock lending business? How do you
think about loss rates when you lend to these types of companies?
How are the January 2014 changes to prepayment penalty rules impacting your
business? Your refi/prepayments appear to be accelerating - is this a potential
headwind to loan growth going forward?


Summary Thoughts


During the conference call, Garrabrants also took the unusual step of calling out short-
sellers of his stock. He said that "short-sellers are trying to stem the pain they're going to
feel by choosing poorly which shares they short".


Ultimately, short-sellers and long investors are looking for the same thing - transparency in
order to conduct fundamental stock analysis. On the 2Q15 conference call, Mr.
Garrabrants expressed clear frustration with the "short-sellers" of his stock.


Attacking the short-sellers will not alleviate these frustrations.


A simple solution to Mr. Garrabrants' frustrations would be for BOFI to provide investors
with more color on: the contents of its loan book, its lending standards, why it finds its
current loan loss provisions appropriate, and what regulatory risks it is taking in the
process of underwriting its wide spread loans.


Garrabrants on the call also stated that "people have been able to write things that are
untrue about us, and, really, I don't know how much effect they've had…I think mostly
they've been disregarded for the drivel that they are".


We see signs that Garrabrants himself has not disregarded our previous write-up as
"drivel". We note that since our article was published, both he and the CFO have modified
their official biographies.

"We find nothing humorous about domestic violence."


Precisely why his comment was dead on. There is NO answer to such a heinous question as domestic violence. The
only purpose of such a question is to entrap. And, to be asked such a question is insulting. His response indicates
that he believes that the question posed to him had no answer, was intended to entrap and was insulting. The distaste
you show for his comment was aimed at the questioner.

Thanks for the article. I don't understand all the backlash. As a BOFI investor, I'd say this is a pretty important
data point! For a small cap in a heavily regulated industry, I'd say a $400mm lawsuit is pretty critical

information! If management had disclosed it and said it was immaterial, that would be one thing. But no
mention at all? That raises some red flags. Also, from my experience, management teams that go out of their
way to contest short sellers generally signal some trouble is brewing. If the bear case is unfounded or totally
off base, let the performance of the company speak for itself. The fact that the CEO would go out of his way to
call out short sellers in an earnings call is bush league and signals weakness in my opinion. BOFI's had a
nice run, but it's time for me to head for the exits. Plenty of other banks more reasonably priced and better
positioned when funding costs go up, while avoiding the dramatic tail risk.

BOFI noticed in its most recent conference call that the plaintiff walked away and no money was paid. In
short, the article is much ado about nothing.

You know, the problem with your articles is that you don't disclose all of the facts.


I've seen your other posts and as an example in this article you state "with NPLs / 90 day past due delinquent loans
picking up rapidly sequentially". IF you were REALLY trying to disclose the facts you would have mentioned that the
real reason why they jumped was because of only two large loans. Referencing the transcript: "Our strong credit
discipline and low loan-to-value portfolios have resulted in consistently low credit losses and servicing costs. At
December 31, 2014, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of entire portfolio of real estate was only 54%. Total
non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans was 80 basis points at December 31, 2014, up from 57 basis
points at June 30, 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to 2 single-family residences with balances of $7 million
and $5 million, with loan-to-value ratios of 70% and 47.6%, respectively. Both properties are located in premier
markets, with very strong housing market, and we don't expect to occur at any loss on either of these loans. We do
not see any early-stage delinquency trends increasing in our portfolio." FULL Transcript here: http://seekingalpha.co...


So, if you take your graph and subtract this 12M from it, it shows that they've grown with relatively no significant
delinquent concern.

Yeah, and Seattle would have won the superbowl without the interception. Whether they are two or twenty the
loan quality is deteriorating.


02 Feb 2015, 01:11 PM 


John_3.14159265359
I see your point however considering the size of these two loans vs their entire dollar amount of delinquent
loans, I think that you may want to give them some breathing room on this matter.

Unfortunately these two bad loans do skew their numbers and makes it look as if the bottom is falling out.
Why, because they've done such a great job of giving loans to highly qualified buyers. So in reality it isn't as
bad as is sounds here and the LTV on those properties is sufficient enough to mitigate any concern.


On the flip side, if BOFI really had a problem that they were trying to cover up I don't think that they would
have specifically brought attention to that matter leaving it more open for speculation. Either way, if you're
right or I, I'll be watching for next quarterly report just as you.

one will NOT be fooled by you again.

Why don't you provide bofi's DEFENSE AND COUNTERCLAIMS.WFS went bankrupt and bankruptcy often leads to
fishing suits . I can not know without the above.


02 Feb 2015, 11:22 AM 


longdistance
Pages 65-70 are the letter BofI sent to Waterfield spelling out the reasons for the termination of the
agreement. I imagine that is going to be the basis for any Defense and Counterclaims. So it is possible to get
a reasonable assessment of the merits of the case just from the document link above. 
I think the merits are weak but would highly value your opinion on how good juries typically are at seeing
through the purposeful legal obfuscation in cases like this.


Its seems unlikely that Garrabrants - originally trained as a lawyer - would  
engage in criminal acts (as the suit claims).


The Waterfields appear to have a long history of poor business decisions and then subsequent lawsuits
(some mildly successful).

...and wait a minute, in the second picture that you posted of the BIO for Gregory Garrabrants - it STILL indicates that
he was an attorney for over 15 years, but yet you just intentionally didn't highlight it in the second picture. Why?

John,


Good catch. Clearly deceptive tactics to fear monger. I am not saying that everything he said is false, but
these indicators mean the author is no more reliable than the supposed liars at BOFI.

I'm surprised the user "CommentLA" has not yet appeared on this thread - he usually has unique and
interesting insights to share about this stock in particular. I bet he has a pretty interesting perspective on the
biography change that the author talks about as well. John_3.14159265359, do you care to comment?


05 Feb 2015, 11:58 PM 


John_3.14159265359
Unfortunately I don't know the history of this BIO but I will note that everyone here is also assuming that he
personally made the typo, how about the office clerk/worker/etc that actually put the profile together? Or the
person that took that crappy photo of him... This guys next article is going to probably complain that it's not an
accurate photo or something.


Realistically, taking a step back this BIO change doesn't really change anything, just that he was an associate
during graduate school like 15+ years ago... like whoopee-do-dah... At least he did something respectable in
his field of practice than flip burgers or deliver pizza.

The_Enforcer_2003
Glad we can debate this one back and forth. I do enjoy healthy debate. My main area of focus is Corporate
Governance. I think this company would make a great corporate governance case study for my business
school students! I don't know much about the board structure, but I suspect it is filled with a bunch of the
CEO's friends who are a bunch of "yes men". "Independent directors" who also happen to be former college
roommates for example.


Hypothetically, let's assume a clerical officer did write the bio. This guy is the CEO of a public company and
signs off on everything in his SEC filings, as well as everything that is captured in the filings. It's his job to
check these things. It's his job to check a lot of things. If the excuse is poor attention to detail, then I sure

hope he doesn't have the same poor attention to detail when he's reviewing financial statements for the
company or reviewing loans (although I guess that is something a lower level employee would do?).


In my view this guy has questionable ethics. He doesn't bother to tell people about this lawsuit? The
biography alone is just one sign of fabrication, but you put that together with this guy's blatant disregard for
SEC disclosure rules and it tells a story of a pretty unethical character. In bank investing, all that matters is
the management team. If you can't trust management, you can't trust the book.


This is definitely one I will follow and discuss at length with colleagues. It is such a unique situation. Makes for
a great case study!


06 Feb 2015, 11:33 AM 


John_3.14159265359
I get your point and yes, attention to detail does matter to me. ...although the more that I've been in business
myself I've also come to respect the other people that are really good at getting the job done without paying
any attention to detail at all. For them, they completely rely on their staff to address those details and any
problems that come up while focusing solely on the mission.


Ten years ago I would have completely been on your side of the fence regarding your concerns about
management and the lack of details but over the years I've worked with some truly fantastic people that were
great big-picture people with the worst attention to detail; even to the point of laughable clothing mismatches
or offices piled to the ceiling with stacks of paper. ...but in the end they seemingly did the impossible with
quotes like "disregard her statements at your own peril" that came from them being so smart and ahead of the
curve that you really thought what they were saying was a joke but ended up being solidly true as the 'details'
-slowly- unfolded...


On the other hand, Yes, I do see an unreported lawsuit as an issue... however given how overblown the rest
of the article is - I think that it's going to end up being something so ridiculous to try and get the stock to
plummet that you can smell the author's desperation.


Not to mention that I don't think that something like this would have gotten by the Institutional Owners who
have increased their positions from something like 69 to 73.41% over the last several months too. I'm almost
certain that if this lawsuit was even remotely as bad as the author makes it out to be that these guys would
have been dumping & not pumping this stock.


Oh, and let's not forget the swift approval of the other bank's asset assumption that I'm sure would have been
held up with something as serious as what the author's written here, right?


07 Feb 2015, 10:52 PM 


The_Enforcer_2003
Speaking of pumping & dumping, Johnny what do you make of BOFI's affiliation with the MZ Group, a group
with supposed longstanding ties to pump and dumpers that post on Seeking Alpha? http://bit.ly/1C7ssjm --


Also, was not sure how to read your comment - did you insinuate someone has been out there this past week
pumping this stock? That would be troubling...

I can't speak for FRA but I think the point was to highlight the PREVARICATION that takes place on the bio of the
most senior executive (BOFI culture?). We were led to believe that he PRACTICED for 15Y at reputable firms, which
clearly was not the case (they would be listed given that summer associate positions are referenced).


I am looking forward to the 8-k that ought to be coming out shortly with BOFI's estimate of losses on the referenced
cases. Mr. Pie/Lia better get to work!

Unless I'm missing something, it still indicates that he was an attorney for over 15 years, the guy that wrote
this article didn't highlight it in the second one - now that's PREVARICATION.


02 Feb 2015, 01:20 PM 


The_Enforcer_2003
I think the point the author made is that this guy outright lied about being a "lawyer" at these firms. An analogy
would be me - I spent the summer as a research associate at a university...it would be like me claiming I was
a professor at the university after one summer as a research associate...seems like a pretty material stretch
to me.


If there ends up being some problem with this bank - and I don't know if there is or is not going to be a
problem - these firms will not want their names associated with this guy.


If I was on the Board of this company, I'd be seriously reconsidering whether this guy should keep his job.
John what do you think about that position? Stock price moving up and to the right means nothing like the
poster below mentioned. Lots of bank stocks moved up and to the right until it all came to an abrupt end.


How can the Board keep this guy around when he's proven he's a complete liar? It's a question of ethics in
my mind.

I think that the typo is overblown and the facts could have been easily confused by the person writing the BIO.
I also think that this doesn't indicate anything about the company's ethics and the guy should remain unless
something major was found such as he wasn't an attorney; now THAT would be something to go off the deep
end about.


Also, as I previously mentioned, I really don't care that he was an associate 15+ years ago during graduate
school, do you? At least he was doing something in his field of interest & study and to me that's what counts.

bios are usually edited a dozen times and vetted by PR and legal staff given that the info is included in legal

Thank you for the link. Seems odd that his license went void after only 6 months.


09 Feb 2015, 11:19 PM 


The_Enforcer_2003
Equally odd that he summered at three top 3 big law firms and did not work full time at any of them. Odd
behavior for a law school student. The Board should have looked into this fact pattern.


10 Feb 2015, 12:36 AM

Not very odd. McKinsey is the premier management consulting firm in the world (google it). They hire Harvard
MBAs and then poach the very best Ph.Ds in science and Engineering. Apparently they also poach the very
best law students. They pay about 2x anything else a Ph.D or Law grad can get. About 80% of their
employees go on the be CEOs eventually. It would not be an opportunity you would turn down immediately - if
offered it.

Read it. It says "served as a ________, ___________, AND attorney for the last 15 years". Read properly, I

Setting aside all the whining from the bulls and the fear-mongering of the shorts, does anyone have a good answer to
why the lawsuit wasn't disclosed?


Is BOFI's position that it is so immaterial and/or so asinine that it doesn't warrant inclusion? (That's fine if it is, I just
would love to understand the reasoning.)

WilliamWallets & Aldos_Snow, I agree 100% ... and if this is true, I want to be the first to know all about the
lawsuit and why it's just now coming out. BUT at the same time... I have a great distrust for this article writer
not just for this article but also based on his previous posts regarding this company too. Just look at how he's
taken anything that he could find and blown it way out of proportion. If the same is true here it's probably at
least 100x overstated.


Also, yes, I am long on this stock and have been accumulating shares and watching them closely for the last
couple years, buying on the dips. Their performance has been great and so have my returns.


04 Feb 2015, 08:26 AM 


les2005
No need to guess here. You can read that in the disclosure. I sold my BOFI stock following his previous article, and
I'm glad I did. For two reasons really: first of all, whether it's Garrabrants' CV, his past as senior officer at Indiemac or
his questionable collaboration with dubious stock promoters - it just left me deeply uneasy with the trustworthiness of
management. Secondly, going through all the issues raised, I realised I just don't know enough about the intricacies of
banking to come to a first hand assessment of this company. And whether I believe this author or any other - the fact
remains I'd just blindly follow someone else's opinion. I urge everyone to ask themselves that question, too. And no,
the fact the stock keeps going up doesn't answer the question or prove anything. Other stocks have gone up too,
before they fell. Think Indiemac for example.

Perhaps some info might be helpful for some. Since I have been following this one for quite a while.


I think you are all overestimating Garrabrants role in the company a bit too much (especially, for example,

(been bought ?) out. And those two actually run the corporation at the highest levels. Garrabrants actually runs the
bank (not quite the same).


Garrabrants is not an entitled rich guy trying to milk stockholders. He is Stanford grad (which I happen to over-respect
a bit) who is a just a smart straight-shooting worker type (look at the resume again please). He took on fairly
significant risk to himself when he joined the operation. It was a very a conservatively run (when all else was not) and
fairly poorly performing tiny, no-name operation, we he stepped up to the plate. And I still don't like the name (what
happened to the 'THE').


Look at his compensation please. He mostly gets paid in stock. His fortunes rest on this companies stock price even
more than the rest of us. As such - he has every right to be as annoyed at short-side hit pieces as much as any other
long shareholder. And even better - everything he does is shareholder friendly (well - long shareholders, anyway ...).


I like when he speaks his mind. I like when he calls a bogus question - a bogus question. It means he is honest. For
those of you who are bad at poker, and can't tell a stock-moving short hit-piece from hard working guy, trust me if you
can't figure it out yourself.


And on the actual subject at hand ... My experience is that corporations do not discuss lawsuits that they consider to
be frivolous. They do not like to even give them the whiff of credibility by mentioning them if they are frivolous.


If it is not frivolous - you will all make out handsomely in the class action lawsuit (or 8 of them) that will immediately
follow. But I would not hold my breath. In this uncertain world you have a lot more things to worry about - that actually
might happen. 


06 Feb 2015, 06:02 PM 


The_Enforcer_2003
Helpful. I didn't see Stanford listed in the biography above? I doubt someone who went to Stanford would
forget to include that in his biography :-)


I think there is one thing all of us can agree on. #1 reason to own at least one share of this company is to be
part of the class action lawsuit!


06 Feb 2015, 10:45 PM

You are right. No Stanford. Not sure how I got that in my head.


Read the lawsuit before you get too excited about class actions. 
And google "Waterfield group". and/or Richard Waterfield. 
And Affinity Financial Corporation.


Its the perfect tangled web of shell corporations, legal shenanigans, mortgage bubbles, and everything you
thought existed only in the minds of "Occupy Wall St". The paper trail is long. And the hints are there for all to
see. You will never believe me - you have to see it for yourself. It really is impressive.


Its almost like a movie really. And the perfect finale (for me) would be that the Waterfields are the ones behind
the huge short interest in BofI (they have the money - and knowledge of this lawsuit - which they must think is

Maybe. It certainly is interesting how anyones opinions definitely filter what they read (and write). In politics
and stocks. Still, I'm not sure this will come down, in the end, to bios. I think BofI is a real company that goes
on making money with or without Garrabrants (hence the bio is less important). On the other-hand, I can't tell
if Waterfield Group is just a website, some lawyers, and what is left of grandpappies money.


08 Feb 2015, 09:08 AM 


longdistance
Ok, I actually read the legal complaint. Well almost all of it. Honestly, I have to give the author of this article, FRA,
kudos for providing a link to a copy of it.


I thought I would provide my summary (as short as possible) for those who could profit from my efforts. Disclosure: I
am not a lawyer, but I do have a Ph.D. from Stanford and reasonable reading comprehension.


(1) If you want to read it yourself, might I suggest you start with pages 65-70 (of the 70 pages) which is BOFIs letter
explaining why they are terminating the relationship with Waterfield. It is plain English and only mild legalese and gets
to the points faster. Then go page to page 1 and skim using the numbered sections referred to in the letter as hints
about where to maybe read much closer.


(2) Waterfield appears to have had a business helping groups like AARP or the Air Force set up banks for
themselves. The AARP wasn't (and isn't) really allowed to run a bank, so it would put its name/logo on a website, and
a real bank would actually hold the deposits. Waterfields set the whole thing up, and the bank holding the deposits
would pay both Waterfields and the AARP for doing the sales work.


(3) By March 2010 the bank (in Maryland) holding all these groups (like 40 of them) deposits went belly up (remember
2008?). The groups were pissed and found other banks to hold their money. Waterfields was in trouble. AARP went
into arbitration with Waterfields and everybody else just bailed on them.

(4) In 2010, Waterfields went to BofI and said we can get you deposits if you give us a cut. BofI agreed and by Nov
2010 they signed an agreement. But the deposits never really arrived, except for UFB Direct which was (is ?) really a
bank. Because all the groups that Waterfield said they could 'deliver' had left Waterfields consulting gig already, got
other banks, and made their own way.


(5) So BOFI paid $100,000 initial retainer to Waterfields and got almost nothing in return (except to service the UFB
Direct accounts - which was about 10,000 accounts). Waterfields never owned UFB Direct I think, just the rights to
service their accounts maybe.


(6) By February 2012 BofI was fed up. Lots of the agreement was void (see pages 65-70). They demanded their
$100,000 back and hinted they might start legal action. OK - highly ironically - one of BofIs many complains is the lack
of disclosure of a materially important lawsuit (with AARP, a customer BofI really wanted to get) by Waterfields prior to
the Agreement being signed.


(7) July 2012, Waterfields sues BofI instead (pages 1-20) claiming BofI destroyed the business (rather than the March
2010 affiliated Maryland bank closure and customer exodus).


(8) This is the same Waterfields in a 2007 lawsuit. http://bit.ly/1CD102m 
That also outlines (a bit) the connection with UFB Direct.


Sorry about the length.


06 Feb 2015, 10:41 PM

Last comment. My personal take (noting I am already long) was to be a bit worried until I got to pages 65-70. Where
all of a sudden things made a whole lot more sense. Some internet surfing of Waterfield Financial Services has also
helped. 
So this lawsuit looks like total nonsense to me. And that explains the nondisclosure I guess. But I am still not pleased
that I have to get my "materially relevant" info from short sellers rather than from BofI. marc heilweil sounds like a
lawyer to me. I would love to hear his opinion on the merits of this case.


06 Feb 2015, 10:51 PM 


buysideanalyst14
Longdistance - thank you for actually taking the time to read this lawsuit. I agree with you that the first 65
pages are troubling but BOFI's counterclaim does provide some comfort in the situation. However, the
problem is at this point it is he said she said. It appears Waterfield has an argument and BOFI has an
argument. Why should we believe BOFI's side and not Waterfield's side?


What is amazing is in the appendix it lists what Garrabrants thought was the actually value of buying this. And
the value is astronomical relative to their market cap at the time. So if Waterfield did "dupe" BOFI into buying
something that was really nothing, then Garrabrants did not do his diligence on the company. And if
Garrabrants can't do proper diligence on this acquisition, then what leads us to believe he can properly
analyze credits?!? And shouldn't his call into question the attractiveness of the HRB transaction? HRB is

literally giving away this deal (i.e. no purchase price) and BOFI is the only one willing to take on this asset.
That is extremely concerning to me.


And one side note, Waterfield actually sued AARP and won $2.75M through an arbitration panel. So clearly
Waterfield was providing enough value to AARP to collect from them.

Regardless, this should all have been disclosed in the 10-K so that investors were aware of the case given
the size of the lawsuit relative to the book value of BOFI.


07 Feb 2015, 12:28 PM 


buysideanalyst14
This is by far the most interesting part of the lawsuit (other than the potential damages)


WFS is informed and believes, based theron alleges, that BOFI was always aware the deposits into BOFI
from the Affinity Banking Centers customers should be classified as “Brokered”. The significance of the
deposits being “brokered” is that the federal regulators may, at some point, require stronger capitalization for
a bank accepting brokered deposits, and therefore reduce Return on Equity (“ROE”). WFS is informed and
believes, and based theron alleges, that BOFI has misrepresented to the federal regulators that the customer
deposits from UFB Direct are not brokered. WFS is informed and believes, and based theron alleges, that
BOFI and Garrabrants never intended to perform under the Acquisition Agreement in part because they did
not want the scrutiny of the federal regulators, as well as the potential increase in capitalization which would,
by definition, reduce BOFI’s ROE. WFS is informed and believes and based theron alleges, that Garrabrants
is compensated, in part, based on high ROE, as well as BOFI’s share valuation, and BOFI’s shares are
negatively valued, in part, by the general investment community based on BOFI’s brokered deposit mix.


Plaintiff is informed and believes that Defendants mischaracterized their regulatory discussions with the Office
of Thrift Supervision regarding the ability of BOFI to categorize the deposits generated from the Acquisition
Agreement as core, retail deposits rather than brokered deposits, manifesting itself in a complex payment
scheme generated by Garrabrants, designed to fraudulently skirt federal banking laws and regulations…


07 Feb 2015, 12:51 PM 


The_Enforcer_2003
I have researched governance for several years. Under Reg S-K Item 103, management is legally obligated
to disclose the name and details of all cases in which damages claimed exceed 10% of current assets which
is clearly the case here. Management just generally indicates an expectation of zero losses if a case is
deemed frivolous. Makes no sense to not disclose when they have been litigating this case for three years,
unless management thinks they do not owe transparency to shareholder and thinks they are above Reg S-K.


I read the other post by this author. It seems like there is a general pattern of disclosure problems at this
company -- the high risk loans, the loans to foreign nationals, the auditor change, the high officer level
turnover. And what is up with the marijuana penny stock loan?

John_3.14159265359
longdistance, thanks for the breakdown and your analysis of the case. As I expected based on the rest of this
article everything is overblown. I too would be interested to see what marc heilweil's take on this case is.


On a positive note, and as mentioned before I'm also long on this stock. I also think that what you're seeing
right now is the stock price recovering from those worried about the H&R deal not closing (IE what problems
have they unearthed/etc). Now that they received swift approval for asset assumption a lot of the fears
surrounding the delays are eased. I'm also not sure if you read the conference transcript however it looks as
though the real reason for the delays with the H&R deal are all because it's not clean-cut... hindsight is
probably kicking them daily but nonetheless should get completed soon.


Regardless, I think that these deals will continue to shore up their fundamentals rather well allowing them to
grow and assume other banks.


As for stock price estimations, Thomson Reuters are currently valuing them at 90L-95M-97H which I feel are
undervalued given the amount of activity not accounted for. From the conference call the pipeline is already at
record highs putting this quarters earnings at least at 1.26 although I'm expecting 1.39 or about 39% over
2014. Which at 1.26 this puts the quarterly earnings already at the mean with Reuters currently expecting
1.31 for the high.


I also think that we're in a good position given the forces of market rotation. Of course the stock as been on a
tear lately so there will probably be a minor bump before the stock skips higher.


07 Feb 2015, 10:54 PM 


The_Enforcer_2003
I found the part in the case about BOFI trying to deceive its regulators (the OTS) by hiding brokered deposits
particularly interesting. Longdistance what did you make of this part? I sent it along to the bank's new
regulator (OCC) just in case there is something going on there - I would hate to see tax payer dollars be
wasted because regulators were not aware of this potential malfeasance.

All lawsuits are he-said she-said. Read it to try and pull the facts - which is how it will be decided. What
exactly was the agreement (it is pages 20-40) and which entity actually violated the terms of that agreement.
Don't believe either side.


I don't think Garrabrants was "duped". My reading indicates that Waterfield wanted to sell the operation
outright - and BofI wouldn't take the bait. He probably thought there was a possibility there and it should be
pursued given a minor risk ($100,000). When they didn't deliver - he terminated it. I honestly think both
Waterfield and BofI thought at the time that maybe Waterfield could deliver the goods. But unfortunately they
couldn't. The default of the Waterfield bank in Feb 2010 caused the operation to fall apart too fast for the Nov
agreement to work.


On the HRB deal. BofI is NOT the only one who wants that asset. BofI lost the bid for those assets the first
time. The first HRB deal was not approved (maybe the problems stem from HRB not the acquiring banks ...)
BofI was the second bid. The price is right because HRB is desperate to unload and not be subjected to bank
regulations. Not because they are poor assets. 
We'll know in a week how that pans out. I don't think it is looking likely to happen (too close to the deadline -
which is self imposed - not a regulator date).


It seems likely that Waterfield was providing value to all its Affinity customers originally. That is not at issue.
However, Affinity promised it could deliver those customers to BofI. And it appears it had neither the ability,
nor the legal right, to do so. All those groups found other banks (BAC, etc) and moved on in Feb 2010. By
Nov, Affinity really had nothing to offer but UFB Direct - which was a bank - not a group like AARP.


I agree on the disclosure. I said the same earlier.


08 Feb 2015, 10:12 AM 


longdistance
A also agree.


In the letter, BofI emphasizes that it will continue the servicing of UFB Direct. 
That means maintain the website basically.


But UFB Direct was (and is ?) a bank. So UFB Direct corporation can hold those deposits. So the big
question there is UFB Direct reporting those as its assets when it files? Or is BofI including them in its assets?


This, I think (not a lawyer), could if true be the basis for a criminal/fraud complaint against BofI - but does not
seem a source of recovery or damages for Waterfield.

IRrelevant and that is why we have not heard about it. Thank you John_Pi for clearing up the matter about the

Anyone can file a lawsuit. Unfortunately every time BOFI starts moving up the same players come out of the
woodwork trying to scare unsophisticated investors out. For me it helps because I buy on the scares. I have been in
the stock for 5 years now and have made a fortune. The people who founded the company are really very smart and
creative, a bank with no branches

John - curious how you get to 1.39 of earnings. It seems like the loan pipeline is down sequentially to ~$950 at the
end of October to $850 at the end of December. Curious if you know why it's down and whether you have this
factored into you $1.39 estimate.

What I've seen is that they have several different verticals that have been fluctuating. If you take a look at
their investor conference docs you can see how some of their verticals are outgrowing the other pipelines that
are softening. So although you can look at one area and see that one pipeline has reduced you have to take
a look at the overall total pipeline.


What I've really liked about them is that some of this is by design and management is actively working to
review the business whereas a lot of other banks tend to place things on autopilot. For example, I think it was
about a year or more ago they stated issues with money market accounts that produced lower margin so they
quickly reduced their growth in those areas - but don't quote me on the account type without verification.


Bottom line is that it's mostly opinion based on their history but I'll know more after this upcoming investor
conference... Although given all of the BS that happened at the end of 2014 (and they still blew out the
previous 2013 year) I'm expecting good results given how the US is recovering.

Sorry John, I think I'm being a little dense here. The latest investor presentation I see on the website is from
12/2/2014 and has Oct 2014 loan pipeline of $939M. On the conference call, Mr. Garrabrants said as of Dec
2014 loan pipeline was $849M. Looks like the decline is largely due to lower Jumbo mortgage and Multi-
Family (bofi's bread and butter). Are we looking at different documents?

Also, could you clarify what you mean by "all of the BS that happened at the end of 2014". Don't fully
understand what you are talking about.


Thanks for your posts, btw. You seem to be one of the only people on this message board that cares to get to
the right answer. You have definitely helped in my analysis here.

ok, to clarify, I'll know more after this upcoming investor conference in a few days once the updated docs are
released:


2015 Sterne Agee Financial Institutions Investor Conference 
February 11-13, 2015 
Boca Raton Resort & Club 
501 East Camino Real 
Boca Raton, FL 33432 
888.543.1277


Regarding: "all of the BS that happened at the end of 2014" - nothing regarding BOFI - I was referring to the
market dip & scare, if you think about it people do tend to tighten up on buying things when the news is
flashing run for the hills everyday.


Basically, I wouldn't put a whole lot of value on where things were at as of Dec-2014 unless it was waaaayyyy
off... because in DEC and even early JAN it's too early to get an idea of what's really happening. What I mean
by that is that it's natural for Single Family & Jumbo loans requests to drop at the end of the year because
people are taking a lot of vacation and concentrating on family more than buying houses. - YET, BOFI still
pulled ahead without any dip in 2014. I think that's very impressive and shows me that 2015 could be an
extremely strong year for them too.


Take a look at page 21 of this doc from May 7, 2014, where you can see a better example of FYQ4-2013: 
http://bit.ly/1z4guGn


Also, considering that 15 & 30 year rates dropped over the last couple months I'm sure that they probably had
a huge increase in refi. Not to mention that now the news is flashing warnings about rates increasing so they
might get a huge push from that this year too.


Bottom line: I'm being very speculative based on my own expectations.


Thanks for your appreciation, I have a lot of money on the line with BOFI so if something good or bad comes
out I want to be one of the first to know regardless if I like it or not.

John - looks like unfortunately we did not get an updated pipeline out of the presentation they filed today. That
was disappointing, I would have thought if the numbers improved they would have given us January. It looks
like they did with with their Q1 pipeline where they gave us October numbers instead of September, which is
where the quarter ended. Do you think there is risk to your $1.39 number now that you don't have info
regarding an improved pipeline?

Were you there? Seems like you track this is closely as an investor relations manager for BOFI, great work
sir.

John_3.14159265359
buysideanalyst14, although I expected more, if you review their latest conference call it appears that they're
now intentionally keeping a lid on growth around 40-45% to avoid numerous issues and basically had to turn
away business to keep growth under control... They also have a lot of new products & technology in the pipe
coming by 2016 to aid with growth.


One thing to note from the conference call is that they had to push back a couple large deals that will now fall
into this current quarter and their pipeline is full so I'm expecting at least 1.47 vs the 'experts' current opinions
of 1.33 for the current quarter. Plus a nice POP when we see the H&R Block transaction close (soon?).


FMV from various research firms put the FMV at 112-115/share but I expect that to also get raised up along
with the current price/share target of 101 at Thompson Reuters.


It also appears that Institutional Ownership is also increasing too. Up 1% to 75 +/- (depends on your source)
from the last time I checked.

Interesting, thank you for your updated thoughts here. Given where the stock is trading, you don't think the
H&R block deal is already priced in to the stock? I'm hesitant to buy ahead of any announcement because if it
doesn't go through, we are surely headed lower from here, at least temporarily. Don't you think? While Greg
tried to give comfort that the deal would close soon, he was saying the same thing back in September and
then had egg on his face when it was delayed in early October. Given the severe delay in the deal, I'm
skeptical that he actually has any insight into what the OCC is thinking at this point. Thoughts?

John_3.14159265359
It's really hard to say and I understand your position. Especially since it's been over a year now since the
H&R block deal started.


Overall, with everything else going on in the markets and the time of year, I think that if you're in it for quick
cash it's going to be a near-term gamble. I would suggest a longer approach buying on the dips given the
expectation that they'll continue to hit their 40% growth targets.


This week it also appeared that there was a lot of resistance around 92 after earnings and I think that if we
can trend above 92.5 that we'll coast up to the next platform... but more interesting to me is that the "Short
Interest as % of Float" is around 17.9% with floating shares of about 13.8M.


So, as this company continues to outperform the shorts are going to be forced to eventually cover and the
stock is going to take off.


I'm also thinking that the shorts are still betting on the H&R deal to fail and that will potentially be the catalyst
once the deal is closed. So to answer your question, has if the deal has been priced in, I think that was
excessively removed back sept-oct when they announced the delay...


On the flip side of things, what I do like is how management has addressed their H&R delays and has
continued to grow without that deal. I think that this goes a long way to show that they're working hard to
continue to be successful and will continue to beat expectations in the future.


Obviously my opinions are speculative and I'm open to see what others think too. Any thoughts?

John,


I think you are pretty spot on with this assessment. My viewpoint is that the H&R deal closing would be an
obvious positive for the company. When considering the growth both top and bottom line in conjunction with a
healthy pipeline of loans and great deposit growth, the company is executing very well. The value placed on
the H&R block deal going either way is overstated and the company's fundamentals are very strong.


Focusing on purely the company's performance without H&R deal shows a clear indication that the company
is doing very well. The stock price has been relatively flat despite these strong performance metrics. For the
long-term investors like myself, the company fundamentals and not the H&R block deal going through or not
will dictate the share price. I think the deal going either way will free up uncertainty in the stock and let the
fundamentals take control of the share price.


James

This is the Waterfields suing their mother. Yep.


http://bit.ly/1z0R5gC


It is pretty much in English too.


Mom wanted to give $1.5 to Purdue University. 
Boys signed off on letting Mom take more money out of Moms's trust (from her Daddy) in 2003 (she went from getting
$100,000 to $275,000 per year - sweet huh).


In 2006 the boys figured out what the extra money was for - and sued. 
Because when she kicks it - they get what is left over. And Purdue will be up $1.5M and they won't be.


They lost that case. Mom's money.


This is the boys appealing that decision. 
And loosing again. On all counts ...


Who sues their Mom? Twice.

This is the Waterfields not paying somebodies severance pay.


http://1.usa.gov/1z0YdK5


The beauty of this one is in their excuses.


First they didn't show in court because they thought that Waterfield Financial was bankrupt so the guy would collect
zero anyway (even when he won the case).


Then just after ... Waterfield financial won the AARP arbitration and got $2.8M. 
Bummer - they had to pay the guy now they had some money. 
Did they pay him? Nope. They sued instead (better use of their money I guess). 
They claimed the "court mail was sent to the wrong address ..."


Court said "pay up, you have to tell us where you are." Hiding, apparently is not an excuse. Note to self - remember
that.


Even better ... Later dated court documents (in the BofI case) are from the first address. So they probably didn't even
really ever move the business anyway.


I want to meet these guys.


Forget that. I probably already have.

The worry here is if they are not willing to disclose this, then what else are they not disclosing. Particularly
