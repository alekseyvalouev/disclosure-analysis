Qihoo: Fake It 'Til You Make It
May 31, 2012 6:19 AM ET19 comments
by: Matt Berry


Last week Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (NYSE:QIHU) updated investors with its 2012
first quarter announcement. We now have key numbers to the revenue engine ‒ browser
usage.


Monthly active users of Qihoo 360's browsers were 273 million in March 2012,
compared to 192 million in March 2011.


That's monthly active users … and there are supposed to be 273 million of them. This is a
tough one. China ended 2011 with 513 million Netizens, growing about 12% from the prior
year. Can we then estimate that it grew 3% last quarter and not be too far off? If we were
to believe Qihoo, then the percentage of monthly active browser users to the total number
of Netizens in China would be 52% ‒ while Baidu statistics is reporting Qihoo's browser
market share to be only 21%. And if we do not adjust for China's growth, then the gap is
even wider.

Note that we are comparing Qihoo's "monthly active users" to the total number of internet
users in China ‒ the same ratio that Qihoo presented in its prospectus:


The following table shows the monthly active users for our primary security products
and platform products, both in an absolute number and as a percentage of the then
total Internet users in China … ~ Prospectus


This SEC filing then shows Qihoo's 360 Safe Browser in the table. As you can see in the
illustration below, its number was said to be 44% for January 2011; Baidu's statistics
reports it to be 1%.


I explained this market share crisis in my previous article: Qihoo's Browser: Rosy Claims
In The Middle Of A Crisis. In short, there was a "browser war" in China and Qihoo got the
worst of it. Here is a recap:


Crisis? What Crisis? From Qihoo's prospectus ...

The determined fair value of the ordinary shares increased from $5.01 per share as
of January 1, 2011 to $9.67 per share, based on the initial public offering price of
$14.50 per ADS. We believe the increase in fair value was primarily attributable to
the following factors:


• We have achieved significant business development since January 2011, which we
believe contributed approximately 70% to 85% of the increase in the fair value of our
ordinary shares.


o 360 Safe Browser and 360 Personal Start-up Page, two of our key platform
products, achieved stronger growth in their active user base than what had been
expected for the January 2011 valuation. In connection with the January 2011
valuation, we forecast that the daily active users of 360 Safe Browser would
increase 42% from the end of December 2010 to 52 million in December 2011. 360
Safe Browser's daily active users reached 56 million as of March 10, 2011,
exceeding our original year-end target in less than three months. In connection with
the January 2011 valuation, we forecast that the daily active users of 360 Personal
Start-up Page would increase 55% from the end of December 2010 to 45 million at
the end of 2011. As of March 10, 2011,…


No one is denying that market share was lost. Not even Qihoo. Here's what Qihoo had to
say in their prospectus and 2011 20-F (emphasis mine):

On November 3, 2010, Tencent issued a letter to users of Tencent QQ, Tencent's
popular instant message software, announcing its decision to disable the widely
used Tencent QQ on computers that had installed our security products, effectively
requiring users to either stop using Tencent QQ or uninstall our Internet
security products. As a result, a significant number of users stopped using Tencent
QQ, or our Internet security products, or both. Due to the large number of Internet
users that were affected, this incident was extensively reported in the media and
attracted government scrutiny. On November 21, 2010, the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology, or the MIIT, ordered that Tencent and we end the dispute,
apologize to affected users and ensure the compatibility of products concerned. We
lost some users in the first several days of this dispute before our user base
quickly returned to its prior level. ~ Prospectus and 2011 20-F


This was widely reported. Tencent is very popular and Qihoo got beat up. Caixin Online
reported,


… during hearings at the Guangdong Supreme Court, Qihoo revealed that during
those 18 hours, their user base shrank by 20 million, resulting in enormous losses.


(Caixin Online, professionally translated from Chinese, original is here)


However, the questions that concerns us right now are, Did Qihoo lie in its prospectus
about January 2011?


And crucial to answering that question is the answer to this one: How fast did Qihoo's
user base return "to its prior level"?


I ask because ... Baidu and CNZZ both provide evidence that Qihoo's browser user base
did not recover in time for the crucial month in the prospectus: January 2011. Here is a
chart from CNZZ.


How can we be sure that Qihoo's browser market share had not returned by the key
month in the prospectus ‒ January 2011? Look at the simultaneously inverse gains and
losses of market share for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) IE browsers and Qihoo's 360

browser:


As you can see, a large share of the market was suddenly available for Microsoft to pick
up at the precise time that Qihoo's numbers drop. No surprise there; Qihoo itself admits to
the date of this drop. But note that Qihoo takes back the numbers at precisely the same
time that Microsoft loses them.


According to Qihoo, the 360 Safe Browser eventually regained its market share.
According to CNZZ, Qihoo picked up 18% in March 2011 … which means that someone
else had to give up their share. Who had 18% to lose? Microsoft.


In fact Microsoft and Qihoo combined had 85% of the market; all other browsers were only
about 15%! Not enough for all of Qihoo's 18% market share recovery. But in any event
these other, smaller browsers not only survived but their market share was relatively flat
during this period. (here and here) There were no other players -- there was a nearly
direct trade off in market share between Microsoft and Qihoo.


And this trade off did not happen in January 2011.


Microsoft sheds 20.5% in March 2011, while Qihoo picks up 18% this very same month.
The simultaneous … mirror image trade off in market share gains and losses
between Microsoft and Qihoo serve as an independent verification of the date of
Qihoo's recovery. And it was not January 2011.


To believe otherwise you have to say that Microsoft and CNZZ and Baidu were all in a
conspiracy against Qihoo.


Do we still need to ask if Qihoo lied in its prospectus about January 2011?


If "monthly active users" "as a percentage of the then total internet users in China" means
market share, then Qihoo's presented numbers cannot be true. If the words do not mean
market share, then the numbers are not useful and, given the absence of an adequate
explanation, they are misleading. Qihoo said they had 44% in January 2011. Baidu and
CNZZ put them down for about 1%.

How did Qihoo claim to be "market leader" in Sept. 2011 if they weren't referring to market share?


If otherwise, they certainly do not clear up the matter, leave wording that fosters misunderstanding, and do
not offer explanations to let investors know exactly what they mean.


It is all too easy to think of their vague wording as "market share." They let this misunderstanding run freely.
But no matter what the definition of "monthly active users" they were reduced to 1% market share in the
devastating "browser war" -- while claiming robust business -- at this precise time -- in their prospectus
numbers.

actually every PC has IE embedded, but you can't say IE has 100% market share, right? 360 Browser has high
recognition and reputation among Chinese users, if you really know China..... You can doubt the company's long-term
growth, but it's not a fake story

Author’s reply »  "actually every PC has IE embedded,"


Really?


"but you can't say IE has 100% market share, right?"


Right. That's not market share. Merely "embedded" (IE, dormant) software is not necessarily the same thing
as "active user." Qihoo claimed "monthly active users"


Qihoo claimed last september that it dominated the market. How can you dominate the market without having
superior market share?


Misunderstandings are left alone -- Qihoo needs to explain.


" 360 Browser has high recognition and reputation among Chinese users, if you really know China..... "


Qihoo has a reputation for inserting backdoors into their software : http://bit.ly/KZFbcL 
http://bit.ly/KZFp3y


Widely published article just came out (in Chinese). I had it translated. First paragraph reads:


"Recently, Qihoo 360 has made high profile announcements regarding their entry into the domain of
smartphones via a partnership with Huawei--in reality, a scheme to gain entry into the mobile internet market
by having their software pre-installed on Huawei cell phones. However, Qihoo 360's long-standing infamy for
its "back door" has caused Huawei phones under the partnership to suffer from the negative affiliation. Today,
Qihoo 360's back door problem has once again come to the surface and is receiving much attention from the
online community."

... 
"  In 2010, antivirus-maker Rising, having a rout at the hands of Qihoo, announced to the press that Qihoo
360's software contained a "back door." Soon afterward, Rising also made public Qihoo 360's software
decompilation code, which was used by numerous experts in the industry to prove that Qihoo 360's back door
did in fact exist, inciting a large number of media outlets to begin following the story.


  Admission that a piece of software contains a back door is tantamount to admitting the software is
malware, so even though a large number of software engineers had proven the existence of the code, Qihoo
360 denied that their software contained a back door."

so, i can only say you don't know China. If you look at tencent, you know QQ right? You'll also find lots of
similar arguments on it in its early years. And do you know PR? do you know the purpose of these articles
you thought are all telling you a truth? If have change, suggest you talk with some Chinese internet users

Regarding 'leave wording that fosters misunderstanding', I think this will help you to understand.


Here is how market share is constructed taken from Wikipedia: 
'The percentage of a market accounted for by a specific entity.'


In the case of internet browsers, the entity used is most likely to be usage (I don't know how Baidu calculated it but I
guess that's up to you to find out). So market share is: 
usage originating from browser x / total usage.


Suppose a user of qihoo goes to work, and wants to use qihoo's browser, but found out that the work PC doesn't
allow other softwares to be installed, and he is limited to only use IE while at work. You see my point?


So it is not sensible to equate monthly active user and market share.

[definition]


This is a double distraction: The issue was never “What is the real definition of market share”?


1.The key point of the article is whether or not Qihoo lied in its prospectus. You have created a pseudo point,
distracting away from the key point, ‒ a point which you have not even touched. 
2. Besides the above, another issue is what Qihoo means with their numbers: Were investors left to believe
that the numbers meant market share and were they used as evidence of competitive advantage?

We know what market share is. We also know that the numbers that Qihoo uses cannot possibly refer to
market share. Your comments are in agreement with mine. The difference between us perhaps is that I
believe investors were misled. Are you saying that Qihoo has made it clear that all along its numbers did NOT
refer to market share? If yes, then we disagree.


Since you ignored the reference, I repeat it. Qihoo, 2011 third quarter announcement: 
"Our browsers' user penetration hit a record high of 57%, effectively becoming the market leader in
September."


How do you become a market leader without superior market share? Qihoo clearly misled investors.


Also, in the prospectus:  
“The following table shows the monthly active users for our primary security products and platform products
… as a percentage of the then total Internet users in China … 360 Safe Browser … 44.1%”


Why divide the “monthly active users” by the “total internet users in China” unless you want your readers to
think of this as Qihoo’s share of the market? Why say that you are cutting a slice of a pie when what you
actually present them is not pie?


Qihoo’s explanations are inadequate. It is their obligation to explain their data. Your offering to explain what
“market share” really means is a strawman argument. The question is, What did QIHOO mean?


Later Qihoo tones their claims down. Too late. The damage has been done.


>>>>Suppose a user of qihoo goes to work, and wants to use qihoo's browser, but found out that the work PC
doesn't allow other softwares to be installed, and he is limited to only use IE while at work. You see my point?


You describe the INACTIVITY of Qihoo’s products as if this is good news. Your personal attempt to fill the gap
in Qihoo’s inadequate explanation does not redeem the misunderstanding. How does the UNSTATED greater
inactivity of Qihoo’s products not render their STATED monthly activity meaningless? Software sitting dormant
on the computer is not a useful metric to tout in your SEC filings. So why put it there?


Also, if “monthly active user” includes the users' greater INACTIVITY relative to the competition, how can the
greater RELATIVE inactivity add up to being the “market leader,” as Qihoo claimed for Sept. 2011?


Using your example/methodology: If 1% of the time the average user worked with Qihoo and 99% of the time
the average user worked with OTHER browsers ‒ Jan 2011 -- how would you or Qihoo count this in a
prospectus? This is exactly what happened with Qihoo in Jan 2011.

Numbers are just numbers, it is up to you to judge what the manager says. Your article's title suggest qihoo is
lying, which I am not convinced.


My example was only to demonstrate user does not equate to usage, and usage is what market share is
based on, and you kept saying they should be the same.

Number are really just numbers. You are saying if user number is not market share then it is useless, and
qihoo used it in their report is misleading to investors. But the thing is, all internet companies use these
measurements, and they are not equal to market share. With your logic, I think you should report fraud on
Google too: Google reported their Google+ has nearly 100m users, but their market share is 0.5% (world
social network user base 1.2b).

So, do you conclude that Qihoo pulled the wool over Deloitte's eyes? Or are they complicit in this fraud?


31 May 2012, 05:26 PM


Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I do not know if "Deloitte" is complicit, negligent, incompetent, unconcerned, … or whatever.
("Deloitte" = network, Shanghai branch, etc.) I will say this however. Some might trust the Deloitte brand and
therefore they trust Qihoo. I work from the other end. I trust the facts. (1) CNZZ and Baidu report that Qihoo
only had 1% market share during the key month used in its prospectus: January 2011. (2) Qihoo's margins
and revenue defy logic. Consequently, I have lowered my estimation of Deloitte.


31 May 2012, 06:59 PM


Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
Let's say Qihoo stretched the truth or more likely allowed misleading statements to continue uncorrected in their
prospectus and then grew into their statements. Now what? Its May 2012. Are you presenting any evidence that the
numbers today aren't what they say they are? Are you saying leopard doesn't change its spots? As Munson asks
above, are your saying Deloitte is obligated to audit these kind of statements and missed it, or, worse, were complicit?


31 May 2012, 07:33 PM


Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  “Let's say Qihoo stretched the truth ….”


“Stretched” …!? Please re-read the article.


“… or more likely allowed misleading statements to continue uncorrected …”


… Are you running for office?


“…and then grew into their statements. “


1. I accept the logical possibility that a fraudster could bluff his way into a lot of cash and then in time, pull
back the grandiose claims, make a more moderate lie calculated to LOWER expectations, accept severe
losses in net worth, be VERY lucky, and then eventually settle down into legitimacy. However, this is not the
way of human nature and so I hold it to be improbable. Most fraudsters increase the gap between their claims
and their assets as time passes … they can’t help themselves and investors almost never forgive
disappointment.

2. “Grew into their statements” … ONE YEAR from the date of the filing of the aforementioned prospectus,
which evidence suggests is bogus, Qihoo claims a 200% INCREASE in revenue? If Qihoo was capable of the
big lie just one year ago, what responsible conclusion could you make that they “grew into their statements”
and not that they’ve got another year’s worth of gullible investors to lie to?


“Now what? Its May 2012. Are you presenting any evidence that the numbers today aren't what they say they
are?”’


1. Jan. 2011 was a part of the 2011 20-F. The latest SEC annual we have. It was filed 2012-04-19 ‒ last
month. 
2. The power of a forensic fact does not diminish with time. The date is irrelevant. 
3. The browser and its default “start up” page are key players in Qihoo's revenue. The above presentation
shows some serious problems with Qihoo's browser data, and thus the revenue Qihoo claims to have
generated from it is highly suspect.


“As Munson asks above, are your saying Deloitte is obligated to audit these kind of statements and missed it,
or, worse, were complicit?”


How is Deloitte relevant to the facts and conclusions presented in my article? My article made no mention at
all of Deloitte. Perhaps if you (or Munson?) were more specific?

Andrew Shapiro, Contributor
I am not saying this leopard has or could or would change its spots.


I was asking whether there was any support, like your historical illustration, in the present that refutes qihoo's
present representations and that they are committing current fraud on the market.


As for my Deloitte question, - If they are complicit, fraud here will be infinitely more difficult to discover and
prove. If just negligent, then they may wake up and smell the coffee.

Whether Qihoo is cooking its numbers or not is something I leave to the author to comment on. From my perspective,
almost any SHORT Chinese company is a right move at the moment for various, very simple, reasons: 
1. The world economy is in recession. This is affecting EVERYONE, including China and including "active users" of
Qihoo... 
2. The Chinese economy is slowing down rapidly. Today's Chinese Manufacturing PMI as well as Chinese HSBC
Manufacturing PMI prove it further. 
3. Numbers is China are cooked all over the place, all the time. They publish what they want to publish. Whether
Deloitte is the relevant auditor - or any other respectable accounting firm - is meaningless when it comes to Chinese
data (from both corporate and governement point of views). I wouldn't buy into Qihoo numbers either way! 
4. China WILL NOT become the greatest power in the world. It simply can't be, due to its childbirth policy (=far more
males than females) and birth rate (which is not sustainable to keep up with its recent years growth rate of 9%-10%).

5. PC Internet browsing had picked already (same say long ago...) and everything move to the mobile devices, where
there are many other solutions, players, options...; this is an ongoing move that only intensifies. Look what it did - and

You are very interesting. 
You only got the statistics about 2010.11-2011.2 . In that time QIHU changed “browser's user-agent” to make that the
user can visit tencent's services normally. So it could be not true,dig deep.

It seems to me that QIHOO has absolutely no way to measure this "market share" or "active users" number. How
would they do it? The only way to tell is ask some sites with big traffic to count - that would be Baidu. But qihoo
probably thinks its own website is representative of all internet and probably counts its own traffic - no surprise then
that its own browser leads the way. But is their portal the biggest in China? Sure, yes, if you believe their own
numbers.

Qihoo bases all of its numbers on iResearch, which is independent of Qihoo. These types of articles imply or
outright claim that iResearch is lying, and hold up its ties to Focus Media and Neil Shen as their only
evidence. iResearch has cookie and other tracking systems in place on many Chinese sites and is used as a

Well, you skipped over more that did have Qihoo in it. First, hao.360.cn is owned by Qihoo -- it's the main
landing page they sell advertising on. Also, the top websites listed were all growing enormously in 2011... no
websites that were really up and running in 2010 or before are included, you can even see that some were
not launched until 2011. If you go here: http://bit.ly/NzNYpW You can see their pre-IPO discussion, which
includes a list of Qihoo software making the #3, #4, and #8 most common programs used among iResearch
participants in Jan 2011.


What else would you want to see from them? Their actual numbers are proprietary and not open to the public,
so it's a bit hard to send links to the month-by-month data from them.
