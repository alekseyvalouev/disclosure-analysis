DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE! 


Shares of Shockwave (SWAV) have been “electric” since their IPO in March at $17 per share.  Shares 


scorched higher, reaching over $65 in June before backing off along with the rest of the market.  More 


recently shares have been mainly trading in the low 40’s.  Despite a recent 40% pullback, we expect 


continued weakness in shares of Shockwave Medical (SWAV) in the short-term (1 – 3 months) as lockup 


expiration approaches on September 3rd during a seasonally soft quarter for a stock that appears priced 


for perfection even at these levels.  We examined several acquisitions of companies similar to SWAV and 


found shares to be currently overvalued by at least 40%. 





IPO Stats 


SWAV was a hot IPO that was priced above its initial range of $14-16 and jumped 79% the first day of 


trading.  This immediately put the company’s value at double its previous valuation round just a few 


months prior in December 2018.  By July it was one of the top three hottest IPO’s in 2019 along with 


Beyond Meat (BYND) and MMTec (MTC).  MTC is a microcap that has since dropped over 80% and is 


now below its IPO price of $4.  BYND has been largely driven by short covering but is now, like SWAV, 


about 40% off its peak.  The rebate fee for BYND is currently 58%, making it very expensive to borrow 


shares to short, but for SWAV the cost to borrow is very reasonable.  It only costs 5.3% to short shares of 


SWAV. 





5.7 million shares were offered in the SWAV IPO and the greenshoe added another 855k.  20.6 million 


insider shares will become freely tradeable on lockup expiration.  Including options and warrants there 


are over 28 million shares outstanding which means SWAV’s market cap is currently over $1 billion for a 


cash burning business that has guided for only $38 to $40 million in sales for 2019. 





IPO Date: 3/7/2019 


Price: $17 


Shares: 6.555 million (includes full shoe) 


Gross proceeds: $111.4 million 





IPO investors are already sitting on returns well in excess of 100% in under six months, but for insiders 


the returns are far higher.  SEC filings reveal that the price for existing shareholders, who represent the 


majority of shares, averages $7.44 per share.  This means that at current prices insiders are sitting on 


gains over 400%.  These shareholders will be able to sell upon lockup expiration in about a week on 


September 3rd.

Although SWAV is in the early stages of growth, we shouldn’t expect 3rd quarter revenue growth to be as 


strong as the first couple of quarters.  The company said as much on their 2nd quarter conference call.  





“We do expect some seasonality in Q3 due to the summer holidays internationally and 


in the U.S.  So – but we do still expect sequential growth and then seeing the growth 


pick up significantly again in Q4.” 


~CFO Dan Puckett, SWAV Q2 transcript 





They obviously expect any slowdown to be short lived and based on seasonality, but if you own the 


stock you have to wonder if it’s worth holding a stock priced for perfection going into a weak quarter 


post lockup expiration.  





 We found it interesting that the company is already seeing signs of seasonality in their business.  This is 


not something that small, high growth companies that are just beginning to tap a market typically see.  It 


could be a sign that in some markets they are already reaching saturation.  In fact, the CEO alluded to 


seeing seasonality in the most recent earnings call. 





“What’s encouraging about broad acceptance of coronary also puts us a little bit 


earlier on the seasonality trend then maybe other companies at our stage…it seems 


predictable that we will be seeing it.” 


~CEO Doug Godshall, SWAV Q2 transcript 





Valuation 


After accounting for $110 million in net cash at the end of the most recent quarter, SWAV’s enterprise 


value (EV) is currently just north of $1 billion.  That’s a very lofty valuation for a company projecting $38 


- $40 million in revenue this year that expects to lose money “for the foreseeable future.”  And even 


though medical device companies are well known for lofty EV/Sales ratios that often reach 5x or more of 


sales, SWAV’s current 25x EV/Sales ratio seems extreme.  Upside appears limited in the short-term.  If 


you don’t own it, we’d recommend waiting for valuation to improve and the dust to settle.  If you do 


own it, we recommend selling here and revisiting it in a few months. 





Why The High Valuation? 


One possibility for the current valuation is the recent purchase of Corindus Vascular (CVRS) by Siemens 


for $1.1 billion in early August.  We’ve written negatively on CVRS in the past, and although they were 


ultimately able to achieve an exit we note that the stock first fell by nearly 40% after our piece in 


October 2017.  And there are several points worth considering regarding the acquisition of CVRS as you 


compare it to SWAV.   





For one, investors in the CVRS IPO didn’t do very well.  This doesn’t bode well for SWAV if you are a new 


investor.  Corindus went public in May 2015 at $3.80 per share and Siemens paid $4.28 per share.  


That’s only a 12.6% total return over five years, or 2.4% per year on an annualized basis.  Those are 


returns more akin to government backed bond yields than high risk small cap stocks.  In exchange for 


that performance CVRS shareholders had to experience gut wrenching lows below 50c per share before 


eventually getting bailed out by Siemens.

As we can see in the chart below, prior to the IPO CVRS traded on the OTC at $4.25 per share.  Many 


early investors were lucky to get out at breakeven.  On a side note, we don’t believe Corindus should 


have ever been a public company.  They consistently missed estimates by extremely wide margins, 


doubled shares outstanding over 5 years to over 200 million, and burned through millions ultimately 


ending with a $235 million accumulated deficit. There was essentially no path to profitability as a stand-


alone company, and that’s probably why they sold.

SWAV shares are already baking in a similar takeout valuation, but there are key differences between 


the two.  For all its faults, and there are many, CVRS has one major thing going for it that SWAV doesn’t 


have.  CVRS is a robotics platform that the interventionalist can use to perform peripheral artery disease 


(PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD) procedures, and they can do so remotely.   





While we’re still likely several years away from this kind of advanced technology becoming 


commonplace in the cath lab, it makes perfect sense for a company like Siemens to acquire this 


technology for development.  They have the financing and ability to withstand years of losses that 


Corindus could have never endured as a stand-alone entity.   





The point here is that Corindus is a futuristic robotics PLATFORM.  Over time the platform’s capabilities 


and procedure types should improve and expand.  What appeared to be a silly idea for a microcap

company like Corindus to tackle makes much more sense for a company like Siemens.  For Siemens the 


losses are a rounding error, but if they pull it off, it could eventually become the standard for many 


types of vascular procedures. 





On the other hand, we have Shockwave.  It’s already valued like a Corindus, but it’s not really a 


“platform” in the same way as Corindus.  Shockwave’s Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) System specifically 


targets calcified plaque.  Sure, they are taking a new approach to tackling the problem of calcified 


plaque, but will it become the standard or simply another tool in the bag of the interventionalist?   





The point is that in the long-term, this is more of a niche product that could be more susceptible to 


direct competition.  By all accounts Shockwave’s IVL System is novel, easy to learn, and appears safe.  


It’s ease of use is perhaps its greatest advantage to gaining market share.  But at the end of the day, 


they are focused on a specific subset of PAD and CAD for calcified plaque.   





By the company’s own estimates (424B4 pg. 1-2) 30% of the most common CAD procedures 


(percutaneous coronary intervention), involve calcified lesions.  In PAD they believe it’s about 50%.  This 


implies that for over 50% of the CAD and PAD market their device isn’t necessary.  This doesn’t mean it’s 


not a big addressable market, just probably not as big as CVRS’s market. In the long-term the potential 


probably isn’t as great, but it’s already valued like the two are equals.  We feel upside is limited in the 


near-term for investors, and these are very different companies with different technologies that aren’t 


all that comparable.   





Where they might relate is in the amount of cash they’ll need to burn through before reaching 


profitability.  Our bet is that, like Corindus, Shockwave will have to go through at least a few lean years 


while they burn through a couple hundred million dollars while they prove the technology and build out 


the market before “hitting it big.”  During this period, we expect current shareholders to see significant 


downside.     





Better Valuation Comparisons for SWAV 


We found several acquisitions in the space that SWAV is competing in that provide a broader 


perspective of the potential takeout value for SWAV’s current business.   





1) FoxHollow Technologies: 


FoxHollow marketed an atherectomy device for PAD used to remove calcified plaque.  This is the same 


market that SWAV’s IVL System is currently approved for in the US.  It was called the SilverHawk and is 


now owned by Medtronic (MDT).  In June of 2007 Ev3 acquired FoxHollow for $780 million.  Prior to the 


acquisition FoxHollow was on pace to do well over $200 million in sales in 2007 primarily related to its 


SilverHawk device. 


Multiple of Sales: 3.9x 





2) Pathway Medical Technologies: 


Pathway also marketed an atherectomy device for PAD used to remove calcified plaque.  It was called 


JETSTREAM and is now owned by Boston Scientific.  In April 2011 they announced they had a “banner” 


year with 21% growth in the first quarter.  In August of 2011 Bayer acquired Pathway for $125 million.

The deal was essentially a bust since investors had put $130 million into the company.  The company 


was private, but we do know that they never turned a profit. 


Multiple of Sales: unknown 





3) Bayer Interventional: 


Speaking of Bayer, their interventional unit that included the JETSTREAM atherectomy system was 


acquired by Boston Scientific in 2014 for $415 million. In the year prior Bayer Interventional sales were 


$120 million and the acquisition not only included Pathway’s JETSTREAM device but the AngioJet 


Thrombectomy System and Fetch 2 Aspiration Catheter.  


Multiple of Sales: 3.5x 





4) Heart Technology: 


Heart Tech created the Rotablator, another device now owned by Boston Scientific used to remove 


vascular plaque deposits.  In 1995 Boston Scientific acquired Heart Tech for $500 million ($842 million 


on an inflation adjusted basis).  At the time it was expected Rotablator would have sales near $80 


million, or $135 million adjusted for inflation.  In this New York Times article discussing the acquisition, 


an analyst is quoted as saying that it is “challenging to remain independent. The product has to be really 


spectacular to even stand a chance.”  Another analyst noted that the price paid by Boston Scientific was 


“pretty steep.”   


Multiple of Sales: 6.25x 





5) Spectranetics: 


In June of 2017 Philips acquired Spectranetics for $2.2 billion.  Like SWAV, Spectranetics was also 


focused on the CAD and PAD markets, but their devices were not focused exclusively on calcified plaque.  


At the time Spectranetics projected $283 to $306 million in revenue.  Spectranetics devices included the 


Turbo-Elite, Turbo-Tandem and Turbo-Power laser atherectomy devices, the AngioSculpt and 


AngioScultpX scoring balloons, the Stellarex drug-coated balloon and several others.  Spectranetics is 


probably the least like SWAV amongst this group because it had a far larger, more diversified product 


line. 


Multiple of Sales: 7.5x 





Where financials were available, we could see that these companies were consistently unprofitable, 


cash burning entities.  It appears that to go it alone, even as a moderately large company relative to 


SWAV, is extremely difficult.  Based on this, it seems likely that SWAV awaits a similar fate.  This puts 


pressure on management to eventually find a buyer and that pressure will likely compress the multiple.  


Average Multiple of Sales of Acquired Companies: 5.3x 





SWAV’s Current Multiple of Sales: 27x

Growth Is Solid, But Cash Burn Is A Concern 


Revenue is growing strongly, but off a very small base.  1st quarter revenue of $7.3 million was a 450% 


increase over the same quarter in the prior year.  In the 2nd quarter the company recognized $10 million 


in sales, a 339% increase over the same quarter in 2018 but the stock has since sold off on these results.  


So far, the growth is there but it’s also more than factored in with valuation over $1 billion.  Despite the 


strong growth, SWAV has a long road ahead to reach profitability.  Currently, they lose more than the 


sell.  In the 2nd quarter on $10 million sales they lost about $10.6 million. 





 
Source: SWAV Q2 10-Q, pg. 4 





The bigger issue is cash burn.  Post the IPO SWAV currently had $125 million in cash at the end of the 2nd 


quarter, so cash isn’t a problem, for now.  They also have a bit over $15 million debt but that is entirely 


manageable given their assets.  The company has stated that they “expect to incur losses for the 


foreseeable future.”

In 2018 prior to the IPO they burned through over $41 million in cash, so the $110 million in cash net of 


debt on the balance sheet will go pretty quickly, especially as they ramp expenses for clinical trials and 


SG&A.  We estimate that SWAV is on pace to burn through close to $30 million in the back half of 2019.  


That will leave them about $80 million net of debt for 2020.  Sustaining the current burn rate will leave 


them with about $20 million net of debt by the end of 2021.  It’s quite possible the burn rate could be 


higher.  





The Cash Runway 


We like to think of a cash burning business as an airplane that’s trying to take off as it’s approaching a 


quickly eroding cliff.  The business is the plane, the eroding cliff is the cash.  If the plane can’t take off 


(generate cash) before it reaches the end of the cliff, it’s “crash and burn” for investors.  But there is a 


way to avoid running out of runway and it’s really ingenious when you think about it.   





The company can create its own “currency” and issue more of it whenever they need more cash. This 


“currency” is what we typically refer to as shares.  Cash burning businesses typically issue shares 


whenever they are close to running out of “runway” (cash).    





Of course, there’s a hitch.  All currencies are backed by something, and in the case of a company the 


currency is backed by ownership in said company.  Issuing more shares dilutes ownership and 


diminishes share value.  In many cases, especially for small companies like SWAV, this doesn’t end well 


for early investors.  This is the best SWAV’s cash position will likely be for some time, and we would 


expect them to raise more in perhaps a year or two to extend the “runway.”  Any raise would have a 


dilutive effect on current shareholders and might cause a sell off. 





Tough Competition 


Shockwave’s devices specifically focus on vascular calcification, which the company claims represents 


somewhere between 30 – 75% of specific procedures and although they have a novel approach, it’s 


worth noting that there are several large players in the space with competing products already on the 


market.  This doesn’t mean these solutions are better or worse.  For calcified lesions options generally 


include scoring/cutting balloons and atherectomy.  Another option is to use a stronger stent like 


Abbott’s Supera.  Competitors in this space include Boston Scientific (BSX), Cardiovascular Systems 


(CSII), Medtronic (MDT), Philips (PHG) and others.  Some competing devices in calcified lesions include 


the following: 





1. Philips Turbo-Elite Laser Atherectomy Catheter

2. Philips AngioSculpt XL PTA scoring balloon catheter 


3. Cardiovascular Systems Diamondback 360 Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System 


4. Medtronic TurboHawk Peripheral Plaque Excision System 


5. Medtronic SilverHawk Peripheral Plaque Excision System 


6. Medtronic HawkOne Directional Atherectomy System 


7. Boston Scientific ROTABLATOR Rotational Atherectomy System 


8. Boston Scientific JETSTREAM Atherectomy System 


9. Boston Scientific FLEXTOME Cutting Balloon Dilatation Device 


10. Abbott Supera Peripheral Stent System 





For some procedures these devices may be better and others they may be worse than Shockwave’s IVL 


System.  In other cases, they may be used in collaboration with IVL.  The point is simply that this is a 


highly competitive space where very small Shockwave is going up against the big boys.  Will Shockwave 


become the first option for calcified lesions or simply another tool in the bag?  At this point it’s safe to 


say the jury’s out, but the stock’s valuation seems to imply it’s a slam dunk.   





SWAV bulls can argue that there are greater risks to patients when these other devices are used, 


including perforation, dissection, embolization, restenosis and others.  This is likely true based on early 


results, but according to interventionalists more studies are needed before conclusions can be made.   





One major difference between atherectomy and lithotripsy is that atherectomy removes the calcified 


lesion.  Lithotripsy cracks the lesion but leaves it in place.  We suspect that one potential disadvantage 


of Shockwave’s IVL System is inferior performance for drug eluting stents (DES) or drug coated balloons 


(DCB) vs atherectomy because calcified plaque can act as a barrier to local drug delivery.  Simply 


cracking the plaque and leaving it in place may not allow the drug to penetrate the vascular wall to 


prevent restenosis, but this is speculation on our part. 





Patent Concerns 


Cardiovascular Systems (CSII) has requested inter partes review of three patents covering SWAV’s IVL 


Technology. The USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board has decided to review the patents and SWAV’s 


response is due in October 2019.  Although these patents are at risk, SWAV has other patents that cover 


their technology and they have stated that they are not concerned about the viability of the business.  


Out best guess is that the loss of these patents could decrease the number of years before patent 


expiry.   





Abiomed Collaboration 


Concurrent with the IPO, SWAV raised an additional $10 million at $17 per share from Abiomed (ABMD).  


Abiomed was an existing investor and is collaborating with Shockwave.  Beginning in December 2018 


Shockwave’s products are being integrated into Abiomed’s physician training and education programs.  


Abiomed should be a good partner for SWAV and is a natural way for their devices to be introduced to 


the cath lab.

For those who feel we’re being overly pessimistic, we disagree.  Although Shockwave is a highly 


speculative early stage company, we feel they have a novel device for treating calcified plaque and 


should continue to gain market share over time.  But a successful company is not the same as a 


successful investment.  At current levels SWAV appears rich in what the company expects to be a soft 


quarter.  Investors are facing lockup expiration in about a week on September 3rd and insiders are sitting 


on 400% gains due to the stellar early performance of the stock.  These shareholders may look to exit on 


lockup expiration and put further pressure on shares.   





We simply feel shares have gotten ahead of themselves and expect downside in the near-term.  In 


addition, the company is in a highly competitive market.  SWAV is losing money and will continue to do 


so for the foreseeable future by their own estimates.  The cash position is the best it’s likely to be for 


some time and we expect them to raise more money in a year of two.   An equity raise will dilute current 


shareholders.   





Companies in this space have a long history of consistent losses and this is likely a byproduct of a highly 


competitive market against much larger competitors.  Companies like SWAV are often acquired by larger 


companies, but at far lower valuations than SWAV’s current valuation.  We expect that over time, 


management will feel pressure to partner up via acquisition but it’s likely that they will have to go it 


alone for a while to collect clinical data and prove the market.  Based on an examination of prior similar 


deals, we believe a potential suitor is unlikely to pay the current 27x multiple on SWAV revenue.  We see 


at least 40% downside to shares as outlined below: 





To value SWAV we add a 25% technology novelty premium to their valuation.  We also assume the 


company hits the upper end of guidance this year and grows revenue 150% next year to reach $100 


million. Our sales multiple of 5.3x is based on our analysis of past acquisitions of companies similar to 


SWAV outlined above.  We believe this valuation is more than generous given the uphill battle new 


companies face when entering a highly competitive market. 





SWAV’s 2019 revenue guidance: $38 - 40 million 





SWAV valuation based on our assumptions = (5.3 sales multiple) x (1.25 tech premium) x ($100 mil in 


2020 sales) = $663 million   


SWAV current valuation = $1.1 billion 





This valuation implies SWAV is overvalued by 


approximately 40% for a price target of $23. 
 


Our growth assumptions could prove to be overly optimistic.

Shockwave makes medical devices used to treat calcified vascular disease commonly referred to as 


atherosclerosis.  Atherosclerosis is a common affliction that progresses as we age which causes arteries 


to become narrowed and hardened as tissue, fat and calcium is deposited in and around arterial walls.   





Typical treatment involves inserting pressurized balloons to expand the blood vessel.  Once expanded a 


stent may be put in place to hold the vessel open.  Calcified lesions are particularly difficult to treat 


because they can prevent balloon expansion.  Current solutions include cutting/scoring balloons and 


atherectomy.  According to Shockwave, these methods increase risks to the patient and require more 


surgeon skill. They also only focus on calcium lesions within the vasculature and have no impact on deep 


(medial) calcium within the vascular wall.   





Shockwaves solution focuses on deep (medial) and superficial (intimal) calcified lesions both in and 


around the artery.  Instead of scoring, cutting or sanding the calcium, they use a minimally invasive 


intravascular lithotripsy system to break calcium deposits within an artery to restore blood flow. 





Similar to angioplasty, a balloon is inserted to the site of the calcified plaque and inflated with a fluid.  


Once inflated the IVL system sends and electrical current through the catheter that produces sonic 


pressure waves at specific points along the site of the plaque.   These waves crack the calcium into 


several smaller sections making it easier to expand the vessel to increase blood flow.  Soft tissue is 


unaffected.  Lithotripsy is a proven technology that has been used to break kidney stones, which often 


consist of calcium, for over 30 years.   





Initially SWAV is targeting peripheral artery disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD).  Eventually 


they also plan to target aortic stenosis (AS).  Shockwave estimates that the total addressable market 


(TAM) in PAD is $1.7 billion and the TAM in CAD is $2 billion.  Shockwave has achieved FDA clearance 


and a CE Mark for their M5 and S4 catheters to treat PAD.  They have a CE Mark for their C2 catheter to 


treat CAD.  They do not have FDA approval to treat CAD but are conducting clinical trials.  They 


anticipate potential FDA approval in CAD by the first half of 2021 and a Japanese Shonin approval by 


mid-2022.
