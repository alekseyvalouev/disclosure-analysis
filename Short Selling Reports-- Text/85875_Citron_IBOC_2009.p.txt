Bank on the Brink: International Bancshares

This past Friday the FDIC seized 3 more banks to bring the total for 2009 up to 20. What
are the telltale signs that a bank is on the brink? Citron believes that International
Bancshares (IBOC) is doing more than just giving signs; it is screaming out that
something is really wrong Deep in the Heart of Texas.


Loans on the Books


When analyzing any bank you have to start with the loan portfolio. Below is the loan
breakdown on IBOC:


From 2004-2008, almost all of the growth of IBOC’s book of business is construction
lending, with the greatest increase occurring in 2006 and 2007, obviously the high-water
mark of the real estate bubble. Commercial, mortgage, and consumer loans are actually
down from 2004. What is even more alarming is that 73% of these construction loans —
nearly $1.4 billion, mature in the next 12 months.

In order to compare apples to apples we thought it would be fair to make some
comparisons to another regional bank in Laredo/San Antonio region, Cullen/Frost
Bankers, known as Frost Bank (CFR)


CFR has grown their loan balances across all areas with no measurable concentration
in construction loans. In stark contrast to IBOC’s exposure, which is over 250% of
tangible book value, CFR’s construction loan balance is less than 100% of tangible book
value. Next, note that CFR’s allowance for bad debt is 10% of its construction loans,
compared to IBOC, which has reserved at a rate of only 3% on its construction loans.


Of even greater concern, Citron examined the publicly-traded institutions that took
between $100 million and $500 million of TARP funds, a group of 43 companies. We
found one startling statistic: IBOC had the highest ratio of construction loans to total loan
portfolio, and yet they had lowest loan loss reserve rate for that loan class. 


Assessing the market


Especially in light of IBOC’s severe lack of disclosure (see below) investors are left to
judge the financial health of IBOC on their own. Naturally, attention turns to the
underlying conditions of the real estate construction market in the bank’s specific region.
Don’t take our word for it, just last week the Texas Fed declared the state is officially in a
recession. 


And if you think it does not affect Laredo, just listen to the local news. 


Wikipedia lists construction projects in Laredo, Texas. Citron called the local Chamber of
Commerce in Laredo — EVERY single one of the proposed/under construction projects
listed in Wikipedia above has been cancelled or postponed.


Here is one project for which IBOC is lead lender that just went into foreclosure a few
weeks ago.

Here is another major construction project funded by IBC that went into foreclosure also
last month. 


Lastly, here is a project where IBC was the largest creditor and they ended up
purchasing the project themselves out of foreclosure.


If Citron was able to find these with a simple Google search, imagine what else is really
out there? Citron suggests that IBOC management will not likely part with this
information voluntarily. Company management does not host conference calls, and the
detailed disclosure about its loan portfolio is seriously deficient, especially in the midst of
the financial environment of 2009.


Management:


Criticisms of the company’s practices, and in particular, the extravagance of the CEO’s
expenditures including Citation jet and high salary, have come from places as near as
their local newspaper. 


Largest shareholder and director Tony Sanchez is extremely influential in the operations
of the bank. Incredibly, he was also the head of Tesoro Savings and Loan, which folded
in 1988, leaving taxpayers with $160 million bill.


While the company took $216 million of taxpayer money during the last week of
November, Sanchez, along with the CFO Imeldo Navarro, cashed in close to $20 million
worth of stock in the following 3 weeks. The insider dumping has been ruthless as
recently as March 5, where Sanchez registered and began selling 800,000 shares of
stock, at the low of the market. Citron is incredulous that companies accepting TARP
money can allow their insiders to dump stock on the market in the same month …but we
don’t make the rules. 


Additional Red Flags to Consider – Disclosure Failures


Large amount of related party loans — $79.4 million as of IBOC’s recent 10-K


No disclosure of the breakdown of their loan portfolio


Company does not hold any conference calls

its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and

to help you offset volatility.

Conclusion


The obvious question of the day is what impact the new Treasury troubled asset
program will have on IBOC’s untenable situation. In the opinion of Citron, the new
program only accelerates the day of reckoning for IBOC’s “living-in-denial” strategy. The
new program brings price discovery to bad assets, and IBOC has not even begun the
process of disclosing the writedowns that would threaten its solvency. Meanwhile, while
investors look to datapoints like the status of commercial construction projects in
Laredo, insiders keep stamping out stock sales.


It is unavoidable that someone at IBOC has a lot of explaining to do, but if history
repeats itself, don’t expect an explanation from the company. When in doubt, follow the
money. It flows from the taxpayers’ of the United States, through the “black hole” of the
bank’s balance sheet, and directly into the insiders’ pockets via their relentless insider
stock sales. The money flow is the clearest “tell” of all — from those who really know
what is happening Deep in the Heart of Texas.


Cautious investing to all.

CEO Nixson should respond to these perceived problems. I am a stockholder and now feel
very concerned about my investment. I am a retired regional banker. Looking forward to
management's commentsJerry
