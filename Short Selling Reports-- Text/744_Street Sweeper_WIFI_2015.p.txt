Boingo Wireless: Why This Stock Will Soon Fall
Oct. 8, 2015 1:59 PM ET1 comment
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Shelf Registration: Boingo recently cleared the way so it can sell about 15 million
shares, posing looming dilution of current stockholders’ shares.


Insider Selling: Executives are selling company stock like mad, suggesting a lack of
confidence in Boingo. The CEO and chief financial officer alone have unloaded
about 150,000 shares since June.


Accelerating Competitive Risk: Free mobile Wi-Fi offered by airports, coffee shops,
hotels and telecom companies pose an ever-growing risk. Also depends on freely
available open-source software and unlicensed spectrum.


Terrible Finances: Shareholders’ 2014 losses of $0.55 per share are expected to
worsen to $0.77 per share this year.


Angry Customers: Many upset customers have logged complaints about Boingo on
consumer complaints website complaintsboard.com.


Boingo Wireless (NASDAQ:WIFI) is all dressed up for the ball, jitter-bugging in white
loafers while the competition coolly waltzes away with the belle of the ball.


Try as it might, the Wi-Fi hot spot provider has been slightly out of step since its founding
in 2001.


Indeed, Boingo has racked up ~$63 million in losses and faces these ongoing investment
risks:


Shelf Registration: Boingo recently cleared the way so it can sell millions of shares,
posing looming dilution of current stockholders' shares.


Insider Selling: Executives are selling company stock like mad, suggesting a lack of
confidence in Boingo. The chief executive and chief financial officer alone have unloaded
about 150,000 shares in the last four months. Five insider sales have occurred in the past
few weeks.


Accelerating Competitive Risk: Free mobile Wi-Fi offered by airports, coffee shops,
hotels and large telecom companies pose an ever-growing risk to Boingo's business.

Nothing Special: Boingo depends on open-source software and unlicensed spectrum to
provide Wi-Fi - both available to everyone.


Terrible Finances: Shareholders' 2014 losses of $0.55 per share are expected to worsen
to $0.77 per share this year.


Institutional Disdain: Top institutional firms ignore Boingo as even insignificant
institutions are selling out their Boingo positions.


Cushy Compensation: Despite investors' horrible returns, Boingo executives hit multi-
million dollar jackpots.


Excessive Complaints: Boingo suffers from extensive customer complaints reported on
consumer complaints website.


Boingo declined TheStreetSweeper's request for comment, but investors may find other
viewpoints here.


Meanwhile, let's look at the reasons we're convinced overvalued Boingo is poised to
dance away current stockholders' hard-earned money.


Angry: Customers


Many upset customers have logged complaints about Boingo on consumer complaints

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3560026-boingo-wireless-stock-will-soon-fall 3/14


"When it comes to Boingo, it's way way worse than "accidental" charging. 
I paid for their one-day pass out of desperation since I usually don't give out my
credit card details online, one year ago. 
ONE YEAR AGO. Since then, I have clicked "Cancel" and closed down the
GoBoingo! pop-up whenever it shows up. Since there was no setting for disabling
the pop-ups (fishy fishy!), and since I had no intention of using the service ever
again save for emergency, I went into my computer settings and made sure Boingo
wouldn't automatically start up. 
So you can imagine my surprise when, going over my account bills for the past three
months - this would be about 10 months after originally using the Boingo "service" - I
see four separate charges from Boingo Wireless."


"I have just discovered that I have been charged $9.95 on my credit card for 3
YEARS. 
ONCE I used Boingo in an airport in Houston, TX. I had to think very hard to even
remember this. I have been charged every month since that time. 
When I called Boingo to discuss, they acted as if this was the first time they'd ever
heard of such a ridiculous thing happening."


"Boingo is deceptive and makes fraudulent charges. Boingo deliberately conceals
aspects of the "As you Go" $7.95 24-hr. access charge for web connection at U.S.
hotspots."


"After signing up to use Boingo wireless for one day at an airport, I continued to incur
charges of $7.95 on my credit card bill. They claimed that I continued to use their
service, which was false. This appears to be a common complaint. No one should
use Boingo wireless. Hopefully boingo.com will be held accountable."


" … they did the same thing to me and refused to refund the extra charges. I live in
FL, but "Bogus" Boingo Wireless is based in South Santa Monica, California. I wrote
the attorney general there and asked him to investigate Boingo business practices.
I've also filed a complaint with the FL state attorney and the CA Better Business
Bureau. That's not all, I am on a mission. I bought ihateboingo.com I am currently
working on the website. Boingo needs to be exposed, they are conducting the same
business practices that Blockbuster had attempted and looked where it took
Blockbuster."


Killer: Competition

Boingo's business primarily revolves around "DAS." DAS or Distributed Antenna System is
an antenna network installed in convention centers, office buildings, etc., to access the
wireless network at peak times. Competing venue-based options include small cells.


AT&T and Verizon are the DAS giants. AT&T annually installs hundreds of its systems in
stadiums such as the Dallas Cowboys stadium, campuses, airports and other venues
across the country.


Verizon used its own DAS recently at the Daytona International Speedway, as well as
various football stadiums.


T-Mobile and Sprint are other rivals, along with competitors such as Proximity, ExteNet
Systems, Accu-Tech, SeamlessCellular and many more.


Here's how CEO David Hagan described the way Boingo works in the DAS segment - a
lengthy process he said is usually a 12-month cycle:


"We've all been to stadiums, where you can't do anything, right? You can't even get a text
through. And so literally all these venues are getting built out. So our strategy is neutral
host. We partner with the venue. And then we reach out to the carriers and trying to get all
the carriers on to a venue."


Meanwhile, DAS may be deployed by carriers themselves such as AT&T, by neutral third-
party providers (which sometimes pits carriers against third-parties vying for a venue, or
carriers turning to the third-party to rollout DAS at that venue), or by building owners or
managers.


Boingo offers Wi-Fi to Sprint customers in 35 airports, yet in the rapidly changing Wi-Fi
world, agreements can go by the wayside. And, as Boingo notes in its filings (page 17),
well-heeled partners can become competitors, and competitors like to snap up venues.


Boingo adds: "Some of our competitors have taken steps or may decide to more
aggressively compete against us, particularly in the market for venue build-outs of Wi-Fi
and DAS solutions."


So, AT&T and numerous others are scooting over the DAS dance floor, pushing Boingo
and friends out of the way with each step.


Special: Competitive, Technological Risks


Other major competitive and technological concerns facing Boingo investors include:

TECHNOLOGIES - Competing technologies such as 4G, WiMAX and Super Wi-Fi are
gathering momentum to push out use of Wi-Fi, much like DVDs made video tapes
obsolete.


NOTHING UNIQUE - Boingo uses open-source software. Open source licensing terms
could ultimately force Boingo to attempt to buy licenses, re-engineer its software or even
discontinue operations.


Boingo also uses unlicensed spectrum to provide Wi-Fi. Everybody can use the same
unlicensed spectrum.


FREE, FREE, FREE - Perhaps the greatest near-term, ongoing risk to Boingo is this:
Airports, coffee shops, hotels and other places give customers free mobile Wi-Fi.
Telephone companies, too, sweeten their home broadband services by offering free
mobile Wi-Fi. These practices are becoming more and more common, upping the
debilitating risk to Boingo over time.


Those and other issues have clobbered another Wi-Fi hot spot company with similar
revenues and losses called Novatel Wireless. We warned investors about Novatel in
February, here, when the stock was $5. The stock has collapsed in half since then:

Ditching: Insiders Just Sell Boingo


Boingo insiders are yelling "Sell! Sell! Sell!"

Other than cheap option executions, not one executive has purchased one single share of
company stock on the open market in months.


Selling frenzy participants include the chief executive officer, operations vice president and
the chief financial officer.


CEO Hagan is left with ~448,000 shares after dumping almost 100,000 shares since June.
Also, Senior VP Operations Tom Tracey has dumped 12,500 shares since June, including
5,000 in recent weeks.


CFO Peter Hovenier has unloaded blocks of 10,000 shares at a time to dispose of more
than half his shares since June, leaving him with just over 56,000 shares.

Insiders are selling even with the stock down nearly 3 bucks since August. The stock chart
below reflects insiders apparently saying, "This is much less than the stock fetched weeks
ago, but $7 to $8 is high enough for me."


(Source: Nasdaq.com)


So, the executives and directors - the very people who know better than anyone about the
company's prospects - are rapidly selling company stock. That can't be good news.


Institutional Firms: Selling Out Positions


Third-tier and no-name institutions have shown far more interest in Boingo than first-or-
second-tier firms.

And even these small institutional holders are beginning to race for the exits. At the end of
June, institutions were selling out of Boingo stock at nearly three times the rate new
positions were being established.


Graphics below depict sold-out positions versus new positions and show the exit of small
firms:

So, that's basically $16 million worth of "buy" signals weighed against $40 million worth of
"sell" signals.

Earnings Forecast: Down


Boingo earnings last year handed investors a $0.55 per share loss. And analysts -
typically an extremely optimistic group - expect losses to worsen this year … to $0.68 per
share.


Below is a graphic portrayal:


And Boingo earnings growth compares miserably to the industry. As the chart below
shows, Boingo has gone negative, as opposed to the industry.


(Source: Nasdaq.com)


So, Boingo has performed poorly from investors' viewpoint and analysts expect the
performance to slip even more over the year.


The company itself expects nothing promising earnings-wise for the year. Boingo's
guidance is a loss of $0.69 to $0.77 per share.


Key Numbers: Not Pretty


Those expectations are poor for good reason. The chart below shows how Boingo's
finances have generally weakened.

Additionally, quarterly results are announced next month. Management has guided a slight
upward tweak in revenue to $34.5 million to $36.5 million … But a quarterly net loss of
$0.15 to $0.20 per share.


At first glimpse, Boingo's cash almost offers comfort. But Securities and Exchange
Commission filings show the company must attribute most of that cash improvement to
tapping into its credit facility:

Executive Compensation: Warren Buffett's "Effortless Money" Quote Applies


While Boingo has handed investors a bouquet of losses, executives have plucked up $7.2
million in compensation.


Not bad for generating $13.7 million in net losses the first half of this year.


Here's a snapshot from the filing:

Indeed, a Warren Buffett quote springs to mind when we look at insider selling and
executive compensation.


The multi-billionaire investor once warned, "Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of
effortless money."


Looming: Secondary Offering


Talk about effortless money. Just a couple of weeks ago, Boingo positioned itself to sell up
to $125 million worth of stock.


So another stock offering looms, threatening to dilute the stock currently owned by
shareholders.


Conclusion:


Along with the preceding issues casting an ugly shadow on this enchanting ball, the
company dances amid an overvalued market cap, hideous margins and swooning returns:


(Source: Yahoo Finance)


As Mr. Buffett commented about trading such speculative stocks, "The giddy participants
all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There's a problem, though: They are
dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands."


The ball is over, the clocks now have hands and those hands are ticking like mad. Boingo
stock should soon crumple to a more realistic valuation of about $4.50 per share.


Disclosure: I am/we are short WIFI.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article.
