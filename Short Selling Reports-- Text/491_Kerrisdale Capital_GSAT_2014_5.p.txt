Globalstar: Would TLPS Even Work On Your Phone? Filtering Poses A
Major Threat To TLPS Usability

Summary


Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filters need Channel 14 to act as a guard band to prevent Wi-
Fi and Sprint's 2.5GHz LTE spectrum from interfering with one another.


The most advanced filtering technology cannot function properly without a 10MHz+
guard band.


Therefore, the technology currently doesn't exist to allow unlicensed Wi-Fi, Channel
14 communications, and 2.5GHz LTE to all co-exist within the same phone.

This graph illustrates the impact that the filters inside many mobile devices have on Channel 14


signals: dramatic degradation. These filters are tiny devices that transform radio signals by allowing


certain frequencies through but suppressing others. The y axis measures the attenuation, or


suppression, of the signal. A more negative figure in decibels corresponds to a more attenuated


signal. The x axis measures the frequency of the signal. At the high-frequency edge of Channel 14,


the attenuation would be approximately 25 decibels -- a reduction in signal strength of more than


300 times.

One of the key purported advantages of Globalstar's (NYSEMKT:GSAT) Terrestrial Low
Power Service (TLPS) is the existence of a large number of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi devices that,
according to Globalstar, have the technical ability to transmit on its channel but are
prevented from doing so via firmware. As Globalstar wrote in its initial petition to the FCC
(p. 3),

802.11 compliant hardware is already capable of utilizing 802.11 Channel 14 with a
device firmware modification. This means that TLPS will benefit from a substantial
existing ecosystem, which can be utilized almost immediately.


Though "[m]ost if not all TLPS access points," in Globalstar's words (p. 42, footnote 105),
"will be newly manufactured equipment" under the control of a hypothetical "network
operating system" that will supposedly prevent interference to the company's satellite
customers, no one envisions TLPS-specific user devices. Instead, the dream put forth in,
for example, Globalstar's October 9 attempt to rebut our arguments, is that it will only take
"several months" following the finalization of the TLPS rule to enable the service in
popular devices like the iPhone.


Globalstar has neither the means nor the right to create, let alone disseminate, these
firmware updates, which would be specific to individual manufacturers and device models.
The manufacturers, likely in collaboration with chipset vendors, would have to choose to
undertake this work, for no apparent reward. Though this practical hurdle to deployment is
indeed serious, here we focus on a different concern: Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filters.
Assume that an iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S5, or other popular user device did indeed
receive a firmware update that freed it to transmit on Channel 14. The problem is that
hardware filters inside many of these devices would severely impair the resulting signals.
In some cases, like the Avago filter shown above, a filter would attenuate the signal by a
factor of >200x before it even left the phone. Needless to say, this would degrade the
performance of TLPS, especially relative to Globalstar's ludicrous hype, and in some
scenarios could render it unusable. The entire point of these filters is to suppress
transmissions that lie outside of their "passbands," meaning the range of frequencies that
pass through the filter largely unscathed; since much of Channel 14 does lie outside of
their passbands, it's no surprise that the results could be disastrous.

Why has Globalstar never discussed (or perhaps even noticed) this problem? One likely
reason is that it has never actually tested TLPS using real user devices, at least according
to its experimental-license applications to the FCC, which have only mentioned access
points, not user devices like phones or tablets. In its recent ex parte letter responding to
some of our concerns, Globalstar did not even claim to have tested user devices,
speaking only of "access point transmissions" (p. 2). Without even attempting to connect
real devices to TLPS APs - perhaps because it has been unable to properly modify third-
party firmware for which it lacks the source code - Globalstar would be unlikely to come
across this problem. But it would obviously loom large in the mind of any potential partner.
After all, why pay billions for TLPS if the most popular mobile devices in the world can
barely use it?


Nor is there any easy fix. While we believe that similar coexistence filters would also
impair Channel 14 transmissions from many access points - indeed, even on the Ruckus
access points that Globalstar purportedly used for some of its testing - the impact is
potentially mitigated by Globalstar's intention to deploy custom APs (albeit at higher cost).
For user devices, however, the story is different. The filters used to prevent Wi-Fi signals
from interfering with nearby LTE bands are already high-performance, state-of-the-art
devices, yet it's already difficult for them to achieve the required signal rejection given how
narrow of a window they have to work with. (A very informative presentation submitted to
the FCC by a filter industry group characterized the 2.4GHZ Wi-Fi band as "very hard" to
handle given the tight spacing between it and the LTE bands on either side.) Channel 14
effectively is the guard band between the 2.4GHz ISM band used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and the neighboring higher-frequency LTE bands, like the Sprint-dominated Band 41
(2496-2690 MHz) - just as Globalstar's 1.6GHz uplink spectrum acts as a guard band
between GPS and other navigation frequencies and LightSquared's uplink band. In both
cases, Globalstar's bands have highly unattractive neighbors from the perspective of a
terrestrial deployment - a logical outcome since they were never originally intended to
serve that purpose. With so many shortcomings and technical challenges, TLPS has no
hope of warranting the $3 billion valuation that the equity market has given it. Globalstar
remains dramatically overvalued.


I. What Is Wi-Fi/LTE Coexistence?

The Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK provided a good summary of Wi-Fi/LTE
coexistence problems in a recent press release announcing its new "high-performance
WLAN-Bluetooth filter for smartphones":


RF spectrum is a limited resource and with the continuously growing number of
communication services it is becoming ever more densely populated. In particular,
the WLAN and Bluetooth band between 2400 MHz and 2483 MHz is separated by
just ≤20 MHz from the new band 7, 40 and 41 that are used for LTE cellular service.
Thanks to the new filter's excellent insertion loss and high out-of-band selectivity, the
B8831 is able to prevent the signals in the adjacent WLAN/Bluetooth and highband
cellular bands from interfering with each other.


But TDK is far from the first entrant into this market. For years, Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO)
and TriQuint (TQNT), which is on the eve of combining with RF Micro Devices (RFMD) to
form a new firm called Qorvo, have dominated the world of high-performance RF filters,
including Wi-Fi coexistence filters - and their stocks have delivered excellent returns along
the way. As early as its February 2011 investor day, TriQuint flagged Wi-Fi coexistence as
a key opportunity:

And the final piece, 4G wireless LAN coexistence. Sprint came out with basically 4G
WiMAX, but then wireless LAN capability in terms of personal hot spots, and then
was also looking to do it in phones. And what we're seeing is any type of application,
whether it be a mobile application or a fixed network application, that puts those two
together creates opportunity because the frequency spectrum is so close to each
other, you need very, very tight filtering requirements now at very high frequencies to
be able to handle that. And that's created an opportunity with our BAW filtering
technology and leveraged a lot of our growth here this past year. (Source:
Bloomberg transcript of TriQuint 2011 Investor Day, February 23, 2011)


These comments echoed those of other organizations. In March 2010, the Bluetooth
Special Interest Group released Filter Recommendations for Coexistence with LTE and
WiMAX, noting that "based on information from the filter manufacturers shown in Appendix
B: Available Filter Performance, a reasonable bandwidth of such a guard band [between
the 2.4GHz band used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and neighboring LTE bands] is 20 MHz,"
though it noted that "some WiMAX deployments" - now undergoing conversion to LTE -
"start at 2496 MHz which reduces the guard band to 16 MHz" (p. 9). As this language
shows, filter-makers disregarded the barely used, vestigial Channel 14 (centered on 2484
MHz), characterizing it as part of the guard band and making no effort to preserve its
functionality. In December 2011, the global telecom consortium 3GPP, which develops the
rules for LTE, released a technical report on "in-device coexistence," drawing in part on a
prior study by Motorola that assumed the use of a high-performance, Channel 14-
impairing Avago ACPF-7024 filter. IWPC, a telecom industry group, published a study in
April 2013 examining RF Front-End Architectures for 2.3-2.7 GHz 4G Global Roaming
Devices; the study concluded in part that "LTE bands can be adequately protected from an
in-device Wi-Fi radio by a single post-[power amplifier] filter on the Wi-Fi device with 40-45
dB rejection" (p. 85). 40-45 dB equates to a factor of 10,000x to ~32,000x signal
attenuation - an enormous degree of "rejection." Given that Channel 14 lies right between
the Wi-Fi band that these filters are designed to let through and the LTE bands they are
designed to protect with massive amounts of rejection, Channel 14 is firmly and
unavoidably in the cross-hairs.


Though different device models contain different filters, it's clear that the high-performance
filters that do the greatest damage to Channel 14 are widespread. For example, in 2013,
TriQuint announced that its LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence filter was included in Broadcom's
reference designs for 802.11ac mobile devices. In 2014, it announced yet more wins:

TriQuint also launched a family of three high-performance filters to solve challenging
Wi-Fi / LTE interference issues. Utilizing TriQuint's bulk acoustic wave (BAW)
technology, these advanced filters enable customers to extend Wi-Fi ranges while
meeting stringent spectrum regulations worldwide. TriQuint has already secured
multiple design wins for these filters in Wi-Fi access points, home media gateways
and automotive infotainment markets.


TriQuint specifically touted one of its new models, the 885070, as the "first BAW filter to
provide guaranteed band-edge rejection in restricted FCC bands at 2390MHz &
2483.5MHz." In other words, this filter is guaranteed to wipe out the entire upper half of
Channel 14.


Because filters are small (e.g. the ACPF is 1.6x2.0x0.95 millimeters) and sometimes
unlabeled, "teardown" analyses in which engineers take apart new mobile devices to
examine their components sometimes overlook them (see footnote 1 below). Nonetheless,
semiconductor analysts have identified high-performance Wi-Fi coexistence filters in many
popular devices. For example, in April Barclays identified an Avago "WLAN coexist FBAR"
(a specific type of filter) in the Samsung Galaxy S5:

In September, Barclays also identified TriQuint "WLAN co-exist" filters in the
US/Canada/Europe and China/Other versions of the iPhone 6, an increase over the
iPhone 5S/5C, where it identified such filters in only a subset of models.

These much-scrutinized, best-selling devices are not unique in their reliance on strict
filtering of the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band. During TriQuint's April 2014 earnings call, its CEO
noted that "the Wi-LAN business associated with co-existence filters, that's our fastest-
growing product line right now." Not just user devices but access points now boast more
selective filters. Aruba, for example, advertises "advanced cellular coexistence," while
Ruckus notes that it too employs a "2.4 GHz ISM filter" (slide 11).


In short, Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filters are pervasive in mobile devices as well as access
points. They're needed in order to prevent Wi-Fi and LTE interfering with one another.
Because Channel 14 is effectively unused, filter-makers have not attempted to protect it in
their efforts to keep the 2.4GHz ISM band and neighboring LTE bands from harming one
another. As a result, any device that contains such filters will perform poorly and
unpredictably when set to Channel 14 - even if a firmware modification allows it.
Depending on the filter in place, the impact could be drastic.

To estimate the impact of coexistence filtering on Channel 14, we have used data sheets
from the filter vendors TriQuint and Avago, drawing on the performance graphs that they
provide in order to zero in on the expected level of attenuation within the bounds of the
channel. Since filter performance varies based on temperature and other factors - and
even varies from one tiny unit to the next based on small fluctuations in the manufacturing
process - these are only estimates. But they highlight yet another enormous practical
headache for any TLPS deployment - one that, as usual, Globalstar has never publicly
acknowledged.

passband only, while the reduction in out-of-band emissions is called "rejection.") Since
measurements in decibels can be unintuitive to those without RF experience, we also
express the insertion loss as a straightforward ratio.


In most cases, at the center of Channel 14, the attenuation is ~3 dB, equivalent to a
halving in signal strength. By the edge of the channel at 2494 MHz, however, the
attenuation in all cases becomes extremely severe, ranging from ~12.5 dB (18x reduction
in signal strength) to ~26.9 dB (491x reduction in signal strength). The effects of
attenuating some of the subcarriers within the channel by large amounts and others by
less are difficult to predict without conducting extensive real-world tests, but at a minimum
these reductions in signal strength would greatly limit propagation - ironic given
Globalstar's insistence that TLPS would boast superior range over conventional Wi-Fi.


Below we show the performance graphs for each device, highlighting the relevant zone for
Channel 14. (The ACFF-1024 was already illustrated on the first page.)

III. Conclusion


TLPS is a veritable onion of badness - the more one peels it, the more flaws are revealed.
Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filtering is a major threat to its ultimately usability, let alone
commercial viability, especially for mobile devices released over the last several years.
Globalstar's failure to conduct real-world testing with actual user devices has left it open to
exactly this sort of problem. Equity investors may be inclined to ignore such concrete
technological issues in favor of buying into a puffed-up narrative, but no rational business
would.

Footnotes


1 Brean Capital's TriQuint analyst Mike Burton made this point in his October 29 piece on
TriQuint, "So Much for Teardowns," writing, "As expected, Apple was the main revenue
driver, with the big story being TQNT's filter business, as discrete filters are set to triple in
2014…Since the first iPhone 6/6+ teardowns appeared, investors have been concerned,
and some of our competitors even went so far as to write that TQNT had lost content in
the new iPhone 6, as there were no TQNT markings visible on any components. However,
in light of TQNT's optimistic guidance, we assumed that either there was content we could
not discern from the teardown, or there were multiple SKUs for each phone, or both. We
now believe that there are multiple SKUs AND that TQNT has discrete, high-margin, filter
content on the new iPhones."

Pretty simple.


I haven't looked into this but it makes total sense. We know that Channel 13 and even Bluetooth overlap with
the lower part of Channel 14. If the upper part is clipped by filters that seems like a very valid concern that
should be addressed.


So let's have it.

the point. The only complexity comes from documenting and explaining the point, which is obscure because
normal Wi-Fi systems never run into this kind of problem.


It's not the FCC's job to think up all the issues with GSAT's TLPS business plan. That's GSAT's job, which it
has done very poorly. It has never even sought FCC permission to run real-world tests using actual user
devices, and it has no meaningful experience with Wi-Fi or non-satellite-based mobile devices. (No, Sat-Fi
does not count as "meaningful." How many units have actually been sold?) It does not appear to have anyone
on hand with practical Wi-Fi expertise. So it wouldn't be strange at all for practical issues to crop up that
GSAT never considered. Alternatively, perhaps it has considered this problem but chose not to inform its
investors or the FCC. That's also possible.

Interesting from a Broadcom patent:


http://bit.ly/1uTYFLS


"Accordingly, in certain scenarios, the frequency separation between WLAN and LTE may be less than the 25 MHz
separation required by the IEEE 802.11b standard. For example, there may be a frequency separation of less than 20
MHz in the case where WLAN transceiver portion 110 is operating on channel 14 and where an LTE signal is being
transmitted over uplink channel 112 at a frequency of approximately 2500 MHz. Thus, when an LTE transceiver and a
WLAN transceiver are transmitting signals in close proximity to each other (as in the case of LTE transceiver portion
108 and WLAN transceiver portion 110), the two transceivers may interfere with one another in the absence of
synchronization. "

I think there are vested interests, as likely aligned with development/ perpetuation of Iridium's constellation (utilizing
inter-satellite links and controlled via only two "gateways" on the ground - in Hawaii and Arizona) who seem intent
upon disparaging their competition. Iridium's constellation can provide service literally anywhere on planet Earth,
whereas Globalstar best serves habitable parts of the world, connecting seas and isolated regions accessible yet
abundant in mineral/natural resources (say 95% of the planet). Globalstar has 24 gateways and uses a "bent pipe"
architecture where most processing of calls is done on the ground, at the gateways - the satellites essentially serving
as mirrors bouncing signals between gateways. Countries with gateways of course have an interest in seeing those
gateways remain in service, providing beneficial communication coverage in isolated regions, yet a degree of local
control over call processing. In a sense, the Globalstar system thus seems fundamental superior - redundancy of
gateways and ground-based processing seemingly less expensive to operate and repair, with so much technology
ground-based. Yet Globalstar's configuration is thus best suited to peaceful coexistence among countries where it's
gateways are located and which it serves. Perhaps those envisioning a less peaceful future between nations find the
Iridium design concept superior and perceived as more secure, since for example, during a period of conflict, Iridium
phones could still be used literally anywhere, even in otherwise devastated, war-stricken areas, dependent only on
the Hawaii and Texas ground stations remaining secure and functional. Globalstar's system requires and facilitates

multi-national cooperation as an ongoing process in maintaining its gateways; less so for Iridium, phones of which can
presumably be used (as in military/intelligence functions), even in geographic areas where local authorities might
prefer that didn't occur. Both systems are amazing technological achievements and the success of either system need
not be contingent upon failure of other. I hope they will be allowed to peacefully and economically compete with one

Good points. The looming problem with Iridium, however, is that they are in the same place GSAT was a few
years ago... i.e., their aging satellites are going to start falling out of the sky, and it will take the better part of a
decade and $billions to replace them. I would not count Iridium out, however. There are indeed advantages
for government/military apps, as pointed out in this article. Thus, there may be a case to be made for
coexistence as a matter of national security, but that certainly doesn't negate the value of TLPS, at least not in
the short term. Also, I concur that this is just more jargon-ware from KC, which by now is probably soiling its
collective britches over their failure to drive GSAT down to where it needs to be to suit their short thesis. Bye-

It's worth recalling that Samsung's principal request of the FCC in the TLPS proceeding has been for the FCC to
adopt "a streamlined permissive change process, rather than require recertification and new FCC IDs for updated
devices." Doesn't that suggest confidence that current phones should generally work well with TLPS after a software
update? 
I'd be curious how the Kerrisdale thesis re filtering interrelates with Wifi use of channel 14 in Japan. Do manufacturers
sell phones with a different filter into Japan than anywhere else? Or is channel 14 performance substantially degraded
there relative to other channels as a result of filters?

Author’s reply »  The Samsung reply comments (http://bit.ly/1thpRzA) are 1.5 pages long (double-spaced)
and attributed to a couple of US subsidiaries; we see no reason to believe that Samsung overall has studied
this particular issue in any depth.


Even in Japan, under the 802.11 specification, Channel 14 is limited to 802.11b, a standard that dates back to
1999; it also requires a special regulatory license. See, for instance, Cisco's Enterprise Mobility Design Guide
(http://bit.ly/1thpPaO), p. 3-2: "The FCC (U.S.) allows for 11 channels, ETSI (most other parts of the world)
allows for up to 13 channels, and Japan allows up to 14 channels but requires a special license to operate in
channel 14." In reality, channel 14 is at best vestigial even in Japan; the usage is close to zero, though it's
hard to tell exactly how much there is (and even in the US the usage is not exactly zero -- it's easy to find
intrepid Americans who hack their Wi-Fi routers to run on Ch 14 only to find that most of their devices can't
connect). Consider the Ruckus ZoneFlex 7372, allegedly used by Jarvinian in its testing for Globalstar --
using the default firmware, it only runs on channel 1-13 (http://bit.ly/1thpPaR) even in Japan. Or consider the
Cisco 3700 series (http://bit.ly/1thpPaV) -- Ch 14 isn't offered in any regulatory domain, even in Japan. Clients
don't decide what channel to operate on; APs do. So if APs don't support Ch 14, clients won't use it either,
leaving the question of how impaired the connection would be unanswered.

These coexistence filters aren't selling like hot cakes because device-makers just have an urge to include
them. They're selling like hot cakes because they're necessary. And they're not designed to be compatible
with operations on Ch 14. The only question is which exact filter models are in which exact devices. But
they're obviously out there in size. With respect to Ch 14, if you've been led to believe that Ch 14 is widely
used in Japan, that's not actually true.

Ladies and Gentlemen, My company sells Iridium, Inmarsat, KVH, Thuraya and Globalstar so I have a different view.
Full disclosure: I'm long IRDM, KVH and sold GSAT at $3.86.


While Globalstar's bent pipe is architecturally superior - in terms of call quality, ease of use, etc - the fact remains that
people are not buying the phones and service. We've done seven activations this year compared to hundreds on the
other networks. I see three fundamental problems: 
1) While it sounds great to talk about the 'most modern satellite constellation', the GEN2 services will not be available
until the ground stations are upgraded and there is a new handset that is GEN2 capable. $$$$$. Last I checked,
Globalstar was a little short on cash 
2) The 2007 constellation degradation enraged tens of thousands of subscribers and despite the fact that the service
is restored and it works great - really, it does - people have not recovered from the burn, so we've activated seven
new units this year. Keep in mind prior to 2007 we had thousands of subscribers, now hundreds 
3) In my humble opinion - right, wrong or otherwise - A: Globalstar will run out of time and money before the FCC will
even approve TLPS (if they will), and B: I am still not seeing how TLPS is monetized. Personally, I have never had
any problems using Wi-Fi anywhere it was offered and rarely have not been able to use my cell phone as a hotspot.
I'm just not seeing the subscription model. 
4) Bonus.... My understanding is that if spectrum is allocated to Wi-Fi ten the satellite phones will not work in those
areas. Kind of defeats the point.

them. And it helps not to have burned some bridges with degraded services just after announcing a brand new

Keubiko, Contributor
Thanks for the insights Lou.


I personally don't give a hoot about the satellite business as that is a rounding error - nearly all of the market
cap here is driven by the belief that TLPS is somehow a good idea and that the spectrum has a lot of value
just because other, different (mobile / LTE) spectrum is worth a lot.


I find it ludicrous that people look at the AWS-3 auctions as being comparable to Channel 14 of Wi-Fi.


As you correctly point out, TLPS, IMHO, is a bad solution to a problem that doesn't exist, wrapped in an ugly
balance sheet.


We are really talking about a replacement for your little Wi-Fi hotspots and ethernet cables. Who would
honestly pay for that connection that works fine anyway.


The "2.4ghz is crowded" argument seems moot, as 5Ghz 802.11ac has a ton of technology added to the spec
that deals with these issues.


Who needs it? Who would pay? Specifically? Nobody seems to be able to answer this question.


I am in charge of IT at my company, in an office building where I can see 30 hotspots, and wouldn't pay for
this in a million years, and have no issues even running old (non 802.11ac) hotspots.


It seems the answer to "who will pay" is simply "someone" or "lots of people" or "tech companies" or "who
wouldn't pay".


Some idiot even tried to argue that Amazon would pay so their customers could order products over their own
Wi-Fi channel. WTF?

Then assume that you're a big business, processing thousands (or millions) of transactions daily, but you
have to share the channels with every tweeny-bopper on the planet chatting about last night's date or that
new party dress. And what if the coverage was spotty and only worked sporadically? Would you maybe
consider paying for a clean (licensed) channel that was all yours AND that was protected from interference by
the FCC? And, the cost of which you could easily amortize and pass along to your customers?


OK, you're an IT person, so 'real-time' and 'deterministic' mean little or nothing to you -- I get that and deal
with it all the time. But I work in the control systems field, where things have to happen in real time and with a
predictable and verifiable (deterministic) outcome. We don't generally use WiFi in mission-critical control
systems for all of the reasons outlined above and more. However, some systems (like 'smart' utility meter
reading systems, for example) use channels that may be shared by things like garage door openers and HAM
radios.


These are not typically mission-critical apps, so if a meter read occasionally gets clobbered or dropped, you
just re-read that meter -- the world doesn't end. Conversely, if it was a signal needed to trip a breaker and de-
energize a power line that a crew is about to repair, that's quite a different scenario. The world may not end...
but someone's life very well might!


Transaction processing is not as critical as control systems, but far more critical than say, running a payroll.
Transactions (think Amazon) are critical enough that you don't want to be plagued by interference, corrupted
messages, and flaky operation any more than you want evil-doers hacking into your payroll program.
Therefore, paying a nominal fee for a private (licensed) channel is a pretty cheap insurance policy. I hope this
adds some perspective to help you comprehend why TLPS is both needed and valuable.

Let's think about that in a TLPS context. If I were in a hotel on their "flaky" Wi-Fi, how is it that I would have
access to the TLPS channel? Where would the hotspot be? Would the hotel be providing TLPS service and
then that narrow channel would just get swamped? In that context it's like saying hotels will go from offering
13 channel 2.4Ghz service plus all the 5Ghz channels, to adding a single 14th channel. I see zero chance of
that happening.


Or do you think that TLPS hotspots will just be rolled out everywhere so you'll have one just across the street
from the hotel? Please. Who would roll that out for a single narrow 2.4Ghz channel?


Here's what would happen in the hotel example:

1) Hotels offer tiered access - they do this now - so much bandwidth for free, and pay more for a bigger slice.


2) Hotel would increase density of hotspots with 802.11ac that are designed for high density coexistence.
Kerrisdale's World Series analogy is a great example.


3) The bottlenecks in hotel internet access do not relate to Wi-Fi, it's the backhaul.


4) What I would do in such a context is switch to the LTE network.


A hotel adding TLPS makes no sense, so *someone* would have to deploy a network close to the hotel.
That's basically building out a full national network for a single 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi channel which makes zero
economic sense to me. And that's without the interference issues that have been highlighted (lower bound of
Channel 14 overlaps with channels 12, 13, and Bluetooth, plus a slew of other things like microwave ovens)
and upper end is impacted by RF filtering.


>>Then assume that you're a big business, processing thousands (or millions) of transactions daily, but you
have to share the channels with every tweeny-bopper on the planet chatting about last night's date or that
new party dress.<<


No, you're only "sharing the channels" with those in the immediate vicinity of your Wi-Fi access point.


I concede that if a business wants to put a data center in Starbucks and process millions of transactions over
the Starbucks Wi-Fi, and Starbucks or someone outside of the Starbucks offers a TLPS network that no other
TLPS customers can then use, it might be worth paying something north of zero for it.


26 Nov 2014, 01:36 PM


mam1347
The hotel case was just an analogy -- NOT an example of proposed TLPS usage. Sorry if that wasn't clear.


The value someone is willing to pay for TLPS is going to be directly proportional to the criticality of the intended
usage, which will vary widely across business sectors (obviously hotel WiFi is NOT in that class), but I think there are
plenty of very large users who will be ready to whip out their checkbooks for this kind of access if/when that
opportunity presents itself. I'm betting my money that not only will it be a hot property commanding a premium price,
but that there will be a bidding war over who gets access and at what cost.


We'll see when the FCC acts (as I hope it will soon), and this hyperbolic debate about TLPS value will finally be over,
once and for all...

I understand. You were pretty clear. What I am trying to figure out is the demand that is not an analogy - i.e.
who, specifically, would pay to build such a network, deploy such infrastructure, and who, specifically, would
pay to use it.

"Plenty of very large users" is pretty vague.

I don't think it will. I assume the FCC will allow it. But this isn't like an FDA hearing where you approve a
blockbuster drug and then reap the billions. The FCC won't underwrite a ludicrous business plan - someone
with very deep pockets would.


It seems the best hope is to have the FCC allow TLPS, and then try to convince "someone" to actually want to
deploy it, economically or otherwise. This is where I *think* it fails.


But I could be wrong.

<Plenty of large users is pretty vague> 
Amazon, Cisco, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint & pick your favorite Fortune 1000 IT services company -- it's a VERY
long list with myriad purpose-driven opportunities.


<I don't think it will. I assume the FCC will allow it.>  
That's exactly what 'FCC acts' means... approval of the NPRM, which will likely come before year end.
Moreover, this is not a spectrum auction (like the one that just netted the FCC $billions) but simply a routine
regulatory process. It nether guarantees nor denies commercial success once the final rule is approved.


<It seems the best hope is to have the FCC allow TLPS...> 
This is where we are in violent agreement! Watch and see what happens when they do! Meanwhile, Happy T-
day to you & yours!!

Aye.


I never had doubt that they would show a technically function "demo". On the technical side my understanding
is they never used any devices with coexistence filters (huge problem).


Irrespective of that, even if it works, and even if approved, I don't see much, if any, commercial opportunity for
"TLPS".


At a nearly $4 Billion valuation this thing is already priced for massive success.


I could be wrong.


Good luck.

Don't know how old you are, when I hear the comment; "WIFI is free, who would pay"


I remember when Television was free. Had free TV lately? Oh yea, in the sports bar.


Radio is free in the car. Just about every car manufacture is installing satellite radio which isn't free.


I don't know where you live, but every place I get "free" wifi, good luck getting a streaming video to work.


I guess as they say, time will tell who will "win" this tug of war!

The TV and Radio analogies aren't appropriate. You are talking about content.


Regarding getting streaming video to work where free WiFi is offered:


Let's take a Starbucks for example. You have a WiFi network in a store, connected to what? Starbucks is
currently using a 1.5Mbps T1 line for backhaul.


Take a guess as to where the bottleneck is?


The $150 WiFi router in my house (an Asus 802.11ac router from Staples) can handle 1.7Gbps, that is
1700Mbps


So when you have a 1700 Mbps Wi-Fi network, connected to a 1.5 Mbps network, where do you think the
problem is when you can't stream Game of Thrones in Starbucks?


FYI Starbucks is now rolling out standard Wi-Fi with Google Fiber backhaul:

IMHO many GSAT longs equate their poor Starbucks or McDonalds Wi-Fi experience with "Wi-Fi congestion"
when it's nothing more than a backhaul bottleneck.

So what do I do if I just really need to stream video in my Starbucks and they haven't upgraded the backhaul?
I simply use my iPad on the LTE/cellular network. What I won't do is subscribe for "TLPS"


Hotels are now offering Tiered services to customers - nothing to do with WiFi "congestion", but offering more
backhaul bandwidth to customers that need it.


All IMHO.
