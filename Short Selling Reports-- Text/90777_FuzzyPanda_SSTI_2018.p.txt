ShotSpotter – Court Case Exposes Failures of ShotSpotter 
Technology 


Executive Summary: 


The Silvon Simmons case we recently uncovered reveals the many flaws of ShotSpotter (Nasdaq:  
SSTI) and why we are short the company.  In Silvon Simmons, a police officer shot an allegedly 
armed black suspect (Simmons) in the back.  The officer & suspect had 2 different accounts of 
what happened: the officer said the suspect had a gun and fired at the officer before he shot 
Simmons in the back, while the suspect said he was unarmed and never fired at the officer.  The 
prosecution hinged their case on a ShotSpotter report saying there were 5 shots fired.  
Ultimately, the Judge ruled ShotSpotter data inadmissible, labeling it as “unreliable scientific 
evidence.” Simmons was acquitted and is now suing ShotSpotter and the police (Case - 6:17-cv-
06176-MAT). 


The ShotSpotter deficiencies that Simmons revealed included unreliable data and results that 
could be modified after the fact.  In addition, other courts have refused to admit ShotSpotter data 
because the technology has not “reached general acceptance in the scientific community” (State 
of California vs Gillard - pg 54 line 27-28), principally because SSTI has not done the work to 
get their results confirmed by independent analysis.   


The Simmons case not only casts doubt on the integrity of the company’s data, but it also sheds 
further light on fundamental problems with ShotSpotter’s technology.  For example, ShotSpotter 
initially mistook the gunshots in Simmons for the sound made by helicopter rotors. They failed to 
spot the shots.  Only when the Police Department informed ShotSpotter that shots had been fired 
did they generate a report.  That report said 4 shots were fired, so the police department informed 
SSTI of the officer’s story and requested them to look for more shots.   Then, ShotSpotter 
employees modified that same forensic report (the “evidence”) again—days after the event—to 
say 5 shots had been fired.   


This case and others have been overlooked by sell-side analysts, who maintain buy ratings and 
high price targets despite SSTI’s astronomical valuation (9.5x P/Sales). ShotSpotter has also 
changed company policies to ensure that humans, rather than their software, are reviewing & 
reporting possible shots fired.  This is perplexing, since the company markets itself as a SaaS 
business.   


Perhaps it is the flaws mentioned above that have led ShotSpotter to have difficulty retaining and 
growing their city customer base.  Even after giving the product away for free for almost a year, 
ShotSpotter was unable to convince a customer to become a recurring payer!  Fall River precinct 
decided against re-upping their contract after free service from SSTI because, according to the 
police chief, “ShotSpotter had reported too many false alarms of gunfire while missing actual 
shots-fired incidents in Fall River.”  (Source)

The Bull Case for ShotSpotter 


ShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system.  The company’s marketing materials say that the 
technology detects at least 90% of gunshots fired within their deployment zones (a year ago, that 
ratio was 80%).  Another part of SSTI’s offering is that they provide detailed forensic reports 
and expert testimony that are meant to bolster investigation and prosecution.  The overall 
viewpoint of customers is that it works—it’s just a question of how useful it is.  Some police 
chiefs love it (Baltimore) and others find that resources can best be deployed elsewhere (San 
Antonio Police Commentary).  District attorneys we have spoken to are especially fond of the 
technology, since it enables them to play the sounds of live bullet fire inside the court room.  
They say it is a powerful tool for swaying the emotions of jurors.   


The bull case on ShotSpotter is predicated on the company expanding its areas of coverage 
within existing cities, which ShotSpotter have done well so far, and on more cities signing up for 
ShotSpotter, which they have struggled to execute.  There are also long-shot hopes of a big data 
play & federal government contracts, which have failed to materialize and which the company 
now downplays (source).  Bullish investors believe that the company will finally earn an 
operating profit and generate positive FCF, something they have failed to do for over 20 years.  
Since their revenues are recurring in nature (although most are 1-year contracts), ShotSpotter has 
also gotten a SaaS company valuation multiple (9.5x sales) from Wall Street, despite the fact that 
humans are actually doing the analysis, not software.  


Enter the Silvon Simmons Case 


The cases of NY State v. Silvon Simmons and the follow-on lawsuit Silvon Simmons v. Ferrigno, 
City of Rochester, and ShotSpotter, et al (Case - 6:17-cv-06176-MAT) are an important 
challenge to the prevailing ShotSpotter investment thesis.  Not only do these cases question the 
validity of the technology’s results, but they also allege that ShotSpotter changed its report 
(“evidence”) multiple times to comply with requests from local police.  Furthermore, as part of 
these proceedings, the NY judge ruled that ShotSpotter data “was not reliable enough” to be the 
sole physical evidence in the gun possession charge against Simmons. 


Legal cases are essential to analyzing ShotSpotter’s effectiveness because the company avoids 
allowing media or investors to analyze actual data. It does this by blocking Freedom of 
Information Act Requests and avoiding subpoenas (pg 10 paragraph 44).  Thus, court documents 
and testimony provide a rare glimpse into ShotSpotter’s trade secrets & process.   


Was it 4 or 5 shots fired? A Man’s Life Hung in the Balance 


Silvon Simmons is ultimately a dispute over 1 bullet.  If there were only 4 shots fired, then 
Simmons’ story was true:  he was a defenseless black man shot in the back by a cop who has 
received over 20 citizen complaints, many for use of excessive force (Pg 38 - Paragraph 264).  
However, if there were 5 shots fired, then the cop’s story was correct: he shot a fleeing suspect in 
self-defense after Silvon had fired first.

Simmons was ultimately acquitted of attempted aggravated murder against a police officer.  He 
is now suing ShotSpotter, the police officers involved, and the City of Rochester for, among 
other things, “fabricating and falsifying evidence.” (pg 30 2018-Q3-10Q)   


Forensic evidence that supports Silvon’s story. 


• DNA evidence: Simmons purportedly used a pistol, found at the scene, to fire at the 
police officer. DNA evidence on the gun did not match Simmons’ DNA.   


• Mechanical evidence: The gun’s magazine was found empty, but the gun was not in a 
cocked-back position, as it should have been after firing the last round in the magazine. 
Thus, it is unlikely the pistol was fired. 


• Gunpowder residue request denial: Simmons asked that his clothes and hands be tested 
for gunpowder residue, both verbally in the ambulance at the scene and again in writing 
while he was in the hospital under police custody.  His requests were denied, and his 
clothes disappeared, so neither the clothes nor his hands were tested to see if he had fired 
a weapon. 


Forensic evidence substantiating the officer’s story of a 5th shot: 


• ShotSpotter: as far as we are aware, the only forensic evidence that supported a 5th shot 
was ShotSpotter’s modified forensic report saying there were 5 shots fired. 


The reliability of ShotSpotter evidence comes into question because, according to the testimony 
of ShotSpotter paid expert Paul Greene and the forensic report itself, the analysis was actually 
changed multiple times after communicating with the local police force (ShotSpotter’s 
customer).   


That’s right!  ShotSpotter “forensic evidence” was altered twice. 


ShotSpotter Change #1 – The ShotSpotter system did not catch the shots fired in real time.  The 
critical gunshots from this case were originally mistaken for sounds from a helicopter.  As a 
result, ShotSpotter only discovered the shots when Rochester PD contacted ShotSpotter and gave 
them a specific time & location of the weapon discharges.  ShotSpotter’s system failed to do its 
one core job – detect gunshots. 


Below is Paul Greene’s own testimony from the case (Paul Greene’s LinkedIn).

ShotSpotter Change #2 – ShotSpotter then reported that the Simmons incident involved 3 to 4 
shots fired.  However, after being contacted by the Rochester PD, who asked the ShotSpotter 
team to look for a 5th shot, ShotSpotter changed the report.  The final report matched the police 
officer’s testimony.

Below is evidence from the Simmons case, never before seen by Wall Street, which shows 
multiple changes to ShotSpotter’s own forensic report.  These adjustments to the evidence 
occurred in the days after the shooting.

Change From 4 Shots to 5 Shots After Police Instruction

This begs the question: what other ShotSpotter forensic evidence can be changed upon request? 


ShotSpotter Data can be Edited! 


From further testimony by Paul Greene, the expert witness for ShotSpotter, investors learn that 
subscribers (police stations) and ShotSpotter are actually able to edit the audio data.

If ShotSpotter data can be altered by multiple parties, how trustworthy is it?  


ShotSpotter’s Accuracy Claim was Invented by the Marketing Department: 


In a 2017 attempted murder trial in San Francisco, Paul Greene testified that ShotSpotter’s claim 
of 80% accuracy was invented by the marketing department. 


“Our guarantee was put together by our sales and marketing department, not our 
engineers,” Greene said.  “We need to give them [customers] a number,” Greene 
continued. “We have to tell them something. … It’s not perfect.” (source)

Is Precedent Being Set That Could Keep ShotSpotter Data & Testimony out 
of the Courts in 2 of Their Largest Markets? 


In Silvon Simmons, the NY judge ultimately ruled that the ShotSpotter data “was not reliable 
enough” to be the sole physical evidence in the case. 


In another case in California, State of California v. Todd Gillard, California Judge John Kennedy 
ruled ShotSpotter’s location data and Paul Greene’s testimony inadmissible because ShotSpotter 
has “not…reached general acceptance in the relevant scientific community”. (pg 54 ln 20-28 – 
State of California vs Gillard case No 05-164004-0).  Despite Judge Kennedy’s ruling, which 
stipulated that ShotSpotter needed to have objective studies conducted and reviewed to meet the 
general acceptance requirements of the Kelly-Frye Rule, SSTI has failed to initiate such studies.  
(pg 54 ln 1-19) 


In fact, ShotSpotter has done exactly the opposite as far as transparency is concerned.  They have 
coached cities on how to block Freedom of Information Act requests (Memo to SSTI Customers, 
Birmingham, AL denials) and have even avoided supplying data in response to subpoenas (pg 10 
paragraph 44).  Allowing the release of data would enable courts—and investors—to verify how 
accurate ShotSpotter’s technology really is. 


If you are a defense attorney looking to keep ShotSpotter data out of your courtroom, you now 
have some powerful admissions from Paul Greene at your disposal: 


• ShotSpotter & customers (Police Departments) can edit the raw audio data. 
• ShotSpotter’s accuracy “guarantee” was created by their marketing department. 
• The company will review & possibly change forensic reports after requests from police 


departments. 


Why Does This Matter for ShotSpotter’s Stock? 


To roll out ShotSpotter in new cities, SSTI needs both city governments and the public to be on 
board.  The service is a large cost for police departments’ stretched budgets, so it needs to be 
both accurate and a net benefit for the community.   


What the Simmons cases highlight is: 


• ShotSpotter’s data is inaccurate – ShotSpotter missed shots fired right off the bat and then 
changed the analysis after the fact. 


• ShotSpotter evidence is not reliable enough for some courts in California & New York – 
this makes it harder for other district attorneys to use the company’s forensic findings and 
expert witnesses in the future. 


• ShotSpotter’s flaws create reason for community activists to fight ShotSpotter 
deployments in their cities, since police & SSTI can potentially change data, leading to 
wrongful convictions.

City Expansion has Stalled out for SSTI – 2.4% Organic City Growth: 


The sales effort to get new cities on board is falling short. SSTI’s bull case is predicated on more 
cities signing up for ShotSpotter’s service; however, the number of sales to new customers 
(cities) has slowed to a crawl.  The company has added only 5 net new cities in over 2 years, 
which amounts to 2.4% annual organic city growth. 


City count in July 2016 was 90, with 4 out of the 10 largest cities in the US (link).  City count as 
of Q3 2018 was 95, with only 3 out of the 10 largest US cities.  Recent news reports published 
since show ShotSpotter has also added Toronto, Canada; and a pilot in Columbus, Ohio. 
Accordingly, we think they will report a Q4 2018 city count of 97.  


Issues brought to light by former customers compound the problems already mentioned to make 
SSTI’s sales effort challenging.  Some recent anecdotes from canceled customers: 


• Fall River, MA says ShotSpotter technology worked less than 50% of the time (source).  
Fall River Police Chief Al Dupree specifically cited that ShotSpotter missed detecting all 
7 shots from a homicide in that city. Fall River was receiving ShotSpotter for free but did 
not renew their service.  


• San Antonio, TX canceled service, saying that in 15 months, officers made only 4 arrests 
and confiscated 7 weapons that can be attributed to ShotSpotter.  The technology cost the 
city $136,500 per arrest.  (source) 


Another large risk comes from ShotSpotter having a majority of their customers on 1-year 
contract terms (pg 17 – 2018 Q2-10Q).  Thus, if dissatisfaction becomes widespread, the 
company could quickly see the number of cities and miles of coverage decline.   


Disclosure Changes – More Humans, Less Software  


SSTI markets themselves to Wall Street as a SaaS (Software as a Service) Company.  This has 
resulted in the company’s receiving a lofty valuation of 9.5x Sales.  However, in Q2 2018, SSTI 
added an additional step to its description of the Incident Review Center’s (IRC’s) reporting 
process that reinforces how their approach is, in reality, a very human-based process.  


• Q1 2018: …. If there is an interruption or delay in service from our IRC and a gunshot is 
detected but not reviewed in the allotted time, our software will send an alert directly 
to our customers. These automatic notifications, without the benefit of review by our 
IRC, may be more likely to result in customers receiving a false positive alert, which 
could cause our customers to divert resources unnecessarily. As a result, we could 
experience a decline in customer satisfaction with our solutions and our reputation and 
growth prospects could be harmed. (pg 30 – 2018 Q1-10Q) 


• Q2 2018: … If there is an interruption or delay in service from our IRC and a gunshot is 
detected but not reviewed in the allotted time, our software will queue the incident for 
off line review. This may result in delayed notifications to our customers and as a 
result, we could experience a decline in customer satisfaction with our solutions and our 
reputation and growth prospects could be harmed. (pg 32 – 2018 Q2-10Q)

These disclosures suggest ShotSpotter may not trust its “software” not to send false positive 
alerts.  False positives have long been a major complaint of the company’s customers. After 
reviewing data from 7 cities, Forbes reported that “police were unable to find evidence of 
gunshots between 30-70% of the time.” (source)  


If the company doesn’t trust its own software to automatically send alerts, then how can public 
markets give ShotSpotter a software-sized valuation? 


Conclusion: 


We are short ShotSpotter because: 


• The Simmons case alleges unreliable data & reports that can be changed after the fact. 
• ShotSpotter’s accuracy percentage is a product of their marketing department, not their 


data scientists. 
• ShotSpotter’s technology & testimony has been deemed inadmissible in certain courts in 


2 of its major markets (CA & NY). 
• ShotSpotter has made no known efforts to get independent confirmation of the validity of 


their data for court use.  
• ShotSpotter requires human analysis to prevent false positives that their software 


generates. 
• We believe 9.5x EV/Sales is an unsustainable valuation for this unprofitable company. 


The insights into ShotSpotter’s flaws gained from the Simmons case shoot holes right through the 
Wall Street bull case.

Terms of Service: 


By downloading from or viewing material on this website & by reading this report, you agree to the following Terms of Service. 
You agree that use of the research on this website or report is at your own risk. In no event will you hold Fuzzy Panda Research 
or any affiliated party, including officers, directors, employees and agents of Fuzzy Panda or any companies affiliated with him, 
liable for any direct or indirect losses caused by any your use of information on this site. You further agree to do your own 
research and due diligence before making any investment decision with respect to securities covered herein. You represent that 
you have sufficient investment sophistication to critically assess the information, analysis and opinion on this site. You further 
agree that you will not communicate the contents of reports and other materials on this site to any other person unless that person 
has agreed to be bound by these same terms of service. If you download or receive the contents of reports or other materials on 
this site as an agent for any other person, you are binding your principal to these same Terms of Service. 
  
You should assume that as of the publication date of their reports and research, Fuzzy Panda and possibly any companies 
affiliated with them and their members, partners, employees, consultants, clients and/or investors (the “Fuzzy Panda Affiliates”) 
have a short position in all stocks (and/or options, swaps, and other derivatives related to the stock) and bonds of companies 
covered in such reports and research. They therefore stand to realize significant gains in the event that the prices of either equity 
or debt securities of the subject companies decline.  Fuzzy Panda and the Fuzzy Panda Affiliates intend to continue transactions 
in the securities of issuers covered on this site for an indefinite period after their first report on a subject company, and they may 
be long, short, neutral at any time hereafter regardless of initial position and the views stated in Fuzzy Panda’ research.  Fuzzy 
Panda will not update any report or information on this website to reflect such positions or changes in such positions. 
  
This is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security, nor shall Fuzzy Panda offer, sell or buy any security to 
or from any person through this site or reports on this site. Fuzzy Panda and the Fuzzy Panda Affiliates do not render investment 
advice to anyone unless they have an investment adviser-client relationship with that person evidenced in writing.  You 
understand and agree that Fuzzy Panda does not have any investment advisory relationship with you or fiduciary duties to you.  
Giving investment advice requires knowledge of your financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance, and Fuzzy 
Panda has no such knowledge about you. 
  
If you are in the United Kingdom, you confirm that you are accessing research and materials as or on behalf of: (a) an investment 
professional falling within Article 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the 
“FPO”); or (b) high net worth entity falling within Article 49 of the FPO. 
Fuzzy Panda’s research and reports express their opinions, which are based upon generally available information, field and online 
research, and inferences and deductions through due diligence and the analytical process. To the best of their ability and belief, 
all information contained in their reports is accurate and reliable, and has been obtained from public sources believed to be 
accurate and reliable, and they have not obtained information from persons who are insiders or connected persons of the stock 
covered or who may otherwise owe any fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality to the issuer. However, such information is 
presented “as is,” without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.  Fuzzy Panda makes no representation, express or 
implied, as to the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of any such information or with regard to the results to be obtained from 
its use. Further, any report on this site contains a very large measure of analysis and opinion. All expressions of opinion and 
conclusions are subject to change without notice, and Fuzzy Panda does not undertake to update or supplement any reports or any 
of the information, analysis and opinion contained in them.

The failure of Fuzzy Panda to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of 
this right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the 
parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision and 
rule that the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect, in particular as to this governing law and 
jurisdiction provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of 
or related to this report or the material on this website must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose
