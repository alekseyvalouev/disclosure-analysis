Summary
This FOIA reveals that the company had received a notice of investigation from the
State of Washington on the exact issues I highlighted a full two months before I
published.


Both "Solicitation" and "Referral" laws are being examined by the state of
Washington - calling into question TRUP's statements on the issue.


This is NOT about the potential fine. The risk here is that the company will have to
dramatically alter the sales funnel which wall st currently derives its price targets
from.


The Veterinarians and their licensing status are a focus of the investigation - they
will likely to have to be licensed on the backside of this investigation, or TRUP will.


An FOIA was recently returned from the State of Washington regarding the investigation
into Trupanion's (NASDAQ:TRUP) marketing practices that validates the concerns that
have been highlighted in several previous reports (initial report). Far more concerning is
that we now know the company was notified that an investigation over two months
before they issued the email below to me. Specific to my concerns about the
veterinarians and territory partners being viewed as unlicensed insurance agents, the
company stated "We believe these false statements are libelous and probably constitute
securities fraud considering your short position."

What Did They Know?


Source: The Capitolist


As you will see, the company knew it was under investigation for veterinarians
soliciting insurance two months before making the claims above regarding me
and, more importantly, the TRUP business model.


As clearly stated in my initial report, the short thesis is predicated on the significant
premium the company garners relative to its peers in the insurance business. However,
my $20 to $10 valuation range was meant to take into account regulatory risk. We now
know that the risk is real and, therefore, have to consider the bottom end of the range to
be a likely outcome for the company. Said more succinctly, the information below leads
me to a $10 price target (or about 3x book value).


FOIA requests from the State of Washington show that the company knew as early as
June 12th that the State of Washington has serious questions about the licensing status
of the veterinarians who were being paid on the successful enrollment of a certificate
that originated from their hospital.

What Questions Are The Regulators Asking?

Three points in this first page of letter that are worth the attention:


"Do you offer trips and gift cards to Washington State veterinarians and/or their
employee via a rewards program?"


1.


"...please explain how the rewards program works?"2.

They Are Requesting A List of The Veterinarians


"If you do offer rewards, is any part of it based on a Trupanion certificate activation?"3.


I highlighted many of these issues as being problematic and provided a specific
example in the form of a case study in the third report; importantly, investors should look
at the revenue exposure associated with states that share similar laws as WA - >30% is
significant in my eyes.


While the first set of questions validates our initial concerns, the second set of questions
is seriously problematic for the business model.

RCW 48.17.490


Conclusion


#2: "If you offered a rewards program please provide a list of Washington State
veterinarians and their employees that receives a reward(s) and the value of the
reward per entity for each month from January 2015 to present?"


This suggests the State of Washington is collecting a list of veterinarians and their staff
who may have received unlawful payments from TRUP to induce the sale of insurance.
We can say that solicitation is the focus with a reasonable confidence because the letter
from the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner specifically highlights
"RCW 48.17.490".


Must be licensed to receive a commission, service fee, or other valuable consideration.


(1) An insurance company, insurance producer, or title insurance agent shall not pay a
commission, service fee, or other valuable consideration to a person for selling,
soliciting, or negotiating insurance in this state if that person is required to be licensed
under this chapter or chapter 48.15 RCW and is not so licensed.


(2) A person shall not accept a commission, service fee, or other valuable consideration
for selling, soliciting, or negotiating insurance in this state if that person is required to
be licensed under this chapter or chapter 48.15 RCW and is not so licensed.


(3) Renewal or other deferred commissions may be paid to a person for selling,
soliciting, or negotiating insurance in this state if the person was required to be
licensed under this chapter or chapter 48.15 RCW at the time of the sale, solicitation, or
negotiation, and was so licensed at that time.


(4) An insurer, except a title insurer, or insurance producer may pay or assign
commissions, service fees, or other valuable consideration to an insurance agency, or to
persons who do not sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance in this state, unless the payment
would violate RCW 48.30.140, 48.30.150, 48.30.155, 48.30.157, or 48.30.170.

This update calls into question how the Chief Administrative Officer Asher Bearman and
Chief Council Gavin Friedman could find it so important that I had questions as to
threaten me but not find it important enough to 8k those same questions when they
were asked by a regulator. The perspective on disclosure displayed TRUP on this
particular issue is troublesome, given the lack of disclosure they display in the insurance
book (not giving the age cohorts of their pets in their 10Ks for one).


All of this brings me back to my $10 price target, and the suspicion that management
has more on its plate from a regulatory perspective than it wants investors to know.


Professional sceptic - I live in the footnotes
