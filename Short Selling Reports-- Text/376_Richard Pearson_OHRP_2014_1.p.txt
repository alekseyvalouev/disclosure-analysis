The Ugly Truth Behind Ohr Pharma
Jul. 1, 2014 10:00 AM ET76 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


A recent report from Vista Partners sent OHRP soaring by 60%. The contents,
including a $31 price target, was provided and paid for by Ohr management.


Ohr stock had just collapsed to as low as $6.86 due to a recent failure of its drug in
clinical trials.


Squalamine was previously owned by Genaera Pharma. The drug had already failed
following clinical trials such that Genaera sold it to Ohr for less than $100,000.


Recent encouraging results from Ohr were actually reported by Genaera as early as
2003, but the drug was still discarded as unviable.


Investors should expect to see shares of Ohr return to $5.00 or below. Ohr is a truly
compelling short and has liquid options.


Background


Over the weekend, physician Michael Sacerdote penned an article discussing Ohr
Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:OHRP), which was quite thorough and scientifically rigorous.
He posted three major conclusions:


First, despite the apparent clinical efficacy of squalamine, the drug would be a commercial
failure because it does not reduce the need for overall injections into the eye.


Second, with any possible approval being at least 4 years away, the drug will be too far
behind rival Opthotech's competing drug, Fovista. This again will result in commercial
failure.


Third, the value of squalamine is zero.


Dr. Sacerdote is a physician and his scientific analysis reflects that. However, I do believe
that the doctor has missed the much larger point with Ohr and squalamine.


In fact, this drug never had a real shot at success in the first place. The information
gleaned from recent Phase 2 trials has been known for more than 10 years. Yet the drug
was already determined to be commercially unviable and was effectively discarded by its

previous owner for de minimis proceeds.


Most importantly, the recent surge in the stock has simply been the result of a stock
promotion provided and paid for by Ohr management. It has nothing to do with the
prospects for squalamine and everything to do with management's desire to issue more
stock in equity offerings going forward. Ohr currently has a market cap of $250 million and
less than $20 million in cash, with no near-term drug prospects.


Recent developments


Shares of Ohr Pharma have been extremely volatile lately. The stock is held
overwhelmingly by retail investors who can be easily influenced by small amounts of
publicity, even when the underlying data is clearly not well understood.


On June 23rd, shares of Ohr rose by 16% due to the following announcement:


Ohr Pharmaceutical Announces Positive Interim Top-Line Clinical Results From Phase II
Study of Squalamine Eye Drops in Patients With Wet AMD


Clearly, the headline was very positive. And the contents within the press release were
also very positive.


But the devil was in the details.


In fact, buried deep within the press release was the fact that squalamine actually missed
its primary endpoint. The goal of the entire study was to reduce the frequency of Lucentis
injections and this did not happen. The drug failed its objective. Period.


But given the incredibly positive spin, it was not at all surprising that retail investors bid the
stock up. It was also not surprising that self-appointed biotech vigilante Adam Feuerstein
was quick to cry foul.


One day later, Feuerstein pointed out the fact that the drug had actually failed. He also
called management to task for the incredibly deceptive press release. Within two days,
shares of Ohr were down by as much as 40%, briefly hitting $6.86, down from $11.40 post
press release.


Yet within two more days, shares of Ohr were again up by as much as 60% from those
lows, briefly hitting $10.97 again. The main contributor to this surge was an "upgrade" by
Vista Partners, which placed a new $31 price target on the stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 3/27


Lest anyone miss their upgrade, Vista even put out a press release to trumpet it and
included the key reasons for why Ohr should be a $31 stock.


Vista Partners Updates Coverage on Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. (NASDAQ: OHRP); Raises
Price Target to $31


The bullish upgrade and the soaring share price were then further amplified by media
sources such as Benzinga and TheStreet.com.


But there is one major problem here. The report issued by Vista (including the $31 target)
was fully bought and paid for by Ohr management.


This fact was not disclosed in the press release by Vista and was therefore missed by
both Benzinga and TheStreet.com (as well as other market sources). It was also clearly
unknown to the retail investor base and it appears that very few people appear to have
read the actual report from Vista Partners.


For those who wish to read the actual Vista report, I have included a pdf copy at
moxreports.com.


But it gets worse.


Buried deep on page 10 of the report, and in much tinier font, is the disclosure from Vista
that (emphasis added):


This report has been prepared by Vista Partners LLC ("Vista") with the assistance


OHR Pharmaceutical, Inc. ("the Company") based upon information provided by
the Company. Vista has not independently verified such information, and in
addition, Vista has been compensated by the Company for advisory services for a
one year period. Vista and its officers may have an equity interest - both restricted
and unrestricted in the securities mentioned herein.


The key points to understand are as follows:


1. The information in the Vista report was provided solely by Ohr management
itself


2. Vista then does not even bother to verify any information
3. Ohr pays Vista for "advisory services" which includes putting out reports like


this one.

The report from Vista is nothing more than a late night infomercial provided by Ohr
management, yet it caused the share price to soar by 60% in two days.


It is very clear from the share price reaction that the heavy retail base of investors in Ohr
did not even bother to read this report. If any of them did, they certainly did not find the
tiny disclosure buried on page 10. Certainly, Benzinga and TheStreet.com missed this.


So Strike One for Ohr is the misleading press release on June 23rd, which painted a failed
clinical trial in a stunningly positive light.


Strike Two is the use of a paid stock pump to further elevate its shares using a $31 share
price target and a firm, which doesn't even bother to verify the information provided solely
by Ohr.


Looking at the history of Ohr will reveal Strike Three.


It is the fact that squalamine largely never stood a chance at getting approved or of
achieving commercial success in the first place. The drug was purchased for next to
nothing after it had already failed to prove itself viable in clinical trials. It was largely just an
excuse for Ohr to run a stock promotion with the goal of issuing stock to raise tens of
millions of dollars.


The history of Ohr Pharma


Ohr Pharma was created in a simple reverse merger transaction in 2009, which was
arranged by financier Orin Hirschman. Mr. Hirschman then appointed his father Shalom
Hirschman to act as a consultant to oversee the purchases of various small and
inexpensive pharma assets. By this time, the father had already sold to the corporate
entity several "pre-clinical" drug assets in exchange for warrants on 5 million shares with a
strike price of just 50 cents. Not a bad deal for mere "pre clinical assets." The son already
owned 18.9% of the public company by virtue of having arranged the reverse merger.


The company then appointed fellow financier Andrew Limpert to serve as its CEO.
According to SEC filings, Limpert had (up until the previous year) been a control person
for an investment advisor known as Belsen Getty. He also served various roles such as
chairman and CFO of two publicly traded reverse mergers, Nine Mile Software and Profire
Energy. For reference, SEC filings then describe the fraudulent activity, settlements and
cease and desist orders involved from then CEO Limpert's activity with manipulation and
non-disclosure in these other reverse merger stock deals.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 5/27


Later in 2009, with Limpert at the helm, Ohr completed the acquisition of Squalamine,
Trodusquemine and related compounds from Genaera Liquidating Trust. The Company
paid a mere $200,000 in cash for all of these compounds.


The cost per compound therefore comes out to something well under $100,000 each. We
don't know exactly how many compounds were purchased in this basket transaction so we
can't determine the exact average cost.


The first question becomes: why were the Hirschmans and Limpert able to acquire
these compounds so cheaply?


The answer is that they arguably had no value whatsoever.


Squalamine was acquired from a Pennsylvania biotech company called Genaera, which
had just wound down and liquidated its remaining assets for just a few pennies per share
in June 2009. Among the "assets" being sold off were the rights to squalamine (for age
related macular degeneration), trodusquemine (for obesity and now breast cancer) and
various other compounds. (Genaera had previously attempted to develop squalamine
under the trade name EVIZON).


Despite being shopped to dozens of potential bidders, the compounds failed to attract high
bids and Ohr was able to walk away with the rights to all of these various compounds
for just $200,000.


These assets were basically given away in bulk, and for a very good reason. In 2007 (two
years BEFORE going out of business) Genaera disclosed that:


Additionally, preliminary information on subjects enrolled in Study 212 suggested
that EVIZON™ was unlikely to produce vision improvement with the speed or
frequency necessary to compete with recently introduced treatments. With this
information, as well as evolving guidance from the FDA on clinical endpoints, we
concluded there was no pragmatic option for the registration and
commercialization of EVIZON™ for the treatment of wet AMD.


The drug was a failure and it was basically being given away as part of a bulk package of
compounds for a nominal sum as part of winding up a bankrupt company.


But what is interesting here is to note that the original optimism by Genaera for the drug
was based on vision and visual acuity, including "up to 8 lines" of visual acuity
improvement. Sound familiar?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 6/27


The key point to understand is that these optimistic views on the efficacy of squalamine
were expressed in a Genaera presentation to investors - in 2003 !!! They are nearly
identical to what Ohr just disclosed in 2014 - 11 years later.


Ohr had absolutely no basis whatsoever for pretending to be surprised at any new and
positive results. The company knew that in-line results should have been achievable since
the day they bought the drug.


Had these results actually mattered, they would have been used as the primary end point
for the study. But they did not matter, so they were not used.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 7/27


Now it is 2014, and a subsequent test of squalamine (not surprisingly) yields very similar
results. Ohr had reported in its press release that "Percentage of Squalamine plus
Lucentis PRN-treated patients gaining three, four and five lines in visual acuity was more
than double the placebo plus Lucentis PRN arm."


It sounds great. But does it matter?


We can see that in 2014 the results that are being reported by Ohr are in fact slightly
worse than the results we saw back in 2003. And even with those slightly better results
reported by Genaera in 2003, the drug was ultimately abandoned as being irrelevant and
commercially unviable. Aside from Ohr, no one was even willing to pay a meaningful sum
for this discarded drug.


This was a drug with no real commercial value. Genaera was happy to basically give it
away as part of a basket package deal.


What is the point of all of this?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 8/27


Once again, Ohr is being incredibly misleading by pretending that these results are new or
are any sort of surprise. These results are simply a repeat of similar information, which
had been released 11 years earlier.


In fact, Ohr would have been fully aware of these findings in 2009 when it purchased the
drug from Genaera. The latest press release is nothing more than a ruse to get the stock
up. And the ruse was then repeated and trumpeted by Vista Partners (the firm that doesn't
verify any information provided by Ohr management).


The second question becomes: why would Ohr even bother taking an already failed
drug through clinical trials?


This is something we see all too often in the world of microcap reverse merger biotechs. A
company buys a drug "asset." The result is not to buy the best drug. Instead, it is to buy
the cheapest drug asset it can find and then simply maximize the hype surrounding it. The
stock soars and the company raises tens of millions by selling stock. This capital raised
can hopefully be used later on to buy or develop a real drug, one that actually might work.
In the meantime, executives and directors pay themselves hundreds of thousands per
year in salaries while they wait.


By 2010, Ohr had purchased a small variety of compounds from different sources. Total
cash outlay was well under $1 million such that the cost for each compound continued to
be negligible. The company then took on new management with more "marketable"
credentials than Mr. Limpert.


Dr. Irach Taraporewala was appointed CEO with a base salary of just $61,000 plus some
stock. It turns out that Dr. Taraporewala was an associate of Shalom Hirschman (the
father), with both of them working together at an OTCBB penny stock company called
Advanced Viral Research. That firm went bust in 2009, just as Orin Hirschman was
assembling the Ohr reverse merger. The timing was therefore perfect.


The Hirschmans then appointed Sam Backenroth as CFO. Mr. Backenroth was just 26
years old with two years of work experience and had no experience as a CFO. His starting
salary was $24,000.


The point from all of this is that the goal is not to "succeed at any cost" like a true pharma
company. Instead, it is a strategy known as "fake it 'til you make it."


Acquire assets and people with minimal value or relevant experience and then spin an
impressive story around some massive future potential. When the stock soars, raise as
much money as possible to create as much "disposable capital" as possible.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2294795-the-ugly-truth-behind-ohr-pharma 9/27


In this way, the financiers can turn an investment of a few hundred thousand dollars (used
to purchase defunct compounds) into "disposable capital" of tens of millions.


When the stock needs a little help, management can always rely on stealthy paid reports
(such as from Vista Partners) and misleading press releases to help boost it up a notch. In
addition, by building relationships with a few small cap investment banks, these types of
companies can occasionally get bullish sell side coverage. It is obvious to these banks
that companies like this will be frequent investment banking clients due to the never-
ending need for capital.


This is the formula for reverse merger riches, and I feel that I am seeing it clearly once
again in Ohr. The only problem is that ordinary shareholders find themselves sitting on a
serial dilution machine due to the never-ending stream of equity offerings. Meanwhile
those behind the promotion can simply award themselves more and more stock options to
maintain their ownership.


Conclusion


Dr. Sacerdote came to the conclusion that "Value of Ohr's squalamine eye drops for wet
age-related macular degeneration is $0 or less."


I entirely agree with Dr. Sacerdote's conclusions, but for very different reasons. Dr.
Sacerdote makes reference to such items as the "biological activity" and "molecular
weight" of squalamine. I see this analysis as being accurate but largely unnecessary.


Squalamine was purchased for a negligible cost from a bankrupt pharma because it had
already failed and was clearly worthless. Dozens of other buyers had the opportunity to
bid on squalamine and no one was willing to pay a material price.


Ohr acquired the cheapest compounds that it could and then appointed the cheapest
management that it could. There was never any real chance of these compounds
succeeding.


Instead, Ohr has used misleading press releases and stealthy paid "research reports" to
boost its stock price and raise money via stock sales.


Ohr Pharma is little more than a fool's game for retail investors which has been
engineered by clever financiers.

Comments (76)


As of now, Ohr has around $20 million in cash and no material tangible assets. Its drug
compound portfolio should be evaluated in the context of the facts provided above.
Against this, the market cap of Ohr is still over $200 million.


As investors come to terms with the stock promotion and the questionable assets, the
stock will likely fall by at least 50%.


Even though much of Ohr's current approx. $20 million in cash was raised in April, the
recent efforts at pumping the stock tell us that we should be on strong lookout for more
equity offerings coming up due to the fact that Ohr has zero near-term revenue prospects.

get it? Or do your (soon to be appropriately revealed) vested interests in seeking to damage and destroy Ohr
transcend all? If you don't know Ohr, Ohr is a resilient little company that takes its punches, (comes back, re-focuses,
and moves on to get done the work at hand. Yes, unnecessary blogs like yours and others' with clearly vested
interests and/or overlords, are certainly an annoyance and distraction to the company; they drive the stock down
temporarily and spook the unwise investor who believes everything he/she reads on blogs such as SA and The
Street. Unfortunately, that is the cost of doing business in the cutthroat competitive biotech world and Wall Street we
live in today. But in the end, a successful biotech and pharmaceutical small company is built up from the bricks and
mortar of a committed management and good science. Ohr has both. Ohr has come back time and time again to
astonish those who have doubted both those elements within the company, with the management repeatedly
demonstrating positive scientific and clinical data, and growing the company phenomenally. Notwithstanding what
Ohr's original history is or was, what matters is that Ohr's current management has done everything methodically and
frugally, with tight expense control, on a shoestring budget, to maximize shareholder value. That is indeed something
to praise in this era of ever-rampant management greed, not to sneer or laugh at like some bloggers we know do. Ohr
is steadily and stealthily gaining an institutional investor base. Ohr is unlike so many other small biotech startups
where the management have lavish cash compensation and bonus packages, have plush corporate facilities, and
vast cash reserves available to grow the company; yet take years and years to advance even to clinical trials. Ohr has
broken the mold and shown there is another way. Ohr management's philosophy of keeping the infrastructure lean, of
blood, sweat and tears being expended as a normal course of business to advance the corporation, and yet keeping
focused with its nose to the grindstone means more to a corporation and its shareholders than them having access to
an unlimited pocketbook in which to dip in. That is the story of Ohr. If there is any justice in this world, this little
company will succeed in the face of all the ill winds blown against it, and all adversity thrown in its path by all the evil
and malificient self-serving people out there, and be successful in bringing a product to market that helps restore
functional vision to patients with wet AMD. Why? So that a grandmother can delight in seeing the faces of her
grandchildren, that an elderly retired veteran who served our nation valiantly can enjoy his game of golf with his
buddies, that a person still has the ability to drive to his favorite park to feed the ducks and ducklings (including the
ugly ones!) in the pond, or read a newspaper or watch their favorite program on TV, or live at home rather than be
placed in the unfamiliar confines of a nursing home, or do embroidery or crochet as a hobby, or go out for an
enjoyable evening to the theater. These are just a few of the many little joys that our elderly parents and
grandparents, yours and mine, are increasingly being robbed of when they get wet AMD. If we look just a little beyond
Wall Street, to the streets of urban and suburban America and into the farmhouses and ranches of its rural hinterland,
we must never forget that there is a huge human face to AMD and Ohr's product other that only the $$$$$ some
people choose to see. And that, my friends, is what Ohr is all about

Charcoal or graphite have been turned into diamonds in the laboratory by brilliant minds. The charcoal of the
old Genaera squalamine intravenous formulation which was worthless has similarly been turned into an eye
drop diamond by the brilliant minds in the Ohr laboratory. Admittedly, the eye drops are still a diamond-in-the-
rough as yet, to be polished up in a Phase III clinical trial polishing exercise, so that Ohr can ultimately be the
brilliant debutante with a shining diamond to call its own at the debutante ball of the blockbuster
pharmaceutical marketplace.

I was wondering why OHRP would design a trial with a primary endpoint that they knew would fail. Clearly they
wanted to get as much positive spin in the period leading up to the announcement of the trial results. I heard rumors
that the results were going to be very good. This helped the stock reach $20 and allowed insiders to dump at that
level. Then they did the additional offering at $10. While I think they are probably still selling as much as they can at
today's price, the real dirty work was done between 10 and 20 on the way up. I feel lucky to have broken even on this

primary endpoints in Phase II proof of concept trials and can still bat in home run after home run with a great
drug. Remember, Regeneron failed with its clinical pipeline for 20 years before it finally hit pay dirt with Eylea.
How soon we forget! Ohr's secondary endpoint of Visual Acuity (VA) benefit was hugely successful and is
absolutely all that matters, no matter how much you take management and the doctors who designed the trial
to task for failing the primary. Because the VA gain absolutely paves the way for a clear path for Ohr to FDA
approval. The VA endpoint of 48 % of squalamine eye drop treated patients who got 3 lines (or better) vision
gain (p=0.025) and 27% of patients who got 4 lines (or better) vision gains (p=0.022) is all what matters. No
clinical trial in wet AMD treatment has achieved that unprecedented level of vision gain. Don't you get it yet? If
not, ask any AMD patient- what to they want most- improved functional vision. And when do they want it -
NOW. Ohr has extremely good, unprecedented vision gains (albeit in interim data) that blows other competitor
programs in development out of the water and therefore threatens them and their existence. That is the most
likely reason for this daily onslaught of attacks against little Ohr-after they released their data, aimed at the
naïve retail investor out there. So do you clearly see that now, folks? Or do you need some eye drops to clear
that vision?

Nick Zheng, Contributor
Dr. Sacerdote has an odd conclusion, but he did think the data is promising in visual acuity. If this is true, then I do
believe that squalamine eye drop has a future even with competition from OPHT.


The history of a biotech is full of drama. So there is no logic that a cheap chemical could not turn out to be a miracle.
In reality, there is a long history of development of squalamine that has already cost tens of millions shareholders'
dollars. It sounds like that OHRP finally has made it to work for good.


Your analysis is based on historical analysis. While that is useful, but the historical data should be trumped by more
recent validation. Like Adam Feuerstain who was not scientifically trained, his analysis sometimes driven by emotional
conviction in his brain (often from other hedge fund sources) rather than driven by updated clinical data. He did
excellent jobs, about 80% chance to be right. Because of his influence, when he is wrong, lots of traders/investors got
trapped. One case was DNDN in which he had wrote articles after articles predicting immunotherapy would not work,
but it did worked and stock soured to 50. I have met investors who had lost millions betting its failure by reading AF's
stories again and again.

OPHT's drug trials exclude patients with the occult form of wet AMD (about 50% of the wet AMD population
our there) and those who have diabetes (another 15-20% of wet patents). Patients also need to have
hyperreflective material show up in their retinal scans to be eligible to be treated with OPHT's drug. So just

the way OPHT's drug works, it excludes 70% or more of the real world wet AMD population. So even if
OPHT's drug works great, Ohr can corner the 70% + plus market share for which OPHT will likely not get a
FDA label use for. 70% of 2.5 million patients is HUGE!

boon and life-saving and preserving drug for thousands multiple myeloma patients. Ugly ducklings can turn into
swans, Mr. Pearson, so there is a clear precedent for an old "failed abysmally" drug that turned out to be a goldmine.
But how would you know? You don't know drug development . Leave that to the experts- Dr. Taraporewala, Ohr
Pharmaceutical's CEO who you disparage here, and all the world famous ophthalmologists he has been able to
attract and bring on board as his company management and ophthalmic advisory board have a collective 200 plus
years' ophthalmic drug development experience behind them. Many of these same clinical research physicians were
the same key players who brought the current clinically used drugs for wet AMD onto the market. Clearly, all of them
see pay dirt and the true value of the drug to patients, or they wouldn't be motivated to be involved with a small
company like Ohr. So keep that in mind and never forget that fact , dear readers, or be swayed just by the never-
ending barrage of Ohr-bashery coming out of the woodwork by the likes of Mr. Pearson, who, as far as I know, has
never himself brought a drug to the market to benefit humanity.

then grown the company from a two-man show into a 15-employee NASDAQ listed company with a 200 million plus
market cap with a potential blockbuster drug eye drop formulation developed in house that has recently demonstrated
unprecendented vision gains in its Phase II clinical trials, and also brought in the crème-de-le-crème of the retinal

And before making your decision folks, consider the additional factor that OPHT's Fovista injection to the eye added
to Lucentis injections adds a "double ouch factor" every singler doctor visit and treats only a total of 25-30% of real
world wet AMD patients because it excludes diabetic patients (representing 20% of wet AMD patients in the United
States) and those with the harder to treat occult lesions (representing about 50% of the AMD population) and only
works in small, easier to treat "classic" lesions. Obviously OPHT does not generally like to disclose and disseminate
that fact widely, except to the ophthalmologist community to which it has to.

 "It's a calamity for Ophthotech" says one former longOHR'S PHASE 2 RESULTS SHOWS VISION SUPERIORITY
WITH 48% OF REAL WORLD WET AMD PATIENTS GAINING 3 LINES OR MORE AND NEEDING 66% LESS
INJECTIONS !! 
Opthotech longs are shaking in theIR shoes as Ohr's phase 2 results show EQUIVALENT VISON GAINS to Fovista at
the 24 week time point BUT need 66% fewer injections to do so. At the 24 week time point, Fovista patients needed
12 intravitreal injections while squalamine patients needed only 4. These 12 fewer injections will result in an average
savings to Medicare of over $40K per year on the purchase of intravitreals and will allow many more patients who lack
insurance access to treatment.Desperate Ophthotech longs and corporate insiders are shaking in their shoes after the
results came out showing squalamine is shown to be noninferior to Fovista in percentage of patients who gained 3 or
more lines yet required 66% less injections. The squalamine results were obtained using real world newly diagnosed
wet amd patients comprising a mixture of occult and classic. It has been known by well informed investor that
Fovista's results were helped by Ophthotech excluding diabetics and occult wet amd patients in their FDA trials in
order to boost the effect of Lucentis which has to be injected monthly along with Fovista. Occult wet amd patients gain
about 2 to 3 less letters on average from Lucentis as compared to classic wet amd. Including occult wet amd patients
who comprise nearly half of the newly diagnosed wet amd population, artificially boosted Fovista's results by 2 letters
of gainOpthotech now hopes that Novartis will buy there company in order to market a yet to be developed coinjection

initial first injection. Squalame drops do not require visits to a highly trained specialist to be prescribed, thus allowing
other eye docs to take care of this patient population, referring to a retinal specialist only when needed. Since the
drops are self administered, they will allow tens of millions of wet amd patients in the world a treatment for their wet
amd that can prevent permanent blindness.The drops have a unique intracellular mechanism of action; they inhibit the
protein calmodulin which is the common pathway for numerous mitogens including vegf, pdgf, bFGF, and
others.Squalamine is a charged +2 cation; it is allowed entry only into capillary cells and is theorized to build up to a
level of about 100 x the serum concentration due to the effect of the cells -70mV voltage (the so called Nernst
potential phenomenon that is seen to account for the intracellular build up of other charged catiions such as
potassium)Squalamine binds to calmodulin and the charged complex winds up getting trapped in the perinuclear
compartment for an average of 6 days. This makes dosing convenient for patients as missed doses will not
significantly affect the average concentration.In addition, a potential market for the drops are the 14 million Americans
who suffer from the dry form of wet amd which can suddenly convert in days to the wet form. Any delay in getting
treatment can result in permanent blindness. Ohr's squalamine will allow these patients to use the drops at home to
prevent this conversion from occurring. A few Ophthotech investors became alarmed by these recent events by
writing poisonous articles on various websites. Due to their actions, 22 million shares of Ohr changed hands in the
last week. But as this merely moved shares from 'weak hands' to 'strong hands' and not Ohr is primed to make a
move to the $20 dollar level.

Dear objective readers.


I have invested in Biotech stocks for many years. In the biotech world, professionals know that it's all about the data,
the management and the facts. What perplexes me is the author of this article does not include the most important
data and facts regarding Ohr's lead drug candidate and their management, but instead attempts to portray the drug
and its management in a very poor light by innuendo and red herring. That typically indicates an attempt to obstruct
and confuse. Consider the key data and facts that the author failed to divulge about Ohr's drug and its management.


Significantly, the author left out Ohr's key data from its interim phase II data that was just released last week. This was
a phase II FDA clinical trial regarding its Squalamine eye drops that shows outstanding vision gains in real wet AMD
patients (superior to Ophthotech's Fovista injection phase II study vision gains). By the way, Fovista is an anti-PDGF-
only injection added to the current anti-VEGF injections intended to provide additional vision gains. See the web link
below to see Ohr's phase II interim data and determine for yourself the value of this data and the fact that the drug is
delivered in a non-invasive safe eye drop formulation instead of through additional invasive Fovista injections given to
the back of the eye:


http://bit.ly/1iQ9V7L


The other thing that perplexes me is that the author of this article is claiming that Ohr has unprofessional, low-paid
founders who are self-serving. The facts are that Ohr's founding entrepreneurs took risks with their own funds to
purchase the IV formulation of Squalamine from Genaera and develop a non-invasive eye drop formulation of the
drug. Squalamine is a first-in-class, small molecule, anti-angiogenic drug with a novel intracellular mechanism of
action. The drug acts against the development of aberrant neovascularization (in wet AMD, that means growth of
disease causing blood vessels in the eye) through potent inhibition of multiple protein growth factors of angiogenesis,

including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF). Genaera had spent a great deal of resources to develop a safe and efficacious drug that was delivered
by IV infusion. This IV form of Squalamine had strong clinical results in treating wet AMD, was found to be very safe,
but was found that it would require too many IV infusions to be effective and that retina and/or ophthalmology clinics
were not set up to give frequent IV infusions but clinics were set up to give the new (new at that time) anti-VEGF
injections. It was a matter of Geneara's IV form of the drug being trumped by the clinically more practical anti-VEGF
injections. At this point, Geneara had run out of funds and abandoned further development. Ohr's founding
management purchased Squalamine from Genaera because they believed that Ohr could develop a daily topical eye
drop formulation of Squalamine that would enter through the blood rich choroid of the eye and effectively treat wet
AMD and other CNV diseases of the eye. Furthermore, because of Squalamine's anti-VEGF and additional anti-
PDGF and anti-bFGF properties, Ohr's founders believed it would be a particularly efficacious drug in a safe, non-
invasive eye drop formula.


I hope that company founders taking low salaries to conserve investor money (as the author mentions as a bad thing
in Ohr's case) and that company founders hoping to make a profit in the future has not become something considered
bad on Wall Street. To the contrary, my experience is that institutional investors in early stage companies appreciate
founders who do not take large salaries, do invest their own dollars in the company and are motivated by owing stock
in a company that has future potential for price appreciation. The author also does not tell the reader that the insiders
have not sold any of their Ohr stock.


Furthermore, the author fails to tell the reader another very important fact about Ohr's management. With Ohr's recent
acquisition of SKS, they brought in at top level executive positions, three luminary, highly respected and experienced
professionals in the ophthalmic field. These three internationally respected, top level M.D. clinicians/researchers have
vast experience in wet AMD and other CNV diseases including FDA trials in wet AMD for the current blockbuster anti-
VEGF injections that treat wet AMD and other CNV diseases of the eye. On their own, these highly respected
professionals developed a time released technology for glaucoma drugs and possibly other drugs that treat diseases
of the eye. Ohr now owns that technology.


Furthermore, consider the fact that they joined Ohr by agreeing to sell their company's technology and assets to Ohr
for a very small cash amount (under $4 Million) and a large amount of stock valued at $10.00 per share when Ohr's
stock was selling well below $10 a share. These new Ohr executives do have higher salaries than the Ohr founders
who have significantly more stock in the company.


See the web link below regarding Ohr's addition to their executive team and come to your own conclusions about their
abilities and reputations.

Perhaps the author of this article should have actually sat down with Ohr to meet and evaluate its executive team and
to review the recent data. That is what serious and institutional investors are doing who are buying Ohr's stock.
Although the author berates the institutions (Vista and Brean) who upgraded and raised Ohr's stock price after the
release of the Ohr's interim phase II data, at least Vista Partners and Brean Capital have sat down with the Ohr, met
the management and reviewed all the facts and the data.


I hope this article's exclusion of key clinical data and facts about management is not an attempt to help current
Ophthotech investors have the time to sell their positions in Ophthotech stock at relatively high prices and buy Ohr

stock at lower price. That would be disingenuous. But perhaps the author simply does not know the facts.


I am long Ohr stock. I have had several opportunities since the release of their interim phase II data to sell my position
at a profit. I have not sold any of my position in Ohr. Do your own due diligence.

So if it takes until 2017 you need to get in low and hold for 3 yrs. So why pump up the stock now? Unless you
are looking to play the derivatives and the volatility now.


I object to the press releases. I also note the sudden spikes in volume which are indicative of players not
investors. Your story does not reflect the reality. The stock is worth about $3 and anyone who buys it for more
is a sucker because they will not see any return unless they sell into the phony press releases.

In the end, the history of the company or the past history of the drug as an intravenous injectiob or which analysts
cover the company or the starting salary of its officers are irrelevant. My Pearson, don't you get it? Those things don't
matter at all. It is an entirely moot point. The clinical tria data show that Ohr's new squalamine eye drop formulation
works for AMD, the condition it was specifically designed to treat. It works very well in conjunction with Lucentis, as its
clinical trial was specifically designed to show. Over 48% of patients see 3 lines or better when using squalamine
versus 21% who don't and receive just Lucentis, the current standard of care. That is huge, folks. That is
unprecedented in any other AMD trial. Get it, readers? That is, in the end, all that matters, despite all of Mr. Pearson's
peripheral distractive noise about the company to divert you from the message staring you in the face. OHR's DRUG
WORKS. End of story. period.

For this author to be taken seriously, he should take a fraction of the time he took to write this piece and devote it to
addressing investor positions.


Millymac has made the finest, most thorough post. If the criteria of this article has any substance, the author should
answer it. Otherwise, he is simply "in it for the minute" - and his motivation to profit echoes that of the analysts whose

MillyMac - Are you affiliated with the Company in any way? Your comments are very defensive in a personal natures -
Plus you never have commented before other than for OHR?

Lets face it ....this is a fake it until you make it scenario....The Company raised capital, insiders burn it at their own
doing and will dump.. Rinse and repeat

Thanks for the article. Enjoyed a nice run-up on OHRP, but have no interest in playing there anymore.

Pearson may have nailed this, but he also thought he nailed KNDI back in October of 2013. His reasons all sounded
valid also. He went back and forth with a couple of bull authors on KNDI and the exchange was rife with fact and
innuendo both. The exchanges were both factual and at the same time both had their problems.


The end result was that I stayed out of KNDI. The problem is that Pearson missed the boat on KNDI, which seems
stronger than ever now.

I have lived in and out of China for over 20 years. I speak Chinese. I have owned and driven multiple electric vehicles
in China. I have followed Kandi for years. If Kandi truly had multi bagger potential, I would be the first one to take a
large long position and tell the world why. I would be thrilled to make a few hundred percent, as predicted by the
Kandi bulls.

His prediction, in short, was that KNDI was a farce and would crater. Pearson, if that was not your overall
general conclusion, let me know and I'll recant this comment.

Kndi will be known as a fraud

DWD Investing, Contributor
Will, fair enough, but it's been years and they are still not a fraud. In fact, they are expanding into the US also.
I have no position with KNDI. Nor, will I ever (due mainly to Pearson's information), but they so far do not
seem to be a fraud. And, even good companies go BK w/o being a 'fraud.'

Pearson track record has been better with stock promoters - ONVO Galena etc...and now this one, he has artfully
crafted a great skill. Thank god for the truth. See you at 7 bucks

Pearson did a magnificent job---facts not emotional raves or dreams of the bullish that have posted comments above.
The rationale for the stock movement is clear. The execs are not paying themselves big time but they are playing the
derivatives and making huge and unscrupulous profits by paying Vista and blogging their way to volatility. Anyone can
tell you if you are a successful options trader you can make your salary in a week.


I wish Pearson would do investigative reporting on PLUG and Ballard which show the same kind of spikes, trying to
induce emotionally motivated suckers into buying these zero value equities.
