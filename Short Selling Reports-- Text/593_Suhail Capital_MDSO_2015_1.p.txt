Medidata: A Short Thesis
Apr. 1, 2015 7:30 AM ET9 comments
by: Suhail Capital


Summary


Medidata is another Vertical Life Sciences SAAS that offers a fantastic risk/reward
short opportunity. The shares will fall by 45% over the next 12 months.


After an exhaustive several months of research, we have determined MDSO's TAM
is grossly overstated by a factor of 7x+. This is remarkably even worse than Veeva.


The evidence of the minute size of the non-EDC eClinical market is overwhelming
and irrefutable, and remarkably has gone largely ignored.


There are mounting red flags over the past year that are also impossible to ignore.
Terminating quarterly guidance, eliminating non-rave revenue breakdowns, and
broadening the back-log coverage definition.


The competitve environment outside EDC is a big problem for Medidata, and it is
getting even worse as large pharmas and CROs are opening up to small vendors.

The author is icastic with the swimming pool picture, but it eloquent to make a synthesis of this complex work. Only
problem is how to play this trade with options, what month to choose and what strike.

Great conviction you show. I started to take some position in that direction, but the 60 looks too high strike for put.

This is excellent analysis of a stock that is chronically over-valued by consensus, who has failed to notice that the
market opportunity is not nearly as big as the bulls think and where the unit economics have been falling apart over
several quarters now. Despite that, the stock has held in quite well thus far. I don't know how they hit their 20-25%
long term revenue target this year considering the likelihood of big deals continues to diminish. I think this is a better
short than VEEV at this point - it's certainly far less crowded - and it's probably 1-2 quarters away from really wetting
the bed. The insider selling on this is amazing and few management teams are as promotional as Medidata's.

What are thoughts about earnings beat? That was quite a jump in stock price today

Author’s reply »  Earnings beat? That was essentially an inline quarter with unchanged guidance which btw
was what is to be expected considering the downward adj they provided last quarter. As for the reaction, your
guess is as good as ours. Completely befuddling. You'd think they announced some major new customer win
or meaningfully raised guidance. Instead an inline report and cfo change 1month after head of sales leaves
produces the largest single day upside move in years. Reality is this has been a low expectations stock with a
very concentrated group of long only's holding a disproportionate amount of the shares, so its susceptible to
some bizarre moves. But this is the market, sometimes you can do nothing but scratch your head.

Today was the right time to buy puts. Today I completed my short position buying puts. These post earning bounces
are frequent, shorting is not for the faint of heart.
