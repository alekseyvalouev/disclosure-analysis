Reliv International's Legal Case Regarding Lead Content

Yesterday, Reliv International (NASDAQ:RELV) may have approached the end of its
California litigation. Reliv was accused of "failure to warn consumers that they have been
exposed to lead from several of the company's nutritional health products. Lead is a
chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other
reproductive harm." ~ Case: CIV1300429 Superior Court of the State of California


The notices of violation began in 2010. The complaint itself was filed in court on January
14, 2013, in a court action brought by Environmental Research Center ("ERC"), a non-
profit corporation. A proposed stipulated consent judgment was later signed by Reliv's
CFO and attorney. As usual, the defendant does not have to admit guilt. Nonetheless,
according to the proposed consent judgment, as signed by Reliv's representatives:


Civil penalties must be paid "pursuant to Health & Safety Code Section
25249.7(b)(1)"
A portion of the above penalty is to be paid to the office of Environmental Hazard
Assessment.

And most telling of all:


"Since receiving ERC's Notices of Violation, Reliv has revised the formula for all
of the covered Products to bring the lead levels in the Covered products that are
manufactured going forward to below 0.5 micrograms per day, the level at which
a warning would be required pursuant to Proposition 65." (Source: Proposed
Stipulated Consent Judgment)


How can one bring levels below a required limit without implying that one had been above
it?

According to the Marin County Superior Court Register of Actions, the judgment was
signed in court yesterday (8/14/2013).


Reliv claims to be a research-driven and nutrition-centered company. How does one
reconcile this with the recent litigation? For example, according to its 2012 10-K, Reliv
claims that its own "internal research and development team has developed most of [its]
products" and that its facility manufactures "substantially all of [its] nutritional products." If
those declarations were sincere, how could Reliv get into such difficulties? How could it
avoid responsibility? But then again, according to its SEC filed 10-Ks, Reliv spends less

than 1% of sales on research and development. How surprised should we really be that it
found itself in California court? (For more on RELV, see my previous article, Reliv the
Hype.)

What a dishonest piece. You failed to mention that the amount of money Reliv is paying to settle this case and get rid
of this nuisance is a measly $77k. You are being dishonest by insinuating that there are large "civil penalties" and a
de facto admission of guilt. The settlement document is boiler plate language that you will find with slight variations in
all the other cases settled with ERC


Anybody who wants to know the truth should google the ERC and Michael Freund and the amount of lawsuits relating
to the new proposition 65 they have brought over the last 3 years. ERC's prime focus seems to be generating
business for one man shop lawyer Michael Freund and then settling to get companies to reimburse his legal fees.

Author’s reply »  There is very little of my own opinion presented. And the issue here is not a legal or a
financial one, but the quality and sincerity of RELV as a healthy, nutrition- centered company.


If a pilot is fined a mere $100 while flying drunk, the cheapness of the fine does not eliminate any risks I take
in being his passenger. This is not a financial point, but one of quality and safety.


As for “Boilerplate” -- “collapsed bridge ahead” or “smoking causes cancer”, does not eliminate the danger --
just because you see the same standard warning everyday.


Likewise, lead is harmful. Period. Saying so in "boilerplate" would not change that.


>You are being dishonest by insinuating that there are large "civil penalties"<


Where did I insinuate a large penalty? The financial aspect is irrelevant to the question of Reliv’s product
quality – especially for a company that claims research and to be nutrition-centered.


“ and a de facto admission of guilt.”


The documents found in the California system settle this matter, not me. I don’t take credit or blame for the
number 4 after someone presents 2 + 2. That’s just how it adds up. How does a company bring the lead

levels below the limit without implying it had been above it? That’s not my implication, but an implication
provided by the documents themselves.


RE: Mr. Freund -- Attorneys get paid, just like everybody else. Big surprise. Consider: Policemen’s and
doctor’s financial incentives do not erase the good they do. Proposition 65 has been controversial since its
beginning. However, it has lasted more than 20 years and has undeniably resulted in the removal of
dangerous substances from the public marketplace. Proposition 65 “bounty hunters,” even if only pursuing
their own incentives, have left California a safer place. But ask yourself: Why would it take proposition 65 and
litigation for a nutrition centered company to revise its products? How sincere would such a nutrition company
be?


As for “dishonesty” -- in my opinion,  
1) the stock was pumped … and investors who trusted management’s PR are now at risk.  
2) dishonesty is when you present a message that contradicts the underlying fact. What kind of company
claims diligent research and nutritious products and then finds itself in this legal position?
