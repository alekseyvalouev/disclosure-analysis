TACO


Del Taco has been around for over 50 years. This is NOT a growth story. Nothing
innovative to see here.


In a huge break from tradition, the company did not provide guidance at ICR in
January 2017.


The 2017 bar for TACO is very low. Not providing guidance is a huge red flag.


The company has gouged on price and has closed / exceeded the gap with peers –
no more room left to jack price.


I think the company is going to guide down “ big league” in March and recommend
investors sell now.

The latest fad in short selling appears to be the dreaded "Presidential Tweet," in fact
puppies are being saved due to at least one "Trump and Dump Bot." Additionally, Real
Talk Investments recently watched a CNBC interview with TD Ameritrade's (AMTD)
CEO in which he discussed how his company had rejiggered its user interface to make it
easier for retail investors to react to (and trade on) Trump's targeted tweets. The latest
tactic used by prominent "activist shorts" has also been to goad President Trump into
taking action on companies that are misbehaving.


So if you were looking for a short report that calls on the President to bring an end to <fill
in the blank> corporate practice, please cease reading immediately. Despite its historical
reliance on what I believe is unsustainable price gouging, I doubt that Del Taco
(NASDAQ:TACO) will ever be the subject of a Presidential tweet-storm, unless of course
it opens up shop across from Trump Tower Grill, where one can find the best taco bowls
in the world:

All kidding aside, Del Taco presents a compelling and very timely short opportunity. At
the 20k foot level, I expect the company to provide guidance to the Street in March 2017
that will be a huge disappointment to shareholders for several reasons, and that the
downward pressure on the stock will be exacerbated due to the likely rotation within the
shareholder base from "value guys" to "growth guys." "Growth guys" will sell at any sign
of a top-line growth disappointment and "value guys" likely won't start soaking up the
stock until it returns to my price target (discussed later). I am frankly shocked that the
stock has not already corrected since the company's ICR appearance back on January
10, 2017.


The short thesis on TACO is simple: The stock has simply run too far too fast and is
not baking in glaringly obvious risks to the pending March 2017 guidance.


Many investors will dismiss the work as a "valuation short" based on what I think about
the underlying business. Before you stop reading due to the voice in your head saying
"value short," it's important to remember the following:


1. There is a clear potential catalyst on the horizon given management's recent
disclosure decisions combined data and logic


2. The shareholder base has likely turned over from "value guys" to "growth guys" which
sets up for a quicker potential revaluation.


History


For readers less familiar with Del Taco - it is a Mexican fast food concept that is popular
in California and the Southwest. While TACO continues to present itself as something
more than fast food, I think the average check size of $7.12 speaks for itself. The
company owns ~310 restaurants and franchises another ~240 restaurants. Around 2/3
rds of the total company restaurants are located in California.

The company was created out of a SPAC- a financial vehicle with a notorious track
record of failure. Prior to being sold into the Levy Acquisition SPAC, the company was
backed by private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners through a vehicle known as
Sagittarius Brands. While owned by Sagittarius Brands, Del Taco actually found itself in
a precarious financial position that ultimately resulted in a loan-to-own situation, with
debt holder Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Fund restructuring its debt position into equity.
This was not the first time Del Taco has found itself in trouble with debtors. The
company also went bankrupt in 1993. So while Del Taco presents itself as an innovative
Mexican QSR concept, I think it is actually a company that has consistently found
itself in a pickle over poor financial engineering decisions. Currently, TACO's Net
Current Asset position is already negative at -31.7MM ($19.8MM current assets
minus $51.5MM current liabilities = $31.7MM). For reference, McDonald's (MCD) runs
very net positive.


It also reminds us of another failed Leonard Green & Partners IPO - The Container
Store. Like The Container Store (TCS), Del Taco was founded over 30 years ago.
Also like TCS, investors have been lulled into a false narrative about massive potential
for unit growth expansion. A savvy retail investor like Leonard Green knows when to
hold it and knows when to fold it - and its decision to bail on TACO - an asset that
performed poorly under its ownership - speaks volumes to its views on the asset. When
businesses in competitive and non-innovative industries that have existed for decades
are suddenly pitched as "growth companies," investors should tread very carefully.

Like "My Wife My Mother-In-Law", the below map has two very different perspectives:

If TACO had only been around for a few years, or just recently started expanding,
perhaps the "white space" is a positive opportunity and growth story. Then again, it may
simply show how poorly TACO expanded despite a 50-year history and branded private
equity ownership.


Despite having been around for over 50 years and having been owned by one of the
best retail private equity investors in North America, Del Taco has been unable to
expand outside of its core markets in California and the Southwest. Why would
anything change now that the company is run by a CEO whose prior work
experience was running Einstein Bagels?


Over the long-term, given the competitive nature of TACO's industry and the company's
long and spotty history that includes bankruptcies and debt restructurings, I think that
TACO could eventually see a similar fate to Leonard Green's portfolio company TCS.


However, in the much nearer-term, I believe Del Taco is likely to fall 30%+ for two
main reasons.


Reason #1: When Management Mysteriously Fails to Give Guidance, Bad News Is
Usually on the Horizon


First, I think Del Taco's "odd" decision to pre-announce 4Q16 earnings yet not provide
guidance at ICR 2017 - despite doing so last year - is a huge red flag that strongly
signals that the company is going to massively disappoint investors in the coming
months. Street's bar for guidance is actually relatively low, leading us to believe
that TACO kicked the can on guidance to avoid providing exceptionally ugly
guidance to the Street. I find it alarming that the company pre-announced its results at
ICR in January, yet will not communicate 2017 guidance to the Street until March 2017.


TACO provided detailed full-year guidance ahead of ICR 2016:

Source: Bloomberg


Yet this year, here is all investors got from TACO's press release:


Source: Bloomberg (I annotated the chart)


There was no mention of guidance anywhere in the company's press release. I also
listened to the company's ICR webcast and heard no mention of guidance. The
company regularly provides forward guidance each quarter. So the decision to leave
guidance out is a major departure from its traditional pattern.


I was particularly surprised that TACO decided not to guide, given that the bar that the
Street has provided the company appears to be incredibly low. Despite posting north of
a 5% comp in 2016, the Street is currently modeling only a 3% comp for TACO in 2017.


Yet still, TACO decided not to "confirm" the Street's initial 2017 modeling for its
top-line… which makes you wonder…

I think it's a safe bet that when companies do not share information with investors that
was previously disclosed in the past, it is because the undisclosed information is
unflattering.


Reason #2: Jacking price has driven most of TACO's same-store-sales growth,
isn't a sustainable growth strategy, and Del Taco's pricing gap with Taco Bell is
now close to zero


This leads to my second and related point as to why I expect TACO to see a significant
price decline in the coming months. The company has taken massive price increases
that I believe have now run out of steam. I also show that continued price increases are
not justifiable in light of the quality of food that Del Taco provides versus its competitors.


I think this comment from Tail Pin Capital summarizes the price aspect of the TACO
short thesis most succinctly:

I've run my own pricing analysis and note that there seems to be little to no room left for
TACO to keep jacking prices. I compared TACO's average check to that of other fast
food chains. The results show a company that has run out of pricing as a growth lever:

At $7.12 average check, I think TACO has no more room left to keep taking price. This
should be concerning to shareholders at TACO given that the comp has largely
benefited from price increases over the past two years since the TACO SPAC came into
formation:


Source: RTI Analysis


I pulled pricing data wherever available for comparable concepts (Taco Bell is really the
best comparable to Del Taco). It is clear that Del Taco has disproportionately relied on
the pricing lever, with almost all of its comp in 2016 coming from price and transactions
running negative for most of the year.


The pricing lever is dead.


If you don't believe us, look at the guidance that the company itself provided on a recent
earnings call regarding an expectation for deceleration in pricing growth:


Pricing guidance

Source: Bloomberg transcripts from 3Q16 call


Finally, I point readers to this chart. Given Taco Bell clearly has scale purchasing power
versus Del Taco, I think the chart below gives readers a sense for how much pricing
power Del Taco has purely on the basis of its food quality. As one can see below, Del
Taco's food quality, as measured by its food costs as a percentage of restaurant sales,
is well below that of most of its peers, including Taco Bell.


Source: Del Taco's own investor presentations


All signs point to the pricing game being over for Del Taco, in my opinion.


As a result, I view TACO's decision to omit guidance from its most recent pre-
announcement press release as a strong sign that the company sees trouble in 2017
and is kicking the can on providing this news to the market.


Given the company will not speak again to the public market until March, I think
investors in TACO would be wise to lighten up ahead of the March call that seems to be
pointing to trouble on the horizon.

Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of


Given TACO's decision to not provide guidance, I think the company sees the 3% Street
consensus bogey as a stretch. As a result, I expect the company to put up a comp that
is well below the Street for 2017, particularly because the pricing growth is rapidly
decelerating and in my view, may even go negative this year given where TACO is
priced versus competitors. On my numbers, I see a flat comp in 2017 driving an
earnings miss of around 5c against consensus estimates of 60c.


At that point, I expect investors to trade this stock more like LOCO, at an 18x multiple
(versus the current multiple of 24x).


Near Term PT: $9.95, but I wouldn't be surprised if "value guys" wait until $9.00 to
soak this up. (30-40% downside)


Longer Term: I wouldn't be surprised if value guys end up accepting that TACO is a
value trap, resulting in a longer term price closer to $5
