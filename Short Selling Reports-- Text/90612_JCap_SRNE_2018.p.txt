Initiation Report
Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE US)


Terminal Patient
No Cure for Sorrento 
Mismanagement
J Capital thinks Sorrento Therapeutics is a zero.  We think manage-
ment is trying to pump up the share price and personally benefit from 
options at the expense of the company’s underlying value. We think 
that management’s focus on creating personal wealth has actually 
destroyed the potential that Sorrento once had. 


You should assume that J Capital is short SRNE shares directly or 
indirectly and therefore may have a conflict of interest. We encourage 
investors to undertake their own investigation.


 ‣ Management seems to have given away Cynviloq 
(a generic Abraxane candidate), the only promising 
drug the company ever looked like it might com-
mercialize, for a pittance. Sorrento not only sold the drug 
to its chief competitor but then turned around and gave the 
cash payment back to that competitor and, seven months 
later, BOUGHT back 40% of the drug! We calculate that Sor-
rento actually paid the Nant network of biotech companies $6 
mln in the complicated set of transactions.


 ‣ Sorrento’s dilutive financing deals benefit a select 
group of investors close to the CEO. An investor group 
in 2016 took the company to court for dubious dilutive deals, 
and management had to give back options. But the com-
pany is continuing this pattern. It has just registered 34.2 mln 
shares and warrants for sale in two separate S-3’s filed on 
March 22, and we think management and financing partners 
will soon be dumping shares that could be as much as 39% 
of the company’s shares outstanding as of December 31. The 
HK/China-based investors close to the CEO will be able to 
realize gains of >300% in three months.

Initiation Report
Sorrento Therapeutics (SRNE US)


 ‣ We have identified a pattern of circular transac-
tions and capital-intensive joint ventures that nev-
er show results. Many joint ventures have no clear purpose 
and have created no advancement in product development 
to date. JVs with the Nant network of biotech companies to 
which Sorrento contributed $60 mln and circular transactions 
with HK-based biotechnology companies are examples of 
such dubious spending.


 ‣ Sorrento announced a $120.5 mln convertible note 
this morning, ensuring at least an additional 20% dilution 
to shareholders who have already experienced >40% dilution 
in the last 6 months. Given the company’s track record of 
cash incineration and lack of focus with regard to drug devel-
opment, we doubt this will be more than a stop gap and may 
even limit the company’s available options for fundraising 
further funding down the line.


 ‣ We suspect that finance managers may have dis-
agreements with the company, as the company has 
lost a large number of CFOs, accounting directors, and audit 
committee heads, and Deloitte was replaced as auditor in 
March after only two years by relatively low-ranked Mayer 
Hoffman McCann. 


 ‣ Sorrento does not have a single product on the 
market despite $168 mln spent on acquisitions and 
$170 mln on R&D through 2017. Yet the company still 
won’t rule out future acquisitions, and SRNE is still continuing 
to raise and squander money, over the vociferous objections 
of scientists who have associated themselves with the com-
pany. Sorrento has just one product, ZTlido, which received 
FDA approval a month ago. But management calls it “non-
core,” and last week’s registration of shares in Scilex--the 
company responsible for ZTlido—may suggest that the Scilex 
founders have little confidence in the product.


 ‣ Management has a history of making highly promo-
tional claims about its pipeline of drugs, calling its

CD38 CAR-T, for example, “the most advanced” in develop-
ment. This is clearly untrue. Sorrento has fallen far behind 
companies like Celgene in innovativeness and in progress 
toward commercialization.


 ‣ We are aware of one incident where SRNE executives asked 
Bioserv (a subsidiary) to disregard human safety and 
ship a contaminated product. Two former employees 
provided us with a detailed account of an incident in April 
2017 when a senior member of management directed staff 
at the Bioserv subsidiary to ship an injectable drug even 
though the company knew it was contaminated with glass. 
Two executives quit in protest over the incident and at least 
one more was fired, apparently for resisting management’s 
pressure to ship. Fortunately, the company did not ship the 
contaminated medicine.


 ‣ We believe Sorrento is a zero. Even if you think that 
Sorrento’s antibody library and other assets have scientific 
merit, each requires tens of millions of dollars and, more im-
portantly, clear strategic focus to commercialize. Given the 
perilous condition the company finds itself in financially, it 
is hard to understand why any potential acquirer would pay 
more than fire-sale prices.

We believe there is ample evidence to show that management at Sorrento Therapeutics is taking money out of the company that should belong to 
public shareholders. We encourage investors to undertake an investigation and to 
reach their own conclusions.


An unparalleled ethical breach that we were told took place in April 2017 illus-
trates what we believe are consistently low ethical standards at Sorrento.


“I resigned my position with Sorrento” after being asked to engage in “morally 
objectionable” behavior. 


Former Bioserv executive 


Sorrento’s Bioserv subsidiary fills small batches of capsules and vials with pharma-
ceuticals for clients in phase 1-2 testing. Based on conversations with two former 
Sorrento managers who are familiar with the situation at Bioserv, we have learned

If true, the 
story of 
Sorrento’s 
attempt to 
ship glass-
contaminated 
vials of drugs 
in itself 
raises serious 
questions 
about this 
company’s 
viability.


that the company undertook a rush job for a Chinese client in April 2017. To meet 
the deadline, Bioserv agreed to use vials supplied by the client. 


But the solution reacted with the glass, which may have been damaged during 
shipping, and glass flaked off and fell into this injectable pharmaceutical.


The Bioserv managers stopped all processing and provided documentation to Sor-
rento management. But the former employees said that management’s response 
was to yell at the Bioserv team and insist that they must complete the run. Two 
top managers of Bioserv resigned in protest. At least one more employee was fired 
in May, apparently for opposition to management on this issue.


To the extent that this account is accurate, it betrays a lack of ethics in Sorrento. 
We think that an excessively aggressive corporate culture permeates senior ranks 
of the company and extends to a get-rich-quick attitude that is toxic to Sorrento as 
a company. 


How the money leaks out
Our investigations indicate that there are three principal channels through which 
money leaves the company and could possibly get redirected to management: the 
China businesses, transactions with the Nant network of biotech companies and 
acquisitions and financings. 


To and from China
Sorrento China has spent at least $25 mln on Chinese joint ventures, minority 
stakes in other companies, and its own operating subsidiaries, but it has no re-
search results to show and is no nearer to commercialization of any drug. Several 
of the transactions are circular, and none appears to make sense for the research 
agenda. 


For example, Sorrento’s partner 3SBio contributed $10 mln to a joint venture, then 
the joint venture bought $10 mln in Sorrento shares.¹ The Hong Kong-listed Lee’s 
Pharmaceutical (950 HK), bought shares in Sorrento rather than paying the com-
pany for technology.² A cooperation with Lee’s on the ZKAB001 oncological anti-
body has not advanced in nearly four years. Nothing has been heard from Mabtech 
Ltd., to which Sorrento paid $10 mln in 2015, or Yuhan Corp., with which Sorrento 
has had a cooperation for two years. Since Henry Ji is constantly seeking invest-
ment from Chinese sources, we cannot rule out that the ventures may be used as

sweeteners for potential investors by providing capital or fodder for press releases. 
At any rate, it is difficult to determine what Sorrento wants to achieve for share-
holders. 


The same focus on insider benefits is in evidence in the Chinese financing deals. 
The December financing raised $50 mln from five BVI companies that IR told an 
investor are close to CEO Henry Ji and come from his “very extensive network of 
potential investors in China.”³ These financiers stand to gain as much as 308% 
at the Friday, March 23 closing price on an investment made in December. Those 
investors got in at a rock-bottom price.


Sorrento’s Chinese businesses themselves seem to create opportunities for man-
agement enrichment at the expense of shareholders.⁴ 


‣ Who owns the China businesses? Sorrento acquired Concortis Biosystems in 
December 2013 from David Miao and Gang Chen, who became the company 
CTO and senior scientist, respectively. Chinese records indicate that David 
Miao maintained personal ownership until November 2016 even though Sor-
rento had bought it three years earlier, raising questions about whether any 
profits in those years may have gone to him personally. As part of the Con-
cortis deal, SRNE issued 1.33 mln shares, and it appears that Concortis share-
holders have sold out.⁵


‣ And now, another insider: Richard Hui Li, head of China operations, is current-
ly personally an equity owner in the Concortis Biosystems China sub, accord-
ing to Chinese records, which also indicate that Sorrento has injected RMB 


³ The BVI companies are Magnum Opus2, Famous Sino Limited, Top Path Asia Limited, Hongguo International 
Holdings Limited, and China In Shine Investment Limited.

50 mln (almost $8 mln). Li’s share means that he benefits personally from the 
company’s injection of capital and other resources.


‣ Undisclosed management stake: David Miao, who was CTO from 2013-16, is 
40% owner of a company that Sorrento reported controlling, Jiangyin Kang-
nuotai Biotech.⁶ The reference is buried in an exhibit attached to an 8-K filed 
November 14, 2013. That company was capitalized at RMB 5 mln (about 
$800,000) two months before the 8-K, suggesting that Kangnuotai had only 
just been established and could even have been just a mechanism to convey 
that $800,000 to private parties. The 40% equity also could have conveyed 
profits to Miao, if there were any.


‣ Another company in the group, Jiangyin Concortis is 45% owned by David 
Miao’s brother, named Miao Zhenlang,⁷ This company received RMB 3.2 mln 
in capital investment from Jiangyin Kangnuotai, a Sorrento sub.⁸ It is unclear 
why David Miao’s brother should have been involved in a Sorrento-invested 
company. Personal benefit for David Miao is one possibility.


‣ Business on the side: David Miao in March 2014 founded a company called 
Hangzhou Yingbai Rui Biopharmaceutical Technology Co. Ltd.⁹ David Miao is 
also part of the “core technology team” of Ruida Health Group based in An-
hui Province and is legal representative of a drug manufacturing subsidiary 
called Hefei Daruijing. All this indicates that Miao has been actively engaged 
in operating businesses that ostensibly conflict with the interests of Sorrento 
China. 


‣ The official Sorrento office, in Shanghai, is not actually there. When we visited 
the registered address of Sorrento Therapeutics (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., an unre-
lated company was operating on the premises, raising questions about how 
substantive the China operations really are. We spoke with employees at the 
company operating at Sorrento’s registered address, and they had not heard 
of Sorrento. Notwithstanding, TnK Therapeutics on March 25, 2016 injected 
$607,000 into the apparently phantom China company.


‣ In its Q1 2016 report, Sorrento mentioned that it had controlling interest in

suggest that the two are brothers.

Zova Biotherapeutics Inc. In 2014, Sorrento put RMB 27 mln, worth about $4 
mln, into Zova Biotherapeutics for 30% of the company but never explained 
the purpose of the investment or provided the number to investors. This is 
another investment that has no obvious benefit for Sorrento and could benefit 
insiders who sit on the Zova board.


None of these ownership stakes or capital injections is very big. But they suggest 
that Sorrento may be conveying benefits to individual managers without telling 
shareholders.


Circular transactions with the Nant Network
The second major sluice gate for assets out of the company has been the network of 
companies sometimes called the “Nant network.” Sorrento did a dozen deals with 
the Nant network in 2014-15 that culminated in what amounts to the giveaway of 
what arguably was Sorrento’s most valuable asset, the drug Cynviloq.


Cynviloq is a cancer drug that competes with Abraxane. Celgene had bought Ab-
raxane for $2.9 bln in 2010, and the drug is expected to achieve at least $1 bln in 
sales by 2020, triggering a royalty to Patrick Soon-Shiong—who was behind Ab-
raxane.

We simply 
have no clue 
as to what 
compelled 
Sorrento to 
sell its most 
promising 
drug to that 
drug’s only 
commercial 
competitor. 
And Sorrento 
actually 
PAID for the 
privilege of 
losing control 
of Cynviloq.


Vuong Trieu, the co-developer of Abraxane along with Soon-Shiong, formed a com-
pany called IgDraSol in May 2012 specifically to create a Gen 2 version of Abrax-
ane called Cynviloq. IgDraSol partnered in March 2013 with Sorrento. In Septem-
ber 2013, Sorrento acquired IgDraSol in a deal valued at $29.1 mln.¹⁰


In May 2015, Sorrento announced positive results from the “Tribeca trial” of Cyn-
viloq. Then, on May 15, Sorrento sold IgDraSol and Cynviloq to Soon-Shiong’s 
NantWorks for $90.5 mln plus potential royalties on sales.


A scientist we spoke with who is deeply familiar with Cynviloq believes that it had 
promise. The drug is made with chemical polymers instead of the albumin that Ab-
raxane requires, making Cynviloq cheaper to manufacture, more environmentally 
friendly, and potentially able to deliver a higher dose of the critical drug. But Nant-
Works had no incentive to develop the drug. Said a former executive of Celgene, 
“Celgene has a lot of investment in Nant network companies. It was probably just 
taking out a competitor.”


Indeed, as of Q1 2018, no sales of Cynviloq have appeared. The sales agreement 
has been given confidential treatment. According to a public letter to the Sorrento 
board sent by Wildcat Capital Management in 2016, Soon-Shiong publicly stated 
that there had been no progress on Cynviloq since the sale and that all data re-
quired for regulatory approval would need to be redone.¹¹


In sum, Sorrento sold its one shot at a billion-dollar drug for just $60 mln more 
than it had paid to acquire the company. 


But the deal was even worse than that.  Sorrento ended up paying to the Nant net-
work almost exactly what it had received from Nant for Cynviloq.


Right around the time it sold IgDraSol (the Cynviloq company) to NantWorks, Sor-
rento made three deals with NantWorks-related companies:


‣ On April 11, 2015, Sorrento agreed to contribute $40 mln to a joint venture 
with NantCell to develop CAR-T products. It paid the $40 mln on July 8.¹²


‣ On April 29, 2015, Sorrento paid $10 mln to a different Nant network company, 
NantBioScience, in return for 1 mln shares of common stock in this unlisted

company, whose activities and assets were undisclosed.¹³ A week earlier, Nant-
Cell had agreed to pay Sorrento a $10 mln up-front royalty on the licensing of 
immune-checkpoint antibodies.


‣ On July 2, 2015, Sorrento agreed to contribute $40 mln for 40% of another 
joint venture with NantWorks called NantCancerStemCell LLC. The company 
paid $20 mln in July 2015 and, in October, apparently strapped for cash, was 
relieved of its commitment to the rest, and its equity was reduced to 20%.


In total, Sorrento paid to the Nant network a net $60 mln of the $90 mln that Sor-
rento was supposed to receive for IgDraSol. In the 2017 10-K, the company reports:


“Pursuant to the agreement, NantPharma paid the Company an upfront fee of 
$90.1 million, of which $60.0 million was required to be used by the Company 
to fund two joint ventures, as described below. “ (page 107)


So Sorrento had managed to clear $30 mln—less than $1 mln more than it had 
paid for IgDraSol in the first place. But then, last summer, Sorrento lost out even 
on this $30 million. Sorrento admitted that its joint venture with NantWorks spent 
$90 mln to buy back Cynviloq! Since Sorrento owns 40% of that joint venture, the 
company declared an impairment of $36.5 mln.


Not only that, but Sorrento agreed it would pay any licensing fees on future sales: 
“As part of the sale, we agreed with NantPharma to be responsible for and pay all 
milestone and license fees required to be paid to Samyang under the Exclusive 
Distribution Agreement following notification from NantPharma when such mile-
stone and license fees become due and payable.  If such milestone or licenses fees 
become due and payable, the payment thereof could materially harm our business 
and financial condition.”¹⁴ (Sorrento had acquired a critical ingredient of Cynviloq 
from Samyang.)


In the end, Sorrento PAID money¹⁵ to the Nant and gave it it majority control of 
Cynviloq. We’re not sure what Sorrento received in return. Because NantWorks has 
no incentive to develop Cynviloq, we are skeptical that Sorrento will ever receive 
royalties.


¹³ “On April 29, 2015, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement with NantBioScience, Inc., 
or NantBioScience, pursuant to which the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of NantBioScience common 
stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10 million.  As part of the agreement, the Company became a party 
to a right of first refusal, co-sale and drag along agreement with other stockholders of NantBioScience as well 
as an investor rights agreement with certain stockholders of NantBioScience.” 10-Q filed May 5, 2015

In fairness, Sorrento undertook so many deals with Nant network companies in 
2014-16 that we wonder whether an enterprising university might offer a degree 
specifically in reading the Sorrento disclosures. Most deals were revised at least 
once after the initial announcement, and there was almost no information provided 
on what the purpose of the cooperation was or what the money would be used for. 
It is easy to miss things in all the announcements. But maybe that’s the point.


The Nant Relatinoship
The transfers of Cynviloq back and forth between Nant network companies and 
Sorrento are not the only instances of Sorrento’s strange and seemingly circular 
deal making. Some examples:


‣ On March 1, 2015, the company received a commitment of $10 mln from 
NantCell, a Nant network company, in return for licensing CAR-TnK products. 
(10-Q May 5, 2015 page 6)


‣ On March 16, 2015, the company paid $10 mln to Conkwest Incorporated, an-
other Nant company, as part of an investment in Conkwest equity. (2014 10-K 
page 2)


‣ In transactions on December 23, 2014 and March 1, 2015, SRNE agreed to 
sell shares to Soon-Shiong vehicle Cambridge Equities for $41.7 mln. (8-K 
12/23/2014)


‣ SRNE then agreed to pay $40 mln to capitalize its share of a Nant company 
called NantCell.¹⁶


Virtually no cash appears ever to change hands. For example, in the complex 2015 
transactions with Nant, ostensibly yielding $90 mln cash to Sorrento, Sorrento 
booked an additional 1) asset: $89 mln in investment in common stock 2) asset: $10 
mln in cash 3) liability: $99 mln in deferred revenue.  


Sorrento did emerge from a blizzard of transactions with the Nant network with a 
solid asset: shares in the newly listed company Nantkwest (NK NYSE). But on July 
1, 2016, Sorrento inexplicably swapped its NK stake for the SRNE shares owned by 
the Nant Network (8-K 7/72016). In a 13G filed in February 2017, Sorrento reported 


payments plus the $36 mln write-off that Sorrento recognized when the joint venture company repurchased 
Cynviloq.

having no ownership in NK. (13G/A, 2/1/2017)


So why did Sorrento sell IgDraSol?


Some say that Henry Ji desperately wanted to be associated with the successful 
Nant network, and indeed, the company issued many 8-Ks boasting of the coopera-
tion with NantCell. 


Some say that Soon-Shiong outwitted Ji. Others have said it might have been an 
urgent need for cash. “Maybe it was the best they could do at the time,” said a for-
mer executive. Sorrento has increasingly negative free cash flows, but it has raised 
enough financing that it should not face intense pressure to sell assets.


Dealmaker
Sorrento managers were challenged in 2016 for awarding themselves big chunks 
of company equity and were forced to give it back. But enrichment of insiders at 
the expense of public shareholders continues. 


In 2016, the WLA group filed a complaint in the. Delaware Court of Chancery 
against the board of directors for forming random subsidiaries, stuffing them with 
company assets, then handing out options in the subs to management. 


The WLA complaint said: “[T]he Company has been acquiring and/or transferring 
assets to newly created wholly-owned subsidiaries and then issuing significant 
amounts of those subsidiaries' shares back to the Company's executive officers and

Directors through significant grants of options, and warrants for Class B super-vot-
ing stock, all exercisable for nominal consideration, thereby engineering a personal 
benefit for such officers and Directors at the direct expense of the Company and its 
shareholders.” In March 2017, the company had to agree to cancel all the options 
and warrants granted to directors in subsidiaries and reimburse $400,000 to WLA 
for their expenses.


We are not privy to Wildcat’s long-term motives, but the investor’s Q4 2017 sale of 
shares indicates that they may believe that Sorrento has not changed its ways.


We believe there is evidence that the self-dealing had been a pattern for Henry Ji. 
A former SRNE director alleges that Henry Ji deliberately misled the board with 
respect to a contentious option package that he awarded to himself in 2012. He 
alleges that Ji changed the 10-K filing after the board had signed off on it, upping 
his own compensation. We are unable to corroborate the story, but the actions de-
scribed in the 2016 WLA complaint give the story credence.


Giving away equity
Sorrento continues to give up its shares cheaply and to dilute shareholders for dubi-
ous benefit. 


‣ For example, in November 2016, Sorrento agreed to acquire Virttu Biologics 
for $25 mln in shares of Sorrento and TNK Therapeutics for unclear reasons. 


‣ When Sorrento signed a term sheet to acquire Scilex in August 2016, com-
pany executives Henry Ji and George Ng were among the sellers. Considering 
that the ZTlido product appears to be of low value, the deal, which could cost 
anywhere between $47-100 mln, looks expensive.


‣ The deal to acquire Semnur Pharmaceuticals, struck in August 2016, was can-
celed 14 months later, but not before Sorrento paid $6.9 mln in expenses. 


It’s almost as if, once WLA forced the option scheme to end, management found 
new ways to capture value for themselves.


Again, in December 2017, the financing created massive dilution for what looks 
like a very low price. Over 2017, Sorrento expanded its share count from 50.9 to 
87.4 mln shares, or by 72%.


Former executives of the company with whom we have spoken are brutal in their 
condemnation. Six executives we spoke with complained that there is no research 
focus and that resources are wasted on non-core activities. One former executive 
echoed the general view when he said: “Looking at their program, there’s really no

focus. Things just come into the company on a whim.” 


Another said that Sorrento acquired assets with “absolutely zero expertise in these 
areas.” He called the acquisitions “pretty crappy stuff.” 


With a burn rate of more than $20 mln per quarter, Sorrento goes through a tre-
mendous amount of capital, considering that the company has no product to manu-
facture, promote, or sell. Much of the money goes into opaque ventures that regu-
larly get revalued. In 2017, for instance Sorrento reported non-cash income on cost-
method investments of $116.2 mln. To achieve that, the company revalued Nant 
network investments from $112 to $237 mln. That means that substantially all 
therevenue for the year was non-cash based and could easily be manipulated.  


“Not much reason to call themselves a 
biotech company”
In its focus on dealmaking, Sorrento has lost any scientific edge it had. 


Sorrento’s biggest promise to investors is built around a pipeline of pre -Phase 1 
CAR-T therapies targeting multiple myeloma. In reality, the only CAR-T the com-
pany is developing is the CD38 for myeloma, and in that, Sorrento is far behind the 
competition and seems not to understand what’s at stake.


In the slide below, Sorrento makes the preposterous argument that its CD-38, so 
named because it binds to a particular type of cell, is somehow as good as two CD-
19s. 


“CD” is an abbreviation for cluster of differentiation and names cells according to 
antibodies that bind to them. The idea that CD-38 is greater than or equal twice

CD-19 is like stating that five times yellow equals pizza. 


If we overlook this promotional slide and focus of the intrinsic merits of CD-38¹⁷, 
we find that it is indeed a good target for the treatment of multiple myeloma. So 
good, in fact, that Johnson & Johnson already has a drug approved to treat it called 
Darzalex. The Darzalex data on Progression-Free Survival (PFS) are quite impres-
sive.


The Darzalex data did not escape the attention of the industry. At least 20 com-
panies are developing other CD-38-directed treatments, including antibody drug 
conjugates, bispecific antibodies, and CAR-T approaches. An incomplete list of com-
petitors is shown below.

With at least 17 competitors, we question why the company would describe itself 
as having the “Most Advanced CD38 CAR-T program in Development.” Is the com-
pany really “industry-leading,” as the corporate presentation says? 


This slide does a better job explaining what SRNE really want investors to focus 
on, the stock price. 


No relief – the $50 mln band aid
As if the Cynviloq story weren’t proof enough that this company is going nowhere, 
Sorrento managed to get its first product ever approved in February this year—
and then turned out to have no plan for getting it to market. A former executive 
said that most companies would have prepared a marketing and distribution plan 
six months before FDA approval, yet ZTlido was approved in February, and there 
is still no plan to manufacture or sell it, a point IR confirmed to an investor. The 
company told this investor that ZTlido is “not a core strategic asset” and that the 
company will be looking to fund it independently or to divest. 


Some might argue that SRNE was waiting for approval. But pre-approval, SRNE 
was indicating a 95% probability of approval, rendering that explanation moot. 


The product itself, ZTlido, takes lidocaine, a drug that’s been around for 70 years, 
and delivers it on a skin patch. But even this modest achievement is a me-too: we 
count at least 10 commercial lidocaine patches, and they deliver more pain medica-
tion than does ZTlido, which has a 1.8% concentration. IR says that the superior 
adhesive enables the patch to deliver lidocaine more efficiently. CEO Henry Ji calls 
the lower dose an advantage for ZTlido, because the patch is safer for children and 
animals who might eat it if they find it discarded. Oh, and the ZTlido patch sticks 
better to the skin.  Whatever the case, these are minor advantages.


The market-dominant lidocaine patch is called Lidoderm and has been sold by 
Endo International plc (ENDP NASDAQ) since 1999. Challenged by ever-more ge-
nerics, Lidoderm saw its revenue fall in 2017 from $88 mln to $57 mln, and Endo 
warned of further competitive challenge: “Our revenues from LIDODERM® have

been negatively affected by Actavis’s September 2013 launch and Mylan’s August 
2015 launch of their lidocaine patch 5%, generic versions of LIDODERM® , and we 
anticipate that these revenues could decrease further should one or more additional 
generic versions launch,” Endo warned in its 2017 10-K (page 19). 


Other popular brands of a lidocaine patch 
include Xylocaine, Recticare, Anecream, 
Akten, Xylocaine-MPF, Topicaine, Eha, Lido-
caine Viscous, and Endoxcin.


In other words, Sorrento’s single marketable 
product is a Band-Aid with some analgesic 
cream.


The problem is that Sorrento has no im-
minent roll-out plan. “I’m not aware of any 
sales force that’s been built to sell that drug 
or any partners to sell the drug,” said a for-
mer executive. We confirmed with IR that 
there are unlikely to be any sales in 2018. 


Not much science
The rest of the company is a grab bag of biotech ideas without a development fo-
cus. There is a pain medication idea based on chili peppers called Resiniferatoxin 
(RTX). Sorrento announced it would spend $60 mln in cash and stock for a com-
pany called Semnur Pharmaceuticals to help develop that injectable pain medi-
cation then it terminated a year later. A former executive expressed dismay that 
Sorrento had pursued this distraction instead of focusing on Cynviloq. The com-
pany also has a strong library of human antibodies and some G-MAB technology, 
based on the use of RNA transcription for amplification of the antibody variable 
domains. 


Ji does have credentials as a scientist, but not really in biotech. His PhD is in ani-
mal physiology. He has only an undergraduate degree in biology and no record 
of published research papers in peer-reviewed journals. Even the highly promo-
tional Chinese program “Chinese People Abroad” reports that the full extent of 
Ji’s research career consisted of a few years when he did his own research out of 
a garage and “read a large number of books on financial investment and acquired 
self-educated financial knowledge.”¹⁸ His former colleagues all seem to share the

same view: Ji wants to make deals, not do research.


In general, Sorrento has a deep bibliography of company presentations, many of 
them dangling the idea of massive deal values. It has no manuscripts in peer-
reviewed journals.¹⁹ 


Sorrento was launched on the basis of an antibody library. But in nearly a decade 
as a public company, no one has figured out how to commercialize it.


 “Unfocused,” said a former executive. ”Sorrento doesn’t “have much reason to call 
themselves a biotech company,” said another.


A former executive said it best: “They’re selling hype, a dream that something will 
happen.”


Building crisis
Now, senior managers are leaving so fast that Sorrento can hardly issue the 8-Ks. 
Asked if he thought there was any value in the company at all, one former execu-
tive said no. Another said he congratulated himself for having sold out long ago. A 
third? “I wouldn’t put my money in this.”


Two highly placed executives have told us they were forced out by the CEO when 
they demanded internal investigations or expressed opposition to acquisition deals 
Ji had proposed—and did anyway. Resignations just since 2014 include:

replaced on March 19 after Dean Ferrigno, the chief accounting officer, had 
also resigned. The new CFO, Jiong Shao, is a lifetime investment banker who 
does not have an accounting degree and is not a CPA. Shao’s principal qualifi-
cation, according to the company, is that he “helped to raise billions of dollars 
from investors.”


‣ The company has employed at least three quality assurance officers/quality 
VPs since 2015 who must ensure that submissions to the FDA are accurate 
and complete. Losing such officers can be as concerning as losing financial 
control officers.


We spoke to six former C-Suite executives, all of whom painted Sorrento as a petrie 
dish for deceit and self-dealing, a company that encourages its employees to hug 
the line of legality and sometimes even cross it.


That makes the departure of Sorrento’s auditor all the more suspicious. Sorrento 
appointed Mayer Hoffman McCann as auditor in March 2018 after Deloitte had au-
dited the company for just two years. MHM was fined $675,000 by the SEC in May

2015 for violating professional standards. The appointment came just two days 
before the resignation of accounting chief Dean Ferrigno. The company had been 
without a CFO for nine months, since the last CFO, Kevin Herde, resigned, and only 
recently appointed Jiong Shao, who is a banker rather than a CPA. This is a compa-
ny in which whistleblowers get fired or resign, and we think the chances are good 
that accountants left under protest.


After speaking with a half dozen former executives and directors of Sorrento, we 
have not found a single one who had a positive word to say about Henry Ji or com-
pany management generally. Terms used included "morally objectionable," “self-
dealing,” “my worst professional experience,” and Sorrento itself as “a "House of 
Cards." We asked a former board member whether he knew of anyone who would 
say anything positive about Sorrento. He said: “I seriously do not know anyone, and 
my network here in San Diego is pretty extensive.” 


After careful work on this company, we are frankly shocked at the cynicism and the 
high-handed actions of management. Sorrento has squandered its potential on get-
rich-quick schemes that don’t even work. Whatever the few scientific assets may be 
left in the company cannot be salvaged unless the company is dismantled and sold 
for its parts.
