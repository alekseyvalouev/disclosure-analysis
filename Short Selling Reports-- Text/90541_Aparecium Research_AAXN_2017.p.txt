Axon Enterprise: Questionable Accounting, Possible SEC Scrutiny and Material
Weaknesses in Financial Reporting


We are short Axon Enterprise (AAXN)  because we believe that the company is worth
far less than its current market value. We believe that Axon has overstated its underlying
profitability and inflated its revenue growth through very aggressive accounting, where
future revenue and profits are pulled forward and associated costs are deferred far into
the future.


1


2


Moreover, Axon has disclosed a number of material weaknesses in its internal controls
over financial reporting, including weaknesses in revenue recognition. Its long-time CFO
resigned earlier this year and has been selling stock aggressively. We believe we may
have uncovered evidence of a potential undisclosed SEC investigation, which further
increases our concerns about Axon’s financials.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAXN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
With apparently inflated conductive electrical weapon (“CEW”) sales, declining body
camera market share, a body camera hype cycle dying down and a stock trading at 48x
consensus 2018 earnings, we believe Axon may have resorted to aggressive sales
tactics, including questionable cash payments to political officials and others to boost
sales.


We believe that Axon shares are 39-56% overvalued. If investors were to apply
accounting that reflects the underlying fundamentals of the business, we believe that
Axon’s earnings would be c. 50% below what it currently reports. Further downside may
exist if CEW sales normalize, body camera market share continues to decline and body
camera hype dies down.


We believe:


Aggressive accounting changes have dramatically inflated Axon’s reported
profitability by more than 50% and revenue growth by over 33%


1.


Material weaknesses in internal controls, CFO resignation, potential ongoing
SEC investigation, delayed filing of 10-K and accounting adjustments further
highlight our concerns about Axon’s aggressive accounting


2.


Free cash flow is collapsing (and now negative) while adjusted profits soar3.


There exists a disturbing pattern of questionable payments to politicians,
police officers and other key decision makers


4.


Weapons division sales and profits are dramatically inflated due to aggressive
accounting and catch-up demand


5.


Body camera hype is fading and Axon is rapidly losing market share6.


Axon shares are overvalued by 39-56%7.


Part 1: Aggressive accounting changes have dramatically inflated Axon’s
reported profitability by more than 50% and revenue growth by over 33%
We believe that Axon is dramatically inflating its financial performance through
aggressive accounting. Specifically, we think Axon is overstating its “true” EBITDA by
more than 50% and its revenue growth by over 33%. Axon reports double-digit non-
GAAP EBITDA growth but we think “true” EBITDA is actually shrinking by almost 50%.


Axon is pulling-forward revenues from as far as five years into the future while deferring
associated costs as far as five years into the future. We also think it is possible that
Axon has adjusted its revenue allocation away from warranty (deferred) towards
weapons (recognized at once).


The accounting choices taken by Axon management are not dissimilar to those
famously taken by Enron, in our opinion. One of Enron’s main accounting tricks was to
pull-forward revenue from future periods to exaggerate performance in current periods
(in Enron’s case, this was through mark-to-market accounting on futures contracts).  In
our view, Axon’s TASER 60 and TAP programs are to Axon what energy futures
contracts were to Enron.

We evaluate each program in detail in the following sections. Before diving in, we begin
with a simple chart that highlights a powerful and disturbing trend at Axon – namely that
an increasing amount of sales and profits appear to be recognized through “revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables.” These sorts of arrangements allow
management to estimate when and how revenue, costs and profits are recognized and
can be highly discretionary. Axon’s use of this accounting treatment has risen by a
whopping tenfold since 2013, and now represents 43% of total revenues as of H1
2017.
Source: Axon financial reports


With that in mind, we now dive into each of Axon’s programs that we believe are being
used to inflate profits by more than 50%.


The TASER 60 Program appears to be used to pull forward revenue and profits


Axon launched a sales program called “TASER 60” in the second quarter of 2016.
Under this plan, customers are able to “subscribe” to Axon products, including weapons,
cartridges, batteries, spare parts and warranty, for a period of 60 months (5 years).


Source: Axon website
While a normal observer might expect that Axon would recognize revenue under the
TASER 60 program on a straight-line basis over the course of its contract, this is not the
case. Instead, the implementation of this program and the accounting treatment that
Axon chose allowed the company to recognize all revenues associated with
weapons and cartridges on day one instead of recognizing them ratably over the
course of the five-year contract. To put it plainly, we believe this allows Axon to
recognize up to five years’ worth of revenue on day one of the contract.4


Based on Axon’s disclosed price list for the TASER 60 Plan,  the weapon and
associated products represent 80% of contract value.

Source: Axon


We estimate that, by what we believe is inappropriately pulling-forward revenues
associated with TASER 60 plans instead of recognizing revenue more in line with how
cash actually flows to Axon, the company inflates current period revenues by a
whopping five times.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-150764554822724_origin.png
Source: Axon, our estimates


The impact of TASER 60 on reported profitability can be estimated by looking at a
footnote called “Other Long-Term Assets” that Axon started disclosing in Q3 2016. This
footnote quantifies an account called long-term accounts receivable. Axon describes this
account as “balances related to sales made under the Officer Safety and TASER 60
Programs… these balances are collectible over the stated contract period, which is
typically five years…”  We believe that the change in long-term accounts receivable is a
good proxy for the pull-forward from TASER 60 and related programs. We note,
however, that this could be conservative given that it does not account for the pulled-
forward sales that occur within twelve months, which would presumably be in the current
accounts receivables account.

Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


The impact on reported profitability is enormous. We estimate that the aggressive
TASER 60 accounting treatment has exaggerated reported adjusted EBITDA by 40%
over the past twelve months. We note that Axon must begin to lap the most aggressive
of these changes starting in Q3 2017.

Through numerous FOIA requests, we have found a number of tangible examples of
what appear to be dramatic revenue and profit inflation. For example, the Las Vegas
Metro Police Department has ordered an average of 240 CEWs per year since 2012. In
2016, it signed a TASER 60 contract for 1,604 CEWs over five years, allowing Axon to
recognize shipments almost seven times higher than it previously recognized under
normal sales programs.


Source: Las Vegas Metro Police Department (via FOIA request)


Jacksonville’s Police Department is another good example: it ordered an average of 153
CEWs per year between 2007 and 2015. In 2016, it signed a TASER 60 contract for
2,500 CEWs over five years, allowing Axon to recognize shipments more than sixteen
times higher than it previously recognized under normal sales programs.

Source: Jacksonville Police Department (via FOIA request)


The Jacksonville Police Department example is interesting for another reason too:
through FOIA requests, we may have uncovered some evidence that Axon is potentially
allocating a larger percentage of TASER 60 deals to weapons (which it can recognize
immediately) and away from warranties (which it can only recognize over five-year
terms). If true, this would further exaggerate the front-loading of revenue that Axon is
enjoying from its aggressive accounting choices.


In the example below, we show that sales to the Jacksonville Police Department in 2015
and 2016 have an important difference – namely that the amount allocated to the
warranty component of the transaction appeared to fall from $112.95 per unit to $0.00
per unit in 2015 vs. 2016. If this invoice reflects Axon’s accounting choices, it implies
that the company may be able to report an even larger percentage of revenues up front
than even its aggressive accounting would suggest (~100% vs. ~80%), further inflating
revenues by an additional 10%.

charge


The relevant parts of the Jacksonville Police Department orders can be found below:

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-1507645762504813_origin.png
But that’s not all. It appears that, at the same time as the amount allocated to warranty
expense fell to zero, the amount allocated to the CEW increased from $899.95 to
$969.60. Thus, Axon would have been able to report increasing ASPs when ASPs
(including warranty), could have actually been declining. We note that it is of course
possible that Jacksonville’s invoices differ from Axon’s billing practices, but we think it
would be a strange coincidence, indeed, if the changes to Axon’s accounting and
Jacksonville’s invoices randomly occurred at the same time.

Changes to Taser Assurance Plan (“TAP”) accounting appear to be used to pull
forward revenue and profits


Axon launched the TAP program in 2012 to encourage repeat purchasing and to reduce
the replacement cycle of weapons (7-8 years) down to a lower number. TAP provides
warranty coverage for CEWs (five years) and body cameras (2.5 years) and upgraded
weapons after five years to customers who enroll.7


Source: Axon website



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-1507645780241191_origin.png
In the second quarter of 2016, Axon made an important change to its accounting for
TAP, yet buried it in the footnotes of its SEC filings and didn’t talk to investors about it
during earnings calls. This change appears to allow the company to further front-
load revenues by shifting revenue recognition for TAP sales from “generally at the
end of the contract period” to “generally when the new product is delivered.”


Old policy in 2015 10-K8


New policy in Q2 2016 10-Q  9


Cartridge subscription program appears to be used to pull forward revenue and
profits


We believe that Axon is likely to face major growth problems as it laps the adoption of its
aggressive revenue recognition policies later in 2017. To offset this, the company
appears to be expanding its aggressive accounting programs to new categories.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-1507645796324336_origin.png

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076458341603684_origin.png
In early 2017, Axon introduced a new subscription program that allows for customers to
buy cartridges on a five-year plan, paying five equal annual installments.  We believe
that this new program shares the same aggressive revenue recognition policies as
TASER 60 and TAP and is thus further pulling forward revenue from as far as five years
into the future.


10


While Axon does not provide enough disclosure to isolate the accounting impact from
this new program (and we believe cartridge sales are already inflated through TASER
60), we do not think it is a coincidence that the company reported the highest cartridge
revenue quarter in the company’s history in Q1 2017 – right when the new program was
implemented.


Source: Axon financial reports


We note that Axon must begin to lap the elevated cartridge sales starting this quarter
(Q3 2017).


Unsustainable benefits from catch-up adjustments at ~100% margin inflate
reported revenue and profits, in our opinion



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076458665447116_origin.png

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076459031241872_origin.png
For the past four quarters, Axon has recognized “catch-up” payments from business
completed in previous periods. While management did disclose the revenue benefit of
these payments, it did not highlight the much more significant profitability impact, in our
opinion. Based on our research, we believe that these catch-up payments are roughly
100% margin (i.e. they have no associated costs). We thus estimate that these one-
time adjustments boosted reported Adjusted EBITDA by 11% over the past four
quarters. This should be a material headwind to Axon’s reported growth and profitability
in 2017 if these admittedly “one-time” adjustments do not recur, in our opinion.


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


While aggressively pulling forward sales, Axon appears to be deferring the costs
associated with these sales to further inflate reported profitability


Aggressive revenue recognition isn’t the only game Axon management appears to be
playing. Amazingly, while management is willing to massively front-load revenue
recognition from five-year pay-as-you-go deals, it defers sales commissions associated
with such deals over the course of five years! Thus, almost all revenue is recognized
day one, while only c. 5% of the associated sales commissions are recognized in the
matching quarter, based on our understanding. 



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-1507646066487713_origin.png
We estimate that this policy allowed Axon to defer 24% of total sales commission
expense in 2016 and, in 2017, Axon has recognized lower commission expense
compared to last year, despite deferred commission balances continuing to rise.
Though the absolute dollar value of sales commissions is not disclosed by Axon, we
believe we can reasonably estimate this benefit through looking at disclosed changes in
commissions over time, including the balance only recently disclosed by the company in
its long-term asset footnotes.


Source: Axon financial reports and commentary, our estimates


Conclusion: We believe Axon has overstated its true economic earnings by over
50% in recent periods and exaggerated its true revenue growth by more than 33%


The accumulation of aggressive accounting choices has a huge impact on Axon’s
reported financial statements, in our opinion. We calculate that Axon’s true economic
earnings were 55% lower than reported by the company for the past twelve months.
Moreover, we note that the company must begin to lap the largest gaps between our
estimate of EBITDA and its reported EBITDA starting this quarter (Q3 2017).

Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


Our adjustments to reported non-GAAP EBITDA figures also imply that, despite
reporting 18% y/y growth in adjusted EBITDA over the past twelve months, we believe
that Axon’s profitability is actually falling rapidly. We estimate that Axon’s adjusted
EBITDA in Q3 2016-Q2 2017 would have declined by a whopping 36% had it used
what we believe to be appropriate accounting.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076461877691667_origin.png
We believe that Axon’s accounting choices paint a highly inaccurate picture of the
underlying economics of the business. In addition to the major exaggerations of reported
profitability discussed above, we believe these accounting choices may mislead
investors about revenue and revenue growth.


We think that the aggressive revenue pull-forward from TASER 60 and, combined with
the catch-up payment realization, are overstating Axon’s reported revenue by 10% over
the past twelve months. Once again, this issue has gotten worse as time has passed,
growing from 1-4% of reported revenue in H1 2016 to 10-14% in Q4 2016-Q1 2017. We
also note that Axon must begin to lap the more aggressive part of this gap starting next
quarter (Q3 2017).


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


We believe that the increasing levels of revenue exaggeration at Axon have also inflated
its reported revenue growth rates by a material amount. In 2016, Axon grew 30%
slower than it claimed to have grown, in our opinion. Once again, the situation
deteriorated as time went on, with trailing twelve-month growth exaggerated by an
estimated 34%.

Part 2: Material weaknesses in internal controls, CFO resignation,
potential SEC investigation and insider selling


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


You don’t need to take our word for it – you can read what Axon writes in the footnotes
of its own annual report. In the company’s most recent 10-K,  Axon states that its
installment payment programs and TASER 60 (which we believe pull forward lots of
revenue) are among the main drivers for the revenue growth it enjoyed in 2016. It writes:


11


Questionable and aggressive accounting choices seem to be catching up to Axon and
attracting the attention of Axon’s auditors and the SEC, in our opinion.


In this section, we will discuss how the aforementioned aggressive and what we believe
to be inappropriate accounting choices dovetail with a culture of poor governance and
present evidence that suggests that the SEC may be investigating Axon. We find this
pattern to be highly concerning given the departure of the long-time CFO earlier this
year and aggressive insider selling by the CFO and others.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076462566285417_origin.png
Significant and increasing material weaknesses in internal controls over financial
reporting


Any time a company derives a substantial portion of its growth, revenue and profits from
accounting policies that are heavily reliant on estimates of future earnings, an investor
should be skeptical. If such a company also fails to maintain adequate controls over its
financial reporting, an investor should run for the exits.


According to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a material
weakness is a deficiency that is sufficiently severe “such that there is a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.”12


Source: PCAOB


Axon not only has disclosed material weaknesses over its internal controls over financial
reporting, those weaknesses appear to be multiplying!


In Q2 2016, Axon disclosed that it had identified two material weaknesses in its internal
controls over financial reporting.13


Weakness #1: Identification and recording of liabilities resulted in what we regard as
inappropriate accounting for out-of-period adjustments


1.


Weakness #2: Revenue recognition and deferred revenue reporting problems which
resulted in the company not recording such transactions appropriately


2.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076462964227805_origin.png

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076463535832722_origin.png
Given that over one-third of Axon’s growth and almost half of its profitability in recent
periods is based on what we believe to be its aggressive and inappropriate choices for
revenue recognition and deferred revenue, we find the second weakness above, in
particular, to be highly disturbing.


Unfortunately for Axon, the pattern only appears to be worsening. In the footnotes of its
delayed 2016 10-K, Axon buried more bad news for investors – namely, that two
different material weaknesses had been identified.14


New Weakness #1: Internal controls over revenue recognition, cost of goods sold
and services delivered as well as reporting of deferred revenue


1.


New Weakness #2: Account reconciliations and monitoring process2.


Axon’s auditors at Grant Thornton also chimed in, writing that it believed that “the
Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016.”


Amazingly, another weakness was identified and added to company disclosures in Q1
2017, this time relating to income taxes.


These weaknesses have persisted into at least Q2 2017, according to Axon’s most
recent 10-Q , though the company continues to hope they are fixed soon.15


The SEC may be investigating Axon


It would not surprise us if Axon’s aggressive and, in our view, inappropriate accounting
practices have caught the eye of the SEC or other regulators.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076464179008873_origin.png
The SEC has clearly shown interest in Axon over the years, with twenty two disclosed
letters between the SEC and Axon management filed on sec.gov since 2005.  While
the SEC has not disclosed any questions or comments to Axon on its 2016 annual
report yet (perhaps because it was delayed?), we find the line of questioning from
September 2015 regarding the 2014 annual report to be troubling for Axon . The two
SEC comment letters appear to focus on many of the same issues we raised earlier in
this report.

Request to provide more disclosure to investors about revenue recognition policies,
citing TAP specifically


1.


Request to increase disclosures on sales growth2.


We filed a FOIA request with the SEC to collect any documents related to current or
past investigations of Axon by the SEC. Commonly, when federal agencies have an
ongoing investigation, they will not release documents to a FOIA request – this is
exactly the response we received. We believe that the response letter indicates a
possibility that Axon is currently being investigated by the SEC, and – given the
questions in the 2015 review – it is reasonably possible that it relates to revenue
recognition policies.

CFO resignation and stock sales raise further red flags


With increasingly aggressive accounting, material weaknesses piling up and a potential
SEC investigation, we find it troubling that long-time Axon CFO Dan Behrendt
chose to leave the company, with no apparent replacement at hand.
Simply getting out of Dodge doesn’t appear to have been enough for Mr. Behrendt.
Since the announcement of his departure from Axon in November of last year,  he
reduced his Axon holdings by 50%, and continued to sell despite the lower Axon share
price.

Source: SEC filings, InsiderScore, our estimates


We find it strange that Mr. Behrendt was paid severance well above any maximum
payout scenario where he could have been terminated without cause or for
death/disability. On the Q4 2016 call, Axon highlighted that CFO severance expenses
would be $1.5 million ($600k in the quarter, 900k in Q1 2017). In the most recent proxy
statement, we can see that Mr. Behrendt was only due between $823,956 and $973,956
in any non-change-of-control termination scenario, meaning it appears that he was paid
almost 2x what he was owed.19
Source: Axon SEC filings


Would you rather work for an air freshener company or Axon? The former CFO
chose air fresheners


Mr. Behrendt clearly must have misunderstood the Axon “bull case” as he resurfaced
soon thereafter as the CFO of Charlotte, NC-based ScentAir, which bills itself as “the
largest and most experienced scent marketing firm in the world.”20


Source: LinkedIn page for Dan Behrendt
Part 3: Free cash flow is collapsing (and now negative) while adjusted
profits climb


While ScentAir is a private company that does not disclose revenue or profits, we note
that it is almost certainly smaller than Axon. A December 2014 AdAge article said the
entire scent-marketing industry was only $300 million.21


The percentage of Axon’s revenue that is generated from cashless sources has
increased dramatically over the past year. At the same time, the expansion of the Axon
and Evidence.com businesses has transformed the company from capital-light to
capital-heavy through significant investments in IT infrastructure.


The combination of these two factors has had a profound impact on the ability of the
company to generate free cash flow. In fact, trailing twelve months free cash flow is
now negative for the company and appears to be getting more negative each
quarter.

Part 4: Disturbing pattern of questionable payments to politicians, police
officers and other key decision makers


Conveniently for Axon, it simply hides this fact through its focus on adjusted EBITDA, in
our opinion. Adjusted EBITDA has remained resilient while the underlying free cash
flows have disappeared. As of 2016, Axon was only able to convert 21% of adjusted
EBITDA into free cash flow, compared with 77-85% before the implementation of
TASER 60 and related plans. In 2017, this math isn’t even possible because, while
adjusted EBITDA remains elevated, free cash flow is now significantly negative.


Source: Axon financial reports


While once upon a time, it may have been reasonable to value Axon on a multiple
of adjusted EBITDA (as many sell-side analysts and bullish investors continue to
do today), we think such an analysis is entirely inappropriate given the
disappearance of the free cash flow that supported Axon’s chosen, non-GAAP
accounting metric.


We believe we have uncovered substantial evidence that Axon regularly provides cash
payments and other benefits to key decision makers that could perhaps be used to
influence their decision to buy Axon products, in our opinion. While we found many
potentially inappropriate relationships, we chose to focus on some of the more
egregious situations we have seen in this report.


Paying key decision makers through political contributions who then choose
Axon products

We have uncovered a disturbing pattern of donations from key Axon executives to
politicians who are able to influence purchase decisions of Axon products, including
during periods of evaluation.


Case #1: Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)


The LAPD is one of the largest and highest-profile police forces in the country. In 2014,
when the LAPD put out a request for bids for a large body camera contract, Axon went
to great (and perhaps unethical) lengths to win the business, in our opinion.


Seven separate Axon executives (including CEO Patrick Smith, President Luke Larson,
CFO Daniel Behrendt, COO Jeff Kukowski and VP of Sales Joshua Isner) and their
family members donated a total of $8,400 to the re-election bid of City Councilman
Mitchell Englander,  who happens to be the head of the Council’s Public Safety
Committee and thus the person most likely to have the most influence over the eventual
winner of the contract. Some (not all) of the aforementioned donations are highlighted in
the table below:

These payments understandably caused an uproar after Axon was awarded an
enormous $31-million contract in a highly controversial bidding process.


Critics of the deal suggested that it violated LA’s Measure H, which sought to prohibit
firms from engaging in “pay to play” tactics to influence city officials who have a say over
lucrative contracts with the city (according to LA Times reporting, highlighted below).



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/10/48713432-15076465444602308_origin.png
While Englander denied wrongdoing by claiming that no bidding process was underway,
the LA Times, in its coverage,  noted that Axon and a competitor were already field
testing their body camera equipment during the period in question.

Axon’s donations also spread to LA County, too, where the company donated $1,500 in
November 2016 to County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas.

Just four months earlier, in July 2016, Ridley-Thomas had voted to speed up a push for
the LA Sherriff’s Department to deploy body cameras.24

Case #2: Baltimore Police Department


As reported by the Baltimore Sun,  Baltimore PD selected Axon’s Axon cameras in
January 2016 in a highly controversial bidding process, where Axon’s nine competitors
for the contract were eliminated in a “technical review” performed by an anonymous
committee without even considering their bid prices. Amazingly, the public wasn’t even
told why the other companies’ contract proposals were disqualified from consideration.


25


Source: Baltimore Sun


We think we have an answer as to why this strange procurement process occurred.
Between 2008 and 2012, Axon employees donated thousands of dollars to various
Baltimore-related election campaigns,  including those of Governor Martin O’Malley,
Rep. Norman Conway, Rep. Joseph Vallario, State Senator Lisa Gladden, State Senator
Brian Frosh, Rep. Keiffer Mitchell, State Senator Victor Ramirez, Rep. John Cluster,
State Senator Joe Getty and many others.

Case #3: Seattle Police Department


Seattle PD selected Axon’s Axon cameras in November 2016.  This deployment was a
big victory for City Council President Bruce Harrell. According to the Seattle Times, Mr.
Harrell had been “actively advocating the use of police body cameras” for “more than
five years.”


27


28


It comes as no surprise to us that Axon’s Associate General Counsel, Isaiah Fields,
donated $700 to Mr. Harrell  a mere seven months before Axon won the Seattle body
camera contract.


29


Source: Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission


The Seattle win was important for Axon, as the investment community had become
concerned over increasing competition and pricing pressure after an embarrassing loss
in New York to Vievu. Axon even bragged about the attractive pricing terms on the
Seattle deal in a November 2016 earnings call.


Question – Mark Strouse: …. Luke, I know you don’t want to get into details, but I just
wanted to press you a little bit more on Seattle. I can appreciate your commentary
around quality versus the price-based competition. But from our side of the house here,
is it fair to say generally that the Seattle contract will be similar to pricing to your other
contracts that you have already secured, despite the NYPD noise?


Answer – Luke Larson: Yes, I think Seattle would be a good proxy…


Answer – Rick Smith: Just to be super clear, the Seattle pricing is consistent with prior
contracts…

Case #4: Memphis


In September of 2015, Memphis purchased $4.5 million of body cameras from Axon in
what was one of the largest contract awards of the year for the company.  According to
multiple press reports, the contracting process was suspiciously expedited in a way that
avoided city statutes on women and minority business participation.


30


A subsequent investigation later that month by WREG News Channel 3 uncovered a
highly suspicious $880,147 “marketing” contract that Axon awarded to Deidre Malone,
who happened to be concurrently serving as campaign manager for then-Memphis
Mayor A C Wharton.31


Source: FOX 13 Memphis


Axon claimed to somehow have no knowledge that Malone’s firm (which bears her
name) and Malone were related, and (after the potential malfeasance was revealed)
decided to cancel the contract by “mutual consent.”


Hiring police chiefs as “consultants” shortly after their departments pay Axon
lots of money


Axon employs a controversial practice of hiring recently retired police chiefs as
“consultants” who perform marketing activities on behalf of the company. While there is
nothing inherently wrong with hiring a retired police chief, we find it puzzling and dubious
that Axon seems to have a pattern of hiring police chiefs who have awarded Axon large,
lucrative contracts in recent years, sometimes by apparently boxing out competitors
from even being considered through no-bid contracts. While there are many cases our
research has uncovered, we discuss four in more detail.


Case #1: Albuquerque


In 2013, Albuquerque awarded to Axon a $2-million contract to supply body cameras to
its police force [APD]. A huge controversy erupted as details of the contract award
process emerged. The police chief at the time, Raymond Shultz, retired shortly after
allegedly tilting the process in Axon’s favor and – just one month later – became a
$1,000 per day consultant to Axon!
Source: KRQE


An investigation by the Office of the State Auditor  concluded that, “[t]he contracts
between the City and Taser circumvented the competitive process, or, in former APD
Chief Shultz’s own words, the process was ‘greased’” and that:


32


Mr. Shultz, the police chief at the time, was being paid by Axon at the same time,
“resulting in a probable violation of City Conflict of Interest and Public Purchase
ordinances and the Governmental Conduct Act.”


1.


Axon provided “personal benefits” to Mr. Shultz and other APD employees2.


Those “personal benefits” coincided with “APD’s dealings with [AXON]” and
“influence over the procurement process” which also resulted in “a probable violation
of City Conflict of Interest and Public Purchase ordinances and the Governmental
Conduct Act.”

Case #2: Ft. Worth


Ft. Worth Police Department became one of the largest users of Axon’s Axon body
cameras after signing a $2.7 million contract in early 2014. An investigation by the
Associated Press  revealed that Ft. Worth’s police chief, Jeffrey Halstead, may have
pushed the contract through the approval process to help Axon meet quarterly earnings
expectations, and may have done so in exchange for free travel and future consulting
fees.


33


Source: Ft. Worth Star Telegram


E-mail exchanges between Axon and Mr. Halstead, as reported by Fox News,  are
nothing short of amazing. In March 2014, Halstead tells an Axon representative that
“someone should give me a raise.”


34
Source: Fox News


Axon apparently did just that. One month after the contract was approved, in April 2014,
Axon paid for Mr. Halstead to attend a technology summit in Scottsdale, Arizona, where
he delivered a speech, posted on Axon’s website, praising Axon’s products and
customer service. Later, in June, Halstead writes that he “cannot even discuss this in a
public setting because it will appear we were taken advantage of.” In June and July
2014, Axon paid for Mr. Halstead to travel to Miami, Florida, and Boston,
Massachusetts, where he was a guest speaker at marketing events.


Mr. Halstead retired in January 2015. In February 2015, he helped Axon host a
technology summit and told the Associated Press that “he hopes to become an ‘official
consultant’ for Taser before he travels to Australia and United Arab Emirates to speak at
similar events…”


Source: Fox News


Once the relationship between Mr. Halstead and Axon was uncovered, the chairman of
the Texas Police Chiefs Association ethics committee said that Halstead likely violated
the association’s ethics code.

Case #3: New Orleans


The New Orleans Police Department signed a $1.4 million deal for 320 Axon cameras in
December 2013. In January 2014, the New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal
Serpas was quoted in a subsequent Axon press release announcing the December
2013 deal, calling Axon’s products “a game changer for police departments here and
around the world.”35
Source: Axon website


Just a couple of months later, New Orleans Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas retired
and signed a consulting agreement with Axon. Shortly thereafter, he spoke at Axon-
sponsored marketing events in Arizona and Canada (alongside Mr. Schultz).


After being confronted with this apparent conflict of interest by the AP, Serpas declined
to say how he was able to land his consulting job and said his role was simply to talk
about how technology affects policing and not to promote products. However, Axon
marketing materials reviewed by the AP use the quote from the January 2014 press
release, discussed above.

Case #4: Chicago


Axon’s early “investments” in newly retired police chiefs continued to pay off. Axon
shares were boosted when Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared he wanted to
double the number of Chicago police officers that would carry a CEW.36


Terry Hillard, former Police Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, served as
a registered lobbyist for Axon during the period where the Mayor decided on the
enlarged CEW program.37


Source: City of Chicago


In what should come as no surprise to anyone who has read this far, Hillard “retired”
from the Chicago PD in 2003, right around the time the city awarded Axon its initial
contract for CEWs.
Source: Chicago Reporter


There’s more: Hillard was serving as a lobbyist for Axon in 2011 when he was appointed
by then-Mayor Richard Daley to serve as interim superintendent of police. In 2012,
Chicago made its largest-ever purchase of Axon CEWs.


Hillard has been such an asset to Axon that he is featured in marketing materials.38

“Master Instructor” program is a way to pay active police officers who then do
lots of business with Axon


Axon has a longstanding program whereby police officers can be certified as “Master
Instructors.” According to Axon, Master Instructors “are independent professional
trainers, serve as local area Taser experts, and assist in conducting Taser
demonstrations at other police departments within their regions.” As of the end of 2014,
there were 747 Master Instructors.39


We find it puzzling and of dubious ethics that Axon is able to pay active police officers to
promote Axon products to their own and other police departments. We think that the real
purpose of this program is to pay officers for their loyalty to the Axon brand and to
implicitly encourage them to buy more Axon products. We believe that Axon pays
Master Instructors to “train” fellow police officers. While Axon removed any mention of
the Master Instructor Program from its Annual Reports in 2015, previous disclosures
suggest that Master Instructors are paid $300 per training session, get reimbursed travel
expenses, are provided a $1,000 cash bonus for training more than 300 officers
annually and are offered a potential five-day trip to Hawaii for the most prolific Master
Instructors.40

Writing “objective” reports and apparently obfuscating authorship
Part 5: Weapons division sales and profits are dramatically inflated due to
aggressive accounting and catch-up demand, in our opinion


As part of Axon’s campaign to overturn competitor VieVu’s winning bid for NYPD body
cameras, Axon enlisted City Councilman Robert Cornegy, who said that he was worried
about VieVu’s products. As reported by Politico, one of the documents Cornegy shared
with the press was purportedly authored by the Cincinnati Police Department. However,
the document’s owner is listed as “IFields” which is likely short for Isaiah Fields (the
same Associate General Counsel who made a questionable donation to Seattle city
council).41


Source: Politico


Another document shared with the press by Cornegy contained metadata that showed it
was last saved by Patrick Jenkins, a political consultant who had been hired by Axon
and was being paid $15,000 per month.


Source: Politico


We believe that – independent of the highly aggressive accounting discussed earlier –
Axon sales and backlog are poised to decline meaningfully over the next few quarters.
We believe that this weakness will be pronounced in both the Weapons and Axon
business lines.


CEW business revenues are far above long-term average levels. We believe that
mean reversion will likely cause segment sales and profits to decline
meaningfully.


Over the past four years, Axon has enjoyed a surge in CEW orders, despite a largely
saturated domestic market. Average annual order volumes between 2004 and 2012
were approximately 70,000, but between 2013 and 2016, average annual orders
skyrocketed to approximately 108,000, or 54% above long-term average order levels.
2016 was even more of an outlier, with CEW orders of 130,000, or almost 2x long-term
average order levels. We think only a very small portion (~10,000 units) of this change
can be explained by increasing international orders.
Source: Axon financial reports


So why did this major acceleration occur? We believe that Axon is currently enjoying a
significant amount of “catch-up” spend from police departments whose budgets were
constrained coming out of The Great Recession. CEO Rick Smith alluded to the
beginning of this trend during Axon’s Q4 2013 earnings call:


Axon has repeatedly claimed that a CEW has a useful life of 5-6 years.  It has further
claimed that many police departments use CEWs for longer than their useful life,
making the average replacement cycle for a CEW somewhere north of 5 years. We
generously assume that the replacement cycle is 6 years long, though our research
indicates that it could be significantly longer than that. Summing all CEW sales over the
past 6 years, would imply a global installed base of 570,549 and an annual level of
replacement demand of 95,092 CEWs. To further highlight the conservatism of this
estimate, we note that there have been only three years in the history of the company
where CEW unit sales exceeded this amount.


42


43


Despite the conservatism of this estimate, it implies a very challenging future for Axon’s
Weapons business. Specifically, if CEW demand returns to our estimate of historical
levels, we estimate that CEW unit sales would fall by 27%. Our math is laid out below:


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


Moreover, TASER 60 accounting also serves to inflate reported unit volumes. We
estimate that this pull-forward program has further inflated shipments by another 12%.


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


If we combine the unsustainable benefits of catch-up demand and TASER 60
revenue recognition pull-forward, we estimate that Axon’s CEW unit sales were
inflated by 39% compared to our estimate of underlying, long-term averages
Part 6: Body camera hype is fading and Axon appears to be rapidly losing
market share


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


Axon’s Weapons division carries very high gross margins, meaning that sales declines
back to normal levels would cause a significant deterioration in segment and overall
profitability. We estimate that, using what we believe to be appropriate revenue
recognition, 2016 revenues would have been 17% lower had CEW sales been at normal
levels and that 2016 adjusted EBITDA would have been 82% lower assuming that
these sales flowed through the P&L at 70% gross margins (in line with the divisional
average).

Is the acquisition of artificial intelligence teams from Misfit and Dextro Axon’s “3D
Systems Moment”?


We couldn’t help but chuckle when Axon announced that it was acquiring the “computer
vision team” from Misfit and a tiny company called Dextro to create an artificial
intelligence [AI] group called Axon AI.44


We remind everyone that Misfit is a low-end, market-share-losing manufacturer of
rubber bracelets that track steps – how it can be viewed as experts in computer vision
and artificial intelligence is beyond us.


Source: Misfit
These acquisitions and the incessant management hype around them remind us of 3D
Systems’ (DDD) January 2014 acquisition of an R&D team out of Xerox (XRX), which it
said, at the time, would give it technologies “a decade ahead” of competitors’.  We note
that this acquisition marked almost the exact top in DDD’s stock price, before it fell over
80% over the subsequent three years.

Axon appears to be rapidly losing market share in body cameras


While Axon bulls like to think of Axon as the dominant player in body cameras, the data
paints a dramatically different picture, in our opinion.


We examined all body camera contract awards that we could find among the top 100
U.S. police departments since 2012. Our data suggests that Axon’s win rate has fallen
from 95-100% between 2012 and 2015 to just 56% in 2016 – a decline of 41%.


Source: Axon press releases, competitor press releases


When we use that data to examine Axon’s declining market share based on officer count
rather than number of police departments, the trend looks even worse; on this basis,
Axon’s market share has declined to just 29% in 2016.


Source: Axon press releases, competitor press releases, police department data


Body camera orders are poised to drop, in our opinion.


The nationwide push to deploy body cameras at police departments has been a
powerful one. However, the industry’s success is poised to turn into its failure. We
estimate that if 75% of patrol officers  ever adopt body cameras, the market is already
48% penetrated after only about three years of existence.

Part 7: Axon shares are overvalued by 39-56%, in our opinion


Source: FBI, company reports, our estimates


A body camera sale is a hardware sale – typically, if you make a sale in one year, you
don’t get to sell to the same customer the next year. If you sell 100 units this year, you
need to find new customers that represent more than 100 units of demand to grow. With
the rapid growth over the past few years (roughly ~1,600 bps of market penetration per
year), we believe it will become increasingly challenging, and then nearly impossible, for
new body camera sales to avoid declining precipitously. In the example below, we show
that the market will be over 100% penetrated by 2020 even if body camera deployments
do not increase at all from 2016 levels (note: we use announced body camera wins as a
proxy for deployments and assume that the addressable market remains unchanged).


Source: Axon press releases, FBI, our estimates


Given the above analysis, we believe that it is nearly inevitable that body camera sales
should decline in the near future. Axon appears to be also losing market share. If this
continues, Axon sales should decline even more than the sales for the industry at large.


We believe that Axon’s reported EBITDA was overstated by more than 55% in the past
twelve months, based on research outlined earlier in this report. 


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


A simple way to value Axon would be to take the current (generous, we think)
Bloomberg consensus 2018 EV/EBITDA multiple (21.5x), discount future EBITDA by
55%, and multiply the numbers together. Such an analysis would imply that Axon
shares were overvalued by 56%.


Source: Axon financial reports, Bloomberg, our estimates
This analysis may be too generous. As previously mentioned, we believe that Axon is
currently shipping more CEWs and body cameras than it is likely to do in the near
future.


In a scenario where A) Axon used accounting that actually reflected underlying business
fundamentals and B) weapons sales reverted to historical averages, we believe Axon’s
revenue would decline by 19% and EBITDA would decline by 88%.


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


A more generous attempt at valuing Axon would separate out the profitable Weapons
division from the unprofitable software and body camera division.


In the Weapons division, we believe that underlying EBITDA is 54% below
currently reported levels. We estimate this by excluding what we regard as
inappropriate accounting treatments and normalizing revenue and profits for long-term
levels of demand.


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


While this may seem like a punitive scenario, we note that this would simply take
divisional adjusted EBITDA back to levels seen just a few years ago.


Source: Axon financial reports, our estimates


Axon has traded at an average EV/EBITDA multiple of 20.0x over the past seven years.
However, before the body camera hype cycle began, Axon routinely traded for 10-
15x EBITDA.
Source: Bloomberg


If we assume that the Weapons division should be valued at 12.5x EBITDA (the
midpoint of the pre-body-camera range), it would be worth $445 million, or $8.31 per
share.


Source: Axon financial reports, Bloomberg, our estimates


In 2016, the Axon division generated $66 million in revenues and lost money. If we
assume that A) the division can double sales and B) it trades at 3.0x sales (aggressive
for a loss-making, hardware-focused company losing market share), it would be worth
$7.38 per share.


Source: Axon financial reports, Bloomberg, our estimates


Putting the two estimates above together, we believe that Axon shares are generously
worth approximately $15 per share, or 39% less than the current share price. 


Source: Axon financial reports, Bloomberg, our estimates


If this, too, seems punitive, we remind investors that Axon (then Taser) shares
traded at well below $10 for over five years between H2 2008 and H1 2013 (pre-
body camera hype cycle).

Risks to our thesis:


1) Investors may not care about the accounting concerns we have identified


2) Investors may not care about the governance concerns we have identified
3) Investors may not care about the payment concerns we have identified


4) Axon may continue to report strong adjusted EBITDA growth


5) Investors may choose to value Axon differently than we have chosen to


 Axon was formerly called TASER International, Inc. (TASR) until it underwent a name
change effective April 5, 2017. See here.

 In our view, this accelerated revenue recognition is aggressive. Accordingly, references
to “aggressive,” “inflated” and “exaggerated” accounting practices, profits, revenue,
EBITDA and earnings throughout document reflect our view of Axon’s accounting
