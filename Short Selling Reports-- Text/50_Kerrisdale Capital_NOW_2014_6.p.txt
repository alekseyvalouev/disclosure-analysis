ServiceNow: Widespread Mistakes In Analyst Share Counts Fuel
Overvaluation
Jan. 9, 2014 9:00 AM ET27 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


It's certainly been a year to remember for investors, with the benchmark S&P 500 up 30%,
the tech-heavy NASDAQ-100 up 37%, and many sectors, including cloud computing,
rising further yet. Last year provided great opportunities to make money, as every dip in
the market has been an excellent buying opportunity.


But the tech euphoria has gotten out of hand in certain sectors. In many ways, the
investing community seems to be repeating its mistakes from the irrational exuberance of
the late 1990s. Many investors are buying stocks not due to fundamentals, but rather due
to sexy-sounding stories of future growth combined with momentum: as in that previous
internet tech era, people are again buying stocks principally because the stocks are
already rising and have garnered investor enthusiasm.


In the case of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), we've already discussed the very low likelihood
that the company can grow into its valuation. Longs are overestimating ServiceNow's
addressable markets and software capabilities. Investors were shown another red flag last
Thursday when NOW's Chief Technology Officer, Arne Josefsberg, who joined the
business in October 2011 after 25 years with Microsoft, unexpectedly resigned from his
position.


But enough has been said about ServiceNow's business prospects. We'd rather focus on
the more basic similarities between the current environment and 1999. One of the most
jarring flashbacks has been the return of extremely sloppy and dubious sell-side research.
While we have not quite hit the excesses of the tech bubble yet, we're seeing disturbing
reminders of that past mania.


During the 1990's tech boom, abuses within equity research led to SEC enforcement
actions, industry bans and a litany of new regulations to curtail the regular exchange of
stock promotion for investment banking business. Reg FD was enacted in 2000, Henry
Blodget was banned from the industry and "Chinese Walls" sprang up all over the industry.


Ten years later, it appears that history is repeating itself. With the IPO and secondary
offering markets as hot as they've been in ages, it seems that banks may again be putting
deal-making ahead of quality research.

In the specific case of ServiceNow, analysts have gotten sloppy on one of the most basic
inputs of equity valuation: the number of fully diluted shares of common stock. Visit a
basic finance website such as Yahoo Finance or Google and you'll see 138.7 million
shares for ServiceNow, leading to a market cap of about $8.1bn at the current $58 share
price. You could forgive an ordinary retail investor for assuming that this information is
accurate.


However, professional investors should always be aware of the total capital structure,
rather than just the number of current outstanding shares, which is one of many inputs to
determine valuation. In the case of young companies, particularly in technology, analysts
can't overlook stock option grants to employees. Since tech startups tend to be short on
cash and long on blue sky potential, they forgo paying higher compensation in the short-
run and defer it via options. Usually this doesn't make too much of a difference in the long
run, but if a company is particularly successful, and/or its shares perform exceedingly well,
the impact of options grants given to executives and early-hire employees can be
dramatic.


ServiceNow has more than 25 million outstanding in-the-money stock options, in addition
to almost 5 million restricted stock units ("RSUs") (2013 10-Q3). With the options having
an average strike price of $8.12 and RSUs providing no future cash to ServiceNow's
treasury at all, these 30 million issued shares represent a tremendous dilutive overhang to
the company's share count. When these 30 million shares convert into common stock, the
company will raise only ~$200 million in proceeds but be burdened with $1.75bn of newly
traded common stock.


In reality there are 169 million shares of ServiceNow, or 165.4 million using the treasury
stock method, rather than the 139 million you see reported at sites such as Yahoo or
Google. And it's excusable that these free finance sites are wrong; you get what you pay
for. This is why an investor should always check a company's filings rather than simply
trusting a free website's computer-generated financial information.


It's less excusable when professional equity research analysts, trained at top business
schools and working at prestigious investment banks, are no more reliable than Yahoo
Finance. We first noted a year ago that several bulge bracket analysts were overlooking
the option pool. We figured that analysts would quickly correct what we figured was merely
a simple oversight.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 3/17


But it's now been more than a year, and analysts are still willingly sticking with their clearly
inaccurate numbers. Numerous banks continue to mislead clients with wildly inaccurate
share counts and market capitalizations for ServiceNow.


Data to calculate the correct share count is easily found in ServiceNow's latest 10Q-3
2013:


Here, we see 138.7 million shares of common stock, 4.8 million Restricted Stock Units
(RSUs), and 25.5 million outstanding stock options. RSUs cost employees nothing to
exercise, so those are virtually assured to turn into common stock as they vest. Now let's
check the outstanding options to see where their strike price is on average:


Given that the average exercise price for the options is $8, compared to a current share
price of $58, and even the most recently granted round of options are still well in the
money, it should be assumed that the vast majority of these options will turn into common
stock as well. Thus, adding together the 138.7 million common shares, the 4.8 million
RSUs, and 21.9 million dilutive impact from the options (using the treasury method), we
arrive at 165.4 million fully diluted outstanding shares, which results in a market cap of
$9.6bn. Not so difficult.


By comparison, below is a quick tour around various investment banks' reports for the
company. These figures were pulled from the batch of October 23-24th reports following
NOW's Q3 2013 results.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 4/17


Wells Fargo claims 137.5 million shares. Did they simply lift this figure from Reuters?


Barclays:


Barclays claims 136.8 million shares. At least Barclays can blame FactSet Fundamentals
for getting it wrong, perhaps?


Credit Suisse:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 5/17


Credit Suisse follows Barclays' lead with a similarly erroneous 136.8 million figure.


Deutsche Bank:


Deutsche Bank diverges from the others using a share count of 147 million (still well off
the correct figure) to arrive at its mistaken market cap, which they make sure to provide in
both dollars and Euros.


Susquehanna:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 6/17


Susquehanna follows the example of several other firms that really like that 136.8 million
share count figure.


Stephens:


Notice that Stephens specifically characterizes its share count as "fully diluted." Not only
does Stephens attach itself to the inaccurate 136.8 million figure, but by including the
words "fully diluted," Stephens earns itself a special spot within the ServiceNow equity
research hall of shame.


Janney:
5/23/2018 ServiceNow: Widespread Mistakes In Analyst Share Counts Fuel Overvaluation - ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 7/17


Janney, not bucking consensus, uses the faulty 136.8 million figure as well.


The preceding reports were prepared before the release of NOW's 10-Q3 2013 on
November 4th. Yet this does not excuse the oversight of the option pool. As of 10-Q2,
NOW still had 136.8 million common shares, 27.5 million options with an average strike
price of $7.16, and 3.9 million RSUs. At a $52.96 share price, this would equate to 164.5
fully diluted million shares, still nowhere near the figures cited in the brokerage reports.


Furthermore, the justification that options are "anti-dilutive" given NOW's ongoing net
income losses is ridiculous. Option grants are not free, nor does the conversion right
disappear, just because a business isn't profitable.


We also want to be clear that there are a handful of firms that do list the correct share
count for ServiceNow. In contrast with all the erroneous tables above, here is a table from
JMP Securities, for example, whose analysts actually did their math properly and account
for the upcoming new shares:


Bravo JMP! For correctly calculating something as basic as shares outstanding!


It is important to note that investment banking analysts normally are capable of
determining the correct number of shares outstanding in a company's stock. It's perplexing
that the majority of the Street won't or can't get the number right here. It truly is unusual to
see so many firms be this wrong about something this basic and remain mistaken for such
a long period of time. By contrast, check out the below November 19th, 2013 price target
upgrade from Citigroup's Yaron Werber:



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371513000061/now-2013630x10q.htm
5/23/2018 ServiceNow: Widespread Mistakes In Analyst Share Counts Fuel Overvaluation - ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 8/17


Werber digs far enough into the weeds to calculate that a previously dilutive convertible
note/warrant package is being retired prematurely, and as such, the consensus view of the
outstanding share count is too high. Not only had the Street (correctly) factored in a
previously announced potential dilutive overhang, but now an analyst realized the
overhang will have been cleared and in turn adjusted the price target accordingly. This is
the sort of analysis we expect from professional investment analysts, which makes the
grossly misleading ServiceNow coverage all the more ludicrous.


Why are the Analysts so Wrong?


The bigger question may indeed be why analysts are unable or unwilling to factor in 27
million shares, or $1.55bn worth of capitalization, of way-in-the-money soon-to-be
common stock. Previously, you could have ascribed the error to mere sloppiness. Perhaps
everyone was pulling their numbers from Yahoo Finance or otherwise not digging into the
SEC filings enough to pull out the real number of outstanding shares.


But since we launched our coverage on ServiceNow more than a year ago and highlighted
the fact that the majority of analysts were using grossly inaccurate share counts, it seems
harder to attribute the misstatement to mere sloppiness at this late date. A simple
oversight like that, once pointed out, is easy to correct.


In theory, there is a so-called "Chinese wall" between the parts of investment banks that
analyze companies and the parts of investment banks that earn fees from companies by
providing them services such as IPO and secondary underwriting advisory. In practice,
however, it is often questionable whether or not there is much separation between the
research and banking arms of financial firms.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 9/17


Take, for example, the recent Evoke Pharma IPO (NASDAQ:EVOK). Aegis Capital was
the sole bookrunner for the Evoke IPO, no doubt earning a healthy fee for its services.
Earlier this month, following the IPO, Aegis' biotech analyst launched coverage for Evoke,
then trading at $8, with a jaw-dropping $60 price target. Needless to say, a 650% upside
target raises eyebrows, and the more conspiratorially-minded person might draw a
connection between Aegis' ambitious price target and Aegis' earning of Evoke's IPO fees.
Any company considering Aegis' IPO services in the future will likely recall the
underwriter's most favorable research opinions for IPOs it has recently underwritten. If you
were seeking to define the phrases "perverse incentive" or "moral hazard" in a business
textbook, this sort of example would come to mind.


Historically, the "wall" between investment research and banking has often resembled
clear cellophane as opposed to anything reliably separating the two divisions. During the
last tech boom, CEOs were openly telling analysts to raise their investment ratings before
they'd consider doing banking business with the analyst's firm. For example, Bernie
Ebbers, former CEO of MCI WorldCom, was asked if he'd do a banking deal with Merrill
Lynch. Ebbers replied, "No. We have to have a better rating before Merrill Lynch would do
the investment banking." This doling out of banking fees based on investment research
ratings was common practice, as former telecoms analyst Dan Reingold, in his book,
recounted: "Bernie [Ebbers] wasn't one to mince words. He simply said aloud what others
thought to themselves."


Later on during the cycle, Jack Grubman, Salomon Smith Barney's former rock star
telecom analyst, was asked by Salomon's president to "take a fresh look" at his long-
standing negative opinion on AT&T. Grubman soon upgraded AT&T shares. Seemingly as
a result, Salomon reaped lucrative fees from a deal involving an AT&T wireless subsidiary
spin-off. Grubman, for doing his part to generate banking business, was able to leverage
his upgrade to get his employer to donate $1 million to the 92nd Street Y so that Grubman
could get his children accepted into an exclusive Manhattan nursery school.


After examples like this, it's no wonder that market participants began to have doubts
about the independence of Wall Street research. Former New York Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer confirmed people's worst fears when his investigation hit the mother lode of
wrongdoing at Merrill. Among internal emails at Merrill relating to Goto.com, a stock they
had a "buy" rating on, Spitzer found one where an investor emailed Merrill about the
company: "What's so interesting about GOTO except banking fees????" A Merrill
research analyst replied: "nothin." Or from one Merrill analyst to another: "I don't want to
be a whore for f-ing management. We are losing people money and I don't like it. john and

mary smith are losing their retirement because we don't want [the CEO of Goto.com] to be
mad at us." In another example, former Merrill analyst Henry Blodget referred to a stock
he had a buy rating on as a "piece of s--t" in an internal e-mail.


Despite all the talk of a wall between investment research and banking fees, it's clear
where Wall Street's biases lie. Which brings us back to ServiceNow, as NOW has been a
most prodigious generator of banking fees itself. A cynical person might suspect that
ServiceNow's propensity to unceasingly emit new stock and debt, and in the process offer
lucrative fees to investment bankers, is in some way tempting analysts to look for the
bright side of ServiceNow's rather cloudy forward business prospects.


Hypothetically, one great way for analysts to juice up their analysis and be able to have
their models spit out more optimistic price targets would be to undercount, inadvertently or
intentionally, the number of outstanding shares. For ServiceNow, by ignoring the existence
of 27 million fully diluted shares, analysts have an extra $1.55bn of breathing room to use
when constructing their valuation estimates.


For a look at this in action, consider Janney's valuation model from its October 7th
Initiating Coverage report for ServiceNow:


Janney employs a discounted cash flow analysis model. Their model assumes optimistic
growth rates of free cash flow, rising from $8 million this year to $74 million by 2015, $339
million in 2017, and all the way up to more than $1.6 billion by 2022. Obviously, it seems a
5/23/2018 ServiceNow: Widespread Mistakes In Analyst Share Counts Fuel Overvaluation - ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1935851-servicenow-widespread-mistakes-in-analyst-share-counts-fuel-overvaluation 11/17


little ridiculous to forecast a 132% compound growth rate of cash generation over the next
five years when in fact ServiceNow's free cash flow generation has been virtually nil over
the past several years and has shown little sign of turning the corner in recent quarters.


But even granting this most optimistic of forecasts, Janney's model still only deduces a net
present value of $53.11 per share ($6.8bn of net present value plus cash). This doesn't
seem bad (or particularly good) given that the stock is trading at $58. But when you realize
that Janney only accounted for 134 million shares, contrasted with the 165.4 million actual
fully diluted shares of ServiceNow, you have to re-run the math. Dividing that $6.8bn of net
present value plus the cash balance of $347m by 165.4 million fully diluted shares, you
see that Janney's real price target is near $43! Even if ServiceNow manages to meet
Janney's lofty operating growth targets, the stock is still overvalued by 25% at present
levels!


And Janney is far from the most optimistic of analysts on the street. Other more bullish
firms have much more outlandish price targets. For ServiceNow, which generates almost
no cash and loses money on a net income basis despite having conquered close to a
quarter of the market share in its rather limited addressable market (particularly since
peak penetration is likely only around 50% given security concerns around using a cloud-
based service for sensitive data), it's hard to fathom what sort of upside analysts are
fantasizing about.


How It's All Going To End


ServiceNow has a reasonably good ITSM product, and it will likely continue gaining share
in that market. From its current 30% market share (Gartner estimates market size near
$1.5bn), NOW could, with good operating performance, get to maybe 50% market share
as more clients move from BMC's legacy solutions to ServiceNow's cloud offering.


The touted great upside of the IT operations and PaaS is simply unlikely to occur. Analysts
are hyper-focused on the platform area because ServiceNow's current operations cannot
come close to justifying the company's daunting $9.6bn market cap. We don't believe the
platform business is sufficiently promising to justify the sky-high valuation multiples.


ServiceNow insiders have been dumping shares, issuing dilutive financings, and waiving
lock-up commitments for IPO shares in order to, it seems, squeeze as much cash as
possible out of its overinflated share price. Wall Street analysts complacently keep offering
up fanciful research opinions including a basic $1.6bn misstatement of ServiceNow's
market cap, while the banking teams keep collecting fees off ServiceNow's latest public
offerings. Needless to say, this probably won't end well for investors late to the party.

Classic tunnel vision.


The only two research groups I have access to that cover this which I think are higher tier banks (MS and UBS) both
accounted for this at initiation in July 2012 (both have diluted shs going up to 165+ in FY2014 in models). You
cherrypicked to back up your view. Of course second rate research will be second rate research, kind of like how free

Author’s reply »  We wouldn't call citing data from seven different banks, including a few bulge brackets,
cherry picking. Quite conversely, you'd have to cherry pick to find banks that consistently get the share count
correct.


Such basic mistakes reflect a generally sense of sloppiness that occurs when the sellside anchors their price
targets near the current trading price, no matter how irrational the valuation level. This tendency to goal-seek
typically becomes most prevalent just before a bubble bursts.

Two initiation reports (from 2012) from MS and Citi research reports had diluted share counts going up to
165+ in FY2014. Agree that current year share count may be misleading but I don't believe professional
investors rely completely on sell-side models and make such amateur mistakes of overlooking sharecount.


Your argument about websites like Yahoo, etc. having incorrect share count is another story -- and this is true
for most IPOs and not just NOW. For example, Yahoo shows TWTR's share count at 545M where as the
correct number is slightly over 700M -- and professional investors are aware of it.


All that said about share count, I do agree that NOW is expensive and probably a good short candidate. This
market seems to be rewarding top line growth without paying attention to the bottom line. Bulls may have their
day until cracks appear in their growth story or flaws are discovered in their TAM estimates / competitive
landscape, etc.

This is great. After NOW reports later this month and the brokers do update reports (but fail to adjust sharecount), you
can do a follow up and keep the pressure on. Looks like it worked really well for Suhail on VEEV.

Kerrisdale, 
Your analysis here is spot on, but back on Nov 15, 2012, you argued that SNOW was overvalued at $30. I work in the
ITSM industry and did a pretty in-depth business case on migrating to SNOW. The high cost of the licensing model
and the security issues you mention were concerns, not to mention the huge investment we've made with BMC being
a sticking factor. My point is, I think your analysis now is much more on target - the ITSM tool they have is great, but it
won't replace everywhere. I too have been watching insiders sell off. Valuation is definitely lower than 58.

I agree. I have been negative on the stock for several months. Almost pulled the trigger on a put position but just
haven't liked the action--not when you know this market is going higher. I forgot about it so thanks for bringing it up.
NOW might be the time to start looking for entry into that position. :)

Important to point out the share count. This is an often recurring problem of ignoring option issuance.

Your diluted share count argument is a classic example of misguided valuation based shorting against every high
multiple high beta group I have seen over the years across cycles. There is theory and there is practice. Your typical
valuation short thesis goes something like this... XYZ stock will never justify its high cost of capital / valuation given
what the "end state" growth rate for the business should be. From what I can tell, that has been the crux of every
NOW article you posted on SA.


Unfortunately, the average growth investor does not go long a stock and wait to see whether the "end state" actually
justifies near-term valuations. As long as you have managements who can play the Street's beat and raise / M&A
game, you will go broke shorting "expensive" stocks without a catalyst to break the ongoing momentum. This is
especially true in bull markets and you may as well be spitting into a hurricane.


Complaining that the diluted share count should be higher since all those RSUs are in the money because of a high
stock price is the same bit of circular logic that shorts make using the options expense argument. Inexperience shorts
mistakenly assume that aggressive growth investors should actually care about excessive dilution. We are talking
about a group of investors who admittedly base part of their buy decision on price momentum. For them, higher prices
begets higher prices.


On a practical note, one commenter noted your fund was short the stock at $30 months ago based on a prior SA
article. Between borrowing costs and additional margin your prime broker has no doubt asked from you since then,
how much more pain and underperformance are you or more importantly, are your investors wiling to put up with from
your hedge fund? Losing money in a year when the S&P is up 30% does not make for happy client meetings.

Author’s reply »  Thank you for your comments and you make a variety of valid points.


In terms of the motivating factors of long holders, I can tell you that when we began exposing U.S.-listed
Chinese companies as frauds, long holders had many non-fundamental reasons to remain long the stock.
Ultimately, we turned out to be right in many of those situations, and generate a higher return than them. I've
always had faith that stock prices ultimately reflect the fundamentals of the business. At some point, higher
prices stop begetting higher prices, and instead lower prices begin begetting lower prices.


In terms of portfolio construction, between the time of our first article on NOW and today, we have managed
client money with a highly net-long exposure. Our shorts did poorly in 2013. Our longs did quite well. I would
be completely shocked if you were to find a single "unhappy" client of our investment management firm.
Someday in the future, we'll probably have an unhappy client, but I don't think there have been any to-date.

Congratulations on good performance. Media reports suggest that most funds did not do well on their shorts
this year in a strong market.


NOW does look expensive and I wouldn't be surprised if the valuation is much lower somewhere down the
road. A consistent message that I have heard from experts is that never short a stock on valuation. I didn't
see any compelling arguments against their business model, products, sales practices, revenue recognition,
etc. that would point to growth deceleration.


One risk with shorting such high growth companies is that market continues to reward them on delivering top
line growth and ever expanding TAM. CRM is one such example.


I am not convinced that NOW is the next CRM. But I will wait to short until I see a solid analysis like short
VEEV (from Suhail Capital).

I would be unhappy if my portfolio manager was down over 100% on a momentum position and is making the
same argument as last year about how overvalued it is. If you were a real money manager, you wouldn't be
wasting your time posting B.S. articles to try to create fear and panic sales. I look forward to reading your
article on the share count in 2015 when NOW is over 100/share.

I am short with long puts, so my eventual loss is limited. 
Started position yesterday, Friday.

Nice write up but I just don't think people who own this stock will care if it's 13 or 15x sales or 125x or 135x EBITDA
depending on the share count. Good luck with the short


11 Jan 2014, 10:42 PM

And today the stock looks like it is peaking.... 
When the people see that, they will sell, no matter what.


13 Jan 2014, 03:00 PM


PSalerno, Contributor
And they are selling indeed, giving me more than 15% gain in 2 days. 
Timing is everything in the shorting game. I am wondering if there is some news pending like a stock offering. WDAY
for instance announced a stock offering.

What are the exercise price for majority of those shares?

Good analysis, but it does not necessarily lead to the conclusion of "shorting", unless you can show your approach is
repeatable on a consistent basis.
