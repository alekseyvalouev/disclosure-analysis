Bank	Of	Ireland	Arbitrage:	ADRs	At	More	Than	Double	Value	Of
London-Listed	Shares
Sep.	12,	2011	3:44	PM	ET63	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


Bank	of	Ireland’s	NYSE-listed	ADRs	(NYSE:IRE)	are	trading	at	a	significant	premium	to
the	bank’s	London/Ireland	listed	shares	(symbol	BKIR).	


There	does	not	seem	to	be	any	legitimate	reason	why	IRE	is	trading	at	a	much	higher
price	than	BKIR.	We	first	wrote	about	this	phenomenon	on	28	July.	


Since	then,	the	IRE	overvaluation	(versus	BKIR)	has	increased	to	a	record	level.


This	article	will	show	that	in	order	for	IRE	shares	to	move	to	parity	with	BKIR,	the	stock
should	fall	by	about	$0.71	(or	63%)	from	$1.12	to	$0.41.	In	other	words,	investors	are
paying	$0.71	more	for	IRE	than	they	would	pay	for	the	equivalent	stock	in	London.	


In	our	28	July	article	we	gave	a	price	target	of	$0.78	for	IRE	shares.	Based	on	calculations
outlined	below,	we	now	reduce	our	price	target	to	$0.68,	substantially	below	the	9
September	closing	price	of	$1.14.	


Share	price	parity	calculation	–	background	information:


BKIR	shares	are	denominated	in	euros,	and	not	British	pounds.
IRE	ADRs	are	denominated	in	US	dollars.


The	ratio	of	ADRs	to	London	listed	shares	is	1:4.


Share	price	parity	calculation	as	at	11.30am	New	York	time	on	Friday	9	September	2011:

BKIR	(ask)	in	EUR 0.074


EUR/USD	exchange	rate 1.3670


IRE	(bid)	in	USD 1.12


To	convert	BKIR	to	a	theoretical	IRE	equivalent:


0.074	EUR	*	4	(number	of	London	shares	for	each	ADR)	=	0.296	EUR
0.296	EUR	*	1.3670	=	0.4046	USD


Therefore	the	theoretical	IRE	share	price	is	about	$0.41.	But	at	that	time,	the	prevailing
IRE	bid	in	New	York	was	$1.12.


Price	difference	between	the	two	securities:


$1.12	–	$0.41	=	$0.71	
0.71	/	1.12	=	63.39%	decline	required	for	IRE	to	reach	parity	with	London	listed	shares	of
BKIR.


0.71	/	0.41	=	1.7317
IRE	is	overvalued	by	173.17%	when	compared	to	BKIR.


How	long	has	this	overvaluation	been	in	place,	and	why?


The	BNY	Mellon	web	page	for	IRE	ADRs	states	that	“Bank	of	Ireland	Group	–	Books
Closed	for	Issuance”	on	3	December	2010.	This	means	that	it	was	no	longer	possible	to
submit	BKIR	shares	and	request	IRE	ADRs	in	exchange	from	that	date.	


According	to	our	calculations,	the	difference	between	the	prices	of	BKIR	and	IRE	was	less
than	1%	on	3	December.	Following	this,	when	conversions	(from	BKIR	to	IRE)	were	no
longer	possible,	the	premium	widened	quickly,	and	reached	50%	on	20	December	2010.
The	following	table	shows	the	wild	and	unexplained	fluctuations	in	the	IRE	share	price
when	compared	to	the	BKIR	equivalent.

Fundamentals	of	BKIR	and	downside	price	target	–	no	higher	than	$0.68


Bank	of	Ireland	recently	underwent	a	recapitalization	by	raising	billions	of	EUR	of
additional	capital.	It	sold	additional	common	stock	at	0.10	EUR	per	share,	and	completed
a	debt	for	equity	exchange,	with	the	conversion	of	debt	priced	at	0.1156	EUR	per	share.


It’s	unlikely	that	the	BKIR	price	(which	should	influence	the	underlying	value	of	IRE)	will
rise	beyond	0.1156	EUR,	due	to	the	"anchoring"	of	the	share	price	to	the	rights	issue	price
and	the	debt	for	equity	exchange	price.


Furthermore,	due	to	the	ongoing	problems	in	Greece,	Ireland,	Portugal,	Spain	and	Italy,
it’s	hard	to	see	the	EUR/USD	going	above	1.47,	the	high	from	early	June.
7/19/2019 Bank Of Ireland Arbitrage: ADRs At More Than Double Value Of London-Listed Shares - The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland (NYSE:I…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/293163-bank-of-ireland-arbitrage-adrs-at-more-than-double-value-of-london-listed-shares 4/5


Using	a	maximum	price	of	0.1156	EUR	for	BKIR	and	maximum	price	of	1.47	for
EUR/USD,	the	maximum	fair	value	for	IRE	can	be	calculated	as:


0.1156	EUR	*	4	*	1.4700	=	$0.68.


However	it	should	fall	lower	than	$0.68	if	the	EUR/USD	stays	below	1.4700	and/or	BKIR
stays	below	0.1156	EUR.


What	are	buyers	of	IRE	thinking?


It’s	fair	to	assume	that	if	it	was	possible	to	convert	BKIR	shares	to	IRE,	then	this	premium
would	quickly	disappear,	as	investors	wanting	to	buy	IRE	cheaply	could	just	buy	BKIR	and
then	ask	BNY	Mellon	to	convert	these	to	IRE	ADRs.


In	any	case,	one	wonders	what	the	buyers	of	IRE	at	$0.85	and	above	have	been	thinking
in	the	last	eight	months	–	they	could	have	purchased	the	shares	at	a	much	lower	price	in
London.


Catalyst	for	the	spread	between	IRE	and	BKIR	to	close


We	find	it	remarkable	that	this	arbitrage	opportunity	has	existed	for	so	long,	especially
after	the	publication	of	our	28	July	article	discussing	this	phenomenon.	We	can	only
assume	that	IRE	investors	do	not	understand	that	the	stock	is	an	ADR	representing	four
BKIR	shares	and	not	a	separate	security	of	the	Irish	bank.	


However	we	are	encouraged	by	the	decline	in	IRE	below	the	$1.20	level	in	September,	a
support	level	that	held	for	the	second	half	of	August.	Furthermore	the	$1.20	level
represents	the	50-day	moving	average	for	IRE.	Now	that	IRE	has	broken	these	two
technical	levels,	it	is	reasonable	to	assume	that	IRE	will	continue	its	decline	towards	its
52-week	low	of	$0.85,	and	then	toward	parity	with	BKIR	shares.


Some	readers	may	believe	that	this	arbitrage	opportunity	is	“too	good	to	be	true."	We
encourage	all	readers	to	independently	work	through	the	above	calculations,	and	to	view
the	Bank	of	Ireland	page	and	the	BNY	Mellon	page	to	confirm	the	ratio	of	ADRs	per
London/Ireland	listed	shares.
