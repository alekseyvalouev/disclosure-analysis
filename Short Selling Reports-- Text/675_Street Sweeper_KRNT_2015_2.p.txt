Kornit Digital: Recent Event Accelerates Risks

Summary


The recent acquisition of a top competitor poses several negative implications for
Kornit Digital, just as it attempts a critical expansion into a new market for Kornit,
called roll-to-roll.


Electronics for Imaging's acquisition of Reggiani pressures Kornit and other inkjet
printer companies due to the additional cash, R&D and expanded distribution
channels available to the new EFI Reggiani.


EFI has shown it wants to pay only 1.8X revenue and 7-12X EBITDA. At that rate,
Kornit might be acquisition-worthy at $1.88 to $4.26 per share, well below today's
~$14.


TheStreetSweeper alerts investors to the latest negative event subsequent to our recent
report on the massive risks facing Kornit Digital (NASDAQ:KRNT) - an event that suggests
the stock should be trading below $5 per share.


A top competitor, Italy-based Reggiani has been acquired by Electronics for Imaging for
about $84.2 million, plus ~$56.2 million over 30 months of milestone achievements.


The deal presents a couple of negative implications for Israeli inkjet printing company,
Kornit. These are particularly worrisome just as the company tries to make the critical
expansion from the T-shirt makers' market into the roll-to-roll market. Roll-to-roll printers
allow images to be printed on fabrics that are then sewn into garments, wallpaper,
furniture coverings, etc.


First, Reggiani, already a top rival whose sales jumped 61 percent between 2012 and
2013 to ~$76 million, will likely become a roll-to-roll gorilla.


The acquisition by Electronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) means the rebranded EFI
Reggiani will be able to use the money and advanced distribution channels afforded by
EFII. So it can be expected to negatively impact Kornit's future potential - as Kornit tries to
get its commercial roll-to-roll printer launched over about 18 months.


Second, this deal should have a downward effect on Kornit's valuation today.

The deal means EFII is unwilling to pay anything close to Kornit's current ~6 times
revenue and ~50 times EBITDA.


Indeed, EFII has shown that it's willing to pony up only 1.8 times revenue and 7-12 times
EBITDA. That means, it would pay no more than about $56 million to $127 million for
Kornit, which equals $1.88 to $4.26 per share.


EFII wouldn't be a buyer at the current level and, in our view, neither should any other
logical investor.

KRNT rallying on this EFII acquisition.


It is not clear to me that you understand that Kornit's market is specifically textile printing and not inkjet generally
which is where EFII gets most of its revenues. I have seen KRNT's facilities in Israel. Their technology is spectacular.
I don't disagree that the stock is expensive on current fundamentals, but the technology has the potential to rapidly
penetrate an industry that hasn't had a major technological advance in decades while delivering a solid business
model.


This stock is not for the faint of heart, certainly, but I am long.
