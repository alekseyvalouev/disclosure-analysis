Editors' Pick Short Ideas


DM


While we don't normally present short-term tactical shorts, given the recent over heated
IPO market, we have started to do more work on some of these pricey initial public
offerings. One name that comes to mind is ExOne (XONE), which has risen since its
IPO (initial range of $14-16), by roughly 367%.

dimensional printing machines and printing products in the Americas, Europe, and

parts; and ExMicro Orion machine, a laser micromachining product for conventional

automotive, heavy equipment, energy/oil/gas, and other industries under the ExOne
brand name. The ExOne Company was founded in 2005 and is headquartered in
North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.


This reminds us of other names like SolarCity (OTC:SCTY) which went up roughly five-
fold from its IPO lows. We wrote a recent article on SolarCity, discussing some of the
flaws in the business model and analyzing some of the enormous multiples investors
were paying. We ended up making the most amount of money by just shorting the stock
right before insider lock-up and covering the day of. This is one of those rare cases, if
you can get the shares available to short, the odds are heavily on your side right before
and during lock-up expiration. We will show that on average the supply and demand
dynamics of an insider lock-up almost always favor the short.

While many short ideas are based on high multiples and/or flawed business models,
that does not necessarily mean the price will go down immediately; just look at Amazon
(AMZN) and LinkedIn (LNKD). We've read countless articles (agreeing with most) on
how overvalued they are, but they still have not come down from sky high multiples.
Being short can expose you to irrational price movements based on hype or just market
gyrations that in fact become very real. The reason these movements become real is
that many short positions can be "forced covered," especially if the position is not highly
liquid. Therefore, the short may have to cover at the exact moment that would be least
beneficial, usually after a large upswing. So essentially what we are looking for is a
significantly overvalued stock with a catalyst to initiate a short position. When discussing
recent IPOs, this usually comes in the form of the 180 day insider lock-up which can be
found in the S-1 filing.


With initial public offerings we're looking for a few key factors:


A large run-up since the initial pricing of the IPO


A high percentage of the total float coming out of lock-up


Enormous multiples analogous to bubble stocks


A lot of hype surrounding a business which may not be deserved


Just so people don't think we are negative on all 3D printed stocks, we actually like the
overall industry and think a few players will prosper. Among all the players, we believe
there are only two that are likely to succeed long-term, and those are Stratasys (SSYS)
and 3D Systems (DDD), the largest of the 3D printing companies. In large technology
shifts, there always tends to be pockets of speculation - the larger players usually
dominate through scale, brand recognition and access to capital. We think there are
pockets of speculation in some of the smaller 3D companies with excessive multiples
and promotional management teams. ExOne seems to fit the bill, however, we are still
only thinking about a short trade just prior to lock-up to lower risk.


So while our primary focus is not on the actual fundamentals of ExOne, we should point
out how overvalued the shares currently are vs. Stratasys and 3D Systems. This may be
useful to readers looking to hold a longer term short position, and it does not hurt to
have additional factors for a short case.

XONE DDD SYSS


Market Cap: 869.77M 4.17B 3.2B


Employees: 131 1,010 1,100


Qtrly Rev Growth (yoy): 1.92 0.31 1.162

PEG (5 yr expected): N/A 2.07 N/A


P/S : 25.09 11.04 12.3


As you can see from the above, ExOne trades at roughly twice the price to sales ratios
of the largest players in the industry with about one tenth the sales. While they are
growing revenues quicker year over year, they are still unprofitable and have negative
EBITDA, compared to +93.41M for 3D Systems and +52.98M for Stratasys . ExOne also
is on the low end of margins at roughly 42%, versus the leader 3D Systems at 52%.
While growth appears to be faster than the competitors, we have seen this come down
in the most recent quarter, with poor results on the Q1 2013 report. In our view one of
the better relative indicators for an unprofitable company is price to sales, price to
EBITDA (or EV/EBITDA), and price to book. Given those metrics, we view a 50-60%
haircut on ExOne as trading at par with the leaders in the space. Note that we said the
leaders in the space, which means there would likely be a further discount on ExOne
given it is a smaller niche player focused on alternative materials.

Details from the S-1 Filing and 10-K


Lock-Up Agreements


Our executive officers and directors, the selling stockholder and certain of our
significant stockholders have agreed to a 180-day "lock-up" from the date of this
prospectus relating to shares of our common stock that they beneficially own,
including the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of currently outstanding
options and options which may be issued. This means that, for a period of 180 days
following the date of this prospectus, such persons may not offer, sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of these securities without the prior written consent of the
representatives, subject to certain exceptions. The lock-up period described in the
preceding sentence will be extended if (1) during the last 17 days of the lock-up
period, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to
us occurs, or (2) prior to the expiration of the initial lock-up period, we announce that
we will release earnings results during the 15-day period following the last day of the
initial lock-up period, in which case the lock-up period automatically will be extended
until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of release of the
earnings results or the public announcement regarding the material news or the
occurrence of the material event, as applicable, unless the representatives waive, in
writing, such extension.


*S-1 Filing pg. 101


Future sales of our shares could reduce the market price of our shares.

The price of our shares could decline if there are substantial sales of our common
stock, particularly by our directors, their affiliates or our executive officers, or when
there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale. The
perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell our shares could also
depress the market price of our shares. Substantially all of our existing stockholders
prior to this offering are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters that
restrict their ability to transfer their shares for at least 180 days after the date of this
prospectus. Consequently, upon expiration of the lock-up agreements, an additional
of our shares will be eligible for sale in the public market. The market price of our
shares may drop significantly when the restrictions on resale by our existing
stockholders lapse and these stockholders are able to sell their shares into the
market. If this occurs or continues it could impair our ability to raise additional capital
through the sale of securities should we desire to do so. See "Shares Eligible for
Future Sale.


*S-1 Filing pg. 101


Consequently, upon expiration of the lock-up agreements, approximately 7,072,105
shares held by our existing stockholders or directors will be eligible for sale in the
public market.


*From the 10-K


The above is the missing piece from the S-1 filing that shows the exact number of
shares that will be coming onto the market. Given the large amount of shares potentially
coming onto the market in relation to the average volume per day, if only a fraction of
those shares are sold, it will result in a large percentage decline in price. With an
average volume of only around 500k, the amount of shares potentially coming on the
market is roughly 14 times the daily average volume.

Let us preface this by saying that on average there appears to be an alpha generating
opportunity, however, there will be specific cases where this type of strategy does not
work. The instances where we have seen the opposite occur are usually issues that
have large short (> 50%) interests and a small amount of shares (in relation to the
outstanding float) coming due on lock-up expiration. While this is a relatively simple
case, this is not our overall investment strategy by any means; it is simply a way to add
a little extra return to your portfolio if you see the opportunity. A note of caution to
readers, usually it is quite difficult to get shares right before lock-up, but if you can it is
likely be a profitable endeavor.
