China Agritech: How should I reply to Kevin Theiss re China
Agritech?
Forgive me a brief gloat about a successful short. 
 
China Agritech has fired its auditor after the auditor threatened to resign.  NASDAQ has suspended
the stock and there is no indication of when it will trade again. 
 
The Carlyle representative on the board (Anne Wang) has resigned and never answered any email I
sent her or any questions on this blog. 
 
The auditor firing 8K is a gem.  Ernst & Young has recommended the "initiation of an independent
investigation, in order to verify certain transactions and balances recorded on the Company’s financial
statements and records for the year ended December 31, 2010." 
 
E&Y also "orally advised the Audit Committee that it may not be able to rely on management’s
representations based on the issues identified." 
 
In other words they thought management may be lying and they thought an "independent
investigation" (meaning independent of the board) was warranted.  
 
None of this should be a surprise to any reader of this blog.  
 
I also annoyed China Agritech's management especially because of my repeated (and unsuccessful)
attempts to talk to Carlyle.  
 
This is a letter I got from their PR flack on 24 February.  How should I respond?  Note that the flack
(Kevin Theiss) says we (meaning Grayling - not China Agritech) have collected evidence that my
allegations were groundless.  
 
 


Dear Mr. Hempton, 
 
We are aware that you have published a series of blog articles to negatively comment
on China Agritech's business operations and attack the Company's credibility. It is
becoming more alarming that you have repeatedly reached out to our largest outside
shareholder. Your intention and ongoing efforts to derail our well-established, long-term
relationship with our largest shareholder has come to our full attention. If you have any
questions, concerns or comments, we welcome you to contact China Agritech’s
management directly. We will provide you with our timely answers. Lastly, we have
collected evidence that your allegations are groundless. If you continue to harass our
shareholder, we will take further legal action against you. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Kevin Theiss

John 
 
PS.  Huntsworth PLC - the company that ultimately threatened to sue me on behalf of China Agritech
- is publicly listed.  Their CEO states on their website that Huntsworth "have developed a culture of
rigorous focus on margin improvement throughout the Group". Is there any business not worth doing
for a high margin?  Does this letter represent the quality of their work?

I suggest you refer them to Arkell v. Pressdram.

No matter what you reply, make sure you copy in: james.achesongray@grayling.com 
 
What was their initial legal action? (If they were threatening "further" legal action that
implies some action beforehand...)

John, obviously the best thing is to take him up on his offer and write 10 yes/no questions
to management ("Do you actually manufacture the volume of product you claim to in your
SEC filings, or is that figure a pure fabrication?") 
 
Thanks for your articles about this stinker, your writing was a fantastic jumping-off point
for me to do my own follow-up research into CAGC and start my own short position.

What possible relationship the China Agritech would Grayling have? Are these all mob-
owned entities?

I intend to remain long on CAGC. I think this short term ups and down will make this
company to bring more transparency. Ag demans are not goinf down with these fingure
pointing. CAGC is signing on to more business and may be ready for next leap to high
teens...

Congrats on a great call. It takes a lot more courage than I have to call out a company
(for the short side). 
 
The mistake that a lot of people seem to make is that they don't do any of their own due
diligence. Following a wealthy investor is not due diligence. You can ask all of Madoff's
victims about that.

This is a stupid question from someone who doesn't know a lot about trading. 
 
If you are short on the stock, and it is suspended, what happens then? 
 
What if the stock never trades again? How do you profit out of your short position in that
case?

If someone have to hold this stock for 5 years then now seems to be right time to jump in
when short gurus are going to pull its price down. This stock is not going to remain
depressed for long after it starts trading again. These questionable stocks have impact on
CAAS where small non-financial mistakes is causing stock price to pull down. High risk
High profit is still true. $41 million revenue in Q4 2010 seems like good numbers if turns
out to be true and verifiable.

I think it'd be fair to say the following to Kevin Theiss: 
 
"I haven't received notice of any legal action against me, although you implied it's already
started. Could you kindly inform me what action has taken place, and on what grounds?
For the record, asking reasonable questions of the largest shareholder via email is not
harassment. I have no desire to disturb or upset anyone; I merely want to make money
for my investors. If Carlyle does not wish to speak with me, I'll fully respect that decision.
But if you and/or Carlyle have evidence that all my allegations are wrong, then I'd love to
see it. You can contact me directly at brontecapital@gmail.com. Thank you very much. 
 
Respectfully Yours,  
 
John"

i worked for a major Pr company, in fact what is usually considered to be the best--5
continents on 95 continents, and there was a rule that if a typo went out, that person,
regardless of their title, would be fired. theiss here, splits an infinitive in the first couple of
sentences. there is one sense he outsmarted you. the goal of the email he sent to you
was to get you to post in on your blog, and in that sense you fell for it and he won. but
sense its such an unprofessional rant, his victory was miminal for sure.
