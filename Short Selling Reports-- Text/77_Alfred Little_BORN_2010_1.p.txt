China New Borun: Born to Run or Destined to Fall?
Oct. 21, 2010 6:54 AM ET92 comments
by: Alfred Little


China New Borun Corporation (NYSE: BORN) priced its IPO on June 11, 2010 at $7 per
share. The stock subsequently fell as low as $4.93 and then more than quadrupled in
price to as high as $20.50 last week, making it arguably the top performing IPO of 2010 so
far, outperforming JinkoSolar (NYSE: JKS), SouFun Holdings (NASDAQ: SFUN), Hisoft
Technology (NASDAQ: HSFT), Charm Communications (NASDAQ: CHRM), and China
Lodging Group (NASDAQ: HTHT) among others.


BORN’s Chairman and CEO Mr. Jinmiao Wang first got into the edible alcohol business in
2004. BORN’s first production line was completed in 2006 and its Daqing newest
production line was completed in 2009. Both new production lines were designed by
Guangdong Zhongke New Energy Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (广东中科天元新能源
科技有限公司). In fact, BORN CEO Wang does not have very strong knowledge or
experience in the edible alcohol industry. Wang’s previous business experience was in the
sea salt mining industry.


So despite its fabulous debut, as I will show below, there are serious problems with
BORN.


Industry experts I consulted in China believe BORN’s historical and current gross profit
margins are exaggerated by more than 3X. Earnings per share are exaggerated by 4-5X.
Three key facts support this view:


1. Outdated Technology - Contrary to BORN’s claims in its SEC filings, its wet process
production technology is outdated, inefficient and environmentally unfriendly due to its
over-reliance on toxic chemical solutions and resulting large volumes of waste water
production.


Today, all efficient plants use an industry standard semi-dry technology that is much more
energy efficient, requires lower capital investment and dramatically reduces pollution. I
could find no major producers, other than BORN, using wet process production
technology.


To resolve its inefficiency, BORN’s CEO and CTO Mr. Wei Qi (who used to work for
Shandong Jiujiu edible alcohol, a company that went bankrupt a couple of years ago due
to poor performance) decided to upgrade the technology in both plants to the semi-dry

method. BORN’s Daqing plant began being upgraded in July, 2010. BORN’s Shandong
plant is just starting upgrades. According to industry sources, BORN contracted all the
upgrades to Henan Sheng Wantongtong Machine Manufacture Corp., Ltd. ( 河南省万通通
机械制造有限公司)


2. Understated Raw Material Pricing - In its F1 registration filing BORN stated its cost of
corn in the Q1 2010 represented 83.5% of the COGS, which equals RMB 4,150 per ton of
alcohol produced. BORN stated it produced 1 ton of edible alcohol from 2.98 tons of corn,
a ratio in line with the industry norm.


Dividing 4,150 by 2.98 shows BORN paid RMB 1,393 per ton of corn purchased in Q1.
Using the same calculation BORN’s average corn cost for the second quarter was RMB
1,406. BORN stated it bought all its corn for both plants in Heilongjiang province.


Table 1 (below) shows the historical market price of corn in Heilongjiang in Q1 was RMB
1,398. This is consistent with the average price BORN reported paying.


Table 1 - Heilongjiang corn price trend


Table 2 (below) shows the historical market price of corn for reference in Shandong, which
is substantially higher, and explains BORN's decision to purchase corn in Heilongjiang and
ship it to Shandong.


Table 2 - Shandong corn price trend

https://seekingalpha.com/article/231301-china-new-borun-born-to-run-or-destined-to-fall 3/26


However, BORN incurs substantial cost packaging and shipping corn from Heilongjiang to
its plant in Shandong. Based on price quotes I obtained from three railway shipping
companies, the average price from Daqing to Shouguang, including packaging, loading,
unloading and rail transport charge is RMB 200-240 per ton. BORN’s Shandong plant’s
capacity of 160,000 is approximately 61% of BORN 260,000 total capacity and therefore
consumes approximately 61% of BORN’s total corn supply.


Taking 61% of the conservative estimate of RMB 200 per ton shipping cost results in an
additional RMB 122 per ton to BORN’s reported Q1 and Q2 corn cost. Therefore I
estimate BORN’s true per ton cost of corn was at least RMB 1,515 in Q1 and RMB
1,528 in Q2, resulting in an increase of cost of goods of RMB 122 X 2.98 X 60,700
tons of alcohol sold = RMB 22,068,092 for Q1 and RMB 122 X 2.98 X 65,410 tons of
alcohol sold = RMB 23,780,460 for Q2.


3. Overstated Corn Germ by-product sales - Neither of BORN’s plants are extracting
and selling significant quantities of corn germ by-product according to the expert
consultant I hired from a competitor in Jilin who visited both plants. The expert found that
the corn germ extraction facilities were not operational nor had they been used in quite
some time due to high energy costs and pollution problems.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/231301-china-new-borun-born-to-run-or-destined-to-fall 4/26


Additionally, analysis of the fat content of the DDGS by-product BORN sells shows it
contains 8-10% fat indicating the high fat corn germ was not extracted, whereas DDGS
after corn germ is extracted contains only 3-4% fat.


Accordingly, BORN’s 8-10% fat DDGS selling prices in Q1 of RMB 1,789 and Q2 of RMB
1,767 disclosed in its SEC filings are consistent with local published selling prices in its
primary markets (see Table 3 below).


Table 3 - DDGS price trend


However, as a result of BORN not extracting any significant amounts of corn germ from its
DDGS, its claim of Q1 sales of RMB 42.78 million and Q2 RMB 51.38 million corn germ
are impossible.


Based on 1-3 above, I will now calculate adjusted Gross Margin and Net Income for
BORN:


For Q1 and Q2, I deducted RMB 42,783,160 and RMB 51,381,930, respectively, of
fabricated corn germ sales from BORN’s reported total sales of RMB 388,768,417 and
RMB 432,469,590 to get adjusted sales of RMB 345,985,257 and RMB 381,087,660.


For Q1 and Q2, I add RMB 22,068,092 and RMB 23,780,460, respectively, of omitted
shipping costs to BORN’s reported total COGS of RMB 301,674,443 and RMB
330,324,880 to get adjusted COGS of RMB 323,742,535 and RMB 354,105,340.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/231301-china-new-borun-born-to-run-or-destined-to-fall 5/26


Deducting adjusted COGS from adjusted sales results in adjusted Q1 and Q2 gross profits
of RMB 22,242,722 and RMB 26,982,320, respectively. For Q1 and Q2 the adjusted
gross profit margins are therefore 6.43% and 7.08% versus 22.4% and 23.6% BORN
reported in its SEC filings.


Based on these adjustments, BORN’s pre-tax income for Q1 and Q2 should be RMB
13,939,058 and RMB 13,675,440, respectively. BORN is fully taxed at 25% resulting in
adjusted Q1 and Q2 net income of RMB 10,454,294 and RMB 10,256,580.


Setting aside the earnings distributed to preferred shareholders and dividing by the
weighted average 14,847,811 and 17,238,402 ADS shares outstanding in Q1 and Q2,
respectively, results in earnings per share of RMB 0.70 and RMB 0.60. Converting
earnings per share from RMB to USD at the average exchange rate during each period
results in $0.10 and $0.09 EPS in Q1 and Q2, respectively, compared to $0.43 and
$0.46 BORN reported in its SEC filings.


Going forward, BORN faces two additional challenges:


1. Lack of high quality customer base - BORN is in a rapid expansion stage. Yet all of
BORN’s current customers are small and medium sized “baijiu” producers in
Heilongjiang and Shandong province. Surprisingly, even though BORN claimed to be
the second largest edible alcohol producer in China it has yet to sell products to any
top tier “baijiu” producers. BORN nevertheless claims it will utilize its added capacity to
target major “baijiu” producers, but it is hard to imagine it can enter this market easily
since it has not succeeded to date generating sales to large producers such as Moutai
(SHE: 600519, Luzhou Laojiao (SHE: 000568) and Wuliangye (SHE: 000858). Future
capacity utilization could therefore be constrained.


2. Questionable legal restructuring - BORN’s legal restructuring was very aggressive.
The company took a series of complicated steps to complete its offshore
reorganization. The “circular 10” or so called “M&A” rules issued by the Chinese
government on September 8, 2006 require PRC citizens who intend to set up offshore
entities and use them to acquire domestic entities to get approval from MOFCOM
(Ministry of Commerce). If PRC citizens intend to apply for foreign listing of newly
setup offshore entities they need to get CSRC (China Securities Regulatory
Commission) approvals. BORN’s Chairman and CEO somehow obtained a foreign
citizenship for his mother and used his mother’s identity to set up the offshore entity.
BORN’s PRC counsel, B&D Law, claims “M&A” rules don’t apply to this type of
arrangement. However, all reputable Chinese counsels I have consulted would never
approve this type of legal restructuring. It is very risky since the CEO’s mother is his

direct relative. CSRC and MOFCOM could someday deem this restructuring a brazen
violation of “M&A” rules.


Conclusion: Obviously I have serious concerns about BORN’s past and present
financials. In the best case scenario, once BORN completes costly upgrades of its
production method its gross margins could rise up from today’s miserable 7% toward the
11%-16% industry average gross margin, but of course nowhere near the fanciful 22-23%
gross margins they have reported to investors.


I think BORN is yet another lesson to U.S. investors who rely solely upon a company’s
SEC filings and press releases for making investment decisions. Investors need access to
industry experts in China to properly evaluate a company like BORN.

Alfred,


I don't know much about BORN, and I haven't fully understood the details behind all the point of you made in the
article, but the analysis in the article strikes me as top quality research from someone with deep knowledge about the
industry. If the gross margins in the business were truely overstated by 300% like you calculated, this is a shockingly
large difference to say the least. Great work. The wall street analysts definitely need to learn to do better research like
this one before they go marketing the stocks. This stock definitely looks like an overhyped one due for a correction.

Just because you research and publish something doesn't make it true. Your conclusions are not supported by the
facts regarding the Borun Wet Process (wet milling process) including the following:


• In addition to ethanol, germ, carbon dioxide, corn gluten meal, and corn gluten feed are produced in the wet milling
process. The germ, which is separated from the other kernel constituents after the coarse grind, contains most of the
oil contained in the grain. It can be processed to extract the oil, which can then be further refined into food-grade corn
oil. Carbon dioxide produced during fermentation can be captured and used to carbonate beverages or to produce dry
ice. Corn gluten meal and corn gluten feed are used as animal feed (Loe, 2006). Approximately 2.5 gallons of ethanol,
16.4 pounds of carbon dioxide, 2.1 pounds of oil, 2.6 pounds (dry mass) of corn gluten meal, and 11.2 pounds (dry
mass) of corn gluten feed are produced per bushel of corn using the wet milling process. 
• Wet Ethanol Production Process Yields More Ethanol And More Co-Products 
ScienceDaily (Dec. 28, 2009) — Using a wet ethanol production method that begins by soaking corn kernels rather
than grinding them, results in more gallons of ethanol and more usable co-products, giving ethanol producers a bigger
bang for their buck -- by about 20 percent. 
• In comparing the wet and dry fractionation methods, Khullar's research team found that when using the wet
fractionation method, the result is even higher ethanol concentrations coming out of the fermenter and better quality
co-products than the dry method.


In the wet process, the corn kernels are soaked, washing the germ, which Khullar says is a cleaner separation.
"There's not a lot of starch sticking to the germ. That's why you get higher oil concentrations." 
• Corn Wet Mill Process facilities tend to be larger, and are generally co-located to a Corn Wet Milling facility. Steep
tanks may be added to a Dry Mill process in order to transform that facility into a Wet Mill Process and gain
efficiencies and improve profitability.

Question: Where did you get the gross margin? Yahoo Finance says the gross margin for BORN is 23.39%, and the
operating margin is 21.26%. The industry gross margin is 45.75%, and the industry operating margin is 18.81%.
finance.yahoo.com/q/co... Even BUD has a gross margin of 54.49%, and an operating margin of 27.62%, far greater
than the 16% gross margin for the industry you claim. finance.yahoo.com/q/co...


21 Oct 2010, 08:39 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
Young man, you need to do better research before comparing BORN to the likes of BUD, because they're
totally different businesses in different countries with little or no comparability. The article was obviously
written by someone with deep understanding about that industry in China; someone who has done a large
amount of research on top of the disclosures in SEC filings or data from website sites such as Yahoo finance.
The tone of your second comment below about to the author himself was off putting and, frankly, quite
immature.


I have to say the quality of this research is even beyond most research I personally have seen from the wall
street analysts.

The way to analyze the work is to look at the facts, evidence and reasoning therefrom. Don't base your

On point #1, I find it extremely difficult to believe that all of Wall St. would have missed that and the likes of this fund

On point #2, your statement of "Based on price quotes I obtained from three railway shipping companies: --- is this a
current quote, or backdated quotes so that you had the shipping charges as of the time BORN would have incurred
them?


On point #3, you said that a competitor had these allegations, but did not provide a timetable for this investigation. It is
very difficult to believe that the company would simply make up a product line in the SEC filing that mentioned,
"Revenue from DDGS Feed increased by 108.2% to RMB80.1 million".


Is it possible that some of your findings are based on limited data points and therefore lead to faulty conclusions?

It appears that you are living in a fantasy world. Not sure why you would have any confidence that the SEC
would catch all of the companies inflating earnings or having earnings not quite right. It is pretty clear that the
SEC requests information from a very small fraction of companies that misreport and bring actions on an
even smaller fraction.

there are no US-listed Chinese companies with phony sales.

Maybe Al has a grudge against IBD, who picked it as number one on the IBD 100. Does he think IBD pulled BORN
out of a hat to replace NFLX?? Both I and my son (on my recomendation) bought it. If Al is right I can see the

Hope sammy07 is right.

1st of all, this article starts off saying that Born outperformed JKS. It only outperforms JKS when Born's lowest
recorded price is used against JKS's offer price.  
Per Investors Business Daily: It's the 3rd largest distributor of corn-based edible alcohol, they never claimed to be the
2nd largest like this article says. Also, IBD says that Borun's shifting away from grade C edible alcohol to higher-
margin, higher-quality, grade B product. This article claims that Borun was trying to hide this fact, by only upgrading a
minor segment...but it wasn't.  
Oppenheimer and Co. Funds analyst Katherine Lu says although corn has increased in price by 20%, prices of edible
alcohol have risen 40%; and Piper Jaffray analyst Anson Chan said the corn costs have been stable due to long-term
procurement agreements. This article doesn't acknowledge the long term agreements, uses the market price which
biases the estimates, and doesn't account for the 40% increase in price. Also, almost the entire foundation for this
articles accusations are based on this biased "cost" that he "calculates." 
In the conference call, management said they have consistently sold 100% of production and have recieved extensive
preorders. Senior Analyst Jeff Papp said the government has granted Borun one of the last licenses to increase

production of edible alcohol. This article claims that there won't be enough demand for the increased capacity.  
On a personal and non-cited note...I read some of Little's other articles and this is his style: beat down high flying
stocks because they've had good/great runs, and that there must be something wrong or illegal because a run that
good is impossible. He blamed his assistant for a mistake in this segment: doubt this loser even has an assistant.

"Based on price quotes I obtained from three railway shipping companies, the average price from Daqing to
Shouguang, including packaging, loading, unloading and rail transport charge is RMB 200-240 per ton"


Despite whether you are telling truth or just making stories, how can you obtain their "quote" for Borun? What role do
you play when obtaining the quote? Show public the evidence. Or if you have ever seen the contracts between Borun
and shipping companies? Post it on.


Deal is deal, if you have one ton corn, that may be the cost. But is you have 500,000 tons corns a year, the cost may
be RMB 120 per ton.


You even know more than a Borun insider, or even more than Borun CEO, and obviousely you know much more than
SEC. Are you just doing this by yourself or you hire a team working for you on this Borun investigation?


There are lots of Chiese Borun investors, how come you know all the things that they even could not discover? Won't
they do on site investigation before investing?


You cannot fool people in this way.


Making up a story like this, putting so much effort on writing this article, what's your objective? Of course you short
Borun and scam the public.


Someone is asking for convincing opposing evidence? I would say that I would rather not to waste time on winning
this meaningless debate. I believe in SEC, Yahoo Finance, public trend, chinese investor, chinese government much
much more than this guy.

A lot of investors only talk about irregularities in the filings of Chinese RTO's. With all kind of arguments they
try to make their case. If you can't handle the fact that in a lot of cases there are differences between SEC vs.
SAIC filings, don't invest in China.


There are several reasons why they are different.


A lot of RTO's file on a company basis for PRC versus a consolidated basis for the SEC . Because the PRC
documents are audited under PRC GAAP, there will be some (small) differences. The SEC is primarily
revenue recognition, because US GAAP uses revenue recognition, while PRC GAAP is based off of invoice,
where in China income is based off of the collection or the receipt. The difference can be anywhere between
5-10%.

today.

This guy really knows what people care. Although his story is too detailed, too insightful to be a true one, he made
money through this. Or maybe a crowd of people seeing this article plus Mr Little short BORN stocks and they just sell
at low price to drag BORN down. Then a lot people who bought BORN under $10 will follow to sell, because it is not a
bad deal to sell at this time for these people. Then everybody long BORN start to worry and may follow this trend.
Then if BORN goes downward a little further in the next couple of days, Mr Little and his boss can buy at low and
return BORN. Then they win money from this.


Or maybe this is an even more organized action. Mr Little is appointed by some funds or investment organization and
gains commission by just writing this article to successfully move stock price. But anyway, this article is posted here
for some reason, and that just is, to drag BORN down to let somebody(the boss of Mr.Little) to make money. Mr.Little
obviously cannot do this whole thing on his own. Maybe Mr.Little is not a individual but a organization...that could be
true...


This is obviously a technical article, not because it does a thoroughly exam of Borun, but because it successfully
move the Price and create the money generating opportunity.


So, Mr, Little, this is kinda mean, but good job though!

Did some research. See, news.imeigu.com/a/1281....


"Borun wet" is different from "traditional wet", which is Borun's patten technology. They are the only alcohol producer
using "wet" is not because other producers are more advanced, but just the opposite. Their "wet" technology is not
only of high efficiency, environment friendly, but also produce high quality product!


Mr Little's article is very misleading. I just randomly pick one point and google it in Chinese and found evidence
everywhere which can disprove Mr.Little's points....

Alfred:


I would appreciate you serious consideration of the following questions. I, like you, am a CPA and began my career
with what was then a Big 8 firm, now one of the Final 4. Having been the point person for several IPO’s I find it hard to
believe issues like you have cited in your article would not have been picked up by the auditors, attorneys,
underwriters and SEC staff. For them to all miss what you say you found with BORN implies incompetence or worse
on their part:


(1.) BORN uses BDO as its auditor. Do you think the auditors visited BORN’s operations and verified at least the
physical presence and scope of business activities? Do you think BDO really missed the cost of sales issues you cite
when doing their analytics? Do you think the auditors looked at the SAIC and SAT reports and compared them to the
SEC filings? Do you think the auditors just pulled the trail balance and assembled workpaper binders with information
provided solely by the client to support the financial statements? You conclusion is that the financial statements are
false and misleading with material misstatements of revenues, cost of revenues and net income not to mention the
balance sheet and statements of cash flows. Do you think the auditors are culpable and/or incompetent which would
almost have to be the case if your analysis and conclusions are correct?


(2.) SEC Staff certainly would have drilled BORN management on their Borun wet process claims. Replies to SEC
staff comments would include the collaboration of corporate counsels for the company and the underwriters and BDO.
Do you think they all got it terribly wrong and/or were in collusion to mislead SEC staff and investors?


(3.) Generally speaking, with auditors, attorneys, underwriters and SEC staff involved in an IPO how can you explain
that you noticed the obvious and they all missed it?


All I can say is if you are correct in your assessment of BORN and the process and safeguards involved in bringing a
company public are that porous and/or corrupt it is disconcerting to say the least.


Thanks for your thoughtful reply.


21 Oct 2010, 10:13 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  First of all I do not have confidence that BORN's banker did any significant due diligence.
The motivation to earn a high fee is just too tempting. And ask yourself why was this IPO priced so low? Why
were Piper's original $7 and $9.70 price targets so low? Because they don't trust Borun either. I have
consulted industry experts and BORN's wet technology is clearly antiquated. BORN management realizes
this and if you take the time to talk to them they will admit to you that they are now upgrading to the leading
semidry method. I am working on a more detailed article focused on the technology this weekend. It will make
clear that BORN has lied about the state of their "technology".


I also have no confidence in the Chinese BDOs. BORN's auditor is BDO China Li Xin Da Hua CPA Co., Ltd.,
based in Shenzhen. This is NOT the real BDO.


And the SEC? I'm sorry if anyone still has confidence in regulators.


As always do your own research. Make sure you know more than the banksters, don't think the SEC or any
regulator is there to protect YOU, and don't ever trust management, you're boss, your children, or anyone

My concern with BORN is that at the IPO they had wanted to come out at 12-14 but ended up coming at 7. Even at
that level, Piper etc did not support the stock till it fell below 5. Why does Piper then love the stock at 20? On the other
hand, the original posting is extremely fishy because, the level of detail demands a reward. Nobody goes to such
lengths to research a company and then fails to take a short position - there has to be a vested interest which is not
declared.

Perhaps as an investment bank, Piper sensed the price is getting attractive to do a follow-on offering for
BORN? It really puzzles me why a rational company and its owners want to do an IPO at such a fire sale
price of $7 while they could probably get a much better valuation going public in Shanghai, Shenzhen or even
HK.

Just passing by: The evidence and facts presented by Little are all subjected to timing, locations, and specific
circumstance. Putting all else away, as I do not know its operations, the claim that Born does not have any major
Chinese baijiu customers which makes it less attractive is absolutely false. Don't forget that Chinese baijiu makers are
generally cash-making machines, if they can market their products successfully. There are hundreds/thousands of
baijiu makers in various regions and the top baijiu producers are just ice-berg tip of the whole things. Selling to major
ones does not naturally give you any advantage. On the contrary, selling to hundreds smaller or even no-brand baijiu
makers gives Born more bargaining power than otherwise.


I find Little knows little about the competitive landscape of the baijiu market.

Alfred Little: 
Firstly, the legal structure. I do not know which 'reputable Chinese counsels' you mentioned are, but I am quite sure
they know the regulatory environment of China and they know well that ALL the Chinese private companies which
went public offshore after the day-8th September 2006- on which “circular 10” was implemented, have not got any
approval from MOFCOM. They can successfuly went public on foreign exchanges only by using other means and by
avoding getting approvals from Chinese Ministry of Commerce since MOFCOM never granted and will not be likely to
grant such approvals. Therefore, Alfred, you are actually saying that hundreds of Chinese offshore listed companies
face the same kind of risk of legal restructuring. In the BORN case, an offshore entity set by the CEO's mother is safer
than the one set by some other 'independent friend'. By setting up the entity, Borun just need to get approval from
local commerce bureaus, while we can see the local government is activly supporting Borun because, after all, a
larger company contributes more to new jobs and taxes.


Secondly, Guangdong Zhongke New Energy Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (广东中科天元新能源科技有限公司) is
a leading designer which has advanced technologies to design and manufacture large alcohol facilities. Even the
facilities of the largest edible-alcohol producer, Meihekou Fukang(吉林梅河口阜康酒精有限责任公司), were
manufactured by this designer. It is right for Borun to hire this company for Daqing phase III project.There is also
nothing wrong for Borun to upgrade its existing facilities through Henan Sheng Wantongtong Machine Manufacture
Corp., Ltd. ( 河南省万通通机械制造有限公司). But the conclusion that the Wet-Process Method is totally abandoned
and that this technology is inferior can not be arrived from your information. It is possible that Borun will upgrade the
semi-dry method to Wet-process method or even some better method afterward by itself .

Thirdly, corn price. You made accurate and straight-forward caculation from data gained in the maket. But if Borun
used some lower-priced inventories that were purchased months ago, the caculation you made is too simple and
actually demonstrate nothing.


Fourthly, corn germ. Borun's acohol competitors do not produce corn germ, so does the 'expert consultant form a
competitor' really understand the manufacturing process of corn germ? Even if he/she does, did he/she visit there at
the right time? Whether Borun is producing a particular kind of product is not difficult to find, especially when it
produces only four kinds of products. If I were the CFO of Borun, I would not make such a low-level fraud and wait for
the auditors to check. And don't forget, the CFO of Borun also has Big-Four background and is aware of what he
should do to safeguard his reputation.


Furthermore, Borun was guided and lead to public by a venture capital called PreIPO Capital Partners Limited(优势资
本(私募投资)有限公司), which has invested RMB110million in Borun since 2008. The PreIPO is a prestigious venture
capital company which has also invested in EJ, FMCN, MY and many other listed companies. It is highly unlikely that
this venture capital is incentived to make big money by making fraud, especially through such a samll-cap company.


Afterall, I believe all the questions in the artical will be asked and answered in the coming 3rd-quarter conference call.
Anyway, the share price of a good growing company will go up enventually.

Geez, does this all make sense? Chinese companies bend or twist government rules to bypass the necessary
regulatory approval needed to go public oversea? Am I reading all these right? All these sound so shady. I
guess this may be one of the reasons why the market put a discount on them to the US companies, for the
incomprehensible legal structures and possible risks of getting the foreign investors' ownership nullified by the
government one day?


Jack, are you that same Jack who is the IR guy of BORN? My apologies if I'm mistaken. The tone of some of
your responses does sound like those IR type of statements promoting one's own stock? If you are the same
Jack, why not have the company officially address the market's concerns with a press release?

To your questions about government rules, the answer is YES. ALL of the private companies listed offshore,
including Hongkong Market and US market, have not got direct approval from Chinese Ministry of Commerce
since “circular 10” came into being. So they all 'twisted'. You can check.


In my opinion, this phenomenon shows that the Chinese government still has potential to let its economy be
more open to the world. Meanwhile, the power of the willingness of Chinese people to make fortune is huge.


I'm not Borun's IR. That's also true. I write so much here because I am investing in Borun.


Sorry, I can not depict the detail of Borun's technology but from public information we can see that it is not too
bad.

I'm no expert on Chinese laws, but like I mentioned before, this whole twisting the government rules to avoid
regulatory approval thing sounds so shady to me. So I guess your comment basically affirmed that, at the end
of the day, there's always a risk that the Chinese government could come in and nullify the whole legal
structure. If that happens, foreign investors could end up owning a piece of paper. Not saying it's going to
happen, but this is why perhaps these Chinese small caps deserve a lower valuation than the market as a
whole.

W.r.t the technology, I think the author made a valid point about if the technology is really the most advanced
(at least as it's presented in company's prospectus), why are they still planning an upgrade to a supposedly
less efficient one? The fact that the author can point out the name of the supplier doing the upgrade tells me
he has done quite a bit of digging on the technology to arrive at that conclusion.


Also, I think the whole debate here is not about technology. It's really about the margins. As I stated in one of
my other comments, I doubt a company selling a commodity in a very traditional industry can generate
margins way in excess of its peers, at least not on a sustainable basis. I'm impressed with the margin
calculation done by the author. So far no one has come up with a different calculation to refuse the numbers.
I'd like to see if the company can properly explain the numbers behind their own margins.

How do you know that their peers have lower margin? I see Borun's marigin familiar. Borun is now a listed
company, it has incentives to make higher EPS so as to boost its stock price. Meanwhile, its peers have
incentives to decrease their profits so as to pay less tax. That's common sense.


23 Oct 2010, 05:15 AM


Jack Wang
One more point here, I am not surprised at all to hear that some big 'baijiu' producers, such as ''Maotai(茅台)' and
'Wuliangye(五粮液)', do not buy Borun's products simply because they have their own acohol-manufacturing capacity.
I am confirmed that you do not know much about 'baijiu' as Chinese people do. Edible acohol is used when added to
lower branded ''baijiu' which is consumed in large quantity. Do you know 'wine'? Similarly, a old famous wine produer
do not buy edible acohol because acohol is produced when wine is being stored.


22 Oct 2010, 05:39 AM

Obviously the acohol industry will be more concentrated in the future. The Chinese government obsoleted
360thousand tons of acohol production capacity in 2009 and is obseleting 300thousand tons in 2010. From 2011 to
2015, according to the 'Sixteenth five-year plan' that is being drafted, we can expect that more acohol capacity will be
obsoleted. The to-be-closed capacity is truely environmental-unfriendly and energy-inefficient, so, this is truly
'outdated'. However, Borun was granted 330tousand tons of capacity, I can safely say that Borun's productivity is not
out-dated. Actually, as the only listed edible-acohol producer in China, it is leading the industry both in its
management ability and its technology. If Borun is listed in Shanghai or Shenzhen, it can easily get a price of 30x PE.
But in the US market where investors are more 'rational', it is now priced at this fair value. Then I expect that Borun's
share price will go up proportionately with its EPS growth. This is still a good choice, I would say.

I couldn't help but wondering, with your statement about the better valuation BORN could get in Shanghai,
why did they choose to go public in the US in the first place? It sounds like their cost of capital could be much
lower by selling stocks in China at such rich PEs? Again, mind elaborating your view on this?


Along with your earlier point about the complicated and possibly law-violating legal restructuring, I really can't
rule out the possibility that BORN had some "problem" getting approved to go public in China so US is really
their last resort?


I do agree with your point that investors in the US market are more rational in terms of the kind of PE they're
willing to put on a foreign small company, especially those in a very traditional, over-expanded industry like
this yet growing at some seemingly explosive rate?

You think Borun is in a very traditional, over-expanded industry. In the US, that is. But China is a developing
market where total retail sales increase more than 15% every year. Statistics is showing what is happening.


22 Oct 2010, 11:03 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
The retail sales are different because the end producers of baijiu actually have something BORN doesn't
have - it's called brand & pricing power. Perhaps, you can tell me how much of that 15% is from price
increase and from what I've heard, it's quite a lot. At the end of the day, BORN is selling something as old as
thousands of years - traditional. Everyone agreed the industry is way over-expanded. Most importantly,
BORN's product is a commodity. I guess my experience questions any company that reports margins that are
totally out of whack in a business with highly commoditized product.

Corrct two mistakes here: The 'Five-year plan' being drafted is the 'twelfth', not 'sixteenth'; the CFO of Borun
is a famale, mot a male.

anyone have any thoughts on CVVT?

If Borun wants to go public in China, it will wait in queue for a long time to get approval from Chinese Securities
Regulatory Commission, that is one reason in my thought.


If it goes public in China, the entity set up by the CEO's mother is not necessary any more.


Sure, through IPO in China a company can get more money, but there are also other advantages if it goes public
offshore. Chinese market is relatively less mature than US and Honkong Market, a company which want to posess
globle view can develop better in these markets. I have not enough time to show you now.


Hey man, don't you think that is oppotunity for you? I think so then I am right here.

Jack Wang
The 'Chinese market' I mentioned means mainland stock market in Shanghai and Shenzhen. Hongkong stock
market is an intergral part of Chinese market, though offshore to the mainland.

Chris Wu, Contributor
Thanks for the explanation. So weighting against a longer approval process to get them public in China,
selling stock in the US at a seemingly fire sale price of $7 (less than 4x PE) sounded like a much better
alternative to BORN? It still didn't clear my doubt that perhaps there are some "problems" within the company
that kept it from going public in China.


Interesting fact, if you calculate a PE based on the "adjusted" margins and earnings calculated in the article,
BORN actually sold stock with a quite good price at $7.


22 Oct 2010, 01:50 PM


Jack Wang
Whatever reason-by a mistake, intentionally or under great pressure-Piper Jaffray priced BORN at $7 less
than half a year ago, it now prices Borun at $22. In my opinion, the CEO of Borun made a mistake by not
delaying the offering to now. This mistake costs 2/3 of the 5million shares Borun offered. However, every
people, including the CEO himself, should forgive this mistake because the worry of the double dip spread the
whole world at that time. I believe many of us had made similar mistakes, by selling the stocks that we used
to love at low price, at that time. We all make mistakes, however, that doesn't matter since everything is going
on well.


I don't know the exact number, but there should be more than one hundred companies that were waiting to
get approved, or aleady approved but waiting to be listed, in Shanghai and Shenzhen at the time Borun went
public. In my opinion, if Borun choose to list in Shanghai or Shenzhen, it probably would wait for more than a
year(those who know the truth are welcomed to correct my mistake). There is a Chinese saying ''黄花菜都凉
了''-meaning ''It's too late''-which refers to this situation.


If Borun has any problem with its qualification to go public, why it passed SEC's inspection?

This article reminds me of the now infamous Cramer Effect where he told the public to get out of stocks during the
Credit Crisis. The market fell 10% in four days after his report.


I see BORN had a natural correction before it marches higher. As I commented in another article to someone
wondering if BORN will come down, I said that BORN has $14.95 in revenue per share according to Yahoo Finance
finance.yahoo.com/q/ks... , so I told him to use that as a buyback price if the stock does correct. And currently, the
stock is higher.

I like this comment especially. This comment directly describes Citron Research, muddy waters and the rest of the
fraud allegations being made within Seeking Alpha against Chinese Companies. This is why I ignore Citron, Muddy
waters and several authors on Seeking Alpha who continue to smear Chinese low float companies to make a trade.
Great quote!

"yet another lesson to U.S. investors who rely solely upon a company’s SEC filings and press releases for making
investment decisions. Investors need access to industry experts in China to properly evaluate a company..."

oh yea.. citron and muddy also rely on their 'private investigators'. How come they never participated in the
Investor Days? This clearly indicates Citron, Muddy, and the other smear campaigners are frauds. Let see
some real Due Diligence from these reporters.

BEA, you do not offer much evidence or reasoning while at the same time repeatedly mandating others to show this
evidence or reasoning. You are playing the role of a Kantian moderator without being Kantian yourself. Please offer
some rational substance, otherwise I see your role as empty, in a formal way--i.e. nothing.

All of you posters who raked the author over the coals and claimed to buy thousands of shares (and encouraged your
children to do the same)... how'd that work out for you? 7 months later BORN is trading under $4. As for those who
used IBD to support their positions - feeling foolish now? I'm an ex-IBD subscriber and they allowed themselves to be
used shamefully to hype and pump Chinese stocks that have been frauds. The list is huge: BORN, CAGC, PUDA,
CCME, LTF, HEAT. I could go on but I'm getting nauseous.
