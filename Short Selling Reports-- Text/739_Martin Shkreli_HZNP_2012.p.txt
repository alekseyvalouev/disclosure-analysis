Debt Burden Makes Horizon Pharma An Attractive Short
Jul. 26, 2012 3:20 AM ET86 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ:HZNP) is on investors' radars, as the company launched
DUEXIS in January 2012 and has an upcoming PDUFA date of July 26 for its second
product, RAYOS, a modified-release low dose prednisone. The stock has enjoyed a
~100% run-up in its share price during the month of June on little news. Horizon has
33.7MM shares outstanding, cash of $80.4MM, debt of $60MM, and at a share price of
$7.38, an enterprise value of $228MM. DUEXIS is a single-tablet combination of two
generic products, ibuprofen and famotidine, that was fully launched in January 2012 with
80 sales reps. The DUEXIS launch has been slow, with only $0.9MM in sales in the first
quarter of 2012. Accompanying these sales, was an SG&A expense of $16.2MM and a
first quarter net loss of $23.7MM. In the first quarter of 2012, Horizon burned through
$19MM in cash, which is substantially more than total revenue of $2.5MM, and unless
sales ramp substantially, the company may be in trouble, as I will detail in this article.


Unprofitable BioPharma Companies With Large Amounts of Debt Typically Do Not
Perform Well


Importantly, Horizon completed a $50.8MM private placement in March 2012 and entered
into a $60MM senior secured loan in February, netting a total of $81.6MM after paying off
$22.4MM of the previous Oxford and Kreos loans. I am particularly concerned with this
new debt, which I will discuss in greater detail. I do not believe many shareholders are
aware of the risk to equity associated with this debt.


Historically, unprofitable biopharmaceutical stocks with a considerable debt burden do not
perform well. For example, MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) is currently trading at a market
cap of $421MM, has an enterprise value of $822M, has a whopping $494MM in debt
($283.5MM from The Mann Group and $211 worth of notes due 2013 and 2015), and no
revenue in 2012. Furthermore, as of 1Q12, MannKind had cash of $56MM, burned
through $33MM in cash, and had a net loss of $38MM in 1Q12. At this rate, ManKind will
be out of money by the end of this quarter. The stock is currently down greater than 75%
since the accumulation of the debt. Most recently, MannKind completed a debt offering of
$100MM aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior convertible notes, which are due
2015.

Dendreon (NASDAQ:DNDN), which burned through $59MM in cash in 1Q12 and had a
net loss of $104MM, also has $574MM of debt on the balance sheet and over the past
year the stock has plummeted 85%, from a high of $39.53 to just over $6. Another
example is Savient (NASDAQ:SVNT), which burned $32MM in cash in 1Q12, recorded
1Q12 revenue of $3.5MM, and had a 1Q12 net loss of $34MM. Savient acquired $177MM
of debt on February 4, 2011. Since the issuance of Savient's debt, the company's stock
tanked almost 95%. These facts are hard to ignore. Horizon shareholders should heed the
lessons learned from these experiences - if company product revenues don't grow
sufficiently to repay the debt, then equity value is often wiped out when the creditors take
control.


Horizon's $60MM Loan Agreement Includes Many Worrisome Covenants


Horizon's debt may cause Horizon's shareholders to lose, big time. First, the debt accrues
interest at 17% annually, resulting in quarterly loan payments of $4.5MM. When one adds
the $4.5MM to the $19MM in cash the company burned in 1Q12, the quarterly burn rate
increases to $23.5MM, all else equal. With $80.4MM in cash at the end of the first quarter,
the company does not have enough cash to last more than three quarters at this burn
rate, or through 1Q13. To make the situation even worse, the debt holders have the option
to ask for an additional quarterly $4MM payment of the loan principal starting April 2013.
Unless sales of DUEXIS and RAYOS ramp significantly, the substantial burn will likely
force the company to seek additional capital, if expenses are unchanged. As I will point
out, I don't expect sales to ramp fast enough, however.


The most important covenants of Horizon's debt can be found in the fine print located in
the company's latest quarterly SEC filing. The most disconcerting debt covenant, that
investors should be aware of, requires that Horizon Pharma meet minimum trailing twelve
month (TTM) revenues, as assessed on a quarterly basis (see Figure 1 below). Note that
this covenant also includes "deferred revenue," which is typically inventory sales. This is
typically an additional 2 months worth of revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/750481-debt-burden-makes-horizon-pharma-an-attractive-short 3/20


As one can see from the Figure 1, for the June 30 quarter, Horizon must meet a TTM
revenue threshold of $10MM. I estimate that for this quarter, the total TTM revenue barely
passed the minimum at $11.5MM. I calculated this number by adding the total revenue for
the past 3 months, estimating $3.5MM in revenue for 2Q12, and accounting for two
months in deferred revenue. Of course, we will know the exact number when the company
reports second quarter earnings. I am most concerned, however, about the September 30
threshold of $20MM. I do not believe that Horizon will be able to meet this minimum
revenue threshold and therefore be in default of the debt.

Quarter Ended TTM Revenue


30-Jun-12 $10,000,000


30-Sep-12 $20,000,000

31-Mar-13 $40,000,000


30-Jun-13 $60,000,000


30-Sep-13 $70,000,000


31-Dec-13 $80,000,000


31-Mar-14 $90,000,000


June 30, 2014 and thereafter $100,000,000


Potential RAYOS/LODOTRA Sales Are Expected to Have Minimal Impact on
Horizon's Ability to Meet TTM Revenue Thresholds


If approved on the July 26 PDUFA, Horizon's RAYOS (A.K.A. LODOTRA, marketed in the
EU) is expected to be launched by the fourth quarter. Hence, I don't expect it to have
much of an impact on Horizon's ability to meet the September 30 $20MM revenue
requirement. Even if RAYOS is approved, I expect its sales to have minimal impact on the
company's top line, as it has had a disappointing performance in the EU. The EU
performance may be a good proxy for how it will do in the U.S. During 2009, 2010, and
2011, LODOTRA achieved sales of $6.6MM, $6.8MM, and $16.5MM, respectively.


DUEXIS Launch is Tracking Poorly and Not Generating Enough Revenue to Meet
Debt Covenant Thresholds

https://seekingalpha.com/article/750481-debt-burden-makes-horizon-pharma-an-attractive-short 4/20


Additionally, Horizon's newly launched DUEXIS has had a fairly anemic launch to date and
is currently tracking at a $7MM annual run-rate. This launch is tracking almost identically
to Somaxon's (NASDAQ:SOMX) SILENOR, which peaked at a $10MM run-rate. Based
upon the current drug launch trajectory of DUEXIS and the LODOTRA's EU experience, I
estimate that Horizon will record $15.8MM in total TTM revenue (3Q12 revenue estimate =
$4MM) by the end of 3Q12. According to my calculation, Horizon will not meet the $20MM
revenue threshold and subsequently trip the $60MM debt covenant.


Keep in mind that even if Horizon does somehow meet the September 30 threshold, the
minimum revenue requirement increases by $10MM each consecutive quarter. The bar
increases rapidly. Even if the DUEXIS launch mirrored VIMOVO's launch by
AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN), Horizon would still fail to meet the revenue thresholds.
Ultimately, I believe that DUEXIS, which is tracking poorly, and RAYOS, if approved, will
need to wildly surpass expectations if Horizon is to meet the revenue thresholds of the
debt.


Somaxon is a relatively good proxy for Horizon, in my opinion. Horizon's DUEXIS sales
trajectory is comparable to Somaxon's SILENOR. Note that on August 25, 2010, Somaxon
announced a co-promotion agreement with Proctor & Gamble. Since then, Somaxon
shares are down over 90%. Similarly, Horizon entered into a DUEXIS co-promotion
agreement with Mallinckrodt on June 18, 2011, and if the stock performs similarly to
Somaxon's following the announcement, expect shareholders to lose.


Generic Paragraph IV Filings Have Begun for DUEXIS


Another factor that may impact expectation of DUEXIS and RAYOS, if approved, is
possible Paragraph IV filings by generic drug manufacturers. Keep in mind that both
DUEXIS and RAYOS are formulations of generic active drug ingredients, so it is possible
for a generic manufacturer to file a Paragraph IV in anticipation of marketing a generic
form of either drug. Once a Paragraph 4 is filled, the company, or Horizon in this case, has
45 days to sue the generic manufacturers for patent infringement. After the suit is filed, the
FDA has to wait to approve or deny the filing until the generic manufacturer defends the
suit or 30 months, whichever comes first.


In fact, Paragraph IV filings for DUEXIS have already begun. At the end of March, just two
months after the DUEXIS launch, Horizon filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking to block Par Pharmaceutical Inc.
from marketing a generic version of DUEXIS. AstraZeneca's (AZN) VIMOVO, as
discussed above, is another drug that has been plagued by a slew of Paragraph IV filings.

Comments (86)


In March, June, and September 2011, Dr' Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE:RDY), Lupin Ltd.
(LUPIN), and Anchen Pharmaceuticals have all filled Paragraph IV filings for VIMOVO.
They are all currently in the discovery phase and are seeking to market a generic
VIMOVO before its 2023 patent expiration. With the overhang of Paragraph IV filings, it is
hard for investors to consider these products "long-lived" assets.


3.3 Million Warrants Become Exercisable August 22 and Will Surely Cause Stock
Dilution


Many investors are eagerly awaiting the RAYOS PDUFA date. I, however, would like to
point out another important date - August 22nd. As part of the February 2012 $60MM
senior secured loan, Horizon issued warrants to the lenders to purchase up to an
aggregate of approximately 3,277,191 shares. These warrants have an exercise price of
$0.01 per share, netting the lenders a total of $24.1MM based upon the company's current
share price of $7.38. These warrants become exercisable August 22, 2012. Given this
windfall profit for the lenders, I would expect these warrants to be exercised and for the
lenders to sell their shares, potentially putting pressure on the stock price.


The Bottom Line


For the reasons above, I believe investors should look at Horizon with a healthy amount of
trepidation and heed the lessons learned from other unprofitable biopharma companies
that have taken on debt. If Horizon Pharma is unable to meet the minimum revenue
thresholds mentioned above, the company is expected to default on the $60MM loan
agreement. The lenders will be able to demand accelerated repayment of all obligations
under the terms of the loan. The loan is secured by a lien covering all of Horizon's assets,
so if the company cannot meet the accelerated loan payments, then the lenders could
claim these assets. Based upon my analysis above and the current company valuation, I
believe that many equity holders are not aware of the risks associated with Horizon. There
is a very reasonable likelihood that Horizon defaults on the $60MM loan, per the
September 30 revenue threshold requirement.


Disclosure: I am short HZNP.

I have two silly questions because I am a beginner at stock investing. First, when you throw out a figure like
$21.4MM, what does MM stand for? I'm assuming "million".


There is one thing that caught my eye about this article. When addressing the revenues of Lodotra in Europe
which you deem "disappointing" you write: "During 2009, 2010, and 2011, LODOTRA achieved sales of
$6.6MM, $6.8MM, and $16.5MM, respectively." What is disappointing about a revenue increase of 244% year
over year 2010 to 2011???


I read revenue assessments for Horizon in 2013 reaching nearly $100,000,000 world wide. That would seem
to more than make the debt payments and operating expenses.


Finally, I didn't have the financials on Horizon nor become aware of the FDA bump in time to make an
investment but having seen this play out before taking a short at this time would seem wise. Impax Labs here
I come!!!

Debt can be seen directly from financials, but small cap drugs company is mostly evaluated based on drug

But looks like your logic on going short is based on reading comments written by longs on short article. Good
luck with that. No positions!

"There is a very reasonable likelihood that Horizon defaults on the $60MM loan, per the September 30 revenue
threshold requirement."


What you say is true, Mr Shkreli, but what you conveniently forget to mention is that with only 33M share outstanding,
Horizon should be able to benefit from an INCREASE in share price after an FDA approval by selling new shares in
an offering to raise any funds needed to meet their obligations. Instead, the companys hard work and millions of
dollars invested in getting to FDA approval are "rewarded" by having the stock driven down by hedge funds with
heavy short positions spreading fear and doubt and using illegal naked shorting tactics purely for their own

As Martin said: During 2009, 2010, and 2011, LODOTRA achieved sales of $6.6MM, $6.8MM, and $16.5MM,

If RAYOS can only match those sales, the company is indeed in trouble and certainly not worth the current
market cap.

What's the latest on the request by CREW to the SEC to investigate you for possible "illegal manipulation of the
market price of stock in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries", filed 1/12/12? That complaint was about
your effort to take down Navidea. Your column today warrants an amendment to that complaint. It's shocking that SA
allows someone with your track record to publish here - and in fact it raises questions about Seeking Alpha's own
intentions.


26 Jul 2012, 10:02 AM


William LeGro
And how about CREW's request to the US Attorney to the Southern District of New York (that would be Wall
Street) to investigate you " to determine whether he has illegally manipulated stock prices in the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries"? That you've appeared on CREW's radar speaks volumes,
given that this group has so many possibilities of financial and political corruption to investigate.
http://bit.ly/LRkhhz


Frankly, I'm beginning to think Seeking Alpha itself needs some investigation for continuing to publish you.


26 Jul 2012, 10:08 AM


William LeGro
Email to SA:


Why do you continue to allow Martin Shkrelli to write for SA? His professional track record is abysmal, and
both the SEC and the US Attorney in NYC have been asked to investigate him for illegal manipulation of the
biotechnology and pharm industries. His article today trying to drive down the price of HZNP is obviously
meant to support his short. It's one thing to announce your short, it's another to do it on the day of an FDA
action. It's incredible that you allow him to abuse the SA site this way. He contributes nothing, but can do a lot
of damage to individual investors, and I didn't think that was the purpose of SA.

The guy is right again. Maybe a pumper like you should be investigated. 
Guys like you William should be locked up for years.  
Beat it loser, clown, idiot. 
Martin is right every time maybe you should listen to him, what kind  
of idiot are you?

Stifel Nicolaus Sees An Opportunity In Horizon Pharma Shares


26 Jul 2012, 12:08 PM


sarigamalu
Currently, there are four firms covering Horizon. Stifel Nicolaus carries a price target of $10 on Horizon, while JMP
has a target of $16. The targets represent upside of 31 percent and 110 percent from today's price in the $7.50 to
$7.60 range, respectively.

26 Jul 2012, 05:03 PM


Adam Gefvert, CFA, Contributor
Now I understand why Martin published the article before FDA approval instead of waiting to short afterwards. He
correctly predicted that HZNP would plummet regardless of whether RAYOS got approved or not. It is strange though,
why would the stock immediately plummet? Wasn't the approval the best news that could've happened to the
company?


Oh nevermind. Didn't notice the dilution.


26 Jul 2012, 04:55 PM


LarryWh
Its not dilution, same thing happens on almost ever FDA approval. Folks run off to sell the stock once the
selling starts. The strangest one was AMRN, prior to the FDA approval they put a web site up that was
showing they got approval. The stock soared to 16 per share, then they get approval and it tanks....


Others that did the same thing were ARNA, AMRN, VVUS off top of my head.

Hi Martin: i did not see this question posed once in the comments....what happens if the company does go into default
on the TTM revenue criterion? Ie. What practically would happen? Would the lender be legally entitled to seize
whatever free cash HZNP has for example?


26 Jul 2012, 08:47 PM


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  That's the idea. I would imagine they would do a secondary before they actually default,
however.


26 Jul 2012, 10:07 PM


SRCtrades, Contributor
Hey Martin, great article. I think their might be a mistake though, the warrant dilution, they have been free to
sell since May.

srctrades: dude you are referring to a completely different set of warrants than Shkreli does in his article! So,
your point is incorrect. Yes, those warrants that you refer to have already been made effective for sale...but
they are not the ones that Shk is referring to.

27 Jul 2012, 07:17 AM


William LeGro
Despite my initial annoyance at Mr. Shkreli's timing of his article, the information is intriguing. His research skills are
obviously prodigious, but I can't know if he's presenting all of it since he does have a vested interest in pushing the
price down - and as of this morning it's down 18% just from the pre-market opening. And I'm stuck for the ride -
thankfully not badly stuck but it's kind of sickening nonetheless.


Much of what he describes as HZNP's loan agreement just doesn't make sense. Why the company would get itself
into that fix? Something's missing here. Either there's some mitigating factor he left unmentioned for his own
purposes, or what's missing from the company is rationality, competence or honesty, if not all three.


27 Jul 2012, 10:07 AM


EquitiesInDallas
Well in the short term, it looks like Mr. Shkreli was correct. The stock went down due to a dilution in shares according
to a previous poster? Can anyone confirm this?


27 Jul 2012, 10:47 AM


asavior
Wow Mr. Shkreli... thanks for the warning I wish I had listened carefully to your advice.


27 Jul 2012, 12:15 PM


Moosh
I will see next few days if not weeks, HZNP will go up. This is very common after FDA due to heavy sell off, then lots
of people get back in for next round. I went in at $6.00. I am open to hear any advise.


27 Jul 2012, 01:18 PM


John McCoy, Contributor
In my opinion, the sell off today was entirely profit taking from PDUFA players, similar to what happened with ARNA
and VVUS. Long term HZNP is fine, and the danger of a possible debt default is vastly overstated.


27 Jul 2012, 08:31 PM


Moosh
I agree with John, otherwise all these analysts wouldn't have price target $10-$16. Could you John tell me what is the
time frame to get to high $10 level please?

It was definitely fun reading all the comments today. The vitriol is amazing. After 71 comments, I could find very few
IQ points. HZNP remains in a downtrend as of today. For those who bought the stock at 6 and loved it, surely you will
love it even more at 5 and when it moves into the 4's. For those trusting the so-called analysts and their price targets,
I used to be that way. These days I quite enjoy making money while others learn the game.

The negatives cited by the author regarding HZNP were and are of concern, and his bear call on this stock was
certainly prescient and well done. However, there were positives then, as there are now. The FDA approval of RAYOS
is obviously one of them. Another is the manner in which DUEXIS is trending. Martin Shkreli had noted that,
"Horizon's newly launched DUEXIS has had a fairly anemic launch to date and is currently tracking at a $7MM annual
run-rate." As an update, here are the CEO's comments (excerpted from today's earnings call transcript) regarding
DUEXIS:


"First, results we present today for DUEXIS show continued progress in prescription demand. We reported increase
for DUEXIS of 91% gross revenues compared to the first quarter of 2012. We also reported an increase in total
prescriptions for DUEXIS of 81% versus the first quarter of 2012 ...


To further our focus to driving sales growth to DUEXIS in the U.S. we are now focused on finalizing the expansion of
our initial 80 person sales force to 150 sales representatives. In addition, we recently announced the co-promotion
agreement with Mallinckrodt [a pharmaceutical business of Covidien] ... Our sales force expansion along with this co-
promotion will enable us to significantly expand our reach and frequency against key high value prescribing
physicians to treat patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. We believe the combination of our additional
Horizon sales representatives along with the substantial promotional efforts of Mallinckrodt will increase our [call on]
position target to five-fold from 10,000 physicians to 50,000 physicians beginning in the fourth quarter. "


Of course, all of this base-building costs money, and the race is on regarding SG&A vs. (hopefully) ramped-up
revenues. Who wins the race? One factor to consider might be who has skin in the game, and whether they represent
serious investors or the pump-and-dump crowd. For it may be reasonably assumed that if there are serious investors
here with some meaningful capital at risk, then their (presumed) due diligence would be correlated with a favorable
investment outcome.


A few days ago (August 2) it was reported that Sutter Hill Ventures has a 6.1% stake in Horizon. "Sutter Hill has
financed technology-based start-ups and assisted entrepreneurs in building market-leading companies since 1962"
(from their website). A Managing Director of Sutter Hill is Jeffrey Bird. A year ago, Bird bought 143,000 shares of
HZNP at 9. This past February, he bought an additional 680,000 shares at 3.59, bringing his position to over 833,000
shares at an average price of 4.58/share. In similar fashion and over the same period, Atlas Venture Fund (another
venture cap group) made two purchases totaling close to 1.2 million shares, averaging 5.28/share. A third group -
Essex Woodlands Health Ventures - has made two purchases totaling just over 3 million shares, at an average price
of 4.17/share.


Do these folks strike you as short-term hit-and-run types, or serious venture capitalists who, over the longer term,
seek incubation-type opportunities where they can multiply their risk capital by 10- or 100-fold? Just sayin'.

You are simply pissed off because their product is simple, combination of 2 generic drugs , or time release of what is
there already. Well I have a news for you, it doesn't matter. I remember this company, I think it was called Koss
pharma, and I think it was taken over, it had one product, a controlled release Niacin, it garnered sales over $500
million, stock went over $50. Do you rember Biovale, it made quite a few people very rich by bringing to market a
controlled release version of a drug gone generic, company went fron market cap of less than $100 million to several
$billion; stock went from $5 to split adjusted $300, it is now under the name of VRX after having gone through
mergers and acquisitions.


Utility is very important, now if you think combining Motrin and Nexium, which I personaly think is a bad medicin works
better, maybe you can start a company combining those 2. 
From the numbers you gave yourself, the growth rates were very impressive albeit from small base; maybe company
having seen the growth rate, thinks it is time to scale up. I am a bit disturbed by method of the stock offering, I never
like stock offerings, but I bet this won't be a drawn out process and you will read soon that offering was done; I would
have preferred this was done by way of secondary syndicate offering. As far as finances go, again according to your
own numbers, their cash on hand is in excess of their total debt, that is not so bad considering that clinical trial
expensses are behind them.


Do yourself a favor, cover your short, there isn't that much to gain here, the market cap is way less than what it
already cost to develope these drugs. if you are right, you may have $2 to gain on your shorts, but if stock lives to
copy the samples I gave you, you stand to lose your shirt and your reputation.

uncommon sense investing
Why would physicians prescribed, or patients pay for, two medicines that can be bought over the counter?
Most patients will not have GI issues w NSAIDs, and if the do or if they have risk factors, theyhave a virtual
OTC armamentarium to coose from. Most folks have both types of medicines at home already. Nothing novel
here - wake up and smell the coffee - the writing is on the wall - or should I say chart. One remote possibility,
a company like Salix might buy them, but they probably have much better prospects on hand.
