Mechel	ADR	Arbitrage:	New	York-Listed	ADRs	More	Than	20%	Higher
Than	Moscow-Listed	Shares

Owners	of	Mechel	(NYSE:MTL)	ADRs	are	paying	20%	more	for	their	ownership	stake	in
the	company	than	what	they	could	be	paying	in	Moscow.


The	ADRs	are	seemingly	ignoring	the	"home"	price	in	Moscow,	and	dancing	to	their	own
tune.


Aside	from	giving	the	ADRs	a	small	(maybe	2%	at	most?)	premium	for	the	convenience	of
trading	a	NYSE-listed	stock	that	trades	in	US	Dollars	and	not	Russian	Rubles,	there
should	not	be	such	a	large	discrepancy	between	the	price	of	the	Moscow-listed	shares
and	the	ADRs	listed	on	the	NYSE.


Current	valuation


Mechel's	shares	closed	at	65.00	RUB	on	6	January.	Using	the	exchange	rate	of	33.24,	the
USD-equivalent	close	in	Moscow	was	1.96	USD.


However	at	9.48	am	in	New	York,	when	the	Moscow-listed	shares	closed	for	the	day,	they
were	trading	for	2.38	USD.


The	ADRs	would	need	to	fall	by	17.6%	in	order	for	them	to	be	trading	at	the	same	level	as
they	are	in	Moscow.


Catalyst	for	ADRs	to	decline


More	than	anything,	this	article	serves	as	a	warning	to	holders	of	Mechel	ADRs,	and
indeed	all	ADRs	generally,	not	to	automatically	assume	that	their	stock	is	priced	at	the
same	level	as	the	domestic	listing	of	the	company.


As	with	other	market	mispricings,	they	can	suddenly	disappear	with	little	or	no	warning.


Holders	of	Molycorp's	mandatory	convertible	preferred	(MCP-PA)	were	hit	with	a	39.6%
loss	in	9	trading	sessions	in	November	2013,	as	"investors"	finally	realised	their	stream	of
dividends	will	end	in	early	2014.	The	stock	opened	at	$17.91	on	13	November,	and
reached	an	intraday	low	of	$10.81	on	25	November.

Holders	of	Bank	of	Ireland's	ADRs	were	hit	with	a	45.6%	loss	in	10	trading	sessions	in
October	2011,	as	"investors"	suddenly	woke	up	to	the	fact	their	stock	was	trading	at	a
massive	premium	to	the	company's	London-listed	shares.	The	stock	closed	at	$10.20	on	6
October	2011,	but	declined	to	$5.54	on	20	October	2011.


Mechel's	situation	is	very	similar	to	that	of	the	Bank	of	Ireland,	as	outlined	in	our	two
articles	from	2011.	All	that	remains	is	to	wait	and	see	for	how	much	longer	the	NYSE-listed
shares	trade	at	a	large	premium	to	the	Moscow-listed	shares.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	MTL.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.
I	am	not	receiving	compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business
relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is	mentioned	in	this	article.

pipster
great	article	i	am	just	wondering	why	you	neglected	to	mention	MTL's	shareholder	structure?


"Mechel	OAO	issued	555,027,660	outstanding	shares,	out	of	which	75%	are	common	and	25%	–	preferred	shares.	"


416,270,745	common,	138	756	915	preferred


the	common	is	broken	down	into	3	parts.


"Igor	V.	Zyuzin*,	Chairman	of	the	Board	of	Directors,	Mechel	OAO	226,187,142	54.34%"


"Deutsche	Bank	Trust	Company	Americas	ADRs/GDRs,	traded	at	New	York	Stock	Exchange	140,456,993	33.74%"


"Other	shareholders	(incl.	free-float	shares	at	Russian	stock	exchange)	49,626,610	11.92%"


so	as	you	can	see	the	ADR	is	the	market	unless	Igor	V.	Zyuzin,	sells	his	shares,	then	the	russian	market	would
overtake	the	American.


so	this	debunks	your	whole	"The	ADRs	are	seemingly	ignoring	the	"home"	price	in	Moscow,	and	dancing	to	their	own
tune."	it	is	the	russian	shares	that	are	ignoring	the	ADR	pricing.

Studioso	Research,	Contributor
Author’s	reply	» 	Thanks	for	that	information	Pipster.	You're	right	in	saying	that	the	US	market	is	larger	if	we
are	to	exclude	the	shares	owned	by	Zyuzin.


However	those	shares	do	continue	to	exist,	even	if	they	are	not	actively	traded.	Furthermore,	MTL	is	a
Russian	company,	and	in	these	situations,	the	"home"	price	is	usually	the	"real"	price.


Regardless	of	our	disagreement,	maybe	we	can	agree	that	there	should	not	be	such	a	large	difference	in	the
price	between	the	New	York	listing	and	the	Moscow	listing.	As	you	suggest,	the	Moscow	price	could	rise	to
"meet"	the	New	York	price.
