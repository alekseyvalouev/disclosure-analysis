NOBLE GROUP: HOW MANY TIMES CAN
YOU FOOL THE SAME PEOPLE?


February 24, 2017  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 12 Comments  


The multi-year quest for a “strategic” investor


Here we go again. Noble is in early talks with an investor to potentially


acquire a stake in Noble, and the share price surged following the


news. Sounds familiar? Probably because this already happened a few


times. Eighteen months ago (August 2015), Reuters reported that Noble was


considering raising funds from a strategic investor to “revive confidence”.


One year later, in September 2016, Bloomberg announced that Noble was


still seeking a strategic investor. Shares jumped 9.5% that day. Noble’s


supporters will argue that this time is different. We have a name: Sinochem.


We heard the same name one year ago. But wait a second: Sinochem is now


given access to the books and is conducting due diligence. This should be a


good sign, right? In fact this means that Sinochem has not yet reviewed


Noble’s balance sheet. The Chinese group is not the first company to review


Noble’s books. For almost two years, Noble has desperately tried to find a


“strategic” investor. The price-to-book ratio of 62% seems very attractive


and Noble cannot be too picky because of its liquidity issues. Yet absolutely


no investor came in.


Noble is not worth its book value, or even 62% of its book value. It is worth


much less than that, if there is any residual value left. Discussions are only


at early stage and due diligence typically takes six months to a year. Any


potential investor needs to value the commodity contracts, which are the


heart of Noble’s financial manipulations. This includes the fair value gains


($4b, not less than 102% of equity) but also importantly the future liabilities


($1.7b). The investor has to make sure that no off-balance commitment is


hidden, etc. This is a very lengthy process. After we published our reports,


Noble kept repeating that these contracts were correctly valued. Then 48


hours before their 2015 annual results, Noble and its auditor, EY, suddenly

realised that these contracts had to be impaired by $1.1b. Oops!… So are the


commodities contracts (assets and liabilities) correctly valued now? Of


course, they are not. Noble has been battling liquidity issues for months and


any trader would have sold these contracts a long time ago if they were


valued correctly. Instead the company has sold everything else (Agri, Energy


Solutions, etc).


Noble’s alternative facts to explain its crisis


The rebound in commodities prices in 2016 has turned around the fortunes


of many commodities firms. To the disappointment of its shareholders,


Noble has been the notable exception.


Since February 2015, when we published our reports, Noble, a trader, is


down 77%. BHP, which is a miner, is down 20%. Glencore, a trader and a


miner is up 25%. World Fuel Services (ticker: INT), a trader, is down 25%.


So how to explain Noble’s terrible performance? Facing criticism of its


accounting and a falling share price, Noble has tried to reassure its


shareholders. After various attempts, and contradictions, Noble and its


chairman, Richard Elman, came up with a simple but effective narrative. It


could be summarized as: “We don’t have any accounting issue. We are hit by


low commodities prices like everybody else in the industry. This explains


why we have bad results, and why our share price plunged.”


The narrative has been very successful outside the trading industry. Many


analysts attribute at least part of Noble’s troubles to low commodity prices.


It was built on the common misconception that a company like Noble, a


commodity trader, is profitable when commodities prices are high, and


suffer losses when commodities prices are low. Unfortunately, this is the


business model of a commodity producer, for example miners like BHP or


Rio Tinto. But it is not Noble’s business model, which is primarily a trader.


Traders do not need high commodities prices to be profitable. They derive


most of their profit from positions (long or short) or arbitrages. They can


make money (or record losses) at any level of price. What they need is


volatility, not high prices. Noble constantly complained about commodity


prices or industry headwinds. Peers have been doing absolutely fine amid

low prices. For example, Vitol recorded bumper profit of $1.6b in 2015 when


oil prices fell. Trafigura recorded net income of $1.1bin in 2015. As the chart


above shows, the share price of World Fuel Services is hardly correlated to


commodities prices, which is normal for a trader.


Noble has an indirect long exposure to commodities prices with its


suppliers’ contracts. However, the problem is that many of these suppliers


don’t produce anything. Noble signed contracts with companies that exist


on paper, but have no producing mines or have not even financing in place.


For these contracts, it does not matter if prices are high or low: suppliers


cannot supply anyway.


Noble’s most loyal shareholders have patiently waited Noble’s recovery. Of


course, there was a risk with Noble’s narrative: what would happen if prices


go up? This is exactly what happened in 2016. Coal prices surged to levels


last seen in 2012. But Noble’s operations have still recorded losses and burnt


not less than $801m in 9M 2016, after burning $465m in 2015. Shareholders


have been misled once again. Noble will continue to disappoint because the


cause of the crisis has never been commodity prices (too low, too high) or


any other external factor. The root of the crisis is how management and the


auditor, EY, have misrepresented the financial performance of this


company and its balance sheet for years.


From time to time, Noble may record positive operating cash flow due to


working capital movements or seasonal factors. This is what happened last


year in Q4 2016. Optimism was short-lived though. The stock fell again.


Noble’s situation has not stabilized at all. The company is a shadow of its


former self. Noble had to sell its assets and raise $500m in Q3 to survive. The


cash cow Energy Solutions is gone. Noble used to be rated investment grade.


It was downgraded by four notches. Banks have tightened the leash and


raised interest costs. Higher interest is a slow poison for traders that require


ample bank facilities for their daily operations.


The same people who created this fiasco still run Noble


Shortly after we published our reports, Chairman Richard Elman said: “I’d


like to reiterate, for the record, that we categorically reject all allegations


made in the recent reports as inaccurate, unreliable and misleading. You


cannot get a stronger statement from a publicly listed company.” He added


that “Noble is in a robust financial condition.” Then, the company was


forced to recognize heavy losses. Its share price collapsed and Noble is now


fighting for its life. All our arguments have been confirmed. One simple


example: Noble overvalued Yancoal by $511m on its balance sheet when we


published. Former CEO Alireza explained that when coal prices rebound,


Yancoal’s market value would surge and the gap would narrow. Coal prices


have rebounded but the gap between the carrying value at that time and the

https://iceberg-research.com/2017/02/24/noble-group-how-many-times-can-you-fool-the-same-people/ 4/9


current market value is still $488m. So obviously, there are problems with


Noble’s discounted cash flow models.


Noble was a repeat of Enron. The same accounting methods have been used


to paint a fundamentally misleading picture of the balance sheet. Some


would argue that Noble is different because it has not yet filed for


bankruptcy. Enron’s shareholders lost 100% of their capital. Noble’s


shareholders have lost 78% of their capital since the manipulations have


been exposed. From their point of view, there is no big difference.


What happened was possible because a very small group of senior managers


worked together with the assistance of the auditor and deceived investors.


This small group financially benefited from these misrepresentations.


Noble still refuses to disclose the individual remuneration of its senior


managers. Shareholders invested in Noble based on these


misrepresentations and lost billions. The institutional investors will survive


the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. But some individual shareholders


have lost part of their retirement money. They thought that Noble was an


investment grade blue chip because they trusted management and the


auditor. 


A few managers who had an instrumental role in this fiasco have left the


ship: for example, former CEO Yusuf Alireza or former CFO Robert van der


Zalm who vanished suddenly. However, management has not really


changed at Noble. In particular, founder Richard Elman, remains chairman.


Due to his role and knowledge of the company, there is no doubt that he was


the key person behind Noble’s accounting decisions. Not a single time since


the beginning of the controversy, Mr Elman has publicly offered any


detailed explanation on Noble’s accounting. Instead, he quoted Churchill


and offered “blood, tears, sweat” to his shareholders who were not feeling


particularly well already. What he did not offer was to share their


“sacrifice” by suspending salaries to senior managers and himself.


In June, 2016, Mr Elman announced he would step down within 12 months.


But two months later, Mr Elman clarified he “will not quit until we have


restored value”. This is not going to happen. The FT reported that in an


internal email, he planned to be around for “the next 50 years”. He is 76


years old.   


With Noble, denial and delusion are always fundamental in the way the


company operates. With great fanfare, Mr. Elman launched a lawsuit


against us. Beyond the combative rhetoric, the reality is that the legal action


has been at a standstill for a long time. Noble’s lawyers do not seem to know


what they sue us for. Noble has become almost completely unresponsive for


a year. We are asking the Hong Kong Court to strike out Noble’s claims. We

SGX has oversight over Noble why are they mumb about their


accounting affair?


Iceberg Research · February 26, 2017 - 6:45 am · Reply→


SGX is a for-profit company and is asked to regulate its


sources of profit. There is no known example where this


believe that courts of law should be used for more serious matters than


delusional lawsuits launched by delusional companies.


Executive management is also the same. A protégé of Richard Elman,


William Randall, was appointed co-CEO. Mr Randall was previously the co-


head of “Hard commodities” where we identified most of Noble’s financial


manipulations, including Yancoal. It is difficult to see how the appointment


of a manager who has been so deeply involved in Noble’s aggressive


accounting could lead to better transparency for Noble’s stakeholders.


And last but not least, the auditor remains the same: EY Hong Kong.


Without EY, this scandal would have never been possible. EY Hong Kong and


its audit partner (Peter Picton-Phillipps) were fully aware of what was going


on. It is surprising that no lawsuit has been launched against the auditor


yet, considering its role. In Hong Kong, the SFC has recently commenced


legal proceedings against Hanergy’s directors, another major accounting


scandal audited by exactly the same auditor: EY Hong Kong.


There is nothing fundamentally new at Noble: the same toxic balance sheet,


the same key managers who created one of the largest financial


manipulations in recent history, the same smoke and mirrors tactics to


explain Noble’s struggles, and from time to time the same false hopes of


recovery.

Noble didn’t reveal that Sinochem’s new CEO Frank Ning, who


has also bought Noble’s Agri in the past, was interested in taking


a stake in Noble. It was Reuters that first reported there had been


several meetings last year, forcing Noble to put out a statement


on SGX’s request

Credit lines granted by the banks (USD 1B unconsolidated

So far Noble has only refinanced 1B revolving credit facility out


of 3B. that’s the real story.

The insufficient disclosure on the commodity/derivative


contracts and borrowing facilities terms are concerning.


Myrddin Seren · February 24, 2017 - 11:54 pm · Reply→


For posterity – there are some rich ironies here.


Yancoal and its Chinese parents have obviously received Beijing


approval to dive in to the overflowing pot of FX and recycle some


dollars in return for assets outside China.


When the CEO of Rio says:


Yancoal provided “the only offer that


represented compelling value for the assets”.


That means there was daylight between Yancoal’s bid and the


runners up. Going to be hard for others to match Yancoal’s


valuation model and, by extension, value Noble’s stake.


There are some moving parts to the deal, but Yancoal is going to


have to raise A$2-3 billion. Present market cap is A$338 mil. The


mother of all dilutions is coming to Noble soon. Or they have to


find a pile of cash to toss in to the pot.


At the same time, another branch of China Inc, Sinochem, is


supposedly circling Noble looking for value to have a crack at


more of the China Inc FX pile.


Going to be fun to see how Sinochem squares the circle on Noble


after the Yancoal/C&A deal.

So Noble goes on its duping spree again. Or should we say


investors continue on a duped spree. How daft can bond analysts


be? Noble today announced a 5Y bond at 9% area. Just a few days


back, the company’s earnings report said they had ample


liquidity (to quote “USD 2 bn of liquidity headroom”). They said


they had enough liquidity to cover 2017 debt maturities. Then


why the desperation to issue at such high cost? Especially if


Sinochem is buying a stake, Noble as a trader should know most


of all, that they just need to wait till Sinochem buys a stake and


then they can issue at half this cost. So this desperate bond issue


means the company has no liqudiity and no upcoming strategic


investment. 


It beats me that so many sell side bond analysts still have a Buy


recommendation on Noble. Wake up bondholders. Havent you


learnt enough?
