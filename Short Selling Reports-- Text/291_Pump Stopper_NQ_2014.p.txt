5/22/2018 NQ Mobile: Current Law Enforcement Investigation Now Added To Fraud Allegations Amidst Delayed Audited Financials - Link Motion In…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217603-nq-mobile-current-law-enforcement-investigation-now-added-to-fraud-allegations-amidst-delayed-audited-financials


Fellow Financial Detective Muddy Waters has conducted extensive research on NQ
Mobile Inc. (NQ) that indicates to them that NQ is a "massive fraud" that they believe is
worth "zero". In the 7 reports they have published on their website they allege with
significant detail that the cash balances are "highly likely to be not real" and bizarrely
auditor PWC even classifies NQ's cash as a Level 2 asset (slightly hard to value) in the
2012 audited financials.


In response, NQ organized a special committee in October 2013 to investigate the fraud
allegations which is set to report its findings tomorrow May 15th, which is the same date
that NQ's audited financials are required to be filed with the SEC after they filed a 15 day
extension on April 30 (the un-extended due date).


New Law Enforcement Investigation Per SEC FOIA Request


I have shocking NEW information: Per a SEC Freedom of Information Act Request - there
is an ongoing Law Enforcement Investigation into NQ now as well!


Muddy Waters has criticized that the Special Committee isn't truly independent and even
offered to pay for an independent accounting firm to evaluate the credibility of the
investigation. Now it looks like there is a truly independent party that works for the US
Government here to investigate as well!


I highlight the specific relevant language out of the FOIA document:


"We are withholding records responsive to your request under 5 U.S.C. 552 (B) (7)
(A), 17 CFR 200.80 (7) (I). This exemption protects from disclosure records
compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be
expected to interfere with law enforcement activities."


From the Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act:


"The first subpart of Exemption 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, Exemption 7,
authorizes the withholding of 'records or information compiled for law enforcement
purposes, but only to the extent that production of such law enforcement records or
information . . . could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement
proceedings.'"


THIS IS IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION
INTO NQ MOBILE IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY

How Have Chinese Fraud Companies Played Out in the Past? A history lesson


Dozens of fraudulent Chinese companies have disappeared from the market since 2010.
Some did not receive detailed scrutiny from financial detectives and short sellers but had
their results fade away after they had collected their money and taken it to China and
simply ceased filing financials on time.


The most explosive blow ups of Chinese frauds, mostly in 2011 would play out as follows:


The day audits were normally due, an extension would be filed granting 15 extra days
April 1 there would be a filing that the auditor had been unable to file an unqualified
opinion or resigned and the stock would be halted
The NYSE/Nasdaq would ask for clarification and after several months passed
The stock would be delisted to the pink-sheets, down ~80% from the last closing price


This played out particularly with China MediaExpress (OTCPK:CCME) and Longtop
Financial (LTF) which:


Had Big 4 auditors (Deloitte in both these cases)
Fabricated the vast majority of their cash balances in China
Fabricated the vast majority of their revenue
Delisted and went to $0 months later

There are still some China frauds left to be halted unfortunately: LLEN and LIWA were
recently halted and delisted in the last two months!


NQ Management Response


I contacted NQ multiple times through their IR contact but did not receive a response.


Muddy Waters does the best China Fraud research in the business. Best of luck to Longs
tomorrow as the independent committee reveals its findings!


Disclosure: I am short NQ. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Your link to the letter clearly states that


"...the Commission does not disclose the existence or non-existence of an investigation or information gathered
unless made a matter of public record in proceedings brought before the Commission or in the courts. Accordingly,
the assertion of this exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any
violations of law have occurred with respect to any person, entity, or security. "


Your letter doesnt say anything new really. MW already alerted the SEC about their alleged fraud and the SEC
probably is watching to see what happens. This letter only confirms that fact.

First: "there is an ongoing Law Enforcement Investigation into NQ now as well!"  
Please, provide a date (document that is to specify the month and year) when they began this investigation.


Second: If you are a short seller and you know that NQ is a fraud and there is ongoing investigation which will
result in a delisting from NY stock exchange, why would not you just sit there and watch the stock falling and
as a result reaping huge profits? If you know you are 100% sure, that just means you can easily make money
without telling anyone...but why are you telling people if you are 100% sure? ...and PLEASE dont tell me that
you are a good boy and care about our money because we all know you are a SS

What I read on the document you linked to did not state that there was an investigation. " …. the commission does not
disclose the existence or non-existence of an investigation .." Followed by "Accordingly the assertion of this

because the SEC isn't in the business of moving markets in either direction so it gives non-answers unless
real action is announced.

Author’s reply »  all of you that think this doesn't mean that some law enforcement agency and/or the SEC
are looking into NQ should stop spending your time commenting on the internet and actually go and call the
SEC's FOIA branch. They will confirm that 7a exemptions are used when some sort of investigation is
underway. I don't see how having a law enforcement investigation looking into your investment could ever be
considered a good thing but to each their own.


14 May 2014, 01:50 PM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I recommend you call the SEC FOIA office and ask them why and when they use 7a
exemptions. They will tell you, as they told me, that they use these when there is an investigation underway.

It's fairly obvious the SEC wouldn't go through the trouble of withholding documents if there was no reason to
withhold documents.


file a FOIA on a company NOT under investigation and the FOIA response you receive states that very
clearly and mentions no issue with withholding documents or any 7a exemptions


14 May 2014, 02:06 PM


North Gate
Pumpstopper, who don't you publish the letter you sent to the SEC to get the response letter, I bet it will show
your request was intentionally overly broad so as to include any investigation related to any company
containing any mention of NQ or any request to NQ for law enforcement data related to a current
investigation, such as a request to look inside someone's vault information.

"what appears to be a law enforcement investigation" is very different from your title. It seems like you are
backing down from your original statement,"NQ Mobile: Current Law Enforcement Investigation Now Added".
Is this just another short and distort piece?


14 May 2014, 02:40 PM


rns702
Author never commits to anything concrete ".... with what appears to be a law enforcement investigation...".
However, the title which is what most people will read and not the letter itself could be contrived as
defamatory to the company he has a short position on! See, I can use the same language that he uses to
make my point without commitment...


Bottom line is, the shorts like this guy will be hounding the longs until NQ comes up with 20-f and audit.

The assertion of withholding documents assumes that the documents must exist. You could request the same
documents from the SEC on any publicly traded company and you would get the exact same answer. By your "logic"
that would prove that every publicly traded company that exists is under investigation.


14 May 2014, 01:42 PM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  your comment XYQ11 is 100% false, the SEC does not hand out replies to FOIAs that are
identical to this one for every public company. I have filed many many FOIAs in my day and it is only a very
small percentage of companies that are under a current investigation by some law enforcement agency.


14 May 2014, 02:03 PM


wbryan2549
I believe anytime an agency gets correspondance it opens a file. Weither the correspondence stared an
investigation is the issue. I don't believe the agency will answer that question unless a Foia is filed and
approved. Yours was denied but keep in the file in case there is a reason to approve it. 
Your response from the Sec is mean less.

ikarus
I have no position in NQ but the article got my attention and I decided to call the SEC to clarify this. Two main points
out of the call:


1) The SEC only provides a 7A exemption as is the case in this FOIA if there is a current investigation. This is a fact
and is not disputable. So there is a current law enforcement investigation into NQ.


2) Very few public companies have current investigations at any one time. The person I spoke with did not have data
to quote me but she said it is <0.5% of public companies.


So I think actually this article is a lot more legitimate than some people are making it out to be. Maybe you disagree
but feel free to call the SEC 202-551-8300 if you want to get the answers yourselves.


14 May 2014, 02:29 PM


18218242
Thank you ikarus for clarifying the fact, as I was wondering if any specific document was requested by the author.


14 May 2014, 02:34 PM


CalMike
I realize I'm grasping at straws here, but asking a question: is it possible the SEC has information on NQ because of
some other investigation and is noting the 7A exemption because of that investigation, and not anything actively
looking into NQ?


14 May 2014, 02:38 PM


lbcb321
People are misinterpreting this statement:


"Accordingly the assertion of this exemption should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff
that any violation of law have occurred"


It should not be construed that a VIOLATION OF LAW has occurred. In other words... innocent until proven guilty. The
INVESTIGATION is definitely ongoing, but not all investigations result in the finding of unlawful activity.


The way the SEC works is unless they have already determined there is likely an impropriety, they do not open a
formal file (investigation). It gets blown out in the informal, inquiry phase.


What is relevant is the company is not required to disclose publicly when they receive informal inquiries from the SEC,
but they ARE required to disclose when they are notified of a FORMAL investigation. Watch that section in their report
when (if?) they report tomorrow.


14 May 2014, 02:47 PM


ikarus
This is true and was also revealed during the call. There is no guarantee that a violation has occurred. There
is an investigation. Whether or not it proves something against NQ remains to be seen.

Well, my guess then, is that if anyone accuses a company of fraud and files a complaint with the SEC then they are
required to open a case regardless of whether the case has merit and regardless of whether the person accusing the
company of fraud is a short-seller hoping to make lots of money off of his accusation.


14 May 2014, 02:54 PM


North Gate
Actually talked to the SEC FOIA division and a couple of interesting things were mentioned:


1. the letter requesting information (which was interestingly not posted) requested any and all information regarding
NQ, so if law enforcement requested information on an NQ Mobile Vault for the purpose of a completely unrelated
investigation... then you get this letter. A more narrowly worded letter request might get a different response, for
example.


2. Apparently the person behind "Pumpstopper" has requested a lot of these letters on a lot of other companies that
are under shortseller attack. Interesting play, however, "Pumpstopper" might find out that he/she/it needs all the short
sale proceeds to pay for lawyers once the SEC turns its sites on this fragrant stock manipulation scheme. Using the
SEC's own letter to manipulate stocks, pretty bold call sir.


14 May 2014, 03:18 PM


Milkweed, Contributor
What difference does it make how the request was worded if the result is verification that the law is
investigating NQ. I seriously doubt they're hiding a file on an investigation into Omar Khan's Jay Walking
violation. BTW requesting information does not constitute a "fragrant" stock manipulation scheme.


14 May 2014, 04:47 PM

I wouldn't describe it as "fragrant". Rancid, heinous, God-awful-stanky might be more appropriate adjectives...

You have no proof of a law enforcement investigation. Rubbish article. It just says, "We can't say if we're doing

I opened the link given by the author and just called the number shown on the letter (p2) from Office of FOIA Services
SEC. I talked with two people including 
one researcher on such cases. I read the "we are witholding records ...552(b) 7(A).." 
paragraph to both of them and asked for explanation. They told me that's a general 
format in their responding to a request for disclosing records against a company. It does not mean they are looking
into the company.

Maybe I am kind of slow, but the letter actually don't say anything bad about NQ, just confirmation that the letter of
complaint was received....I am pretty sure, if I write them with request for investigation some publicly traded company
and accuse them with fraud , they will send me same response ...... honestly think with such bad former experience
with some Chinese companies, if the group of big short seller get together they can do it the same to the lot of other
Chinese companies.....maybe they will try Alibaba later on .....LOL

company who claimed there 450 million users he owned,in Chinese people thoughts,there are two ideas about
NQ:1,whats NQ? 
2,NQ,go to hell,a fraud company!come on,learn some Chinese.


14 May 2014, 08:23 PM


ShihRyanJ
As much as I think NQ is a joke, I actually don't put much weight into this letter. The letter is very boilerplate SEC
language which I have seen many, many times.


The SEC will ALWAYS going to say they have no comment or cannot release information on any particular company
for enforcement purposes, regardless whether there is an enforcement action or not.


If there is an enforcement action, they certainly cannot comment.


If there is no enforcement action, the SEC is not likely to comment because there is ALWAYS THE POTENTIAL for an
enforcement action, even for a real company like say Google. So by release information, the SEC would in effect
potentially compromise any investigation, so they take the conservative approach and just shuts up (like many NQ
long should also do). So look at it from the SEC's perspective - what do they have to gain by release ANY records or
information regardless if there is an enforcement action or not?


The interesting part will be how NQ management responds to SA article. If they are smart about it, then they should
actually deny that they have received an enforcement letter (you get one of those when you get an enforcement
action). This is actually one of those times NQ needs to speak, whereas in the past NQ IR speaks stupid shxt without
saying a whole lot (remember the who earnings release date fiasco?).


NQ is a joke for completely other reasons, and too many to name here. You guys should pay more attention to
noChinesestock and other Chinese speakers on these threads. If you Googled or Baidu'd "网秦 谁在用", which
literally means "NQ who is using it", you will get all the evidence of NQ's preposterous claim of having 450m Chinese
using them...

You might be right or wrong, I'm not gonna argue about it. Even though I don't short NQ, I have some
negative feelings towards NQ and maybe its CEO. However, I Baidu's this phrase in Chinese and the latest
article about NQ I see was made in 2013 October.  
Another argument. Regardless of the recent awards NQ received, do you really think that a big company like

Sprint would have signed any agreement had they thought NQ was a fraud? 
But dont get me wrong, I also feel that something is wrong with the company!

Again, if you've been doing business internationally you'd realise how little people do in terms of commercial
diligence and how easy it is to fool people from another country.


I mean, CAT blew half a billion on a ChiCam in the construction industry...and they bought the company. That
was acquisition diligence and CAT got fooled in the construction industry.


This joke with Sprint is just a commercial contract...I can tell you Sprint did ZERO real diligence with respect
to NQ...

hyeduk,


I used to follow a company called WorldGate Communications (OTC:WGAT) for entertainment (their Yahoo
M.B. was a riot). They pimped a video phone that actually did work well for over a decade, announced deals
with British Telecom, Telecom New Zealand, Telecoms in Russia, Israel and other places I can't remember, a
deal with a video relay service that gets compensated by the government at over $5/ minute to provide
services to the deaf population and finally an major MLM called ACN that specialized in selling video phones.
Total revenues for the entire history of pimping the phone amounted to a few million dollars before the
company filed for chapter 7 (as I predicted they would). Signing "deals" with legit companies doesn't mean
they amount to anything. How much could cell phone wall paper actually be worth?

Milkweed,  
Yeah, that's true but it's hard to compare Sprint with some Telecoms in Russia, but I see what you are saying.

ShinRyanJ,


For some reason I even think that Muddy Waters cooperates with some people at NQ. There are so many
shortsellers try to scare NQ longs. Why? If they know for a fact that NQ is a fraud and the company will file for
bankruptcy, why would not they just stay quietly and buy put options or short the stock. The more they scare
investors, the less attractive/valuable put options become.

I think there is something else going on. Both NQ and MQ will make money and in the end, when put options
expire we will see the audit a week later.


15 May 2014, 11:45 PM


johnbladdy
IMHO, this article's author intentionally states non-fact as fact which caused tens of millions loss of NQ market cap
today. The letter from Office of FOIA Services SEC  
does not imply any investigation against NQ. Anybody can call the Office's number on 2nd page of the letter the link
given in this article pointing to to easily confirm 
the non-fact fact. I called earlier today as stated in my earlier comment. According to Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), one can request access to information but 
552(b) 7(A) is one exemption to FOIA. There could be other exemptions as stated 
in the letter. In terms of this exemption, the Office refused to disclose the request  
for disclosing information about NQ. But is it really an investigation going on agaist NQ? Another paragrah clearly
states the Office does not confirm a request of the kind. But coming to this article, its summary's first bullet saying  
.Official SEC FOIA document provides evidence NQ faces ongoing law enforcement investigation


The author intentionally distorted the letter from the Office in this article and led to 
the tens of millions loss in NQ's market cap. I certainly question the author's integrity. Also if NQ takes any legal
action, I will not be surprised.

I don't find credibility in someone with 6 articles that are short articles. Your first post was within a couple months. No
track record. And why do you have a black box covering who that letter addressed? Again... If it was an official
document from FOIC there WOULD NOT BE A BLACK BOX COVERING THE ADDRESSED
COMPANY/INDIVIDUAL... regardless of the outcome this is a poor article


14 May 2014, 10:41 PM


jsIRA, Marketplace Contributor
The Summary of the article gave the impression that the stock is going to be halted and may lose 80% of its value
after trading resumes if it will.


This will certainly create some panic among NQ's small investors.


In order to make money, there are all kinds of authors in SA. I felt sad, really sad.

Stock isn't really down because of this article though. Stock is down because NQ gave themselves a magical May 15

While the day is not over but not good that they did not file before market opens.


$7.46 rtq, Able to buy 3K at $7.70 (correction, limit order was $7.72 but executed at $7.70) and hope to get
$3K more at $7.12.


Now I have 14K shares and may go negative if shares fall to $1.

SivBum -


I must admire your NQ tenacity but I must laugh at your foolishness.


How many times can NQ use the "I need more time excuse"?


Let's see...


Previously they said they were working on the audit and need more time, right around March and right after they didn't
file when they normally file.


You longs said it was because Chinese New Year and they needed more time.


Then when the real deadline of April 30 came, they said no fraud but we can't file on time. No reason given. But they
only applied for 15-days.


Now 15-days later, company says still no audit and we need more time.


Now is NQ that dumb? Didn't they realise they needed more than 15-days? The millions they are paying their
advisors - didn't these guys tell NQ - hey, give yourself more time?


No. They only asked for the extra 15-days. Now they can deliver on time (again). Stock crashes.

I would not be accumulating if I were sitting on a pile of losses. It is house money.


With that said, agree with you that NQ IR should be fired ... I said so before.


Lastly, I had always argued about market value of NQ that $25 was nose bleed region and at the same time
all the fraud charges by Muddy Waters were untrue or minor. Shares will not go to zero. I had been in the
market too long and seen how most of them played out. May be going private is the only way out for NQ and
the big institution holders (MS in particular) now. With shares battered down to $7ish, they could walk away
with a $10 offer and pocketed the cash.

Cash Man, Contributor
"I would not be accumulating if I were sitting on a pile of losses. It is house money"


How is house money any different real money? Either way you are throwing your capital away. Capital is
capital PERIOD. You should be basing your investment decisions on what provides you with the greatest
return on a risk adjusted basis at the time. This is a classic mistake that many investors make and has
actually been pretty well studied by the behavioral finance community. See link for what I'm talking about.

Dude, you're trades are pretty amateur. Keep living the NQ dream. Maybe you should consider switching to
Sprint and start using NQ Live and NQ wallpapers in order to enhance that NQ dream...

shih,


Of course my trades are amateur ... I am an amateur. So, please explain to me why buying shares at $7.72
(darn, I meant $7.70 though my order was limit at $7.72) and sold them at $8 was a dream or mirage?

House money means that I can afford to lose every penny. No doubt I rather not give up the penny but I had
seen similar fraud allegations too often, 6 wrong calls in a row for Muddy, I think it is a good side bet to hold
NQ. In hind sight, I should have shorted NQ at $27 and Carson Block would be richer than Bill Gates.

Update to you on my trade. As said, I bought another 3K at $7.25 limit yesterday near closing. A few minutes
ago, I sold them at $7.55 ... another amateur trade but that's how I have doing on volatile stocks under a dark
cloud.

seriously?


16 May 2014, 09:19 AM

Not bragging about it but thought you think amateur does not make money.


FYI, bought again at $6.72 and dumped at $7.08 just now. Like I said, love the volatility.

users who have wallpaper on their phones have their own chosen images anyway? When you run a NYSE company,

trading halt at any day.


Few recent example:


CCCL - trading halt since May 1 due because it failed to submit 20f


LIWA - halted since May 1 the same reason.


NQ - NEXT?

I read that article yesterday but I did not give any comment.


ADMP gained 50% in one month. But under current market environment, it is very difficult for development
stage biotech stocks to make runs.


Basically I am now only buying selected biotech stocks having at least one selling drug with accelerated
revenue growth.


For development stage biotech stocks: I only do short term trading not do buy-and-hold type of investment.


I do hope to find another JAZZ type of stock which can give investors 100-bagger return in few years. JAZZ is
a 3,000-bagger stock moved from 0.55 to 180 in four years. One potential stock HZNP I bought last August at
2.16 and it ran to as high as 18 in 6 months and now at 12. Hope to see it making further runs in coming
years. I have few others.


NQ - I was long on NQ previously but changed my stand after company failed to file 20f for the second time. I
will only do day trading on NQ now and will not hold it overnight as this stock can be halted at any day if SEC
treats it like other Chinese ADRs such as LIWA, CCCL, etc.

What do you guys think about these reports I just found.... 
Here are 2 auditor reports from 2 yrs prior- Is there anything wrong with them? 
To Board of Directors and Shareholders of NQ Mobile Inc.  
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
comprehensive income, shareholders’ (deficit)/equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of NQ Mobile Inc. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and, 2011, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management’s annual report on internal
control over financial reporting appearing in Item 15 of this Form 20F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits which
was an integrated audit in 2012. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217603-nq-mobile-current-law-enforcement-investigation-now-added-to-fraud-allegations-amidst-delayed-audited-financials


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.


As described in management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting, management has excluded
Beijing NationSky Network Technology Co., Ltd. (“NationSky”), Beijing Feiliu Jiutian Technology Co., Ltd. (“Beijing
Feiliu”) and Beijing Red Infinity Technology Co., Ltd.(“Beijing Red”), from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business
combinations during 2012. We have also excluded NationSky, Beijing Feiliu and Beijing Red from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. NationSky is a majority-owned and Beijing Feiliu and Beijing Red are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Company whose total assets and net revenue represent 8% and 14% respectively, of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012.
