Cytori Is A Compelling Short Sale Opportunity
Mar. 19, 2012 9:43 AM ET18 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


The book value of Cytori (NASDAQ:CYTX) common stock is $0.18 per share as of Q4
2011, and I project it will be close to zero at the end of Q1 2012.


Unfortunately for Cytori shareholders, book value approximates what I believe is fair value
of the equity. What should one pay for a business that, on average, loses 7 million every
quarter for the last 4 years on 2 million in revenue? I don't believe Cytori is a pipeline
"story", so I would submit that these shares are worthless. And yes, we are short the
stock.


Cytori likes to think they're a leader in regenerative medicine. I have a few issues with this.


First, regenerative medicine is a meaningless and embarrassing buzzword that means
nothing. Medicine is medicine, and the goal of any therapy is to increase the patient's well-
being while limiting adverse events. Using cells as a therapy is not a new idea, so using
the word "regenerative" is both redundant and unnecessary. Actual leaders in the cell
therapy field, like Baxter or Grifols, trade at pedestrian valuations, and while they are
exploring exciting new treatments in diverse areas, there are muted expectations due to
the limited (so far) applicability of cell replacement technology in most diseases. My
second issue with Cytori is their focus on cardiovascular stem cell therapies is particularly
limiting when one's goal is to be a leader. The Baxter IVIG Alzheimer's trial is the most
anticipated stem cell, or "regenerative medicine" study. There are limited expectations for
cardiovascular disease and Mesoblast and Baxter are far ahead of Cytori. It's hard to lead
when you're so far behind.


Autologous adipose (fat) cell therapy is Cytori's strategy. The concept is simple: fat
contains stem cells. Take the fat from a patient and centrifuge and filter to the point where
it is pure in stem cells. Take this solution and administer it to the site of action where the
patient might need stem cells. This all sort of makes sense, but there are a number of fatal
flaws. The first is there no evidence to suggest it works. Despite some diehard faith from
Cytori investors and seemingly, management, there is limited clinical proof of concept for
Cytori's approach. This is why revenue has been flat for 4 years with no hope of growth
(including company guidance). The world is generally skeptical that something as complex
as a myocardial infarction can be changed by an autologous transplant. Indeed, it is clear
that these autologous therapies don't work by differentiation, but instead by a paracrine

nature. The company is finally doing some slightly larger double-blind studies, so perhaps
we will see something definitive at some point. However, I am skeptical - I will analyze the
trials in detail shortly. My sense is the company would be better off pursuing a Baxter-like
"RENEW" study, where that company is studying 450 patients to see a definitive result.
Cytori tends to beat around the bush and forget that medicine requires hard evidence
before widespread use begins. All of the off-label salepeople in the world won't help
Cytori. If they did a real, large study with definitive results, the stock would either +1000%
or -50%. It appears Cytori is more content generating meager sales, substantial losses
and rapidly rising share count. I believe management had a plan of benefitting from being
associated with this growing field, and it backfired.


The Cytori "ATHENA" study is their first US study, and will enroll a meager n=45 patients.
Perhaps they are hoping to replicate the miraculous and "too good to be true" Mesoblast
results. They certainly took great care to use the same investigator. The MACE at 12
month primary endpoint will lead to a lack of definitive data for at least a year. The study
hasn't even started enrolling, so maybe we'll see data in late 2013 or early 2014. They'll
be well out of money by then, and there is only a very small chance that with n=45 sample
size the company will hit a home run. The Baxter and Mesoblast large Phase IIIs will be
done by then!


"ADVANCE" is a bit of a real study with n=360. Unfortunately, I suspect it will take all of
2012 to enroll this study, and probably some of 2013. Reduction in infarct size at 6 months
is the primary endpoint, and I bet this is a meaningless endpoint. Something like MACE or
mortality and hospitalization would be a more suitable endpoint given this patient
population. Again, Baxter and Mesoblast are "going for the gold" with real clinical
outcomes endpoints. Infarct size is not exactly a real goal in the world of cardiovascular
medicine, where you are trying to keep the patient alive.


As mentioned in the beginning of the article, Cytori is in poor financial condition. In just
another quarter, June 30th, I project Cytori will have an "upside down" balance sheet with
negative shareholder equity. For a company that lacks any coming definitive data or any
projection of increasing sales, I am surprised to see the value of the company where it is. I
bet the stock will get cut in half in the next 6 or 12 months. It's a worthy short.


With that said, let's quickly recap all of the picks I've put on Seeking Alpha. Please note I
do not put borrow costs for my shorts as they generally will not greatly influence my
returns. Even if the average APR for a borrow is 50%, I generally do not stay in shorts for
a year or pay 50% interest. With all of this said, I am closing my recommendations to short
Oncothyreon (ONTY), MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) and Human Genome (HGSI). Please

understand I still think these stocks will go down, but I have high IRR hurdles and the
risk/reward at these levels is worth moving on from. I believe longs are making terrible
mistakes holding these shares.


With 10/11 correct stock picks, I hope I have been useful to you "home gamers". The
average and median return of my stock ideas has been 32% and 38%. The time-weighted
IRR return has averaged 240% with a median of 87%. If you don't carefully think about
how time impacts your returns on investment, you are missing the whole point of growing
your funds (investing, trading, whatever you call it). A 10% return in a stock in one month
is usually much better than a double in one year (ceteris paribus).

What if the company runs out of money and goes into BR? Then the BR trustee would sell the company's assets.
Based on promising recent studies there would probably be other biotech companies that would be willing to buy all of
Cytx patents and technologies for a couple hundred million out of bankruptcy. That's 3.5 a share right there.

Let's assume Cytx runs out of money. Then what it goes to bankruptcy court. Then the BR trustee sells off the assets.
Based on the newly released study there surely would be several biotech companies interested in buying the assets
(patents and technologies) for a couple hundred million. That's 3.50 a share right there.

If they're in such poor financial condition, why'd the CFO just drop $25,000 of his own money on shares when it was
at 2.54 on March 14.

CYTX is a pretty dangerous stock to be short of. It is very volatile, with a history of swings between around $2 and
around $8. The downswings generally come from an absence of news - investors just getting fed up waiting - and
happen gradually. The upswings come on news and are sudden. It's a recipe for shorts to be closed out by their
broker at a loss. You might say it's a good broker's stock, but not a good customer's stock.


They are burning cash and might run out, yes, but the science is good and they might make it big time.


Disclosure: I am long CYTX. I have been in and out over the last couple of years and have recently got back in.

Mr. Shkreli has disclosed a short position and shows bias. Here are the facts:


Cytori is currently the market leader in adipose derived regenerative medicine based on number of ADRC trials
completed (including the 71 patient Restore 2 trial results announced today – all trials have been positive), patents
held or pending (over 100), and most patients treated (over 4000 in Japan and the EU).


Baxter is primarily a medical device company with limited regen effort. They trade at a “pedestrian” price because
they are in slow growth markets. Baxter is investing in regenerative medicine no doubt because they see it as a high
growth market, which it is. Baxter, and most of the big device and Pharma companies do not yet have successful
regen technology – all are potential partners with or buyers of Cytori.


With a $6 million quarterly burn last Q Cytori has 18 months of cash on its books without entering into any strategic
partner relationship. Cytori’s latest Q show sales were up both year over year and sequentially.


The author did not mention the most meaningful news; the pending approval of Cytori’s Celution technology for
helping “no-option” chronic myocardial ischemia patients. Cytori’s Apollo trial results show significant improvements
and their technology offers huge cost savings to this very large market. The sad truth is many of these patients simply
have no option without Cytori’s technology and they would pay dearly to realize a better quality of life and a longer
expected life. If the EU approves this anytime in the near future, as expected, it will be a game changer. Objective
short sellers may want to consider these issues.

Actually, in dozens of studies over the past twenty years, thousands of patients have already been treated with stem
and progenitor cells derived from adipose tissue and bone marrow, across a variety of conditions including heart
failure, with very positive outcomes. The majority of these studies were carried out at research centers and
universities around the world independently of Cytori. The treatments themselves are proven to work, and there is
plenty of good data in the literature to explain why. Cytori is just one of the first companies to come up a viable model
for the commercialization of autologous stem cell treatments. That aside, I would be very cautious shorting this stock.
The upside is too great and there are too many potential positive catalysts.

Wall Street Titan, Marketplace Contributor
For those who are reading this article yet haven't closely followed Cytori, the author failed to disclose an important
potential catalyst. The company is on the verge of hearing the results of a decision on its European application to treat
no option chronic myocardial ischemia (CMI). Approval would mark the first time in history that any form of
regenerative cell based therapy has been approved to treat coronary disease.


In my opinion, this event will be a watershed event that no short seller will be able to discredit. Think about what it
means. European approval will mark the first regulatory approval where the body's own cells have been harnessed to
regenerate the heart and bring back functionality, something thought impossible just a decade ago.


Heart related medical care is the biggest medical market in the world. If and when this approval comes (its expected
in the first half of 2012 but there are NEVER any guarantees), the market will likely begin to recognize the value of
Cytori's IP protected platform, as will potential partners with deep pockets.


So if you are short Cytori or are considering such, please be advised that you may be playing with fire. I've written
several articles here on Seeking Alpha about Cytori that readers may want to review in order to put this article in its
proper context. Always do your own due diligence.

I'm sorry, but I have difficulty with your decision to cover MNKD. If you are willing to short a stock worth 12 cents
surely you would find a way to stay short a 2.00 stock that you say has more down side.  
When will you send the FDA a letter stating you have had a change of heart? When the stock doubles, triples, trades
to 10x your long cost? 
I do have to say I admire your self published Wikipedia bio. You showed restraint and stuck to the facts.

Not sure why someone would enjoy making money shorting stocks when it's easier and safer to make money in them
going long, and probably more helpful to the businesses as well, but I think there is a need to go against the "herd"
and prove oneself right (contrarian). I also think it may be more helpful to the businesses to buy rather than sell their
stock as it helps them raise money (secondaries, etc), but every market needs a buyer and a seller, so no harm no
foul.


That is not a slight by any means. Part of me wants to try and understand why short-sellers receive so much hostility.
Whatever makes you legal money in this business is a win in my book. So while I may not necessarily agree with your
ideas and style, I have to say congrats.

Folks shorting RegMed Stocks is like betting against humanity. If Cellular Therapies do not replace the current
healthcare model it will bankrupt the USA by 2027. Try shorting garbage mining stocks, green energy stocks and
similar.

Fun reading stuff from 2011. Especially your side bar comments.


"I will never make this much return this quickly again." I see that you instead have..


"I expected more out of this but c'est la vie." Great exit actually (and short).


"The best short in the world, period." It's finally melting. And faster than brown fat on the hood of a pick-up truck in the
Texas sun in July.


Wonder what your thoughts on CYTX now, are after a good week ?


Good luck with the other "stuff."
