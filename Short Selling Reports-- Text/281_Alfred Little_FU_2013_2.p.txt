FAB Universal: Management Caught Red-Handed Covering Up Piracy
Nov. 19, 2013 1:36 PM ET27 comments
by: Alfred Little


On Monday, November 18th, 2013, my investigators caught FAB Universal's
(NYSEMKT:FU) Chinese management in the act as they attempted a full-scale cover-up of
the pirated U.S. movies on FAB's kiosks. In today's report, I present "before" and "after"
videos of FAB's Beijing kiosks documenting the removal of the pirated U.S. movies. My
investigators interviewed FAB's kiosk operators and discovered that FAB was removing all
of the pirated U.S. movies over anti-piracy concerns after FAB's "copyright licenses had
expired." What a convenient coincidence!


Where did all the $0.13 Pirated U.S. Recently Released Movies Go?


Prior to the publication of my report, FAB's Beijing kiosks were loaded with pirated recently
released U.S. movies. On November 6th, 2013, my investigators filmed this video
recording of all of the movies available for download from FAB's 5C Intelligent Media kiosk
at its Dong Fang Yin Zuo (Oriental Ginza Mall) location (东直门外大街48号东方银座商场3
层). The following sample screen-shots highlight a selection of over 50 pirated U.S.
movies FAB offered on this kiosk prior to the publication of my report:

Good-Bye Pirated U.S. Movies, Hello Breakdancing!


On Monday, November 18th, 2013, my investigator returned to visit the FAB Beijing Hui
Long Guan Wan Yi department store kiosk and discovered that FAB management had
deleted all the pirated U.S. movies as well as many of the Chinese movies. The staff
explained that due to anti-piracy concerns in China, FAB had recently removed all the U.S.
movies from its kiosks, claiming that FAB's "copyright licenses had expired." What a
convenient coincidence: FAB's U.S. film distribution rights expired simultaneous with
publication of my report!


On Tuesday, November 19th, 2013, my investigator returned to visit the Dong Fang kiosk
and found that FAB had similarly removed all of the pirated U.S. movies and many of the
Chinese movies. A video recording of the revised list of movies available for download
from the kiosk can be seen here. The video clearly shows the complete removal of all the
U.S. movies (as well as UK and Canadian movies). The following screen-shots from the
video show the complete removal of all the pirated movies which were replaced with old
Chinese, yoga, and instructional dance videos. In the absence of pirated copies of cool
movies like Iron Man, Man of Steel, and Skyfall, will FAB customers and franchisees really
want to continue spending millions of dollars on FAB's kiosk business model?

I challenged FAB in my November 14th, 2013 report to publish the complete addresses of
all of its approximately 4,000 purported kiosks in Beijing so that investors and researchers
could independently confirm their existence. FAB has failed to provide this list.


FAB management has now been caught, red-handed, conducting a full-scale cover-up of
its pirated movie business. Without pirated content FAB's $0.13 per movie download
franchised kiosk business will collapse. Thousands of franchisees will soon be demanding
their "guaranteed minimum" return on investment. This scheme will soon implode.


Disclosure: I am short FU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Great research, Jon! I think Jim Rogers can better sell his shares now and leave the Board of Directors. His own

This stock seems to defy gravity. How does a company that has reports about it pirating its products and hiding debt
issuance not sell off more?

Fund algos running around making $ off price swings, baiting people into believing the co stock price will
stabilize back to norm. Buy large amounts of stock in a short period, buy puts for protection and move the
stock price up. Sell stock slowly and ride the puts for more profit. Explains the volume b/c retail won't
generate that much volume.

wow, the way you write this makes it sound like you are a full fledged investigative reporter which you are not. FAB is
in the process of gathering all the slander and will be pursuing you to the full extent of the law. you will be held
accountable.

Hmmm it'd be a libel suit. Slander is spoken. Good luck on that though. The slam dunk defense to both is
speaking/writing truthfully. Not a hard standard to bear in this case.

Great investigation but unfortunately I have a bunch invested in FU. As soon as I bought my shares the damn stock
tanked. As pissed as I am it's also fantastic that there are companies out there finding the fraudulent companies and
bringing them to the public.

I am of the mind to take the wait and see what the real investigations come up with. I just cannot believe everything
AL has reported. No one can away with as much as AL has reported.

perhaps English and grammar is where you should focus...mister 2 comments...I find any articles that purport
an opinion of a stock are often derided by commenter's of an opposite view.....that have fewer than 20
comments....hmmmm...they all show up out of the woodwork


19 Nov 2013, 08:55 PM


H_H
Who do we believe? Short sellers or the management?


It's more of an issue of on-going process. Fraud is a too heavy words even for real piracy in the US. Unless the
Chinese authority decides to investigate FU's operations, which they probably will never, there is as much credibility
from your "investigators" as anyone else in the US.


This is a game of fantasy - you cannot prove without doubt that you didn't make it up, as a short seller.

I think FU shareholders will be thankful to AL's work, whether it was credible or not.


It serves to remind the management to be very careful as a public company, and thus be prepared to take action on
any issues.


I think this seemingly negative report will have real positive effect in the long run.

The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) just issued a "Model Shadow Stock Portfolio Update:
Emergency Sale of FAB Universal Corp. (FU)" AAII referred back to the 11/14/13 article & promised an update in their
January 2014 AAII Journal


They closed with: "We are selling FAB Universal (FU) on an emergency basis. While there is still a lot of debate about
the company, it is clear that, at the very least, the data used in the decision to buy the company was flawed and, at
worst, there may be extensive fraud."

NQ BS, LLEN BS, FU BS and the list goes on and on!  
Someone should force the decision makers in all US exchanges to ban once and for all Chinese listings. That kind of
garbage can trade anywhere else (Hong Kong would be most appropriate). Let the Chinese defraud their own people.
I believe that these occasional revelations of fraud are just the tip of the iceberg. So, before our invincible Titanic sinks
in deep cold waters, let us remove the whole iceberg from our own ocean.  
There will be a (mainly political) price to pay. However, in certain quarters, the benefits will outweigh the losses.

I really would like to hear what Jim Rogers has to say about this as an insider. He also lives in Singapore and is very
familiar with Chinese companies. Only time will tell who is right.

Jim R was probably deceived. Considering the guy's wealth levels, his rep is worth more than the proceeds of
investing and supporting this small cap co. Then again, how many wealthy people get caught pinching
pennies and hiring illegal household help....


21 Nov 2013, 11:55 AM


Lucky?
It's one independent kiosk. Who cares? If I owned one of those in China I'd take a shot at piracy, too? This should be
a positive for FAB's management, as once informed FAB pulled the plug on the guy. 
As for A.L. holding this until zero, he's gong to have a long wait. FAB has been around for a over a decade and has
never been in a better position.

Author’s reply »  One Kiosk? Every kiosk my investigators visited were carrying roughly the same playlist of pirated
movies.


21 Nov 2013, 06:20 PM


Lucky?
If that's the case, then you should be happy FAB is being proactive and is taking the pirated movies down. 
Why is that bad? It's what FAB said they did when they found pirated movies on their sites. 
Didn't you just visit two sites?

FAB has yet to respond to any allegations yet, it will be interesting to hear their side of the story. 
At the C.C. they stated they added about 2K kiosks per quarter on their way to 200K.


22 Nov 2013, 04:31 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Adding 2000 kiosks per quarter? laughable. Over the course of a two week search, my
investigators could only find 5 operating FAB locations in Beijing. Four of the 5 FAB locations each only had 1
kiosk. The 5th location is the SoShow superstore, which had 16 kiosks (to impress investors, no doubt).
