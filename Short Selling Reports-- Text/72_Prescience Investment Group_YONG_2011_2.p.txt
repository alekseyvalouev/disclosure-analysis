Yongye International: Further Evidence Calls For Regulator Scrutiny
Dec. 16, 2011 5:38 AM ET45 comments
by: Prescience Investment Group


Investors and analysts have for the past year or so have hurled accusations of fraud at
Yongye International, Inc. (NASDAQ: YONG). Its seemingly too good to be true business
model appears riddled with related party transactions and the acquisition of assets of
dubious quality from those related parties for tens of millions of dollars. In this analysis, we
present further evidence of Yongye playing fast and loose with the facts as it seeks to
present a bullish case to investors and evade auditor scrutiny. Specifically, we believe
Yongye is overstating its raw material costs by at least 50x in an effort to manage the
margins it reports on an inflated top line.


We urge the NASDAQ, the SEC, and KPMG to closely examine the evidence put forth in
the public domain in their efforts to protect public shareholders and defend the integrity of
our financial markets. (Our initial analysis can be found here.)


Yongye claims that humic acid – the supposed key ingredient of the company’s
Shengmingsu fertilizer – makes up a great part of its costs. In its response letter to an
SEC inquiry, Yongye stated (question 7), that “Humic acid accounts for over 50% of our
cost of goods sold and is derived from lignite coal. We believe that our gross margin will
show incremental improvement if we start to use our own coal in the future.”


Our research reveals that its response to the Securities and Exchange Commission is
implausible and, further, that its investment in a coal mine is not likely to produce the gross
margin improvements that the company is touting.


According to Yongye’s most recent 10-K, in 2010, the company’s cost of sales was
$94,833,834 and it sold 18,800 tons of Shengmingsu, implying an average cost of
$5,044/ton per Shengmingsu (Shengmingsu made up 97% of sales in 2010). According to
Yongye’s response to the SEC inquiry, of this amount more than half, ~$2,500/ton of
Shengminsgsu, is due to humic acid costs.


This is impossible; Yongye’s statements to the SEC simply do not add up with claims
made in its own fertilizer license filed in China and market realities. Humic and fulvic acid
(i.e. water-soluble humic acid) can be sourced for well under $1,000/metric ton (examples
here, here, here, and here). According to Yongye's own fertilizer license (here and here),
each ton of Shengmingsu requires 50 kilograms of humic acid. Thus, a ton of humic acid
is sufficient to produce roughly 20 tons of Shengmingsu.

Comments (45)


In other words, assuming Yongye pays at the upper threshold of market prices for its
primary raw material, it pays $1000/ton. Each ton of raw material is sufficient to produce
20 tons of Shengmingsu according to Yongye’s patents, so based on market prices humic
acid costs the company no more than ~$50/ton of Shengmingsu.


Yongye claims in its SEC response to spend $2,500/ton of Shengminsu on humic
acid, seemingly exaggerating its cost by at least 50x. There are a number of
reasons why Yongye may choose to inflate its costs:


Margins would otherwise look high beyond any realm of reality, especially in
light of what we believe may be revenues inflated on the basis of sales made to
related parties.
Since the purchases flow through Wuchuan Shuntong (which it has been
alleged, and we believe likely, is a related party), the cash may be getting
‘recycled’ (i.e. laundered).
KPMG, Yongye’s auditor since 2009, would surely be asking questions about the
absence of cash in Yongye’s bank accounts


In summary, we find various parts of Yongye’s response to the SEC’s questions wholly
inadequate and in this case misleading. We strongly believe the Company is playing fast
and loose with the facts as it seeks to present a bullish case to investors, and we have
great doubts regarding Yongye’s customers, its purported revenues and reported profits.


Based on a business model riddled with inconsistencies, we believe Yongye International
has historically served as a conduit for transferring wealth from outside investors into the
pockets of company affiliates. We again urge the NASDAQ, the SEC, and KPMG to take a
look at Yongye’s largest customers and suppliers and to examine the many allegations
made by others – including the ones here, here, here, here and here – in an effort to
protect the public interest and defend the integrity of US financial markets.

RTN
Only regulatory scutiny should be by both FINRA and SEC into how short sellers try to facilitate their own trades by
spreading innuendo , conjecture and misleading stattements.


Also interesting hoiw morgan stanley's invesment of 2.4 million COMMON shares is so easily overlooked.


Owh.. and KPMG..., we cannot trust their accountant reports since they could possibly maybe possibly maybe
perhaps possibly mistakes.


Ye sure....... honest comments .... i leave that to each reader to decide for themselves.

Congrats Eiad, your the first hit writer to say a company doesn't report enough profit.


16 Dec 2011, 08:09 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
@kingfrogcash: Can you name at least one company in the agricultural sector in the world that has 75%
gross margin? Because using the author's assumtptions, YONG's gross margin is 75% on (about) 99%-fake
revenues.


16 Dec 2011, 11:08 AM


kingfrogcash
The author of this hit piece said the costs were lower. And YONG overstated the cost. Talk to the author!


16 Dec 2011, 11:27 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
@kingfrogcash: The article I read says that the revenues were fake and the costs were lower - which is
obvious - why would fake revenues cost anything to generate?

So here's the deal--YONG's options expire today; 2 hit pieces from the same short seller this week, most probably so
he can dump his $4 puts. These hit pieces usually show up right at options expiration. A good buying opportunity for
those who can see through it.

Wow, when I clicked on this link, I legitimately thought it was going to be an article asking the SEC to investigate
Prescience Investment Group for their tactics. This is the just the opposite, crazy!


Sorry you've taken a short position on a company that's already been taken through the grinder time and time again,
has already satisfied the SEC when they came asking questions this year, and has yet to have any of the wild claims
stick. Rehashing the same claims aren't going to make them true.


YONG has already gone point by point through your claims here


http://yhoo.it/uRD4iL


and here


http://bit.ly/vZUDxQ


to provide the clarifications after the author intentionally did not contact the company for a response to any of their
(quote) investigation (unquote). Anyone reading should make their own judgment, but personally, I prefer to go with
the facts rather than wild claims


(here come the part where where they claim that their unsubstantiated claims are "the facts")...let's see


16 Dec 2011, 09:16 AM


mekong22
this is my favorite


"Yongye claims in its SEC response to spend $2,500/ton of Shengminsu on humic acid, seemingly exaggerating its
cost by at least 50x. There are a number of reasons why Yongye may choose to inflate its costs"


So first you claimed that they couldn't possibly be as profitable as they are...and now you're saying their costs should
be much less therefore they should be much MORE profitable than they are. Which of your contradictory claims are
you going to make tomorrow?


Also, if anyone really thought there was reason for a regulator to investigate...they would contact the regulator. The
only reason to publish an article on seeking alpha asking a regulator to investigate a company is because you want
the general public to believe there is an issue that you can't convince a regulator about.


The timing of this article with potential tax loss selling is certainly not a coincidence either. Someone wants to cover
their short position...badly


16 Dec 2011, 09:26 AM


GenghisKhan
Not only tax loss selling, but also op-ex in a month with no particular catalysts that might drive it up.

@mekong22: I don't see a contradiction. I see fake revenues and fake costs. The costs are artificially high in
order to facilitate smooth money-laundering through the related-party supplier.

Richard X Roe, Contributor
@mekong22: Now is your chance to show I have bad memory. Please remind us all here about what you

you waiting for?


YONG is a complete fraud. That is a fact that won't change even when YONG is halted and then delisted.


16 Dec 2011, 04:10 PM


mekong22
that post typifies that you don't understand the meaning of the word "prove". By your line of thinking in your
previous post, anything that cannot be disproved, has been proven. I know some folks who would have a field
day with that one.


I'm not surprised that you don't know the meaning of the word given how many times you've stated that
unsubstantiated rumors "prove" negative things about one company or another.


Here's yet another example of you changing your story three times

(and now YONG's CFO himself) that is contradicting YONG's CFO (yeah, he is contradicting himself!).


If the two new non-Shengmingsu "brands" belong to YONG rather than to Yongye Group, then the CFO lied
(as he claimed that YONG develops and sells only Shengmingsu products, while all the other brands belong
to Yongye Group). Period.


The new brands have exactly the same chemical composition as the Shengmingsu's crop (or plant, or
whatever) product, but obviously the bottles are twice as big and the labels' colors are different. Period.


The Shengmingsu trademark does not belong to YONG, but to Yongye Group (that is, Mr. Wu), contrary to
YONG's SEC filings. Period.


Since you have failed to show that I changed in my "story" three times, you are now a proven liar. And that is
no rumor. Now, why would proven liars defend complete frauds like YONG? I wonder.

paulson dumped sinoforest as soon as the fraud report came out. 
Morgan Stanley invested in yong AFTER the "reports" came out.


VERY big difference. 
When MS said they did "extensive due diligence" this was obviously in response to the "reports" that came
out before their investment- they realized the "reports" were completely false so they made their 50 million
investment.


Not only that, afterward when yong stock started falling again they purchased ANOTHER 10 million in stock,
this time on the open market

The company already said they can reduce costs by running their own coal mines. They are only guilty for paying too
much for their raw product. Thanks for proving their investment will have a great pay off. 
Maybe Morgan Stanley figured out what you did on costs and that's why they invested in YONG.


16 Dec 2011, 10:43 AM

@kingfrogcash: YONG has no coal mines. YONG is guilty of paying itself (because both the customers and

@kingfrogcash: The author did say it in his previous article: two related-party customers and a non-existent

operate or build any mine. Did you listen to the last earnings call at all?


16 Dec 2011, 06:15 PM


EriKarju
Dear Eiad, 
a little bit of chemistry from Wikipedia:


Humic substances in soils and sediments can be divided into three main fractions: humic acids, fulvic acids, and
humin. The humic and fulvic acids are extracted as a colloidal sol from soil and other solid phase sources into a
strongly basic aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Humic acids are precipitated from this
solution by adjusting the pH to 1 with hydrochloric acid, leaving the fulvic acids in solution. This is the operational
distinction between humic and fulvic acids.


http://bit.ly/tR57m5


And from Yongye prospectus:


This process, generally described, is as follows:


1. Humic Acid is mixed with water and sodium hydroxide to form a solution.


2. The Humic Acid is precipitated as a solid while maintaining the solubilized Fulvic Acid in solution.


3. The solid Humic Acid and the solubilized Fulvic acid are separated.


4. The Fulvic Acid Compound is then mixed with special nutrients for its plant and animal product lines.


http://bit.ly/t0GibX


Point being: Yongye uses fulvic acid obtained from step 2 above i.e portion soluble only into highly acidic liquid. This
is also known as low molecular weight fulvic acid. It is this portion that produces one metric ton of Shengmingsu per
50 kg in standard 5 % solution. . All your price quotes are for rather impure water soluble humic/fulvic acid mixes.


16 Dec 2011, 01:03 PM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
@EriKarju: A little reading comprehension lesson for you, before you start giving chemistry lessons form Wiki:


50%-80%-concentrated fulvic acid sells for about $500-$800/ton in China (Or do you dispute that?)


Now, tell us, what does YONG's plant nutrient product contain, exactly, per its government license? The
article provides a link to the answer: the license shows 20% NPK, 10% microelements (Mn, Zn, B, Mo), and
5% humic acid. The rest, 65%, seems to consist of some quite impure stuff and water. Or do you disagree?
So for each 5 grams of pure humic acid (water-soluble or not) in the product, there are 65 grams of crap and
water. You call that pure fulvic acid?

Richard, 
take a look at the pH number displayed (if it is) with price quote. Consistently over 6 which is quite different
from pH 1.0 required with Yongye's process. The prices you and Eiad are quoting are for cheap alkaline mix
of high molecular weight and low molecular weight humic/fulvic acids. And most of the time, not even acidic
mix.


Take look:


http://bit.ly/s3gu6F


now find me a price quote for pH 1.0 water soluble fulvic acid, please.

Richard X Roe, Contributor

New Investor25
Richard,


The link you provided is for SOLUBLE fulvic. Is this comparable to what YONG purchases? I assume it is not.
Please don't leave out these details. Please compare apples to apples. I am trying to understand this
discussion but if details are left out it is an unfair comparison.


19 Dec 2011, 06:15 AM


Richard X Roe, Contributor
@New Investor25: Good question! Here are the details:


1) YONG's government license (linked by the author) shows that YONG's product contains 5% humic acid
and is soluble in water. 
2) YONG claimed to have bought humic acid (not fulvic acid) in 2010 as a raw material. This year, it claims to
be using coal instead of humic acid as input. 
3) Fulvic acid is (supposedly) water-soluble humic acid.


Insoluble fulvic acid is an oxymoron. And so is an "investment" in YONG. YONG is a complete fraud.


Do you now understand the discussion?

I feel sorry for anyone who owns a small-cap, U.S.-listed Chinese stock. These individuals can't seem to comprehend
that they are not protected by U.S. securities rules and regulations. The SEC (as incompetent as they may be) has
absolutely no ability to protect investors from deceit stemming from China.

Here is a great link of a study done with the fertilizer. It's great stuff and has been highlighted in China with award
winning farmers. http://bit.ly/tfznuV... a few quick facts as well.


--Yongye's solution uses concentrated fulvic acid that is made principally from humic acid. So it does tack quite a bit of
humic acid to make their solution. So their cost is not out of line. Because they are using a large amount of humic acid
to come up with their solution.


--The solution they sell needs to be diluted by 500 to 1. So this argument is not valid. It's a good question but not a
firm accusation to make. Yongye also answers this question on their site in their IR section under FAQ. Case closed.
http://bit.ly/vZUDxQ


Now let the stock go up to the $8-$15 range it belongs.


Here is a link around an award that Yong won with a farmer that is using it’s product.

-Great Competitive advantages and sales.

Richard X Roe, Contributor
@Buygoodlow: Your first link points to nowhere. I think you wanted it to point to the parlor trick by the crook
Tim Hanson of Motley Fool, who is prominently featured in YONG's latest book.


YONG's patent shows that 1) YONG contains a heavily-diluted fulvic acid (5%) and 2) YONG does not make
any fulvic acid from any humic acid. YONG's government license, on the other hand, does not even mention
fulvic acid, but just humic acid (5%).


YONG indeed recommends that its product is further diluted. As a result, the concentration of humic acid in
the final solution is 0.01% (or essentially zero). Regardless, humic acid and fulvic acids are simply inert
materials - they do nothing.


The "award" that you linked to was given to Yongye by a fair organizer who has been paid by Yongye for
seven consecutive years.


YONG is a complete fraud.

I believe Yongye is a complete fraud and check up on the stock every once in a while to see if it has zeroed out yet.
The fact that it is growing earnings at 100% annually and has a p/e ratio of 5 tells me it is a complete fraud. If it was
legit the owner would have found a way to take it private or private equity would have bought it by now. None of the
insiders ever buy stock, even at its currently ridiculously cheap price. What more evidence do you need that it is a
fraud?

Hmmmm.... $3 million open purchase by CEO not good enough I guess.

@GenghisKhan: The CEO stole about $100 million, so 3% of $100 million is not good enough - you guessed
it right.

Considering the market price of humic acid and that there is only 50 grams of humic acid per liter of Shengmingsu,
why is the humic acid percentage cost of Shengmingsu so high according to the content data on the Shengmingsu
product description?


Shengmingsu is a high-end crop nutrient. Yongye utilizes high-quality raw materials and a proprietary manufacturing
processes to ensure product efficacy. Price quotes of humic acid from small online vendors and pricing ratio of
50g/liter, significantly underestimate the actual cost of humic acid per ton of Shengmingsu for several reasons, a)
Yongye only uses top-quality humic acid for the Company’s manufacturing, which incurs higher costs; b) Yongye uses
a significant amount of humic acid to extract a small amount of high-grade fulvic acid through proprietary processes;
c) the 50g/liter ratio actually applies to Yongye’s high-grade fulvic acid (water soluble humic acid) content for the
Shengmingsu product, instead of humic acid; and d) Shengmingsu’s minimum fulvic acid content requirement is

ajj53: According to Yongye's patent, Yongye doesn't utilize any high-quality raw materials in its crop nutrient.
And, of course, the latest 10K says that Yongye doesn't use ANY humic acid in its manufacturing today, just
low-quality coal.


Now, the real neat thing is that once you find out the grams of fulvic acid per liter (or whatever) in Yongye's
ANIMAL product, then you will have a proof that Yongye is a complete fraud and that the latest 10K is entirely
fraudulent. So, what % of Yongye's animal product is fulvic acid?
