China BAK Battery Inc.
(CBAK) – Hard To Believe
That CBAK’s Shares Still
Trading After Exaggerated
Claims
July 29, 2014 By GeoTeam


CBAK made false and misleading statements in its July
28, 2014 press release;
We hope that the NASDAQ will not take CBAK
management’s statements lightly;
The company has still not addressed the fact that it
just lost its primary revenue-generating asset to
foreclosure.


For 3 years, firms like GeoInvesting have been exposing
misrepresentations made by U.S. listed China-based
companies that have stolen billions of dollars from U.S.
investors.  Regardless of this fact, it looks like China-based
management teams still show no fear  that U.S. exchanges
will quickly call their bluff even after making outrageously
false claims to investors.  Maybe they feel untouchable
since regulators have been unable to meaningfully punish
the players involved in deceitful actions. Who knows? But
one thing is for certain: Investors keep getting hurt by the
Exchanges’ delayed actions against patently false and
misleading press releases.


This brings us to CBAK.  We were shocked by the obviously
false statements management made in yesterday
morning’s press release, causing shares to rise around
15%.

CBAK Blatantly Misrepresents Itself In Its July 28,
2014 Press Release


On July 28, 2014, China BAK Battery, Inc. (CBAK)
published its first press release in over a  year; one that
appeared to contain highly misleading false statements
that far surpassed the usual hype and hyperbole of most
“pump-style” press releases.  This comes on the heels of
two negative articles published last week that questioned
CBAK’s viability after the Company lost its primary
operating assets (CBAK International Limited) to
foreclosure.

Bring China BAK Battery’s Solvency And Viability Into
Question

China BAK Battery


Rather than address the issues raised, not the least of
which is the company’s ability to generate revenues and
cash flows from operations, management instead
announced a “cooperation agreement” with the Dalian
Institute of Chemical Physics of Chinese Academy of
Sciences.


The false claims in the press release are so obvious that
anyone who reviewed CBAK’s recent SEC filings could
immediately spot them:


CBAK claimed to be, “the world’s leading lithium
battery manufacturer and electric energy
solution provider.” This is a silly claim.  The
company is currently scrambling to build a new
production facility after having lost is primary
operating assets to foreclosure.  As far as anyone can
determine CBAK has no current ability to generate
revenues or cash flows from operations and has

creditors breathing down its neck.  Yet management
claims they are THE WORLD LEADER? Even before
the foreclosure, at $185 million in reported
revenues for 2013 with a $116M loss, can CBAK
really be “the world leader?”  Please provide
evidence that you are indeed the world leader. 
 
Please provide evidence that you are “the
world’s leading lithium battery manufacturer
and electric energy solution provider.”
Further, the release claims, “CBAK possesses China’s
first production base specially engaged in power
battery…” Really?  CBAK disclosed that its only
operating facilities were lost in foreclosure.  Its Dalian
facility is under construction.  So how does CBAK
currently “possess” any production base?
The release also includes a picture/drawing of a
seemingly fully constructed facility when in fact our
on-the-ground due diligence established that CBAK’s
new production facility in Dalian is still under
construction with no assurance that it will be
completed on a timely basis. In fact, the company
admits the project is still under construction.  We view
the picture in the press release as a deceitful move
management has taken to pump its stock.
Management should actually address the capital
needed to complete the construction of its Dalian
facility, its working capital and overall current capital
position.
The Company touts its, “strategic cooperation
agreement with Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics of
Chinese Academy of Sciences (“DICP”). Under the
agreement, the two parties “will jointly research and
develop the next-generation key technologies and
materials in power battery with an aim to produce
the most powerful battery worldwide.”  Those are
lofty goals for a company that currently has no
operations and appears to be in dire need of capital.

Conclusion


We find it remarkable that management did not take the
opportunity to address the grave issues facing CBAK.  After
having lost its primary operating assets to foreclosure
there have been no statements from management
regarding the Company’s plan of operations or how it will
fend off creditors and survive to fund construction of the
new manufacturing facility or working capital for
production.  We believe that management is simply skirting
the most important issues facing CBAK while
misrepresenting the business to attract investors.


We view the press release as an outlandish attempt to
pump the stock that mimics the tactics promoters use to
tout defunct pump and dump penny stocks here in the U.S.


We would hope and expect that NASDAQ sees these claims
and acts in the interest of U.S. investors.
