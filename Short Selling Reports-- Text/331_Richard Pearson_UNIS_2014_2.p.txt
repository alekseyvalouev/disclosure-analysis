Behind The Scenes With Proactive, Inovio And Unilife

by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Proactive Capital is an IR firm that was listed as a partner of The Dream Team
Group.


No disclosure of payments has been made.


Dozens of additional articles have been and are being removed from identified paid
authors on various stocks.


(Editor's Note: The ProActive Group has been in contact with the author and Seeking
Alpha and several changes have been made to this article, specifically regarding the
contract and the stated relationship with Dream Team. You can read the full rebuttal here.)


Note #1: Prior to publishing this article, the author filed detailed complaints with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the parties and activities described
herein.


Note #2: Due to the large volume of documentation obtained by the author, only a small
portion is included in this article. However, the author has made efforts to ensure that the
SEC and Seeking Alpha are aware of all findings, including those not detailed in this
article.


Note #3: Many of the suspect articles referred to below have already been removed by
Seeking Alpha. This can be seen by scrolling through Yahoo Finance, where the
headlines still remain. However, the author had previously preserved electronic copies
wherever possible in order facilitate ongoing investigation of the authors involved.


Investment overview


Following my recent article describing undisclosed stock promotions at CytRx Corp.
(NASDAQ:CYTR) and Galena (GALE), using controversial IR firm The Dream Team
Group these stocks have quickly fallen by 20-30%. Shares of InterCloud (OTCPK:ICLD)
next fell by 30% on Friday following class action lawsuits and from concerns regarding

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 2/76


paid promotions there by Dream Team writers Tom Meyer and John Mylant. The issues at
InterCloud were also uncovered in the wake of my last article. All of these stocks are now
down by at least 50% from their recent promotional highs.


I have now identified clear indications of undisclosed promotions on both Inovio
Pharmaceuticals (NYSEMKT:INO) and Unilife Corp. (NASDAQ:UNIS), using IR firm the
Proactive Group. Proactive has been listed as a partner of The Dream Team Group on
that firm's website.


(Proactive responded after publication of this article that the firm denies any relationship
with Dream Team, that they were unaware that their logo appeared on that site and that
they have made efforts to have their insignia removed from that site.)


In both cases, the promotions took place in conjunction with the release of news and
boosted the stock. In some cases, various recent articles have consisted of nothing more
than interviews in which management answered convenient questions with positive
answers. In other cases, heavy quotes from management were also numerous.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 3/76


As part of my investigation, I have obtained a copy of the contract for one of the paid
writers. I have also obtained various emails from multiple authors in which they confirm
their involvement in paid undisclosed writing, including for companies listed as Proactive
clients, and including on both Inovio and Unilife.


All the stocks mentioned so far have several things in common: They have minimal
investment from institutions and are overwhelmingly held by retail investors who can be
easily influenced by paid promotions.


They also happen to have little or no commercial revenues and rely on grants or
collaborations.


They are heavily dependent upon promotions to retail investors in order to move the stock.


In multiple cases, we can see selling activity in their stock (either by insiders or the
company itself) just after the promotions hit their peaks.


As with CytRx and Galena, I expect the share prices of Inovio and Unilife to be subject to
very steep declines due to a) the end of the artificial promotion following exposure and b)
the potential for legal consequence from the paid promotions. Due to their recent spikes to
multi-year highs on the back of these promotions, I see around 40-50% downside in each
of these stocks. Yet even this level of decline would simply put each of these stocks back
to levels where they were within the past 6-12 months. This is just what we have seen with
CytRx and Galena in recent weeks.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 4/76


Note: Inovio management has stated to me in an email that, aside from The Life Sciences
Report, they do not sponsor anyone who posts articles on Seeking Alpha and that they
feel the content of various articles is strictly "editorial" and not paid for.


However, Proactive Capital confirmed separately that Inovio is still a current client. Their
full quotes are listed in Appendix I at the end of this article.


Latest developments


Two weeks ago, I focused on exposing undisclosed paid promotions being run by "The
Dream Team Group" on stocks including CytRx Corp. and Galena Biopharma.


Note: For full disclosure, I have temporarily covered my short position in CytRx, which is
now down by more than 50% from its recent highs. However, I may re-initiate a short
position at CytRx at any time going forward.


As I released my findings on the Dream Team Group, the result was that over 100 articles
on various media sites had to be removed from circulation due to their connections to that
IR firm.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Proactive, Inovio And Unilife - Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSEMKT:INO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 5/76


This week, I switch my focus to the Proactive Group, an IR firm in New York that appears
to be running undisclosed paid promotions on Inovio and Unilife, as well as many other
companies. We can see from the information presented below that the authors that I have
identified as being paid authors have written extensively on Inovio and Unilife and in some
cases have displayed identifiable patterns. Emails and other documentary materials
further support this.


Once again, clicking through the links on Yahoo Finance shows that dozens of additional
articles are now being removed due to connections to undisclosed paid promotions. I
strongly suspect that the number of articles being removed will increase dramatically in
coming days and weeks as more information comes to light.


Exposing the promotions


During this investigation, the way I obtained my information was as follows: First, Tom
Meyer contacted me asking me to write articles on companies being paid by the Dream
Team. Next, I spoke extensively with Tom to find out the names of the companies, which
were paying him. But I also made it a point to ask him about other authors, other IR firms
and other listed companies that were involved in the promotions. Wherever possible, I
made sure to get this information captured in emails.


But I was still not satisfied by speaking only to Tom. Once Tom gave me the names of the
other authors and IR firms, I began contacting those parties to ask if they would be
interested in writing articles for pay or interested in paying me to write articles for them.
Again, I made every effort to confirm this via email.


For example, Mr. Meyer pointed me to Matthew Charles Fox. Mr. Fox is a college student
who has written 46 articles on Seeking Alpha in the past 9 months. I did contact Mr. Fox
and asked him about his paid writing. He did confirm via email that he gets paid $300 per
article and sent me a link to his most recent paid article on Midwest Energy Emissions
Corp. (OTCQB:MEEC) which was a client of Dream Team.


Mr. Fox describes Dream Team's payment process for his Midwest article as follows:


They pay $300 for that. If article is not published on SA they pay $80, and article has
to be OK'd by the company beforehand.


Note: At least 9 of Mr. Fox's articles have now been deleted from Seeking Alpha.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 6/76


It is also noteworthy that Mr. Fox has taken a unique interest in Plug Power
(NASDAQ:PLUG) having written 8 hyper bullish articles in just a few months, just as the
money losing company sold stock in an equity offering.


In his latest article, he had noted that he was "setting the facts straight" and rebuts Citron
Research's Andrew Left by saying:


Left's exclusion of Plug Power's recent positive developments and a sensational
price target enabled the manipulation of share price in favor of his short position.


Citron was certainly short and no doubt was talking his own book, but it is somewhat ironic
that Mr. Fox would take such a high road. In my correspondence with him, his only
concern about violating federal securities laws was whether or not he would get caught in
taking $300 per article. He stated in a separate email:


How do I know your not a SA editor trying to lure me into this and then I'll just get
banned? Haha, i'm just kind of paranoid regarding getting found out on SA.


I don't see much need to weigh in on the debate between Citron and Fox regarding Plug.
Plug Power has surged in price but still sells its product at less than the cost to even
manufacture each unit (negative GROSS margins). This has been consistent for years
and shows no sign of changing this year. The spark, which ignited the stock was a huge
upswing in sentiment by retail investors, which was driven largely by a surge in articles
like those from Mr. Fox, in conjunction with announcements from the company.


Over the long term, investors can make their own decision as to the long-term viability of
Plug Power. I ended up getting short Plug Power based on the spike on Tuesday, and I
am now looking much more deeply into what is moving the stock and the involvement of
various authors.


Below are 7 of the 8 Fox articles, the ones that I tracked:

Sitting At An Inflection Point, Plug Power Offers Patient Investors More Than 100%
Upside


Even after getting confirmation about Fox and other authors, I still wasn't satisfied. So my
research continued. As I talked to each of these new parties, I would again ask for further
references to even more authors, other IR firms and other listed companies. I also asked
them to send me specific examples of articles that they had paid for.


For example, Tom Meyer told me that he was paying John Mylant to write on Galena and
other stocks. John was a prolific author who had written over 800 articles on Seeking
Alpha and TheStreet.com. John then confirmed his paid activity in emails to me. John also
introduced me to another IR firm he does work for, called CSIR. I then wrote to CSIR who
confirmed via email that:


We've commissioned a few articles on ICLD already that you will find on Seeking
Alpha and Wall Street Cheat Sheet…. I can set up a call with CEO if we need to. If
you want to write it, after you write, we would first send a draft to CEO for review
and then have you publish. We pay $500 to you upon publication. That's per article.


The articles on InterCloud had been written by Mr. Meyer and Mr. Mylant, both of whom
were working for multiple IR firms besides the Dream Team, such as CSIR.


And from the following email, we can now see the overlap between Dream Team and
CSIR. Ms. Ayot from CSIR noted that:


I'm trying to get something done on SNGX ASAP... Tomorrow? My original writer had
an emergency come up. If you can pull this off, I could bump your fee too $600. Let
me know if you think it's possible.


SNGX refers to Soligenix and is also featured prominently on the Proactive client page,
not far beneath Unilife and Inovio.


As with all of the other articles, my excuse was that I was "unable" to publish anything on
Soligenix in time for Ms. Ayot's deadline. But she was OK with this, saying:


So for the moment SNGX is taken care of, but good for you to be familiar with the
company because we do articles on them every few weeks.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Proactive, Inovio And Unilife - Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSEMKT:INO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 8/76


Note: Seeking Alpha is now aware of all of these issues and the articles in question on
InterCloud and Soligenix have been removed. I have also filed detailed complaints with
the SEC relating to the activities with various companies and individuals involved.


This is a point that is worth emphasizing: once I identified an author as being paid, I often
found that they were eager to work for multiple IR firms covering multiple companies.
Likewise, there were a number of listed companies who made use of multiple IR firms at
the same time.


My ultimate goal therefore became to simply to identify who was on the take, without
caring as much about which companies or IR firms they were working for on any given
day. Either they are involved in paid promos or they are not, and this is valuable
information.


By using this method, I was quickly able to gain indications of paid writing from numerous
authors, as follows:


Tech Guru


Tech Guru is a former analyst from Morgan Stanley. In his own words, he has written paid
articles "extensively" on Inovio for Jeff Ramson, the founder of Proactive. His most recent
article on Inovio was in February, just in time for him to give a $5.00 upside target just
before Inovio issued $63 million of new shares. He has also written four bullish articles on
Unilife, including most recently on March 13th. Unilife is also a Proactive client.


Note: Many of the companies listed in this article make use of multiple IR firms with each
IR firm serving a different purpose. Unless specifically noted otherwise, I am limiting my
comments below to the involvement of the firm noted.


Note: Tech Guru's articles on Inovio and Unilife have recently been pulled from Seeking
Alpha. But in comparing this screenshot to the list of Proactive clients, we can see that
nearly every recent article has been for a Proactive client. This includes: Unilife, Inovio,
Volition Rx, NeoStem, Agenus, Actinium and more. These articles have also been
removed from Seeking Alpha.


The red boxes below show which Proactive clients Tech Guru has written on. It should be
noted that many of the remaining Proactive clients are simply smaller and less liquid
bulletin board stocks.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 9/76


I approached Tech Guru with the notion of him writing various articles for me on certain
companies, including Inovio and Unilife. Tech Guru was unwilling to write on either Inovio
or Unilife for anyone other than Proactive because of the following (see email link):


As discussed on the phone, there are certain companies which I would not be
comfortable writing up for various reasons, either due to longstanding relationship
with them from the other client, or others. The ones I mentioned are INO and
UNIS for reasons discussed.


The "reasons discussed" were that he already had a relationship with these companies
through Proactive such that if he wrote it for me it would create problems with Proactive.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 10/76


When I asked him specifically about writing up Inovio in articles for me, he said that it
would be:


Problematic in that I have written on it extensively before…for Jeff


"Jeff" refers to Jeff Ramson, the founder of Proactive.


As for the logistics, Tech Guru let me know that he gets paid via wire transfer and does fill
out a W9 tax form for the IR firms. As a result, confirming my findings should be fairly
straightforward using that documentation.


Yes, I send an invoice each month and I get paid by wire. I am a 1099 so yes W9
would work.


For those who are curious about the mechanics of the relationship, Tech Guru also
provided me a copy of his contract, with the name of the IR firm removed.


(Note that while this contract was provided to me by Tech Guru as an example of the type
of contracts he uses, Proactive has subsequently provided me with an original copy of the
contract executed between it and Tech Guru. The contract does not require Tech Guru to
post articles on any company they cover. Proactive also denies having paid anyone to
write articles, and says that they have since severed all ties with Tech Guru. Proactive
requested that I not post the entire contract here, but gave me permission to use my
judgment.)


Tech Guru has also clearly indicated that he does paid writing for LifeSci Advisors. I am
still assembling further findings on LifeSci.


Tech Guru has written a total of 55 articles on Seeking Alpha covering 26 companies.
Among these, 22 of the companies happen to be clients of either Proactive, LifeSci, or
both. Not surprisingly Tech Guru was also one of the authors writing on the much pumped
Soligenix above, which is also featured on the Proactive client page.


Soligenix is the company, which CSIR pays to have written "every few weeks."


The writing pattern can be best illustrated in the following table, which also includes his
disclosure for these articles, showing that he doesn't disclose any compensation or
business relationships.

5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Proactive, Inovio And Unilife - Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSEMKT:INO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 11/76


Tom Meyer was the individual from Dream Team who was responsible for recruiting and
paying the writers. Tom first pointed Tech Guru out to me as a great paid writer, but one
who charged too much money ($800). Tom also gave me Tech Guru's personal email
address, so it was clear that they had been acquainted.


Tech Guru was a key asset for Proactive. For example, in winning over NeoStem Inc.
(NBS) as a client, Tech Guru tells me that Proactive had him attend their Nasdaq bell
ringing ceremony last August.


The message from Tech Guru was clear: if NeoStem retained Proactive, then Tech Guru
would write on them to boost their stock. Following that ceremony, Tech Guru did write on
NeoStem twice and NeoStem is now listed as a Proactive client on their website.


Note: Proactive client NeoStem was also a favorite topic for fellow authors Stock Whisper
and Bio Insights who will be described below. These authors also showed interest in
Inovio and Unilife as well.


The key point to observe is that multiple anonymous authors all seem to be writing about
the same small group of stocks during the exact same period of time, including ones
where we can easily identify a paid promotion.


Tom Meyer had also cited NeoStem as a great paying company, which he hoped to win as
a client for Dream Team. The point is that NeoStem appears to be a blatant stock
promotion and many of these authors appear to have been active in writing on it.


In the same email from Tech Guru, he maps out (in CAPS) his compensation of $4,000-
5000 per month for 4-5 articles per month and notes that he has been operating as a paid
writer for about a year. This would encompass the entire time he has been posting on
Seeking Alpha and basically the entire time since his employment ended at Morgan
Stanley.


Through my discussions with Tech Guru, I do have his real name, his full contact details
and his employment history via FINRA broker check. But since he uses an alias online, I
have chosen to only release those details to Seeking Alpha and the SEC, which they can
then verify on their own. In the emails shown, he is only referred to by his first name.


Tech Guru was often reluctant to put many details about company relationships in emails,
especially when the information he was sharing blatantly contradicted the views
expressed in his written articles. For example, with Unilife, he made it clear that CEO Alan
Shortall was a "liar," "a criminal" and a "scumbag." This stands in stark contrast to what he
had written in his Unilife articles, rebutting shorts who have often been critical of the CEO.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 12/76


In fact, Tech Guru was very uncomfortable writing on Unilife because he said that CEO
Shortall was putting increasing pressure on the writers to write new articles every week
and he wanted ever more grandiose statements such as comparisons between Unilife and
Apple Computer. This indicates strong involvement from management, just as has been
indicated by the other IR firms, CSIR and Dream Team.


Again, Tech Guru had written on Unilife 4 times, most recently on March 13th.


But as stated before, ultimately Tech Guru said that he would not be able to write paid
articles for me on either Inovio or Unilife because he had an exclusive arrangement with
Jeff Ramson at Proactive on these companies and that this would create a conflict with his
work for Proactive.


Note: All of Tech Guru's articles on Inovio and Unilife have since been removed from
Seeking Alpha.


Stock Whisper/Equity Flux


Another writer identified to me by Tom Meyer was Stock Whisper. But Tom wasn't too fond
of Stock Whisper because he was from some foreign country and often had grammatical
mistakes in his articles.


I did contact Stock Whisper and confirmed that he comes from Stockholm, Sweden and
that he does get paid to write articles, charging a rate of $500-600 per article. In addition,
Stock Whisper confirmed that he also writes under the name of Equity Flux. The
description of Equity Flux on Seeking Alpha is "Equity Flux offers its clients financial
consultancy services." But it does not specify the nature of the services or the clients.


Via email, Stock Whisper informed me that he writes "all technology and biotechnology
articles" for Equity Flux. This would include his articles on Galena (a Dream Team client)
as well as his writing on Inovio, which is listed on the Proactive website as a Proactive
client.


He also appears to have an account with Motley Fool where he writes under the name
Mohsin Saeed where he has written on Galena, a Dream Team stock. Again, most of
these paid writers tend to be quite mercenary and they will work for any IR firm that pays
them a few hundred dollars.


We can see that since November, Stock Whisper and Equity Flux wrote on Inovio 3 times,
It also happens that this was almost immediately before the company conducted its equity
offering right as the stock was hitting a 7-year high.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 13/76


Stock Whisper also wrote on Unilife just 2 weeks before its S8 was filed, allowing insiders
to sell up to $12 million in stock.


I never did get Stock Whisper's real name. But in terms of identification, I did make sure to
confirm the email address, which Stock Whisper uses for PayPal. As a result, there is a
clear paper trail for establishing payments.


Note: The articles from Stock Whisper on Inovio and Unilife have been removed from
Seeking Alpha.


Bio Insights


One last paid author, which Tom identified to me specifically, was Bio Insights, who has
written over 400 articles on Seeking Alpha alone. Clearly it is the case that many of these
articles will have nothing to do with any paid promotion. This is the same thing we saw
with John Mylant, a confirmed author for Dream Team who had written over 800 articles
on at least 3 sites including Seeking Alpha, TheStreet.com and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
Tom also gave me the real name of Bio Insights, which I have confirmed. But since he
posts under an alias, I have not shared his real name here.


The pattern of his articles is noteworthy. It includes a large overlap with Tech Guru and
Stock Whisper, at nearly the same times, on Proactive clients including Unilife, Inovio,
Thermogenesis, NeoStem, Soligenix, and others.


In November, there were a series of short articles released by various authors questioning
many aspects of Unilife's business and management. Prior to this, Bio Insights had never
weighed in on the stock. He quickly wrote two rebuttals to the Unilife shorts within a few
days time and predicted that the share price would double. Since that time he has not
spoken again about Unilife despite considerable developments and movement in the
share price.


Likewise he has also written two positive articles on Inovio. My concerns with Bio Insights
are as follows: First, he was identified to me as a paid writer by Tom Meyer. Second, he
has written a large number of articles on Proactive/Dream Team clients. For example, he
wrote on CytRx at the early part of that promotion in October. Third, there is a very
obvious overlap between the articles of Bio Insights and Tech Guru and other identified
paid writers. Fourth, the articles all appeared within the promotion window for these stocks

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 14/76


Bio Insights does run a series of independent websites that post articles on biotech
stocks. One of his sites has in the past picked up and syndicated several of my Seeking
Alpha articles, all of which were short pieces.


Looking at additional authors


As shown above, there are multiple authors who have demonstrated a strong interest in
these companies at the exact same time, which also happened to coincide with
financings. It is also clear that Tech Guru has written on 26 companies, of which 22
happen to be clients of either Proactive or LifeSci. I submit that 22 out of 26 indicates a
strong pattern.


Stock Whisper, also named by Tom Meyer as a paid writer for Dream Team, has written at
least 16 articles, which appear to have been for identified paying IR firms, including on
both Inovio and Unilife. This includes articles under his own banner as well as under
Equity Flux.


From these facts, it becomes apparent that both Inovio and Unilife look like the subjects of
paid promotions. Next, we can take a look for broader patterns with other authors to see if
there is any reason for further attention. For example, with the Dream Team, it became
easier for me to spot Tom Meyer's many aliases because they were consistently the ones
writing heavily on Galena and CytRx. A similar analysis of Inovio and Unilife is instructive.


This does not mean that I have a "smoking gun." It just indicates the patterns I am looking
for, as I did with CytRx and Galena. As a result, I will not call out any authors by name.


I look for authors who:


Write on the same companies that I believe are being promoted
Write during the same time frame as the identified promotion period
Write with more than normal frequency on the promoted company
Write excessively favorable analyses


Here is what jumps out at me from doing this analysis:


Two additional authors


Author #1 is noteworthy for engaging in what I refer to as the "gratuitous CEO interview."
Of 10 articles published by this author, 4 were bullish articles on Inovio while one was a
bullish article on Dream Team client Galena.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 15/76


It was Tech Guru who helped me better understand the wisdom of using multiple IR firms.
He noted that:


its been my experience that when there are 2 firms on the same company they do
very different things. for instance one firm like a mission IR for example would do
promotional stuff- interviews, videos, syndication, whereas another one like
Proactive or LifeSci Advisors to use those examples, would be the ones doing
the seeking alpha articles, setting up road shows, and being more strategic in
general. I work for the latter type of firms. I've never seen a case where there is
direct overlap among firms doing the same thing, for the same client.


In fact, we can see Inovio CEO Dr. J. Joseph Kim is a big fan of this type of interview.


He recently appeared on a local podcast called "Money Matters" hosted by two retail
brokers from Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo. The fact that the hosts had precisely zero
prior knowledge of Inovio should be obvious from the beginning, when host David Ebner
shows he doesn't even know that name of the company, pronouncing it "In-vivo". The
show is a privately produced low-budget way to provide executives with interviews and
brokers a shot at some publicity, which they can then post on YouTube. It is similar to the
old public "cable access" shows, which get free airtime in off hours on cable TV.


It is worth observing that this local show is hosted by these brokers in Philadelphia, just
about 20 miles from Inovio's headquarters. The questions and answers were all basically
in line with the 4 recent interviews given to Dr. Kim by Seeking Alpha authors. For those
who wish to see a textbook example of the gratuitous PR interview, the "interview" on
Money Matters is a must view podcast.


What I look for in this type of interview is whether they are objective interviews or if they
read like company driven press releases that simply disseminate management's spin. The
timing of the interviews is also noteworthy, in relation to the capital raise.


A closer read of recent interviews shows that the questions and answers are so
transparent and gratuitous that management should have simply put out a press release
or put out Q&A on its website. Instead they participated in a gratuitous interview with an
anonymous author.


Tech Guru has made it clear that he is being paid to write on Inovio by Proactive. He also
explained to me the tactic being used, the gratuitous interview. Within a 4-week period, we
can see multiple gratuitous interviews, just as the company was raising cash and allowing

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 16/76


the company to communicate press release-like views to trumpet and justify their actions.


Author #2


A separate author also felt the need to give a personal interview to CEO Dr. Kim just
before the capital raise.


That author had demonstrated a wide focus on various stocks in various industries,
typically writing 1-2 articles on 17 companies. Only when it comes to 2 companies listed
on the Proactive website does he write with much frequency, writing 12 times on the two
companies (5 on Inovio). In both cases, the strong positive views come despite the fact
that both companies lack meaningful commercial revenues and have already risen
dramatically.


Again, I am not in possession of a "smoking gun" email confirmation on either of these last
two authors. I am simply observing the obvious patterns that I am now following as I look
further into this, including the use of gratuitous interviews. This is a topic on which I hope
to elaborate further going forward.


Looking back to the framework for this type of analysis, we can see these authors wrote
on the promoted stock, during the promoted period, with greater than usual frequency and
with exceedingly favorable analysis. That is my only point.


Stock promotion: objectives and tactics


Lately, I am realizing that many people completely misunderstand the objectives and
tactics of these stock promotions. The objective of publishing paid articles is definitely not
to cause dramatic one day spikes in the share price. Such spikes seldom last very long
and they also attract too much unwanted attention.


The goal of these issuer compensated promotions is to create a sustained groundswell in
investor enthusiasm. This attracts longer-term money and provides a gradual and
sustained rise in the share price that will ideally last long enough for the company to sell
large amounts of stock.


Christina Ayot from CSIR made this clear when she said:


Love to talk further about some of the companies I work with, compensation, etc...
Curious to know what sites you write for. Many of my clients are looking for
diversity.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 17/76


Likewise, Tom Meyer encouraged me to use aliases in addition to my real name so that
extra breadth could be created in the groundswell.


You mentioned earlier you were going to get a name at WSCS. Let me know if you
need any help with that. Also, I'd recommend getting a name other than Rick
Pearson. You're already Rick Pearson at Seeking and The Street so its good to
branch out.


The goal of these promotions is ultimately to attract institutions who will buy into an equity
offering. I have seen many retail investors make the point that these institutions are
unlikely to make their investment decisions based on small time independent blog articles.
As a result of this, it is assumed that institutional investors should not be able to cast any
blame on the promotion. This is wrong.


The text of the promotional articles may not really matter that much to the institutions. But
what the articles really achieve is a mobilization of retail money, which elevates the share
price to an unnatural level. When institutions buy in (even at a discount), they are buying
in to an artificially inflated stock which has been propped up by a retail oriented promotion.
When the promotion falters, the stock should be expected to fall sharply.


This is exactly what we saw with CytRx. The promotional articles along with concurrent
news releases took the stock from around $2.00 to as high as $8.35 in just a matter of
weeks. CytRx then sold over $80 million in stock at $6.50. As the promotion faltered (and
even before my last article), the stock was already down by nearly 25% following the
offering. Institutions have every right to feel that they were duped based on nothing more
than the prevailing artificial price level. CytRx is now down by more than 50% since hitting
its artificial promotion highs of over $8.00.


What should you be looking for?


I have observed and written about many similar stock promotions over the past year. And
in the past I have even explicitly expressed concerns about Tech Guru, well before this
article. I would encourage readers to go back and read those articles.


One obvious tactic to look for is a surge in articles just before a needed financing. Often
times these are "orphan" articles from "orphan" authors. By this I mean the sudden
appearance of a seemingly experienced author who has never written about any other
company before. After the article is out, the author disappears and never writes about
another company again.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 18/76


With Unilife, we can see the sudden appearance of multiple orphans just weeks before the
S8 was filed.


With Inovio, we can see the opposite pattern. This is a surge in repeat articles from the
same authors who suddenly feel compelled to write very frequently despite adding little
new content.


For example, on Inovio, a small group published on one small cap, pre commercial
biotech company 14 times. None of their articles had a dramatic effect individually.


But the collective effect, along with company news and data releases helped get Inovio to
a multi year high of $3.95. For much of 2013, Inovio had traded below $1.00. The spike in
price was just in time for the company to raise money that it said it previously didn't need.


Don't be fooled if an author has many non-paid posts. For example, John Mylant (who I
exposed in my last article as a Dream Team writer) had written over 800 articles on SA
and numerous articles on TheStreet. Most of his paid content appears to have begun in
2013, but was camouflaged by the large number of articles on large cap stocks.


A deeper look at Proactive Capital


Proactive Capital is an IR firm located in New York. A screen shot of its client list can be
found here. As shown on the website for the Dream Team Group (a.k.a. Mission IR),
Proactive is listed as a partner of Dream Team in the IR business.


As shown before, the following table shows that of the 26 companies on which Tech Guru
has written, 22 are clients of Proactive or LifeSci. Tech Guru does not disclose payment in
any of his articles, but he has made it clear to me in email and by phone that he gets paid
to write on Proactive clients. Emails demonstrating this were included above the Tech
Guru section.


Many readers would have never spotted any of this until it was pointed out. But when
viewed in this format it becomes too obvious too ignore.


Proactive was founded by Jeff Ramson in 2008. It appears that getting into the IR
business was Mr. Ramson's obvious solution after being forced out of the brokerage
business due to a long stream of severe regulatory violations.


Prior to this IR business, Mr. Ramson founded and ran a brokerage called Great Eastern
Securities. This is a link to the FINRA Broker Check report for Great Eastern. Starting on
page 13 we can see more than 20 pages of violations and disclosure events resulting in

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 19/76


millions of dollars in penalties for Mr. Ramson and Great Eastern.


These include fraudulent activity, churning, lack of registration by brokers, failure to report
customer complaints and retroactively changing commission rates to inflate charges to
customers by hundreds of thousands of dollars.


By 2006, Mr. Ramson had been personally barred from associating with any NASD
member. Great Eastern's broker-dealer registration was then revoked in 2007. Mr.
Ramson's ability to earn a living in the brokerage world was over.


So in 2008, he founded Proactive Capital, the IR firm which is responsible for generating
positive press for Inovio, Unilife and around 20 other small cap, retail oriented speculative
companies.


Mr. Ramson's background in the dark side of the brokerage world may give him some
unique capabilities with respect to his IR clients. Tech Guru has stated quite clearly by
phone that


Proactive is very good at, especially situations where you want to galvanize trading
volume…when you need to shake out some small clients who are holding the stock.
They're very good at literally systematically getting the volume up.


All I know is that a lot of their clients tend to be companies that don't trade that
much, and then all the sudden after they're done with them they start trading. So I
assume he is doing something along those lines.


It is certainly noticeable that volume on Inovio and Unilife has picked up dramatically over
the past year, during the time in which these writers were focused on the company.
Despite having de minimis commercial revenues and institutional ownership of just 8%,
Inovio has been trading around $30-40 million nearly every day lately. That's a staggering
amount for a stock that traded at 60-70 cents less than a year ago.


What about the fundamentals for the stocks?


When I previously wrote about CytRx and Galena, I made it a point to note that I was
mostly ignoring the case for the companies' fundamentals, including the near-term
prospects for their drugs. Several sell side analysts have come out since then and have
been bullish on the prospects for CytRx and Galena in clinical trials.


Despite this, the stocks continue to fall further, hitting new lows for the year. The question
is: Why are investors rushing for the exits and ignoring the fundamentals?



http://moxreports.com/wp-content/uploads/z-001-Ramson-Broker-Check.pdf
5/22/2018 Behind The Scenes With Proactive, Inovio And Unilife - Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSEMKT:INO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 20/76


The answer is simple, and it is something that I pointed out in my last article.


First, to the extent that these companies have been involved in undisclosed promotions
just in time to sell / issue large amounts of stock, it calls into question many of the bull
case assumptions, which have been made regarding the stock - including the drugs'
prospects in clinical trials. Obviously, this remains to be seen.


Second, there is the legal risk of class action lawsuits and SEC actions, which is much
more near term than the companies' revenue prospects. These are the concerns that have
already become apparent at CytRx and Galena.


Third, to the extent that money has been raised via equity offerings during the promotions,
there is the legal risk that the company will not be able to keep this money in the event of
lawsuits from investors who feel they were duped. Again, this remains to be seen.


Fourth, the simple end of the promotion means that the steroid-like boost to the share
price will be highly likely to fade. I believe that this is a near certainty.


I fully expect sell-side analysts on the stocks mentioned above to maintain very bullish
outlooks on the stocks listed in the article, just as they have done on CytRx and Galena. I
also fully expect the share prices to fall despite the obvious support from these analysts.
In most cases, the analyst views are very hypothetical and express what the stock
"should" be worth if management has been 100% forthcoming in their statements. But the
reality may be sharply different than the theory, especially due to potential legal fallout.


Conclusion


I hope that my methodology has been obvious in this article. I am only short 3 stocks in
this article, yet I have deliberately gone out of my way to show the detailed
interrelationships among the various authors, IR firms and listed companies. It is a goal of
mine to continue to get more information out to the public, irrespective of any stocks in
which I have a position.


Prior to publication of this article, the information contained herein (and considerably
more) had already been shared with the SEC. It has also been shared with Seeking Alpha
in hopes that it will be possible to eliminate this element from the forum.


I believe that this phenomenon of undisclosed paid promotions is going to turn into a mini
scandal among small caps. We have already seen rapid plunges in shares of CytRx,
Galena and InterCloud. There is a high potential among similar names for SEC
investigations and class action lawsuits.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 21/76


I am currently focused on Inovio and Unilife as compelling short targets. With each of
these companies there exist significant indications of undisclosed promotions prior to
stock sales. And in addition, the companies are trading at multi-year highs at artificially
inflated valuations.


There are three potential catalysts, which I expect to impact the share prices here. First,
their promotions will now come to an end, removing the steroid-like boost that has
supported the stocks. Second, the initiation of class action lawsuits just as we saw with
CytRx and Galena. Third any potential fallout from possible SEC investigations, as we
have already seen with Galena.


Appendix I - Responses


On Tuesday the author left messages with Inovio and Unilife. By Thursday there was still
no response from Unilife.


Inovio had this to say:


We are currently a sponsor of Life Sciences Report but the one article on INO that I
see was written by them and posted on SA was prior to Inovio being a sponsor. We
are designated as a sponsor on current articles written by LSR on Inovio. Any other
commentary about Inovio on SA is editorial, i.e. not paid for.


The author did speak briefly with a representative from Proactive Capital and offered the
firm a chance to respond and comment. By the time of publication, the author had not
received any detailed response from Proactive, aside from a confirmation that both Inovio
and Unilife are current clients.

In Nov 21 2012 you wrote an article "A troubling visit to Cleantech Solution" and you wrote: 
"Even when business was supposed to be booming at its peak, Cleantech operations consisted of a single open air
warehouse with less than a dozen employees engaged in making a small number of simple, low-end metal rings.


But even for those who haven't had the chance to visit Cleantech in person, the continued use of an auditor with a
uniquely troubling history of signing off on fraudulent financials as well as the continued lack of internal controls at
Cleantech should be enough cause for any sensible investor to seriously question the publicly released numbers. 
Now that Cleantech is back above $4.50, how low can this stock go once again? Each time the stock falls back below
$0.50, the company simply conducts another reverse split to get the cosmetic price up high enough to keep it from
looking like yet another penny stock. And each time the stock briefly rallies back to a notional level of $3-5.
Afterwards, it quickly drops back down to $0.50 again, which is where I expect it will find itself within a very short
period of time.


Following the huge run-up on Tuesday, I shorted Cleantech in the aftermarket at a price of $4.68. If the stock rises
more, I will gladly short more. And in fact if the stock falls, I will also be shorting more." 
Since then CLNT did not make any reverse split and the share climbed from 3.85 $ to 5.21 $. 
Are you still short?

I could be wrong, but this sounds like FUD to me. I do not have the time, or the desire to research your claims (I have
already done my DD on INO); After reading this article, I did spend a few moments to check on a few previous SA
articles on INO. The only unusual occurance I noticed: "Biotech Research Guru (BRG) has changed his/her handle to
"Stockedup." However, I would suggest that the editors of SA research your claims because if the statements you
make are true (doubtful), SA is nothing more than a platform for trumped up lies and that would take a significant cut
out of their credibility; leaving no reason for anyone to peruse further articles.


I have purchased INO shares over and over and over, etc., so I have a hefty and very LONG position in INO.


I have read 100’s of articles, doing my own research and due diligence.

Well done. I sometimes wonder if all this "Dream Team" picking is because some very large stock holders did
not do their DD and need someone to blame for loosing so much money. I'm just a tiny retail stock buyer, but
even I do my research before buying any volatile stock such as biotech. You look at the Clinical Trials and
FDA sites. And "real" news releases. Also, I can't understand why anyone would not realize that sites like
Seeking Alpha are usually just a platform for those who want to "huff" (against) and "puff" (for) a company.

Looking at paid promotions objectively no matter what a companie's business is, how are these press releases or
promotional pieces any different then that company having these authored by their ad agency, PR group, or in house
marketing group? Even subtle stuff like an specific brand automobile or logo covered soft drink machine in the back

The difference here is that these companies are paying supposed individual authors who do not disclose
compensation and/or ties to the issuer/company they're writing bullish articles about. Seeking Alpha is FULL
of this nonsense, especially on smallcaps.

Hey Stone.


That is an excellent point. Any one being paid should disclose the fact. The authors were writing as though
they were investors too.


Good Point (!!!)


I have seen in some areas of the SA forums disclosures that Authors are paid by SA.

There is a cure for an 'incurable' disease... doesn't that kind of kick it out of the 'incurable' category?

Stone Street Advisors... 
Precisely. The crux of the this situation is that the authors are not properly identifying that they are paid
writers. Eventually, this will destroy SA if it is not stopped. The problem is, however IMHO, that why would
anyone take the considerable time to properly research and write an article if they did not have any 'skin' in
the game? Clearly the minuscule amount that SA pays authors for clicks would hardly justify such efforts --
especially in the small cap names. So, as investors, we must assume that EVERY author has an angle --
directly or indirectly in the company he/she writes about.


With respect to this article -- there is no evidence that INO executives or board have taken personal
advantage of any paid promotion campaign -- which is clearly not the case with Galena. OK, secondary
shares were sold at inflated prices which benefits the company and even shareholders in the long run.
However, investors in the secondaries would have to be qualified investors that should have performed their
own due diligence and not relied upon SA - like us retail small fry. But, if INO has the goods and we sit tight,
the truth will come out. Patience...

HepC is a liver disease and causes cirrhosis and, ultimately, liver failure. Renal failure is kidney failure. HepC
has nothing to do with the kidney.

Marketing a promotion is not an illegal action. Small cap companies like INO are not generally candidates for
the pump and dump crowd. Most pump and dumps have hundreds of millions of shares and some promise of
business. They have no institutional following and their promotions usually include the selling of large
shareholders shares.


INO falls under none of these conditions. It has a relatively low number of shares, the fact that new shares
were issued to fulfill their secondary and that they keep their shareholders fully informed of their actions is
very refreshing and strongly contradicts the negative commentary by some. The company is continuing to win
awards in it's industry given by it's peers. It has every right and all should expect it to crow about it. Often.

You are right on, dhdhoora. Key differences with GALE and INO. Company repeats that they did NOT pay for
articles or services. They did not profit by design. That is the point. AND your point that SA is inherently set
up for these types of comments --short and long -- is what Due Diligence is ALL about. Inovio has the promise
of terrific product until I see otherwise.

That explains the non-disclosed paid pumpers. When shorts write extensive articles promoting bearish
sentiment with the intent to drive down price against the company, they must also be held accountable. This
article was a good investigative piece with substantial references, if the links still work.

stock promotion is not a new concept. Any time a company does an offering, they are in essence "paying" the
underwriter(s) to promote their stock. It's an old boys club; companies who do not use these brokers to raise capital
generally get little or no attention at all from analysts. Payment is in the form of bringing the underwriter business
where they "earn" millions of dollars in profits from the offering - rather than cold cash in a briefcase or a money wire.
In return companies get analyst coverage.


So unless INO (I am not familiar with the other companies mentioned here) is paying for distribution of misleading
information (I have not seen ANY evidence of this), they are simply doing what they should as good corporate
stewards.


Now aside from this.... let's look further at INO: 
- There have been ZERO shares sold by insiders in 2013 & 2014. In that timeframe insiders have purchased 350,000
shares. 
- INO was nominated for 7 awards at the World Vaccine Congress. Of those 7 nominations INO won 4 awards. They
dominated this year - recognized by their peers as best in breed rising star in the world of vaccines. 
- INO just raised $63 million from institutions and stock continues to trade above the $2.90 offering price. This is
bullish in my experience. 
- Inovio's HPV vaccine is very promising. According to the CDC, 1 out of every 2 americans have HPV. 50% of
America has HPV. That's kind of a big market. 
- INO is 12.5% owned by insiders and institutional ownership is growing.


Further I must ask.... how is this short seller impartial, while someone getting paid $300 for their time is not? Seems
very thin and self serving logic on the author's part. I encourage people to research Inovio and their extensive
pipeline. This article's timing is suspect.... seems to me it is cover fire so that short sellers may cover their positions
locking in recent gains.


my two cents.

I also have tried to get a response from Unilife IR, however twice they have yet to respond. Most recently, I emailed
them on 3/18 with the following:


"Last month I was digging through the some of the firm's SEC filings because I noticed there was no deferred tax
asset on the balance sheet despite the company having persistent operating losses. I elaborated on why this is a
serious cause for concern here (see paragraph 5): http://seekingalpha.co...


Management, particularly Mr. Shortall, has repeatedly pumped up the firm's future prospects, literally at every chance
possible. This, however, is in direct conflict with management's decision to take a 100% valuation allowance, hence
no deferred tax asset on the balance sheet.


Absent any explanation to explain this conflict, management seems to have grossly exaggerated the firm's future
prospects, and likely have made several material misstatements about the firm's future prospects not covered under
the disclaimer regarding forward looking statements as in your SEC filings.


I, my clients, and your other investors would greatly appreciate an explanation of this significant conflict as well as
harmony between the firm's SEC filings and management's incredibly promotional and exaggerated pronouncements
about the firm's future outlook.


Thank you & regards,


Jordan S. Terry 
Managing Director 
Stone Street Advisors LLC"


Still no response two and a half weeks later. I'd call but I think it'd be a massive waste of my time as at best, I'd get a
runaround or a "we don't comment further on information contained in our SEC filings."


UNIS is a dog with fleas. Longs can continue hurling personal attacks on everyone who points this out, but they
seldom if ever respond to the merits of the short arguments. Sad.


27 Mar 2014, 11:56 AM


qldpezant
If I was a ceo I wouldn't bother answering you either Jordan. I've read your short articles and posts on UNIS
and the highly intelligent and informed responses from longs. Then an article like this comes from a short with
an early erroneous comment on institutional support for UNIS. Further reading from that point wasn't
necessary, and I can see from other comments here that indeed inaccuracies on other stocks mentioned did
indeed occur.

Interesting article written to support the author's viewpoint and financial interests. However it is disappointing that the

There should be two clear points that you should made in this article. First, be aware that all SA writers are may be
paid for pumping (invest) or bashing (short) a given stock whether they are disclosed them or not. Second, you are
working on shorting these stocks so be mindful of what you are saying and perform DD accordingly.


The rest is blah blah blah...

well said. I forgot to mention INO's extensive partnerships, another vote of confidence in the viability of INO's pipeline
It should also be noted that Dr. Kim's INO ownership is nearly all of his net worth. If that's not aligned with shareholder
interests.. I don't know what is!

paid stories are, of course, advertising. that is a form of promotion. when it's about a stock, and the company pays for
it, then it's a stock promotion, and illegal. not perhaps so much at the writer level.

such an article is allowed to be posted in fact. Claims made without proper supporting documents, especially
concerning INO. The fact that Pearson has added Inovio's ticket to this article is in my opinion disgraceful.


The first thing I do when reading any article from SA is to see if the writer is short or long the stock. It gives a
much better idea of from where they stand and in doing so allows me to make up my own mind about the
integrity of the article, long or short!

Hey Steve,


I'll be following up with SA regarding Pearsons article as well. I wont go into the details herein as they may be
taken as attacks rather than as factual points such as the one you pointed out. This isn't a court room BUT if
one is going to make claims of malfeasance by innuendo or inference they must at least provide the
information about the specific or potential laws broken.


It appears the shorts have learned from recent published news articles about Steve Ackerman who is short
Herbal Life $500 Mill that they can file claims to the SEC and get the full weight of the government behind
their loosing positions.


Lets be glad INO has withstood the test in the market and this current situation. Speaks well of our
investment.


Be well Brother

Interesting that Seeking Alpha chooses to remove these articles rather than adding a qualifying note or preface. To
me, that seems to compound the offence of publishing all these anonymous articles which are clearly attempting to
manipulate low float spec stocks. I think they would prefer to pretend these articles never happened. Seeking Alpha is
well aware that the articles presented here move share prices, otherwise they would not front-run them to paying
customers.

Good point just deleting the articles/authors accounts isn't good enough if they are going to just wipe it they
need to send an email out to users saying these authors have been found to be in breach of whatever rules

Let's see . . . if a company, especially a small and hopefully growing one, doesn't do a good job of telling their story
and potential to the market, that is a weakness in management. And if they hire a PR firm to help tell their story to the
market, that is another reason to think poorly of management. Which is it?


Let's get back to internet 101. Seeking Alpha (along with many other boards and sources) are on the internet. From
the birth of the web, one of it's mixed blessings/curses has been anonymity. Free to speak without retribution, and no
certainty as to the identity, credentials, and motives of the writer. I'm not sure if the writer of this article is actually
Richard Pearson, or who Richard Pearson really is. Not sure about myself sometimes. What we know we don't know
about all internet sources should always be kept in mind. And it can be balanced by the large community writing and
commenting, and commenting on the comments.


Buyer beware, reader beware, do your own research, and take responsibility for your own investment decisions. Most
importantly, at some point every day shut this stuff down and spend some time with friends and family, the sky and the
sun.

Reflecting on the premise and arguments of this article.... Does he present *ANY* facts on Inovio's vaccines,

Reminds me of the illusionist tricks you see at the carnival.... Notice how the author draws our attention away from the
fundamentals.... to the periphery.... and suddenly,.. for the untrained, casual observer,... the "magic" begins.....


"He wants his tricks to reveal the everyday fraud of perception so that people become aware of the tension between
what is and what seems to be. Our brains don't see everything—the world is too big, too full of stimuli. So the brain
takes shortcuts, constructing a picture of reality with relatively simple algorithms for what things are supposed to look
like. Magicians capitalize on those rules. "Every time you perform a magic trick, you're engaging in experimental
psychology," Teller says. "If the audience asks, 'How the hell did he do that?' then the experiment was successful. I've
exploited the efficiencies of your mind."

Here’s some worthy information for our intelligent readers that have been omitted from this article regarding INO:


1)If you even remotely believe that INO is paying to pump their results, then why are the scientific results of INO
clinical trials consistently published in journals like the New England Journal of Science and Medicine, the Journal of
Infectious Diseases and other periodicals and peer reviewed published papers? Did INO pay them?


In order to for INO to accomplish this, all of INO tests and clinical trials have been consistently checked, rechecked
and validated using the Scientific Method, as well as peer reviewed by additional scientists. It has been validated over
and over, time and time again.


2)INO has had over a dozen manuscripts published in medical journals just in 2013 alone. Are those places were
anonymous material can be cleverly disguised


3)Additionally, they have over 16 million dollars in NIH funding. These days only the top 6.5-10% of grant applications
receive funding from government sources. On top of that, they have Department of Defense funding for the
development of cheap, easy to use DNA vaccines for disasters/epidemics. Did they have to pump their SP to get
these grants?


4)Their cash runway extends well into the 1st quarter of 2016 and they recently partnered with Roche in September
2013 and received another 10 million dollars. They will begin receiving milestone payments, as determined in their
agreement, the first of which will be made upon implementation of trials. Boy, Roche fell for this one, huh?


5)To make such a claim you make, you would have to also imply that these research papers from independent
sources, nationally published periodicals and national journals are all part of a wider conspiracy to allow INO to

perpetrate this pump on the scientific community, the Department of Defense, NIH, PATH, HIV Network and now, our
new partner Roche. This so-called "pump" would have to be of EPIC proportion, unimaginable size and scope based
merely upon the oversight and related regulatory requirements.


6)Finally, nobody could also believe that the universities, their scientists and graduate students would also be part of
this ongoing course of conduct that you want the readers to believe.


I think it’s pretty clear to those who have done their due diligence that INO has the potential to turn the medical world
upside down and completely destroy current vaccine technology.


You on the other hand are looking in the wrong direction with INO and comparing them to GALE. Tell me, who is
selling shares of INO that sits on their BOD? None, whereas that was a much different story with the GALE BOD!

I think the author has got a totally wrong angle with Inovio. 
Promotion is the least issue here. Capable investors are setting their stakes for VGX-3100 Phase II results due by
mid-year, which might give a huge boost and is the key point for the future performance of the company. 
No pre-promotions are necessary, they can't affect these results, and Inovio has already guaranteed financing till end
of 2017. 
Does the author envision that "Best Therapeutic Vaccine" and "Best Early Stage Vaccine Biotech" awards granted to
Inovio this week at World Vaccine Congress are also paid promotions?

Richard, nice article. Anytime something is written about an unpleasant subject, there is likely to be a fair amount of
criticism - especially where people's wallets are concerned. I see from the comments so far, that this write up is
certainly no exception. 
The question I think we must ask ourselves is "Did the undisclosed paid promotions written about here, happen?"
Regardless of the science involved, regardless of the awards, regardless of the established partnerships, did the
promotions happen? 
If they did, then there must be some accountability by the companies involved. I am long Inovio and I will continue to
be long Inovio, regardless of any stock price fall out from this article. I will do this, because I believe in the science
and I believe in the potential (both humanitarian and economic) of the science involved. Nevertheless, if the rules
were knowingly broken, then the companies involved need to answer for this. 
Defending their actions by claiming "others are doing it too" or "how else are they going to get their name out there" is
not a valid defense. Paid promotions are fine, provided they are disclosed, and that seems to be Pearson's point here
and also seems to be something forgotten by the more vehement critics. 
Having said all of the above, I must also add that I find the author's apparent disinterest in weighing in on the
discussion(s) taking place here and in his last investigative expose' published on SA to be disturbing and suspect. I
am a Pastor by vocation and if I was unwilling to encourage questions and discuss/defend the sermons I present,
then I would be failing in my duty. Richard, I feel you are failing in your duty by not being involved in the discussions
here.

There is nothing wrong at all with a firm getting its message out to the public so long as everything is truthful. It's
called public relations or advertising or whatever. If you have found lies then more power to you. If not, then this is a
waste of time. More serious issues are caused by shorts who actually do publish lies.

Interesting that INO is up nearly 13% today, even in the face of Richard's article. Looks like the awards INO received
yesterday trumped the concerns about gilding the lily with IR sponsored articles and interviews.


What to think? Well, in the case of GALE's interaction with the Dream Team, GALE is alleged to have edited the
articles that were posted by DT, which, as I understand it, is a big no-no in the eyes of the SEC.

Significantly, no evidence of any INO participation in the clearance or editing of posted IR-originated articles has come
to light. Neither has there been any evidence of insiders trading on or otherwise benefiting from IR firm promotion.


Instead, INO has continued to impress its peers with the high quality of performance in its chosen field, and is moving
ahead on its testing schedule. To the extent that today's market valuation is a reflection of continuing investor
confidence in INO's product line and management, then the verdict of the jury that counts the most is in. It reads: Not
Guilty.

If you check out WVC/Terrapinn, you'll find that the "awards" are conducted just like American Idol or Dancing

It's my understanding that Inovio is a pharmaceutical company that develops products based on scientific studies that
are used to approve their work. Based on the positive peer reviews of their work thus far, it is clear that all promotions
ever done by Inovio are likewise positive and based on facts. I am therefore puzzled by the negative tone displayed in
this article about the methods used by a small company to disseminate good scientific results. After all, the scientific
work being undertaken by Inovio is intended to improve the healthcare of patients. That alone seems like a
noteworthy cause to disseminate progress toward achieving that goal.

I disagree with you. I do not believe Mr. Fox's research supported a hyper-bullish view on Plug Power. In one of his
most recent articles, Mr. Fox even suggested that Plug Power's share price could pull back to below $6.00 per share.
So, your comment that Mr. Fox is or was "hyper bullish" is incorrect. His articles were not the typical backward-looking
articles that we see so many of. To the chagrin of the short-sellers, Mr. Fox provided strong evidence of a "major
turnaround story" at Plug Power that is quickly morphing into a rapid growth story. And, unlike so many of the articles
on Plug Power that look "backward", Mr. Fox pointed out the improving fundamentals.


We are please to have a "long" position in Plug Power. Here is why:


In Q4-13, Plug Power booked a multiple-site order from Kroger using Plug Power's GenKey (Turnkey) solution, which
includes GenDrive Fuel Cells, infrastructure, service, and hydrogen fuel.


In Q4-13, Plug Power had "repeat orders" with key material handling giants Walmart, Kroger, Mercedes Benz and
BMW, resulting in fleet expansion and follow-on orders. These orders included both products and recurring revenue
for service.


In Q1-14, Plug Power announced receipt of a huge, record-sized 6-Distribution Center Turnkey Order from the world’s
largest retailer, Walmart, using Plug Power's GenKey (Turnkey) solution, which includes products (1,738 GenDrive
Fuel Cells), infrastructure, 6-years service, and hydrogen fuel.


With increasing orders to fill factory production capacity, Plug Power will realize cost-savings due to economies-of-
scale as well as shorter lead-times to shipment (revenue booked), which will increase Gross Margin from 25% to
approaching 30% in Q4-14.


Other companies see the “huge” order from Walmart as a selling point – and have placed new orders with Plug Power
during this quarter (Q1-14). On March 13, 2014, Plug Power announced receipt of a GenKey (Turnkey) Order from an
“unnamed” car manufacturer. The details of this new order will soon be announced!


Clearly - Plug Power is gaining strong momentum during 2014. We are pleased to be investors - buying, holding and
accumulating more shares of Plug Power for the long-term.

Mr. Pearson, 
Almost every company that ever was, is, or will be had, have, or will have paid promotions. (It's called marketing.)
Most of the larger companies have entire departments devoted to promoting its products (or services) . . . and the
smaller ones hire this out. For as the saying goes, "if you've got something to sell don't whisper it in a well. If you want
to get the dollar stand on a stump and holler."

DEAR READERS,


SA removed my articles addressing Mr. Pearson. Based on the rules under which we are allowed to participate in the
forum I was inflammatory and attacking. I apologize to you for this behavior on the forum while I also hope you

I think Seeking Alpha should allow people to post comment at the same level as the level of accusation issued by Mr
Pearson !! My english is not good enough for me to write what I realy think about You Mr Pearson but finaly I think
Steven is damned right and I shouldn't spend some time with your article ... You don't even dare responding to the
comments of the other and the question I asked you....perhaps because you cannot answer because your
accusations are not true and you know it....  
Im very sorry Seeking Alpha deleted so many comments further to this article... SA is a great place to learn a lot of
things when one can put the trash aside... I am looking forward to read all your comments, you being short or long !! 
I am long Inovio and I hope the technology they are developing will prove to be a solution to cure as many diseases
as they can even for you Mr Pearson !!!

Pingou, 
Your English is fine --- far better than you may think and most certainly better than many of the comments and
stock talks I have read on SA. 
I too have had a comment deleted (from RP's previous expose' article), due to inflammatory remarks. In that
case, I noticed that many of the comments made had reached well past discussing the issue and had
reached the level of ugly, personal attacks against the author and against other commentators. I expressed
my fear that SA was in danger of becoming like the Yahoo message boards, but I don't believe I expressed
myself well, and I was probably guilty of doing exactly what I was decrying -- being personally insulting. 
I believe that as long as we all manage to stay above the level of personal insults, and stick to the issues
expressed in any particular article, then the level of discussion will always be of superior quality. 
Perhaps one change SA could consider, is a requirement that authors be at least minimally involved in the
conversations related to their articles. I'm not sure what this rule would look like and I'd love to see some of
the contributors commenting here weigh in.

Hu hu.... Thank you Jeff !! I think your post was great and I think this time Seeking Alpha is having some
problems because they know the article from Mr Pearson re Inovio is full of sh...... If one cannot prove his
allegation it is because it's all lies.... As long as Mr Pearson does not answer and prove with documents what
he is supposing, he is IMHO manipulating markets....and that is a crime, while marketing is not !!! Having Jim
Cramer endorsing Inovio on friday after close is a great discrédit to this article from Mr Pearson

Mr. Pearson,


Your points regarding biased information are noteworthy. This part of your article I respect. Your claims of impropriety,
however, are self-serving, having failed to answer questions material to those claims.


First, you fail to state whether the companies that raised capital through equity offerings during the promotional
marketing period were legally obligated to disclose their relationships with the PR firms who conducted the marketing
and then failed to disclose that information in filings with the SEC. This would be your strongest argument, but you fail
to make it. This raises questions about the motive for your article, does it not?


Second, you insinuate that the PR firms were “controlled persons”, as defined by the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts.
Third, you also suggest that the activities of the third party authors would be construed by the legal system as “aiding

and abetting” an illegal activity, which you allege was a manipulation of the market price of those companies that
sought to raise capital through an equity offering. These insinuations and allegations float on false imaginings of
conspiracy if you cannot show a failure in disclosure. So why didn't you?


So, Mr. Pearson, answer the questions: are these firms required to disclose such relationships and did they fail to do
so? And, would you please disclose that should any of these speculative, high risk companies succeed in their
business ventures, for example win FDA approval, all of your allegations of price manipulation become nothing more
than a declaration of optimistic enthusiasm that becomes justified over time, or even found to be conservative in hind
sight?


Also, would you please disclose, even if you regard it as a long shot as I do, that you stand to gain 10% of any
disgorged funds resulting from any successful legal proceeding by the SEC in this matter?


In addition, would you also disclose to your reading public (the ones who hold shares in positions you have shorted)
your belief with respect to the legal application of the “misappropriation theory” to your own actions regarding your
private communications with various authors that you discuss, and how the concept of the “constructive” or
“temporary” insider does or does not apply to you with respect to any short positions you put on prior to your article
being published?

Thank you for your incisive questions to the author. The only "crime" uncovered here was failure of author to
provide accurate disclaimers. Seriously unethical, but not criminal. I do commend the author for uncovering
this much. But beyond that, the article reminds me of someone saying "something smells fishy"...while
walking through a fish market!

Dont have a side in this fight but like seeing anything exposed. My only problem with this is that you could have a very
Legit company with a great product show all the same signs.


First they are within 6 months of a catalyst. Then announce a patent or two. A regular writer gives his opinion and it
goes up 10%. THen an equity buyer steps in and buys a chunk, Everyone see it and like the company now has
money. Up another 10%. Someone writes about the new money and maybe some institutional buying. Up another
30%. Then they announce a new study in a different area, and show up at some conf. to speak about their stuff. Up
another 10%, then an article from someone else that likes it. U close to 120% and another buyer steps in because the
reconize the potential.  
So you get another article on it and a TV blast.


Point is it is hard to directly tie one with the other. I believe there is lots of JUNK, money making going on behind the
scenes.

I can also tell you I follow a company I feel very strong in and the things you say have happened. There is a big
difference in the article coming first, other stuff coming after. But to notice that difference is almost impossible and
even the best biotech at this level are going to need money, need to get it out... etc...


The ONLY thing one can do is watch for the over the top inside selling like you put up a couple weeks ago. What a
joke that a director of CYtrx can load up on Galena at .75 and sell at 8.. That should be stopped.


Just a fine line here to be walked and watched...

Inovio


On March 17th, Michael in Illinois asked about Inovio, then on Thursday's Lightning Round, Chris in New York asked
about the same name.


"I don't know enough about this stock to opine," said Cramer at the time. "I need to do some homework."


Fortunately Cramer is a quick study. In a day's time, he's learned that Inovio is a small biotech company that has run
from about $0.50/share a year ago to well over $3/share today.


Largely the gains are pegged to the promise of vaccines made by the company that are used in the treatment of
cancers and infectious diseases. "The company's SynCon technology enables vaccines to protect patients from
changing strains of pathogens, including influenza and HIV. And the clinical programs include cervical dysplasia,
avian influenza, prostate cancer, leukemia, Hep C and HIV. "


Cramer always says "Mad Money" viewers are among the smartest investors that he knows. And this is no exception.
He thinks viewers have found a potential buy.


"I believe that the pipeline breadth makes Inovio an interesting spec," he said. But, as with every spec play, Cramer
also added a word of caution. "If you go into this stock, you must realize it's a bet on a very early stage pipeline and
the bet could go wrong."

There would be credibility to the story in regards INO if insiders had sold in a situation such as the case of Galena, but
no insider sold INO! Every company has the right to market itself. It is called selling its story. How else would you
attract investments? Author's point would be valid for Inovio if insiders took advantage of it. Here is Joseph Kim, the
CEO of Inovio, comment about his shares:


"Dr. Kim: Clearly, I have chosen in the past to vote my confidence with my wallet. I added almost half a million shares
with purchases in the open market over about 12 - 18 months. In fact, my financial net worth is about 99.9%
concentrated in Inovio stock. While I don't comment on my future purchases, I do feel that INO's valuation today is
very attractive relative to the potential of our technology and the many products that may be advanced based on this
technology."

I respect the writer of the article and enjoyed reading it. I also appreciated the fact that he made full disclosure that he
was short Inovio. I would advise anybody investing in any company to do their on due diligence. I invested in this
company a few years ago because I believe in the work this company is doing and I really hope they succeed for all
the people it would benefit, healthwise. So far I am not disappointed. The CEO has a large ownership and the have
great partnerships.


Full disclosure: I am long INO, but I did sell a few shares a while back for a 650% gain. If the stock falls some more I
will likely buy more share


Thanks for the article!

It seems that an important part of listed companies are engaged in these practices. Then it is common in
SeekingAlpha and elsewhere. So we have not invented gunpowder ... the same way that we can not punish one or
two companies for these acts. Is system, flawed. Articles extolling, others revile in general there is always interest, to
raise or to lower the quote of the companies. Science always wins in the end, when it comes to bio companies. In this
case, Inovio has science (Inovio Pharmaceuticals Recognized with "Best Therapeutic Vaccine" Award at World
Vaccine Congress 2014, as well the Roche's partnership), as it seems that many of the other companies mentioned.
After that, thanks for the article and thanks to S.Alpha.

lies, or were they  over glorifications of positives regarding these companies to pump the stocks by stating high price
points?  I have seen more misleading numbers and misinformation in the negative articles regarding stocks than the
positive ones and it would seem harder to fake or make up positives regarding a stock then negatives. Anytime I read
any of these articles I go into it with the mindset of what is the authors motivation first, then check the numbers and
finally look for corroborating information or articles to confirm what is being said.


Having watched 60 minutes last night and seeing that companies are using fractions of seconds to manipulate stocks
by the pennies to make hundreds of millions and now this, its making me consider taking my money pretty much out
of the market cause its no longer a fair market but too much a game of manipulation by the rich in both directions.

The market has tools to help you fight back.


If I may ask, what does it matter if a market improves or declines because of news of a war beginning or
ending OR a computer buying when the market is inclining and selling when it softens. The only difference I
can see is that wars are random and computers leave consistent more frequent footprints.


Don't know your experience level so excuse me if this is rudimentary. In fact if you are patient and learn a little
basic charting, you can see computer patterns in some stocks. ALNY I used to trade in $3 dollar ranges
several times a week and sometimes daily. It was an awesome cash machine. Look at it's history. Take
advantage. Invest AND trade.


Fidelity and AmeriTrade have similar systems that allow you to pre set a trade or a stop without posting it to
the brokers system for them to see. The benefit there is that Level 3 Brokers/Institutional guys can't see the
stops and can't steal your money by dragging the market down to stop you out. You can enter blind trades as
well in the same system. AmeriTrade calls it "Trade Triggers". Don't know what Fidelity calls their system.


Eventually I suspect INO may do the same as more institutional types get involved. I am hoping it happens.


Be well and good trading.

@wmcraigbarnard - were you responding to my comment? Not sure if you understood my post if you did. I am not
sure why anyone would not be concerned about all out lies or deceptive statements in articles that can cause panic
and huge false upswings/downswings in the market. Even worse the knowledge of trades and millisecond trades prior
to them hitting the market and then raising the price pennies but amounting to millions. How about setting up triggers
to protect an investment then having a stock price purposely temporarily manipulated down so sales are made
automatically (i.e. by triggers) and then having the stock go back up once the manipulation is removed. They get your
stocks at a temporary reduced price.

To address these comments directly, I don't believe any company using the tactics you describe is acting in
good faith. Remember they as public companies must conform to standards of public trust. So, if I knew of
these practices I'd take other actions.


Most companies have a squad of attorneys looking at anything they post to the public to make sure that what
they say and how they say it conforms to legal standards that keep them from harm. Not only do they have to
protect the company and themselves but also share holders and the value of their investments.


Stocks trade all day long. Milliseconds don't matter. Moving a few pennies doesn't matter. Stocks move up
and down. I'm both a Day-Trader and Investor. As a Day-Trader pennies can make a difference but I've never
been so blessed as to be hit with losses of millions of dollars in a single trade. That is a silly argument being
made by idiot talking heads who write this stuff to make headlines to make themselves look like champions of
the little guy.


Here is what we all need to worry about. Please understand this, it's very important. The recent noise about
computer trading brought to light something I was aware of but didn't think was a serious issue. IT IS.


Companies now have the ability to SEE THE TRADE YOU POST. It can be a buy or sell order. What is scary
is they have systems now that are so fast they can actually get ahead of your trade. So AS you place your
order their computers are so fast they can't literally jump in front of your order and take the sale. This can
cause the price to drop a few pennies. THAT is the concern. Not the pennies one investor looses in a single
trade but that they can jump in front of your trade to get ahead of you in the que.


You may not even know it happens IF your trade is made at the price you selected. I don't do market trades
anymore. I always choose my price for my buy and sell. I suspect this is why these issues don't affect me. I
never try to get the lowest price or the highest price. I pick somewhere in between using charting as an
indicator.


Think through your trigger question again. If you set a price in your trigger and get it, what is the complaint? If
your using Market orders I can understand your concern a little better. If you set your sell price/buy price and
get it what is the issue your concerned about? What I don't like is they have super fast computers on
proprietary networks connected to markets that allow access so fast that your trade though entered first, ends
up following theirs. THAT IS A PROBLEM.


Lets me explain a little market history. It's very interesting. Back in the mid 80's a fella named Harvey Houkin
developed a system of trading called SOES. ((Small Order Entry System)) It was simple and anyone could do
it, but the good old boy system kept the big boys from daring such as they would violate the polite politically
correct white collar crime that was built quietly into the market. Only the big boys knew it, including the Feds &
the SEC.


Harvey would go into the market and split the bid. Take a middle position between the Bid and Ask. Until
Harvey did this it was wasn't done. Why? Because this was how brokerages made billions of dollars. They
would simply transact on the posted BID and ASK prices. There was no in between unless it was ((Illegally))
pre-arranged.


Harvey literally hired and funded brokers to transact these trades. Often as many as 200 trades were done in
a day. These guys were called SOES Bandits. The big boys went crazy. They COULDN'T STEP IN FRONT

OF Harvey once in the que and they HAD to buy him out to get their trades done. No trading, no money and
bonuses would potentially shrink. They were forced to buy out the Bandits trades so they could continue
stealing. Think about this. The brokers made the spread between the bid and the ask. What happens if you
cut it in half in any trade? They make only half.


The big boys have been looking to get their edge back ever since Harvey created true Day-Trading. Harvey s
Bandits bought and sold in quantities of 200, 500 and 1000 shares. AND they made 1/4's, 1/2's and 50%.
Some times they made dollars. This was how they made millions. The DOT COM era arrived just in time for
the average guy and gal to take advantage of Harvey s trading system. It's truly amazing how many people
don't know this. If not for Harvey the DOT COM era would never have been what it became. Every one talks
about Bill Clinton and Regan causing the economic boom during that period, but the real story is a little
Jewish man figured out how to pick the pockets of the 1% legally and then taught everyone else how to do it
too.


People sitting at home on computers trading, owe it all to Harvey, a few computer companies and Al Gore
who we all know created the Internet.


99%er's need to wake up and learn that there is a way for them to take advantage of the 1%. PICK THEIR
POCKETS, LEGALLY through online trading.

@wmcraigbarnard - Thanks for that post - I heard about that along time ago but did not know the guys name.
The point I was trying to make is that I have set up triggers to sell a stock at 70 cents or more, less than its
current price to protect my gains when I know I will be away from the market for an extended period. Never
expecting it to drop that amount based on recent trading but do it to be safe. Then next thing I know the stock
drops 75 to 80 cents or more with no negative news, drop in the market as a whole or any other reason I can
find. Within 24 to 48 hours it goes back up right about to where it was. Then it dawned on me that if I had a
trigger like this many others might have one as well. So is it possible that a temporary dip like that, that is
strictly unrealized gains lost on those w/o a trigger and then those same folks jump in and purchase the
stocks that become available at the triggered lower price fully expecting it to go back to where it was since
they helped drive the price down temporarily. Remember this would have to be someone with significant
holdings to be able to do something like that. They are selling small portions at a loss expecting to buy them
and more back at the discounted price. I see temporary dips in some of the bigger name stocks with nice
dividends and I wonder is that what is going on. When it appears there is no justified reason for the temporary
fluctuation.

Good day.


The triggers I am suggesting are actually not able to be seen by traders, ie brokers even with level 3 screens.
It is common practice for news letter writers who recommend stocks and tout company's stories to

recommend placing stops at 25% or even 30% below an entry price they recommend.


I believe your talking about stops not triggers. Would that be correct. Or are you using Trade Triggers to
initiate your stops?


I have long suspected that these writers work with large institutional investors who follow what they write and
then take advantage of the recommendations. By knowing a specific entry price, the size of the writers
following and being able to see normal stop loss positions they can in fact program those big institutional
trades to sweep the stops and make very nice profits. It's actually very common for them to do this.


However if one uses a feature Ameri-Trade and Fidelity use your triggered trade isn't able to be seen prior to
the stock hitting your stop price. It doesn't enter the que until it is "Triggered" by the market hitting your set
price.


I suspect we are speaking about two different types of triggers. Maybe not. Hopefully my explanation clears
up the confusion we have had. 
Good trading.


02 Apr 2014, 10:07 AM


FF373737
I don't think you are getting my point with regards to triggers not being as safe as you think but that is okay. I
will try one more example. MKND just doubled overnight from $4 to $8. It is a pretty good bet that anyone that
can't keep an eye on those gains has set triggers or stops to protect those gains. Today the stock would most
likely slip back, it may and it may not but lets just say that for 7 to 10 days it stays at or around $7.50. Most
with unrealized gains would still keep some fail safe to protect from a drop. Now lets say over the weekend no
news comes out about MNKD but on Monday it drops 50 cents to a dollar and on Tuesday or Wednesday it
goes right back up to $7.50 to $8 w/o any big announcements or articles. Many of those triggers would have
triggered and those folks would no longer own the shares that they were protecting but someone bought
them. Now ask yourself why did the stock drop 50 cents to a dollar and come right back up with no
announcements or articles to drive that move and no major market swings as well. I saw that happen at least
15 to 20 times with TEAR when it made its climb from $1 to over $12 over a 2 year period. Just something to
think about. Tear is now at around $7 but that is another story. Lets put it this way many know that people
have triggers to protect from a loss and take advantage of it.


Good trading to you as well

This is great stuff. I am not sure I have read another article on SA that has as much potential value (albeit in the
wealth preservation sense).


I applaud your effort and diligence in developing this information, sharing it with the SEC, and sharing it with the SA
community. You not only outed several frauds, you provided helpful in formation about how to look for them. So I did.
And I didn't like what I found. To my chagrin, just a moment ago I placed an order selling a small position I just
recently purchased in a nanocap biotech (a different company than those you mentioned, but I used your general
method of looking).


I'd like to call on SA to remove ALL articles and ban any author where there is credible evidence that the author
received undisclosed compensation for the article. I don't mind being responsible for screening the dumb and/or bad
authors, but I'd rather not have to worry about fraudulent writers; sleaze can be a lot harder to catch.


I hope SA responds far more vigorously than it has to this point to ban corrupt authors: Failing to do so will undermine
the very foundation upon which SA is based.


I also very much hope people who have invested in these companies also file complaints with the SEC: It is a very
easy process and can be done electronically from their website; documents from your hard drive can be attached to
the SEC electronic complaint.


My compliments and very sincere thanks for a job well done.

what people want to keep hidden and everything else is publicity."


What Richard did is news. The people who were compensated for their articles and didn't disclose it properly
were just simply doing fraudulent publicity.

Why haven’t UNIS’s products been “accepted in mass?” 
1) UNIS is not marketing to the masses. They are selling to drug companies. These are tough customers, not
“pushovers” as some would have you believe. 
2) They are not selling commodities. They are selling specialty products.


I am holding my position in anticipation of the next major deal to be announced by Mr. Shortall, the CEO

Upon contacting Inovio regarding there proposed vote on the reverse stock split in May, I received this response;

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 63/76


Inovio filed a proxy last Thursday evening asking shareholders to vote for or against a reverse split.


We have outlined an explanation for the reverse split in the proxy, which I provide here for your convenience if you
haven’t seen it. The reverse stock split is intended to expand our audience of potential investors, both institutional and
retail, by increasing the per share stock price. There are two main factors to consider.


The first factor is that some institutional investors have internal policies preventing the purchase of low-priced stocks.
Similarly, non-solicitation rules at most broker-dealers prevent financial advisors or brokers within those firms from
soliciting orders in low-priced stocks. In both cases, five dollars is a price level that is commonly set as the minimum
price requirement for such institutions or broker-dealers to purchase a common stock.


The second factor is investor psychology related to low-priced stocks or “penny stocks.” While there may not be a
specific price that defines a low-priced or penny stock, we have been repeatedly advised that stocks priced below five
or even ten dollars are viewed with hesitation by many institutions and retail investors and their advisors. Price is
frequently used as a proxy for “quality” and low-priced stocks are considered to potentially be of lower investing
quality and/or less desirable relative to a company’s peers with higher share prices. In a recent comparison of Inovio’s
peers in terms of market capitalization, very few traded at a share price below five dollars and Inovio ranked almost
last in comparative share price.


We believe that the institutional and retail investors who are unable to or choose not to invest in the Company
because of our share price and share structure are investors who are more fundamentally oriented and have a longer
term investment horizon. We believe that a higher share price and lower share count will increase the perceived
quality and appeal of the Company’s shares for investment purposes and will significantly expand our audience of
potential investors in general and increase our shareholder base of investors with longer term investment horizons
specifically. In accomplishing this goal, we may also reduce share price volatility.


We therefore believe that implementing a reverse split will improve the strength and quality of our shareholder base
and enhance our potential to appeal to investors with long term investment time horizons that mirror the long term
vision the Company’s management has for building shareholder value.


Best,


Chelsey Nehila 
Communications Associate


My response;


What message are you sending to us as retail investors that you dilute our shares by way of a public offering, at a
discount of what our shares were worth, and then proposing a reverse split just to attract institutional investors. I'm
disappointed in your strategy, in that you turn your self into a cheap trick and abuse those who have been with you
from the beginning. I'm losing my faith in your company. Stand on your merits and not get involved in manipulative
tactics that discredits what you preach. I'm very, very disappointed in your management team and losing faith in
Inovio. You are either mislead or you don't believe in the success of your research. 
Regretfully, 
Gabe

If Phase II will go wrong, reverse split will be totally unuseful and the share value will fall deeper and deeper.
But if phase II result will be ok, reverse stock split will be the fuel to skyrocket mkt capitalization

The reverse split - what will be voted at the meeting is proposal to allow such included in future actions. Real
split could be done much later or not at all. I just hope this "preparation" is not put in place because they
expect the stock crash back into the penny zone. Therefore i kind of agree with alphagabby.

Gabe - if you take 4 quarters you have one Dollar. That is what reverse split means. There is no need to lose
trust into this company. The 'dilution' was effective because INO has now good balance sheet and therefore is
more attractive. Note that the price did not even dropped to (or even below) the $2.90 or so the offering was
priced at.

You might look back at some the articles posted re: NBS and CVM splits last year. It's difficult to judge the
success of a split as other events can move the share price in the same time frame. The response to a split is
not a binary event.


Although I did not consider it dilution per stary's argument above, it has been unclear to me whether the split
applies to all classes of shares. If it doesn't then dilution is occurring to some extent. Perhaps someone else
more knowledgeable can comment on this.

B_Banzai, thank you for sharing. I believe falsely raising the share price, especially after dilution, raises red

against it. I know I am.

Reverse splits do not dilute. Am I missing something.


Once a stock is sold the company doesn't benefit from future buys and sells of that stock. The Market is then
in control. In other words Brokers control the price based on interest and published reports of the companies
financials, sales and progress. Companies loose control of the price and good companies CEO's don't even
focus on their stock price as the company matures. In younger less developed companies they do. Rather
they focus on growing a good sound business.


02 Apr 2014, 10:49 AM


alphagabby
Let's say you have 50,000 shares; every penny the stock goes up equals $500. The reverse split at 1 for 2
gives you 25,000 shares; every penny the stock goes up equals $250. That's the dilution factor. It also may
invite another pubic offering. Does that make sense to you?


02 Apr 2014, 04:25 PM


B_Banzai
alphagabby,


That is a fair criticism of the practice but its practical impact is likely limited for most of us. Let's assume a 10
to 1 reverse split. Say the stock price was $1.00 per share and the minimum price movement allowed (more
on this later) is $0.10 (for the sake of argument). The minimum price movement will be 10%. If every 10
shares are aggregated to create a $10 share price but the minimum price movement is still $0.10, the
minimum swing is now 1%.

Is a 10% or 1% minimum price swing preferable? I guess if I was a day trader counting on those 10% price
swings, I would be upset. But for the rest of us, all we have is an increase the resolution on the trade. The
only time you would care is if you want to exit or enter when the stock moves one tick of that minimum
threshold.


So what is that minimum threshold of price movement? Quite often my sell price is reported to 4 decimal
places even though the bid and ask price may be denominated at less resolution. If the minimum threshold of
a trade is 1/10000th of a penny, do I really need to worry about it increasing to 1/100,000th of a penny? Yes, if
you have very large positions. No for the little guys like me!


But my sense is there much bigger factors at play as to whether a reverse split is seen as a positive or
negative. I'm more concerned about different classes of shares being treated differently in a reverse split.
Does this diminish my proportion of the total pie? Comments appreciated!

Sounds like 'Three Card Monte' to me. Nothing you've said convinced me reverse splits are beneficial to the

ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND QUIT THIS FUNNY BUSINESS OF MANIPULATION! They are creating bad

03 Apr 2014, 08:35 AM


wmcraigbarnard
Not really. There are several kinds of dilution. None of them relate to what you describe.


1. Stock dilution (pertains to adding additional shares through various mechanisms)


2. Control dilution ( pertains to loosing control of a company through a reduction in ownership)


3. Earnings dilution (pertains to a reduction in the amount earned per share due to an increase in the number
of shares.


4. Value dilution (pertains to a reduction in the price of the stock due to the INCREASE in the number of
shares.


Dilution relates to the reduction in a shares value. Not a reduction in the number of shares and number of
pennies we will receive IF it inclines in value. Why? Because the share value isn't reduced the number of
shares is reduced.


Stock Price


The stock price advances after a reverse split, and it declines after a regular split. As a result, the net value of
your stock holdings remains unchanged. 
If, for example, the stock in our example was trading at $10 before the 5-to-1 reverse split, the new shares

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2112373-behind-the-scenes-with-proactive-inovio-and-unilife 67/76


should begin to trade at $50. This is because five old shares represent the exact same ownership stake in the
corporation as one new share, and therefore they should be worth the same. 
This adjustment in price is immediate and it occurs as a result of supply and demand in the market.


Please note Dilution is tied to a reduction in value not in our hope that by holding twice as many shares
increases our opportunity to see more profit because we have more shares.


Mathematically the number of investors interested in this company are the same. So is the money they will
invest. The value will increase equally. If there are 1000 shares in your possession at $1.00 or 500 at $2.00
the value will increase the same. Why? Same number of investors with the same amount of money to invest.
The same money buying a reversed split stock (fewer shares) will cause a more rapid increase in value due
to a smaller number of shares available.


I also believe we must add into the mix that a new number of high net worth institutional investors and firms
will finally be able to invest in the company. They could not do so before. The SEC prevents or restricts large
companies from certain kinds of purchases. They don't allow pink sheet companies to be gobbled up by the
big boys.


Keep in mind, the number of investors will increase thus changing the formula mentioned above. More
investors interested in the company with fewer shares drives the price. With out the reverse split one could
argue we wouldn't see this interest come to market for some time.


Hope this helps, Be well.

Hello again alphagabby,


I missed commenting on something you said in your questioning about "dilution" and the >>> potential of
another secondary.


Companies do these things to push out Shorts by bringing in new money from new investors.


They also increase per share price for the purpose of using their stock (which is a companies currency) to
formulate financial relationships with new partners.


It's also common to clean house. Some times a company has to clean up it's books, get rid of undisclosed
issues and tidy things up to prepare for an interested buyer. I'll reference you to ALNY. Take a look at what a
15% purchase of the company did for them. Their stock climbed from $66 and hit $112. in January. I was an
exceptionally happy trader that day. Oh yes !!!


There are several good reasons for Dr. Kim to do this. There isn't any reason that makes since for him to do it
if there were bad news expected. This all points forward and up. (((My humble opinion)))


Be well Brother.

I agree, I'm all for whatever the INO management see fit to bring Inovio out of the shorts and daily traders

some don't get that is beyond belief! Good post Craig.

Great article and research. I am only in hopes the SEC does something here and digs deeper.  
Eli stated he will institute rules to help prevent the articles from appearing again.  
I am in hope this is just the beginning.

Lets visit reverse stock splits and what happens.


an investor has  
1,000 shares. and they are reverse split 2/1 now the same investor has 500 shares


Same market, same story, same corporate financial information, same number of investors and same amount of
money to be invested. 
Buyers come into the market to buy: 
shares at $1.00 and see value increase $.10 1000 shares @ .10 = $100. 
Shares at $2.00 and see value increase $.20 500 shares @ .20 = $100.


The market is math based. Emotion drives spending but the math is done by computers.

Now lets add the investors restricted from investing due to the stock being too cheep or below $5.00.


New investors come in and buy up shares at $5.00 but there aren't as many shares available. What happens? More
interest, more money and fewer shares and the price of the stock increases more rapidly. The more rapid increase
can make up for the fewer number of shares because new investors with new money come in.


A reverse split for the reason of bringing in Institutional investors and breaking the backs of short sellers may be the
most beneficial use of this financial tool.


The fact is we all hate reverse splits. It goes against an investors natural inclination towards hope and positive
opportunity. How many of us appreciate short sellers. Few.


Another reason for a reverse split is to restructure the capital structure and number of shareholders of a company to
enable it to move to another exchange. For example, move from AMEX to NASDAQ. It requires a house cleaning and
remodeling of the books.

wmcraigbarnard,


Thank you for chiming in on the reverse split. I did a little more digging and found some conflicting info on
investopia.com:


"Reverse stock splits are often seen as negative corporate actions because they are a tactic used by companies that
have seen their share prices fall into the $1 range and, therefore, run the risk of being delisted from stock exchanges"
http://bit.ly/1eeJAsD


"Companies will want to do a reverse split for many reasons. But the most common reasons are: 
- OTCBB stocks can move up to the NASDAQ stock exchange depending on the size of the split 
- Companies trading on the NASDAQ might do a split to stay on the exchange and avoid being delisted for not
meeting the minimum price requirement.


You should be very careful when staying with a company through a reverse split because, most of the time, the stock
price will start to drop after the split." 
http://bit.ly/1eeJAIR


Later the following comment is made regarding splits but they apply equally to "reverse splits": 
"None of these reasons or potential effects agree with financial theory, however. If you ask a finance professor, he or
she will likely tell you that splits are totally irrelevant - yet companies still do it. Splits are a good demonstration of how
the actions of companies and the behaviors of investors do not always fall in line with financial theory. This very fact
has opened up a wide and relatively new area of financial study called behavioral finance." http://bit.ly/1fKhNoh

I would be worried if a company was a serial splitter, but a one time split to "juice" the stock and help it "turn the
corner" does not strike me as a bad thing.


I'd be curious to know how common reverse splits are in the bio-tech arena.

Your last remarks make me think about asking a financial writer I like to follow. Don't know if he will reply to
the question but it wont hurt to ask.

Check out SRPT, but before they changed their name to SRPT! They done a 1-6 reverse split at 0.65.5 cents,
new SP was 3.94 and name changed to Sarepta Therapeutics. I had 3000 shares of AVI BioPharma which
became 500 shares of Sarepta Therapeutics. After the R/S and within 3 weeks SRPT took off. I sold on the
first day at $8.88 (sadly much too soon), then after another few weeks SRPT hit $45 PPS. AVI Bio did their
R/S for the reason to stay on the Nasdaq. INO maybe doing a R/S for better reasons IMO. SRPT took off
because of a phase 2 trial, similar to INO right now, but INO have a much better pipeline!

I could not find any statistics on how common reverse splits are but I did find several dozen discussed over the last
couple years at http://bit.ly/1dWodkO. 
Typically the are driven by de-listing concerns, but this does not always seem to be the case.


I did find the following comment: 
"The best way to successfully boost a stock’s price has been and always will be the company’s financial
performance." http://bit.ly/1dWoft1 
...but most start-up biotechs are priced based anticipated future earnings not their current financial performance. So
this statement is not particularly helpful.

On another SA comment thread, someone provided this link that I thought you might find interesting:
http://bit.ly/1qWdasC


Some of the dates appear to be in error, so I don't know how much confidence to put in the data presented.
BIOL is reported to have executed 10 forward splits but the dates are not presented in chronological order,
and I could not find the corresponding PRs. On the other hand, the CVM data appears to be correct.


Observations: 
1) Generally speaking, forward splits correlate with increasing share price most of the time (as you would
expect). 
2) Reverse splits correlate with decreasing share price most of the time, but not always. 
3) Quite a few of the splits occurred too recently to have impacted the long term trajectory of the stock price.


This assessment completely neglects the likelihood that other factors impacted the stock price more than the
split did. Still it interesting data to consider.

Check out $AI, they did a 20-1 reverse split in 2009 and I sold shortly after afraid I would lose my unrealized gains in
the stock. I made money but boy did I miss the boat on that one. It went up, way up and is at $26 now. It is also
paying a nice dividend.

From speaking with some financial types who work with corporations in restructuring their finances IE stock there was
one comment that made the most since. Defend the company from robbers. No one was definite but this came up as
a definite maybe.


It may be possible that a company with cheep stock and very high anticipation of good results is a plumb for a big
company to take over. Fewer shares would make it even more vulnerable/enticing. How does this move defend the
company?


If good news is expected (and I believe they will have a heads up, via a wink and a nod) and/or comes fewer shares
larger investors and a rapid increase in price and valuation would place a barrier making for an expensive takeover.


This is all speculation. With what we know though it is the only thing that makes since. SPECULATION? Probably.

WHY A REVERSE SPLIT? MY Guess. You decide.


When I first started writing this article I was thinking it's speculation. BUT the fact is it's not. Read below.


Good Science and a pot of gold in the bank. Hmmm.


So what is next? I'm going to refer to the list at the top of Pearsons article and quote it here. This quote removes this
from being speculative and into probable reality : >>> Note #1: Prior to publishing this article, the author filed detailed
complaints with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the parties and activities described herein.
<<<


INO is a ripe plumb for the taking. No debt, full bank account, stock price climbing, very successful secondary
offering, very promising product announcements. It's guilty of being successful and shorts can't have that.


Before the recent Bio Tech correction INO Shorts were going crazy. They made a very bad investment choice. So,
they called in their partner, the Government.


Why a reverse split? Compress the stock, make announcements and push shorts out. Simple. Repayment for the
recent SA article and SEC Complaint? Possibly.


One of the key reasons companies reverse split their stock, they are in trouble. It's a defensive move. I'm not saying
INO is guilty of anything. Any company in the sights of the Government is by definition in trouble. Ask Jamie Dimon.


Everyone better be ready. If an SEC investigation is initiated all companies listed in Pearsons complaint will end up
being published in the public domain. We will see declines in their stock. Even if companies fight, the news will be
enough to make the shorts richer as stocks fall.


Investors do not stay in high Beta stocks with serious legal risks. And remember the risk isn't based on a companies
guilt. It's based on Government squeezing the life out of the company as they force people to settle, admit wrong
doing when there is none and pay hefty fines. That is the risk.


What do you all think. Am I being a worry wart or is this sound reasoning?


07 Apr 2014, 05:11 PM


wmcraigbarnard
We have seen anywhere from 14 to 30% declines in the overall Biotech sector. Most of the sector has entered the
bear market territory.


I'm hoping we see a bottom today or tomorrow. Preferably today. BUT, if we don't see one by weeks end this could get
really bad. Many of these High Beta companies saw 100% + increases and the money guys may be using their
sophisticated algorithms to sweep the market to make some easy $$$.


There have been an amazing number of financial writers guiding people into high Beta plays all over the market but
especially in Biotech. When they make their recommendations they also guide investors to place stops at 25% and
30%. That is where we sit now in many of the Bio's. If this is a sweep of the stops, and it looks like it may be, we could

see the Bio sector turn around very soon. IF this is a real market move and not a programmed sweep of stops this
could get real ugly. The sector will probably capitulate.


I'm wondering if the general market will follow.


The market is clearly rotating from high Beta to defensive positions. Be careful.


With this sweeping decline in the most profitable segment of the market we may see a change in investor risk
management. Investors may risk less capital thus making the stellar rise in biotech stocks less impressive. In other
words less investment less increase in share price, lower price spikes and perhaps folks will be quicker to pull the
trigger to get out of positions earlier to protect early profits.


A change is taking place. As I commented above the rotation says the market is becoming defensive.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm, who to believe? INO rebounds on new article that debunks this one. I think after the GALE
debacle, someone thought there would be a great way to make money shorting INO and then putting together a great
hit piece to make them a pile of cash. Just as Cramer admitted to, attacking a stock you shorted is an easy way to
make big bucks.


The only thing I find disgusting about all this is the fact that SeekingAlpha lets this happen over and over again.
Makes you wonder if there isn't more going on here that meets the eye! They control what gets published and when,
so they could easily short or buy ahead of an article they will approve. If this in fact wasn't the case, why would they
continue to let this happen? All you need to do is put together a great looking article and profit from it when it gets
published. It's about as close as you can get to have the same advantage of insider trading. So why hasn't the SEC
stepped in and put a halt to this? Because as always they will turn a blind eye until they are forced to do something,
due to what they will claim is from being understaffed and overworked.


This has been going on way too long to have it continue SA, so why not put an end to it by not allowing an author to
hold a position in a stock they submit an article for until after 72 hours of being published. Would that be so hard to
do? OF course not, but that's not what they are interested in, they like the publicity and they couldn't care less who
gets hurt by these hit pieces. Other publications do this to avoid this conflict of interest, but SA doesn't care about
that.


Thus it comes down to us investors to get smarter and not to fall for these fancy looking research articles that are
solely intended to make an author money. Richard has written about other companies that he saw problems with, but
now he has begun to realize the money to be made with these articles, as others have also, so he searches and
searches for a stock to exploit to make money - period!


The whole issue for me is what lengths these shorts will resort to just to make money. Frankly, it sickens me to death
and the abuse of this practice that was designed to keep stocks priced fairly is now being abused to the fullest. To be
very clear, I am sickened by those companies who employ such cheating schemes, the SEC for it's non-action, SA for
allowing it, and those who partake in this practice of writing a hit piece on a stock they shorted to make money! They
have no regard for those who lose lots of money because of it and will even stand behind it, saying they are doing you
a service, so you should be glad. Really? Is that what you hide behind so you can sleep at night?

The fact is there are the right ways to doing this and there are the wrong ways, and this is the wrong way for a whole
slew of reasons, which they ignore completely. If you wanted to do this the right way, it should be done by ONLY
writing what is FACT, supported by REAL VERIFIABLE sources and not your opinion, because your opinion will be
highly motivated to be negative to pad your wallet! It's no wonder the markets are referred to as one big cesspool of
greed hungry monsters who have no regard for anything but their own interest!


Shame on every one of you who have to resort to such gutter wrenching tactics to feed your greed! One day it will
catch up with you and you will look back in disgust on how you lived your life through your devious and unethical
ways. If not, then you truly lack the most important thing in life, a conscious! It is the one thing that separates us from
animals and unfortunately the market greed has turned so many into just that, animals! AMEN!

crookedneck, I echo your sentiments.


09 Apr 2014, 03:35 PM


wmcraigbarnard
I share your sentiments however these forums aren't about fact based communication. They certainly can be,
but in reality they are places for the general population to congregate and share. People share their opinion
about all the various aspects from share valuation, market conditions etc... SA has a professional product that
is published by and for those who are more sophisticated and perhaps more serious, who need more fact
based data. The cost is just under $9,000. bucks. See. Serious folks.


I believe we expect too much from open public forums. Want some real fun. Go on Yahoo. There is always a
group of young guys banded together to supervise your every comment and harass you over every little
mistake.


It may be that in reality what you need, we need is a forum that is monitored differently and doesn't pay
authors or at the least if they pay them they must disclose that they are invested or not, what inspired their
writing and even if they invest are they long or short. It night help.


But for guys like me, I like to share. I've been investing 35 years. I retired at 38. Started my investing in Real
Estate at 34.


Some folks have insights and experience to offer. It wont always be spot on, but it's something.


Any way I agree with both you and alphagabby.


Have a great day.

It seems the discussion about the reverse split is holding interest in the stock back.


Folks are a little concerned about why the company is taking an action that says the company is preparing for a
problem. I however still have some belief that the company is doing a much needed revers to bring the company
capital structure and share price in line with it's reality. Dr. Kim has (as I have reported previously) stated he believed
the price could be $10. to $12. This move may be to make that reality come true. The timing is right with the expected
news about drug acceptability in human trials. This timing would support the stocks overriding any possible decline in
share price from the reverse. It wouldn't be surprising to see the share price settle significantly after the near term
news.


Good products bring good value and price.


We will see.


Today I'm very pleased with POVN. It's June, 25th PDUFA may see a run up in price against the current market trend.
Time will tell. Lots of volatility expected.

I want to say that I'm happy that there are people out there keeping this industry in check by monitoring and bringing
to light actions that go against the law and fair trade practices. So I support the author of this article for his actions if
all the information reported are to end up being true. One thing I'm trying to wrap my mind around is why the stock
prices for some of these stocks that allegedly paid for reports have to suffer so much. I'm long on INO for many
reasons. Just taking a look at this particular stock, most of the information in these articles end up being for the most
part true, regardless if the author was paid or not. (I was keeping up to date with the articles published on SA, that i'm
sure have since been removed, on INO for the most part and don't recall any exhorbient claim that made me
say...wow!!! I'm going to use this fake information to justify me purchasing more shares!) When it comes to the other
stocks mentioned, I have no say because I've done absolutely no research on them whatsoever. So... yes, it does
suck that there are people out there doing things they shouldn't be doing. But... truths are truths and when someone
is reporting truths about a company and it drives the stock price up then so be it. Unfortunately, we can't see these
articles anymore due to the fact that they have been removed off SA and it's hard to confirm what was fact and/or
fiction within the writing. Now I don't particularly know how writters get paid (salary or per article) but I agree they
should not recieve additional compensation for opinion pieces. If a writter gets paid to tell the truth...now that's a
whole different story. At the end of it all, the only people who suffer are the shareholders because the writers, even the
author of this article, recieved thier money up front.

They aren't paid to tell the truth. They are paid to post their opinion.


Knowing the industry, the author is wrong on many levels. No illegal act was participated in by INO, who was
the main target of the piece written. The author is a self proclaimed short in this stock.


Truth was not an issue. It became an issue after he wrote the article you so enthusiastically support.


The slandered companies may be able to take action against any involved in this article including the author
and publisher. Especially should a file/investigation be opened and the companies be found not guilty.


Attributing Penney Stock pump and dump tactics (described in his article) as the basis for the negatives
pointed out in his article, is in my opinion, clearly an effort to manipulate the markets view of the companies
credibility. Obviously if companies are doing what nasty Penney Stock pump and dump schemers are doing, it
must be criminal.


Fact. Every action INO took to keep markets informed, support investor awareness, maintain an orderly
market and to market it's stock was legal.


The company was smeared by the author associating INO with contractors bad history, not INO's bad
behavior. So they were assigned guilt by association.


I have followed INO for some time and I have seen no inappropriate behavior by the company. The only thing
I've ever pointed out was the amazing openness of Dr. Kim. I have believed he may be a bit too open with
some information. I also noted a change in behavior just before the company engaged in their funding, sale of
shares to raise $55 Million. They ultimately raised more. No crime there.


You can support the article and it's your right to your opinion. What I want you to understand is the things I
have said in support of INO are fact and are supported by regulation and law. The company engaged in legal
activities.
