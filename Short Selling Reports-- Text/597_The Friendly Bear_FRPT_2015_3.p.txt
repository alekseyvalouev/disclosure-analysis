Twinkies Vs. Freshpet: Moldgate Analysis Points To 75%+ Downside
May 14, 2015 9:03 AM ET8 comments
by: The Friendly Bear


Summary


Freshpet has now admitted to having mold in some of its products, but management
claimed that its "fresh" food is naturally susceptible to mold.


We question whether the "fresh" product designation is applicable for Freshpet given
its average product shelf life is reported to be 140 days (7-10x longer than milk).


The company attributed mold to bags being compromised during transit and stocking
- if this is true, we wonder why the company has not pulled defective bags from retail
shelves.


We found precedents of other pet food companies issuing recalls as a result of
excess moisture in packaging leading to the potential for mold growth.


Given the confirmation and (in our view) questionable explanation of mold, we see
75%+ downside (1.5x 2015 sales, a ~25% discount to pet food comps).


During Freshpet's (NASDAQ:FRPT) 1Q15 earnings call, the company acknowledged
consumer mold complaints but dismissed the concerns, claiming that the mold found in
some of their bags is part of the normal course of business for a "fresh" food company.
Management said their mold complaint rate is low and that the rate of mold complaints
has held steady for the last two years.


The company attributed the mold complaints to bags getting "treated incorrectly"
(described as a "bump or poke or cut") during shipping and handling.


We have real questions around this "bag flaw" explanation for the mold. First, we wonder
how well management can track mold if the issue is occurring during transit. Second,
Freshpet very recently claimed that there are no mold issues in its cat foods. The bags
Freshpet uses for its cat foods appear to be similar to those it uses for its dog foods.
Therefore, it is odd that cat foods are unaffected by mold. If the issue at hand is
occasional improper handling of bags, one would think this would impact all bags,
regardless of whether the contents are dog or cat related.

However, for the purposes of this article, we will take management at face value and
assume that mold is occurring due to bags being compromised in transit (in other words,
we will ignore the comment above, and also ignore the explosion of mold complaints on
Facebook since the beginning of 2015).


We share management's view that running a national fresh food operation is highly
challenging. We also think that management's claim speaks to the fundamental structural
flaw in Freshpet's business. In our view, running a sub-scale cold chain for "fresh" food out
of one single manufacturing facility in Bethlehem, PA is simply too operationally
challenging to pull off on a national scale without running into hiccups.


Given these bags are required to make the trip from Bethlehem, PA to locations across
the country, we have to ask - is it not the responsibility of the company to utilize a bag that
is able to withstand long mileage trips from the Freshpet Kitchen to the grocery store?


So here are the key questions we think the sell side should have asked on the call:


Is it not highly likely that bags will end up getting "bumped and poked" during
the ~2,800-mile trip from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania to Olympia, Washington?
Is something as benign as a "bump and poke" really causing the fabric of these
bags to become compromised?
If this is the case, could mold that is not visible to the naked eye be forming in
some of these compromised bags?


On the earnings call, CEO Richard Thompson drew an interesting analogy, in which he
remarked "we're not making Hostess Twinkies over here that last on a shelf for
years and years", implying that the manufacturer of the Twinkie has a huge "leg up"
against Freshpet in the ongoing battle against mold contamination.


So we decided to run a quick analysis comparing and contrasting Twinkies with Freshpet.

Our research on Twinkies was startling. There is a popular misconception that the
"processed ingredients" in Twinkies makes them expiration resistant. In reality, the shelf
life of Twinkies currently stands at 45 days.


So how does the "fresh" pet food sold by Freshpet stack up against the iconic Twinkie?


From a Forbes article in October 2014:


A big component of Freshpet's message to consumers is its focus on healthy
ingredients, as it doesn't use preservatives in the foods it produces. The Freshpet
items have a roughly 20-week shelf life, while most dry pet foods can sit on
shelves for years thanks to preservatives.


A twenty-week shelf life without any preservatives? That works out to 140 days. Now
THAT is truly disruptive. We cannot imagine that traditional fresh food products such as
milk can sit on shelves for almost half a year. According to this article, milk "sell-by" dates
vary state-by-state but can range from between 12 to 21 daysâ€¦ a fraction of the reported
140-day shelf life of Freshpet products.


Here is one potential idea. Based on company acknowledged incidences of mold and the
lack of artificial preservatives in Freshpet's products, perhaps the company should
consider rolling back the expiration date labels on its products? While this seems like a
rather easy potential solution to mold, it would likely annihilate the company's already
flimsy unit economics.

Summary


We are wondering why many on the sell side appear to have glossed over the mold issue
in their post-quarter notes. The sell side appears to have taken comfort in management's
claim that the mold issues impact only a very small percentage of bags. Below, we found a
few recalls related directly to mold formation in pet foods.


We wonder why Freshpet is not taking similar action in response to mold
complaints...


Iams "Potential for Mold Growth" Recall


Wellness Recall


Kong Recall (including company commentary below)


The products were not dried properly so a small percentage of finished goods have
gone moldy. Majority of the product is fine, and the mold was caught at our DC*, but
some product may have made it to PetSmart so we are recalling all the product at
PetSmart and destroying all the product we have at our DC.


We found this defense of Freshpet from a recent sell side report interesting:


Source: Baird Research


Given the reported 20-week average shelf life of Freshpet products, we conclude with one
simple question:


Is any amount of mold in unexpired/unopened packages ever acceptable for any
food brand, let alone a supposedly premium pet food brand?

You really dont like FRESHPET do you Bear? This is what, the 4th or 5th article you are talking doom and gloom and
bad company, when everyone else out there is saying good stuff about the company. 
BTW, I have seen the stockers in Target, slicing through the TAPE on the top of the box that holds 10-12 bags of food,
sliced right into the bags.... he then proceeded to put them in the fridge without a care in the world.

I urge anyone short or long to go into their local pet store and look for themselves. Can you see any visible mold? If
so, do you see any tears? Per the facebook posts, it sounds like the formula has changed.


@CarolineHiggins: Shorting is not stock manipulation. Without it, capital would be allocated a lot less efficiently. And
without forums like this, retail investors would lose a lot more money. That is a serious thing to accuse someone of
and you ought to report it to the SEC if you have evidence supporting your case. Otherwise, you're participating in the
defamation of The Friendly bear's character, which is not appreciated by the readers of this forum.


@Curtbass: This is the Friendly Bear's 3rd article (you said 4-5), and was additive given most viewers of this forum
likely didn't tune into the earnings call. Also, if by "everyone else" you mean "the market", then you are sorely
mistaken. In reality, the stock is down nearly 20% over the last month. Perhaps by "everyone else" you mean sell side
research analysts (including the group who handled FRPT's IPO to stave off bankruptcy) who are being paid by the
company and who aren't putting their money where their mouth is? Please elaborate or post a "buy" article if you have
a position and a substantive argument.


In an effort to add some transparency to these comments, I have an adorable puppy (ok she is 7Y old!) and I am also
short this stock. I shorted it at 22.5 and then purchased additional June put options at 22.5 when the stock eclipsed
$23.5 (briefly). I haven't exited out of the positions because I can't imagine this company gets acquired for more than
$7/share and think it's actually worth <$5.

The Facebook page is out of control. Looks like this weekend animals may have even gotten sick from eating the
food.


To the author: do you think that the management team is just trying to save face at this point in time by pretending like
there is no issue? They are saying no recall. Wouldn't the Board care first about preserving the integrity of the brand
before worrying about the financial costs of a recall? Insurance surely covers the cost of a recall?


There are also a bunch of suspicious shill looking posts popping up on the Facebook wall. If they don't want to
acknowledge the mold, why don't they just take down all these gross pictures of mold instead of having shills pop up
all over the place?

Freshpet $13 by August. Only a fool would buy this stock at these levels.

This concept is an excellent concept, but maybe the business model needs to change. The author definitely has a
point, and my own pooch threw up their chicken stew on several occasions, so I reported it to the company and got
some coupons, but it did make me suspicious about whether the chicken used in their food was really "fresh" (as my
pooch had not thrown up on previous occasions).


No, my idea for Freshpet is to let the consumer place regular orders for their food (at a discount to the store price of
course), and then ship some extra to the store as well. That way they can REALLY make sure that their product is
fresh!


Given that FRPT gets their act together on this one, I see this as a great buying opportunity!
