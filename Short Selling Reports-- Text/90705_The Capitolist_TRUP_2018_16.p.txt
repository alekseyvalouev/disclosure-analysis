TRUP


Synchrony (SYF), a consumer financial services company, purchased a pet
insurance company named "Pets Best" last week for an undisclosed sum.


I believe that we can triangulate an "upper bound" of $90m for the purchase price
of "Pets Best" that gives a relatively good comp for TRUP shares.


Pets Best has 125,000 pets under management (policy holders) which makes it
roughly 25% the size of TRUP.


If HSR is not triggered it suggests that the transaction is lower than $90m.


Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) is a pet insurance company that wall street wants to be a
SAAS company. According to the latest 10k TRUP has 430,770 covered lives in its
subscription business and is currently struggling to maintain its statutory capital ratios
(as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners).

More concerning is the inflated share price in the wake of a devastating comp provided
by the acquisition of "Pets Best" by Synchony Financial (SYF). Below I will detail how I
triangulate a likely upper bound to the purchase price, and thus the likely maximum
value of the TRUP subscription business as it sits today. My current estimate for the
purchase price of "Pets Best" is under $90m, which suggests that the TRUP
subscription business is worth $9.03/share.

There are three main points to discuss here:


The comp calculation shows that today, the purchaser of TRUP shares is paying for
the full value of the company AFTER it grows an additional 230%, and that fair
market value is ~69% below the closing price on Monday 3/11.


1.


It also highlights that potential acquirers have the option of buying smaller companies
for MUCH lower valuations without giving up too much in terms of scale.


2.


The SYF transaction permanently damages any moat around the TRUP sales
channel (which I have voiced opinions against from a regulatory standpoint), whether
I'm right or wrong about the legality of the sales tactics is now irreverent as SYF is far
more penetrated into the sales channel then TRUP is.

What Happened?


The Comp is Really Bad


Last week Synchrony Financial (SYF) bought Pets Best insurance for an undisclosed
sum. According to Veterinary News the acquisition will create a competitive advantage
for SYF by pairing the insurance arm with the Credit arm of SYF. For its part "Pets Best"
looks like a worthy competitor to TRUP and thus a reasonable comp as well.

Although the price of the acquisition of "Pets Best" is not disclosed SYF did disclose that
they have 125,000 covered lives under management. and according to Heart-Scott-
Rodino ("HSR") thresholds SYF would have forced to file for approval if the transaction
was at or over $90m.

The FTC offers a Docket of all companies that have applied for and received clearance
for their transaction under an early termination notice (LINK HERE). The early
termination program exists to help speed up the review process for transactions that
meet the threshold in dollar terms but are not likely to fail the various other tests that
would hold up a transaction (more info HERE).


Importantly there is no approval for the SYF /"Pets Best" transaction, which suggests to
me that there is a great likelihood that the transaction itself was priced under the
threshold. If so we can conclude that $90m is the maximum that SYF paid for 125,000
covered lives AND the "Pets Best" brand.

Re-posted from above we can see that the $90m maximum buy out price yields a value
of $720/pet. This implies that TRUP's subscription business is worth roughly
$9.03/share or a 69% discount to its current stock price.


Even TRUP thinks the pets are only worth about $720/pet... according to the latest
press release the company itself values the LTV of their pets at $710/pet (below). The
conclusion here is something that insurance investors have known all along, you are
worth your assets and in this case that's ~$9/share.

The Moat Is GONE


Conclusion


Although it is possible that SYF did not use the early termination program to close this
transaction I can't think of a good reason not to. I think the bulls are going to need to
prove that the transaction was anywhere near the ~$300m it would need to be to justify
the current TRUP stock price. Personally, I stand by the assertion that $9.03/share is the
maximum value of the subscription business today based off of the "Pets Best" comp
and the 3x book value I have subscribed to for months.


At the Bank of America conference a few weeks ago TRUP's comments about the
importance of their "Moat" in the veterinarian channel were unequivocal:


"Today, we have about 105 Territory Partners visiting about 21,000 clinics. It has taken
me 18 years to build out that sales force who now have made over 1 million face-to-face
visits with veterinarians, on average about 80,000 to 90,000 visits per year. The
relationships with the veterinarians is the most difficult, hardest thing to copy." - Darryl
Rawlings 2/25/19


This is not good... SYF is far more penetrated in the Vet Channel


To help understand how badly this "Moat" argument has been eroded we only need to
look at TRUP's claim in the Q3 earnings call:


How many clinics use Trupanion Express to pay for claims, meaning what is the
penetration rate for Trupanion Express in the payment processing side of the
veterinarian business?


From 11/08/2018 earnings call they say 3,000/28,000 = 10.7%


SYF Claims to have 22,000 clinics using its Care Credit to process claims
(22,000/28,000 = 78.5% penetration -- 7x that of TRUP)

The comp speaks for itself at ~$9/share in underlying value, however the competitive
aspect of this transaction is drastically under appreciated by the sell side. Two quotes
form the SYF press release stand out:

My translation is simple: everything TRUP says it does we do better with far more

ease of claims processing for the plan holder. Just look at how integrated the Care
