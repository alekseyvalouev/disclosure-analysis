Is China Sky Crocker Coulson’s Latest Movie
Production?


Posted on June 17, 2009 by Asensio.com


Crocker Coulson is a Yale-grad turned journalist, turned film-maker,


turned investor relations representative for companies such as


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI).


Coulson is president of CCG Investor Relations, the firm which is


apparently retained to represent China Sky and many other US-


listed Chinese companies. By our count, Coulson has represented


more than 50 Chinese reverse-mergers through CCG and his


previous firm. Among them are such penny stocks as Gold Horse


International Inc. (OTC: GHII $0.18), China Yingxia International,


Inc. (OTC: CYXI $0.05), and Fuda Faucet Works Inc. (OTC: FUFW


$0.08).


Crocker Coulson’s brother Cromwell Coulson is the chairman and


CEO of Pink Sheets LLC, the market maker for OTC stocks. Like his


brother, Cromwell does not seem to shun publicity.


Crocker Coulson also represented four of the seven Chinese


companies mentioned for having deficient auditors in the Barron’s


story, “Who’s Minding the Minders of Chinese Accounting?”: CSKI,


CPSL, CCGY, and CEUA.


In an investor presentation from February, 2009, entitled “Small


Cap China Hell,” Coulson lists the many problems with Chinese


companies listing in the US. Among them are the “Take the Money


and Run Syndrome” and “Related Party and Insider Shenanigans.”


Among the more interesting statements in the presentation are that


‘Overly aggressive “make goods” encourage accounting fraud.’ By


coincidence, China Sky had a ‘make good’ agreement as part of its


January 2008 PIPE offering, which supposedly played a part in


China Sky’s delay in filing its 2008 Form 10-K.


Asensio has a
remarkedly
strong record in
picking shorts.
[….] For that
talent, one
company has
called him ‘one
of the world’s
best-known
short sellers.’

Unlike many outsourced IR representatives, Coulson seems to have


unusual authority in corporate communications for China Sky. In


the company’s first quarter conference call, Coulson actually


interjected in management’s explanation of why they won’t be


changing auditors to offer investors his own explanation – a highly


irregular step for any IR executive, let alone an outsourced


representative. Making such statements in a conference call is


typically only done by senior executive officers, not by someone


representing the company under terms which are not disclosed to


investors.


Coulson’s promotional material also goes above and beyond what


you might expect, crossing the boundaries from the carefully


worded disclaimers used by IR professionals. His latest “China


Rising” newsletter seems partly an effort at journalism, partly


investment recommendation, while much of it promotes China Sky


and the Chinese health care sector – all while not directly disclosing


that China Sky is a client.


Investors in China Sky and other companies represented by Coulson


are advised to watch out for the “Take the Money and Run


Syndrome.”
