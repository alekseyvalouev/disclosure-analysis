Coffee Holdings: Overvalued at Current Prices

Non-recurring gains mask earnings decay; insiders now dumping at inflated prices


On July 15, 2011 we stated that we established a short position in shares of Coffee
Holdings (NASDAQ:JVA) at $22.30.


In response to the wild ride in the share price of JVA over the last four months (up 650%
from trough to peak), the GeoTeam decided to take a closer look. After careful research,
we have concluded that the company is dangerously overvalued at current prices.
The stock appears to have rallied as a result of what we suspect were unnoticed and
consider to be non-operating items in its fiscal 2011 quarterly earnings reports. These
items may have created the appearance of strong earnings growth when in fact it seems
apparent that core earnings are decaying. The following summarizes our obs.


Regarding earnings comparisons...


The stock surged in response to its 2Q 2011 earnings press release in which the company
reported apparent strong net income growth of 47% from the previous year's same
quarter.


To the contrary, for the same time period, if we remove the gains from the company's
earnings, as would be appropriate for unpredictable non-recurring items, the earnings
actually declined year over year by 37%. Repeat: they declined.


Regarding the use of options and futures contracts...


In their press releases, we believe that management failed to effectively communicate
to the market that the net income growth in both quarters was essentially entirely a result
of gains made through the purchase and sale of options and futures contracts to manage
the purchase of coffee.


In FY2008 and 2Q 2008, when JVA reported huge losses that created the (false)
appearance of a rapidly decaying business, the company very clearly communicated to
investors in its earnings press releases that the losses resulted specifically from non-
recurring losses on options and futures contracts. To quote the FY2008 earnings press
release:

We had a net loss of ($2,597,294), or ($0.47) per share (basic and diluted) for the
year ended October 31, 2008 compared to net income of $937,316 or $.17 per share
(basic and diluted) for the year ended October 31, 2007. The decrease in net income
primarily reflects hedging losses when the price of coffee surged to a ten year high
and subsequently collapsed during February and October 2008.


Now that the company has found itself in the reverse situation, with options and futures
contracts leading to non-recurring profits that have created the (false) appearance of
attractive earnings growth, the company has decided to say nothing in its earnings
press releases, paving the way for the stock to rally on hype and hot air. We find this lack
of clarity and consistency in press release disclosure to be both opportunistic and
troubling. Shame on management.


Regarding insider selling...


Even more troubling is the fact that management is now capitalizing on the stock’s
questionable price surge by dumping shares as the stock has rallied. On July 11th, the
CEO sold $3.37MM worth of shares in the open market at prices ranging from $23.01 to
$25.81.


As if that weren’t enough, on the same day, the Vice President sold another $3.36MM
worth of shares.


Regarding coffee prices...


Coffee prices are currently tapering off of an all-time 30 year high. Unless investors think
that coffee prices are going to infinity, then these gains are non-recurring.


Conclusion


If we apply an extremely generous P/E multiple of 30 to JVA’s trailing 12-month taxed
operating EPS of 0.217 (excluding gains from purchases and sales of options and futures
contracts, and applying a 36% tax rate), JVA's fair value would be $6.50. Given that...


the company’s year over year recurring earnings growth is negative,
management appears to be inconsistent in terms of what it emphasizes in press
releases, and
most importantly, insiders are dumping their shares on the open market,

...we think a lower P/E may be appropriate. We believe that analyst fiscal (ending
October) 2012 EPS growth estimates of less than 10% further support our lower P/E
assumption. Note that on July 21, 2011 the stock closed at $21.26. We believe that the
market will eventually share our conclusions. As for those traders and investors who
appear to have bought into this name on a misunderstanding, it could be a very painful
move down.


Investors should note that JVA has a small float and should expect high volatility in the
company's shares as market dynamics play out.


Please see our full update.


Disclosure: I am short JVA.

I will be the first to post on this article. Everything that you have said maybe true however all that you have said is
already priced into the stock and the PPS has alraedy stabilized. There are other areas of the balancesheet and
Cashflow statements that looks promising going forward. Therefore to bail out on a company that is in a growing
sector and has reported two consecutive positive earnings regardless of the fact that if they were purely based on
futures is completely irrational.

Care to provide your own fundamental valuation for JVA?

Author’s reply »  Amcsulb,


You really think a P/E of over 30 has priced a zero EPS growth EPS assumption into the stock? Our rationale
is based on finance 101 fundamentals. JVA real EPS is showing anemic growth.. Plain and simple..


Do you really mean what you say here: 
"Therefore to bail out on a company that is in a growing sector and has reported two consecutive positive
earnings regardless of the fact that if they were purely based on futures is completely irrational."


You can't be serious.. What is irrational by any standard is to value a company based on non-operating data
points. It doesn't matter that a company is in a high growth industry if it can't grow without using smoke and
mirrors.

JVA shares rose purely because of investor ignorance based on EPS numbers thought to be clean. In fact,
we too bought shares and made good money on the long side. We will let the market decide what to do with
JVA. Sometimes ignorance pans out. But we try to base investment decisions on the facts.

How interesting that you, shorting JVA, left out the fact that 47% of JVA's business is directly tied to GMCR. 
Inconsistent press releases, according to you, are a reason that this is a $6.50 stock. I have great difficulty with this
"reason". You have clearly cherry-picked information to support your article. There is little doubt that you want the
price of JVA to move lower.  
Insider selling is another reason for this stock to be valued at $6.50. The question is not how many shares were sold,
rather, how many shares are owned by the two gentlemen you cited? Is there anything wrong with taking profit when
the stock is at an all-time high? 
I am long JVA. I, too, sold shares at $28.50.  
Perhaps if you were not shorting the stock in question your views would be more credible. Just my opinion.

GMCR has accounting issues. If 50% is tied to GMCR, that a negative, not a positive.

Author’s reply »  Deer. Read the report carefully. The reason we shorted was due to weak EPS growth. Do
you think that matters? As I said we were long at one point, but the facts have changed. And.. I agree with
you.. If I was a JVA insider I would have sold too into this gift rally.


Now if JVA comes out next quarter and reports real EPS growth we may go long. It is that simple. But analyst
estimates do not indicate this to be the trend. You should actually contact the analyst and ask him if he
believes hedging gains should be looked at as "clean".

I understand why you are short JVA, my point is simply this: If one is shorting a stock, it is my opinion that
they should not author an article on that stock.


I give you credit for disclosing that you are short JVA. Too often articles hammer a stock and it appears the
author is short, but they fail to disclose this fact.


I completely agree that JVA's outlook has changed and I see the reasoning behind your short. As I stated, I
am long JVA and took a nice profit at $28.50. Clearly they will struggle to see that number in the near future.

Thank you for your comment. I always appreciate direct communication with the author. Not all SA authors
take the time to respond.

re you still short or covered your position? You let us know when you shorted, so it is good to post if you
coverd as well.


What do you think about the shelf offering?

GMCR shows no signs of "accounting issues", as you state. JVA's contract with them is connected with SBUX as well.
I am guessing that this is viewed as a negative by you also. 
There is no question that 47% of JVA's business is with GMCR, so there is no need to wonder "if". 
Perhaps if you were an investor of JVA at $3, as I am, you would view the dramatic increase as something that
doesn't happen to most stocks. I see nothing negative about a company that has made investors quite a bit of money
in a very short time. 
Those who have tried to short JVA have been fighting a losing battle. The author disclosed, appropriately so, that they
are sort JVA. I question the negative tone of the article and also question the motive. 
Thanks for you comment. I would like to know more about the "issues" you refer to.

GMCR has absolutely no accounting issues, but the link still appears to be a negative for JVA. GMCR is growing
exponentially. Eventually they will start to rethink why JVAs profit should be part of their expense base. In other words,
the relationship may have worked as a way to variabilize costs for a smaller GMCR, but now that they're an 800
pound coffee gorilla, they may be looking at ways to in-source JVAs function.

deercreekvols
Thank you for explaining why JVA may not continue to benefit from their contract with GMCR. This reasoning makes
sense given the small size of JVA.  
It is too bad the author could not have explained things as clearly as you did. I appreciate your comment.
