Five Below: New Morgan Stanley Initiation Relatively Lukewarm To
FIVE's Valuation
Jun. 30, 2014 9:00 AM ET3 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


FIVE's valuation multiples are higher than historical multiples of other successful
concepts in their growth phases. We compare FIVE's multiples to those of several
brands highlighted by a sellside analyst.


Morgan Stanley's initiating coverage report last week is relatively bearish. Given lack
of secular growth drivers and valuation above high-growth peers, MS does not
believe FIVE's current valuation is compelling.


Teen retail faces numerous headwinds, with too many specialty retailers competing
for teen discretionary spending. Many teen retailers are closing stores and trying to
recover from SSS declines in 2013.


FIVE will face increasing threats from e-commerce. It has mistimed its plans to build
a national brick-and-mortar business as the industry experiences a paradigm shift
towards consumers shopping more online.


Introduction


Over the past month, we published reports highlighting how Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE)
is an overhyped retailer that's unlikely to meet the lofty expectations baked into its inflated
valuation multiples. In our first article, we showed how the company operates in a crowded
and increasingly competitive sector where expansion by rivals will likely pressure margins,
returns on capital and long-term growth rates. The company has been witnessing
declining same-store sales growth, and margins currently stand at inflated levels relative
to other dollar stores. When compared with other fast-growing retailers, FIVE's valuation
multiples stand out as outliers.


In our second article, we highlighted how the specialty retail sector, as a whole,
consistently disappoints investors due to unforeseen competition. We provided numerous
examples of busted retail IPOs that failed to live up to their hype, and provided case
studies illustrating how specialty retailers' profits can be decimated quickly through
competition.

In this, our third article, we highlight further issues with FIVE's valuation. Even if FIVE is
able to achieve its growth plan, we believe the current valuation is so far above fair value
that investors are still likely to earn a sub-par return.


FIVE's Valuation Is So High it Exceeds the High Growth-Stage Multiples of Even
Extremely Successful Retailers


As we previously highlighted in our second article on FIVE, specialty retailers tend to have
a typical lifecycle: when a concept is new, it achieves high same-store sales growth, high
unit growth and expanding margins in the early years of its lifecycle. However, in specialty
retail this period tends to last only a short while, and is generally followed by a contraction
in revenue and margins in later years as competitors copy successful themes, execution
becomes more difficult with a larger store base, and maturing stores begin showing
pedestrian operating metrics.


The probability that FIVE's concept generates long-lasting, sustainable profits is incredibly
low, no different than other case studies we highlighted such as Francesca's, Tilly's or
Denninghouse.


However, even if we assume that FIVE does become one of the small percentage of
emerging concepts that transforms itself into a mature retailer with sustainable margins
and growth rates, FIVE still appears overvalued when compared to historical players, and
few successful retailers have ever traded at valuations as high as FIVE's current levels at
this point in their growth trajectories.


For instance, let's compare FIVE to several successful concepts cited by a bullish sellside
analyst. In its initiating coverage report from February, Janney Capital wrote:


Our fair value is $45/share, based on a 50x P/E multiple, and a 24x EV/EBITDA
multiple on our 2014 estimates (FY15). Although the valuation is above its peers,
this growth has proven worthy of this premium in the past, as we saw with fast
growing companies like CAKE, PNRA, and PF Chang's in the early 2000s, which
traded at high multiples due to predictable growth despite more modest comp
trends. - Janney Capital 2/05/2014


Below is a chart comparing FIVE's current revenue multiple of 3.5x EV / LTM revenue to
the revenue multiples of The Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE), Panera Bread
(NASDAQ:PNRA) and P.F. Chang's over the past 10 years. As shown below, FIVE trades

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2292345-five-below-new-morgan-stanley-initiation-relatively-lukewarm-to-fives-valuation 3/14


at a revenue multiple substantially above any revenue multiple seen at those other
successful concepts over the past ten years.


Next, let's compare cash flow multiples of FIVE to PNRA, CAKE and P.F. Chang's. Rather
than using P/E multiples, which can be distorted by non-operating charges and variances
in capital structures, we will compare EV / EBITDA multiples. FIVE's current EV / EBITDA
multiple is a staggering 35% higher than the highest multiple achieved by any of these
comparables over the past 10 years.


Yet despite trading at lower multiples over the past decade, these companies have
achieved better or comparable unit growth, same store sales growth and profit margins.
Below we compare FIVE to PNRA, CAKE and P.F. Chang's on four metrics: unit growth,
same-store sales growth, EBITDA margins and total revenue growth.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2292345-five-below-new-morgan-stanley-initiation-relatively-lukewarm-to-fives-valuation 4/14


During the early years of our data set, we see comparable metrics amongst all the
companies, yet materially lower multiples for PNRA, CAKE and P.F. Chang's when
compared to the current valuation multiple of FIVE.


Store Unit Growth (Y-o-Y) Same-Store Sales Growth (Y-o-Y)


EBITDA Margin Revenue Growth


In later years, as these concepts matured, store unit growth declined and revenue growth
slowed materially, leading to the eventual decline of valuation multiples. We expect to see
a similar pattern for FIVE as it has already exhibited declining overall sales growth, same-
store sales growth and store unit growth.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2292345-five-below-new-morgan-stanley-initiation-relatively-lukewarm-to-fives-valuation 5/14


Additionally, we would note one important distinction between a discount retailer like FIVE,
and fast-growing concepts like PNRA, CAKE and PF Chang's; the comparables are food
retailers, whereas FIVE is a discount retailer. Though the dining industry is incredibly
competitive, restaurants can be significantly more differentiated than discount retailers.
There is a discernible difference between eating a burrito at a Chipotle versus a Taco Bell,
just as there is a discernible difference between eating at a Panera Bread as compared
with the local deli.


However, in discount retail, the differences between competitors are much less, whether
we're comparing dollar stores like Dollar General and Family Dollar, or drugstores like Rite
Aid and Duane Reade. Rather than relying on competitive advantages like trending
products or better-tasting food, discount retailers typically compete on location and price,
the latter of which is typically a function of scale advantages and being a lower cost
operator. In this respect, a discount retailer like FIVE is more poorly positioned to expand
nationally while maintaining 14% EBITDA margins and attractive same-store sales growth,
as compared to PNRA, CAKE or PF Chang's.


Since FIVE has limited sustainable advantage in cost (when compared to other dollar
stores, for example) and merchandise (when compared to a Zara, for instance, which
produces its own products), FIVE's operations are more replicable than the restaurant
chains we've been highlighting. In fact, as we discussed in our first article, Dollar General
has already stated its intention to copy some of FIVE's successful aspects, and FIVE's
same-store-sales growth has already begun to slow, and earlier in its lifecycle than the
restaurant comps mentioned in the Janney report.


Recent Initiating Coverage Report by Morgan Stanley Relatively Bearish


Last week, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) launched coverage of FIVE with an equal-weight
rating and $41.00 price target, and wrote a 20-page initiating report that elaborated on
numerous obstacles FIVE will face as it tries to grow into its 50x+ LTM P/E multiple.
Although Morgan Stanley's official rating on FIVE is "equal-weight", we interpreted the
report to be relatively bearish on the company, given that sellside equity analysts rarely
issue "Sell" ratings, especially in initiating coverage reports. Reading between the lines,
we believe that Morgan Stanley agrees with us that FIVE's valuation multiples are
stretched and that there exists considerable potential downside for the stock.


The main thrust of MS's report is that although FIVE is growing nicely, its growth prospects
are sufficiently reflected in the stock's high valuation. In its introductory subheading, MS
ends with "at 34x 2015e P/E and a PEG of 1.1x, we believe [the company's growth]



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MS
5/23/2018 Five Below: New Morgan Stanley Initiation Relatively Lukewarm To FIVE's Valuation - Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2292345-five-below-new-morgan-stanley-initiation-relatively-lukewarm-to-fives-valuation 6/14


potential is largely priced in."


We believe MS expressed concerns on a number of fronts.


With respect to the company's fickle teen end-market, MS noted that if FIVE fails to spot a
trend, the company's results could suffer, which we've also previously highlighted. MS
wrote that "if FIVE misses its second to market goal with a trend, sales could be lost."
Later in the report, continuing on the topic of management's ability to remain on top of
trends, MS wrote "there can be blips along the way, as evidenced by 4Q13 results which
fell short of original guidance. Even during 3Q, which had comp upside, management
noted that Black Friday fell short of its internal expectations."


MS also addressed the debate of whether FIVE's product line is sufficiently differentiated.
While it noted that FIVE has carved out a niche in catering to the teenage end market,
"similar products are available at a variety of other outlets, including big box retailers,
discounters, independents and online, amongst others."


Morgan Stanley also noted the weak consumer environment for teen-focused retailers,
writing:


"Teen backdrop not ideal right now, though FIVE's value focus is 'in trend.' We
think FIVE caters to its demographic well, with its value-focused price points and
creative product assortment. That said, should the macro backdrop for the segment
worsen, we believe there could be a pull-back in sales given the discretionary nature
of Five Below's merchandise."

24 2014


Teen retailing has been a weak sector for quite some time now, and is certainly not a
secular growth story within retail. We address the macro headwinds for teen retail later in
this article.


Morgan Stanley discusses how the high expectations baked into the company's valuation
could result in substantial downside volatility in response to adverse events. For instance,
when FIVE lowered guidance in January 2014, the stock declined 13% on that day,
highlighting the sharp losses FIVE investors can suffer when FIVE shows signs that it may
not meet the market's lofty growth forecasts.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2292345-five-below-new-morgan-stanley-initiation-relatively-lukewarm-to-fives-valuation 7/14


"High growth nature = high expectations = good chance for volatility.


Exemplified by its already premium multiple, we think the high growth nature of FIVE
demonstrates that investors' expectations for the company are also high. As such,
we do think there is a good chance for volatility around data points, either positively
or negatively….


As referenced above, in relation to the company's recent 4Q results, the stock
reacted negatively following FIVE's lowered guidance in January 2014. The
company guided 4Q results down to a negative comp, which would have been Five
Below's first as a public company. Ultimately the company posted a +0.3% comp for
the quarter. While results were ahead of lowered expectations, we note that earnings
were still well below original guidance."

24 2014


Like us, Morgan Stanley appears concerned that FIVE's valuation is simply too high,
despite the company's operating momentum. Under the heading "Growth potential
appears priced in at current valuation", MS writes "at 34x [forward] P/E versus a post-IPO
average of 43x and a PEG of 1.1x, we believe [the company's growth] potential is largely
priced in."


Morgan Stanley ends its report with a relatively bearish statement, when viewed in the
context of the typically rose-colored glasses of a sellside analyst:


"Given the lack of secular growth drivers and a valuation above the high-growth peer
average, we do not believe current valuation is compelling for FIVE."


Teen Retailing Backdrop Unhealthy


One of the headwinds facing Five Below is that its key end market, teenagers, remains
among the weakest demographics in retail. As we can see below, more than 50% of the
company's customers are teens, pre-teens and their parents:

Teen retail has been facing significant secular challenges. For instance, in its June 3rd
report "Apparel Retail - The Mall Manual / June Edition: Teen Retail Down and Out… But
Probably Not Forever", RBC wrote:


"Forgive us for stating the obvious but the teen space has likely been the most
difficult and challenged sub-sector of apparel over the last year and a half. Teen
retail is not alone in its underperformance, as the softlines sector overall has
struggled, but it has clearly been hit hardest."

In its review of first quarter results for teen retailing, entitled "Retailing/Specialty Stores:
Smells Like Teen Spirit... What We Learned From 1Q Reporting", Jefferies also
highlighted the sector's negative trends. Its first two points in the report's "10 Key
Takeaways from 1Q Reporting" were:


1) It's Not Pretty Out There... 1Q results were tough with sales subdued and gross
margins compressing further as mall traffic was weak and promotions were high,
though much of this was to be expected.


2) 2Q Outlooks Not Good... Coming into 2014, we had initially thought that 1Q
would mark a trough in teen sector fundamentals. This proved not to be the case, as
2Q guidance was fairly downbeat.


Jefferies, "Retailing/Specialty Stores: Smells Like Teen Spirit... What We Learned
From 1Q Reporting", June 3 2014


Jefferies further discussed how teen retailers are closing stores at a breakneck pace,
writing:


"Store Closures Mounting... Teen retailers are projecting even greater numbers of
store closures, which will help balance supply with reduced (and soon stabilizing)
demand. We continue to believe 30% of store supply could come out of the teen
retail market over the next 3 years."


While FIVE is rapidly expanding its unit count, other retailers that cater to the teen
demographic are shrinking their store base. Abercrombie (NYSE:ANF) has announced
plans to close 60-70 stores in 2014, Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO) has identified at least 175
stores to close, and Wet Seal (NASDAQ:WTSL) has announced plans to close 14-18
stores upon lease expiration. Other teen retailers like Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN)
have slowed store growth dramatically, with URBN's 2013 square footage growth only
amounting to 6%, as compared to 15% to 20% between 2005 to 2007, and 8% to 10% in
2011-2012.


The adverse trends within teen retail can be seen in the same-store sales declines of
some of the largest publicly traded teen-focused specialty retailers. Below is an analysis
by KeyBanc:

The same-store sales reversals range from a 3% decline at Buckle (NYSE:BKE) in the
holiday quarter of fiscal year 2013 to 15% declines at WTSL and ARO.


The causes of the teen retail downturn have been numerous, including competitive threats
from e-commerce, persistently high teen unemployment, and an oversaturated sector
replete with simply too many specialty retailers vying for teen discretionary spending. To
make matters worse, KeyBanc also notes that overall teen population growth has been
stagnant in the United States:


"The teen population has seen little growth in the last 10+ years. While the number
of teen retail stores has significantly expanded, the actual teen population (U.S.
population between 15-19 years old) has been relatively stagnant. From 1990-2012,
the teen population grew at an annual rate of +0.8%, and only 0.4% from 2005-2012,
well below the 5.2% annual adjusted square footage growth in the teen space."


KeyBanc, "Overstored Teen Retailing: Softlines and REIT Perspectives", March 19
2014


Source: KeyBanc, U.S. Census Bureau


The competitive pressures within the teen retail sector present obstacles to FIVE, whose
stores cater to teenagers and their parents, as it attempts to grow rapidly enough to justify
50x P/E and 3.5x EV / revenue valuation multiples.

Brick-and-Mortar to Online: A Paradigm Shift


And I think this part of my remarks are very important. Over the last month or so, I've
heard many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers attribute the downturn in their core
business during holidays to factors such as a shortened holiday shopping season, a
weakened consumer, the U.S. government shutdown… Respectfully, those
explanations ignore a larger fundamental truth. And that truth is that traditional
brick-and-mortar retailing is at an inflection point. No longer are many retailers
only required to compete with stores on the other side of the street. They are now
required to compete with stores on the other side of the country. Navigating
this seismic shift will continue to be very, very difficult for many. - Howard D.
Schultz, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Starbucks Corp. on 01/23/2014 Earnings
Call


Over the past few years, we've seen retailers from Staples to Abercrombie closing
numerous brick-and-mortar (B&M) locations due to the growing threat of online e-
commerce companies such as Amazon.com. We believe that FIVE has mistimed its plans
to build a national brick-and-mortar discount retail business as the industry is experiencing
a paradigm shift of consumers increasingly shopping online. While we admit that the retail
B&M industry will not go away entirely, we do believe the environment will be increasingly
difficult for newer retailers such as FIVE who only operate B&M locations, particularly as
companies such as Amazon.com and Walmart.com can offer similar inventory.

According to this WSJ article, e-commerce has resulted not only in reduced retail foot
traffic, but also in less and less new retail space opened annually. Given these facts
coupled with the numerous store closings by some of the nation's largest retailers, we
believe that FIVE underestimates the growing e-commerce threat.


Decline of Retail Foot Traffic and New Retail Space Opened Annually


While FIVE could launch its own e-commerce platform, the management team does not
seem to be focused on that front. On its latest earnings call, the CEO largely ignored an
analyst's question about its digital strategy.


The other piece is what does a company at some point do with somewhat of an
online strategy, which is a great question, but is one really that I don't think we are
prepared to discuss today, while it may be a great opportunity at some point. -

Comments (3)


Overall, we believe that FIVE's plan to grow as a B&M retailer is poorly timed. We expect
margins and growth to come under pressure as even larger and more established retailers
have succumbed to the e-commerce threat.


Conclusion


As we have highlighted in our past three articles, we believe FIVE is a grossly overvalued
retailer with limited sustainable advantages and pricing power.


It operates in a sector catering to a struggling consumer demographic, teenagers. While
other teen retailers are reducing store counts and square footage, FIVE is rapidly
expanding. At the same time, FIVE's overall industry, brick-and-mortar retailing, is facing
competitive pressures from Amazon and other forms of e-commerce, which is decimating
industry stalwarts like Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) and Staple's (NASDAQ:SPLS). Yet FIVE
continues to rapidly expand, increasing its store count at a 20%+ clip.


Despite industry headwinds, FIVE trades at valuation multiples that even the few specialty
retailers that have been able to expand nationally rarely or never traded at.


It's no surprise to us, then, that the most recent sellside analyst to launch coverage on the
company gave FIVE a relatively lukewarm review, citing that the current valuation is not
"compelling". Not only do we deem FIVE's 50x+ LTM P/E and 3.5x EV/revenue multiple
less than compelling, but we think that the stock is an attractive short and will likely
disappoint long investors who are ascribing growth rates too lofty for the company to
achieve.

Seems like your argument is a bit redundant . The growth in fact does appear to be sustainable. The model returns
the invested capital on a new unit in one year. At that rate it appears very sustainable. Your argument is developed
using retail concepts that are not consistent with the marketing approach and product lines that are making this a
successful enterprise. Sorry it looks like a bogus straw man argument that you are making. It really will play out as the
results continue to beat street expectations. Certainly they are going to beat your expectations.So far we are doing
better than you on this investment and we see retail results improving in the second half even for some of your
comparative companies that you incorrectly model against Five Below.

Comparing apparel retailers such as Abercrombie, Wet Seal and Aeropostale to Five Below is both asinine and has
no correlation at all. Abercrombie doesn't follow a trend. They sell California "surfer" clothes. They don't follow the
trends and thats why these retailers fail.


Five Below follows trends. Their is risk with the possibility of unsold inventory, but they stock so few items (with the
exception of your iPhone chargers and cases which are always in demand) that this isn't a huge problem.


An example of why Five Below is successful and will always be successful is they sell name brand at a low cost. Walk
into a Wal-Mart and buy a Wilson basketball and you won't be able to get it for less than $10. It comes in a box,
already pumped up, etc. Five Below orders Wilson basketballs un-inflated, and without the box significantly decreases
costs and allowing them to sell for under $5. Employees pump up the basketballs in the store and place them in a
basket. What's the first thing a kid wants to do when he sees a basketball? Dribble it. Can't do that when it's in a box
like at Wal-Mart. You can at Five Below.


They are in top tier power centers with the likes of Targets, Ulta, TJ Maxx, Ross, etc and continue to do so. They open
heavily in markets (opened 8 stores on the same day in Texas) to garner maximum exposure and save costs on
marketing.


Landlords want Five Below in their center. They don't want Dollar Tree's or Family Dollar or Dollar General.
Completely different companies and viewpoints from the customers perspective.


Your basis of analysis is thorough and impressive. But comparing this concept to any failing retailer doesn't make any
sense. Coach was the hot stock 2 years ago and now they'll be out of business in 5 years whilst Michael Kors is the
hot name. They'll be irrelevant soon as well once every women see's a girl with a MK purse and wants the new "hip"
item.


Five Below can cater to this by going and following the trends and not sticking with a product that may be hot at one
point, but will most certainly fail within a couple of years.
