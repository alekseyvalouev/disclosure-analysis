Keyw: Cyber Security Inferiority And Looming Dilutive Equity Raise,
Reiterate Strong Sell
Jun. 12, 2014 9:08 AM ET37 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Channel checks with cyber security competitors reveals credible competitors have
never even heard of KEYW.


KEYW needs to raise equity to remain solvent, up to 36% dilution coming according
to SEC registration filings.


KEYW commentary implies weak 2Q, dilution will probably occur before the end of
July to avoid further stock price declines on weak revenue trends.


Highly credible competitors have strong venture backing and partnerships that
KEYW lacks.


Recent attempts to pump the stock have fallen flat and large institutions are
aggressively selling KEYW shares.


Keyw Corp. (NASDAQ:KEYW) likes to tout its alleged "cyber superiority" in press
releases. I set out to evaluate these claims by discussing KEYW's products with
competitors already established in the cyber security business. I found that KEYW is far
behind its competitors in every relevant category: R&D spending, partnerships,
functionality, and most importantly, revenue.


As a reminder, KEYW has virtually no cyber revenue - this is in contrast to FireEye
(NASDAQ:FEYE), which has over $200mm in last 12 month revenue, a number that has
grown rapidly, unlike KEYW's declining cyber revenue. In fact, KEYW's cyber revenue only
accounts for approximately 3% of its total revenue, roughly 1/20th that of FEYE.


This lack of meaningful revenue and unimpressive growth might not be too concerning for
a startup company under other circumstances - what makes it a problem for KEYW is the
company is late to the party and faces an uphill battle against entrenched competitors with
more resources.


KEYW likes the comparisons some have drawn between it and FEYE, comparisons that I
have explained are completely nonsensical (see my prior report on KEYW here). In fact,
FEYE doesn't even mention KEYW as a competitor in its 10-K - apparently KEYW is not

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265613-keyw-cyber-security-inferiority-and-looming-dilutive-equity-raise-reiterate-strong-sell 2/17


even on the radar for FEYE. Furthermore, FEYE will have 2014 R&D spending of 40-43%
of its estimated ~$410 million 2014 revenue - this is in the neighborhood of $170mm of
R&D for next year alone while KEYW is teetering on the edge of violating debt covenants
and possible bankruptcy.


How does KEYW stack up? Quoting from the KEYW 10-K:


In 2013, we spent approximately $7.5 million, or 2.5% of revenue on R&D. For 2014
we are budgeting 2.5% - 3.0% of revenue for R&D. R&D spending increased in 2013
and we expect it to be flat or increase slightly in 2014."


I estimate this to be roughly $7.5mm again - 3% of my $250mm sales forecast for 2014
(remember, based on Q1 and Q2 guidance, KEYW's revenue is declining). So FEYE will
likely outspend KEYW in 2014 by a factor of ~23x on R&D. Regardless of where KEYW is
today (and it seems quite clear to me they are not even on the map yet), there is simply no
way for KEYW to compete with FEYE long-term with that kind of R&D spending
differential.


Furthermore, it's clear after even a cursory look that FEYE has a substantially better
management team than KEYW. Let's look, for example, at FEYE CEO David DeWalt's
biography (pulled directly from CapIQ):


Background: Mr. David G. DeWalt, also known as Dave, has been the Chief
Executive Officer at FireEye, Inc. since November 28, 2012. Mr. DeWalt serves as a
Senior Advisor of Silver Lake Partners. He is based out of the Menlo Park office of
Silver Lake Partners. He has more than 25 years of experience building innovative,
industry-leading technology companies. He has a strong record of driving revenue
growth at startups, midsize, and large companies, and has helped create more than
$10 Billion in shareholder value thru a series of CEO-led industry changing major
acquisitions.


In 2008, he was named one of the top five CEOs of publicly traded software companies by
Institutional Investor magazine. A recognized authority on cybersecurity, he appears
regularly on nationally televised news programs, has spoken numerous times at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, participated in panel discussions alongside world leaders, and
serves as an Advisor to the critical government agencies amongst others. In May 2011, He
was appointed by President Obama to serve on the National Security and Technology
Advisory Council.

This is not even close, KEYW is simply out matched competing against FEYE. But I kept
digging anyway and was surprised by what I found.


NetCitadel: Unaware HawkEye Even Exists while Beating KEYW at its Own Game


KEYW likes to talk about its Hawkeye G product, which supposedly has automatic threat
detection capabilities. What the Street has missed, and which KEYW doesn't like to talk
about as far as I can tell, is that another company beat Hawkeye G to the punch with
automatic threat detection products. This company is NetCitadel.


Let's look at a few facts about NetCitadel:


NetCitadel has valuable partnerships with some of the leading cyber security
companies:


From the company's own website we can see that NetCitadel is plug and play ready with
some of the best security providers in the world:


Threat Response accepts security event information from existing detection solutions like
Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM), Advanced Malware Detection (AMD)
and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and, based on the information in the security event,
updates existing security devices to react to those security events in real-time. Examples
of detection devices that already communicate with Threat Response with no additional
coding include: FireEye, Palo Alto Networks, HP ArcSight, and QRadar.


(Notice KEYW, Hawkeye or Hexis are not mentioned…)


This partnership has been covered in press releases and is mentioned in FEYE's S-1.


The fact that NetCitadel and FEYE (among others) are partnered up begs a host of
questions for KEYW investors:


Why wasn't KEYW chosen to partner with NetCitadel?
Does this negate the entire advantage KEYW claims to have over FEYE (R&D
disparity aside)?
Can KEYW really be considered a revolutionary product if NetCitadel was founded in
2011, apparently beating KEYW to market by ~3 years?
Are these partnerships the reason KEYW has had difficulty ramping its Hawkeye G
product?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265613-keyw-cyber-security-inferiority-and-looming-dilutive-equity-raise-reiterate-strong-sell 4/17


Interestingly, even though NetCitadel appears obviously superior to "Hawkeye", NetCitadel
was recently acquired by ProofPoint (NASDAQ:PFPT) for $24 million. PFPT has LTM
revenue of $150m and spent $39m on R&D (26%). Although we don't know how much
revenue NetCitadel had, it probably wasn't much for this price. The apparently low
acquisition price raises substantial additional questions for KEYW shareholders:


Why is KEYW being valued like a cyber security business when it, too, has very little
cyber security revenue? Apparently the acquisition market isn't awarding high
valuations to such companies.
Would KEYW likely be worth even less than NetCitadel because it lacks these key
partnerships?
Why did ProofPoint acquire NetCitadel instead of KEYW's cyber business?
Either NetCitadel has a low revenue base or trades at a low multiple of revenue - this
is bad for the KEYW bull case, which is largely predicated on a high multiple of cyber
security revenue.


Common sense would dictate none of these answers end well for KEYW shareholders,
but I wanted to be sure so I called employees from NetCitadel to get their take. I was
surprised to learn that the NetCitadel employees I spoke with had never even heard
of KEYW, Hexis, or Hawkeye G. This tells you what little penetration KEYW has
made into the cyber security market - not only is NetCitadel not even remotely
concerned with KEYW, they don't even know who KEYW is!


Who exactly is backing NetCitadel? This is where it gets really interesting. NetCitadel was
originally backed by New Enterprise Associates, a prominent venture capital fund with $13
billion of committed capital.


Furthermore, FEYE was originally backed by In-Q-Tel. In-Q-Tel is a not-for-profit venture
capital firm that invests in high-tech companies for the sole purpose of keeping the Central
Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies, equipped with the latest in
information technology in support of United States intelligence capability.


My recommendation is that anyone who owns or is thinking about buying KEYW
stock owes it to themselves to get on the phones and talk to competitors - you're
likely to get a much different view than what Wall Street's biased investment banks
are telling you about KEYW stock.


This means that not only is the combined FEYE / NetCitadel partnership vastly larger with
a much higher R&D budget than KEYW, it is also backed by the smart money with deep
ties to the CIA. Given these facts, and other issues KEYW faces, what reason does

anyone have to believe that KEYW could possibly compete with the FEYE / NetCitadel
partnership?


I think after all of the above it's quite clear that KEYW shareholders are in for a rude
awakening if they think this cyber business is worth much but let's keep going.


History of KEYW's "Cyber" business: What exactly is Hawkeye?


As I discussed in my prior report, KEYW was the buyer of last resort of Sensage, an asset
that was sold at a loss by its initial VC backers and which was dropped before that by HP.
Sensage now makes up a key part of the Hawkeye suite and has apparently been
rebranded Hawkeye AP. Hawkeye AP claims to aggregate and prioritize threats and then
Hawkeye G claims to try and eliminates them. Sensage "serves enterprises who use the
software to capture and store event data so that it can be consolidated, searched and
analyzed to generate reports that detect fraud." Sensage is what's known as a SIEM
software product - Security Information and Event Management.


What is the history of Sensage? It used to be a key service provide to Hewlett Packard
until HP acquired ArcSight and dropped Sensage. This was a real slap in the face for
Sensage as Sensage was already integrated with some HP products and HP would have
been highly familiar with Sensage's capabilities. So basically this acquisition can only be
interpreted one way: According to HP, Sensage is not as effective as ArcSight.


From the blog link above, let's recap who the winners and losers were of this transaction:


Winners:


ArcSight, of course.
Kleiner Perkins with about 20x on the investment; even CIA made some money (via In-
Q-Tel)
SIEM players close to the top of the totem pole. All will now claim "ah, we are the
leader now!"


Losers:


Whoever was on the shortlist with ArcSight to be acquired by HP. Oops!
Current HP "SIEM" partner - this vendor now gets to add their own name to the list of
failed SIEM vendors :-) Bummer! [Author's note: He doesn't even know Sensage's
name! Oops indeed]
SIEM players close to the bottom of the totem pole. Even fewer people will buy your
wares now, especially if HP discounts Express aggressively.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265613-keyw-cyber-security-inferiority-and-looming-dilutive-equity-raise-reiterate-strong-sell 6/17


So naturally, the next logical step for Sensage was to sell itself to KEYW so its VC backers
could exit at a loss - this makes sense for KEYW given their history of awful capital
allocation, something I covered in my last report.


So for all of you who believe that Hawkeye is a revolutionary product, this is simply not
true - Hawkeye is largely based around Sensage, a failed SIEM provider that was dropped
by HP.


More concerning than that though, FireEye has partnered with ArcSight to offer an
integrated product. FireEye wins again! And remember In-Q-Tel, the CIA VC fund? They
were one of the original backers of ArcSight.


If we stop and put this all together:


FireEye is much bigger than KEYW and is growing rapidly
NetCitadel has a better threat protection system than KEYW according to FEYE
(implied with the partnership)
ArcSight has a better SIEM product than KEYW (implied by HP's acquisition and FEYE
partnership)
These companies are backed by leading VC firms and directly connected to the CIA
venture fund


Not looking too good for KEYW. No wonder NetCitadel has never even heard of Hawkeye
- why would anyone possibly pick Hawkeye in a head-to-head competition against
NetCitadel / FireEye / ArcSight? Is this the cyber superiority that KEYW constantly touts?
To me it is very clear that this is cyber inferiority.


So where does that leave us today?


KEYW needs equity badly and this capital raise, if even possible, will be highly
dilutive


Those following the KEYW story closely know KEYW filed an S-3 on April 23rd to sell up
to $150m in equity and this registration went effective on May 14th. In a prior report I
covered in detail how badly KEYW needs equity in order to avoid bankruptcy. KEYW's
urgent desperation to complete this filing along with the recent effectiveness of the S-3
means that KEYW could issue highly dilutive equity any day now, and in my experience
companies typically do this as soon as possible after the effectiveness is approved by the
SEC. The registration is a proposed maximum offering of $150,000,000 and if issued in
full, would result in ~13.6 million shares at today's price, which would amount to a
whopping 37% dilution for shareholders if you exclude potential warrant coverage.

Given the huge amount of dilution that is likely for KEYW shareholders, the stock would
very likely get crushed on the announcement of this equity offering. I believe much of this
capital would go to simply keeping the company solvent as KEYW needs to pay off its
debt, so there is little upside for shareholders except avoiding bankruptcy (no reason to
own this stock now).


KEYW will likely report 2Q earnings toward the end of July (last year it was July 31st). On
the last conference call, KEYW's CFO guided for weak revenue in 2Q (recall that this
conference took place on May 1st, which means KEYW would have had good visibility in
2Q results already) - 2Q is likely to be down 20% yoy in my estimation. I believe KEYW
will do everything in its power to close the secondary before this conference call when the
stock will likely be even lower than it is now.


KEYW is doing everything it can to try to keep its stock up before the dilutive
secondary comes:


Chardan apparently attempted, but failed, to promote KEYW stock
Insiders are apparently trying to gain support by buying stock
The company issued a promotional, but ultimately empty, press release yesterday


Let's go through each of these one by one


In my opinion, Chardan is one of the lowest quality investment banks on Wall Street


Some of the questionable practices Chardan has engaged in have been written about
extensively:


One author alleges fraud in some of the reverse merger China shells that Chardan helped
support


One buy rated stock that Chardan supported was later delisted by NASDAQ


Various Chardan stocks have been written on extensively by credible short sellers here
and here


These are just a few examples of alarming Chardan actions that can be found on the
internet in just a few minutes - a more thorough discussion of Chardan's transgressions or
alleged transgressions would likely take days or weeks to compile.


I believe it's very likely Chardan initiated coverage on KEYW to help support KEYW's
stock price in hopes of winning the underwriting business that KEYW offers. We also know
that investment banking fees for secondary equity offerings are fairly standard across the

Street at roughly 7% of equity raised. This is not a price sensitive decision, it is a
reputation decision. So for KEYW to have to go Chardan for help, that likely means none
of the white shoe firms on Wall Street are interested in putting any of their clients into
KEYW, even for a flat fee (and there's nothing investment bankers love more than fees!).


Remember, an investment bank plays both sides of a capital raise, both raising money for
the company, and also finding buyers for the company's stock. A name-brand investment
bank is incentivized from doing low quality deals because it means the top-tier clients that
use the name-brand investment bank will be less likely to do repeat business.


Where are BofA and Morgan Stanley? After all, these are the companies that helped take
KEYW public, according to KEYW's 2010 S-1 filing. The fact that these bulge bracket firms
have fled the scene is very telling - this is known as the trade down effect, and it's
representative of an equity declining in quality.


In fact, only some of the lowest quality "bucket shops" (in my opinion) cover KEYW stock
now:


Drexel Hamilton
Noble Financial
Chardan
Suntrust Robinson
Sterne Agee
FBR Capital


As I discussed in a prior report, most of these underwriters have benefited from the $11
million in fees KEYW has paid Wall Street for the capital it has raised so far. These firms
are hardly objective - and investors know this: the market shrugged off both recent
upgrades from Chardan and Drexel. This is probably because the market knows how hard
it has been for KEYW to raise equity in the past. Why the difficulty? KEYW has been a
terrible steward of capital in the past and the market knows that.


KEYW insider buying is still below the level where insiders have traditionally sold
stock


In a prior report I discussed how KEYW insiders have historically been sellers at this price
level despite recent purchases


I checked KEYW's historic open market acquisitions vs. open market dispositions, per
CapIQ data, in the $10-12 price range. As they say, "the numbers don't lie" - KEYW
insiders, including Moodispaw, have purchased a total 35,000 shares in this price range

and sold 195,400 shares. This is a staggering divide in dollar terms: I estimate, based on
CapIQ data, that KEYW execs have purchased $396,823 and sold $2,233,622 in a similar
price range over time, a startling 5.6-fold difference. Clearly, insiders would rather take
profits at this level, historically speaking.


With the recent insider buys, these figures have closed slightly, but not enough to be
meaningful and the market remains skeptical of KEYW's valuation - the stock has failed to
convincingly hold $11 in recent weeks despite these purchases. Insiders have now
purchased 67,000 shares according to current CapIQ data and sold 195,400 shares, or 3x
as many insider sales in this range. This is no comfort to people who own the stock at this
level.


In my opinion, yesterday's press release is another empty attempt to promote the
stock in front of the equity offering


Yesterday's press release is long on hype and short on substance, saying virtually
nothing. Here are the questions investors should be asking:


Which government agency? What does "initial delivery" mean? Is this a revenue
generating contract or instead bookings with distant promises of possible revenue?
If it's a revenue generating contract, how much?
Is this a trial or a full blown contract? If it's a contract, how long will it last?
Why was this press release with such limited information issued now? If the contract is
so material couldn't it wait until KEYW released more details?


In light of the impending secondary, I caution investors that empty press releases provide
no downside protection in front of the avalanche of dilution coming to KEYW shares very
soon. If this were a material contract, KEYW would have been required to file an 8-K with
the details, something it has apparently not done.


Large shareholders have been selling stock


According to CapIQ data based on the March quarter (most recently available data),
several large shareholders have been selling stock. I think it's likely some or perhaps even
all of these shareholders have sold more stock since March 31st 2014 - this view is based
on the KEYW stock chart, which has clearly been under pressure as lots of supply has
come to market.


It can't be good when BlackRock, AllianceBernstein, Columbia Management and UBS are
selling shares. These shareholders collectively have enough shares remaining (as of the
last official 13F filing for each shareholder) to significantly impact the shares if they decide

to completely exit KEYW stock.


I tried to contact management by email and phone for their comment but unfortunately did
not receive a response.


Conclusion


KEYW remains a busted rollup that has mediocre returns on capital
The company desperately needs equity and the only solution is heavy dilution
Cyber revenue remains ~3% of total revenue: KEYW is NOT a cyber company
KEYW's "cyber" business is unlikely to ever amount to much in my opinion given
superior competition
Large shareholders are losing faith and have been liquidating shares of KEYW


Reiterate STRONG SELL and $3.80 price target. Don't get caught in KEYW's hype
and imminent avalanche of dilution or bankruptcy.

A quick observation on the press release: Maybe I need to go back and read it for a third time, but based on how
vague it is written I believe IT IS POSSIBLE that KEYW has not even received any revenue from this agency, as it
could just be some kind of free trial. Also, the Sun Trust Robinson Humphrey note this morning is comical given how
much he extrapolates and exaggerates from this little press release...talk about whoring out your research for banking
business, this guy might take the cake. 
Disclosure: We continue to be short KEYW in our fund.

I also read it as a no revenue contract. If they had gotten revenue they could have easily disclosed that. If it were very
material revenue, they would have released an 8-K. The press release is part of the pump, there is probably nothing
material to see here, move along, move along.

If it was material, then Lenny just threw himself under the insider trading bus with his most recent purchases.

Its not a revenue contract. " U.S. government agency has taken an initial delivery of .." translates to "A
secretary at a government agency signed for a package sent by registered mail containing a cd rom of our
software (we couldn't affor a USB drive)."

It's probably something like that. Companies that have material developments don't need to play word games,
they would have just said it was revenue which is what people wanted to see. KEYW still has never
generated material Hawkeye revenue. Based on this article, I doubt they ever will.

Love the article and insight. IMHO you are spot on in your analysis. Why do you think the stock is holding up? Who is
supporting the stock? The fact that some name brand institutional investors are holding the stock is outrageous IMHO
and shows they don't do proper diligence or channel checks. Are there any status reports on where the secondary is?
I think they are struggling getting the offering done and that’s why they hired Todd Weller in hopes he could convince
the street. It was an odd hire at best and they probably offered him a fat bonus if the secondary gets done. FEYE blew
a hole in their strategy when they started pricing their secondary for insiders to get out. What’s keeping FEYE going is
growth and industry leadership. Here it’s mediocre growth at best. Given the small R&D budget on Hawkeye G it can't
be a high quality scalable product. Time will tell.


12 Jun 2014, 11:15 AM


ikarus
There's no info available that I can find but I would love to hear the author weigh in on why the secondary is taking so
long. It's been nearly 4 weeks since the filing went effective, I would have thought it would be done by now. God help
them if they can't get the secondary done by the second quarter conference call, this stock could be $8 or lower. If this
was the best KEYW could do with Hawkeye (a vague, inconsequential press release) I really think this company is in
trouble.


As the author pointed out, KEYW had difficulty raising their last secondary -- my guess is they are having a very hard
time here and may need to price at a substantial discount which would imply even more dilution.


Good info in this article about the Sensage product, I hadn't dug that deep. The Hawkeye product suite is even more
of a long shot than I originally thought.


I thought the $3.80 price target was too high but otherwise agree with the author, thanks again for the write up!

****>>>..One look at a 2-month chart on FEYE screams BUY. May 7 thru 10 was a massive ''capitulation'' volume that

out. This was followed by massive buy-volumes as i'll bet 100 hedge funds stampeded over each other to be the first
to buy at these cheap, undervaluation prices. Must have traded the entire float in that 3-weeks. Add the NATO high-
recomendation; the Barclays upgrade; etc etc. And once again the chart is saying to buy based on both daily and
weekly MACD's turned to the upside. I'm fully loaded for the long-term on this monster; you bet ! ! !

Yeah there might be a good pairs trade here, long FEYE with its monstrous R&D budget and short KEYW
with its wort-in-class leadership, products, market position, and R&D spend, not to mention the huge dilution
coming.

Clearly the CEO does not view the Hawkeye win as a material event or they had not won this customer last week.
Otherwise he would have been buying stock while in possession of material nonpublic information.


12 Jun 2014, 03:23 PM

Yeah obviously this company would never do anything wrong... like for instance steal sensitive customer
information or provide false and misleading information to the investment community.

Does anyone have thoughts on the latest press release regarding the loan? Looks like they got some breathing room
but one thing seems odd is adding back costs related to " the add back of “run rate” cost savings realized as a result
of specified cost reduction actions" Is there a cost reduction program looming? Seems like that might be another blow
to the company and investment in Hexis


17 Jun 2014, 10:36 AM


Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos
My view 1) KEYW will likely miss consensus estimates once again as the consensus numbers would have
them in compliance with no amendment. I bet they are closer to $65-67M in revenue vs the $72M consensus.
2) I believe the debt is now 100 bps more expensive. 3) They have kicked the can one quarter and will likely
have to get another amendment for the September quarter. They paid $212,000 plus doc fees for the latest
amendment. Keep this up every quarter and the debt service is an extra $1M per year.


Very strange that they don't raise money. This company is already facing a very difficult task in trying to break
into the commercial market where competition grows more fierce by the day, yet they have decided to do this
with a resourced constrained balance sheet. If you're short the stock I think you want them to continue this

path. Raising money would mitigate downside and give the commercial business a higher probability of
success.


17 Jun 2014, 02:17 PM


ikarus
I have similar numbers Donnie. My read was KEYW was unable to raise equity or they would have just done it
already. It's been a month since the filing went effective. The revenue and EBITDA figures are clearly going to be
down yoy for the next several quarters unless they buy something, but that's off the table with the current balance
sheet.


I think the bigger issue here is that EBITDA is very likely to get crushed in 2015 with the planes contract so there
really doesn't seem to be any way out here unless you think the cyber revenue ramp is coming (I don't, it seems very
clear this is not going to ramp).


The short is win / win. If they raise equity, it's a huge blow to the stock and probably comes at a heinous discount
given how difficult it's been. If they don't raise equity they are teetering on the edge of another covenant violation with
rapidly declining EBITDA. KEYW is in a no win situation.


FWIW, some of the best short selling funds in the country are short this stock. I actually wish it had a lower short
interest and was less crowded but it's nice to know that some of the very smartest investors in the country agree that
this is still a great short even though it's down some. IMO stock is sub-$5 in the next 12 months short of a miracle.

Have you guys looked at the latest 8K exhibit?


Hexis Executive Incentive Plan


Given the incentive plan- does it look like they are trying to sell/IPO Hexis as the way to raise the much needed case?


Another desperate attempt on the part of loosy goosey moussy?


07 Jul 2014, 05:05 PM


ikarus
Yeah I saw that, it's just a gimmick. No one is going to pay a big multiples of sales (not that there is any material
revenue anyway). This is not the next FEYE. It's a collection of old, tired assets that customers have no interest in
and which competitors barely even know exist. There is nothing there. Go ahead an IPO it, it's nearly worthless and
KEYW will probably just burn through that cash in a couple of quarters tops so who cares.


This stock is hosed, a $4 print is coming to you soon.

This new debt deal looks horrendously bad (from what limited terms are disclosed so far) -- how is this not clearly a
bankruptcy now? The cyber revenue will never, ever ramp so this is a very expensive government subcontractor with
a HUGE debt load. Wow stock market, wow.

Funding catalyst shorts are tough in a risk-less market where money is free. More of a slog from here with

I think it's a better short now than it's ever been. The cyber effort is hopeless, the deal bakes in significant
dilution, and EBITDA will decline throughout 2015.


16 Jul 2014, 02:03 PM


Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos
I agree ikarus. This company needed an equity infusion, not debt. If they would have just sold stock it would have
limited the downside, but instead they put a lid on the stock with the convert and took on debt they will struggle to
support eventually unless Hexis is a homerun. If FLD collapses next year the stock is probably a zero. Wreckless
management in my opinion, but that is what we want to see.


16 Jul 2014, 05:02 PM


ikarus
Annnnnnnnd yet another quarter of no cyber revenue growth... cyber revenue actually DECLINED. This is a pure
government subcontractor trying to fool everyone into thinking its a cyber defense company. It's not. Compared to true
peers, this stock is worth $3-4 and will likely get there in the next few quarters.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2265613-keyw-cyber-security-inferiority-and-looming-dilutive-equity-raise-reiterate-strong-sell 16/17


It has become comedy on the conference calls listening to Chris and Len give updates and an outlook for the
cyber business and pretend it is good progress. The company's own 8-k in August forecast $18.1M in Hexis
revenue in 2014. They are going to miss that projection by a mile. They have generated $7.7M in 9 months.
My guess is they will be flat or slightly up from last year. That forecast was a few months ago and they are
going to miss it horribly. You would think the Sell Side analysts would start to get embarrassed for believing
these guys.


28 Oct 2014, 11:12 PM

You would think, but the balance sheet is in tatters and there is so much money to be made at the sell side
from helping to defraud investors that why not? YOLO.

Author’s reply »  incredible but true that KEYW "earnings" today are worse than even I thought possible, cyber is
obviously failing coming in both below sell side estimates and revenue fell by 1/3 sequentially (how is that even

the longer keyw keeps at this absurd cyber pipe dream the faster they run towards bankruptcy.

Remember, the actual face value of the debt is $150M despite only listing $125M on the balance sheet.
