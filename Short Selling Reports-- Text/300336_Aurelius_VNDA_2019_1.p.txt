We are short Vanda Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VNDA).


In recent years, the public markets have witnessed a certain
underclass of companies that have chosen to bilk the health care
system at the expense of taxpayers and patients.  Companies such
as MiMedx, Insys, Valeant, and Turning have collectively deployed a
playbook of various tactics including reimbursement shenanigans,
billing schemes, off-label marketing, price gouging, bribing doctors,
and retaliating against whistleblowers and short sellers.  Although
this playbook can be used to temporarily boost �nancial
performance, in�ate stock prices, and create windfall bonuses for
executives, history demonstrates that companies resorting to this
kind of chicanery often end in complete disaster for investors. 
Vanda and its CEO, Mihael Polymeropolous, in our opinion, may
prove to be the next corporation to have embraced this ethos.


While Vanda shares surged to all-time highs in recent months,
detailed but anonymous allegations of illegal sales practices and
outright criminality quietly gathered steam on an industry message
board named CafePharma. Meanwhile, Vanda experienced a mass
exodus of employees, with authority over key departments reportedly
7/10/2019 Vanda: In the Land of The Blind, The One-Eyed Man is King - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/vanda-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-man-is-king/ 3/18


being transferred to the CEO’s children and new hires lacking
experience.


Now, a 150 page Qui Tam lawsuit (here) �led by a whistleblower was
recently unsealed with detailed allegations that Vanda has engaged
in a series of fraudulent schemes, some personally orchestrated by
Polymeropoulos himself, to defraud government payors.  The
allegations describe illegal off-label promotion of both of Vanda’s
drugs, Vanda’s participation in a fraud involving doctors writing
hundreds of “fake prescriptions” and pocketing cash using Vanda-
issued copay cards, falsi�ed documents in internal systems, and
resignations of senior executives who refused to participate in illegal
activity.


These new allegations amplify the �ndings from our own months-
long investigation which yielded evidence of signi�cant
irregularities.  They also corroborate certain allegations made by
multiple former employees in private calls who described off-label
promotion, suspect business practices, and internal turmoil that
continued well after the whistleblower’s departure.


At a current valuation of around 5x trailing sales, Vanda investors are
paying a signi�cant “blue sky” premium for projected future growth. 
We believe investors fundamentally misunderstand the true nature of
Vanda’s activities and therefore see signi�cant downside potential in
the shares.


Recently Unsealed Qui Tam Suit Alleges Vanda Engaged in
Fraudulent Schemes


This undisclosed and previously unreported lawsuit is one of the
most expansive and detailed whistleblower writings we have come
across.  The whistleblower, Richard Gardner, has over 20 years of
pharmaceutical experience and left P�zer to become a Regional
Business Leader at Vanda from November 2015 to August 2016. 
The lawsuit depicts Vanda as having a sell-at-all costs culture that
relied on illegal sales tactics and even outright fraud out of concern
for the company’s stock price.

Note: U.S.D.C., D.C. Case 1:17-cv-00464-APM, Unsealed
January 31, 2019. Investors should assume that Vanda
denies all allegations in the lawsuit.  We believe most
investors are not aware of this lawsuit because the �ling
date is 2017, which disguises that it was recently
unsealed. We also note that the government declined to
intervene in the case. The government declines to
intervene in the vast majority of cases and, in our
experience, this does not necessarily re�ect a
judgement of the merits.


Vanda has grown by selling two drugs, Fanapt and Hetlioz, that had
previously been cast off by larger companies. Both drugs have
narrow FDA approved indications that severely limit their respective
potential patient populations and therefore also limit Vanda’s on-
label revenue potential.  To juice sales, the whistleblower states that
Vanda’s senior management implemented a plan to illegally promote
both drugs for off-label purposes and alleges that, as a result of
fraudulent reimbursement claims, “the government has been
defrauded and suffered a substantial loss”.


One former top-performing sales employee we spoke to explained
that Fanapt, which accounts for just over 40% of Vanda’s sales, “was
a dud” because it is a second line drug approved solely to treat adult
schizophrenia as compared to competitive antipsychotics which
have much broader indications. To increase sales of Fanapt, the
whistleblower states that Polymeropoulos crafted off-label
messaging himself and trained sales reps to promote the drug for
other indications using a variety of false claims regarding Fanapt’s
e�cacy, dosing, and safety. We note that several months ago, Vanda
received a Warning Letter from the FDA instructing the company to
immediately cease misbranding its drug with “false and misleading

marketing materials” that failed to warn about the safety risks of
Fanapt and Hetlioz.


The lawsuit states that Vanda falsi�ed documents relating to
physician target lists in company systems that “were a joke and were
designed solely to shield Vanda from liability”.  Instead, according to
the complaint, sales reps were directed to target physicians
prescribing drugs for other mental disorders as well as child
psychologists, even though Fanapt has no FDA approval for children,
according to the complaint.


The complaint also states that Vanda even actively participated in
and attempted to conceal a fraudulent scheme involving doctors
writing hundreds of “fake prescriptions” and then submitting Vanda-
provided copay cards to pocket cash, which we interpret as a
method of bribing doctors:

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/vanda-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-man-is-king/ 6/18


Fanapt sales have since stagnated in favor of Hetlioz, a $188k/year
orphan drug that treats Non-24, an extremely rare sleep disorder that
primarily effects blind people who have no perception of light. 
Investors have pinned their hopes to the growth prospects of Hetlioz,
with one sell side analyst projecting a “base case” of $470M in
Hetlioz sales by 2033 with an Upside scenario of $608 million (as
compared to just over $100 million in trailing sales today).


Our research indicates that Vanda has had an extremely di�cult time
attracting and keeping blind patients on Hetlioz, the population the
drug was tested on and designed to treat. In order to meet growth
targets, we believe Vanda’s “secret sauce” is a product of
Polymeropoulos harnessing the Fanapt sales force to begin selling
Hetlioz to psychiatrists as a sleep aide alternative to Ambien and
Lunesta for sighted patients.   The principal problem is that
taxpayers appear to be on the hook for Polymeropoulos’ alleged
shenanigans.


Non-24 is so rare that Vanda had to cut patient enrollment of its FDA
trials of Hetlioz in half because it could not identify enough patients
with the condition.  This makes it exceedingly di�cult for Vanda to
sell Hetlioz to patients with Non-24, which one former rep described
as the classic “needle in the haystack” exercise. After launch in 2014,
Vanda’s strategy was centered on building awareness by sending
sales reps to blind community centers and running tv and radio

spots to target friends and family members, an effort that initially
appears to have been somewhat fruitful.


But our research also indicates that Hetlioz has unfavorable levels of
front-end patient churn, meaning patients who begin treatment often
drop off in the �rst six months.  One explanation is that the drug
simply doesn’t work very well for some patients.  Although
commentary from people we spoke to about the drug’s e�cacy was
mixed, a former manager stated:


”[Patients] might have stayed on the drug [Hetlioz] for three or four
months, and there’s probably some that are still on it from initial
launch.  The others, there was big turnover….because of e�cacy, I
would think”


We also examined data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting
System (“FAERS”), which contains information on medication error
reports submitted to the FDA.  The single most frequently reported
adverse event is the complaint of “drug ineffective” which, when
combined with similar complaints about e�cacy, totals 888
complaints since 2014, an amount which exceeds the number of
patients currently on Hetlioz.  In fact, questions about Hetlioz’s
e�cacy date back to 2013, when Health Care columnist Adam
Feuerstein identi�ed “a disturbingly large number of irregularities and
red �ags” related to Vanda’s clinical trials of Hetlioz.

One former employee suggested that elevated reports of the drug
being ineffective re�ect the increased off-label usage: “That’s what
happens when you write it for a diagnosis that’s imaginary, it’s not
going to work”.

Churn and e�cacy issues would be problematic for any drug, but
especially an orphan drug that most patients are supposed to use on
a chronic basis.  In fact, Vanda’s CEO, Dr. Mihael Polymeropoulos,
initially touted the patient persistence of Hetlioz, stating in October
2014 that:


“the guidance we’re giving is that from new scripts in, the long-term
expectation is, at least more than half the patients will become
chronic patients.”


Yet in February 2015 Vanda announced it “will no longer report the
number of HETLIOZ prescriptions written, dispensed or patients on
therapy”. We question if the decision to eliminate this transparency
was made because Hetlioz patient persistence was beginning to
deteriorate.


Vanda quickly moved to begin extracting more money from
predominantly government payors through aggressive Hetlioz price
increases. Since its commercial launch in 2014, we calculate that
Vanda has raised Hetlioz pricing from $84k/year to roughly
$188k/year at present (below).  With Hetlioz costing more than many
life-saving cancer drugs, one former sales manager observed that
Polymeropoulos “was so proud he was gouging people for this
product”.


We believe that Vanda eventually began running out of enough blind
patients to replace the ones churning off Hetlioz.  Vanda pivoted to
begin targeting sighted patients through the “HETLIOZ to
Psychiatrists initiative” (“HPI”) formally announced by Vanda in 2017,
whereby the Fanapt sales force would begin selling Hetlioz.


Vanda stated last year that at least 2 out of every 3 prescriptions now
come from Psychiatrists for sighted patients.

We �nd this particularly curious because instances of non-24 in
sighted patients are widely believed to be even more rare than in
blind patients. Vanda’s 10-K �led in 2017 recognized that “non-24
occurs almost entirely in blind individuals”, before this language was
abruptly changed in the 2018 �ling. An experienced sleep doctor who
has prescribed Hetlioz stated on a private call that he was
“�abbergasted” to learn about Vanda’s initiative to target
Psychiatrists and explained that Non-24 in sighted patients is “as
rare as angels on the head of a pin”.  An article in a medical journal
states “there have been fewer than 100 cases of sighted people
with Non-24 sleep-wake disorder reported in the scienti�c
literature”.


So how is it possible that so many sighted patients could suddenly
develop non-24?


Our discussion with former employees and a sleep doctor support
the whistleblower’s assertion that Vanda is engaging in off-label
marketing of Hetlioz as a sleep aid. A former sales rep we spoke to
explained that “We were [internally] saying ‘give it to everyone who
doesn’t sleep well’”.  The sleep doctor opined that “they are
prescribing this off label and calling it’s something it’s not. I’ll tell you
that, Absolutely.”


A former sales manager explained “basically the training was
creating the story or creating the plausible idea that this could be
happening really commonly in our psychiatry o�ce”. The
whistleblower lawsuit alleges that Vanda’s off-label marketing pitch
was premised, in part, on Hetlioz not being classi�ed as a schedule
drug by the FDA.

We note that Vanda’s off-label activities directly contradict
Polymeropoulos own testimony to the FDA in November 2013, when
he told the agency “for patients that don’t have non-24, we don’t
recommend it, and it’s actually easy to keep the drug only in the hands
of blind people”.

November 2013


Since there were only around 700 patients on Hetlioz at the end of
2017, each incremental patient is extremely valuable for Vanda.
Former sales reps told us that Vanda began offering them $1k for
each Hetlioz prescription they were able to get a Psychiatrist to write
(regardless if it was eventually �lled).  One former rep informed us
that some Vanda employees were able get friendly doctors in certain
regions to fax a highly abnormal number of prescriptions.  We also
reviewed a sell side research report that suggests a select number of
7/10/2019 Vanda: In the Land of The Blind, The One-Eyed Man is King - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/vanda-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-man-is-king/ 11/18


psychiatrists are responsible for an outsized number of
prescriptions. The same former rep asked us:


“Look across the country, how come one guy can have 50, 60, 70, 80
[Hetlioz prescriptions] and a whole state can only have three?…Do they
have 70 more blind people, all in one little-pocketed area, coming from
one or two doctors, three blocks from each other”?


The whistleblower suit also states that employees were threatened
with termination unless they engaged in the illegal activity.  Vanda’s
Director of Marketing and the Chief Compliance O�cer resigned
after “CEO Polymeropoulos refused to alter the marketing strategy”,
according to the complaint:


Vanda appears to have experienced a mass employee exodus since
Polymeropoulos’ announcement of the so-called HPI initiative. Our
review of Linkedin found that 87 people have left Vanda since the
beginning of 2017 (below), which amounts to 31% of the 273 total
employees Vanda had as of December 2017. One employee stated
he/she left because “O�oading the drug to patients that don’t have
the disorder…I couldn’t do it, ethically”. Departures include high level
staffers from compliance, sales, and operations such as Richard
Gulino Vanda’s General Counsel and Paolo Baroldi, Vanda’s Chief
Medical O�cer.  We also con�rmed an undisclosed mass purge of at
least 29 sales representatives occurred in the summer of 2018.

Former employees also explain that Polymeropoulos has turned
Vanda into an increasingly nepotistic organization by transferring
authority of key departments to his children.  Former employees we
spoke to described how seasoned professionals were jettisoned in
favor of newly hired reps lacking experience. A different former
employee observed, “it’s going to save him [Polymeropoulos] money,
but also is it because they don’t know anything and he can mold them
into doing what he wants them to do?”.   One former employee
explained “once you start challenging Mihael”, “your days are
numbered”.   Similar sentiments pointing to internal turmoil and
corruption at Vanda have repeatedly appeared on Glassdoor, a
website where employees anonymously review companies.

Are Taxpayers on the Hook For Vanda’s Alleged Fraud?


Insurance payors appear to be denying HETLIOZ prescriptions for
sighted patients in great numbers, something that Vanda has even
conceded in recent conference calls.  Multiple former employees
have told us that virtually all prescriptions would automatically be
rejected for reimbursement for sighted people by commercial
insurers. This is consistent with numerous insurance forms we
reviewed (example from BCBS Arizona below), that state that all
patients must be completely blind.  We also note that Vanda does
very little business in Europe, where total blindness is a requirement
for reimbursement.


A former employee explained the di�cult and labor-intensive
process of getting prescriptions approved:


You’d have to prove– through the appeals process, you would have to
document that other formulary agents have been tried, and failed, and
that there’s no other formulary alternative. I wouldn’t think it would be
the– it wouldn’t be the �rst drug that they would try. It would have to
be a most likely last resort. Also, through the mechanism of action,

7/10/2019 Vanda: In the Land of The Blind, The One-Eyed Man is King - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/vanda-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-man-is-king/ 14/18


was there another agent that had the same mechanism of action that,
actually, they tried and failed? You really would have to document that
the patient has Non-24 …. I, personally, don’t understand how you get
Non-24 if you’re sighted.


So, who is providing reimbursement for sighted patients?


We note that the core allegation of the Qui Tam suit is that Vanda is
“has submitted and/or caused to be submitted false or fraudulent
claims to Medicare”:


While many unanswered questions remain, we have three primary
observations on this topic:


1. We believe it’s likely easier for Vanda to obtain
reimbursement for sighted Hetlioz patients from Medicare
than for commercial payors. Vanda’s SEC �lings recognize
that a “signi�cant portion” of its business comes from
government payors (10-k page 21). Medicare reimbursement
standards for Hetlioz appear to be more lax than those
applied by commercial payors.  For instance, in contrast to
commercial payors, one Medicare prior authorization form
we reviewed does not have a stated mandate for blindness.


 


2. Vanda has made the unusual move of internalizing its hub.
Expensive specialty drugs like Hetlioz necessitate the use of
what is commonly known as a reimbursement hub, corporate
speak for the function that assists patients with getting their
prescriptions �lled and reimbursed (see here). Most
manufacturers utilize the services of an externally run hub,
which we are informed Vanda did until on or about 2017
when it brought this function in-house.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/vanda-in-the-land-of-the-blind-the-one-eyed-man-is-king/ 15/18


Vanda’s move to internalize the hub is rare because it brings
into play signi�cant regulatory risks and opens the door for
potential abuse in the prescription ful�llment and
reimbursement process.  For example, an expert quoted in an
industry article explains:


“internal hubs need to be set up with a complete
separation from sales/marketing” , “and I’m talking
about secured o�ces with keypad access and the like.
Some pharma companies don’t want to go this route
just because of the risks it creates”.


That’s why we are troubled by persistent (but
unveri�ed) allegations on Cafepharma related to
misconduct involving Vanda’s hub:

3. Documents indicate that Vanda has donated money to a non-
pro�t named Patient Services Incorporated (“PSI”), which
provides �nancial assistance to patients with “Circadian
Rhythm Disorder”. A former sales rep stated that most Vanda
patients do not pay any money because the co-pays are
covered by a foundation, although no former employee we
spoke to was able to recall the name of the foundation used
by Vanda.  We believe this relationship introduces another
risk for investors.  We note that in 2017, PSI was referenced
by the Department of Justice in criminal and civil charges
brought against Aegerion Pharmaceuticals that resulted in a
guilty plea.  The DOJ stated that Aegerion was engaging in
off-label promotion and “funneling funds through Patient
Services, Inc., an entity that claimed to be a non-pro�t
patient assistance organization” in violation of Anti-Kickback

We See Signi�cant Downside Potential in Vanda Shares


Last week, Vanda shares plummeted after the company made a
bizarre announcement that it was suing the FDA to lift a partial
clinical hold on its �agship pipeline drug, Tradipitant. Now, fraud
allegations relating to Vanda’s sales activities have exploded to the
surface in a recently unsealed lawsuit.


At a current valuation of around 5x trailing sales, Vanda investors are
paying a signi�cant “blue sky” premium for projected future growth. 
We believe investors fundamentally misunderstand the true nature of
Vanda’s activities and therefore see signi�cant downside potential in
the shares.

All investors are encouraged to conduct their own due diligence into
these factors.
