China Media Express: what disconcerted me when I read
the accounts
China Media Express is a tiny company about which there is – as I have noted – major passion and
drama on Wall Street. 
 
My last post indicated that it was either (a) one of the best businesses in the history of capitalism or
(b) one of the most brazen frauds in the history of capitalism.  That post was linked by Forbes
(disapprovingly) or Fortune (somewhat approvingly).  
 
I noted that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence – and that neither side (long or short)
had presented extraordinary evidence. 
 
I also noted that the basis for my short was that the numbers were too good to be true – but I did not
state in what way they were too good to be true.  (Many people in the comments and by email
questioned my assertion that the numbers were too good to be true.) 
 
Finally I suggested that there was a relatively simple way of checking the bona-fides of CCME which
was to check the veracity of a claim that they had contractual arrangement with Apple. Apple of
course would tell the truth to the SEC if asked. 
 
Since I wrote all this the stock is down about 40 percent. My (very small) short position is ex-post too
small – but then as I noted the evidence that I had to support that short was flimsy and did not justify
a large short position. 
 
I was short simply because it was “too good to be true”. Alas really good does not mean false – so
this was a tiny bet. I was (and remain) more interested in the drama than the result. 
 
The Muddy Waters Report 
 
Yesterday (last night my time) the stock fell a third fairly rapidly after a small China-based research
outfit (Muddy Waters) released a report. Muddy Waters has released two prior reports alleging fraud –
one on Orient Paper (Amex:ONP) and one on Rino International. ONP denied the charges and the
results to date only marginally vindicate Muddy Waters. (The stock is down – but nobody has
admitted fraud.) Rino International however is one of the great hits of all time. Rino has admitted
fraud, been delisted from the Nasdaq and now trades on the Pink Sheets and have filed with the SEC
to say they will no longer be filing with the SEC. It is – as John Cleese might say – pushing
up daisies. (I remain short RINO.PK and will cover in the pennies.  There doesn't seem any reason to
allow the longs an exit above $1 when they hold clearly worthless paper.)  
 
Muddy Waters shoots one (and a bit) from two. 
 
And Muddy Waters claims are extraordinary. They don't suggest the company does not exist (it clearly
does – and indeed they visited them in many guises). They just suggest that it
is egregiously overstated both in the number of buses used and the revenue from each bus. They
suggest earnings per share are (generously) about 5c (compared to the stated $2.37 historical).
These are big claims and Muddy Waters present considerable evidence to back them up. They claim
that major advertisers (such as people who handle the Coca Cola account) could not verify the
existence of this company. This was strange because the company claimed considerable revenue
from Coca Cola.  (The company does exist.  Muddy Waters just asserts it is a minnow.)  
 
Moreover Muddy Waters claimed to have checked the Apple contract. I quote: 


We caught CCME’s management telling a particularly egregious lie. It recently
announced it had created an online shopping platform that has an agreement with
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL – yes, THAT Apple) or one of AAPL’s distributors. AAPL
made clear to us that it has no such relationship with CCME’s subsidiary. Further, AAPL
keeps tight control over its distribution in China, with only two authorized online

distributors (including Amazon.com’s China subsidiary). None of AAPL’s China
distributors have authority to sub-license.


This is pretty incontrovertible. If Apple will verify this to the SEC the SEC has no choice but to
suspend the stock - send it to the Pink Sheets and leave the corpse to the class-action lawyers to
clean up. If Apple will not verify this to the SEC then Muddy Waters has some questions to answer.
This issue alone is sufficient to say who is telling the truth. 
 
But I am not here to talk about the Muddy Waters report (although it is an impressive piece of due
diligence). I am here to explain what it was that you could check from your desk in Sydney, New York
or London that made me think that CCME was a strange company. 
 
It was the payments for media content. 
 
How media content is paid for 
 
TV shows are expensive to produce. The stars are paid well (sometimes very well). Scripts are
expensive. Studios and their staff more so. Tens of billions of dollars annually is spent producing TV
content. 
 
People don't spend all that money on TV content and then give it away. Those tens of billions of
dollars have to be recovered from somewhere. Indeed they are usually recovered eventually from
either advertisers or pay TV subscriptions. 
 
Content deals come in two forms. Either (a) I pay a fee for the content or (b) I broadcast the content
on my distribution (say a TV station) and I allow you a share of the advertising revenue or give you a
proportion of the total advertising time in which to sell adverts. 
 
In the US most TV content is sold by networks to regional TV stations in exchange for “minutes” of
advertising time. If a network is selling a hot show (like American Idol) it might demand 10 minutes of
advertising time per hour. If its a very cool show the network might demand 4 minutes of time leaving
a larger piece of the smaller pie to distribution. 
 
But its one or the other. I either pay for the content in hard cash or I pay for it by giving up revenue. 
 
If I pay for it in hard cash that cash outflow will show in the accounts (and reported margins will be
lower). 
 
If I pay for it in minutes then the cash outflow will not show in the accounts – but the revenue per
screen will be lower. 
 
Its one or the other. Either cash outflow shows in the accounts or revenue per screen is lower. No
choice in that. 
 
So lets look at the accounts to see which: 
 
Here is the cost-of-revenue section in the last annual report. To quote: 


CME’s cost of revenue increased to $25.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2008 from $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the following
reasons:


Concession fees.  Concession fees charged by inter-city express bus operators
increased to $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $10.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007. The substantial increase was attributable to the
concession fees payable to the group of bus operators participating in CME’s network
through the execution of long-term framework agreements for the year ended
December 31, 2008 as well as an increase in the number of inter-city express buses
carrying CME’s network to 15,260 as of December 31, 2008 from 10,053 as of
December 31, 2007.


Depreciation.  Depreciation for CME’s digital television displays and hard disk drives
increased to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $1.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was attributable to installation of new
equipment and control systems in connection with the increase in the number of inter-
city express buses in the CME’s networks.


Business tax.  Business tax increased to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2008 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was
primarily attributable to business taxes arising from consulting services Fujian Express
provided to Fujian Fenzhong in the year ended December 31, 2008.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Media Express: what disconcerted me when I read the accounts


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-media-express-what-disconcerted.html 3/14


Salary.  Salaries increased to the amount of $203,000 for the year ended December 31,
2008 from the amount of $156,000 for year ended December 31, 2007. The increase
was primarily attributable to the increase in number of staff in production and
maintenance department in 2008.


Other operating costs.  Other operating costs decreased slightly to approximately
$9,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008 from approximately $13,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in
production costs in 2008.


Now lets add this up.  Concession fees were 20.0 million dollars, depreciation another 2.0 million,
business tax 2.1 million.  Salary was a paltry 0.2 million.  Other expenses were trivial.  That adds up
to 24.3 million.  Total cost of revenue is 25.1 million. There is $800 thousand unexplained. 
 
That $800 thousand must include all content payments. There is no other place that content
payments in cash can go.  
 
That is not much – relative to huge revenues to pay for content. 
 
So we can presume they are not paying much for content. 
 
That is OK of course. Regional TV stations don't pay much cash for content - they yield minutes of
advertising time instead. Its entirely possible that CCME yielded minutes of advertising time. 
Indeed I questioned one of the stock brokers pushing the stock about this and they told me – after
discussion with the company – that the low payments for content were explained by yielding minutes
of advertising time. 
 
Alright – then you would expect revenue per screen to be lower than the competition because – after
all – the company does not own all the advertising time on the screens. 
 
I did the calculation – and it is repeated in the Citron Research blog post. Advertising revenue per
screen was roughly double the competition. 
 
No cash outflows for content are visible in the accounts and revenue per screen is higher than the
competition (suggesting but not proving that they are not paying much for content by yielding
minutes).  
 
As I note: this is not proof of fraud. Checking fraud is difficult: though physically checking say the
contract with Apple exists would probably constitute proof of fraud. 
 
I did not try to check fraud.  My standard of proof was low - but then so was my position size. 
 
After all, it is possible that CCME had worked out how to sell adverts for 4 times what the competition
sell them (thus producing double the revenue per screen whilst sharing half the advertising time with
the suppliers). 
 
But I thought that was “too good to be true” so I shorted the stock. 
 
Was I confident about this? No. That is one reason why my position was small. 
 
Does the Muddy Waters research surprise me? 
 
No. I was kind of expecting an end game somewhat like that – and it makes sense of my
observations. 
 
Does the Muddy Waters research constitute proof?  Not directly - you would either need to confirm
some of their observations yourself or wait for the SEC to do it for you. 
 
However confirming the claim about Apple would be pretty convincing. The SEC should do this and –
with that proof – they should suspend the stock. 
 
I am not holding my breath. The SEC are regulators with a reputation for being slow.  
 
If the short case is right (and I have a small bet on that it is right) then some prominent people have
some egg on their face. Starr Asia - associated with Hank Greenberg - looks really stupid.  They have
repeatedly purchased stock in this company and claim to have done due diligence.  That I guess will
further tarnish Hank's reputation.  Deloittes is the auditor.  Knock one more failure up for a major audit
firm - albeit a particularly embarrassing failure.  
 
At this point you know my (weakly held) view.  I still welcome criticism in the comments.

The Muddy Waters report has already been disproven in several regards, and that's only
in the first several hours since they published it. 
 
The company has provided the name of the Authorized Apple Distributor with which they
have a contract and provided a link. See today's press release. 
 
The Chinese web pages where MW derived the number of buses for various bus
operators were mistranslated by MW. The bus company websites actually validate the
same number of buses as stated by CCME. MW mistranslated to their own benefit.

John, 
 
Would evidence from CCME that they get a large bulk of their content for free change
your mind? What would it take for you to be convinced? 
 
CCME claims: 
 
http://www.ccme.tv/eng/ir/faqs.php 
 
So perhaps they can show some official documentation or release from the 2 satellite
stations that they give content to CCME for free?

I believe that they get their content free of charge cash. The company told me. 
 
The problem then is that the revenue per screen is then too high. 
 
One or the other. 
 
Unless someone is stupid enough to make content and give it to them gratis. Implausible
really.

It's important to understand that the PRC government wanted to consolidate this media
market, and gave CCME an exclusive endorsement to do so. The PRC wanted control
over the rampant display of pirated DVDs on buses leading up to the Beijing Olympics. In
China, a government 'endorsement' means something, and the bus operators were being
paid to comply anyway. The content providers are second-tier satellite TV companies who
get free advertising in exchange for their content. 
 
Yes the documentation of the agreement with the PRC is online, and there are press
accounts as well. I hope people will watch the facts closely, all is not what it seems here.
Watch the facts as they unfold.

I have to admit I'm kicking myself a tiny bit. Spent a few hours on tuesday after your post
reading up on all sorts of other opinions and the company's filings, and was seriously
considering going short. Decided it wasn't going to go anywhere that soon, so I could take
the weekend to think on it some more (I've never gone short before)... too late :(

Re free video content. 
 
Duh, you probably don't live in China so you don't understand the nuances. Hunan
Satellite TV, with its family-type variety shows, is one of the most popular TV channels in
China. The competition of TV channels in China is huge with several dozens TV channels
of similar type. How do you maintain or boost your popularity and viewership in the
market if you are Hunan Satellite? Give free content to CCME, in exchange for tens of
millions of viewership on inter-city buses. It's a win-win for both Hunan Satellite and
CCME.

The company did release the name of the Apple distributor. Do you agree MW was wrong
about this? They also misrepresented the number of buses by doing the translation
wrong.  
John, I know you are skeptical and that's good but Starr has 50$ mil investment in this
company and CFO bought 100k shares last month. I know i know there are enrons but
still what is more probable here? you decide. Hoping you reply to this comment.

The company released the name of the Apple distributor: So what. In what way is
anything the company says proof that the company is telling the truth. 
 
Apple told Muddy Waters that there are ONLY 2 online distributors in China and they do
not have rights to appoint sub-distributors. 
 
If Apple said that then CCME could say that their distributor was the Lord Jesus Christ
reincarnated as a Buddhist merchant - and it would not make it the truth.

John, what I personally find disturbing is that you almost always have your facts way
wrong. I don't know whether it's on purpose or not but given the fact that you are a fund
manager you shouldn't always bring up totally false evidence on issues.  
 
The fact that you speak about "impressive research" when you speak about the hit piece
of MW in regards to CCME basically shows your bias. Afterall you are a short seller.
These guys twisted the facts in any possible way and you applaud them for it. I don't get
this seriously.  
 
Regarding the Apple distributor. Just call that company mentioned in the PR and you will
quickly realize they are for real and they are working with China Media Express.  
 
But I guess people like Citron or MW or even you are not interested in bringing the truth
up otherwise they couldn't continue with their attacks.  
 
Have you ever asked yourself why such a "research" company don't contact the company
before releasing this BS in order to clarify these things? It would be so easy but of course
you short selling guys don't want anything to clear up. The more muddy the better right.

I find the whole Apple discussion a little bit unrealistic. I mean, from my understanding of
this business, its bread and butter is the intercity market between 2nd and 3rd tier cities.
How many people riding buses between those cities can afford an Apple product? 
 
Maybe there's some reasonable revenue opportunity for Apple on the airport side of
CCME's operations, but if Apple wants some effective advertising, any advertising exec
with half a brain would put ads on the high speed rail network that is being developed
over there. 
 
Just a thought.

It's amusing to read this blog and the comments about Apple, so uninformed. Even after
CCME identified the distributor with whom they have a contract, and especially since you
can simply go to switow.com and purchase an iPad, it's puzzling why you are clinging to
this myth. 
 
Do some DD. The switow.com site is a pass-through ad site. CCME does not hold
inventory, all orders pass through to the company that is selling the goods, all fulfillment
comes from them. The site is a value-add for CCME's advertising customers and for the
passengers on the buses, CCME does not become an online distributor for Apple
products via the website and catalog. If Apple ends up having a problem with their
distributor, so be it, there are many other agreements in place. 
 
In addition the ridership of these buses is not a bunch of peasants with garden tools in
their hands. If you don't believe CCME, or CTR, or Nielsen Media - who have all done
real research on the demographics - then ask yourself why so many large companies are
advertising on this ad network? Yes, the ads are running, go to China and see for
yourself, or take a look at an ongoing blog that is actually documenting facts, including
video of many of the routes - http://ccme-info.xanga.com. 
 
Keep your eye on the facts.

1. There is no mistranslations of the bus operator website. I am fluent in Chinese. It would
be silly for Muddy Waters to tarnish their reputation with incorrect translations of screen
shots in the report. They are based in China and obviously have Chinese working for
them. 
 
2. I find the interviewed with the advertising agencies and competitors to be most
convincing. The agencies representing Coca Cola and Lenovo has never heard of CCME.
CCME claims to make more revenue from the Beijing airport express bus route than
AirMedia does with many times more screen inside the airport. AirMedia use to operate
the ads in the airport buses before CCME, and they can't understand CCME's claims.

"Alright – then you would expect revenue per screen to be lower than the competition
because – after all – the company does not own all the advertising time on the screens. 
 
I did the calculation – and it is repeated in the Citron Research blog post. Advertising
revenue per screen was roughly double the competition." 
 
This is a major error in this logic. For starters, which competitors are you talking about?

The differences between CCME and its competitors has been well-documented. For the
most part, they operate in different markets. CCME has a captive audience for much
longer amounts of time due to the longer rides, and thus advertisers are willing to pay
more. 
 
The issue of their margins has also been addresses (copied and pasted from elsewhere): 
 
China MediaExpress earns 3.5 times revenue per screen: 
 
How many ads per hour does each company display on their system? 
 
VISN displays an average of 6-7 minutes of advertisement per hour 
CCME displays an average of 20 minutes of ads per hour 
 
What is 20 divided by 6? Take a guess. It is about 3.3, thus the reason China
MediaExpress earns about 3.5 times revenue. 
 
That is the simple answer, but also, since the individuals that ride on the China
MediaExpress bus generally have a longer trip, the screens are viewed longer with less
crowding and noise compared to subways and intra-city buses where people are
standing. This also helps contribute to receiving more in revenue, as it has more of an
effect on the "captive audience." 
 
MARGINS - This table is from the recent Goldman Sachs research on FMCN: 
 
Growth & margins (%) ----12/09 -- 12/10E -- 12/11E -- 12/12E 
 
LCD display ------------ 63.8% --- 77.3% --- 80.6% --- 83.0% 
In-store network ------- 20.4% --- 38.6% --- 47.5% --- 53.4% 
Poster frame network ----3.6% --- 29.8% --- 40.6% --- 47.3% 
Overall gross margin ----32.9% --- 57.1% --- 61.8% --- 65.1%  
 
FMCN's LCD display business is similar to CCME's, displaying ads on TV screens. In
2010, the GM is 77.3% and Goldman estimates FMCN's GM will be 80.6% and 83% in
2011 and 2012. 
 
China MediaExpress has margins closer to 70%. 
 
 
"The company released the name of the Apple distributor: So what. In what way is
anything the company says proof that the company is telling the truth. 
 
Apple told Muddy Waters that there are ONLY 2 online distributors in China and they do
not have rights to appoint sub-distributors." 
 
But Apple refused to give them a written statement, so they would have some evidence of
this? You are just taking MW's word on this with no evidence whatsoever. Eading is a
very well-known company in China and it shouldn't be hard to determine if they are a
licensed re-seller of Apple products, as CCME has claimed.

Say I want to write an article that suggests John Hempton doesn't exist, at least not in the
way that this blog claims. So I go out and talk to people in financial journalism, since he
claims he is a financial journalist. I talk to 10 people who I can claim "should" know about
him. 6 of them say they know of him, 4 say they do not. So, great - I write my article and
say that I asked 6 people who should know of John, and none of them know of him. So
John doesn't exist! And I just happen to fail to mention the 4 people who DID know him -
it's called the fallacy of omission, Logic 101. 
 
This is the fallacy that just lopped off hundreds of millions of market cap off of a stock
owned by Goldman and others. 
 
Clearly CCME exists, and clearly they sell ads. So why didn't Muddy Waters talk to the ad
agencies that DO know them. Why didn't they talk to the Apple distributor that has a
contract with CCME? Why didn't they place an order on the switow website and purchase
an Apple product? 
 
The answer is that they surely did these things. No doubt they would have loved to claim

that they attempted to place an order on switow.com and were unable to do so. So they
placed an order, and the iPod arrived. That tactic failed, so they sent an email to Apple
and asked "Ever hear of China MediaExpress?". As if Apple would know anything about
how one of its distributors is advertising. Then they write that CCME does not have a
contract with Apple, even though CCME only said they have a contract with an authorized
Apple distributor, which is true. But Muddy Waters omits that information from their article. 
 
These kinds of opportunistic hit pieces have one purpose, to make money for the authors
and their clients. This one isn't even intended to destroy the company, the allegations are
easily disproven and the information omitted from the report is easily provided. This was
rather a drive-by shooting, designed to trigger long margin calls and save the massive
short position of one or more hedge funds from a forced buy-in.

John, you appear to be the most intelligent short blogger/investor in ccme. I would love to
hear your response to my "follow the money" argument below. I can also make a positive
case for why CCME isn't "too good to be true" (I ran an ad network with $5M/month in
revenue and 40% profit margins that was highly analogous to CCME), but I want to hear
one good counter to the below first... 
CCME -- Just follow the money 
On 9/30/10, CCME had $170 million in cash, per its Deloitte reviewed 10-Q. By now, they
have well over $200 million in cash.  
Deloitte has verified the cash on numerous occasions. Starr International, which invested
$43.5 million in CCME, verifies the cash on an ongoing basis. Numerous banking
analysts have verified the cash.  
Now various investors who are short CCME and have written attack pieces claiming that
the company is a complete fraud -- Muddy Waters, Citron, Chimin Sang et al -- would
have us believe that the founder of CCME sneakily, fraudulently injected over $100M of
his own money into the company bank account over the past 12 months, pretending that
the $100M was revenue and earnings. It would have to have been freakishly complicated,
making it look like all that money came from umpteen different customers, customers that
none of the sales people had actually sold anything to. Seriously, take a moment and try
to imagine how hard it would be to inject $100M of cash into the company and make it
look like it came from real customers. Do you think this would be possible? (I don't). 
And why would these short-sellers have us believe the founder injected $100M of his own
money to perpetrate this massive fraud? He put in all this CASH in order to earn more
SHARES. Shares which he could only sell years later after additional Deloitte audits,
which could only be sold to institutional investors who would examine the company's
books and operations with a magnifying glass. Meanwhile, the founder knows that he's
sitting on a company with a tremendous short interest whose short investors are loudly
proclaiming that the company is a complete fraud. So just picture how much due diligence
an investor would do prior to buying shares from the founder. Seriously, try to imagine
*this* being the evil, master plan of a criminal founder. (Of course it can't be done). 
This has to be the foundation of the short's argument, and it's retarded. But wait, you say,
Citron, Muddy Waters and Chimin didn't make this argument. You're right, they avoided it
like the plague and made other totally distracting arguments about google and baidu
searches, numbers of buses from outdated and misleading sources, gibberish about
patents, and timed their attacks on the Chinese New Year. 
Anyway, back to what matters... following the money. The way frauds work is the opposite
of the scenario above... the founder DOES NOT put gigantic amounts of CASH INTO the
company. He takes CASH OUT of the company, as much as he can and as fast as he
can. He inflates inventory and a/r to pretend there are earnings that aren't really there. He
does secondary offerings to raise cash for the company. He pockets this cash for himself
by buying related parties at inflated values. That kind of thing.  
But hold on a minute, you say, these short investors are smart! They must have an
answer to this "follow the money" argument. Actually, no, they don't because there is
none. In fact, the smart shorts know that the cash is real, the earnings are real, and the
company is real. The smart shorts were the ones that knew the content of the hit pieces
and when they would be released, and they have all taken advantage of the panic among
long investors, of the forced selling of long investors that had used margin -- and they've
either covered their short positions or are in the process of doing so. The remaining short
investors, the ones who were not "IN" on the attack pieces before they were released, but
who simply read and were convinced by their content, are in trouble.

The Muddy Waters argument - which says the business is a fraud - but values it at cash -
is a non-sequitor. If it has the cash generated by the business then it is not a fraud. 
 
Whatever - here are some counter points. 
 
This is - on the numbers so cheap - that if it were real you would just buy it. If Muddy
Waters did the due diligence and found it was real then buying it is an easier way to make
money than shorting it. 
 
Muddy Waters is not stupid. They would have bought it. 
 
Second: the company is not behaving like the cash is there. Capex last quarter was
400K. If the cash is there - 170 million of it - the company would just step and buy stock.
Lots of it. When capex is 400K there is no reason why they need the cash. 
 
If you look at the behaviour - Muddy Waters is behaving like it is a fraud (the alternative
for them of buying the stock if it is real is too attractive).

Daniel Kaufman said...


So your main counter-argument is...  
"Muddy Waters is not stupid. Therefore, since they are short the stock rather than long, it
must be a fraud."  
Are you really convinced by that logic?? What if I could point you to some long investors
who have muddy waters beat by a couple of standard deviations in the smarts
department?? No, that probably wouldn't change your mind either. 
So, how about I grant that mw is smart, very smart. They wrote a grossly deceptive report
knowing that it would, without a doubt, cause the stock price to fall. They got very short in
advance of releasing the report on Chinese New Year. They didn't make a short
"investment." What they did was simply to "trade" in advance of their hit piece. Maybe
they're still short if they have more good hit pieces in the works. Maybe they've already
covered or gone long. I am quite confident that they won't be short by March 15 when the
2010 audit is due. 
As for your second argument, about the company not buying back its stock: 
first, i expect the company to announce in next few days that it has been buying stock; 
second, i could explain why it is rational for the founder (who already owns majority of
shares and will receive another 7 million shares for hitting 2010 earnings threshold and
most likely another 7 million for 2011 threshold), but i'm realizing it's not worth it. 
short investors in the name are exhibiting the most extreme herd mentality i have ever
seen. 
i will just shut up and enjoy the show

John, you say that if Muddy Waters had 'discovered' that CCME was legitimate then he
would have gone long on the stock. That's not plausible if you think about it. 
 
First, there is an article on Benzinga in which Carson's father brags that his son is
coordinating with hedge funds who only short China stocks. These hedge funds likely had
a large position and were willing to pay for the article, so it is probable that Muddy Waters
is being paid handsomely for the article. From his perspective, the paycheck + the
guaranteed gains on his short position were a far better bet than taking a long position in

the stock. After all, he had insider knowledge on when the article was coming out and
what it would claim. There's no way a positive article on CCME would have gained him as
much profit, even if he had been inclined to write one. 
 
And you can't seriously be suggesting that he ever approached researching the company
with an open mind or without a preordained conclusion. He only writes negative articles
on China stocks, that's what he does. The article is laughably biased. It would have been
simple for him to discover the Apple distributor that has a contract with CCME, for
example, there are only a few authorized dealers in China. He faked the Internet
searches, anyone who speaks Chinese can find many references. And why wouldn't they
be able to, the company exists... you know, like in this physical universe there are buses
with screens, playing ads from major multinational corporations. There is a website where
you can purchase Apple products. 
 
Now it turns out the spreadsheets he claims are internal CCME schedules were modified
or created by him on his own computer - the file metadata identifies a member of his own
family as the 'author'. This only happens when the file is created on that particular
computer. You can download them and take a look for yourself. 
 
I suspect this was a drive-by attack that paid him so well that he through caution to the
wind and went for it, fabricating what he needed to and omitting everything that didn't fit
his objective. I think we'll see a strong response from the company, including strong
verification of its financials.

Evidence of CCME Pump and Dump? 
 
Bright Elite used to own 2 million shares and sold most of its shares late year. Those
sales weren't reported because its ownership dipped below 5%. 
 
The founders also sold 1.5 million of their own share to Starr in October last year at
$9/share. Last year was on pace to be a $4 EPS year. Why were they selling their stocks
so cheaply? 
 
Here are some messages on the Yahoo board from last year about the sales. People
didn't pick up what was going on at the time.

to_Z%29/Stocks_C/threadview?bn=101061&tid=33227&mid=33345 
December 28, 2010 
When Jacky bought 100,000 shares from Bright Elite, it took Bright Elite's ownership
percentage to 4.89%. Coincidence? I doubt it. By getting below 5%, they can sell without
having to file. 
 
I think all the PR's are intended to help keep the stock up as Bright sells. That's why all
the good news leads to a brief pop then a fade. Jacky buyback, dividend announcement,
SWITOW announcement, etc.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Media Express: what disconcerted me when I read the accounts

Furthermore, this should leave Lin with exactly 600,000 shares. The afterhours selling
since the 20th of December were as follows: 
12/20 = 200,000 
12/21 = 150,000 
12/28 = 150,000 
01/04 = 150,000 
01/06 = 80,000 
01/07 = 150,000 
01/10 = 150,000 
01/11 = 73,231 
 
For a total of 1,103,231 shares sold and that would leave Lin with a nice round number of
600,000 Shares. I bet that is what he plans on holding on to and this last sale rounded out
his position. 
 
His sales seemed to be around 10% of daily volume.. approximately.

Starr to Purchase 1.5 Million Common Shares from Founders of CCME 
13-Oct-10 09:59 am 
 
Starr Investments Cayman II, Inc. (“Starr Cayman”), has agreed to purchase an
aggregate of 1.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock in two private
transactions. Mr. Ou Wen Lin and Mr. Qing Ping Lin, two of CME’s founding shareholders,
through their holding companies, Thousand Space Holdings Limited and Bright Elite
Management Limited have agreed to sell 1,000,000 and 500,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock, respectively, to Starr International at $9 per share. 
 
Although the agreement was signed after the Chinese Golden Week holiday, it has been
under discussion between the parties since the middle of September, and the selling price
was based on CME’s average closing trading prices for that month. It is CME’s
understanding that Mr. Ou Wen Lin and Mr. Qing Ping Lin intend to use proceeds from
the stock sale to finance their other personal business projects that are unrelated to CME.

About a different China fraud but very relevant to CCME: 'Wey does offer his own
explanation as to why the numbers that Chinese companies report to Chinese officials
often do not match those mentioned in SEC documents. 
 
"Under U.S. GAAP, revenue is booked when products are shipped out of the company's
warehouse," Wey says. "In China, however, revenue is recognized when the receiving
party issues you a government-issued receipt. But there's a 17% tax incurred. There are
many companies in China that do not necessarily want to pay that 17% upfront. So they
delay asking for the receipts. That doesn't mean that revenue is not properly booked."  
 
So, CCME -- if they are real like the other Chinese firms -- should be trying to
*understate* revenue to minimize taxes [normal corp behiavior].  
 
Sure doesn't seem like they're going that route...

CCME, cast of short characters and exit strategy  
Here is the cast:  
1. Shorts who who have conviction that the company is a complete fraud, and that the
stock will eventually go well below 5 (and don't give a shit about the 2010 audit, in fact
they're looking forward to -- Deloitte resigning). These guys are short the stock and long
post-audit puts. These guys have been short the stock since last September. Some of
them are still under-water believe it or not.  
2. Shorts who think the company looks like a fraud, but aren't convinced (and are worried
about the audit). These guys are short the stock and long Feb puts. They are feeling ok
with their situation, since they accounted for the increased short interest over past couple
months (and are in the black) but are focused on what the hit piece writers are working on
next, as it was the hit pieces that made them money.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/02/china-media-express-what-disconcerted.html 12/14


3. Shorts who don't know if the company is real or not, but who have bet the stock would
go down, based on either advance knowledge of, or expectation of hit pieces. These guys
are in cahoots with the hit piece writers. Maybe they paid them, or are in their circle, or
whatever. These guys are short the stock and long Feb puts but none expiring after that.
These guys are nervous, they've already made money, and they've got their fingers on
the "cover" trigger. This group is completely focused on the hit piece writers. Their whole
strategy is based on riding the coattails of and/or frontrunning the hit piece writers.  
4. Hit piece writers. What they own is the $64,000 question. I am guessing that they are
almost entirely long Feb puts. The reason is that all the hit pieces have happened one
after another in the past 2 weeks. They bought them when the stock was high, and they
profited like banshees when the stock got crushed. Put yourself in their shoes. If you
know WHEN a stock is going to plummet, you buy short term puts just before the hit piece
rather than long-term puts or going short the stock. This is how you maximize your profits.
You also have the advantage of not having to take the "audit risk". You have the further
advantage of Chinese New Year and the company's blackout period.  
5. Retail short followers. They are late to the party. They read the hit pieces and bought
puts.  
 
Exit strategy in the next comment...

CCME short exit mayhem 
Here's what I think is going to happen:  
A. this week groups 3 and 4 are going to exit their positions, because there is no reason
for them to stay short as the audit gets closer and the feb puts have already expired.
groups 3 and 4 will mostly be selling their positions to group 5 mon, tues and wed. group
4 will be actively writing more of their hit pieces early in the week, to facilitate the sale of
their puts.  
B. group 2 is going to be calling group 4 all week... asking them... are you buying more
march puts? are you getting out of the trade? what do you have in store for next month?
group 2 isn't going to like what they hear and they're going to get very nervous. they will
start covering their shorts and selling their puts, esp their longer dated puts.  
C. Group 1 is just going to ride it all out through the audit. They may replace the short
positions of Groups 2,3,4 as they flee. (group 1 is a lot like CCME longs who have been
in the stock since last Fall or earlier, some of whom invested a bunch more these past
couple weeks)  
D. By thursday, it's going to be clear that there are not enough of Groups 1 and 5 to let
Groups 2, 3 and 4 exit. It's going to get very crowded at that exit door. The shorts are
going to be racing each other out the door. Stock will go up $1 on Thurs and $2 (or more)
on Fri  
E. By Monday, 2/21, anyone remaining from group 2 and 3 is going to bail (group 4 is
already long gone), and group 5 is going to start freaking out with their losses - they will
start to bail. (group 5 is going to be a lot like people who first went long ccme when that
short squeeze was supposed to happen). Group 1 is going to feel nauseous, a lot like the
long-term longs who saw all their profits go away these past weeks -- with some
wondering "oh shit, what if i'm wrong and this gets REALLY ugly.  
F. CCME Mgmt is the wildcard. There are a whole host of things they could announce that
would light a fire under the stock. This could start as early as Tuesday morning. This is
the wildcard that could cause the stampede to happen earlier in the week rather than later
in the week.

@daniel kaufman: excellent! 
 
Btw: the latest on the ground RESEARCH (not the guessing of the Bronte variety) by
Global Hunter has by and large sealed the case for MW and all the people who shorted
based on MW's (and Bronte's) advice. Of course, anything can still happen over the next
quarters to CCME's business, but for now it is pretty much game over for the short sellers
in ccme.

what way is anything the company says proof that the company is telling the truth. 
 
Apple told Muddy Waters that there are ONLY 2 online distributors in China and they do
not have rights to appoint sub-distributors. 
 
Company PR 12/28: "CME has already signed contracts with many prestigious global and
Chinese domestic companies or their distributors such as Apple"..."SWITOW orders will
directly pass to the contracted advertisers who are solely responsible for order
fulfillment." 
 
Summary: CCME is not a distributor or subdistributor. They advertise and capture orders
that are turned over to Eading for fulfillment for which they are paid a fee. This activity is
the equivalent of an outside commissioned sales rep for Eading. 
 
Your comment: "This is - on the numbers so cheap - that if it were real you would just buy
it. If Muddy Waters did the due diligence and found it was real then buying it is an easier
way to make money than shorting it." 
 
Reaction: How does that argument work? MW has a history of publishing fraud claims.
Have you seen them ever report that a company was a buy and have the stock go up
50%? To suggest that they wouldn't have an incentive to go short, claim fraud and make
a quick 50% profit because the alternative is so compelling is not based upon any
objective evidence that I've found. 
 
Your comment: Second: the company is not behaving like the cash is there. Capex last
quarter was 400K. If the cash is there - 170 million of it - the company would just step and
buy stock. Lots of it. When capex is 400K there is no reason why they need the cash. 
 
Reaction: This again does not appear to be based upon any actual findings. Companies
that are small or microcap with roughly 70% insider ownership historically do not buy
back stock. To suggest that not doing so is an indication the cash is nonexistent just
doesn't appear logical. The company went public to establish a public market for their
stock and needs to increase float to attract large institutional buyers and analysts rather
than reduce it. It's shameful that they should have to even consider caving into the fraud
claimants who have no credible evidence of fraud. Doing so undermines their progress
toward establishing a viable public market for their securities and using their reluctance to
go down this path as "evidence" they don't have the cash is equally shameful. 
 
Hope this is a case of not researching the facts and claims rather than the alternative.
