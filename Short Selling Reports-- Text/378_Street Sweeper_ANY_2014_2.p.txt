Sphere 3D Merger Threatens To Eat Companies Alive
May 28, 2014 2:22 PM ET45 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Sphere 3D owns barely $15 million in assets but is offering to buyout Overland
Storage for more than $80 million.


Canada-based Sphere 3D is a massive money-loser hyping an aging technology
that already exists.


Overland was nearly booted off the Nasdaq multiple times, sports a going concern
issue, claims most recent sales from a recent acquisition and ran up $148 million in
losses.


Primarily artificially fueled, Overland rocketed from 80 cents to about $4 in six
weeks, while Sphere 3D jumped from 44 cents to nearly $10 in 52 weeks.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Overland Storage (NASDAQ:OVRL) knows a zombie when it sees one. The irony is that
the one it sees at the moment is Sphere 3D (SPIHF) (ANY.V), the very company that is
buying Overland.


The two unprofitable companies last week announced an all-stock deal worth over $80
million that within the next four months would hand Overland assets to its current partner,
Sphere 3D. Canada-based technology company Sphere 3D trades on the Canadian
exchange as "ANY.V" and over-the-counter as "SPIHF."


Overland considers Sphere 3D in such horrible shape and of so little promise, it
acknowledged in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings that ANY.V is entirely
capable of pulling down wounded Overland.


Here are a couple highlights straight out of Overland's 10-Q, filed the same day ANY.V
made an astounding offer - a 53 percent premium (~$4.40 offered for shares that closed at
$2.90) to buy out Overland:


"Sphere 3D may not be able to achieve or maintain revenues or profitability"
"Limited trading of Sphere 3D's stock on the TSX Venture Exchange"

Overland crammed its filings with shockers guaranteed to worry any investors who might
assume ANY.V has found a wealthy sugar daddy to revive the company (though the
merger depends partially on ANY.V setting up "bought deal" financing in order to loan
Overland $5 million.) These issues include:


Overland has $2.4 million cash and about $4.9 million in short term investment - and
got $1.7 million cash from its acquisition of Tandberg four months ago.
Though revenue reached $20.2 million, recurring losses and negative cash flows "raise
substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."
Net loss to Overland shareholders is 44 cents. (Net loss of ANY.V shareholders is 4
cents.)


Under the terms of the merger, ANY.V will issue 9.4 million shares on closing, expected
sometime between July 1 and September 30.


At recent prices, the terms would spike ANY.V's market cap from about $190 million to an
even more outlandish $270 million.


So that's $270 million for an overhyped, over-the-counter zombie company propped up by
a suffering San Diego-based company.


"It's like the Wild West when it comes to investing in small cap Canadian stocks," an
analyst told TheStreetSweeper.


ANY.V and Overland Storage have not responded to TheStreetSweeper's requests for
comment.


TheSreetSweeper's recent article on ANY.V may be read here, as well as other viewpoints
on the company.


WHAT OVERLAND WOULD LIKE TO FORGET


To its credit, Overland does have its Nasdaq listing - ANY.V's trying to get listed, too. But
Overland nearly got booted out of that exchange multiple times.


And the fact is that just about 1 ½ months ago, Overland was trading for just 80 cents.
That's right. The stock price zoomed from 80 cents to about $4 in six weeks. And, with its
market value below the $35 million minimum, Nasdaq was once again breathing down
Overland's neck.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2241823-sphere-3d-merger-threatens-to-eat-companies-alive 3/19


Unable to thrill investors with performance and product, Overland pulled off a 1-for-5 split
on April 10 - the second stock split in 5 years. Last month's stock split popped the price to
about $4 and swept away the market value worries. And made it a more believable
merger target.


Much like ANY.V, Overland is a roll-up company. Indeed, along with the stock splits, the
financially stumbling Overland has employed eight acquisitions designed to help prop up
the company.


Industry insiders have been snickering for quite some time about Overland's Snap
Appliances acquisition fiasco. It was largely orchestrated by Overland's CEO Eric Kelly,
who is also ANY.V's chairman of the board, a position he gained last July (along with
about $7.7 million worth of options for 850,000 shares of ANY.V) when Overland struck an
agreement to supply cloud-based equipment to ANY.V.


Mr. Kelly rode Nasdaq delisting threats and executive head-rollings to the position of
Overland board member, then chief executive.


In 2002, he led the purchase of Snap Appliances for $10 million and became Snap's
president and CEO. He later sold the business for $100 million to Adaptec and worked
there as an executive for a couple of years.


Mr. Kelly's Adaptec had quite the reputation in the early 2000s.


Adaptec bought companies, choked on them and then sold them for pennies, Enterprise
Strategy Group's Steve Duplessie told The Channel Register's Chris Mellor.


That's ultimately what happened after Mr. Kelly reportedly influenced Overland to buy the
Snap business back from Adaptec in 2008 for a few million bucks.


So Overland paid $3.6 million for a company that Mr. Kelly had sold just four years earlier
for $100 million.


Mr. Kelly's Snap fell far short of expectations for Overland, according to The Channel
Register. It was supposed to save the day and generate $20 million a quarter but in the
first quarter of 2010 managed to produce less than $2 million.


UMM, COULD YOU PLEASE NOT REPEAT THAT QUESTION?


Analysts did not universally applaud the odd pairing of the hyped, largely unknown
Nasdaq wannabe ANY.V with rising loss-maker, just-by-the-skin-of-its-teeth-Nasdaq-listed
Overland.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2241823-sphere-3d-merger-threatens-to-eat-companies-alive 4/19


Overland and ANY.V held a May 15 conference call to discuss Overland quarterly results
and the merger. A skeptical analyst listening in nagged execs for a measly detail or two.


Analyst: "As far as the background transaction, could you maybe just talk about if
this was solicited or unsolicited? Did you guys hold an auction process for this? Just
talk about how this came about."


Overland's chief executive and president Mr. Kelly didn't answer the question but did opine
about the grandness of the proposed merger. The analyst persisted.


Analyst: "So did you talk to other parties, or was this just a one-off thing?"


Mr. Kelly: "Again, that's not something that we're going to discuss on the call."


Some analysts are prickly about this merger.


"Both companies needed to pull a rabbit from a hat," said another analyst, who
requested anonymity. "So they looked to each other and did a deal, which could be
hyped as forward looking and progressive."


DISTRESSED DEBT FUND MANAGER'S LAST-DITCH EFFORT


Analysts may have been particularly prickly about just how this merger occurred because
money-bags Cyrus Capital Partners has wrangled odd pairings previously. Some analysts
may suspect it's happening again.


The fund manager specializing in financially distressed companies encouraged the
struggling tape and disk storage company Overland to buy Tandberg to attempt to boost
its revenue. The $42 million all-stock merger of the two companies attempting to
overcome their declining antiquated tape storage businesses was completed just last
November.


Cyrus proposed this merger as a major Overland investor and as the owner of Tandberg -
a position it got into because Tandberg could not pay back the money owed to Cyrus. In
fact, Cyrus has loaned millions to numerous strugglers, and, as TheStreetSweeper
explained previously, made it possible for ANY.V to buy tiny, $535,256-revenue-generating
V3 Systems for $9.7 million in cash and stock.


The Overland-Tandberg deal may well have been proposed by Cyrus as a desperate effort
to save whatever possible of its investment.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2241823-sphere-3d-merger-threatens-to-eat-companies-alive 5/19


It looks as though the ANY.V-Overland merger may be the next step in that last-ditch effort
by Cyrus to avoid getting pulled down by those bleeding companies.


SPHERE 3D DEJA VU


Looking at the numbers alone, we've got to ask: How on earth could ANY.V -- with zilch
sales all last year and less than $15.2 million in assets -- fork out $80 million to acquire
Overland?


How? One way you do it is you control both companies.


Indeed, ANY.V and Overland remind us of other controlled, over-hyped, reverse-merger,
weak-product companies with overlapping management. TheStreetSweeper's
investigative subjects like Coronado Biosciences (CNDO $8.65 day of article, now ~$1.70
) and Revolution Lighting (RVLT $4 day of article, now ~$2 ) shared many of ANY.V's
characteristics and ultimately left investors in the lurch.


But a recent ANY.V piece on Seeking Alpha says otherwise. The author suggests tech
companies with no sales can logically fetch a share price that "is simply a recognition of
the potential."


The author continued: "This is why these share prices can be so volatile, as they are
expectations driven and there is little in the way of firm metrics to anchor the price at least
to some extent. The shares of Sphere 3D haven't been volatile …"


The author says that is partially due to low float, loyal support that buys any dip and the
difficulty of borrowing stock to short.


TheStreetSweeper disagrees.


We believe the real reason ANY.V isn't highly volatile right now - and in fact enjoyed a
relatively smooth rise over a year from 44 cents to $9 - is because it's reminiscent of a
1990's style boxed stock.


We've seen it time and again. If and when a company with boxed stock gets listed on a
larger exchange such as the Nasdaq, the stock will become liquid, volatile and shortable.


As we've noted before with these over-the-counter stocks like Lot78, Inc. (LOTE $10 day
of article, now 2 cents) and Jammin Java (JAMN $5.17 day of article, now ~30 cents),
things suddenly go south and shareholders decide to sell, then move on to the next stock.


People will sell. Smaller investors will lose money.

CONCLUSION: FEEL THE BURN


Overland still can't brag about its cash position. It has just over $7 million in cash left and
is burning through it fast while sporting negative operating margins.


"So Overland was desperate enough to take the hugely inflated Sphere stock, and
even agree to a break up clause of $3.5 million," an analyst told TheStreetSweeper.


Indeed, the premise surrounding the merger would make novelist John Grisham envious:
A hyped company with no revenue, interesting management and a product trying to get
firmly out of the chute before everyone turns gray and dies, eyes a buy-out target.


Hopped up on its own hype, ANY.V offers to pay way too much for Nasdaq-listed
Overland, which carries a "going concern" issue, overlapping management, $148 million in
losses and a burning desire for more money as it blisters through its last few million bucks.


"Sphere needed to show that it had a real business - beyond their 'thin' virtualization client
- so they bought a real business, with real sales and very real losses," an analyst said.


ANY.V will need to raise additional cash to cover the burning hole they bought.


"Sphere," said the analyst, "will live to regret this deal."


And so will investors.

While focusing on some standard disclaimers and financial condition is fair game, I suppose, what you leave out is the
fact that the technology has been vetted by quite a few parties:

- V3 Systems 
- Jacobsen 
- Frost&Sullivan 
- Dell 
- Novarad 
amongst others. Keep in mind that V3 and Overland are mainly paid in Sphere 3D shares, which increases the
chances they do have a favorable opinion on Glassware.


While the finances have indeed run ahead of the music, this isn't unusual in a small cap with promising tech, so
valuation metrics might not be all, at this moment.


What you need to do is to demonstrate that the tech is dub and the above mentioned parties are wrong. That's a little
harder than pulling out standard disclaimers, but unlike this effort, it could actually add to the fact finding.

Yes, it "zoomed" from 80 cents to $4 NOT in "six weeks," but rather *instantly*. Perhaps dark forces were at
work in such a "move up." Or perhaps it was just a stock split. Hard to tell (for this author, apparently).

I beleive the title of this article: "Sphere 3D Merger Threatens To Eat Companies Alive"


really means that you are short SPIHF and cannot get out of it, so you shorted OVRL and it went up putting you
underwater on both SPIHF and OVRL.


So it is your company that is getting eaten alive, lets try a new headline.


"We Shorted Spihf and OVRL and are Being Eaten Alive", this one works perfect.


Sonya what do you think?

I disagree with a couple of points in this article:


The $4.9M in short-term investments should't be lumped in with cash.


Because the $4.9 ain't in T-Bills. It is ANY stock! That's right.


"NOTE 3 — SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT - RELATED PARTY 
In July 2013, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Sphere 3D Corporation (“Sphere 3D”). As partial
payment under the supply agreement, Sphere 3D issued 769,231 common shares with a value as of the date of
issuance equal to approximately $0.5 million to the Company. Sphere 3D's shares are traded on the TSX Venture
Exchange. The short-term investment is classified as available-for-sale marketable securities. See note 11 for
additional related party disclosure."


Furthermore, Overland is so strapped for cash that Sphere is lending them $5M right away:


http://bit.ly/1khibHL


And guess what is backing the $5M loan? The $4.9M in Sphere 3D stock.


"In connection with the Merger Agreement, Sphere 3D agreed to loan the Company approximately $5.0 million
pursuant to a note to be issued to Sphere 3D by the Company (the “Note”). The Note will be subordinated to certain
existing indebtedness of the Company and will be secured by inventory of the Company and shares of common stock
of Sphere 3D owned by the Company. "


So Sphere 3D goes out and sells $5M of stock to the market, loans the proceeds to basketcase Overland which
already owns $5M of Sphere 3D stock, secured by the shares that Overland owns. So worst case Overland goes
under and Sphere gets the $5M in stock back so it's as if the whole thing never happened (it sold $5M of stock at
current levels and gets $5M of stock at current levels)


Nice way of keeping cash-strapped Overland's Sphere stock from getting blown out into the market.

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the deal falls through and the whole thing was done to keep those 769,231 shares from
getting blasted out in the market by cash-starved Overland. This thing only trades 76,000 shares per day on average
so that would have made quite a dent, not to mention freeing up the borrow for shorting.


The second is there was a 1-for 5 share split so the move up wasn't as dramatic.


But don't get me wrong I think these are worthless companies.

["I wouldn't be at all surprised if the deal falls through and the whole thing was done to keep those 769,231
shares from getting blasted out in the market by cash-starved Overland."]


But why would they do that when there is a good chance they get on the Nasdaq and shorting might be easier
as a result (that is what the article above seems to suggest with their "boxed stock" argument)


["But don't get me wrong I think these are worthless companies."]


Did you see a demonstration of Glassware? Have you noticed the list of partners or parties that have vetted
it?


I think that while the details of the takeover of Overland are interesting, but the real question is whether
Glassware is able to deliver. There is a growing list of partners and parties which are suggesting it is. The
shorts are right in pointing out the financial weakness of both Overland and Sphere, but are wrong not saying
anything on the tech, or finding out about it.


28 May 2014, 06:07 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
I'm not predicting the deal falls through - just wouldn't surprise me. I think they want that NASDAQ listing bad
as well.


I don't think they are worthless per se - e.g. V3 could be worth what they paid for it. But I think they will spend
more money trying to sell it than they generate in gross margin so I'm not sure any value can be extracted.


One of the problems with commenting too deeply on the technology is there is virtually nothing out there on it.
V3's appliance was easier to look at - basically an blade server running VMWare.


I think the valuation is outrageous so whether it's really worth $5M, $10M, or $50M doesn't really matter.


Overland just looks like a train wreck. Haven't looked at it too closely though.

And I quote:


"They currently can virtualize/emulate with a laptop, what used to take rooms full of mainframes. They
showed us a new device they have developed that is about 1/2" thick and the size of a large credit card that
they have just applied for a patent on, that does the SAME thing. Better yet, they are now working on a single
chip that will do it all. This chip could then be installed in any device, so that device can become whatever you
want it to be. Working on an Apple and want it to become a PC? No problem. Working on a Blackberry and
want it to become an iPad? No problem. As Peter Bookman mentioned to me - the future is software, not
hardware (and I'm paraphrasing)."


Let's remember this has all been developed by a man (Giovanni Morelli) that couldn't spell "chief" and last job
was at a commercial printing company. VMWare, Citrix, and now Intel are definitely sweating bullets at this
point.

I understand the concerns with the finances, but not every situation is defined by it, and this might just be one
of them. In short, if Glassware does what is claimed it does, the company could well be undervalued, rather
than overvalued, in due time.


You seem to depart from the assumption that Glassware isn't up to scratch, but several institutions beg to
differ, or at least that's what one can infer from their public words and deeds.


While I have no first hand experience with it, I have spoken to several people (who I have no reason to
distrust) who have seen live demostrations.


I even understand there is something of "too good to be true" about it (I can't seem to be able to shake that off
entirely myself, I have to admit), but several people I know off came away quite convinced after live
demonstrations.

Ah yes, now we see how stock promotion works. Make a big enough claim: "We've got 50mm, no, 100mm, no
200 MILLION OUNCES OF GOLD IN THE INDONESIAN JUNGLE!" and the investing public thinks, "gee,
well if even half of what the Company says is true, than this thing is worth billions!".

Sphere 3D has demonstrated remote access to virtualized applications in extremely controlled environments.
That can be done with open source software and a modicum of client interface development.

["Sphere 3D has demonstrated remote access to virtualized applications in extremely controlled

Yes, but would the likes of Frost&Sullivan, Jacobsen, Overland, Corel, Novarad, Dell, etc. fall for that?


Perhaps one, but all of them?


While the shorts don't say this, it's clearly what they imply and I think it's quite unlikely.


30 May 2014, 08:44 AM


user432987
Frost & Sullivan did not endorse their product. Sphere paid them a few thousand dollars to write a market
research report based on what Sphere told them their product could do. And if you read the report it is
focused on the differentiation of THEIR remote desktop/application viewer, versus competitors - that is, no
revolutionary virtualization-on-a-chip technology or otherwise claimed.


Jacobs Securities is a sell side investment dealer. Getting analyst coverage is not difficult if you use the
dealer to raise money (pay them large commissions).


Overland. Eric Kelly has made over $6mm in paper gains on Sphere 3D stock. It is a near bankrupt storage
company. This really doesn't need to be examined further.


Corel. Yes, Corel paid Sphere to virtualize their application. As I've pointed out before you can use that app.
http://bit.ly/1porDSE It doesn't work very well. The average rating on the latest version is less than 2 stars.
Sphere no longer seems to acknowledge its existence and most message board longs are focused on the
more recent deals. Nor is it any evidence that Sphere has accomplished anything other than writing a client
for RDP (of which there are many on the market today).


Novarad. It's not clear how much of the Novarad deal has to do with Glassware. In my opinion it is V3
Systems' technology for managing virtual desktops that is the core of this arrangement. Again, "virtualizing"
some of Novarad's software is not difficult. Many open source and competing technologies can do it.
Congratulations to Sphere 3D for this agreement, but it is not evidence of anything remotely proprietary about
Glassware.


Dell. Again, this is almost certainly more about V3 Systems' technology that Sphere 3D's. And, if you recall,
Biosign (last trade 4c) also announced a deal with Dell on its way down from $2.70/sh http://bit.ly/RKriKj.

I might also point to the recent deals announced with Leisure Pools and Nuvollo, a Managed Service
Provider. Based on the Leasure Pools' executive's LinkedIn page he had a prior relationship with V3 Systems
and the MSP is almost surely primarily a customer of V3 Systems - the Desktop Cloud Orchestrator is
targeted at SMBs considering going to a VDI solution. Sphere 3D's website has a huge section devoted how
V3 Systems can help MSPs. It's worth noting however, that just because an MSP is going to offer Sphere/V3s
products it doesn't mean that revenue is around the corner. Think of it more as a distribution agreement.
There might be sales, or there might not. It depends on how the product fits into the entire MSP offering and
what clients ultimately buy.


There's no question that Tassiopoulos and the rest of the Sphere 3D team have upped their game from the
Biosign days. By weaving in acquisitions like V3 Systems (and now Overland Storage) they have quite a bit of
legitimacy they can point to. But at the core, the value recognized by the market is of Glassware 2.0. In my
opinion, there's nothing revolutionary there. Time will tell, there might be a short squeeze. But the longer it
goes on, the more insiders with half penny stock will sell.


I completely grant that Tassiopoulos has massively upped the ante from the stock promotions he was
involved with over the last 15 years. But I don't believe stock promoters often turn into legitimate technology
executives. It could happen, but his track record suggests otherwise.

I don't think it's a matter of "falling for" anything. The prodcut may not be a total disaster if they can get it
working. Most companies are happy to "partner" with anyone that can help move product.


>>"Yes, but would the likes of Frost&Sullivan, Jacobsen, Overland, Corel, Novarad, Dell, etc. fall for that?<<


How many dollars are these companies paying to Sphere 3D?


Frost & Sullivan - Sphere 3D paid F&S on a consulting basis to prepare a market positioning report. The
analyst is gone and in school in India. In any case these are paid high level positioning docs - they don't do
deep technical dives.


Jacob Securities - A tier 3 investment bank looking for underwriting business.


They initiated coverage in October (start of Q4) with a $5.00 target price estimating $315K in Q4 revenue and
$-355K in EBITDA. Revenue came in at $ZERO and EBITDA loss was -$656K but that stock had gone up so
naturally they more than doubled their target price to $12.


The Dell DRIVE initiative is really about Dell pumping servers. The "platform" is basically a Dell Linux Server
preloaded with VMWare for Epic implementations. They would be delighted to have people trying to write
apps, extend the platform etc. Ditto Corel (with the product seemingly a debacle)


What validates technology is bucks. Cash. From paying customters.


At a $200M valuation they had better get some. Fast.


V3 seems like an okay little VMWare VAR so I'm sure they'll find a bit of traction here and there.

Sheldon is a junior speculative resource investor. Not much to promote in that space lately so perhaps he
needs something to do.


Following him into a tech deal can dangerous for the wallet.


I know the regulators took a run at him for stock manipulation a few years back:

Note all those May purchases were done in Pinetree Capital. Sheldon only owns 4% of that company. But he
owns 970K shares of ANY personally.


If he bought stock personally he would get 100% of the exposure. Buying it through Pinetree he only gets 4%
(but the buying pressure seems to help....) But he buys through Pinetree.

This article is pure unadulterated garbage for one reason and one reason alone. The shorts are completely trapped
with over 1.5 million shares short because they did not know what they owned. They thought they were shorting just
another high flying, TSX virtual stock, when in theory, Sphere 3D holds the patent to the next generation of
virtualization/emulation, which very possibly will change the IT landscape for many years to come. An incredibly
damaging mistake for the shorts, as the technology could be worth billions, and judging from the names lining up
behind them to get on board, most industry insiders agree. The latest is Ericsson, and they aren't exactly chump
change. More impressive is the fact that Sphere's phone is ringing off the hook. Consider this also, Novarad who is a
leading PACS provider saw this at the HIIMS Show in Orlando. From first seeing the technology to rolling out their
new groundbreaking NovaGlass product - 60 days. Stunning. So now add this to the estimated number of shares
available that are not already in extremely strong hands of approx. 2-3 million, if that, plus an unknown number of
naked shorts who will have to cover automatically when Sphere 3D gains a Nasdaq listing in approx 2 weeks. What
does it all mean?? It means it will likely cost the shorts their business, which is why they are paying for drivel like this
to be written - the fat lady is just warming up....we can ALL hear her.

Sonya, 
Do you actually research anything you write or just dream things up and put it to pen. Here is your quote. You should
report full, true, and plain disclosure and get your facts right. Here is your quote.


Primarily artificially fueled, Overland rocketed from 80 cents to about $4 in six weeks, while Sphere 3D jumped from
44 cents to nearly $10 in 52 weeks.


The reality is OVRL did a 1 for 5 reverse split so $.80 to $4.00. Clear enough for you.


Sphere went from $.44 to almost $10.00 on its potential. Nothing more nothing less. Look up the words revenue and
earnings because that is what ANY is in the process of doing. Diversified revenue and lots of it. Big partners with
deep pockets and disruptive technology. Your paying partners in Toronto have themselves in a pickle and as we seen
from website reviews your new employer has little or no following. Might want to start looking for a new job.


A few questions for you after reading your bio on the thestreetsweeper website. How about some details as to all
these awards and top honours you have won that you talk about? Looking forward to that as Melissa Davis's profile
was greatly exaggerated and candy coated. Wheres the beef or should we say the truth.


Sonya Colberg joined TheStreetSweeper in early 2012 as a senior investigative reporter after racking up an
impressive pile of journalism awards for her past work at two major daily newspapers. Last year, for example, Colberg
won top honors – recognized by the Society of Professional Journalists and the Associated Press alike – for her
performance in the tough investigative reporting field. During her long and decorated career, she has walked away
with major prizes for her in-depth coverage of business and healthcare as well. A fearless reporter with incredible
writing skills, Colberg has now teamed up with Melissa Davis – another award-winning journalist who serves as senior
editor of TheStreetSweeper – to deliver hard-hitting coverage of risky stocks to the investment community.

It appears that User432987 (who I suppose we have all seen before) is engaging in wishful thinking with his/her
opinion on the Novarad deal. Yes, it's very likely based on Glassware 2.0. The SVP of Novarad stated it himself.


And I quote:


"We have tested many of today's leading virtualization technologies and have looked at a number of potential
solutions; none were able to deliver the simple migration to virtualization and incredible performance that we get from
the Sphere 3D approach to virtual computing." said Paul Shumway, Senior Vice President of Novarad, "The first time
we saw our products run on Glassware 2.0, we were sold."


Read the press release and the heading. "Novarad Selects Glassware 2.0 Virtualization Platform From Sphere 3D"


So who should we believe? A brand new, anonymous account that may be hiding to protect their true identity /
creditability (IE user432987)? Or organizations such as Dell and Novarad? You can bet that all of these companies
have IT experts that have vetted Glassware 2.0. This includes V3 that sold itself in large part for Sphere stock.


The end is near when you see the contrarian outfit rehash the same information that was released in older pieces.
The script is running dry. Reading their posts is like watching somebody doing martial arts moves in front of the mirror

I learned a little bit about the Streetsweeper a few months back. The SS wrote some pieces on another solid company
that I hold in Mimedx. Like Sphere, the stock increased a few hundred percent within a short time frame (after it took a
surprising fall in one day on an untitled FDA letter). Like Sphere, I suppose that a hedge fund(s) shorted the company
when it hit their "high fliers" radar. The script that SS used on MiMedx is similar to the Sphere pieces. They went after
the CEO, dug up as much history and past dealings to call his character in question. I've read enough of the SS to
see that it's a common stunt that they use on companies and their game plan is similar to political campaign dirt
digging coupled with the twisting of facts. The SS will be proven wrong on Mimedx as the company recently increased
guidance and announced a share buyback (not to mention a potential blockbuster in the wings in Amniofix).


Make no mistake, SS is a "hired gun" when hedge funds need a bail out when they're trapped and have exhausted
other methods. Similar to the mafia hiring a hit man to take out a nuisance, these articles push the boundaries of
legality. The word is getting out on SS and they will lose their bite and may have to close shop and open as another
entity. You can only cry wolf so many times before people begin to understand that their sole purpose is to bail out
their client not to provide short ideas for investors.
