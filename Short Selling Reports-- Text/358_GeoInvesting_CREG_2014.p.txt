China Recycling Energy
(CREG) – Two Large
Shareholders Appear Ready
to Dump Shares of CREG
June 27, 2014 By GeoTeam


Between August 2 and August 23, 2013, we performed
preliminary due diligence on China Recycling Energy
(CREG). We believe the summary of recent developments
surrounding the intent of  large shareholders of CREG to
liquidate their entire  positions indirectly support our
preliminary negative due diligence findings that one of
CREG’s projects  was not generating revenue and that its
equipment was  idled during our  observation  period .
(Basically, where there is smoke, there is fire.)


CREG’s Shares Free Falling


Since June 6, 2014, shares of CREG have fallen by roughly
40%.  On June 24, 2014 alone shares fell 30% closing at
$1.67 . On June 25, 2014, the company issued a press
release stating :


“that it is not aware of any material corporate
developments beyond its most recently issued
news releases and filings with the SEC that could
account for the recent unusual trading activity in
its shares.”


Ironically, we believe that some of CREG’s  SEC filings in
June 2014 are the reason behind the stock’s recent weak

performance. SEC filings have given us clues that an
institutional owner of CREG’s shares, Carlyle Asia Growth
Partners , is looking to exit its entire position of 12,465,938
shares, or 20.1% of CREG’s outstanding share count of
60,946,182. Furthermore, another large shareholder of
CREG registered to sell 8,766,547 shares through an S3/A
filing that became effective on June 19, 2014. Together
these shares account for 34% of CREG’s total outstanding
share count. We believe it will be difficult for the stock to
support the potential sale of these shares when given the
fact that the stock’s average trading volume over the last 3
months has been around 95,000 shares.


Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) Agreement
Terminated


According to the Form 4 filed yesterday after market, an
institutional owner of CREG shares, Carlyle Asia Growth
Partners (“CAGP”), sold 200,000 shares at price of $2.00.
 After the transaction CAGP still owns 12,265,938 shares of
the company which constitutes roughly 20.1% of the
company’s total outstanding shares.


Recall that on August 28, 2013 we published an email note
to premium members highlighting the details surrounding
CAGP ‘s intent to sell its entire position in CREG to Great
Essentials, Ltd through a share purchase agreement. Here
is our original note:


“CREG filed an SC 13D/A this morning.  The filing
disclosed that a private equity firm, The Carlyle
Group, that  provided financing ($21.8 million)
for the company around two years ago is in the
process of selling its entire CREG position
(12,265,938) to another entity.  This transaction
works out to a price of $1.75 per share.”

https://geoinvesting.com/two-large-shareholders-appear-ready-to-dump-shares-of-china-recycling-energy/ 3/6


The original terms of the share purchase agreement 
announced on August 28, 2013, called for Great Essentials
to purchase 12,465,938 shares in two tranches with four
installment payment periods:


Period 1: on or before August 31, 2013, $1,000,000.00;


Period 2: on or before November 30, 2013, $2,000,000.00;


Period 3: on or before February 28, 2014, $2,000,000.00;


Period 4: on or before May 31, 2014, $16,815,391.50.


On June 16, 2014 CAGP filed a 13D/A, basically disclosing
that the original SPA has been terminated and that Great
Essentials is only honoring part of its original obligation by
purchasing just 1,142,857 of its CAGP’s 2,465,938 CREG
shares.


“On June 9, 2014, Carlyle Asia Growth Partners
III, L.P. and CAGP III Co-Investment, L.P.
(together, the “Carlyle Entities”) terminated the
share purchase agreement (the “SPA”) with
Great Essential Investment, Ltd. (“Great
Essential”), dated as of August 25, 2013,
pursuant to the terms as set forth in the SPA.
Pursuant to the SPA, the Carlyle Entities agreed
to sell to Great Essential and Great Essential
agreed to buy from the Carlyle Entities a total of
12,465,938 shares of common stock of the
Issuer in two tranches, representing the Carlyle
Entities’ entire share ownership in the Issuer, at
a total purchase price of $21,815,391.50. The
SPA remains in effect so far as it relates to the
obligation of the Carlyle Entities to sell and Great
Essential to purchase the first tranche of shares,
consisting of 1,142,857 shares in the Issuer.”

Since the announcement of the SPA, the share price of
CREG reached a high of $6.05 on March 24, 2014, which is
more than triple the agreed average SPA transaction price
of $1.75.  Given that the average price of the SPA
transaction was $1.75 per share and that CREG shares
tripled since the time of the original SPA, we are
speculating that Great Essentials wants nothing to do with
CREG. We are curious if Great Essentials performed its own
due diligence and reached some of the same negative
conclusions as we did. Great Essentials theoretically left
millions of dollars on the table. We are also curious as to
why it appears that CAGP wants out of CREG when it is
allegedly selling at such a low valuation (Non-GAAP P/E of
6.3).


Pucheng Xin Heng Yuan Biomass Power Generation
Corporation Registers to Sell 8,766,547 Shares of CREG ,
Its Entire Position.


On September 5, 2013, CREG’s wholly owned subsidiary
bought Biomass Power Generation Systems from Pucheng
Xin Heng Yuan Biomass Power Generation Corporation
(PBPG). The transaction was valued at 16.48 million dollars
and was completed through the issuance of 8,766,547
shares of CREG to PBPG:


“On September 5, 2013, our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Xi’an TCH entered into a Biomass
Power Generation Asset Transfer Agreement (the
“Transfer Agreement”) with Pucheng Xin Heng
Yuan Biomass Power Generation Corporation, a
limited liability company incorporated in the PRC
(the “Selling Stockholder”). The Transfer
Agreement provided for the transfer and sale,
from the Selling Stockholder to Xi’an TCH, of a
set of 12MW biomass power generation systems
(the “Transferred Assets”). As consideration for
the Transferred Assets, Xi’an TCH agreed to pay

the Selling Stockholder RMB 100,000,000
(approximately $16.48 million) in the form of
8,766,547 shares of our Common Stock (the
“Shares”), at a price per Share of $1.87.“


On June 13, 2014 CREG filed a S3/A that went effective on
June 19, 2014, allowing PBPG to sell 8,766,547 shares of
CREG.


We don’t see PBPG’s willingness to possibly sell at current
prices as a sign of confidence in CREG.


Conclusion


We will keep tracking this story and provide relevant
information, if any, in the future regarding recent
developments.  In the meantime, the potential open
market selling of CREG shares by two of its large holders
constituting 34% of CREG’s total share count could be an
indication that CREG shares will continue their descent.
