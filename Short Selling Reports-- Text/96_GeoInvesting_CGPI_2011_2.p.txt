GeoTeam Step for
Step with China
Redstone (CGPI)
Mar. 28, 2011 2:51 PM ET | Includes: China Redstone Grou…


If you have been keeping tabs on our due diligence into China Redstone
(OTC:CGPI), you are most likely aware of the red flags we have identified as
well as the follow-up correspondences that ensued between GeoInvesting and
CGPI.  We have also elicited some in depth commentary by a scholar that has
given his insight into understanding Chinese culture and how it may relate to
CGPI or other businesses operating in China.  Although we may not materially
agree with him on the business side of things, he did offer unique and
educated feedback regarding Chinese culture, and we will most likely continue
a back and forth with him. 
 
Our initial report began as follows:

“ "In December 2010, we were contacted by a private investor who askedus to take a look at the CGPI story.  Specifically, he was seeking clarity on
rumors circulating around whether or not CGPI possessed necessary land
use rights to operate its cemetery business.  We asked our attorney, Bob,
to delve into this story not knowing he would open Pandora’s Box.  Bob,
along with our new on-the-ground due diligence team, have performed
extensive due diligence on CGPI operations. What follows is a brief
summary of our findings.  It is supported by a 19 page internal
report and 52 pages of supplemental documents. We have maps,
pictures, documents including land use rights and lease agreements and
conversation notes with government contacts to back up our findings.  At
first, the CGPI story appeared complicated, but after numerous
conversations with Bob, we have been able to simplify our analysis. Our
original goal was to summarize Bob’s conclusions on our focused China
Due Diligence Board, “Ask Bob – GEO’s PRC Attorney”, at
GeoInvesting.com, as we worked with CGPI and its IR firm to hopefully
resolve open issues. They were cooperative."

Subsequently, CGPI released a shareholder letter to address concerns laid out
in the above-mentioned report. 
 
Finally, GeoInvesting issued a rebuttal to CGPI's responses that began as

“ "On March 15, 2011 CGPI published a letter to its shareholders. In thisletter, CGPI summarized key issues raised by GeoInvesting and gave
"facts" regarding those issues. In addition to its letter to shareholders,
CGPI also sent GeoInvesting a "Cease & Desist Demand" letter via its
attorney at the law firm of Richardson & Patel, LLP. In this letter, CGPI
demanded through its attorney that GeoInvesting immediately and
forever take down a grossly inaccurate and misleading report located on
the GeoInvesting web site. What follows are (1) issues and "facts" (CGPI
Response) summarized in CGPI's letter to shareholders, (2) our
responses, (3) a written transcript (see supplement 1) of a conversation
our assigned person had with the officers at the Funeral House and
Cemetery Management Center of Chongqing Civil Affairs Bureau on March
3, 2011 and (4) an additional written transcript of a second conversation
on March 25, 2011 (See Supplement 2) with the officers at the Funeral
House and Cemetery Management Center of Civil Affairs Bureau including
a recording of the conversation."

A commenter (the scholar) produced a well thought out response regarding
Chinese culture, offering a different perspective into the matter.  He closed his
thoughts with a plea to the GeoTeam to exercise patience and prudence in our
investigation:

“ "I believe that the GeoTeam has attempted to act in good faith based oninformation and/or questions which may or may not have been valid in
totality. I also sincerely believe that the investigation and associated facts
and innuendos will prove to be faulty because of an inherently flawed
investigation due to cultural ignorance (by pure definition) and perhaps
cultural insensitivity as well.  Additionally, I also suspect that the
investigatory methodologies, themselves, may well have been tainted for
the same reasons.  In short, statements of raw facts, in and of
themselves, do not ensure an end product which will necessarily be
absolutely truthful or accurate.  In any situation of a like or similar
nature, one must logically and systematically examine ALL of the facts
and background information, including cultural to obtain an end product
that is truly objective, factual, and equitable to all parties concerned.





“ I would kindly and sincerely ask the GeoTeam to move forwardexpeditiously at this point.  Give Redstone the needed time, trust, and
patience to produce requested and required information. I believe you will
be positively surprised.  By the same token, China Redstone must keep
its promises and commitments in order to strengthen investor
confidence.  To do otherwise would reasonably substantiate doubts and
concerns. All parties here must readily admit that China Redstone has
responded to the GeoTeam in a timely manner to the best of its abilities
and I believe this speaks volumes about the character of the company."

“ "Thanks for your comments an professional presentation of your opinions.I agree with some of the points you have made, mainly inferences that
the divergent cultural "rules" when compared to the those in the U.S can
complicate the analysis of Chinese companies.  However, that does not
mean that these companies can play by different rules when they are
attempting to access capital in foreign markets. That would be a like a
U.S. company going over to China a breaking local PRC laws.. Would that
be tolerated?.... 
 
Of course we understand that CGPI is trying to work with the local gov't
to hopefully rectify its issues.  But investors need to know that CGPI does
not currently have a its license, according to our findings.  Period.. This is
clearly an event that requires disclosure under SEC LAW; As are the
reasons  for why believe they have lost the license.  You acknowledge
that there are risk factors, which is exactly why SEC filings have a section
for risk factors...."

We attempt to give the benefit of the doubt to the companies we conduct
research on.  We, as much as anyone else that has been following this space,
have been in the corner of budding and established U.S. listed Chinese
companies in hopes that our investments would reap great rewards.  Our
intent is to help create an equitable environment for the retail investor who
might not have the wherewithal or resources to build a FULL picture.  CGPI's
picture is evolving, and we will be at the forefront of all developments as they
unfold. 
 
Disclosure:  No positions in CGPI
