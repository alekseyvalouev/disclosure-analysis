Predictive’s key original holders and recent Chairman/director have previously been
charged by regulators with securities fraud, including allegations of pump and dumps,
boiler room sales, and false press releases.
Predictive’s CEO Brad Robinson has a checkered history, including allegations of securities
fraud and of non-compliant marketing of a medical product.
Predictive has embarked on a �agrantly suspicious acquisition spree that displays
hallmarks of insider self-dealing. Speci�cally, 4 of Predictive’s 7 acquisitions were entities
based out of Predictive’s own address before they were acquired.
Predictive’s revenue is derived almost entirely from sales of stem cell products, a business
that appears to be predicated on (i) sourcing birthing tissue from pregnant women who
wrongly believe they are donating it to purely non-pro�t causes, and (ii) aggressive
“miracle cure” sales tactics targeted toward elderly customers su�ering from chronic pain.
We attended a sales seminar held by one of Predictive’s largest distributors, run by a
doctor in Georgia. The pitch was targeted toward elderly customers and relied heavily on
aggressive claims and celebrity testimonials.
We also contacted multiple new moms who donated birthing tissue to Predictive’s thinly
disclosed subsidiary under false impressions that their donations were going to be used


Predictive Technology: 95%+ Downside on
CEO and Former Chairman’s Past Securities
Fraud Allegations, Acquisitions That Reek of
Insider Self-Dealing and Dubious “Miracle

for non-pro�t causes.
We believe there is 80% downside to Predictive’s shares purely on valuation alone and
95%+ downside given the issues we have uncovered.


Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in shares of PRED (a
really large short position, in fact). We stand to bene�t �nancially if the stock price declines. This
report represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own due diligence. Please
see our full disclaimer at the bottom of the report.


Introduction: About Our Investigation


This report follows an extensive, months-long investigation, which included on-the-ground
research at Predictive’s facilities in Utah, an undercover meeting with a key product distributor
in Atlanta, and multiple conversations with former employees and industry experts. We also
spoke with multiple new moms who wrongly believed they were donating their birthing tissue
to purely non-pro�t causes such as research into how stem cells can treat deadly diseases.


We have investigated numerous companies and bad actors in our history, many of which have
subsequently been charged by regulators with securities fraud
(https://hindenburgresearch.com/about-us/), and we can’t recall examining a business with as
many issues as Predictive. We think this company is rotten to its core.


Background: Basics About the Business and the Bull Thesis


Predictive went public on the OTC Market via a reverse merger in 2015
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm). Originally, the public entity had been used by a company (https://www.sec.gov/cgi-
bin/browse-edgar?company=predictive+technology&owner=exclude&action=getcompany) that
sold vitamin-laced showerheads
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000135580807000003/sb2.txt), then later
reverse merged into a shoe company
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000114420408011254/v104659_8k.htm),
which then reverse-merged into a housing company
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181810000035/auss0125108k.htm),
before �nally reverse merging into Predictive in 2015. It then applied
(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/05/02/1815340/0/en/Predictive-

2 months ago.

Predictive purports to be a life sciences company that primarily focuses on two lines of
business:


1. Procuring and selling regenerative medicine products (mainly stem cell products derived
from placental/birthing tissue).


2. Developing diagnostic tests to detect diseases (primarily an endometriosis test).


The stock has been on an absolute tear, up roughly 320% year-to-date, fueled by multiple paid
promotion campaigns (1 (https://�nance.yahoo.com/news/pred-early-diagnosis-save-1-
150000437.html),2 (https://youtu.be/C_0Fj4m2EP4?t=690),3

(https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PRED/disclosure) by the OTC Markets for undergoing

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626816950804977_origin.png)The bull thesis focuses mainly on:


1. Growth in the company’s stem cell business
2. Upside from the possible roll-out of the company’s endometriosis test, which has been


touted as a potential game-changer in a large market


As we will show, we think the stem cell business is subject to major operational, legal, and
regulatory risks that are likely to impede (if not totally eradicate) this source of revenue.


We will also show why we believe the company’s latest attempts to roll out its endometriosis
test will sputter. Multiple industry experts have expressed doubts about the viability of the test
and historical marketing materials from Predictive’s subsidiary show a history of delays—the
endometriosis test was slated for a roll-out in Q1 of 2016, but was then tabled for years. We
expect this latest attempt will result in similar delays.


Background: Predictive’s Stem Cell Business Accounts for
Virtually All of its Revenue and Appears to be Predicated
on 2 Key Falsehoods


Thus far, virtually all Predictive’s revenue has come from sales of its regenerative medicine (i.e.:
stem cell) products. [Pg. 5
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form
10a.htm)] The company’s quarterly revenue growth has been on a strong upward trajectory:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 5/64


(Source: OTC Markets (https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/PRED/�nancials))


As we will show, this stem cell business model which accounts for almost all Predictive’s
revenue appears predicated on two key falsehoods:


1. Pregnant women donate their birthing tissue to a subsidiary of Predictive under the false
notion that they are donating solely to research and other non-pro�t causes.


2. The donated tissue is then sold to a network of pain management clinics that then use
high-pressure sales tactics and make outlandish claims about the e�ectiveness of the
product. The target audience for this appears to be the elderly and those su�ering from
chronic pain.


Background: Predictive’s Irregular Acquisition Spree
Displays Hallmarks of Undisclosed Insider Self-dealing


Beyond its core-revenue generating business, we will also explore Predictive’s $120 million+
acquisition spree.


In particular, 4 out of 7 of Predictive’s recent acquisition targets were based out of the
same address, which also happens to be Predictive’s old headquarters
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181816000228/pred022520168k.ht

Predictive’s Headquarters: 2749 East Parleys Way

Acquisitions Before They Were Acquired—The Same Address!

Corporate records from another acquisition target, LifeCode Genetics
(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/life-code-genetics-corporate-docs-
nv/secret/1unThYDx5y2brk), show that Predictive’s CEO/President Bradley Robinson had a
managing role just prior to the entity being acquired by Predictive. We found no disclosure
about Robinson having any stake in the acquisition target.


Predictive has shoveled $120m in cash and stock in what we believe are questionable
acquisitions that are unlikely to generate shareholder value. Predictive is also slated to pay
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000029/ex105.htm) an
additional $12 million in cash installments that extend until 2021 for another questionable
acquisition, based out of the same address, that we will detail further in this report. We expect
this obligation will vampirically drain Predictive’s already-low cash balance for the foreseeable
future.


Background: Three of Predictive’s Key Backers (Who at One
Point Held ~90% of its Shares) Have Previously Been
Alleged by the SEC or State Regulators to Have Committed
Securities Fraud


Lastly, we will explore the background of Predictive’s former Chairman/Director, its key early
backers, its CEO, and its auditor.


Merle Ferguson served as Chairman of the Board of Predictive since its outset as a public
company [Pg. 43
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 7/64


2018. Ferguson then served as a director until March 18
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000081/ex17.htm) of this
year, when he was replaced
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000081/pred03192019form
8k.htm) by none other than former Senator Orrin Hatch.


Ferguson was previously charged by the SEC with fraud relating to allegations that he �led false
press releases as an executive of a public company. Ferguson and another key Predictive
holder, Susan Donohue, later settled the charges.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-15626817792016175_origin.png)We
will show that along with Ferguson/Donohue, almost 90% of Predictive’s shares were controlled
by 3 individuals that had previously been charged with securities fraud either by the SEC or
state regulators. The charges ranged from allegations of engaging in boiler-room-fueled pump
and dumps to issuing false press releases.


In addition to key holders, we also review the biography of Predictive’s CEO/President Brad
Robinson. We found that Robinson’s o�cial biography omits several of his professional
missteps, including running a failed company that attempted to commercialize cholesterol-
lowering algae water. That venture ended up mired in litigation, where Robinson was sued over
allegations of securities fraud (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6t5ISDhuTJgTc) and


th

allegations
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1101026/000107878213001206/f8k061313_8k.htm)
of improper marketing of a medical product.


Lastly, we explore Predictive’s auditor, BF Borgers. The auditor operates a small business out of
Colorado whose clients (https://pcaobus.org/�rms/5041) mainly consist of tiny companies
trading on the OTC. One example is The Lingerie Fighting Championships (Pink:BOTY
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOTY)), which sports a market cap of $200 thousand as of
the time of this writing. We do not view BF Borgers as an auditor credible or capable enough to
handle the size and complexity of Predictive’s acquisition-laden entity structure.


All told, we think key people and service providers surrounding Predictive are major warning
signs.


Background: Priced Beyond Perfection—80% Downside
Purely on Valuation Alone


Given the issues with its core business model, its irregular acquisition spree, and
management’s suspect bios, we view Predictive as totally uninvestable.


But putting all that aside for the moment, with a market cap of $1.1 billion, Predictive is
currently priced beyond perfection, purely on valuation alone:


Price to sales of 24x using Q1
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000157/pred05182019
form10qmarch.htm)‘s run-rate ($45m run rate). (P/S of 29x on a last-twelve-months basis.)
Consistent net losses and an accumulated de�cit of ~$34 million as of Q1.
Tangible book value (net of equity method investments) of -$3 million as of Q1.
Dangerous current ratios of 0.63 and a quick ratio of 0.33. With cash of only $1.8 million
the company has limited short-term liquidity.


Note Predictive’s high intangible asset balances, owing largely to assets acquired through the
company’s acquisition spree:

In addition to the above, Predictive has an agreement with one questionable entity to make
monthly cash payments until 2021 – a setup that we believe will vampirically drain up to $12
million in cash going forward.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 10/64


We also looked at the company’s acquired intellectual property portfolio, which largely consists
of patents/pending patents and early-stage initiatives that would require substantial new
investment in order to even assess its viability. We harbor doubts about whether there is any
meaningful value in its IP portfolio, given the questionable nature of the acquisitions.


Given the company’s absence of net income, negative tangible book value, and spotty
operating cash �ow, we are left with a revenue multiple analysis.


When applying an extremely generous 5x revenue multiple to Q1’s run-rate, we arrive at a
market cap of $225 million, or roughly $0.78 per share, implying downside of at least 80%,
using a highly optimistic valuation basis. However, given the additional red �ags we have
unearthed, we see 95%+ downside for Predictive’s shares.


Part I: Predictive’s Stem Cell Business—Misled Pregnant
Women and Elderly Patients Su�ering from Chronic Pain


As noted above, virtually all of Predictive’s revenue comes from sales of its stem cell product,
which is derived from birthing tissue from new mothers. The tissue is donated to a subsidiary
of Predictive, where, based on our research, it is then stored and then sold to a network of
distributors nationwide. These tissues are said to be rich in stem cells and other growth factors
and form the foundation of the company’s current product o�ering.


In reviewing Predictive’s �nancials, we noticed that the company had incredibly impressive
gross margins, ranging from 55%-94%:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 11/64


This would prompt any person to wonder: how is the company procuring its birthing tissue
product so cheaply?


Predictive Has a Thinly-Disclosed Subsidiary Named
CellSure That Encourages Pregnant Women to Donate
Birthing Tissue to a ‘Good Cause’


As we researched Predictive’s employee backgrounds, we noticed that the head of a key
Predictive subsidiary listed another company on his Linkedin pro�le
(https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-kenneth-olson-01725396/) called CellSure.


On CellSure’s website (https://cellsure.com/about), it describes itself as a “placental cord blood
and tissue storage and donation company” which gives families the option to pay for storage
for their own use or to donate to a good cause.


Curiously, the “About (https://cellsure.com/about)” page for CellSure makes no references to
Predictive and only recently began listing an address.

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626818336785436_origin.png)Similarly, we were unable to �nd any reference on Predictive’s
website to CellSure.


On Predictive Biotech’s website (https://www.predictivebiotech.com/products/), all we see is
the company say that its products are sourced (“ethically”) from donated birthing tissue,
although the source of the donations is not disclosed.


However, when we visited Predictive’s o�ces in Utah, we found that the building signage
describes them as “Predictive Biotech, Inc. / CellSure”:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 13/64


CellSure had likely been operating as an undisclosed related entity until about a month ago on
May 22  2019, when its name was mentioned once in an amended prospectus
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000165/pred05182019form
10a2.htm) as a wholly owned subsidiary of Predictive.


The True Purpose of the Tissue Donated to
CellSure/Predictive Is Obfuscated


CellSure’s website says that it gives parents the option to “help those in need
(https://cellsure.com/about)”, and describes (https://cellsure.com/value) research being done
using stem cells. The implication from this description is that donations go to critical research
for autism, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other deadly diseases.

CellSure’s website implies that its mission is charitable, claiming that the donor’s child will
become a “hero the day they are born.”


We contacted CellSure support and asked about where the donations go. Their response was:


Donations can go towards ongoing research, studies, and to help build our public
bank.


(A public bank is typically a non-pro�t (https://www.babycenter.com/0_donating-cord-blood-to-
a-public-bank_1356495.bc) charitable bank that can be used by members of the community to
help treat life-threatening diseases).


The donors seem to believe this as well. We were able to contact 4 new moms who had
donated to CellSure, per the company’s Facebook page. We approached them on the grounds
of wanting to learn more about the donation process.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 15/64


Three of the four unequivocally believed that CellSure was a non-pro�t that would use the
tissue for things like “(treating) people who are very ill” or “to research ways to reverse many
di�erent diseases”.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626819032471652_origin.png)The fourth donor we contacted actually worked at Predictive
Biotech as a lab manager, per her LinkedIn pro�le. During our conversation, she mentioned
that she worked for a “sister company” of CellSure. When asked if CellSure was a non-pro�t,
she said “I think so” but then claimed not to remember, despite having left Predictive only 3
months earlier.


CellSure is actually registered as a “low-pro�t limited liability company”, which Utah de�nes
(https://corporations.utah.gov/business/lowpro�tllc.html) as a company meant to “signi�cantly
further the accomplishment of one or more charitable or educational purposes” and “would
not be formed but for the company’s relationship to the accomplishment of a charitable or
educational purpose”.

In other words, low pro�t organizations are supposed to exist primarily to advance a charitable
or educational purpose.


The Real ‘Good Cause’: Predictive’s Bottom Line


Recall from our customer service interaction above that we had communicated with Megan
Wyatt from CellSure about all the good causes the donated tissue goes towards. But, from Ms.
Wyatt’s LinkedIn pro�le (https://www.linkedin.com/in/megan-wyatt-05040a147/) we see that
she actually works at Predictive!


We found other LinkedIn pro�les showing that key employees worked concurrently at both
Predictive and CellSure (1 (https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-kenneth-olson-01725396/),2
(https://www.linkedin.com/in/kambree-blackner-a08857149/),3
(https://www.linkedin.com/in/karyn-nuttall-726a2514b/)).


All told, pregnant women falsely believe they are donating their birthing tissue to purely non-
pro�t causes, when in fact it is going to a subsidiary of a public company and then sold for
pro�t.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 17/64


We emailed the company IR asking whether they make it clear to women that their birthing
tissue goes to a public company rather than non-pro�t causes and have not heard back as of
this writing.


Does it Work? It is Unclear Whether the Stem Cells are Even
Alive, Let Alone Functional


Given that Predictive’s stem cell products have not been FDA approved or cleared, they are
o�ered only as FDA registered tissue products. What this means is that it was registered using an
online form through the FDA’s website
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cber/CFApps/Login/Index.cfm), without the thorough
independent vetting of an FDA testing process.


At one point, Predictive apparently portrayed that its product had a large number of viable
stem cells based on a report from a University of Utah lab. However, it turned out that
Predictive had altered the report (https://regenexxusa.wpengine.com/wp-
content/uploads/2017/11/Corecyte-side-by-side-comparison.pdf) to include conclusions about
the number of viable cells which were never actually in the original.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 18/64


A competitor did an analysis (https://www.regenexx.com/blog/will-ever-�nd-live-mscs-another-
cord-product-bites-dust/) of the unaltered lab work, declaring that “these cells have been
through the proverbial wringer.” He couldn’t conclude that there were any live stem cells in the
company’s products.


Doubts about the live cell count of stem cell products are not exclusive to Predictive.
ProPublica (https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-birth-tissue-pro�teers) recently
wrote an investigative piece on aggressive pro�teering in the world of stem cells. The piece
found that products often had little evidence to back up claims of e�cacy and even that many
had no live cells at all.


The ProPublica article focused largely on the Utah Cord Bank, a competing manufacturer of
Predictive which processes similar types of stem cell product. (In fact, Predictive’s Chief
Laboratory o�cer (https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-schmid-89b45915/) was one of 2 key
employees at the Utah Cord Bank before defecting to Predictive
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/B6M5120QgucCDZ)).


Per the ProPublica article (https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-birth-tissue-
pro�teers):


For most of these products, there’s not many healthy cells left,” Daniel Kuebler, the
dean of the School of Natural and Applied Sciences at Franciscan University of
Steubenville, Ohio, said


…Even if there are some cells that are still alive post-thaw, “I have a hard time getting
them to grow,” Kuebler said. “Just because they’re alive doesn’t mean they’re not in the
process of dying.


Lisa Fortier, a researcher at Cornell University and a consultant for a company that
sells birth-tissue products, tested
(https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5982402-Fortier-Proteomic-Analysis-
and-Cell-Viability-of.html) nine (products) from four manufacturers—[Predictive was
not one of them]—and also found no live cells. It is ‘very unlikely’ that the amniotic
membrane “works as a stem-cell product,” she said.


Beyond ProPublica, �fteen doctors from institutions such as Stanford, Cornell, the Mayo
Clinic, and others recently signed a consensus statement
(https://interventionalorthopedics.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Consensus-Statement-on-

v2.pdf?inf_contact_key=aa279efb9973b20b943a7a5a26e44bcd) warning about the
aggressive marketing of non-viable birth tissues as live “stem cell” products.


In short, we believe that Predictive’s products have a lack of scienti�c support, and without FDA
testing cannot make claims that the cells are even alive, let alone make any clear claims of
e�cacy.


However, this hasn’t stopped Predictive’s products from being aggressively pushed forward
through distributor sales channels.


Once Predictive Procures the Tissue, Distributors Use
Aggressive Sales Tactics to Sell it to Patients Su�ering from
Chronic Pain


Once the tissue is donated to CellSure, based on our research, it is then processed and sold
through Predictive to a network of distributors across the country. We found no examples of
the procedures being covered by insurance, owing to the fact that the stem cell procedures are
not FDA tested.


Instead, patients pay in cash. Prices range anywhere from $5,000 to as high as $25,000 per
treatment, based on our conversations with multiple patients and distributors. These
treatments can quickly add up to big income for practitioners.


Many use high-pressure sales tactics, including holding seminars that preach stem cell therapy
as a sort of miracle cure for a wide array of ailments.


Key Distributor Southern Stem Cell Institute: “97%-99% of
Patients Went from Ten to Zero on the Pain Scale”


In Atlanta, Dr. Richard Ambrozic of the Southern Stem Cell Institute (http://www.ssci.life/) (SSCI
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSCI)) is a Predictive distributor who has claimed
(http://www.ssci.life/research/) to perform “thousands” of procedures nationwide.


We initially found (https://regenexx.com/blog/patient-saved-amniotic-scam/) Dr. Ambrozic
through a competitor who identi�ed his a�liation with Predictive. We then con�rmed that he
uses Predictive products from his marketing materials.

Dr. Ambrozic regularly holds seminars for prospective customers and claims that he can use
stem cells to treat nearly any kind of orthopedic condition (along with �bromyalgia, erectile
dysfunction, neuropathy, and a host of other issues) with success rates that completely defy
medical convention.

Key Distributor Southern Stem Cell Institute: Our
Experience Attending a Stem Cell Seminar at a Hampton

We signed up for one of Dr. Ambrozic’s stem cell seminars to get a sense of the experience. It
was held in a small breakout room at the Hampton Inn in Newnan, Georgia, about 45 minutes
outside of Atlanta.

Dr. Ambrozic arrived in a Mercedes SUV covered in stem cell logos. As the participants watched
testimonial videos, Dr. Ambrozic put a lab coat over his surgical scrubs and got down to
business.


Key Distributor Southern Stem Cell Institute: Targeting the
Elderly


The audience at the seminar consisted of about 20 elderly individuals, some with walkers or
canes, and another with a shoulder sling. All were su�ering from localized or general chronic
pain and seemed to be desperate for solutions.


(Pictured: Elderly crowd watching testimonials at an SSCI

At one point, Dr. Ambrozic played a video titled “What will your last 10 years look like” which
juxtaposed the lifestyle of a healthy older man against that of a man in a vegetative state in a
nursing home.

At the end of the video, Dr. Ambrozic asked the crowd:

Key Distributor Southern Stem Cell Institute: Aggressive
Claims


Throughout the seminar, Dr. Ambrozic made other aggressive claims that were potentially
outright false.


Claim #1. Dr. Ambrozic said that the product — which is sourced from Predictive Biotech —
comes from “one of the best [labs] in the world and its actually got awards from the FDA.” (We
have this claim captured on audio)


Reality: We could �nd no record of the FDA handing out awards to any lab, let alone
Predictive’s. The closest we could �nd was an FDA award for ‘Excellence in Laboratory Science
(https://www.fda.gov/science-research/about-science-research-fda/scienti�c-achievement-
awards)‘ which awards groups or individual researchers, but Predictive was not on those lists
either. We reached out to the FDA and Predictive for clari�cation and have not heard back from
either as of this writing.


Claim #2. Dr. Ambrozic claims on his website (http://www.ssci.life/research/) that the average
live stem cells in their product range from 1.1 million to 4.4 million cells.


Reality: We believe this claim cannot be made legally without rigorous independent testing,
which was not presented, nor discussed, at the seminar.

Distributor Neo Matrix Medical: “You Are Not Invincible…
But You Can Be!”


Another Predictive distributor, Neo Matrix Medical, operates a pain management clinic in
Florida. We found Neo Matrix’s a�liation with Predictive through its marketing materials
(https://neomatrixmedical.com/fdacrackdown/), which acknowledge using Predictive’s
products.


The proprietor, Mike Van Thielen, holds a PhD in Holistic nutrition from the University of
Natural Health (https://www.naturalhealthcollege.org/accreditation.php), an online program
that charges (https://www.naturalhealthcollege.org/natural-health-college-tuition.php) about
$7,500 per degree, where there’s “no time limits for completing courses
(https://www.naturalhealthcollege.org/enrollment.php).”


Van Thielen refers to himself as “Dr. Mike” and holds regular seminars catered toward those
su�ering from chronic pain. Here is an image from one such seminar, held by Neo Matrix
Medical. Note again that the audience largely consists of elderly individuals:


We’ve obtained video footage of “Dr. Mike” making aggressive claims to prospective patients. In
the video you will see claims that the stem cell treatments can help any muscular/skeletal
disorder and can even o�er an alternative to facelifts and skin treatments.

Predictive Distributor Southwest Spine and Pain Care
(“SSPC”): An Unusual Relationship Involving a Suspicious
Acquisition


In Utah, we found that the SSPC clinics distribute Predictive’s products through what appears to
be an extra-special relationship.


In October 2018, Predictive acquired an entity called Regenerative Medical Technologies Inc
(“RMT”) for 10 million shares, valued at $9.2 million at time (and valued at over $39 million as of
this writing). (pg. 15
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000029/pred02142019form
10q.htm)).


Utah corporate documents (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/70SkzK75gV7wmN) show that
RMT was founded by Dr. Rick Obray. Dr. Obray is a founding partner

management clinics.


A review of the RMT acquisition agreement [pg. 9
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex104.htm)]
showed that the entity had been formed on January 9 , 2018, only about 7 months prior to the
agreement, and was described in the purchase agreement as having “limited operations”. The
�lings further show that RMT didn’t even have �nancials (balance sheet, income statement, or
cash �ow statement) when it was acquired.


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626820901069171_origin.png)Predictive claimed to be acquiring RMT for its intellectual
property in the regenerative medicine �eld. But in the same agreement [pgs. 26-27
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex104.htm)] we see
that the acquired “property” consisted mostly of highly preliminary assets and drafts, including:


1. Draft product designs;
2. Preliminary clinical trial methodologies;
3. One draft provisional patent application
4. Several early-stage business models

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 26/64


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-15626821098490736_origin.png)In
addition to the above ‘assets’ the acquisition also included “A license agreement for data from
Southwest Spine and Pain Care Specialists, LLC”. Per a press release
(https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/predictive-technology-group-acquires-
regenerative-medical-technologies-inc-1027621279) that accompanied the acquisition, we see
that the licensed data includes “access to data and medical records from patients in 13 clinics.”


In other words, it appears Dr. Obray sold his con�dential patients’ medical records as part of
the deal.


Concurrent with the deal closing, Dr. Obray joined as Chairman of Predictive’s Clinical Advisory
Board. The press release (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/10/predictive-technology-group-
acquires-regenerative-medical-technologies-inc/) crowed over Dr. Obray’s resume and
credentials, yet oddly left out his role at SSPC, which appeared to be his primary occupation.


An obvious question emerges: why would Predictive pay over $9 million for a newly-
formed entity with no �nancials and little in the way of developed intellectual property?


The value of con�dential patient records alone would not seem to explain the large purchase
price for RMT.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 27/64


In what is unlikely to be a coincidence, we noticed that the SSPC clinics began o�ering placental
stem cell therapy around the formation of RMT in early 2018. (Placental stem cells are the
precise type of stem cell that Predictive o�ers.) Per SSPC’s Spring 2018 newsletter
(https://www.southwestspineandpain.com/patient-information/painnews), we see that they
featured the treatment:


When we saw this, we reached out to Predictive asking about clinics that o�er their services in
the area. Sure enough, their response volunteered that they do o�er products through SSPC:

11/4/2019 Predictive Technology: 95%+ Downside on CEO and Former Chairman’s Past Securities Fraud Allegations, Acquisitions That Reek of Ins…


https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 28/64


In short, Dr. Obray looks to have sold Predictive his patient’s medical records and started
marketing and selling Predictive’s products right around the time he formed, and later sold, an
entity to Predictive for $9.2 million. We believe this is all an extremely odd acquisition.


Part I Conclusion: We Believe Predictive’s Stem Cell Product
is Sourced from Misled Pregnant Women and Then
Aggressively Sold to Those Su�ering from Chronic Pain


In addition to the horrifying ethical implications of Predictive’s apparent business model, we
believe the approach exposes stockholders to a range of risks:


Regulatory. The FDA is looking more closely at aggressive stem cell operators, and
Predictive’s size and public pro�le makes it a potential target.
Liability. Patient liability is a real issue, especially for a manufacturer or distributors
making aggressive or potentially misleading claims about the viability and e�cacy of its
products.
Opacity. The more exposure mothers and potential patients have to the true nature of
these businesses, the more informed their decisions will be. In this case, it appears a
better-informed consumer would be severely detrimental to Predictive’s bottom line.


Part II: Predictive’s Acquisition Spree: Hallmarks of
Insider Self-Dealing


Since its 2015 reverse merger, Predictive has paid over $120 million in cash and stock to
acquire 7 companies (including its 49% minority stake in an entity called Juneau). We believe
every single one of these acquisitions have irregularities.


Four of the entities were registered to a handful of di�erent suites at the exact same address
where Predictive had its headquarters. For context, this is the address that was listed as
Predictive’s headquarters:
11/4/2019 Predictive Technology: 95%+ Downside on CEO and Former Chairman’s Past Securities Fraud Allegations, Acquisitions That Reek of Ins…


https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 29/64


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626821576445522_origin.png)And here are the registered addresses of 4 of the 7
acquisitions before they were acquired by Predictive:


From the list above, ReNovo Biotech was formed at Predictive’s address less than 2
months before being acquired for over $14 million. Inception DX existed for only about a
year before also being acquired for over $14 million. In both instances the vast majority of
the purchase price allocation was for “trade secrets.”


We think the real “trade secret” is who bene�ted from these transactions.


In some cases, the answer seems rather apparent. We found that Predictive’s CEO and
President Brad Robinson was listed as a manager/managing member of LifeCode Genetics
just prior to its acquisition by Predictive. We found no Predictive �ling disclosing any stake held
by Robinson in the entity.


We also see that CEO/President Brad Robinson and his brother Eric Robinson had played key
roles in Juneau BioSciences prior to its minority acquisition by Predictive. Brad Robinson
served as a VP of Juneau in 2010, where he was “responsible for developing strategic
partnerships and the company’s capitalization” [Pg. 43
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form

10.htm)]. Robinson’s brother, Eric, worked at Juneau from 2018-2015, serving as CFO, General
Counsel, and director. Robinson did not disclose any bene�cial stake in any of Predictive’s
Juneau share acquisitions on behalf of himself or his brother.


Lastly, the company’s most recent acquisition (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-
release/2019/04/23/1807970/0/en/Predictive-Technology-Group-Integrates-Sales-and-
Marketing-Team-from-FlagshipHealth-Group.html), the FlagShipHealth Group, was an entity
that Predictive BioTech President Tim Lacy had disclosed partial ownership in. [Pg 55
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)] This entity is largely a sales and marketing organization. It is unclear what the �nal
purchase price was, but Predictive has issued
(https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/�nancial-report/211979/content) Flagship
12 million warrants at a $0.50 strike price, along with cash payments of $2.5 million, for its
services. [Pg. 15
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex106.htm)] Today,
these warrants are worth over $40 million.


None of Predictive’s acquisitions seem normal to us.


LifeCode Genetics Acquisition: Insider Self-Dealing?


On January 26  2016, Predictive announced the acquisition
(https://�nance.yahoo.com/news/predictive-technology-group-inc-pred-163000870.html) of
LifeCode Genetics, ultimately paying about $30 million for the entity. [Pg. 34
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)] The press release described LifeCode in a way that made it seem like an operating
business:


LifeCode, a Nevada corporation established in 2011, develops and commercializes
gene-based diagnostics.


LifeCode holds strategic gene-based diagnostic assets, which can assist mothers in
having healthier pregnancies and, ultimately, healthier babies.


Bradley Robinson, President, Predictive Technology Group, Inc., states, “This
acquisition complements the business strategy at PRED. We look for novel assets
which can improve quality of human life.”

Despite presenting LifeCode as being a company that “develops and commercializes gene-
based diagnostics”, we were unable to �nd a website or even web mentions of LifeCode.


When searching for LifeCode on Google, limiting the date range from its formation until the
day prior to the acquisition we found only one hit…where it was brie�y named as a client of
another related-party business that Predictive recently acquired
(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/04/23/1807970/0/en/Predictive-
Technology-Group-Integrates-Sales-and-Marketing-Team-from-FlagshipHealth-Group.html):


(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626821915594845_origin.png)That was it.


We couldn’t even �nd a formal address from LifeCode’s Nevada corporate records
(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/life-code-genetics-corporate-docs-
nv/secret/1unThYDx5y2brk). Instead, it appeared to have listed its registered agent’s o�ce.


Nevada corporate records (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/life-code-genetics-
corporate-docs-nv/secret/1unThYDx5y2brk) also show that the entity’s corporate registration
had apparently lapsed up until just prior to the acquisition. On October 6 , 2015, the entity was
reinstated before ultimately being acquired several months later:

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626822072489855_origin.png)Predictive’s prospectus shows that LifeCode’s sole asset
looked to be a 10.169% stake in a separate entity, Juneau BioSciences, LLC [Pg. 34
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form
10a.htm)]. Juneau, in turn, had generated a total of zero non-related party revenue at the time
(in 2016) and had total assets of only about $213,393 at the end of the year, per Predictive’s
�lings. [Pg. 35
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)] (We will dive further into Juneau later.)


Predictive’s purchase price for LifeCode valued Juneau at roughly $301.9 million.


So, why would Predictive pay over $30 million for a neglected corporate entity that appeared to
have no website, no formal address, no operations of its own, and only held a small stake in a
money-losing enterprise with almost no assets?


On the same date of its corporate reinstatement in late 2015, Nevada corporate records listed
the managing members of LifeCode. On that list is none other than Predictive CEO and
President Brad Robinson:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 33/64


Per a review of CEO Brad Robinson’s biography, he was listed as being a “founding member of
LifeCode Genetics, LLC in 2011” [Pg. 48
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form
10a.htm)] but that was it. Nowhere do we see a disclosure that Robinson held a stake in
Predictive’s own acquisition.


Ronald Barhorst, a current Predictive Director, also shows up as a manager of LifeCode.
Barhorst joined as a Predictive director in March 2019 [Pg. 47
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form
10a.htm)] and therefore wasn’t an insider at the time of the acquisition. Nonetheless, the
collective irregularities around this acquisition make us wonder about Barhorst’s board
stewardship at the company as well.

On March 2  2016, Predictive announced (https://www.marketwatch.com/press-
release/predictive-technology-group-inc-pred-announces-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-renovo-
biotech-inc-2016-03-02) its intent to acquire ReNovo Biotech, ultimately paying over $14 million
for the company [Pg. F-40
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form
10a.htm)]. Predictive’s �lings indicate more than 85% of the purchase price was allocated to
“trade secrets” [Pg. 37
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)]. From the press release, the justi�cation for the acquisition was as follows:


PRED through this acquisition gains access to ReNovo Biotech’s cellular, tissue,
biomaterial and regenerative medicine products, R&D, sales/marketing expertise,
distribution channels and product candidates.


Despite the seeming broad variety of “trade secrets” gained from the acquisition, Utah
corporate records (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1PNm48rfDrJLLN) show that ReNovo was
formed on January 13, 2016, less than 2 months earlier.


Utah corporate records (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1PNm48rfDrJLLN) also show that
ReNovo’s address was 2749 East Parleys Way – the same address
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181816000228/pred022520168k.ht

We �nd it immensely irregular that Predictive paid $14 million to unnamed shareholders,
mostly to acquire “trade secrets”, via an entity formed less than 2 months earlier at its own
address.


Inception DX Acquisition: Predictive Paid ~$14.2 for
Another Newly Formed Entity Based Out of Its Own Address
That Mainly Held “Trade Secrets”


On August 22, 2018, Predictive paid $14.2 million for Inception DX [Pg. F-14
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form

address as Predictive’s headquarters, per Utah Corporate records
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Gbt1pLSIEPPsCP).

The assets acquired included [I] $12.3 million in “trade secrets” along with [II] $800k in cash
[III] 6 pieces of lab equipment worth ~$700k, and [IV] about $440k worth of Juneau BioSciences
shares that Inception DX had been given on the same day of the acquisition as part of an
‘unrelated’ agreement between Predictive and Juneau
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex102.htm). (We’ll
explain.)


A web capture of the InceptionDX
(https://web.archive.org/web/20180806104608/http:/inceptiondx.com/) website from August
6  2018, just weeks prior to Predictive’s acquisition, shows that it was just an undeveloped
template. The website consisted of nothing more than boilerplate Latin ‘placeholder’ text that is
common on brand new, undeveloped website templates. Example from the web capture:


The press release (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/09/predictive-technology-group-acquires-
inception-dx/) announcing the acquisition was thin on details, but seemed to focus on the
importance of having a CLIA lab.

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626823057760425_origin.png)Instead of buying an actual CLIA lab, the acquisition
agreement
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex105.htm) shows
that Inception DX only had “an initial CLIA registration and CLIA lab protocols based on
modi�cations from those used by Taueret Laboratories.”


This was odd for 2 reasons:


1. Predictive had already paid for CLIA lab protocols through an earlier deal. In July 2016, 2
years prior to the Inception DX acquisition, Predictive paid 300,000 shares
(https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/�nancial-report/171938/content) to
unspeci�ed recipients for “protocols related to the operation and management of a CLIA
lab and related genetic tests.”


2. Predictive ended up acquiring Taueret (https://www.marketwatch.com/press-
release/predictive-technology-group-completes-acquisition-of-taueret-laboratories-2019-
03-26-8184043), the company that the CLIA protocols were based on, just months later.
This acquisition included a CLIA lab, rendering the CLIA protocols purchased from
Inception DX seemingly useless.


We �nd it suspicious that Predictive paid unnamed recipients twice for mere CLIA lab protocols,
only to end up buying the very lab that the CLIA protocols were based on months later anyway.


The remaining “trade secrets” detailed in the purchase agreement
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex105.htm)
consisted of “Gen DB records- birth, death, or marriage records for over 31,900,000
individuals.” This asset also looks to have been moved into Inception DX from Taueret

Laboratories, given that the database was proprietary to Taueret Laboratories
(https://web.archive.org/web/20170412180024/http:/taueret.com/Taueret_Laboratories/Tauer
et_Laboratories_GenDB.html) prior to the formation of Inception DX.


As noted above, the Inception DX deal also included 400,000 shares of Juneau BioSciences.
Inception DX acquired these shares on the exact date of the acquisition as part of an ‘unrelated’
agreement
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex102.htm) struck
between Predictive and Juneau.


That agreement called for Juneau to use Inception DX’s CLIA lab in exchange for an immediate
payment of 400,000 shares to Inception DX. Again, Inception didn’t have a CLIA-certi�ed lab,
nor ever ended up getting one as far as we can tell.


In other words, Predictive negotiated a deal with Juneau to have Juneau give Inception DX
400,000 shares of Juneau to use a lab that didn’t exist, and then acquired Inception DX later
that day, using the 400,000 shares as a partial rationale for the acquisition. (To pose an obvious
question: why wouldn’t Predictive just have negotiated to be paid the Juneau shares directly?)


Our suspicions are punctuated by the fact that every one of these entities (Predictive,
Inception DX, Juneau, and Taueret) shared the same address: 2749 Parleys Way, Salt Lake
City, Utah. Talk about circular dealing!


Inception DX Acquisition: 90% of the Purchase Price Went
to Unnamed Individuals in the Caymans


This all begs the question, why would Predictive pay over $14 million for a newly-formed entity
with only [A] cash and lab equipment worth $1.5 million, and [B] some assets apparently
shu�ed in from other entities based out of Predictive’s same address?


Deal records show that 90% of the acquisition value went to an entity in the Caymans with
unnamed owners.

We reached out to Predictive’s investor relations to gain more clarity on who the shareholders
of Inception DX Cayman were, but the IR rep was unable to provide them.


We also reached out to the company to ask whether all of its acquisitions were truly arms-
length, and have not heard back as of this writing. We will update this if we receive a response.


We encourage the company to provide the investing public with details of the shareholders of
this Cayman entity (and of the company’s other acquisitions), as such information could easily
clarify whether any related party dealings took place in these transactions.


Juneau BioSciences Acquisition: A Tiny Company with Deep
Connections to Predictive’s CEO And His Brother


Next let’s turn to Juneau Biosciences, a company that develops genetic tests related to women’s
healthcare. [Pg. 48
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/pred04182019form
10a.htm)] In particular, Juneau has been developing a test for endometriosis called the
ArtGuide, which it hopes to commercialize this year.


Juneau was formed in 2006 and is a small company with limited �nancials. The 2017 balance
sheet reported total assets of just $183,190 and liabilities of $2.647 million. [Pg. 35
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form

Predictive’s �lings include Juneau’s 2016 and 2017 �nancials, which show that all revenue was
related-party. The company reported a loss in each year: [Pg 36

state [Pg. 1
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000124/ex992.htm)]:


The Company’s lack of liquidity and recurring operating losses raise substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern.


We contacted a former employee who worked with a related company via LinkedIn, asking to
speak as part of our due-diligence. He said that Juneau had about 5-6 dedicated employees by
2013, focused primarily on endometriosis research. By all measures, it was a modest
organization.


Despite its small size, the company seems to have been signi�cantly in�uenced by Predictive
CEO/President Brad Robinson and his brother Eric Robinson.


Per Brad Robinson’s bio we see that he previously served as the VP of Business Development
for Juneau starting in 2010, and “was responsible for developing strategic partnerships and the
company’s capitalization.” [Pg. 43

We also found that Eric Robinson had served as Juneau’s General Counsel
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1400105/000140010510000002/xslFormDX01/prima
ry_doc.xml), Chief Financial O�cer (https://www.accesswire.com/442381/ActiveCare-Appoints-

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1429896/000121390017003262/fs12017a6_activecar

Juneau BioSciences Acquisition: Predictive Has Paid Over
$50 Million For Its Minority Ownership in Juneau, and is
Expected to Make Another $12 Million in Cash Payments By
2021


Despite its modest size and apparent precarious �nancial state, Predictive has directed a
tremendous amount of money toward Juneau, starting as early as 2013. [Pg. F-18
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)] Since that time, we calculate that Predictive has paid over $22 million in cash and
stock to purchase shares from unnamed shareholders and debtholders of Juneau and to
support Juneau’s various obligations.


Predictive has also added to its Juneau stake by acquiring 2 other companies that held shares
of Juneau, including a ~$30 million purchase of LifeCode Genetics, an entity whose apparent
sole asset was a stake in Juneau.


Finally, Predictive’s minority 49% stake in Juneau hasn’t even been fully paid. The company is
slated to pay roughly $12 million in monthly cash payments between now and 2021 in order to
purchase additional Juneau shares. [Pg. 1
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000029/ex105.htm)]


Despite all the cash and stock that has been directed into modestly-sized Juneau, Predictive’s
economics on the deal leave something to be desired. It is expected to split net pro�ts that
come out of the Juneau relationship 50/50 [Pg. 8
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex101.htm)], and is
obligated to pay another $2.5 million worth of stock if there is ever a commercial �rst sale of
Juneau’s endometriosis test, along with other milestone payments. [Pg. 8
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex101.htm)]

Juneau BioSciences: Did Predictive Buy A Potential Game
Changer in Endometriosis Diagnostics Testing – or a Dud?


So, what has Predictive purchased using all that cash and stock?


Juneau is hoping that its ArtGuide test, which is currently in development, will revolutionize
diagnostic testing for endometriosis, a painful disorder that a�ects millions of women and can
be associated with infertility. Currently, there is no blood test that can identify endometriosis
through DNA biomarkers.


The ArtGuide test would be considered a Laboratory Developed Test which will not undergo
FDA testing. This will make reimbursement a challenge, leaving the company to target self-pay
markets [Pg. 9
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm) & Pg. 6
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)].


In October 2018, Predictive announced (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/10/predictive-
diagnostics-launches-endometriosis-risk-test/) that it is beta testing its ArtGuide test and hopes
to launch it in Q2 of this year. Despite these forward moving signs, industry experts and the
company’s own missed historical milestones give us strong doubts about whether this latest
announcement truly represents a leap forward toward rapid commercialization.


Juneau BioSciences: Proposed Endometriosis Test Already
Being Met with Industry Skepticism


When we saw Juneau’s October announcement (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/10/predictive-
diagnostics-launches-endometriosis-risk-test/) about the ArtGuide test’s imminent
commercialization pathway, we reached out to several endometriosis experts to get their take.
They were unanimously skeptical.


This is what the CEO of the World Endometriosis Society (operators of Endometriosis.org
(http://endometriosis.org/)) told us:



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form10.htm

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 43/64


We did see the press release from Juneau BioSciences last year.


However, there has been no peer reviewed publication in the scienti�c literature about
this ‘discovery’, its methodology, population(s) tested, sensitivity/speci�city of the test,
types of endometriosis detected, etc.


Nor is there any evidence/basis to the claim that ‘27 million women in the United
States are symptomatic of endometriosis’.


This joint statement from the World Endometriosis Society and the World
Endometriosis Research Foundation remains status quo.


The ‘joint statement’ is referring to a March 2018 a consensus statement
(https://endometriosisfoundation.org/news/article/diagnostic-biomarkers-for-endometriosis/)
put out by both the World Endometriosis Research Foundation (WERF) and the World
Endometriosis Society (WES (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WES)), two of the largest
endometriosis research organizations. The statement looks to have been aimed at debunking a
slew of claims by various proprietors to have ‘solved’ the endometriosis biomarker conundrum
(the very type of claim being made by Juneau). From the statement:


To date there are no data that de�nitively support any claims of a validated
diagnostic test – or any combinations of tests – to accurately diagnose
endometriosis or provide monitoring of disease progression/regression… There
are presently no endometriosis diagnostic or treatment biomarkers that have been
demonstrated to have the validity and reliability necessary to be used in routine
clinical diagnosis or care.


We also contacted the Endometriosis Research Center (endocenter.org
(http://www.endocenter.org)) and received this response:


Thanks for reaching out to the ERC. We are aware of blood tests for diagnosing
endometriosis. Although they provide a good step towards learning more about
this disease, there are concerns. We continue to monitor the research.


The Feinstein Center for Medical research wrote the following to us:

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 44/64


The short answer is due to the complexity of the genetics involved in endometriosis
(based on VERY large studies) – it seems unlikely genetics alone will successfully
diagnose this complex condition.


Juneau BioSciences: Lackluster Product Development
Track Record Thus Far


Several historical false starts by Juneau lead us to believe that the skepticism expressed by the
experts we contacted is likely to be well-founded.


2013: The company announced (https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/juneau-
biosciences-names-b-dr-dinesh-patel-b-to-board-of-directors-/), “After �ve years in research
and development, Juneau is now poised to launch their novel EndoRisk test for women
experiencing infertility.” Nearly six years later, the test still has not launched.


2015: Juneau representatives participated in a webinar (https://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=zq4O7R7dNxI&fbclid=IwAR2miRxAJJ67K-
I_QzV38jPVfEug2inAVDbidHFvq5Na6pmX5CXlj2Hs_5w) describing the di�culties associated
with coming up with a test and suggested that they were at least a couple of years out from
identifying a gene.


2016 (January): Predictive put out marketing materials (http://predrx.com/wp-
content/uploads/2016/02/PRx-Exec-Summary-01-16.pdf) indicating that Juneau’s EndoRisk test
would be commercialized imminently, with an “initial launch to fertility clinics” slated for that
same quarter. They also targeted a launch to the “general primary care provider and OB/GYN
market” slated for later in the year. Again, the EndoRisk test has still yet to be released
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000029/ex105.htm).


(Note that the marketing materials show the company targeted launching 4 other tests that
same year, none of which look to have been released.)

2016 (April): The company’s corporate entity apparently lapsed, as a reinstatement �ling
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/r9c6EpOYFo46nn) was made.


2017 (October): A Facebook post
(https://www.facebook.com/endtoendo/posts/10154826361047301) apologizes for going
dormant and then says the company needs more study participants.


2018 (February): Predictive announces (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/02/february-20-2018/)
a “crucial milestone” in the development and commercialization of ARTGuide:


After testing thousands of women as part of the development program, the Company
now expects commercial launch of the ARTGuide™ infertility test in the United
States during Q3 2018.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 46/64


2018 (October): Press release (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/10/predictive-diagnostics-
launches-endometriosis-risk-test/): ArtGuide is being beta tested and company claims it “will be
made available to the entire US infertility market in the second quarter of 2019.”


All told, we are highly doubtful that this test will represent a near-term commercial success for
the company.


Taueret Laboratories Acquisition: Yes, This Was Also Based
Out of the Same Address (But, at Least This Acquisition Had
a CLIA Lab, Equipment, and its Bene�ciaries are Disclosed)


On August 22, 2018, Predictive acquired “DNA and Ancestry Assets” from Taueret Laboratories,
LLC for over $15 million. [Pg. 38
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/pred12042018form
10.htm)] The press release announcing (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/10/predictive-
technology-group-acquires-key-dna-and-ancestry-assets/) the acquisition seemed to
acknowledge that the acquisition was slightly o�-center from Predictive’s business strategy:


Although our focus remains on endometriosis, the acquisition of these key DNA and
ancestry assets signi�cantly strengthens our development platforms to commercialize
gene-based diagnostics and biotechnology treatments for other debilitating diseases


The DNA biobank was described in the purchase agreement in less-than-exhilarating terms [Pg.
20 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex103.htm)]


These samples were all collected more than 15 years ago. A precise inventory of
samples is not feasible, and some samples have been consumed or have become
degraded…The collection is useful for pilot studies and con�rmatory studies, but no
warranty is made as to their relevance or usefulness for any particular disease
discovery target.


Corporate �lings as far back as 2008 (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/jkWJghvY3JiOst) show
that Taueret’s o�cial address was 2749 East Parley’s Way, Suite 100, Salt Lake City, Utah. The
address was the same address of Predictive. Here is a �ling from 2013
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ADpmV2yGRLeU9M) showing this as well:

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-
15626825746475558_origin.png)Following the purchase of DNA assets, Predictive later paid
another $9.7 million in cash to purchase the Taueret entity, [Pg. 1
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000029/ex21.htm)] with
about $8.5 million of that amount deferred until 2020. [Pg. 5
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000085/ex1001.htm)] The
remaining purchased assets largely consist of lab equipment, lab certi�cations, 3 provisional
patents and 1 utility patent relating to preeclampsia, and 452,000 shares of Juneau BioSciences.

We spoke with several former Taueret employees that we contacted through LinkedIn who said
the business had about 15 employees around 2012-2013. The company primarily processed
DNA micro-array samples for Ancestry.com (http://ancestry.com), but then lost the business
and was forced to lay o� much of its workforce.


The company also had later performed testing for several clients, but that line of revenue
became impaired due to changes in reimbursement for its main test.


Note that Taueret was the only transaction where we were able to see who received proceeds
from the transactions (in Exhibit B
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000029/ex21.htm) of the
acquisition agreement and Exhibit A
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181818000241/ex103.htm) of the
intellectual property agreement) and the bene�ciaries look to be the stated owners/operators
of the business.


Part III: The People Behind Predictive


Predictive’s Chairman (Until Late 2018) and Two Other Key
Early Backers Had Previously Been Charged with
Securities Fraud


Nevada corporate records
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181815000199/ex302.htm) show
the early holders of Predictive from its outset as a public company in 2015. Based on that list,
we found that 89.56% of Predictive’s early shares were held by entities run by 3 individuals that
had been previously charged with securities fraud.

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-

the above (Trade Exchange International
(https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?

(https://www.nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?
lx8nvq=XyjnSgDJ2vUpcFTSJ96SFQ%253d%253d&nt7=0)) collectively held 47.41%
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181815000199/ex302.htm) of
Predictive at the time. The entities were registered to Ferguson and Donohue, per Nevada
Corporate records.


Ferguson served as Chairman of the board of Predictive, and continued serving in that capacity
until his replacement (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-
release/2018/10/30/1639172/0/en/Predictive-Technology-Group-Appoints-Industry-Veteran-

director until March 18
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000081/ex17.htm) of this

8k.htm) by former Senator Orrin Hatch.


In 2001, both Ferguson and Donahue were charged by the SEC
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17328.htm) with securities fraud. SEC prosecutors
alleged (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17328.htm) that the pair had issued
multiple false and misleading press releases about a company where they served as
President/CEO and treasurer respectively. Both were ultimately �ned and/or enjoined
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17328.htm) from future violations.

As shown above, Price was featured prominently in the SEC boiler room complaint but was not
charged directly. He was charged by the Illinois Securities Department
(https://www.ilsos.gov/adminactionssearch/adminactionssearch?

similar allegations of securities fraud in relation to selling of penny stocks. Price ultimately
settled those charges (https://www.ilsos.gov/adminactionssearch/adminactionssearch?

We �nd it immensely disconcerting that the vast majority of Predictive shares were controlled
by individuals alleged by various regulators to have been engaged in pump and dump
schemes, issuing false press releases, or boiler room sales, including Predictive’s Chairman.


Predictive’s CEO/President Bradley C. Robinson Le� Some
Things O� His O�cial Biography, Including Allegations of
Securities Fraud and Allegations of Non-Compliant
Marketing of a Medical Product


Beyond its key backers, we explored Predictive CEO/President Bradley Robinson’s track record
in more detail and discovered several red �ags and omissions.


Around 2010, Robinson led a company called Ceptazyme
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/bnfyTqrbxPxbuJ) (and a related company called Zus Health)
which sought to market an algae water product grown in distilled water that the company
claimed could lower cholesterol.


In an investor lawsuit
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1101026/000107878213001206/f8k061313_ex1z1.ht
m), Robinson was alleged (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/6t5ISDhuTJgTc) to have engaged
in securities fraud relating to the business. The complaint alleged that Robinson made
grandiose claims about the product’s e�cacy and claimed that it would be pitched by Dr. Oz,
the Gates Foundation, and others. None of the claims ever materialized. Per a local news article
(https://www.courthousenews.com/algae-water-hey/) that covered the story:

court document (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/Ak1JVqp9cJRnjB) we found indicated that a
resolution was pending.


The algae company had also struck a partnership with a public company to market the product,
but the deal quickly fell apart, with the public company also suing Robinson
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1101026/000107878213001206/f8k061313_8k.htm)
over allegations that his company:


Failed to market the Registrant’s product in a manner compliant with state and
federal regulations, and allowed its distributors to make claims and representations
that were not in compliance with applicable regulations, among many other breaches.


Those allegations strike us as extremely prescient given Predictive’s current business.


The charges between the two companies were ultimately settled
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1101026/000107878213001206/f8k061313_ex1z1.ht
m) without any admission of wrongdoing.


Aside from the Ceptazyme debacle, Robinson also left his role at ActiveCare o� his o�cial
biography. ActiveCare was a public company focused on diabetes management. Robinson and
his brother Eric served at ActiveCare

All in the Family: The CEO’s Brother Represents a
Construction Company Hired By Predictive


Speaking of brotherly a�liations, Predictive CEO/President Brad Robinson and his brother Eric
have been involved in multiple business interests. As we noted earlier, both Brad and Eric had
key roles a Juneau, a company that Predictive has had deep business ties with. Both brothers
also had brief roles at public company ActiveCare (which went bankrupt), and both were
involved in Specialized Health Products, Inc., led by their uncle and Father.


When we see family members that regularly engage in business with one another, especially
when those businesses overlap with public company interests, we look for potential
undisclosed related-party transactions.


Eric Robinson is an attorney by trade. A check of his Utah bar pro�le
(https://services.utahbar.org/Member-Directory/Pro�le?customercd=6641) shows that he
currently works at Eckman & Mitchell, a construction �rm. On the Eckman Construction
website, we see that an upcoming project is planned
(https://eckmanconst.com/portfolio/healthcare/) for…Predictive Biotech

(https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/7/9/912443-15626826843701706_origin.png)We
�nd it rather odd that Robinson’s diverse interests — ranging from construction to laboratory
science — overlap with a public company run by his brother. Nonetheless, if Eckman has
launched this project (or does in the future) we hope the company will disclose the
compensation paid on this deal.


Predictive’s CEO/President Bradley C. Robinson: O�cial
Biography Doesn’t Tell the Full Story


Much like the details omitted from CEO Brad Robinson’s o�cial bio, the items included also
raise questions. For instance, here are several claims that we have taken the “shine” o� of and
“un-spun”:


Claim: Robinson’s o�cial biography
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181819000165/pred05182019form
10a2.htm) states he “was the CEO and co-founder of Infusive Technologies, LLC from
November, 2004 until September, 2008 when it was acquired by Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc.”


Un-Spun: Sagent acquired (https://www.�ercebiotech.com/biotech/sagent-pharmaceuticals-
inc-acquires-rights-to-multi-chamber-syringe-technology-and-launches) Infusive’s key assets
relating to a new syringe technology (not the whole company
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797564/000136086511000012/hst8kjan272011.txt).)
Sagent paid $1.25 million up-front for the technology, then was slated to pay additional
amounts upon achievements of certain milestones, including upon receipt of an FDA 510K
device approval.


The Sagent deal ended in litigation, however. According to a 2011 lawsuit
(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/FpeD5a0HwJObiY) �led by Robinson’s entity, Sagent failed
to advance the commercialization of the technology.


Sagent countersued (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/4igtyXrS5xH2hN), detailing how the
device was rejected by the FDA with a de�ciency letter. Sagent alleged that Robinson botched
the 510k application, and that he also concealed material facts from Sagent including
[I] knowledge that former employees did not properly assign their patents to Infusive, and
[II] knowledge that international patent applications had been botched as well.

https://hindenburgresearch.com/predictive-technology/ 56/64


The parties ultimately settled (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/yGSgl7K1KwtN29) on
undisclosed terms. Robinson’s entity, Infusive, was apparently allowed to keep the FDA-rejected
syringe technology, because Infusive later took the technology public via reverse-merger
(https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/-b-global-holdings-inc-gbhd-b-acquires-b-infusive-
technologies-llc-b-and-its-chasyr-multi-chamber-syringe-technology-/) in the entity that
ultimately became Predictive! [Pg. 20 (http://predtechgroup.com/wp-
content/uploads/2018/06/PRED-June-30-2017-Financial-Statements-FINAL1.pdf)]


(Merle Ferguson, the SEC-alleged securities fraudster who became Predictive’s Chairman, was
CEO (https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/-b-global-holdings-inc-gbhd-b-acquires-b-
infusive-technologies-llc-b-and-its-chasyr-multi-chamber-syringe-technology-/) of the entity at
the time in 2014.)


Claim: Robinson’s o�cial biography (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/03/brad-robinson-full-
pro�le/) states that he “studied accounting at the University of Utah and received a Masters of
International Management from the Thunderbird”.


Un-Spun: This is true, but while Robinson studied at the University of Utah, he never actually
graduated (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2cG4i9iVelOMml). He later received an executive
MBA (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/khWBk0e2Tn9hVB) at Thunderbird, which doesn’t
require an undergraduate degree. A Thunderbird admissions o�cer told us that the
undergraduate degree requirement can be “surpassed by the quality and quantity of
professional work experience a student had at that time.”


Claim: Robinson’s o�cial biography (http://predtechgroup.com/2018/03/brad-robinson-full-
pro�le/) states that he was a “Director/Co-Founder of Specialized Health Products, Inc. (“SHPI”),
acquired by C.R. Bard, Inc.”


Un-Spun: This is also true, but SHPI was actually run by Robinson’s uncle, who served as
Chairman and CEO. Robinson’s Dad served as the CFO. SEC �lings
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790228/0000931731-96-000189.txt) show that
Robinson was around 24 years old when he joined, an apparent fresh college drop-out at the
time, yet was given a board seat at the family business.


And that pretty much brings us full circle.


So who audits this total gem of a company?

Predictive’s Auditor: Have You Ever Heard of BF Borgers?
Neither Had We


Predictive has gone through several auditors in recent years, which we generally �nd to be a
red �ag. On February 28  2017, the company announced
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382943/000109181817000025/pred02280178k.ht
m) that it was appointing Sadler, Gibb & Associates, LLC (“Sadler”) as its auditor, replacing
Stevenson & Company CPAS.


Predictive switched to BF Borgers around 2018
(https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/�nancial-report/197235/content). BF
Borgers is a roughly 25-person �rm (https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?
FirmID=F0C298206D055E20355165A6436401FA) based in Colorado and can be found through
the website www.denveraudit.com (http://www.denveraudit.com). If you’ve never heard of BF
Borgers, we won’t hold it against you – neither had we. You are unlikely to �nd their clients
anywhere on the S&P 500 (or any major national exchange for that matter).


Most of BF Borgers’ clients (https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?
FirmID=F0C298206D055E20355165A6436401FA) are sub $20 million market cap companies
that are listed on the pink sheets, including esteemed �rms such as:


Kisses From Italy, a restaurant chain based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida that aspires to list
on the OTC market if approved to do so. [Pg. 1
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1608092/000168316819001068/kisses_10k-
123118.htm)]
The Lingerie Fighting Championships (Pink:BOTY
(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOTY)), with a market cap of $200 thousand as of this
writing, and which is exactly what it sounds like. (Video Link

entity structure, which includes its multiple acquired subsidiaries.

Conclusion: Our Predictions for Predictive


As one former employee of a subsidiary wrote us about Predictive’s management:


I don’t trust them implicitly, their motives never seem entirely open, there’s always a
‘play’ in everything they do.


We couldn’t have said it better ourselves. A company displaying hallmarks of insider self-
dealing that also seems to be taking advantage of vulnerable pregnant women and elderly
patients su�ering from chronic pain strikes us as a terrible investment opportunity. We have
some predictions for how things will play out next:


We think Senator Orrin Hatch may resign. We have seen no indication that he is aware of
any of the business issues here. (As a recently retired member of the Senate, we �gure he
may have thought he was just getting paid for some pretty light board work at an
interesting local company.)
We predict the company will issue some sort of threatening press release that dodges
most of the substance of this report.
We expect the company to be slated for a massive repricing of its stock in the near-term
and potential regulatory intervention over time.


Safe investing to all.

SEC/OTC �lings.

This was terri�c reporting. I would like talk about how I got introduced to this company and
some of the red �ags I found along the way when I was conducting research. I work at a
shipping company that goes to predictive biotech. I noticed an uptick in the volume of
packages that they were shipping. I also noticed that they were expanding their operation by
taking over the whole �oor that their o�ce operated in. Those factors led me think that this
could be a good investment. However, I noticed some red �ags as well. I too noticed the large
assets on their balance sheet like Trade secrets, and equity method investments which when I
went through their 10-Q I didn’t get much explanation for what these assets were. Another red
�ag was when I tried to call them to get information about where they get their stem cells. I
was unable to get ahold of anyone at their o�ce and when I left a message no one contacted
me back.
However, besides the red �ags i picked up on my naivete and my lure of their optimistic press
releases led me to invest anyways. I got lucky and still made a healthy return on my
investment. I got out when their EV/Revenue multiple far exceeded their peers. I was looking to
get back in when the price came down but thank goodness I read this report before that
happened. Thank you again for your excellent reporting.
P.S. I am a �nance student whom has been inspired by this report and would love to learn
more about you guys.
