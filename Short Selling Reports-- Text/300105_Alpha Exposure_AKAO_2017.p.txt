In today's biotech market, investors do not seem especially concerned with risk. For
many investors, diligence begins and ends with a company declaration of data as
"positive". We aren't most investors. We view the Achaogen (NASDAQ:AKAO)
Plazomicin data with suspicion; not for the results it presented but rather for the details
that were omitted. In this report, we will show that the data from Achaogen's EPIC
(Evaluating Plazomicin in cUTI) Trial is far less impressive than the company would
have you believe. We think Achaogen's present data package is insufficient to support
FDA approval and may even receive a refusal to file letter. Even if approved, the
potential market opportunity for Plazomicin should the drug reach the market is likely to
be de minimis. Finally, we offer a fair value estimate for Achaogen's shares based on
this analysis.


To summarize, we believe that:


The Plazomicin "superiority" claim is likely the result of differences between the
study arms.


Achaogen will likely need to perform a second trial to support Plazomicin's
approval.


Achaogen's pipeline is unlikely to have substantial value.


Plazomicin faces a number of commercial obstacles as a late entrant into a market
dominated by generics.


Achaogen's fair value is $3-5 per share as, even if approved, Plazomicin will be an
undifferentiated drug that will struggle in the marketplace.


The Plazomicin "superiority" claim is likely the result of differences in treatment between
the study arms


Let's start by analyzing Achaogen's Phase 3 study of Plazomicin for the treatment of
complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI). Achaogen describes the study graphically in
its corporate presentation from January 2017 this way.

There are a few things about this study design worth highlighting. First, the duration of
IV therapy can vary. Second, and this is very important, oral therapy with levofloxacin
following IV therapy is optional.


U.S. and European regulators ask for different endpoints to support antibiotic approval.
U.S regulators ask for a composite endpoint, which consists of microbiologic eradication
and clinical cure (no symptoms) at day five and Test of Cure (TOC) which is defined as
17 +/- 2 days. To be considered a responder, a patient must satisfy both criteria.
European regulators ask for microbiologic eradication in the modified intent to treat
population (MITT) and the microbiologically evaluable population (ME). This data is
taken from the press release and summarized below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4055422-achaogen-overvalued-antibiotics-company-85-percent-downside 4/15


The first thing to notice is that after five days, the Plazomicin arm is numerically
underperforming the comparator (Meropenem) arm 88% vs. 91.4%. At five days, we can
state with certainty that: many patients are still receiving IV antibiotics, the longest
period of time a patient might have been off parenteral antibiotics is one day, and
compliance with therapy is near 100% because the patient is either hospitalized or
receiving outpatient IV therapy. We believe that this data clearly leads to the conclusion
that is absolutely no advantage to giving Plazomicin during the first five days.


Something strange happens when Achaogen measures the primary endpoint at TOC
(17 +/- 2 days from study entry). At TOC, 81.7% of patients in the Plazomicin arm are
cured as compared to 70.1% of patients in the Meropenem arm. The Meropenem arm
experiences a precipitous decline in cure rates that is not typically observed in cUTI
clinical trials. Based on this difference in cure rates, Achaogen claims Plazomicin is
superior to Meropenem.


The dismal performance of Meropenem between day five and TOC in the Achaogen
EPIC trial is a departure from what was observed in similar antibiotic trials. The table
below shows the clinical cure rates in various clinical trials in patients with complicated
urinary tract infections. You'll note that the average difference in cure rates between the
end of IV antibiotic treatment and TOC is 4%. Can you spot the outlier? The Meropenem
arm of the EPIC trial performed well below what one might expect from other cUTI trials.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4055422-achaogen-overvalued-antibiotics-company-85-percent-downside 5/15


Moreover, a similar deterioration was not observed in the Plazomicin arm despite the
fact that both arms should have received the same treatment between the end of
parenteral therapy and TOC. When two treatment allocations in a trial do not behave
similarly, one has to question whether the arms were in fact treated similarly. Since both
arms should have performed similarly if treated similarly, we believe logic allows only
three interpretations: they were different to begin with (e.g., baseline imbalances
favoring the Plazomicin arm - this is not necessarily good for Achaogen), the result was
observed by chance (unlikely given the p-value), finally and most likely, the arms were
treated differently.


We cannot attribute this behavior to differences in the half-life of the drugs because both
have half-lives that are quite short (three hours for Plazomicin and one hour for
Meropenem). Because of this, there should be no persistent effect after discontinuing
parenteral therapy. This leads us to ask whether the difference in cure rates at TOC
might be due to differences in oral antibiotic treatment between the two arms. Since oral
antibiotic treatment following parenteral antibiotic administration was optional in this
study, it seems likely to us that the difference in cure rate at TOC is secondary to a
difference in oral antibiotic administration favoring the Plazomicin arm. Oral treatment
with levofloxacin alone has produced clinical cure rates of 86%, which makes you
wonder how it is that IV Meropenem followed by oral levofloxacin only produced a 70%
cure rate; one possible conclusion is that the patients didn't receive oral levofloxacin to
the same degree. Interestingly, had the Meropenem arm simply performed in line with
historic cure rates observed with oral levofloxacin treatment, the Plazomicin arm would
have been numerically inferior at both day five and day 17.

To our knowledge, Achaogen has never provided data regarding the frequency and
intensity of oral antibiotic therapy in the EPIC trial (the company has suggested a data
presentation at a forthcoming medical meeting). The company obviously has this data
which leads us to wonder why it has not been disclosed. This is the most obvious
question one might ask regarding the results of the EPIC trial, which probably explains
why it was so assiduously avoided by sell side analysts on the company's conference
call. Unless and until this data is provided, one is forced to draw conclusions from the
results presented. The conclusion we draw is that there is a substantial risk that the
difference between day five and TOC is simply the direct result of differences in oral
antibiotic administration.


Achaogen will likely need to perform a second trial to support Plazomicin's approval.


Achaogen states the following in its 10-Q:


The Company's Phase 3 study of plazomicin in the treatment of patients with
complicated urinary tract infections ("cUTI") and acute pyelonephritis ("AP"), entitled
EPIC (Evaluating Plazomicin In cUTI), is expected to serve as a single pivotal study
supporting a new drug application ("NDA") for plazomicin in the United States. In
addition, the Company's Phase 3 study of plazomicin, entitled CARE (Combating
Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae), which is a resistant pathogen-specific trial
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with certain
infections due to CRE, is intended to provide important and meaningful supportive
data to be submitted with the plazomicin NDA.


The highlighted emphasis is ours. Who exactly expects a single Phase 3 study to serve
as the basis for approval? It seems to us that Achaogen does. We haven't been
provided FDA correspondence by Achaogen in support of this point, so the best we can
do is look at the trials conducted by other companies developing antibiotics.


It is our contention that the FDA requires two successful Phase 3 trials for an antibiotic
to be approved. These trials needn't be conducted in the same patient population. Our
observations of other companies support this case.

Merck (MRK) conducted two Phase 3 trials for Zerbaxa, one in cIAI and the other in
cUTI. Both studies met their primary endpoint. Allergan (AGN) conducted three Phase 3
studies for Avycaz, one in cIAI and two in cUTI. All three studies met their primary
endpoint. Tetraphase (TTPH) conducted a Phase 3 study of Evaracycline in cIAI which
met its primary endpoint and a Phase 3 study in cUTI which failed. After consultation
with the FDA, Tetraphase elected to conduct an additional Phase 3 study. Paratek
(PRTK) is developing Omadacycline and conducted a successful Phase 3 study in acute
bacterial skin and skin structure infections. It is also conducting a Phase 3 study in
community acquired bronchial pneumonia (CABP). Nabriva (NBRV) is developing
Lefamulin and is conducting two Phase 3 studies in CABP to support its approval.
Perhaps most relevant to Achaogen is The Medicines Company (MDCO) which is
developing Carbavance. A single Phase 3 study in cUTI was conducted and met its
primary endpoint. Medicines Company is also conducting a Phase 3 study in bacteremic
patients with suspected carbapenem resistance. These studies are summarized in the
table below.


The FDA guidance for the development of drugs for the treatment of cUTI contains the
following statement:

In general, we recommend a preapproval safety database of 700 patients or more. If
the same dose and duration of therapy for treatment of cUTI were used in clinical
trials for other infectious disease indications, the safety information from those clinical
trials can be part of the overall preapproval safety database. (Source) 


Achaogen fails to meet the preapproval safety database criteria as outlined in the FDA
guidance for developing drugs to treat cUTI. Summarized below are all of the
Plazomicin studies that we have found listed on clinicaltrials.gov and the number of
patients exposed to drug. Clearly, at only 572 patient exposures, Achaogen comes up
short of the FDA's recommendation.


The Plazomicin NDA will not come close to the standard that has been set by other
members of the class. Achaogen has a single Phase 3 study with questionable post IV
antibiotic treatment. Other approved drugs have two positive Phase 3 trials. Achaogen
has only 572 patient exposures when the FDA guidance clearly recommends a safety
database in excess of 700 patients (A minor point but the safety database should
include >700 patients at the proposed marketed dose). It is entirely possible and
perhaps likely Achaogen receives a refusal to file letter when it submits the Plazomicin
NDA.


The CARE study is uninterpretable.

Achaogen has also touted the results of CARE study of Plazomicin versus Colistin in
patients with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE). At its R&D day on March
1, Achaogen management suggested Plazomicin could receive a "Limited use type of
label" for carbapenem-resistant bloodstream infections (Begins at 1:03:00 of R&D day
webcast). CRE is supposed to be the real reason the market needs Plazomicin. The
CARE study had an initial enrollment goal of 480 patients. After three years of running
the study, AKAO was only able to enroll 39 patients. Given the difficulty enrolling CARE,
it doesn't seem to us that CRE is much of a public health hazard.


Data was presented for 20 patients in the Colistin arm and 17 in the Plazomicin arm.
The trial allowed Meropenem or Tigecycline in each arm, was open label, and allowed
multiple different types of infections (blood infections, pneumonia, ventilator acquired) to
be treated. The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality or significant disease
complication. The primary endpoint occurred in 50% of patients in the Colistin arm and
in 23.5% treated with Plazomicin: that's 10 patients in the Colistin arm and four in the
Plazomicin arm. The study failed to meet the primary endpoint. You wouldn't necessarily
appreciate that from a glance at the company's press release or corporate slides
because it doesn't state a p-value. Fear not, we've calculated the p-value ourselves and
it is 0.1 by c2.


We believe the company also works in another sleight of hand to make the CARE study
results look better than they are. Notice when Achaogen reports results from the EPIC
study, it reports a 95% confidence interval.


(Source: AKAO press release linked above)


Yet, when Achaogen reports the results from the CARE study, it supplies a 90%
confidence interval.

Maybe Achaogen thinks investors won't pick up on this. At a minimum, it is a red flag
and, in our view, it reflects the company's willingness to play games with the data. It also
makes us wonder what other things the company may have done that has not been
disclosed.


Given the open-label nature of the trial and potential imbalances in additional drugs
used or underlying infections, we believe these numbers are simply too small to be
meaningful in any case. It is difficult to see how a failed trial that fell woefully short of its
enrollment goal will serve as a supportive Phase 3 trial. We believe that it should not be
supportive of a label claim.


We believe it is more likely that a treatment for patients with CRE will come from the
TANGO-1 study conducted by The Medicines Company, which compared the efficacy of
Meropenem/Vaborbactam with Piperacillin/Tazobactam in cUTI. Like EPIC, the TANGO-
1 study allowed for a transition to oral levofloxacin after 15 doses of IV antibiotic. Cure
was assessed at day 10 (Cure was defined as cure or improvement and microbiologic
eradication). Cure rates were 98.4% for Meropenem/Vaborbactam and 94% for
Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Meropenem/Vaborbactam met the criteria for superiority to the
comparator regimen. Medicines Company is running a supportive trial called TANGO-2
which will examine the efficacy of Meropenem/Vaborbactam in patients with suspected
carbapenem-resistant infections. Unlike Achaogen, which discontinued enrollment after
only 40 patients, The Medicines Company is continuing to enroll a 150 patient trial. Data
from TANGO-2 should be available in the third quarter.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4055422-achaogen-overvalued-antibiotics-company-85-percent-downside 11/15


A key driver of investor enthusiasm around Achaogen has been the perception that
Plazomicin is likely to gain widespread use in CRE infections. We believe this is highly
unlikely. The company has only run a single trial in this indication, the trial failed to
achieve full enrollment or anything close to it, and the limited data produced by the trial
was not statistically significant.


Achaogen's pipeline is unlikely to have substantial value:


Also, at its R&D day, Achaogen spoke about its early stage pipeline. Slide below.


(Source: corporate presentation linked above)


The company calls C-scape an innovative b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitor. Approved b-
lactam/b-lactamase combinations have been on the market since 1980s. We believe
calling this approach innovative is a stretch, though we would argue not inconsistent
with presenting data with different, 95% vs. 90%, confidence intervals.


Plazomicin faces a number of commercial obstacles as a late entrant into a market
dominated by generic drugs. Plasma drug level monitoring makes it less appealing to
use than other antibiotics.

Even assuming Plazomicin is approved, the commercial obstacles it faces are daunting.
All aminoglycoside antibiotics are nephrotoxic. Plazomicin increased the number of
treatment emergent adverse events related to renal function and just missed doing so in
a statistically significant manner (p=0.069 by c2). We are skeptical that doctors will want
to give an aminoglycoside antibiotic to a patient with a renal infection when there are
non-nephrotoxic agents available.


Should Plazomicin secure approval, it will be the seventh aminoglycoside antibiotic to
reach the market. In some cases, it will require therapeutic drug monitoring because
aminoglycosides, as a class, have a narrow therapeutic index. From the point of view of
the treating physician, prescribing a drug that requires multiple blood draws to check
drug levels is an unnecessary burden. Other equally effective antibiotics are available
that do not place this additional burden on the physician, nursing, and laboratory staff
(Achaogen press released a collaboration for therapeutic drug monitoring of TDM, thus
confirming the need to implement it should Plazomicin get approved).


Achaogen may seek a label claim stating Plazomicin is superior to Meropenem based
on the clinical study data reported to date. We already discussed how this likely resulted
from differences in oral levofloxacin administration. Merck may have harbored similar
aspirations for Zerbaxa (ceftolozane and tazobactam) when its data demonstrated
statistical superiority to the active comparator arm. However, the FDA saw things
differently and reflected that in the label.


We are skeptical that the FDA will treat Achaogen any differently.

Merck's Zerbaxa and Allergan's Avycaz are both indicated for the treatment of cUTI as
well as complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). Sales of both are modest despite
the fact that they are approved in multiple indications and marketed by experienced
pharmaceutical companies with large sales forces. According to IMS, trailing 12-month
sales for Zerbaxa are $22MM. This is consistent with Merck's financial reports, which did
not break out individual annual sales below $30MM per year in 2016. Allergan does
break out Avycaz sales; however, there was supply interruption that reduced Q3 2016
sales of the drug. Fourth quarter 2016 sales were $9.2MM which is $36.8MM on an
annualized basis.


Stated differently, two of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world had
combined sales of less than $60MM per year of their newly launched antibiotics. Worse,
both drugs are also approved for cIAI, so the $60MM overestimates sales specifically for
the cUTI indication. What reason is there to think Achaogen, with no sales force and no
sales experience will be able to successfully launch a drug in this indication? We believe
that there is almost no chance it will be able to sell Plazomicin profitably even if it takes
100% of the 2016 Merck and Allergan share of the market.


Finally, if an in-patient is responding to a parenteral antibiotic, we believe common
practice is to continue to use the same antibiotic until the course of therapy is complete.
This forms the basis of the so-called IV to oral switch. Levofloxacin is available in both
IV and oral forms, is generic, and is indicated for the treatment of complicated and
uncomplicated urinary tract infections.


Our fair value for Achaogen's shares is $3-5 per share as it will likely struggle to
differentiate Plazomicin in the marketplace.


We estimate after the December 14, 2016, financing and the approximate fourth quarter
cash expenditures, that Achaogen's balance sheet is:

While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


If we assume that Plazomicin is approved and generously estimate that Achaogen sells
$20MM at its peak, we do not believe Achaogen will be profitable. As a result, instead of
applying a multiple on earnings, we are valuing Plazomicin on a multiple of sales basis
using a liberal 6X multiple to arrive at a value of $120MM or $2.93 for Plazomicin. We
believe the only other value to Achaogen is the cash on its balance sheet as the value of
Achaogen's pipeline, excluding Plazomicin, is limited. However, we estimate that
Achaogen will need to spend approximately $50MM in the coming year in pursuit of
Plazomicin's approval, leaving it with approximately $2.05 per share in cash at year end.
Thus, the total value of Achaogen is approximately $5 per share value - $3 if you are
more conservative and believe that Achaogen will burn all of the cash on its balance
sheet in developing Plazomicin.
