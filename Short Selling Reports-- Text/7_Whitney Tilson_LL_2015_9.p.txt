Why The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Conference Call
Portends A Double Whammy For Lumber Liquidators
Mar. 26, 2015 9:09 AM ET100 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


The Consumer Product Safety Commission, coordinating with five other federal
agencies, is investigating Lumber Liquidators.


CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye appears to be thoughtful, fair-minded, determined to get
to the truth, and very strong willed.


The fact that the CPSC testing won’t use “deconstruction” doesn’t support the
company’s claim that the testing methodology used by 60 Minutes, myself, and
others is invalid.


Rather, the CPSC’s use of “exposure scenario” tests means that Lumber Liquidators
faces liability from two different types of tests – a double whammy.


In a conference call yesterday morning, Elliot S. Kaye, Chairman of the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), made a statement about his agency's investigation
of Lumber Liquidators and then took questions from reporters (the statement and audio of
the 22-minute call are posted here).


I couldn't be more pleased with the call, both in what Chairman Kaye said as well as his
general attitude and demeanor. He appeared to me to be thoughtful, fair-minded,
determined to get to the truth, and very strong willed - importantly, he didn't strike me as
someone who Lumber Liquidators and its representatives will be able to bully. I was also
impressed with how quickly the CPSC is moving: in less than a month, it not only appears
to be fully engaged, but is also coordinating with many other federal agencies, including:


The Environmental Protection Agency;
The Federal Trade Commission;
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry; and
The National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, which coordinates and runs
the National Toxicology Program (part of the National Institutes of Health).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3029526-why-the-u-s-consumer-product-safety-commission-conference-call-portends-a-double-whammy-for-lumber-liquidators


That's an impressive line-up! Collectively, I think these agencies are likely to definitively
show what I'm quite certain is true: that Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate
flooring has high levels of formaldehyde and thus poses a serious health risk to
consumers.


So why was the stock up more than 10% yesterday? In part, perhaps, relief that the CPSC
didn't immediately force Lumber Liquidators to stop selling its toxic laminate (which was
never in the cards - the CPSC needs to do its work before taking action), but mostly, I
think, because Chairman Kaye said the CPSC's testing would not use deconstruction,
which appears (at least to those blindingly accepting what the company is saying rather
than doing solid, independent analysis) to confirm the company's claim that the testing
methodology used by 60 Minutes, myself and others is "invalid." Nothing could be further
from the truth.


The misunderstanding is due to Lumber Liquidators sowing confusion (no doubt
deliberately) between measuring formaldehyde levels that Lumber Liquidators' customers
are actually exposed to, which is what the CPSC cares about, vs. the standards set by the
California Air Resources Board (CARB).


CARB Tests: Single Whammy


Regarding the latter, CARB does not require testing finished products - only the medium-
density fiberboard core prior to being processed into laminate - but if one tests finished
product, CARB is very clear that it must first be deconstructed (for more on this, see three
of my prior articles: Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB,
Lumber Liquidators' Campaign Of Distraction And Deception, and Explaining Lumber
Liquidators' Reckless Strategy And Rebutting Its Claims About Deconstructive Testing).
Thus, 60 Minutes, I and others did the testing correctly and consequently I have no doubt
that when CARB does its own tests (with deconstruction) of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-
made laminate, it will see similar results: formaldehyde levels averaging 6-7 times the limit
it set. This will of course be very bad news for Lumber Liquidators.


CPSC Exposure Scenario Tests: Double Whammy


I believe there will be equally bad news for the company - a double whammy - when the
CPSC completes its very different tests, called “exposure scenarios,” that seek to measure
how much formaldehyde the buyers of Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate are
actually being exposed to. This kind of test doesn’t involve deconstructing the laminate, so
the fact that Chairman Kaye confirmed this fact on the call isn’t a bullish sign for Lumber
Liquidators (contrary to what some investors and analysts concluded yesterday).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3029526-why-the-u-s-consumer-product-safety-commission-conference-call-portends-a-double-whammy-for-lumber-liquidators


Ironically, while the company calls for "real-world" tests, in fact it hasn't done any exposure
scenarios at all! Instead, it's just done tests of its finished laminate - but contrary to explicit
CARB guidance, without deconstruction - yet nevertheless has taken these bogus results
and proclaimed that its laminate is CARB 2-compliant. What mendacity and chutzpah!


Even more ironically, 60 Minutes, which Lumber Liquidators' founder and Chairman, Tom
Sullivan, accused of "making up this story," actually did the exposure scenario tests that
the CPSC will be doing - and the results were damning for the company, as all three tests
showed levels of formaldehyde orders of magnitude higher than the acceptable exposure
levels that have been established to protect Americans, especially children. For more on
this, here’s an extended excerpt from my article, A Response to Lumber Liquidators:



https://seekingalpha.com/article/2996156-a-response-to-lumber-liquidators

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3029526-why-the-u-s-consumer-product-safety-commission-conference-call-portends-a-double-whammy-for-lumber-liquidators


Lumber Liquidators' second line of defense (implied by the company and made
explicit by its defenders) is that, even if its laminate has levels of formaldehyde
above the CARB limit, where's the harm?


For starters, read what the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have to say about formaldehyde: it can cause "watery eyes;
burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat; coughing; wheezing; nausea; and
skin irritation," "upper respiratory tract irritation [that] can potentially exacerbate
asthma symptoms and other respiratory illnesses," "chronic runny nose, chronic
bronchitis, and obstructive lung disease," and is a "known human carcinogen"
associated with "several cancers, including nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia."


But at low levels, serious symptoms are unlikely - so the real question is, what is the
actual, real-world level of formaldehyde Lumber Liquidators is exposing its
customers to via its laminate and what harm might result from this?


The company, not surprisingly, says the level is very low, as shown in slide 16 of its
presentation:


Lumber Liquidators claims that "The emissions from our laminate floors will typically
only add approximately 5 ppb to a home when first installed." If true, this would be
good news since regulators have set 7 ppb as the limit to protect everyone, including

children.


But the company's claim flies in the face of the evidence. 60 Minutes (which, again,
posted all of its test results here) hired a lab to test three samples of Lumber
Liquidators' laminate, using the California Department of Public Health home model,
which tests how much formaldehyde a typical homeowner would actually be
exposed to. In sharp contrast to the company's claims, these tests showed the
following levels:


Sample 1: ~268 ppb/.268 ppm OR 329.3 μg/m3
Sample 2: ~93 ppb/.093 ppm OR 113.6 μg/m3
Sample 3: ~57 ppb/.057ppm OR 69.96 μg/m3

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3029526-why-the-u-s-consumer-product-safety-commission-conference-call-portends-a-double-whammy-for-lumber-liquidators


In other words, the actual levels of formaldehyde were 11-54 times the levels
claimed by Lumber Liquidators. Whose tests are you going to believe?


When 60 Minutes showed these results to Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the world's
leading experts on this subject (see his bio here and here), he said (according to the
transcript):


Dr. Philip Landrigan: It's not a safe level, it's a level that the US EPA calls
polluted indoor conditions.


Anderson Cooper: Would you want that in your home?


Dr. Philip Landrigan: No.


Dr. Philip Landrigan of N.Y.'s Mt. Sinai Hospital, specializes in environmental
pediatrics and exposure to toxic chemicals. He's talking about the results of
another kind of test Drury and Larson conducted measuring the concentration
of formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical
home.


Dr. Philip Landrigan: I would say long-term exposure at that level would be
risky because it would increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change
in a person's lung function, increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce
symptoms in everyone but children will be the people most likely to show
symptoms at that sort of level.


In light of these frightening risks, especially to children, it's little wonder why Lumber
Liquidators is trying to understate its customers' actual exposure to formaldehyde.


Conclusion


The fact that a half dozen federal agencies are working together to aggressively
investigate Lumber Liquidators is grim news for the company, as is the fact that we now
know, after yesterday's call, that the company faces liability from two different types of
tests: CARB's deconstructive test as well as the CPSC's exposure scenario test - both of
which Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate flooring has already failed in
spectacular fashion. When the regulators confirm this, I believe the company will face
severe sanctions, penalties and contingent liabilities that will crush the stock, which is why
it remains my largest short position by far.

Janney's take is 180 degrees opposite of yours. Their channel checks indicate a return to normality and a marked

Since no one has posted, and just to counter-balance the author's continuous attacks:

Janney Capital analyst David Strasser noted: “The real new news from this Presser is that Chairman Kaye of
CPSC said that they will not use deconstructive testing to do the investigation against LL that they announced
today - as it is likely not the right method to analyze the safety of the product. ... This must make LL happy, as
they have used this finished good methodology and have shared results on their web site which shows safe
levels of formaldehyde in their Chinese Laminate.”

What only matters is the air quality in the room prior to a deconstruction of the product. This relentless attack
even if accurate is not how one should conduct their business.

Not true cashew.


The environmental test is for safety purposes and can be performed 3 ways. A kit used by the homeowner
and sent to the lab for evaluation(the choice selected by LL), a company can come to your home and use a
monitor to evaluate for mold, formaldehyde, radon etc.(the standard for home inspections related to real
estate sales) and the test the CPSC will uses is a chamber test where a new box of flooring will be placed in a
chamber and tested.


In contrast the deconstruction test evaluates manufacturing standards so it is sometimes referred to as an
enforcement test. Before a laminate floor is qualified to be stamped CARB, a core is randomly selected and
tested before the floor is constructed. IF what the China plant manager said (that was secretly recorded by 60
minutes) is true; none of the cores could pass that standard. The reason the CPSC is coordinating with other
government agencies is the CPSC only assure a product is safe to the current standards.


In 2010 congress adopted CARB but that does not go into effect until later this year. (Congress passed a law
in which the regulators would write the rules and that explains the delay in enforcement of the law.) However,
if a product says it is CARB and it is not, the product is arguably mislabel and that would be investigated by
other agencies. The CPSC investigates safety and other investigations may focus on the fraud allegation.
Obviously the later takes longer so the CPSC is just the first hurdle. I am sure the government agencies do
not want 60 Minutes to do a report on them failing to do their job so they will perform their work knowing they
are under scrutiny. A government agency failing to protect the public against fraud was exactly the report 60
Minutes aired immediately before the LL segment on March 1st.

First of all, the deconstructive test will always result in higher levels of Formald. than the non-deconst. test, especially
when you can select the most highly treated segments of the floorings inards.....I seriously doubt the non
deconstructive test will fail.


Second, you say: "60 Minutes ...hired a lab to test three samples of Lumber Liquidators' laminate, using the California
Department of Public Health home model, which tests how much formaldehyde a typical homeowner would actually
be exposed to."


A typical homeowner will not be exposed to shards of deconstructed flooring. Rather, they are exposed to the flooring
in its finished, fully intact, solid state. 
Specifically disturbing to me about the deconstructive testing, is I doubt a sample of deconstructed flooring is
randomly chosen. I believe if a tester wants to skew the results, they could select a shard of the flooring they feel
could be more or less highly exposed/treated with formaldahyde to please their intentions and agendas. 
LL did its own testing and the flooring they selected passed : http://bit.ly/1Nj4XKe


26 Mar 2015, 10:18 AM


PRickels
In spite of what the author states, he would be much happier if CSPC would do the deconstructive test. And if
he was honest he would admit deconstructing releases higher levels of formaldehyde than would be normally
experienced in a home.


If the deconstruction test was used for any purpose other than screening for further investigation then most of
the furniture on the market today would not meet CARB standards.

You sir, aren't very smart. It took me just 1 minute to fully read what 60 minutes put out. 60 minutes did
perform 2 tests. The second test is CDPH 01350 test, which is the closest to testing the finished product in a
home environment and even that test failed! LL is lying. See the copy-paste I took from 60 minutes website.


----------------------... 
The second test the labs did was the CDPH (California Department of Public Health test) 01350 test, which
measures the concentration of formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical
home. The highest-emitting Lumber Liquidators sample that the labs tested emitted a concentration of
formaldehyde into the air of a typical home that the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has cited as
"polluted indoor conditions." 
----------------------...


Wish I had shorted at $90 or even $50. This stock is between 20-40 depending on the severity of the recall,
fines, etc.

Charmp... you sir are an absolute genious! You read the 60 minutes results in 1 minute and drew up your
investment conclusion? Wow I wish I was as smart as you.


Instead of your 1 minute, I reviewed the testing method of 60 minutes for the 01350 test, and you could say I
am not confident they used the required methodology according to California specifications , posted here:
http://bit.ly/1FSFiJe , which I also reviewed for quite some time.


I feel this cause they obviously wanted the flooring to fail, so you might say they had an agenda.

store visit - mgr says store traffic fell sharply week after 60 mins, but recovered since, is at normal levels. says his
store will hit their monthly planned rev this month. also says they r offering tests of any previously installed chinese
laminate, homeowner needs to send in a plank. all those tests came back fine.


bottom line on the stock - if gov tests come back ok, this stock could easily double, even without regard to impact of
short squeeze. if tests come back bad, there will be some product liability. but chinese laminates are only 10% of
sales.


this is not nearly as bad as the situation at GM, which knowingly suppressed info of a FATAL product flaw, or the
tobacco companies, which needs no further explanation. All are investible.


26 Mar 2015, 10:55 AM

If Chinese laminates are only 10% of sales then even the worst case scenario of withdrawing the product
would not destroy LL. What would you pay for a well run business that had 90% of the sales?

The fear is the liability of course. I am *not* saying I expect much if any liability, but the chance exists
regardless.

This is an interesting tug of war between long and shorts. One thing I would like to understand better, is what about
Home Depot and Lowes? Where are the test results for their floors compared to LL? Another poster said that he
called the labs which did the testing for 60 minutes, and they claimed they did not test the others, only LL. Can
someone point me to the comparative results which show LL is doing this and the others are not?


26 Mar 2015, 10:57 AM


Matt Brice, Contributor
You will not be able to find the data--the tests were supposedly done by GCM, but no results were released,
and no data was released on whether GCM tested chinese laminates or what they actually tested. Feel free
to call 60 minutes, GCM or Tilson. Tilson did not tests HD or Lowe's products.


26 Mar 2015, 11:21 AM


Clayton Rulli, Contributor
Of course he didn't test HD or LOW. Even though these companies probably sell much more laminate flooring
versus LL, flooring is still a small % of total sales and profits, so shorting HD and LOW wouldn't be as
profitable as shorting and targeting LL specifically


26 Mar 2015, 02:28 PM

the anecdotal evidence i have seen is that none of the low or HD products showed problems.

If there was any concern to public safety/health all federal agencies involved would put an immediate halt to the
importation, distribution, & selling of these products. Immediate notices to consumers would be published, too. There
are testing measures that immediately allow them to determine the risk so that can respond/act quickly. This has not
happened!

Great Article in terms of clarifying the testing methods and why a certain testing method was used.

1. As it was told in call CPSC will not use deconstruction method. 
2. Probably there are not much people aware of this story. Only those that trade this stock and heard about it on "60
Minutes" 
3. Even those that are aware will quickly forget this story. 
4. In my opinion it will not be a big impact on revenues. 
5. "risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a person's lung function, increased risk of asthma" - are there any
definite numbers apart from " risk" probably risk can be as move from 0,0001% to 0,001% and from 0,0001% to 1%
Both very different numbers but both have a "risk".

I'm sure Tilson will keep up the attacks via the media. Michelle Celarier of the NY Post periodically writes
articles about Tilson's and Ackman's shorts, and I expect Anderson Cooper can be convinced to do
something on his CNN or syndicated shows.

simplevalue274
"I believe the company will face severe sanctions, penalties and contingent liabilities that will crush the stock, which is
why it remains my largest short position by far."


These are Tilson's own words. It's a purely hyperbolic statement. In no way tries to quantify what these penalties may
be under his scenario, just says the stock will get "crushed". What is crushed? 10%, 20%, 100%?


Again I could care less what the stock does in the short term. I want to assess what the business will look like three to
five years from now. I don't think it will be "crushed" in three to five years.


If Tylenol can recall all their aspirin, gm can do a massive recall and Exxon can survive the Valdez spill then I think LL
should be able to survive this and thrive.

My sincere apology for reposting this, but my previous direct message to Mr. Tilson and post aimed to discuss
Mr. Tilson comment exactly, but was ignored:


While I respect Mr. Tilson's wish to spend his time on something else, there is the risk that his call for
questions to be directed at his inbox, as opposed to posting as public discussion may be perceived as a tactic
to distract those who disagree with him.


I inquired Mr. Tilson earlier (3/24), about his connection to the ongoing GCM/Sunshine Park LLC suit against
LL. I've given Mr. Tilson the courtesy of waiting a reasonable time for him to respond, which he never did. So
here's my question:


Dear Mr. Tilson,


I appreciate your effort of answering the questions that many of us have had.

Would you consider provide further transparency and give us some information about your connection to
GCM, and its joint plaintiff Sunshine Park LLC? Lumber Liquidators had claimed that GCM and Sunshine
Park LLC are motivated by short sellers, but Sunshine Park LLC had remained silent through the trial. Do you
know anything about who is behind this entity?


Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your answer. Sincerely,  
Eric

But will this be another case of the cure being worse than the disease?


The gasoline sold outside of California in the rest of the planet Earth is dangerous according to California regulations.
Where is 60 Minutes on this, since they care so much about California flooring regulations?


Or is this really all about cheap goods from China taking American jobs? If the flooring was made by a US company
owned by Warren Buffet and Al Gore, would nobody care?

Tilson, I'm all for an open discussion and I just looked through CBS test results and it clearly states how they test the
Air quality: "Sample Tracking and Conditioning Procedure 
Sample boxes were opened on the conditioning date stated on their respective test report. On the conditioning date,
the foam pad adhered to the flooring sample was scraped/peeled off, and the date of manufacture was recorded from
the label on box. The laminate backing was then removed using a DeWalt DW735X Thickness Planer. An average
thickness of 0.01 - 0.03 inches was planed off of each flooring plank in order to completely remove the laminate
backing and expose the fiberboard core. The specimens were then cut to size and labeled with an HPVA
Laboratories-assigned sample ID#. Samples were tested face-to-face, with only the fiberboard core exposed in the
chamber." This gave the results between 0.24 to 1.45 ppm. This is not real world testing. I'm sure you're not
intentionally manipulating the price of LL but false statements can get you a hefty fine or even criminal charges:

I just emailed Whitney with a question, I thought I'd share with everyone and we will see if he answers.... I'm not
holding my breath:


Whitney I was hoping you can comment on LL's quote on CARB, located on the third line on Page 4:
 http://bit.ly/1ArN0Ty


"CARB has indicated to us that no one in the industry is required to conduct deconstructive testing for compliance
purposes "  


Why is CARB apparently telling LL one thing and you another? 


26 Mar 2015, 05:44 PM


Talascan
Not only is that the RIGHT question to ask, and not only does the CPSC decision to reject the deconstruction
method destroy the short thesis, we also have the complete disingenuous spin placed on this decision by this
misleading article.


The CPSC's decision was probably the single most devastating bit of news the short camp could have ever
conceived of hearing. This is NOT what they wanted to hear regardless what they might say out of the side of
their mouth.


Lastly, didnt Tilson in a recent interview say that he was "done" with writing about , talking and discussing LL?
Didnt he say that its time to "move on" and talk about othyer things ?


Yet every time the stock pops a point or two , out he comes with a "evil" or "whammy" headline intended to
confuse and scare people out for his benefit.


The bottom line is that the CPSC's decision is exactly what LL needed to get. They got it. Tilson can say its a
positive for him but smart money knows that he is dead wrong and likely hedging himself daily.

California formulated gas is also sold in most of the neighboring states to California. The summer blend of gasoline
mandated by the U.S. EPA in 17 states is formulated to evaporate less which reduces smog. California formulation
reduces evaporation even more and adds about 10 cents to a gallon. California also has CARB compliant lawn

If LL are claiming their testing methodology doesn't show a problem and if CPSC will be using it, I wonder why Mr.

Are you trying to suggest that if the CPSC finds no problem with their methodology, LL will still be liable because your
deconstruction tests show a problem? And who is going to decide that?

This is a complete fabrication by Gasparino. I am no Tilson fan, but LL is not going to sue 60 minutes or
Tilson. And it has nothing to do with discovery (they are already suing GCM for libel/slander in CA). It merely
has to do with the fact that you don't give an insane man more reasons to talk, you just hope he quietly goes
away....


26 Mar 2015, 10:26 PM


balert2
If you watch the video on the Fox Business web site; Gasparino said his source was investors who talked to
the company. First, company officials can not provide nonpublic information to investors. Second, once 60
minutes is sued, LL will be court ordered to reveal all their records and subject to sworn testimony in
depositions that can subsequently be used by 60 Minutes in a follow up report. Have you ever heard of
Pandora's box?

I think the market will evolve like it always does. Companies will begin to develop pre set defense plans for negative
pr attacks. With the internet anybody can become a huge mouthpiece for negative stream of relentless attacks and
endanger a company. I think you will see whole strategies develop specifically to defend against people like tilson and

I do feel tilson has spent all his reputation all capital on this one though.

Sir,


You spend the first 1/4 of your article patronizing the CPSC chair with flowery disingenuous sounding rhetoric, then
later you delve and rehash your same arguments as before, while trying to spin what was the single most devastating
bit of news for you to ever hear into a positive that subjects LL to a "double whammy" of exposure//


You hated that decision and we all know it. Instead of admitting it you instead mislead us by misrepresenting that 60
minutes did "two types of tests" Deconsctructive and the "same test that the CPSC" is now going to do.


Unfortunately that is completely false, nowhere does 60 minutes claim they did such a thing and that's primarily
because they have NO idea exactly what kind of testing the CPSC will do, the CPSC Chair was clear that they are
going to still devise the testing that is most appropriate for this situation.


The one thing that is completely clear is that you received a huge setback when the CPSC rejected the
"deconstructive testing" that CARB uses and adopted the testing methodology that LL has indicated as being a "real
world" test that is a more realistic measure of how the floors are used in a home.


Furthermore, I assure you that since California is the ONLY state in the country that even has emission standards of
any kind on wood flooring. (Apparently other States simply don't care or believe its a real concern ), should the CPSC
tests come back with the floors turning out to be safe (explaining why we haven't heard reports of "positive test
results" popping up all over the place), ANY decision like that would immediately TRUMP any deconstructive results.


Do you really think that if the "Consumer Product Safety Commission" comes out and says we have conducted
months of testing and found that for the most part these floors are safe , anyone will ever care about the results that
you and or 60 minutes purport to have gotten through a methodology rejected by the same Commission ??

I know that you say you gave the story to 60 minutes back in October 2014 and didn't trade it after you did that (which
is actually kinda weird, nothing illegal about trading a stock that is being looked at by the media, regulators or anyone
else for that matter - You owe 60 minutes no duty of confidentiality)


In any event, can you explain why the short interest then doubled from October to just before the show aired? Did you
happen tell your buddies and cronies that 60 min was investigating? I bet you let it slip more than few times over a
cocktail or a quiche luncheon


Oh and didn't you promise 2 stories ago that you weren't going to write anymore about LL, or discuss your position,
and that you were just "moving on"?


Didn't you say you were tired of being asked about it and 60 minutes?


So why is it that every time the stock goes up a point or two you throw out a childish "evil" or a totally disingenuous
"we love that the CPSC rejects our testing methodology "article that makes you look even worse ?


You need to stop screaming at the TV sir.


27 Mar 2015, 09:45 AM


EnerSavr, Contributor
I think SEC should launch an investigation and any money that Tilson and anyone else they can prove was involved
in shorting the stock before the 60 minutes piece aired with a minimum of year in jail so people like this do not use
unjustified means to manipulate a stock.


Mr. Tilson, if you were so concerned you could have taken your case to CPSC and asked them first if what you are
doing is something they approve of, but we all know consumer safety was not your intention from the beginning. It is
just a matter of time before all the truth will be public information and everyone else will know what a fraud you really
are.

You need to be a man and take the coming squeeze like a man.


You need to admit that the CPSC's decision to reject the deconstructive and unrealistic test Ca uses to enforce CARB
compliance was the worst decision imaginable for you.


You said NOTHING new in your article and lost all credibility when you tried to turn the single biggest setback you
have gotten so far as a positive for you.


You need to admit when the CPSC results are in and they show the floors under real world use are generally safe,
NOBODY will even think about Ca Carb testing again.


You need to admit that the last thing you want to hear is that the Consumer Protection Safety Commission thinks LL
floors are safe and now CPSC certified

All you doubters are full of hot air! What you are missing is that LL is not only the retailer of the floor they sell, but also
the manufacturer. Of course they don't actually manufacturer the material but they put their name on it. Home Depot
and Lowe's and other Big Boxes sell products that don't have their name on it. Not exclusively but they sell them.
They can go back to someone and blame them for faulty product. LL cannot do that. If you don't believe me go to their
website and pull up product warranties and installation instructions. So they have double jeopardy. They have a lot to
loose.  
Someone mentioned on another discussion, "We don't hear any installers complaining" but why would they now? Do
you think they want to be sued as well. Lawyers are notorious for taking down anyone they can. Most of the people
installing these floors are small Mom and Pop companies. They don't have the means to defend themselves over
something this big. Do you naively think they aren't worried about the ill effects of this product? They are actually
deconstructing this material every time it is installed. What about the homeowner who is on site while installation
takes place? They are breathing it in. What about the do it your-selver? They don't matter?  
This is a big deal! It isn't somebody trying to make money but do something right. Other big box stores probably have
problems too. But wouldn't it be better to make it right and not have this holy than thou attitude that I am right...even
though I know I am wrong. Technicallities? So what, as long as I make money and my shareholders make money so
what! 
That is the issue. Stop selling it until it is tested. Do the right thing! Does that ever trump money anymore? If it is
wrong, fix it. Make a big deal out of it! 
If it isn't wrong say so and tell customers you want to do the right thing. That would be your ace in the hole. 
Do you know what happens when a homeowner has problems with their product. LL automatically says it is an
installation problem. Look up the reviews. They take zero liability once it leaves the store. Why? Because they cannot
blame anyone but themselves. Research how the product is handled at the store. Have you ever driven by the store
and have seen wood product sitting outside. Being exposed to all the elements! Do you see any other Big Box stores
doing this? 
From manufacturing to distribution to handling of product to return policy to taking responsibility this is all anyone
wants. Can you tell my why that is a bad thing?

Has anyone noticed that this company has a 2:1 current ration and no long term debt. Typically not the kind of

get to bet on secular growth at a discounted price. Assuming they are cleared of these allegations, negative press

How do you longs overlook the point where 60 minutes also tested the finished products (without the sanding and
decomposition) and STILL found high level of fomaldehyde. That was the whole point that Tilson made. CARB or
CDPH testings, both failed. Check out 60 minutes website and the published data. Everyone seems so focused on
CARB, when it's the latter test that everyone should be questioning Sullivan. The story boils down to either you
believe LL (since their tests showed entirely different results in the second version) or 60 minutes.


Reading some of the earlier customer feedbacks (from 2006 and 2008), and complaints with the BBB, it's quite clear
to me that LL has a fomaldehyde problem. How widespread is anybody's guess. This stock is not going to $90
anytime soon. It's somewhere between 40-20 depending on your gauge of the health issue at hand.


27 Mar 2015, 01:25 PM


Talascan
the CDPH test is NOT the test that the CPSC is going to do. No one knows exactly what kind of test they will do, so its
impossible for Tilson to say 60 minutes did the same test or to say this is the test that will be done.


Reading the transcript clearly implies that the CPSC is devising their own methodology. And I suspect that the labs
that LL used are a huge part of the investigation. LL can only rely on those labs and I cant see how they can be so
adamant that the floors are safe if they clearly know they are not


Where are all the positive test messages? Blogs? Complaints other than post 60 minutes nonsense behind lawsuits?


I see no hard data anywhere from consumers that have been posted with high levels of FH

CDPH test is the home use test. Read the description. It's the closest to what CPSC said.


Positive messages are to be expected and it's also easier to cheat by paying folks to write good reviews. I find there's
more to learn from reading the bad reviews. Even with purchases from Amazon. Sometimes those folks have axes to
grind, but more often, you find more honest feedback - feedback where people really have issues with.


Just ask yourself - if everything is per your expectation, would you write feedbacks? No, of course. Who has time for
that? Only when expectation is exceeded would you usually write back. Or when expectation is not met would you
write back. The level of details in the feedbacks and especially the date of posting (pre-2013 when Tilson initiated the
short) tells me that the negative comments were genuine. To see that the issue ran that far back and that
management did nothing is pretty telling.


The continuous denial is also shocking though I don't think the stock will go to 0. probably will be slapped with a fine
and a recall.

Dear Eric,


Thank you for your question. It’s an easy one: contrary to the company’s claim that “These attacks are driven by a
small group of short-selling investors who are working together…” (http://bit.ly/1MfUpQK), there is no such conspiracy
(at least to my knowledge). I have no idea who the hedge fund(s) are behind Sunshine Park LLC, nor have I met or

prominent environmental attorney, both of whom were featured in the 60 Minutes story.


I can only assume that the hedge fund(s) behind Sunshine Park figured out, as I did, that Lumber Liquidators was
poisoning its customers, but chose a different route than I did to be an activist (by hiring Larson and Drury).

Now that the government has decided to do testing consistent with the companies view on how it should be tested,
the game has changed. Failure of the test will almost certainly result in immediate chapter 11 for the company, as they
would be ordered to replace all flooring at their expense. I do not know how and manager with a fiduciary obligation
would be able to hold a position into and all or none scenario. they would be liable to for holding.


I replied:


Dear Igsman,


Thank you for your question. I disagree with your premise that “the government has decided to do testing consistent
with the companies view on how it should be tested.” As I explained in my latest article (Why the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission Conference Call Portends a Double Whammy for Lumber Liquidators,
http://seekingalpha.co...), there are two types of tests, one of which involves deconstruction and one of which doesn’t.
Numerous tests of LL’s Chinese-made laminate show that it will fail both tests in spectacular fashion.


I also disagree with your assertion that “Failure of the test will almost certainly result in immediate chapter 11 for the
company, as they would be ordered to replace all flooring at their expense.” I don’t think anything will be immediate –
if LL does go to zero, it will happen over a long time I’d guess because it’s not clear what regulators will require LL to
do to remedy the problem, nor that the correct solution for most (or even a small percentage) of homeowners is to rip
out the existing flooring. If the flooring was installed a year or two earlier, most of the formaldehyde has likely “off-
gassed” and thus don’t pose a danger. This doesn’t mean LL is off the hook, however, as these homeowners, if they
suffered coughing, bronchitis, etc., will still have a great claim for damages. It’s long-tailed legal liabilities like these
that would eventually bankrupt the company, not short-term regulatory action.


Lastly, I disagree with you here: “I do not know how and manager with a fiduciary obligation would be able to hold a
position into and all or none scenario. they would be liable to for holding.” Lots of investment managers, myself
included, invest in tainted businesses in the hopes that things turn out better than expected – and if they don’t, they
don’t (nor should they) face liability.

Author’s reply »  Clayton messaged me and asked:


Whitney I was hoping you can comment on LL's quote on CARB, located on the third line on Page 4:
app.quotemedia.com/dat...


"CARB has indicated to us that no one in the industry is required to conduct deconstructive testing for compliance
purposes "


Why is CARB apparently telling LL one thing and you another?


I replied:


Dear Clayton,


Thank you for your question. This is a typical statement from Lumber Liquidators: true but highly misleading and
disingenuous. CARB doesn't require testing of finished laminate at all (only the initial medium-density fiberboard,
before it’s made into laminate), but if testing of finished product is done, it specifies clearly that it must first be
deconstructed.


If you're interested in the details of exactly why Lumber Liquidators' claim that 60 Minutes (and others') testing is
"improper" is wrong - it's their testing that's questionable and/or improper - I suggest reading a few of my articles:


• Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing Doesn't Comply With CARB (http://seekingalpha.co...);  
• Lumber Liquidators' Campaign Of Distraction And Deception (http://seekingalpha.co...); 
• A Response To Lumber Liquidators (http://seekingalpha.co...); and

Author’s reply »  Christian messaged me and asked:


i compared your data that you took from the 60 Minutes home model tests and compared it to the actual tests from
the 60 Minutes website and couldn't make them tie. perhaps you might explain in a comment how your 3 sample
numbers, 268, 93, 57 ppb, can be footed to the pdfs of the tests that 60 Minutes posted. thanks in advance


I replied:


Dear Christian,


Thank you for your question. It’s a long answer, so bear with me.


First, download the tests 60 Minutes did, which they posted here: http://cbsn.ws/1ElmFwZ


You’re looking for two files:


1) In the folder named “CBS - HPVA Test Results”, open the pdf entitled “1350 Summary.CA 01350 VOC Test
Report_CBS News_1-5-2015”. On page 2 of the pdf, in the middle of the page, in red, under “Estimated VOC
Concentrations - Flooring (μg/m3)**”, you’ll see that the formaldehyde reading is 113.6. And on page 3, in the same
space, you’ll see that the formaldehyde reading is 329.3.


2) In the folder named “CBS - Benchmark Test Results” (this is the other lab 60 Minutes used), open the folder named
“Benchmark - CDPH”, and in there you’ll find an 8-page pdf named “CBS News CA 01350 Test Report 12WS.” On
page 7, about halfway down the page, you’ll see that the formaldehyde reading is 69.96.


OK, so now we have the results from the three California Dept of Public Health (CDPH) real-world tests – the kind that
the Consumer Product Safety Commission will be doing:


1) 329.3 micrograms per meter cubed 
2) 113.6 micrograms per meter cubed 
3) 69.96 micrograms per meter cubed


Now, we need to convert micrograms per meter cubed into parts per billion, which you do by dividing by 1.227 (or
1,227 for parts per million).


(This number comes from the volume of 1 mole of gas at 25C (24.47 L) and the molecular weight of formaldehyde
(30.03 grams/mole). See e.g. ASTM D6007 equation (6); see the middle of page 2 of this white paper: 
http://bit.ly/1ElmFx2.)


So:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3029526-why-the-u-s-consumer-product-safety-commission-conference-call-portends-a-double-whammy-for-lumber-liquidators


1) 329.3 micrograms per meter cubed = 268 ppb = .268 ppm 
2) 113.6 micrograms per meter cubed = 93 ppb = .093 ppm 
3) 69.96 micrograms per meter cubed = 57 ppb = .057 ppm


Even the lowest of these three numbers is massively higher than the limits regulators have set to protect everyone,
including children. Here are three formaldehyde limits set by two regulators:


1) The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (see: http://bit.ly/1ElmFx9) sets formaldehyde
limits of 55 micrograms per meter cubed for acute (short-term) exposure and 9 micrograms per meter cubed for 8-
hour and chronic exposure.


(9 micrograms per meter cubed = 7 ppb, which is the figure I used in my article, A Response To Lumber Liquidators
(http://seekingalpha.co...), when I wrote: “Lumber Liquidators claims that "The emissions from our laminate floors will
typically only add approximately 5 ppb to a home when first installed." If true, this would be good news since
regulators have set 7 ppb as the limit to protect everyone, including children.”)


2) The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, in another document (see page 5:
http://bit.ly/1ElmDVT), sets formaldehyde limits of 40 micrograms per meter cubed for “No Significant Risk Levels
(NSRLs) for Carcinogens.”


3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards (http://1.usa.gov/1ElmDVX) sets formaldehyde limits of 0.016 ppm (16 ppb) for an
8-10 hour period.

First of all, I do want to thank Mr. Tilson for answering my earlier question about his connection with
GCM/Sunshine Park LLC. This can be a useful reference for future agency action.


His response to Christian question, however, contains 2 major problem.


(1) The repeated reference (through his previous answers/articles) to the 60 Minutes test data is problematic:
it is true that LL/CPSC would have to explain why the numbers from 60Minutes "deconstruction tests" were so
high, though there do exist scientific hypothesis why that was the case. The fact that CPSC agreed with LL to
use *REAL WORLD* tests made 60Minutes data much less relevant, in the agency's decision (and hence, the
government's) on long term health impacts.


(2) Mr. Tilson is conflating the 60 Minutes' small chamber test (D6007) numbers and try to compare that with,
say NIOSH recommendation 16ppb, which referenced living/working space numbers. I'd assume it's a
innocent mistake, for Mr. Tilson likely did not have extensive education in experimental physical
sciences/engineering: emission numbers can vary wildly depends on ventilation conditions. 
D6007 specifies chamber air flow rate that is generally ~1/3 of a normal home, and "occupational"
environment that NIOSH generally refers to would usually have flow rate 10x+ that of the ~0.5 change/hr

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3029526-why-the-u-s-consumer-product-safety-commission-conference-call-portends-a-double-whammy-for-lumber-liquidators


(think fume hood).  
So there's some attempts at reality distortion here: the vast majority of usage with these laminates would lead
to 1/10th if not single digit percentage CH2O exposure.  
But through Mr. Tilson's elegant words and clever evidence filtering / presentations, he's made it seems the
exact opposite.


This is most obvious when he quoted, in his answer, a white paper by Alfred Hodgson of Berkeley Analytics,
to support Mr. Tilson's point, while Mr. Hodgson is in fact an expert witness for LL, certifying their products
meet CARB standards, in the GCM lawsuit.


Unfortunately, I have neither the energy nor the polished words to make his manipulations more obvious.


Finally, as a former academics, I am usually very skeptical when someone continuously quoting/reference
articles written by himself/herself. A rough estimate seems to indicate that 80% of references he made in his
responses pointed to his own (6!) articles in the past weeks, whilst never making any mentions of articles with
different opinions. Just my observations.


I should probably direct my energy on something else, on a beautiful weekend, but I don't want to make a
statement about it and then break it later.

Great points all around. So true about the self referencing. In my experience that is a huge red flag. Shows
weak corroborating evidence and weak argument in general. Also shows an inflated sense of self importance
which clouds judgment. 
With every passing article, post on other venues etc Tilson is looking more and more desperate. Great ideas
do not need relentless barrage of information. They are simple and elegant. 
This is a poor mans Ackman attack a la HLF, except Tilson doesn't have $80 mm to spend on a campaign
and hire lobbyist and he also isn't a billionaire. 
This to shall pass.

Mr. Tilson, 
I am not sure eve you quite understand the issues with Formaldehyde. Just as a comparison, one cigarette has over
6000ppb of formaldehyde. The levels that we are talking about do not even come close to a single cigarette. one
would have live in a 3000 sq home for 300 years to be subject to the formaldehyde level of a single cigarette. Why do
you keep insisting on putting ridiculous fears into people that are not familiar with formaldehyde. So, if one smokes a
pack of cigarette inside a home, by the end of the day there should not be anyone alive in that home.

I have included a link to Congress Act 1660: 
http://1.usa.gov/1MoGtys


The levels are described in the "Emissions" section and they are at about 60-90 ppb over a SIX month period for a
particle based wood. No one destroys a wood inside a chamber and reads it at its initial high level emission period.  
All, these senators, if they bothered to read their own law would know that this is nothing but a witch hunt.


Please stop this nonsense. Do you not think that you have taking this way too far at this point.

I have no position (and never have) in the stock so far (I don´t short) but could shareholders file a class action against
Tilson for distortion of the facts and resulting loss in value of shares?


29 Mar 2015, 10:16 PM


Dr. Z.
Zugzwang: unlikely, Tilson doesnt control the shareprice. Share price is determined by what prospective
investors are willing to pay for it and how much existing investors want to get for it. Either group is entirely
free in their decision making and Tilson isnt forcing them to do anything they dont want to do.


Also, you dont have a realized loss until you sell your shares at which point you basically admit that you dont
think the shares should be worth more because you willingly accepted a lower price.


Apart from that, Tilson's interpretation of facts, however silly and manipulative, is a matter of opinion and
Tilson is entitled to voice his opinion under the protection of the US First Amendment.

ZugsWANG, 
The possibility does exist but the cost of litigation makes it prohibitive. That being said, the SEC should pass
regulation that unjustified slander is subject to a jail sentence. Even though Tilson's word should not be worth much,
many investors put weight behind the so called "Analysts" words. We have a law that a prohibits doctors from
spreading unjustified panic and fear, by the same token people that spread panic in the investment world should be
treated the same way. This is not victimless. Many 401ks and individual investors have unjustifiably lost a lot of value
and there in no accountability. I do not see congress getting behind the investors, instead they spread the panic by
issuing unjustified calls for investigation without even reading their own laws.

From the link: 
Ed Bradley’s 17 minute “investigative report” aired on November 23, 1986. Between interviews of the teary-eyed
“victims” (drivers) of unintended acceleration swearing their feet were on the brake pedal, CBS showed a clip of a
driverless Audi lurching forward on its own.


Viewers didn’t get to see the canister of compressed air on the passenger-side floor with a hose running to a hole
drilled in the transmission. An “expert” had rigged the Rube Goldberg device to shift the big Audi into drive and, like
any automatic-equipped car, move forward (unless the brakes are depressed).

doing some serious research (along with my NYC Senator C.M and lower level SEC). I started with who owns Dow
Jones publications (based on an earlier statement one of my college professors said)... "the rich - I would now say
Uber rich, do not pay taxes" and the media is owned by "a few at the top". (I would now say fewer).


I won't go into that here but one is stunned by who actually owns the media (research Dow Jones Publications for a
start) - and 2 talking heads were given subpoena's for their part, and tossed them back at the camera, saying the

Government. (my last position in NYC was for a Wall street firm that sheltered the uber rich btw, those making 10 to
100 million in each account and all sheltered outside of America). (I did financial graphics and filled in for a secretary
one day and my jaw dropped).


The company is targeted, SEC (other agencies "investigate") legal worms come out of hiding and the stock pps drops
which each "media" event. (with the earlier one of the lawyers - was actually found out to be corrupt and many
companies had been targeted, over decades of this activity) All of this is archived somewhere but when the head of
the SEC responded I tossed two boxes of research and correspondence out. (since part of our group research and
efforts involved "naked short selling" Bloomberg and NY Post did articles on those issues - the NY Post actually knew
us, where we lived so on (spooky) even though are identities were never divulged. Crummer and Hurb tried to get us
banned from posting online - (they would show up on CC of each targeted company then creating negative talk). The
hedge fund involved, shut down after a name change, and the "independent" online (msnbc then) rating analytical site
as well changed the name. (it came out when a CEO of another targeted company, had two whistle blowers testify
that said hedge fund was placing options (puts), and having the company then come out with a rating causing the
stock to dive)... all buried now (but archived).


It wasn't that this or another company might have issues - many targeted were common big name companies, still
around, it was that the media and others were used to make profit for certain individuals.


Salient issue: Formaldehyde


I have a background in both biochemistry and chemistry of arts, health care, and holistic health, and more) (all arts
chemicals trickle down from industry). My mother was in Allopathic medicine so I grew up reading her books, biology
so on as a young child and went the other direction. One can dig up real research on Formaldehyde (I don't have the
time) or a quick search.


Formaldehyde is used in almost all products in America. (I am old enough to remember a sickening smell when ever
we'd go into fabric stores - that was formaldehyde - still there just "less" and in many many products we are all
exposed to each day.) It is even in vaccines - shot right into your or a young child's blood stream. (along with other
highly toxic items - aluminum, mercury, worse)...


What's really in vaccines? Proof of MSG, formaldehyde, aluminum and mercury


http://bit.ly/1j9oHqv


Formaldehyde - A "pickling" chemical used to preserve cadavers. It's highly toxic to the nervous system, causing
blindness, brain damage and seizures. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services openly admits that
formaldehyde causes cancer. You can see this yourself on the National Toxicology Program website, featuring its 12th
Report on Carcinogens.

Even your common toothpaste (that is why among other poisons allowed that it has a poison statement on the back -
"if you swallow contact your poison control center)- not one molecule is safe. Just as when the effects of smoking and
second hand "smoking" was acknowledge and not stopped immediately (companies would be hurt) ditto for this
industry. GRAS (generally regarded as safe) is laughable - one molecule at a time, does damage to human (other
species) physiology and much damage with or without cancer, even deaths (chemical injury).

If 60 minutes really cared about American's being harmed (and American companies produce it as well).. then an
expose on the real issue could have been done - one would think?


That is is hidden by "trade names" (one would have to read through the OSHA book - about two inches thick), that
most people can not read a label let alone a MSDS (material safety data sheet) or realize our government agencies
do not often protect the consumer (often) and often do not require labeling (even perfumes in America are made from
synthetic petro products - research "toxins in your perfumes - fragrance, products)... is the real crux of the issue here.

"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Safety provides a quick reference list of some products known to contain
