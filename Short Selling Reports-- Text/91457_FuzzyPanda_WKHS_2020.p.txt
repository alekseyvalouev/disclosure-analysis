Executive Summary: 


A few weeks ago, Hindenburg Research exposed Nikola, a high-flying EV company, as an alleged 
“intricate fraud”. The stock fell over 50% in the process. Nikola has since admitted to purposely rolling a 
truck down a hill to mask the appearance of a working prototype for a promo video… Workhorse rolled 
a USPS prototype truck down a hill accidently1 after their parking brake failed causing a union 
USPS driver to be hospitalized after jumping out of the runaway vehicle. We think this debacle as 
well as the numerous other “critical failures” we will lay out, destroyed Workhorse’s chances of 
ever landing the USPS NGDV award. 


“The parking brake failed that [Workhorse] had designed & installed…the 
truck ran away, the USPS driver, an union member, had to jump out of the 


truck while it was moving. He was injured while jumping out of the truck…he 
was actually hospitalized. I think he broke his leg. The Post Office was very 
angry about this and it resulted in the USPS refusing to do anymore testing for 


several months” 


~“A Knowledgeable Source” close to the VT Hackney-Workhorse USPS bid 2 


Bulls continue to stand by the hopes that Workhorse will win the USPS (United States Postal Service) 
“NGDV” (Next Generation Development Vehicle) $6.3 billion contract and that will open a door to new 
business and lucrative contracts. We will lay out incontrovertible NEW evidence to end any speculation 
that Workhorse will be awarded any share of the USPS NGDV contract. We will also show that major 
customers shut the door on Workhorse long ago, erasing any mentions of Workhorse Partnerships from 
filings and media.  


• VT Hackney was the prime contract bidder in the VT Hackney-Workhorse USPS bid. We learned 
from Hackney’s parent company, ST Engineering, that they exited the bid for the USPS NGDV 
program in 2019 because any award “would not be material.” 


• A source revealed that VT Hackney-Workhorse prototypes had serious performance problems 
including numerous critical failures:  


o Some of the more notable failures were their EV prototype ran out of range and got 
stranded on a road; suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks; chassis performance 
problems; extensive door failures; safety belt failures; motor failures; ran out of power on 
multiple occasions; and the parking brake failure that injured a USPS employee was 
one of the last straws. 


o Workhorse destroyed the USPS relationship further once the USPS realized they were 
being consistently misinformed. Workhorse also occasionally misinformed their partner 
VT Hackney.  


o Workhorse was unable to handle all the work as a subcontractor, leading to poor quality 
products that missed deadlines.  This resulted in VT Hackney needing to hire an 
additional subcontractor to help, Prefix.

o Workhorse does not have the ability, machinery, or engineering talent to fulfill the USPS 
contract even if they somehow won. 


• Major customers like UPS have already moved on from Workhorse–UPS COMPLETELY 
removed any mention of Workhorse in all literature.  The UPS contract now belongs almost 
exclusively to Workhorse competitor Arrival. Workhorse’s large UPS order is solely for on-
demand fulfillment which UPS has not asked for in years.  


• Investigator Visits! Employees told us that NO purchase orders are currently being 
fulfilled. They referred to the only trucks in the plant as “Show Units” and “Prototypes.”  We 
also discovered NO Automation; NO Assembly Lines; NO IP Protection and their employees 
even let us photograph their ENGINE – the engine is nonproprietary  


• Can Stock Promotion be a “Trade Secret?” Workhorse has a nefarious past working with stock 
promoters charged with fraud; nothing has changed as we uncovered an on-going scheme that 
now appear to have moved to YouTube. The 420+ videos spell out a pattern of deceptive 
practices. Workhorse and Lordstown management have supported the stock promotion by 
actively participating in interviews with the promoters 


• Even IF Workhorse wins the USPS bid, all the economics will go to Lordstown. A licensing 
agreement between Workhorse and Lordstown shows Lordstown to be a beneficiary of a 
manufacturing ROFR in the event Workhorse wins the USPS bid. The agreement implies 
Workhorse will have limited to no economics left and that it never had the capacity to 
manufacture vehicles in the first place. We also reveal just how unprofitable the trucks actually 
are… -631% estimated Gross Margins for parts alone. 


• Very little intellectual property – Workhorse only has two (old) EV patents, one drone patent, 
and five via Navistar that were previously written off as worthless. Lordstown Motors is even 
worse and has 0 IP and selected an underfunded Slovenia company for their mission critical hub 
motor.  


o Industry experts confirmed all our concerns and condemned the IP as worthless. They 
also pleaded with us not to invest in the company. 


• Who is Steve Burns? (Lordstown CEO & Workhorse Founder) Evaluating past deals we 
discover a CopyCat entrepreneur who mimics topical ideas, misleads investors, and has decades 
of destroying investor capital with the same web of individuals. Burns is NOT the next Elon 
Musk but certainly might be a much more nefarious version of Trevor Milton. 


• Enter Lordstown (Workhorse 2.0?) – USPS failures and the souring relationship led Stephen 
Burns to desperately piece together a deal for GM’s Lordstown facility moving the GM factory 
and W-15 (now Endurance) assets out of Workhorse.  


• Is anyone surprised the insiders are selling? The massive insider sales over recent months are 
the last perilous sign to investors of the inevitable collapse of the company. 


Upcoming (Potential) Negative Catalysts: 
• Q3 & Q4 Revenue Miss of Wall Street estimates. Wall Street has Workhorse production 


ramping - we heard and saw first-hand that it wasn’t. 
• Lordstown’s SPAC merger doesn’t close or gets delayed once GM & new investors realize 


Steve Burns & Lordstown Motors has more red flags than Nikola will they still invest? 
• Most importantly, USPS is expected to announce the NGVP contract winner(s) by year-end. 


According to BTIG analysis, the WKHS downside is to $1 a share (down 95%+) if the USPS 
contract is lost. We agree and believe that downside will soon be reality.

For the first time ever, we reveal why VT Hackney Sold 
Their USPS Bid Rights for Just $7.6m! 
First we asked VT Hackney WHY? They told us it would be IMMATERIAL to them.  


A major part of the Workhorse bull thesis is the potential for Workhorse to win the USPS Next 
Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) contract. USPS is in the final process of announcing the winner for 
the NGDV for an estimated 180,000 trucks3. The bidding process has gone on for 6 years now. The whole 
contract is estimated to be worth up to $6.3bn in revenue based on the initial USPS RFP Requested Price 
of $25,000 to $35,000 per truck (USPS RFP Source). 


VT Hackney’s parent company is ST Engineering, an $11 billion market cap publicly traded company in 
Singapore (S63:SP). You should think of ST Engineering as the Boeing or GE of Singapore. They have 
$5.8 billion in revenue and $1.2bn in the US. Suffice to say, a large conglomerate like ST Engineering, 
would not sell the rights to a large government contract for just $7.6 million if there was any chance it 
was viable ($1m cash + $6.6m WKHS stock – 8-K). Thus, it was very strange and unusual for us to see a 
lead bidder (VT Hackney) sell the rights to a $6.3 billion program like the USPS NGDV for an 
insignificant amount… without good reason. Especially after investing 5 years of time, resources, and 
R&D. We reached out4  and asked the question that no analyst seems to have the answer to: “Why?”  


They answered. ST Engineering considered the financial returns and VT Hackney’s estimated share (if 
awarded) to be immaterial to the Group. In FY 2018, ST’s net profit was ~$366m. We learned that ST 
Engineering dropped the project given that VT Hackney’s expected share of the USPS NGDV award (if 
awarded) was worth LESS THAN $19m. 


“…VT Hackney’s share of the USPS NGDV Program contract (if awarded) would not be 
material to the ST Engineering Group”  ”…we considers transaction as material if 


exceeds 5% of Group’s last audited Net Profits”  


 
3 NGDV contract is for replacing the Grumman Long-Life Vehicles. As of Sept 30, 2019 the USPS currently had 140,664 
Grumman LLV’s and 20,987 RHD FFVs so 161,651 current vehicles to replace (OIG Audit of USPS Acquisition Strategy).

A source REVEALED the real reasons why VT Hackney 
dropped out of the USPS NGDV bid: 


“I’m trying to be positive, but I’m trying to tell you the truth.”  
- A Knowledgeable Source 


 
With the vast majority of Workhorse’s valuation and future success reliant on the NGDV contract, we 
sought out to uncover the events of the VT Hackney-Workhorse partnership in 2016-2019 to determine if 
Workhorse truly had a chance to win the contract. Our findings and sources revealed a far worse reality 
than we could’ve imagined.  


Numerous Critical Failures – Our source revealed to us in great detail that the VT Hackney-Workhorse 
NGDV prototypes continuously experienced critical failures and breakdowns throughout their testing. 
The team’s most notable prototype failures included – motors breaking (one or two motors burnt out); 
safety belt problems; constant door problems where the doors would fail to either latch or to open; 
problems with performance of the chassis, suspension problems (including one time where the 
suspension broke when it hit a railroad track); range problems (including a couple of times where a 
truck got stranded on the road); once or twice where they ran out of power; and most notably the 
previously mentioned notorious parking brake failure resulting in a USPS employee being hospitalized. 


Workhorse has a very strained relationship with the USPS – Our source confirmed that Workhorse 
lost their original prime bid back in 2016 and as a result joined VT Hackney as a subcontractor. 
One of the simple reasons why Workhorse lost their bid was the USPS required in their specs that all 
bidders submit designs in Solidworks (a design software) and despite this Workhorse still decided to carry 
on with creating all their designs in AutoCAD.  Workhorse’s reason why was that its engineers didn’t 
know Solidworks and AutoCAD was easier to use. Workhorse’s relationship with the USPS became 
increasingly strained from Workhorse “not telling the post office the 100% truth” and “misinforming [the 
USPS] over and over again” which the post office astutely realized and caught them on multiple times. 
The breaking point in the relationship appears to have been when Workhorse’s designed and 
manufactured parking brake failed during a standard downhill test. The disastrous failure resulted in the 
hospitalization of a unionized employee, who had to “dive from a runaway vehicle”. The event caused all 
of the VT Hackney-Workhorse’s prototype testing to be halted for several months. A source told us 
Hackney may not have been part of any further testing to that point in anticipation of exiting the 
partnership. 


Workhorse’s performance, quality, and design can be best described as “makeshift” and was generally 
bad for the USPS NGDV project. Workhorse parts had large variance in components (millimeters off 
from their original design); poor fit & finish; essential deliveries would miss deadlines; and overall not 
having the best design nor execution. This failure to deliver was so bad that VT Hackney eventually was 
forced to hire an additional subcontractor “Prefix” to come in to help. Workhorse apparently even 
“misinformed” VT Hackney a few times. VT Hackney’s good engineers eventually started leaving the 
project because they didn’t want to work on a losing bid.  


Could Workhorse deliver on the contract if they were awarded it? The answer is an unequivocal NO. 
Workhorse currently does not have the capacity to mass produce anything. They lack the “tooling 
engineers and the expensive stamping machines”. Another major problem was that the trucks are required

to last 25 years and the Hackney-Workhorse prototypes were not able to come close to lasting a year or 
two. 


The Hackney-Workhorse Prototype had irrational economics of their prototype.  Apparently the parts 
alone (excluding the motors; $10k each) and Panasonic lithium batteries ($10-12k) cost $236,000. The 
USPS price max price for the truck is $35k – each truck had a Gross Profit of at least NEGATIVE 
$226,000 and that is before labor costs.  Part of these very high costs came from the fact that Workhorse 
did not manufacture the engine and key parts and instead all of those were outsourced.  


We were shocked to realize how poorly the Hackney-Workhorse prototypes performed and how bad the 
USPS and Workhorse relationship currently is. The situation at Workhorse is so much worse than anyone 
could’ve imagined that we unequivocally believe, Workhorse simply has NO chance of winning the 
NGDV contract. 


 “Ultimately, VT Hackney threw up their hands and gave up, pretty much 
every engineer had left the project”  


- A Knowledgeable Source 





Workhorse deemed the VT Hackney purchase unworthy of a press release? 
Workhorse historically press releases virtually everything (e.g. patent filings; doing a drone or vehicle 
testing; a cancelable order; and especially all new partnerships), regardless of magnitude, so we found it 
particularly telling when it omitted the VT Partnership update. Acquiring Hackney’s assets for such a 
material contract, at a pittance of its underlying value should have been an extraordinary accomplishment 
for the company. If the underlying contract was material of course: at least more so than the “Vehicle 
Demonstration and Test Drive” it chose to announce a couple days prior. Instead, the details were buried 
in an 8-K filed SEVEN days after it was finalized (USPS NGDV Asset Agreement with ST Engineering)

Workhorse’s Bid as a “Prime” Already Failed: 
We show conclusively that Workhorse was in fact eliminated from the process “early on” 


In April 2015 – Workhorse advanced from 40 interested suppliers to the next round of 15 prequalified 
suppliers – Source April 14, 2015 WKHS PR (Workhorse was formerly known as AMP Holdings but the 
management team changed the company’s name in 2015). 


Sept 16, 2016 –Workhorse FAILED to advance from the round of 15 bidders to 6 (link). 


Sept 19, 2016 –Workhorse joined VT Hackney’s Team (WKHS 9-19 Press Release; ST Engineering VT 
Hackney 9-21-16 press release) as one of the remaining 6 bidders added Workhorse as the exclusive 
SUBCONTRACTOR to build chassis & powertrain. (WKHS 10-Q - pg 19) 


Bulls have long contended that Workhorse was not eliminated by the USPS and that it simply partnered 
with VT Hackney instead. Workhorse’s own 8-k timeline debunks this but our sources have put the 
argument to rest once and for all (see below quote). One reason why Workhorse failed – Workhorse 
refused to follow a USPS design requirement to submitting all designs in Solidworks (design 
manufacturing software). Workhorse engineers used AutoCAD instead because it was easier.    


“The Post Office quote, unquote kicked [Workhorse] off the project back in 2016.”  


NEW INFO - Spring 2018 – USPS Employee hospitalized during downhill brake failure. USPS was 
rightfully angered and paused testing VT Hackney-Workhorse prototypes. 


Below is the story Workhorse tries to tell investor vs. the truth.

Supplier A or D will likely win the USPS Contract – we 
prove that Workhorse is neither! 


“The vehicles delivered by 4 out 5 suppliers experienced critical safety failures” 
~Office of the Inspector General Report on USPS NGDV Program567 


For the sake of thoroughness, we looked at the remaining bidding teams and analyzed their vehicles as 
well as their ability to deliver for the USPS if they won the contract.  


There are only 3 remaining bidders for the USPS NGDV contract. In August, the OIG released that 
bidding has taken so long due to “4 out of the 5 suppliers having critical failures.”  Reconciling each 
bidding group’s track record and prototype design provides valuable insight into who each one of the 
suppliers could be. 


Team Oshkosh-Ford: They were the only qualified bidder who used an existing and thoroughly tested 
vehicle in their bid. Their USPS prototype bid was built using a modified standard Ford Transit Cargo 
Van (Source) and is diesel powered per the initial USPS RFP request instructions. Likelihood of No 
critical safety failures – Very High.  


Team Karsan-Morgan Olson:  They submitted an EV that is a plug-in hybrid for their bid (photos). 
Karsan is a Turkish Bus manufacturer with $330m of revenue and automated factory with a 1 shift 
capacity of 18,200 vehicles. Karsan also started shipping their 2 Electric Bus models in 2019 and have 
sold them in 10 countries including Germany (2019 annual report). Morgan Olson, a Michigan based 
manufacturer has the highest customer satisfaction in the “walk-in van” industry (rated by Fortune 500 
companies; source). Competitors told us that Morgan Olson is a “known entity for the USPS and they 
have a long deep history of working together.”  We also learned the Karsan-Olson prototype vehicle use 
the same BMW i3 battery pack that multiple competitors do and it is viewed as cost competitive with 
excellent reliability. Likelihood of No critical safety failures – Pretty High.

Team VT Hackney&Workhorse: The Hackney-Workhorse group submitted an EV truck with a small 
BMW gasoline engine as a generator (photos here). Workhorse was meant to supply the powertrain & 
chassis and VT Hackney build the body. Workhorse’s filings tell us battery packs are built in-house (aka 
re-assembled by hand – pg 4). The 2018 risk section and a separate section under “Batteries Are Key” 
shows Workhorse’s reliance on Panasonic batteries (their only fully qualified supplier - pg 12). The 
section noted above no longer exists and the battery packs that Workhorse once declared as a key 
differentiator from competitors also disappeared from any further disclosure. A former Workhorse 
supplier, All Cell Technologies, is actually now suing Workhorse (source) for patent infringement on 
using their battery patents illegally8. Panasonic also no longer appears as a strategic supplier as of 2019 
(2019-10K). On the basis of this alone we had a pretty strong feeling that Workhorse was the 
responsible for the “Prototype that died on the testing track.”  


All this above can be determined without speaking with primary sources where we learned in detail about 
prototypes critical failures for Team Workhorse’s vehicles like: 


• “Parked vehicles rolling away”  
• “Parking brake intermittent function”  
• “Cracks in subframe”  
• “Prototype vehicle dying on track”  
• As well as many more the OIG didn’t specifically call out “doors not latching;” “the suspension 


breaking;” “running out of power;” “motors burning out” and more.  


 “The pressure to get a vehicle from prototype to 
production in a short amount of time with very little 
funding means that a lot of corners are cut. Good 
engineers are forced to turn in work that is subpar 
and move on to the next task” ~ Employee review of 
Workhorse (2019) 


Our sources confirmed the above sentiment saying 
that Workhorse “..has good engineers but they just bit 
off more than they can chew.” 


Workhorse Additional Playbook to Anger the 
Government – Keeping a PPP Loan 


If attempting to deceive the USPS & injuring their 
employees wasn’t enough. Workhorse decided to up 
their game in 2020 by being one of the few public 
companies to take a PPP Loan & then refuse to 
return it (link). Workhorse is one of the few publicly 
traded companies that DID NOT return their PPP Loan. If Workhorse had any actual chance at winning a 
large government contract then obviously they would’ve immediately returned the PPP Loan once they 
secured their $70m capital raise in late June 2020. We think both Democrats & Republicans can agree 
that is despicable.  


 
8 Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-2975 (link) On July 18, 2019, All Cell Technologies, LLC and Illinois Institute of Technology filed a 
Complaint for Patent Infringement against Workhorse in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana 
claiming infringement of US Patent No. 6,468,689, 6,942,944 and, 8,273,474. The case is currently on-going.

Workhorse Disappeared from UPS Reports & Filings in 2019! 
January 2020 - UPS invested equity in EV competitor Arrival + ordered an additional 10,000 
trucks from to supply EVs to US & Europe.  


Nothing says a contract is dead like eliminating all mentions of your former partner from filings. That is 
just what UPS did when they released their UPS’s 2019 Sustainability Report. UPS eliminated all 
mentions of collaborating with Workhorse who was prominently featured in the 2018 Report (pg 30) and 
mentioned in the opening statements in 2017 Report (pg 3). Our research shows that “UPS currently has a 
fleet of more than 10,300 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles.” More importantly, in 
January 2020, UPS Ventures made an equity investment into Arrival, a UK based EV company (link), 
and committed to buying an additional 10,000 all-electric vehicles from Arrival for the US & UK 
Market. As our industry expert calls revealed: reliability, word of mouth, and trust are all key parts of the 
relationships in the EV space. “The biggest indicator I see in our industry are not [initial] orders. It’s 
reorders.” UPS is still committed to sustainability and buying EV Trucks…just not with Workhorse 
anymore. 


What happened to the 950 trucks on order with 
Workhorse? Workhorse will tell every potential investor 
about an additional order from UPS for 950 trucks9 that 
they received in early 2018 after an initial delivery of 50 
vehicles10. However, they have failed to mention that the 
contract is actually for production on an On-Demand 
Basis by UPS (aka Workhorse only builds & delivers a 
truck when UPS specifically asks for one) (8-K for UPS-
Workhorse 2018 Amended Contract)11 Workhorse’s 
financials tell a dismal story: since that initial order of 50 
trucks was delivered in Q1-2018, Workhorse has only 
earned $756,000 in revenue through Q2-2020. We believe 
sell-side analysts are mis-modeling future UPS revenue by 
forecasting it into Q4 and full-year 2021 – in reality all of 
UPS’s volume has already gone to Arrival.  


What about the 4 UPS trucks our investigator located 
behind dumpsters in Union City? A Workhorse 
employee indicated to our investigator that they were 
manufacturing only “Show-Units,” aka “prototypes”. 


UPS Drones – the sustainability report contains information regarding UPS’s drone partnership with 
Matternet. Workhorse is no longer mentioned. However, we did find a drone test of Workhorse 
demonstrating the HorseFly for UPS unofficially involved the drone crashing apparently “due to 
interference.” “The drone aborted its launch, tried to land on top of the UPS truck, fell to the side and was 
nearly crushed by the still-closing lid of the vehicle” (Techcrunch Feb 2017).

10https://www.pressroom.ups.com/pressroom/ContentDetailsViewer.page?ConceptType=PressReleases&id=1519225541368-230  
11 “The timing of the balance of the 950 N-GENs will be on a timeframe solely determined by UPS, which is entitled to reduce 
or cancel the order in its sole discretion on the result of the test fleet.” (SEC Link 2018-05-31 WKHS 8-K) “Buyer will 
determine, at its sole discretion, the level of success of the 50 vehicle test” (SEC Link)

Field of Dreams Workhorse Edition – “We won’t build it so 
no one will come” – but our investigators still did  
We found that Workhorse Assembles Trucks by Hand! There Are No Robots, Machines or 
Assembly Lines to Support Production; Employees Refer to Trucks as “Show-units” 


On several occasions in September 2020, Fuzzy Panda Research sent investigators to visit Workhorse 
Facilities in hopes of answering some questions. We assumed our attempts to learn more at the facilities 
of a ~$3 billion market cap company with the potential for a pending $6.3 billion government contract 
would be met with intense security. We found things to be way worse than we expected. Workhorse 
employees kindly invited us in, showed us around, and even allowed us to take photographs everywhere 
including of a supposedly propriety prototype ENGINE (see below & Appendix C) at both locations: 


• Workhorse Factory & Production – Union City, Indiana - 940 State Route 32 
• Workhorse R&D and HQ – Loveland, Ohio – 100 Commerce Dr. 


The following are key highlights of our visit:  
• NO Active purchase orders being worked on. Employees told us told that no purchase orders 


were currently in production for customers (so much for fulfilling the UPS 950 truck order) 
• “Show Units” – Employees at Union City, where 4 UPS branded trucks were parked behind 


dumpsters, referred to the units as “show units” and “prototypes” 
• NO Automation – All production at the 


facility still occurs MANUALLY 
without a sophisticated assembly line or 
any automation in place 


• NO Security – Workhorse employees 
invited us into both Union City 
Assembly Plant and the “secure” area of 
their Loveland R&D facility. They even 
let us photograph their old engine. 


• All truck production and assembly 
occurs exclusively in Union City; the 
Union City plant is Workhorse’s only 
production line and it is badly in need of 
additional capex investment  


Inside the Loveland R&D facility, where 
employees showed us all engine models and 
prototype drones and even gave our investigator 
permission to take photos.  


This picture of the engine shows a non-
proprietary engine and inverter we identified 
to be made by Dana (TM4) by the label. We 
also identified various generic Chinese parts.

Below are the relevant excerpts from conversations (See Appendix C for more): 


Union City, Indiana – September 2020 Investigator invited inside Assembly Line Plant 
Investigator: Are those trucks for a particular customer? 
Employee: No, those are just show units 
Investigator: What does that mean like they are prototypes? 
Employee: Yeah, they're not production 
Investigator: Are you making any production units for customers right now? 
Employee: No, not right now 
Investigator: Is this the only facility where you make units or if there's another one on site? 
Employee: No, this is the only production line 
Investigator: How many of them they do make in a week or a month? 
Employee: These are just the show units so they're not really doing that 


Loveland, Ohio – September 2020 Investigator Conversation within R&D facility: 
Employee: … really most of the production line is in Union City. 
Investigator: Is it manual or automated? Here looks like everything is manual? 
Employee: Here [Loveland] it's all manual, but there [Union City] it's all in a production line. 
Investigator: So there's automation there? 
Employee: No, it's still manual, but it's more of a process there, here is more R&D.  


We made a video so investors could do their own drive through diligence on the Union City Workhorse 
Facility since it does not appear on Google Maps

 “The Extreme Difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well 
understood. It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The 


machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself” 
Elon Musk – Sept 21, 2020 (Link to Tweet) 





Investors don’t need to trust us and can actually 
watch Workhorse’s own videos below to confirm 
the facilities we visited have: 


• No automation 
• Assembling trucks by hand – Both videos show 


employees assembling trucks and parts by HAND 
• Loveland, Ohio R&D facility is barren with 


employees building/designing parts on wooden 
work benches 


• No evidence of Elon Musk’s “Machines that 
Make the Machine”

Workhorse Inside the Facility Video 2 – Posted to YouTube April 8, 2020 (YouTube Link) 


Workhorse Financials confirm the same story we see inside the factory. A complete lack of investment 
in automation & facilities. From 2012 through to Q2 2020 Workhorse has only spent $3.8m on Capex. 
2015 financials (pg 24) show only $500,000 of equipment acquired from Navistar. Workhorse has 
invested next to nothing in one of the most capital-intensive businesses. 


The state of Workhorse’s facilities and assembly plant would be a deal breaker for the USPS: 


When speaking with a Workhorse’s EV competitor that has already sold prototype EVs to USPS we 
learned that: 


“USPS is a very sophisticated buyer” and “does a very good job diligencing every 
detail”.  


- Management of an EV Competitor 


 
The USPS would ensure that a selected bidder serious about the RFP has already adequately invested in 
its facility and would be able to handle the large production volume it requires. They also told us that 
there is no way the USPS would risk tying their fate to a company that cannot demonstrate they can fulfill 
the contract. Trucks are an essential component to USPS’s last mile delivery and to the delivery of US 
Mail.  


“How long would it take them to scale up capacity? How much would it cost?”  


“I’m not confident Workhorse has the wherewithal to do it…in any amount of time or 
with any amount of money to be successful”

Is Workhorse (and Lordstown’s) Patent Portfolio Worth“Less”? 
 


“I don’t know what tech we would buy [from Workhorse]... 
Honestly, they don’t have much tech”.  


- Management of an EV Competitor 





Workhorse’s 10% stake in Lordstown in exchange for using their IP values Workhorse’s IP currently at 
~$350m, so we asked a well-respected competitor what Workhorse IP they would buy and at what price. 
They answered…there is nothing to buy.  


Workhorse’s published patent portfolio currently consists of a total of 8 Patents. Only two patents are 
related to Electric Vehicles at all. Those two patents include a 2011 patent for coolant fluid distributing 
throughout a “car” (not truck) – US Patent 8,541,915 and a 2015 patent – US Patent 9,481,256 that is for 
recharging electric batteries while breaking, while referencing an EV that also has a combustion engine. 
Five of those patents were previously written off as worthless by Navistar’s accountants (in Q2-2012) and 
given to Workhorse with the Navistar facility purchase (link). Then there is the one drone related patent – 
we will address this later. More importantly, most of the patents are not even currently fully owned by 
Workhorse and are held as collateral for an HT Investments MA loan. 


We do a full comparison of Workhorse’s worth“Less” patent portfolio vs one of their own listed 
competitors in Appendix A – Patents. 


Workhorse’s “Trade-secrets” – “They give “Selfies” with the Coke Formula?” 


Sell-side analysts are pitching the narrative that instead of patents Workhorse has “Trade Secrets.” 
However, Workhorse has No Security guarding these supposed trade secrets. They allowed us, complete 
strangers, into the assembly plant and R&D facility to take pictures and videos. Companies with “Trade 
Secrets” do not invite strangers into their top-secret lab and show them their engines (well really it was 
someone else’s) and drones.  


Could the “Trade Secrets” be hiding outside the assembly plant and R&D facility?  Maybe they are 
software related?  We only found 5 software engineers that currently work for Workhorse Group and 3 
were hired within the 13 months.  


We also did some R&D analysis using the 10-k’s and it shows that during in FY 2019, WKHS incurred 
$28,352 in software expense relative to $8.2m spent on R&D, representing a mere 0.9% of total R&D 
expense and they spent a grand total of $329,798 from 2014-2019 on software. So much for their claims 
about “In-House Software Development is Essential” & claims to have “Proprietary Software” 











The “trade secrets” definitely aren’t software related.

Compare the R&D workforces.  
Tesla currently has over 7,200 employees with the title “engineer” including many top PhDs and 
aerospace engineers developing their cutting edge technology.  


What does Workhorse have? 


LEADING Workhorse’s Engineering efforts are a DeVry grad (online college/trades school), a 
University of Phoenix grad (online college), and a recent college grad (2017). 


• Director of Engineering 1 – received his Engineering degree from DeVry University. In the 2 
years before he joined Workhorse he was a General Contractor for dentist’s offices and also 
installed home theaters.  


• Director of Engineering 2 – took 4 years to receive an MBA which he got from the University of 
Phoenix. Despite having joined Workhorse in July 2019 his LinkedIn notes that he is currently 
looking for a new job and has his resume listed. Maybe that MBA is working! 


• Aerospace Project Manager – Graduated from college in 2017 and immediately became in charge 
of the drone program in Sept 2017 (Video from 2018 confirming)  


We think that workhorse’s (24 total) engineers are under-qualified and-over worked engineers and thus 
are unlike to produce any patents or trade secrets worth protecting. 











Workhorse has secrets, but we don’t think their IP is one of them. 








So what are Workhorse’s “Trade Secrets”?

Workhorse & Steve Burns are connected to Illegal Paid Stock 
Promoters charged with FRAUD 
1) Workhorse’s Partner from 2009-2015 CSIR Group was charged with Fraud by the SEC: 


Workhorse (formerly known as AMP 
Holdings) paid CSIR Group for stock 
promotion services. The SEC charged CSIR 
for a “Fraudulent Stock Promotion Scheme” 
in which it “hired writers…to publish 
dozens of bullish articles on its clients, 
which appeared to be independent research 
pieces.” (SEC litigation Release; Full SEC 
Charges vs CSIR) 
WKHS’s prior annual reports directly 
disclosed their relationship with CSIR, but 
like with most of the “secrets of the past,” any 
mention has been erased from future filings.  
 
“On June 1, 2010, the Company and CSIR 
Group, LLC (“CSIR”) entered into a letter 
agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) 
amending that certain services 
agreement between the Company and CSIR, 
dated October 20, 2009. CSIR provides 
investor relations to the Company.  Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, in addition to a monthly fee, the 
Company agreed to issue CSIR a common stock purchase warrant (the “Warrant”) to acquire 240,000 
shares of common stock on a cashless basis at an exercise price of $0.40 per share for a period of five 
years. The Warrants will vest quarterly in installments of 30,000 over the initial two years of the term of 
the Warrant..”  (8-K for Agreement signed by Steve Burns & mentioned in 2014 10-K pg 17) 


Steve Burns Workhorse Founder, CEO and current Lordstown CEO - signed that agreement.

Workhorse is also connected to SeeThruEquity Research – The SEC Charged SeeThruEquity with 
“Fraud” (SEC v. SeeThruEquity LLC case 1:18-cv-10374) for writing paid favorable reports and then 
portraying the reports as unbiased. SeeThruEquity issued multiple positive reports on Workhorse 
(previously named AMP Holdings) from at least 2014-2015 (Workhorse Initiation, Workhorse Update) 





 
 
On November 9, 2018, SEC charged SeeThruEquity for defrauding investors by issuing reports based on 
“unbiased” and “not paid for” research.

Introducing - YouTube Stock Promotions Uncovered: 
Workhorse and Lordstown Motors are the subject of one of the most aggressive stock promotion schemes 
we have ever witnessed. We have documented > 420 Workhorse stock promotional videos12 with 
>1000 views since June. (We didn’t even count the other thousands with <1k views). In all we have found 
greater than 80 individual stock promoters for Workhorse. 


These videos are professionally edited and feature carefully constructed YouTube personalities meant to 
appeal to retail investors. Notably all the accounts “report” virtually the same “Breaking News” every 
couple of days with misleading and false statements about why Workhorse will get the USPS contract.  


The promoters have invented compelling and relatable life stories like a young Utah man (AJ Byrd) who 
wants to buy a home but has expensive Type 1 Diabetes so is teaching his followers how to become 
MASSIVELY WEALTHY by trading stocks. His favorite Long Idea of course is Workhorse. 


We believe this is ILLEGAL stock promotion as none of the individuals disclose their motivations or 
compensation behind promoting Workhorse. The only disclosure that is typically noted is that “They are 
Not a Financial Advisor.” 


Workhorse and Steve Burns have a long history of partnering with stock promoters that the SEC have 
since accused of fraud & illegal stock promotion so we think this might be more of the same. See below 
for some summary figures of Workhorse’s YouTube.com stock promoters (Appendix B for Full List) 





 
12 Note – We ultimately collected >1TB of stock promotion videos and documented their “authors” as well as the misleading & 
lacking disclaimers. Video back-ups are stored both in the cloud and an off-line drive just in case the SEC is interested.

Examples of the 80 channels include: “CakeTrader” A 20 year old guy trading stocks (in his mom’s 
basement?).  


One of his recent stock promotion videos titled “Workhorse USPS Contract Leaked?” includes a link to a 
phone number for the now bankrupt Navistar subsidiary (“Workhorse Custom Chassis”) to suggest 
Workhorse has actually already won the USPS contract. 


“George Perez” a former accountant with a lisp who “Gives no F*cks” but has >66,000 views of him 
promoting Workhorse on the false idea that a 6 year old government procurement program has tripled in 
value overnight.  
(USPS owns 203,767 vehicles – 23,920 that are only 0-4 yrs old * RFP price of $25,000 to $35,000 = 
George also didn’t give “F” in Math Class and now he’s a Stock Promoter) – (OIG USPS Report)

So what will mgmt do when they find out about the stock promoters? 
Give live interviews of course! Based on Workhorse and Steve Burns’s history of paying illegal stock 
promoters, is anyone surprised?  Worst of all, Workhorse CFO, Steve Schrader, is clearly proud of his 
stock promotion as he has gone ahead and shared BOTH of his promotional videos with a former Irish 
BodyBuilder “JackSpencer Investing” on his LinkedIn page (Interview 1; Interview 2)  


Which other companies do you think we found actively supporting the stock promotion?  If you guessed 
Steve Burns of Lordstown Motors, then you are correct!  Nice of him to take time out of his busy 
schedule of photo ops with President Trump to promote Lordstown with Jack Spencer. (YouTube Link) 





We suspect (but cannot currently prove) that these promotions are being paid for by Workshorse and 
Lordstown Motors due to Workhorse’s & Steve Burns long connection to illegal stock promoters.   


Go to YouTube type in “Workhorse Stock” or “Lordstown Motors Stock” and decide for yourself.

Workhorse’s History of Shady Financial Partners: 
• Charged by SEC for being “An Unregistered Penny Stock Dealer” 
• Fined & Banned by FINRA for Stock Manipulation & Fraud 
• Accused of Fraud & Wrong-doing by Customers 


JMJ Financial – Workhorse Financial Partner - CEO, Steve Burns, executed off-balance sheet 
arrangements with JMJ Financial 
as a financial partner for 
Workhorse Group both in 
December 2013 and then again in 
July 2015. 
 
In March, 2020, the SEC Charged 
JMJ Financial and owner Justin 
W. Keener with being an 
“Unregistered Penny Stock 
Dealer.”  
(pg 28 & 29 of 2015 10-K) 
 
Again, the agreements have Steve 
Burns signature on them.  
(2015 WKHS Off Balance Sheet 
agreement with JMJ Financial 
signed by Steve Burns) 
 


John Carris Investments (JCI) – Steve Burns hired John Carris Investments as Workhorse’s 
EXCLUSIVE  Financier & Placement Agent in 2009 (Agreement with JCI pg 3)  


• JCI & Workhorse worked together on 3 major fundraising agreements Oct 2010 Agreement – 
Signed by Steve Burns; April 2011 Workhorse Agreement;  Jan 2012 Agreement 


Unsurprisingly, as a hand selected Steve Burns and Workhorse partner, John Carris Investments has since 
been Expelled by FINRA and Bared CEO George Carris for Fraud13 


• FINRA Findings included “Stock Manipulation,” “Fraudulent Stock Sales,” “Matched 
Trading” 


 
Northeast Securities - Workhorse’s Banker & Placement Agent (Accused of Fraud – 2017 FINRA 
Settlement) Steve Burns brought in Northeast Securities in 2012 as Workhorse’s Bankers(2015 10-K pg 
29). Fast forward to 2017 and we discover that Northeast Securities was accused of “common law fraud,

churning, breach of fiduciary duty…” (Tim McLaughlin vs Northeast Securities 16-01806) and that 
claimant was awarded $1.6m.  


Marshall S. Cogan – For a brief period in 2015, Workhorse & Steve Burns hired Marshall S. Cogan as 
their Chief Investment Officer. A basic internet search reveals a Barron’s article from January 2000 
alleging that Marshall Funneled Money out of a firm called Foamex that he previously controlled, to his 
own investment vehicle Trace International (Barons Article). The SEC brought an informal inquiry into 
Foamex Internal Controls which Foamex settled.  
Who is Financing Workhorse Today? 
Who was the undisclosed investor behind Workhorse’s 70m June Capital Raise?  


• Was it Ark Investment Management? NO! (Ark only own 
WKHS in an ETF) 


• Was it Elon Musk, Tesla, or some Silicon Valley Luminary? 
NO! 


It is High Trail Capital14 - A hedge fund no one has ever heard of, 
that formed 1 year ago (Sept 2019), and seems to be a former related 
party to Workhorse. The founder of High Trail Capital was 
previously the Co-Head of Oppenheimer Equity Capital Markets.    


While Eric H co-lead Oppenheimer banking, they participated in 
multiple deals with Workhorse, including  


• As a lead in a January 2017 equity raise for $22.4 million 
(Jan 2017 Prospectus).  


• As the placement agent in the Workhorse deal to sell SureFly 
(Sec Filing - Pg 7)  


• As an advisor in a September 2017 equity raise for which 
Oppenheimer was paid an advisory fee despite Cowen being 
the sole book runner (pg S-25 Sept 2017 WKHS Prospectus).  


An Oppenheimer sell-side colleague conveniently announced 
initiating with an Outperform right after his former “boss” completed 
his fundraising deal (Oppenheimer 9-2-2020 Outperform).  


Fun Patent Fact – Workhorse’s EV Patents are currently assigned to 
High Trail Capital as Collateral.  


Tesla had Elon Musk, Nikola at least has ValueAct, and 
Workhorse has…a hedge fund launched last year that has probably 
sold their whole stake already.

Workhorse Drone Program – “Horsefly” or more “Horse$h-t”? 
The UPS-Workhorse’s drone partnership was a major part of the bull thesis in 2017, but like most of 
Workhorse’s significant strategic relationship, UPS has moved on – Workhorse is still promoting it.  


Update on UPS Drones Program today – UPS appears to have dropped Workhorse and partnered with 
Matternet, a prominent silicon valley drone company, in 2019 (link) on UPS Flight Forward. In 2019, 
UPS Flight Forward received FAA Part 135 certification and FAA Approval to run a drone airline. They 
launched that airline and it is currently delivering medical supplies to hospitals.  


Meanwhile Workhorse is still busy making promotional videos in their parking lot on a phone and trolling 
their former partner by tagging them in the videos. Once again, we did a thorough search and found 0 
mentions of Workhorse drones from UPS since Dec 2018.15 


Much to the appeal of our YouTubers, video footage actually seems to be the easiest way to explain how 
this partnership has imploded. 


2017 Video on the Right – (2017 UPS + Workhorse video) UPS & Workhorse released an impressive 
advertisement regarding collaborating together on drones. At that time UPS was still actively choosing to 
be associated with Workhorse e.g. see this press release.  


2020 Video on the Left – Fast-forward to 2020 and it appears that UPS will not even allow Workhorse to 
use a UPS truck in the background of their promotional videos. Both of those videos are shot on an 
iPhone in what appears to be Workhorse’s parking lot. (2020 Workhorse Video 1) and UPS is nowhere to 
be found except for Workhorse trolling their old partner by tagging them. (2020 Workhorse Video 2 
claims to be a Coronavirus Response Test) 





 
15 Note – Workhorse did successfully get themselves inserted into a Virgina CIT Coronavirus Press Release that also has the UPS 
Freight Forward Team listed in it (April 21 CIT press release & partnership announcement)

Customer Complaints regarding Workhorse Drones - Unmanned Systems Operation Group (USOG) 
who bought and tested an early version of Workhorse’s drone, HorseFly, says the product suffers from 
critical quality issues, including poor navigation software, and substandard construction. They 
identified 25 issues with the drones including taped and glued on components. As a result, USOG was 
unable to fly the drones. (Barrons Article 8-28-2020)  


When our investigator was welcomed into Workhorse’s Loveland, Ohio R&D lab, they were brought to 
by the drone area and shown the current models by Workhorse employees. The single engineer that was 
working on the drone program explained that they had a wind problem with the Workhorse hexacopter 
(6 blades) design. Apparently, the Workhorse’s 6 blade model is unreliable and gets unstable when the 
wind is >5mph.  


Some Inconvenient Drone Facts: 


• Workhorse’s Horsefly does not have FAA Certification. Meanwhile, Matternet and UPS are 
actively running a Drone Airline. Here is a video of UPS & Matternet Drones from 2019. 


• The Workhorse drone even fails in press demonstrations. Crashed in a 2017 UPS demonstration 
(Techcrunch Feb 2017). “We’ve never seen it [do that] before.” ~Steve Burns of the crash 


• In a market study “Autonomous Last Mile Delivery Market” by Allied Market Research, 
Workhorse is not even listed as a major market competitor16. 


• Patents – Workhorse has only 1 drone package patent. That patent isn’t for specialized 
navigation or some other awesome drone technology but instead is essentially for the drone being 
lifted up and down out of a hole in the truck’s roof. The saddest realization we had when 
reading through Workhorse’s Horsefly patent was that evidently, they didn’t even bother to 
edit it properly. There is a spelling mistake in the very first sentence. Workhorse patented 
putting a “Señor” (A Spanish Gentleman?) inside their trucks. With attention to detail like this we 
are no longer surprised that the drone crashes during test flights. 








 
16 Major Players according to Allied Market Research Study are - Airbus S.A.S., Matternet, Flirtey, Drone Delivery Canada, 
Flytrex, Amazon.com, JD.com, Inc., Marble Robot, Starship Technologies, Savioke, DHL International, UPS, and DPD

Workhorse Competitor Commentary:  


On Workhorse Order Cancelations:  
“In the past, we’ve had customers come to us after canceling orders from Workhorse 


after having those delayed for a long time and not getting what they ordered.” 
On Workhorse Salesforce:  


“We don’t see them in a ton of competitive selling situations either…there aren’t 
Workhorse salespeople out there competing for deals. Mostly we just get 


[Workhorse’s] press releases promising moonshots”.  
- Management of an EV Competitor 


 
Other Customers – Large Orders Press Released but Never Fulfilled 
Fedex – Fedex ordered 20 Trucks from Workhorse in 2016 (Q2-2016 Presentation). It appears that only 
two have ever been delivered. One in Q3-2017 and another built by Workhorse and charged by a Plug 
Power truck for FedEx Express on May 30, 2018.  


• Our industry expert calls have revealed that a true mark of quality is characterized by re-
orders: Fedex not only didn’t reorder, but after testing two trucks for the last 2-3 years, 
decided that they didn’t want any additional ones from Workhorse. 


Ryder – 25 trucks on order and they just delivered their first 2 trucks 
• Workhorse is featured in a section of Ryder’s website with the old model E-100 and the old 


W-15 pickup truck (listed as available in 2018) – so we are not confident in the quality of 
this key customer given their disinterest in even updating the website 
(https://ryder.com/Solutions/Fleet-Leasing/Advanced-Vehicle-Technology/Workhorse-
electric-pickup-truck) 


 
eTrucks - initial order of 20 C-1000's from Cincinnati based eTrucks which was received in Q2-2020 
(link). If they have an experience similar to UPS, DHL, FedEx and all the smaller customers we doubt 
they will be reordering in the future or even if they take delivery of all 20.  
 
DHL – signed a purchase order in October 2018 for N-Gen Trucks (March 18, 2019 press release). The 
number ordered wasn’t mentioned but recent disclosure shows DHL having received delivery. The only 
Automotive Revenue for Workhorse disclosed since October 2018 came in Q1-2019, so from that we 
learn that DHL has not received another delivery in the last 2 years. 


Customer Results – UPS dropped Workhorse from all its recent filings and FedEx and DHL have not 
asked for any additional trucks in the last two or three years after their first ones were delivered. We 
wonder what Workhorse has told the USPS about why their largest customers haven’t reorderd in years 
when it asks for references from previous customers?

Recent Press Release Hype – Hitachi Example 


Workhorse has a long history of failed promises. After watching 15-20 YouTube videos pumping a press 
release involving Hitachi (Aug 31, 2020 - Press Release), we feel it’s necessary to debunk their hype 
(note: our belief is that this is a consistent pattern; Workhorse over embellishes every contract by 
referring to a simple supply contract as a “Strategic Agreement”)  


When Workhorse management was asked by potential investors…they admit it. 


a) Workhorse is paying Hitachi a consulting fee to assess the improvements it needs to make at 
Union City and Loveland in order to produce trucks (perhaps this is a premonition into 
Worhorse’s reliance on Lordstown for manufacturing moving forward). After our recent visit, we 
(Fuzzy Panda Research) are happy to provide our assessment for free – YOU NEED TO BUY 
ROBOTS TO BUILD TRUCKS. Your competitors started doing this in the 1940s & 1950s 
(source) 


b) Hitachi Capital agreed to provide financing solutions for Workhorse customers & dealers: if 
anyone actually places a reorder (which hasn’t happened recently), then Hitachi will be 
Workhorse’s bank. 


Only a few days back though, Hitachi seems to have already blown that story out of the water when they 
announced a significant commitment into the US EV business by establishing Hitachi Automotive 
Electric Motor Systems. Once again, Workhorse is not mentioned anywhere (link).

Workhorse Management: 
Duane Hughes, CEO – The most remarkable thing we have found about Duane is that his background 
(Duane Hughes LinkedIn) before joining Workhorse makes him completely unqualified to run an 
automotive or industrial company. His whole career was in publishing and newspapers. Before 
Workhorse, Duane was a SVP & COO at a publishing company. Suspiciously, the only thing that seems 
to qualify him is being friends with Steve Burns. Before Rockwell, Duane worked at Gannett Media 
Technologies in Cincinnati Ohio, a 15-person subsidiary, of Gannett Co, one of the largest newspaper 
producers in the US. Duane happened to join Gannett in the same year Burns sold his company Over The 
Line/AdLink to this subsidiary of Gannett.  


Steve Schrader, new CFO (and 3rd CFO since 2017), was involved in a Notorious Union Busting 
Campaign.  


If you thought the Postal Union didn’t like Workhorse after the 2018 incident, then what are odds the 
Postal Union (APWU) or UAW will be willing to work with Workhorse’s new CFO Steve Schrader who 
was top management during a union busting campaign at his previous employer, Fuyao Glass America? 
Steve was the long-time CFO at Fuyao. If Fuyao sounds familiar it’s because there was an Academy 
Award winning Netflix Documentary, American Factory, about their unfair labor practices.  


If a union comes in, I’m shutting it down. They keep interfering with my production.”  
- Fuyao Chairman Cao Dewang (to Management including Steve) 


 
Steve was Fuyao’s CFO throughout the unfair labor practices & union busting catalogued in the 
documentary and amazingly continued to work even there after the “American Factory” expose came out.

Steve Burns – The Copycat Entrepreneur: 
When evaluating Steve Burns’s 30-year track record at his other companies we discovered some 
curious patterns. 


A) Each of Burns’s ideas appear to be a CopyCat of a very successful idea or start-up 
launched at the time.  


B) There is no relative experience in EV’s, Clean Energy, or Auto Manufacturing. 
C) The same multi-decade web of managers are connected to all of these seemingly random 


group of very small companies. 
 
Steve Burns describes himself as a serial entrepreneur, in our opinion, he sports shades of Trevor Milton. 
His past shows a much darker story, filled with a history of copy-cat companies, many of which were 
previously alleged to be stock promotions themselves.  
 
Steve Burns has a strong history of “over-embellishing” and failing to deliver. In Steve Burn’s Workhorse 
bio in WKHS 10-Ks, he attempts to mislead investor to think that one of his past companies was a 
success. Saying that “Askmenow Inc” was “acquired” by Ocean West Holdings. In fact, this is really the 
same company and Ocean West simply changed its name to Askmenow Inc in subsequent filings. The 
SEC later revoked registration and suspended trading in Askmenow Inc. (link).   
 
“Ocean West Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation ( the “Company”, ”we”, ”us” or “our”), has obtained the written consent of 
the holder of more than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on March 4, 2005, to (i) change our name 
to InfoByPhone, Inc, or AskMeNow, Inc. (ii) increase our authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares and (iii) delete from the 
Certificate of Incorporation of the company the provisions allowing cumulative voting. In Addition, the Board of Directors of the 
Company has approved the spin off our operating subsidiary Ocean West Enterprises, Inc. (the Subsidiary”). (SEC Source 1) (SEC 
Source 2)  
 
Steve Burns Entrepreneurial Track Record: 
 
Over The Line/AdLink, was founded by Burns in 1991 and sold to Gannett Inc (NYSE:GCI) in 1994 
and renamed to Gannett Media Technologies. 


• Steve Burns (Lordstown CEO) and Duane Hughes (Workhorse CEO) met Gannett Media 
Technologies (note: Gannett is a newspaper company not an auto-manufacturer) 


 
PocketScript, Founded by Burns in 1999 (here) and sold in July 2003 for <$1.4m in stock to ZixCorp 
(ZIXI:NASDAQ) (Pg 3 of 2003 ZIXI annual report). PocketScript had a team of ~13 people and was 
supposed to be a leading mobile electronic prescription system.  Sound familiar we think it was bad 
CopyCat of:   


• PalmPilot was founded March 10, 1997 
 
Askmenow Inc – an OTC Penny Stock – was founded in 2000 (here) and launched in 2005 (here) it was 
delisted in 2008. SEC later revoked registration and suspended trading(link). CopyCat of: 


• Google was founded on Sept 4, 1998 (link) 
  
iTookThisOnMyPhone.com, was a mobile photo and video-sharing technology company mostly for 
Blackberry phones. Founded by Steve Burns in late 2007 (here) and ceased operation in 2011 (here).   


• Apple introduced the iPhone on Jan 9, 2007 (link) 
• Other connected individuals who worked both at “CopyCat iPhone” together and moved on 


to AMP Electric were Jack Kuntz & Daniel Zito.

Title Starts Online, Inc, was an OTC reverse merger that in 2010 pivoted and renamed their company 
AMP Electric Vehicles Holdings (now known as Workhorse).  In 2010, Steve Burns was the CEO, 
CFO & Treasurer, and founder of this penny-stock company.  


• Can you guess which company Steve was trying to be a CopyCat of this time? 
• Tesla! In 2008 Tesla launched the roadster and Tesla went public in June of 2010 (link). 


 
In 2015, the Workhorse team also invented HorseFly, the last mile package delivery drone right after the 
Drone fad was taking off. We think this is merely a continuation of Burns’ interest in replicating 
successful businesses to secure large capital contribution. In the case of Workhorse, he appears to have bit 
off far more than he could chew. 
 
Was MobileVoiceControl, Inc. an exception? – This seems to be Steve’s best Exit/Company in 2005. It 
was a developer of high-end speech recognition software for smartphones that Nuance Communications 
(Nasdaq:NUAN) acquired (link)17. Unfortunately it appears most of the revenue & success came from 
Steve inking a large partnership struck with his friends still working at Gannett (link). 
 
Finally in 2019, Steve Burns, a key employee, founder, and CEO of the Workhorse, jumped ship from 
Workhorse when the fate of their USPS bid seemed already pre-determined to fail.  On his way out the 
door, Burns managed to convince new management (aka his long-time friend and former employee 
Duane) to give him a the designs to the W-15 truck (it’s order book), and more importantly the GM 
Lordstown factory, Workhorse’s only hope of mass production.  


• Which company do we think Steve is trying to imitate with his Lordstown Motors 
“entrepreneurial venture”?   


• The timing seems to line up with ValueAct’s investment in Nikola 
 
In the case of Workhorse, Burns was in the right place, at the right time to somehow squeeze his way into 
the final bidding process for a contract that he never had a chance of winning. Much like with every other 
company he founded, however, Workhorse was never more than an idea, except in this case it will cost 
investors billions. 
 
By evaluating Steve Burns’s entrepreneurial track record we learn that he has a history of copying other 
people’s world changing ideas to raise capital.   
 
Unfortunately for his investors, Steve is not a successful entrepreneur like Larry Page & Sergey Brynn, 
Steve Jobs, or Elon Musk. 
 
Unfortunately for Steve this time the world, the media, and the hard-working people of Ohio are all 
watching.

Workhorse 2.0 = Lordstown Motors Corporation 


“[The Endurance Truck] could be a disaster, it could be great,” 
“It’s hard to tell from the outside until you actually get your hands on these things.” 


~Sharon Carty, Editor in Chief of Car & Driver (link) 


 
Today, Lordstown Motors is a brand-new company full of hope. But so far, it’s very brief history rhymes 
with failures of Steve Burns’s entrepreneurial past.  We believe that “failure to deliver” on promises and 
guidance could be considered another core “Trade Secret” for Steve Burns.  
 
The breaking of those promises has already begun regarding the timing of production of Lordstown 
Endurance truck (formerly known as the Workhorse W-15)  
 
Delivery & production timeline for the Endurance:  


• “Promising to start [Endurance] deliveries Q4-2020”– November 22 2019 article 
• “Handing the keys to fleets across the country in January 2021” – April 22, 2020  
• “Start deliveries in late Summer 2021” – Sept 24, 2020  
• Remember when Steve Burns promised to deliver the Workhorse W-15 (now called the 


Endurance) by 2018 (link) 
 
Still today, Lordstown has not filed anything with EPA (the only filings on record regarding Lordstown 
or Workhorse are Workhorse’s)18. Nor has it begun to accomplish other important items like registering 
their new engine with CARB for certification and we can find no evidence of them beginning NHTSA 
crash testing. Yet Steve is promising to make north of 100,000 by 2024 and be EBITDA positive in 
2022. 
 
A gentle reminder that Steve is the same engineer and manager whose company managed to build 
“Suspensions that broke when they hit a railroad track.” Thankfully for USPS test drivers those 
critically flawed trucks didn’t also have engines in their wheels.  
 
Lordstown’s Competitive Advantage is the “Hub Motor” – None of the IP is Lordstown’s 


At this point you probably expect that Lordstown IP portfolio is lacking anything of substance.   


Steve Burns will happily tell every video camera and even the President of the United States about 
Lordstown’s innovative “hub motor” technology. In the “World-Class Executive Team Slide” (slide 6) 
Steve claims that he has spent “5+ years designing and integrating hub motors into production vehicles” 
but oddly he and Lordstown have no patents to corroborate this.  


It turns out the fate of Lordstown Motor’s most important innovation relies on Elaphe Motors.  Elaphe is 
the real company behind Lordstown’s hub-motor that owns the patents. Digging in we discovered that 
Elaphe is a Slovenian Company, who appears to have 2 hub motor patents for in wheel motors 
(US9,862,264; WO2019139545A1) and 7 patents that are EV related. According to Crunchbase, Elaphe 
has only raised €14.2m in total between two Series A Rounds (2016 source & Sept-2020 source). Not

nearly well funded well enough to ever supply the magnitude of engines that Lordstown claims they will 
need.  


It seems like with all his past business partners Steve Burns must’ve failed to do any basic due diligence 
in finding a better capitalized competitor with a stronger portfolio of patents.  


If Lordstown wanted to bet the Endurance’s future on having a working hub motor there is an obvious 
choice that is significantly larger, better capitalized company, and with more IP. That company is 
Protean Electric which to date has raised $194m, generates an estimated $34.3m in annual revenue 
(source). Ironically, Protean’s revenue is +75% higher than the TOTAL revenue Workhorse generated 
from 2010-through Q2-2020. They also have ~69 patents for Hub Motors and 124 total patents for 
electric vehicles and 104 employees (see below Patent IP comparison & Exhibit – A).  





We can’t see how choosing a small undercapitalized company with less IP could possibly be the right 
choice, but maybe given’s Steve Burns’s history of partners an obscure Slovenian partner was Lordstown 
Motor’s only option.  


Insecure Order Book – if you build it we might buy it? 
Burns has stated that Lordstown Motors focus is the “fleet market.”  The interesting thing about the fleet 
market is that it is very easy to get customers to happily place large “orders” provided you give them the 
ability to cancel for free and don’t force them to put down large deposits.  That appears to be exactly what 
Lordstown Motors strategy is as the order is fully cancelable or non-binding.  This can be highlighted 
with some of the very stale orders with selected “pre-order customers”: 


• Duke Energy placed their “non-binding letter of interest” back in Nov 2016 
• Clean Fuels Ohio ordered “500 W-15’s” back in March 2017 


 
Management 
Steve Burns started off Lordstown by pulling the same move he did in past companies and bringing some 
very loyal former co-workers with him including – Julio Rodriguez – Former CFO & CIO of Workhorse.  
You know a CFO is well trained when he started his career off in the Latin America office at Arthur 
Andersen (famous for the Enron Scandal) and then was a Director of Finance at Chiquita Banana (famous 
for price fixing). The new senior employees that have come over from real auto manufacturers are going 
to face some surprises. They will need to develop a brand new EV truck with no defensible IP in a 55 year 
old plant that was set up to produce passenger vehicles. But at least unlike Workhorse’s Union City 
Assembly plant this one included some robots.

Inconsistencies have already begun and Lordstown is not even public yet: 
 
Steve burns has managed to set a new low bar we have never seen in our long investing career.  This is 
the first time we have seen a company start running a stock promotion before it was officially public. 


His very first investor presentation was already filled with some “inconsistencies” regarding his 
competition. 


In one of the only investor documents available Lordstown starts off the mirage comparing the Lordstown 
Endurance (a Fleet vehicle) vs the F-150 (Lariat, a higher-end personal vehicle) showing an impressive 
$19,000 savings.  The only problem is that fleets that buy ford usually buy F-150 XL which costs $29k or 
the Ford F-150 XLT $35k. The average fuel cost is also over-embellished, with a $2800 annual fuel cost 
vs (Google suggesting it should be $1500). Adjusted for the changes, the LMC Endurance turns out to be 
~$10,000 more expensive.   


Ford is also launching an electric truck that is expected to arrive in mid-2022 4 years, 2 years, now 
1 year after the Endurance was supposed to launch.  We think the public will get their hands on the 
Ford EV long before Lordstown’s is actually available 


Regarding Steve Burn’s founded company (Workhorse)“[if you] are thinking they are going to become 
another Ford motor company or General Motors, then you’re sadly mistaken because I don’t see that 
kind of [engineering] talent there.” 


We agree that Steve has never been a magnet for engineering. This is primarily because it seems that his 
“trade secrets” might be issuing equity to hopeful investors combined with stock promotions like the ones 
on YouTube currently promoting Lordstown Motors & DPHC. 


Be careful if you are tempted to invest in Lordstown Motors.  There is potential risk that major funding 
partners (GM, Wellington, Fidelity, etc) pull out or delay funding the deal once they read up more Steve 
Burn’s history or watch some of his stock promoter interviews. This happened the other day to Nikola 
with GM. (GM extends Nikola Talks) 


Lordstown Motors and Steve Burns are betting on Lordstown’s existence and local Ohio jobs on an 
untested new motor succeeding at mass scale and production.  The hub motor might work but we doubt 
Steve Burns who after 10 years of running an EV company still can’t engineer a working parking break 
will be able accomplish it.

True irony: even if Lordstown is successful Workhorse fails:  


Q) Is there any way that workhorse could actually win the USPS contract or part of it?  
A) Hmm..maybe If everybody else gave up on the project...[Workhorse] might be the 
last company standing and then Post Office might say, well, you know what, we got 


to have a new vehicle, so we have to use them.   
~A Knowledgeable Source  


 
Our competitor calls, on-site due diligence, customer research, and our source intimately familiar with the 
USPS bid all point to one fact. If Workhorse somehow won even part of the USPS contract then they do 
not have the facilities, equipment, or expertise to fulfill it according to USPS requirements and 
expectations. 


Workhorse has actually admitted to its inadequacies in being able to fulfill the USPS contract via their 
deal with Lordstown Motors. They effectively are disclosing that Workhorse will need to outsource its 
manufacturing to the newly formed Lordstown Motors in the unlikely event they win part of the USPS 
bid.  Unsurprisingly when pouring through the Workhorse-Lordstown agreement  (10-k exhibit 10.41 pg 
4) we also found a clause in the contract that would strip any positive economics away from 
Workhorse in favor of Lordstown:   


2.3.3. USPS Manufacturing.  


“If Licensor (Workhorse) is selected by the USPS to manufacture the NGDV under the USPS Next Generation Vehicle Production 
Program, Licensor will provide Licensee (Lordstown Motors) a right to bid for the contract manufacture of such vehicle and 
will negotiate the terms of such contract manufacturing agreement in good faith with Licensee for a period of no less than thirty (30) 
days. If Licensee submits a proposal to contract manufacture the NGDV that is less favorable than an alternative, binding proposal 
to contract manufacture the NGDV submitted by a third party, Licensor will provide Licensee a single additional opportunity to 
resubmit its proposal to match the most favorable binding proposal received by Licensor” 


Given all we have heard about USPS’s detailed due diligence we doubt they would miss all the facts that 
show that the VT Hackney-Workhorse bid does not have the manufacturing capacity to fulfill their 
contract. 


As a reminder Workhorse’s prototype truck part costs amount to at least $256,000 in parts alone before 
labor (according to our source) for a $35,000 truck.  At -631% per unit estimated Gross Margins it is no 
wonder Workhorse is focused drumming up hype with stock promotions rather than on upgrading their 
facilities or fulfilling customer contracts.

Conclusion – Short Workhorse Group 


 “Would you invest in Workhorse?”  


 “Umm, No, not if I valued my Money” 
- A Knowledgeable Source  





Workhorse’s story of winning the USPS NGDV bid as well as the hope of mass production for major 
customers like DHL, FedEx and UPS has now been proven to be substantially false. 


• We presented new information from VT Hackney, Workhorse’s well-regarded business partner, 
showing the expected value of USPS bid is immaterial and so at most $19m. 


• Unearthed never before seen evidence & sources proving that Workhorse’s poor design and 
manufacturing led to numerous critical failures in their prototype USPS trucks.  Virtually all the 
parts of the truck failed!  From the engines to the brakes.  Their motors, batteries, suspensions and 
even the doors and critical failures. 


• Investigated Workhorse’s facilities to see if they had the ability to fulfill the USPS contract.  
There we learned that they were not currently fulfilling orders and instead were creating “Show-
trucks” and “Prototypes.”  


• Major customers must have experienced the same quality issues and failures that we unearthed 
with the USPS prototypes.  Why else would they have quietly erased all mention of their once 
promising partnerships with Workhorse? Not only have customers stopped reordering trucks but 
they even stopped taking fulfillment on orders from years ago. 


“What valuation would you invest in Workhorse?”  


 “If it were my money, I would stay away from them period…my money 
would not be going to them at any valuation” 


- Management at a well-regarded EV Competitor 





In our experience it’s always the best idea to listen to industry experts.  And in the case of Workhorse the 
people most familiar with their business and intellectual property would not invest at any valuation.  
We agree and are short Workhorse because this poorly hand-made stock promotion is about to collapse. 


If you own shares of Workhorse after reading all of our findings we suggest you should follow the NGDV 
postal worker’s example and “dive to safety” before the USPS NGDV bid’s real winner is officially 
announced and Workhorse’s stock crashes.

Appendix A – Workhorse, Lordstown Motor’s & Competitors IP for fellow 
Patent Geeks: 
Comparing compared Workhorse’s patents against a private peer: 


• Motiv Power Systems is one of Workhorse’s key peers (self-disclosed by Workhorse itself), with 
a far superior portfolio of vehicle IP: all of Motiv’s vehicle patents relate to either vehicle 
electrification specifically, or to broader EV application – only one of Workhorse’s patents is 
truly EV related and there is another we categorize as somewhat related. 


• Motiv’s portfolio is also exclusively composed of utility rather than design patents that have a far 
greater hurdle  


• The major difference between the two, is the 40x premium ascribed to Workhorse’s valuation

Workhorse’s only true  EV patent 2 - Onboard generator drive system for electric vehicles (US9481256B2) 28 


• Filed 2014, granted 2016, expires May 5, 2035 
• This invention relates to a method and a system for the operation and charging of the batteries of an electric 


vehicle (EV) 
• A method and system according to embodiments of this invention provide for an extended range option for 


electric vehicles utilizing an internal combustion engine to drive the vehicle's main electric drive system in 
the regeneration mode and to charge the main battery when the vehicle is stopped. 


• This invention in various embodiments utilizes the electric vehicle's main drive controller and motor as the 
generator to recharge the main battery module when the vehicle is stopped via a clutch mechanism 
allowing the motor to act as a generator while the vehicle is at rest 


• As the vehicle is stopped and in park, the main battery is recharged to a computed SOC from the main drive 
motor and controller acting as a generator powered by the internal combustion engine, so as to allow the 
vehicle to complete its daily drive cycle while not allowing the battery to go below a desired SOC

Appendix B-4 – Creation of a Youtube Stock Promoter: 
Account: Learn Your Money:   
Person: “Coleman Costello Jr” (aka “Cully Jr” + his dog named Lloyd) 
History: First video was released 6 months ago (March 7, 2020) turned Stock Promoter (Sept 17, 2020) 
 
The first video was review of “Milwaukee Hole Hawg review after 3 years” It is a brushless drill and he 
gives a honest review. Over the next 6 months creates 17 videos of various product reviews like: 


• Airpods,  
• Cellphone,  
• Sunglasses  
• And videos of his dog Llyod who apparently ate his airpods from the earlier review.  


 
All the videos feature no editing & appear to be taken on a cellphone.  
 
April 12, 2020 - Debuts a nicely edited & better scripted video promoting the Acorns App -  How To 
Save Money With Acorns invest app (Acorns review) 
 
Fast forward 5 months and Cully Jr launches full steam into what appears to be illegal Stock Promotion! 
 
“Cully Jr’s” first ever investment idea is of course a SPAC. “Cully Jr” clearly didn’t even know what a 
SPAC was when he started reading the script since starts by telling us that he has been a long-term 
investor in LCA, which is obviously impossible, because it’s a SPAC!  Note - LCA’s history as a SPAC 
is that it was announced on May 2018 and then they first announced the Golden Nugget Target June 29th 
(link). 
 
Sept 17, 2020 – “Lca stock (Gnog) Golden nugget online gaming stock”. 
Sept 20, 2020 – “Cleanspark stock (Clsk) Why We Need Microgrids” 
Sept 21, 2020 – “How To sell Put Options For Passive Income” 
Sept 22, 2020 – “Chargepoint stock (SBE);” 
Sept 23, 2020 – “Churchill Capital (CCXX)” 
Sept 24, 2020 – Lordstown Motors Stock (DPHC) DiamondPeak Holdings  
Sept 25, 2020 – Opendoor Stock IPO (IPOB)  
“How to Sell Covered Call Options For Passive Income (options for beginners)”  
Sept 27, 2020 – “YOTTA SAVINGS (WHAT IS YOTTA SAVINGS) BIG INTEREST SAVINGS 
ACCOUNT !!!”

Appendix B-5) Additional Stock Promotions – 
InvestorsPlace.com 
We suspect that Investor Place Media LLC (InvestorPlace.com) is also acting as a stock 
promoter for both Workhorse Group as well as Lordstown Motors. We cannot confirm that they 
are being paid for this service primarily because when we called and asked them to send us their 
disclosures they refused to. Instead customer service reps kept pointing us to a link citing to call 
the phone number “1-800-219-8592” that we had already called, 
https://investorplace.com/corporate/disclosures-disclaimers/  Their website has incomplete and 
insufficient disclosures that only mention that the author of the piece does not hold a position in 
the stock.

Appendix C: Transcripts & Other Photos from Investigator 
Site Visits  
Our investigators visited Workhorse’s 2 facilities (Union City, Indiana & Loveland, Ohio) multiple times 
and as a reminder we found: 


• NO AUTOMATION or NO AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY – Workhorse employees invited a 
friendly stranger through their open assembly plant doors (Union City) & into their R&D Facility 
(Loveland) to see Workhorse’s “proprietary” hand-made production line  


• NO SECURITY – No front security guard anytime we visited and didn’t even bother to close the 
Gate. Who is guarding all the  “IP” & “Trade-Secrets”  


• “SHOW TRUCKS”/ “PROTOTYPES” – Employees at Union City referred to the trucks there as 
show trucks.  


Union City, Indiana September 2020 Plant Visit 
 
Investigator: [Drove on location mid-morning - the security booth out front was not manned and there was a sign that read "Security in Main 
Lobby," the gate was open and unattended; Visitor/main lot for office-looking building had almost full lot of 30-40 cars. Driving around back 
towards the production warehouse, there were a few UPS vehicles parked outside behind dumpsters in tall grass but no other EVs were visible 
anywhere on the complex – no ready to deliver vehicles, found] 
 
[Parked at the large open area by the production warehouse, encountered 4 workers by a small pickup truck (not an EV); they were loading some 
unknown materials using a forklift.] 
Investigator: Some small talk conversation, then: How many people are on site here? What kind of production are you doing? 
Employee: Don't really know... 
Investigator: Oh, how long have you been here? 
Employee: A few years 
Investigator: Well do you guys make trucks here or is that in Loveland? 
Employee: They do the older truck in Loveland, we do the new one here. 
Investigator: Well what do you do here then? 
Employee: Materials [didn't seem too interested in talking] 
Investigator: Got it, well I was hoping to talk to someone about job opportunities - saw you're hiring, anyone I could talk to, you think? 
Employee: Go in there and ask them [Pointed me towards bay door open on the far right] 
 
[Inside the Assembly Plant - there was an office-like booth with glass walls on the right hand side, to the left of me were three or four unmarked 
white vehicles that looked like they could currently be being developed. Began speaking with two employees inside] 
Investigator: Hey, the guys out there said I should check over here - I heard there's a lot of hiring going on, anyone I can talk to about that? 
Employee 1: Yeah we're hiring, she's probably better to talk to. 
Investigator: [Introduced myself] 
Investigator: So how long have you been here? You like it? 
Employee: About 3 years, yeah it's good. 
Investigator: Are there good benefits? 
Employee: Well, I wouldn't know about that since I don't get those. 
Investigator: So are there jobs right now, what's the best way to go about this? Is it here or in Cincinnati? 
Employee: [Gave me a paper application] And said I can bring it back if I like. Asked where I'm located. 
Investigator: [ redacted  ] 
Employee: Yeah you could do either location then... 
Investigator: Are those trucks for a particular customer? 
Employee: No those are just show units 
Investigator: What does that mean like they are prototypes? 
Employee: Yeah they're not production [it seemed like the implication was no other trucks are being assembled anywhere] 
Investigator: Are you making any production units for customers right now? 
Employee: No not right now 
Investigator: Is this the only facility where you make units or if there's another one on site? 
Employee: No this is the only production line 
Investigator: How many of them they make in a week or a month 
Employee: These are just the show units so they're not really doing that 
Investigator: Could I see more is there a line? This is really interesting... 
Employee: No, not really... in fact you're not even supposed to be here... 
Investigator: Oh ok, well thanks - by the way what's your email? 
Employee: [Writes email on sticky note it has a @workhorse.com address and hands to me with a job application] 
Investigator: Exited and drove off-site.

Loveland, Ohio Investigator Visit Sept-2020 


[Walked up to Loveland facility] 
 
Investigator: What's going on, what are you photographing? 
Employee: We're doing some construction here, going to be hiring more soon. 
Investigator: Oh wow, that's great - what kind of work are you hiring for? 
Employee: Mainly accounting, procurement, and operations right now. 
Investigator: How many people are you bringing on? 
Employee: I think we're looking to bring on hundreds. 
Investigator: That's great, what's all that for? 
Employee: Well we're expanding here a bit, we do most of our production line work at another facility and engineering, marketing, sales is all 
here - but we may start to do more production here too. 
Investigator: The other facility does all the production then? What are they building there? 
Employee: The EVs are all made there right now. 
Investigator: Ah yeah that makes sense, how fast do they make them there? Are they running a lot of shifts? 
Employee: Right now they can do about 5 a week up there, we're going to do more shifts. 
Investigator: That's pretty cool - who's buying these then? 
Employee: Well, we have FedEx right here and they have 2 trucks (points to a FedEx lot down the street). Then UPS, Ryder, DHL... 
Investigator: How many does UPS have? 
Employee: About 40 trucks (Investigator note: He mumbled so not 100% sure on this) 
Investigator: That's amazing, sounds like a lot of interesting work is being done. I actually found you guys on LinkedIn, said you were hiring and 
I wanted to come check it out since I'm curious. 
Employee: Oh sure, here let me see who we can find inside.  
 
[Uses his keycard to open secure front door and invites me in, walks me through towards large ware-house like room with team of 5-7 people 
working on rear engine/axle/frame for the new engine they are building now. Sitting next to it is an engine model] 
 
Investigator: So this is the actual electric motor? 
Employee: This is our old one, does about 100 miles of range, new one is much smaller. We limit it (new one) to about 60-65% of its torque 
capability otherwise it would just snap the axle. It's also much lighter than the old one. 
Investigator: That's so cool [takes out phone to take photo] 
Employee: Oh you can't take photos here... well you can of the old one. 
Investigator: [Takes photo of old engine] 
Employee: Here you can see more in the back room.  
 
[Takes me to another room in back where we see a UPS branded brown vehicle, a white unbranded and exterior unfinished looking vehicle he 
claims is a new model, and a nicely painted and finished looking red vehicle he said is also the same as the white one but smaller and used as a 
showcase] 
Investigator: These are great, can I take a photo? 
Employee: Yeah sure. 
Investigator: So who's going to buy all these? How many can you make? 
Employee: Well, UPS and Ryder... USPS has been looking too. 
Investigator: When they buy do they do a big purchase or a small proof of concept first? You said FedEx has only 2 trucks? Why not more? 
Employee: Yeah they do a big order usually, and then we supply a smaller amount for them to start using and testing and then we can 
make changes. We've built about 400 trucks. 
Investigator: So what if you got an order for like 1,000, could you build those fast enough? 
Employee: [Laughs] Hah, well that's the question isn't it! 
Investigator: I heard there was another facility when I did some reading, another factory that starts with an 'L' I think? 
Employee: Ah yeah that's Lordstown. They used to build the Chevy Cruze there. It's another company leasing some of our technology. 
Investigator: Is that an area you would do some more production if you needed to? 
Employee: Yeah I think so, but really most of the production line is in Union City. 
Investigator: Is it manual or automated? Here looks like everything is manual? 
Employee: Here it's all manual, but there it's all in a production line. 
Investigator: So there's automation there? 
Employee: No, it's still manual, but it's more of a process there, here is more R&D.  
 
[Starts to walk me to another part of the building towards the back, this area seems to have only one employee back here and a few drones. A 
couple quadrocopter and a few hexocopters on the wall, the quad looks to be built of all carbon fiber and is about 4' wide and 3' tall] 
 
Employee: So we're also building drones - no photos back here - for more rural areas a truck could send a package on a drone for the last mile or 
two while it continues to the next location, then the drone comes back to the truck. We first tried these drones [points to the hexocopter] and 
found it had too much surface area so any wind over 5mph would be too much for it, this drone [quadcopter] is much lighter and works better. 
Investigator: Are you hiring engineers for drone development too? [note that there is only one other guy in the room, it's mid-afternoon so seems 
unlikely they're at lunch] 
Passerby Employee 2: Yeah we're hiring for this. 
Employee: What kind of engineer are you? 
Investigator: Computer and Electrical, so I think this is really interesting. 
Employee: [walks me back out towards the main large warehouse room where the original 5-7 people were working on an engine in a frame] 
Investigator: So is this area usually more full or is this normal?

Employee: Well we used to do the harness work here too, we have over 44 harnesses in the trucks, but now we outsource that. 
Investigator: Outsource like to another company, not something you make in Union City? 
Employee: Right, another external company. 
Investigator: So is everyone excited by all this? Are people liking it all? 
Employee: Yeah people are pretty excited, we are doing more hiring now for everything. 
Investigator: How many people have you brought on lately? 
Employee: About 12 I think? 
Employee: There's an engineer here you could talk to - [Walks me closer to the exit and the group of young engineers make a joke about 
determining the right amount of torque for a nut to be tightened - they seemed to be defining it] 
Investigator: [ ]  this has been incredibly helpful thanks so much for sharing, I actually have to head out but I will definitely apply - this is 
exciting. Do you have a card on you or your email by chance? 
Employee: Sure here's my card. 
Investigator: Thanks again, have a good day! [exit] 
 
[Overall we spoke for about 20 min while he walked me through the facility]
