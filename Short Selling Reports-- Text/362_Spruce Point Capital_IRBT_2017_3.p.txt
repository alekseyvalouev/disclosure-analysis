Why SharkNinja/Ecovacs Entering Vacuum Robotics Would Pose
20%-50% Downside Risk To iRobot
Jun. 27, 2017 12:51 PM ET61 comments
by: Ben Axler


Summary


With iRobot’s share price now +300% since 2016, investors are cheering the re-
acceleration of sales and earnings growth following years of disappointment, and
ascribing a peak valuation to plateauing EPS.


We expect SharkNinja to launch a competing product at lower price points.
SharkNinja outsold Dyson to claim market share in traditional vacuums and will
partner with China robotics leader Ecovacs.


iRobot's recent patent defense strategy and acquisition of its Japanese distributor
are defensive moves. Irreconcilable financial control issues are again surfacing at
iRobot; investors should tread carefully.


Robot is trading at a peak valuation and 30% above its average analyst price target
of $77. Many of its long-term fundamental investors have been selling. Insiders also
have been heavy sellers before its recent share price increase. Its valuation dwarfs
best of breed technology consumer companies such as Apple. If iRobot were to
trade closer to peers and its long-term valuation at  3x - 4x book value and 1.5x –
2.5x sales, we could see 20% – 50% downside risk.


Spruce Point Capital Management is pleased to issue a critical update report and alert our
readers it has re-established a short position in iRobot (Nasdaq: IRBT) as a result of our
industry research that suggests SharkNinja and Ecovacs, two widely successful
companies in vacuums and robotics may enter the market as earlier as Q4. In addition, we
have new evidence to suggest financial irregularities tied to iRobot's acquisition of its
related-party distributor. We believe there is 20% - 50% downside risk potential. Please
review our disclaimer at the bottom of this email. We also encourage all of our readers to
follow us on Twitter@sprucepointcap for regular updates.


I. Executive Summary


In May 2014, Spruce Point made its first short recommendation on iRobot, noting
fundamental struggles, signs of channel stuffing, and bad governance practices. We
later pointed to struggles to penetrate the Chinese market in Sept 2014. For the

following 2 years, iRobot’s share price languished and significantly
underperformed the Nasdaq technology index. A majority of our criticisms and
forecasts proved accurate.
With iRobot’s share price now up 300% since 2016, investors are cheering the re-
acceleration of sales and earnings growth following years of disappointment, and
ascribing a peak valuation to plateauing earnings. Spruce Point believes the financial
improvement reflects temporary factors and may not be sustainable. We expect new
competition to storm the market, and challenge iRobot’s US market share dominance.
iRobot’s recent financial performance reflects restocking of its supply chain after years
of false starts, the removal of the struggling military business, and the acquisition boost
from its Japanese distributor. We believe these factors will create very difficult
comparisons for iRobot to lap in the future, and create headwinds for future share price
appreciation. Furthermore, we believe recent gains are a result of lowering the price of
its Roomba to move down market, which we believe is a long-term negative on
margins for a technology hardware company with a narrow product focus
Investors are overlooking disruptive competition likely to enter iRobot’s US market.
Based on Spruce Point field research, we expect SharkNinja to launch a competing
product at lower price points. SharkNinja outsold Dyson to claim market share in
traditional vacuums. We believe they will partner with Ecovacs, the leader in the
Chinese/Asia market which stole significant market share from iRobot. SharkNinja has
a proven track record of disrupting numerous home appliance markets with dynamic
market strategies, and superior products. With 88% US market share, iRobot’s share
can only go down from here
Investors are overlooking financial control issues tied to iRobot’s recent acquisition of
its Japanese distributor. The Company suspiciously retracted certain statements made
about Japanese sales growth (reversing big gains to declines), and made revenue and
earnings revisions which don’t add up. Spruce Point has previously pointed out early
warning signs at Sabre (acquired its Asia distribution partner Abacus) and
Caesarstone (acquired its US distribution partner), ahead of financial problems
surfacing. Market observers will also note that Valeant’s option to buy its distributor
Philidor opened Pandora’s Box and was the canary in the coal mine
iRobot is trading at a peak valuation and 30% above its average analyst price target of
$77. Many of its long-term fundamental investors have been selling, while retail and
index funds buy. Insiders also have been heavy sellers before its recent share price
increase. Its valuation dwarfs best of breed technology consumer companies such as
Apple. If iRobot were to trade closer to peers and its long-term valuation at 3x - 4x
book value and 1.5x – 2.5x sales, we could see 20% – 50% downside risk

Timeline of Recent Events Affecting iRobot Since Our Reports in 2014:


2014-2015: iRobot misses revenue and earnings expectations multiple times after our
report’s warning


April 2015: iRobot attracts the attention of another activist investment firm who wagers a
proxy fight, criticizing the Company’s poor capital allocation and governance


Feb 2016: Under pressure, iRobot sells its struggling defense and security business and
has received just $23m in cash; the Company expands its share repurchase program by
$100m


March 2016: Repurchases $85m of its $100m through an accelerated share repurchase
Oct 2016: Raises guidance for second time, backs view of 15% consumer revenue growth


Nov 2016: Pursues inorganic growth by acquiring its Japanese distributor Sales on
Demand Corp for ~$18m


Feb 2017: Offers 2017 guidance of 17-19% revenue growth, but EPS to a wide range of
-9% to +11%; restates earnings transcript to correct gross mischaracterization of
Japanese performance +20% to -17%


April 2017: Raises top end of 2017 revenue and EPS range by just $5m and 0.05c,
respectively. Revises Japanese distributor contribution. After years of promoting the value
of its intellectual property, iRobot finally filed ITC Patent infringement complaint against
robotic vacuum cleaner products sold by Bissell, Hoover and Black and Decker covering 6
patents


A Majority of Spruce Point’s iRobot Concerns Have Proven Accurate

II. SharkNinja and Ecovacs: Roomba’s New Competitive Threat


SharkNinja, headquarted in Newton MA fifteen miles from iRobot, is an innovative
consumer home appliance company that has disrupted markets it enters with high
performance products, at affordable price points. Shark Ninja is a leader in vacuums and
blenders, and targets consumers through infomercials. Based on our research, we believe
they will enter the robotic vacuum market and challenge iRobot


From an article by Forbes entitled “ How Shark Ate Dyson’s Lunch In America” –
Dec 2014


Formerly known as Euro-Pro, a 100-year old company that had a mere 1% of vacuum
cleaner sales in 2008, SharkNinja now controls more than 20% of the US market
Over the past seven years, its Shark vacuum cleaners and Ninja blenders and food
processors, all manufactured in China, have increased sales at a compound annual
growth rate of 25%, enabling the firm to triple its workforce from 250 to 800 employees
This growth has been aided by an aggressive push on television shopping channels,
with $130m spent on TV advertising last year (examples: 1, 2, 3)
The Company has doubled revenues from $800 million to more than $1.6 billion and
usurped Dyson as leader of the US vacuum cleaner market since bringing in
consultants Gap International two years ago

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4084237-sharkninja-ecovacs-entering-vacuum-robotics-pose-20-percentminus-50-percent-downside-risk 5/31


Channel checks show SharkNinja already has key distribution partners: Home
Depot (HD), Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY), Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco
(COST), Best Buy (BBY) and Many More


These key distribution outlets overlap with many of iRobot’s existing distribution
partners
In addition, SharkNinja is known for its extensive infomercials and television
advertising. The Forbes article says it spent $130m on TV advertising, whereas iRobot
spent just $64.4m on advertising in 2016 (not all TV)


Shark Ninja Recently Hired Goldman Sachs To Evaluate A Sale According To
Reuters (April 2017)


Sources suggest that private equity firms have expressed the most interest in
SharkNinja
Given that PE firms are financially motivated to grow their investments to achieve
15%+ p.a. returns, a financial buyer would be incentivized to grow SharkNinja through
product and market expansion


Our Field Research on SharkNinja’s Robotic Vacuum Ambitions


We believe SharkNinja strives to be the #1 or #2 leader in markets it enters. Based on
its track record in traditional vacuums and blenders, we believe SharkNinja is a
credible threat to iRobot
SharkNinja’s displacement of Dyson in vacuums was a result of a laser-like focus on
the consumer, and its ability to engineer a superior product at a value price point. As
an organization, Linkedin data shows that SharkNinja employs more engineers than
sales or marketing people
We believe Dyson failed to gain traction with its robotic vacuum because its price point
of >$1,000 was simply too high, and it did not deliver meaningful performance
advantage to the customer. Simply stated, Dyson could not offer a compelling value
proposition
We believe SharkNinja will use a similar strategy it used to displace Dyson with its go
to market with iRobot – deliver a high performing product at a lower price point, in this
case in the $299 - $399 price range
Given SharkNinja’s marketing prowess stated to be $130m annually (2014 figures), we
wouldn’t be surprised to see it spend at least 10% or more to broaden product
awareness

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4084237-sharkninja-ecovacs-entering-vacuum-robotics-pose-20-percentminus-50-percent-downside-risk 6/31


SharkNinja has many existing relationships with retailers such as Target (TGT),
Walmart (WMT), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Best Buy (BBY) and Costco (COST).
We would not be surprised if they leverage these relations to distribute their robotic
vacuum in addition to infomercial marketing
Our research suggests that SharkNinja will partner with Ecovacs, the leading Chinese
robotics maker and company that has gained significant share against iRobot in China


SharkNinja Commands Significant Shelf Space At Leading Retailers


It’s easy to see why retailers would want SharkNinja to enter the vacuum robotics
market. Its current vacuums and blenders command significant shelf space and are
very popular with customers.


Retailers Preparing To Shrink iRobot Shelf Space


Two of our recent site visits demonstrated a disregard for iRobot’s shelf space and
proper product display. Is this indicative of retailers preparing to reduce its shelf
space?

SharkNinja Just Filed a Robotic Vacuum Patent, Before iRobot’s Patent Defense
Campaign


SharkNinja’s filing of a robotic vacuum patent in April 2017 has gone unnoticed by sell-
side analysts and investors, but Spruce Point believes it is a significant indicator of
SharkNinja’s ambition to leverage its success in traditional vacuums to compete in
home vacuum robotics.
Coincidentally iRobot announced its patent complaints two days earlier on April 18,
2017 against Bissell, Hoover, b0bsweep, iLife, Black& Decker and three Asian
companies. In our opinion, we believe IRBT’s recent patent claims are defensive, and
it is clearly worried about its competitive position

Ecovacs Has Grown Market Share Against IRBT in Asia, Now Expanding Into the US


Ecovacs is an Asian market leader in home robotics, that has taken significant share
from iRobot, and is taking clear steps to invade iRobot’s US market share. An IPO will
raise capital and give it a public currency to continue its market share gains. We
believe SharkNinja will partner with Ecovacs
Aug 2016: ECOVACS plans to introduce seven new home cleaning robots in the US in
2016: five clean bare-floors and carpets, and two wipe glass doors and clean windows
Feb 2017: Ecovacs Expands U.S. Footprint, Smart Home Technology; as part of its
continuing global expansion plan, Ecovacs Robotics will move into its new 3,000-
square-foot North American headquarters in San Francisco. The location of the new
headquarters itself was chosen with the company’s expansion plans in mind and in
large part due to its growing focus on smart home technology development.

Recent iRobot Performance A Result of Going Down Market, Deflating Prices


Based on our field research, we believe that iRobot has experienced the greatest

get market share gains
The pricing data below confirms our field research that. In the long run, we view this as
a negative that iRobot, retailer of a hardware consumer product, has to erode its brand
value by lower prices
We expect margin pressure to result in the coming quarters, especially because iRobot
has no more meaningful product introductions planned for next year

iRobot Appears To Be Obfuscating Its Price Deflation


Look carefully at iRobot’s “Supplemental Information” at the bottom of its recent press
releases and you will notice they stopped providing “ average gross selling prices for
consumer robots” – Is iRobot trying to obfuscate its price deflation?

iRobot Is Now Cutting Prices of Its High End New Roomba Product


The Company often promotes its latest iteration of essentially the same Roomba

980 starting at $899
iRobot said in Q1 that“ The $40.6 million increase in revenue from our consumer

III. Warning Signs From Recent Japanese Distributor Acquisition


Investors would be well cautioned to closely evaluate iRobot’s acquisition of Sales on
Demand Corp, its related-party Japanese distributor
There are numerous examples of early warning signs when companies acquire their
distribution partners or related-party entities.


New Signs Suggesting IRBT Is Gaming The Financials From Its Distributor
Acquisition


Notice That IRBT’s CFO Issues Corrective Statements About Japan’s Performance in
Q4’16:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4084237-sharkninja-ecovacs-entering-vacuum-robotics-pose-20-percentminus-50-percent-downside-risk 13/31


Original CFO Comment on Japan( Q4’16): “Austin just to circle back on your initial
question on Japan and China in the fourth quarter, so without getting too specific, Japan
was up probably about 20% in the fourth quarter year-on-year and China’s a fairly difficult
comp just based on the timing both last year and this year. So don’t read too much in to
this, but it was over 200% growth in the fourth quarter on China. But again we encourage
everybody to really focus on the full year growth rates for all of those regions versus Q4
specifically.”


Revised CFO Comment on Japan ( Q4’16): “Austin just to circle back on your initial
question on Japan and China in the fourth quarter, so without getting too specific, Japan
was [down 17%] (corrected by company after the call) in the fourth quarter year-on-
year [because we wanted to make sure the channels were clear ahead of our
acquisition and China was down 50% from Q4 last year as expected. As you may
recall we received an $11M order in Q3 2016 from China that we were expecting in Q4 so
China was up 140% in Q3 and then down year-over-year in Q4] (corrected by company
after the call). But again we encourage everybody to really focus on the full year growth
rates for all of those regions versus Q4 specifically.”


Then Following Quarter (Q1’17): “We have reduced our Japan expectations versus those
provided in February due to our analysis of inventory at retailers in Japan at the end of
Q1, which was higher than we would typically like to see. We have lowered the level of
incremental revenue post acquisition as we work through this channel inventory.


Revision of Deal Terms and Financials Suggest More Inventory Acquired: The
purchase price of the acquisition increased from earlier estimates. The purchase
price is mostly inventory. The higher the purchase price, the more inventory
acquired.


11/21/16 (press release): iRobot will acquire the business for a cash amount equal to the
book value of the acquired assets at close, primarily inventory, estimated to be between
$14m-$16m, subject to exchange rates in effect on the date of acquisition.


5/5/17 (Q1’10Q): On April 3, 2017, the Company closed its previously-announced
acquisition of the iRobot-related distribution business of Sales On Demand Corporation for
approximately $18 million in cash, equal to the book value of the acquired assets. The
acquisition price is subject to adjustments and will be finalized no later than May 18, 2017.


Why does IRBT need 6 months to accurately account for and value inventory it acquired
from its distributor? How hard is it to count the number of unsold Roombas sitting in a
warehouse and at retailers?

Financial Impact Revision From Distributor Acquisition Very Questionable


Original sales increase from Japanese acquisition of $20-$25m and ($0.25) to ($0.35)
EPS dilution (Q4’16 Press Release)
Later sales cut in half to $10-$12m and loses double ($0.50) to ($0.60) (Q1’17 Press
Release)
The distributor acquisition closed on schedule, yet is now expected to have a negative
contribution to Q2? IRBT says it has to sell through acquired inventory.


iRobot’s Japanese forecasts simply aren’t adding up.


Recall that it revised its sales contribution from $20 - $25m to $10 - $12m between
Q4’16 and Q1’17.
This revision amounts to between $10 - $13m lower sales
However, based on previous statements noted below made directly from management
the expected revision should have been just $4.7m - $7.0m
Therefore, we believe this is irrefutable evidence of financial control issues

(1) Q4’17 Earnings Call: As our largest international market, Japan is estimated to
comprise roughly 15% of this year’s total revenue.


(2) Q1’17 Earnings Call: For the full year, we expect revenue in the U.S. to grow from 18%
to 20%, China and Japan to grow approximately 30% each, and EMEA to grow mid-teens
over 2016.


IV. iRobot’s Significant Overvalution and 20% - 50% Downside Risk Potential


IRBT At Irrational Premium To Price Targets, Recent Brokers Are Negative


iRobot is trading at 23% above the average analyst price target; what do current
investors know that its seasoned analysts don’t? We caution that Canaccord
downgraded IRBT recently from Buy to Hold


Cannacord 5/30/17: We are downgrading IRBT to HOLD from Buy following nearly a 70%
appreciation for the stock YTD, and 50% PE expansion on consensus NTM earnings.
While we remain positive on growth prospects for the company (healthy momentum in the
U.S. as connectivity is driven deeper into the Roomba portfolio and accelerating
international growth), we expect only modest upside to our estimates for the balance of
the year and see little additional room for valuation expansion from present all-time highs.
Further, the lack of a new flagship product in 2017 could heighten uncertainty ahead of the
holiday season and drive multiple compression. Our price target remains $90 and our
estimates are unchanged.

Peak Valuation For Fundamentally The Same Vacuum Company


Investors are ascribing a peak valuation to iRobot based on its recent renewed growth.
However, we believe there one-time factors aiding recent growth such as inventory
restocking, removal of the losing defense business from the financials, and the inclusion of
the Japanese distributor. Absent any new product drivers, iRobot will face significant year-
over-year comparison which will most certainly be difficult to achieve.

iRobot At An Irrational Premium To Peers


iRobot is best viewed as stagnant technology hardware company with limited growth
or innovation opportunities
As we’ve illustrated before, many of its previous product introductions such as health
telepresence or lawn robots have failed to gain traction.
For comparison, iRobot’s current valuation exceeds Apple (AAPL), which many would
argue is the primer consumer technology company
For investors that want exposure to home appliances and consumer products, we
believe Newell Brands (NWL), Whirlpool (WHR) and Spectrum Brands (SPB) are safer
bets
Our long-run base case view is that iRobot will be revalued in line with broken/faddish
technology companies such as GoPro (GPRO) and FitBit (FIT)

Excellent, well researched article. Only comment is that market won't cut IRBT multiple on Sharkninja entry until it
actually gains traction and takes some share from IRBT. Stock is at extremely lofty valuation for minor recent
outperformance vs. expectations.

In May 2014 we published a report on iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) entitled “iRobot: About to Short-Circuit,” in which we
warned investors that the company is being hyped and promoted as a must own stock to play a ‘robotics revolution,’
when in fact it appears to just be a maturing consumer product company under significant competitive pressures.

I stopped reading after I got to the "overvalued" and "insider selling" bits.


IRBT is overvalued, to be sure. But no more so that many other frothy tech or consumer electronic stocks. Of the 125
tech stocks in my "hi flyers" watchlist, 15% have even higher P/E's than IRBT.


Your insider selling rag is a bit disingenuous -- since Oct 16, a total of 270,000 shares have been sold by insiders, of
which 66% were auto sells. There were 2 discretionary sells at the top this month - the COO dumped 75,000 shares
at 100. I suspect he agrees the price has a little air in it.


And my favorite quote from your thesis: "For comparison, iRobot’s current valuation exceeds Apple (AAPL), which
many would argue is the primer consumer technology company..."


I have no position in IRBT. Wouldn't buy it, but I surely wouldn't short it based on this article.

Great short article! However you may be missing the bigger picture. RVC market has been projected to go from $1.5
Billion in 2016 to $2.5+ Billion in 2021 and CAGR of 15%. In 2016 irbt has demonstrated revenues of $660M a lion's
share of the market and only growing. A big IF but if Ecovacs & Shark Ninja can form a partnership they may take
some market share away from iRobot at the lower price points but the market is only going to continue to explode
where there can be many competing RVC companies thriving over the next decade. There will certainly be many
more RVC players coming into challenge IRBT but I believe for the next few years more and more people will
transition away from upright vacuums and go robotic as the tech improves and price points come down. Shark Ninja
isn't currently a threat and it would take many years beyond 2018 to get into the RVC business even with an Ecovacs

partnership it may also be the other way around where the upright vacuum cleaner is getting more and more obsolete
IF Shark Ninja can't successfully get into the RVC market their vacuum business may not survive in the longer term.


27 Jun 2017, 06:48 PM

Samuel - valid point with RVC growth. However, the overall vacuum has been a sub 7% market for years.
With the advances in robotics and vision learning, the space will become crowded with Chinese/traditional
players as the moats are not defensible. (Yes, IRBT is going to try to defend with IP litigation)


I think what the author is implying that Ecovacs has the technology and highly rated products and SharkN has
the distribution - this could get interesting really quick for IRBT.  
That said, I would want a clearer indication of the partnership than presented.


29 Jun 2017, 08:17 AM


samuel.rel
I don't know the exact percentage of the regional or global market for RVC household penetration but around
the high single digits seems reasonable. As you mentioned if we are only at 7% that's great news because
RVC's are still in the early adoption phase and will only explode once RVC hits the mass market phase. I own
2 RVC's a Neato and Roomba and the common sentiment by RVC owners is "why didn't I buy this sooner"
especially among pet owners that may need daily maintenance. Read a few online reviews on Amazon for
any RVC whether Neato, iRobot, Ecovacs, etc...and they all have very high ratings and reviews. Again I think
the pie will only get bigger where multiple RVC companies will thrive eventually with a handful of winners. As
far as Ecovacs + Sharkninja it sounds like a mutual beneficial partnership on the surface but who needs who
more and how are their lower price point and smaller margins going to be split? If Sharkninja parnters with
Ecovacs will their RVC sales start to cannibalize their own upright hand held vacuums? If I see a $200
Ecovacs RVC right next to a $200 Sharkninja upright I may go with the RVC for the same price with the
added benefit of not having to manually vacuum. I think Ecovacs is doing well on their own and if a
distribution channel is a primary benefit of partnering with Sharkninja well they already have one of the best
distribution partners called Amazon.


30 Jun 2017, 01:37 PM


YourOnlyHope
the 10% drop yesterday was your best chance to short. Article proved its worth. Long term I'm in agreement with
other posters. If and a big IF Shark Ninja can create a competing product that is comparable to IRBT then market
share % would obviously take a hit. Still Shark Ninja is most likely YEARS away from a comparable product.


I like the long term prospects of the RVC as a whole so losing market % doesn't necessarily mean lost revenue. Odds
are IRBT continues to be a solid long. I doubled my position this morning.

I agree IRBT is a long unless an economic downturn brings it down along with all other stocks. Any economic
recession people will not splurge on a robot vacuum for a few hundred bucks. However, if economy and markets keep
chugging along with increasing wages and higher disposable income sales will probably keep going up. I did like
Ben's article since it makes you think twice and re-evaluate a company when these days share prices of many tech
companies are at all time highs with lofty market cap valuations. I also don't blame any insiders for selling as
everyone including company execs have entry/exit points sometimes well in advance. We also need activist shorts to
bring some sanity back into the markets and help expose and reveal weaknesses (if any). For most authors here in
SA they have some agenda to sway their reader's opinion to influence some profit whether pumping up a stock or
shorting a stock and some really great contributors purely just to share their analysis as good will without any gains
from their work other than gaining the respect among their peers. But looking through the author's previous short
pieces with a common theme of 20%-60% downside risks many of the companies targeted have gains from single
digits with up to 156% gains (IRBT). Is Ben secretly long on all these companies hoping to push the price down to get
in at lower prices? Some of the examples of his articles published in the last year or two:


RLGT 30%-50% downside risk posted on SA 6/8/2017. Pre-article $6.06 post article $4.98 and currently the share
price is $5.74. So this one is down -5.3% so far but not nearly at the -30% downside.


WIX 50-60% downside risk posted on SA 4/19/2017. $69.70 pre-article and $68.90 post article and currently $72.70
for a gain +4.3%.


PTC 50-60% downside posted on SA 3/23/2017. $53.60 pre-article and $51.94 post article and currently $56.81 for a
+5.6% gain


MGPI 60-70% downside posted on SA 1/12/2017. $47.13 pre-article and 42.29 post article and currently $50.74 for a
+7.6% gain


BURL 20-40% downside posted on SA 11/3/2016. $72.61 pre-article and $69.24 post article and currently $91.15 for
a +25.5% gain


PLNT calls for $8 per share or 50% downside posted on SA 3/9/2016. $13.02 pre-article and $13.16 post article and
currently $23.95 for an +84% gain


iRobot Corp: About to short circuit posted on SA 5/20/2014. $36 pre-article, the lowest point ever reached since the
article $29.16 on 9/21/2015 currently after the recent and new IRBT short article currently $92.47 for a +156% gain


I think if the author's real strategy is to target rising stocks with some momentum with high valuations and short them,
a few days later post a short piece on SA influencing weak hands to sell, buy in at the lower share price, and then
cover the shorts and stay long. Rinse & Repeat then Ben is a genius! Unfortunately looking at some of the past
history many investors taking his advice at face value have probably suffered large losses. While missing out on a
generally rising market over the past few years.

governance? You fail to acknowledge that iRobot's share price was flat for two years after our initial report. Clearly,
institutional investors were underweight if not outright selling. The fact that the stock appreciated recently you can
partly link to our criticisms engendering another activist to come in and get iRBT to sell its struggling defense
business. None of this could have been foreseen from our initial report, which was based on everything we knew up
to that point in time.


I have yet to see anyone (including the company) refute that SharkNinja can enter the market and weigh on IRBT's
US market share. Furthermore, I've yet to see anyone explain management's unusual Japanese distributor financial
revisions.


28 Jun 2017, 05:33 PM


samuel.rel
True, I didn't review all of your articles as you mentioned and ECHO, SABR, CSTE overall look down. I was reviewing
your latest 4 or 5 articles and noticed many of them haven't panned out to be good shorts where you often have the
common headline of 30~60% drops. You're articles seem to be effective to temporarily bring down the stock price but
many of the companies you targeted have rallied back up. Congrats on irbt as it's down 15% from it's highs but
similarly with your other short pieces irbt may rally back up.


I'll have to look more into your reference to the unusual financial revisions with their Japanese distributor and I don't
have an opinion there yet. As far as Sharkninja entering the RVC market with a partnership with Ecovacs it seems like
Sharkninja needs Ecovacs more than Ecovacs needs Sharkninja. True, Ecovacs may benefit with Sharkninja's
established distribution channels but it seems Ecovacs already has one of the best distribution partners available
called Amazon! In addition Sharkninja should be careful not to cannibalize their own upright vacuum sales by
partnering with Ecovacs.

Irrespective of potential new competition, RVC growth is inherently limited because it serves as a secondary vacuum,
not primary. I believe penetration in the U.S. and Europe is easily above 15%, and significantly more penetration will
be hard to achieve due to the fact that it is not the primary vacuum in the household and IRBT's price point is much

4.3 Million shares short (16.4% of the float). Today's closing price of $87.90 to current after hours trading
$109 is a difference of about $21 bucks. 4.3 million shares short x $21 = $90.3M worth of shares that
someone has to come up with real fast. Management has been raising expectations each quarter for I think 7

I can't tell if you're genuinely interested in shorting and seeking Ben's advice or if you're being sarcastic...but
my attempt to answer is NO it's not a good time to short now because Q3 and Q4 are irbt's strongest
quarters.

Looks like the thesis failed to be held up because it ignored the Amazon factor. Too much emphasis on retail floor
space etc.. In the 90s products like this could be vultured but not sure IRBT fits in due to its tech and IP. Doubling up
at 90 was the best move I made all year.

Ben has been advocating shorting IRBT since the stock was in the low 30$ range. Whenever I ask for a simple
comment on why his thesis has failed so miserably over the last few years my comments get magically deleted. I'm
not sure if he is one of the moderators or sleeping with one of them ?

I actually sold today having bought IRBT at 16.00. I wish my best to IRBT and if the valuation ever comes back down
to reality I would buy again someday. A great company with a great leader. Good luck to all.

deferrals, tax reversals, etc. No wonder its EBIT and Cash Flow are declining along with its gross margins. It makes
sense its EPS is declining too while its products receive heavier competition

ULTI in Dec 2016 was around $180~$190 per share. Since that time had highs up to $220 and currently now
at around $200. Your article targets the $110-$146 price range and still not there...but yes time will tell but are
we looking at a 1 year time frame, 5 year, 10 year? Long-term patience is prudent but I'd be interested to see
a price target AND time frame. In a long enough time frame anyone can cherry pick certain drops or rises of a
stock to prove their point.


CSTE dropped by 50% soon after the short article and so have hit your target range. Since then it has been
hovering around $30~$40 and currently at about $30.


Your short article on IRBT was able to bring it down roughly 20% but soon after Q2 earnings shot back up to
$107. Q3 & Q4 will most likely be iRobots strongest quarters as well and so the market has probably already
factored that into the current share price. There will certainly be competitors and rumors of competitors but
until they can execute and actually start taking market share it's all short term swings.


Instead of leaving things open ended I think your readers/follwers would appreciate a target price AND a time
frame of when to cover the shorts? If not then you leave yourself & clients open to indefinite losses since

Ben, do you know if Ecovacs partnered with Shark Ninja or is their Shark ION 750 robot vacuum all on their own? I
think most people were aware of Shark Ninja launching an RVC but unclear if it was a partnership with Ecovacs as
your original article presumed.


Again there will be many new players getting into the RVC and Sharkninja is just another new one out of at least 8~10
I can think of in 2017 and probably more in 2018. The major well known brands being Neato, Samsung, iRobot that
will continue to introduce their latest and greatest. If you do a quick Amazon.com search for Robot Vacuums there are
some I've never heard of and time will tell on their ability to attract and retain customers: Clobot, VBOT, Mecco,
ETRobot, Deik. I think Xiaomi, Ecovacs, and Ilife are the ones gaining momentum as they have had some time in the
market and seem to have good reviews. As a consumer looking to buy an RVC in the 300~$500 range I'm still going
to lean toward the trusted and reputable brands. Around the $200 price point I may give one of the unknown brands a
try. Also if you look at some of the reviews on Amazon you have to be careful to distinguish the genuine honest
reviews vs. the paid or biased reviews that got a free robot for their review. I think we'll know after 6 months ~ 1 year if
the Shark ninja RVC is a threat. Similarly everyone was worried about Dyson's RVC and that fizzled out.

SharkNinja is no different than other robot vacuums that are already on the market. many internet reviews of
SharkNinja models indicate they are inferior to IRobot Roomba. I think IRobot will be somewhat like Apple vs Android
in cell phones. IRobot will keep high margins, and it will lose market share, but sales will increase at slower pace
because the pie is getting bigger. So was it overvalued? perhaps somewhat, but not what the author is suggestion.

Don and Jimmy both critical of the research, care to comment on your outlook?


25 Oct 2017, 05:28 PM


samuel.rel
Each side goes quiet when they are temporarily beat on price projections. It's been quite a ride and volatile for
sure and I've enjoyed some of these ups and downs as I've been able to get in on the dips. Ben after this
article IRBT shot back up past $100 to where you then posted in July to defend your position "Short selling
requires a long-term outlook and the ability to see through quarterly variations, which is why we do not believe
IRBT's last quarter changes our conviction that its business is under pressure"


Obviously someone going long on IRBT also can make the same claim now as the price is back down where
they have a long-term outlook and shouldn't be phased by quarterly variations. But my outlook is that IRBT
will have some more record revenues and EPS through Q4 2017 and 2018. For Q4 there are some major
sales events in both China, Europe, and US. Nov 11th (11/11) will be a huge sales day in China as it's the
equivalent to black Friday in the US. Then you have black Friday in the US after Thanksgiving, and then
further holiday sales around Christmas. Loaded up some more at $66 and would be surprised if IRBT does
NOT surpass $85 by Q4 earnings release and over $100 in 2018 even as there are more new competitors
and as the market gets saturated there will be further price points from low end, mid, and high end. IRBT
should still dominate the high end where you want to be in any market.

This is like saying that Apple iPhone buyers are suddenly going to switch to Walmart's cell phone or Tesla buyers are
going to buy the new Honda Fit instead or Dyson buyers are going to switch to Hoover. This is total nonsense. I have
owned a Roomba for years and I would never buy anything else. The iRobot products are vastly superior and iRobot
is going after patent cheats already.
