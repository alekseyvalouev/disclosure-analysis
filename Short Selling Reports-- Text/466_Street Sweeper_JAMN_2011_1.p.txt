Jammin Java: Hot Stock, Bitter Aftertaste?
May 18, 2011 11:13 AM ET130 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


By Janice Shell


It’s time to wake up and smell the coffee! That’s exactly what Jammin Java
(OTCPK:JAMN), a heavily promoted coffee company, and – for very different reasons –
we would like investors to do.


Since the beginning of the year, JAMN has miraculously risen from the ashes of the “Grey
Market” graveyard to become one of the liveliest – and richest – stocks in the entire
microcap arena. JAMN has seen its stock shoot straight toward heaven, soaring from 55
cents to peak above $6 a share on massive daily volume, with its market value now
topping $355 million despite the company’s limited resources and operating history. (As
covered in more detail below, two of the Internet tout sheets pushing JAMN the hardest
effectively vanished -- disabled by their Internet servers -- on the day the stock’s trading
volume exploded past 20 million shares.)


JAMN stands out for its powerful connections, the first loudly celebrated by the company
and the second – involving a notorious stock promoter – carefully hidden from view.


For starters, as the company well knows, JAMN comes complete with a very seductive
story. JAMN counts Rohan Marley – one of seven children fathered by iconic Jamaican
musician Bob Marley – as both current chairman and original co-founder of the company.
Thanks to Marley’s son, JAMN has found itself with an attention-grabbing asset.


Through a private firm known as Marley Coffee LLC, corporate filings show, Rohan Marley
has granted JAMN an “exclusive, transferrable, worldwide license” to use the “Marley
Coffee” name to market the expensive coffee it apparently began selling just a few months
ago. JAMN imports its coffee beans from Africa and Central and South America (rather
than Jamaica itself), the company said, and then roasts them here in North America
before ultimately marketing the finished product – retailing for up to $72 (for a variety
pack) before discounts -- with help from the beloved Marley name.


Since JAMN was still classified as a “shell” corporation when it filed its latest financial
statements in December, reporting no revenue or cash in the bank at all, investors have
been bidding up the stock based on mere faith – as opposed to actual evidence – that the
company can drum up huge demand for its high-priced coffee. If the multiples assigned to

industry powerhouse Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) serve as any guide, investors are
basically treating JAMN like a company that sells almost $150 million worth of coffee a
year already and boasts healthy profit margins (approaching 10%) on those sales to boot.


At this point, in fact, JAMN actually looks more valuable on paper than the past “winner”
that stock promoters like to tout when predicting just how successful the company could
ultimately become. Through frequent and potentially expensive advertisements on Yahoo
Finance (now gone), promoters have teased investors with sexy pitches about the “next
Diedrich Coffee” -- which turns out to be none other than JAMN itself. Diedrich wound up
bankrupt before recovering and selling itself to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters
(NASDAQ:GMCR) for $300 million, records show, fetching a price that’s some $56.7
million lower than the market value assigned to JAMN despite its long-established
presence in the coffee industry.


Even the powerful Marley name cannot fully explain the astounding market value enjoyed
by this fledgling coffee company. As indicated above, JAMN can be linked to another –
less illustrious – name as well.


Vancouver stock promoter Shane Whittle has been connected to the company for years.
He served as a director of JAMN from August 2007 to May 2010, corporate filings show,
while filling key executive posts -- including CEO, president, secretary and treasurer --
throughout much of that same time period. Whittle also doubles as CEO of a Canadian
version of Marley Coffee, filings indicate, and ranks as a controlling player at U.S.-based
Marley Coffee LLC – which provided JAMN with its most valuable asset (the Marley
name).


Whittle also ranks as a major shareholder of JAMN itself. He owned almost 10 million
shares of JAMN stock last fall, records indicate, before selling 2 million shares – at just 2
cents apiece – in October and giving another 4.89 million shares away. Whittle smartly
held on to 2.49 million of his JAMN shares, however, which are now worth almost $13
million following an incredible four-month run.


Whittle originally caught our attention a year ago because of his apparent connection to
Big Bear Mining (OTC:BGBR), a heavily promoted penny stock that flew above $1.50 but
has long since crashed below 10 cents a share. Despite convincing evidence to the
contrary, Whittle angrily denied any ties to BGBR in a May 2010 interview with us.


To longtime followers of overhyped penny stocks, JAMN looks like it has neared (or even
reached) its tipping point as well. On a tear for the past month, interrupted by only a
handful of down days along the way, JAMN finally started to take some meaningful hits

late last week. The stock gyrated wildly on Thursday, swinging from an all-time high of
$6.34 to an intraday low of $4.14 before closing above the midpoint of that wide spread. In
that case, at least, JAMN still managed to trade above its previous closing price
throughout the session and ultimately closed with a handsome 35% gain.


JAMN fared worse on Friday, however. Although the stock hit $6 once again that day, it
soon reversed course and found itself closer to the $5 mark – actually down for a change
– by the time that the closing bell rang.


To some, JAMN looks a lot like a movie that just hit the screens a month or two ago. If
they’re right – with LEXG ranking as the original blockbuster and JAMN following as the
popular sequel – then investors better like horror stories with bloody endings. Bluntly put,
critics feel this hot little stock could soon deliver a wake-up call with the fire-power of
coffee – even the smoothest of brews – at full boil.


Important Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this article, TheStreetSweeper (through its
members) effected a “short sale” of 30,000 shares of the stock of JAMN, beginning on
May 4, 2011, at an average price of $2.98 a share, with the intent of profiting from
decreases in the price of the stock. TheStreetSweeper may choose to adjust the size of
this investment – increasing, decreasing or covering its short position in the stock – and
will fully disclose the details of those trades if and when they occur.

Jammin Java still looks like a pretty compelling story. Trying to hack the stock market is a dangerous game, but I
would not hesitate to buy 1000 shares in this company under $1 for potential long-term gains...as a purely speculative
stock. Great marketing on their websites.

First of all, this is amazing product. Not sure if any of you actually drink this coffee, but it is great. Also, if you would
have bought Jamn at .70 cents and sold at 6 dollars you might have made some money. Don't see the problem?

Always seems like these articles follow the massive run down of a stock price, not precede it. If you shorted the stock
thinking it'd decline, why not publish an article before the decline??

She did. She published it Sunday night on TheStreetSweeper.org and set it up with releases couched as
articles at Benzinga.com. The stock plunged the next morning with most traders having little time to figure it
out and reacting on fear. You ask me, she abused her power in this case, whatever good she's done in the
past. Same with TheStreetSweeper.org and Benzinga for promoting this.

Longviewer, you are a prime example of confirmation bias and selectively choosing information to support a
conclusion you've already formed.


First, you conveniently ignore that the stock fell from a high of $6.35 and plunged straight down to nearly
$4.25 within 30 minutes on 5/12, before any article ever came out.


Second, you conveniently ignore how the stock was already fading in price on Friday, 5/13, before the article
ever came out. In fact, on 5/13 I predicted that the stock was going to have a massive tank before this article
came out, as you can see by this comment here:


nathanbusch.wordpress....


How did I predict this? Because I know how pump and dumps operate having seen this over and over and
over again. In fact, it's probably the most predictable and reliable pattern in the stock market. I knew there
was a massive short squeeze on 5/12, and after seeing the weakness and fading price action on Friday, I
knew a dump was imminent. These massive dumps often occur after massive short squeezes on these stock
promotions. See FCPG (short squeeze on 12/8 and 12/9, massive dump on 12/10), HHWW (three days of
squeezes on 12/7 to 12/9, weakness on 12/10, massive dump on 12/11), and LEXG (massive squeeze on
4/27 and 4/28, massive dump on 4/29). All of these were heavily paid stock promotions. In fact, the stock
promotion budget for LEXG was over $3 million.


Third, you conveniently ignore how JAMN dumped hard from $1.90 to $1.25 within an hour on 4/13...a 34%
drop in stock price. There were no articles for you to blame on that one. But again, if you knew how pump and
dumps operate, you would've known that such large dumps are frequent with stock promotions in OTCBB
land.


In fact, I have to question your knowledge of OTCBB stocks in general, given that you are trying to "invest" in
one. OTCBB stocks are great stocks to trade, but absolutely horrible investments. And when you
demonstrated a complete lack of knowledge about past stock promotions like HHWW, it again makes your
knowledge and position very questionable in this area.

YngvaiMalmsteve:


You ignored that there were press releases creating buzz about Janice Shell's "blockbuster" investigative
report on 5/11 and 5/13. Not only that, but days before, Janice Shell was introduced on TheStreetSweeper.org
as a "Powerful New Warrior Against Fraud," before her JAMN piece was announced the week before the
weekend it was released on Sunday evening the 15th. Some on the 12th most likely saw the Benzinga and
TheStreetSweeper promotions and started dumping.


Oh, and others may have been shorting with the intent of profiting from the stock's price drop. That sounds
familiar. Maybe this is what you should have written at the bottom of this last comment:


"Before publication of this comment, YngvaiMalmsteve effected a “short sale” of _______ shares of the stock
of JAMN, beginning on May __, 2011, at an average price of $_.__ a share, with the intent of profiting from

Don't fool yourself again. We all care about you too much.


The set-up pieces for the Shell article would prompt people to set up stops en masse should the stock begin
to tank whenever the Shell piece was lobbed onto the media battlefield of stock manipulation. They would not
sell all of it off on the announcements since the did not know what would be said.


Most investors are familiar with websites that write something attention getting to get you there (implying
exposure, scandal or whatever) then actually write an innocuous or less sensational piece on the subject.
They had to consider that, plus the worst case scenario. So they set stops in case they missed the Shell
piece, then looked for it. On reading the Shelling of JAMN, many likely set up a vigil to try to sell on higher
spikes as the fish flopped around.


Tell you what Malmsteve, here is a fair treatment of the company that you would not understand because you
oversimplify in black and white judgments that benefit your short-selling carrion feeder approach to trading
and abrading companies. Here:

Wow, Longviewer, you continue to show me how clueless you are about the OTCBB market.


Stops don't work in OTCBB stocks, at least not ones that dump like JAMN did. Because of the slow execution
of the OTCBB market, and the fact that many brokers use a limited number of routes for OTCBB orders (for
example, Interactive Brokers only uses NITE), it is impossible to get out of an OTCBB stock if it tanks. It's like
hundreds of people all trying to get out one door at the same time. This is also why these OTCBB pumps will
fall straight down in minutes, and also why investing in these stocks is generally a very bad idea.


What also cracks me up is your claim that only the set-up pieces would cause people to set stops. Are you
delusional? People set up stops all the time whether or not there is any upcoming stories. Do you just invent
these things in your head to try to support your preformed conclusion? Talk about bias! You will invent
anything to create a conspiracy story about the Shell piece. Do you believe 9/11 was an inside job too?


*********** 
So they set stops in case they missed the Shell piece, then looked for it. 
*************


Are you completely new to the stock market? I've got news for you...people set stops all of the time.


24 May 2011, 12:09 AM


Longviewer
YngridMalmSteve, my stops worked. You throw platitudes around about how the OTCBB market works, but
you're just another promoter. What you promote is an interpretation of the JAMN situation that favors your
method of participating in the OTCBB, but I don't agree with it.


I'm really impressed how much you jargon you've mastered and all that you say you know about the OTCBB,
but I think it only proves you are a vulture in that market because you've represented here that its stocks are
bad investments. It's purpose, if you stick to your statements above, is for people to make dumb investments
and vultures like you to profit off of that, perhaps worsen it, and then I guess for recreation you come to
articles like this and pose the superior one with the empty-suit didactics.


I disagree with you, think your premises are unethical, and hope one day that what you do is subject to fines. I
do not respect what you stand for and try to justify.

When you see HEAVY promotion of a stock with ads etc... people are pumping it. It seems that buying reached it's
max after Bob Marley's birthday. Then came the fall. I bought 1000 at 1.91 and I sold 500 at 3.82. I had a sell order
kick in at $2.50 for the rest. I missed the intraday swing... i would have bought at under a buck the 500 shares. It was
clear there was mainly hype around this. There could be some long term potential but there is very little money. Now
can I imagine Marley Coffee stores around select locations in the US selling BIG time...yes.. There is a market for that
and it may happen...

Janice,


1st if you think the stock is worth less than $1 why your organization bought 30, 000 shares and short position at
$2.98.


2nd why are you criticizing the leadership for being great sales people? isn`t that promoting the product is part of their
job.


it seems this article is written to support the short position of your organization 30, 000 shares because the stock rose
very fast to over $5.


You start by saying "Jammin Java: Hot Stock, Bitter Aftertaste? " Negative from the start to crash the stock not to
educate investors.


have you ever tested the coffee?


Every great company startes with great idea and dream to succssed. I think Jammin Java has that. I am adding my

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270555-jammin-java-hot-stock-bitter-aftertaste 9/63


exposed if all the elements of it are there. However, I have not seen evidence in her articles proving that the
company cannot deliver on its contracts or develop and grow a coffee business to fulfill the brand potential of
Marley Coffee. Which made me wonder if she carries her torch for competitors. Then I learned from the
disclaimer in her article's tag line that the publisher promoting her writing took a financial position to profit from
a price decline in JAMN before she posted the piece on their website. That's when her flaming of JAMN cast
a stranger light.


I see evidence of the announcement and timing of Shell's JAMN piece that suggests she may have poisoned
the stock price herself in concert with her publisher, and acted as an "anti-promoter" rather than a fraud
buster. I believe she then misdirected readers by emphasizing other factors, such as the company's late filing
of its annual report as causing the decline. However, that late filing was known news while the stock price
increased all week until the close of the markets Friday the 13th 2011.


In her most recent piece, "Jammin Finally Spills The Beans -- And It's an Ugly Mess," (her way of announcing
that the company made good on filing its 10-K) she makes reference to investors waking up and smelling the
coffee yet again after reeling from the stock's "rapid plunge."


What Shell does not highlight for readers is that her story was set up on Benzinga and TheStreetSweeper.org
Wednesday the 10th and (of all things) Friday the 13th respectively, last week. These story set-ups
(promotions?) had made page one of Google News search results for JAMN by Friday afternoon. She then
posted her "blockbuster" and "full blown" story Sunday evening at 6:45 PM, giving investors little (for most,
no) time to vet the veracity and significance of her findings.


Sure as the sun, the rapid plunge in JAMN happened Monday morning as investors rushed to protect
themselves rather than wait to see if all of her representations were true and or significant to the company's
capabilities. By that time, what difference would it have made if perceptions were set?


More troubling to me than anything else, click below on the link and scroll to the bottom of the article for
TheStreetSweeper's disclaimer in the tagline of Janice Shell's pieces on JAMN:


* Important Disclosure: Prior to the publication of this article, TheStreetSweeper (through its members)
effected a “short sale” of 30,000 shares of the stock of JAMN, beginning on May 4, 2011, at an average price
of $2.98 a share, with the intent of profiting from decreases in the price of the stock. TheStreetSweeper
covered its entire position on May 18 at $1.51 a share."


Then in today's piece she has the audacity to imply that the stock plunge is the company's fault. She flamed
the company and undid its promotions despite her publishers' intentional goal of profiting from the drop in
share price. If that is not a glaring conflict of interest more unethical than anything JAMN is alleged or
insinuated to have done, what is? For that, the NPO should possibly lose its non-profit status for going
beyond its stated purpose of helping investors. It sure hasn't helped this one that the piece artificially tanked
the share prices.


As someone who got most of my information about JAMN from business newswires, I read about what the
company has done and is doing to develop its business. I read about the sector. Nowhere did I see where the
company promised that its coffee all came from Jamaica, nor that it would never come from there. It is
expected that it would since Marley owns coffee farms there, unless that is a flat out lie.

blend make anyone yell fraud that ithe coffee is not grown in Alaska?


I saw Bell's promotions, but I never act on the advice of someone like that. I independently check out what the
company has done, owns, and its related potential, not what some guy says the price will do. Yet this was a
growth investment. If JAMN had already grown when I researched them, then their price would have also,
and my growth stock wouldn't be. "Prospects" are naturally part of growth investing. This was not yet a "value
investment" by any stretch, however, the fact that the business was in place and the branding exceptional
was a valuable consideration.


I checked JAMN out on my own and found that it had successfully sold out on Amazon in some test runs, had
licensed to use the Marley TMs, and that Rohan Marley does own a Jamaican property that produces coffee. I
also learned that they have signed agreements with coffee distributors and services and that they are still
filling out their corporate leadership seats.


To say that JAMN made misrepresentations material to its stock price's fall I think is unlikely. If the company
has made misrepresentations beyond puffing or using weasel words (many of which are also in Janice Shell's
articles to spice them up and cover herself) I do not think those were central enough to the company's
capability of putting out coffee under a great brand to be the cause of a loss of business confidence. Neither
is a late filing of a 10K. It may raise doubt, but that had already been news well before the fast ascent of the
shares of JAMN.


In fact, Shell's most recent piece includes this question-begger about the post-blockbuster filed JAMN 10-K,
pointing out that previously JAMN had suggested it had exclusive rights to Marley Coffee TMs, but in the new,
full filing, calls it non-exclusive:


Exclusive? Maybe not so much any more. In its new 10-K, JAMN now po...


It seems like a stunning change because it is. But why did it happen? We can't rule out the timing. What if
Marley Coffee Company's directors, including Rohan Marley, saw the Sunday evening May 15th 'blockbuster'
post by Janice Shell that was supposed to eviscerate JAMN, which his private company had granted
exclusive rights to. He thinks, I imagine, this way: 'Kee-rap, they're going to tank JAMN before we can really
show what we can do. JAMN will be dead. We need the right to sell our name and identity and coffee TMs
non-exclusively because the perception alone will kill JAMN as a vehicle for that...'


Ms. Shell apparently doesn't understand how her 'blockbustering' about uncertainties can alter perception
over the internet, then alter a business's relationships, and do certain damage to a company, hurting its
investors more than anyone else. The Marleys could have reasoned that perception is what ultimately
matters, and Janice Shell has already shaped it regardless of what our company can actually do, so they go
elsewhere with the TMs (trademarks). Well I can't do that with my shares, can I.


Maybe Janice Shell and TheStreetSweeper.org can correct me on the timing. I guarantee you she's not going
to pay me a cent of what TheStreetSweeper.org made off of shorting 30,000 shares of JAMN to make up for
what I lost investing in 304 shares.


And she just keeps trying to nail the coffin shut on JAMN. Is that fair? Why doesn't she do that to the
promoters who lie, and to the big news outlets and tickers that carry promoters' ads as if they were analytic

news? That is more deceptive than anything for the personal investors. People surf the net in their busy lives
trying to get as comprehensive a view as possible without losing time on good buying opportunities. Rhetoric
and text from sources on the news tickers can create an overall impression, and allowing paid promoters into
that mix is a real distortion.


The revelation that JAMN outsources buying and roasting to a Canada firm (for now) while developing,
owning and maintaining its product lines and branding is not news to the business world. That is done all the
time. Starbucks buys its coffee from farmers all over and Starbucks roasts it, but when it goes for sale in
Starbucks Coffee, it is labeled Starbucks Coffee, not the Farmer's Name & Starbucks Coffee. Because
Starbucks does not farm it's own beans in Seattle but gets them from all over the world, does that mean they
are not a legitimate coffee company? Is Yukon blend illegitimate because of that?


What does one have to do to be a legitimate coffee company? Farm, roast, package, brand and distribute?
Nothing may be outsourced, acquired or partnered then promoted under one name? Although others farmed
Starbucks coffee, does Starbucks put the farmers' names on the packages? No, it is Starbucks Coffee. Their
brand commands.


Janice Shell established that JAMN has had connections with known paid promoters who have made bad
calls on other stocks. Were all of their calls bad? I'd like to know. Are they really wrong about the potential for
JAMN? That's what is relevant here, not JAMN's guilt by association with their past errors, or blaming JAMN
for promoting hard. Hit the misleading aspects of the promotions, the overheated nature of the stock, but don't
go all out to destroy the company's name or you hurt the investors more than anyone else. The principals and
private licensors can just change horses, but investors can't.


Unless there is evidence that JAMN never could, never intended to, and never tried to make their coffee
business into a powerfully branded international coffee company, I'm going to think of Janice Shell and
TheStreetSweeper.org when I lament that my remaining personal investment in 304 shares of JAMN is sitting
dead on my brokerage account.


I'll also remember them when I think of what profit I may have had with all the shares that I put close-cropped
stop orders on because I understood when I saw her report announced that it could potentially destroy the
company entirely by creating perceptions of its death, canceling out its expensive PR campaign and sliming it
with its promoters' slime. But for TheStreetSweeper.org's self-interested-story, I would have held onto those
shares throughout normal news cycles by more objective business journalists whose publishers were not
vested in JAMN's decline.


So far, none of those have come to the company's aid, to give it a balanced look. The closest was a piece at
Motely Fool that was fair to Marley and Co., but the headline was a hollow-point bullet blasting my shares to
hades: Throw This Stock Away. I have tried to give this a balanced look here. A fair trial. But I fear I'm too late.
I fear the jury box is empty. I see no excuse for the members of The StreetSweeper.org to bet on the decline
of JAMN before publishing the report, then having the temerity to suggest they speak for the small investor
like me.


Finally, if Janice Shell can show that JAMN with what it has done and is doing, absent her flaming articles,
could never have fulfilled its promoted objectives and knew it, or did not intend to do so in the coffee sector,

I just got another e-mail from Lautner today. Like it or not at least JAMN has product. It is not coming from Marley's
plantation in Jamaica but that is only 56 acres. With Rohan only having a 33% interest in that it seems he wants to
keep JAMN completely separate. 
I got out with a double here but my wife still has some shares. I think something good might still develop IF the coffee
is good!

Lautner's e-mail:


On May 6th I sent you an email 
recommending you JAMN.


You'll remember that email.


The subject line was:


"JAMN Pullback Presents Opportunity..."


Anyway...


At the time you received that 
email JAMN was at $2.77 after 
a pullback.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270555-jammin-java-hot-stock-bitter-aftertaste 13/63


Since then JAMN rose from $2.77 
to a high of $6.35 last week!


Had you taken my advice you had 
the chance to more than double 
your investment.


But...


In the past few days JAMN has 
pulled back sharply again.


This time it was very sharp.


JAMN closed yesterday at just $1.52


Why?


The reason why JAMN fell so sharply 
is also the reason it could be a great 
low downside risk opportunity.


JAMN has fallen for two reasons.


#1 JAMN has been attacked by short 
sellers.


Short sellers including the sponsoring 
market maker and related parties 
have attempted to crush JAMN.


They've done this by selling millions 
and millions of JAMN shares'.


By ensuring supply outstripped demand 
they have manipulated the price of 
JAMN downwards.


But, this price manipulation is only 
temporary.


By law these short sellers MUST buy 
back every single share' they've sold 
short.


And they must complete this buying 
within 5 days.


Which means JAMN is I believe almost 
guaranteed to bounce on the wave

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270555-jammin-java-hot-stock-bitter-aftertaste 14/63


of buying from short sellers looking 
to cover their positions.


#2 Jammin released their 10-K annual 
report.


This report showed minimal sales for 
the quarter ending January 31st.


I believe this release fuelled the 
negative rumors spread by short 
sellers.


But this reaction is entirely without 
merit.


Jammin Java only started their 
nationwide rollout in February.


In the quarter ending Jan 31st JAMN 
was still a development stage company.


i.e. They weren't even trying to 
generate sales.


All the deals they've signed have 
been since February:


JAMN Contract with United Natural Foods 
- February 23rd


JAMN contract with Gourmet Merchants Intl. 
- March 16th


JAMN contract with Amazon.com 
- March 31st


JAMN contract with National Coffee Service 
- April 12th


JAMN launches Coffee Pods Product Line 
- April 14th


JAMN sells out within 1 Hour at Amazon Launch 
- April 20th


JAMN receives $2.5m financing 
- May 6th

https://seekingalpha.com/article/270555-jammin-java-hot-stock-bitter-aftertaste 15/63


So large sales won't be reported to 
Wall Street until the next quarter.


Here's why I believe you should look 
at JAMN again...


On a short-term basis I see JAMN 
as a huge opporunity right now.


When a stock drops this much, this 
fast...


For one thing, there is always a 
bounce.


And for another thing...


As the short sellers who've pushed 
JAMN to these levels start covering 
it will add rocket fuel to the bounce.


As a natural bounce occurs along 
with millions of shares' being 
bought by short sellers - We could 
even see another short squeeze.


(A similar short squeeze to the one 
that pushed JAMN to $6.35 just 
the other week.)


Your Pal, 
Marc Lautner


P.S. The last time I sent you a similar 
email to this JAMN was at $2.77


Just like today I predicted the 
short squeeze could send JAMN rocketing.


It reached $6.35 in the weeks following.


JAMN is now under $2 and I'm making 
the exact same call.


Don't miss out again.


Start researching JAMN for yourself 
today.

Interesting article - the disclosure about being short 30K does raise a legitimate concern over whether this is an
objective viewpoint or not. I don't have enough information to ascertain whether or not the underlying entity will ever
grow into it's valuation or not. It appears they actually have good coffee but they also do not appear to have a solid
corporate structure either. Anyone investing in this company with the hope of "hitting it big" is really no investor at all,
but just a dreamer. The stock may hit big, or it may crash and burn, but the point is that there is not enough
information to make an informed decision so if you put money into this you should just realize that you are gambling -
it's no different than going to Atlantic City and playing cards. There's nothing wrong with that, but you shouldn't whine
if you lose money or complain that you were misled. If you don't have either the assets to gamble or the knowledge of
how to do valuations (or realize that you can't do one here) then you have no business playing in the penny
stock/startup realm.


I followed this stock for a while and decided to jump in - I traded 10k share blocks and only held my position for a
matter of minutes (on one occasion I held on for a couple of hours) and happened to do all right. It didn't make me
rich but it pays for a summer vacation. Does this make me a good trader? Absolutely not. Was I able to see technical
signs and use my skills to profit? Nope. This was merely a bit of a fun run that I decided to do because I had the
assets to afford the loss and I found it fun to jump in and out and see how I would do.


It will be interesting to see where JAMN goes from here. It leveled out at $1 yesterday and then has had a pretty good
run again from there. But anyone who says they have good analysis showing whether the next move for the stock is
up or down is either delusional or just likes to hear themselves talk with authority about something they actually know
nothing about.

And those of you who think there's conflict of interest based on TheStreetSweeper's short position, take note that the

Longviewer
After calling others here "Jokers" you write "This stock is a pump and dump all the way, and this is a very poor
long term investment." Have you made all of your disclosures?


Everyone sees the pump - the promotion. But who is responsible for investor dumping? And where is the
evidence of dumping by the principals of JAMN?


You need to tie-in and add up the specific evidence supporting your case argument, but you don't. I see your
averment, but not your evidence. I see your mouth moves, but not your mental work. You'd get a D- from a
compassionate logic teacher for what you wrote. It's also telling in what you did not say. You did not say Shell
proved fraud, or an intent not to do and develop JAMN's coffee business.


Outline and convince us that the evidence proves that the directors and officers have *not* been engaged in
business development; selling coffee; that the press releases on test sales, distribution agreements, and
actual coffee sales (outsourcing is irrelevant) do not exist; that those aren't real; that the financing does not
exist or that it is illegal. Prove the legal definition of fraud has been met.


Which evidence specifically proves it? Are you too lazy to say? Or is all you or the author can do is imply it,
use rhetoric to beg the question, use snark to put an emotional element to it, and point to evidence of error
and puffing, then short-time the report before the trading day Monday so no one can weigh the presumptions
made. StreetSweeper.org drove investors off the cliff and then stole their pocket change at the bottom with
their 30,000 share short-sell bet on JAMN before this report.


Once the price plummets, the author allows her readers to believe that it is somehow confirmation of her
article's aim, but that's no different than if I steal your car in the morning and say you never intended to be on
time for work then hand deliver a letter to your employer about your tardiness or absenteeism.


So far as the Shell evidence goes (not far), it is well researched. But the evidence doesn't prove fraud. If more
is found and does, great, but I don't see it yet. It proves there is a "pump," but not that there is a dump
independent of the effects of the investigative piece itself. It relies on rhetoric to make more of the evidence
than there is. In fact, the timing of the plunge is directly related to this report, not to anything the company did
or failed to do.


The clearest fact is that the publisher TheStreetSweeper.org had short-selling interests with much to gain
behind the report, which benefitted that publisher. The technical exclusion of the author from shares is a

distinction without a difference -- she benefits from being published by the publisher (& possibly paid by
same) and the publisher benefits financially from her report because it (supposedly a .org) took a financial
interest in the demise of the company flamed. Why do you justify such a conflict of interest and pretend to
speak for propriety? Look at the logo by Janice Shell's name here on SeekingAlpha. It says
TheStreetSweeper. They're the beneficiary of JAMN's fall. The investors lose.


There is specific evidence to prove that the timing of this piece on TheStreetSweeper.org and on
SeekingAlpha.com is what precipitated the fall in JAMN's stock price. The report was announced as a
"blockbuster" last week Wednesday the 11th on TheStreetSweeper.org then promoted on Benzinga.com on
Friday the 13th, but no specifics were outlined. The writer was puffed as a "Powerful Warrior Against Fraud"
on TheStreetSweeper.org before her piece was puffed. Then the ".org" dropped the report on investors'
desktops the Sunday night before the market opened so that after hours and beginning on Monday morning,
harried, busy, tired people would be forced to make a decision: trust the tone of the report without time to
check the significance and reach of its findings, or sell off their JAMN shares to avoid loss. It was fear driven.
The investors' loss benefitted TheStreetSweeper.org. And you are an apologist for that.


I don't think the principals and insiders intended to dump or look for non-exclusive rights to sell the Marley
brand until this report had precipitated irreparable damage to JAMN by the promotion, rhetoric, innuendo and
short-timing of this report. If Shell's future evidence proves the contrary, very good. I'll praise her efforts.


But you two are assuming that Rohan Marley, a JAMN director, intended not to see the business through.
Where is his motive? You think he wants to ruin his name, his family name, their brand? Are you saying that
he is not dedicated to building that business and benefitting Jamaicans with it over time? He's a Director. I
wouldn't blame Rohan Marley and others for seeking a non-exclusive contract with JAMN after the Shell
report had eviscerated the stock value and company name. How else do they escape the media lynching this
appears to be?

Longviewer,


It seems to me that you do not understand how paid stock promotions work, or what happens to these stocks.


I suggest you study the past charts of KYUS (in 2008), HHWW, NXTH (in late 2009 and early 2010), TNGS,
KNKT, and LEXG.


All of these were slowly manipulated upwards on paid stock promotions, and then had massive tanks. There
were no Streetsweeper articles causing these tanks. It is what happens to stocks that are manipulated
upwards on paid promotions. The promoters create false volume by trading with each other, and at the same
time, slowly sell their shares to people buying into the promotion as the stock price rises higher.


Once they are done selling their shares, done with the promotion, or cannot get the price to go higher
anymore, they pull their bids. With no bidders to hold the stock price up, it crashes in price, and investors are
left holding the bag.

This pattern has repeated itself over and over and over again with every single paid stock promotion on the
OTC market. JAMN is no different.


Let me ask you...if you think the Streetsweeper article was responsible for causing the dump, how come
LEXG didn't dump when a Streetsweeper article came out on it? It actually continued to go higher.


Even with JAMN, Streetsweeper had announced a short position when it was in the 3's, before it ever went to
the 6's.


On top of that, you completely ignore the author's past success in exposing scams and pump and dump
operations.


And you still haven't provided any information refuting anything in the article. Your whole argument rests on
the coincidental timing of the article....which means you are committing the cum hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy
(with this, therefore because of this).


20 May 2011, 11:03 AM


Longviewer
You have to prove that this particular paid stock promotion's volume was based on the promoters' trading. You
also need to show proof of them pulling their bids. If you do that, your lesson will be more than academic.
Otherwise, you're just arguing from analogy to how others have worked, and that's weak.


I'll study the suggested stock trends. But unlike you, I'll look for distinctions as well as analogies.


You write:


"This pattern has repeated itself over and over and over again with every single paid stock promotion on the
OTC market."


That sure sounds hyperbolic. Prove it. Every single one?


Perhaps LEXG's had different facts about the business development, or the promoters' trades etc. Perhaps
the piece was not as prominent as this. Perhaps the Marley name and a very popular reggae song were not
attached to it to get folks' attention when the suggestion of corruption was implied. I'd say those are
distinctions worth looking at as to why LEXG didn't dump after the article. But distinctions aren't something
you're looking for are they?


The author's past success is irrelevant to what was done in this case.


It is relevant to a hearty congratulations to her for doing good in the past.


I already told you that it is the lack of evidence for what you claim ("pump and dump all the way") that is the
problem. That doesn't go to the validity of evidence in Shell's piece, but to the sufficiency. It is the problem of
other countervailing evidence of business development for this company that also poses a problem for your
premise and that of Shell's. Hence, the argument that I haven't refuted items of evidence cited by Shell is just
a misdirection on your part.

Your "distinctions" are actually nothing more than ad hoc excuses to try to force the evidence to fit your

aren't willing to use that in a very similar case.


I deal in probabilities. If other paid stock promotions have massive dumps, then the probability favors that
JAMN, which was part of a long 6-month stock promotion, would have a massive dump as well.

Huh? This is a known paid stock promotion. It's all over the internet. Go to the Lautner Letter site which is part
of the promotion. The fact that it's a paid stock promotion proves it's a pump and dump. Paid stock
promotions are pump and dumps. It doesn't matter whether Marley is involved or not. Even if Marley is
innocent, the third parties pumping the stock aren't, and the price action and chart will reflect it accordingly.

Oh, and I have to ask you something. I knew this was a pump and dump before I ever saw the paid
promotional sites. How did I know this? By looking at the chart, and watching the intraday price action. Pump
and dumps have very distinct charts and intraday price movement. I then discovered the promotion later.


Now, if this isn't a pump and dump, how was I able to identify that this stock was being promoted before even
seeing the promotions?

No, the distinctions are distinctions between LEXG and JAMN, not excuses. I am not the one who made the
case for JAMN's demise. I am the one trying to make sense of all of the information while you wish only to
emphasize that which defends your friend, or your writer or whoever you are to SW.org and the writer.


As a matter of fact, we can use distinctions to doubt a case. At least be true to logic if you can't help
arrogantly pretending to teach it. These distinctions aren't ad hoc excuses. They're frustrating facts for those
who want everyone to listen to their case only, damn the rest of us.

Re: LEXG: The only case at issue here is JAMN. You are referring to LEXG over and over again to be
prejudicial. It's not the same case, nor is your fallacy in continually comparing it persuasive. You wish to make
an argument from analogy to LEXG, because you have a foregone conclusion that these all end the same.
But you have no proof that ALL have ended the same. Just your assertion coupled with very real action taken
distinguishing this case -- a short bet on the company's devaluation by the .org that published a report
designed to devalue.


You continue to substitute analogical arguments with past cases for real evidence in this case.

Now if all of these transactions, the largest for 0 Cents per share, are the dumps, why so much promotion
after the dumps?


Paid promotions makes it a PUMP, but to have a dump, all shares have to have been dumped at a time that
precipitates the big decline, but we don't see that here given the dates. We see the greatest decline
happening after Ms. Shell's article. IN fact, the latest transactions are BUYS for 2 million shares by Rohan
Marley.

You have nothing more than the timing to point out, which is pretty poor reasoning. But you can keep using

In other words, your standards of evidence are inconsistent. You hold the Seeking Alpha writer to a higher

evidence. Fraud is criminal and tortious, and so it carries a higher burden of proof if proven. Defense of fraud
does not carry the same burden.


The Shell piece and your conclusions from it have possible legal implications for some involved, and if, as
TheStreetSweeper does, it is to write about criminal prosecutions of companies it has showcased in the past,
then that threat exists for some or all the JAMN principals and like burdens of proof are the most reasonable
to apply to this argument that has legal implications. I take this to mean that as we debate this, you and Shell
DO have the higher burden of proof.


I didn't bring the case, she and you did, so assume your responsibility for your role.


Finally, here is one possibility I'm willing to entertain from what you've argued (not your faux-logic objections
to my valid arguments): I'm willing to buy that the insiders were going to dump and it is possible that Janice
Shell's piece caught them before they could and that puts the pressure on everyone involved to actually
perform, which may ultimately bring about a coffee company that does things right and better.


If, as you've said, Rohan Marley is a likely victim of a pump and dump, he appears to be turning the dump
part around, and trying to make it work. And, you and others should be more precise in your very broad
conclusions about JAMN as a company and as a whole including all of the victim investors (if you're correct).
You owe it to them not to play games with timing.


In another response I've posted the major holders and the insider trades from Yahoo Finance and Reuters. If
this is a Dump, the Dump is not a done deal.


What is irrefutable is that the stock price totally tanked the morning after Janice Shell's report posted Sunday
night, and the next open trading day after a week of significant promotion (innuendo) for the report. To
discount the chart showing the precipitous drop from Friday to Monday is to have your head in the sand for
your team.


Timing is everything in some situations. This is one of them. Your alleged dumps by insiders and promoters,
which I've posted in the other comment in this thread should have been reflected in the insider sales and
those should have caused the significant price declines. Why didn't they? And why would they dump before
promoting. Their share prices wouldn't have maximized.


Those insider sales are remote, but I'll agree they had something to do with the stock price's decline, but not
the precipitous plunge of May 16th. The report came only hours before trading opened and the decline was
immediate.


The evidence is one of cause and effect, not just correlation, because the promotion of the piece made the
Google news ticker, Benzinga, Investorshub and a number of other referred sites. It is reasonable to make the
link.

Basically, I am applying the same standard of evidence to similar situations. You are shifting your standard of

The problem with this is that the SEC is severely understaffed and often doesn't go after these pump and

People were accusing Madoff of a ponzi scheme in 2001. The SEC didn't step in until 2008. Many pump and

doesn't bother or have the resources. Relying on past criminal prosecutions is a pretty poor line of reasoning.

Did you ever notice that JAMN started dumping on Friday before the report ever came out? Even Thursday
had a massive intraday drop when it peaked at 6.35. This is typical of pump and dumps...something you still
seem to have yet to learn. I've seen these over and over and over and over again. Apparently you are unable
to learn from history (or don't even know about history, at least when it comes to pump and dump operations).


The drop was predictable, just as predictable as it is for every other dump. Why don't you check out HHWW's
drop on December 13, 2010. Or TNGS's drop in late December 2010, and another one in January, 2011. Or
FCPG's drop on December 10, 2010. Or KNKT's drop on March 1, 2011. Or LEXG's drop on April 29.


All of these were paid stock promotion campaigns. All of them had massive drops in a span of 1-3 days. And
they did not coincide with any articles.


JAMN has been part of a paid stock promotion campaign, and it also had a massive drop in a span of 1-3
days. It also had a massive drop on April 13th (when there was no article).


So we have dozens of examples of stocks with paid promotions showing massive 1-3 day drops. Only one
(JAMN, and only its second drop, not its first) of these coincided with an article. And you are going to sit here
and claim it was the article that caused the drop, when all of these other promotions have had massive drops
without such articles? Please do me a favor and go take a lesson on statistics and probability.

The previous drops rebounded and were nowhere near as massive as that of May 16th, Monday morning
through Wednesday.


I think the most you can say about the April drops is that the stock was volatile, but you cannot say the dump
that tanks the stock once and for all took place at any of those times.


We can say that a definitive event that is the simplest explanation coincided with the most massive and
largely non-recovered drop in JAMN's sales price: and that was the Shell article aimed at hammering JAMN
to please her employer which had a financial interest in the stock being hit hard and dropping in price.


As of right now at Google Finance, JAMN has 70.79 million total shares. Since the major holders who are
relevant to a conspiracy to dump would be at issue, here's a link showing who they are and what they hold
minus :


thestreet.com/quot...


22.7 percent of shares are owned by insiders according to the Street's info.


Now look at Google's 1 month chart. The precipitous drop happens in concert with news item B on Google's
ticker and also on the chart:


B. TheStreetSweeper.org Publishes Negative Research Report on Jammin' Java Corp 
Benzinga - May 16, 2011


The volume in that period was 2384.82 K shares versus 943.55K the preceding Friday's close at 5.19. On
Monday, hours after the report, it opens around $3.05, jumps around like a dying fish and in the following
period gets into the $1's zone by the 18th.


Nothing close to that happened on the chart over the past year of insider sales.


And, insiders continue to hold 22.7% based on the Street's data. Now how can you say insider dumping is the
cause of the drop?

Again, I have no burden to show evidence to prove a negative regarding an analogy (LEXG) you have raised
that is too attenuated from the JAMN situation to be relevant. Your attempt to discuss LEXG would be barred

plunging, which event was put into motion by a non-profit entity with a financial interest in causing a dump.
Oops! You just can't get around that, though you keep justifying that unethical, hypocritical fact and
misdirecting us away from it.


As before: I'm open to real evidence that JAMN IS NOT going to be led by its good faith directors, owners and
officers to develop the business in a way beneficial to the shareholders. I seriously doubt the promoters will,
unless of course they're trying to stay out of jail by doing so.


If you show that evidence of non-intention by existing principals and shareholders to build a coffee business,
let me know. Please stick with current decision makers, not those that have long resigned.


You've probably missed what I've said about "Straight Path." If you find it, then you can comment

It is not "too attenuated", and it is not proving a negative.


Let's take baseball player A, who eats Wheaties right before he hits a home run. You then conclude that

We can easily show that it is unlikely that the Wheaties caused the home run, by showing how this person
has hit home runs in the past without eating Wheaties. The argument is strengthened when we show that
there are other people who eat Wheaties and don't hit home runs afterwards. Thus, we can safely infer that
the Wheaties/home run relationship was purely a coincidence, rather than causal.


Does this prove that it's not causal? Of course not...you can't prove it in the absence of a controlled
experiment. But we can certainly make the inference based on probabilities that it is highly, highly unlikely that
the Wheaties caused the home run.


Likewise, you are trying to claim that an article caused the drop in stock price (without any proof on your
end...just coincidental timing). Let's ignore the fact that you're committing the post-hoc, ergo propter hoc
fallacy.


Like with the baseball player, we can look at similar situations to see if articles have caused such drops in the
past. Lo and behold, we have the example of LEXG, which was also a paid stock promotion with a highly
negative article by the exact same publisher and author. Yet the stock continued to go higher after the article.
There are other examples. Citron Research came out with a well researched, negative article on HHWW
(another OTCBB mailer promotion) on Dec 10th. HHWW did not tank that day in response to the article.
Citron is widely read by many investors and traders.


We can also ask if other negative articles by the same publisher have had influences on stock prices. We
already know about LEXG, but let's look at others. A negative article came out on COUGF (another OTCBB
mailer pump) the morning of 2/1, but the stock price didn't move much. A negative article came out on HHWW
(another OTCBB mailer pump) on 1/11, with no effect on the stock price. A negative article came out on NOG
(not a pump) on 3/20, 3/21, and 5/9, but had no influence on the stock price. A negative article came out on
SWSH (not a pump) on 5/1, with little effect on the stock price.


So we have all of these examples of negative articles coming out, some by the exact same publisher on
OTCBB pumps, yet no effect on the stock price. Based on probability alone, this makes it unlikely that this
article affected JAMN.


We can then ask the question if such drops are typical of OTCBB stock promotions, or atypical. It turns out
they are highly typical of such promotions.


We can then ask the question if JAMN has shown such drops in the past, without any articles. It turns out it
has.


All of these taken together allow us to infer that it is highly improbable that the drop was caused by the article.
Does it completely rule it out? Of course not, but you can't rule out that I'm an alien from outer space either
given your knowledge of me.

I approach this problem like a scientist, asking the question "What is most probable?" Based on looking at
ALL of the factors (not just the timing, which you continue to get hung up on), it is highly improbable that the
article caused the stock to tank. Just like every other OTC promotion, this stock was bound to tank sooner or
later.

wtf is pump and dump??? The company is building relationships and marketing it's product heavily! I don't get it.
Every company doesn't start the same way. And the story of a companies ascent doesn't follow the same script. 
They are presenting at the exhibit in Chicago on Saturday... Will they have fake people there promoting the products.
Standing there for the hell of it just to keep us fools buying and selling their shares? You stock geeks are too smart for
your own good sometimes.


No Im not here to pump this stock. And yes this is my first post here, or maybe my second. That doesnt matter. I'm
just saying if the Law says you have to buy back the shares you short then the stock is going to jump again 'soon.'

If you don't know what a pump and dump is, you shouldn't be playing in the stock market.


This stock (not the company itself) has been heavily promoted with an online paid stock promotion campaign.
The former CEO is a known Vancouver stock promoter involved in past pump and dump operations, and still
has connections to the company. Then on top of that the company has a Reg S filing which is typical of pump
and dump scams.


These types of "investments" never end well. Every pump and dump always ends up trading in the pennies.


You need to ask yourself...if this company is so great, why are there people who are being paid to promote
the stock? There is way more effort being put into getting people to buy the stock itself, rather than the coffee.
That should raise serious red flags.


20 May 2011, 09:25 AM

The dump on this stock started before the article ever came out. This would've dumped whether there had
been an article or not.


This is how pump and dumps operate. Check out the past stock charts of HHWW, KNKT, KYUS, TNGS,
NXTH, etc. All of these were stocks that were pumped up on paid promotions and then had huge dump days,
many without any article like this. JAMN was no different.


Interestingly, you are complaining about the piece, yet you have no factual evidence refuting what is in the
piece. If the information is true, why would you be complaining? You should be thanking them for revealing
this important information to help you make a wiser decision.

BTW, reread what I've written. I haven't said the evidence in the piece is not supported with documents, I
have said that the evidence was not enough and that the rhetoric and conflict of interest raised a red flag. I've
repeated what evidence I'm looking for in post after post. You're not dealing with the conflict of interest or the
question of intent to do business and evidence of intent to see it through. Why is that not significant?


I've never made a case to defend the promoters because I don't rely on them. I relied on the actions the
company took to develop and promote their business meaning it was serious about actually growing it into the
real deal from a fledgling, under-the-radar learning curve operation.


Again: if you or Shell have more evidence to prove intent to dump and defraud, I'll change my tune.


20 May 2011, 10:56 AM


Longviewer
Your last paragraph is a fair argument. Why promote the stock versus the coffee? I can think of one reason.
The promotion of the stock gets the media's attention in such a way as to create free-buzz marketing. Merely
advertising the coffee is expensive with much less traction.


Advertising the stock with the intent to pump then dump it and never do business to try to fulfill the promoted
aims of the company is what I'd call a pump-and-dump, and that would have to be led by the company and its
insiders who then try to disappear.


You and Shell may turn out to be right here. But the evidence isn't all there as yet. And the tone, timing and
conflict of interest in and behind the investigative piece leaves as much bitter taste for me absent that
evidence. Why won't you acknowledge that problem? Do you have a conflict?


I've got a very limited loss in shares of JAMN, but also am holding onto some shares as a matter of principle
believing that the company was serious about doing and developing its coffee business. My proportion of
investment is the same as it would be with any similarly situated "growth stock" for which there is no crystal
ball. However, now I believe, even if the company was planning to grow and develop business as its actions
suggested, this piece and the fear it has engendered may have tanked the stock for some time if not forever.


UNLESS you show evidence that was always the intent of the insiders.

Because the "conflict of interest" doesn't refute any of the evidence presented in the piece. It is nothing more
than guilt by association, which is not an argument. You are essentially trying to attack the messenger, rather
than directly dealing with the message.


For the people who were calling fraud on CCME and were short CCME, did that invalidate their evidence
against CCME simply because they were short? No, it didn't.


You claim the "evidence isn't all there yet", which tells me you haven't investigated it fully. The evidence is all
there...it's actually pretty damning. This SA article only touches on some of it.

You're incorrect here as well. NXTH is one example of a legitimate company with a legitimate product, yet
was still part of a pump and dump operation. Insiders don't always try to disappear after a pump and dump.
Instead, they realize they can make more money pumping their stock than pumping their product, and they'll
do it with little consequence, especially given how inept the SEC is.

This is an OTCBB stock, and is essentially the Wild West of the stock market. The insiders may not
necessarily file the fact that they've dumped their shares, or it may be the stock promoters dumping. This
happens all of the time with OTCBB pump and dumps.


Again, I suggest you look at past OTCBB paid promotions...the same thing happens every single time. Why
do you think JAMN would be any different?

OK, I'll look past OTCBB promotions as you say.


You say the same thing happens every single time. I don't think you can support that.


If you don't have specific evidence of who is dumping, how much, and what effect it has, especially
considering JAMN's volume, then you rely on conjecture. Similar patterns show symmetry, not proof. There
remains the proof of business development. Is that true with the others also? Or the lack of motive for
someone like Marley to allow his brand and name to be pinned to a pump and dump?


Do you think one investigative report by one reporter with a follow up after the company filed its 10K and lots
of spin in the rhetoric should replace proof with real, hard evidence of what has happened here? I don't think
so.


We'll see. I hope you're wrong, and that Shell is wrong in her premise and tone. I still need to see evidence
that this is not a business trying to develop and intending to do so.

This doesn't support your point in the least bit.


Numerous other stock promotions have had large dumps without such articles.


LEXG had an article by the same author, with the same disclosure of a short position, that didn't result in a
dump.


And what do you do to try to wave away these points? Some ad hoc explanation for why LEXG didn't dump in
response to the article.


You can't have it both ways. You can't claim that JAMN dumped in response to the article, and at the same
time make up excuses as to why LEXG didn't dump.


What is amusing is you keep claiming my evidence is somehow flimsy, yet your position is 100 times weaker.
In fact, you're being hypocritical. You insinuate that the evidence of a pump and dump is purely circumstantial

Just to show the problems with your thinking here:


I see something that looks like a duck. It waddles like a duck. It has the shape of a duck. I hear a quack. It
has feathers. It flies. It paddles in the water.


Based on that, I reasonably conclude it's a duck. But according to you, I need more proof that it's a duck.


Is it possible that I'm being deceived? Perhaps. But is it probable? No.


Now we have a stock. It looks awfully like a pump and dump. The chart looks like a pump and dump. The
intraday price action resembles that of a pump and dump. There are paid stock promotions everywhere on
the internet. The former CEO of the company is a person involved in past pump and dumps. There is a reg S
filing that is typical of past pump and dump scams. The stock has flown through the roof into ridiculous
valuations, similar to other past pump and dumps. The company files an 8K trying to distant itself from the
promotion, just like other pump and dumps. There are questionable things in the filings like other pump and
dumps (such as a company called Straight Path Capital that doesn't actually exist). There is evidence of
insiders receiving millions of free or heavily discounted shares, just like other pump and dumps.


Based on all of that, I'm going to conclude it's a pump and dump, just like I concluded it's a duck. But
according to you, I can't call this a pump and dump based on all that information. If I were to use your
standards of evidence, I wouldn't be able to identify a duck, either.

You've got "pumping" but little else. Maybe there is fraud by the promoters, and Shell has done admirable
work in exposing some of them to scrutiny either to prove it or rule it out. However, I don't believe that most of
the principals of that company today are dumpers.


Your pump and dump conclusions are based on analogy, and your beneficiary lacks clean hands with its
conflict of interest. It is disclosed as if that cures it. It doesn't.

Where is the dump? Must prove it 
***********


Look at the chart. Look at the past charts of other stock promotions. The huge red candle you see IS the
dump. 
You argue like a creationist trying to attack evolution. Creationists will try to argue that, since nobody has
actually seen man evolving from a previous hominid, then there is no proof of evolution. Or because we may
not have fossils showing transitions between species, there is no proof of evolution. They fail to realize we
can infer evolution from numerous other lines of evidence, including genetic evidence, fossil record, etc.
These produce a convergence of evidence that we can safely form a conclusion that evolution is a fact. 
Likewise, you try to argue there is no pump and dump because there is no proof that an insider has sold
shares. I've shown you already that this is a very weak argument, because the insiders may not file they sold
their shares, or it may be the promoters selling shares (who won't have any filings). These guys have no
problems lying in their filings...look at how they claimed to have a deal with "Straight Path Capital" which
doesn't actually exist. Or how about all of the Chinese RTO's that have been caught lying about their numbers
in their filings (like CCME). You are WAY too trusting of the SEC filings, especially one trading on the OTCBB. 
Like evolution, we can safely infer this was a pump and dump by simply looking at the behavior of other
heavily promoted OTCBB stocks and how JAMN acts exactly the same. We also know the former CEO is a
known stock promoter who has been involved in past pump and dumps. We know that JAMN filed a Reg S
which is a typical scam used by pump and dumps. We know that there was a very heavy online 6-month
stock promotion for JAMN. We know that the intraday price action for JAMN resembles that of a paid
promotion. We know that JAMN rose to a ridiculous market cap, yet makes very little money, just like other
pump and dumps. We know that JAMN had a "hype" story like other pump and dumps. 
That's not all. We know that JAMN shares the same questionable auditor as other pump and dumps. We
know that the auditor has been found to have deficiencies by PCAOB. We know that JAMN shares the same
questionable attorney as other pump and dumps. We know that JAMN has ties to Vancouver, B.C., a known
haven for stock promoters, and where some individuals have been prosecuted for pump and dump securities
fraud. We know that JAMN shares the same transfer agent as other pump and dump operations. We know
that JAMN was the result of a reverse merger which is typical of pump and dump operations. 
Wake up man! How much more do you need to realize this is a pump and dump, and that a massive drop in
stock price was inevitable? You've got ALL of this evidence that this is a pump and dump, and you ignore all
of it simply because you don't have proof of an insider selling shares (when such "proof" often won't exist for a
pump and dump anyway). Talk about absurd!!!!! 
The bottom line, where there's smoke, there's fire. And there's A LOT of smoke here! Unfortunately, your
standard of evidence is so ridiculously high that you need to be standing in the flames to know that there's a
fire. Yet at the same time you will flimsily accuse an article of causing a drop in stock price based on no other
evidence other than timing, despite the fact that the massive drop in stock price is typical behavior of OTC
stock promotions. Talk about irony.

they do it on May 4th when they took the short position? Why risk a short squeeze or forced buy-in of your
short position, if all you need is an article to bring it down (according to you)? You failed to answer this
question.


And you also failed to answer the fact that JAMN has shown similar rapid price drops without any articles. You
failed to answer the fact that JAMN was already showing weakness before the article ever came out. You
failed to answer how I predicted that JAMN's dump was imminent based on the recent short squeeze and the
behavior of past pump and dump squeezes. I knew these would happen based on the fact it was a stock
promotion...it is a given that a stock promotion will have large price drops...it's just a matter of when it will
happen.


Basically, I have numerous pieces of evidence on my side. You don't...all you have is coincidental timing of an
article, which itself is flawed anyway.

Oh I know how to put together a puzzle, but some of them are manufactured by people with multiple
personalities and I just have to say that several of your misdirections and irrelevant points are a lot like one of
those puzzles. At least your smoke is intentional. Be glad.


See, you confuse JAMN with Whittle. They're not the same thing. The corporation is an artificial person to
whom Whittle owed a fiduciary duty. Same with its investors. As I said, go after Whittle, not JAMN. Seize his
accounts until responsibility can be assigned. But don't trash the company if it could redeem itself absent the
ponzis.

unlikelihood that the Marleys would want to couple their good name with a ponzi scheme,

I have to respond to this again because you're ignoring something obvious (I already pointed out how
Shaquille O'Neal was part of the NXTH pump).


Marley's name and image are being used in the pump ads. This has been going on for months. Even the
company knows it given the 8K they filed about the stock promotion. If Marley doesn't want his name
associated with this pump operation, why doesn't he take legal action against the promoters? They are using
his name and image, remember?

The fact that he hasn't taken any action tells me he certainly doesn't seem to mind the fact that stock
pumpers are using his name and image to promote this stock. That suggests to me complicity in it, especially
when he owns millions of shares at a heavily discounted price.

You asked why didn't the TheStreetSweeper.org publish their negative article on JAMN on May 4 when they
took a short position?


To avoid the appearance of manipulation is one . Another reason may be to benefit friends and family with the
specific time the report will go online.


26 May 2011, 03:54 AM


YngvaiMalmsteve
Wow, with that type of logic, it's no wonder why you lost money on this stock. Do you actually listen to what
you say?


"Avoid the appearance of manipulation"? Why would anyone want to risk a forced buy-in or major squeeze
(i.e., a major loss) just to avoid the appearance of manipulation?


"Benefit friends and family?" Again, why subject your friends and family to the risk of a forced buy-in or major
squeeze?


And you also ignored something else. Let's say your absurd reasons are valid (and anyone with a brain can
telll they aren't). That still doesn't tell us why they didn't release the article when JAMN hit $6 and they were at
a 100% loss on their short position.


It's also amazing how you invent these reasons out of thin air. Like I said, you will resort to ad hoc speculation
and mental gymnastics to force everything to fit your preformed conclusion, yet hypocritically demand hard
proof of SEC filings showing insider selling (when such proof often doesn't exist in pump and dumps, as I
showed in the one court case of some penny stock manipulators who were prosecuted). You are free to make
up such absurd reasons with no proof for them, yet demand hard proof from others. Your hypocrisy is
astounding.

Traders and investors,you should look at the long form 10-K and not the one from Yahoo web site.  
On Feb.5,2008 we incorporated a subsidiary of Marley Coffee,Inc. 
Read section 4 and 5 on the long form 10-K !  
It tell the real facts about company and still today,JAMN still haven't made a profit from 2008. 
Canterbury does buy the coffee beans and package them and shipped them to JAMN customers and distributors,but 
JAMN does provide the bags for their products to Canterbury. 
Go to fidelity.com to read the real 10-K long form!

JAMN did a foward stock split 3 for 1 for each share too! 
Everyone thinking about buying shares in JAMN should read the long form of 10-K. 
With a lease on a office with over $14,000 or more a year and than the CEO,who know what he his getting,free
coffee,if he drinks that bitter taste in your mouth. I agree with the writer. 
There competition are the top brands in the coffee world like Star Bucks,Green Mountaion Coffee,Peet
Coffee,Tullys,Seattle Best, 
and BABB with over 100 stores with P/E of 10.85 which trade at 65 cent a share. Oh,you have JVA and CBOU which
are to complete with. I could tell you more,but it's best that you read 10-K yourself. 
You should wait to see if earnings inproves or make a profit. 
READ THE 10-K and be wise before investing in JAMN! 
People are countings their pennies in these hard times and buy the most for there money. There are other top brands
that I left out. 
Very high risk investment for those that can't afford to their hard earn money. 
READ THE LONG FORM 10-K BEFORE INVESTING! 
Make sure you have the money to loose! 
I didn't like what I read and you might not like it too! 
Don't let others dicide for you in your investments! 
Don't let greed control you! 
If you get what you paid for JAMN,take it and break even. 
I'm not telling you to buy or sell these shares in this company,contact your local broker for legal advice. 
There are a lot of promoters that will say anything to get you to buy! 
You could call Jammin Java Corp. and to speak to someone in investor relations. Don't buy on Rumors! 
I neither long or short at this time!

This was the most honest comment from the article's evidence that I've seen. And its advice is sound at this
point.


However, there have been successful companies doing business under the radar for some time and not
profiting before finally making the promotional leap into the public consciousness with such things as the
Amazon sellout and the sort of actions recorded in the press releases on PR Newswire and elsewhere of new
distribution agreements and expanded marketing to stores and regions.


The killer would be if the JAMN company did not intend to follow through with the business that the
promotions ignited. Or were incompetent to do so. I don't see that evidence yet.


If that evidence materializes, then the company is everything Shell and company says it is. I don't see it yet.
Nor do I see TheStreetSweeper.org et al taking responsibility for being a financially interested party in the
media assault on JAMN beyond circulation -- into short selling investment IN JAMN. That is just
incomprehensible to me that anyone should overlook that and consider it acceptable.

Folks, IT IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY. Of course negative income and negative cash flow are part of the

hurricane in one region of the world will do little to harm them. It turns out that Jammin Java did recieve the $2 million
capital funding from Straight Path yesterday, check the 8k they filed today... I look forward to seeing this brand SOAR
throughout the remainder of this year, they've done the foot work and have built the infrastructure, otherwise, they
would not have the confidence of Straight Path Capital. Now it's time to market, sell, and grow! See you at $25+ a

No, I'm not.


You are exhibiting typical "blame the shorts" behavior. This is exactly what investors in CCME did when
evidence of fraud started to be revealed.


People were calling fraud on CCME a very long time ago, and the long investors wanted to hide their head in
the sand regarding it. CCME then dropped in price, and the long investors than wanted to blame the short
sellers and "hit pieces", all the while ignoring all of the evidence of fraud on CCME's part.


Finally, CCME got halted for months, and just recently reopened. The long investors lost tons of money. I bet
they wish now they had listened to the short sellers.

So you're saying it's unethical to expose pump and dumps or frauds? Wow.


Was it unethical for Jim Chanos to short Enron and point out the problems with Enron? Did that invalidate the
evidence against Enron? Strangely how you keep dodging this question that I've continued to ask of you.


Was it unethical for the people calling fraud on CCME to be short CCME? Did that invalidate their case

You have a lot to learn about the stock market (which is obvious given you're treating an OTCBB stock as an
investment). People who short stocks don't randomly pick a stock to short, try to find fraud, and then short it.
People short stocks when they realize there is fraud first, short it and expose it at the same time.


As I said earlier, you're getting caught up in the "blame the shorts" behavior. More likely, you are an investor
who didn't do enough DD on this stock and you got burned because of it, and you're looking for someone else
to point fingers at.

Oh, and have you even bothered to check out the past stock promotions and what happened to them? Again,

JAMN: Massive dump on 4/13, and then again 5/13 to 5/18. There was no article on 4/13. So who are you

BGBR (another Shane Whittle one...sound familiar?): Massive dump on 4/13 
HHWW: Massive dump on 12/13/10 
TNGS: Massive dump on 12/20 to 12/22/10, and again on 1/20 to 1/21/11 
FCPG: Massive dump on 12/10 
KYUS: Massive dump on 5/27/08 to 6/2/08 
NXTH: Massive dump on 10/27/09, again on 2/8/10 
KNKT: Massive dump on 3/1/11, again on 4/11 to 4/12 
SPLM: Massive dump on 3/9 to 3/10/11, again on 3/23 to 3/25/11

MSEH: Massive dump 3/23 to 3/25/10, then faded again after 3/31

Oh, and one more critical failure of your "short article conspiracy" idea...


Streetsweeper opened their short position at $2.98 on May 4th. If they wanted to bring the price down with an
article, why didn't they do it on May 4th? Why risk getting caught in a squeeze or be subject to a forced buy-in
if all you need is an article to bring the stock price down (at least according to you)? Why wait until the stock
is over $6 before bringing out an article?


On top of that, much of the information in the article was out there for anyone willing to do the DD, and it was
out there long before the stock dumped. They just brought it all the information into once place.

"JAMN: Massive dump on 4/13, and then again 5/13 to 5/18. There was no article on 4/13. So who are you

Oh, confabulating one, the 4/13 dump was nothing compared to the 5/16 and following dumps. NOTHING.
The period of 5/13 to 5/18 followed both innuendo-laced content and context on TheStreetSweeper and
Benzinga announcing the upcoming article and the article itself. So that's just a concession.


Then the Shell piece was dropped on everyone Sunday night 5/15 and the HEE-UGE drop happened Monday
morning 5/16/2011. It's indisputable, easily recognizable, and something you can't focus on for some reason.


I think you are so busy on this thread because you have something at stake and your conscience is bugging
you. I don't expect to see Whittle or Bell here, because I'm not even sure they have consciences, or that
maybe somehow they weren't seared into dysfunction by too many "hot stocks."


You can expose them all day long, but when you over shoot and start betting on their victim companies'
demise, that's unclean.


If TheStreetSweeper.org was really concerned about investors in JAMN then every document would have
been released when it was discovered to help the maximum number of people before their anticipated stock
price was . Instead, it was amassed, promoted then unleashed the Sunday night before the opening bell,
giving investors very little time to make sense of what was happening.


BTW, you can take issue with J. Shell about referring to people trading on the OTCBB as investors. Shell
used that term to refer to JAMN shareholders in her 2 pieces on JAMN.

It's amusing how you keep shifting the goalposts. First, you try to claim that the article caused the drop,
merely because of the coincidental timing (post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy). Yet you have no evidence that
people were selling because of the article (although you strangely demand hard evidence that the pumpers
are dumping).


I then point out that the stock already was showing weakness before the article came out. I also pointed out
that it had a massive drop from the 6's to low 4's within 30 minutes (over a 30% drop in price) on Thursday
before the article came out. Obviously this thing could have massive drops without any article.


You then shifted the goalposts and tried to claim that the weakness was due to anticipation of the article
coming out. But you were incorrect there too, because the stock actually rose when the buzz about the article
was first generated.


You also ignored the fact that I predicted the massive drop on that Friday, and had no idea there was a
pending article coming out for Monday. Again, it's because I know what happens to these OTCBB pumps.


The massive drop was inevitable. It would've happened with an article or no article. Massive drops are
inevitable on every single OTCBB stock promotion. It is the nature of stock promotions. It is because the
stock has been artificially elevated in price by the promoters, and there is nothing to hold the price up when
the promoters decide to let it go. That is why every single OTCBB promotion shows the same patterns like I
told you to go investigate (which I doubt you have bothered to do). This is also why Tim Sykes loves to short
these promotions because he knows the massive drop is inevitable.


The drop on JAMN was inevitable, and you're just looking for a scapegoat for the drop.

YngridMalmSteve:


The pretense to professional due diligence you alluded to above is tainted by the fact that it slimes legitimate
JAMN company players and the coffee company itself with promoters' excesses without proving that the
company paid the promoters.


You defend that by the rhetorical question rooted in the mass appeal fallacy: if others did it, can it be wrong?
Yes, it can.


Due diligence is when an investor does research prior to deciding whether to purchase a stock, and if so, how
much exposure to undertake.


The investigative article by Janice Shell would have been straight financial journalism or DD were it not for the
fact that her publishers had a financial interest in the drop in the price of the stock she focused on: JAMN.


The charts show the distinct reaction to the report of Sunday night with the greatest drop in price the JAMN
stock had ever seen from Monday morning May 16 throughout the week.


Financial media daily attribute large drops in the indices and in sectors on charts coinciding with various
pieces of news of the day. Although investors are not surveyed specifically, their mass behavior is given the
most likely concurring news explanation. Yet you discount all of this.


In part, the fall was a correction of the over-promotion, but the piece was going for destruction, not mere
correction. The piece was promoted in advance without specifics as a piece by a "warrior against fraud" on a
news source impliedly cleaning up corruption, just sweeping it off Wall Street. Yet the accuser corrupted itself
by holding a position against a stock it pretended to have a journalistic interest in. That isn't "due diligence"
but it is bad ethics.


Due diligence for me was not what promoters or anti-promoters were saying about the stock, but what the
company was doing to develop business, plus its brand, niche, and its notoriety.

to drop).

Huh? "Pretended" to have journalistic interest in? How can you know whether the journalistic interest was true
or not? Just because the publisher's members had a short position?


Again, I will keep asking the same questions of you. Did the fact that people were short CCME invalidate their
case against CCME?


Did the fact that Chanos was short Enron invalidate his case against Enron?


Why do you evade these questions?

if this is a pump and dump it is a different path than i have seen before. sometimes a penny stock is actually a good
deal. my girlfriend was a pro with a large firm in the 80s. she was the one that brought this stock to my attention with
the advice to trade the heck out of it. so far it is piling up cash in my account for me. the volatility is great.  
since this article came out we have looked much harder and i continued trading it. if it has appeared in the penny
pumpers anytime lately i cannot find it. this is also the first time i have seen or heard of the street sweeper. i am not
taking a side on this. i say let the contoversy and volatility continue.  
on one side it always pays to be skeptical of any stock and any letter. on the other side this is some of the easiest
quickest money i have ever made trading.  
on monday morning i will look to see indications for the market's movement. then i will look at the pre market on jamn.
if it looks to me like there is another $500 or $1000 to make on the day i will buy it again.  
mvis is a r&d company. they have a good product if they can ever get the thing to market. there was a hit article on sa
a few years back. it crushed mvis for awhile. when sa started looking into the author they could not quite pinpoint him.
sometimes i suspect investment u is doing a bit of pumping for the money map report and the oxford club to squeeze
a bit of gain before the two give a sell order to their payed subscribers.  
remember the flash crash. the big firms burned themselves with their high speed computers. pg is a great stock that
got hammered down. the next day the sec announced they were going to undo the trades. if you think the sec is
trustable then maybe you trust government and politicians. please, the big guys that make the big political donations
get a re-do? 
then there is the latest on silver. maybe it was bubblish. it is odd how the requirments on margins were raised so
rapidly and so many times. i was hoping it would get shoved down into the $20 range. that would be a price to go
back to the coin shops over. 
i'm sorry but we are minnows swimming with sharks, pirhanna, and barracudas. if you look for integrity in this fish tank
you end up as predator fish droppings. 
perhaps street sweeper is a great publisher. i cannot say one way or the other. observation over the years makes me
believe there are very few articles and publications that are out there that do not have a financial motivation. 
i intend to take what i can get. at this point i am no longer trading jamn with my own money.  
on sa i would suggest you look for articles by old trader. there is no apparent conflict. i do believe he is that most rare
creature that is simply sharing his experience because i also believe he is a pretty good guy. 
i will say again good luck to all.

So if YOU started a company and listed it on the OTCBB... I could gather a few paid stock promoters together and
organize a pump and dump operation without you/the company ever knowing or having anything to do with it... Right?
If thats the case, then how is JAMN to blame for anything to do with the value dropping like it did? 
Just so you guys don't think your argument is going unnoticed ;-) One things for sure, both of you make valid
arguments. In a Steve is right about it being a pump and dump only based on the characteristics, and what you call
"looking like a duck." but Longviewer also is right about there being evidence of pumping, yeah... but none of the
dumping. i.e. Longviewers assertion has more depth to it.  
Also, if this "straight path limited" company really doesn't exist, and the jammin java company is filing papers with the
SEC as if it does... Wouldn't there knowingly be serious penalties imposed on the directors of JAMN for that? Just
because you can't find a company online doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Just saying.

Actually his assertion has no depth to it because he is unaware of how OTCBB pump and dump operations
work. The vast majority of the time, there are no filings of the insiders selling. But if he knew anything about
the OTCBB, he would have known that.


In fact, here is a successful SEC prosecution of a group of people involved in an OTCBB pump and dump
operation back in 2006 and 2007. The head of the operation was just sentenced to jail in 2011...which shows
you how long it takes for these guys to be brought to justice, and why so many OTCBB pumpers and
dumpers get away with it and fly under the radar.


www.wgmd.com/?p=24928......


There were no filings of insiders selling like Longviewer demands, yet these people were prosecuted.
Longviewer needs to reassess how he determines whether something is a pump and dump.

Companies lie in their SEC filings all the time and get away with it. Look at all of the Chinese RTOs that were
lying in their SEC filings for years before finally getting caught. It's even more frequent on the OTCBB. The
SEC is severely understaffed is often slow to act, if it will act at all, so these companies will often lie in their
filings because they can get away with it.


The bottom line is that it is obvious JAMN lied in its filing. In one filing, it says Straight Path was registered in
the UK. In another filing, it says it is registered in the Cayman Islands. Both statements cannot be true. And

Let's look at that statement. It assumes every pumped stock is a pump and dump conspiracy. I think that is
overbroad.


And the JAMN insiders have filed documents reflecting their sales.

Every OTCBB/pink sheet stock (note I say the stock, not the company) being promoted online or by mailers
IS a pump and dump conspiracy. The reason people do stock promotions is to pump the price of their stock
up, so they can sell shares into the pumping.


There was a very heavy online stock promotion for JAMN from sites like hackthestockmarket and
TheLautnerLetter. There was also the fictional "John Bell" sending his JAMN "pick" to his subscribers, and
then whenever he would get a new set of subscribers, he would announce a new pick which would simply
turn out to be JAMN again. The new subscribers had no idea that he had the exact same pick for his old
subscribers. All of this automatically makes it a pump and dump.

I already told you those aren't the dumps. But you still don't get it. It doesn't seem awfully suspicious that
someone would sell millions of shares for practically nothing, and still hold a big portion? It's part of the whole
operation...the insiders giving promoters or other insiders millions of shares for free. Again, this is typical of
pump and dumps before the pumping happens. These types of filings have been seen for many of the other
OTCBB pump and dump operations that I listed. If you ever bothered to actually investigate and learn about
these operations, you would know that.


23 May 2011, 06:59 PM


Longviewer
If the insiders aren't doing the dumping, and so long as the company is developing its business, neither the
company or the good faith investors deserve to have vultures taking advantage of the wrongdoing of those
promoters and profiting from it while playing the finger pointing judge benefiting from your verdict.


I don't think it's any more ethical than the promoters who promote and dump. Sure, what you do is legal, but it
kills small business concerns trying to get going. It really begs a counter-investigation to rule out whether
larger interested parties may be involved in trying to snuff out scary looking startups with brand power. It
wouldn't be beyond the pale historically. Another question in this vein, is, is this or is this not a legitimate
brand, and is THIS coffee from Jamaica as advertised? See here and scroll down to read the description:


www.marleycoffee.com/t...-mountain®-whole-bean-...


And those promoters' websites had disclaimers too, just like the one stinking up the bottom of the Shell piece.

the short investment of her employer or publisher before posting?

read through his comments it is not hard to see. beware of posters too. sa is a good site but be wary of
everything in the markets. 
usually a pump and dump falls below or at least down to where it started. jamn for now seems to have settled
down to the $2 range. it should quickly be aproaching 10 cents to behave like a pump and dump.  
steve, janice and street athority have done nothing illegal. maybe a little shady but they are at least as good
as the p&d promotors. we are swimming with sharks friend. some are baby sharks. it could be argued that
playing the bounces as i did was predatory. maybe it was.

It takes a lot longer for a pump and dump to return to such low levels. Typically there are bounces and slow
fades as time goes on.


Check out KNKT. Originally pumped from under $1 to near $3. Major fall was on 3/1. However, it did not fall
back under $1 until 4/12.


HHWW was pumped from under $1 to over $3. Major dump was on 12/13. It then bounced around and did
not fall under $1 until 2/8. It then bounced back above $1 for a while and didn't hit 50 cents until 4/6.


FCPG was pumped from under $1 to nearly $6. Major dump was on 12/10. It then hovered near $2 for 2
months after that. It didn't fall under $1 until April.


Sorry, bud, but you're wrong about what happens to pump and dumps. They don't immediately drop back to
10 cents. JAMN could very well lounge in the 2 range for a month or two before fading back under $1.

i have to give you this one. my experience with p&d is limited. i usually just delete the mailers. my interests

you keep making long lists of other stocks. my limited observation draws different conclusions about p&d. i
won't put the time in them that you seem to. so i am willing to temper my theory. so you do not believe jamn
will fall at least to the start of the alledged p&d? i think you said around 50 or 55 cents. you give it roughly
between six weeks and 4 months to fall to 1$?

you should use less insult and name calling if you want people to listen to you. at least you do not resort to

you are just trying to help so until there is proof of a different motive i can adapt my theory to that.  
since my gf was mostly into trading penny stocks for her firm in the form of client pools such as the
businessman's pool or the doctor's pool, etc.. i will continue to follow her advice when she points one out and
says trade this stock. 
as far as i am concerned the jury is still out on jamn. i will decide to trade it again or just stay out with further
observation and adjustment to my theory.  
i really did enjoy the wiki....link. i have been through that argument before. my theory is that scientists resent
the straight talk of calling a spade a spade. welfare recipients do not like their gifts of government largesse to
be called handouts. monarchs do not like to hear about inbreeding.  
obviously i did not spend much time on typing. lol. i was self taught and my teacher was sorely lacking.

top but didn't, and I even cancelled my stop order (they can't pick me off). I wish I had bought more when it dropped
because I doubt we will see those levels again. If we do, fine. I'll buy more shares. I'm very impressed with the
company and its management....and especially its product.

I'm not pleased with the public accounting oversight reviews of the company's accounting firms. The new business
development is still significant, and the Marley Coffee element is still there. Rohan Marley has not fled or dumped or
whatever.


The company has to prove itself, and its directors and officers have to execute. That's the only way to beat the bad
associations with promoters.


As for press releases, if they are announcing real business development, then I think it is relevant. All companies post
press releases updating potential investors on what progress the company is making. To ignore such reports just
because promoters want us to pay attention would be a mistake as well.
