About Spruce Point Capital Management


Spruce Point believes change is required at Maxar Technologies (Nasdaq/TSX: MAXR). Based on our research, we 


believe CEO Howard Lance should resign for inflating Maxar’s earnings through an aggressive M&A accounting 


scheme, and omitting key details from his biography that would have cautioned investors about his track record of 


overseeing companies that later admitted material weakness of internal controls and required accounting restatement.

Spruce Point Has Succeeded In 
Canadian Shareholder Activism


Spruce Point has written four critical activist reports in Canada. In a majority of the cases, the share price has met or 


exceeded our downside estimate of intrinsic value. The average share price decline is 57%. A common theme is that 


Canadian analysts don’t ask difficult questions of management, challenge assumptions, and are overly optimistic.

flawed and unjustly enriches 
insiders


• Questionable financial reporting

forthcoming decline in the 
geostationary satellite industry


• Brazen accounting scheme including 
inflation of intangible assets to 
overstated Non-IFRS EPS


• Dangerously levered at 5.8x when 
taking into account off-balance sheet 
liabilities make Maxar’s dividend at 
high risk of being cut or eliminated

Successful 
Outcome

review upon the report release


• Feb 2016, CEO FitzGerald resigns 
from Intertain (source)

our conclusions, yet its share price 
lingers near a multi-year low


• The Company also clarified its capital 
allocation strategy, and suggested 
that debt pay was a priority, leaving 
the safety of the dividend in question
(source)


• On Oct 31, Maxar reported 
impairment losses of $383.6m –
validating our concerns (source)

• No strategic alternatives for maximizing its value
• Synergies are a show me story
• Capex will remain >$300m per year

Spruce Point Believes Maxar Technologies (MAXR) 
Is A “Strong Sell” With 100% Downside Risk


Prelude To A Disaster: MacDonald Dettwiler’s Failed Levered Acquisition of Space Systems Loral (SSL)


Acquisition of SSL Poorly Timed: Acquired in 2012 when demand for geostationary satellites was robust, industry demand and backlog 
has dried up as orders decline as a result of new high-throughput satellites and low-earth-orbit (LEO) constellations coming online


Obfuscation of Gross Margins and R&D Costs: MDA never provided clear disclosures about its satellite manufacturing gross margins. R&D 
costs have been buried as footnotes in its intangible asset account disclosures. Recent disclosure of contract losses tied to engineering 
costs suggest percentage-of-completion accounting abuse, a common issue in the aerospace and defense industry


Signs To Suggest $50m/yr of Earnings Overstatement Through Aggressive Intangible Asset Capitalization: MDA’s dependency on intangible 
asset capex grew significantly, and it capitalizes a materially higher % as in-process technology than peers. Capex to depreciation is 
running at 2x now vs. SSL pre-acquisition by MDA


Cash Flow Issues: From 2012-2017 average adjusted free cash flow was $30m and includes periods where MDA reported bank overdrafts 
as a result of cash deficiencies. Rising orbital receivables and DSOs, conversion of accounts receivables into notes payable from 
customers, and a material increase of accounts receivables due past 90 days all signal financial strain


Rapid Management / Director Turnover: MDA’s CEO, audit committee chair, and chief technology officer at SSL all resigned leading up to 
its eventual hiring of new CEO Howard Lance, who has an unremarkable past in our opinion 


Warning: Maxar’s New CEO Howard Lance Associated With Multiple Companies Requiring Financial Restatement 


Lance’s Failures: Lance is a former Group COO/President of NCR, a successful Spruce Point campaign that fell 40% after we highlighted 
numerous accounting concerns, and it failed to find a buyer after a strategic process. He was also the Chairman of the Board at Change 
Healthcare Holdings through 2017 and Harris Stratex (Nasdaq: HSTX, now called Aviat Networks (AVNW)). Both companies blindsided 
investors when informing them that the financial statements could not be relied upon, and material weaknesses of controls existed


Dennis Chookaszian (MAXR Audit Chair through Feb 2018): Has served as a Director at Career Education (during FTC inquiry/restatement), 
Sapient (material weaknesses disclosed), and Prism (formerly Internet Patent Brands, a penny stock promote with delinquent filings)


Insiders Having Nothing At Risk: Ownership by insiders at MDA declined every year to virtually zero. Post the DigitalGlobe acquisition, 
insiders own a miniscule 0.50% of the stock, and have mislead investors about bonus compensation targets being tied to cash flow

Strained by the levered acquisition of Space Systems Loral in 2012 at the cycle peak, MacDonald Dettwiler’s (MDA) acquisition of


DigitalGlobe (DGI) in 2017 was done out of necessity to cover-up growing accounting and financial strains. Rebranded Maxar 


Technologies (MAXR), the combined company has pulled one of the most aggressive accounting schemes Spruce Point has ever 


seen to inflate Non-IFRS earnings by 79%. However, with end markets weakening, and burdened by $3.7 billion of rising debt with 


almost no cash and free cash flow, Maxar must eliminate its dividend immediately, or risk wiping out equity holders.

Is A “Strong Sell” With 100% Downside Risk


3 Why MDA/DigitalGlobe > Maxar Technologies Appears To Be Complete Bust: 


Already Failing To Hit Projections: MDA historically didn’t give guidance, but projections from the May 2017 proxy statement from the 
DigitalGlobe acquisition show the combined company has performed miserably, and is missing internal expectations


Engaging In A Massive M&A Accounting Scheme To Cover Past Problems: In Feb 2017, management said it didn’t identify any material 
inconsistencies in DigitalGlobe’s financials between GAAP and IFRS. It then backtracked and revised financials that artificially inflated 
revenues by 4-6% and EBITDA by double digits. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg. We previously illustrated our concern that 
MDA appeared to be overcapitalizing costs by inflating intangible asset purchases. Thus, it came as no surprise to us when Maxar used the 
DigitalGlobe acquisition to inflate intangible assets even further. However, the $1.1 billion inflation was an order of magnitude that 
shocked us. MDA made reference to DigitalGlobe’s “world leading (satellite) constellation” as a strategic rationale of the acquisition – yet 
it impaired the satellite assets at deal closing, and inflated its intangible asset accounts by a commensurate $1.1 billion


Nonsensical Earnings That Conveniently Ignore Acquired Intangible Expenses: By impairing a depreciable asset and inflating intangibles, 
Maxar claims its Non-IFRS measures should exclude acquired intangibles. In our opinion, MAXR’s 2018 Adj. EPS expectation of $4.75/sh is 
pure fiction. Maxar has made numerous aggressive accounting choices (now extending depreciable asset lives twice in Q1 and Q2’18 for 
the same satellites it visibly impaired) which inflate results. We estimate EBITDA and EPS are overstated by 17% and 79%, respectively


Numerous One-Time Gains Being Used, Some In A Non-Transparent Manner: It appears Maxar has accelerated recognition of investment 
tax credits, and amended its post-retirement benefit plan to book one-time gains. In the case of the benefit plan gain, Maxar booked a 
$24.6m gain in Q4’17 (flattering EBITDA by 13.5%), which was not fully disclosed across its investor communications, nor do we believe 
analysts have adjusted their models to account for it. As a result, we believe Maxar will have a large headwind in Q4’18 and disappoint


Abrupt CFO Departure A Bad Omen, New CFO Tainted: In February 2018, CFO William McCombe abruptly resigned less than 10 days 
before the March 2018 Investor Day. Former MDA CFO Wirasekara was appointed interim CFO until announcing Biggs Porter would join as 
CFO in July. Biggs is currently the subject of a shareholder lawsuit for his role as CFO at Fluor Corp where it’s claimed he misled investors 


DigitalGlobe A Ticking Time Bomb, Bull Case Likely To Disappoint: Maxar’s bull case for DigitalGlobe is predicated on two pillars: 
1) Its contract with the National Geospace Agency (NGA) is priced too cheaply and is due for a price increase, and 
2) There’s a huge opportunity for DGI outside of the U.S. government. Our work completed to date suggests both pillars seem unrealistic: 
it appears that DigitalGlobe is more likely to see prices decreases on the NGA contract and opportunities outside of the U.S. government 
seem limited, and have never lived up to expectations dating back to DigitalGlobe’s IPO

Is A “Strong Sell” With 100% Downside Risk

The Case For Maxar Being Worthless And Bankruptcy Bound: 


Management Has Lost Credibility With Analysts: The current street consensus projections are well below management’s combined 
company projections filed in the deal proxy statement a year ago in June 2017. Prior to filing the projections, management touted it had a 
strong order backlog, and great long-term revenue visibility. Yet, we estimate YTD -12.7% organic revenue decline at MDA


Management Has Lost Credibility With Investors: DigitalGlobe’s U.S. investors received stock in Maxar and owned ~34% at closing. When 
looking at the pro forma shareholder base today, it is evident that DigitalGlobe investors have not embraced the acquisition and have 
been heavy sellers of the stock, while Canadian investors remain cheerfully optimistic


Yet Street Analysts Are Still Too Optimistic, Seeing 37% Upside: Hope springs eternal. Not surprisingly, the majority of analysts are “Buy” 
on Maxar’s stock, even though management’s projections have proven overly optimistic and it has used blatantly aggressive accounting 
to bolster results. Most of Maxar’s analysts remain legacy Canadian brokers from its days as MDA, and we don’t believe they have an 
appreciation for DigitalGlobe’s pending struggles. We expect a substantial re-rating lower in the share price once they realize that Maxar’s 
“earnings” are really just accounting magic


Deleveraging Plan Is A Fantasy And The Dividend Must Be Eliminated: Maxar is claiming it will deleverage and drive higher cash flow, but 
the numbers tell a different story: leverage is rising and cash overdrafts are being reported! In addition to a large interest expense and 
capex burden (which we believe will remain at $300m+/yr as opposed to declining per management), Maxar is committed to a $68m/yr
dividend and must pay down $25m/yr of its Term Loan B. These means it has no excess cash flow to accelerate debt reduction. Maxar is 
borrowing money to pay the dividend. Maxar should immediately cut or eliminate the dividend and direct capital towards debt reduction


Covenant Breach Possible, $2bn Goodwill and Intangible Impairment Looms: Based on accepted analytical credit adjustments made by 
Maxar’s rating agency Moody’s, and reasonable year end projections, we estimate Maxar’s leverage of 5.8x will effectively exceed its 
leverage of 5.5x covenant by year end. On June 2018, Maxar was downgraded to B1/stable (and is BB negative by S&P)


Newly Disclosed $227m Damages Sought By Ukraine: For the first time in Q2’18, Maxar disclosed a Ukrainian customer filed its statement 
of claim in connection with an arbitration seeking recovery from the Company under a contract in the amount of approximately $227 
million. Given Maxar’s strained liquidity, an adverse judgement could be a material adverse event in a worst case


Up To 100% Long-Term Downside On Normalized Financials: Maxar trades at 10.5x and 43x on our normalized 2018E Adj. EBITDA and EPS 
for a business we estimate is declining organically 12.7%, and dangerously levered 5.8x. Valued on its free cash flow, expected to produce 
$0-$50m, Maxar could be viewed as worthless. Using below industry average P/E and EBITDA multiples to reflect Maxar’s distressed state 
and specious financial statements, we estimate an intermediate trading range of $20.00-$25.00 per share (45%-55% downside)

Spruce Point’s Realistic View of MAXR’s 
EBITDA And EPS vs. Fantasy View


US$ in millions 2018E Note


Analyst Consensus EBITDA $718.0 Bloomberg consensus, revised lower recently from $730m


Less: Overcapitalization of Intangible Assets ($50.0)
Our analysis shows that MDA excessively capitalizes technology development costs, which 
enables EPS overstatement. Normalizing results to industry peers suggests $50.0m 


Less: DigitalGlobe Accounting Change 
To Impute Interest


($70.7)
At deal announcement, Management said it didn't find any material accounting changes to 
DigitalGlobe, only to backtrack and inflate EBITDA. Run-rate benefit of $70.7m as of last 
disclosed pro forma analysis in Q3’17


Spruce Point Adjusted EBITDA
Discount vs. Consensus


$597.3
17%


Less: Depreciation and Amortization Expense ($218.0)
Midpoint of original guidance range pre-revisions in Q1 and Q2’18. Our analysis shows that 
management said there would be no revision, yet backtracked and made two depreciation 
changes lower. In our opinion, the change was purely to deflect underlying weakness


Less: Depreciation Expense Disguised As Acquisition 
Intangible Expense


($86.9)
We found management impaired DigitalGlobe PP&E and inflated intangibles. This moved 
$1.1bn of depreciable expenses (wtd. Avg. useful life of 11.5yrs) and classified it as 
acquisition intangibles (which management conveniently wants investors to ignore)


Less: Net Interest Expense ($197.5) Midpoint of management’s guidance, which went down in Q2’18 by $10m 


Less: Stock-based Compensation Expense ($25.0) MAXR provides no guidance, but we estimate $20-$30m and use $25m as our midpoint


Profit Before Tax Expense $69.9


Tax Expense at 14% ($9.8) Midpoint of management’s guidance range 13%-15%


Net Income
Avg. Diluted Shares Outstanding


Spruce Point Adjusted EPS


$60.1
58.5


$1.03


Much closer to our analysis that MAXR’s generates little free cash flow
MAXR increased its share count guidance in Q2 from 57m to 58.5m shares outstanding


MAXR Inflated EPS Guidance Range
Analyst Consensus View
Spruce Point EPS Reality vs. Inflated Consensus


$4.65 – $4.85
$4.81
-79%


Isn’t it surprising that analysts’ consensus view falls in the middle of MAXR’s guidance? Also
despite lower interest and depreciation expense by a combined $20m in Q2’18, Maxar did 
not raise its full year Adj EPS guidance range. We believe none of the analysts have 
conducted a forensic review of earnings quality


In our opinion, MAXR’s 2018 Adj. EPS expectation of $4.75/sh is pure fiction. The Company has made 


numerous aggressive accounting choices that inflate its Non-IFRS results. Based on our forensic review, we 


estimate EBITDA and EPS are overstated by 17% and 79%, respectively

Maxar’s Comparisons To NCR Corp, 
A Successful Spruce Point Campaign

Company Claimed Leverage / Actual Adj. Leverage 4.0x / 5.8x 3.6x / 5.3x


Shareholder Hope
Combined synergies, and now strategic alternatives

expensive dilution to shareholders  (source 1,2, 3)


CEO Concerns
CEO Howard Lance was Group COO/President of NCR 
(2001-2003) and has obscured his roles at two 
companies requiring accounting restatement


CEO Nuti came from Symbol Technologies,where executives were 
charged with Fraud. He failed to execute a turnaround


Creative M&A And Other Accounting To
Embellish Financial Results


EBITDA and EPS are estimated to be overstated by 
17% and 79% through aggressively capitalized 
intangible asset capex on the balance sheet, and has 
used the DigitalGlobe M&A deal to further inflate 
intangibles and avoid depreciation expense


EBITDA and EPS estimated to be overstated by 42% and 60% with 
various tactics to book one-time gains, under-reserve for losses, 
and hide struggles collecting receivables. 
Used the Digital Insight acquisition to creatively boost margins 
from 4%-6% to 29%


Desperate Tactics Used With Pension And 
Post-Retirement Changes


Buried a one-time $24.6m settlement gain in EBITDA 
in Q4’17 from a post-retirement plan change


Changed pension accounting to inflate metrics


Inflation of Free Cash Flow

classifying interest expense as a financing expense


Overstates free cash flow by misclassifying pension 
and settlement costs


Factoring to Generate Liquidity Q3’16: Started a $400m securitization facility Nov 2014: Started a $200m securitization facility


Problems In Foreign Countries
Q2’18: Maxar discloses that a Ukraine customer
dispute is seeking $227m in damages


Mid 2014, NCR disclosed a tax issue in Brazil related to imports 
that it said it would appeal; initially it could not quantify the 
problem, but now estimates a range of loss to be $0 - $66m 


Insider Alignment With Shareholders Insiders own just 0.50% of shares Insiders own just 0.40% of shares


Maxar’s CEO Howard Lance was a President and Group COO of NCR from 2001-2003. Maxar exhibits nearly identical problems 


and aggressive accounting tactics we identified at NCR Corp in our report from 2015, a stock that collapsed 40% to $18 per share


months after our report when it failed to find any strategic alternatives except heavy dilution and expenses to investors.

Background on MacDonald 
Dettwiler: The Ticking Time Bomb
14


Summary of Spruce Point’s Concerns At 
MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA):


Concern Evidence


Order Backlog


• Order backlog has been in perpetual organic decline since acquiring SSL in 2012
• Maxar stopped providing disclosure on SSL/Communication backlog contribution in 2017
• Capex spending is being cut by customers
• Two restructurings already announced 


Obfuscation of Gross Margins
• MDA has historically not provided enough detail to analyze its SSL/Communication segment gross 


profit, a key measure for a manufacturing company
• Mysterious reclassification of cost of sales expenses accounts in 2013/14 without explanation


Aggressive Capitalization of Costs 
Through Intangible Asset Purchases


• Benchmarking analysis points to aggressive purchasing of intangibles and abnormal accounting for 
intangibles as technology in process


• Capex to depreciation ratio running at 2x now vs. SSL pre-acquisition by MDA 


Obfuscation of R&D Costs, 
Contract Loss Recognition


• MDA does not clearly break-out R&D costs in the operating cost disclosures of its income statement. 
Instead, it buries these costs in its intangible asset section of reporting


• MDA has not been transparent about contract loss provisions, but in 2016 finally disclosed a $7.5m 
charge tied to development and engineering costs


• In Q2’18 disclosed that Ukraine is seeking $227m of damages


Inability to Generate Consistent 
Free Cash Flow 


• Rising orbital receivables and DSOs
• Conversion of accounts receivables into notes payable from customers
• Material increase of accounts receivables due past 90 days
• From 2012-2017 average adjusted free cash flow was $30m and includes periods where MDA 


reported bank overdrafts as a result of cash deficiencies


Management Turnover
• CTO and President of SSL resigned
• Head of Audit Committee resigned
• CEO Friedmann resigns and leaves Board earlier than planned


Based on Spruce Point’s forensic review of MDA, it appears the Company was not only struggling to cope with the levered 


acquisition of Space Systems Loral (SSL), but also using aggressive financial presentation and accounting methods to deflect its


underlying problems of order declines as new high-throughput satellites and low-earth-orbit (LEO) constellations come online.

Source: Loral and MDA and market figures


The satellite industry is notoriously cyclical. We believe MDA incorrectly acquired Space Systems Loral with 


leverage near the peak of the latest cycle. Given the strong relationship between its satellite order book and 


revenues, MDA management was facing more than a 50% drop in its revenues. Given the high fixed cost base of 


the business, Maxar faces large financial losses. We believe these factors may have lead management to use 


overly aggressive accounting methods to inflate performance, and seek the DigitalGlobe acquisition as a last 


ditch effort to save a sinking ship.

Maxar’s Order Backlog In Perpetual Decline


Our analysis of Maxar’s order backlog reveals two key insights: 1) Its backlog has shown no positive organic 


growth since 2012 when adjusting for the acquisitions of SSL and DigitalGlobe, and 2) Maxar stopped providing a 


breakdown of order backlog by segment, rendering it impossible to track SSL/Communications.  Maxar has 


already initiated two restructurings in 2017 and 2018 and combined backlog is down. (1)

MDA Has Always Obscured Its 
Gross Profit From Satellite Manufacturing


Source: Company 2015 Annual Report


A majority of MDA’s business is the manufacturing of satellites. The Company has never given investors a clear 


picture as to what are the direct and indirect manufacturing costs related to this business, so that investors can 


understand trends in its gross margin. Instead, MDA aggregates direct costs with SG&A in a confusing format.

Obfuscating Contract Losses


It appears that Maxar has not been transparent about the size of its contract losses until recently. We remind investors that


Maxar uses the “percentage of completion” method of revenue recognition. This gives management discretion to aggressively 


recognize revenues, and/or underestimate costs to inflate earnings. Only after management estimates indicate that it is probable


that total contract costs including allocation of overhead will exceed contract revenue on a construction contract upon 


completion, a provision for the expected loss is recognized immediately in the period in which the loss becomes evident. (1)


Now Maxar is enhancing disclosure about potential losses tied to Ukraine amounting to $227m.

Recent “Percentage of Completion” 
Accounting Scandals In Aerospace


Date Company/Industry Accounting Problems


8/10/16
Orbital ATK /


Aerospace & Defense


The misstatements which the Company has identified relate primarily to its $2.3 billion long-term contract (the “Contract”) 
with the U.S. Army to manufacture and supply small caliber ammunition at the U.S. Army’s Lake City Army Ammunition Plant.  
The Contract, which is accounted for under the percentage of completion revenue recognition method, is managed by the 


Small Caliber Systems Division within the Defense Systems Group. The Contract was entered into in September 2012 and is for 
a term of up to 10 years (an initial term of seven years plus three additional years at the option of the Army); the Company 


now believes that the Contract will result in a net loss over its 10-year term.  Under generally accepted accounting principles,
the Company is required to record the entire anticipated forward loss provision for a contract in the period in which the loss 


becomes evident.


4/16/16
Cobham / Aerospace 


& Defense


The British engineer was rocked by a financial scandal in one of its electronics divisions. Cobham’s accounting irregularities 
happened in its wireless division, which makes equipment for mobile operators such as Vodafone. Bosses had discovered that 
the unit had been booking profits before it should. The company booked a GBP 9m charge and issued a profit warning. The 


CEO also resigned


4/3/15
Toshiba / 


Diversified Electronics


Toshiba said it will appoint a committee to investigate possible problems with accounting methods used for infrastructure 
projects in fiscal year 2013. The panel will examine the “reasonableness of estimates” when using the percentage-of-


completion accounting method for some projects


7/31/14
L3 Communications /  
Aerospace & Defense


Problems related "primarily" to a Defense Department contract running from December 2010 to January 2015. L-3 said the 
employees involved had overstated sales and inappropriately deferred cost overruns in their internal reporting on the 


contract. The deal involved maintenance and logistics for a fleet of 190 Army transport aircraft for the Army Materiel 
Command, according to Pentagon contract records. There was no initial indication that the alleged fraud inflated the 


Pentagon's costs. A fifth employee linked to the contract resigned. The Company currently expects to incur an aggregate pre-
tax charge of $84m against operating income and a related reduction in net sales of ~$43m


2/12/14
Cubic Corp /  


Aerospace & Defense


The error identified resulted from an error in a revenue recognition model used to record revenue for this contract, that 
was created during the previous restatement activity. In the course of its review, management also identified a second error 


related to this same contract that resulted from a failure to accurately update the contract value that is used in the 
calculation of revenue under the cost-to-cost percentage of completion method of accounting.


There are numerous examples of accounting errors and scandals tied to misestimating revenues and costs with 


long-term projects, especially in the Communications, Aerospace and Defense sector.

Note: Capitalized Development Costs are additions to intangible assets for Thales and Airbus. Airbus capitalized amounts mainly related to the H160 and Single Aisle NEO programs; Thales capitalized 
amounts mainly relate to Aerospace and Security activities, for which the products developed are relatively generic and can be sold to a larger number of potential customers.

MDA’s Developed and In Process Technologies To Gross Intangible Assets Grew Every Year Pre-Maxar


Is Maxar a world leading technology company, or does the evidence strongly suggest aggressive capitalization of 


technology development costs to inflate earnings? Spruce Point believes the evidence suggests earnings 


inflation. Maxar’s competitors on average ascribe 19% of intangibles to technology, not >50%. 


By normalizing MAXR’s results to peers, we estimate $50m of annual overcapitalization of intangibles. (1)


1) 19% of 2016 Gross Intangibles ($512m) =$97m. Take the current technology and in process account of $299 and deduct $97m = $201m. Divide $201 by four to reflect the four 
years leading up to the DigitalGlobe acquisition =~$50m/year

Orbital receivables relate to performance incentives due under certain satellite construction contracts that are


paid over the in-orbit life of the satellite. Leading up to the DigitalGlobe acquisition, MDA’s communications 


(satellite) segment experienced a persistently rising days sales outstanding. The pressure was also evident 


when MDA decided to securitize these receivables in Q3’16. 


1) During the Q3’2016, MDA signed a revolving securitization to sell up to US$400 million of eligible orbital receivables with terms of seven years or less discounted to face value using prevailing market 
rates. Subsequent to signing the agreement, the Company executed two drawdowns and sold orbital receivables with book value of $148.6 million (US$112.1 million) for net proceeds of $163.0 million 
(US$123.1 million)

“Trade accounts receivable, notes receivable and non-securitized orbital receivables include amounts totaling $113,325,000 (December 31, 
2015 - $45,744,000) due from two customers in the Communications segment who are in process of securing external project financing to 
fund their respective satellite construction contracts signed with the Company. Of this amount, $38,193,000 (December 31, 2015 -
$29,732,000) is included in trade accounts receivable that are past due. The Company has concluded that these receivables were not 
impaired at December 31, 2016.”


“As at December 31, 2016, notes receivable include $69,144,000 (December 31, 2015 - $7,717,000) relating to payments due under a
satellite construction contract. In accordance with the terms of the contract, the customer elected to convert certain milestone payment

Material Omission And Embellishment 
On The CEO’s Biography


Maxar’s CEO fails to include in his biography that he was the Chairman of the Board at Change Healthcare Holdings through 2017 
and Harris Stratex (Nasdaq: HSTX, now called Aviat Networks (AVNW)). Both companies informed investors the financial 


statements could not be relied upon under Mr Lance’s tenure. Lance also appears to have embellished his role at NCR, where he
was not the company COO, but rather the COO of two operating units.  


Note: Source: Maxar’s proxy statement filed at Sedar and SEC March 2018
Though his association with Harris Stratex was more than 5 years ago, we believe he should nonetheless distinguish his role from Harris Corp vs. Harris Stratex 
On the announcement of Lance’s appointment, it also states he was President and COO of NCR and fails to mention Harris Stratex or Change Healthcare
On Maxar’s website, he distinguishes his role at NCR and lists Change Healthcare, but omits Harris Stratex


According to NCR, 
Mark Hurd was 


appointed COO on 
Sept 9, 2002. 


Was Lance really the 
COO in 2003? Also, 


NCR’s filings show he 
was COO of the Retail 
and Financial Group, 


not the entire 
company as suggested 


by his biography.

Beneficial ownership by insiders at MDA declined every year to virtually zero ownership. Even post the 


DigitalGlobe acquisition, insiders own a miniscule 0.50% of the stock, and have almost nothing at risk.

Compensation Lies Favoring 
Management


Contrary To Lance’s Statement, Management Is Not Compensated on Cash Flow, Instead EBITDA


Maxar CEO Lance Q4’17 Conference Call (Feb 2018):  “You will also see in our compensation discussion and analysis in our annual circular 
that in 2018 management is now compensated on cash flow in addition to revenue and EBITDA. And that’ll be a friendly reminder to 
everyone on the leadership team to pay attention to that.”

Why The DigitalGlobe/MDA 
Merger Is A Bust
42


Evidence Already Shows Legacy MDA 
Performing Well Below Plan


MDA historically didn’t give guidance, but projections from the proxy statement show just how bad it performed and 


missed internal expectations.


MDA Stand Alone Projections Feb 24, 2017  ($ in mm converted at C$0.766)


Maxar 2017 Annual Report p. 11 and 12:  “Maxar’s 2017 Annual Report: “Consolidated revenues were $1,631.2 million in 2017 compared to $1,557.5 million in 2016. 
Revenues increased due to the inclusion of DigitalGlobe revenues of $221.6 million for the period October 5, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and from higher revenues from 
contracts with the U.S. government and other customers to supply spacecraft and perform design studies for scientific research and development missions.”….“Adjusted 
EBITDA is a measure utilized by management to evaluate the operational performance of the Company’s operating segments. For 2017, adjusted EBITDA was $378.7 
million and adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of consolidated revenues (“adjusted EBITDA margin percentage”) was 23.2%. Excluding the contribution from DigitalGlobe 
for the period October 5, 2017 to December 31, 2017, adjusted EBITDA in 2017 would have been $252.7 million and adjusted EBITDA margin
percentage would have been 17.9%.”

Spruce Point’s Realistic View of MAXR’s 
EBITDA And EPS vs. Fantasy View


US$ in millions 2018E Note


Analyst Consensus EBITDA $718.0 Bloomberg consensus, revised lower recently from $730m


Less: Overcapitalization of Intangible Assets ($50.0)
Our analysis shows that MDA excessively capitalizes technology development costs, which 
enables EPS overstatement. Normalizing results to industry peers suggests $50.0m 


Less: DigitalGlobe Accounting Change 
To Impute Interest


($70.7)
At deal announcement, Management said it didn't find any material accounting changes to 
DigitalGlobe, only to backtrack and inflate EBITDA. Run-rate benefit of $70.7m as of last 
disclosed pro forma analysis in Q3’17


Spruce Point Adjusted EBITDA
Discount vs. Consensus


$597.3
17%


Less: Depreciation and Amortization Expense ($218.0)
Midpoint of original guidance range pre-revisions in Q1 and Q2’18. Our analysis shows that 
management said there would be no revision, yet backtracked and made two depreciation 
changes lower. In our opinion, the change was purely to deflect underlying weakness


Less: Depreciation Expense Disguised As Acquisition 
Intangible Expense


($86.9)
We found management impaired DigitalGlobe PP&E and inflated intangibles. This moved 
$1.1bn of depreciable expenses (wtd. Avg. useful life of 11.5yrs) and classified it as 
acquisition intangibles (which management conveniently wants investors to ignore)


Less: Net Interest Expense ($197.5) Midpoint of management’s guidance, which went down in Q2’18 by $10m 


Less: Stock-based Compensation Expense ($25.0) MAXR provides no guidance, but we estimate $20-$30m and use $25m as our midpoint

$4.65 – $4.85

Isn’t it surprising that analysts’ consensus view falls in the middle of MAXR’s guidance? Also
despite lower interest and depreciation expense by a combined $20m in Q2’18, Maxar did 
not raise its full year Adj EPS guidance range. We believe none of the analysts have 
conducted a forensic review of earnings quality


In our opinion, MAXR’s 2018 Adj. EPS expectation of $4.75/sh is pure fiction. The Company has made 


numerous aggressive accounting choices that inflate its Non-IFRS results. Based on our forensic review, we 


estimate EBITDA and EPS are overstated by 17% and 79%, respectively

Maxar is already backtracking on its statement, and recently restated results in a manner that materially boosts revenues and


EBITDA. Under its application of IFRS, Maxar imputes interest on advance payments received from customers that contain a 


financing element and classifies such amounts as a component of revenue. DigitalGlobe had not historically done so as there is 


no requirement under GAAP. The effect of conforming DigitalGlobe’s accounting policy for payments received from customers 


that contain a financing element is to increase deferred revenue with an offsetting charge to finance expense. When we analyzed 


the effect, we find that revenues and EBITDA are artificially boosted by 4-6% and EBITDA by double digits. There is no change in


cash flow. However, in our opinion, the change allows Maxar to look less levered and receive a higher valuation than it deserves.

Cash Available For Optional Debt Repayment ($93.0 - $43.0) No ability to optionally retire debt


Maxar is claiming it will delever and drive higher cash flow, but the numbers tell a different story. In addition to its 


large interest expense and capex burden, Maxar is committed to a $68m/yr dividend and must pay down $25m/yr 


of its Term Loan B. This means that it has absolutely no excess cash flow to optionally pay down debt. 


Maxar should immediately cut or eliminate the dividend and direct capital towards debt reduction.


CEO Lance Q1’18 Conference Call: “We continue—we continue to drive both of the levers that create de-leveraging. 
One is higher EBITDA, on the denominator, and the other is driving higher free cash flow. We talked at Investor Day 
and reiterated today, activities that are underway, including looking at various assets on our balance sheet that can 
be monetized and turned into cash, whether that’s the securitization of additional orbitals or other opportunities. So 
we’re working all of those. And our goal, as Anil said, is very clear: to achieve 3.8 times leverage by the end of 2018”

And Deleveraging Gets Pushed 
Farther Out To The Future


Maxar is already pushing out its deleveraging process, as illustrated with subtle revisions to a key chart it used to sell 


investors on its ability to rapidly pay down debt. Recall from the previous slide the CEO said leverage would be 3.8x 


by year end, but is now above 4.1x as of Q2 (see slide 12).

Massive Intangible Asset Inflation


Source: Form 51-102F4 Business Acquisition Report, SEDAR filed Nov 14, 2017


Most of DigitalGlobe’s PP&E Was Satellites


Pre-Acquisition


Why Did Maxar Impair C$1.3bn of PP&E And Allocate A Nearly 


Identical Amount To Intangibles?


DigitalGlobe carried just $74m of intangible 
assets, but Maxar believes C$1.3 billion of deal 
value exists here at the expense of its physical 


satellite constellation


We previously illustrated our concern that MDA appears to overcapitalize costs by inflating intangible asset purchases. Thus, it


came as no surprise to us when Maxar used the DigitalGlobe acquisition to inflate intangible assets even further. However, the 


C$1.3 bn (US$1.1 bn) inflation was an order of magnitude that shocked us. MDA made reference to DigitalGlobe’s “world leading 


(satellite) constellation” as a strategic rationale of the acquisition – yet it impaired the assets by a comparable $1.1 billion!


Footnote (a) gives no valid 
explanation other than “To reflect 


the estimated fair value of 
DigitalGlobe’s assets and liabilities”

A Bold Move To Inflate “Adjusted EPS”


Non-IFRS metrics = made up results to sell a lemon. Maxar conveniently inflated acquired intangibles to then 


have them ignored for its adjusted earnings. Had management accurately maintained its PP&E valuation, 


adjusted earnings would be weighed down materially.


“The Company defines adjusted earnings as net earnings excluding the impact of specified items affecting comparability, 
including, where applicable, non-operational income and expenses, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, share-
based compensation, and other gains or losses.”

Depreciation Accounting Changes Reveal 
Underlying Weakness


Initial 2018 Guidance


Q1’18 Investor Presentation and Q2’18 Investor PresentationQ4’17 Investor Presentation


Magic Drop in D&A Expense In Two Quarters


From the Q1’18 Conference Call
Tim James: “Okay. Thank you. And then just my final question, just a bit of a housekeeping question. I’m wondering what caused the increase—excuse 
me, the decrease in expected D&A for 2018?” 
CEO Howard Lance: “It has to do with, I think, what’s fairly typical in a major merger, which is purchase price adjustments and valuations as to fair 
value and life, in our case, of satellites on orbit. So that work continued on into the quarter past the point where we provided our previous guidance. 
And the expected life of assets on orbit was increased modestly, which reduced the annual depreciation associated with those assets.”


After only one quarter, Maxar resorted to accounting changes to artificially boost its EPS guidance. For example, in Q1’18 it


used the oldest trick in the book to increase its estimated useful life of satellites. This lowered depreciation expense by $14-


$22m and increased EPS by $0.15c. In Q2’18, Maxar cut depreciation guidance another $10m ($0.15c) yet didn’t increase 


guidance - signaling underlying weakness. (1) What’s alarming is that at the time of deal announcement, CFO Wirasekara said 


no depreciation changes were to be expected. (2) The reason for the reduction of depreciation hasn’t been disclosed in a 


transparent manner (in the press release or financial reports). Investors only learn by listening to the conference calls.  


1) $18m depreciation reduction at the midpoint and using MAXR’s 14% tax rate and 57m share count equates to a $0.27c benefit vs. the $0.15c EPS boost. On the Q2’18 conference call 
the CEO cited “complicated purchase price adjustment and valuation process that we've gone through since the merger last October” as a reason for the continued reduction

And Various One-Time, Non-Recurring Items 
Used To Inflate EBITDA Create Headwinds


Management has pulled many levers in order to keep its metrics inflated. In certain cases, Maxar has been more 


transparent, and in others less transparent, about these tactics. In both cases, the one-time items will create 


significant headwinds for future results that we don’t believe analysts have correctly modeled – setting Maxar up for 


significant disappointment for year end results.

Maxar’s management is currently guiding for $300-350m of capex in 2018, after which, management suggests 


that capex should fall. (1) We think this is unreasonable and capex will remain elevated. 


Maxar 2018 Investor presentation


We have been able to deduce realistic recurring capex for the Company, and that number is much higher than management’s guidance:


Starting with DigitalGlobe (DGI), our approach to calculating recurring capex is the same one that the satellite investors take when calculating recurring capex for


satellite operators – take the existing fleet needed to provide current revenue levels, calculate the replacement costs for the entire fleet and divide that number by


expected lifetime. Below is a snapshot of DGI’s current fleet, before the introduction of Legion satellites, which will replace it (more on Legion later). We can see that


DGI has 4 satellites as of early 2018 (actually had 5 until 2017, but we will ignore that in our calculations) – thus, we can conclude that DGI needs 4 WorldView


satellites to provide its current service. In the bottom right chart, we also observe that satellite lifetime of each subsequent generation dropped – 14 years for


WorldView-1 and 2, 13 years for WorldView3, and 11 years for WorldView4. We think that the reason for falling lifetimes is the falling price of pixel and DGI’s


constant need to invest a lot of money to stay ahead of curve (see further discussion below). In addition, each new generation WorldView satellite was more


expensive than the previous one – WorldView1 cost $470m, while WorldView4 cost $840m – we think this is another manifestation of industry pressures forcing DGI


to invest a large amount of money to maintain its revenues. Using the above discussed satellite industry heuristic for recurring capex for a given fleet, we take the


average WorldView cost (maybe it would have been more realistic to take the cost of WorldView4, but let’s be conservative), multiply by 4 (because we need 4 of


them) and divide by 11 (average useful life – which may also prove to be kind) and we get $225m in average annual recurring capex.


1) 2018 investor presentation shows $1,235 of total capex forecasted over 5yrs from 2018-2022, 
implying $247m on average per year



http://s22.q4cdn.com/683266634/files/doc_presentations/2018/05/RBC-Industrials-Conf-0518-4-3-version.pdf
53


High Maintenance Capex Needs (Cont’d)


We expect capital expenditures to continue in the $315m per year range. 


A potentially fair criticism of this approach is that Maxar is replacing WorldView satellites with new Legions. While the Company has kept information regarding Legion at


a minimum (management has not disclosed the total number of satellites, or how much the satellites cost, etc), we were still able to deduce a similar recurring capex


calculation with the help of satellite imaging industry experts. We believe to replace all 4 WorldViews, and deliver the functionality that Maxar is looking for, it will need


to launch at least 25 satellites (Legion satellites are much smaller), which would cost $80-$100m per satellite. Using the above estimate, the total needed capex exceeds


$2bn, and assuming a similar expected useful life (no reason not to), the implied recurring capex is approximately $200-225m, a range similar to our previous estimate.


Another piece of evidence that we think illustrates DGI’s large and continuous capex needs is the statement from interim Maxar CFO (former MDA CFO)


Anil Wirasekara during the 2018 Maxar investor day, when he said:


“But essentially from 2014, 2015 and 2016 there was very little CapEx that was spent at DigitalGlobe to build satellites. And they took advantage of that and all the cash


flow that was generated during this period and bought back about$300 million of stock.”


If DGI wasn’t spending the capex on satellites, then it must have been maintenance capex. As we can see in the table below, during that period, DGI had ~$200m per


annum in capex. If that number is “low” then our recurring capex number looks very reasonable, if not perhaps even conservative. For what is now the Space Systems


division, we can take the old MDA as a proxy, and it spent on average ~$90m of capex per annum over the past 4 years. Given that most of the growth in Space Systems is


coming from new projects, such as small satellites, new defense programs, etc – for which Maxar will have to invest in new resources, we think it prudent to assume that


Space Systems recurring capex remains similar to current levels. Thus, we believe a reasonable estimate of Maxar’s recurring capex is $225m + $90m = $315m.

Significant Downside To DigitalGlobe


DigitalGIobe (DGI) operates a fleet of 4 in orbit imaging satellites that provide high resolution images of Earth’s surface. The


Company generates two thirds of its revenues through contracts with the U.S. government, the majority of which is contracted 


with the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (or “NGA”). NGA serves as the primary U.S. Government procurement 


agency for geospatial information and purchases imagery products and services on behalf of various agencies within the U.S. 


Government, including defense, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The contract with NGA expires in 2019/2020 and 


NGA can cancel the contract at any point in time. (1) DGI generates the rest of its revenue from contracts with non U.S. 


governments and the private sector.

Maxar’s bull case for DigitalGlobe is predicated on two pillars:


1. DGI’s contract with NGA is priced too cheaply and is due for a price increase


2. There’s a huge opportunity for DGI outside of the U.S. government


Our research suggests both pillars seem unrealistic: it appears that DigitalGlobe is more likely to see prices decreases on the NGA contract and


opportunities outside of U.S. government appear limited


DGI’s contract with NGA


DGI is understandably secretive when it comes to terms of its contract with NGA. However, we know that NGA under its “EnhancedView Service


Level Agreement” contract (“EnhancedView SLA”) pays DGI $337m per annum for an estimated 50% of capacity on WorldViews 1-3. This equates


to about 622m km2 of annual collection capacity at an implied price of about $0.54 per km2 :

Satellite imaging prices: resolution vs pricing per km2


Significant Downside To DigitalGlobe 
(Cont’d)


WorldViews 1-3 offer resolutions of about 30-50 cm in black and white and about 124-164 cm in color. Many bulls believe that 


this price is “low” without offering much comparable data to justify their view. So we investigated through our research network


to source current market pricing for satellite imaging at different resolutions. Below is the summary and suggests that at 


resolutions of around 50 cm, the price should be about $25/km2: 


Source: Industry research


However, this is a price for a “useful image” – say a military base in Syria is useful to the U.S. government, while a picture of farmland in North Dakota is


not useful. But most of the data that DGI captures in a given year is not useful. Working further within our network, we were told that on average only


3-4% of images that observation satellites collect are “useful”. Furthermore, as we can see in the below chart from NSR, there is a close to 9x


difference between priority images (as in “we need to know that is happening at a given Syrian military base right now”) and archive (“we want to know


what happened in the Syrian base last month). While we don’t have split for NGA’s EnhancedView SLA between priority and archive, we believe a


50/50 split is a good rule of thumb. Adjusting for these factors, we see that DGI is charging $337 million / (622 mn km2 * 3% * 50%) = $36 per useful


image, close to 50% premium to market rates. In addition, our industry research suggests that for deals such as DGI’s with NGA, bulk discounts of


around 75% are the norm, which makes DGI look even more expensive. Thus, we think that with the next round of negotiations, the NGA seems more


likely to want a price discount rather than accept a price increase. Furthermore, we can also see in the NSR chart that the prices per pixels have been


going down and the industry expects them to continue going down – not up. As the U.S. government represents 66% of DGI’s revenue, any price


reductions would obviously have a material impact on DGI’s earnings.

Expect DigitalGlobe’s Commercial 
Opportunities To Disappoint


DigitalGlobe has been talking up the revenue opportunity away from the U.S. government for a very long time. As an example, 


when Morgan Stanley wrote its research initiation in 2014, it had expected non-U.S. government (commercial) revenue to reach 


$400m. As of its last reporting on June 30, 2017 LTM diversified commercial revenue was just $282m (~30% below plan). 


Source: Morgan Stanley Equity Research


Based on our research, we expect the non U.S. government opportunities for DGI to remain limited:


• First, we expect foreign government adoption to continue being very low. We believe the reason is because the U.S. is highly likely to 
have a right of first refusal on images that DGI produces. When the government exercises this right, DigitalGlobe still gets paid, but it 
does suggest that all governments tend to want to see the same images, and thus prefer to build their own remote imaging capacity 


• For example, we were very surprised to see Turkey, a NATO member, and thus a U.S. ally, and a country not normally known for its
advanced technologies, launch its own satellite imaging satellite called Göktürk. (1) Not only Turkey, but also Thailand and the UAE, 
have also announced plans to purchase their own observation satellites from Airbus. (2) Based on industry research, it seems that 
many other countries – for example most of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries – are looking to build their own imaging satellites 
– primarily because they do not want their intelligence capabilities to be at the mercy of a U.S. veto, and because they do notwant the 
U.S. government to know what images they are looking at

Expect Disappointment To DigitalGlobe’s 
Commercial Opportunities (Cont’d)


Based on our research, we expect the non U.S. government opportunities for DigitalGlobe to remain limited:


• We struggle to see what value proposition DigitalGlobe offers to the private sector. DigitalGlobe’s bull case is based on offering 
corporate customers different types of analytics, whether for agriculture, economics, or some other usage


• However, based on industry feedback, most analytics work requires 1m resolution – well within capabilities of DigitalGlobe’s 
(cheaper) competitors Airbus (50 cm resolution) and Planet Labs (70 cm resolution) – thus making DigitalGlobe’s market 
leading 30 cm resolution irrelevant 


• Moreover, for applications like agriculture, resolutions of 50-100m are sufficient – and potential customers can get such 
resolutions for free from NASA’s Landsat and European Space Agency’s Sentinel programs – so why pay DigitalGlobe? 


• To be clear, we do not dispute that DigitalGlobe can continue to make one-off archive deals, but we think some sort of major 
industry adoption is unlikely. In our modelling of Maxar, we primarily rely on market consensus and Maxar’s guidance, but we 
think that the above suggests that there are significant downside risks to its plans

Commentary and Q&A From The Q2’2018 Conference Call:


CEO Howard L. Lance: “We made some modest adjustments to our EBITDA margin outlook at the midyear point raising Imagery a bit higher 
and putting Space Systems segment a bit lower due to continue Geo concept market weakness and program performance.”


Question Steven Li: “Thank you. Hey, Howard, the EBITDA guidance being a little lower, it looks like half of that decline is coming from space. 
And if so, is Radiant having some negative surprises as well? Where is the other delta coming from? Thanks.”


Answer Howard Lance: “We took down I think by 50 basis points, the margin expectations at Radiant. So that's a relatively small number. The 
decline is around Space Systems, which I think we took down a full 100 basis points for the year and that's driven again by the volumes that 
we're not seeing any improvement as well as a little bit of mix every day at across that cost plus programs. But that's the minor point. It's 
really around Space Systems.”

False Hope In LEO Deal With Telesat


Maxar and its investors have been hoping it can transition away from GEO satellites to the LEO market. 


Before Q2 earnings, Maxar announced it joined a consortium with Thales Alenia Space, a JV between Thales (67%) and 


Leonardo (33%) to design and develop Telesat’s LEO constellation. While no financial details were announced, CEO Lance 


used the earnings call to talk up that he “expects it to be a 50-50” partnership (either it is or it is not!), despite it appearing 


Maxar has a junior role in the consortium. Unfortunately, two days later, Telesat announced a second consortium, further 


reducing Maxar’s chances of realizing any material financial upside. According to industry sources, Maxar is likely to have to 


put up capital to participate in the project – stretching its liquidity even further.

Commentary and Q&A From The Q2’2018 Conference Call:


“This consortium is so named because we are equal partners with Thales on this project. We'll focus on our strengths which certainly will 
include the bus and all the propulsion, infrastructure as well as very advanced antenna technology and other satellite electronics at MDA. 
Thales has experienced, more experienced frankly with systems engineering of large constellations. They just completed the Iridium NEXT 
program as well as further along in development and application digital payloads. So we felt that the two companies coming together would 
increase our win on the project, give us the best chance of having the most robust constellation and the lowest overall cost for Telesat. So we 
expect it to be very much a 50-50 partnership. It will obviously have lower revenue that if we're doing it totally ourselves, but this is going to 
be a large fixed price pursuit for the production phase and we're also sharing the risks now”


Thales Dashes Maxar’s Hopes By Announcing Airbus As A Competitor 


“Telesat now has two separate teams, comprised of industry leading satellite manufacturing companies, who will work in close cooperation 
with Telesat over the coming months in a series of engineering activities and technical reviews. These efforts will culminate in each team 
submitting a firm proposal for final design and manufacture of Telesat’s LEO satellites and ground system infrastructure. Telesat anticipates 
deciding by mid-2019 on a prime contractor for Telesat’s LEO program – space segment, ground segment and system integration.”


While Partners Such As Maxar, Are Likely To Be Asked To Commit Capital And Fund The Project (Money Maxar Doesn’t Have)


According to Space Intel, “Industry officials familiar with Telesat’s LEO bidding process have said the company is all but certain to request an 
equity investment on the part of its major suppliers”

66


Weak “Hopeful” Bullish Arguments


RBC is the biggest bull on the stock with a $73 price target.


Its bullish arguments are easily refuted and reflect optimism over financial reality in our opinion.


Growing global need for satellite imagery and data analytics. 
DigitalGlobe is a key supplier to the US and other governments of 
critical surveillance solutions


A steady global market for commercial communications satellites. We 
expect ~10–15 satellite orders per year on average from commercial 
satellite operators, with a growing number of these expected to be 
high-value Ultra HTS. Of this, we expect SSL to maintain its share of 
roughly 30% of the market


US government opportunities appear to be accelerating. MDA/SSL 
has now received security clearances to pursue US government 
business and seems to be gaining momentum on deals with NASA and 
DARPA. We understand that the pipeline of activity is robust, and it 
should be accelerated with the contacts, scale, and infrastructure of 
the DigitalGlobe business


Revenue and cost synergies. We expect to see solid opportunities to 
sell Radarsat imagery through current DigitalGlobe channels, and cost 
synergies should be evident as duplication is removed


Attractive valuation relative to market position, growth outlook, and 
A&D peers. We see the current share price as very compelling. On our 
forecasts, Maxar shares currently trade at 9.8x 2019E P/E, or 7.7x 
EV/EBITDA, well below A&D peers at 17.6x and 11.7x, respectively.


RBC Bull Case


Alternative and cheaper solutions exist that will limit the broadening 
of commercial opportunities for DigitalGlobe, which has failed to ever 
meet its commercial targets


Evidence that the cycle has not found a bottom and Maxar’s business 
remains under pressure with further layoffs. Even assuming it 
maintains its 30% share, 3-4 satellites per year doesn’t represent a 
compelling investment case


“Appear to be accelerating” is not convincing without actual hard 
evidence. Our evidence illustrates that legacy MDA/SSL is experiencing 
an acceleration of declining organic revenue of -12.7% YTD


While Maxar has disclosed modest cost synergies of $15m YTD, it has 
not provided any clear financial metrics about revenue synergies


The valuation is only attractive in our opinion, because the Adjusted 
EBITDA and EPS are vastly inflated with aggressive accounting 
assumptions about intangible assets. The true valuation multiples are 
much higher, and not cheap enough for a highly levered company, 
declining organically, with almost no free cash flow
