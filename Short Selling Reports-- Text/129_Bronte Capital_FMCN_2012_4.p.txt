The mysterious case of the disappearing competitor: Focus
Media edition
 
JCDecaux - the French multinational giant - is the largest display advertising company in the world.
They also claim in their latest annual report to be the largest display advertising business in China. 
 
Every year they publish in their annual report a list of the largest display advertising businesses in the
world - their competitors. 
 
Here is that list from the 2007 annual report : 
 


 
 
 
On this list, Focus Media is the 8th largest company in the world in this space. 
 
And here is the list from the 2008 annual report:

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: The mysterious case of the disappearing competitor: Focus Media edition

Peculiarly Focus Media is nowhere to be seen on this list (by the end of 2009 it should have risen to
fifth place). 
 
Focus Media is no longer mentioned in JCDecaux's 2010 and 2011 accounts. 
 
Why? 
 
Well I can think of two hypotheses: 
 
The first is that JCDecaux want to sustain their claim of being the biggest display advertising business
in China - a claim that is simply not tenable if they include Focus Media in the comparison. Moreover
they don't want to increase the credibility with advertisers of Focus Media and its products. After all
Focus Media has substantially outperformed JCDecaux in China - growing much faster and at much
fatter margins. 
 
An alternative hypothesis is that they don't believe Focus Media's numbers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
John 
 
PS. I first found these lists when researching China Media Express. CCME supposedly competed with
JCDecaux in placing adverts on public transport (in CCME's case mostly buses including airport
buses). CCME however was a complete fraud and the stock now trades at 2c. Focus Media is
obviously real - their displays are widespread.

Have you tried asking their IR debt? Maybe they have some sort of explanation for the
disappearance, which would be interesting and possibly shed light one way or the other.

CCME was actually revoked so it now does not trade at all.

You are correct- last trade was 2c. 
 
If you are a long investor who purchased at $20 the difference between 2c and zero is not
very much really. 
 
100 thousand dollars worth would be 500 thousand shares. That is on last trade worth
$100. Barely worth trading if you could have sold anyway without sending the price to
0.002 cents!

I don't see exactly where JCDecaux claims to still be the largest display advertiser
overall. In their 2011 report, they seem to add conditionals which limit it to transportation: 
 
"With a massive presence, JCDecaux is the leading outdoor transport communication
company in China." 
 
"In China, where it is the leader in transport advertising, JCDecaux conducted the first
audience measurement study..." 
 
Then there is this: 
"In 2005, we became the leader in outdoor advertising in China, by making three
acquisitions, thanks to which we rapidly gained a significant presence in the metros
and on the buses of major Chinese cities." There is no mention that they remain number
one. Even in the 2008 report, they are making EUR 322m (say USD 483m) for the entire
Asia-Pacific region, while they have Focus at USD 524m. 2005 was when Focus's major
acquisition and consolidation effort was just getting started. 
 
 
It seems their claims are limited to the transport advertising, in which Focus Media is not
involved. Clear Media's "street furniture" is limited to bus stops. Vision China and
AirMedia are both focused on transport areas.

I remembered asking this question to one OOH executive in China ( not related to FMCN)
last year.  
 
He said the reason that FMCN is excluded from JCD's list is because FMCN is more in
the indoor advertising ,ie. in-elevator platform . Which is not a direct competitor to OOH
section of FMCN

One way to test the thesis... In the 20-f they say no single customer accounts for more
than 3% of revenue and list the top customers as Mengniu Dairy, L’Oreal China, Yili Dairy,
P&G China, Beingmate, Dongfeng Yueda Kia, Volkswagen Shanghai, Dongfeng
Automobile, FAW Volkswagen and Yum! China. That implies one of these companies is
likely representing over 2% of revenue or USD$16mm. Perhaps you can crowd source
this info via your blog from anyone who may have contacts within the marketing
department of these companies. Also, those are 10 quick phone calls for the due
diligence team...

Are any of the current directors linked to previous fraud and general scumbaggery

My only reservation with this trade is that, what if the company is overstating margins &
profits, doing dodgy things like calling posters LCD screens etc. but there is a profitable,
albeit smaller scale, business underneath that. 
 
That may not pass the test for Carlyle, who may end up walking away from the deal, but
what about all the other parties involved? I don't see how guys like Citic Capital or China
Everbright would mind still doing the deal. After all, everyone said Harbin Electric was a
fraud, and Abax Capital (an MS seeded fund with decently high profile finance
professionals) + company's CEO ended up taking the company private. Even if Carlyle
backs out, the other guys probably have the ability to invest more and close the deal.

Does anyone know if China Media Express ever actually operated as a real company. It
had a major investment and board member from Starr Investments (AIG Greenberg's
investment vehicle)and it had a big 4 auditor. It's website still functions. How did it fool so
many people for so long? I have never read a post mortem on this company. If it was real,
does it still operate?
