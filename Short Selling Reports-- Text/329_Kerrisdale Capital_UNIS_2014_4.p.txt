Unilife: CFO Resignation And Usurious Financing Imply Substantial
Downside
Mar. 21, 2014 9:00 AM ET49 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


CFO resigned last week likely because he wants to sever ties with company and
monetize shares while they still have value.


Recent debt financing was priced at a usurious interest rate, implying that company
couldn't get financing from traditional bank lenders due to dismal product prospects.


Debt on balance sheet will likely accelerate the company's path to insolvency, given
that OrbiMed is likely eyeing the company's real estate in potential bankruptcy
proceedings.


As we have written in prior articles, we believe that Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS) does not have
a viable business model, will never generate meaningful revenue, and is highly overvalued
at what is now a $580m market capitalization.


Over the past week, two new developments reinforced our thesis. First, its Chief Financial
Officer resigned, most likely because he wants to monetize his shares while they still have
value and to sever ties with Unilife before its product claims are shown to be overhyped.
Second, the company entered into a debt financing agreement last week that not only
provides additional support for the company's bleak business prospects, but also saddles
the company with onerous debt that will accelerate the Unilife's demise.


Sudden CFO Resignation Raises Red Flags


Former Chief Financial Officer Richard Wieland resigned on March 12th, entering into a
separation agreement with the company that was announced on March 18th. CFO
resignations are always concerning, and the case with Unilife is no different. Wieland
resigned without announcing another opportunity that he is taking, indicating that he's not
leaving Unilife for a better alternative but because he no longer wants to be employed by
the company. Unilife's appointment of the Comptroller as Interim CFO, and its need to
advertise for a new CFO within the actual press release, reveals that the resignation was
unexpected.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2101693-unilife-cfo-resignation-and-usurious-financing-imply-substantial-downside 2/15


Based on what we've seen of UNIS, we assume that Mr. Wieland no longer wants to be
associated with a company that is built around stock promotion, misleading product claims
and a horrendous financial profile. Rather than stay with the company for its ultimate
descent into the pink sheets, Wieland likely wanted to exit while his stock options are in
the money and shares have some value.


Having departed, Wieland can now monetize his 240,000 shares, as disclosed in the most
recent proxy, without filing the relevant Form 4s. Alan Shortall and other senior
management may be pressuring executives to avoid sales of their shares, due to the
negative message share sales send to the market, and the most expedient way for
Wieland to cash in his holdings is by resigning from the company.


Additionally, Wieland received severance of $245,000 and the vesting of 115,000 shares
of stock. Given that Wieland could earn this additional income, monetize his current
holdings and sever ties with a questionable company, the resignation was probably too
attractive to forego.


Onerous OrbiMed Financing Expedites Financial Demise


Unilife entered into a debt financing agreement last week that not only provides additional
evidence of the company's grim product potential, but also burdens them with high-cost
debt that will probably ultimately render the company insolvent. On March 12th, Unilife
announced that it entered into a $60 million loan agreement with OrbiMed Advisors. The
loan carries a usurious interest rate of L+925bps, and is backed by a pledge and security
agreement, general security deed and commercial mortgage and security agreement. The
company will not disclose the debt agreements until it files its next 10-Q, but we wouldn't
be surprised if the loan is collateralized by Unilife's owned property.


The high interest rate incurred in the financing is a sign that Unilife could not find other
lenders willing to provide debt financing to the company. Whereas other businesses would
be able to arrange loan facilities with banks such as Wells Fargo or Bank of America,
Unilife had to seek out a hedge fund for its high cost capital.


OrbiMed likely believes that Unilife will continue to be able to tap the equity markets
through both secondary offerings and At-The-Money equity offerings to raise equity capital
that can be used to pay its high interest rates.


However, as we have seen with other biotech companies with gloomy revenue prospects,
debt financings can ultimately come back to haunt these businesses when the equity
markets finally tire of stock promotion and become unwilling to provide additional equity

financing. When this happens, cash flow problems can compound quickly, driving the
company into bankruptcy.


In the case of Unilife, we believe that OrbiMed has positioned itself favorably in the event
of a default, by including an L+14.25% default rate and likely incorporating the company's
real estate into its collateral package. In fact, OrbiMed may be better off in the event of a
Unilife bankruptcy, a situation which would leave UNIS shareholders penniless.


Retractable Technologies, a Close Comparable, Trades at a Fraction of Unilife's
Valuation


Unilife has repeatedly told investors that its retractable needle designs are a "game-
changing" technology with no viable peers. But another microcap company, Retractable
Technologies (NYSEMKT:RVP), has long battled the industry leaders to market a
retractable needle design. Unlike Unilife, RVP consistently generates genuine product
sales of $30 - $40m with its VanishPoint line of retractable needle designs. But RVP's
management isn't vocal, shunning quarterly conference calls and lavish investor
presentations. Since it is largely self-funding, RVP has no need to drum up enthusiasm for
secondary sales every few months. This lack of promotional activity has resulted in RVP's
shares trading at less than one-fifth the market capitalization of Unilife even though RVP
generates four times the revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2101693-unilife-cfo-resignation-and-usurious-financing-imply-substantial-downside 4/15


Source: Retractable Technologies


Over the past decade, Retractable Technologies has only managed to marginally increase
its revenue, growing from $19m in 2003 to $31m over the last twelve months. This meager
5% growth CAGR proves just how difficult it is for niche players to compete in the syringe
market.


Conclusion


Based upon the disclosures given thus far, Unilife's fundamentals cannot come close to
justifying the current $580m market capitalization. The net present value of the disclosed
milestones is just $53m versus an expected cash burn rate near $100m over the same
two year period. Management's guidance for year-over-year growth in 2014 sets an
extraordinarily low-bar given that UNIS has earned just $8m of revenue over the past
twelve months. If Unilife did expect positive cash flows in 2014, proper guidance would
have been given. Instead, we'd expect another year of value destruction, dilutive
financings, and extended timelines as Unilife struggles to compete with multi-billion dollar
industry incumbents.


We further think the two major developments for Unilife this month provide additional
support that UNIS is a highly overvalued stock with dismal business prospects. The
company's stock rise has been driven by stock promotion and vague customer
announcements rather than tangible evidence that its product will be successful in the
marketplace.

>>. The loan carries a usurious interest rate of L+925bps...<<


The interest rate is actually even higher than that, as there's also a 6% "repayment charge" when the loan comes
due. And why would the CFO get a full severance package after leaving under these circumstances? If he were
"terminated for cause" there would be no severance and, on the other hand, if he were retiring on good terms he
would have established a transition period whereby the company would have time to obtain a permanent successor.
But by simultaneously leaving suddenly and collecting a fat severance package, one might surmise that the company
was buying his silence.

Wow Shorty, this is your (4th) article since 12/4/2013 when the stock of UNIS was $3.91. Boy your "teeming" with
these short articles. I believe one of your articles title was "Will Unilife price it's potential secondary above $3.50?"
How did that scare tactic work out for you? Maybe you should double down here on your short trade and see if the
company has any more deals to be announced.

I hold no position in UNIS, but I loathe the use of this venue by the shorts to spread FUD on companies in which they
hold short positions.


This article crosses the line, with the author exposing himself to libel for unsubstantiated and unsupported
accusations:


"... we assume that Mr. Wieland no longer wants to be associated with a company that is built around stock

The author has no knowledge of the circumstances behind the resignation. Hopefully Unilife will pursue legal action
against this individual and put a dampener on the blatant use of this venue for personal gain.

“CFO resigned last week likely because he wants to sever ties with company and monetize shares while they still
have value.” You have no idea what his motives were. Shear speculation.


“severance of $245,000 and the vesting of 115,000 shares of stock… too attractive to forego.” So I guess we should
expect to see all of management bolt for the doors based on similar rationale.


“loan is collateralized by Unilife's owned property.” So what is unique about this arrangement? Provide an example of
a small biotech firm yet to achieve profitability that does not provide collateral.


“Wells Fargo or Bank of America…” Provide an example in this end of the market where a firm obtained a loan from a
major bank.


I agree the terms are not great compared to a home mortgage or even a used car loan, but you need to give us some
reference points in this loan market. “Usurious” compared to what?

Value Investments.
Exactly ddbuyerhere, I also hope that defamation and slander actions come against this concerted effort to discredit
the staff and company, in the meantime the company has answered these made up points with contracts and the
ability to get finance when we have been told by the authors that it wont/can't be done and that a secondary offering
will have to take place.


I propose that this author and the most recent author on this company are working hand in hand and trying to use
social media to influence the markets, I believe that such actions should be investigated and if proven true should
lead to instant jail time for the perpetrators.


Assuming why an employee has left yet making it sound like fact and as a basis for "the" argument put forth by this
author is also a tactic that should be investigated and if wrongfully proposed investigated by legal counsel.


The authors of this article should be investigated to see if they have short sold this stock immediately after such
articles are released and also in conjunction with other authors whom they seem to be working with.

Maybe the author should attempt to learn and understand the extent to which INIS intends to use the proceeds of the
financing to increase their capacity to launch more than just one syringe this year and additional different syringes
during these next 12 to 24 months which will potentially, at least, provide some future valuation and in the meantime a
reason to own the shares now in anticipation of the efficient use of the proceeds of the financing. I am long UNIS.

Best way to punish the shorts is to keep buying, and don't lend your shares. Latest deal was non diluting and should
give all they need to bring the handful of deals in the pipeline. Did you notice the the statement in the filings of the
resigning CFO? "over forty years in the industry"? How long is the guy supposed to stick around? He's gotta be, what,
60yrs plus?


21 Mar 2014, 01:18 PM


silence_twain
Davey: Even a novice investor who has only watched a few episodes of Shark Tank knows that when one
gives away a royalty like UNIS did, they gave away part of the business. You may not view that as dilution,
but the royalty means less for shareholders.


I think longs continue to look at the stock as cheap because they view it as only $5. Instead, they should be
looking at what the market cap or EV implies. I think many fewer retail investors would be as excited about
the name if the stock was at $22, but only had 25 million shares outstanding.


Also sticking around a few more years, if you think the company is on the verge of a major earnings explosion
would make a lot of sense. I have a hard time thinking he would walk away from meaningful wealth for him
and his family if he thought it meant working only a few more years.

Author’s reasons for CFO resignation are a beautiful example of yellow journalism. I am long UNIS, but was
significantly concerned that the CFO could not answer what I considered basic financial questioning during the most
recent corporate earnings call. If I were the CFO, I would have been professionally embarrassed by the call. If I were
the CEO, I would have immediately reevaluated whether this CFO was the right choice going forward. Author states
CFO received $245,000 severance ... if it is true, makes me wonder if this was an incentive provided by CEO to leave
peacefully, or was it specified in the original hiring agreement Whatever the circumstances, I believe the CFO
departure is good news for those long UNIS; I hope the CEO uses this as an opportunity to upgrade the position.


Full disclosure: I recently sold 20% of UNIS holdings (100% long term capital gain) ... I will consider replenishing if it
goes below $4.75.

INTERESTING TO VIEW THE SHORT INTEREST STATISTICS 
For example.it is interesting to note that that the number of shares sold short remain pretty much the same over the
past 5 months - since Thanksgiving. This despite the fact the stock price has doubled from 2.5/share to as high as
5.8. 
Specifically,it had only a minimal increase between the two month double to the mid january high of 5.3.

Presumably,for those shorting shares believing in fundamental problems - one would expect that if it was a short in
November at 2.55 it should be an even more attractive short at twice the price. But it appears that they might be
getting tired of being squeezed. Thus, while "average daily volume" has decreased since the usual end of year tax
selling, the extent to which the "the days to cover" has expanded and would appear to bring out the short sellers with
interpretations of the pending end of the world. 
Eventually this site might reading the views of those who just might have asked the company: For what purpose did
the company decide to do the recent financing (?) and to what extent does the company expect a need to ramp up
their ability to meet the potentially growing demand by producing additional products from both current and any
additional product line revenue to meet what the company expects will be demand for their current and new products.

@WhitneyTilson - I respect your opinion but it does seem that the storyline has been developing in favor of
Unilife. Kerrisdale once said the patents were useless but now those patents at least have value to Orbimed.
Kerridale also stated that the Hikma and Sanofi deals would not materialize into actual production. While full
confirmation has not yet arrived, it does seem more probable than not.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2101693-unilife-cfo-resignation-and-usurious-financing-imply-substantial-downside 9/15


Regardless, I am curious what your take would be if Unilife were to land two additional deals similar to Hikma
and Sanofi (assuming those deals live up to the minimal levels announced)?


23 Mar 2014, 08:04 AM


Logical Thought, Contributor
We don't know that Orbimed cares about the patents at all. UNIS has a building on the books at $32 million
and today it's probably worth more. The mortgage on the building was $16 million, leaving at least $16 million
of equity. There's also $18 million of machinery that could be worth $5 million in liquidation. So if UNIS just
makes its interest payments between now and 2020, Orbimed will get back at least (and more if LIBOR
increases) $4.1 million + $5.13 million + $6.15 million + $6.15 million + $6.15 million + $6.15 million + $6.15
million + (even if sales never improve) at least $2 million in royalties = $42 million, and the remaining $18
million of principal exposure is roughly covered by the equity in the company's real estate and the liquidating
value of the machinery.


In other words, those patents could be worth squat and Orbi will still come out whole as long as UNIS can
dump enough stock into the market to cover its interest payments. Anything above that is gravy.


Also, the company hasn't revealed what metrics it needs to hit in order to receive the next two $10 million
installments. It's conceivable that UNIS never hits them, in which case a year from now it owes back the full
$40 million plus 16.25% in interest (including the 6% "repayment charge") and thus has to dump a boatload of
stock into the market to make the payment. But hey, think of the bright side: with the current $500+ million
market cap, at $1/share or so they should be able to get something done.


23 Mar 2014, 09:17 AM


Uniwatcher
Somehow there are 7 years of interest payments there, may need to do your calculations again. It is a 6 year
term. Sure there is 6% to be paid at the end so that would be max $3.6M for that. I would have thought
Orbimed would like to receive all those interest payments Plus their capital loaned out at the end of the term. I
would suspect that is the intention of most who lend money. You mention it is conceivable that the company
will owe the full $40M some point in the next 12 months if they fail to hit the 'metrics' required to get the extra
payments. I don't remember seeing anything like that in the 8-K?


24 Mar 2014, 03:40 AM


Logical Thought, Contributor
1) Yes, you are correct that there was an extra interest payment in my calculation. I was assuming that the
principal is due at the end of 2020 when it fact it's due in March of 2020. I apologize for that.


2) You are correct that I am merely speculating that if UNIS doesn't qualify for the next two $10 million
tranches it will mean that it needs to quickly repay the initial $40 million. That could be wrong and we'll see
the details of this when the company files the full agreement with its 10Q, which will supposedly be by March
31st. However, if UNIS doesn't qualify for the additional $20 million it will hugely reduce Orbimed's exposure
(laying out $40 million and receiving back $24.6 million in interest plus at least $2 million in royalties while

You're right, Kerrisdale, a successful multi-hundred million dollar hedge fund that has consistently beaten the market
and made gobs of money for its investors has no idea what it's talking about. You, on the other hand, clearly have

that has consistently eluded the company over it's entire lifetime.

Does Retractable Technologies have Big Pharma clients locked into for 15 or 20 year supply agreements? And
agreements that pay upfront/milestone payments?


Looking at RVP's products, what would compel me to pay them upfront/milestone payments? Turn that around, why
does Big Pharma need to pay Unilife upfront/milestone payments at all?


Why pay Unilife upfronts and milestones? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

The milestones will afford shareholders with no value: the potential payments of $20m in 2014 and another $30m in
2015 should be quickly consumed by Unilife's $45m annual cash-burn rate.


Investors are speculating that Unilife will go from producing no product revenue for the past 12 years, even after
announcing supply agreements on many occasions going back to the early 2000s (http://bit.ly/1g7N0Ce), to
generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue at double-digit margins, thereby justifying the current $550m
market capitalization.


Based on Unilife's promotional history, the ambiguous phrasing of the supply agreement press releases, and the
actions discussed in our writeups, we don't think this ever happens.


24 Mar 2014, 02:37 PM


sooker
My question is not about whether upfronts and milestones will afford any value to shareholders. My question
is about the psychology behind Big Pharma feeling compelled to pay upfronts and milestones at all.


Your analysis has never adequately explained why Big Pharma need to pay upfronts to Unilife when in your
view Unilife offers nothing that can't be sourced elsewhere.


24 Mar 2014, 04:45 PM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We could guess a range of possibilities: perhaps Unilife is promising to create bespoke
needles that sound attractive in theory but will be hard to manufacture at scale, or maybe potential customers
want a backup supplier to their existing relationships. Or equally likely, hypothetical customers might be using
Unilife as leverage to get Becton Dickinson to negotiate down its price or refine its offerings.


These are all more sensible answers than assuming that Unilife miraculously invented a range of syringes
that were never previously conceived by the $40bn Baxter, the $30bn Covidien, the $20bn Becton Dickinson,
$10bn Terumo, and half a dozen other syringe manufacturers.

With respect to the leverage argument, UNIS is either a real threat to BAX, BDX, etc., and therefore provides
some measure of leverage, or they are no real threat and would offer no leverage. You can't have it both
ways.


As to "no product revenue for the past 12 years" coincidentally "it takes an average of 12 years for an
experimental drug to travel from the laboratory to your medicine cabinet. That is, if it makes it." per
http://bit.ly/1iwYEFW


This is a high risk high reward (or not) sector. I would not expect fantastic loan terms in this sector.


I am confident you'll offer a rebuttal, but hey, "iron sharpens iron" and perhaps we'll both be wiser for the
exchange.

You're obviously not a believer of Occam's razor then. You provide some very convoluted reasons why Big
Pharma feel compelled to pay upfronts and milestones.

As the CFO of Unilife for four years and with 40 years financial experience in the life science industry, I feel it is
important to respond directly to this article which seeks to cast false and misleading statements about Unilife and me.
I would encourage Seeking Alpha to ensure authors of such articles are held fully accountable for the accuracy of
every statement or claim they seek to make.


I'm writing to rebut this unfounded article. My departure was entirely amicable as was adequately described in the
press release, and I have no interest in selling stock at the current time. I strongly believe that the Company has a
very bright future with the amazing, highly unique product line it has, the attractive contracts it already has in hand as
well as those currently being negotiated and the strong management team in place to deliver the operating results
that all investors are looking for from the Company. I know Unilife will hire a dynamic CFO that will help take them to
the next level, and until then, there is no question that Dennis Pyers is very capable of doing the job in the interim.


The recent debt deal that was announced with OrbiMed was terrific in my view. OrbiMed is an experienced, large, and
highly credible Life Science investor who studied the Company very carefully before consummating an excellent deal
with Unilife. This will provide the financial runway it needs to execute against the contracts already in hand.


In conclusion, I am a long-term investor who wishes the Company nothing but success in the future and one who will
continue to assist the Company in achieving its objectives, however I can.

The chance that this is real is approximately 0.001%

Even if its real, I would guess he only did this at Alan's behest. I have heard before that UNIS is adamant
about monitoring message boards etc. He gave no reason for why he would retire so suddnly. We know its
sudden because the company had no replacement in place. Once again, I throw this question out there:
When have you seen a high level executive leave voluntarily right before the company achieved greatness
and possibly pass up on once in a lifetime wealth that could help both him and future generations?

ST: "I would guess"


Several plausible scenarios as to why he retired suddenly have been offered. The CFO is not obliged to
provide the private details of his decisions to you. Would you believe this was an authentic e-mail if he posted
a picture of one his grand-children and provided their date of birth on his SA bio? Even if he provided an
alternative explanation via a live press conference, you would not believe he was telling the truth.


You seem to think the only thing that motivates people is wealth. If that is all you have ever seen people
motivated by, you have lead an impoverished life.


In the end, it doesn't matter whether the e-mail is real or not. You still don't know what his motives were.

Why does he need to give a reason to anyone at all? Particularly short sellers who want to make all sorts of
assumptions about it. You don't seem to acknowledge that he is getting much closer to the end of his working
career than the start so surely he can do what he likes now without having to justify anhthing to anyone. My
guess is it was mutually decided that they move in a different direction with someone who possibly has more
years to give as they roll into the next phase - expansion and commercial sales. He was well compensated
and leaves with all benefits, pretty good outcome for all. Given where they are now I would expect they could
attract some pretty experienced candidates and in the meantime they seem to have a very capable interim
CFO (maybe he becomes the long term choice).

What's up with all these Uni-whatever names that have almost no comments except in UNIS threads? Is that you
Shortall?


Lots of Uni-tards in this and other threads. I hope SeekingAlpha is cracking down on company management or paid
touts that are pumping stocks in the comments section.

Boy did I call this right before a huge news story broke about UNIS paid touts.

The issue is how much time this financing has bought. It does seem to me that UNIS' ultimate prospects are bleak but
it's a much less actionable idea if they aren't insolvent until late 2016.

It's hard to see how they aren't insolvent in the next several quarters with their current burn rate. Late 2016? This will
be a zero far sooner than that.


27 Mar 2014, 04:30 PM


Aharon Levy, Contributor
Yup, could be I was a little too back-of-the-envelope on that; was assuming the debt raise would last until mid-
2015 and there would be another equity raise at some point. STSI shows that companies can wobble on the
brink of insolvency for years if they have a shareholder base that believes whatever story they're peddling.
Things end badly eventually; it's just a question of when...


27 Mar 2014, 04:54 PM


ikarus
I don't think there is going to be any equity raise any time soon after Rick Pearson's article today LOL!


27 Mar 2014, 09:33 PM

See below and above for people who still believe...


27 Mar 2014, 09:35 PM


silence_twain
I have been battling the STSI shareholder base for years. They are even more fanatical than the UNIS
shareholder base. I think you could dilute STSI tomorrow by 100% with no plan in site and the shareholder
base would still believe. I think UNIS plays out like UNXL. UNXL looked to the average investor like they had
everything in place, but come production time, the facade came off. That is what I think happens to UNIS.


28 Mar 2014, 08:07 AM


EquityTrader1975
where have you guys been, UNIS has contracts, got product approved , obtained financing, all though not great
terms, can now produce, and now can sell them for money, and live happily ever after....geez things take time, all up
from here. close short and go long. the bank would not have gave them 60 M without doing there home work, without
high probability to repay, they don't get 60m

Funny, go long on this penny stock company and you will lose as it hits the two's soon.

I actually like Charles Fox's articles and insights. However, he's not the only one so bullish. Roth, Cowen, Bigger
Capital and others are betting big on PLUG. The company is certainly a speculative play, and unless is day trading it,
must buy at reasonable levels (subjective) and keep a longer term horizon.


The criticisms and accusations on Unilife could either prove to accurate or completely unfair. A lot of credible
institutions would beg to differ with the author's perspective. Time will tell


30 Mar 2014, 02:34 AM


ikarus
Roth and Cowen were betting on the secondary business. After the secondary pump and dump was finished
they downgraded PLUG to hold.


The Unilife facts (not accusations) are true, the facts are in and there isn't much to debate at this point, just a
matter of time.


30 Mar 2014, 02:08 PM


EquityTrader1975
what are you talking 60M, contract make products sell them, its that simple


04 Apr 2014, 03:47 PM


ikarus
UNIS makes products at a negative gross margin... or would if they actually made products. Their cost structure is not
now, nor will it ever be, competitive with BDX. That's all there is to say about that.


The $60mm is a loan to own agreement backed by the assets UNIS has spent so much shareholder capital on. It is
effectively a wealth transfer from UNIS equity holders to Orbimed. The equity will be wiped out when UNIS defaults on
the debt.
