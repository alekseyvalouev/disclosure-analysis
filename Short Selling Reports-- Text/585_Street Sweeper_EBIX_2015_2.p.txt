EBIX: Caught With Its Hand In The Cookie Jar

Summary


Ebix has skyrocketed since the company beat fourth-quarter profit estimates with the
help of a handy accounting gain that spared the firm from delivering an outright miss
instead.


Ebix booked that gain after quietly reversing a potential earn-out payment that it had
likely earmarked for an acquisition target that just helped the company win a gigantic
contract.


After relying so heavily on those earn-out reversals to boost its reported profits, Ebix
could soon wind up emptying its favorite cookie jar.

Editor's Note: To simplify matters, TheStreetSweeper has provided links to many of the
documents that it used to prepare this investigative report - along with the detailed
instructions necessary to replicate its calculations and verify its claims - in a lengthy series
of endnotes that appear at the bottom of this story.


Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) better learn how to control its appetite. The last time that the hungry
rollup company raided the cookie jar, the firm may have finally pushed its luck a little bit
too far.


After relying on a blatant accounting trick to artificially sweeten its fourth quarter earnings -
and then concealing the hefty gain that allowed it to beat profit estimates that it would
have otherwise missed - Ebix left behind some rather incriminating evidence. In the formal
10-K report that it filed a few days after it pulled that brazen stunt, the company provided
enough fresh clues to reveal (among other juicy secrets reserved for later stories) the
following:


· Ebix added millions of dollars to its net income last year by impatiently reversing most of
its reserves for potential "earn-out" payments to the very acquisition target responsible for
the celebrated European contract that the company just won.

· Following its acquisition of two companies in the first half of 2014, Ebix swiftly reversed
all of the potential earn-out bonus for the first and most of that for the second by the end of
that same year. Ebix recognized at least a portion of the resulting decline in its earn-out
liabilities as net income and may have aggressively booked far more generous gains
before its recent acquisition targets ever got a legitimate chance to actually prove
themselves.


· After reversing most of the reserves that it established for earn-out payments to many of
the firms that it has purchased in recent years - without formally impairing any of the
goodwill assigned to those companies - Ebix must have finally resigned itself to the
inevitable. Since its goodwill balance increased by a smaller amount than the goodwill
assigned to the firms that it purchased during the fourth quarter, Ebix clearly recognized
some kind of write-down but apparently decided to bury that disturbing evidence.


Ebix ignored a request by TheStreetSweeper to quantify the reserves that it originally
established for each one of the firms that it acquired over the past several years, along
with any adjustments that it made to those contingent liabilities and any gains that it
recorded as a result, in spite of the profound difference that earn-out reversals have
repeatedly made in its financial results.


Recipe for Disaster


As a rollup company that would look virtually worthless without the staggering goodwill on
its balance sheet, Ebix might understandably wish to postpone the dreaded impairment
process for as long as it reasonably can. Given the aggressive formula that Ebix has used
to value both the earn-outs and the goodwill associated with its acquisition deals,
however, the company can only blame itself for any looming impairment charges that it
now faces. By relying on a minuscule 1.75% discount rate to calculate the contingent
liability for potential earn-out payments to acquisition targets that invariably fail to meet its
lofty goals - and then reversing most of the wildly excessive reserves that it established
into its reported earnings - Ebix has practically asked for serious repercussions on down
the road.


"A lower discount rate makes the goodwill higher," noted Dr. J. Edward Katz, a long-time
accounting professor at Penn State University. "When you see these earn-out reversals,
you should also see something happening with impairments to goodwill …


"I'm not sure what the logic is, but FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) rules
don't require impairment," Katz marveled. "That's the perverse effect of the FASB
decision: It allows management significant influence or control in terms of managing

earnings."


No kidding. Ebix has practically bent that flexible rule to the breaking point.


By now, Ebix has purchased so many companies that it should know whether its
acquisition targets stand a reasonable chance of approaching its goals. Once government
authorities began investigating the company for everything from tax evasion to money
laundering a couple of years ago, however, Ebix suddenly lost its touch and started to look
downright clueless, for some curious reason. After reversing a mere $700,000 worth of
earn-out payments into its reported profits during 2012, its official 10-K filings show, Ebix
has since gone on to book more than $10 million worth of gains from those earn-out
reversals - supplying the company with at least 15% of its annual net income - for the past
two years in a row.


The following chart vividly illustrates just how much those earn-out reversals impacted the
company's results in 2014 alone.

The Bitter Truth


If anything, Ebix has grown increasingly impatient to reverse earn-out payments into its
reported profits over the course of the past year. It clearly jumped the gun in at least one
case that looks impossible to justify, and it may have exercised even less restraint in a
couple of others that could prove equally difficult to explain.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038836-ebix-caught-with-its-hand-in-the-cookie-jar 4/21


Let's start by focusing on the example with the highest shock value right now.


When Ebix announced its purchase of Qatarlyst back in the spring of 2013, the company
pointed directly at the gigantic overseas contract that it recently won as one of the primary
drivers behind that acquisition deal. Under the official terms of that buyout agreement, its
regulatory filings show, Ebix offered to supplement its $5 million upfront payment for
Qatarlyst - an obscure firm with little revenue (let alone profits) at the time - by rewarding
the company with potential earn-out bonuses if it managed to achieve certain revenue
targets over the course of the following three years. Based upon the balance in its
contingent liability account for earn-out payments at the end of 2013, its 10-K report for
that year reveals, Ebix must have reserved $9.45 million (after currency adjustments) -
almost twice as much as it initially spent on Qatarlyst in the first place - to cover those
potential bonus payments.


Fast forward to the very next year. Armed with its new partner, Ebix submitted a formal bid
to oversee a massive insurance exchange in London and then seemed to lose its faith in
the company that it had purchased to bolster its chances of securing that valuable
contract. Ebix slashed its reserves for potential earn-out payments to Qatarlyst by $5.83
million during the third quarter of 2014 alone, its regulatory filings indicate, and booked the
resulting gain as net income without bothering to identify its actual source. After that, its
recent 10-K further suggests, Ebix most likely reversed another $2.7 million worth of those
earn-outs into its profits during the fourth quarter - with that handy gain accounting for the
generous upside that it reported instead of a disappointment miss - even as the two-way
contest for its cherished London contract progressed toward a favorable end.


Take a look at the following chart, prepared with painstaking effort by relying entirely on
the figures that Ebix has stingily disclosed to fill in any holes, for a striking snapshot of the
numeric evidence meticulously extracted through that laborious exercise.

Unappetizing Alternatives


If Ebix refrained from actually booking a gain on the earn-out that it reversed for Qatarlyst
last quarter, it must have taken an even more aggressive step by recognizing gains on the
earn-out payments that it cancelled for companies that it had just acquired earlier that
same year.


Ebix has disclosed just enough information to establish this much for sure. Following its
acquisition of Healthcare Magic in the second quarter of 2014, Ebix trimmed its reserves
for potential earn-out payments to that company and booked the resulting gain as net
income the very quarter after it closed that brand-new acquisition deal. Since Ebix had
already set that precedent by the time that it reversed a whopping $4.124 million worth of
potential earn-outs for Healthcare Magic in the following quarter, the company may have
felt comfortable enough to book a hefty gain on that steep reduction in its contingent
liability without thinking twice about crossing the line.


The remaining possibility looks just as bad, if not even worse. When Ebix "purchased"
CurePet in the first quarter of last year, it basically got that company for free. Instead of
shelling out any cash to cover an upfront payment for that acquisition deal, Ebix simply

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038836-ebix-caught-with-its-hand-in-the-cookie-jar 6/21


agreed to forgive the debts that CurePet owed to the company and offered to reward the
firm with future bonuses if it could achieve certain revenue targets over the course of the
next several years. Toward the end of 2014 - the first year in that ongoing, 36-month
evaluation period - Ebix actually indicated that CurePet would soon get the chance to start
meeting those goals.


"These number do not include any contribution from our pet exchange," Ebix Vice
President Darren Johnson emphasized last November, when the company hosted its
third-quarter conference call. "We expect to start generating revenues from two key
veterinary schools, beginning Q1 2015."


Instead of waiting a few short months to see if that new business actually started to
materialize, however, Ebix inexplicably reversed the entire $1.614 million that it had
earmarked for potential bonus payments to CurePet during the final quarter of last year.
Whether or not Ebix aggressively booked a gain on the cancellation of that particular earn-
out remains to be seen; only the company itself can say for sure. Regardless, this much
looks perfectly clear. Given the lack of alternative possibilities afforded by its own financial
disclosures, Ebix relied on the earn-outs that it reversed for at least one of the acquisition
targets highlighted so far to supply the handy gain responsible for its "blowout" fourth-
quarter results.


A Horrible Desert


Don't be surprised if Ebix starts impairing its goodwill pretty soon. At this point, even the
company itself must have finally realized that it cannot avoid that treacherous process
forever. The firm recently lowered the value of the goodwill that it had recorded on its
balance sheet prior to last quarter, after all, even though it stopped short of reporting a
formal impairment charge that might set off an immediate alarm.


Ebix probably should have double-checked its math, however, if it hoped to cover its
tracks well enough to limit any risk of easy detection. Instead, Ebix made at least one
glaring mistake that, in turn, called attention to yet another that might have otherwise
remained hidden for a while.


Let's go ahead and expose both of those buried secrets right now. Despite the $60.2
million worth of goodwill that Ebix assigned to the firms that it acquired during the fourth
quarter of last year, its regulatory filings show, the company reported a smaller $52 million
sequential rise in its goodwill balance for that very same period. Ebix also recorded a
curious $2.13 million sequential decline in its earn-out liabilities for newly acquired
businesses during the fourth quarter, its financial statements further reveal, even though it

had just purchased three different companies and offered every one of them some kind of
future bonus (while reserving an estimated $3.61 million to cover those potential earn-out
payments) as an incentive for meeting it financial goals.


If Ebix disguised the equivalent of an impairment charge by making adjustments
elsewhere on its balance sheet, the inexplicable reductions in both its goodwill balance
and its earn-out liabilities for newly acquired businesses actually start to make a whole lot
of sense.


Leftover Crumbs


Unless Ebix can somehow come up with a more logical explanation of its own, the
company should probably forget about even trying to raid its favorite cookie jar again.
Granted, with less than $5.5 million worth of earn-outs left to reverse - down from more
than triple that amount in mid-2014 - Ebix might have found itself scrounging around for a
few leftover crumbs pretty soon, anyway.


Either way, Ebix better hope for a miracle that's powerful enough to finally transform the
company into a legitimate success. Otherwise, Ebix could swiftly run out of reasons to
brag and face the uncomfortable prospect of apologizing for its lackluster performance
instead.


Talk about a radical idea. The last time that Ebix beat consensus estimates by reversing
an earn-into its reported profits - quietly booking a $2.7 million gain that matched the
estimated reduction in potential bonuses for a firm that had just provided the company
with a fresh excuse to brag - its leader sounded far too proud to even consider such an
embarrassing possibility. Simply review a few of the boastful comments that Ebix CEO
Robin Raina made during the company's most recent conference call, and try to imagine
him ever swallowing his enormous pride.


"In recent times, there has been a lot of press and speculation regarding the London
marketplace reinsurance aggregation exchange," Raina happily volunteered as a
tantalizing reminder of the rumors that had recently set the company's volatile stock on
fire. "I can now confirm that, after an extensive evaluation, Ebix has been selected to
deploy the entire aggregation exchange. At this point, for confidentiality and competitive
reasons, I cannot divulge any more details on the start date and the size of this proposed
exchange, except to say that it is planned to be the world's leading reinsurance exchange
for arguably the largest insurance market in the world …

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038836-ebix-caught-with-its-hand-in-the-cookie-jar 8/21


"Ebix has delivered a very strong finish to the year, with record revenues, great earnings
and operating cash flows," Raina had by then already declared without bothering to
mention the handy gain that happened to provide the company with any sort of bragging
rights at all. Meanwhile, "we made progress on a number of fronts in the year 2014
towards making the company even more transparent and predictable for our shareholders
… We will continue to endeavor to deliver shareholder value on a recurring and an as-is
basis. We intend to do that through increased transparency, better outreach, accretive
acquisitions, a focus on high-margin services, dividends and ongoing share buybacks.


"Q4 of 2014 was an example of that effort."


Be careful. Given all of the disturbing revelations in this report (documented in the detailed
endnotes below), that glorious promise now sounds more like a dangerous threat instead.

[i] Based upon its cash flow statement, Ebix spent $2.25 million to satisfy its remaining
earn-out obligation to Taimma in the second quarter of 2014.


[ii] Ebix specifically disclosed the fair value of its contingent liability for any remaining earn-
out obligations to PlanetSoft, pegging that number at $992,000, in its formal 10-K report
for 2013.


[iii] Ebix must have reversed the $992,000 left over for potential earn-out payments to
PlanetSoft during the first quarter of 2014 (even if the company forgot to mention it), since
it dropped PlanetSoft from its list of firms with outstanding earn-out liabilities the following
quarter after reporting no reversals for that period.


[iv] While Ebix did not quantify its earn-out liability for TriSystems at the end of 2013, it
disclosed just enough information about its remaining earn-out liabilities to arrive at that
$1.753 million figure.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038836-ebix-caught-with-its-hand-in-the-cookie-jar 9/21


[v] Since Ebix reversed a total of $1.762 million worth of earn-outs during the first quarter
of 2014, with PlanetSoft accounting for $992,000 of that, the company must have reversed
the remaining $770,000 for cancelled bonuses to TriSystems given the absence of
alternative possibilities. Plus, management specifically identified PlanetSoft and
TriSystems as the sources of the earn-outs that the company reversed into its net income
during its first-quarter conference call.


[vi] Based upon the figures calculated so far, along with the specific update that Ebix
would provide a few months later, the company reduced the contingent liability for
potential earn-out payments to TriSystems by $419,000 during the third quarter of 2014.


[vii] Ebix disclosed the payment of a $563,000 earn-out to TriSystems in its cash flow
statement for the fourth quarter of 2014 and reported no remaining contingent liability for
potential bonuses to that company at the end of last year.


[viii] As the only firm that Ebix acquired during 2013, Qatarlyst must have accounted for
the entire $9.425 million addition to its contingent liability for earn-out payments that year.


[ix] Ebix reported that its total contingent liability for potential earn-out payments declined
from $17.209 million to $10.85 million between the second and the third quarters of last
year. Since Ebix reduced its earn-out liabilities for TriSystems and HealthCare Magic by
$419,000 and $107,000, respectively during the third quarter of 2014 (as explained more
fully in other endnotes focused specifically on those firms), the company must have
reversed $5.833 million worth of potential earn-out payments for Qatarlyst during that
period to account for the rest of the sizable decline in its reserves for those outstanding
liabilities.


[x] Ebix reported that its total contingent liability for potential earn-out payments shrunk
from $10.85 million in the third quarter of 2014 to $5.367 million in the final quarter of the
year. Based upon specific disclosures about the increases and decreases in earn-out
liabilities for newly acquired firms (detailed in some of the endnotes that will soon follow),
Ebix reversed another $2.704 million worth of potential earn-out payments to Qatarlyst
during the fourth quarter - the very size of the gain that allowed the company to beat top-
line estimates instead of delivering an outright miss.


[xi] When Ebix carried out its sole "acquisition" deal in the first quarter of 2014, it gained
control of CurePet for essentially free but earmarked $1.614 million for potential bonus
payments to the company.

5/22/2018 EBIX: Caught With Its Hand In The Cookie Jar - Ebix Inc (NASDAQ:EBIX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038836-ebix-caught-with-its-hand-in-the-cookie-jar 10/21


[xii] After reserving $1.614 million for potential bonus payments to CurePet when it
acquired that firm during the first quarter of 2014, Ebix disclosed that it had written down
the fair value of that contingent liability to "zero" during the final quarter of the very same
year.


[xiii] Following its acquisition of HealthCare Magic in the second quarter of 2014, Ebix
specifically disclosed that it had reserved $4.83 million to cover potential earn-out
payments for that company.


[xiv] Ebix trimmed its contingent liability for potential bonus payments to HealthCare Magic
from $4.83 million to $4.72 million between the second and third quarters of last year.
Given the lack of adjustments to its earn-out liabilities for newly acquired firms, Ebix must
have actually booked a gain on the reduction in its earn-out liability for HealthCare Magic
within a few short months of purchasing that company.


[xv] Ebix slashed the fair value of the continent liability for potential earn-out payments to
HealthCare Magic by $4.12 million, leaving just $596,000 to cover possible bonuses for
the company, during the final quarter of last year. Unless Ebix aggressively booked a
handsome gain on the reversal of an earn-out for a company that it had just acquired two
quarters earlier - a move that's impossible to rule out entirely after the gain that it recorded
the previous quarter - it probably accounted for that massive reduction in the line item
dedicated to earn-out liabilities for newly acquired businesses instead. If so, Ebix almost
certainly relied on the estimated $2.7 million reduction in its contingent liability for potential
earn-out payments to Qatarlyst for the handy gain that salvaged its most recent quarterly
results.


[xvi] Ebix purchased three different firms in the fourth quarter of 2014 - Vertex, i3 Software
and Oakstone - and disclosed that it had offered every one of them some kind of earn-out
payment without specifically quantifying the fair value of those contingent liabilities. In the
new 10-K that it filed earlier this month, however, Ebix did report that it had reserved a
total of $4.312 million for potential earn-out payments to its newly acquired business over
the course of the past year. Based upon that figure and the details provided about the
earn-out liability for HealthCare Magic (outlined in previous endnotes), Ebix reserved an
estimated $3.61 million to cover future bonus payments to the companies that it acquired
during its year-end shopping spree.

What a load of BS!


EBIX:


- Massive buyback (http://seekingalpha.co...) 
- Won a major London contract (http://onforb.es/1yteebR) 
- Added an activist on board, Barrington (http://seekingalpha.co...) 
- Resumed growth (http://seekingalpha.co...) 
- 4 big banks gave EBIX a new $150M credit facility (http://bit.ly/1yteh7n) 
- IRS investigation was concluded successfully (http://seekingalpha.co...)


And add to all that incredible cashflow generation, very high margins and accretive acquisitions.


Desperate, amateur shorts (and shorts employees like this Melissa Davis) are rightfully and completely under water.


Don't fall under all this crap and hold your shares. Strong Buy.

TheGribbler
So, in sum, what Street Sweeper refers to as a "blatant accounting trick" is actually just EBIX complying with U.S.
GAAP for purchase accounting while not overpaying for acquisitions. Moreover, this same issue has been highlighted
for many years by Copperfield et al., and at this point all sophisticated investors are aware of the accounting
mechanics and adjust valuation techniques accordingly.


http://pwc.to/1bJLqXA


(From p.2)


"Under the M&A Standards, buyers must recognize 
earnouts on the acquisition date. Therefore, even though 
the buyer and seller do not agree on the total purchase 
price, the buyer is now required to determine the fair value 
of the earnout and recognize that amount in the purchase 
price on the acquisition date. In addition, the buyer will be 
required to recognize the change in the fair value of most 
earnouts in earnings. Fair value changes from period to 
period will introduce an element of earnings volatility in the 
buyer's post acquisition financial reporting."

I wonder if they will start another bear raid on this one now that it has reached fair value.


What to do with all these unrealized gains, I hate taxes!


30 Mar 2015, 01:55 PM


BienVista Research, Contributor
Fair value? No mate, it's far from. Around $40-50 maybe so. They resumed growth big time, don't forget.


And no one is impressed by this pathetic short piece that even contradicts the author's website policies!


30 Mar 2015, 01:59 PM


Eudaimonia, Contributor
HerrX, fair value is a very wide term, at $13 this was clearly below fair value, you cannot easily make that
statement today.


30 Mar 2015, 03:22 PM


BienVista Research, Contributor
Obviously at $13 it was a massive bargain. At $30 it's still cheap based on a DCF analysis assuming 15-20%
EPS growth with a 12% discount rate. 
That's for a regular company. Here you need to consider the buyback (shrinking float) with over 30% of that
float short... a short squeeze is coming sooner or later. Plus, other similar SaaS companies without shorts are
trading at  much higher multiples. 
I'm only considering selling EBIX with the current situation above $45 if the short % stay close to 15-20%.

So the owners of Street Sweeper have short positions. That could mean that they were the original shorters
from several years back and the ones who are deeply underwater now. I wouldn't institute a new short
position based upon known facts and this so called research. Which hedge funds own Street Sweeper
anyway?

Ray_Rich
Author left out the part that states "Ebix was cleared by IRS" and "Ebix was forwarded a gigantic credit line by a group
of large banks" and "Ebix just won a huge contract in Europe"


The most important part that was missed was in the disclosure it should read something like this. "Melissa Davis
wrote this article while being paid by individuals with major short interest in this stock, this article has the intention for
dropping the price so these unnamed shorts can get out without going bankrupt. By doing this Melissa Davis has lost
all present and future credibility as a journalist of any sort"

I find it humorous that Street Sweeper spent so much effort and energy reconciling EBIX's contingent liabilities, trying
to prove that EBIX would have only met but not beaten "consensus estimates" but for EBIX's earn-out reversals.


Perhaps someone should inform Street Sweeper that the "consensus estimates" that it holds in such high esteem are
actually only from a single analyst who now has a $38 price target on the stock. So, accordingly to Street Sweeper's

Shorts should be more careful who hears about ebix. 800k potential new investors just put ebix on a lot of radars, and
more will be buying than shorting. The question remains, how do you cover 11 million shares without losing
everything.


30 Mar 2015, 02:22 PM

Wow this is front news on Seekingalpha. I hope Barington Capital responds first hand, that would be amazing. They

This article shows that the shorts aren't through yet. Still approx 11 million shares short. It's not over yet.

Really, really deceptive writing. Notice in this paragraph:


"A lower discount rate makes the goodwill higher," noted Dr. J. Edward Katz, a long-time accounting professor at
Penn State University. "When you see these earn-out reversals, you should also see something happening with
impairments to goodwill …


"I'm not sure what the logic is, but FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) rules don't require impairment," Katz
marveled. "That's the perverse effect of the FASB decision: It allows management significant influence or control in
terms of managing earnings."


The author tries to make you think that some professor is talking about Ebix, but that isn't the case if you look
carefully. This is probably some quote given at some other time regarding the FASB's rules, and taken completely out
of context and manipulated to make it appear like the speaker was talking about Ebix, but wasn't.


30 Mar 2015, 02:26 PM


p2invest
Didn't even bother to get his name right. It's J Edwards Ketz and not Katz. Funny how she didn't bother to
document his quotes but took the time to document many other things. Mr Yu, Gotham City Research,
contacted Ketz for company accounting generalities and nothing specific to Ebix. These too sound like
generalities and not company specific.

NoITAll2000
Clearly a desperation move by a tightly squeezed short.  
If this is all their microscopic examination of the 10K could find, then longs can relax.  
It's all kosher and mirrors practices at many other acquisitive firms.  
Indeed it shows EBIX's conservatism when initially booking the reserve inasmuch as it rarely has to pay out the
maximum amounts. 
Mr. Market today has shown great resilience to this hogwash. Look for the stock to resume its upward gain as the
shorts realize their strategy has failed. 
Note the short interest only fell about 2% over the past reporting 2-week period. 
There is still almost 11mm shares short. Lots more margin calls a-coming.

Nice try - I am buying more today


30 Mar 2015, 03:06 PM

Me too. This article just showed me how desperate shorts are. Ebix will rally like a rocket when shorts have to
cover those 11m shares.

Shorts need to invest more in buying better quality writers. God, shorts must be hurting big time. Their short positions
are sooooo underwater with no way out. I hope Ms Davis got her money up front. Mr Short might be broke by year

You and all your shorts friends are at least $15 underwater this will be fun watching you guys try to unravel this

At least Gotham's had some amount of truth to it, although the overreaction in price compared to the slap on
the wrist fine they got was overblown by about 50-to-1. This article smacks of desperation and the writing is
so over the top it isn't even remotely believable. I actually think EBIX is fairly valued right now and would sell if
it weren't for the huge short amount that has to cover.


30 Mar 2015, 05:33 PM


WallStPirate
Yes it is fairly valued if the short position was less than 10% but over 30% means lots more upside.


We all need to remember that EBIX's mngt cannot stand these guys for what they said and did to them and now the
tide has changed. Ebix has momo, an activist on board growing earnings and a lot of money left to buy back stock.


Maybe mngt and activists will tag team the shorts and break them.


either way it feels good to be on the long side of this trade.

Sunil Shah, Contributor
Everything written in this article is factually correct. The author diligently outlines items she is not sure about (that
cannot be unequivocally gleaned) but she inferred from 2 consecutive quarterly balance sheets.


The problem is outlined quite clearly in the 3q 2014 10 Q: 
From EBIX's 10 Q for 3Q 2014:


“During the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 these aggregate  
contingent accrued earn-out business acquisition consideration liabilities,  
were reduced by $5.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively, and during the  
nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 these contingent liabilities  
were reduced by $7.5 million and $10.3 million, respectively, due to  
remeasurements as based on the then assessed fair value and changes in  
anticipated future revenue levels. These reductions to the contingent  
accrued earn-out liabilities resulted in corresponding reduction to general  
and administrative expenses as reported on the Condensed Consolidated  
Statements of Income.”


EBIX is, as a result of its accounting treatment, creating a balance sheet  
contingency reserve on acquisition, that is in subsequent periods, released  
to the P&L to synthetically reduce operating expenses and raise the profit  
margin.


That is the factual truth.


For calendar 2014, the earn-out release amounted $10.2m, on a pre-tax profit of $77m (or 13% ! of income).

5/22/2018 EBIX: Caught With Its Hand In The Cookie Jar - Ebix Inc (NASDAQ:EBIX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3038836-ebix-caught-with-its-hand-in-the-cookie-jar 17/21


Now let's be clear: 
-this is consistent with GAAP 
-there is nothing awry in their accounting treatment


HOWEVER EBIX does itself a huge injustice.


Anything that can be construed as an ' accounting trick' will be detrimental to Ebix's long term interests. I am
unambiguously (as a seasoned CA) of the opinion that this constant synthetic reduction of G&A expenses can be
regarded as a deception, as it manifests itself as a significant detraction from profit when arriving at the cashflow and
artificially raises the operating margin. (I only discovered it after going through the cashflow with a magnifying glass,
and less informed investors are quite likely to cry wolf.)


In my opinion the problem stems (as mentioned by the author) from using a ridiculous discount rate of 1.75%. This
might be the cost of Ebix debt, but it certainly isnt the COST OF EQUITY. THIS PALTRY RATE HAS THE EFFECT
OF RAISING THE GOODWILL AND THE EARNOUT LIABILITY on acquisition. As time progresses there is then the
need of a future adjustment. And this is what the author is correctly highlighting.


You need to know 2 things: 
-I have informed management how their accounting could easily be construed as deceptive. I am confident that there
will be less scope for 'manipulation' in the future; partly because investors know and partly because the earnout
reserve has already been exhausted. (To EBIX MGMT: And dont try to inflate it further with another acquisition +
inflated goodwill + earnout liability. ) 
-I am very long EBIX. It's a company I have followed for years and have been very vocal and bullish about - here on
SA (see my articles) - especially during the Copperfield short attack. I am still very long, despite the recent run. 
-I believe, despite the 'revelations' in this article, EBIX shareholders can look forward to a very rewarding
future....Revenue growth is about to accelerate and we are moving to a new ballpark in terms of contract wins. The
secular story of insurance carriers outsourcing their back and middle office plays right into EBIX's sweetspot. The
hard work has been done already, now it's a question of gaining territories and new markets by an established and
legitimate player. 
-Even after abstracting for this accounting gimmickry, on a cashflow basis this company is cheap. Real cheap given
its prospects.


(EBIX Mgmt: as long as you dont sell out like you almost did at $20 to Goldman Sachs!!)


30 Mar 2015, 06:20 PM


p2invest
The only time that I would fear any Goodwill impairment charges is if they were so substantial as to cause a
loan default. Could that happen with Ebix? I doubt it. Otherwise, it is just part of accounting regulation.
Goodwill can be manipulated for sure, but it is a part of acquisitions and so are earn-outs. Implying that it's a
sinister plot by keeping unearned earn-outs or not taking Goodwill impairments after each quarter is pulling at
straws that don't exist in most organizations since Goodwill is revalued by most companies on an annual
basis or after some unexpected large event.

Amazing how many people cannot really tear apart an income statement and balance sheet. To make it really simple
for these poor Street Sleepers, Over the past 4 years the company has reported Net Income of around $260 million
and... 
voila...they have reported cash flow from operations of about the same amount. Sure there are "puts and takes" (as
there are in all companies) and roll-ups DO create difficulty in tracking the accounting...BUT at the end of the day the
cash is there and since the value of an equity is the present value of future CASH FLOWS, the stock is valued based
on those future expectations and it would appear that over a period of time reported earnings (even if you wish to
quibble about them...and you can with ANY company) seem to translate to cash flow, so Mr. Market seems to be right
and the Street gang has taken on the wrong company.

much more EBIX, so I guess I'd like to see it at $10 the same you do, but won't happen this time.


Many things are different this time from previous selloffs.

Ha ha ha! You use J. Edward Ketz as your quote source. He seems to be full of quotes. Was this a leftover quote from
him that Mr Yu didn't use in his Gotham City Research hit piece, The Truth About Robin Raina's Ebix: Part I? Or is
this a fresh one from the same man? What's your connection with Mr Yu (Gotham City Research) and for that matter,
Cooperfield Research? Same source of funding?

According to an SEC filing on 3/30, Rennes Foundation, the previously biggest institutional shareholder of EBIX, just
told 3.6M shares. Is it why we have not seen short squeeze so far?

Why would you embarrass yourself with this post. It shows you don't know how to read an SEC filing (thus
you shouldn't be posting what you know nothing about.) The Foundation filing showed a "D" for Direct
Ownership of the shares (as opposed to indirect) and has nothing to do with the kind of "D" that is used when
insiders "dispose" of shares. In addition, you clearly did not read the 13-G which was filed.


Now, would you like to apologize for attempting to mislead people or will you just disappear into a new ID
(noting that you have all of 3 posts in your SA career.)

Thank you for correcting me on this. But if you check morningstar.com it also shows Rennes disposed 3.6m shares as
of 2/23. Any thoughts?

I got the impression that 3.6m shares were so by taking the difference of 13d filed in May 2013, which shows Rennes
owned 7.2m shares as then, and most recent 13g filing, which shows they now only owned 3.6m. Is it the correct way
for tracking institution activities? I am new to investing and any tip is appreciated.


I am also curious why morningstar knew the activity ahead of SEC filing?

TheGribbler
From my memory, the 7.2m filing shares was because Rennes entered into the voting agreement with
Goldman and Robin Raina in connection with the proposed acquisition by Goldman. Because of the voting
agreement, the group was considered to all have beneficial interest in each other's shares from a regulatory
perspective. Basically, just a technicality.


I think I saw the other day that Rennes may have increased its stake by 60,000 shares but it largely has not
changed much over the past few years.


PS - It's usually better to get your info straight from the sec.gov website instead of relying on third party sites
like Morningstar which just aggregate info from the SEC.

EBIX's accounting is fine. How else would they account for earn-outs that don't materialize? They hold a liability on
their balance sheet and release the liability under SG&A on their income statement if an objective for an earn-out is
not achieved (in a cash earn-out, changes to the fair value of the earn-outs are recorded on the income statement
while the fair value is recorded as a liability on their balance sheet). While reversing the earn-out does increase
margins (perhaps confusingly due to timing) and earnings volatility, cash outflows for payments of the earn-outs that
are achieved are recorded on the cash flow statement under cash flows from investing activities. In other words, the
acquired company is holding a warrant whose strike is a revenue target and EBIX, who sold the warrant (and got a
lower purchase price for issuing it), holds a liability on their balance sheet to reflect it. If you wanted to get a real
sense of their margins, just strip these earn-out reversals from their SG&A and you'll get a real picture of earnings.  
And when you do that, even though the earnings will be different from the expectation of the one analyst who follows
the company (both positive and negative), the earnings statement will be impressive and consistent with the cash flow
statement.
