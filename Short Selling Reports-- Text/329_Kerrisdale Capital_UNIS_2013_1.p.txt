Unilife: History Of Missed Deadlines, Aggressive Cash Burn, And
Vague Supply Agreements Suggest A 75% Overvaluation
Dec. 4, 2013 9:45 AM ET20 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


We believe that shares of Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS) are more than 75% overvalued as
investors have once again overreacted to deal announcements heavy on lofty potentials
but light on detail.


Unilife Corporation is a research-stage medical needle business founded in 2002 through
a reverse merger into a publicly-traded shell. Unilife purports to have created revolutionary
syringe designs that are differentiated from the wide range of safety needles produced by
industry leaders like Becton Dickinson and Covidien. The world isn't wanting for syringe
designs; a simple search for "safety syringe" at the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Offices
reveals 565 separate patents. Nonetheless, Unilife continues to tout a series of
exploratory supply agreements even though the business has yet to prove it can
effectively ramp production in a cost-effective, quality-controlled manner. Over the past
five years, Unilife has generated just $9.4m in product revenue, all of which was derived
from very basic contract manufacturing. In exchange for these meager results, Unilife has
burned through nearly $200m of cash since fiscal 2006.


The Hikma Agreement


In a sequence reminiscent of the 2003 and 2009 episodic pops in Unilife's price, shares
climbed by over 50% following the announcement of a new supply agreement with Hikma.
The stock appreciated a further 17% on December 3rd after Unilife reported a nebulous
supply arrangement with Novartis. While the Novartis arrangement offers nothing in
guaranteed revenue, the Hikma agreement promises $5m of upfront cash. Unilife is also
eligible for a $15m payment in 2014, assuming certain milestones are met, and another

$20m from Hikma in 2015. At a discount rate of 10%, the present value of these payments
is just $35m. This is just one-sixth of the $210m market capitalization gain Unilife has
realized in the days following the announcement.


The market appears to have attributed $175m, or more than $1.70/share, to hypothetical
future product sales to Hikma and Novartis. Sellside analysts, whose firms are typically
enriched by Unilife's frequent share issuances, have focused on the minimum unit volume
figures reported in the Hikma announcement (the Novartis arrangement doesn't include
volume targets). We were surprised to see that Hikma itself failed to mention specific
volume targets on its own website. Given the discrepancy, we question whether the
volume targets actually represent a guaranteed revenue stream, or if instead, this is
merely a minimum buying threshold that Hikma must fulfill to maintain exclusivity. We ask
the question because Unilife's volume targets for Sanofi's Lovenox only relate to
exclusivity, "After the completion of the 4-year ramp-up period, Sanofi would be required to
purchase a minimum of 150 million units per year from Unilife to maintain their exclusivity"
(FQ4 2013 call).


An extreme degree of skepticism is warranted because Unilife has a long history of over-
promising, missing production deadlines, and disappointing its investor base. This
narrative extends back to January 2004 when Unilife gave assurances that 65 million
retractable hypodermic needles would be "pouring off an imported assembly line" within
months. This hyped up timeline produced a tenfold increase in Unilife's share price, a gain
reminiscent of the stock's price reaction over the past few weeks. Shareholders who
bought into this story ended up losing more than 90% of their investment as the
production targets were never close to being met.


In July 2009, just ahead of its 2010 Nasdaq listing, Unilife excitedly reported their
industrialization agreement with Sanofi. The original press release gave a completion date
of late 2010. Under this timeline, a 2009 corporate presentation from Unilife boasted about
the potential for "revenues of A$400+ beyond 2014." Today, we are five months into fiscal
2014 and Unilife's product sales are non-existent.


If Unilife's history is any guide, the Hikma supply agreement should not be relied upon to
produce near-term product sales. Considering this, along with Unilife's $45m annual cash
burn rate, we judge the 70% jump in Unilife's shares over the past two weeks to be a
severe overreaction. This is particularly true in light of competitors that trade at much
lower valuations. For example, Retractable Technologies (NYSEMKT:RVP) is a syringe
business that has long marketed its VanishPoint and Patent Safe assortments of
retractable needles. RVP has over $30m of legitimate product sales and yet trades at a

market capitalization of just $85m. By comparison, Unilife's $400m market capitalization
on $120,000 of F2013 product sales appears flagrantly overvalued. If we optimistically
believe that Unilife can match the $30m of annual product revenue earned by Retractable
Technologies, we think the business would be worth 3x revenue. At this multiple, UNIS
shares would be worth about $1.00, or more than 75% lower than the current price.


The Novartis Announcement


As the euphoria from the Hikma announcement began to fade, resulting in UNIS shares
plummeting by almost 7% on December 2nd, 2013, Unilife felt compelled to report an
exploratory-stage supply agreement with Novartis. Unlike the Hikma agreement, Novartis
is not paying Unilife an upfront or defined milestone payment. If the agreement had
included guaranteed economics, Unilife would have disclosed the terms as it has in past
announcements.


Instead, Novartis only appears interested in testing Unilife's syringe for a clinical-stage
drug, "Under this agreement, Unilife will supply Novartis with a customized delivery
device...to enable administration of a novel investigational Novartis drug into a targeted
organ in clinical trials." It seems reasonable that Novartis would test every syringe
available on the market, especially for a compound still in early-stage trials. Assessing
every available option in the market fits protocol and is far from a guarantee that Novartis
will choose Unilife over Becton Dickinson, Covidien, or another industry leader in the
future.


To put yesterday's $70m one-day market capitalization gain in perspective, $70m is almost
equal to the entire market capitalization of Retractable Technologies. It is also twice the
amount that Sanofi paid Unilife over a four-year period for the initial industrialization
agreement. This leads us to believe that Unilife's shares trade purely on irrational
exuberance without any regard for the underlying fundamentals of these contracts.


Business Overview


Viewed amongst its medical syringe competitors, Unilife appears to have little reason to
exist. Unilife cannot compete with the cost, technology, and quality-control track record of
the $20bn Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) or $30bn Covidien (COV). Because syringe
technology doesn't change overnight, scale is critical to controlling costs and building a
reputation for quality control. A pharmaceutical executive would be loath to risk damaging
a pivotal clinical trial or damaging the safety record of a multi-billion dollar drug on a faulty
needle. This makes the manufacturing prowess of industry leaders like Becton Dickinson
almost impossible to replicate. One can witness the challenges of building a substantial

syringe business from scratch by studying Retractable Technologies. RVP has long
produced retractable needle designs similar to Unilife's retractable products. But RVP has
been unable to surpass $40m in product sales because BD can always out-compete them
on price and design quality. And yet RVP's $30-40m of product sales dwarf what's been
generated by Unilife.


Unilife is run by Alan Shortall, a promotional CEO who peppers his language with buzz
words like "game changer" and "Holy Grail" while regularly giving enthusiastic YouTube
interviews and investor presentations. Dozens of articles have been penned about
Unilife's checkered past, including a 2004 Sydney Morning report on Unilife's failed
exploits in the Australian market, a 2006 article drawing attention to questionable share
grants, and most recently, an October 2013 article featured in Forbes. These articles
describe a management team that has repeatedly misled investors. As early as 2004, Mr.
Shortall was called out by the press for his unbridled optimism. Shortall defended himself,
saying "This is not a rort, this is not a scam, we are building a legitimate business." But
nine years later, few signs of any meaningful revenues have emerged and shareholders
have suffered from endemic losses.


Unilife's Slipping Timelines


Similar to a speculative biotechnology stock, Unilife has primarily been an equity-funded
venture. Whereas the over-sized returns possible from discovering a novel, multi-billion-
dollar, high-margin pharmaceutical compound might justify this funding model, it seems to
make little sense for a sub-scale manufacturing business. After all, there are only so many
iterations of a plunger, a barrel, and a needle that one can combine into a syringe design.


But this disconnect hasn't prevented Unilife from leaning on an ever-morphing roster of
shareholders to fund its aggressive cash burn rate. Unilife's preferred method of raising
equity is to announce a series of potential production deals just ahead of selling stock.
This rhythmic sequence first began in 2002 after Unilife's Australia-listed shares climbed
to the equivalent of $13 after Shortall promised that Unilife would be producing 65m
retractable needles by March 2004. After Unilife failed to reach this target and continued
to burn investor's cash at a rapid pace, Unilife's shares crashed to below $2.00.


After Unilife's pitch began to lose its appeal to a disillusioned Australian shareholder base,
Unilife decided to take its show to the U.S. in late 2009. Just months ahead of its Nasdaq
listing, Unilife stirred investor excitement again by announcing its industrialization

agreement with Sanofi in July 2009. Shares quickly skyrocketed to over $8.00 as Unilife
captured the imaginations of U.S. investors. But once again, after Unilife's promises failed
to materialize, shares began a multi-year decline and hit $2.50 in late 2012.


Historical insights like these are difficult to gather for two reasons: i) Unilife's current
website does not appear to archive press releases before 2008; and ii) Unilife listed itself
on the Nasdaq exchange in 2009. To find history before this date, one has to go beyond
SEC filings and search third-party news articles and reports filed on the Australian
Exchange. We believe this historical context is important to understanding the Unilife
story.


Where are the Expected Sanofi Revenues?


Long-time Unilife followers will be intimately familiar with the Sanofi partnership that Unilife
has been chasing for more than half a decade. After signing the industrialization
agreement in July 2009, an October 2009 article in BioMed Reports declared that
commercial release of Unilife's Unitract syringe was expected to commence in Q4 2009.
Unilife was scheduled to commence production by the end of 2010 with a targeted annual
capacity of "more than 40 million units" by the end of 2010. The addition of another high-
volume facility was projected to be completed by the end of 2011.


Unsurprisingly, these hurdles were missed as Unilife couldn't deliver initial supply until July
13th, 2011. Unilife's most recent 10-Q states that Unilife continued to recognize revenue
from the industrialization agreement through September 3rd, 2013. This was more than
four years after signing the initial contract. But even so, Unilife continues to boast about its
Sanofi relationship by recently reporting a supply contract for the drug Lovenox. Even after
spending the past four-and-a-half years supposedly building out their manufacturing

capacity, the Lovenox press release states that Unilife requires a brand new four-year
ramp-up period. Leaving aside whether Sanofi actually needs yet another supplier of
Lovenox needles, Unilife's inability to meet their self-imposed deadlines portends
continued delays in the future.


Around the same time, it reported the initial Sanofi contract, Unilife was busy marketing its
Nasdaq listing with a 36-page presentation. This presentation told investors that Unilife
was targeting A$400m of revenue beyond 2014 with a high-production facility that could
manufacture 400 million units per year. Now, just two months away from 2014, even
eternally optimistic sell-side analysts can't bring themselves to model $400m revenue
targets in 2015 or 2016.

The aforementioned BioMed article also reveals that Unilife relied on a Chinese distributor,
Shanghai Kindly Enterprise Development Group ("KDL"), to manufacture its sharps safety
products and West Pharma to manufacture seals for its needles. Strangely, these
outsourced manufacturing agreements are not discussed in the 2011 10-K filing. That a
manufacturing business should be so reliant on third-party distributors should also raise
eyebrows. Dependence on third-party suppliers not only impacts profit margins, it could
also inhibit Unilife's ability to scale production.


Extreme Equity Dilution: Unilife has burned through nearly $200m of shareholder
cash since 2006

Lacking product sales, Unilife has instead thrived as a serial issuer of its own shares.
Even after taking in $6.7m, $5.5m, and $2.7m in R&D revenue from Sanofi over the past
three years, Unilife still manages to burn through ~$45-55m of cash per year. To fund this
deficit, Unilife requires almost biannual secondary sales underwritten by Westor Capital
and many of the coverage banks: Cantor, Jefferies, and Leerink Swan. If market
conditions had been less conducive to speculative small-cap companies, Unilife might
have gone bankrupt long ago.


Looking back to just 2006, Unilife's total cash burn adds to greater than $199 million. This
extreme amount of cash investment has not only failed to translate into large-scale
product sales, it has failed to even generate a meaningful asset base. Unilife had just
$68m of total asset value as of fiscal 2013 year-end, or about one-third of the recent cash
burn.


Ever-eager investment bankers have sanctioned no fewer than ten separate Unilife equity
issuances since May 2006. While investors have probably lost money in each of these
offerings, Unilife has made out extremely well. Secondary share sales have raised $187m
for the business since 2006.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1875491-unilife-history-of-missed-deadlines-aggressive-cash-burn-and-vague-supply-agreements-suggest-a-75-percent-overvaluation


Over time, these secondary share sales would have caused approximately 83% of dilution
for a shareholder that owned Unilife stock in 2006. Said another way, a shareholder that
purchased 1,000 shares of Unilife in 2006 would effectively only own an ownership stake
of 170 shares today.


Many of these offerings have been combined with low-cost warrants to provide a
sweetener for institutional buyers. Unilife's February 2013 offering marketed 4.46m
common shares combined with 1.49m warrants set at a strike of $3.00. In these
arrangements, Unilife only receives upfront proceeds on the common shares. Existing
UNIS shareholders gain nothing from these warrants except for an increasingly lower
economic ownership position in the business.


These cash burn figures actually underestimate the true operating expenses incurred by
the business. A significant portion of executive and employee compensation comes in the
form of non-cash, share-based compensation ("SBC") expense. Unilife has incurred an
additional $44m of this SBC expense since fiscal 2006.


Much of this SBC expense originates from a highly-paid executive team. The
compensation packages shown below are oddly rich for a business that loses around
$45m per year. Executive pay packages have included a $6.1m pay package to Alan
Shortall and $6.5m for COO Ramin Mojdeh in fiscal 2012.

Source: 2013 Unilife Proxy Filing


To allow itself to sell stock more discreetly, in October 2012, Unilife created a Controlled
Equity Offering Sales Agreement. This unorthodox structure allows the company to sell up
to $45m worth of shares for "at-the-market" (ATM) prices. The structure is typically
reserved for risky companies that fail to attract an underwriting bank to manage the
offering on its behalf. Since June, Unilife has issued 6.81m shares under this structure. If
Unilife actually had definitive, long-term contracts in place, we see no reason that a bank
wouldn't support the business with long-term debt financing. Instead, Unilife appears to
prefer continual dilution of its long-suffering shareholder base.


Conclusion


Time and time again, shareholders have underestimated the colossal difficulties in building
a multi-million dollar, high-volume, FDA-approved manufacturing facility that can compete
with the dominant market leader, Becton Dickinson. Some pharmaceutical companies may
use Unilife to extract price concessions from other vendors, or they may be hedging their
supply channels by adding a back-up partner. But we find it extremely unlikely that
Unilife's retractable needles and wearable injectors have really caught the industry by
surprise. We encourage one to look at the severe price corrections Unilife experienced in
2003, 2010, and mostly recently in late-2012 to understand how the recent 70% price
spike might end for new investors.


These new investors are acquiring an inordinately expensive ownership stake in a
seemingly commoditized medical syringe technology. This isn't a "game-changing" cure
for a rare disease or a remarkable new carbon technology. Unilife is a basic manufacturing
business that specializes in a low-cost, commoditized item.


The $210m surge in market capitalization following the Hikma and Novartis arrangements
is unlikely to last. The $40m of contractual payments from Hikma, spread over the next 2
years and contingent on milestone targets, is simply not sufficiently economic to justify the
subsequent 70% rise in share price. But more to the point, Unilife's reputation as a serial
diluter means that it is likely to unload fresh new shares onto the market, either by ATM or
a new secondary at these elevated levels. We believe this serial stock seller could be
misleading shareholders once again.

We don't know what the deals say. For all we know, they were given a deal, but if they prove that they cannot
make the product in scale then they may lose the contract. There is nothing that says these deals are ironclad
or that an amount of syringes must be ordered. Don't forget that they have never mass produced the syringes
before. Maybe those minimum numbers are contingent on factors not talked about in the press release. There
is a lot of mystery surrounding these deals and not everything that glitters is gold.

Author’s reply »  Excluding the meager upfront payments that will be consumed by ongoing operating
expenses, the agreements breathlessly reported by Unilife do not include guaranteed revenue streams.
Rather, they merely disclose the unit volume terms required to maintain exclusivity, a very different concept.

Neither MedIumme, Hikma, nor Novartis has swore off sourcing from BDX or COV. Sanofi already purchases
syringes from leading vendors for Lovenox (a generic), but there's little harm in asking Unilife to test a few of
its designs. These agreements are not proof that Unilife has replaced BDX or COV in major contracts.


It takes a wild stretch of the imagination to believe that Unilife has suddenly reinvented syringe designs in a
way that Becton's $650m R&D budget has overlooked. For example, here's BDX's retractable needle:

injection, simply because the established syringe and injection manufacturers manage is poor and unable to
keep up with industry needs. 
These companies are going the way of the dinasours, and hopefully will take UNIS shorters with them

Author’s reply »  Unilife has marketed its retractable needle designs since at least 2004: http://bit.ly/1g7N0Ce


If this were a step-change in syringe technology, the business would have been producing revenue long ago.

The Unitract syringe has BDX as a inferior competitor, but with huge resources, and therefore UNIS doesn't
need that product competition, and sales staff needed in that market. BDX's retractable syringe faulty or not,
is unbeatable competition and so they just concentrate on exclusive designs that have lots of neat features
(like the fact that they cannot be counterfieted, and patch pumps that need no final sterilising), that offer
advantages unmatched by competition.  
No other UNIS product has any competitors and they are sold only to Pharma's who approach UNIS. This is
why UNIS has no sales people only contract negotiators. 
Keep shorting them, I may be wrong

atrickpay
those contracts mite be for small amounts. And that contracts for large amounts, tend to go to those established
syringe companies who have built-up reputations and track records

KCM, thanks for providing the financial historical perspective (along with Dr. Akston in the previous SA article). No
question, UNIS does not get high marks for past execution, setting expectations, or management compensation. A
few comments:


1) It would have been instructive to provide a comparison of cash burn, dilution and earning trajectory for other
successful & unsuccessful start-ups in the medical devices sector. Context is everything.


2) $199M spent - $68M in assets: What ratio of expended capital to tangible assets would you have expected them to
achieve? They had bills and salaries (albiet, some excessive) to pay.


3) Product Differentiation - BD's solutions are anything but "sexy". BD's R&D budget is spent on reducing cost for high
production rate items. It would be absurd for UNIS to attempt to compete on price (at least initially). UNIS is offering
specialty products (boutique products, if you will) to help differentiate their customer's products. Price is not
everything.


4) Patents - You seem to place no value on their device patents. Again, they are selling innovation, not the lowest cost
solutions. If there patents do not advance the state of the art, why did the patent office grant them patents in the first
place?

Author’s reply »  Thanks for the thoughtful questions Banzai.


1) Our charts only consider 2006 - present, but Unilife has been burning cash since 2002. That cash burn
might be promising were Unilife consistently building its revenue base, but it hasn't. A twelve year 'start-up
phase' is generally unprecedented in the Medical Device industry.


2) Unilife is a manufacturing business. Therefore, one might expect to see Unilife spend more on capex (just
$3.3m over LTM) and less on operating expenses (~$56m excl. D&A). Cash flow should be producing hard
assets, not paying excessive management and overhead salaries.


3) If it's customers asked for boutique solutions, Becton or Covidien has the resources to accommodate any
request. Syringes aren't meant to be flashy. The drug is the focus and the syringe itself should be well-built,
safe, and reliable.


4) Patents are awarded for all sorts of reasons, including incremental tweaks that may not impact the
underlying product. In our experience, when a company shifts focus to its patent portfolio, it's an indication

that prospects for the underlying business are weakening. Pharmaceutical customers aren't looking for a
supplier with a certain patent, they are shopping for a well-equipped product from a dependable vendor.

b_banzai: is unis really selling innovation tho? which SPECIFIC product technology do they have that the big
dawgs don't? no position right now in the stock, i just would like to know this


05 Dec 2013, 10:09 AM


B_Banzai
KCM - Thanks for the reply. I think atrickpay has asked the correct question(s). I am a full time mechanical
engineer, with 1 non-medical patent to my name, so I know something about the process. Unfortunately, that's
my day job and I am only a part time trader with limited bandwidth to do intensive research on these products.


I did take some time to review the range of products offered by BDX. While there is some overlap, each
company offers products that the other doesn't even mention. I will take some more time to research the
differences. I also want to look at ATRS and RVP products for comparison. But others may be able to answer
this question of "uniqueness" in a more timely manner than I with concrete data.


The bottom line is that, if UNIS is playing in the commodities market, they will never succeed. I don't believe
that is the case. I picked up a small position yesterday.


06 Dec 2013, 08:40 AM

I took some time to look at the USPTO web site to compare injector designs. Here is what I found using
advanced search: 
1) Search: "an/(becton) AND ttl/(injection OR (injector))" - 50 patents, 1977-2011. BDX appears to be trying to
innovate (not just reduce costs as I had suggested). 
2) an:/(unitract) - UNIS has 8 patents, 2003-2010. 
3) (an/(retractable and (technologies)) - RPV has 17 patents, 1998-2010. 
4) (an/(antares and (pharma)) AND (ttl/(injector) OR ttl/(injection)) - ATRS has 21 patents dating back to 1999.


This was not an exhaustive search by any means, but it was enough to demonstrate that there is clearly more
than one way to "skin a cat". While there is certainly some overlap in what problem particular patents address,
there were many for which there was no overlap with a competitor. Of course, whether an invention can be
manufactured and perform reliably, find a market, hold on to that market, etc. is another question. It certainly
helps if you have big name customers behind you.

The author is being a bit too clever stating Sanofi's relationship with Unilife is solely to "test a few of its designs".

Sanofi funded the construction of Unilife's manufacturing facilities. Sanofi's recent supply contract with Unilife is the
culmination of testing (2 year stability tests). In fact all of the supply or development contracts announced thus far are
the culmination of long protracted testing and due diligence. These contracts clearly indicate Sanofi, Novartis,
Medimmune, Hikma, Biodel, etc want to put their drugs in Unilife's products.


Moving on. I'm not sure what relevance Unilife's long history has with anything. That is in the rear view mirror. A few
years ago Unilife were a one-product outfit with no manufacturing facilities, or partners or contracts.


What has changed? They have a diversified product range and they have Sanofi, Novartis, Medimmune, Hikma,
Biodel, etc in the bag (and I dare say a few more pharma in the next few months).


Folks, if you have doubts about Unilife's products being innovative or game changers, just focus on the quality and
street cred of the customers now increasingly being signed up. Details of revenues to slowly filter through in the next
year or so.

I'm a long only investor but would almost change my mind after reading this article. Problems which are all persistent: 
Share dilution: Even if the company becomes great you will own an even smaller amount


unreliable management: Being too optimistic too much focus on short term stock value, reward for management is too
high


Proven record of failure: missing deadlines


Valuation: the company is richly valuated especially compared to competitors. Furthermore it is hard if not impossible
to see how you can get a decent reward for investment except from a rising stock price.


Great article!

I am very heavy short this stock and after reading this article I am going to exit immediately. I have already starting
taking a position long in other accounts but will cover all my shorts and reverse heavy to a long position.


Why? Because what I read in this article does not add up and I see too many people dumping on Unilife after they hot
4 more contracts deals? That makes no sense. They are proving their business model yet all these comments are
against the business still as if they are in the years past. Those problems are gone.


As I read the comments and research the facts in the article I see that everyone here wants to make a case for Unilife
not achieving anything. Yet all I see is a number of contracts that have just hit the front pages and brought credibility
and very large gains to this company.


It seems to me that next year they are going to be profitable if another contract is announced with upfront payments of
millions of dollars just like most of the other ones were.

And with that said, it still seems most comments including this article talk about the problems from the past as if we
are still in 2009, 2010 or 2011. This is 2013 and almost 2014 and Unilife has turned it around and starting the income
flow by getting the deals signed all with major global pharmaceuticals . These companies certainly would not do 15
year contracts with Unilife before rigorously investigating all claims made including production, patents, FDA reports,
etc. They did and they still signed.


I am exiting my short position. I have made enough money and now is the time for me to buy long this week.

Author’s reply »  We believe conclusions like this, and a belief that 'this time is different', could have been
made in 2004 after Unilife promised to be produce 65m syringes by March 2004, when Sanofi starting paying
R&D fees in 2009, or after the unnamed deals 2011.


The only guarantee from the recent slate of press releases is a combined upfront payment of $10m from
Hikma and Sanofi, a sum that offsets just 3 months of Unilife's cash burn. The press releases include no sign
of committed long-term revenue streams that justify Unilife's recent 70% share price rally or it's nearly half-
billion dollar market capitalization. Once this temporary euphoria subsides, valuation and underlying cash flow
streams will again come into focus.

Yes....you are "heavy short" this stock and are now going to go long. Yet 100% of your comments have
pumped UNIS, like your first one:


"BUY LONG NOW before its too late and EXPLODED UPWARD to its target of $7.50 to $10 near term. "

Jokes of the day.


1. What's the definition of no sign of commitment?


Ans. Upfront payments and 15 year supply agreements.


2. Why don't shorts like waking up in the morning?


Ans. Unilife's next contract might be announced.
