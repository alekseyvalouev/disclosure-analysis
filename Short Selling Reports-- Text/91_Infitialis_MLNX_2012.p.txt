Mellanox Bubble To Burst With Intel Foray Possibly Threatening
Existence

Investors in new industries have a propensity to engage in folly often resulting in the
manifestation of valuation bubbles for the pioneering companies. We intend to expose
such folly in an effort to identify bubbles before they implode. Such was the case with our
first two published research reports exposing micro-cap scams or "mini bubbles" which
subsequently burst. Investors that heeded our warnings avoided subsequent losses of
over 70%.


In financial markets participants are constantly processing incomplete information while
being driven by the basic human emotions of greed and fear. Consequently, participants
feeding a financial bubble tend to have a biased perception of reality making the bubble
difficult to spot until after the implosion.


As the great Charles Mackay wrote in 1841: "Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it
will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and
one by one." Nearly two hundred years later these words are still relevant as even
nowadays men find it difficult to act against the herd while the herd goes mad.


Such is the case with shares of Mellanox Technologies (NASDAQ:MLNX) which we
believe are exhibiting the signs of a classic financial bubble no different than the bubbles
that plagued the shares of Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) this
year and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Green Mountain Coffee (NASDAQ:GMCR) in 2011.
Those companies experienced sharp revaluations from the unsustainable multiples
projected by the cartel of sell-side analysts when reality set in and investors realized that
the businesses faced increased competition and a more modest rate of growth.


MLNX is the most expensive semiconductor company in the world trading at 55x Trailing
FCF (Free Cash Flow) in an industry that trades at an average of 15.25x Trailing FCF.

Industry Avg. Excluding Mellanox: 15.25x Market Value to Trailing Free Cash Flow


When incorporating analyst estimates for 2013 cash flow into our realistic model we
estimate that shares of Mellanox are worth no more than $46.17 or 61% lower providing
significant downside risk from the current price of $118.00. In order to arrive at this figure
we rely on very rosy estimates made by the company and sell-side analysts while having
to wait over a year to see if the company can even deliver on those estimates.


Thus far MLNX has produced only $212 million in FCF since 2007 or an average of $47
million per year meaning that investors buying shares today at a valuation of $4.90 billion
are in effect paying 105x the average annual cash flow the company has proven capable
of earning. To place the richness of this valuation in perspective, imagine owning a
business that required over a century to earn back the price you paid for ownership…
Certainly a foolish proposition!


The Company


Mellanox Technologies Ltd. is an Israeli based semiconductor company that focuses on
data transmission between servers and storage systems. The company's success thus far
can be attributed to a prescient bet on a technology called Infiniband which it does not
own (open standard) and which was overlooked by industry giants such as Intel
(NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Infiniband is a connection technology that is
extremely fast (up to 56 Gbit/s) and provides a very low latency environment for large
servers and storage devices. Infiniband adapters allow companies to increase their
network performance given the incremental connection speed with additional benefits for
servers running in virtualized and cloud based environments.


With Infiniband Mellanox played the classic role of a first mover getting a head start by
recognizing the market opportunity and developing a suite of products and services that
thrived with no competitors in sight. From the time Mellanox became a public company in
2007 (roughly the time the market for Infiniband started gaining momentum) the company

5/20/2018 Mellanox Bubble To Burst With Intel Foray Possibly Threatening Existence - Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLNX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 3/21


has commanded a 70-90% market share of the Infiniband market. It is important to put this
figure in perspective as the company's total revenues in 2011 were just $259.25 million
indicating the total market for these products is still quite modest.


There is no doubt that Infiniband has been gaining prominence as a connection
technology, but unfortunately for investors in Mellanox today this development should not
be viewed favorably. As long as the market for Infiniband was niche and of modest size a
company like Mellanox with no discernible moat could thrive due to its first mover
advantage. In our view as long as the market for Infiniband continues to grow, Mellanox
will for the first time face significant competition. Put differently, it is unrealistic and even
foolish for investors to assume that going forward Mellanox will continue to command a
90% market share. As we will demonstrate in the next few sections, even the most
optimistic sell-side analysts have warned that Mellanox has a 1-2 year lead at best on
potential competitors. Specifically, our analysis confirmed an entrance by Intel which will
be launching a far superior 100 Gigabit a second Infiniband product line (twice the
speed of Mellanox products) as early as Q4 2013, cannibalizing market share from
MLNX as soon as Q4 2012.


Fundamentals


MLNX Valuation Defies Logic and Cannot be Mathematically Rationalized without
Unsustainable Multiples


Investors have bid up shares of Mellanox to a valuation that reflects 55 years' worth of
cash flow generation under the naive assumption that Mellanox can grow into its valuation
by continuing to command a near monopoly in an industry where it has thus far faced zero
competition. Mellanox's valuation is so out of whack that even if the business had
commanded a durable competitive advantage, a multiple of 27.5 years' worth of cash flow
(half the current multiple) would equate to a very rich $59 per share. Even at that price
investors would be valuing MLNX at twice the valuation of bellwethers such as Intel or
Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN).

In a way Mellanox is a victim of its own success, having made a lonely bet on an esoteric
technology that is becoming the industry standard. The company's modest financial
success can be easily attributed to that of a lonely entrant owning an industry that was too
small for any competitors to take notice until now. It is absolutely crucial for investors to be
cognizant of this point as the sell-side analyst community promotes the company with
research that is predicated upon the flawed assumption that MLNX will continue to own
the industry. Moreover the economic models employed by the analyst community are also
flawed and can only be rationalized by projecting out income and cash flows for
nearly half a century at worst and one third of a century at best. But the most critical
flaw in the models comes from the lack of sensitivity for future market share
cannibalization. All across the board, analysts appear to be taking the view that Mellanox
will continue commanding a near 90% market share in 2013 and beyond. We believe this
view is not only naïve but irresponsible given the guaranteed entrance by Intel as well as
other competitors.


We have seen nearly identical trends before with other companies such as Netflix and
Green Mountain Coffee. Both companies experienced rapid growth in an industry that was
initially overlooked by competitors and were heavily touted by the sell-side analyst
community which raised and re-raised estimates maintaining the same growth and market
share variables in their models. Only when reality set in and the companies reported more
realistic results did the analyst community incorporate those variables into their models.
By that time it was too late as Netflix declined by over 80% from peak to trough in 2011
and Green Mountain by over 84%. We are absolutely convinced that Mellanox will follow
the same path as the mathematical reality of its earnings power is processed over the
coming quarters and sell-side analysts are forced to update their models.


Mellanox Meets Competition: Intel


Nearly 8 months ago on January 23rd shares of MLNX dropped nearly 11% in one trading
session. The reason behind the drop was that QLogic (NASDAQ:QLGC) (Mellanox's only
competitor with nearly 15% of the Infiniband market) sold its Infiniband unit to Intel for
$125 million.


With this acquisition Intel, the world's largest and most profitable chip company, decided
that it would aggressively enter the Infiniband market. An article communicating the fear
experienced by Mellanox investors the day of Intel's acquisition can be viewed here.


Brian Freed, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities summed up the market's reaction to the
news as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 5/21


"These two companies dominate the market and Mellanox always had a significant
lead on QLogic. Three years from now, this track record of dominating the market
may change to a company that could potentially be chasing Intel."


Aviad Shrum, an Analyst for Psagot Investment House shared similar concerns:


"Intel is entering a niche market dominated by Mellanox and which is the core
activity of the company. We see this as a significant threat to MLNX's future..."


The concerns shared by the analysts were valid as Mellanox would now have to compete
with a company that was over 100x its size with a more solid customer base and stronger
marketing and distribution channels. In a Bloomberg news article dated February 19, 2012
Radoslaw Walczyk, a spokesperson for Intel, confirmed the company's intentions:


"Our acquisition of QLogic's Infiniband business opens up new opportunities for
competition and innovation in supercomputing"


Adding even more uncertainty to Mellanox's future, Intel announced that its first rollout of
Infiniband products would be at 100 Gigabits per second, nearly double the speed of
Mellanox's products and an entire generation ahead. Intel's decision was very wise as the
industry life cycle for these products is roughly 5 years and the latest boom in
Infiniband adoption took hold in 2008-2009 indicating the next big upgrading cycle
will begin in 2013-2014.


Here lies another overlooked but very important point: Intel made a strategic decision to
basically delay all efforts to gain market share with the existing Qlogic product line, instead
focusing the newly acquired business on the development and rollout of the next
generation products. This resulted in Qlogic/Intel products predictably losing market share
in Q1, Q2 and most probably Q3-Q4 of 2012.


Wall Street Loves Bubbles

This graph shows the share price of MLNX since its IPO on 2/7/2007 at $17 a share. Note how this


already expensive company began to form a bubble right around January 23rd the date of Intel's


announcement. We view the parabolic uptrend as the "last hurrah" before reality sets in as early as


Q3 2012 (10/26) and affirmatively by Q1 of 2013 as businesses begin to scale down their orders in


anticipation of Intel's superior line of next generation products. Investors that pull up graphs of NFLX


and GMCR will notice almost identical patterns with both companies experiencing a rapid


subsequent decline as the bubble around the shares burst.


On January 23rd 2012, the day Intel announced its acquisition of Q-Logic, formally
entering the Infiniband space and becoming Mellanox's first true competitor, MLNX shares
traded at $31.35 for a market value of $1.23B. As we had mentioned in the previous
section that day saw no less than 7 sell-side analysts distribute warnings and cautious
notes with essentially the same theme: "The party is over."


Exactly 2 days later on January 25th, MLNX reported its fourth quarter numbers which
beat estimates by roughly .02 cents a share amounting to net income for the quarter of .11
cents a share. The next day shares of MLNX rose by over $5 (over 10 years' worth of
income per share) to $36.16. This activity can be easily explained as Wall Street
participants simply did what they know best: They forgot all about the game-changing
development and continued to buy shares of MLNX based on its predictable growth in
earnings. As each subsequent quarter came and passed MLNX delivered the predictable
results and the bubble began to form.


In our view the only reason shares of MLNX have traded from $31.15 the day of Intel's
announcement to $118 today is because investors guided by sell-side analysts on Wall
Street completely kicked the upcoming Intel threat down the road, choosing instead to
focus on MLNX's short-term results which ironically are being fueled by Intel's strategy to
enter the space (shelving efforts to market current generation products allowing MLNX to
gain additional market share). But what troubles us most is that investors have now bid up
shares of MLNX to levels that leave no margin of safety. At a $4.9B valuation investors
purchasing shares of MLNX have to be certain that not only will the market for
Infiniband grow at 15% CAGR (as the company predicts) but that MLNX will
continue to maintain a 90% market share in 30-50 years.


Fortunately our thesis does not live in a vacuum. Recently other astute investors and
business writers have written about the conundrum that is MLNX shares. In a piece for the
UK Register, Timothy P. Morgan wrote an article that does a good job at outlining the
guaranteed headwinds facing MLNX:



http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/19/mellanox_q2_2012_numbers/
5/20/2018 Mellanox Bubble To Burst With Intel Foray Possibly Threatening Existence - Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLNX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 7/21


"These will likely be remembered as the salad days at Mellanox some years hence, when
Intel has taken over networking much as it has done with processing. Perhaps during the
100 Gigabit InfiniBand and Ethernet rollouts maybe in 2014 or 2015"


The bottom line is that MLNX thrived in a niche industry with no competitors because the
industry was in its infancy, being too small to attract attention. As the industry matured and
became a real opportunity the world's largest chip maker marked its entrance. Those are
simply the facts of life. MLNX does not have a moat (aside from a 2 year head start on the
56 gb/s products) and has absolutely no chance at competing with the likes of an Intel as
it prepares to launch superior technology at the end of 2013.


Now it is imperative to remind readers that all these details and speculations would be
irrelevant if MLNX shares were not trading at a bubble valuation. Had market participants
not made MLNX the flavor du-jour cheer-led by the sell-side community, MLNX may have
made for an attractive acquisition candidate for another entrant to the field. However at the
current valuation MLNX investors are caught between a rock and a hard place as the
reality of competition sets in, at which point the opportunity for a sale may have already
lapsed.


In this graphic from the Infiniband Trade Association which plots the growth of Infiniband,
as well as the projected evolution of the technology, we superimposed dates of
significance. This graphic does a superb job at visualizing why MLNX shares are primed
for a significant decline. As investors can clearly see: Intel simply decided to skip one

generation forward before launching its products. That time is near, at which point MLNX
will lose any competitive advantage and be valued at multiples closer to its peer group.
That is under the assumption that MLNX will still be able to compete with the likes of Intel.


Insider Sales Confirm Bubble


As investors drove MLNX shares up by nearly 300% in 8 months, insiders have opined by
unloading an unprecedented amount of stock. Unfortunately for long investors there are
an additional 3.8 million options outstanding at an average exercise price of $17.09,
guaranteeing even more dilution and potentially adding an additional 4-500 million dollars
to the already bloated market value of $4.9B.


Since the beginning of the year MLNX insiders have unloaded over $31 million worth of
shares. From this figure over $17 million worth of shares were sold in the last 30 days
hinting that even insiders believe that MLNX shares are overvalued.


This table presents the disclosed insider sales for 2012. It's interesting to note that with
the exception of CEO Eyal Waldman (who is the largest individual shareholder of the
company, owning nearly $200 million worth of stock) every single insider has been
unloading with increased tenor over the last 30 days.


We were surprised to see Michael Kagan CTO and Chief of Architecture liquidate nearly
$2.5 million worth of Mellanox shares in the last 30 days. Surely as the CTO of the
company he would be in a favorable position to gauge whether shares of Mellanox are
cheap or expensive. Even more insightful would be Marc Sultzbaugh, VP of Worldwide
Sales, who has sold over $2.5 million worth of shares in 2012, with over 73% of that
amount being sold in the last 30 days!


The insider sales merely confirm what is obvious to any objective investor making
reasonable estimates of future cash flow for MLNX: The valuation is a bubble! It is highly
unusual to see insider sales amounting to 70-100% of total yearly sales being executed in

a few short days. Clearly, they have decided to unload their shares into the frothy
valuation.


On a related topic it is interesting to note that CEO Eyal Waldman's Facebook Page is
open, allowing anyone to view the fast paced life of the tech millionaire. We highly
recommend that readers of this report take a peek, as you will surely enjoy the plethora of
fast cars, yachts, and bikini-clad women. At the very least investors can appreciate that
the proceeds from the share sales are being spent wisely!


Mellanox is Overvalued Even According To Mellanox


Slide From Mellanox Presentation in August of 2012 Showing Total Available Market @ $5.3B

Slide from Mellanox investor presentation on June 3rd, 2011 showing Total Available Market @


$4.7B


Since at least June 2011 when its market cap was only $980 million Mellanox has been
touting its Total Available Market (TAM) as an opportunity worth $4.7B. Since then
investors have bid up shares of Mellanox to a bubbly valuation of $4.9B. In the updated
investor presentation from August Mellanox now pegs the market opportunity at as high as
$5.3B. But even this figure highlights a major red flag for investors betting on the future of
the company. According to the company's own assessment of the potential size of the
market, Mellanox is extremely overvalued as its fully diluted market cap is now
larger than the market opportunity itself.


We could understand why a very optimistic investor would make a bull case for a company
tapping a $4.7B opportunity while its market cap was less than $1B but we are puzzled as
to why any logical investor would pay more for a company today than their current market
opportunity. We also believe that MLNX is not accurately presenting the TAM as it does
not subtract its cumulative revenues from the TAM as we have done in our models.


Our Fair Value Model for Mellanox



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2012/8/31/4165661-13464474801274269-Infitialis_origin.jpg
5/20/2018 Mellanox Bubble To Burst With Intel Foray Possibly Threatening Existence - Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ:MLNX) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 11/21


As part of our research we decided to build a fair value model for shares of MLNX. In an
effort to be as objective as possible we used Bloomberg Analyst Estimates for future
revenue and FCF figures incorporating some very rosy estimates. Additionally we used
the company's own data for growth rates for the market opportunity as we wanted to
monitor the true size of the TAM.


Our model simply takes the FCF estimates for 2012 and 2013 projected by Wall Street but
applies a more realistic 15.25x FCF multiple which is the peer average. Additionally we
apply sensitivities to the projected FCF number based on potential market share
penetration. Contrary to the sell-side firms that love drinking the Kool-Aid we don't just
assume that MLNX will command a 90%+ market share for the remainder of the year or
2013. Finally we tallied the cumulative revenues for MLNX since inception, as well as the
cumulative cash flows, in an effort to decipher the actual TAM. By subtracting the
cumulative revenue from the TAM the model projects the remaining TAM. Our model then
takes this figure and uses Mellanox's own growth rate projections for the TAM to estimate
the TAM in 2013 and then once again subtract the cumulative revenues in 2013
(incorporating analyst estimates for revenues in 2013) providing a remaining TAM at year
end 2013.


The first data point that is uncovered by our model is something MLNX fails to mention in
its own presentations: At the end of 2012 MLNX will have tapped nearly 25% of the TAM
given their cumulative revenues hit $959mm as of June 30th, 2012. By the end of 2013
MLNX will have tapped over 30% of the TAM, begging the question why any responsible
analyst would project out 40-60 years' worth of cash flows.


Additional data points from our model serve as the nail in the coffin of our thesis:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 12/21


MLNX fair value will be $36.59-$47.04 a share by the end of 2012 (assuming it meets
analyst estimates) based on a peer group avg. multiple of 15.25 years' worth of cash
flow (INTC only trades @ 13.4).
MLNX fair value will be $44.22-$56.85 a share by the end of 2013 (assuming they
meet their numbers over a year and a half from now). Keep in mind that any option
exercises will reduce this figure as we did not make an attempt to project a fully diluted
share count.
At the end of 2013 the remaining market opportunity is projected to be no more than
$4.77 billion, which is about $200 million less than MLNX's current market cap!
Applying the historical FCF to Revenue Margin of 22.7% we arrive at a potential
cumulative FCF for MLNX of just $1.08 billion from the TAM which will have to be
earned over nearly 8 years and assumes that MLNX will retain a 90%+ market share.
Put differently, investors purchasing shares of MLNX today will have to wait nearly a
decade for the company to earn only 20% of its value under the most rosy scenario.
Using the blended average for the 2012 and 2013 numbers we arrive at a fair value
estimate of $46.17 for MLNX over the 6-12 months, projecting a nearly 61% decline in
the share price.


It Ain't What You Don't Know That Gets You In Trouble. It's What You Know For Sure
That Just Ain't So. - Mark Twain


In conclusion, we urge long investors to stay away from MLNX shares as there are
significant downside risks that the bubble around the stock begins to burst. Speculative
investors should consider a short position capitalizing on the asymmetric risk/reward
proposition at these unsustainable levels.


Summarizing our view on the name we highlight the following red flags and catalysts for a
sharp revaluation to the downside


1. MLNX growth rates and profit margins are unsustainable and have only been
possible due to a temporary monopoly whereby the company commands 90%
market share. Given that the current share price reflects the rosiest growth and
profit projections as much as half a century into the future we believe that MLNX
shares will experience a sharp revaluation to the downside when the company's
numbers begin to confirm our thesis. As with NFLX and GMCR by the time they
do it will have been too late for investors.


2. Intel is entering the market in less than 12 months with a far superior product a
full generation ahead of MLNX's, ending the days of operating in an industry

https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 13/21


with no competitors and guaranteeing market cannibalization in the bull case
and possibly a full threat to MLNX's existence in the bear case.


3. Sales of Infiniband products account for 90% of the company's revenues while
49% of revenues are derived from just two customers. As the lifecycle of
Infiniband products is 5 years, businesses will begin to weigh their future
investments in upgrading to Infiniband over the next 12 months (the end of the
boom in first generation Infiniband products) most likely choosing to wait for the
superior next generation of products from Intel.


4. Unusual and aggressive insider selling over the last 30 days by key employees
confirms our thesis as the people who have the best insight into the future of
the company vote with their pocket books. Additional dilution is guaranteed with
almost 4 million options at an average strike price of $17 to be exercised and
sold into the market.


5. MLNX shares have become an unsustainable bubble trading at a valuation of
$4.9B now exceeding the entire market opportunity as stated by the company.


We leave you with a chart of GMCR and NFLX superimposed. This chart perfectly visualizes the


bubbles forming and then bursting as reality set in and shares of both companies declined by over


80% in less than 5 months. We believe that shares of MLNX are destined to follow the exact same


path with the bursting of the bubble occurring imminently.

Nicely written. I have one question. Is there a near-term catalyst that would help the short thesis play out? It sounds
like major competition is going to be absent until late 2013.


If I were to bet on the short side, I would do it through a way out of the money put spread. Maybe the $70-$60 spread.
I would like to pick the expiry close to the catalyst date (end of 2013). However, as of right now you can only go out as
far as March 2013.


04 Sep 2012, 11:05 AM


Akram's Razor, Contributor
Your catalyst is guidance that only goes 1quarter out and a customer base that as of the most recent quarter
consisted of ibm and hpq accounting for 50% of revenue. This company will see guidance volatility, and if you are
looking to short it you want to be in front of that because when the inevitable soft quarter comes mgmt will be talking
about pushbacks and a couple of large web 2.0 related projects that didnt close on time but will close soon. Market
always misprices stocks like this as they extrapolate a splurge in orders many hears hence when in fact the very
nature of the business they are winning ensures no such thing can happen as you don't build massive datacenters
and supercomputers every 18 months.

Author’s reply »  Superb response. Investors must make an internal assessment of intrinsic value and buy (or
in this case sell) when Mr. Market serves you a valuation that exceeds that assessment with a sufficient
margin of safety.

I remember a group at Intel working on Infiniband ~10 years ago. I don't know why they dropped it at the time. They
defined it.


04 Sep 2012, 01:03 PM


Puck
And not just Intel. Cisco also formerly produced Infiniband hardware and discontinued it. The idea that this
article seems founded on, that "big names" have not been involved in Infiniband in the past, is simply false.


Even Wikipedia notes that the history of Infiniband has almost all of the big players involved. 
http://bit.ly/RJzKCj


It may be true that Mellanox has a short "first mover" horizon, but the reasons that this author gives just seem
to be off target.

Would you give more color on this claim from the analysis:


Specifically, our analysis confirmed an entrance by Intel which will be launching a far superior 100 Gigabit a second
Infiniband product line (twice the speed of Mellanox products) as early as Q4 2013, cannibalizing market share from
MLNX as soon as Q4 2012.


Most of the analyst community and also MLNX itself on the last quarterly call seem to think that any competition is at
least 2-3 years away. 
Any more details would be appreciated.

For comparison, this is extract from Deutsche Bank initiation note on MLNX this morning:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/843191-mellanox-bubble-to-burst-with-intel-foray-possibly-threatening-existence 16/21


With such a large and underpenetrated addressable market, Mellanox could be  
expected to have a fierce competitive landscape. While it has faced competition  
historically, it currently is the only vendorwith FDR 56Gb/s products in the market. Its  
main direct competitor in the InfiniBand space is QLogic.  
During Q1 2012 Intel acquired QLogic’s InfiniBand assets for $125m, but its product  
line is currently limited to QDR 40Gb/s solutions. In other words, it is a generation  
behind Mellanox, and while Intel’s greater resources may enable it to leap to a 100Gb/s  
solution, that will likely require two to three years of development. During this window  
Mellanox is exploiting the competitive hiatusto build a dominant market position and  
strengthen development and marketing alliances with its various OEM and software  
partners.


This is from Needham note July 30:  
MLNX emphasizes its technology leadership (i.e. 10/40GE, 40/56 IB  
end-to-end; RDMA over ethernet; own SERDES; VPI; bandwidth/latency  
leadership; support for apps/Oss). MLNX has essentially a monopoly in  
IB at least until 100G emerges in ’14. Even then, MLNX has multi-generation installed base leadership and
Intel/Qlogic has to integrate  
into software stacks of customers (i.e., storage vendors, ORCL). MLNX  
highlights that web 2.0, cloud and ‘big data” have same  
requirement/architectural challenge as HPC where MLNX leads.  
Interconnect performance increasingly critical to balance faster CPU,  
memory. VPI software allows customers to avoid “lock-in”.


And I could go on. The sell-side consensus seems to be at least 2-3 years of monopoly for MLNX. So please give
some more color on this alleged 4Q2013 timing - any sources, links etc?

Fascinating juxtaposition between this article and an analyst's rec that moved the stock up 4+% today, plus another
SA article that was a pure extrapolation of history. I think the market action on the analyst's rec is a tell that this party
is almost over. Following up on Akram's idea, I'm looking at put spreads that cover the next quarter's earnings,
knowing I may be a quarter or two early.


04 Sep 2012, 05:59 PM


Akram's Razor, Contributor
Ideal way to play this is just wait for earnings and by puts a couple of days before. If they drop a guidance bomb you
will make multiples on your money and if they don't you may still get a sell the news effect. Otherwise you get wiped
out and try again next quarter only with a slightly bigger position. The way to play these stocks is assume you have $1
and you are going spread it out over three trades. First time risk 20c, second time 30c, third time 50c. A stock like this

will decline 25% easy on a guidance bomb so odds are even with the current premiums that you triple or quadruple if
you get that right. So spread it out and take a few cracks at it as timing is impossible and longdated puts too pricey.


This is the definition of the dream hedge fund stock. Tech hardware, big theme play, niche all to itself, and plausible
suitors as investors. Reality is this name is no different than a sycamore networks in 1999-2000 or an acme packet
18months ago. They are a play on performance in tech related infrastructure. Sycamore's switches for fiber network
buildouts, acme packets session border controllers for 4g/lte and voip related carrier buildouts, and now infiniband for
datacenters and high performance computers.


The type of customer that is willing to spend whatever for the best performance does not exactly grow on trees. You
are talking the likes of financials, high end government, a handful of tech titans, and healthcare. Start moving outside
of these areas and the bulk of corporates can live without having the highest thoroughput on the market for now. So i
do not doubt that they are bound to have some serious quarterly volatility. What bothers me here is that management
gets to go out and talk about how big their adressable market is and yet offer only 1quarter of visibility. Meanwhile
they are selling stock like mad on the back of a quarter with a 'large web 2.0 related order'. Of course the sell side is
no help as not a single one of them will actually question whether or not the current quarterly revenue run rate is a
new sustainable base they will grow off of or whether we should be expecting some volatility. Make mgmt guide for
the year even if its way off. I mean its not like they need to keep secrets from competitors right now. As for intels
arrival obviously its a longterm concern, but its way too far off to be a worry and could legitmately fail with the lead
market share mlnx will have by then(doubtful because its intel but still a very real possibility). The short thesis here is
how quickly does the datacenter/cloud infrastructure roll out cycle go from boom to bust. Because once this capex
binge cools off a company like mlnx will see orders fall off a cliff. Now show me a sell side report that is modeling
potential losses in 2015 or 2016 or even 2014. This is an age old problem in tech hardware sell side coverage....they
never ever model the sharp downside cyclicality associated with the end of an upgrade/buildout cycle. I've seen this in
every kind of semi related play you can think of and it never changes. But it is even worse when you have a fabless
play that has carved out a nice little niche and is a generation ahead of the competition. Genesis micropchip had the
fpd microcontroller market all to itself, zoran in dvd's, portalplayer in media processor chips(crus investors should
research this story), stec in ssd enterprise, and half a dozen others i wont bother naming. Most of these names
managed to go ballistic in very crappy broader tech markets (if i recall gnss went from 10 to 80 while the nasdaq was
freefalling only to reach low single digits again a year later), but all eventually crashed hard because competition
showed up or their niche market never went as mainstream as they expected. Mlnx looks to me like the best case
version of this type of problem as I still think the big data cycle has at least 1more great year in it and competition is
nil, but on the downside their niche market is pretty small and their stock is now trading at ludicrous levels. And when i
say ludicrous i mean absolutely ludicrous. These guys need to quintuple revenues from here and not give back any
margin for this stock to make more sense. Think about this mlnx market cap is bigger than emulex, qlogic, and
brocade combined which at one point where the market darlings in fibre channel san switches.

Dialectical Materialist
"...we are puzzled as to why any logical investor would pay more for a company today than their current market
opportunity."


Isn't this really the annual market and a growing one at that?


I don't want to defend MLNX valuation, but this strikes me as being a bit cloudy. Comparing market cap to total annual
sales is not really the linear comparison you imply. One is the money in a kid's piggy bank and the other is his highest
possible allowance. The two are related in some fashion but the money in the piggy bank could easily exceed the
maximum theoretical allowance. And if the maximum possible revenue is growing (as the total addressable market is
presumed to be) then there is even less reason that market cap would be constrained by this number.


That is not an argument for why MLNX may be fairly valued, just a critique of comparing these two measurements in
such a fashion.


04 Sep 2012, 09:07 PM


Christopher Wallace, Contributor
I think the author has put forward a compelling case to sell or short MLNX. However I agree with Dialectic's
point above that you cannot hold the TAM constant if it is a growing market. But the rest of the article is on
point and well presented.


In terms of upcoming catalysts, earnings and/or guidance showing diminishing growth would certainly begin
to unravel the stock price. But a potentially greater catalyst would be for Intel to woo over one of their two big
customers that together account for 50% of revenue. Such an event would be devastating to the stock price.
And it should not be considered an outlier event, but a probable one. Unless MLNX has a moat that somehow
locks in those customers, one should expect Intel to make a serious run at gathering that business. For MLNX
to lose that business or drop price significantly to save that business would create plenty of market drama.
Impossible to predict when that will happen; easy to predict that it will happen.


24 Sep 2012, 07:46 PM


pone
I think you are missing the dynamic here. As one of only two participants in an important new technology segment,
MLNX is a buyout candidate. I would not be surprised to see a mega giant like IBM or HP buy this at $125 to $175,
and I think the quick rise in price is discounting that coming buyout NOT discounting future earnings!!!


The risk of a buyout here is extreme. Infiniband technology is probably unique enough that to make entry from scratch
means losing two or three years entry to the market. A company like IBM would buy 90% market share, expecting to
hang onto 60% share for the next 20 years. They only need single digit returns on capital if they think the technology
is strategic for them, and this probably is.


Please contrast this to a company like FIRE, which is one of dozens of companies that sell software firewalls and
security appliances. There is nothing very unique about their technology, so while risk of a buyout is always there, it
seems safer to short the overvaluation.

Intel bought Qlogic mostly for their HPC efforts. That's where the bandwidth is mostly needed. Any buyout
candidate would probably have the same needs.

Actually makes little sense as a buyout candidate for ibm as they are selling solutions and not components. Not the
type of company they would buy, and when you consider the customer base of mlnx i cant see why hpq or oracle
would either as mlnx's model relies on doing business with your server and datacenter competitors. Emc, ibm,hpq,
and orcl will stay away. Makes more sense for a networking company or a large diversified semiconductor name like
broadcomm

Value Bulldog, Contributor
Good analysis. Like APKT and NFLX in their heydays, there is no doubt that at some point MLNX will trade at a lower
price in the future, the question is what path it will take. One thing you also might want to pay attention to is also the
development of 40G Ethernet. Datacenters would rather use cheap and ubiquitous Ethernet instead of supporting an
entirely separate expensive proprietary InfiniBand network, however, current 10G Ethernet does not meet the speed
and latency requirements for certain applications. 40G low latency Ethernet, once available, may obviate the need for
even 56G and 100G InfiniBand in a lot of applications that are using InfiniBand today. There is a reason that Mellanox

has been the only company to aggressively invest in InfiniBand to date, while the datacenter connectivity leaders like
Broadcom, Intel, Emulex and Qlogic invest in Ethernet.


Think about it, if the InfiniBand market was really as attractive at MLNX's valuation implies, QLogic would be
incredibly stupid to sell their IB business to Intel for $125M, and Emulex and Broadcom would be incredibly stupid to
not be developing IB products. MLNX has great engineering but their products could be matched by competitors
eventually if they put a mind to it.
