CITRON STANDS
CORRECTED … QIHU IS NOT
MOBI … IS IT MORE LIKE
CHINA MEDIAEXPRESS
(CCME) ?


For those of you who read part 1 of Citron’s
analysis on Qihoo, (NASDAQ:QIHU), we compared
the company to MOBI as operating a web 1.0
business that is presently misunderstood by the
marketplace.  From the company's rebuttal, we
conclude Qihoo is not so much like MOBI…. it
might be a lot more like China MediaExpress
(CCME). 


Our intended part 2 on QIHU was planned to focus
on the naïve analyst commentary and the dubious
history of management.  But all that has become a
sideshow to what our research found, so hold on to
your seat and call your class action attorney.


While Qihoo does in fact have penetration in the
free anti-virus software business — that we do not
question — the rest of the business seems to be
nothing more than an illusion that defies validation
by any third party source.  Either Qihoo has some
magic pill that neither Citron nor the major players
in the China internet space knows about, or this is
a FRAUD.


There are a number of chilling parallels to CCME in
QIHU's current business model.   Citron suggests

that investors and analysts — especially those who
are quick to proclaim "Citron doesn't get it" — read
this report with an open mind.


   Foundation


The main criticism of the initial Citron report was
that we did not understand  Qihoo's business
model and therefore we could not draw a
comparative valuation to any other business.  The
analysts describe Qihoo as a "master aggregator". 
We get that.  They say they generate a lot of web
traffic. 


 


Giving away free software is not a business…lets
call that a hobby.  A business generates revenue. 
If you don’t believe us, just read QIHU's
prospectus:


"In 2008 and 2009, we generated a substantial
portion of our revenues from sales of third-party
anti-virus software. In the second half of 2009, we
started offering 360 Anti-Virus to users free of
charge as we adopted the business model of offering
free Internet and mobile security products to build
up a large and loyal user base and generating
revenues through providing Internet services,
including online advertising and Internet value-
added services."


So advertising is how they generate their
revenues, and that is consistent with their revenue
mix disclosure last quarter.

You can see they're all very similar, (English
speakers can get a pretty good sense of these
using Google translate)    In fact there's a fierce
battle for domain-brand identity.  In Qihoo's case,
their portal is hao.360.cn.  It is not hao360.com
or hao360.cn, which appear to belong to others. 


These sites typically focus on link traffic, not brand
(display) advertising.  Companies that pay for links
on these are paying out of their advertising
budgets … their online advertising budgets.  Qihoo
classifies this as "advertising revenue".   Citron
gets that … do you?


   Comparing to Baidu


Some analysts and commentators have been
comparing Qihoo to Baidu.  This is fatally flawed
logic.  Baidu also operates a directory / portal
(hao123.com), but it is such a small part of the
business that they don't break out its revenues or
costs separately.  Baidu's primary business is
search, which is proven to be a highly profitable
business model — at least for the winner in a
winner-take-all category. 


   Breaking Down The Top Line


Qihoo's pre-eminent revenue generator is their
flagship portal and within that domain, their PSP's
(users can personalize their own start page).  
Linked to that are their vertical niche portal pages.

There are appx 200 links on this page.   But how
much revenue is generated from this site, and who
is paying what?  We are supposed to believe that
this site is generating over $40 million revenues
this quarter, and further, is growing at a rate that
outstrips all the major players in the China internet
space, raising serious questions about its
credibility. 


Below is a screenshot of the same site 21 months
ago when it was generating less than $10 million
per qtr in revenues:

A few less links, but essentially identical in
structure and function.  So exactly how did
revenues increase 400% from last year and
1200% from two years ago?  The quantity of links
certainly hasn’t increased 400%.  We have no
verification that the traffic has increased anything
near 400%.  Have the ad rates gone up 400%? 


   Or is this just a fraud??


For that matter, are there even verifiable ad rates
for this page?   Below is a list of advertisers on the
front page of HAO.360 that we believe do not pay
QIHOO one dime.


Yahoo Mail


NBA


Hotmail (Microsoft)


Amazon


Vogue (Conde Nast magazine)

Further, of these well-known Chinese brands, some

requiring disclosure as to how much they are
paying for links?

   E-commerce aggregator


Qihoo recently launched an "e-commerce

OK, so let's look under the hood at this page :

It is filled with logos of global companies you will

Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony, Sharp, Giordano,
Reebok, Converse, Puma, Nike, Lee and many
others.   Ask on the conference call how much
revenue this page generates for the company.   We
did.


Despite the lack of revenue, here's a selection of
logos displayed on Qihoo's "mall" page: 


The creepy thing is this is exactly what CCME's
strategy was.  In order to convince investors that it
was a huge advertising channel, it produced a
small number of copies of a very glossy catalog
filled with logos from top-name brands like Coach,
Lexus, and Coca-Cola. 


 


Here are some screen shots from Citron's 3
favorite pages out of CCME's "Investor

Qihoo’s other sites are the following 4 vertical
portals, for group buying, video, games, mini
games, and literature.  They are merely
aggregators and the company has told us that
none of them except games represents more than
3% of revenues:


Wan.360.cn –  Games


Tuan.360.cn –  Group Buying


Xiaoyouxi.360.cn – Minigames


Xiaoshou.360.cn – Literature


   Competition


An early sign to Citron that China Media Express
was a fraud was simply the incredible pace that
they were growing revenues and profits compared
to their well-known competition.


During the trailing twelve months, both SINA and
SOHU have grown their top line revenue around
23%.  Both companies have diversified revenue
streams and a PROVEN internet footprint.  During

the same trailing twelve months we are
supposed to believe that Qihoo has grown
their revenue 400%?


Yet, just like China Media Express… none of their
pre-eminent competitors even consider them
competition.  Qihoo fancies themselves as
competition for BIDU.  Yet in its own filings, BIDU
describes their competition as:


" Google and Microsoft, and China-based Internet
companies, such as Netease, Sohu, Tencent and
Alibaba"


SOHU, who recently launched a popular browser
and who also sells games and lists their
competition this way.


“not limited to Sina Corporation (or Sina), Tencent

SINA, who describes themselves AS AN INTERNET

voluminously defines their competition as:

development. Any of our present or future competitors
may offer MVAS that provide significant technology,

those offered by us, and therefore achieve greater
market acceptance than us.

We also face intense competition from domestic and

such as YouTube, MySpace, Twitter and Facebook."


What sticks out like a sore thumb is that Qihoo
says they are the #3 internet company in China by
active user base, the #1 provider of internet and
mobile security solutions by active user base, and
sport a user penetration rate of 92% … yet the
aforementioned companies list everyone as their
competition except … Qihoo, of course.


So we are supposed to believe that the 3rd largest
internet company in China with revenues growing
at 400% a year has just been forgotten about by
their competition?   Sounds very CCME- like to us.


    Mainstream Media Attention:


Exposing CCME was difficult because nowhere
online was there ever a compilation or ranking of
their competitive sector (video advertisers on
intercity buses in China).   


In the case of Qihoo, there are plenty. 


Citron scoured the internet to try to find just one
list that would have hao.360.cn or any Qihoo site
in their top rankings of internet traffic. …. to no
avail.  Here look for yourself.

challenge anyone to find one independent piece of
research that would rank HAO.360 as a significant
player.  Citron cannot, and neither can their
“competition”.  Besides the commissioned

there any other lists that rank Qihoo's sites in the
top 5 in China in terms of traffic?


What makes all of this even more ludicrous is just
like CCME, Qihoo doesn’t even have an online
media kit.  Sina and Sohu both have online media
kits to be explored by potential advertisers, but
Qihoo’s link tells potentials to just “send them an
email”  … Very CCME like.

email")


   Meanwhile, Who is Counting The Beans??


Citron has made a strong case why the advertising
revenue volume at Qihoo just does not add up –
either to their competitors or us.  Yet, it is in an
SEC filing so it has to be true … no?  In our last
but most telling comparison to CCME we have the
auditor.  


Qihoo is audited by none other than Deloitte
Touche in China.  Deloitte was also the auditor of
CCME and most notably, Citron exposed fraud
Longtop Financial.  Anyone who follows the saga of
Chinese stocks knows that Deloitte China recently
refused to cooperate in an investigation by the SEC
of Longtop and is being taken to federal court by
the SEC.

   What will happen when QIHU reports
earnings??


Tomorrow, QIHU reports earnings.  We are
confident that, despite the warnings and cautious
guidance from the pre-eminent Chinese internet
companies, whose revenues are largely dependent
on advertising, they will put up a topline number
that will beat analyst estimates.  This is
reminiscent of CCME’s last Q in 2010 when they
put up record numbers and raised guidance.

questions that SINA's Weibo is among the
“Hottest” internet properties in China.  But last
week SINA CEO Charles Chao, was cautious on
online ad spending as he said on a conference call,
"Overall, the sentiment is good but not great based
on our assessment … There may be some increase
(in advertising spending), but not significant.”

So we are supposed to believe that SINA is not
seeing significant increases in online ad spend yet
Qihoo is able to grow their top line 30% per
quarter….but no one in China seems to know about
it….which leads us to our next point.


   Questions for the Conference Call


As investors, we are fortunate that QIHU will host
a conference call tomorrow.  Here are some
questions that must be addressed as the company
needs to give more transparency to their “business
model”:

Please explain what verifiable metrics besides
revenue have increased 400% in the last year
(as revenue has to be tied to another verifiable
metric


Besides the commissioned iResearch
report, what independent third party
verification of Qihoo's reach and exposure can
the investing public actually rely on?


Who are your five largest advertisers?  Where
do they appear on your site, and what
percentage of their revenue do they generate
in aggregate and individually?


How many of the links on the HAO.360 site are
free links?  What percentage of the total
number of links on the site are free vs paid ?


What metrics does an advertiser use to
evaluate how much to pay for a link?  Why
would an advertiser pay for a static link if the
party they compete with, or the party whose
product they sell, receives a link for free ?


Please walk investors through your site and
identify the specific links and the revenue
generated by the ones that substantiate $40
million in quarterly revenue.


What is the catalyst for the next 300%
increase in your revenues from here?   What
barrier to entry prevents others from copying
your model and topping your growth? 


In order to justify its current market cap, Qihoo
must both make transparent its revenue growth to
date, but also justify 300% — 400% revenue
growth over the next year.

cash flow out of something it gave away for free. 
Qihoo's current efforts resemble more a hall of
mirrors than a roadmap to the future.   Investors
should be extremely wary of investing in a multi-
billion dollar valuation to a story as thin as this
one.  


Cautious investing to all.
