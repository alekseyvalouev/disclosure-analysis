CARBO Ceramics' Response To The SEC Reveals Alarming
Accounting Concerns
Oct. 24, 2016 7:30 AM ET23 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


CARBO Ceramics' interpretation of ASC 360-10 has been highly questioned by the
SEC and may be at odds with white papers written by Ernst & Young, the company's
own auditor.


The SEC has recently required CARBO Ceramics to disclose and revise its critical
account policies for PP&E, particularly for idled and mothballed plants, to more
strictly apply to ASC 360-10-35-21.


Since receiving SEC letters, we believe the company has been gaming both the
SEC and its auditor E&Y by arbitrarily re-bucketizing assets to avoid taking a
necessary large-scale impairment charge.


The company used its aggressive accounting interpretation in order to avoid
breaching a key asset coverage covenant on its credit facility, but breached the
covenant anyway in January 2016.


CARBO Ceramics' avoidance of write-downs gives a potentially misleading picture of
its earnings power at a time when the company is raising money from equity
investors via the Cowen ATM facility.


On 6/12/15, CARBO Ceramics (NYSE:CRR) received questions from Mr. John Cash,
Accounting Branch Chief at the SEC, inquiring about certain aspects of the company's
accounting policies. Most notably to us was Mr. Cash's drill-down into CRR's asset
impairment policies for long-lived assets.

On 6/26/15, CRR responded that while it mothballed a ceramics facility in 1Q15, the
company conducted an impairment test that concluded that no impairment was necessary.
Furthermore, CRR had not updated its accounting policies since filing its 2014 10-K.


(Source: Company's SEC filing)


On 7/9/15, Mr. Cash responded to CRR's 6/26/15 letter. He required more disclosure on
the mothballing of CRR's McIntyre, GA, ceramics plant and required that CRR provide
disclosure differentiating between "idled" and "mothballed" facilities.


(Source: Company's SEC filing)


On 7/23/15, CRR responded to the SEC letter. Mr. Bautista provided new disclosure
indicating that CRR referred to "idled" facilities, as those facilities expected to remain off-
line for "well less than one year," whereas "mothballed" facilities are expected to remain
offline for "longer than one year." Furthermore, only "mothballed" facilities were subject to
impairment tests.


(Source: Company's SEC filing)


In the 7/30/15 third letter from the SEC, Mr. Cash's tone appears frustrated with CRR's
half answers to his questions. He writes that the company's impairment policies are still
not clear to the SEC, and thus, CRR must specifically disclose how it determines that

idling assets does not trigger impairment and also disclose the specific impairment
analyses it conducted for the mothballing of the McIntyre, GA, plant:


(Source: Company's SEC filing)


Finally, on 7/30/15, CRR responded that its "interim impairment analysis" of McIntyre did
not require impairment. The company further provided key assumptions for the impairment
test, which included that the asset be closed for two years and prices remain at 2015
levels, yet somehow the projected gross cash flows attributable to McIntyre "substantially
exceeded the carrying value of the assets."


(Source: Company's SEC filing)


In a 8/4/15 letter, the SEC requested that CRR disclose more details on its asset coverage
debt ratios. On 8/18/15, CRR responded that the company would begin disclosing asset
coverage ratios related to material debt covenants.


Finally, with the release of the 2015 10-K, CRR investors learned what all the fuss
was about: the company disclosed that it was in breach of its asset coverage ratio
as of January 2016 and was forced to cure the breach by repaying a portion of its
credit facility.

If CRR had actually taken a write-down on the McIntyre facility that was "mothballed" in
1Q15, it is likely that the company would have breached its debt covenant sooner and
been forced to renegotiate with its creditors on an accelerated basis. However, as we
discussed earlier, the company conducted an "interim impairment analysis" in which it
concluded that no impairment of McIntyre was necessary, based on the company's own
assumptions that projected gross cash flows from the facility exceeding its carrying value.
Furthermore, CRR seems to have decided that "idled" assets do not need to be tested for
impairment. In our view, delaying taking impairments may have had a material positive
benefit for CRR (in this case, at the expense of its creditors, who may have demanded
stricter credit terms from CRR earlier in 2015).


Despite the recent SEC questioning, CRR decided to get even more aggressive with its
impairment accounting going forward.


Courtesy of the SEC's demands detailed earlier, the company included in its 2015 10-K
new disclosure that "idled" facilities "are expected to remain closed for a short period of
time, generally less than one year," while "mothballed" facilities are expected to remain
closed for one year or longer," with the only distinction in accounting treatment being that
"mothballed" facilities are "evaluated for possible impairment while temporarily idled
assets are not necessarily assessed for impairment."


Also in the 2015 10-K, CRR disclosed a series of idling and restarting activities at its
Toomsboro and Millen plants. However, most significantly, it said that while the company
"mothballed" McIntyre in 1Q15, the facility was restarted at "low output levels" in 4Q15
with the plan at the time to "mothball" the facility again in the first half of 2016.


(Source: CRR 2015 10-K)


This activity begs the question: Why would CRR restart McIntyre at "low output levels"
in 4Q15 after the facility had been shuttered for the previous three quarters with the
plan to "mothball" the facility again for the first half of 2016?

(Source: CRR 10-Q and 10-K filings)


We cannot think of a valid business reason to restart a "mothballed" ceramic proppant
facility like McIntyre if (1) the ceramic proppant market was already severely oversupplied,
leading to negative gross profit at CRR in the current period, and (2) there is no near-term
increase in ceramic proppant market activity.


If there was an increase in activity, the company should have been restarting an "idled"
rather than a "mothballed" facility, per its own disclosure.


However, CRR "again idled" the Millen facility during 4Q15, while at the same time
restarting the "mothballed" McIntyre! Furthermore, it saw a decrease in activity for its
outlook. Here is CRR's outlook from the 3Q15 earnings call:


Now, I'd like to turn to our outlook. The oil and gas industry remains severely
depressed. Recent evidence points to E&P operators substantially reducing
completion activity in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a result, our proppant sales
volume in the fourth quarter of 2015 will likely decline significantly when compared to
the third quarter of 2015. In addition, we will see some pricing pressure in the fourth
quarter of 2015.


And here is its outlook from the 4Q15 earnings call:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/10/21/29825885-14770940548473907_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4014102-carbo-ceramics-response-sec-reveals-alarming-accounting-concerns 6/14


Now, I'd like to turn to our outlook. The continued decline in commodity prices
creates an increasingly challenging operating environment as completion activity by
E&P operators remains very depressed. Various industry sources have estimated
that the North American rig count will likely decline by double digits in the first
quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. With the lower rig count, we
expect continued pressure on our proppant sales in the first half of 2016.


In the Q&A, citing continued pressure from Chinese competition, Mr. Kolstad provided the
following additional market color (bold added for emphasis):


But we think there will still be pressure because you have a lot of people that have
shut down plants that are shut down and people that are trying to convert the
inventory to cash continue to put pressure on this. So there is still inventory out
there. The prices some people are offering, you certainly can't produce, run
plants at those prices or you burn cash. So I think the first half will be tough.


At the time, CRR was certainly burning cash. Negative gross profit was $4.6 million in
3Q15 and accelerated to negative $15.6 million in 4Q15. CRR's guidance for 1H16 was
even prescient, as CRR negative gross profit would increase to $23.6 million in 1Q16 and
$20 million in 2Q16.


So again, why did CRR restart McIntyre in 4Q15?


We can think of only one reason: to avoid an official impairment test that would be
overseen by its auditor, Ernst & Young (E&Y). Recall, the 1Q15 impairment test was only
an "interim" analysis, and auditors typically only audit annual results. By CRR's own self-
serving definition, only "mothballed" facilities needed to be tested for impairment. So, in
our view, CRR appears to have restarted McIntyre simply to avoid E&Y's scrutiny with
respect to ASC 360-10, the very same accounting rule that Mr. Cash from the SEC had
drilled into on a series of recent inquires.


Let's take a look at E&Y's specific guidance for ASC 360-10-35-21. Per E&Y, a "long-lived
asset (asset group) shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable." E&Y provided a
number of examples of events requiring tests for impairment, any one of which could
trigger an impairment test. Below are several items that we believe would trigger an
impairment test virtually every quarter for the last six quarters across each of CRR's
ceramic proppant plants, all of which would be classified as long-lived assets:

(Source: Ernst & Young)


In estimating cash flows for the purposes of performing the recovery test, E&Y states that
"the estimates should include only future cash inflows less associated cash outflows that
are directly associated with and are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and
eventual disposition of the asset."


The last time CRR generated any cash flow was in 4Q14, when the company sold 409
million pounds of ceramics. This was one quarter before it mothballed the McIntyre plant,
and at the time, utilization was 82%. Today, ceramics utilization is ~15% and pricing is
down 30%+ since 4Q14. As we reviewed CRR's outlook earlier, management does not
have a near-term forecast for materially improving volumes or ceramic price. Rather, as
was shown in the company's response to the SEC, CRR assumptions for McIntyre's
impairment test include restarting the plant 3 years from the interim impairment test date
(which would have been calendar year 2017) at 50% utilization, at ceramic pricing similar
to or lower than 2015 levels.


However, in our view, even if 50% utilization were achieved, at 2015 pricing levels,
McIntyre would be cash flow negative in 2017 (utilizing 2015 and 2016YTD historical CRR
performance as a guide). Thus, in CRR's interim impairment test in 1Q15, the company
was clearly relying on ceramic proppant conditions improving in 2018 and beyond in order
to justify that the carrying value of the asset was not impaired.


As E&Y repeatedly states, the assumptions for impairment tests "requires a significant
amount of judgement."


Our conclusions are the following:


1. As highlighted by the SEC inquiry, CRR's distinction between "idle" and "mothball"
plants appears to be fairly arbitrary, in our view. By making the "idled" versus

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4014102-carbo-ceramics-response-sec-reveals-alarming-accounting-concerns 8/14


"mothballed" distinction, we think the company is effectively excusing itself from taking
impairment write-downs on its PP&E. However, an analysis of E&Y's ASC 360-10-35-
21 guidance does not make this distinction. Per E&Y guidance, multiple impairment
triggers appear to be met that would apply to the Toomsboro and Millen idled facilities
in addition to McIntyre. These impairment tests have likely been triggered multiple
times for each plant over the last six quarters.


2. We believe CRR's judgment in preparing cash flow estimates for the 1Q15 McIntyre
interim impairment test was inadequate. The asset should have been written down
substantially at the time to reflect the new market reality, as multiple of the impairment
conditions were met according to E&Y's interpretation of ASC 360-10-35-21. CRR
appears to be using undisclosed, overly optimistic assumptions about ceramic
proppant demand in 2018 and beyond to justify not taking large impairments.


3. Restarting McIntyre in 4Q15 with the plans to "mothball" it again served no business
purpose for CRR at the time, given poor market conditions and CRR's outlook for a
continued weak market environment. We believe that by re-bucketizing McIntyre to
"idle" instead of "mothball" status, the company may have justified that an impairment
test at its annual audit with E&Y was not required.


4. By avoiding an impairment charge in 2015, CRR may have delayed a breach in its
asset coverage ratio under its credit facility.


5. By avoiding an impairment charge in 2016 year to date, the company is
misrepresenting its financial health, in our view. While asset impairments are non-cash
charges in nature, such impairment charges do provide valuable information to both
creditors and public market equity investors. The carrying value of PP&E, as well as
tangible book value which PP&E value informs, helps shape investors' views of mid-
cycle earnings power for a cyclical company like this one. In the case of CRR, 88% of
tangible book value is PP&E as of 2Q16. Thus, by potentially overstating both PP&E
and tangible book, CRR may be misleading investors at a time when it is raising equity
through an ATM facility with Cowen.


CRR appears to be re-classifying long-term assets into categories that the company
deems do not require impairments (i.e., "idled" instead of "mothballed"), even though ASC
360-10-35-21 would otherwise require impairment tests and does not appear to make the
same distinction. Then, when an impairment test is actually required (i.e., for "mothballed"
assets ) in a formally audited setting at the end of the year, it can re-bucketize the asset to
another asset category that does not require impairment ("idled"). Furthermore, for
situations when CRR does indeed need to take an impairment test (i.e., the quarter in
which an asset is "mothballed,"), apparently it can utilize market assumptions for its assets

that we believe have no basis in (1) recent history, (2) current reality or (3) the company's
own near- to medium-term market outlook in order to project long-term cash flows that
inform the carrying value of such assets subject to impairment testing.


Apparently CRR is making bullish assumptions about the distant future to avoid long-lived
asset impairments, even though strong evidence, as we have documented in detail in our
last article, suggests that its largest two remaining E&P customers, COP and CLR, have
recently stopped using ceramic proppant. While according to FracFocus, other major
Bakken E&Ps, such as XOM and Statoil, stopped using ceramic proppant well over a year
ago.

Not sure how any of this is relevant considering the current market cap implies the PP&E is worth a lot less than the
carrying value and that their current loan facility has a liquidity maintenance covenant as opposed to an asset
coverage covenant.


As an aside, the company may choose to only produce certain product categories at certain facilities due to differing
equipment, differing access to raw materials, or differing logistical costs of getting the product to a specific client's
location (hence a few possible reasons why a given facility was brought back online for a short amount of time).


As an additional aside, I'm not sure of the wisdom behind continuing to short a company that is currently at a ten year
low. Could CRR go bankrupt in the next two years? Absolutely. But with the price this low what is the market implying
about that possibility? Assuming an upside share price of $50 if the company's equity base makes it through the
current downturn and its new technology products gain traction seems reasonable, as does a $0 share price if the
company has to reorganize or liquidates. At a current $10 share price the market is implying an 80% chance of the
latter scenario given those assumptions. So to short this company means you are inherently assuming that probability
is 90% or higher, which it very well may be. But if things start turning around the market can react very quickly to
positive information, and the upside potential on this particular company can cause significant pain to shorts (I would
personally rather short a company where the upside pain is only double the current price, as opposed to 5x).

Ecas, great point on the liquidity maint covenant. I am curious how you get to a $50 scenario? I actually was
shorting in the 40s and 50s but started covering below 30 and think the last bit in the 18-20 range (if I
remember correctly). I'm not some genius or anything as I was using it as a hedge on SLCA long which I took
a beating in. At the time, I was modeling CRR would come back in the next upcycle and modeling $2 in
earnings with a 15 PE.


However, I recently started shorting again as I just don't see CRR recovering. Everything I read is about going
to all sand completions. Just looking at 2014 numbers I see 650M in revenues, 28% gross margin, and 2.41
in EPS. That would be a 20x PE and I just don't see that PE being realistic with technology that has a much
smaller moat in most areas (and none in some areas).

Your thesis here makes no sense whatsoever, with all do respect. your logic implies that you should be
shorting the likes of Apple, Facebook, and many others near there 52 week high. On the flip side, you imply
that one should never short companies like drys at $10, SDRL at $10, Enron at $10 etc. I could go on and on
with examples. One of the biggest traps in investing, long or short, is looking at the historical aggregate price
of a stock and thinking that for some irrational reason, just because it traded there in the past, it should go
back there again. You have to look at the current Macro and Micro variables that effect the company currently
and how that will effect them going forward, regardless of historic stock price, otherwise you would be loading
up on Sears at $60, $50, $40, $30 etc. You don't have to have a opinion on whether a company is going
bankrupt, or to the moon, to determine the direction.

Exactly dhunter. Also, PUT options can protect a short seller from any huge spike or turn around while
delivering all the upside for a small fee (assuming ITM PUTs).

That was an interesting comment about avoiding a short at the low. I was always taught that smart short sellers wait
until the end, when the business is clearly worth zero and bankruptcy is all but guaranteed.


That would mean shorting it at the low.


Amateur short sellers begin shorting at the high. They're usually years too early.


Sadly, I've written short articles against companies that were still expensive. I was too early. But I don't do those types
of shorts any longer.


The real risk with CRR is the 37% short interest. If things do turn for the better...wham! The shorts could get killed.
You had better be very, very confident to take this bet. If oil prices rose and people drove the shares higher due to
speculative recovery (even though declining demand is secular and not cyclical)...again you could get pulverized at no
fault of your own analysis.


25 Oct 2016, 09:22 PM 


Trending Value, Contributor
I just looked at the financials for the first time. CRR has another considerable risk for shorts. It's market cap is
about 1/3rd of its book value and its debt-to-equity is pretty conservative.


Okay, so this article makes the case that CRR hasn't adequately impaired the assets. But the assets are
selling for 33 cents on the dollar. To short, you'd have to believe the assets are worth far less than 33 cents in
a bankruptcy liquidation.


Good luck trying to determine the liquidation value. I don't want to short this company when it's that low
relative to book value. I see no valid justification to think CRR shares are worth $0 when liquidation value is
clearly higher. The assets are mostly physical and goodwill/intangibles are minimal.

Mr. Quint, don't agree at all with your analysis here. Fortunately there are many times when the simple fundamentals
will tell the obvious economic future of an company, and the price of it's stock. This company has a declining outlook
across a broad range of financial matrices, thus the significantly declining stock price..period. 
Disclosure: Closed half of my puts at a 360% non-annualized profit, will let the other half ride just a little longer. 
Great call spotlight, and also Michael Filloon, who also shorted CCR about 8 months ago.

I don't disagree that this is a poor company. I just don't think it's a good idea to remain short at 33 cents on
the dollar of the book value. There comes a point when the short needs to be covered at a profit. I'd say that
time has long passed.


I wouldn't invest in this company. Don't get me wrong. I'm just saying not to short it. I'm not sure what the
liquidation value is. But it's risky to assume it's lower than 33 cents without some very informed, high depth
analysis on the resale value of the PP&E. That sort of analysis was not conducted in this article or the
previous.

Steve, I am going to quote you. "I was always taught that smart short sellers wait until the end, when the

finished updating my work yet on the numbers but from the initial take I am considering adding to my short
position, not covering.


Did this article not convince you that some book value should have been impaired??

Sure, and I still believe in that quote. But what if in a bankruptcy liquidation the shareholders could get more
than the current market cap?


My quote pertains to bankrupt companies worth $0 or close to it. It doesn't pertain to something like CRR
because it's liquidation value could be more than the current market cap. Again, it's trading at roughly 1/3rd of
book value (prior to the 27% crash 2 days ago).


Yes, I was convinced that the book value is impaired. But there is no analysis telling me how much it was
impaired. If it's only impaired by 50%, then the shares are still cheaper than the liquidation value.


To short this company, you need to have a good idea what its assets are worth in liquidation. No analysis has
covered this. Everyone is fixated on earnings but that's an incomplete picture.

I have no idea what the assets are worth. So I'm not shorting. I doubt anyone has a clear idea, because
determining that would take a lot of hard work that goes beyond looking at the financial statements.


I prefer obvious short sales myself. So I wouldn't want the chore of valuing all of CRR's PP&E.

Steven Quint - This assumes management isn't going to hold on for as long as possible to keep getting their
paychecks. While they do this, they dig a deeper hole. If bankruptcy was announced today, I would agree with
you. But I see bankruptcy being announced in 18-30 months after they pissed away a lot of money.

Okay. I concur with your logic. I also agree management will probably piss away the equity. Then again,
maybe not. If cash runs out first (and it will) they might go into bankruptcy immediately rather than selling stuff
to pay for even more cash bleed. It's hard to say but I do share in your cynicism.


I'm not defending this company at all. I'm just hesitant to pull the trigger on a short that might also be a deep
value investment. If there was more debt on the books then this would be obvious...but debt isn't that high.
Most of the enterprise value is shareholder's equity.

I love these oil and gas entities. They have a "great management team" when things are great. But they can't manage
their way out of a paper bag when they really have to perform!

Yep. They always opt to keep operations going rather than slow down and preserve cash. There's absolutely
no defense...and they're all self-interested managements.
