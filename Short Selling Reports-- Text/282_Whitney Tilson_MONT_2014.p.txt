Why I Just Made Montage Technology Group My Largest Short
Position
Jun. 11, 2014 12:30 PM ET151 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


This morning's announcement by Montage Technology Group (NASDAQ:MONT) that it is
being acquired, and the resulting run-up in its stock, has made this one of the best shorts
I've ever seen, so I added to my position this morning.


I first shorted Montage late last year in the high teens when I concluded that a majority of
its sales were either fictional or illegal - and I'm even more certain of it today - for reasons
that have been well covered by the excellent reports by ARISTIDES CAPITAL and Gravity
Research on this site and elsewhere.


Then in March of this year, Montage announced that a non-binding proposal to acquire the
company for $21.50 in cash was made by "Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology
Investment Co., Ltd. ("PDSTI"), a wholly state-owned limited liability company directly
under Pudong New Area government of Shanghai."


The stock traded up to almost the bid and I figured PDSTI would soon figure out the truth
about Montage and walk, so I didn't cover my short position.


Then, this morning Montage issued a press release announcing that it had entered into a
"definitive merger agreement under which PDSTI will acquire all of the outstanding
Ordinary Shares of Montage for US$22.60 per Ordinary Share."


In light of this, am I wrong in my conclusion about Montage? I don't think so. In fact, after
reading Aristides Capital's latest report, which coincidentally was also released this
morning, I'm more certain than ever.


But then why is PDSTI going through with the deal? Of course they've read the Gravity
and Aristides reports, so are they really that clueless? I think not. Rather, my best guess is
that this is a well-orchestrated scam to defraud the government of Shanghai, which is the
sole investor in PDSTI. It's really pretty simple: the guys running PDSTI are conspiring
with the guys running Montage to pay $693 million for a company that's maybe worth $100
million - and then they share the excess proceeds of $593 million among themselves and
the shareholders. I can't prove this of course - it's only speculation, but it's what makes the
most sense to me. If you think this sounds far-fetched, you don't know China very well.
Using government money to vastly overpay for acquisitions is a very common scam.

That said, this is China so the deal still might go through - I'd estimate that there's a 50%
chance that it does. But a lot can happen between now and when the deal actually closes
(estimated at 12/1). Among other things, Montage is in the midst of an internal self-audit
for fraud and also is in arrears in filing its 2013 annual financials, so my best estimate is
that there's a 50% chance that PSDTI walks.


This morning, the stock has traded up nearly 10% to $21.50, so am I covering and
throwing in the towel? Heck no - I added to my position as this is now one of the best
shorts I've ever seen. If the deal goes through at $22.60, my loss is a mere 5% - and if it
breaks, the upside is 50-100%. Now that's the kind of risk-reward I like!

Excellent Article , What do you suspect the time frame of acquisition/cancelling the deal ? I was thinking about buying
Jan puts but I am not sure how long will the story take to unfold :(

Author’s reply »  New Bee, My understanding of the timing is that the deal is likely to go through (or not) by
late Nov/early Dec -- but in China, you never know...

I, too, believe it's a scam. But someone needs to try and alert authorities back in China.

Aristides Capital, Contributor
Paulo, SARFT is obviously aware of MONT's shenanigans. PDSTI is aware as well, but has chosen to pursue
this deal in spite of that. This seems most likely a case of the individual motives of influential people not
aligning well with the common good. The influential people will either get their way or they will not. PDSTI is
playing a dangerous game with state money.


I can sleep well here. The worst that will happen to us is that we lost money. There are officers and directors
of MONT who need to worry about criminal liability for the securities laws they have broken, and the folks at
PDSTI could, worse case scenario for them, end up like the folks who put melamine in infant formula. I'm
always amazed that people who already have a comfortable-enough life are willing to risk so much to make a
few more bucks or help out a "friend" who has made poor choices.

Usually when there is smoke there is fire... We are on board with you Whitney. Also liked your presentation at NYSSA
last month w/ Adrangi. We've structured our shorts in a similar manner with many small positions spread out over
multiple sectors.

Considering the stock is right near the takeout price- I think it may very well be worth a short, with very limited upside
and tons of downside

Didn't you say the same thing on VIPS around 100? still short-thx.


11 Jun 2014, 02:36 PM


Whitney Tilson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I was short VIPS briefly (I fortunately got out before it really ripped), but don't recall calling it
one of the best shorts I'd ever seen. There's a huge difference: VIPS is growing (or at least claims to be
growing) very rapidly, so if it turns out to be legitimate (I remain skeptical), the sky is the limit for the stock, so
it's a very dangerous short (which is why I covered).


In contrast, if I'm wrong on MONT (or even if I'm right) and the deal goes through, I lose a mere 5% in six
months. Yawn... (Assuming there's no topping bid, which is always possible, but I think highly unlikely here,
as the initial non-binding deal was announced nearly three months ago, giving MONT plenty of time to seek
out other, higher bids.)


11 Jun 2014, 03:10 PM


Clayton Rulli, Contributor
WT: you are right. And even if a short investor was a little scared of an increased bid, you could just buy a
call, which are very cheap even @ the 22.50 strike.


The bid ask for the Jan 22.50 is .30/.70 with last trade @ .40. say you shorted @ 21.46/share and got a .50
bid filled on this Jan call, max net loss would be 22.90-21.46= 6.7%

Your risk could be more than the delta to bid+margin rates. If this is heavily shorted and the buyout goes
through you'll have competition when you try to close out your short. If the stock becomes illiquid, you could
end up paying 2-3x to close your short.

Articles like Whitney's are absolutely essential for the cause of the MONT shorts. They also are a service to ordinary
Shanghai citizens, whose taxes are funding this fraudulent takeover. It is only through articles like this - that raise
awareness and rally investors to the cause - that the dubious takeover can be avoided. The more light that is shined
on the situation, the better.

I knew you are out of your mind shorting VIPS with huge tailwinds of eCommerce, niche, leadership, Harvard Grad
CFO, industry trends - all pointing to huge growth ahead. Good you covered (better you should have gone long like
me - check my profile and comments on VIPS IPO prospectus and why I still remain bullish on VIPS)


Risk / rewards are say 5% vs 100% - but what are the ODDS of an acquisition like this falling out after reaching an
agreement and after months of DD - do you think those odds are over 1 to 2%? Simple math would have told you,
shorting here the ADJUSTED real / rewards make no sense given the company already announced an agreement to
sell itself at 22.60!


I can't really believe how you're still in the business after shorting GOOG at 80, VIPS at 90, YY at 20? If you don't
know how to invest in GROWTH, stay away but shorting a company with huge growth potential like VIPS is calling for
a suicide.

I don't follow MONT or have any position in this company. But shorting with 99% chance of losing 5% is a fools
paradise!


11 Jun 2014, 05:02 PM


Oliver Rowe, Contributor
So why not follow your conviction and be long? There is a 5% coin sitting on the ground that would take ~half
a year to pick up, not bad for 99% certainty.

I might short naked puts .. usually that's what I do on mergers/acquisitions. All my such positions including
FMCN (Focus Media .. ) expired worthless on mergers/acquisition related puts. Currently I am short PUTS of
IDIX for example.


Usually I don't chase after 5% coins even with 100% certainty .. Look at my profile. Do I look like someone
going after 5% returns?

Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including with respect to the Company’s entry into an agreement

termination fee of $40,770,000, but if the Company terminates the Merger Agreement to enter into a Superior

As these shorts lose money like Mr. Tilson who keeps losing money shorting good growth stocks with
incredible tailwinds and industry trends - they get so desperate that they delude themselves and spin that the
acquirer has not done due diligence before shelling out the money. LOL - it shows their desperation IMO

Did Tilson ever admit before today that he covered his SHORT position on VIPS before it ripped higher? For
all you know, he might be just covering and going long all he can on MONT so his 50% losses on MONT are
covered with 10 times the long position x 5% = 50% gains so he can come out a year from now and say he
did not lose anything on MONT?


Don't fall for the tricks - this is not a 5% risk vs. 100% reward situation. The odds of 100% reward are so
pathetically LOW and the odds of 5% risk are so HIGH - on an adjusted basis the TRUE risk / reward
FAVORS going long rather than going SHORT.


As Mr. Tilson does not understand these concepts well, and does not have a clue on the growth stocks he
keeps shorting good stocks like VIPS and gets burned. He should read all my comments on VIPS last 2 years
and why I went long VIPS at $4.35 (now sitting with 4100% gains in 2 years) and remained long on shares so
he can learn something for his future benefit


Mr. Tilson is also short YY .. That's another stock he is going to be burned on his SHORT position unless he
already covered.

I have to say that Tilson didn't understand China at all. I didn't know what lead him to short YY and VIPS. Did

Aristides Capital, Contributor
and here is some Chinese for you to read:


http://bit.ly/1osww8H


This article explains perfectly well why so few of MONT's set top box chips actually appear on the market--MONT's
set-top box business is mostly black market banned chips.


If the government of China thinks MONT is so great, why did they just order the company on April 29 to stop making
illegal set top box chips?


What the experts on the ground in China have told us is that MONT sells vastly fewer chips (in the legal market) that
ALi or other competitors, that MONT had to dramatically reduce pricing because nobody was buying their chips, and
that MONT can't possibly be making money selling HD chips at $3 a pop.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2263643-why-i-just-made-montage-technology-group-my-largest-short-position 10/32


To understand MONT, all one needs to do is ask the people in the Chinese STB industry, and to use common sense.
If memory buffers have 65% GMs, and legal STB chips have 35% GMs, how the heck does a company with almost all
of its revenue from STB have 58% gross margins? Illegal chips have a very high gross margin, because they let you
get satellite TV for free. When did MONT's GMs go through the roof? The same year that LQW started exclusively
selling "the product," (i.e. the banned chips), which was pretty much right after China banned all of the illegal chips in
2010. Instead of ceasing production, it looks pretty clear that MONT just enjoyed its newly found near-monopoly in
black market chips.


PDSTI buying MONT in the interests of national security makes as much sense as the state of New York's pension
fund buying a tobacco smuggling operation in the interests of national security.


I don't know if this merger goes through or not, but I do know that 90%+ of MONT's claimed chip production doesn't
seem to appear anywhere in the supply chain, that MONT's gross margins are inconsistent with the business they
claim to be in, that MONT established an entity called LQW that distributes 70% of the company's revenue with no
clear business purpose (other than selling illegal chips), and that the government of China recently ordered MONT to
stop selling illegal chips. And I also know that nearly 6 million shares changed hands today, so more than a quarter of
the outstanding shares were sold. What we don't know is how many shares management sold, because they aren't
required to file a form 4.

Michael Sacerdote, Contributor
Thanks for the outstanding article and nice comment, Aristides. I think you got the story right and Gravity got
it wrong. Instead of being a fraudulent company with dramatically overstated revenues as argued by Gravity,
MONT is a real company engaged in an illegal business.


There's actually a nice logic for acquisition of MONT by a state-owned enterprise: since the state is usually
the beneficiary of the satellite fees, the government may have decided that it's easier to get compensation for
the satellite service by selling the "illegal" decoder chips than by charging fee-for-service.

rickeespal
where does one purchase these chips to get free satellite tv, i'll take a handful


12 Jun 2014, 02:48 AM


Aristides Capital, Contributor
Thank you for the compliment, Michael, but it is not fair to say that Gravity got it wrong. We would not have
even been looking at this company were it not for Gravity doing their phenomenal work on the nature of LQW.
We thought outright invented revenue was the most likely explanation for a long time; it is easy to find people
knowledgeable about the legal set top box industry who know that Montage has a very small presence there;
it is much harder to find people willing to speak about the black market. We didn't discover the illegal chips;
someone else brought it to our attention. Only in retrospect does it all make sense.

So-called Experts just learned and talked about a couple days of ago, we know the facts and source many weeks
ago.....But you don't want to admitted.


"So-called illegal chips" is the one who could receive satellite TVs from CNN, BBC, and Chinese Banned Falun
Gong's, it is easy to encrypted. You support the suppress of freedom of speech? Those chips are less 5% of total
revenue. The entity you mentioned in that article is not the regularity authority for chip industry in China. As your logic,
now the acquirer authority, Shanghai Government, is also the regularity authority. They approved.....


You told us that 浦东科投 will never buy this company, now you say they are bribed. You never know why Chinese
sides want to bring MONT safely home. For national interests and securities. You probably don't know that Chinese
national security and defense budget getting doubled every 3-4 years, especially in chip defense chip industries to
stop US NSA activities in China, as an US listed company, MONT can't involved. Last year return homed SPRD
already got bit Chinese national defense contracts this year. I would not like to talk these sensitive issue as I mainly
am an investor, however, since today some Chinese news media already mentioned it.


Someone said to send a letter to Chinese ambassador, we are laughing. The only way you can't stop Chinese
government to bring MONT home is to call Obama or NSA if they would like to take care of your puts money and to
risk serious national conflict with China.

Zhang, the available evidence strongly indicates that the illegal chip sales are 90%+ of the set top box chip
revenue and 70%+ of the company's entire revenue (i.e. the entirety of LQW's sales).


If only 5% of the revenue is black market, then why do so few distributors carry MONT chips, why are their so
few low-end set top boxes for sale with MONT chips in them, why do none of the companies that MONT
claims as a competitor consider MONT to be a competitor, and why do folks in China's legal set top box
market think they are such a small player?

If China really thinks that paying 10-15x forward revenue for a memory buffer developer is in their national
security interest, then they should go for it. It is puzzling as to why anyone would pay that much for MONT,
though; such a high price tag seems more likely to be due to some sort of under the table deal.

Arisisides capital or whatever- 
The funny thing is you tell your "on the ground" Chinese research guys that this is a fraud and I need bad news on it
to confirm it. These guys could care less but want to get paid and come back and give you information to confirm your
thesis but in reality they are just giving you what you want(same thing on long side)-I saw this happen with EDU at
10$-Vips at 30$ where on the ground research confirmed the shorts fact it was a fraud-give me a break. Has a hedge
fund ever gone long one Chinese stock ?ha- missing a stealth rally.

Jtech, we didn't pay anyone on the ground in China for anything. we'd much rather be long stocks than short
them. not saying we aren't subject to confirmation bias from time to time like every other human on the planet,
but in this case, nobody had an incentive to lie to us. what the people on the ground said is the same thing
that the numbers from the chip distributors and the set top box sellers say, with a little more color. for
example, we learned that MONT was selling their HD chips for $3, not $6, from a source on the ground.
MONT is what it is.

It's really pretty simple: the guys running PDSTI are conspiring with the guys running Montage to pay $693 million for
a company that's maybe worth $100 million - and then they share the excess proceeds of $593 million among
themselves and the shareholders.

Comments about MONT's 10-K filing from Mark Voll, CFO from the May 6th conference call:


"Yes, we'd love to be able to file our K, and we are working to do so as rapidly as we can." 
"...the June 2 date is the date in which we have to submit a plan to NASDAQ. When we anticipate that we would be
filing the K."


So when will we see that 10-K? We know they've been working *rapidly* on this for months now.


Unlike many of the other players in this story, it appears that Mark Voll is a U.S. citizen with assets in the U.S.
Independent Director Sodini also appears to reside in the US as well.


Do you think these gentlemen are hoping and praying they can keep the NASDAQ listing going long enough to get
taken out by PDSTI without ever certifying and filing the 10-K or revealing the results of the over "6000 hours" of work
done in support of the audit committee's review?


A dangerous game of chicken indeed.

If the deal falls though, we would definitely expect that by 2017, the SEC has litigated against Mark Voll and
that he is banned from every being an officer of a public company again. It will be interesting to see what
happens if the deal goes through. Can you be the CFO of a large U.S. company, help to conceal material
information in the IPO and secondary offering process, give incorrect information to investors repeatedly, fail
to disclose an order from a regulator to stop making your product, and yet somehow still not face any sort of
action for it? We will find out.

without any meaningful enforcement." Talk about misplaced priorities!

If Montage is one such "real bussiness(sic) in China" you are referring to, then there is a possibility that many

long-term investors would like to own.

*** Pure speculation ***


What are the odds that $MONT directors have realized the game is OVER and the entire buyout offer is 100% fake
and just a chance for them to dump shares for the next month or two?


I can feasibly see a scenario where they paid off 1-2 people say $1M or so to make a 'buy out offer' with lots of terms
& conditions, with the implicit understanding that it falls apart in a few months...


Why risk death penalty to take over a worthless company with $700M of taxpayer money when you could just push
some paperwork for a few million and the execs could make a few million as well...


There's literally no difference in profit, but the consequences are much smaller.


...for everyone except Mark Voll. Doesn't add up for him. Who is this guy? Whitney Tilson is wealthy enough to do
background checks, send people to talk to Chinese officials, etc. Can you play like a big boy? I sure would if I even
had 5-6 figures in this... Let alone 7-8...


12 Jun 2014, 05:56 PM


J Mintzmyer, Marketplace Contributor
Isn't it kinda strange how MONT comments were super bearish over the past month and then this buyout offer comes
out and BAM! we have a whole cast of rando China-pump characters on parade?


Stockplaza you really need to stop talking about VIPS as a case for MONT. That's like using LNKD as an argument to
go long ANGI. Tilson famously flip-flopped on NFLX, but to his credit the stock is up 3-4x since he went back long--
let's look to the future. Attack the thesis, not the person.

J Mintzmyer - point well taken. 
Since I don't know MONT at all, I was judging Tilson based on his short positions in GOOG YY VIPS NFLX
etc.


I think the premise that risk reward here is 5% vs. 100% is purely based on speculation that the DEAL like this
will fall off. The chance of this deal falling off seems to be very close to ZERO thus making the TRUE adjusted

risk / reward in favor of going LONG vs. going SHORT. That's the thesis I wanted to highlight. In a normal risk
/ reward situation, usually there are 50/50 odds of each happening but that is not the case here, given the B/O
agreement at cash price.


I have no personal agenda against Tilson, I hardly know him. First I heard of him, he was short on VIPS and
then later I heard he was short YY. I immediately concluded he is a clueless investor. Then I googled him and
learned of his famous Google short at IPO price of $40 (adjusted for split). And never looked at him until this
article somehow popped up on SA (homepage?)


12 Jun 2014, 09:50 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Whitney Tilson is a value investor. GOOG was way overpriced at the time of its IPO. He was correct. It took
years for it to grow into its valuation.


His long term track record is actually quite good. Being right even 55% of the time leads to great things in
investing.


12 Jun 2014, 10:04 PM


stockplaza
GOOG flew right out of the gate. It never traded below IPO price and in fact doubled within couple of months
and never looked back. Now, it grew into 15 times IPO price despite corrections (2008/09 included) on the
way. When somebody is a value investor and does not get growth stocks, they should stay away from them
instead of shorting them.


Let us say Stock A is growing at 100% EPS with current EPS of 1 and trading at $100 for a PE of 100. A
value investor is not expected to invest at that PE level. But shorting such a stock UNLESS the growth is not
sustained or accelerated for a few years is misguided. Why? let us say the company A keeps growing at
100% for 5 years - its EPS will be like this 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 .. At $32 EPS, if the stock price stays at only $100,
then its PE is around 3.


In fact if you look at stocks like GOOG PCLN etc. this is what happened. Companies that were having $1
EPS or negative EPS indeed grew past $32, $64 EPS with shares commanding $1200+ instead of $100
when a value investor that does not understand the GROWTH would have been short sighted and shorted
with a year 1 PE of 100 and the stock price of $100. Roll forward 5 to 10 years, the same stock is perhaps
chased by even value investors at $1000 stock price because it is trading at a PE of only 10 or 20 as the EPS
grew to 50 to 100 in the mean time. Examples of this are GOOG and PCLN but there are several others like
that.


Shorting growth stocks by a value investor is very RISKY and suicidal unless the investor is CONVINCED
that the company does not have the growth prospects and can never grow into valuations.


I think Tilson committed such horrendous mistakes too many times as seen from VIPS YY GOOG NFLX etc.
Maybe he covered and saved himself from big losses but shorting them in the first place shows how
misguided his investing styles are .. and equally misguided is the risk/reward presented in this article on

MONT. As mentioned already, the true risk/reward adjusted for the probability of a cash purchase deal falling
out of bed completely, favors being long MONT than shorting it IMO.


13 Jun 2014, 01:26 AM


Oliver Rowe, Contributor
I think most people in this thread know that this trade, like every other, needs to be viewed with a risk-
adjusted lens.


"The chance of this deal falling off seems to be very close to ZERO thus...." The spread has now widened to
7% which indicates that the general market disagrees with you. And while you may well be correct that the
deal goes through...I would argue until I am blue in the face that the probability of it going through was
anything close to 100%.


It would be nice to stay on topic about this particular trading idea rather than bringing up a plethora of other
trades that are fairly irrelevant at this point. I would love to hear solid a solid counter to Tilson and AC's
"speculations" rather than the generic "China wants to bring MONT back home" quasi-argument.


13 Jun 2014, 07:15 AM


Keubiko, Contributor
His track record is out there and his fund returns are very good. Even better risk-adjusted. For every GOOG
that goes public and a high price and executes almost flawlessly for the next 10 years there are many many
more that stumble and fall flat on their faces. In 2012 GOOG was trading barely above where it was in late
2005. It's easy to be an armchair QB on Monday morning. Value investing is about investing with a margin of
safety.


I've owned GOOG for years as a core holding. But this isn't about Google. My beef is simply that you are
making an ad hominem attack on Mr Tilson by claiming he isn't a good investor because of 2 or 3 of his
hundreds of picks over the years. His public track record is good so your premise is demonstrably false.


13 Jun 2014, 08:13 AM


New Bee
@stock plaza thanks for teaching primary math to all of us. I am sure Mr. Tilson is managing 70+ million
without learning basic math. We all are forever indebted to you for your great service.


On the off chance you have anything else on the short thesis to contribute. Do comment back. The only claim
I have heard till now is that in risk adjusted basis the risk/reward ratio is not that enticing , which I kind of
agree with.

We actually think the deal has a better than 50% chance of closing, given that they've taken it this far, but
goog/mot is in a different universe than MONT. To find a company that was known to be nearly as sketchy as

I don't know in which world Oliver is living .. but his 50% of M&A deals falling through cracks is definitely fact
based.


I have shorted PUTS of 100s M&A deals and not one fell through .. Only thing that scared me a little bit was
GOOG/MOT due to China Reg. approvals or something in which momentarily I suffered 100% loss on sold
PUTS. I shorted more and in the end when DEAL closed, ended up making more money anyway!

You sound like you're very new to this business. Oliver is correct. Deal failure is common. The buyer has no

cracks are rare, rarer than a deal getting rebid / overbid like $AMLN $HSH etc. I can tell you more overbids
than deals falling off. Even $OPEN $FIO are trading above deal price (market expecting some more potential
bidders?) .. Oliver seems to be clueless when he says 50% of deals falling through cracks. He must be living
a different world.


In shorting PUTS on 100s M&A deals, I have not seen one fall through despite GOOG/MOT, FMCN etc. sold
puts temporarily incurring losses when put premiums spiked on fears or rumors - eventually when the deals
closed, it ended all well with ALL NAKED PUTS premium collected with 100% gains!

It depends which stage of the deal cycle you are referring to, you misunderstood me if you thought I was
saying that all publicly announced deals have a 50% chance to fail.


17 Jun 2014, 07:34 PM


Oliver Rowe, Contributor
For publicly announced deals it is ~15% as an average, for low-quality businesses that number rises. Either
way, using an average to calculate failure risk on a single company would not be advisable.

Oliver this what you said "Historically ~50% of M&A deals fail, betting on deals falling a part can be more
lucrative than betting that they go through"


For the past several years, I am betting on M&A deals announced to conclude successfully without one failure
in any of the PUTS I sold short naked. For me taking the other side of what you mentioned was very lucrative
and profitable.


As of this moment, I sold some Jan 2015 MONT puts. If some rumors or panic sets in, and the Puts premium
goes up on rumor, I am going to sell even more PUTS. My bet is that the deal will go through.


Not that I know too much about MONT (actually I don't). My thesis is that Tilson is always on the WRONG
SIDE and there is high chance a deal like this WILL GO THROUGH.


I placed my bets against Tilson's call FWIW. Take care.

13 Jun 2014, 10:52 AM


Wait
First of all, MONT is not cheap. If it is not because of this buying offer, I would not long MONT. Now why some
company want to buy MONT at this price? The reasons are very simple and actually not be announced: 
1. Chip industry company is regarded as fast growing industry (or may have growth potential)in CHINA. The PE of
CHIP COMPANY listed in Chinese stock market is somewhere between 70 to 80. However, In US stock market, Even
intel's PE is only 16. The company made that offer want to list this company in Chinese stock market and enjoy the
high PE there. (the same logic is also the underlying cause of the privatization of some recent other game companies
such as GA, GAME. )


2. Chinese government want to boost it's own CHIP industry and will give incentive to these companies but only if the
company is owned and registered in CHINA.


About the illegal product that been banned recently, I agree with most of you, they are illegal(Basically, you can get
free satellite TV program such as CNN HBO, My friend's family in China used to have one). However, the most
valuable part of the company is that they provide high performance, low power memory interface solutions that enable
memory intensive server applications. (There are only two companies do this business, the other one is in USA)

I think Seeking alpha provide a perfect platform for everyone to present the evidence and logic argument about an
investment ideal. I enjoy all these information here and welcome further discussion.


Disclosure: I am longing MONT. Actually, I bought it yesterday. 


13 Jun 2014, 01:26 PM


Aristides Capital, Contributor
I have heard rumors that MONT CFO Mark Voll said MONT was going to put Inphi "out of business" in
memory buffers, so perhaps that is why you believe there are only two companies in the space, but in addition
to MONT and IDT, Inphi (IPHI) is also a major player.


The memory buffer business is indeed a good business, especially the cutting edge DDR4 stuff which is
starting to ramp from an extremely low base (as in, $700,000 per quarter). However, MONT's memory buffer
revenue does not come close to justifying the price of this acquisition.

AC,


You are the probably the only bear article about MONT in at Seeking Alpha worth some to read. You know the
most of them are just self-fulfilled trap on their own. Note you finally recognize MONT has some cutting edge
product in a very fast track to grow ( you said from very low base). More to come....


Zhang


13 Jun 2014, 03:58 PM


Wait
You are right. Actually there are four players in this field. But only two can do mass production. Mont is one of
them. The other one is in USA. According to my information, the memory interface will produce about $40-
50M revenue for MONT this year.


Actually In China, this buying offer has been widely discussed in all kind of newspaper. Nobody has ever
question the reason why this state owned company want to give this offer. This state-owned company even
get the permission from the regulator (Interestingly, the permission is exclusive, which means other state-
owned company can not make higher bid.) I do not think this buying offer is something that under table(like
fake offer due to bribe).


This is not the first attempt that this state-owned company (Pudong) offer to buy a CHIP company. Pudong
want to buy RDA a couple of months ago but has been outbid by another State-owned company(qing hua zi

guang). When Pudong want to raise the bid again, the Chinese government regulator say stop. Because it
make no sense to let two state-owned company to compete each other in a bid for a company largely owned
by foreign investor. So that is why now regulator give Pudong the exclusive permission to make this offer.
(That is also why I think pudong make this offer very seriously, cause you can not fool the regulator). And It
also means it is unlikely that another state-owned company will compete with Pudong.


I do not know if it is a wise move for pudong to buy Mont at this price(It is not cheap). But on the other hand,
Pudong has the motivation to make this offer. Maybe simply want to get some support from government.
China recently setup a $30 B fund to support CHIP industry.


In summary, Mont is not cheap. But the deal will be sealed. I really suggest people that have large short
position to at least decrease their short position.

Hi Aristides,


FYI. Here is the link for the memory interface revenue for the first quarter.


http://bit.ly/1ltFzH3


"Total revenue for the first quarter 2014 was $35.6 million, an increase of 0.4 percent compared to $35.4
million in the prior quarter, and an increase of 77.2 percent compared to $20.1 million in the first quarter 2013.
Total revenue consisted of $26.8 million from set-top box products, or 75.3 percent of revenue, and $8.8
million from memory interface products, or 24.7 percent of revenue. "

We understand that PDSTI wishes to buy RDA. We totally understand why someone would want to buy RDA.


What we don't understand is why someone would buy MONT, when likely all of its profits are due to banned
set top box chips.


PDSTI buying MONT instead of RDA is similar to someone wanting to buy Intel, but when the Intel deal fell
through, they paid the same price to buy AMD instead.

We are well aware of how much revenue is from memory interface. The VAST majority of this $8.8 million is
from DDR3.

The secret is If the state-owned PDSTI buy Mont, the set top box Chips will not be banned any more.  
Just like a couple of weeks ago, Sohu was banned for (big bang theory) in his video service.(

However, the state-owned CCTV declared they will have Big bang theory in their TV program every soon.

I have some past experience with India's ways and I find these practices to be similar. Having some
understanding of the inner ways of workings in these countries will help avoid delusion of someone thinking
the deal will fall through.


As of now, I have sold naked PUTS expecting the deal to go close!


16 Jun 2014, 10:19 PM


Wait
Hi Aristides Capital,


I am a scientist with a Ph.D. degree. My work is to develop theory to explain fact. When I find my theory can not
explain the fact, most likely it is my theory that has some problems.


In the MONT case, the fact is somebody gave MONT a buying offer and even raised the offer after due diligence.
However your theory can not explain this fact. You probably need go back to examine your theory (Maybe there are
some thing you do not know)


Anyway, It is not a good idea to short a stock that you probably can not access all the information.


2 years ago, muddy water attacked EDU and claimed that according to Chinese law, all the education in China could
not be for-profit and all the schools are state-own property. So basically, Muddy water think EDU was doing some
illegal business and had no asset. Look at what happened in the last two years for the EDU price. You will lost a lot if
you short EDU. The same thing also happened for YONG, GA in the last several months. Actually I earned a lot from
investing in Chinese stock (My annual return for the last three years is 30%, 115%, 33% respectively)


Maybe you should hire me before you short a Chinese stock. ^-^

Just wondering if the chips dont show up in the supply chain because they are going to the military. Would that justify
the purchase by Shanghai? Im not up to speed on the black market for the chips, and I recognize that the firm has
been ordered to cease and desist on production of "illegal" chips, but where did all the chips go? Everyone on the
east coast of china has free satellite? Did they actually make the chips or is that a (no pun intended)fabrication?

His thesis of covering short position in VIPS (did he ever tell his followers to cover before or as soon as he did
- shame on this guy if he did not) existed when he went short too. Not sure what his thesis was when he went
short and then a sudden realization when he covered (I bet he did not announce his covering of shorts until
this article comments section?). Nothing changed IMO as I was following VIPS ever since I read the IPO
prospectus. In fact I have seen the same growth potential in VIPS when it was under $5 and even more
potential along the way listening to all ER calls and following every research analyst reports/comments.


BTW - I shorted more MONT Jan15 puts .. going against Tilson's call. If he wants he can scare and come up
with another article and I am there to short even more PUTS. So, bring it ON if you can.


I will seriously consider going against Mr. Tilson's shorts after doing my DD. So, definitely alert me on his
shorts if you notice. I want to make profits by taking the other side of it. Thanks in advance!
