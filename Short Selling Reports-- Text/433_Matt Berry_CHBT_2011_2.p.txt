China-Biotics: Record Earnings Don't Negate Five Unresolved Issues
Feb. 10, 2011 4:37 AM ET48 comments
by: Matt Berry


China-Biotics reported record sales Wednesday. It finished the day with a 5% loss on
heavier than usual volume.


CEO Jinan Song made a statement on behalf of the company: "We are pleased to report a
solid third quarter as our successful strategic shift from retail to bulk products continues to
show positive results." And what a shift that was. China-Biotics claimed it grew revenue by
39% -- despite having closed 95 retail outlets in the quarter ending September 2010.
There are only 15 outlets remaining in operation. Miraculously, bulk sales saved the day,
increasing 142%.


Investors were unimpressed as five serious issues have been left unresolved.


1. Last summer, China-Biotics claimed to have more than 100 retail outlets and published
a list of addresses.


Official websites by the real tenants of many of these locations were found, proving
that the addresses in question were not China-Biotics retail outlets. (See here.)


Photos by investigators in China verified that a majority of the China-Biotics retail
outlets were "missing." (See here.)


The company later changed its introduction to the list of outlets, stating that there had
been an error and that these addresses merely represented places where its products
could be found. To this day, the company has not provided another list of addresses to
account for the majority of outlets claimed in 2010. (See here.)


2. During the conference call, the question was raised again about the small amount of
interest earned on such a large cash balance. The caller ended his question with "... low
interest makes people nervous."

Those of us who have been following the company have asked ourselves, Was there a
good reason why the company earned such low interest? Many answers have been
proposed by investors and bloggers. However, the company's response to the caller's
concern was, "We are in a process of implementing a program."


Investors may have been hoping for a good reason. What they are left with is a choice
between two less attractive questions. Has the company been negligent with cash? As
bad as that may sound, it is nonetheless better than the alternative question: Does the
company really have the money?


3. The audited Chinese filings do not match the audited SEC filings...and yes, key
numbers in consolidated SAIC filings and consolidated SEC numbers should match.


In a recent article in Bloomberg, we find new emphasis on SAIC documents, "... as Roth
Capital’s due diligence procedures 'evolve,' it checks SAIC filings now too."


TheStreet:


The notion that SAIC filings are largely meaningless finds little support among some
experts. The Shanghai-born-and-raised Gerry Wang, CEO of a containership
company in Vancouver, says his extensive network of friends and colleagues in
China view accuracy in SAIC filings as an imperative.


And Peter Humphrey, a forensic accountant and corporate due diligence investigator
in China, puts it bluntly: 'The apologists for the fraudsters in the U.S. like to down
play the importance of SAIC filings because doing so serves their purposes.'


Still, many do not trust the idea that the Chinese numbers should reconcile with the US
numbers. Fortunately, China-Biotics is not dealing with hair-splitting criticisms at this point.
The company is either a fraud or it is not. We can restrict our attention to cash. A bank
balance is a bank balance and numbers are a universal language. A comparison of the
filings, with English translations, can be found here.


4. Noted Chinese forensic accountant, Zheng Zhaohui, doubts the company's cash
balance and its tax claims. His nickname is Xia Cao, which translates into english as
"Summer Grass." He is an author of several books and articles on detecting financial
scams.


He concluded:

This confirms that the Company’s bank cash balances still mismatch its cash
balances on its own balance sheet. In fact, the most common technique used by
Chinese company listed overseas to inflate its assets is to inflate its cash balances.
It’s extremely easy to fabricate bank statements and bank letters, especially the
'corporate fixed term bank deposit certificate'. 
Overall, the author believes CHBT is involved in fabricating its five years of reported
profits, causing massive tax liabilities, and also massively inflated cash balances as
a result.

5. An investigative news reporter in China picked up Xia Cao's lead and wrote a widely
distributed news article.

A manager responsible [for] administrative matters by the last name of Li was
surprised by the over 100 store[s]. ‘From what I know, we don’t have that many
stores’, he said.


Tesco stated to us they used to carry some probiotics by Shining, but the sales
volume was too low and therefore stopped taking delivery from the company in July
2010. Tesco recently took a small delivery of the product.


[People] at the headquarters marketing department of Danisco China located in
Guangzhou stated that compared to Danisco, the amount of probiotics that Shining
(CHBT) provides to dairy companies is miniscule. Also, the above mentioned
marketing person expressed that he could not possibly understand how CHBT could
sell over 80 million USD probiotics products.


But a journalist at our newspaper got the response from Mengniu : 'Shining or CHBT
is not our supplier, we purchase from the two biggest manufacturers in the world,
Danisco and Hansen.' Also, people at Bright Dairy stated that they do not know
about the company because Bright Dairy mostly use its own probiotics.


In a Lianhua Supermarket on Xinzha Road, the journalist saw Shining protein
probiotics on the shelf, but the manufacturing date was January 2nd, 2010, over a
year from the date of visit. The shelf employee said: ‘almost no one buys this
product.’

Some of these issues are relatively recent; others were brought to light last summer.
Whether this is "old news" or new information, depends upon the reader's perspective.
The accusation that short sellers and news reporters are "beating a dead horse" seems to
have adequately substituted for a rebuttal. We begin to wonder if validity doesn't die with
age.


Hmm. Just after takeoff the tower radios a pilot. His landing gear has fallen off. He is in a
sweat and shaking for about three hours, after which he grows calm again.


Co-pilot: What are we going to do?  
Pilot: About what?

Understanding SAIC and SEC Filing Discrepancies for U.S. 
Listed China Based Companies – Avoid Being the Victim of 
Stock Short Sellers 
By Mr. Benjamin Wey 
President of New York Global Group 
Visiting Professor of Finance 
Recently, some investors interested in investing in U.S. listed China based companies 
have expressed concerns over discrepancies often found in the financial statements 
between certain Chinese companies’ State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
(SAIC) filings in China and their U.S. SEC filings. Investors often quickly conclude that 
a company’s underlying operating entities in China must be fraudulent in inflating sales 
and earnings, and that their SEC filings in the U.S. may not be relied upon for accuracy. 
On the contrary, it is highly unusual and it should cause real concerns to investors if 
SAIC filings DO match a public company’s SEC filings. Investors may lack basic 
understanding of China’s corporate registration processes and therefore are comparing 
very different items. It is important to understand why it would be incorrect and ignorant 
to allege companies as frauds based on SAIC documents. 
Based on New York Global Group’s 13 year office presence in China as well as our 
in-depth understanding of the Chinese business practices, culture, and language, any 
concerns over SAIC and SEC filing discrepancies are overblown and unnecessary. This 
article intends to alleviate those concerns based on facts and our extensive knowledge of 
China. 
Background: Stock short sellers intentionally created the SAIC and other “China 
concerns” in order to scare investors and put undue pressure on stock exchange 
regulators who diligently maintain the integrity of the U.S. financial markets 
Stock short sellers have originated and are behind such accusations related to China 
based companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. One loud mouth on the opposite side of 
the investing public’s interest is a guy by the name of Manuel P. Asensio and his 
asensio.com, an admitted short seller. Manuel Asensio is a balding Cuban immigrant,

deeply frustrated and hostile towards FINRA and the SEC regulations. He credits himself 
as the “Godfather” of stock short seller in America. Research shows Asensio lives in a 
“shadow”. On his website, he provides no contact information and he maintains a long

his website and neither could he confirm the publisher of those negative articles and lies

Author’s reply »  tjcfool,


What you quote above is from a press release and/or company document written by Benjamin Wey himself.


www.nyggroup.com/libra... 
www.prnewswire.com/new...


In the press release, "Manuel Asensio is a balding Cuban immigrant, deeply frustrated and hostile ..."


There is a long standing feud between Mr. Wey and Mr. Asensio.


See the article, "Small Cast Stars in China Reverse Mergers." Mr. Wey is prominent in this article.
www.thestreet.com/stor...


In a Bloomberg/Businessweek article we find Mr. Wey again listed as a key player in the China RTO universe,
"In 2007, the American Stock Exchange delisted a fertilizer company that he brought over, Bodisen Biotech
Inc., for incomplete and inaccurate disclosures related to share ownership by officers as well as payments to
Wey’s company. The move came after stories in the New York Post and MarketWatch. Wey blames
journalists in league with short sellers.


"The Oklahoma Department of Securities censured Wey in 2005 for not advising customers of the risks of
stocks he sold and not disclosing consulting relationships with some of the companies. Wey agreed to a ban
on working in the securities business in the state without admitting to the allegations."
noir.bloomberg.com/app... 
"Texas Short Seller Fights China Fraud in $20 Billion U.S. Shares" 
"Worthless Stocks from China" 
www.businessweek.com/m...


In his own press release, Mr. Wey proclaims himself an expert. If you take that at face value, then read his
message carefully. He says (in the part excluded from your comment): 
"Until all of a holding company’s subsidiaries are consolidated into one financial statement, simply by adding

up the financials of each subsidiary does not equate to the financials filed by the holding company,
represented as an entire organization through its SEC filings"


If you read this carefully, Mr. Wey himself suggests that the important point is to make sure that you have the
data for each subsidiary and that these numbers are consolidated -- which is just basic common sense. Cash
is cash and math is math. Numbers do not "change rules" when we cross a border ... nor if we should
suddenly find ourselves communicating with aliens. If the respective filings -- consolidated -- do not match,
then an explanation should be provided by the company. Differences in cash of some 90% or more are not
minor discrepancies.

What if you know there is an auditor who has checked that the airplane really has a landing gear? 
And the call from the tower was only a sick joke by his buddy... 
Would you still purchase a short position?

Author’s reply »  There are two auditors. One of them is QINGDAO ZHENQING CERTIFIED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS, in Shanghai. See their audit here:seekingalpha.com/artic...


The other is BDO Limited, who changed their name after a merger. 
"BDO McCabe Lo Limited, the BDO Member Firm in Hong Kong, has announced its successful conclusion of
an agreement to merge the firm, Shu Lun Pan Horwath Hong Kong CPA Limited into the existing firm, with
effect from 1 May 2009. The merged firm will change its name to BDO Limited."

Today CHBT claims some 132 million cash.


They are audited by the same group who audited CXTI.

I am tired of these SAIC, SAT, SEC reconciliation issues to scare investors. The best response I have read to this was
from someone who stated in the USA, Dunn & Bradstreet (D&B) reports seldom if ever reconcile with audited
finacials. This scare tactic worked at the begining, but future "shorts" will have to be more creative and come up with a
new "tactic". If a major auditor has verified the income statement and balance sheet thoroughly and accurately, I
personally don't care about the SAIC or SAT financials. Who said they are supposed to reconcile ?

If you were a Chinese National, would you mislead the SEC, with no enforcement powers in China, or
mislead the SAT? The latter will send you to Jail and harvest Your Liver - or maybe kill you - as an example to
other tax cheats... while the former, at worst, will nix your stock scam.

A well known investor has contacted the SEC about the fraud Muddy Waters is potentially committing making these
claims about CCME. Appears they may have forged documents and its my opinion when the SEC investigates this
could blow the doors off the short fraud thats been happening. Its all fair game with the SEC is involved. I wouldn't be
suprised if several people spreading false lies, posting articles to take down the stock price, and the people making
options trades to cash in on this hit pieces to be investigated and taken down. This is where my interest is these days.
I don't know how you guys can get away with this when its clear illegal activity is going on.

The shorts don't care what issue is raised as long as it results in the price dropping. With chbt they grabbed an actual
issue, low interest on a huge cash balance as part of the smokescreen. I think that chbt is a terrific stock but mgmt is
certainly asleep on the interest issue and I am not sure why. The auditor issue is raised but it is also raised with ccme
and they have a big 4 auditor. 
Jason Nevader has issued extremely accurate info on chbt, perhaps he can talk to the Chmn and get a good answer
on the interest. I know that chbt will be expanding again beyond phase 2 and Yangling and that one day they will be a
noted supplier in China and my stock will be worth many times its current value.

Where is our Jason shillboy? And that Sean is MIA too.


It is possible that one day they will be a notable supplier of something in China, but the expose in the First
Financial Daily revealed that their business in China recently is virtually undetectable. The reporter who
produced that article gave the company an opportunity to respond to that finding and Eva Yan essentially
admitted that the company's customers are largely figments of the company's imagination. You might want to
get a good translation of that article and actually read it. Or not. It's your money.

Where is Jason the Evader and his sidekick, Sean Shillboy Wright? Aren't you just a little bit worried that their
prolific touting of this POS has STOPPED since the expose in the First Financial Daily of China that found
CHBT's business to be virtually undetectable? Come on, speak up. Or shut up.

At some point you have to just throw up your hands and wonder..."Are these people genuinely this oblivious?"


How delusional must one become before it makes sense to disregard a thoroughly professional business article
written by China's leading business publication. You don't speak the language, you don't know a thing about the
company other than what they told you, but "I am right. The professionals in China are wrong."

I think that newspaper article is an interesting read (assuming it is for real itself), but inconclusive. It could just
as easily be all ado about nothing. And so there's insufficient information to justify a short position.


10 Feb 2011, 06:41 PM


RossLinehan
OK, but what about LONG?


Which is where the discussion began.


WHERE is there ANY basis for LONG position on this CLEARLY problematic, stinker stock?


Want to invest? Cool! Find a good investment, which is NOT this stinker stock.


Move on!


10 Feb 2011, 08:06 PM


RossLinehan
Indeed they are, as EJ1962 demonstrates.


And they're not just that, they INSIST on it AND on proclaiming that fact far and wide, as if that were their
constitutional right.


What to do?


Short the stinker stocks they tout and take their money.


It's like taking candy from babies (sigh, sorry to say).


THAT's what they want and won't stop 'til they accomplish that.


Which is why they read the shrill shills and tag-team touts of the likes of dear 'ol Sean Wright and Jason
Nevader.


They WANT to get fleeced!


"There's a buyer for every seller," I've once heard, which is who dear 'ol Sean and Jason are all about.


If they didn't exist, someone else would take their place.


And they occur precisely because of the likes of EJ1962, who INSISTS on getting fleeced.


Let him/her!

China-Biotics, Inc. (the “Company”) was unable to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended
December 31, 2010 (the “Form 10-Q”) within the prescribed time period. Due to the long Chinese New Year holiday,
the Company faced unexpected scheduling delays of key accounting and financial staff, and the Company was
unable to finalize the treatment of certain accounting items prior to the filing deadline for the Form 10-Q. The
resolution of these accounting items is not expected to have a material impact, if any, on the quarterly unaudited
financial results as released in the Company’s earnings announcement on Wednesday, February 9, 2011.


The Company will file the Form 10-Q as soon as practicable after it is finalized, which the Company expects to be no
later than Monday, February 14, 2011.

Nothing new, they allready said that when they published the unaudited results. This proofs once again that they're
not a fraud, otherwise the 10-Q would have been filed several days ago, as not to draw any suspicion on them!

Matt, nice butcher job again on another Chinese small cap stock!I In regards to point 4 of your thesis. XiaCao is
nothing more than an internet blogger/small time author. He is paid by the likes of muddy waters and citron to put their
BS into Chinese and then make it look like he has done the research and that the short sellers use it to back up their
lame and fictitious theories. He is neither a noted financial scholar or analyst as you try to present him as! Also, check
out CHBT's latest fillings with the SEC!


10 Feb 2011, 07:21 PM

WOW!


And note ALL the comments censored!


WHO is doing that and why?


"fillings" are for dentists, not investors, so clueless this comment is.


Keep this comment but delete the rest.

The SEC will be at your front door soon. You will not scare investors away from a good company like CHBT. You
shorts will lose your shorts very soon. good luck!


10 Feb 2011, 09:13 PM

Not MY door.


I am short nothing, including CHBT, which is anything but "good."


And it is you who will lose your shorts -- as you already have.


Indeed, you insist on it!

From the 2Q2011 press release:


"... the Company repurchased 219,800 shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of $2,739,634 during the
second quarter ended September 30, 2010."


I´m no expert in SEC workings but I would imagine it to be difficult to fake repurchase of stock. What is the opinion of
the short side on this matter, is it 'fraudable'?


11 Feb 2011, 11:15 AM


Waldo Mushman
This is from memory so likely incorrect, but....The price they paid per share was at a price the stock traded in
the open market for maybe 10 minutes. During the Q share count went up rather than down indicating an
issuance on new shares, probably to insiders, who likely received the money spent on buybacks.


The share purchases by the company are a virtual certainty. Transfer agents have to open the ownership
ledgers to the auditors and the regulators here in the US so there isn't much sneak space. The question
would be who got paid and was the price they received appropriate.

If the issue re any stock be fake and fraud, the answer is to STAY AWAY.


Whether one is long or short has nothing to do with the issue.


STAY AWAY from this stock, which is fraud, up, down, left, right.


If you want to invest, great. THIS is NOT the stock to try.

R-D.
Ioannis Misopoulos, the Director General of the International Probiotics Associates, writes the following regarding
China-Biotics:


"Regarding a company joining our organization, we have strict rules, they first have to abide by the voluntary quality
guidelines that all our manufacturers follow, we look at their products and websites to make sure they follow the
proper nomenclature, they have to read and understand our organization’s policies on antitrust and disputes and we
then give them the green light. We also do plant visits to make sure the companies are legitimate (I was in Shanghai
in Nov 2008) and


I can ensure you they have some impressive facilities with very big productions sites.


I totally understand your concerns as an investor in these turbulent times, but China-Biotics is a pretty solid company."

What he means is they pay their dues. The Chinese equivalent of our Wall Street Journal did an investigation
of CHBT and found they lied about some big customers and that their presence in the China probiotics
market is virtually undetectable. Go to Yahoo MB for CHBT and look at the posts of necm500. You will see
that he used to be a rabid long, but when he read the report in the First Financial Daily, he changed his
position. He explains the whole thing for you. But don't let reality discourage you R-D. Keep the faith. Don't let
go of that bag.


13 Feb 2011, 12:19 PM


RossLinehan
Exactly.


And that article actually is referenced and linked in Issue 5 raised in the article above.


And it, together with the Xiacao article referenced and linked in Issue 4, pretty much nail the CHBT coffin shut.


Obviously, R-D didn’t read the above article and is concerned only with denying its message.


The siren song of Quick, Easy Buck evidently deafens as well as stupefies those whose ears it assails.


Just as pied pipers Sean Wright and Jason Nevader lead their followers to their doom.

“A fool and his money are soon parted.”


“There’s one born every minute.”


“If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”


“Common sense” keeps arising as an issue because it isn’t common.


Without the likes of R-D, Sean and Jason would have no followers to dupe or black magic to work.

Sean and Jason are not leading their followers anymore. Those boys have gone MIA. Their barrage of BUY
CHBT, STOCK OF THE CENTURY "articles" has ceased, since the First Financial Daily expose. The pump is
over. I wonder if their little cabal still owns 20% of the float. I wonder if we will ever see Sean/Jason on
SeekingAlpha again. Their Kool Aid drinkers miss them.

Indeed.


However, I see you've discovered the new post on this site.

It's rather like the dog that didn't bark in the night.

Maybe it's the names that have changed?
