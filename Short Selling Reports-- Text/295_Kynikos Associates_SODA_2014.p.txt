Jim Chanos: Best shorts in a

Renowned short-seller Jim Chanos said Thursday he'd continue to bet
against Caterpillar and China.


Speaking from the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas,
Nevada, the Kynikos Associates founder revealed his theses behind
selling short several high-profile stocks on CNBC's "Halftime Report."


"I think people are generally of a belief that this is a North American
construction play. It's 15 percent of their business," he said. "Maybe it's
an oil and gas play. Caterpillar is a very diverse company. A big part of
their profits are in mining, which continues to decline. The stock is
trading above a market multiple for a cyclical company, where even the
management has said they think trough earnings could be $3.50. We
don't get it."

Chanos, who has said considered his Caterpillar short his best
investment idea of 2013, also noted that the value of mined
commodities, such as coal and iron, keep dropping.


China, which has been another favored short for Chanos, was also
looking up from a short perspective because of its crackdown on
corruption. Most recently, a GlaxoSmithKline executive was charged
with bribing hospitals and doctors.


"And the two areas that I think are feeling it right now are luxury goods
and real estate. It's one of the reasons real estate transactions have
collapsed in China this year," he said. "The next two are flight capital in
terms of foreign real estate and art—Sotheby's—and Macau. We're
getting increasingly concerned that a crackdown's looming in Macau."


Chanos, who was speaking from the Bellagio Hotel, demurred when
asked to expand on his comments.

"No comment on what we're shorting in Macau. I'm sitting in a casino if
you haven't noticed," he said, adding that he was "worried" that U.S.
operators were facing real risks from the corruption crackdown.


"We were long corruption, short property in 2010-11," Chanos said. "We
would no longer be long the Macau casinos."


In a week that saw record prices at a Christie's contemporary art
auction— including the sale of "Popeye," a six-and-a-half-foot-tall Jeff
Koons sculpture to casino magnate Steve Wynn for $28.1 million—
Chanos saw a clear sign.


"Usually, when the art market starts to get silly, it's time to be out of
Sotheby's," he said.

5/21/2018 Jim Chanos: Best shorts in a bull market


https://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/15/jim-chanos-best-shorts-in-a-bull-market.html 3/6


Chanos downplayed the proxy fight between Sotheby's and Third
Point's Dan Loeb, who gained three seats on the company's board and
upped his stake to 15 percent. "You can get too wrapped up in
personalities and not the actual fundamentals of the company," he said.
"What really concerns us is that an awful lot of the action right now is
not in artists who are dead, to be blunt. It's in young artists who are still
producing a lot of art, and at these prices will produce even more of it."


Chanos also took a short position in Valeant, which has made an
unsolicited bid for Botox makerAllergan, in which Chanos has a long
position.


"We're short because it's a roll-up, and roll-ups a unique set of
problems," he said. "Roll-ups are generally accounting-driven, and we
certainly think that's the case in Valeant. We think that Valeant is
playing some very aggressive accounting games when they buy
companies, write down the assets. … And finally, the only people who
are more negative about Valeant than maybe me are Valeant insiders."


Chanos noted that six executives have left in the past 15 months, as well
as selling by insiders, including the executive vice-president of
corporate and business development.


"I mean, there seems to be not a lot of confidence from inside the
Valeant executive suite here," he said. "And that's putting aside the
deal dynamics, which is a whole separate story."


Chanos said his short position had little to do with pressure from
Allergan shareholder Bill Ackman of Pershing Square to accept
Valeant's acquisition bid.


Chanos was also short Keurig Green Mountain and SodaStreamSoda , while
being long Starbucks.


"Basically, Green Mountain's core business has been slowing for a
while," he said. "They had to do a transformational deal. They've done

it. I'm not so sure that single-serve cold products are the next wave. I
mean, I have carbonated, single-serve cold beverages in my
refrigerator, in cans."


Chanos said that insider selling provided support to his reasoning.


"We are seeing a ton of Green Mountain insiders in the last two months
unloading stock, the majority of their stock, in many cases," he said.
"The head of U.S. marketing just sold a majority of their stock this
week. And so, again, you don't have to listen to a short-seller. Look at
the executive suite."


Chanos, who had been long FireEye and short Symantec — and profited
from both trades, noted that valuations set on small floats were difficult
to maintain.


Meanwhile, stocks such as those of Tesla and Netflix were a different
story.


"I think both of those are instances where the floats are probably going
to continue to increase," Chanos said. "Suffice it to say, I think any stock
that is trading in the tens of billions of dollars and being valued on
2020 estimates is pretty much on our radar, and I'll leave it at that."
