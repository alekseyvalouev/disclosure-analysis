Tellurian	Stock	To	Decline	Following	Issuance	Of	Over	190	Million	New
Shares
Feb.	14,	2017	7:30	AM	ET38	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


Summary


Tellurian	finalized	its	reverse	merger	with	Magellan	Petroleum	on	February	10.


The	company’s	share	count	increased	from	under	6	million	shares	to	over	199
million	shares,	with	old	Magellan	shareholders	owning	only	about	3%	of	the
combined	company.


Tellurian	is	wildly	overvalued	compared	to	capital	raisings	completed	in	late	2016,
especially	given	the	lack	of	material	news	since	those	share	sales.


The	combined	company	expects	to	earn	no	revenue	until	2022,	and	needs	to	raise
between	$13.0	billion	and	$15.6	billion	in	order	for	its	LNG	project	to	proceed.


Reverse	merger	background


On	February	10,	Tellurian	(NASDAQ:TELL)	announced	that	it	had	closed	its	merger	with
Magellan	Petroleum	(former	stock	symbol	MPET).	February	9	was	the	last	day	of	trading
under	the	old	MPET	symbol,	and	on	February	10,	Tellurian	continued	trading	under	the
symbol	TELL.


Under	the	terms	of	the	merger,	as	described	in	the	prospectus	filed	on	January	13,	each
share	of	Tellurian	Investments	shareholders	was	converted	into	1.30	Magellan	Petroleum
shares.	The	merged	company	then	changed	its	name	to	Tellurian	Inc.


Market	capitalization


In	an	SEC	filing	on	February	10,	Tellurian	stated	that	it	had	199,382,948	shares
outstanding.


At	the	time	of	writing,	Magellan	last	traded	at	$14.03.


This	gives	a	market	capitalization	of	$2,797,342,760	($14.03	*	199,382,948),	or
approximately	$2.79	billion.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares 2/9


Valuation	-	company	discussions	in	early	July	2016


Starting	at	page	78	of	the	prospectus,	Magellan	revealed	some	useful	information	about
the	events	leading	up	to	the	merger	announcement.


On	page	82,	it	stated	that


·	between	July	7	and	July	9,	2016,	Magellan's	financial	advisor	"negotiated	with	Tellurian
Investments	the	exchange	ratio	representing	the	number	of	shares	of	Magellan	common
stock	that	would	be	issued	to	Tellurian	Investments	stockholders	per	issued	and
outstanding	share	of	Tellurian	Investments	common	stock,	and	tentatively	agreed	that	the
exchange	ratio	would	be	1.300."


·	"This	ratio	was	based	on	Tellurian	Investments'	view	that	the	fair	value	of	Magellan's
assets	was	between	$10	million	and	$15	million,	which	Magellan	viewed	as
reasonable,	and	Magellan's	view	that	the	fair	value	of	Tellurian	Investments'	business
was	between	$200	million	and	$300	million,	which	Tellurian	Investments	viewed	as
reasonable."	(emphasis	added)


·	"Based	on	approximately	90	million	shares	of	Tellurian	Investments	common	stock	then
outstanding,	these	values	for	Tellurian	Investments	implied	a	per	share	value	of	$2.22	to
$3.33	per	Tellurian	Investments	share.	Based	on	approximately	5.9	million	shares	of
Magellan	common	stock	then	outstanding,	these	values	for	Magellan	implied	a	per	share
value	of	$1.70	to	$2.54	per	Magellan	share."	(emphasis	added)


·	"Comparing	the	low	and	the	high	end	of	the	range	for	each	company	to	the
corresponding	portion	of	the	range	for	the	other	company	yielded	a	relationship	of
approximately	1.3	shares	of	Magellan	common	stock	for	each	share	of	Tellurian
Investments	common	stock."


If	Tellurian	Investments	thought	the	1.30	ratio	undervalued	the	(pre-merger)
company,	then	it	could	have	either	negotiated	a	higher	ratio,	or	filed	for	an	IPO	and
gone	public	in	a	more	traditional	manner.	However,	it	willingly	accepted	this	ratio
and	proceeded	with	the	merger.


The	last	traded	price	for	Magellan	of	$14.03	is	more	than	452%	higher	than	$2.54,	the
highest	share	price	discussed	in	early	July	2016,	and	characterized	as	being	the	"fair
value"	for	Magellan.


Valuation	based	on	GE	Oil	and	Gas	share	sale	(November	2016)
7/19/2019 Tellurian Stock To Decline Following Issuance Of Over 190 Million New Shares - Tellurian Inc. (NASDAQ:TELL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares 3/9


On	November	28,	2016,	Tellurian	announced	that	GE	Oil	and	Gas	made	a	$25	million
investment	in	the	company.	In	the	SEC	filing,	Tellurian	stated	that	the	investment	"has	an
implied	Tellurian	Investment	Inc.	Common	Stock	value	of	$5.94	per	share."


In	a	separate	SEC	filing	on	November	29,	Tellurian	stated	that


it	sold	5,467,851	shares	of	convertible	preferred	stock	for	$25	million.
Following	the	merger,	"holders	of	the	Tellurian	preferred	shares	may	convert	all	of	such
shares	for	shares	of	Magellan	common	stock	on	a	one-for-one	basis"
"Alternatively,	following	the	Merger,	holders	of	the	Tellurian	Preferred	Shares	may
convert	or	exchange	all	of	such	shares	for	Magellan	Preferred	Shares	on	a	one-for-
one	basis."
The	shares	will	automatically	convert	into	shares	of	Magellan	common	stock	(if	not
already	converted)	on	November	23,	2022.


The	price	per	preferred	share	was	$4.57	(25	million	/	5,467,851),	and	these	shares	will	be
converted	into	Magellan	common	shares	before	the	end	of	2022.


Tellurian	stated	that	the	investment	had	an	implied	common	stock	value	of	$5.94	per
share,	which	matches	the	implied	Magellan	common	stock	value	of	$4.57	per	share.
($5.94	per	Tellurian	common	share	/	1.30	merger	ratio	=	$4.57	per	Magellan	common
share).


The	last	traded	price	for	Magellan	of	$14.03	is	more	than	207%	higher	than	$4.57	at	which
GE	Oil	and	Gas	made	its	investment.


Valuation	based	Total	share	sale	(December	2016)


On	December	20,	2016,	Tellurian	announced	another	capital	raising.


In	the	company's	press	release,	it	stated	that	"Total	is	acquiring	approximately	23%	of
Tellurian	at	$5.85	per	share	for	an	amount	of	207	million	dollars."


In	a	separate	SEC	filing	on	December	21,	Tellurian	confirmed	that	it	sold	35,384,615
shares	at	$5.85	for	an	aggregate	purchase	price	of	$206,999,997.75.


Using	the	merger	ratio	of	1.30,	we	can	calculate	the	equivalent	share	price	of	Magellan	for
this	transaction	as	$4.50.	($5.85	per	Tellurian	share	/	1.30	=	$4.50	per	Magellan	share).


The	MPET	price	of	$4.50	is	substantially	similar	to	the	$4.57	price	of	the	GE	Oil	and	Gas
transaction	from	late	November.

7/19/2019 Tellurian Stock To Decline Following Issuance Of Over 190 Million New Shares - Tellurian Inc. (NASDAQ:TELL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares 4/9


The	last	traded	price	for	Magellan	of	$14.03	is	more	than	211%	higher	than	$4.50	at	which
Total	SA	(NYSE:TOT)	made	its	investment.


Analysis	-	balance	sheet


On	February	8,	Magellan	filed	its	10-Q	for	the	quarter	ending	December	31,	2016.


Its	balance	sheet	as	at	December	31,	2016,	reveals	the	following:


Assets	$5.02	million


Liabilities	$3.05	million


Stockholders'	equity	$1.97	million


The	most	recent	balance	sheet	for	Tellurian	Investments	is	in	the	prospectus,	providing	a
statement	of	position	as	at	September	30,	2016.	It	is	important	to	note	that	this	date	was
before	the	investments	made	by	Total	and	GE	Oil	and	Gas.


As	at	September	30,	2016,	Tellurian	Investments'	financial	position	was:


Assets	$35.7	million


Liabilities	$20.9	million


Stockholders'	equity	$14.7	million


Post-merger	strategy


As	shown	above,	before	consummation	of	the	merger,	Magellan	Petroleum	had
stockholders'	equity	of	less	than	$2	million.	There	were	fewer	than	6	million	Magellan
shares	outstanding	when	the	prospectus	was	filed,	which	represents	less	than	3%	of	the
199,382,948	shares	outstanding	as	at	February	10.


It	is	reasonable	to	conclude	that	the	main	purpose	of	the	merger	was	to	facilitate	a	public
listing	for	Tellurian.	Although	the	(pre-merger)	Tellurian	had	a	stockholders'	equity	of	only
$14.7	million	as	at	September	30,	it	plans	to	construct	an	LNG	project	("Driftwood	LNG
Project")	in	Louisiana.


Tellurian	has	provided	some	indicative	time	frames	for	this	project.	It	expects	to
commence	construction	in	2018	and	does	not	expect	to	earn	any	revenue	until	2022
(page	92	of	prospectus).

7/19/2019 Tellurian Stock To Decline Following Issuance Of Over 190 Million New Shares - Tellurian Inc. (NASDAQ:TELL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares 5/9


The	financial	statements	for	both	Magellan	and	Tellurian	Investments	for	2016	reveal	that
neither	entity	earned	any	operating	revenue.


Of	greatest	relevance	to	shareholders	is	the	analysis	performed	by	Magellan's	financial
advisor,	Petrie	Partners,	which	commences	on	page	87	of	the	prospectus.


Petrie	Partners	concluded	(on	page	93)	that	it	calculated	a	valuation	of	between	$2.25	to
$5.25	per	share	of	Tellurian	Investments	common	stock.	Using	the	1.30	share	ratio	from
the	merger	agreement,	this	equates	to	a	valuation	range	of	$1.73	($2.25	/	1.30)	to	$4.04
($5.25	/	1.30)	per	share	of	the	merged	company.


On	page	93	of	the	prospectus	we	are	also	provided	with	Tellurian	Investments	projected
revenue	and	EBITDA	for	the	period	from	2016	to	2025.	Although	we	can	see	that	the
company	expects	to	start	earning	revenue	in	2022	(a	full	five	years	from	now),	the
company	will	incur	significant	construction	expenses	before	that	time.	Furthermore,	by
definition,	the	projected	EBITDA	figures	exclude	significant	expenses	in	the	form	of
interest,	depreciation	and	tax.


Tellurian	has	stated	that	its	estimate	for	construction	costs	for	the	Driftwood	LNG	Project
will	be	between	$13.0	billion	and	$15.6	billion,	and	in	order	for	the	company	to	raise	this
massive	amount	of	capital,	it	will	need	to	conduct	dilutive	share	sales,	and/or	borrow
interest-bearing	debt	-	both	of	which	would	reduce	potential	shareholder	returns.


As	Tellurian	noted	on	page	53	of	the	prospectus:


Tellurian	Investments	will	be	required	to	seek	additional	debt	and	equity	financing	in
the	future	to	complete	the	Driftwood	LNG	Project,	and	may	not	be	able	to	secure
such	financing	on	acceptable	terms,	or	at	all."


The	prospectus	contains	a	long	list	of	the	risks	that	Tellurian	faces,	commencing	on	page
32.


Given	there	are	large	number	of	significant	variables	involved	in	Tellurian's	future
operations,	it	is	difficult	for	the	author	to	conduct	a	net	present	value	analysis	of	the
company's	future	cash	flows.


Halcon	Resources	precedent	from	2012	-	another	overvalued	"cash	box"


Tellurian's	situation	is	similar	to	Halcon	Resources'	in	2012.	On	February	3,	2012,	we
wrote	an	article	about	Halcon,	whose	shares	had	risen	to	$11.46	($3.82	before	1	for	3
reverse	split),	compared	to	its	capital	raisings	at	$3.75	and	$4.50	($1.25	and	$1.50	pre-

split).	At	the	time,	we	questioned	why	the	shares	were	trading	so	high	when	the
company's	main	assets	were	the	cash	raised	as	part	of	the	transaction.


In	the	weeks,	months	and	years	following	the	publication	of	that	article,	the	company's
shares	declined,	and	finally	the	company	announced	a	comprehensive	restructuring	on
May	18,	2016,	which	saw	its	shareholders	diluted	by	96%.	The	shares	closed	at	$0.30	on
May	19,	2016,	less	than	10%	of	the	capital	raising	prices	($3.75	and	above)	in	2012.


Of	more	relevance	is	that	on	March	1,	2012,	Halcon	announced	that	it	had	priced	the	sale
of	$400	million	of	preferred	stock	at	$9.00,	a	price	over	21%	lower	than	the	$11.46	level
from	the	time	we	wrote	the	aforementioned	article.


In	addition	to	Halcon's	$400	million	share	sale,	on	September	12,	2012,	a	large
shareholder	priced	a	sale	of	35	million	shares	at	$7.00	per	share,	noticeably	lower	than
both	the	$11.46	level	it	was	at	in	early	February	that	year,	and	the	$9.00	at	which	Halcon
sold	additional	shares.


To	be	clear,	we	do	not	expect	Tellurian	to	require	a	restructuring	like	Halcon,	however,	it
would	be	reasonable	to	expect	that	Tellurian	will	want	to	sell	additional	shares	to	fund	its
multi-billion-dollar	capital	expenditure	requirements.	Likewise,	Tellurian	shareholders	will
likely	be	eager	to	sell	their	shares	now	that	the	merger	has	been	completed,	just	as
Halcon's	shareholders	did	following	the	completion	of	that	company's	capital	raisings.


On	that	score,	Tellurian	made	three	filings	after	the	close	of	trading	on	February	10.


The	first	filing	was	an	S-8,	advising	that	shareholders	approved	the	issuance	of	40	million
new	shares	as	part	of	the	company's	"Omnibus	Incentive	Compensation	Plan."	If	the
entire	40	million	shares	were	issued,	this	would	see	current	Tellurian	shareholders	owning
about	84%	of	the	company,	with	the	40	million	shares	representing	the	remaining	16%.


Sale	of	shares	by	Tellurian	and	new	Tellurian	shareholders


Of	more	interest	were	two	separate	S-3ASR	filings.


The	first,	filed	at	5.10pm,	was	for	a	shelf	registration	of	common	stock,	preferred	stock,
warrants	and	units.


The	second,	filed	at	5.15pm,	was	to	register	500,150	shares	by	selling	stockholders.	Most
of	these	shares	are	owned	by	Petrie	Partners	(409,800	shares),	which	advised	Tellurian
on	the	merger.	It	is	worthwhile	to	note	that	on	August	2,	2016,	the	day	before	the	merger
announcement,	Magellan	shares	closed	at	$1.20.	At	the	close	on	August	3,	2016,	the	day

of	the	merger	announcement,	Magellan	shares	closed	at	$2.50.	It	should	be	clear	that
Petrie	(like	many	new	Tellurian	shareholders)	is	sitting	on	massive	unrealized	profits,	and
it	is	highly	likely	it	will	sell	some	or	even	all	of	its	shares	while	it	remains	at	such	elevated
levels.	In	Petrie's	case,	its	stake	was	worth	$491,760	on	the	day	before	the	merger,
$1,024,500	on	the	day	the	merger	was	announced,	and	at	Friday's	close,	had	ballooned	to
$5,749,494,	more	than	11	times	its	value	before	the	merger	was	announced!


GE	Oil	and	Gas,	Total	SA	and	Floyd	Wilson


Investors	in	Tellurian	may	feel	confident	in	the	company,	given	the	investments	made	by
GE	Oil	and	Gas	and	Total	SA.


A	similar	line	of	thinking	was	used	as	criticism	for	our	bearish	thesis	on	Halcon	in	February
2012.	One	comment	in	response	to	our	Halcon	article	pointed	out	that	Floyd	Wilson
(Halcon's	CEO)	had	considerable	success	with	Petrohawk	Energy,	and	expected	the
same	for	Halcon.	As	history	shows,	Halcon's	share	price	declined	materially	in	the	years
under	his	leadership,	and	as	discussed	earlier,	the	company	announced	a	highly	dilutive
restructuring	last	year.


We	mention	this	because	the	existence	of	a	well-known	investor	is	not	a	sufficient
condition	for	making	an	investment	in	a	company.	Just	as	investors	who	bought	Halcon	at
$11.46	were	disappointed	in	the	ensuing	weeks	and	months,	we	also	believe	that
investors	who	are	buying	Tellurian	at	Friday's	level	of	$14.03	will	be	disappointed	in	the
weeks	and	months	to	come.


Valuation	of	the	combined	company	after	merger	completion


As	discussed	above,	it	is	difficult	to	calculate	a	valuation	based	on	the	net	present	value	of
the	merged	entity's	future	cash	flows	and/or	profits.	Instead,	we	propose	two	different
calculations	based	on	the	information	discussed	earlier	in	this	article.


Calculation	based	on	combination	of	valuations	in	July	plus	$232	million	cash
raised:


The	valuation	range	discussed	by	the	two	companies	in	early	July	2016	was	a	range	of
$210	million	($200	million	for	Tellurian	+	$10	million	for	Magellan)	to	$315	million	($300
million	+	$15	million).


We	can	add	to	this	the	$25	million	raised	from	the	GE	Oil	and	Gas	transaction,	and	also
the	$207	million	raised	from	the	Total	transaction.
7/19/2019 Tellurian Stock To Decline Following Issuance Of Over 190 Million New Shares - Tellurian Inc. (NASDAQ:TELL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4045564-tellurian-stock-decline-following-issuance-190-million-new-shares 8/9


Therefore	the	value	of	the	combined	entity	could	be	$315	million	(from	July	2016)	+	$25
million	+	$207	million	=	$547	million.


$547	million	divided	by	199,382,948	shares	=	$2.74	per	share.


Calculation	based	on	most	recent	capital	raising	in	December


The	Total	transaction	(sale	of	23%	of	Tellurian	for	$207	million)	gives	an	implied	valuation
for	Tellurian	of	$900	million.	($207	million	/	0.23	=	$900	million).


We	can	then	add	the	$15	million	valuation	for	Magellan	from	the	July	2016	valuation.


Therefore	the	total	value	of	the	merged	company	is	900	million	+	15	million	=	915	million.


$915	million	/	199,382,948	shares	=	$4.59	per	share.


This	valuation	is	substantially	similar	to	the	$4.57	paid	by	GE	Oil	and	Gas,	and	the	$4.50
paid	by	Total.


***


Tellurian	shares	are	trading	for	more	than	five	times	the	highest	valuation	considered	for
the	company	during	its	merger	discussions	in	July	2016.


They	are	more	than	triple	the	prices	paid	by	GE	Oil	and	Gas	and	Total	on	November	28
and	December	20,	the	latter	being	less	than	2	months	ago.


In	the	absence	of	positive	material	news	about	the	company,	it	is	extremely	difficult	to
justify	this	huge	increase	in	valuation,	especially	considering	Tellurian's	need	to	raise	at
least	$13.0	billion	in	order	for	the	Driftwood	project	to	proceed.


Now	that	the	merger	has	been	completed,	Tellurian's	share	count	has	increased	from
under	6	million	to	over	199	million	shares.	It	is	reasonable	to	expect	that	the	company's
share	price	should	decline	towards	$4.57,	where	the	company	received	investments	only
a	few	months	ago.	This	will	likely	happen	as	a	result	of	either	Tellurian	raising	new	capital,
sales	by	new	Tellurian	shareholders,	or	a	combination	of	both.

so	you	seem	to	imply	that	traders	who	established	short	positions	based	on	some	fundamental	speculation
haven't	been	ripped	off	in	the	open?
