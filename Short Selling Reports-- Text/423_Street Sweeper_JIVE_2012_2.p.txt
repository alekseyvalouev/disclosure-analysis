Jive Software: Current Star, Future Wallflower?

<< Return to Part 1


Talk about fancy moves. Before Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) finally stumbled a few
weeks ago, hammered by a wave of selling pressure that could dramatically escalate from
here, the bleeding social media company danced all the way from $14 to $28 a share -
virtually doubling in a brief 70-day span - without any major breakthroughs on its part. Jive
instead relied on a powerful "sympathy rally" for most of those huge gains, records
indicate, suddenly exploding to life after Facebook announced plans for an initial public
offering that temporarily shifted attention away from its own plight. (See the main story
above for a detailed review of that hyped-up rally.)


Since Jive itself went public barely five short months ago, the company faces a looming
overhang that could soon pound its richly valued shares. When Jive carried out its IPO
late last year, past news coverage reveals, the company originally released less than one-
quarter of its shares onto the public market and subjected the vast majority of its stock to
trading restrictions that will expire very soon.


Come June, records indicate, Jive could see roughly 38 million additional shares of
company stock - much of it originally priced around $5 a share or less - start pouring into
the marketplace. With Jive currently fetching almost $24 a share on the open market,
where daily trading volume averages around 500,000 shares (the equivalent of just 1.3%
of the restricted shares set for release), the stock looks rather vulnerable to say the least.


Jive actually took an early hit before its lockup period officially expired, a familiar pattern
among young Internet stocks- such as Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Groupon
(NASDAQ:GRPN) and even current standout LinkedIn (LNKD) - that enjoyed temporary
honeymoons after their celebrated public offerings last year. While Jive maintained its
stamina longer than some other newcomers to the sector, records show, the stock finally
reversed course about a month ago. Jive lost 20% of its value in the weeks that followed,
shedding much of that during a heavy two-day selling spree, with the share count in its
freely trading "float" somehow expanding (despite continued lockup restrictions) along the
way.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: Current Star, Future Wallflower? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560081-jive-software-current-star-future-wallflower 2/11


Two venture capital firms control most of that restricted stock, records indicate, with both
of them already recording massive returns on their investments at this point. Corporate
insiders sit on a mountain of cheap restricted stock as well,records show, including a CFO
who previously kept the books for a pair of young high fliers that soon collapsed and
vanished from the stock market as the result of fire sales.


Last month, as Jive itself finally weakened under the pressure of an early selling spree,
cautious investors started bracing for a serious meltdown.


"JIVE is one of the few IPOs holding up," one investor noted last month, shortly after
cutting his own stake in the company. "Gotta feeling its days are numbered."


Indeed, records show, Jive promptly tanked the very next week and has staged only a
modest comeback since that time. Now a popular target of hungry bears, records indicate,
Jive has attracted a growing crowd of short sellers - clearly aware that the lockup period
will soon end - who keep raising their bets against the stock in anticipation of an oncoming
crash.


Jive did not respond to questions for this story


Short Honeymoon


Based on recent history, that threat looks very real and the fear behind it justified as well.
Like Jive itself right now,records indicate, LinkedIn once counted Sequoia Capital among
the largest holders of its restricted shares when it began trading on the public stock
exchange. Following in the footsteps of other early LinkedIn backers who rushed to lock in
their paper gains, however, Sequoia has since gone on to sell its gigantic stake in that
social media company.


As the largest Jive shareholder of all, records indicate, Sequoia now looks poised to hit
the jackpot once again. Sequoia owns almost 17 million shares of restricted stock in the
company, or 27% of the shares outstanding, and stands to make an outright fortune on
that investment as well.


Together with a second venture capital firm, The Wall Street Journal noted last summer,
Sequoia paid barely $5 a share for a portion of its Jive stock in mid-2010 and previously
spent even less -- just $3.68 a share -- for the stock that it secured as the first major
backer of the bleeding software firm. All told, past news records indicate, Sequoia and its
financing partner Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB) provided about $100 million in
funding to Jive before the company went public and wound up with a mountain of
restricted stock - worth more than $550 million at current market prices - in return.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: Current Star, Future Wallflower? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560081-jive-software-current-star-future-wallflower 3/11


That lucky duo controls 23.6 million shares of restricted stock in the company, records
indicate, a total that practically matches the 23.7 million shares that have reached the
public market at this point. Therefore, those two firms could effectively double the existing
float - all by themselves - if they dump their valuable shares once the lockup period
officially expires.


When LinkedIn saw that fateful deadline fast approaching, The Wall Street Journal
observed last November, the company scrambled to limit the number of freely trading
shares that would flood onto the market at one time. Even with Sequoia (and other major
investors) holding onto their LinkedIn shares for an extra 90 days, however, the stock still
tumbled during the rapid sell-off that soon followed. Already trading well below its early
triple-digit highs at that point, LinkedIn lost one-quarter of its remaining value -- sinking to
an all-time low of $56 a share - the very month that its original lockup period came to an
end.


While LinkedIn has rebounded strongly since that time, staging a remarkable comeback
often viewed as wildly overblown, the company boasts several key attractions that Jive
itself now lacks. A household name for starters, LinkedIn started making money back in
2010 (clearing that particular hurdle before it ever went public), and the company looks
poised to generate much fatter profits -- while Jive faces ongoing losses -- than those that
it has already recorded on its books.


Still, with LinkedIn already trading at almost 100 times its forecasted earnings for 2013 --
and the company expected to quadruple its annual profits before that year even begins --
the stock looks priced beyond perfection based upon standard valuation tools. When The
Motley Fool recently examined the stock and found it trading at almost 900 its prior-year
earnings and 20 times its reported sales (a huge price-to-sales ratio that resembles the
hefty multiple sported by Jive itself), records show, the Fool declared LinkedIn the "most
expensive stock" that it had ever seen and hinted at the potential for a major correction in
the price.


Meanwhile, relying on a variation of the fruitless strategy that failed to protect LinkedIn
months ago, Zynga has already tried to prevent a massive selloff of its restricted shares.
In early spring, Zynga announced a secondary offering designed to "facilitate an orderly
distribution" of its restricted stock into the public marketplace. Although Zynga released
only a portion of its restricted stock at that time, with the remainder set for release the
same week that Jive will see its own lockup period expire, the shares have since fallen
25% below their secondary offering price and now threaten to revisit the record low they
briefly touched as a brand-new public company.

5/22/2018 Jive Software: Current Star, Future Wallflower? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560081-jive-software-current-star-future-wallflower 4/11


A $15 high flier back in early March (the same month that Jive set its all-time high as well),
Zynga has by now lost almost half of its peak value, with the stock resting firmly in single-
digit territory after sinking to a near-record low of barely $8 a share.


Faded Glory


Groupon paid a dear price much earlier than that. Less than three weeks after going
public (with its own restricted stock still locked up for another good five months), The New
York Times observed, Groupon fell alongside LinkedIn and swiftly lost all of its enormous
IPO gains. While Groupon clawed its way out of the teens and into the low $20s by the
time that Jive itself went public - escaping that recent hit entirely - the company followed
up with a string of disasters that dragged its shares right back down again.


Now racing toward the end of its own lockup period (helpfully delayed by a month to allow
for a scheduled earnings report), Groupon - like Zynga -- hovers just above its all-time low.


On June 1, the threat that first hammered Groupon five months earlier will finally
materialize. With restricted stockholders free to sell their shares, Forbes has cautioned,
"expect them to rush for the door at the first possible moment." Since Groupon initially
released only a tiny fraction of its shares when it went public, experts have warned, the
company could see its stock come under heavy selling pressure once again.


By then, Jive will enjoy little remaining protection of its own. Indeed, barely one week after
Groupon subjects itself to those powerful market forces, Jive must turn around and do the
same.


"There is a standard 180-day lockup, which would date the release on or around June 9,
2012," UBS dutifully reported back in January, with that threat (listed at the end of the
obligatory "Risk Analysis" section) still a safe distance away. Then "48 million shares are
expected to become available for sale, representing roughly 64% of diluted shares
outstanding."


While 10 million of those shares have apparently snuck into the public float already,
current figures suggest, Jive has yet to release at least 37.7 million of its 61.5 million
outstanding shares onto the market at this point. Sequoia and KPCB still own their
gigantic stakes in the company, records indicate, but corporate executives apparently
rushed to cash in some of their cheap shares.


The very week that Jive first began trading, records show, five officers sold almost $20
million worth of stock in their newly public company. They parted with only a small portion
of their vast holdings, however, so they still have plenty of stock left to sell. The two young

5/22/2018 Jive Software: Current Star, Future Wallflower? - Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/560081-jive-software-current-star-future-wallflower 5/11


co-founders inherited more than 6.5 million shares apiece, records show, while other
company leaders divided up a pile of cheap stock options to purchase a similar number of
shares.


Ugly Haircut


CEO Anthony Zingale collected 3.34 million of those options (more than the rest of that
group combined), records show, and exercised about one-third of them before the stock
even landed in the public's hands. He still owns more than 2 million options at this point,
however, all of them carrying strike prices of $1.75 a share or less. Right now, with Jive
trading at the high end of its impressive 52-week range, he is worth almost $70 million on
paper as a result.


Other Jive executives currently rank as paper multimillionaires, too. Take CFO Bryan
LeBlanc, for example, who took a hyped-up online retailer public during the last dot-com
boom. As a four-year "veteran" of the company, LeBlanc wound up with a nice supply of
dirt-cheap options that have already vested at this point.


LeBlanc scored 1 million stock options in all, corporate filings show, the vast majority of
them fully vested and exercisable at just 53 cents to 56 cents a share. Going forward,
those filings indicate, LeBlanc could pocket a handsome eight-figure payout of his own - if
Jive actually holds on to its enormous gains -- by cashing in those vested options (with
plenty of unvested options left over) once the lockup period comes to an end.


But Fogdog, the last Internet company that LeBlanc brought to the market, produced only
fleeting gains instead. When Fogdog went public in late 1999, past news coverage shows,
the stock briefly doubled to more than $20 a share on its opening day of trade. With
Fogdog spiraling all the way to $1 just nine months later, however, Forbes bluntly
proclaimed that the company had relied on "accounting hooey" to achieve a double-digit
stock price in the first place. Shortly after that, records show, Fogdog rushed into the arms
of a stronger rival - selling itself for a tiny fraction of its original market value - just as the
Nasdaq prepared to delist the penny stock from its respected exchange.


"Soon after Fogdog went public last year, its market value skyrocketed past $750 million,"
Dow Jones reminded at the time. "Eleven months later, Global Sports now says it will buy
the company in a deal valued at $38.4 million … Talk about a haircut."


Three years after Fogdog carried out that fire sale, its IPO made headlines once again. At
that time, records show, securities regulators filed charges against a Fogdog underwriter
for alleged violations that allowed the firm to score outsized profits on the public offering.

By then, LeBlanc had already served as the CFO of yet another newly public company
that wound up selling itself on the cheap. The year before LeBlanc took over as its finance
chief, an old Dow Jones article reveals, inSilicon enjoyed a "strong public debut" as its
brand-new stock rocketed from $12 to more than $25 a share on its first day of trading.
Less than a year after LeBlanc arrived on the scene, however, inSilicon found itself
slashing its workforce in a doomed effort to survive as a stand-alone company. LeBlanc hit
the door soon after that, records show, with inSilicon gladly agreeing to sell itself for barely
$4 a share - after watching its stock sink below $2.50 on the open market - in the months
that followed.


David DeWalt, a Jive director who serves on the audit committee, currently chairs a
multibillion-dollar technology company that suffered a recent meltdown of its own.
Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) rattled the market earlier this month,records show, when the
company issued a profit warning that dashed hopes for an expected turnaround. A $20
stock shortly before that announcement - which fetched more than $30 last summer -
Polycom has since plummeted to a multiyear low of just $12.42 a share.


Double Date


Before Jive tapped him as its leader, records show, Zingale ran another technology
company tainted by outright scandal.


Zingale previously served as the turnaround CEO at Mercury Interactive, The Wall Street
Journal noted back in 2006(when he still held that post), one of the first high-tech
companies caught up in a sweeping investigation focused on backdated stock options.
Although Zingale arrived on the scene years after that suspicious activity took place,
theJournal observed, he inherited a company that would continue to operate under a dark
cloud nevertheless. With Zingale at the helm, the newspaper recounted, Mercury wound
up restating a decade worth of financial reports - and temporarily losing its spot on the
Nasdaq exchange - in a rocky comeback that finally allowed the company to sell itself to
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) in a multibillion-dollar deal.


Jive lured Zingale to the company a few years after he negotiated that transaction, records
show, and now counts Hewlett-Packard as one of the most treasured names on its entire
client list. Earlier this year, however, a muscular rival apparently scored a major contract
with that big electronics company as well.


"Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has landed Hewlett-Packard … as probably its biggest customer
and has been talking about it since it last reported earnings," Dow Jones noted about two
months ago. "Look for Salesforce to play up this relationship as often as it can in the

coming year."


Jive still provides the social-networking platform utilized by Hewlett-Packard, Dow Jones
acknowledged, which said that it has "no existing plan" to shift from its current system to
the rival program offered by Salesforce (hired for other services) instead. Although Jive
ranks Hewlett-Packard among its most valuable customers, based upon the size of its
contract, the company likes to brag that "millions of people at the world's largest
companies" by now use its platform to "transform their businesses." With that customer
base increasing at a much slower rate than its overall sales, however, Jive readily
acknowledges (and, in fact, repeatedly cautions) that the company depends heavily on the
continued renewal - and lucrative expansion - of existing accounts to drive its surging
revenue.


If anything, corporate filings indicate, that situation has grown more pronounced with the
passage of time.


In 2010, for example, Jive boosted its customer base by a solid 26% and - with the help of
those new customers - went on to report an even stronger 54% jump in annual revenues.
Jive expanded its customer base by just 13% in 2011, however, and wound up leaning
even harder on the customers that it already served. By retaining 90% of its big-ticket
accounts and "up-selling" more services to some of those important clients -- which the
company obviously needs to keep -- Jive actually managed to top its earlier performance
with a striking 67% jump in annual sales.


Fair-Weather Friends?


At the same time, however, Jive weathered major deterioration in a related metric that
serves as a critical guide to future sales. Jive keeps a running tally of the invoices that it
submits upon landing its contracts, records show, with the company presenting that
supplemental billings figure as a "significant performance measure and a leading indicator
of future recognized revenue" that will determine the level of its top-line growth.


While bookings practically doubled back in 2010, with Jive setting a new record by posting
a $35.7 million surge in bookings for the year, that growth rate fell by more than half in
2011 despite the massive sums the company spent while pursuing that business. Jive
invested an extra $15 million in sales and marketing for starters, with its sales force
expanding by more than 20% in the second half of the year alone, and threw an additional
$12 million or so into the research and development of enhanced technology that could
help drum up more customers as well. Corporate overhead literally exploded along the
way, accelerating even faster than its other major costs, with those bills costing almost

https://seekingalpha.com/article/560081-jive-software-current-star-future-wallflower 8/11


twice as much as they had the previous year. By the time that 2011 came to an end,
records show, Jive had seen its operating costs skyrocket by a whopping 65% to almost
$90 million -- a massive sum for a company that had generated barely half that amount in
total sales the prior year -- and wound up with little to show for all of the extra money that
it had spent.


After beefing up its sales team and indulging in a far more generous marketing budget last
year, corporate filings show, Jive posted a $33.1 million rise in bookings that actually fell
7% shy of the record gain that the company had achieved in 2010 with far more limited
resources. Despite the expanded reach of its sales force and the enhanced funding for
advances in the technology that it offers, those filings show, Jive witnessed a sizable drop-
off in its customer gains last year as well. The company added just 77 customers to its
client list in 2011, records show, or 37% fewer than the 122 that it netted one year earlier.


Even though Jive relied heavily on the renewal and expansion of its core accounts to
achieve its impressive top-line gains last year, records indicate, the company also
recorded a prior surge in bookings that promised a healthy stream of revenues to further
bolster its sales. While Jive can seek even more business going forward from deep-
pocketed clients like Hewlett-Packard -- a prize customer successfully courted by a
resourceful competitor hoping for a bigger contract as well -- the company lacks the
massive gains in bookings that previously served as an early signal of blockbuster sales.


Even Wall Street analysts, often optimistic by nature, have by now resigned themselves to
a slowdown in top-line growth. While they're still banking on healthy revenue gains going
forward, they predict that Jive will see its growth rate plummet by 23% this year and
continue to shrink the following year as well.


At the same time, analysts see no chance that Jive can generate enough revenue to cover
its exploding costs. Even if sales almost double from 2011 levels by the end of next year,
they predict, they will still fall short of the sums needed to pay all of the bills. Looking for
Jive to further extend its history of losses for at least another two years, they expect the
bleeding to slow but continue nonetheless.


As an unprofitable company with no forecasted earnings in sight, Jive remains valued
almost exclusively on its top-line performance. Even based on this forgiving metric, which
ignores ongoing losses, Jive looks incredibly overvalued at current prices. Jive already
trades at almost 10 times its forecasted 2013 sales, while other software technology

companies trade at an average of barely three times the sales they have already
achieved. That group, as a whole, boasts healthy double-digit sales growth of more than
20% a year and -- unlike Jive itself -- typically makes money in the process.


With Jive sporting such a rich multiple as its lockup period comes to an end, the stock has
already scared even some former bulls away.


"Peeling off a little JIVE," one stockholder recently volunteered when voicing his fears of
an imminent collapse. "It was overdue," he soon added, "for its IPO beat-down."

In reading this article and watching the hit that the $JIVE stock took over the past week, am I wrong to be optimistic
that they will share some good news on Tuesday 5/8? Would the stock make another jump if they showed some
strong growth numbers or would the early investor shares cause another round of declines? Is it time to collect my
winnings from being early in the ipo and run or wait this out? What are others doing?

Dr Andy
Market Sweeper is obviously a Short Seller blowing smoke about a very good company with a bright future. Notice
that today the DOW tanked and Jive hardly budged. That's an indication of what others think.

Obviously you're a long with a losing position who feels it's all caused by short sellers & who is so upset at
their own poor judgement you can't even get the authors handle correct..It's "The Street Sweeper" not Market
Sweeper....Dr ??? I doubt it

Take a look at the form S-1 on Edgar. Is it just a draft or something?The second page I looked at, page 33 on Dilution,
appears to not even be complete. Unless it is some kind of PDF bug, none of the numbers in this section are even
filled in. And then "SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE" section is also not filled in. Also the "Lock-up
Agreements" section has no number. WTF?

I just went to their website, and checked their list of customers. Selected one at random from the list which was not
the first one. Hitachi Data Systems. Watched the video of Nick Howe explain how jive has changed the way they
interact with customers. Then went to the HDS website, and clicked on their portal for customers, which has no sign
of jive at all. Has a contact via email link, follow us on twitter, join us on LinkedIn, and others but no jive. Clearly jive is
not even a minor part of how they interact with the customer. And why do the Jive folks put this kind of disingenuous
bs on their website unless they have nothing real to take its place.  
While the article above is rather long winded, heavy on anecdotes and short on a cohesive quantitative argument, the
negative thesis looks appealing.

AdamSmith1729, 
I partially disagree. The software does have some good benefits. Regardless, this is still an overly hyped and
overly priced stock with a lockup period ending June 11. This is just like 2000 all over again with valuations
going bonkers for companies that have zero earnings, tons of growth potential, and no profit strategy to justify
the current price.

Nice work on this one street sweeper. I've been shorting JIVE for a while now, new tech issues are def in a valuation
bubble now and JIVE is a great example. These guys are losing money even when you back out marketing costs,
crazy!

Having lost 20% of is value since this article was published, what is the feeling going forward into the end of the IPO
lockup period? With SCGF and KKR owning such a large number of shares at such a low price, it almost seems
obvious they will dump a portion of them on June 11th. No?


Thinking of playing puts on JIVE and was looking for any indication they are in any different straights than before.

On P/S multiple, JIVE looks very expensive for a company in such a competitive industry. With most other
social media stocks trading way below their IPO price, I dont see why JIVE shouldn't trade below its IPO price
of $12 shortly after lockup expiration.

Thanks. Pretty much my thoughts as well. But it's always nice to hear someone say the same thing. Of course
we'll deny it if it goes up. haha
