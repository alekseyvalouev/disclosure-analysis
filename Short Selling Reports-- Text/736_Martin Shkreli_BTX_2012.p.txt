BioTime Is Running Out Of Time - Short-Sell Idea
Apr. 11, 2012 7:04 AM ET20 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


My hedge fund is short BioTime (BTX), a speculative "regenerative medicine" company.
BioTime trades for a value of $221 million, but I think the company's enterprise is worth
something closer to $20 million. With only $22 million in cash, and limited operations that
seem to be ramping up, BioTime has a need for raising cash in the future. Without any
great assets to attract investors, I predict BioTime shares will drop at least 50% in the next
12 months.


BioTime is a collection of stem cell assets. None are particularly exciting. Start with the
pedestrian stem cell research tools the company offers. While BioTime tries to do their
best "Life Technologies impression", sales of these products were a paltry $500,000 last
year, hardly material. Their revenue from their Hextend products is around $1 million a
year, and is probably worth $5 million in value. These are reasonable and real assets that
are easy to value. There is about $6 million of value here, give or take. Let's now examine
the rest of the company's assets, which putatively make up the rest of the value.


The company is going to develop a device called HyStem-Rx , which is a
hyaluronan/collagen matrix. A lot of companies develop these gels and matrices, and it
will be a hard market to break into without salespeople, promotion, etc. The company
BioTime acquired to get this asset, Glycosan, was basically bankrupt and BioTime paid no
cash to acquire the company, instead issuing what I believe is their overvalued stock.


PanC-Dx is BioTime's diagnostic that "could be the future alternative to the mammogram",
according to the company. That shameless promotion should be censured by the SEC.
With no clinical data or explanation of which biomarkers this test uses, and the quite early
stage of development, BioTime should be embarrassed to be this promotional. Meanwhile,
other companies have cancer diagnostics, and while that can be a great business,
BioTime does not seem to have any proprietary technology. Their "antibody-based ELISA"
(redundant) technology has been around for a long time, and the idea of scouring cancer
patient blood for a reliable diagnostic is nothing new. I am skeptical the company has a
"special sauce" here.


OncoCyte, OrthoCyte, ReCyte and CellCure are BioTime's drug companies. I'm sure the
Company prefers to call them "regenerative medicine" companies or "insert revolutionary,
awe-inspiring synonym here companies", but they're just plain old drug companies trying

to develop stem cell drugs. These drug companies have never advanced a clinical
candidate to a Phase 1 study.


This is a good time to step back and explain why stem cell therapeutics are not here yet
and probably won't be here for a long time. I divide the stem cell pharmaceutical market
into two categories, the real science and the pseudo-science. I'll not name too many
private companies here, but I see a lot of different public, private and academic stem cell
efforts. The less-serious companies, like Cytori, Baxter, Neostem and Mesoblast which
attempt to harness adipose stem cells for some kind of paracrine effect, are having a hard
time. These products don't work, show no signs of working, and are very low-tech.


The more advanced stem cell players, like Geron (NASDAQ:GERN), Advanced Cell
Technology and Osiris (NASDAQ:OSIR) are very interesting and high-tech. These
companies have tried human experiments with cells that actually might differentiate into
various cell types. I generally view this approach as unwieldy and perhaps even
dangerous. It's very difficult to tell what is going on inside the patient when administering
one of these drugs. Geron gave up on this field after their Phase 1 study of human
embryonic cells for a reason. The FDA was so afraid that their powerful embryonic stem
cells might do harm, they required patient-by-patient dosing confirmation. Of course, the
company so no effect in the trial. It's simply too hard to predict or expect how or why these
cells will differentiate into new cell types, know how to stop etc. Without getting into too
much biology, I will utter the word that strike fear into every stem cell advocates' heart
because it is an important part of the point I'm trying to make: teratoma.


Teratomas, straight out of science fiction, are tumors with three germ layers expressed.
Stem cells form teratomas (Tang et al 2012, Wesselschmidt 2011), and this is one of the
many reasons the FDA fears (and should fear) stem cell therapeutics. The other obvious
pharmacodynamics issues are important. Without an obvious mechanism of action, it is
difficult to form boundaries on dosage (no Ki or IC50 here). Finally, I have always found
the immunogenicity aspects of cell therapy questionable. If we're giving fully functional
cells to patients, and not purified proteins, how can we be sure to not induce GvHD and
other immune issues?


The field has a lot of challenges ahead of it and I would not race to invest in anything that
moves. There are dozens, if not hundreds of stem cell companies. It doesn't always pay to
"be first" in revolutionary technologies and fields. Ask Geron shareholders and the few
dozen other stem cell failures. Also remember you could have owned one of the first

antibody companies, Idec (IDPH), at their IPO when they had miracle phase 3 data and a
filing for FDA approval for only $400 million market cap. The same exact math holds true
for Centocor. Watch and wait and pounce on bargains. BioTime is not one of them.


I am updating the investment ideas I give you all once again. I am covering the Cytori
(NASDAQ:CYTX) short that was recently recommended. I am not doing this because I
think Cytori is now a great investment opportunity, or I am going long, or anything like this.
I am doing this to illustrate the beauty of time-adjusted returns. If you do not think
extremely carefully about how time impacts your investing performance, you are not
investing properly. To put it more attractively and simply: if you optimize the duration of
your investments, you can become very wealthy, very quickly.


Recognizing the power of a smaller gain in a shorter period of time, versus a large gain in
a long period of time is important. Time is your main asset and liability. Shorter-term
investments require smaller returns because the compounding you are allowed to engage
in frees the requirement for a big return. Thus, capturing a 1% return every week in a
large-cap security (or a portfolio of them) is preferred to capturing a 50% move in a stock
over a 1 year period (1.01^52-1) = 68%. Depending on your investing style, it is often
easier to predict several, smaller 1 to 5% moves than 50-150% moves. I don't mean to say
that you shouldn't attempt to find large performance outliers - I have a long set of theory
I've developed on that - but you shouldn't ignore the opportunity to make great time-
adjusted trades. Eventually, you may "crowd out" the market for these opportunities, but
there are plenty of great funds that haven't quite reached their capacity to do so, even
though they are managing more than $10 billion dollars. Sometimes people ask me why it
makes sense to short a $3 stock like Cytori. Of course, this question illuminates the
questioner's failure to grasp the principles in this entire paragraph. A $3 to $2 stock move
in a short period of time is one of the most desirable returns one can see, similar to a
$2.00 to $2.66 if one is long. If you can consistently find returns like this, it won't be long
before you have reached a level of success few have.


With 11 out of 12 stock picks "working", with a median return of +36% and IRR of +119%, I
am pleased to continue to provide you with high-quality, albeit infrequent, investment
ideas.

Disclosure: I am short BTX.

2LO Asset Management
I think you have already shorted BTX and are trying to deflate the stock even further, or you are looking for a very
good entry point to go long on the stock. BTX is a company to be watching as it is one of the leading forefront runners
in genetics, and if it is as you say then it will be an excellent buy-out candidate for one of the larger pharmas. But, I do
not believe Michael West, the CEO, is interested in being bought out. BTX is a strong buy. So, go ahead and drive the
price down for me so I can buy more shares and add to my long position.

Michael West may be a great scientist however the author is making a point that has nothing to do with the
science. There is lots of money going out and not much money coming in at this company. Therefore in order
to continue on a going forward basis the company is going to have issue additional equity. This means more
stock and dilution which in all probability means a lower share price.

The only point I'd make about your time value of money comments is you aren't considering taxes. The difference in
short and long term tax rates for hedge fund investors must be considerable.

Author’s reply »  15% vs. 35%, like everyone else. it matters but it doesn't if you hit the right IRRs.

Mr. Dick Turpin
In your rather superficial analysis, which seems to focus far too much on the company's sales and marketing pitch
(which we all know is BS and therefore readily ignored in any deep analysis), you strangely ignore BioTime's very
broad portfolio of in-licensed patents, including IP from Wisconsin and Advanced Cell Technology.


Since Geron is out of the hES cell game, BioTime is probably the only company out there that has a chance of ever
developing an hES-based therapy (though that would still be a long way off).


Now, I think there might be very good reasons not to invest in stem cell companies and regenerative medicine
generally, but I don't think you provide a very good rationale for singling out BioTime as the company worth shorting.
Why not short them all?


Just because stem cell therapeutics "won't be here for a very long time," as you say, doesn't mean by itself they're not
worth investing in - unless, of course, you are an impatient investor, in which case you may want to avoid biotech
altogether and invest in a mobile app company that designs video games.

Ironic that you style yourself as a highway robber in your newly-fashioned SA Profile. Many would
characterize the performance of stem cell stocks over the last ten years as "highway robbery".


11 Apr 2012, 10:17 AM 


Mr. Dick Turpin
Yes, I agree. I have never invested in and don't plan on investing in stem cell stocks.


The point I was making with my post is that Mr. Martin Shkreli seems to provide a rather superficial analysis
as a basis for his advice to short BioTime's stock. While he clearly has a basic understanding of the biology
and science, he seems to gloss over important details that at least differentiate BioTime from much of the rest
of the pack of stem cell companies. That renders his advice somewhat suspect, in my opinion.

Your statement, "It's simply too hard to predict or expect how or why these cells will differentiate into new cell types,
know how to stop etc." is a proof enough for me to conclude your shallow knowledge about the science in which
hundreds of institutions and thousands of scientists/researchers all across the globe have been doing a lot of studies
and have unfolded a lot of secrets addressing the very doubt you express! You do not seem to have spent enough
efforts to look for and comprehend what these guys are doing and yet want to present your hypothetical nonsense
intrigues me as to why you are doing so!

There is a problem with your Teratoma claim and Geron. There has been no signs of Teratomas in any of the Geron
phase 1 trial patients. There is a reason there is no teratomas Geron was not injecting undiferentiated HESCs into
patients they injected OPC1 differtiated progenator cells. After the Company has halted the trial many of the trial
participants have networked together. The Company halted the trial and HESC program because of their new CEO
and the BOD wanting to focus on Cancer. There are some who think the new CEO has religious objections to HESC.
Geron is currently in the middle of patent litigation with Viacyte over definitive endoderm. Viacyte is patialy owned by
J&J. They also have a deal with Pfizer for HESC used for drug screening. This legal Case goes to oral arguements in
June. Geron in their Phase 1 trial has said that the cells are very predictable and the results are consitant. None of the
patients have cavitation at the injury site. The OPC1 dose was 1/20th of what was thought to be an effective dose.

So let me get this straight- you take shots at BTX for their marketing claims for the Panc-Dx diagnostic tool in
development being misleading....in an article you title "BioTime is running out of time".


The title insinuates a company faced with an imminent need to produce something (which you fail to articulate) in
order to survive. Yet the only deadline you reference is that they may soon need to raise more funds. For a company
with strong institutional backing, and has as history of raising cash in the past- both in dilutive and non-dilutive
manners- this is hardly a death-knell. In fact, dilusionary equity offerings in this space recently have often been little
more than a short-term blip in stock price, which recovers quickly.


Tell me again why we shouldn't trust entities that provide misleading public statements? Oh, the irony.

The author lumps a number of completely different stem cell therapies together then states "these products don't
work, show no signs of working, and are very low-tech" without even the slightest bit of evidence, and in spite of
extremely positive clinical trials and hundreds of patents filed. It just smells like a desperate attempt to negatively
influence the stock prices of the group. Good luck on doing that for very long!

Martin,


Interesting article, are your shorting ACTC now? Do you see a good shorting opportunity if the proposed reverse
stock split is approved and is acted upon? Do you believe that stem cell research is at a point that the cell
differentiation process is not understood correctly and fully (safely)? 
And from your 7th paragraph from the top “It's very difficult to tell what is going on inside the patient when
administering one of these drugs.” Do you believe that by the indication(s) that ACTC is going after in eye diseases
that the advancements in medical imaging does not give them a good, sound feel for what is happening in the eye?
Also, these therapies are not “drugs” but hopefully a regenerative improvement in what drugs can offer. 
Yes, “the power of a smaller gain in a shorter period of time, versus a large gain in a long period of time is important.”-
very important and (numerous times doesn’t hurt). Thanks.

Dr. West has dealt with the incompetent boards at Geron and Advanced Cell. His setup at BTX has the smart money
managers 
from Carl Icahn which doesn't inhibit the understandings necessary 
to succeed in Esc or Ips cells. Buying into BTX is like owning 
a mutual fund in patented stem cell technology.

It seems that in any of his companies, he could start an IPO or 
sell interest to third party without dilution which he is very aware 
of from his past experiences.


He is very aware of US,large pharma,FDA, and will IMHO succeed 
outside the US where the financial markets and human suffering 
are greater than the controlled US.


In addition, their is very few that understand or control the patents 
on telomere technology with Karen Chapman, his wife, gerontologist. With Dr. West, you buy one get one free.


God Bless. Have a God's day.

Hi Martin,  
Seems like the same things could have been said for a long time, yet BTIM continued to rally. What makes you think
that Mr. Market will come around to see things your way just now? How do you in general think about calling tops of
such story-driven biotechs?

I love that you focus on these companies as investments with an eye to whether they can produce cash flows in a
reasonable time period. Many biotech reviewers focus on the science and whether it has merit, even when the
timeframes involved in validating that merit make the stock of the company a horrific investment.


Can I ask that in future when you publish a table with your current ROI you clearly identify which trades are long and
which are short?


Look forward to reading more of your ideas. If you publish a newsletter let us know how to get on your distribution list.
