OCZ - The Master
of SSD (Shady,
Suspect,
Deceitful)
Apr. 20, 2011 11:19 AM ET61 comments | Includes: DVMT, …


Today we published a long report on OCZ Technology (NASDAQ:OCZ), "OCZ -
The Master of SSD (Shady, Suspect, Deceitful)" which can be found in its
entirety here: 
 
www.scribd.com/doc/53435574/OCZ-The-Mast... 
 
Below is a brief intro of the issues covered in the first few pages of the article,
many of which we believe will be helpful reveleations for investors...... 
 


Over the last six months, investors have learned a painful and expensive
lesson from the following story. A small Chinese company comes public
through an RTO (reverse take-over) or a backdoor listing on the OTC Bulletin
Board. The story blossoms alongside a rising stock price, riding a new hot
theme or even a legitimate end market. Ignoring red flags from management's
past, sellside analysts and investors choose to believe the Cinderella tale. The
tale itself is always hard to verify, but the detailed insight the CEO shares
creates complacency and a willingness to look past obvious risks and financial
irregularities. Based on the CEO's story, a cult-like following ensues, and the
company is able to raise large sums of capital. The company puts up huge
revenue numbers quarter-after-quarter, yet the profitability and cash flows
never seem to materialize. And then one day, investors realize that numbers
never reconciled and huge accounting inconsistencies existed the whole time.
They also realize important facts were never disclosed and the product wasn't

5/19/2018 OCZ - The Master of SSD (Shady, Suspect, Deceitful) - Copperfield Research | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/166874-ocz-the-master-of-ssd-shady-suspect-deceitful 2/31


what management claimed. Ultimately, investors suffer large losses as the
final chapter. OCZ Technology (OCZ) may just be the American version of the
story above.





OCZ has parlayed investor and market excitement for solid state drives (SSDs)
into an amazing story. From a low of $1.79 last summer, OCZ's stock has
steadily climbed more than 350% on a feel good tale told by its CEO. But there
is a much darker and sinister side that has been well hidden. It is our opinion
that OCZ has misrepresented its SSD growth and has financial irregularities
that are nearly impossible to reconcile. We believe that some form of a
restatement may be required and that the auditors tick and tie review has
some substantial inconsistencies. As such, we have sent our findings to the
Securities and Exchange Commission asking for clarification on the multiple
sets of numbers that we have uncovered. We believe OCZ's Board has the
fiduciary responsibility to form a special committee to examine these
discrepancies.





But the misrepresentations are not confined to the financials. A scathing
lawsuit and industry reviews suggest OCZ has misrepresented product specs
and performance. Additionally, a recently completed secondary failed to
disclose the CEO's criminal record, major underwriter conflicts (until the final
prospectus), and contained financial results that were different from past
filings. And if that is not enough, there are other confusing pieces to the story
such as Fusion-io, STEC, and Smart Modular disclosing that they do not see
OCZ in competitive situations. Amazingly, we believe most of the interest in
OCZ is nothing more than a wise guy backdoor play on the hot Fusion-io deal
that should backfire as the OCZ issues get exposed.





As investors begin to recognize that the CEO has told the world that OCZ is
trying to get qualified at EMC and IBM (so much for selective disclosure), the
last catalyst will have played itself out versus elevated expectations. Although
the sellside will likely remain complicit, we believe buyside investors that
expect $400 million of revenue, and more importantly $0.75 of earnings in
fiscal 2012, will be disappointed. With buyside estimates at unobtainable levels

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/166874-ocz-the-master-of-ssd-shady-suspect-deceitful 3/31


and promotional qual announcements fully priced in, we think the stock will
finally be valued on fundamentals. If OCZ trades in-line with the comp group,
a generous assumption given OCZ's limited asset value, differentiation, and
minimal profitability, a reasonable price target would be between $2.58 and
$4.98 per share.





This report will highlight:


1) Huge losses for AIM investors and a previous profitless revenue
ramp. OCZ listed its stock on the AIM before moving to a U.S. listing. OCZ
management rode a profitless revenue ramp and told a very similar story then
to raise money from investors. They proceeded to miss estimates by 40% and
delist their shares less than three years after the original listing. OCZ's stock
declined 95% from its peak.


2) BCInet - an unusual transaction. OCZ claims to have sold its Neural
Impulse Actuator line to a company that was incorporated, at most, just seven
days before the sale took place. Public filings show OCZ shares the same
address as the purported buyer, a company called BCInet.


3) Accounting Irregularities, SSD growth overstatement, and
irreconcilable financials. Based on discrepancies in OCZ's SEC filings, we
believe the company has misrepresented its SSD revenue and growth rates.
The SSD revenues from past financials do not reconcile with an important
segment table they have been providing since January. Based on comments in
the MD&A from the 10Q, it appears management has overstated the year-
over-year SSD growth rate by over 200%.


4) Irregularities in the prospectus, past filings, and a needed
restatement. The prospectus that investors relied upon for the recent
secondary appears to have contained material financial inaccuracies. Based
upon the financials provided, we are unable to reconcile the Segment
attributions with past SEC filings. The prospectus appears to overstate SSD
growth for 2010 by 183%. The 8K (from 1/10/11), the 10K, and the revenue
from quarterly results reported in each 10Q do not reconcile. Additionally, it
appears SSD revenues were somehow reallocated to the PSU segment in some
5/19/2018 OCZ - The Master of SSD (Shady, Suspect, Deceitful) - Copperfield Research | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/166874-ocz-the-master-of-ssd-shady-suspect-deceitful 4/31


financials and the memory segment in others - with the result being
overstated forward revenue growth in SSD. Finally, OCZ's CFO resigned late
last year after only 18 months in that role.


5) Material information was withheld about the CEO's past felonious
activity. OCZ and the underwriters did not disclose material background
information on the CEO's criminal record. While we are sympathetic to
mistakes made in the past, we believe the importance of the CEO's credibility
is essential given the extreme reliance investors and analysts have placed on
his story. A national criminal records search shows the CEO was arrested
and/or charged in various Courts for: Grand Theft, Forgery, Unlawful Entry
Motor Vehicle, Theft-1, Drug Violations, and Traffic in Stolen Property.


6) Controversial geographic disclosures suggest all of the growth is
from EMEA. Despite cagy references to HP, Yahoo, and other U.S.-based
enterprise wins, close to 100% of OCZ's growth has come from the Middle
East, Africa, and Europe. Based on public disclosures by the CFO, for the
numbers to reconcile, SSD business outside of the U.S. is somehow growing
nearly 3x faster than U.S. SSD growth. The company's comments about SSD
attributions imply North American non-SSD revenues would have fallen
between 53% and 92% sequentially, while that same non-SSD business was
flattish outside of the U.S. While unrelated, it is worth noting that OCZ has
received inquiries from the FBI about product sales into the Middle East.[i]


7) Claiming to triple capacity out of thin air. OCZ has publicly stated
multiple times that they expanded capacity by 3x in the third fiscal quarter. We
have been unable to find the associated expenses or capital expenditures
supporting that level of capacity expansion. In fact, PP&E declined by $10,000
from Q1 to Q3, while capex was only $728,000 for the entire first nine months
of the fiscal year.


8) Hype aside, OCZ looks ugly next to STEC. Despite a rocky road ahead
for STEC, the side-by-side comparisons are alarming for OCZ investors that
believe the company has the infrastructure and support to establish large
revenue agreements with OEM's (qualification announcement do not equal
revenue). STEC employs 250% more heads in R&D and spends nearly 90%
more per such employee. Further, STEC spent more than 400% more on R&D
5/19/2018 OCZ - The Master of SSD (Shady, Suspect, Deceitful) - Copperfield Research | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/166874-ocz-the-master-of-ssd-shady-suspect-deceitful 5/31


in 2010 than OCZ spent in the previous four years combined. When taking all
of OCZ's options and warrants into consideration, the enterprise value of OCZ
is now just $250 million less than STEC.


9) OCZ's appears delusional and does not seem to play in the high-end
enterprise SSD sandbox. Don't take our word for it, look at the supposed
competition. In public filings, OCZ claims to compete with Fusion-io, STEC and
Smart Modular. However, none of those three list OCZ as a competitor in their
public filings. Additionally the "wise guy" investors that have bought OCZ as a
backdoor to Fusion-io are likely to be sorely disappointed if they actually
compare the financial profiles and end markets of the two companies.


10) Industry reviews accuse OCZ of disingenuous specs and "shady"
marketing. The CEO of DDRdrive and the industry review website Storage
Review have accused OCZ of knowingly publishing disingenuous product
specifications. OCZ's decision to deceptively market new products with legacy
specs and marketing material led one industry website to warn (talking about
the product, not the stock) "At this point it is buyer beware until OCZ steps up
and reveals some degree of transparency."[ii] 


11) OCZ is being sued for Negligent Misrepresentation and Deceptive
Advertising Practices. OCZ failed to disclose any of the details behind the
lawsuit filed against them in U.S. District Court less than three weeks ago. The
lawsuit provides great detail into OCZ's decision to change the number of
modules, the densities, and the nodes of its flash cells without disclosing such
changes to customers. The lawsuit accuses OCZ of Deceptive Advertising and
Negligent Misrepresentation, among six total claims, "OCZ's advertisings and
marketing representations concerning the storage capacity and performance of
the Products are false, misleading, and deceptive."


12) The Indilinx acquisition - fuzzy math and a bleak revenue picture.
Despite management's rosy comments around Indilinx and future accretion,
public SEC filings portray Indilinx as a company that was quite challenged. In
2010, Indilinx revenues fell by 69% to just $2 million. Excluding the decline in
revenue from OCZ, their sales still fell 46% compared to 2009. We are unsure
how management defines "accretive" and do not think Indilinx can generate
the required $1.7 million of EBIT to offset the dilution from the deal.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/166874-ocz-the-master-of-ssd-shady-suspect-deceitful 6/31


13) OCZ will not come close to hitting buyside expectations. We have
carefully analyzed buyside expectations for revenues this year (FY'12) of $400
million and pro forma earnings of $0.77 per share. We believe that buyside
investors are making a major error extrapolating the contribution margins that
are implied in the fourth quarter from management's two press releases.
Further, we believe management may need to rely on a) selling DRAM
inventories at 100% gross margins that had previously been reserved against,
and b) the possible reversal of an accrual taken for lack of payment to a
supplier. We slice the numbers several different ways and think buyside
revenues may be attainable, but the company will come nowhere close to
making $0.77 of earnings.


14) The co-founders aggressive selling may be one step ahead of
investors. The spate of insider selling could raise some flags. CEO Ryan
Petersen sold nearly two million shares a few months ago in private
transactions and the open market at levels 50% lower than where the stock
currently trades. Also, one of OCZ's co-founder's recently sold most of his
stock below $4.00 (he may have sold 100% of his stock, but we can not
confirm that yet).


15) Why was the Merriman Capital relationship not disclosed in the
preliminary prospectus? For some reason the lengthy and intertwined
relationship between OCZ and Merriman Capital did not appear to get
disclosed in the preliminary prospectus. Given the depth of the relationships,
the Chairman's significant stake in OCZ, and the bullish support from research,
we are unsure why the relationship was not initially disclosed.

In the disclaimer the author claims a short

Stifel Nicolaus just started OCZ at a buy
yesterday. I will trust Nicolaus. 
Needham also put a buy on OCZ
yesterday.

Both Stifel Nicolaus and Needham also
have a vested interest in OCZ success
as they were part of the team leading

From a purely technical (stock chart
perspective), it was not encouraging
that OCZ stock price was unable to
respond positively to the analyst
upgrades. Some serious technical
damage has been done to the stock
(now below both the 20 and 50 day
mavgs), and it appears the long
investors may have exhausted their
buying power for now. The stock price
rebounded to 50% of the sell off from
the bottom (a 50% Fib retracement)
and may now be dropping to retest the
low. I note that 200-day moving
average is about $5/share - where I
would expect some strong buying
support. There is now a lot of overhead
resistance from folks who bought in at
the $7-9 band level and are currently
have a loss.

The author of this article refuses to
disclose his identity and has a short
position. This is the same person who
brought down EBIX a couple of weeks ago.
His analysis was much the same as this
article claiming falsifications and criminal
activity by the CEO. The pattern of this
scammer is exactly the same. He is cleaver
and is making money by manipulating the
market. The accusations against EBIX have
turned out to be false and I think OCZ is a
victim of this unscrupulous author.

Value Bulldog, Contributor
Nice work again. My DD uncovered similar
things from talking to U.S. based industry
participants. If you look at their U.S.
business over 2/3 of it goes through
NewEgg.com which is clearly not
enterprise or OEM business. I was
scratching my head on where all this
volume in Europe was going given they
had no 10% customers there. The
explanation I got from the sell side was
"small system integrators". Good work
uncovering the CEO's legal issues, I had
not thought to do that. I also did not
realize to just what extent it was a pump
and dump on the AIM.

This is the same crap Varient View
Research pulled through an article in SA
about ABAT dropping the stock 45%. VVR
has no website or even address. They
admitted they were short on ABAT. There
was no named author of the article. How
can SA publish articles where the author
won't even give his/her name? Then the
articles are published as "headlines" on
Yahoo Finance. What a racket. Is SA
getting a piece of the action? These people
are admitted short sellers making millions
with their unproven accusations and
misinformation. I love their disclaimer at
the end of the article. Some smart law firm
will have a hayday with these scumbags
soon.

The author is a "pump and dump" artist.
He and his minions prey upon the fears
and greed of investors by manipulating
thinly traded small cap stocks. He will
never go after the large caps like GE, XOM
or PG because he cannot successfully
manipulate price and his BS will be
instantly shot down. Please check out the

Although it is hard to tell what is fact or

demand some clarity out of OCZ. The 3x
increase in manufacturing capacity,
without a subsequent capital investment. 
One surface mount line required in the
assembly of drives would cost
approximately $800,000. Any 3x increase
would necessitate a 3x increase in the
number of surface mount lines. Now it
could be that they are only performing the

final assembly of the drives, which would
only require a 3x increase in the number
of torque screwdrivers et. 
A very low investment, and the 700k
expense would more than cover. However,
this would mean that a significant portion
of the production/manufacturing process is
outsourced and I do not believe this is how
they have presented themselves.
Reviewing their website I see no physical
address or photo's of their facility. 
I am sure they have one, but I suspect it is
for final assembly.


On his listing of competitors he is exactly
right. The competitors he has listed all are
based upon the same hardware and
firmware. 
Exact same controller, same type flash,
and same FW. 
All dependent upon Sandforce. STEC and
Fusion IO have substantial IP and are not
dependent.


The DRAM business is the most
interesting. The DRAM business and SSD
business are both highly dependent upon
managing a volatile commodity, DRAM and
Flash. Given the significant write offs over
previous few quarters, prior years
performance when listed on the AIM, their
track record at managing does not lead to
a significant amount of confidence in their
ability in the future to manage the Flash
commodity. Additionally, during the period
where these substantial write downs of
inventory took place, although the market
was in a downward trajectory, it does not
equate at all with the amount of the write
down. The potential of reversal of these
write downs, or what was written down,
certainly exists. One could lump a lot of
things into a write down, only to capture

upside in a later quarter. Making whatever
story come to reality.


Although the author might have had an ax
to grind, or short position to cover, does
not necessarily invalidate his conclusions.
Just because your paronoid, does not
mean they are not after you.

How is this not illegal? They're inciting
others to trade based on lies so that they
can profit from the price change... isn't
that illegal?


SA really needs to take action, CR has
done this before against EIBX. Either take
down the posts or mark them as opinion,
under review, or something to show this
isn't legitimate research before SA itself
looses credibility.

10) Industry reviews accuse OCZ of
disingenuous specs and "shady"
marketing.


Yes there was performance degradation
caused by moving to 25nm NAND. It was
not an honourable move for OCZ to use
the same product branding, but they
handled the consequences better than
anyone else in the industry.  
Anand have a lot of respect for OCZ and
the way they handled this issue.

First of all, you should know I'm long this
stock and want most of all to try to
separate fact from fiction. Can we have a
discussion about some of the points that
Copperfield raises?


Let's grant that they have an interest in
driving the stock down. Let's also not play
shoot the messenger. They've clearly done
a lot of research and in my mind the
company needs to get its cards on the
table, and fast. What would the answer be
to the following, which are most troubling
to me?


(1) Why is growth in the US flat, and all
growth seems to come from the Mideast
and Africa?


(2) Why don't OCZ's principal competitors
list them as a competitor?

dressing", or will there be real economic
benefit here?


The "cockroach theory" is in play here. If
any of the accusations is true, then we
can't really believe anything else the
company says, until they regain our trust.


What would you all say?

(1) Why is growth in the US flat, and all
growth seems to come from the Mideast
and Africa?


The statement is a lie - check
Needham's response posted on the
yahoo message board.


(2) “OCZ doesn’t play in the high-end
enterprise SSD sandbox”: Firstly, the
company has already achieved
“enterprise wins”, albeit more for low-
end storage and server. Second, as we
said in our initiation, we believe the
greatest unit opportunity is actually in
the mid-range, a market that the
company IS targeting. Who said you
have to be up against STEC to be in
SSDs? Technically they compete with
many SSD vendors, but in reality they
seldom see STEC. We are far from a
zero game in SSDs, and as we laid out
in last report on OCZ, there is more
than enough growth to see multiple
winners.


The above from Needham - The yahoo
who posted the info does not know a
thing!


(3) From Needham again: 
Indilinx Acquisition Fuzzy Math”: The
Indilinx acquisition was not for revenue,

so it is irrelevant that they only had
$2M. This was a technology acquisition
to bolster internal development of their
own controller. Accretion comes from
use of the Indilinx controller in the
ramping PCIe product and keeping the
nearly 60% margin they would have
had to pay as well as including the
controller in future products.


If you are invested in OCZ, you should
have known all of what Needham said
above! Long OCZ

too cowardly to even use their own

is evidence refuting what they say. I
cannot blame OCZ for not lending any
creedence to "copperfiled's" quasi-legal

Copperfield's attack that they do not
even understand what SSD's are or how
they differ from standard memory. Who
cares whether these so-called
'competitors' list them as competition or
not. I own several of OCZ's drives and
know they are fantastic. I have been in
the business for 30 years. Personally, I
will put my faIth in my own experience,
and well known and recognized analysts
like those from Needham and Nichols

You dont know that they make valid
points. They are pointing at the
negatives and then inventing a story
around it saying it must mean this or it
must mean that. Its a comon gosip trick
that works well in generateing hoopla.
BP has been disclosed to have engaged
in all sorts of "questionable" activities
relateing to the oil spill. But that doesnt
mean the company is a cock roach and
the stock should be quartered. Nothing
ever adds up perfectly and people need
to decide what is important. I dont think
a kid ripping off cars at a time that
Copperfield failed to mention (very
convenient ommission), has much
bearing on a produceing ssd company.
Its clear Copperfield did not intend to
fully enlighten us as much as he
intended to create a panic. Im sure
there are a few items to note, but the
bulk will end up being a moutain out of
a mole hill that freaked people out.

TheGribbler
Disclosure: I am long OCZ and I work
professionally in forensic accounting.


As an investor in OCZ, when I read the
Copperfield Report, beyond the obvious
hyperbole and misleading insinuations, the
only points made that concerned me were
with respect to the reconciliation of
segment revenue. After studying this issue
more carefully tonight, I have concluded
that Copperfield's allegations on this point
are also incorrect and unfounded, if not
outright fraudulent. Here's why:


The first discrepancy noted by Copperfield
is whether the Q32010 SSD revenue is
$21.2mm or $9.8mm. It appears that
Copperfield is correct that the 8-K release
is different from the original 10-Q numbers
and it appears Memory and SSD have been

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/890075-copperfield-research/166874-ocz-the-master-of-ssd-shady-suspect-deceitful 22/31


flip-flopped. Copperfield goes on to
incorrectly assume that the 10-Q numbers
must be right, and then concludes that the
8-K and PR using the higher growth rate
was deceptive, etc. etc.


In a blur of accusations, I almost missed
where Copperfield notes, "Our first
reaction when seeing this irregularity was
that it must be a flip-flop mistake.
However, we were unable to find any
reclassification disclosures (always a
possibility that we missed it somewhere)."


For purported "extensive due diligence,"
did Copperfield happen to see the 10-Q/A
filed on 1/14/11 (one day after the original
10-Q filing)??? This amended filing
corrects the mistakes and matches the 8-
K. It clearly says on p.1 of the 10-Q/A,
"This amendment corrects certain
typographical errors within the “Net
revenues” discussions in the MD&A."


This type of purposeful misleading analysis
is why Copperfield is an outright fraud.


The second revenue accusation has to do
with not being able to reconcile earlier SSD
figures, before it was a standalone
segment. Copperfield accuses OCZ,
claiming, "Our guess is management
moved SSD revenues to PSU in 2010 to
overstate SSD growth."


Without going through all the specifics,
Copperfield's work is flawed because the
old segment breakdown included a
category called "SSD/Flash Memory
Storage" and another called "Power
supplies." The new (current) segment set
is now "SSD" and "PSU/Other." Clearly the
"Flash Memory Storage" is principally the
"Other" which got moved over and is now
grouped with PSU. Through Copperfield's

limited understanding of OCZ's actual
products, he has failed to account for USB
thumb drives, which, while made with
flash memory, are very very different from
SSDs and deserve to be in a separate
segment. When OCZ was just getting
started in SSD years ago, it made sense to
group these together, but as SSD grew,
this was a logical split.


So, comparing these two is not apples to
apples, which is precisely why OCZ
provided the historical figures on the new
basis, so we would have an accurate
picture of the SSD business standalone.
Once again, Copperfield's dirty trick has
been revealed.

I didnt actually go thru all the numbers.
I was sure everybody else would be
pouring all over them to see whats up.
Besides, he didnt blast about anything
really significant like revenue
discrepencies. And another red flag
about Coperfields message was his
criticizm of SSD growth projections. I
got no respect for his opinion there.
Everybody in the know realises that this
whole SSD thing is going to launch like
a rocket. Its going to be monster huge,
but who can actually put an accurate
growth number on monster huge. The
point is that its going to be a melt up
senario and nobody will be able to keep
up with demand. As far as products,
OCZ's R3 is a great product that is PCI-
express based. If the numbers are
accurate, its even 20% faster than
Fusion IOs best offering in the same IO
slot, but Fusion IOs other cards that run
in the higher bandwidth slots have

simply stagering performance. But the
ongoing debate it wether Intel will
eliminate these slots in future servers.
It would be a meaningless debate
except that Nvidia is indeed branching
into ARM based mobile computeing
because of its vulnerability to Intel and
AMD integrateing graphics into their
chipsets. So unless Coperfield can
uncover more substantial number
discrepancies, the whole Solid State
memory upgrade cycle in data centers
is the main attraction and there are still
not enough supliers to deal with whats
just around the corner.

Nobody else gives a shite.

If that's how you really feel, then you’re
no better than the lying, Shady,

I was an owner of 4,000 shares that I sold
this morning. I like OCZ products, but if
you read the report in detail and you read
OCZ's response, you can't help to fee that
something is going on. A simple typo on a
public and filed doc is almost as bad as
fraud. What kind of people run a company
that is capable of making these kinds of
errors?

Copperfield, as usual your research is good
and the seeking alpha comments in
response are hilarious.


What's really funny is when people named
Truth1347, chhsa, and Fire171 criticize the
author for being anonymous. Is Fire171
your first or last name?


Please learn the definition of hypocrisy.

Hey, I don't have to worry about
lawsuits or criminal investigations, I am
honest. It is common practice to use
screen names in comments. That is
very different than publishing a
"research" report full of erroneous
information, with the express purpose
of stock manipulation. If "Copperfield"

Revisiting this article 9 months later
provides a good laugh.


At CES 2012, OCZ has demonstrated their
Everest 2 platform from Indilinx which will
give them a huge competitive advantage
as it's 3x faster with incompressible data
then the competing Sandforce controller.
Furthermore, the next-gen Sandforce
controller won't be available until January
2013 and still won't match Everest 2 with
performance. I appears that management
was correct in saying that the Indilinx
acquisition will be accretive in FY13.


The article was correct with their FY12 GM
predictions, however OCZ has begun
ramping their Enterprise PCIe solutions (Z-
Drive R4) which will have Gross Margins
greater then 50% and will allow them to
reach their end of the year FY13 GM target
of 30-40%.


With more then 40% of the float short
because of weak arguments such as those
