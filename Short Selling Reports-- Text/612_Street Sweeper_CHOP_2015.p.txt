China Gerui: Steel Company's Shares Ready To Shatter
Apr. 24, 2015 10:36 AM ET11 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


CHOP has acquired hundreds of pieces of Chinese porcelain that company leaders
hope to sell for a profit and save the struggling steel business.


CHOP is burning about $80 million per quarter and is now left with only about $2
million unrestricted cash and $50 million restricted cash - a capital raise may be.


If CHOP is able to re-enter the steel business, it will find a steel surplus, hundreds of
competitors, razor-thin margins and the looming risk of becoming state owned.


CHOP has attracted very little to no recognizable institutional investment - always a
bad sign.


A class-action lawsuit looms, threatening to consume the money and management
attention that are greatly needed now to deal with the current crisis.


The future of a Chinese steel company teeters atop a pile of porcelain artwork.


Those fragile pieces are the latest elements straining to prop up China Gerui Advanced
Materials Group (NASDAQ:CHOP).


The company says it intends to eventually sell porcelain pieces in hopes of saving the
steel business.


But the hammers are raised and threaten to shatter CHOP's last-ditch efforts.


TheStreetSweeper highlights the cash burn, business shift, lawsuit allegations, and other
issues that we believe make CHOP shares worth a couple of quarters or maybe even, as
one analyst said, "zero."


Meanwhile, investors may find other viewpoints here about the Chinese cold-rolled steel
manufacturer. The company's thin steel product - sometimes only as wide as a human hair
- is sold to the Chinese food packaging, electrical appliances and construction materials
industries.


CHOP has not yet responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for an interview.

Virtually no cash left


CHOP has been burning through a mountain of cash - about $240 million in three quarters
or $80 million per quarter - the company now reports just $2.3 million of unrestricted cash
and $50 million in restricted cash remaining. At the current unbelievable burn rate, CHOP
must find more operating money soon.


History of massive revenue decline, debt problems and recent cash-poor position


CHOP shares suddenly rocketed from 70 cents apiece to about $4, in opposition to the
direction of the company's cash and revenue.


The company's revenue has been spiraling downward for some time, as shown in the
company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings:


Filed Jan. 6, 2015:


Third Quarter 2014 Results Revenue decreased 90.0% to $3.1 million in the
third quarter of 2014 from $30.9 million in the third quarter of 2013. Nine Months
2014 Results Revenue was $62.2 million in the first nine months of 2014
compared with $119.6 million in the first nine months of 2013… As of June 30,
2014, the company had $3.0 million in unrestricted cash…


The company also posted a loss of $6 million in the third quarter. Noting its one-for-ten
reverse stock split, the company blamed poor results on low steel prices, declining sales,
credit problems, downtime of production lines, bank loan defaults and working capital
shortages.


Filed Sept. 4, 2014:


Second Quarter Results Revenue decreased 24.1% to $32.7 million in the second
quarter of 2014 from $43.1 million in the second quarter of 2013. Gross profit
decreased 51.8% to $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2014 from $3.5 million in
the same quarter of 2013.


Gross margin was 5.2%… Operating loss was $0.6 million… Net loss was $1.4
million.

First Quarter Results Revenue decreased 42.0% to $26.4 million in the first
quarter of 2014 from $45.6 million in the first quarter of 2013. Gross profit
decreased 123.9% to ($1.2 million) in the first quarter of 2014 from $5.2 million
in the same quarter of 2013.


The chart from Bloomberg below, presents a vivid image of CHOP's perilous cash
position, plummeting from about $200 million or more in the second quarter of 2012
through the first quarter last year, down to a few million in the second and third quarters of
2014:

The cash wasn't used to pay down debt, since short-term debt declined only a tiny bit,
according to this Bloomberg chart:

So show us the money!


So what happened to all that money?


Well, the company CEO complained during its earnings report Sept. 4, 2014:


Despite various corporate actions to sustain our stock price, including share
repurchases, our stock performance has been tied to our operational performance.


The fix for this annoying issue?


At this time, management views the entry into the China antiquities market as a
viable alternative to maximize the long-term cash appreciation of its cash assets.


Yes, the steel company suddenly became a Chinese porcelain trader.


Here's what the company stated under the "Business Update" heading in its latest
financial filing:



http://www.geruigroup.com/images/China%20Gerui%20Fiscal%20Year%202014%20Second%20Quarter%20Results.pdf

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1449801/000135448815000044/chop_ex991.htm
5/22/2018 China Gerui: Steel Company's Shares Ready To Shatter - China Gerui Advanced Materials Group Limited (NASDAQ:CHOP) | Seeking Al…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3099576-china-gerui-steel-companys-shares-ready-to-shatter 6/12


We continue to believe that our investment in the Chinese antiquities market will
yield mid-term cash flow which will in turn drive and expand our metals processing
business. We are vigorously pursuing opportunities with established domestic and
international auction houses to liquidate the antique collection in part or in its
entirety. As we navigate these lengthy negotiations, our research and development
team continues to create innovative, wide-ranging products to attract new business
from existing clients and penetrate into additional markets to expand our customer
base. These advanced products will specifically target applications possessing
higher gross margins. With our advanced manufacturing capabilities and new
products, we are positioned to gain from the eventual recovery of the steel industry.


So that's apparently what happened to the money. The company says it forked over about
$234 million to someone - no word on who or when or where it might be stored - for
delicate Chinese porcelain dating back as far as the Song Dynasty. CEO Mingwang Lu
said,


It is our intention to sell all 206 pieces over time to reinforce our cash position and
earn a substantial return.


The porcelain was a steal - acquired at a 74 percent discount according to the "$905
million" value as appraised by some undisclosed entity, said Mr. Lu.


It's interesting that Mr. Lu's letter to shareholders three weeks later didn't even mention the
huge porcelain acquisition, but did discuss the company's "comprehensive product mix."


Class-action lawsuit hits CHOP


This steel-porcelain business turned into a class-action lawsuit filed Nov. 26, 2014 by
shareholder Aram Pehlivanian, alleging securities' laws violations. The complaint revolves
around the company's use of most of its unrestricted cash to buy the Chinese porcelain.


The lawsuit states,


This supposed purchase of antiquities was all the more shocking because, in the
years and months leading up to the announcement, CHOP had consistently and
unambiguously communicated to the investing public that its goals for growth
included an expansion and diversification of its product lines, identification of
overseas markets, and business combinations with competitors.

Shares dropped from 61 cents on Sept. 3, 2014, to 49 cents the day of the announcement
on Sept. 4, 2014, according to the complaint.


A reverse stock split managed to raise the share price above the NASDAQ's $1 listing
requirement, but


The utter failure of CHOP's directors and officers to make any clarifying disclosures
since September 4, 2014, regarding CHOP's purported antiquities purchase has
caused the investing public's total loss of confidence in CHOP's corporate
governance…


We could find no response to the lawsuit from CHOP but recent court filings say more time
has been allowed, because company managers in China have not yet been served the
legal papers.


Steel surplus exists in China and if CHOP returns to the steel business, margins will
likely continue to be razor thin.


Investors can see that CHOP's porcelain affection is related to sales that have been
decimated by a 9 percent drop in steel prices and a 97 percent drop in sales volume.


The chief executive describes the perilous situation this way:


Given the continuing unfavorable sentiment towards China's steel industry and
uncertain outlook, our operations continue to be streamlined to mitigate operational
risks generated by industry-wide excess capacity, weak demand in prices and
restricted access to credit.


Researchers who wrote "China's Steel Industry," say that the decentralized and dispersed
steel industry is concerning Chinese policy-makers about the ability to exploit economies
of scale. It says most large steel producers are state-owned. Additionally, more than 660
companies produce crude steel and thousands of other firms produce finished steel and
steel-related products.


CHOP's CEO quoted experts who said,


The steel industry will need at least three additional years to realize actual recovery
in the balance of supply and demand.

The glut of steel has been even more debilitating to CHOP because the margins are razor
thin - about 5 percent.


But maybe steel margins don't really matter, anyway, if CHOP is now in the Chinese
porcelain business.


Competitors outdistance CHOP


Investors can see that China-based steel companies China Precision Steel
(NASDAQ:CPSL) and Sutor Technology Group (SUTR) are unimpressive anyway, but
recent troubles have made CHOP look even worse.

Institutional interest? No….


We always feel some comfort when big names hold a significant portion of a stock. That's
not case with CHOP.


A major shareholder and director, Harry Edelson - who has received $10,000 monthly
since 2010 for "helping to promote awareness of the company" - used Warren Buffett's
name in an interesting headline for a piece boldly promoting CHOP, here. Mr. Edelson
said the "down side for CHOP appears minimal while the upside is high."


But it's obvious that there are no Berkshire Hathaways or other big names and very little
institutional interest overall, as institutional shareholders hold only a sliver of the stock -
about 3 percent. See below:

Meanwhile, CHOP has no analyst coverage other than allchinastocks.com, which rates it
a "sell."


Conclusion


CHOP's recently screaming stock price is not justified, particularly in light of the sudden
switch from steel to 1,000-year old ornaments. There's no guarantee CHOP's porcelain is
authentic or valuable (concerns about fraud have damaged the Chinese art market
previously) or, as the company noted here, that it will profit if it can manage to auction off
the porcelain in a timely fashion.


With the low cash position and excessive cash burn, the company is likely preparing for a
potentially dilutive stock offering in hopes it can hold out until the steel business returns -
years in the future by their own admission. Of course, if it were to somehow pull out of this
mess, what's to keep CHOP from becoming another state-owned business?


We believe CHOP is shattering and investors should prepare for the stock to get chopped
to bits - to nickels and dimes per share.

The class action lawsuits or the Nasdaq minimum bid price violation are no longer an issue now that stock price is
above $3 a share. A lot of these recent articles can be credited to panic due to short squeeze caused by the recent
the price peak as there was no such attention when the stock price was at $1 or below. CHOP has a book value of
$30 despite a low cash reserves so it should be able to secure bank funding when needed. Also did you notice China
antique is selling at record highs these years?

You're investing in the ultimate black box since nobody has any idea what their antiques are worth or if they're even
real. Given they've been such great managers of their steel business (NOT!) one has to wonder whether they have a
warehouse full of the Chinese equivalent of Beanie Babies? Have you seen an independent appraisal anywhere of
their holdings?

CHOP is my biggest investment at the moment. It was before it fell and now it still is after it's gone up.


They said in their statements they had the collection appraised by a third party. That's enough for me. If they
say they have $1 billion worth in antique I expect they have at least $300 milllion. The estimates can't be
THAT far off. Seeing some pieces sell for nearly $20 million like the one in that link, it's hard to NOT believe
they have what they say they have.

It IS a strange investment for a steel company. But it's also old news, reported several months ago. It is also pretty
obvious that an investor holding a short position would not be thrilled with a recent price rise and would try to bring it

down by rehashing old news. The real question is, why did it go up? Is it a reflection of value of that porcelain, going
private speculation, or something else?

What brought it up is three days of 2 million volume each bought off the market. Now a follow-up question is,
WHO bought those stocks?

Good luck with shorting $21M company with ultra low 3.4M float. If the porcelain story is real, you're toast in a blink of
an eye.

If CHOP can go from $0.60 to $4 on no news then CNTF can easily go from $1 to $5 on the back of good news
coming out the company. You can read my latest articles on China Techfaith (CNTF) at http://bit.ly/1AAghM9 and
http://bit.ly/1F2aohS

CNTF is one of the best stocks in the world on the grounds it has cash reserves many times its book value.
Good luck to Apple gaining 4000 billion of cash. But so far it really hasn't done much to boost the company...


On a more positive note, hope the people shorting CHOP bought back their shares, cause it's about time for
another rally. Stock up +20% at $2,20!

CHOP has now missed the deadline to file their annual report and now faces delisting from nasdaq. I would not buy
this. Anyone else have comments on this?


18 May 2015, 11:02 AM


Nahodny Okoloiduci
A non event. Happened in 2012, too. They have 15 days of grace period to file 20-F.


19 May 2015, 02:48 AM

15 days from April 30. So they missed the 15 day deadline on May 15th
