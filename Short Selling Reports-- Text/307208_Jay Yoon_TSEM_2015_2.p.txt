Tower	Semiconductor:	The	Empty	Bullishness	Of	Ascendiant	Capital
Feb.	9,	2015	2:24	PM	ET73	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


Cody	Acree	from	Ascendiant	Capital	released	a	rebuttal	to	my	TSEM	short	thesis
which	contained	a	number	of	misguided	statements.


Contrary	to	Mr.	Acree’s	beliefs,	Non-GAAP	EPS	is	a	poor	measure	of	the	true	cash
generation	of	the	business,	because	it	completely	excludes	depreciation	which	is
linked	to	capex.


His	estimate	that	the	Panasonic	JV	will	provide	$300mm	to	$400mm	of	incremental,
high-margin	revenue	is	overstated	by	~$150mm.


Mr.	Acree’s	assertion	that	dilution	is	not	a	big	issue	is	wrong	in	my	opinion.	Severe
dilution	over	the	years	has	greatly	limited	TSEM’s	future	per	share	earnings	power.


His	positive	comments	about	CEO	Russell	Ellwanger	appear	to	be	very	misguided.
Mr.	Ellwanger	has	consistently	enriched	himself	with	pay	and	options	at	the	expense
of	shareholders.


In	my	first	article	on	Tower	Semiconductor	(NASDAQ:TSEM),	I	argued	that	the	company
was	an	excellent	short	opportunity	for	the	following	reasons:


Inflated	earnings	due	to	the	exclusion	of	depreciation	from	Non-GAAP	financials
Severe	and	consistent	shareholder	dilution	which	greatly	limits	TSEM's	future	earnings
potential
Management's	history	of	over-promising	and	under-delivering	while	enriching
themselves	at	the	expense	of	shareholders
Overly	rich	valuation	given	the	Company's	relatively	weak	competitive	position	and
historical	performance


On	February	4th,	Ascendiant	Capital	Markets'	analyst	Cody	Acree	released	a	response	to
my	article	on	TSEM.	In	his	statements	to	StreetInsider,	he	refuted	various	key	points	of	my
short	thesis.	Overall,	his	response	contained	factual	errors	and	misguided	arguments.	I
have	provide	below	a	detailed	analysis	of	the	key	points	of	Mr.	Acree's	rebuttal.

Point	#1:	It	Is	Proper	To	Exclude	Depreciation	From	Non-GAAP	Financials


In	Mr.	Acree's	opinion,	TSEM	is	justified	in	excluding	the	entire	amount	of	depreciation
from	its	Non-GAAP	financials.	Provided	below	is	a	quote	from	the	StreetInsider	article
which	touches	upon	his	views	on	the	depreciation	issue:


Acree	notes	the	primary	point	of	the	piece	was	the	discussion	of	the	exclusion	of
depreciation	and	amortization	from	earnings,	and	while	this	has	been	a	topic	for
some	time,	institutional	investors	have	understood	that	cash	earnings	are	what
constitutes	valuation,	not	a	non-cash	accounting	entry	that	is	primarily	used
to	reduce	taxes	and	therefore	increase	cash.


Mr.	Acree	argues	that	TSEM's	definition	of	Non-GAAP	EPS	is	an	accurate	reflection	of	the
cash	earnings	of	the	business.	Based	on	the	Company's	historical	performance,	I	believe
this	is	a	completely	misguided	assertion.	Provided	below	is	the	Company's	historical
financials	from	FY	2010-YTD	FY	2014.	This	same	table	was	provided	in	my	first	article	on
TSEM.
7/18/2019 Tower Semiconductor: The Empty Bullishness Of Ascendiant Capital - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2899256-tower-semiconductor-the-empty-bullishness-of-ascendiant-capital 3/12


Based	on	the	information	provided	in	the	figure	above,	it	is	clear	to	see	that	TSEM's	Non-
GAAP	EPS	metric	is	a	very	poor	measure	of	the	cash	earnings	of	the	business.	From	FY
2010	to	YTD	FY	2014,	the	Company	generated	a	cumulative	FCF	loss	of	$37mm.	At	the
same	time,	Non-GAAP	EPS	was	meaningfully	positive	every	single	year.	For	example,	in
FY	2011	the	Company	reported	Non-GAAP	EPS	of	$2.37	while	reporting	a	FCF	loss	of
$9.2mm.	As	an	another	example,	in	FY	2012	the	Company	reported	Non-GAAP	EPS	of
$1.82	while	reporting	a	FCF	loss	of	$0.62.	As	I	made	clear	in	my	prior	article,	the	reason
why	there	is	such	a	large	disconnect	between	the	Non-GAAP	EPS	and	FCF	results	is
because	of	the	exclusion	of	depreciation.	Capex	is	one	of	the	largest	cash	expenses	for
TSEM's	business.	The	Company	has	spent	~$100mm	per	year	on	capex	since	FY	2010.
By	excluding	depreciation	entirely,	the	Company's	Non-GAAP	EPS	results	fail	to	take	into
account	any	capex-related	expenses.	Thus,	TSEM's	Non-GAAP	financials	are	a	poor
measure	of	the	cash	generation	of	the	Company.


Furthermore,	semiconductor	industry	professionals	and	research	analysts	who	cover	the
sector	agree	with	my	views	on	this	issue.	For	example,	in	his	reports	on	Taiwan
Semiconductor	(NYSE:TSM)	and	United	Microelectronics	(NYSE:UMC),	Eric	Chen	from
UBS	includes	the	entire	amount	of	depreciation	in	his	Non-GAAP	EPS	calculation.	For
some	odd	reason,	Mr.	Acree	and	other	analysts	who	cover	TSEM	disagree	with	the
industry	standard.	As	I	noted	in	my	prior	article,	all	semiconductor	foundries	include	the
whole	amount	of	depreciation	in	their	Non-GAAP	financials	regardless	of	whether	capex	is
higher	or	lower	than	depreciation.	In	fact,	all	semiconductor	companies	with	their	own	fabs
(Skyworks	(NASDAQ:SWKS),	Micron	(NASDAQ:MU),	Texas	Instruments	(NASDAQ:TXN),
etc.)	include	depreciation	in	the	same	manner.	TSEM	should	be	no	different.


Point	#2:	The	Panasonic	JV	Will	Provide	$300MM	to	$400MM	of	High-Margin,
Incremental	Revenue


In	his	comments	to	StreetInsider,	Mr.	Acree	stated	the	following	in	reference	to	the
Panasonic	JV:


I	believe	the	Panasonic	JV	will	eventually	add	$300-$400	million	in	incremental
revenue	at	60-70%	gross	margins.


Mr.	Acree's	statements	regarding	the	incremental	revenue	capacity	of	the	Panasonic	JV
are	incorrect	based	on	data	provided	by	the	Company.	The	Panasonic	JV	has	a	total
estimated	annual	revenue	capacity	of	$600mm	to	$650mm.	Approximately	$400mm	of
that	capacity	will	be	used	to	produce	low-margin	Panasonic	products.	The	remaining
$200mm	to	$250mm	of	incremental	capacity	will	be	available	to	produce	higher	margin

products	to	customers	outside	of	Panasonic.	The	estimation	of	$200mm	to	$250mm	of
incremental	capacity	has	been	confirmed	by	management	at	various	points.	For	example,
during	an	interview	with	Bloomberg	TV,	CEO	Russell	Ellwanger	stated	the	following:


The	JV	can	produce	(a	total	of)	$600,	$650mm	on	that	range…


Mr.	Ellwanger	believes	that	the	JV	will	be	able	to	produce	an	estimated	$600mm	to
$650mm	of	total	revenue.	Based	on	this	estimate,	it	appears	that	the	incremental	revenue
capacity	of	the	JV	is	in	fact	just	$200mm	to	$250mm.	However,	based	on	additional
comments	provided	by	management,	it	appears	that	the	incremental	revenue	capacity
may	actually	be	less	than	$200mm.	For	example,	during	TSEM's	Q2	2014	earnings	call,
management	stated	the	following	in	regards	to	the	incremental	JV	capacity:


…we	indicated	that	we	can	be	additional	$150	million	to	$200	million	at	full	capacity
additional…	but	$200	million	is	the	maximum	possible.	So,	this	will	be	in	very	high
incremental	margins	to	gather	the	valuable	growth...


Thus,	based	on	various	comments	provided	by	management,	it	appears	that	the
incremental	revenue	capacity	of	the	JV	is	anywhere	between	$150mm	and	$250mm.
As	a	result,	Mr.	Acree's	estimation	of	$300mm	to	$400mm	of	incremental	revenue
capacity	is	overstated	by	at	least	$150mm.	As	I	mentioned	in	my	prior	article,	investors
and	research	analysts	have	grossly	over-estimated	the	profit	potential	of	the	Panasonic
JV.	Mr.	Acree's	factually	incorrect	assumptions	about	the	available	JV	capacity	are	a
perfect	example	of	this.


Mr.	Acree	is	also	overly	optimistic	in	his	belief	that	the	JV	capacity	can	be	filled	to	full
capacity	relatively	quickly.	Consider	the	fact	that	the	Nishiwaki	fab	was	purchased	in	2011,
and	after	three	years,	they	were	only	able	to	fill	30%	of	the	fab.	Furthermore,	the	majority
of	this	revenue	was	from	Micron	who	had	committed	to	the	plant	for	a	limited	time	period.
What	does	this	mean?	It	means	that	nobody	wanted	what	TSEM	was	selling	in	their
foundry.	To	be	blunt,	30%	utilization	is	simply	horrendous	and	is	almost	unheard	of	for	a
foundry	during	a	period	of	ever-increasing	demand.	To	make	matters	worse,	the	Company
lost	over	$100mm	while	trying	to	fill	the	fab.	The	reason	is	that	the	Company	had	to	invest
capital	for	equipment	and	other	upgrades	for	the	facility.	I	estimate	that	the	capital
investment	was	between	$70mm	to	$80mm	based	on	public	filings.	This	is	in	addition	to
the	initial	investment	of	$60mm	that	TSEM	paid	to	Micron.	Based	on	the	Nishiwaki
example,	I	believe	that	TSEM	will	also	have	trouble	filling	the	Panasonic	JV.	In	addition	to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2899256-tower-semiconductor-the-empty-bullishness-of-ascendiant-capital 5/12


this,	it	is	likely	that	TSEM	will	have	to	spend	a	significant	amount	of	capital	to	upgrade	the
facility	and	fill	the	plant.	Thus,	the	Panasonic	JV	could	quickly	become	a	burden	on	the
business.


Point	#3:	Ongoing	Share	Dilution	Has	Little	Impact	On	TSEM's	Future	Earnings
Potential


In	regards	to	share	dilution,	Mr.	Acree	had	the	following	to	say:


As	to	the	projected	share	count	and	the	associated	impact	to	interest	payments
related	to	bond	conversion.	Some	investors	may	choose	to	treat	the	timing	of
conversion	and	dilution	differently,	but	we	believe	this	is	a	logical	approach	and
any	accelerated	dilution	wouldn't	dramatically	change	the	company's	earnings
ability…	Please	also	remember	that	if	all	shares	are	considered	converted,	the
company's	debt	reduces	considerably,	and	hence	the	interest	payments.


Based	on	these	statements,	it	appears	that	Mr.	Acree	does	not	believe	TSEM's	bloated
fully	diluted	share	count	will	limit	the	Company's	future	earnings	potential.	I	believe	that	his
statements	do	not	hold	much	weight	for	various	reasons.	First	off,	Mr	Acree	does	not	even
acknowledge	that	his	estimate	for	TSEM's	fully	diluted	share	count	was	severely
understated.	In	his	November	2014	report	on	TSEM,	he	estimated	that	the	Company's
fully	diluted	share	count	is	~90mmm.	In	actuality,	as	has	been	confirmed	by	TSEM's
management,	the	Company's	current	fully	diluted	share	count	is	over	104mm.	Thus,	Mr.
Acree	is	using	a	fully	diluted	share	count	that	is	understated	by	over	14mm	shares.


In	addition	to	using	the	wrong	share	count,	based	on	the	statements	provided	above,	Mr.
Acree	seems	to	believe	that	the	timing	of	dilution	is	more	important	than	the	actual	amount
of	shares	outstanding.	This	line	of	thinking	makes	little	sense	in	my	opinion.	The	vast
majority	of	the	Company's	dilutive	instruments	will	convert	to	shares	over	the	next	two
years.	Thus,	regardless	of	exact	timing,	the	fact	remains	that	the	Company's	share	count
will	explode	over	the	next	couple	years.	Such	a	large	amount	of	shares	outstanding	will
greatly	limit	the	Company's	future	earnings	potential.	In	order	to	illustrate	this	point,	I	have
provided	below	my	financial	projections	for	TSEM.	These	same	projections	were	provided
in	my	prior	article	on	TSEM.
7/18/2019 Tower Semiconductor: The Empty Bullishness Of Ascendiant Capital - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2899256-tower-semiconductor-the-empty-bullishness-of-ascendiant-capital 6/12


For	FY	2017,	I	have	assumed	that	the	Company	is	able	to	fully	utilize	its	facilities	and	hit
its	aggressive	target	of	$1.2Bn	of	revenue.	To	Mr.	Acree's	point	about	interest	expenses
dropping	following	the	conversion	of	its	debt	instruments,	it	is	worth	noting	that	I	have
assumed	just	$10mm	of	interest	expenses	in	FY	2017.	As	shown	above,	even	if	TSEM	is
able	to	meet	management's	lofty	projections,	the	Company	will	still	only	generate
less	than	$1	of	EPS	in	FY	2017.	Thus,	irrespective	of	when	shares	are	converted	over
the	next	couple	of	years,	the	fact	remains	that	the	Company's	severe	dilution	of
shareholders	has	greatly	limited	its	earnings	potential.	Also,	keep	in	mind	that	these
projections	are	very	optimistic.	I	believe	that	TSEM	will	struggle	to	achieve	management's
revenue	targets	given	the	Company's	poor	execution	history.	Also,	gross	margins	of
37.5%	in	FY	2017	might	be	overly	optimistic	given	that	TSEM's	gross	margin	has	not
exceeded	37%	over	the	past	five	years.	Finally,	I	am	assuming	only	a	slight	increase	in
share	count	which	is	generous	given	the	Company's	severe	dilution	of	shareholders	over
the	years.


Given	the	Company's	past	history,	I	believe	that	further	dilution	is	likely	in	the	near	future.
For	example,	it	is	likely	that	TSEM	will	continue	to	award	an	overly	generous	amount	of
stock	options	to	management.	In	FY	2013	alone,	the	Company	awarded	5.4mm	options	to
management	which	represented	over	10%	of	the	basic	shares	outstanding.	Also,	given

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2899256-tower-semiconductor-the-empty-bullishness-of-ascendiant-capital 7/12


the	fact	that	TSEM	has	generated	a	cumulative	FCF	loss	of	$37mm	since	FY	2010,	there
is	a	good	chance	that	the	Company	will	need	a	cash	injection	if	the	business	continues	to
perform	to	its	historical	average.	These	dilutive	actions	will	further	pressure	earnings
growth	and,	in	turn,	the	stock	price.	To	conclude	this	section,	I	have	provided	below	a
chart	which	illustrates	TSEM's	share	price	and	basic	share	count	trend	over	the	years.	It	is
quite	shocking	to	see	just	how	much	shareholders	have	lost	over	the	years	and	the
degree	to	which	they	have	been	diluted.	Note	that	the	share	count	and	stock	price	data
have	been	adjusted	for	the	15	to	1	reverse	share	split	completed	on	August	6,	2012.


Point	#4:	CEO	Russell	Ellwanger	Has	A	"Thoughtful	And	Genuine	Demeanor"


Perhaps,	the	most	misguided	comments	that	Mr.	Acree	provided	in	response	to	my	article
were	his	statements	regarding	CEO	Russell	Ellwanger.	I	have	provided	his	comments
regarding	TSEM's	CEO	below:


I	find	him	to	be	an	exceptional	leader,	with	a	thoughtful	and	genuine	demeanor.	He
has	successfully	reshaped	the	company	and	put	it	in	a	position	for	significant
revenue	and	earnings	growth.	Astute	investors	have	recognized	this	and	are
benefiting	from	his	efforts.


I	am	a	firm	believer	that	actions	speak	louder	than	words.	As	a	result,	I	simply	cannot
agree	with	Mr.	Acree's	superficial	statements	about	Mr.	Ellwanger.	Based	on	his	past
actions,	Mr.	Ellwanger	has	demonstrated	tremendous	self-interest	and	little	regard	for
shareholders.	For	example,	as	I	discussed	in	detail	in	my	prior	article,	management
received	a	total	of	5.4mm	options	in	FY	2013.	These	options	represented	over	10%	of	the
basic	shares	outstanding	and	were	issued	when	the	Company's	stock	had	declined	from
7/18/2019 Tower Semiconductor: The Empty Bullishness Of Ascendiant Capital - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2899256-tower-semiconductor-the-empty-bullishness-of-ascendiant-capital 8/12


over	$20	to	below	$5	per	share.	For	some	reason,	Mr.	Ellwanger	and	management	felt
that	accepting	such	an	unusually	large	amount	of	options	was	acceptable	despite	the
severe	decline	in	TSEM's	share	price.	In	addition	to	this	incident,	as	I	also	discussed	in	my
prior	article,	Mr.	Ellwanger	willingly	accepted	a	bonus	for	FY	2012	even	though	the	bonus
had	not	been	approved	by	shareholders.


These	incidences	alone	reflect	very	poorly	on	Mr.	Ellwanger's	character	and	call	into
question	his	commitment	to	shareholders.	To	my	surprise,	after	conducting	further
diligence,	I	discovered	that	Mr.	Ellwanger	has	been	consistently	acting	in	this	manner	ever
since	he	took	over	as	CEO.	For	example,	consider	the	following	statement	provided	in
TSEM's	FY	2006	20F	detailing	generous	stock	option	grants	that	were	awarded	to	Mr.
Ellwanger:


…in	May	2006,	our	Audit	Committee	and	Board	of	Directors	approved	the	grant	of
options	to	Mr.	Ellwanger	in	addition	to	the	options	granted	to	him	in	April	2005,	such
that	in	total,	he	will	hold	options	to	purchase	shares	that	represent	4%	of	our
issued	and	outstanding	shares	on	a	fully	diluted	basis	during	the	two-year
period	beginning	May	16,	2006…


In	FY	2005	and	FY	2006,	Mr.	Ellwanger	received	options	totaling	almost	4%	of	the
fully	diluted	shares	of	the	Company.	As	a	result,	by	the	end	of	FY	2006,	Mr.	Ellwanger
owned	a	grand	total	of	14.9mm	options.	This	is	quite	simply	an	absurd	amount	of
options.	Consider	the	fact	that	Taiwan	Semiconductor	issued	a	grand	total	of	17mm
shares	in	FY	2013,	which	represented	less	than	0.1%	of	the	total	outstanding	Taiwanese
denominated	shares.	Thus,	in	a	period	of	less	than	two	years,	Mr.	Ellwanger	by	himself
received	option	grants	that,	on	a	percentage	basis,	were	over	1000%	greater	than	the
entire	amount	of	options	granted	by	TSM	to	all	of	its	employees.	It	looks	even	more	worse
when	you	consider	the	fact	that	TSM	has	consistently	outperformed	TSEM	year-after-year.
Also,	Mr.	Ellwanger	accepted	these	options	at	a	time	when	the	Company	had	performed
especially	poorly.	During	a	3-year	timespan,	TSEM's	share	price	had	declined	from	$7.89
per	share	at	the	end	of	FY	2003	to	$1.71	per	share	at	the	end	of	FY	2006.	For	some
reason,	just	like	in	FY	2013,	Mr.	Ellwanger	felt	accepting	such	a	large	option	grant	was
appropriate	despite	the	severe	losses	that	shareholders	had	incurred.


Even	more	puzzling	is	the	fact	that	Mr.	Ellwanger's	options	include	an	anti-dilution
provision.	The	following	quote	from	TSEM's	FY	2006	20F	describes	the	additional
options	that	Mr.	Ellwanger	was	issued	due	to	dilutive	events:



http://secfilings.nasdaq.com/filingFrameset.asp?FileName=0001178913-07-001236%2Etxt&FilePath=%5C2007%5C06%5C25%5C&CoName=TOWER+SEMICONDUCTOR+LTD&FormType=20-F&RcvdDate=6%2F25%2F2007&pdf=
7/18/2019 Tower Semiconductor: The Empty Bullishness Of Ascendiant Capital - Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (NASDAQ:TSEM) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2899256-tower-semiconductor-the-empty-bullishness-of-ascendiant-capital 9/12


…As	of	May	31,	2007,	due	to	dilutive	events,	approximately	an	additional	9.3	million
options	were	granted	to	our	CEO…


Call	me	crazy,	but	there	appears	to	be	a	conflict	of	interest	here.	If	TSEM	performs
poorly	and	has	to	issue	shares	to	support	the	business,	Mr.	Ellwanger	will	actually
benefit	financially	by	receiving	more	options.	In	other	words,	financially	he	is	more
incentivized	to	dilute	shareholders	rather	than	protect	shareholder	value	and	minimize
dilution.	Until	TSEM,	I	had	never	seen	an	executive	stock	option	plan	which	included	an
anti-dilution	provision.


Unfortunately,	Mr.	Ellwanger's	pattern	of	irresponsible	behavior	appeared	once	again	in
FY	2009.	The	following	is	a	quote	from	TSEM's	FY	2009	20F:


In	June	2009,	the	Board	approved	a	grant	to	the	CEO	under	Tower's	2009	Employee
Share	Incentive	the	Plan	(the	"plan")	to	purchase	8.5	million	ordinary	shares.	These
options	are	exercisable	at	an	exercise	price	of	$0.29.


By	this	point,	it	should	be	obvious	to	anyone	that	there	is	a	recurring	pattern	going	on
here.	Mr.	Ellwanger	is	taking	advantage	of	every	opportunity	to	cash-in	on	low	stock	prices
at	the	expense	of	shareholders.	In	FY	2009,	TSEM	shares	were	trading	at	nearly	an	all-
time	low	at	a	price	below	$0.30.	The	fact	that	Mr.	Ellwanger	accepted	a	grant	of	over
8.5mm	options	despite	such	poor	performance	once	again	shows	total	disregard	for
shareholders.	Thus,	based	on	all	of	these	examples	of	irresponsible	behavior,	I	flat-out
disagree	with	Mr.	Acree's	assertion	that	Mr.	Ellwanger	has	acted	in	a	"thoughtful	and
genuine"	manner.	In	reality,	Mr.	Ellwanger	has	willingly	received	millions	upon
millions	of	compensation	from	pay	and	options,	while	shareholders	have
continually	suffered	losses	year-after-year.


I	also	believe	Mr.	Acree	is	mistaken	in	his	belief	that	investors	have	benefitted	from	Mr.
Ellwanger's	efforts	over	the	years.	Based	on	the	share	price	performance,	investors	in
TSEM	have	collectively	lost	millions	since	Mr.	Ellwanger	took	over	in	May	2005.	Attached
below	is	a	stock	price	chart	comparing	the	performance	of	TSEM	versus	the	S&P	500	and
the	Semiconductor	ETF	(NYSEARCA:SMH)	since	May	2005.

As	shown	above,	TSEM's	share	price	has	declined	by	over	39%	since	May	2005.	At	the
same	time,	the	S&P	500	has	appreciated	over	76%	and	the	SMH	has	appreciated	almost
64%.	Based	on	this	comparison,	it	is	clear	that	Mr.	Ellwanger	has	done	a	poor	job	of
increasing	shareholder	value.	Thus,	it	is	even	more	puzzling	as	to	why	he	has	been
compensated	so	handsomely	during	this	time	period.	He	has	constantly	mentioned	that
their	strategy	of	acquiring	cheap	capacity	provides	them	with	an	advantage	over
competitors.	However,	as	shown	by	the	sharp	appreciation	in	the	SMH	index,	TSEM's
performance	has	continually	lagged	behind	the	overall	industry.	Also,	for	comparison
purposes	to	the	foundry	industry,	Taiwan	Semiconductor's	share	price	has	increased	over
180%	since	May	2005.


Based	on	actions	and	results,	I	strongly	disagree	with	Mr.	Acree's	claims	that	Mr.
Ellwanger	has	been	a	thoughtful	and	genuine	leader	who	has	created	value	for
shareholders.	Mr.	Acree	seems	to	be	basing	his	opinion	of	Mr.	Ellwanger	off	of	superficial
observations	as	opposed	to	real	facts.	It	is	always	better	to	make	assessments	based	on
factual	information	rather	than	perception.	Based	on	what	I	have	described	about	Mr.
Ellwanger	in	this	section,	I	believe	that	most	investors	will	agree	with	my	assessment.
Unfortunately,	this	is	just	scratching	the	surface	in	regards	to	Mr.	Ellwanger	and
management's	behavior.	I	will	provide	more	detail	in	this	regard	in	my	upcoming	article.


Conclusion


As	I	have	shown,	Mr.	Acree's	rebuttal	to	my	short	thesis	appears	to	be	of	little	substance.	I
am	dumbfounded	as	to	why	Mr.	Acree	believes	depreciation	is	not	a	real	expense	for
TSEM's	business.	As	someone	who	covers	the	semiconductor	industry,	he	should	know
that	it	is	industry	standard	to	include	depreciation	in	Non-GAAP	financials.	I	also	find	it
hard	to	believe	that	an	analyst	who	has	spent	so	much	time	covering	TSEM	can	make	so
many	factually	incorrect	statements.	Mr.	Acree's	estimates	for	the	incremental	capacity	of

the	Panasonic	JV	and	TSEM's	fully	diluted	share	count	were	both	way	off	the	mark.
Finally,	his	positive	assessment	of	Mr.	Ellwanger	was	not	based	on	any	factual
information.	Based	on	Mr.	Ellwanger's	consistent	pattern	of	irresponsible	behavior	and
destruction	of	shareholder	value,	it	is	clear	that	he	has	acted	only	in	his	best	interest
rather	than	the	interest	of	shareholders.


Unfortunately	for	TSEM	longs,	this	is	only	the	tip	of	the	iceberg.	Over	the	past	few	days,	I
have	uncovered	additional	information	that	severely	undermine	management	and	the
Company's	credibility.	Based	on	this	new	information,	I	would	not	own	TSEM	at	any	price.
I	am	still	in	the	process	of	completing	my	due	diligence,	but	I	plan	on	releasing	a	fairly
comprehensive	article	on	my	findings	in	the	near	future.

Manoj	Madhavan,	Contributor
Jaret,	amnon2003,	jeffkad,	Westpark	and	others	-	Thank	you	for	taking	the	time	to	carefully	analyze	what	Jay	wrote
and	to	pick	apart	the	numerous	inconsistencies	and	factual	errors	in	his	two	articles	on	TSEM.	In	the	beginning,	Jay
tried	to	post	some	responses	that	included	numbers	and	"looked	good".	But	as	Jaret	and	others	began	to	pick	out
inaccuracies	and	errors	in	those	responses	as	well,	Jay	started	beginning	or	ending	every	response	with
"Management	is	disgusting	because	they	got	stock	options".	By	that	measure,	most	publicly	traded	companies	would
become	"un-investable"!!	At	this	point,	it	is	clear	to	me	that	Jay	(and	perhaps	one	or	more	hedge	funds	that	hired	him)
is	trying	to	drive	the	price	down	by	spreading	FUD	(aka	Fear	Uncertainty	and	Doubt).	He	is	stuck	in	a	losing	short
position	and	is	trying	to	spread	FUD	to	recover	from	the	loss.

Author’s	reply	» 	Manoj,


You	are	completely	missing	the	point.	I	am	not	objecting	to	management	receiving	stock	options.	Almost	every
public	company	issues	them.	I	have	a	problem	with	the	degree	and	manner	in	which	management	has
received	options.	The	company	approved	a	option	grant	program	of	10mm	shares	in	FY	2013.	5.4mm	were
issued	in	FY	2013.	THe	remaining	were	likely	issued	in	FY	2014.	This	represents	10%	of	the	fully	diluted
shares	of	the	company.	This	is	overly	excessive	and	borderline	stealing	from	the	shareholders.	To	make
matters	worse,	these	options	have	conveniently	been	issued	at	rock	bottom	stock	prices.	Hence,	the	timing	is
also	of	concern.	This	is	not	just	a	one-off	event.	This	happened	in	FY	2005,	FY	2006,	FY	2009,	and	FY	2013.


Again,	it	is	not	the	fact	that	they	are	receiving	options...it	is	the	amount	and	timing	of	the	options.
