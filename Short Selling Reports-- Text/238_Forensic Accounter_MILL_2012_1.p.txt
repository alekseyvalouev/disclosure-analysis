This Time Isn't Different - Miller Energy Is A Short
Sep. 28, 2012 2:45 PM ET30 comments
by: Forensic Accounter


Miller Energy Resources (NYSE:MILL) is an oil and gas exploration and production
company primarily focused on the Cook Inlet area of Alaska. On 12/10/2009, MILL
acquired Cook Inlet Energy, consisting of the former Alaskan assets of Pacific Energy
Resources, in a competitive bankruptcy auction, paying less than $5 million. Immediately
after, MILL wrote the value of the assets up to $480 million, booking a pre-tax gain on the
acquisition of $460 million.


This unusual transaction and the dubious background of Miller's management and
financial partners has been covered in articles from The Street Sweeper, and I would
recommend you read them for additional background information, however I believe a
brief history of these assets is useful. The Cook Inlet assets that Miller currently owns
were originally acquired and developed by Forcenergy in the late 90s. Forcenergy went
bankrupt and eventually merged with Forrest Oil Corp in 2000. Forest then sold the
Alaskan assets of Forcenergy to Pacific Energy in 2007, and Pacific Energy went bankrupt
in early 2009, finally selling a group of their Alaska assets to Miller Energy.


This article will take a closer look at the flawed assumptions MILL and their investors are
using to derive the company's reserve value, as well as the shaky financial footing the
company is currently on, both of which should concern current and potential investors in
MILL, especially if history repeats itself.


Reserve Report Assumptions


Since MILL is currently generating large losses, and low production relative to its current
market capitalization, it's clear that investors are valuing the company based primarily on
their undeveloped reserves, and those reserves' prospects for future, profitable
production. This could prove incredibly risky should current assumptions about the value
of these undeveloped reserves prove to be faulty.


MILL attached a reserve report by Ralph E. Davis Associates to their most recent 10-K
filing breaking out the reserves of their Alaskan properties (containing the vast majority of
the company's total reserves) in more detail.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/895011-this-time-isnt-different-miller-energy-is-a-short 2/13


The report breaks out reserves, and assumed future revenues, expense and cash flows
by developed-producing, developed non-producing, and undeveloped reserve categories.
This table is reproduced below:


The present value of the expected net income from Miller's proved reserves using a
discount rate of 10% is $446.726 million, which is likely what attracts investors to the
stock, even though 80% of this value is tied to the company's undeveloped reserves. As
an aside, it would likely be imprudent for investors to use a 10% discount rate when
valuing Miller's reserves since the company's cost of capital is much higher (their senior
debt has an interest rate of 18%).


From here, dividing the revenue and expense data points by the barrels of reserves can
highlight the per barrel operating assumptions utilized in the company's reserve report, the
result of which is displayed below. For example, the "Operating Costs / Boe" under the
"Producing" column is calculated by dividing the total operating costs under the producing
column and dividing it by the number of total barrels in the producing column.


Oddly, currently producing reserves have an assumed operating cost of $49.58 per barrel,
which is around what Miller has reported in their recent results, however proved
developed but non-producing reserves are expected to have far lower operating costs of
$13.31 per barrel, and undeveloped reserves are assumed to cost only $5.57 per barrel.
This seems absurdly low since operating costs of $5.57 per barrel would be amongst the
lowest in the country, especially when Forest Oil Corp noted that the Cook Inlet had higher
operating costs than other properties in the US.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/895011-this-time-isnt-different-miller-energy-is-a-short 3/13


Finally, the estimated development costs seem equally illogical. Capital costs for reserves
that are already developed but not currently producing are $19.32 per barrel, yet capital
costs for completely undeveloped reserves are assumed to somehow be less than a 1/2
the cost for developed non-producing costs. It is likely that both the capital costs and
operating costs for the company's undeveloped reserves will be far higher than is currently
assumed making the true present value of these assets a fraction of that assumed in the
report.


Miller's reserve assumptions have also received scrutiny from the SEC as demonstrated
by several CORRESP files over the last two years, ultimately requiring MILL to restate
their 2011 and 2010 reserves.


The best response from MILL bulls would be that as production increases, the company
will lower costs with scale. However, this ignores the fact Pacific Energy's Alaska division
(the predecessor assets that are now Miller's Alaskan assets) had operating costs of
$44.33 per barrel in 2009 (equivalent to Miller's operating costs per year in 2011) despite
producing more than 4,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (approximately 4 times larger
than Miller's current production rate).


Relative Valuation


Even if one ignores the company's long history of operating losses, and take Miller's
reserve assumptions at face value, assuming they are able to successfully raise the
massive amounts of capital required to fully convert their undeveloped reserves to
producing status without severely diluting shareholders, the company would still be
dramatically overvalued at today's price.


For example, Miller's proved reserves totaled 9.294 million barrels of oil equivalent
(NYSE:BOE) as of their most recent fiscal year end. Comparing this to the company's
current enterprise value (the sum of a company's market cap and their net debt) of $255
million, yields an EV / BOE of $27.43, meaning investors are valuing each barrel of
reserve (developed and undeveloped) at $27.43 for MILL. This is very expensive,
especially when compared to much larger, more diversified, and lower cost peers who
have already spent the capital to develop a much higher percentage of their reserves. The
following table compares MILL to Apache Corp (NYSE:APA), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN),
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Buccaneer Energy (NYSE:BCC).

Buccaneer Energy (trading on the Australian stock change under the ticker symbol BCC)
is the most directly comparable company. Buccaneer Energy is focused on the Cook Inlet
area of Alaska (the same area as MILL), and even uses the same company as MILL to
complete their reserve reports (Ralph E. Davis). Buccaneer actually has a greater amount
of proved reserves than MILL, and in the second quarter, had nearly equal production
levels, yet they trade for nearly 1/3 the valuation MILL does. If Miller's enterprise value fell
to the same level as Buccaneer's, MILL's stock price would fall by over 75% to $1.21 per
share.


Debt Troubles


MILL entered into a new debt facility with Apollo Investment Corporation on 6/29/2012.
The facility allows for an initial borrowing base of $55 million and initial availability of $40
million, with the remaining $15 million only available when MILL demonstrates that it can
raise $15 million in additional equity. MILL immediately borrowed the $40 million initially
available, and is seeking to unlock the remaining $15 million under the credit facility by
selling $15 million in preferred stock. The facility has an interest rate of 18%, which would
imply an interest expense of nearly $10 million annually (assuming $55 million is
eventually borrowed). This is far in excess of any historic operating earnings MILL has
generated thus far, calling into question their ability to service this debt. These fears were
confirmed in Miller's most recent quarterly report for the three months ending 7/31/2012, in
which the company said they expected to not be in compliance with the credit facility's
covenants on the first measurement date.


MILL claimed in their most recent earnings call that the upcoming covenant miss was due
to a simple delay in construction of their rig, but the company has been a serial offender in
over-promising and under-delivering on production growth. For example, looking at one of

the company's presentations from 2 years ago, they projected increasing production to
over 5,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day by the end of 2011. For the quarter ending
July 31, 2012 production averaged less than 1,000 boe / day.


On the earnings call, MILL disclosed their estimated capital spending levels once they
started the full drilling program would be $8 million a month, or $24 million a quarter. This
means that even with the additional $30 million in capital the company is seeking, it would
not provide for more than 4 months of drilling.


Preferred Stock


Investors buying into the company's recent preferred stock offerings should also be
concerned. MILL recently sold 25,750 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and issued
warrants to purchase 128,750 shares of common stock, exercisable at $5.28 per share, to
the purchasers of the preferred stock for gross proceeds of $2.575 million. The company
is currently in the process of offering series C preferred stock which will have a 10.75%
yield and will be convertible into shares of MILL at $10 / share. The issues listed above
should concern investors in each preferred class since they have a derivative exposure to
the stock (either through warrants or conversion features), and the company's ability to
service their credit facility directly impacts whether MILL can make cash payments on the
preferred stock.


As noted in the preferred stock prospectus, MILL is only allowed to make cash dividend
payments to holders of the preferred stock if they are in compliance with the Capital
Covenants of their credit facility, which as discussed earlier, MILL does not expect to meet
at the first measurement date. On 9/26/2012 MILL filed an amendment to their credit
facility that moves back the first covenant measurement date, and allows the company to
create a cash reserve from which the company can make preferred dividend payments for
one year, regardless of covenant violations. This piggy bank that has been set aside to
make one year of preferred dividend payments, might initially give the illusion that MILL
can service their debt and dividend payments, but ultimately this should not fill investors
with confidence.


Finally, potential preferred stock investors should ask themselves whether an at-risk 10-
12% in a subordinated, preferred stock is adequate compensation when Apollo is
receiving an 18% interest rate for a secured debt position.


Disclosure: I am short MILL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I wish you wrote the article in a more balanced fashion also discussing what could happen if MILL indeed doubled
their production by year end.


Yes, the management has been wrong about timelines and have under estimated the timelines with some initiatives
(e.g. RIG 35 or RU1) but at the end of the day - they've delivered, albeit late.


What would your position be if in the next month or so they announce RU1 is producing 500BOE/day? And RU3
before XMAS producing as much?


There are several very credible analysts that whole-heartily disagree with you and several funds that increased their
long positions recently.


Any article that's all bear and no bull looses much of it's credibility, especially coming from a short.

This is nothing but another attempt to discredit a company for your own profit making schemes. The writers and
publishers of this article and the websites displaying it, are despicable and should be held liable for their attacks
based on their own version and play/spin on facts. If you are and investor and have any sense of reality as to proper

people millions of dollars. The minute they drive mass selling, they begin buying. Thats make the reader losers and
the writers and publishers the beneficiaries of the ignorance they get you to buy (or sell) into!!!

Well....its a fact that Mill was already heavily shorted due to a broad industry short in the energy business. Its also a
fact that if Mill went up to $6 per share that there would be the biggest short squeeze in recent times. They are about
to double their production and that would drive the stock price way up. Interestingly enough that a lot of volume got
gobbled up on this news....that is all the shorts panic covering on pending production news. The timing of this report is
questionable and although if the author claims no interests in the company then I would question if his friends do.

This article is a complete garbage.


1. This short did his analysis in base of proven reserves. The whole project under way for Natural gas onshore
production at Otter and Olsen Creek, is reported like Possible undeveloped reserves.


The pipeline permit is almost complete, after a public hearing last month


http://bit.ly/TOldwG


Otter well #1 is complete, and it was reported on Alaska commission website on Sept. 9, and actually is under a
fracking process:


http://1.usa.gov/SrwHPi


These wells will be under production next spring, adding 500boe each.


2. Next wells producing again in Redoubt shoal, RU-1, RU-2 and RU-3 were classified as Proved undeveloped and
Proved non producing wells. The lower costs than Forrest`s cost are related with a very different Tax benefits
structure.


3. The Apollo agreement´s convenant compliance is an old story. It was reported in last CC, a delay in the apllication
of those mesaures. 
I believe you are extremely worried about a jump in production next month with RU-1 under production again.  
You should cover. This time, is different.

Another short attack full of innuendo. SEC has looked it over and says clean. Court threw out derivative case. Do
class action attorneys fund this sort of stuff or is just the shorts themselves?


Cook Inlet is subject of intense interest by much bigger, established exploration cos, Hilcorp for one who just moved
500k up to support the area.

Costs:


"Jeffery Connolly - Sidoti & Company


And David maybe before coming a little bit on what we expect to happen with per barrel basis as the Osprey platform
becomes more fully functional?


David Voyticky - Chief Financial Officer


Be glad to of course lease operating costs are basically a factor of your direct operating cost as well as production.
So, of course as production increases we would see our lease operating cost drop. Per every incremental barrel
increase we see a lease operating cost increasing by a little less than $2 a barrel. So, we’ve got fixed operating cost
we don’t really see that going up very much as we add new production. We do have some of the lowest lease
operating costs in the Inlet."

First of all the author got the purchase price wrong. The buyer, Miller, assumed liabilities that the accountants properly
added to the purchase price. That alone, raises the purchase price to many times what is stated in the article. Had the
author managed to read the 10-K, he would have found out the real purchase price, evidently researching the 10-K is
an advanced skill

On the reserve report, the author fails to reconcile the difference between gas production costs and oil production
costs. Miller has a lot of potential gas reserves and the mix of the two costs will give a blended average. Lots of gas
can easily lower the the production costs on the reserve reports.


Given that this author has lots of gas, its hard to see why he did not consider that Miller might also have a lot of gas
reserves.


29 Sep 2012, 11:25 PM

The operating losses come as a result of the start up situation. This company uses the successful efforts method of
accounting, which produces far more losses up front than does the full cost method. All Miller has to do if they want to
show profits is stop investing in the future and allow the production to pay off the loan.

That fact that Miller relied upon the rig people for the finishing dates of the construction of Rig 35 and that those very
experienced people missed their own deadline twice, and the first time it cost them a very large performance bonus
has escaped this author.


Such delays will raise costs and may hinder future profitablity and that remains to be seen whether Miller will recover
from these missed deadlines, but right now the injury seems rather minor.


When Miller opened the current well, it was filled with a lot of junk and makes one wonder what the previous operator
was doing. All you have to do is look at the list of stuff pulled from the well and you realize why someone went
bankrupt. Its amazing that it never occurred to Forest Oil to clean up the mess itself and see if that would result in
increased production.


But then again, why worry about facts when you can yell fire in a crowded theater and make money on the stampede.


29 Sep 2012, 11:31 PM

The real risks here is that the extra costs that will now be incurred will outweigh the benefits and cause the company
to fail. The answer to that should be known by next Spring, and with this company's experience and ability to
surmount obstacles, it should be given a chance to find out what kind of production it can get off the Osprey.


There is also a risk here that all this will go to their heads and they will not learn to live within their means and be
ready for the next oil price downturn, that also remains to be seen.


But this hatch job of an article really misses the big picture.

Lots of complaining here in the comments. Does no one care to actually refute the authors assumptions about all the
costing holes in the reserves? The head in the sand approach that most of you are taking is dangerous.

Obviously, You didn't read the comments. There is a couple of references about why the analysis should distinguish
between oil wells and gas wells.


There is a link related with the operative costs of Buccaneer in Cook inlet´s wells, below 10$/ boe.


I believe you are in the sand too. The sand of a short position without way out except to cover at higher prices.

Based upon replies above, I guess nearly all of you are long the stock - not that you tell us. As for me, I'm looking at it
after my broker advised a purchase. 
It seems to me that the stats can be used to demonstrate either case. And with the oil bulls starting to cover their
positions, is there going to be a fall in WTI/Brent? 
Oh and by the way - try not to get so hot under the collar/stressed over such reorts/assessments otherwise I'd be
inclined to look into the bourgeoning antiulcer drug makers! Have a nice day.

Dave,


You're giving the author and this article way too much credibility.


If you look at the chart on MILL YTD you will see the pattern 4 times (the current decline concludes the 4th
occurrence): the stock gets pumped to $5+ then gets dumped back to low $4.


This is the work of shorts that have a huge position (8.4Million shares shorts or 24% of float) - very little to do with this
article.


imo there's huge naked shorting going on here.

The Nov. 7 2012W North Slope oil and gas lease sale shows Alaska is on the more again with so many new players
and old one's coming back.

Alaska oil and gas industry has been very interesting to me as a smaller player since the 1980's. Over the last 27
years I learned how to survive for decades under a system of Alaska's crazy oil and gas laws that allowed only the
majors to record profits. Thank God that is now changing.


I have made lots of money in Alaskan oil and gas business but as a service to those that are making big things
happen in the Cook Inlet and the North Slope.


Most people don't know that in Alaska unlike any other oil state in the nation, that the majors produce around 99% of
the oil and have around 99% of the oil markets.


Over the last 5 years the majors have not been drilling many exploration wells and now the smaller oil companies are
moving in to fill the void and to help keep the Trans Alaska Pipeline from being shut down and keep Alaskans
working. Alaskans want smaller oil and gas companies to drill and keep the oil wealth from dying out and provide
many more high paying jobs.


So the state has just provided big tax credits in the Cook Inlet and they are really trying to encourage a big change to
enable more smaller competitors to profit like the majors do on the North Slope.


This legislative session we will see them make new laws that will give the North Slope some new drilling tax
incentives like the Cook Inlet now has, and many say the boom will begin on the Slope like we see in the Cook Inlet
as a result.


So what Miller is doing is breaking new ground and is a leader of this new exploration effort. Alaska is still rich with oil
but the policies of the past only enabled the majors to profit. This new 2012 election has given a mandate to support
smaller oil companies like Miller's Cook Inlet Energy to now produce more oil. This next Legislative session is about
provide some very nice drilling North Slope incentives this year to get Alaska back to being the Nation's number 1 oil
producer again.


Most people don't know this but Miller/Cook Inlet Energy may be the first smaller Independent to record a profit from
drilling, producing oil, transporting, and selling it due to the state's new incentive policies. This company has amazed
me with it's management ability to deal with many kinds of issues and get positive results.


The ability that they have to deal well with Alaska state government agencies is why I think this company can be the
next Arco of Alaska with many big successes. The people at the state's oil and gas agencies have a long history of
favoritism for the majors and almost obstruction of smaller competitors, that is becoming a thing of the past.


It is slow coming but I think with the type of management they have at CIE we will see them grow very profitable very
fast. I can see many reasons that in short order Miller will skyrocket with a new major oil discovery somewhere in
Alaska soon. They have what it takes.


The people in state government leaders know the management of Cook Inlet Energy and they work very well
together. David Hall has very good relationships with many good people in the state's oil and gas agencies and that is
key for success in Alaska's oil and gas Industry from my point of view!

There are many holes in Miller and those can be seen by some of the major issues in the filings, particularly the
quarterly and yearly statements. After really looking at all of the details, on top of the fact that it will take a ton of
money, and probably dilution, its difficult to trust management and that true value can really be attained with this
company
