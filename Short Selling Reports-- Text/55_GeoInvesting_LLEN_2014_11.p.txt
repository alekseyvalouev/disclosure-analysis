L&L Energy's DaPuAn And SuTsong Mines Shut Down, Historical
Production Called Into Question
May 13, 2014 12:00 PM ET2 comments
by: The GeoTeam


Summary


In response to recent mining accidents, the Yunnan Provincial Government issued a
suspension order listing 992 coal mines (including DaPuAn and SuTsong) with less
than 90k metric tons annual output.


Chinese government websites disclose much lower production capacity figures for
the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines than reported by L&L Energy.


We conclude that L&L has exaggerated the historical production and capacity of the
DaPuAn and SuTsong mines.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


As GeoInvesting originally reported here, two major coal-mining accidents recently
occurred (April 7, 2014 and April 21, 2014) in Qujing, Yunnan, resulting in the deaths of 35
people. Both accidents occurred in the vicinity of the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines that
L&L Energy (NASDAQ:LLEN) purports to own, as shown below:

Following a major accident, safety inspection checks and mine shutdowns in China could
last for a year or more. This was the case following the November 2011 Shizong Sizhuang
mine disaster that led to the 2012 closures of the Hong Xing coal washing facility and the
ZoneLin coking plant. Only after May 2013 did the coal production in the area recover.


Following the first accident, on April 15, 2014 the Yunnan Provincial Government ordered
the suspension of mining at 992 coal mines (the published list can be found here.) The
Yunnan Coalmine Safety Inspection Bureau summarized the suspension order as follows:


"On April 15, the Yunnan Provincial Government ordered all provincial coal mines
under 90,000 metric tons annual output are suspended for rectification, and also
published a list of the 992 coal mines suspended."


The DaPuAn and SuTsong Coal Mines are on the Suspension List

According to LLEN's SEC filings, the legal names of the DaPuAn and SuTsong coal mines
are "Shizong HengTai Coal Mining Co., Ltd. DaPuAn Mine" and "Luoping County A'ang
Town SuTsong Coal Mine." The full legal names of the two mines appear on page five of
the suspension list, as shown in the snapshot below:


LLEN Current Management Using The Same Playbook As Old Management?


According to the list, the Yunnan Provincial Government ordered the suspension of
production for both DaPuAn and SuTsong on April 15, 2014. Yet almost a month later
LLEN's management team still has not disclosed any 8-k filing regarding this issue.


Even more disturbing, since the government list contains coal mines with annual output
below 90,000 metric tons, LLEN's reported annual historical coal production of more than
90,000 metric tons from the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines is called into question.

The following table shows the coal production LLEN reported for each of the two mines for
the fiscal years ended April 30, 2009 through April 30, 2013 in its 10-K filings to the SEC:


DaPuAn SuTsong

2012 129,505 2012 95,456


2013 228,298 2013 131,707


LLEN's management needs to explain why the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines appear on
the government list of 992 suspended mines with <90,000 metric tons annual output.


Yunnan Coalmine Safety Inspection Bureau Website Reports the Capacity of the
DaPuAn and SuTsong Mines


Ever since its purported acquisition of the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines on May 1, 2008,
LLEN has repeatedly reported the production capacity of the two mines in its annual
reports as follows:


Mines Production Capacity (tons)


DaPuAn 150,000


SuTsong 90,000


LLEN's capacity figures are contradicted by recent reports published by the Yunnan
Coalmine Safety Inspection Bureau.

On March 18, 2014 the Yunnan Coalmine Safety Inspection Bureau published a table
titled "2014 Special Inspection of Coal Mine Safety Permit Holders with a List of Coal
Mines" that can be found by clicking the Chinese link provided on the Yunnan Coalmine
Safety website.


According to the table, excerpted below, the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines' designed
capacities are 90,000 and 30,000 metric tons, respectively.

Note: "Designed Capacity" is the theoretical annual capacity of the coalmine for
engineering purposes. "Effective Capacity" is the practical annual capacity of the
coalmine.


On November 22, 2013 the Yunnan Coalmine Safety Inspection Bureau published a table
titled "Yunnan Province Newly Built Expansion Projects Record Documents (until
2014.4.16)." The table can be found by clicking the Chinese link provided on the Yunnan
Coal Mine Safety Inspection website.


The SuTsong mine, No.45 on the table (excerpted below), had an original designed
capacity of 30,000 metric tons per year and was later approved to expand to 90,000
metric tons per year. According to an announcement on the Qujing City, Luoping County,
Ministry of Commerce website, the SuTsong mine planned to begin its expansion
construction at the end of 2012. According to the table set forth below from the Yunnan
Coal Mine Safety Inspection website, the construction period should take 17 months.


According to the Qujing Environmental Bureau, the SuTsong mine's environmental
approval date was January 14, 2014. Therefore we conclude that the SuTsong mine's
production capacity was still only 30,000 metric tons per year until early 2014.

Note: The DaPuAn mine did not appear on the government list of mine expansions.


GeoInvesting is aware that LLEN claims to exceed the production capacity of its mines.
Per LLEN's 2013 10-K:


"According to Chinese government regulation, a coal mine can produce up to the
production capacity set forth in the mining production permit. However, depending
on the market demand for coal, especially during the high demand season in the
winter, the local government does allow coal mines to produce more than the
production capacity that year or use the unused capacity from previous years
without giving specific written approval."


So just how much more coal production did LLEN report to the SEC compared to the
Chinese government reported capacity? Using the capacity for the DaPuAn and SuTsong
mines found on the various Chinese government websites, LLEN's overproduction was as
follows:


DaPuAn


Fiscal Year Ended April 30, Capacity (tons) Annual Production (tons) Overproduction (%)


2009 90,000 121,159 35%


2010 90,000 255,994 184%

2012 30,000 95,456 218%


2013 30,000 131,707 339%


Conclusion:


As we have shown, the Yunnan Provincial Government reacted to the recent major mining
accidents by issuing a suspension order listing 992 coal mines (including DaPuAn and
SuTsong) with <90k metric tons per year output. Various Chinese government websites
confirm lower production capacity figures for the DaPuAn and SuTsong mines than
reported by LLEN. Given these latest events we are left with the conclusion that LLEN has
exaggerated the historical production and capacity of the two mines.


Aside from the tragic circumstances that have brought to light yet additional
misrepresentation by LLEN, we continue to wait for the current management of LLEN to
step forward to give timely, accurate, investor-responsive information. Instead what we
have seen is a steady pace of more of the same. Against all of our hopes it appears clear
to us that the current management of LLEN is no better than the former management.

Wow! Look....another public service announcement.

I wish LLEN would finally respond to your 'public service announcements' 
I, for one, am really getting tired of it.. 
If you have anything more to say about LLEN then please put it all in one final article and be done with it.
