Did The CEO Of Herbalife Violate The Fair Disclosure Rule?
Dec. 26, 2012 3:45 AM ET44 comments
by: NA Account


We discussed three issues in our first report on Herbalife (NYSE:HLF). The report focused
on the company's violation of a California Court order, the Belgium pyramid scheme ruling
and the suspiciously high packaging fees levied on distributors.


Since Bill Ackman's presentation on December 20th, Herbalife has, to no one's surprise,
been on the defensive. CEO Michael Johnson made some phone calls last week that he
might just end up regretting. Here's a timeline of the chain of events, with further
discussion surrounding the seriousness of these potential violations.


Timeline


1. On December 20, 2012, noted hedge fund titan Bill Ackman accused Herbalife of
being a pyramid scheme during a presentation that lasted over three hours. Ackman's
presentation was attended by reporters and investors and it was streamed live on the
Internet.


2. In a press release dated December 24, 2012 Herbalife announced it will host an
Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York at 9:00 AM EST on January 10, 2013. The
press release notes that "Senior management will discuss the company's business in
detail" along with a "comprehensive response to investor questions on its business
model." This is being done in response to Ackman's presentation and pyramid scheme
allegations.


3. LA Times article dated December 21, 2012:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1081822-did-the-ceo-of-herbalife-violate-the-fair-disclosure-rule 2/15


Pressure for Johnson to take action intensified Friday as Herbalife's shares slid 19%
to $27.27. The stock has dropped 36% since Ackman first said Wednesday that he
was shorting the stock. It's down more than 60% from its peak this year.


With investors punishing his company's stock for a third consecutive day, the top
executive of Herbalife Ltd. sought to reassure shareholders Friday [December 21,
2012] that his company is not a pyramid scheme. Working from the firm's tony
headquarters in downtown Los Angeles, Herbalife chief Michael Johnson
telephoned institutional investors, including fund managers at Fidelity, disputing
highly publicized criticism from prominent New York hedge fund manager Bill
Ackman.


(Emphasis added)


4. As of July 31, 2012, Fidelity's various funds [collectively] held 17.1 million Herbalife
shares.


5. On December 24, 2012 (half trading day due to Holiday) 19.287 million Herbalife
shares traded; ending down 4.44% from the previous day.


6. Regulation FD Violation


On August 15, 2000, the SEC adopted Regulation FD to address the selective disclosure
of information by publicly-traded companies and other issuers. Regulation FD provides
that when an issuer discloses material nonpublic information to certain individuals or
entities-generally, securities market professionals, such as stock analysts, or holders of
the issuer's securities who may well trade on the basis of the information-the issuer must
make public disclosure of that information.


According to the LA times, Johnson's telephonic conversations with institutional investors,
including a fund manager at Fidelity, consists of "disputing highly publicized criticism" [Bill
Ackman's allegations and presentation].


Herbalife, including but not limited to Johnson, will not reveal Herbalife's version of the
facts "disputing highly publicized criticism" [Bill Ackman's allegations and presentation] to
members of the public, including any institutional investors not called by Johnson on
Friday, until January 10, 2013.


Discussion of Regulation FD and Rule 10b(5) Violations

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1081822-did-the-ceo-of-herbalife-violate-the-fair-disclosure-rule 3/15


Johnson had direct telephonic conversations with a fund manager for Fidelity and an
unidentified number of other institutional investors.


We have no way of knowing what information was given by Johnson to these large
holders of Herbalife's shares. However, it would seem clear to any reasonable person that
Johnson withheld any material information from Fidelity and the unidentified other
institutional investors that had the potential to cause these entities to dispose off their
positions in Herbalife.


In the aforementioned December 24, 2012 press release, Herbalife noted that "it has
retained Moelis & Company as its strategic advisor." It is noteworthy that Moelis &
Company are prominent in the field of Leveraged Buy-Outs ("LBO").


Johnson may have hinted (to Fidelity and the unidentified institutional investors) that
Herbalife is planning an LBO; which may have nudged these institutions into holding their
positions in Herbalife. Because Herbalife has concealed the actual conversation Johnson
had with Fidelity and the unidentified institutional investors, we have no way to determine
what non-public material information Johnson disclosed to these entities.


According to the LA Times article (note # 3 in the timeline above) Michael Johnson
telephoned institutional investors, including fund managers at Fidelity." Did Johnson call all
institution investors that maintain long positions in Herbalife; or, did Johnson select
specific institutional investors (perhaps based on their Herbalife holdings)?


Even if Herbalife issues an 8K revealing the fact that these private conversations occurred
on Friday; since these conversations were telephonic (as opposed to written) the public
will never know the specific back-and-forth conversations between Johnson and the fund
managers.


Bill Ackman has publicly stated that he intends to hold his short position (20 million
shares, according to Ackman) until Herbalife goes to zero. I believe that the total short
position on Herbalife is about 24 million shares.


We know that Johnson called the institutional investors for the purpose of "disputing
highly-publicized criticisms" of Herbalife [Ackman].


Perhaps Johnson's conversations with these institutional investors fell on deaf ears.


On December 24, 2012 (in a half day of trading) a little less than 20 million shares traded.
We can reasonably assume that Ackman was not participating in the market [Herbalife]
today. It is not unreasonable to suspect that either Fidelity or one of the other unidentified

Comments (44)


institutional investors who Johnson spoke with on Friday may have (either alone or
collectively) represented a majority of the 20 million shares traded.


Johnson is bound by the rules and regulations of the SEC, including but not limited to
Regulation FD and Rule 10b(5).


The other area of concern is that Herbalife has concealed the identity of the institutional
investors (other than Fidelity) who were the recipients of Johnson's non-public material
information.


While we are on the topic of Herbalife's regulation FD violations, let's talk about Tim
Ramey


Tim Ramey, a Senior Analyst with DA Davidson, has covered Herbalife for many years.
DA Davidson makes a market in Herbalife securities.


Only five days ago, Tim Ramey was on CNBC defending Herbalife. The disclosures
flashing on the screen (at around the 4 minute mark) indicate Ramey receives non-
investment banking compensation from Herbalife. Ramey also admits that he is a
distributor for Herbalife. Ramey has stated in the past that the only reason he signed up
as a Herbalife distributor is to be a recipient of the emails Herbalife routinely send its
distributors. We believe Ramey. We also believe Ramey when he says he never has, and
never will, participate as a distributor with Herbalife.


Notwithstanding the fact that Regulation FD expressly prohibits Herbalife from disclosing
"material nonpublic information to securities market professions, such as stock analysts" --
Herbalife provides Ramey will distributor emails which emails disclose information in
connection with Herbalife that is not available to members of the public.


Disclosure: I am short HLF. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

This is innuendo. Do you really think HL lawyers would let Johnson publicly break SEC rules at this point in the
game? You wouldn't be piling on to support a short position would you?

Well, apparently HLF's lawyers allowed him to go on CNBC and claim that he's got a report showing that 90%
of product sales are to consumers out of the distribution network. That's a critical statement given the FTC's
definition of a pyramid scheme, and since I suspect they don't at all track retail sales.


What he really has is a study done by Lieberman International (disclosed in the 2Q12 10Q) - a survey of
households in which 5.6m households said they had tried an HLF product in the last 90 days, while only 10%
of them claimed to be HLF distributors. The flaw there is that there is no quantification of volume. So the 90%
that weren't distributors could have bought 1 shake at a nutrition club while the 10% that were distributors
could have garages full of unsaleable product.


If Johnson's CNBC assertion was based on the Lieberman report, than he likely made a massive material
misstatement on national TV.


From the 2Q10 10Q: 2Q12 CC: We recently engaged Lieberman Worldwide Research, one of the top market
research companies in the world, to conduct a survey to help develop a better understanding of Herbalife
consumers in the U.S. This survey reported that there are approximately 5.6 million U.S. households that
bought Herbalife products in the last 90 days. Of this number, less than 10% of the households said they
were an Herbalife distributor. This further validates the degree to which daily consumption business methods
have expanded the consumption of Herbalife products among a broader segment of the U.S. population. We
have contracted with Lieberman to repeat this survey on a quarterly basis and look forward to having more
information to share with you in subsequent quarters.

B Riley Caris analyst Linda Bolton Weiser is also an active sell-side analyst AND Herbalife distributor. Seems a
flagrant violation of ethics to report (very bullishly) to her investors on HLF while being compensated and under
contract by HLF (regardless of how insignificant she considers it to be). She also stated that she joined as an HLF
distributor to get access to better information, which seems a flagrant violation of securities laws.

There seems to be two sides the stock play. If HL is looking for an LBO why wouldn't they want their stocks to go
down in price? Even if it hit close to zero the advantage would go to HL on buy-back price. The only downside is if
Johnson makes illegal actions. He should slow down, not panic, buy-back at lowest point, go private and not become
encumbered by any SEC rules.


26 Dec 2012, 04:52 AM


DoghouseReilly
Sorry bud, you can't do an LBO without the L, and to get the L you need bonds, and bonds are covered by
SEC rules.

@Doghouse


No. Not bonds. Bank Debt and Sub Debt combination.


26 Dec 2012, 08:01 AM

No. It is a combination of bank debt and subordinated debt.


26 Dec 2012, 08:01 AM


mjvcaj
No you don't. Your first post was spot on. This one leaves much to be desired.


The L doesn't come in the form of bonds really. It comes via bank debt and subordinated (including
mezzanine) debt.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1081822-did-the-ceo-of-herbalife-violate-the-fair-disclosure-rule 7/15


Mjvcaj - I beg to differ. By subordinated debt you mean subordinated bonds, which are "securities" under the
SEC regs. As is mezzanine debt (bonds / preferred stock). As are syndicated bank loans sold in the
secondary market (which most of any size are, especially LBO bank debt). The definition of security under the
regs is extremely far-reaching. The only type of debt that might be excluded are private bank loans which
aren't resold.


The comment was "go private and not become encumbered by any SEC rules". Perhaps you mean that the
company could go private and not be required to make regular SEC filings. Even without filings, they are still
subject to SEC rules.


Regardless of the financing, you aren't going to get a lender that won't demand audited financial statements.
And any bank loan document gives them the ability to accelerate payment if the company is found to be
operating illegally. So even without SEC involvement, Johnson can't take this thing private and "hide".


26 Dec 2012, 06:12 PM


6437031
Okay, aside from determining how the LBO is regulated, doesn't the main premise hold: letting the stock price
go down and then buy back at the lowest price.


27 Dec 2012, 05:00 AM


DoghouseReilly
6437031 - I think your premise is that as a stockholder you can win two ways, and both assume that HLF is a
legit company. Johnson can convince the market that the short-sellers are wrong (in which case the stock
goes up) or he can let the stock price fall and convince a private equity firm to engineer an LBO (in which
case the stock may well go up from here).


I don't think going for the LBO route is a good move from Johnson's standpoint because 1) it requires him to
tell different stories to the public shareholders and the PE firm, which is illegal and opens him up to lawsuits,
2) the first thing the PE firm would do is replace him as CEO (since he's the face of failure), and 3) the PE firm
needs to get debt funding from the same market that hates the stock (if shareholders think it is worthless
because of the risk of litigation or the pyramid scheme collapsing so will future debtholders).


The classic LBO opportunity is when a company has a cheap valuation, strong cash flow, securable assets
(which HLF doesn't have), and little risk that it all blows up in an instant (which HFL also doesn't have).


A good LBO-able example would be WDC or STX - cheap valuation, strong cash flow, securable assets, and
a business model that may last for 5 years or 10 years or 20 years, not one that could be extinguished in
lititagion in 1 year.


And of course there's the risk that HLF isn't a legit company (which I think is the case here). In which case
Johnson's only choice is to fight hard to convince the market otherwise.

I have followed the discussion with great interest, knowing a lot of local souls who market (part time incomes
for full time jobs often) all kinds of products through MLM's. My daughter just asked my opinion on joining an
'Arbonne', which has several locals running around in rewarded Mercedes,which it turns out are on one
month leases. Truly Egyptian.  
Those who dramatically publicise that they are binary shorts (target zero) often are not, and late pilers -on
may suddenly be left as bag holders. 
HLF is decidely not a binary short because the business model really works, and yes the regulators might
force minor adjustments to the model or the accounting. In the past four days I have read about 40 different
interpretations of MLM rules on these sites. Somewhat remarkably, almost every one of them has missed a
very key point that does not require a legal opinion:

MLM vs Pyramid is not exactly a point of time calculation. If it were, many unintended consequences would
result . The proponents appear to me to have pointedly dramatised a cliff mentality. The regulator would act ,
if at all, not only in law, but in the public interest. That would ironically result in a wholesale roundup of many
companies and business models that may not even think of themselves as MLM's. Good luck with getting out
profitably if you are short, but do not get conned into what can end up looking like a p and d in reverse for
latecomers.

All the info you need to make informed investment decision is on the HLF ir website.

The do talk to fund managers, but certainly not during the "quiet period" before earnings. And even if not
during the "quiet period" they aren't permitted to discuss or disclose material non-public information. After the
Ackman presentation (and during the quiet period) one could well argue that the threshold of materiality was
substantially lowered. Then again, perhaps he just repeated the same nonsense he did on TV.

Time will tell whether HLF is an illegal ponzi scheme or not. One thing for sure is that Ackman did a hatchet job with

I have more concerns about whether hedge funds and large market investors can manipulate markets in sessions like
the HLF presentation.


What if I had invested in Herbalife only to find such a session interrupts their entire business model and puts them out
of business?


What if short sellers continue to use such a strategy against companies? Is that a good thing?

Its fine. Shorting keeps the market healthy; otherwise the yield search would push the market up endlessly,
and make crashes even more dramatic.


We have just been in a 3 month (more like 3 year) period of only positive movement. If you extend this out to
10 years, the SP hits 3000 then crashes even harder.


26 Dec 2012, 10:43 AM


McGonicle
The problem with all the comments of the last four days is that they attempt to analyse the question of "is hlf a
pyramid scheme" without considering that that is a legal question in the US, and outside a court ruling or a FTC
investigation, the fact of whether it is or is not an illegal company will never be conclusively determined.


That said, the courts but especially not the SEC or FTC enjoys doing the bidding of a hedgefund short. They may
investigate, but the talk surrounding HLF makes it sound as if the FTC was going to come out with a complete
investigation by 12/26, announce its findings, and put 1.5BN into ackmans pocket.


That's not how it works. Now, having announced that he is the whale, the battle begins. Do you think MS, who just lost
291MM$ on ackman's play, is going to just laugh off a loss like that?


One question i have surrounding these big money plays--its been explaimined to me that instituional holders can
choose to allow their shares to be shorted and borrowed or not...can they now designate those 17MM shares as
unshortable and thus diminish the number available? The number of non-naked shares short cannot now
increase...because there is no 'find' left, so that cannot continue to diminish the price.


Of course, a battle now forms--some of the big boys and analysts will feel called upon to smash ackman, and there
are so many easy mechanisms they can use.


Based on my stock market theory, there is no linkature between the price of a stock and the performance of a
company. A stock can seek any value...it does not obey fundamental analysis.


Bascially, why not increase the buyback, threaten to take the company private, and entertain a buyout all at the same
time. Why not push the share price to 200$ to see him sweat? I dont think this is going to happen, but there is no
reason why it could not...like many hedgie stocks this one is so closely held the supply of long can be monopolized as
easily as the short can be...


Doing what ackman did is painting a target on yourself... it is very easy to know whether he covers or not (heard this
information should be available this week).

26 Dec 2012, 06:28 PM


McGonicle
the whatever the price perception of the stock at hand is. P/e is an after-derived measure. Companies that
lose money don't have a p/e.


if you like some examples i can give, but the market exhibits highly irrational valuations across many sectors
and stocks.


I would offer that the overall economy was not performing much net differently in 2007 than now in terms of
real incomes and inputs. Yet the stock market has valued the total enterprise of all publically traded assets at
1440, 660 and now again 1440.


This has nothing to do with the fundamental performance of companies, at all, but rather the ebb and flow of
capital. Now, money seeks the market because there is no yield anywhere else, and asset prices are
abnormally inflated. Price targets rise not because of a stronger business environment, but because the
juicing and morale effect of QE has money seeking everything, growers, stagnators, and junk.


I am a long time student of fundamental analysis and i assure you it is not a big factor in how stock prices
move. It does separate some stocks from others, but they all perform badly when fear reigns...and if a stock is
relatively well or poorly thought of the price already reflects that....you have to buy into mis-perceptions of
value to get ahead of any stock move.


The market variously values HLF @ 55 and 0, so 28.5 reflects roughly a 50-50 survival scenario.


During the crash, it was 7.25, heavily shorted (no doubt) but there were no allegations of any kind of
misgiving...

Herbalife is much too small to do what he has done. This is one of the most facinating trading situation since
Porsche attempted to corner the market on Volkswagen shares in 2008. It will be another great learning
experience watching it play out. I am long HLF.

Just pure speculation on my part but I think Ackman has more damning information which he has chosen to reveal at
a later day. We shall see.

I agree that he likely knows more than he put in the presentation, knowing full well every word in there would
go through the courts. I'm certain he got several expert opinions on the "pyramid scheme" FTC definition, in
fact I'd be shocked if he didn't get the opinion of former staff members of the FTC and SEC.

There's a lot on the factsaboutherbalife.com website. It's impossible not to be convinced after you see the
amount of dirt dug up by Ackman by just doing Google searches and reading what people write about
Herbalife.

It is not really possible to say anything more damning than a company is illegal and it should be delisted by the
regulator.

Ackman and his billions in research miss some fundamental truths about the distinction of a pyramid scheme....these
are distinctions any 30 day old HLF rep would know. 
Namely that the total commissions paid out in royalties are paid on product sales not on recruiting. No legitimate MLM
company pays for recruiting....it is blatantly illegal. No MLM lawyers would represent them and the Direct Selling
Association would not accept them for membership. 
The MLM model is based on " a lot of people selling a little bit each" The way you get a lot of people selling for you is
by recruiting but commissions are only paid when product is sold by HLF either to customers or to distributors. Many
of any MLM companies customers are distributors who gave up on the income opportunity but learned to appreciate
the value of the products. 
Ackman will no doubt successfully manipulate the stock again. The stock market has its own dark side doesnt it?

But here is what won't happen. HLF sales and profits will not quit growing. This is a company that has grown for over
30 years through FDA indictments, horrible press, the death of the iconic founder, fights over control, going public,
going private, going public again. The sales force of HFL is mostly international. They don't know Ackman, they don't
follow any of this and they dont care. They love their company and its products and will continue to pursue their own
success. 
How do I know this? I am a competitor....thankfully private.


The play is to short the stock short term and go long , long term. The stock will rebound to follow the continued
growth.

Rebounds happen way faster than that. 4 days of fall under these conditions are almost unheard of....as i've said
elsewhere, only MCP and RIMM acted like this and they were 2 baggers off the bounce.


Also, i would repeat that no retail person (read the SA crowd) gets to short a heavily shorted name. its called HTB and
it means that selling calls or buying puts are your only 'short' plays.


You can go long any name you want, thus NFLX.


But to short a stock that has fallen from 70 to 25 (recently) and then expect more immediate falls? Even a BK works
through the markets more tortuously than that.


But you are not always allowed to short. There is a very amusing SA article on the HLF put buildup..its very
interesting to see how people observed the rise but did not know what the catalyst was or was going to be...and what
they thought/said.

Fascinated by the whole HLF mess. First, my only connection to HLF is that I bought their weight loss shake product
20 years ago and it worked for me and my wife. We both lost 30-40 pounds. I kept mine off, sadly she did not.


I also have no affiliation with Ackman, and am shocked at his behavior. Imagine shorting 20 million shares of a 110
million +/- share company at $35-$60 a share and then going on TV and seeing they are a pyramid scheme and
saying you have bought no puts, while within the past 2-3 week there was massive short Put buying (just days before
his presentation), and you had a large group of people putting that 300+ slide presentation together. Finally, doing a
dog and pony show for a group of hundreds of investment types, and getting the equivalent of a million dollars of
coverage by CNBC trying to destroy that company, while saying it will go to $0. But the topper for me is his 3 page
disclaimer, which allows him to do anything he wishes with the shorted shares at any time with no repercussions. He
can (may have already) buy them back at any time while publicly saying he'll hold them to the price of $0.00 - but his
disclaimer says otherwise. What a slimeball he is.


Now I'm not defending HLF, as I have no facts on their behavior, just a lot of innuendo's out there. Question for
Ackman - is that all his money or investors money? And is this action to give all the money to charity a grandstand
play or what. My final thought is that if HLF did something wrong that Ackman knew, he should have given his

information to the regulators, shorted the stock and kept quiet. He had done his duty - now he comes across as dirty
as many say Johnson is. May they all get what they deserve, whatever that is.

Fair disclosure rules would only have been violated if Johnson revealed information to Fidelity (and others) that he
has not revealed to the public. This is most unlikely since he has defended the short allegation numerous times
before.


In all likelihood he told Fidelity that HLF is not a pyramid scheme. This would not be a violation.

I agree. 
Also, Ackman doesn't follow "fair disclosure." 
He builds up his short position, then discloses his short one day before a major conference presentation, then
presents at Ira Sohn, then releases his presentation to the public a couple of days later. 
The suckers who followed Ackman's short advice after he disclosed his short will be burnt. Wouldn't be
surprised if Ackman has started covering his short!

HLF has so far recovered 70% of its price since the attack. But seems hesitant to advance further,


Stocks will always have volatility for some reason or the other (in this case it is Ackman.) And fools will sell in a panic
because they haven't bought right (i.e. with enough conviction and understanding of what they are buying and what its
worth.)

This was a raid, adam. People sell because the purpose was to spread fear.


Whether it is founded or not, i bought the dip. The QE market makes buying battlegrounds the most sure proposition,
because money is seeking garbage, any opportunity to make quick money. Do you think that people are buying CRM
@ 170 to get to 200? Or to buy EBAY @ $53 to get to $56??


This is a dangerous time of market, to be short, to be long, either way.


MCP RIMM HLF and EDU all dipped to absurd levels, prices that represented imminent death for all four companies,
and the rebound is usually an extremely fast 100% gain.

In a different market tempo, they may have fallen and stayed down, but the QE market forces everyone to search for
yield among the garbage...
