NOBLE GROUP IS SINKING. THIS SAGA
REVEALS THE COMPLETE FAILURE OF
THE REGULATORS IN SINGAPORE.


August 3, 2017  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 9 Comments  


“I just want to let you know that Noble has not changed; the character,


the high degree of morality, the respect, the honesty and all the


positive things that built Noble are still in place and are being


reinforced on a daily basis.”


Richard Elman, Founder and former Chairman of Noble Group – 11


June 2015


 


Noble is sinking


Noble expects a massive loss of US$1.8b in its second quarter. The loss is


mostly due to the impairment of the commodity contracts (around $1.2b).


Our main argument against Noble was that this company fabricated profit


by inflating the value of these contracts by billions. Noble had already


impaired these contracts by $1.1b in its 2015 results. So the total is now


$2.3b, and it’s not over. Noble will also record a $500m operating loss due to


wrong speculative positions. In the past, Noble would have fabricated


contracts fair values to hide these losses, and nobody would have known.


This option is not available to Noble anymore.


When the new Chairman of Noble, Paul Brough, was an “independent


director” of this company back in August 2015, he declared: “The (PWC)


reports demonstrate clearly that the accusations of bad faith on Noble’s part


in the preparation of its mark-to-market valuations have no basis”. So our


“accusations” had “no basis” at that time. Mr Brough has apparently

7/8/2019 Noble Group is Sinking. This Saga reveals the Complete Failure of the Regulators in Singapore. | Iceberg Research

changed his mind. Last week, Noble said that “the Board has concluded, as


part of the strategic review, that a more conservative balance sheet


valuation should be implemented”.


Noble is sinking in a perfect storm. The company is walking toward


bankruptcy and liquidation. Its cost of fund is prohibitive. Noble is losing


the confidence of its counterparties and of its banks. Key traders are


leaving. The stock price is now down 96% since our first report. The sale of


the US energy business won’t solve the crisis. The previous sale of Agri,


Energy Solutions only borrowed time.


Noble needs billions from a new investor to repair its balance sheet and


reverse its huge operating cash outflow. This potential investor has to be


rich enough to inject this amount of money, and dumb enough to do it


without proper due diligence. Noble has been trying to find this miraculous


investor for more than two years. Every candidate who had access to the


books walked away. The true accounting situation is probably worse than


what we estimated in our reports. Noble may have hidden more losses than


we thought.


The lawsuit initiated by Noble against us is ongoing, although progressing


at an extremely slow pace. Noble does not have money to pay the coupon of


its perpetual bonds but apparently still has money and energy for this


lawsuit. Noble’s lawyers should ask for a retainer at this stage. One of the


objectives of this lawsuit was to silence us. We don’t write less when we are


sued. We write more. We will write more for anybody who wants to sue us.


The plaintiff is now dying.


If you lost your retirement money in this fiasco, you probably want to know


who is responsible for this debacle and where your money is. Please don’t


blame Noble’s management for this situation. It’s not their fault. It has


never been their fault. No, it’s the “commodity environment”, which is very,


very challenging. Unfortunately, many journalists will give credit to these


justifications. Of course, if the environment is so tough for commodity


traders, the question is why do Noble’s peers (e.g. Trafigura, Vitol, Mercuria,


Gunvor…) record hundreds of millions of profit year after year? Nobody in


the commodity industry thinks that Noble is affected by the “environment”,


the “downturn in commodity markets” or “downturn in commodity


trading”, whatever that means.


 


The Noble saga reveals the failure of the regulators in Singapore


Thousands of investors bought Noble’s securities because of the confidence


they placed in the public information provided by its managers, its auditor,

and in the regulatory framework of the Singapore stock exchange. They


were the lamb to the slaughter. E&Y has helped Noble deceive investors. The


numbers provided by the auditor were meaningless. They are still


meaningless. Exactly like Enron, Noble is stuck with its contracts fair


values. The company was not able not realise or sell them because many


were worth nothing.


These investors won’t get their money back. Even if a last minute white


knight puts billions on the table, they will be diluted to irrelevance. Noble’s


market cap is still US$385m. This is surprising because in any scenario


(liquidation, restructuring, massive investment), shareholders should


expect to be wiped out.


The most common question we heard when we talk to hedge funds about the


Noble saga is “What the hell does the regulator?”. In any decently regulated


stock exchange, what Noble’s managers and E&Y did would be considered a


major scandal. The accounting techniques used by Noble were similar to


those used by Enron. In particular, both companies recorded fictitious


future income that was being counted as profit. In the case of Enron, the


SEC launched a formal investigation, filed civil fraud complaints against


the auditor (Andersen), and charged Enron’s CEO with fraud. The CEO of


Enron is still in prison. Importantly, the SEC prevented Enron from raising


more funds and deceiving even more investors.


The response to the Noble accounting scandal, a repeat of Enron in Asia,


could not be more different.


There are officially two regulators in Singapore. The first one, called the


“front line” regulator is the SGX, which is the stock exchange operator. The


second one is the Monetary authority of Singapore (“MAS”) which regulates


the SGX.


What did the SGX do? The SGX issued a “trade with caution” notice. It also


made a very weird comment on the PwC review of Noble’s fair values. The


SGX “welcomes Noble Group’s initiative to increase transparency… This will


address and help bring closure to questions raised by the market on this


issue.” That was probably the most awkward comment that a regulator


could have made, and it showed how much it wanted to sweep the Noble


controversy under the carpet. The PwC review brought closure to nothing. It


was a complete joke in fact. PwC never valued these contracts. Noble is


impairing the very same contracts that had been “reviewed” by PwC.


Finally, the SGX regularly mentions it is closely monitoring the situation.


The passengers of this Titanic will be relieved that the coast guards are


closely monitoring the situation while they are swimming in freezing


water.

As for the MAS, two days after we published our first report, it announced it


would review “the statements in the Iceberg Research report” and will “take


appropriate action” if there have been any breaches. Then , the market


never heard of the MAS again. So we can assume the MAS found nothing


wrong in our reports and found nothing wrong in Noble’s financial


statements. Well… there was something a bit wrong with Noble’s financial


statements, a few billions wrong. The MAS remained silent.


Of course, before we published our reports, the SGX and the MAS ignored


that Noble, a then constituent of the Singapore index, was a major financial


deception. But after we published, it was clear that this company had


fabricated its financials. All our arguments have been confirmed one by


one: Yancoal, Agri, the fair values, etc. The stock price kept plunging and the


market lost confidence in Noble’s management.


What is particularly shocking is that the SGX and the MAS have allowed


Noble to raise more money based on its fictitious balance sheet, and dupe


even more investors. Noble raised $500m from equity holders in June 2016,


and a $750m bond in March 2017. This company raised billions from banks.


These investors will lose everything or almost everything. Every time, they


funded what was clearly an accounting illusion. Every time, part of this


money was used to pay the astronomic salaries of Noble’s senior managers.


The former CEO, Yusuf Alireza, is suing the former Chairman, Richard


Elman for $58m he claims he is owed, so that gives us an idea of how much


these people were getting paid. Noble has seen a huge transfer of wealth


from the shareholders who were deceived to the people who organised this


deception. The SGX and the MAS did nothing to stop this scandal.


In the statement of claim of the lawsuit between Mr Alireza and Mr Elman,


there is a very interesting sentence. Mr Alireza claims he approached Mr


Elman in May 2016, and “raised his concerns over the future viability of the


Noble Group”. This is the same man who explained to the public, his hand


on his heart, that everything was fine with Noble’s balance sheet. This


sentence is the admission that the former CEO failed to disclose material


information about Noble to his stakeholders. The viability of a company is


definitely material information. Indeed, Noble was sitting on fake assets


that would never be realised, and it is now almost bankrupt. Noble knew it


but the company raised $500m one month later.


This lawsuit was reported in the press and we know this sentence was


brought to the attention of the SGX and of the MAS. Again, the regulators


have not made any public comment.


It is well known that the SGX, a small stock exchange, struggles to attract


IPOs in Asia. The Noble saga, that received a lot of attention, is not helping.


Why would a foreign investor put money on the Singapore stock exchange

Waiting for MAS is like waiting for LTA to fix SMRT….

You are spot on about SGX’s incapability, there are just too many


dead wood in there drawing high salaries. Something got to


change to restore investor’s confidence otherwise the only way


for SG is downhill. I hope MAS will step in to clean up this mess.

when a company like Noble can misrepresent its financial condition for


more than two years with impunity? Hedge funds to do not understand how


the Noble debacle can last so long without regulatory reaction.


To be fair, the SGX can only fail because its functions are fundamentally


contradictory. Nobody would do a much better job. On one hand, the SGX is


a for profit company that runs the stock exchange and competes with other


stock exchanges. On the other hand, it is supposed to regulate the listed


companies whose trading contributes to its profit every day. It is a classic


conflict of interest. A for profit company defends its interests. A regulator


defends the interests of investors. Since the beginning of the saga, the SGX


has failed to put the interests of investors above its interests. The SGX’s


move to transfer its regulatory functions to a subsidiary company in 2016


has not changed anything as we can see with Noble.


There will be other Nobles in Singapore. It is simply too easy to raise money


there based on financial misrepresentations, and do it with impunity. This


fiasco reveals the spectacular failure of the regulatory environment of the


Singapore stock exchange.

So SGX is really a joke? Would it be fair to say to it is becoming a


third world exchange under the new leadership or what is


happening? The concerning fact is that they play the role of a


regulator leh.


Since when was the last good news about SGX out?So far IT issues,


leadership changes and childish behavior is all we Singaporeans


hear. Time for leadership shuffle?

have a Securities Commissioner.

Just before Swiber filed for bankruptcy a year ago, I informed


SGX and ACRA of possible overstatement in the balance sheets in


one of the offshore marine company. Never heard back from SGX


other than an acknowledgement. ACRA told me to file a police


report with CAD. Seriously? Regulators in Singapore need to do


what they are paid to do instead of passing the buck around. If


nothing changes, I can assure everyone that in 10 years time KL,


Jakarta, and Bangkok bourses will each have a larger market cap


than SGX. SGX will cease to be the leading bourse even in the


ASEAN region. Companies and investors have already voted with


their feet. Just ask Ron Sim.

What happened with noble is also seen in the almost complete


devastation of the oil and gas sector where the regulators were


asleep at the wheel when thesr companies went on a debt binge


issuing bonds and other debt instruments. Had they acted sooner


to rein in their borrowings a lot of equity investors may not have


seen their hard earned saving wiped out. Our regulators should


all be fired.
