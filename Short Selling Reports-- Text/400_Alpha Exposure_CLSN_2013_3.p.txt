Celsion's Coming Dilution: 600% Dilution In Past 5 Years Is Not
Enough
Aug. 5, 2013 1:52 PM ET71 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Since we began publishing on Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLSN), we have highlighted
the difference between the hype Celsion has been selling investors and the stark reality of
their failed business. Even at $1.36/share (approximately 19% below the stock's price at
the time of our first report), we continue to believe Celsion is a compelling short with
nearly 50% downside from current levels to our unchanged target price of $0.73 per
share. In fact, Celsion's recent actions make us even more confident, and we wanted to
highlight them to investors.


Failing Celsion Continues to Mislead Investors


No one can deny that Celsion is in dire straits. Its share price languishes near 5-year lows.
Its main drug, ThermoDox, failed its pivotal phase 3 trial (here) and has no hope of near-
term regulatory approval. Celsion has no other late-stage products in the pipeline. Celsion
is also losing about $4 million to $5 million in operating income per quarter, which closely
approximates cash spend, as can be seen here in their first quarter results. The Company
is likely to burn through its $45 million of net cash rather quickly. On a per share basis,
Celsion is burning $0.07 to $0.08 of cash per quarter against a starting balance of only
$0.73 per share of cash net of debt.


As a result, Celsion has relied on heavily dilutive stock issuances to keep it afloat. Dilution
seems to be part of the Company's DNA as the share count has increased by 600% over
the past five year. Indeed, just this year since ThermoDox failed, Celsion has more than
doubled its share count, and it still needs to raise additional funds. The best way to
continue to do that is to sell hype, and we believe disparity between Celsion's latest filings
and press releases underscore just how desperate the Company is.


Faking The Good News


Celsion wants investors to believe that the prospects for ThermoDox are exciting,
particularly in China. On July 19th, Celsion touted in a press release that the Company
had signed a memorandum of understanding for future development of ThermoDox with
Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, found here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1604662-celsions-coming-dilution-600-percent-dilution-in-past-5-years-is-not-enough 2/16


We read the press release multiple times and think it's just recycled news. While it is clear
that Celsion wants investors to believe this is a material positive development for the
Company, the truth is that significant portions of the press release were copied verbatim
from an old press release more than a year before on May 7, 2012, as seen here.


Whether or not the press release contained any substance or was even new, it did the
trick and Celsion's shares jumped from $1.22 to $1.42.


We think the PR is basically just meaningless hype. We know this because Celsion never
filed an 8-K for the press release or included a copy of the memorandum as an exhibit.
The SEC mandates that an 8-K be filed for "material definitive agreements entered into by
a company that are not made in the ordinary course of business," as per this SEC
document description found here.


CLSN has filed 8-Ks for every other transaction that was material. The fact that Celsion
did not file an 8-K proves this memorandum of understanding does not cross the threshold
for materiality. Why not? Because Celsion already filed an 8-K with the original press
release here more than a year ago.


We've seen these shenanigans before and it is never positive for shareholders. We
reported a similar situation by a speculative, hype-filled company called Uni-Pixel
(NASDAQ:UNXL) with regard to its manufacturing and supply agreement with Eastman
Kodak, as seen here. Since we reported on this, the shares of Uni-Pixel are down about
45%. We expect a similar result with Celsion.


Hiding The Bad News

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1604662-celsions-coming-dilution-600-percent-dilution-in-past-5-years-is-not-enough 3/16


While Celsion is touting irrelevant old news as being positive, the Company is hiding the
bad news from investors by filing 8-Ks without putting out corresponding press releases!
On July 22, Celsion quietly released an 8-K announcing approval for a reverse stock split,
found here. The reverse split could be anywhere from 2-for-1 or 9-for-2, as seen here. Any
investor should know that reverse stock splits are typically only done by desperate
companies under significant duress.


More importantly, as part of the reverse stock split, Celsion will increase the number of
shares the Company is authorized to sell from just 240k shares to anywhere from 34
million to 57 million more shares of stock!


The reverse split will allow Celsion to double or even quadruple the share count through
additional share issuances! As if 600% dilution over the past five years wasn't enough, the
Company's preparing to dilute shareholders by up to 4x all over again. Put another way, a
shareholder from five years ago might have as little as 4% of his original ownership stake
in the Company once it's done with this next round of dilution.


Now we know why Celsion issued the press release from July 19th: to pump up the stock
price and excite investors with breathlessly positive press releases that have no
substance behind them so Celsion can distract them from the real news - its intention to
sell shares in the future and further dilute shareholders.


Clear Bad Intentions


Celsion's intentions are crystal clear. Celsion is doing the reverse split solely to enable it to
raise more money.


Don't trust a company like Celsion. Its main drug does not work and has no near-term
hope. The management team is trying to raise money to keep their jobs at the expense of
shareholders. We repeat our $0.73 per share price target.

imagine if this new delivery system helps to limit side effects and damage to the rest of the body?


This delivery system is critically important to the future of cancer research in my opinion.

The reverse split might / might not happen at any time prior to the next shareholder meeting. The great majority of
companies effecting a reverse split adjust the number of authorized shares to have more room, nothing new here nor
anything hidden, at least no more than any other co.


Obviously you are exaggerating to feed your short position.


Sorry but this reading material is definitely not worth my time

Correct...nothing wrong with reverse splits. SR reversed and look at that no good for nothing stock. Well,
that's what everyone though but I hung in there and I'm glad I did. The same for C. Reverse splits are
sometimes done to avoid delisting when under $1.00 for too long. Announce a conventional 2/1 split and
everyone goes crazy thinking it's the best thing that ever happened. A pound of feathers is not lighter than a
pound of lead.


BTW...anyones got change for a dollar?

well, especially because the reverse split would be for the purpose of issuing more shares.

Author: What is factually not correct?


You made a direct assertion that Celsion WILL do a reverse stock split. An assertion made under the premise of
conjecture is pure falsehood. Nice try, though.


You also used the word "desperate" several times in your article. To me, this reflects the tone of desperation of the
author, a feeling that one elucidates before something negative happens (to them). We're glad that you're apparently
privy to what will be discussed on Thursday.


In this case, your negative is a positive for Celsion shareholders.


Thank you, Mr. Alpha Exposure.

AE, I certainly did notice. Did you notice that on 05/22, an ascent commenced and even through the toughest
market conditions, CLSN has not revisited the $1 price tag? As a matter of fact, it resisted at $1.02 on 06/28
where I added to my position another 25%. I am averaged out at $1.16 and would love to add more but I have
a cardinal rule of not buying for more than I'm in. While hard to believe, I would welcome your target price as I
have with many others and made $$$. I have already set aside to add 10K shares. That would drop my
average to .80 cents. I am certain it would head north again but I just don't see .78 cents or even under a
buck. The company has huge support from one of the largest in China which is not a third world country.


Hisun apparently sees what our FDA doesn't want to see. China and it's companies have come a long way.
They go after corrupt companies as well if you haven't noticed. If CLSN is a charlatan of a company, Hisun
wouldn't be betting on them.


Hisun' mission statement says it all; 
Mission StatementWe are committed to improving human life, while encouraging and promoting innovative
thinking.


 
AE, bottom line; they will do whatever is necessary to get this done.

<<< Disclosure: I am short CLSN>>>


Anyone shorting a biotech co that already fell from 8 to less than 1 and still trades in the mere 1.30's is a little late to
the party. Propensity is now UP not down, IMO. Been around for decades and one thing is for sure: Stocks go up,
then they go down, and then they go back up again at some point. It's a simple concept, but yet a dynamic cycle --
period.


All told, not only is the article a self-fulfilling mechanism, but people are now also supposed to feel sorry for this guy
and bail him out of an absolutely stupid trade. LOL


Good luck with that, especially when management comes out with additional good news.

Sort of saw a lame short thesis article coming after QTR published his article last week. I'm sure the shorts (those
crazy enough to see value in shorting a company down this much) are concerned about a major pop in the coming
months so hold your shares folks.

Post-hoc analysis is garbage to the FDA. They will never approve based on this. If the company wants to get

A recycled press release offered no assurance that CLSN would rally. What if it didn't jump? Are you aware of
their next contingency should it have sat stagnant? Your motive here is crystal clear and you don't have many
takers. To move the needle in the direction you are hoping for, you really need to convince the top holders to
unload; good luck.

The FDA will soon become a non-sequiter and a non-starter in these discussions. And I believe we'll see that
start to happen on Thursday.


HCC is far more prevalent in Asia. That is probably one of the reasons only 15 Americans were in the P3 trial
and a majority were from Asia. This is also why Celsion has been granted patents for the TDox delivery
system in all of the major Asian markets: China, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, et al.


Instead of the FDA, the CFDA will become a much more salient point of discussion. Do you realize how
aggressive the Chinese government is with regard to healthcare? It will be a trillion dollar industry by 2020,
and having a SOC for HCC will be there for the taking. By Hisun and Celsion.


What say ye in response to this?

When post-hoc reveals that 42% of the total trial pop. showed improvement in PFS & OS that cannot be
construed as "garbage". The trial failed because the trial design submitted by CLSN & accepted by the FDA
was flawed. Heat duration was not built into the p3 protocol and there lies the flaw and the underlines the
mistake of bypassing a p2 trial. However, CLSN was granted SPA & ODS and those designations may very
well be meaningful in the near term. The FDA's approval regulations for incurable, extremely painful diseases
has changed considerably. In reality though, China is the 800lb'er with 50%+ global occurrence of HCC.
Hisun is back on board and is providing non-dilutve financing. Hisun is providing guidance thru the regulatory
protocol of the CFDA. I'm long, your short and opinions are like rear ends..Everybody has one. The difference
here is you still diatribe old news and maliciously assail the steady positives forthcoming from a flawed trial.

<<< Any investor should know that reverse stock splits are typically only done by desperate companies under
significant duress.>>>


Oh, you mean like $CYTK, $SRPT, and the like? Desperate cases? OK. Reverse splits have become a non-issue as
of late. As a matter of fact, in certain cases stocks rally hard following reverse splits, when the float is dramatically
shrunk and renewed buying interest comes to fruition. Remember this? http://bit.ly/1c4MAve


It is my opinion that you are trying to instill fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the minds of $CLSN investors. That, IMO, is
the sole purpose of your self-fulfilling, negative article, which was coincidentally released on a day where the
company's shares were beginning to gain some momentum.


Let's not forget that you are SHORT shares of $CLSN and that you directly benefit from any negative reaction in the
stock price.

no need for FDA approval since China has reiterated their "all in" position. Once China has proven the effectiveness,
then the sheep will follow.

Hey alpha exposure,


Why did you use term "near-term" when describing celsion's chance for approval?


Why didn't you just say they have no chance for approval?


05 Aug 2013, 09:41 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  They have no chance for approval without running a new phase 3. I would expect a new
phase 3 trial to take a minimum of 4-7 years. At that point, they can hope the trial succeeds. Personally, I
think a new trial will also fail.

Author - you're not factual with any of this. The company has plenty of money to operate and to run another trial. They
are cash rich with a low burn rate, having laid off most staff. It seems that you publish a negative piece each time this
stock goes on a run. What you're doing is dishonest.

One thing that you overlook (and it's huge) is that many big pharma companies have drugs going off-patent. I
see Celsion potentially partnering with a big U.S. pharma (in addition to Hisun) to bring this technology to
fruition. Big pharma needs R&D companies like Celsion to bring new innovative products to market.


06 Aug 2013, 10:43 AM


Komodo Dragon (speculative)
No chance of affording. Hisun is providing $$$ based on the provisions below and accelerated SFDA
approval, not to take forever as you suggest. This is covered in an article on Yahoo Finance; link below just in
case you missed it.


http://yhoo.it/14gGv92


As stated...


Among the key provisions of the Celsion-Hisun collaboration are: 
•Hisun will provide Celsion with non-dilutive financing and the investment necessary to complete the
technology transfer of its proprietary manufacturing process and the production of registration batches for
China;


•Hisun will collaborate with Celsion around the clinical and regulatory approval activities for ThermoDox® as
well as other liposomal formations with the China state Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). A local China
partner affords Celsion access to accelerated SFDA review and potential regulatory exclusivity for the
approved indication; and


•Hisun will be granted a right of first offer for a commercial license to ThermoDox® for the sale and
distribution of ThermoDox® in the greater China territory.


06 Aug 2013, 12:08 PM


Komodo Dragon (speculative)
They don't need to raise money, Hisun is providing...read on by clicking on the link below in case you missed
it. Furthermore, the SFDA approval process will be accelerated. China is only the worlds largest market and
Hisun is a leading Chinese pharmaceutical and the largest manufacturers of chemotherapy agents globally,
not some whole in the wall backyard operation.

Author’s reply »  Hisun is providing money for the technology transfer. There will be no approval filing for
thermodox because there was no successful trial


06 Aug 2013, 03:57 PM


Komodo Dragon (speculative)
Yes, that's the "and" part of the statement. It clearly states below that Hisun will provide CLSN with non-
dilutive financing AND the investment necessary to complete the technology transfer...

Well , You guys are really tearing it up now . I follow A.E.on his reviews of Celsion and I find him to be once again
"SPOT ON" . I bought CLSN and sold it at a small profit on A.E. recommendation . I am sitting on the sidelines now
watching , but I still believe in the company and it just may have something going that we don't know about . In closing
,I will have my cabbage out and be a ready buyer at $.73 a share . It will be the bargain of the century!!!!!!! Rockyron

Question to the author:


(Let's see if he can answer it.)


You've been stating for many months that you have a "target price" of 0.73 for the stock.


Q: What is your time horizon for this price level?


Today? One week? One month? One year? 5 years?


Unless you provide us with some context around the time horizon for your projected valuation, it's a useless and
arbitrary number. Please elucidate and educate us.


06 Aug 2013, 10:27 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  This is my target price (i.e. fair value) for today. Since the company burns 7-8 cents per
quarter, my target price will decline to 0.66 in a quarter. When does the stock trade at fair value? I don't know.

Did you know that nearly all biotechs NEVER trade at fair (book, cash) value this early in the product
development cycle?


You're an experienced biotech analyst, yet you conveniently overlook this. Forward guidance from the
company is what drives the stock price (either up or down) for a biotech at this stage. Not "book" or "cash"
valuation.


You need to acknowledge this. That is why your 0.73/0.66 price targets are toothless and without merit.


06 Aug 2013, 11:11 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Biotechs routinely trade below cash following failed trials. See NABI and ANIP following their
drug failures


06 Aug 2013, 11:32 AM


cameron12x
I'm looking forward to the CC on Thursday and any tangible forward-looking guidance (good or bad) that
comes from it.


That will drive the company valuation and stock price.

If you trust in CLSN management, you must be really gullible. This team knows how to look out for number one....and
it is not the shareholders.


I dont short and especially at current levels but if you are holding out for big gains or trying to recoup losses I am
sorry. If you trade this stock....good luck.

we are going to find out many answers to our questions as soon as tomorrow and I believe that shorts will not be
happy about that , good luck to all longs

It should be noted that the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) is far more important to Celsion than the
FDA.


That is why Celsion holds patents in all of the major Asian markets for its delivery mechanism. The Far East and
Pacific Rim is where the "new money" is flowing.


Celsion can become a multi-billion-dollar market cap company with, or without the FDA. Period. Getting approval for
the U.S. market is nice, but of secondary importance in this case.


This is just the beginning of a long ride upwards, folks.


07 Aug 2013, 09:41 AM


alfedo
I agree, we are not even talking about FDA with their bureaucracy anymore, China's CFDA has a different approach
to health issues and that is why CLSN is a Strong Buy now...


07 Aug 2013, 10:37 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  So you think that China is going to approve a product that failed its Phase 3 trial? Even the
data mining couldn't find a subgroup that was statistically significant.


07 Aug 2013, 11:10 AM


cameron12x
"Statistically significant" is both relative and contextual. Don't paint it with a broad brush.


Again, if things were "so bad" why would Hisun even be interested?


You fail to mention the importance of Hisun in any of your propositions. Taking the "glass half empty
approach" will ultimately lead to missed opportunities.


07 Aug 2013, 07:25 PM


alfedo
We are not even talking about FDA with their bureaucracy at this point, CFDA is going to lead Celsion to a great
success very soon.
