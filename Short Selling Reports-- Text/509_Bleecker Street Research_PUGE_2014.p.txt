Puget Technologies: It's Not A 3D Printing Stock
Jan. 16, 2014 9:24 AM ET31 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Editors' Note: This article covers a stock trading at less than $1 per share and/or with less
than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.


Puget Technologies (PUGE). I first heard of Puget Technologies when I clicked on a link
to a Forbes article and saw this ad. I have seen the ad several more times on sites like
Bloomberg and MarketWatch.


Given that the ad says it's a 3-D printing concern I was surprised to see this in the most
recent 10-Q.


PUGET TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ("the Company") was incorporated under the laws
of the State of Nevada, U.S. on March 17, 2010. Our business is the distribution
of Luxury wool bedding sets produced in Germany.


Those are two very different businesses and investors are currently much more attracted
to the 3-D printing space than a company that distributes luxury wool bedding sets that are
produced in Germany. That 10-Q was filed on September 12th so it's possible that the
business underwent a drastic change over that time period. It's possible, but it would have
also required some sort of SEC filing. No 8-K or amended 10-Q has been filed since
September 4th, which was before the 10-Q that said it was a luxury wool distributor. In that
8-K Puget Technologies announced the acquisition of all B-29 Energy Inc. stock.

5/18/2018 Puget Technologies: It's Not A 3D Printing Stock - Puget Technologies Inc (OTCMKTS:PUGE) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1949161-puget-technologies-its-not-a-3d-printing-stock 2/11


On September 2, 2013, PUGET TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a Nevada corporation ("
PUGE " or the " Company "), B-29 ENERGY INC., a Colorado corporation (" B-29 "),
and Ronald Leyland, sole director, president, and registered holder of 100% of the
shares of B-29 (the " Shareholder ") and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
PUGE, entered into share exchange agreement whereby PUGE acquired all of the
issued and outstanding common stock of B-29 held by the Shareholder (100 shares)
and, in exchange, issued 15,000,000 shares of PUGE to the Shareholder
(Shareholder now holds 35.2% of the capital stock of PUGE).


So what does B-29 Energy do? Well its business is the development of effective and tasty
energy drinks.


B-29 Energy, Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Colorado, U.S. on May 24, 2013. Our business is the development and distribution
of effective and tasty energy products.


B-29 Energy doesn't appear to have any relationship to 3-D printing either.


The next logical question could be that perhaps the ad was a mistake, or that it was put
out by some very unethical shareholders. A quick look at the company's website will put
that out of the questioning, however.


Puget claims that it has "the most advanced personal 3D printing solution." I find this
almost impossible to believe. Just two months ago it issued this press release:


Puget Technologies' subsidiary, Cannabis Biotech, is investigating smoke-free
delivery systems offering several benefits, including ease of use, portability, dosing
accuracy and a wider variety of natural cannabis compounds.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1949161-puget-technologies-its-not-a-3d-printing-stock 3/11


So two months ago it was presenting itself as a pot stock, but has since dropped all signs
of that from its website and is now just a 3D printing concern. This is somewhat ironic
because when marijuana was legalized in Colorado recently many stocks that had even a
passing connection to marijuana skyrocketed.


What's Up With This?


This is hands down the strangest thing I've ever seen in a 10-Q.


If revenue supports the expense we intend to spend $12,000 to hire one
salesperson to introduce our products. The salesperson's job would be to find new
potential purchasers, and to set up agreements with wholesale customers to buy our
luxury wool products.


I don't think that a company that can't pay a part-time salesman $12,000 should be
publicly traded at all, much less awarded a $40,000 million market cap, no matter what
industry it is in. This also makes me question this statement from the homepage of Puget's
website.


At Puget, we seek the opportunities to make a difference every day as a leading
developer of advanced personal electronic 3D cutting machines that makes it easy
to create stunning DIY projects-with or without a computer. Our team of
researchers and specialists understand the positive impact we can make in the
lives of our customers and partners. Puget Technologies is growing fast and working
hard to ensure maximum returns for each of its shareholders.


While it sounds great to say you have a team of researchers in what is arguably the
hottest sector right now, I don't believe it in this case. The 3D printing industry attracts top
talent, and they are paid pretty well. When just six months ago your company couldn't pay
someone $12,000 to sell German wool products there is simply no way you have a top
team of researchers and specialists.


Can It Be Making The Best 3D Printers?


Puget Technologies claims that it has the "most advanced 3D printing solution." I don't
think this is possible. (For another reason besides being a pot stock two months ago.)
There is literally no R&D. To be competitive in the 3D printing industry you have to at
some point spend money on R&D and Puget simply hasn't done that. Like at all.

SSYS Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YCharts


Even if you look really close it's not there.


Financials


Like many companies that feel the need to promote themselves via ads on popular
financial websites, the financial situation at Puget Technologies isn't great, to say the least.
As of July 31st they had just $8,800 in cash and hand only $11,000 in total assets.
Compare that to a market cap of around $40 million and total liabilities of around $56,000.
Does $8,000 in cash seem like enough to properly launch the best 3D printing solution? I
don't think so.


Conclusion


If you are looking for a 3D printing stock then this is not it. If you are looking for a pot stock
then this is not it. If you are looking for a beverage play then this is not it. And if for some
reason you are looking for a German bedding set distributor, even then you are out of
luck. If you are so inclined and have a broker that allows it then a short may be in order. If
you don't, then you can sit back and watch the slow fall of the share price to where it
belongs.


Note: I have contacted the company about my concerns. I have not heard back. I will
provide an update if and/or when I hear back.

I do not know. While you may have contacted them and it does seem shady did you see the Wall Street Journal
article?? I am attaching the link to this post. I am a bit scared but if WSJ allowed the press release it brings it all into
question. Do I agree with your findings currently "HELL YES" those are scary but was not ONVO a first a Real estate

Like I said I am scared I dropped a test in to see I took my 10% swing and am happy. But here's more info.
Let me know if this helps. Since I didn't see this Avenue attempt in the article.

A Chinese Company, Shenzhen Weistek, actually won that award. Supposedly, PUGE is going to be visiting
that company and trying to sign an agreement to distribute their products. Seems a bit ambitious for a
company with only 9K in cash, though, so are they going to be selling them on consignment or something?


However, you have a typo when you say they have a "$40,000 million market cap", I'm assuming you meant
$40M like you say later in the article. Now down to $33M and even that seems absurdly high. Good catch,
wish I could short it.


21 Jan 2014, 06:19 PM


Bleecker Street Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for catching that typo Illuminati, I doubt they are going to be able to sign any deal
with that company, also doesn't change the fact that they lied about winning the award.


21 Jan 2014, 06:48 PM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Didn't really lie since they credited Weistek with the award, but clearly oversold their involvement since who
knows how serious an audience Puget will really get with them, although Weistek does say they're looking for
distributors on their website:

I bought 1,000 at 1.40 when Colorado legalized pot, PUGE presented well on-line, seemed logical to go from a drink
to under-the-tongue administration of THC, they did not do anything but talk for the 9 mos. I owned the stock. When
the press release for 3-D printing came along I began to smell something, the stock was around $1, I hoped the 3-D
b.s. would drive the stock up and I'd get my money back. Your article today was the nail - I sold immediately at .78
and am glad to be out. Lost $700 but feel very good about it - learned a great deal about my motives and also what to
look for in a company - after this, they must be doing something tangible to interest me. I think this kind of thing
happens all the time - just not so blatant - these people did nothing but write things that would create attn. Thx, in a
few days I will forget them.  
Still looking for a real THC delivery company to invest in.

Illuminati Investments, Contributor
Yup, you scared them into doing the only thing they actually do, which is press releases:


http://yhoo.it/1eSIG5y


A MOU is not a legal contract, so why they heck do you need to sign two of them? Also, the CEO says "our
engineering team" when that clearly doesn't exist either since they've only paid salaries of $10,000 TOTAL over their
entire history as a company.


This is obviously a scam, the only way I can see anyone getting burned by shorting this is if the Chinese company
they're meeting with ends up doing a reverse merger with them. Not sure how this works and if current shareholders
would get anything in the process, since there's not much demand for reverse mergers these days what with all the
ones that were frauds.

Seeing some ads for PUGE right here on SA. I am always surprised at the actions of these promoters. One would
think every OTC stock marketer would avoid placing ads on SA.

Author’s reply »  I haven't seen any ads here yet but I've seen ads for similar stocks on SA. That's basically

12-month plan of operation or to fund our ongoing operational expenses beyond 12 months. We will need to raise
funds to commence our development program and fund our ongoing operational expenses. Additional funding will
likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock, if at all. If we are successful in completing an
equity financing, existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not have any
financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding
from the sale of our common stock to fund our development activities and ongoing operational expenses. In the
absence of such financing, our business will likely fail. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further
sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing
necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our development of our minerals

claims and our business will fail." 
I am not a lawyer and I don't read company prospectus' nearly as much as I should, but it sure sounds like they are
saying they will pump and dump this stock and are trying to make it all sound legal. This statement contradicts their
press releases that state or certainly lead one to believe they are a growing business and not a business that is on the
verge of bankruptcy and the only resort they have left to them is to cash out their common stock shares.


25 Apr 2014, 04:09 PM


Illuminati Investments, Contributor
That sounds like typical legal boilerplate that most companies include in the risks section of their annual
report, but in this case I think it could actually be directly applicable. Only thing this company seems to be
printing is press releases and perhaps more stock certificates if they can find enough suckers to buy them.

Their quarterly report form 10-Q/A also states, "To date our principal business activities related to our entry into the
additive manufacturing industry consist of creating a business plan, entering into a Memorandum of Understanding
with Shenzhen Weistek Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese company, which is an established manufacturer of leading
edge additive manufacturing equipment and supplies. We are in the process of negotiating our definitive agreements
with Shenzhen Weistek related to the formation and operation of Weistek USA, a newly formed venture intended to
be the distributor and manufactures representative for Weistek products in the United States."


So it clearly states they are MANUFACTURERS REPRESENTATIVES but their press releases say they develop the
printers and software. Big difference!


I never bought shares in the company because of the above information and it has no income, $14,000 in cash, and
$183,000 in debt. But obviously a lot of other people got suckered into this. It currently has 42 million shares and had
a market cap as high as $70 million but now its market cap is $15 million. I think people are having a very hard time
selling their shares.

There's obviously a lot of questioning going on here. I find it sad that most everyone has lined up onto either the yes
or no group. There is an in-between place but you won't see it if you're driven by fear.


This past week I opened a small position of 4,000 shares @ 0.385 and 2,000 more @ 0.30. I've now got a 19% gain.
Depending upon the degree of sustainable momentum I see developing, I hope to double-to-triple my position in the
next few days.


The company is up to date on SEC filings, hardly as deserving of suspicions as might be warranted by a non-
compliant pink. The amount of cash on hand is meaningless so long as business can be conducted steadily. Dilution
of late has been terrible but how else will sustainability be assured---at least until cash flow becomes a reality?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1949161-puget-technologies-its-not-a-3d-printing-stock 11/11


Pointing to various elements explaining the company's past activities merits nothing in my opinion. I look for
"buildable" opportunities.....ideas and/or ventures showing enough prospectivity to justify continued explorational &
expenditure-related activity. Sometimes we get so tied up in studying company's history that we lose sight of an
incredibly important yet glaringly meaningful bit of reality: There is no future in history!


This company, as I see it, has been struggling for the perfect opportunity to market something nobody else has been
able to accomplish. So what if it's not blankets or soda or anything else, for that matter? I want to know what they are
doing right now! And if they are the sole marketer of 3-D printers costing a mere $999, then I'm all over it. And if I see
paperwork showing upwards sales momentum, then I'll become more of a believer and add to my investment.


For now, I've got a couple of grand in something that's handed me a 19% gain in a week. If this is how scams work,
show me some more so I can continue increasing wealth! All I care about is achieving success as an investor and
trader. I'm not concerned that others get stuck in their provincial viruses because they are afraid to think out of the
box. I see it as sick and sad for there's opportunity out there---but only when we are prepared to humbly accept that
we are afraid of doing poorly. And only then are we likely to perform strikingly well.


Three times life has struck me down devastatingly. Three times I've had to face my reluctance to look fear in the eye.
My fear took on a likeness, that of a huge tiger. Today I'm constantly reminded of the importance of looking my tiger in
the eye and accepting zero tolerance for flinching. The more committed I become to embracing my fears, the more
successful I am.


So please don't hide behind history or warnings or opinions of others. Instead, isolate your own ideas and
uncertainties and try to requalify everything so that you can get out of boxes belonging to others. It's probably the only
way to find and secure your own box. Think of it as bowing to another's shrine. It is incumbent upon each of us to find
that personal corner of his/her universe where life assumes the most meaningful shape worthy of our committed
respect. it's like captaining your own ship and owning the rights to that personal satisfaction.


May it enrich you as it does me!
