Summary


Veeva's long-term growth prospects continue to appear drastically smaller than what
the market believes.


The Salesforce.com contract renewal raises more questions about the company
than it answers.


Veeva remains grossly overvalued compared to peers, with 50%+ downside
imminent.


"Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici"


Veeva: Irrefutable Proof of TAM Overstatements, Pharma Rep Seat Saturation,
Drastic Growth Deceleration, Opaque Disclosures, Nose Bleed Relative Valuation,
and Highly Dubious Sell-Side Coverage


Veeva reported its fiscal Q4 2013 on March 4th after the close and despite the fanfare
from some of its analysts we view, the results and guidance the company provided as the
proverbial 'nail in the coffin' for any investor holding this stock. A significant tailwind to
Veeva's IPO story was the strong Q-O-Q and Y-O-Y growth the company has
demonstrated as a SAAS/cloud player. When combined with the premium assigned to it
being in both life science and cloud (both sectors currently demanding a premium in the
markets), it has helped prevent the share price from correcting to IPO levels or lower.
However, the reality of Veeva's market potential and lack of addressable opportunities to
justify the growth assumptions and current valuation premium have come to the surface.
Needless to say, anyone invested in the SAAS/Cloud space will have picked up on
the huge relative underperformance of Veeva the past 3 months. While our initial 40+
page piece on Veeva addressed the basic points of our thesis, the past 3 months have
allowed us to drill-down significantly and definitively address the notable industry,
demographic, valuation, TAM, legal and disclosure issues, which we believe are
tantamount for any investor in this company to better understand.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


1. Industry, Market and Pharma Rep Demographics- We go in deep detail with seat
mapping, competition and data points on the pharma top 50. Our conclusion is that the
competitive landscape has stabilized, and that organic seat growth will be extremely
difficult from here on out.


2. CRM LS TAM -We go through the numbers, even given the most generous
assumptions they just don't add up.


3. SalesForce.com (NYSE:CRM) Contract Renewal- What this renewal really means,
and the fine print you must read. The timing/terms of such a contract raise serious
questions as to management's "strategic thinking" at this point in time.


4. Veeva Guidance, Vault, and the ASP Elephant in the room - We take a look at
guidance, the Vault TAM, and why both management and the sell-side continue to
avoid discussing ASPs. Guidance implies under 20% revenue growth by Q4 2014.


5. Relative Valuation - A wake up call, we put Veeva up against its peers and show you
just how ugly the picture looks. Our analysis generously implies 50% immediate
downside from here.


6. Our friends the Sell-side - Despite their claims to the contrary, all the key information
to properly research Veeva is publicly available. We show you how to find it all, and
leave you to draw your own conclusions as to why SIX different IB Sell-Side teams
didn't perform this rather basic, yet highly critical, research.


Industry Headwinds


Consolidation - In pharma 1 + 1 does not equal 2!


M&A Deals since Veeva's Q3 close:


1) Cubist (CBST) acquired Optimer (NASDAQ:OPTR) - Both Veeva CRM customers.
Optimer sales force pretty much entirely eliminated.


2) Actavis (NASDAQ:ACT) acquires Warner Chilcott (NASDAQ:WCRX) - This deal was
announced early last year and closed Oct 1 '13. Both companies are Veeva CRM
customers. Salesforce realignment was however announced on Nov 22. Basically, the
entire Warner Chilcott field force was let go.


3) Actavis acquires Forest Labs (NYSE:FRX) - Deal announced Feb 18th, 2014. Again,
both Veeva CRM customers. Forest has 3,000+ reps and is widely considered to have the
most overstaffed PC team around. We believe there will be significant layoffs here.


4) Salix (NASDAQ:SLXP) acquires Santarus (NASDAQ:SNTS) - Announced November
2013, both Veeva CRM customers. At present no expected layoffs.

5) Shire (NASDAQ:SHPG) acquires ViroPharma (VPHM) - Announced November 2013.
Both Veeva CRM customers, and both have overlapping highly specialized HAE sales
forces. Viro team is small, but some realignment is likely.


Developed Market Layoffs Are Still the New Normal in Pharma


Novartis (NYSE:NVS) - One of Veeva's largest customers by revenue and reps
announced a major round of North America layoffs in February. The cuts are in the PC
(nearly half the team based on information we gathered) and Neuroscience Teams. They
are effective as of April 14, 2014.


Merck North America (NYSE:MRK) - a Veeva CRM customer, announced in December
they will be laying off 150 people in their Saphris team. This is consistent with their
October announcement that they globally will be laying-off 8,500 employees on top of an
already planned 7,500 over the coming two years.


AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) - Also a Veeva customer announced 550 additional planned job
cuts in February '14, which brings the planned total current restructuring to 5,600.


Pharma CRM Mapping- Effective Penetration is a lot Higher Than We Initially
Thought (we are happy to privately share all our top 50 pharma seat/CRM
system/geography data upon request)


Our initial thesis basically focused on the drastic overstatement of the LS CRM Market
TAM, and also on Veeva's significant penetration of that TAM. While our views on the
former remain the same, we are revising our views on the latter.


Over the past several months we have mapped out the entire top 50 pharma
companies by rep count, CRM deployment, and when possible geographical split.
We have also pulled every press release on any Veeva ex-top 50 customer as well as all
the listed customers on their website, and mapped those out where possible. In doing this
we learned a lot about the current landscape. The most notable takeaway is that the top
ten companies are where the seats are at (roughly 55-60% by our math). This is important
because if you can't sell into one of these customers your effective market opportunity
quickly starts to shrink. They could have built their own custom solution on your Platform
as a Service (PAAS) provider, just recently renewed with a competitor in a specific
geography and are off the table for the next three years, or have a unique global
relationship with a competitor and have passed on you throughout the land grab phase. To
put this in perspective, consider that if you add up all the seats at a sample of 50 Veeva
ex-top 50 customers we mapped, they equal roughly half the seats Veeva has at Eli Lilly

(NYSE:LLY) (goes to show how bad that Wells Fargo 'bottom-up' analysis actually was).
Now consider that our recent research indicates #4, #5, and #6 of the top 50 are
effectively unavailable to Veeva, and that several other top 50 names also fall into this
category.


Below is a summary of how we see it, and the effective market opportunity Veeva has in
the Top 50:


Here is how we are thinking about it:


1) The Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)/Siebel trade is over - Veeva has done an exceptional job
displacing Siebel, and are now clearly a victim of its own success. With AstraZeneca
abandoning its Harmony project and re-platforming on Veeva (this is an interesting
situation we will get into later), the only big fish remaining in the top 50 that still largely
"Oracle Shops" are GSK (NYSE:GSK) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). In 2012, Novo
had Antenna Software build them a custom app on top of Siebel, and thus is an unlikely
candidate to switch CRM systems right now. We wouldn't rule them out completely, but
having passed on the Veeva switch opportunity already; we feel comfortable putting them
aside for now. GSK, however, is the big fish we learned a lot about in this process. The
consensus view of the industry experts we spoke with on GSK is that it is for the most part
a highly customized Oracle shop, and with the treatment it gets will 'never be switching to
Veeva as a Global standard'. Furthermore, one quite knowledgeable LS consultant we
spoke to stated that if GSK ever got to the point of contemplating such a switch; it would

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


without a doubt seek to build its own custom solution on SFDC as it has done for its
consumer health division. These two companies employ about 40,000 pharma reps, or
roughly 10% of the total global seat count. Thus, Veeva's days of raping and pillaging the
Oracle Siebel customer base are pretty much over.


To illustrate this point, we highlight the case of Merck International (MSD). In 2012, Veeva
did a POC with Merck's UK 100+ person Immunology team. Veeva has published a White
Paper on this POC that paints a rather rosy picture, and based on that we assumed that
MSD Europe was already exclusively on Veeva or in the process of completing such a
transition. This was a reasonable assumption when you consider that Merck USA was
already standardized on Veeva's Irep. However, as we were working through our mapping
process, we started to come across information that indicated MSD Human Health was
deploying Oracle CRM On Demand w/iSales across the EUCAN (EU and Andean
Countries) region. What we found is that the Irep POC ended in early Summer of 2012,
and subsequently a custom Oracle CRM On Demand ("MSD Connect") roll-out started.
We have confirmed this through field research, but with some basic digging you can easily
find the evidence on LinkedIn. (There are about half a dozen public profiles that allow you
to clearly confirm MSD has chosen to split up the geographies versus standardizing only
on Veeva.)


Isn't Oracle supposed to be dead in LS CRM? If that is the case, how did they manage to
win this 40+ country deployment after Merck USA, MSD Animal Health, and some major
European countries had deployed or were/are in the process of deploying Veeva?


Is it a product issue….


According to a post-implementation enterprise system deployment Master's Thesis, which
was published in November of 2013, engagement is a problem. One of the case studies in
this thesis was the MSD Animal Health Veeva CRM implementation.


We recommend reading the full thesis if you have the time, but for our purposes the
following paragraph is the most relevant.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


"At the moment, the system is live in 20 countries with 1,800 users, representing
80% of the total amount of users. However, at the moment MSD Animal Health has
taken 'a marking time', and temporarily stopped the deployment of the system in the
other 30 countries. The reason is that the user adoption stagnates (or even
decreases) in the 20 countries that are currently using the system. The objective is
to secure the acceptation and usage of the system before the global system
deployment will be continued."


So, user adoption stagnates or declines. You think that had anything to do with the fact
that MSD Human Health was willing to deploy Oracle CRM On Demand despite MSD
Animal Health and Merck USA being on Veeva? Who knows, and to be fair engagement
issues are not something we really think are a cause for concern. We can't say the same
thing with respect to the fact of the supposedly 'dead and buried' Oracle managing to win
some geographies at a top 5 pharma and existing Veeva customer. We say this because
of what it implies for ASPs in the space more than anything else. Everyone might now be
familiar with the fact that Veeva is a thin layer on top of SFDC, but some people might
have forgotten that SFDC's platform infrastructure is Oracle. Basically, if Oracle wants to
pull the price lever on Isales there is not much anyone can do to stop them. (this is
even more concerning news when placed within the context of Veeva's SFDC contract
renewal… more on that later) To be clear our initial analysis assumed Veeva would
swallow every single Oracle Siebel LS customer. To see Oracle coming back in and
splitting some geographies with Veeva at a global top 5 name is a datapoint that is
impossible to ignore.


2) Cegedim's (OTC:CGMJF) CRM business, contrary to what Veeva's underwriters are
saying, is not collapsing. Despite industry headwinds and Veeva's best efforts, Cegedim is
still holding its own. One of the reasons for this is that it has an anchor client in Sanofi
(NYSE:SNY) (we estimate Sanofi accounts for 25%-30% of Cegedim's total CRM users)
and it is going nowhere anytime soon. We dug around on this despite the fact that it would
have been easy to simply assume the whole French/French element vs. French/American
as the entire reason. What we found was that Sanofi, much like GSK with Oracle, is
getting unbelievable custom service/treatment from Cegedim. There is literally a team of
50-60 engineers at its beck and call if the company ever need anything. Not surprising
considering how important this customer is to them, and to be clear this was a general
point we made in our initial thesis even if we didn't fully grasp the specific details at the
time. To be clear, Cegedim's resilience is not just about Sanofi. We have come across

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


several customers throughout Asia (including several Veeva USA customers) and Europe
that have upgraded or renewed with them. Add these seats to Sanofi and you are talking
another 10%-15% of the global seat count, which is clearly unavailable to Veeva.


The Canaccord Genuity Analyst with the highest price target on the street recently
admitted this healthy competition in its Q4 review on March 5th:


" We recently met with Cegedim to learn more about that firm's ambitions, outlook
and prospects. With the caveat that this was our first meeting, the company seems
to run a credible, competitive business. The French firm has a broader product
offering, which in the future, probably 2-4 years, could prove to be a selling
advantage."


Seems like great due diligence on Canaccord's part to not have done any prior
background work on Cegedim when it is Veeva's strongest and main competitor.


3) Salesforce.com customers are all unavailable to Veeva. We are now very familiar with
the fact that roughly 20,000 seats at Roche/Genentech (OTCQX:RHHBY) will never be
available for Veeva to sell into, but the SFDC problem in the top 50 doesn't end there. We
identified other SFDC ex-Veeva customers in the top 50 that we initially had not thought of
factoring into a downsized TAM. The bottom line is that these seats might as well not exist
as far as Veeva is concerned. Outside of these, we even came across some SFDC related
threats in the Consumer Healthcare side of CRM in the top 50. Notably, GSK CH, and
their iKoach custom built on SFDC. If you have not seen this application, we recommend
watching this video. (start at 38:45 and listen to the questions …note it took Bluewolf 12
weeks to build this) Suffice to say, the Salesforce 'custom CRM cloud' over Veeva won't be
going away, and is likely to get worse. We say this despite the fact that Veeva and SFDC
extended their contract (we have a whole section on that later). This move, which in our
view looks like sheer panic for positive press on Veeva's part ahead of its lockup expiry,
costs SFDC nothing. The threat it poses comes in the form of a PAAS, and more
specifically, customers choosing to use that PAAS like ROCHE to build their own vertical.
If you ask us, Veeva's claim that Vertical is the New Horizontal is going to be quickly
replaced by PAAS Killed the Traditional Vertical.


As you can see, once you start mapping things out, Veeva's effective addressable CRM
market quickly starts to shrink. This is why in retrospect the AstraZeneca win was huge.
Three months ago we wouldn't have given much thought to a customer win because
frankly our thesis allowed us to give them all to Veeva, but now looking back they needed
this one badly. If AstraZeneca had stuck with its Oracle Harmony super project, 25% of the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


seats of the top 50, spread out across just 4 pharma companies, would effectively be
unavailable for the foreseeable future. What this implies with respect to TAM analysis, and
Veeva's revenue guidance sensitivity to increasingly limited LS CRM customer win
opportunities is staggering.


Some Thoughts on AZ


Veeva, which is not media shy and usually quite PR happy (this proved to be invaluable in
our mapping exercise), has not put out a press release declaring this a global customer
win (though it mentioned the size of the win and the point that this customer had one small
existing Veeva deployment on the Q3 call). Now, we know the customer is AZ because
frankly it can't be anyone else, once you've mapped out the entire top 50 by number of
pharma reps (let alone CRM deployment) this is rather straight-forward. But even if that
was not enough, the necessary information regarding the implementation can also be
found on LinkedIn. Also, AZ is the only Veeva customer with one tiny deployment (Medical
Affairs POC team 3 years ago, and a 100 user sales team deployment in Germany) that
has that many total reps, but there's something else. AstraZeneca has a rather notable
new CIO. If you follow SAAS stocks, he should be familiar as he used to be CIO at
Flextronics (NASDAQ:FLEX). It's at Flextronics where he made a name for himself being
an early cloud adopter by deploying the likes of Workday (NYSE:WDAY), SFDC, and
ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) across the entire enterprise. Thus, seeing him move AZ
towards SFDC/VEEV is not a shocker. However, we were a bit surprised that he would not
choose to leverage the current developer ecosystem to build a custom CRM on SFDC; is
there a dual roadmap here? Did Veeva fight really hard for this with respect to price? Is
this a SFDC customer using Veeva technology? One would think based on the CIO's pre-
existing extensive SFDC relationship that he would seek to deal directly with the
mothership here. The absence of a press release on this deal for a company that readily
puts out press releases for even 10 seat wins has left us scratching our heads.


TAM: Simple CRM Math


Anyone who has ever shorted a TAM penetration problem story knows just how badly
things can go wrong if you miss something or run into a management team that is
exceptional at spinning. ServiceNow has been a perfect example of that and so have
some of the HRMS-related SAAS names. The beauty of Veeva is that it's the antithesis of
these stocks when it comes to that issue. In fact, we'd argue Veeva is where it is today
because of all the short-sellers who got burned on the likes of WDAY and NOW. Without
them it cannot exist at these levels because seasoned short-sellers would have spotted
this mess a mile away. Like a dubious new property launch, Veeva got the type of hype

premium that leaves the person in the luxury apartment across the street wondering what
the hell is going on. But a Workday, Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), or ServiceNow this is not.
Furthermore, anyone comparing it to SFDC literally has no understanding of enterprise
software or SAAS for that matter. We even squirm when it is compared to very expensive,
but much more fundamentally appealing models of healthcare/life sciences SAAS pure
plays like athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) and Medidata (NASDAQ:MDSO).


Here is why…


1. This is not a penetration story. 
Pharma reps are not running around with Filofaxes. They have been using clunky
PDAs and custom built CRM software since the late 90s. So, you don't need to worry
about a 'we are replacing paper argument' i.e. Textura (NYSE:TXTR).


2. This is not an organic growth story. 
Patent expirations, the rise of generics, Obamacare, and private exchanges have
permanently changed the landscape in pharma. Share/Voice in the developed world is
going the way of the dinosaur. Organically the space has been shrinking and will
continue to shrink.


3. Inorganic forces are a net negative. 
Because of the organic growth problems consolidation has accelerated, and this is
leading to a further reduction in reps.


4. Technology commoditization is also a major headwind. 
So not only is the pie shrinking, but it is also thinning out. What was once a lucrative
market for selling specialty hardware and software to life sciences companies is now a
commoditized space. A rep's main technological utility device is now just as likely to be
found in the hands of a five year old. Thanks to platform providers, there is no
shortage of trained developers and system integrators that can build a CRM with a
snazzy UX and the requisite functionality. Integration and added functionality is not a
premium proposition, but instead is universally expected. Combine this with points 1-3
above, and ASPs will be going down, not up. Coincidentally this brings the ceiling on
LS CRM from our initial report down. Initially, we wouldn't have ruled out the possibility
of the LS CRM space being as big as $800 million. Now we think using $600 million
(400k seats X $1,500 as a max ASP) is being extremely generous.


5. This is not an opaque market. 
Almost all the relevant customers/competitors are public, and the necessary
information on them is readily available if you put in the time and effort. Thanks to
Google and LinkedIn you can get as granular as you'd like looking at a space. If you

are an experienced short-seller with a fair share of battle scars, you couldn't ask for a
better situation.


Now, with this in mind, let's do some simple math.


We had Veeva at about 145k-150k reps exiting Q3. We are putting them at 165k exiting
Q4. Our very thorough research indicates the global top 50 rep count is about 385-390k,
but we will use 400k for now. That would be 41% seat penetration going into 2014. Now
let's subtract the three unavailable top ten pharmas, the ex-Roche top 50 SFDC
customers, and Novo Nordisk. This all adds up to about 115k reps; so available seat count
is now down to 285k, Which is then approximately 57% penetrated. Where are those 120k
seats Veeva will be going after? Well, Cegedim ex Sanofi is about 100k, and AZ is about
20k seats (though based on Q4 disclosures and a screenshot of the LinkedIn data we
found:


they implemented appx 6k of those already in China). It doesn't get much clearer than
that. This goes to show that anyone modeling Veeva is better off spending their time
figuring out what is the status of Cegedim's non-Sanofi deployments, and paying very
close attention to its guidance. Basically, to further penetrate the market and grow
organically Veeva needs a mass exodus of existing Cegedim customers. All our research
indicates that this is not happening (in fact the opposite may be true), but let's assume that
was not the case.


The recent upgrades, wins, and renewals we came across at Cegedim would take roughly
half of the remaining 100k seats off the table until 2016. That would bring you down to
235k seats effectively available to Veeva. Now add the AstraZeneca seats that Veeva will
eventually have deployed (14k non China seats out of roughly 20k total), and you are at
179k out of the 235k. That's 76% penetrated, and the remaining seats are largely spread
out in emerging markets (Asia, Latam, Eastern Europe) and Japan where Cegedim is
solid. Knowing all of this, you can now start modeling out Veeva's growth to see what
CRM penetration will look like by the end of the year.


Veeva Guidance: the 2014 Seat Add Picture

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


Veeva has guided to a mid point of 29.7% revenue growth in 2014. This implies flat to
slightly down professional services revenue and roughly $62 million in incremental
subscription services revenue. Doing the math on that you are looking at roughly $52
million in incremental CRM revenue if you give them a generous $10 million in incremental
Vault/Network revenue. Based on last year's math that works out to about 60k seat adds.
Note we chose not to adjust for secular/geographic mix ASP headwinds as we have
generously assumed Approved Email would help offset that a bit. So, 60k CRM seat adds
in 2014 would equate to a 225k exit count going into 2015. That's 80% penetration of the
rock solid effective 285k seats, and 96% on our adjusted ex-50k Cegedim number. (By the
way when we adjust for let's say roughly 15-20k non top 50 seats you are looking at 72%
and 87% penetration)


Suffice to say these numbers don't paint a pretty picture, and do nothing but bolster our
CRM TAM argument. Basically, sizing this market does not require a PhD in mathematics.


Also, you think it's a coincidence that Veeva chose to not disclose the top 50 CRM
customer count this quarter? We don't! It's because it has not budged, and we know that
for certain because when pressed on this number at a conference the next day they
disclosed it. (Refer to the recordings of the Morgan Stanley Investor Conference March
5th 2014) The bottom line is that the road ahead in CRM is not a growth story at all
let alone one commensurate with the multiple Veeva is trading at now. This is before
you get into the risk of Veeva losing customers it won a few years ago to one of its
competitors (non-SFDC PAAS custom); nobody is even considering that very real
possibility at this juncture. Yet, in Veeva's case all it takes is one unhappy top 50 customer
to make such a move to create the perception of disaster in the market place. That's the
kind of 'zero margin for error' operating environment you want to steer clear from as an
investor.


Vault TAM Overstatement Exposed


Veeva management is on record saying that Vault is "at least as big as CRM." That's an
interesting statement. See, in our initial report we took quite a conservative approach with
respect to the LS ECM market sizing, because we didn't want to make the mistake of
jumping to any conclusions. We knew based on extensive research that it was at least half
the size of what several of the launch reports were putting it at. Well since then we have
learned a lot more about the LS Reg Doc space that Vault is going after, and now can
reliably put this market at no more than $500 million. This sizing is something we are now
confident in, and are really questioning how much smaller than that it actually is; but that's
not what makes this interesting. In the past few months, we have discovered that Veeva

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


management at a private investor road show in April of 2013 sized the market opportunity
for Vault at $400-500 million. Is it a coincidence that Veeva's market sizing for their
road show is spot on with what we came up with after four months of research?
Either the market for LS ECM increased by more than 4x from April to August (August was
first draft of the S-1 to include a TAM of appx $2bln) or someone is not telling the truth
here. Call us crazy, but we are leaning towards the latter. At the MS Conference, Veeva's
CEO stated that Documentum's share in LS REG DOC is 90% while Vault's is less than
1%. We presume the purpose of this comment was to show how much growth head room
lies ahead for Vault to displace EMC (EMC). Sadly, it seems Veeva's CEO did not give
much thought to the fact that Documentum (IIG) is a part of a public company. If he had,
he'd have known the entire Documentum division did a total of $647 million in revenue in
2013. Let's be clear, IIG revenue does not equal LS revenue at Documentum, and
Documentum platform share doesn't necessarily equal LS Reg Doc revenue. That being
said this was the first time Veeva management publicly threw out some numbers that
would indicate they are quite aware of the actual size of Vault's TAM. Interestingly enough
immediately after making the comment on Documentum having 90% share, Veeva's CEO
joked to the audience 'no other hard questions come on'. Well, we have a hard question
for him.


How can any coherent person believe what Veeva has to say at this point about
TAMs in Life Sciences?


Suffice to say this TAM thing is turning into an epic disaster. It's hard not to sympathize
with them at this point because we are pretty sure this colossal screw up falls on the
shoulders of their underwriters. Veeva management probably made the mistake of
assuming that investment bank research analysts all do thorough research and are
knowledgeable about the businesses and industry they write about. Since their numbers
came in at what is now looking like 5x reality ($1.2 billion is looking more like the TAM for
all three products); they conveniently chose to believe in the unbelievable. Why else
would Peter Gassner still be saying Life Sciences is $1.6 trillion and growing at 6%,
when we have clearly shown that the Marketline source he is citing doesn't even
say that. And for good measure here is what Life Sciences data king IMS has to say
on the matter:

Hiding from the ASP Elephant in the room


Much like the Vault TAM and penetration problem, Veeva has said absolutely nothing
about ASPs in CRM. This is pretty amazing when you consider that over the past four
months it has had two quarterly conference calls and two investor presentations. We gave
the company an opportunity to address this when we published our pre-earnings
questions, but it continues to hide from that question, which is not surprising. As of today,
the CRM annual ASP is closer to $1,000 versus the supposed $5,000 implied by the TAM
math error, which by the way has quickly morphed into a future add-on pipe dream. It's
hard not to presume that this silence continues because management really has no
credible way of tackling this problem. There is no way they can acknowledge what
everyone already knows was clearly a combination of poor sizing analysis by their
bankers and their foolish belief that 'the IPO story' and usual highly subjective nature of
industry sizing would assure no scrutiny. So what to do? How do you explain that an easily
verifiable ASP, which is likely heading much lower, is in fact going to quintuple? Is Veeva
building an electric car? Are they about to enter the Tesla Model S leasing business?
Honestly, we'd love to hear any explanation (no matter how farfetched) at this point that
addresses this nonsense.


Is the Salesforce agreement renewal a positive?


While Veeva's CEO has publicly stated he is not preoccupied with short-term fluctuations
in the share price, everything around the SFDC agreement would seem to indicate that
the exact opposite is true. The decision to announce this renewal a full year and a half
before the contract was slated to expire and in conjunction with earnings is a clear sign of
a knee-jerk reaction to issues we raised around the Genentech/Roche custom build. We
presume the company thought such a move would help put a bid under the stock in the
weeks leading up to the lock-up expiration. All we can say is that whoever advised them
on this should have read the contract they signed. Rushed decisions are never good and
this is no exception.


To secure a renewal, Veeva has agreed to $500MM in minimum payment commitments to
SFDC over the term of the contract.


Minimum Payments:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


This commitment also comes with a "true-up" provision:


1.5.5 Years 5 and 10 Shortfall Payments. There will be two "true ups" during the Renewal Billing


Period - one within [*] following the end of Year 5 and another within [*] following the end of


Year 10.


(a) Year 5 True Up. If, by the end of Year 5 the cumulative Actual Billings attributed to
Years 1-5 in Chart 1 above ("Years 1-5 Actual Billings") do not equal or surpass Reseller's
cumulative Interim Billing Target attributed to those Years ("Years 1-5 Interim Billing
Target"), then within [*] of the end of Year 5, Reseller shall pay to SFDC a "true up"
amount equal to the difference between the Years 1-5 Interim Billing Target and the Years
1-5 Actual Billings (the "Year 5 Shortfall Payment").


(b) Year 10 True Up. If, by the end of Year 10 the cumulative Actual Billings attributed to
Years 1-10 in Chart 1 above ("Years 1-10 Actual Billings"), plus the Year 5 Shortfall
Payment (if any), do not equal or surpass the First Renewal Billing Commitment, then
within [*] of the end of Year 10, Reseller shall pay to SFDC a "true up" amount equal to the
difference between the First Renewal Billing Commitment and the sum of the Year 5
Shortfall Payment (if any), plus the Years 1-10 Actual Billings (the "Year 10 Shortfall
Payment"). The Year 10 Shortfall Payment will only come due if cumulative payments
during Years 1-10 (including any prior Year's coverage as well as any Year 5 Shortfall
Payment) add up to less than $500,000,000. With respect to any Shortfall Payment
payable by Reseller hereunder, if the Parties are in a dispute referred to in Section [*]

hereof that affects the amount of such Shortfall Payment, any portion of such Shortfall
Payment affected by such dispute (and only such affected portion) shall not be due until
such dispute is resolved, and then only as provided in the applicable Section.


Thus, no matter what happens, SFDC gets its $500 million. Make no mistake this is not a
clause you accept in a multi-year contract that supports your infrastructure if you are in a
position of bargaining power; or have the ability of simply walking away from the table.
While our legal minds were quick to pick up on this, there have been no shortage of
people who have chimed in with their opinions.


Here is how one tech industry veteran described the true-up:


"I've never in 20+ years been at the licensor or licensee end of such a contract or
even seen one."


See, the problem here is that in a technology based business prices tend to go DOWN.
For example, going back to our earlier point on Oracle, if Larry Ellison decides he wants to
go after this space he can drive the subscription price down all the way to the force.com
platform fee. While this is a worst-case scenario for Veeva (and also SFDC), if what we
have heard about Oracle pricing is accurate it's a scenario investors should be worried
about today, if only because of the leverage it provides pharma customers to negotiate on
price going forward. Thus, Veeva claiming the royalty rate has not changed is very
misleading. For example, if you were to model them out at about 200,000 seats and a
$1,000 ASP, the effective royalty rate is 25%. But what about if subscription ASP blend
heads towards $600 per user? Well, at that point you are paying SFDC 42% per annum!
So, to simply maintain the current margin profile on CRM/CLM core, they will need to
offset ASP mix pressure with further seat penetration. (By now you probably have a good
idea of how much more difficult that will be from here)


What does Veeva get from SFDC for all of this?


Absolutely nothing. The main competitive threat from the SFDC PAAS remains.
5/23/2018 Veeva: Irrefutable Proof Of TAM Overstatements, CRM Seat Saturation, Drastic Growth Deceleration, And Highly Dubious Sell-Side Cov…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


"Target Market Resellers" as used herein do not include SFDC's systems integrator
(SI) or other consulting business partners whose principal business is consulting and
professional services ("Consulting Partners"). SFDC's Consulting Partners are not in
any way constrained by this Section 6.2.3 from developing and making available
certain customer specific, non-generally available technology products built on
Force.com Platform Products and/or the SFDC Services that offer features and
functionality competitive with Veeva CRM and marketed to customers in the Target
Market."


This is the problem with Veeva's business model going forward. All SFDC cares about is
keeping the customer on the Force.com platform. If they get their fee through an ISV
charging 4x that amount or directly from a customer who has built his own front-end
solution, makes no difference to them. However, they obviously are aware of the fact that
a custom built solution is likely to assure customer stickiness especially if it comes with
significant cost savings. Thus, all things being equal they will remain quiet and let Veeva
go about their business. But if Oracle or another competitor launches a price driven attack
that Veeva cannot match or initially resists, they are not going to sit by and lose platform
customers. This concern explains the very explicit language with respect to system
integrators and consulting business partners.


In summation, this contract leaves Veeva in the same vulnerable position with respect to
custom SFDC builds, and at the same time adds further financial obligations, which will
only reduce their operating flexibility. All they received in exchange for this was a press
release they could use a few weeks before their lock-up expiration, which frankly is
probably all they really wanted in the first place. Nobody in their right mind would rush
to sign such a deal with 18 months to go on the existing agreement. The timing and
terms of this contract renewal should raise a huge red flag for any long investor in
Veeva shares.


Relatively Speaking It Doesn't Get Much Worse Than Veeva


(Valuation analysis based on March 10th closing prices)


At the current share price Veeva has a fully diluted EV of $4.6bln. That puts it at 22x
calendar 2013 revenue.


Salesforce.com is trading at 9x 2013 revenue, they grew at 33% last year. From this
revenue base of $4bln they are expected to grow 30% in 2014. That works out to a
forward multiple of 7.3x.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


Medidata after a recent 25% run up has an EV of about $3.05bln, and did $277 million in
Vertical SAAS LS revenue in 2013. That works out to an 11x trailing multiple. They grew at
27% in 2013. They are expected to grow at 25% in 2014, that is a forward multiple of 8.7x.


athenahealth, which has been on a tear for the past year, has an EV of $7bln, and
generated $595 million in healthcare vertically focused SAAS revenue in 2013. That works
out to a 11x trailing multiple. They grew 41% in 2013. They are expected to grow at 27%
in 2014, that is a forward multiple of 9.2x.


At the midpoint of their guidance for 2014, Veeva is trading at 17x forward EV/Revenue.
Consider how crazy that is. That would be a slightly lower growth rate than SFDC, its
PAAS provider, is expected to clock at 20x their revenue base. Yet SFDC are trading at a
7x forward EV/Revenue multiple. That would put Veeva at roughly double Athena's
multiple, which is at 3x the revenue base, and still a robust penetration story. It would put
them at double Medidata, which will have generated 35% more LS cloud revenue and
60% more LS subscription revenue in 2013. Even more alarming is if we break it down
into quarters over calendar year 2014/FY2015 the growth rates decline sequentially as the
year progresses. As seen below IF they hit their guidance the Y-O-Y growth rates will drop
to 20% by year end and under 4% growth Q-O-Q at best.


Then there is the sub/prof services revenue mix issue you need to adjust for here.
Professional services revenue accounted for 30% of Veeva's total revenue in 2013 versus
17% at Medidata and 6% at Salesforce.com. This means that on the much more relevant
subscription revenue Veeva is trading at 22x forward versus 10.4x for Medidata and 7.7x
for Salesforce.com. (we left Athena out of this because despite the recurring nature of
their revenue cycle and practice management services it's not an apples to apples sub
revenue comp)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


As we pointed out earlier both these latter companies' stories are far more compelling than
Veeva's, and that is simply from a top-down basis. We point this out because many
investors and some analysts are literally looking at the trailing growth rate data and saying
'well, based on that, xyz is doable in 2014 and 2015'. If that is not what they were doing,
all of them (who they are is no secret, thanks to the slew of small float induced filings)
should literally be indiscriminately selling Veeva and piling into the above three names.
This is before getting into the fundamental issues like the value added re-seller problem
as well as the disintermediation risk, add-on mumbo jumbo, nightmarish sector
headwinds, and unbelievably obvious and easy to verify grossly overstated TAMs. Thus,
as you can see guidance of 29% is an absolute disaster at this valuation, and will
most certainly translate into at least 50% downside from its post earnings level of
$37.


Veeva's Sell-Side Coverage Debacle


We are nothing short of amazed at how bad this coverage has been, and how quick
certain analysts have been to dismiss our work.


For example, this is what Canaccord Genuity put out after the most recent earnings
announcement:


"It is hard not to chuckle when we hear plaintive cries for "catalysts." Sometimes, all
you need is for nerves to soothe, and that means seeing a company report results
that are not askew for one reason or another. These kind of results calm longs and
push bears back into their caves. We've seen this cycle play out a few dozen times
over the years - and we believe this will happen for Veeva. Specifically, if we see a
couple more solid quarterly results, it will allow investors to stop fixating on 90 day
report cards or fretting over the latest unregulated neuron firing to be posted on
Seeking Alpha."

Do you think this analyst is still chuckling? Last quarter, his note started with 'bears can
huff and puff' all they want before he upgraded his price target into a 30% decline. Seems
he has learned nothing, and is more interested in discrediting the platform where we post
our research than tackling the merits of it.


This is what he had to say about the TAM issues:


"But what about the great Addressable Market debate? For VEEV shares to keep
rising, the firm will not only have to retain its sales momentum in the core SFA
market for pharma reps, but new modules will have to be successful. We don't
model down to specific product lines because we don't get that information."


What does 'we don't get that information' mean? Someone doesn't hand it to you? You are
incapable of researching it? If anyone should 'get this information', you'd think it would be
an analyst at one of the firms that underwrote the IPO and has the privilege of asking
questions on quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences and directly to the company.
Wasn't this analyst putting out notes on Veeva to clients 9 months before Veeva went
public?


Anyway, we figured we'd help this analyst and the other five sell-side underwriters out by
providing them with some research tips.


SUHAIL CAPITAL RESEARCH TIPS FOR LS CRM


Tip #1: 46/50 of the Pharmaexec 2013 top 50 that Veeva disclosed to the SEC as their
reference list for top 50 customers are public companies. This means they have 10-Ks,
investor presentations, CSR reports, and career websites that you can turn to for
information regarding their sales force headcount. If you know how to use the internet,
these sources will allow you to get highly precise (current as of year end 2013) rep counts
for 55-60% of the top 50.


Tip # 2: These companies also all have something called an Investor Relations
Department. If you contact the ones that don't publicly disclose sales force numbers and
ask for the breakdown some will provide it, others will provide incomplete info, and the rest
will provide nothing. This should get you to 70-75%.


Tip #3: LinkedIn, Customer White Papers, Deployment Press releases, and independent
third party data providers will allow you to get the counts on the remaining names or at
least very reliable estimates on them.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2086283-veeva-irrefutable-proof-of-tam-overstatements-crm-seat-saturation-drastic-growth-deceleration-and-highly-dubious-sell-side-


By the way, the above three tips/steps will allow you to quickly map seats at about another
65+ non top 50 Veeva CRM customers.


And these are just the steps for mapping seat counts. If you want to map CRM
Deployment by pharma company try this search in Google : "Insert Pharma Company"
"Veeva" "CRM" site:linkedin.com


We can tell you that this simple search query (with some occasional modifications) will get
you all 33 of the top 50 Veeva customers. You will also find wonderful details about
deployment geographies, implementation time tables, exact users deployed in those
geographies, BI integrations, customer master integrations, and pretty much everything
you could have hoped for (consultants and project managers for implementations share
just about everything on their profiles).


When you are done with all this there is always Veeva customer summit agendas or
countless customer success stories to go through. If you want to get fancy you can try
field research, industry analysts, cafepharma.com and consultants for more info and to
double and triple check your work.


Hopefully, these tips help them 'get the information'!


CONCLUSION


Normally this is the part where we rehash our key points and put it all together. But to be
frank, if you actually made it this far you should understand why we are not going to do
that here. The way we see it any institution long this stock based on sell-side underwriter's
research or the final version of the S-1 (and subsequent quarterly disclosures) should feel
utterly humiliated by now. Plain and simple, you've been taken for a ride. All that is left to
determine at this point, is what you are going to do about it?

That is what you call fact based research....consistently staying on the conservative side, but step by step calling out
the lack of growth ahead and addressing the SFDC contract head on. Would be interested to hear if any longs have
any facts to share that weren't covered here.

Esekla, Marketplace Contributor
The contract renewal does give some credence to the Salesforce model of being a platform provider, rather than just
SaaS. I'd been looking into a major CRM correction, but it's seeming as if we've just seen all there is to see for a while
and the rising pattern is set to resume.

@suhail - thank you for putting this report together. Very interesting insights. Highly appriciated! What is missing here
is role of Veeva in Salesforce vertical strategy annouced recently. Saleforce now officially confirms their interest to
target not general CRM market but each industry vertical in a tailored way very much like what Oracle is doing. There
are 6 major verticals announced; Automotive, Manufacturing, Communitcations, Public Services, Financial Services
and Healthcare. (Source partner keynote Dreamforce 2013, and media coverage on new partner grade Fullforce -
giving partners distinct area of expertise). Salesforce repeatedly presented Veeva as an example of vertical
partnerships with ISVs). There will be more on that field because you are absolutely right it was complicated to
distinguish between using Saleforce + Custom build and when to USD Veeva. In General Veeva usually comes to
play where basic salesforce is not Pharma specific enough. Yes, you can build much on SFDC platform but it comes
down to FDA validation what diferentiates Veeva from Salesforce. Veeva is validated by FDA while Salesforce is
General CRM. So differentiator is regulations. I can honestly tell you what landed some big deals was handling
Samples. Disclosure: I am familiar with both Saleforce and Veeva and I've been involved in major 50+ countries /
5000+ users implementation replacing Siebel and several cegedim CRM instances.

Jiri75 makes in interesting indication, that he's involved in replacing "several Cegedim CRM instances." This may be
now be true, but conflicts with industry reports and even the bullish Veeva initiation report by Deutschebank, last
quarter, that said of Cegedim, "the company has never lost a client from this product."


It is my lay understanding (from taking to sales reps) that Cegedim offers a more capable set of SaaS CRM products
than Veeva, but that Veeva was offering a lower price, before Cegedim offered a matching product. Further, it is my
understanding that Veeva's cloud product(s) are vastly superior to the legacy Siebel network product, and, with
Veeva's co-founder, Matt Wallach, having run that business at Siebel, taking those clients is how Veeva is able to
grow so swiftly -- though it typically takes a year of spade work and trialing to get an client to replace a system -- even
when you have a better mousetrap.


However, what is particularly interesting about Veeva and its $5B TAM claim to me, is that the industry data indicate
that the pharmaceutical sales rep CRM market was only ~$1.1B last year, with Veeva having ~20%, Cegedim ~35%,
and Siebel ~20%, with others and incumbents making up the balance. So, if Veeva completely eats Siebel's lunch,
they could (only) double their sales to ~$400MM, but that's it, and ignores the fact that the pharmaceutical rep
database software market (on a revenue basis) is declining by 5% per year. Sure, Veeva will add incremental "silos,"
entering other markets that Cegedim and the large software vendors already serve, but these other markets are not
as big as the $1.1B market Veeva is already in. Perhaps the new total is $2B, down the road, but I have not found
anyone in healthcare to suggest that it is going to be bigger than $2.5B


So.... I suspect that Veeva is going to disappoint, but not until after we have a secondary or two, so the management
can capture a little more of the exuberance of this market. The underwriters brought it out at $14 for a reason. Only
the crazies who mistook Veeva for a mass SaaS story are to blame for putting a 21X EV/S multiple on a company
with $1 of ultimate peak earnings power.


So far, Veeva has reported two quarters, one miss and one beat. The fact that they didn't take guidance up is difficult
to parse. Perhaps they are being conservative. However, if the Consensus is right, EPS won't grow in f2015 over
f2014, because expenses are growing almost in line with sales, and the share count is expected to increase by over
5% (per year forever). How much do they have to grow to make this math work out to a reasonable valuation?

Important update. It is not uncommon that TAM is overstated by the analysts promoting a stock without providing any
evidence, but here this overstatement is reaching ridiculous size. On the contrary the author was very accurate in
demonstrating why this growth is impossible to sustain. In this article he take an additional step: after 2014 there is
chance this growth will get negative because of competition. This is not KO neither JNJ, where you can extrapolating
past growth in the future with little risk. Too many companies are offering similar products without a significant moat.

jiri75
@flat curve - very good points thank you. Let me add some clarification on CEGEDIM vs Veeva. In the case I've been
talking about we have been engaged in standardization of 50+ countries on Veeva that preceded several months of
testing alongside legacy Siebel (that runs the core of this major Pharma company for 10+ years), Cegedim CRM (that
has been legacy from acquisitions of several companies mainly in Europe) and Veeva CRM (that runs 4 Nordics
counties). The company has decided to standardise on Veeva exactly for the reason you mentioned - replacement of
Siebel with much more modern by architecture and Pharma specific such Bricks, Samples, CLM and other highly
Pharma specific stuff. Cegedim is good but problem is underlying platform - Salesforce is seen by far robust to run
such operations and also because salesforce is Oracle and Java based transition for developers and admins of Siebel
was much faster. However Cegedim revenue not vanished they even gained by this transition because instead of
using Cegedim CRM in single instances we used Cegedim One Key as a data provided that has been connected with
Operarional Database that fuels all systems such as DMS and others not just CRM with key accounts data. Here the
key was how well Veeva is thanks it is Pharma based architecture work with such data. Give you example Account in
Salesforce has to two addresses directly on account object. In Pharma we need more addresss therefore Veeva has it
as separate object. Other thing is hierarchy that is based on territory and Veeva allow you to work with both Bricks
and Zip. And if you familiar with Pharma regulations you know Brick and Zip will have major impact on compliance
based on Teritiorry and for example what Samples you can deliver. Both Veeva and Cegedim works great together
and Cegedim is an excellent data provider. Veeva however benefits from data model that is far more Pharma specific
(and thus Pharma regulations compliant) then Siebel or Salesforce that are general. Beacuse Veeva made a a clever
thing they used force.com as foundation but they made many very Pharma specific workarounds that are not yet easy
achieve in general systems. There are many regulations around Calls, Terrritoies and Samples that are constantly
changing and vary by location which makes nightmare to do in Siebel but these are also reason for heavy fines to
Pharma companies. Don't forget GSK got 3 billion usd by FDA for wrong marketing of their product. That's why Veeva
can charge premium. Because as one CIO of major Pharma company said when they explained why Veeva - it was
only solution that match our compliance requirements for samples and calls.

What does Genentech say? They moved off Veeva onto Salesforce. Does you comment mean that they are
not compliant? I guess they are compliant.


Why wouldn't the Big Pharma do what Genentech did and customize Force.com in the same way as Veeva
and pay significantly less?


Veeva has the same data weaknesses as Salesforce. It gets round those by workarounds. I imagine
Genentech does the same.

wouldn't other companies do the same? Is that a possibility? And why isn't Vault built on Salesforce (as the
client has already paid the Force.com license)?


14 Mar 2014, 05:29 PM

@ScotsPx Roche-Basel (HQ) went with custom salesforce and it installed it at other locations around the
world. After it acquired Genetech, it put Roche folks in charge of Genentech. Along with removing
Genentech's management, Roche also removed Genentech's systems so that Genentech would be using
what Roche and its other companies are using. It wouldn't make sense for Roche to allow Genentech to use a
system that's not used or supported in the rest of the company.


It's really standard business practice - this happens all the time in acquisitions.

You just going to keep saying the sky is green to people who can look up and see it is blue. For 3 months you
have been serially posting the same nonsense or trying to 'discredit' our content with flat out false statements.
The details of the entire roche implmentation(timeline, systems replaced, etc) are linked in a slideshare
presentation which is free for all to see. As for the genentech merger date as well as migration of roche usa
from siebel to veeva and then the subsequent shift off veev four years later, all that can all be found online.
Your agenda is clear, but everything you are doing is a waste of time. Truth eventually comes out. Facts do
matter.

@suhail you are comparing apples to oranges. The publicly available slideshare presentation (linked) is the
HQ-international effort. Notice that it never mentions Veeva because HQ-international never used Veeva.


The linkedin profile of guy you are using for your primary research (linked) is for Roche-USA.


Roche-HQ-International acquired Genentech (not Roche-USA). Again, Roche-HQ made the decision to
standardize all its companies under custom SFDC. Why is this very simple concept not clear to you?

@suhail you talk a lot about "simple concept" but you fail to understand them.


Simple concept 1 (Integration 101): You don't disrupt a multi-billion dollar business that you just acquired.
Changes have to be methodical and planned out. You don't change things nilly willy (Hey! Let's rip out their
CRM just for the fun of it). This is why Roche-HQ put in their own people to run Genentech PRIOR to doing
lower priority things.


Simple concept 2 (Application rollout 101): For an enterprise-wide application, you have to first pilot it before
rolling it out across your multi-national enterprise. Your pilot should be conducted globally but in smaller
locations (to limit damage in case something goes wrong). You absolutely do NOT pilot a custom app in your

Fantastic research and ultimately you'll be right, but it won't be VEEV's actions that do it, it'll be the major institutions
starting to pull out of high flyers causing a domino affect on pricing.


VEEV will be flushed down the toilet with CRM, N, WDAY, DATA, MKTO and all the other 'cloud' stocks. Maybe even
the great AMZN will meet its maker, but I've claimed that stock invincible so I doubt it.


But don't fight the Fed.


Wait for the taper to continue. This may take another year before all of these ridiculously priced stocks come crashing
down.

@scotspx - in case of Roche problem was that Roche had salesforce before they acquired Genentech and if they
already invested heavily into customisation of salesforce and were happy about it - they stand before simple question.
Are we move Roche to what Genentech is using or move Genentech to Roche? Result you know already. Veeva is
relatively new product and therefore there will be many who solve the same requirements with different solution.

@jiri75 "situation in Europe here it was SFDC" is what Roche-HQ was doing. What Roche-HQ does dictates
what Roche does (obviously).


As you know and have stated, Roche-HQ invested heavily in custom SFDC. They piloted the customSFDC at
smaller locations in APAC and around the world. As you probably know, this takes years to roll out, test and
validate. Roche-US is huge so Roche-HQ did not roll out customSFDC until all the pilots were conducted and
signed off.

Roche was only as one of my friends worked on a SFDC project therefore I know they have SFDC.

Interesting write-up.


I'd question your relative valuation conclusions relative to peers though:


"At the midpoint of their guidance for 2014, Veeva is trading at 17x forward EV/Revenue. Consider how crazy that is.
That would be a slightly lower growth rate than SFDC, its PAAS provider, is expected to clock at 20x their revenue
base. Yet SFDC are trading at a 7x forward EV/Revenue multiple. "


One obvious difference is that VEEV is highly profitable, with a ttm GAAP operating margin of 27% vs pretty much
universally unprofitable peers (including Salesforce - at 20x the revenue base!).


I think that goes a long way to explaining the valuation premium (at least from the market's perspective). VEEV has a
proven business model - it's certainly fair to question how large the market is, but at least they have proven they can

SUB REV is what drives the valuations of these stocks. EV14 for SFDC is 7.7x and VEEV is 22x (according
to the article above). Yet VEEVA uses the SFDC platform? And VEEV clients are free to migrate to SFDC
when they feel like it? And yet VEEV has committed to pay SFDC $500m?


All the cards in this game are held by SFDC the "platform" provider. None by VEEV. Yet VEEV is values

The key part of your post is "Genentech users in the United States". Meaning Veeva never had an agreement
with Roche-HQ (international). Roche-HQ already invested heavily in SFDC customization. They continued to
use Veeva while migration / integration was happening to limit business disruption (basic integration 101).
Then, once Roche-HQ was done, it let the contract run out.


What would you expect Roche-HQ to do? 
A) Write off millions in custom SFDC work and go with Veeva. 
B) Continue rolling out custom SFDC and end Veeva contract. 
C) Keep every existing acquired CRM solution and integrate them to custom SFDC.


When you look at all the options (unless you can think of other options?), it's really simple and straight-
forward why Roche-HQ did what it did.


Nothing to get excited about unless you're someone (read bottom disclaimer) that "stands to realize
significant gains in the event that the price of Veeva should decline".

@quadrant8 my question to you was how does management explain that they "sold" the idea (when doing the
IPO) that Genentech was a customer then filed 8-K explicitly showing that they had lost Genentech before the
IPO.


It's about trust in the management. You know?


One of the 3 clients was not a client. In your contacts with the management, how did they explain this?


18 Mar 2014, 05:45 PM


quadrant8
@ScotsPx Ask yourself this: If they were trying to pump up Veeva, why didn't they say that ROCHE was also
a customer? That would be dishonest wouldn't it?


If they were going to sensationalize the Genentech relationship then they would mention Roche either directly
or indirectly like, "Genentech, a Roche company."


If you want to blame anyone for putting the Genentech name out there, blame the news reporters for not
checking their facts and using the same information that the first report issued. But I don't blame them. They
were using factually accurate information. One article used the past tense and that would be accurate since
Veeva did sign up Genentech as a customer ("signed up at least 170 customers including industry behemoths
such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Genentech").


The "sky is falling" doom and gloom scenario that some would want you to believe would only be true if
Roche acquired all of Veeva's customers and forced them to use Roche customSFDC.

Author’s reply »  Roche/Genentech merger- March 2009


Roche sfdc first poc- Jan 2011


They were on stay in front and siebel all across the globe. This is getting old. They were NOT 'already
invested heavily in sfdc'. In fact, they migrated their US team onto veeva vis a vis genentech, and then down
the road made a decision to build a custom instead of buying from Veeva.


What is amusing here is that you somehow think it is irrelevant that Roche passed on Veeva despite having
had nearly 2 years to select it to replace siebel/stay in front. And despite the fact that their wholly owned US
susbsidiary was on Veeva.


We understand what you are trying to do. You think if you keep posting that we didn't provide adequate
disclosures(our initial report disclosures are identical to this one...so you clearly have not read that report) or
that this was a simple no big deal integration that this will somehow 'discredit us'. This is why in all your posts
you have had absolutely nothing to say about asp's, market penetration, TAM's, underwriter research,
management commentary or lack there of etc. 
You seem to think we are attacking Veeva the business, but that is not what is going on here. We are making
a case against the business when viewed within the context of the share price, assumptions being made,
disclosures being provided etc. If you cannot view things through this prism, you are wasting your time here.
As we pointed out in our initial report, Veeva can win every top 50 pharma seat and we'd value the company
at a fraction of where it is today. Reality is that is not happening, and that their opportunity is far smaller than
initially believed and the landscape far more challenging. And this is even before one starts looking at just
what is going on pricing wise in this space. But these things don't matter to you because you clearly are
attached to this company in some way shape or form(we are guessing employee or underwater investor). See
if Veeva was at $5 we would be quite bullish on the stock and the company, and would consider all these
issues(outside of the utter lack of transparency) largely moot. Our conviction comes from extensive research
and nothing else. If tomorrow we start to think that pharma companies are planning to spend 5x what they are
spending today on crm, we will change our mind. Of course, once you do the work we have you will
understand why that is never going to happen.

looking into just why this stock ended up doing what it did. There is nothing new here. This is business as
usual on wall street, and soon enough you will get that.

If you bother to investigate you will find that Genentech found that the Veeva system did not meet the needs
of Genentech. Genentech did what Veeva did. Built on SFDC. Genentech are not integrated into Roche as
you seem to suggest. Look at this (4:00 mins): http://bit.ly/1dehF15 - indicates that decisions were not taken
as you suggest.


Hospira, Baxter International, Allergan, Fresenius all have SFDC apps rather than Veeva. Why wouldn't more
leave Veeva?

@scotspx Genentech did not build its own customSFDC - Roche-HQ did. That is why the video is called,
"Continuous Integration in Genentech & Roche Development".

Incorrect statement (add to the others you made here earlier)


#1 check your facts - it's not difficult 
#2 look at the video. it shows there are 2 different ways that they design SFDC apps - no reason for that if
your statement is true. 
#3 talk with someone who has more knowledge of this technology than you

The point is that Genentech loss is a negative for VEEV and shows his vulnerability.  
If it will be a one time event or will be followed by other losses remain to be seen, but in any case it is just one

I see the current stock offering very negative for the stock, as the proceeds will not go to the company. No reason for
the stock to go up.

Obviously the secondary is nothing more than a vehicle for insiders to unload stock.


"The use of proceeds" disclosure in the S1 is exactly the same as the IPO except that they added: 
-obtain additional capital 
-increase our public float


the purpose of the offering is to "obtain additional capital"? Wow, that is a redundant statement if ever I heard
one.


They have been free cash flow positive for the last 3 years and yet after raising $214 mil in an IPO less than
six month ago they are doing a secondary now? It's pretty transparent what their motivations are.

@HaydenCole "They have been free cash flow positive for the last 3 years and yet after raising $214 mil in an
IPO less than six month ago they are doing a secondary now?"


You must have missed this part: " Veeva Systems will not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by
existing stockholders. The number of shares to be sold and the allocation of the shares between Veeva
Systems and existing stockholders have not yet been determined."

I didn't miss anything. Insiders can sell on the open market at the end of the lock-up in a few weeks time,
regardless. They are doing a secondary now under the guise of the company raising cash as a vehicle of
insiders to unload stock in an orderly fashion.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. However, we do not currently have specific planned uses of the proceeds.

Class A common stock offered 
By us 
890,000 shares


By the selling stockholders 
11,110,000 shares


Total 
12,000,000 shares


$25m is what they want to raise based on the 890 figure. Seems a pretty small sum to me. Why would they
wanna do that?

Just added another new position in VEEV. This is my third sortie since the Veeva bashing with two handsome wins.
This time I will let it rise to $50. Imo there is little or no risk to the downside from here. I am not an expert in VEEV
business model nor do I have material insider information but my job is to keep making money rather than being right
in the argument. Market can be irrational longer than one is solvent ..so they

I was long Veeva when the first of these Suhail articles came out. I forget the exact number but it was around 39 or
40.00. I sold my entire position because what was written in the article made sense to me. I ended up making a very
modest profit.


Then I bought puts... June 35 to be exact. I exited the Put yesterday for a 25% gain.


The one thing i have learned is the only thing that matters is making money. There is such an overriding need to kill
the messenger and not listen to the message.

Point & Figure technical analysis suggests that the price target for VEEV is $14.

When looking at the last 17 trading days VEEV is down 36% intraday. Booking a double on my puts - can't help but
think that some covering will cause a purely technical retracement.


I'll look to reestablish higher though I'll not be surprised if get left behind. I'm probably trying to be way too cute, but
thank you and congrats (so far) to Suhail!
