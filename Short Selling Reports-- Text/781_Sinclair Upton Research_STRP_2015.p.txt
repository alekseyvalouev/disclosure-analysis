Straight Path Communications Inc. (STRP) 
How to commit fraud against the FCC and get away with it (until now) 





Executive Summary 
 There is overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of Straight Path Communications' 


("Straight Path") 39 GHz  spectrum licenses' Required Notification of Construction/Coverage 
Applications were obtained under fraudulent misrepresentation, because the systems were 
never built on the sites as specified in the filings.  
 


 Michael Rapaport, as a representative of IDT Spectrum and Spectrum Holdings Technologies 
("IDT"), the transferors of Straight Path's 39 GHz licenses, has likely committed over 150+ 
counts of fraud against the US government and made  a mockery of the FCC's trust-based 
license renewal process. Instead of spending vast amounts of time, money, and resources to 
actually building up the required 39 GHz wireless sites in the 173 Basic Economic Areas (BEA) 
across the country, IDT/Rapaport gamed the system by filing construction/coverage substantial 
service Required Notifications that would pass FCC renewal process with nothing but a word 
processor. 
 


 Almost all of the 39 GHz systems that are claimed to be "constructed" by IDT to provide 
Substantial Service as required for their 39 GHz license renewals in 2011-2012, cannot possibly 
been able to meet their performance specifications, as their purported systems defy the laws 
of physics, geometry, economics, and common sense. Readers, investors, and the FCC can 
easily verify for themselves that IDT’s systems were never built or operating at the time of 
renewal. 
 


 Even if Straight Path's licenses have any value at all (which they don't), because they were 
renewed under false statements of coverage/construction, the licenses are at high risk of being 
terminated and stripped from Straight Path's ownership. Thus, the fair value of Straight Path 
stock without ownership of the 39 GHz licenses and being banned from future FCC spectrum 
participation is $1.00-2.00 per share, or approximately liquidation value. 





 We urge the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and regulatory authorities to 
immediately open an investigation into the license renewal process of Straight Path's 39 GHz 
licenses and ask Straight Path for proof that the Required Constructions were met for all of the 
systems claimed to be built in the 173 Basic Economic Areas. Companies should not be allowed 
to lie to the US Government and get away with it.

Background 
 
In early 2011, IDT Spectrum, LLC (“IDT”) a subsidiary of IDT Corporation, had a big problem and it 
needed a solution, and it needed it fast. At that time, IDT owned 931 licenses in the 39 GHz spectrum 
and those licenses would expire and be terminated by June 1, 2012, unless IDT could show that it met 
the substantial service requirements of Section 101.17(a). If IDT did not meet those requirements, they 
would not be able to keep those licenses until the next expiration date of October 18, 2020, which 
would cost them their investment in those licenses. 
 
Under FCC renewal requirements for each license, IDT had to show that they constructed systems to 
either 1) broadcast 39 GHz signals with 4 point-to-point links per 1 million population within each 
county-sized Basic Economic Area (BEA) service areas or 2) under the point-to-multipoint safe harbor 
established for LMDS provide coverage to 20 percent of the population of the license's BEA service area. 
For each BEA, there are 14 licenses consisting of 100 MHz Channels between 38.6-40.0 GHz. However, 
leasing the sites for the systems, building the hardware, and operating the radio and antennas in all 173 
BEAs across all 50 states would cost a lot of money, at least $10-12 million dollars by another (now 
bankrupt) spectrum holder company’s estimates.  
 
Enter Michael Rapaport.  
 
Rapaport, former president of IDT Spectrum, LLC, came up with a working, but illegal solution. First, IDT 
would build 1 actual, real system (we believe this is the system covering San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose 
in BEA163 filed on 7/28/10), get it renewed by the FCC, and use that paperwork as a template to make 
fillings in all the other 172 BEAs. This is acceptable, if IDT actually built the systems.  
 
But, IDT did not actually build most, if not all of the other 172 systems as required, but still filed the 
Required Notification of Construction/Coverages falsely asserting that they did build them. The FCC, 
lacking the manpower to inspect each and every application, and having a trust-based license renewal 
process, approved those licenses for renewal, and IDT got almost all of their licenses renewed cross-
country. This was quite unusual, because the other large holders of 39 GHz licenses (FiberTower, 
Airband), attempted to renew but still failed to meet the substantial service requirements and let their 
licenses expire.  
 
In mid-2012, IDT and Rapaport had another similar problem. Rapaport, through his company Spectrum 
Holdings Technologies, LLC (“Spectrum Holdings”), acquired 200 licenses in 39 GHz from Level 3 and 
PTPMS Communications in 122 BEAs that were about to expire because the substantial service 
requirements were due on June 1, 2012. Spectrum Holdings was assigned ownership of these licenses 
on May 31, 2012. Amazingly, after just 12 days after getting the licenses, by June 12, 2012, Spectrum 
Holdings filed their Notifications of Construction/Coverage for every license. How did Spectrum Holdings 
build up systems in every state in the country in just 12 days? The answer is, they didn’t. Spectrum 
Holdings simply used the same template as IDT, used find/replace in a word processor to change IDT to 
Spectrum Holdings, left the rest of the specifications and locations of the site exactly the same, and got 
these new licenses approved. Problem solved. In 2013, Spectrum Holdings assigned their licenses to 
Straight Path Communications, who also now owns the former IDT Spectrum licenses. 
 
The FCC is very clear on the requirements for construction/coverage and substantial service, it is not a 
theoretical exercise for potential or hypothetical signals coming from a proposed system. At the time of 
the filing, the system must be broadcasting and operational. If IDT and Spectrum Holdings renewed their

39 GHz licenses under the fraudulent misrepresentation that the systems existed and met the 
requirements when in reality they did not, then their licenses should never have been renewed in the 
first place and should now be taken away from them now. Plus, there is the tiny issue about lying to the 
Federal Government, who, like most people, does not like being lied to. 
 
In this report, we show evidence that many, if not all of the 39 GHz system sites that 
IDT/Spectrum/Straight Path purported to build were never built nor operating to the required 
performance specifications to meet substantial service.  We were not able to check or prove that each 
and every site was fictional. However, because we believe almost every single Required Notification 
filing was fraud, we are confident that anyone who investigates a random sample of 10 sites purported 
to be built will discover the truth that they never existed. In the appendix, we present a full list of the 
relevant FCC Universal Licensing System (ULS) Application file numbers so that readers, investors, and 
the FCC can verify our claims for themselves.

Example #1 
IDT Spectrum, LLC Application File #0004842980, Call Sign WPQV276, North Platte, NE, BEA121 
 
Let’s start with a look at the Substantial Service Notification Application of IDT Spectrum, LLC, filed on 
August 17, 2011, found using the FCC ULS Application website:

The details of how the substantial service was demonstrated is below. With the purported system IDT 
covers 45,926 people or 73.34% of the population in BEA121. The system hardware is a “Tx Power 
Modified Digital Microwave XP 4 (Avago 6442 in parallel), with a strength of 33 dBm. Both locations 
have an Rx Threshold (1Mb/s data rate) of -90 dBm. The Hub Antenna gain is 40 dBi, and the Remote 
Antenna gain (quad 2 foot antenna array) is 48 dBi.”

The Friis Transmission Equation calculations in logarithmic form for this particular site is below. This just 
says that at the maximum radius of 52.8 miles around the site, receiving antennas can get at least -90 
dBm or 1 picowatt of power from the transmitting antenna signal.

So theoretically, based on the filing’s claims, IDT’s system provides substantial service to BEA 121 and 
they should get the license renewed for the 39 GHz license there. And the FCC did renew this license on 
11/8/11. 
 
So what is fishy about this filing, and why do we believe that IDT never actually built the system,  much 
less have it operating and performing as they claim?  
 
The North Platte, NE site cannot be, and was never used for IDT’s system 
 
We can see what the site looks like in person, thanks to Google Maps Street View: 
 



https://www.google.com/maps/place/41%C2%B006'18.0%22N+100%C2%B045'46.8%22W/@41.1051455,-100.763547,3a,75y,105.18h,87.58t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBMZ4XLPhQYSnU0bz4EIf2g!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DBMZ4XLPhQYSnU0bz4EIf2g%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb

Source: Google Maps Street View, location (41.105006, -100.762986) 
 
If you pan around, you can see that all the buildings are 1 story tall (15 feet), and there are no cell phone 
towers or tall structures over 5 stories tall in the immediate vicinity. Giving IDT the benefit of the doubt, 
even if IDT’s site location was mistyped and they didn’t build a tower on top of the Overland Trails Boy 
Scouts Service Center, the maximum height of the antenna is around 75 feet tall. We checked a random 
sampling of multiple sites that IDT claims to be built, and never found any evidence that systems were 
built (except for the San Fran and New York exceptions). 
 
This is relevant, because at 75 feet high, the maximum distance to the horizon is only 10.6 miles. 
However, in the filing the signal range radius claimed by IDT is 52.8 miles. This is from an antenna 
powered at 33 dBm, or 2 watts. To compare, a normal cell phone device has power of 1-2 watts. A really 
tall cell tower has a max range 45 miles but using 10 watts and at under 3 GHz frequencies. Could IDT 
really have transmitted at 1/10 the power level of a cell phone tower a signal at 1 Mbit/second 52.8 
miles away?  
 
Unless IDT built an 1,845 foot tall structure (50% higher than the Empire State Building!) and placed 
their transmitting antenna on top of it, it was impossible for IDT to provide substantial service in 39 GHz 
for this site at a 52.8 mile radius around it. If the antenna was only 75 feet tall, and the coverage radius 
is decreased to 10.6 miles, the much smaller area could cause the population covered to fall below 20% 
of the area and the license to be rejected for renewal. We believe this is further evidence that IDT was 
gaming the system by stating coverage radii that are so large to be completely unrealistic just to get the 
license renewed. 
 
Not only is the system’s claimed performance an impossibility that violates the laws of geometry (and 
physics as propagation for 39 GHz is 1-2 kilometers), IDT never leased space there to place their 
antennas and equipment. 
 
So did IDT really built their wireless 39 GHz system as stated on their application that led to the renewal 
of their 39 GHz licenses in BEA 121, North Platte, NE? Almost certainly they did not build anything, much

they committed outright fraud against the FCC.

place an antenna. But, to get a radius of 33.5 miles, IDT would have to put the antenna 750 feet high, or 
75 stories, above the ground. Maybe IDT built a really tall tower on top of the supermarket or Jiffy Lube 
nearby?

Errors and typos in IDT’s and Spectrum Holdings expose a copy-paste, find-replace process of “robo-
filing” 
 
IDT Spectrum, LLC Application File #0004688413, Call Sign WPQU240, New York-No. New Jer.-Long Isl, 
BEA010 
 
The system that IDT claims to have built on top of the IDT Corporation headquarters building at 520 
Broad Street, New Jersey, NJ, is a case of where their find/replace, copy-paste system of “building” sites 
goes wrong and is more evidence of falsifying documents. 
 
Below is the first demonstration of construction/coverage filing IDT made for their BEA010 site, first 
filed on 4/13/11:

So this filing, with the highlighted comments and errors, stayed in the FCC system from 4/13/11 until 
6/23/11, when IDT realized their mistakes and then filed amendment #1 on 6/23/11, and then 
amendment #2 on 7/21/11.  
 
If you look at amendment #2’s filing’s system specifications and radius, you can see that IDT changed the 
power from 20 dBm to 33 dB and added the Link Margin Friis calculation, in-line with the standard filing 
template, and the radius was decreased from 21 miles to 14.9 miles.

Source: Substantial Service Application, amendment #2, for IDT Spectrum for call sign WPQV276, 
7/21/11 
 
We believe that these amendments and changes to the filing indicate the easily-made word processing 
errors inherent in the process of fabricating most of the 173 substantial service demonstration 
requirements.  
 
On the other hand, of all the 173 sites IDT claims to have built, the New York site is probably the only 1 
other actual site actually built, in addition to the first site for San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose in BEA163. 
The reason is because this location is at IDT Corporation headquarters, which IDT Spectrum obviously 
has access to and permission to place antennas and equipment on the roof. However, the errors seen in 
the initial filing come from trying to adapt a falsified template method (thus the copy-paste errors), with 
the actual specs of the system that the engineers may have designed and built. 
 
The site covering San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose in BEA163, file #0004338108, being the first filing and 
at the location for Endgate Associates/Doug Lockie residence/office, may also be a real site because IDT 
Spectrum would have access to the building and permission to put an antenna on it.

Economic and common sense reasons why IDT Spectrum didn’t build out 173 wireless sites 
 
Besides the already overwhelming evidence already supporting our thesis that IDT Spectrum falsified 
their construction/coverage requirements and didn’t actually build the systems, we list here some 
further reasons why the sites are largely fictional 
 
As these reasons are mostly common sense, we simply state them here and leave the exercise of 
verification to the readers, investors, and the FCC. 
 


1. On October 13, 2010, Michael Rapaport signed the “Spectrum Portfolio Agreement” with IDT for 
his profit sharing and development cost sharing for getting IDT’s 39 GHz licenses renewed. By 
November 29, 2011, or just 13 months later, how was he able to build out 173 wireless sites? 
Note that Rapaport stated that he was working primarily by himself and subcontractors to find 
potential locations for the sites, negotiate with the multiple parties involved (building owner, 
land owner, local municipalities) to place an antenna on a roof, hire a firm to climb on the roofs 
of the hotel/office building/residential house/apartment, install and configure the antenna,  
 


2. According to the court filings of the IDT Corporation v. Rapaport litigation, Rapaport spent just 
$700,000 developing, renewing and building out the “substantial service” required for all 173 
IDT sites and 122 Spectrum Holdings sites? Even if IDT shouldered 82% of the costs, according to 
the Spectrum Portfolio Agreement, that gives a total cost for development of $3.9 million dollars, 
way too small for the number of sites, difficult geographies, and short time required. FiberTower 
claims a similar project would have cost them $10-12 million. 
 


3. The costs of development and ongoing lease sites for IDT’s 173 “buildouts” do not appear 
anywhere in the SEC filings’ financial statements in any year between 2002-2015 of IDT 
Corporation, the S-1 IPO prospectus of IDT Spectrum, or Straight Path Communications. The 
costs of building the sites out and the ongoing lease expenses (usual telecom rooftop lease is 5-
25 years) would either be expensed or capitalized and show up in the financials. 
 


4. The lawyers (Wilkie Farr & Gallagher LLP) and IDT employees (Greg Haledijian, Joseph Sandri, Jr.) 
who had historically signed off on IDT Spectrum, LLC’s FCC filings (see file #0003401972 for 
example), did not sign any of IDT’s construction/coverage filings. Instead, Michael Rapaport is 
the sole signer of the construction/coverage filings, a red flag that perhaps the company’s legal 
counsel was not comfortable with putting their name behind the filings, which are largely 
misrepresentations. 
 


5. How come IDT was the only large holder of 39 GHz spectrum that could meet the substantial 
service requirements and renew their licenses before the June 1, 2012 date? The answer is that 
IDT never actually constructed anything. This is not fair to FiberTower, Airband, and other 
companies who made bona fide attempts to keep their spectrum, but were rejected by the FCC 
and their licenses were terminated. If the systems weren’t built and operating, IDT’s current 
ownership of 39 GHz spectrum is misappropriation of US Government assets under false 
pretenses, and the licenses should be stripped from them and given back to the FCC.

Compare IDT’s sites to real sites that other companies are operating real sites in 39 GHz 
 
Out of the 2,422 total potential 39 GHz licenses, we did find 16 construction filings made by other 
companies that appear to be legitimately constructed. The reasons why we think they are legitimate is 
because the radius of coverage is under 20 miles, and the locations are found in a centralized area 
usually on company property. It is easy and cheap to put a 39 GHz antenna on your own property in a 
single city. It’s not that easy to build them in 173 locations across the country. 
 
Here, we give a single example of Nextlink’s location in San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose BEA163 to show 
what a real site looks like.

Notice that the building location’s address and latitude/longitude is at the XO Communications building, 
the parent of Nextlink Wireless. In contrast, IDT’s sites, at the hotels, apartment buildings, and 
commercial buildings are not IDT-owned property. Also note that their lawyers signed off on the filing. 
Also note that their antennas are directional, not perfect circle radius like IDT’s systems.

Conclusion 


The truth about Straight Path’s licenses and the false construction/coverage claims will eventually come 


out from the source. The fraud is just too massive, too spread out, and too easily verifiable. If the 


individuals and corporations involved attempt to cover up the truth, they will just compound their 


mistakes. Lying to the Federal Government is already really bad, covering it up is even worse. We 


recommend any individuals involved to come clean to the FCC and other regulatory bodies immediately. 


As short sellers, we have economic incentives in seeing Straight Path’s stock decline. But we aren’t doing 


this solely for the money. Like police detectives, who earn a living by making our society a better place, 


we also are paid to illuminate the truth, expose fraud, and uphold justice. 


Despite the debate, uproar and controversy that will erupt after the claims of this report are verified, 


please keep in mind that short selling is good for investors, good for the markets, and ultimately good 


for America.
