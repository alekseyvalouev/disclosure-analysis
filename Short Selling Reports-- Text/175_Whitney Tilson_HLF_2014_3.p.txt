How Has Herbalife Kept The Game Going For So Long?

by: Whitney Tilson


I had the pleasure of meeting the guy who writes under the handle Quoth the Raven last
week when he came to New York City to see Ackman's presentation in person (I had no
idea who he was prior to that - I just liked reading his stuff). He's a very smart investor with
a good nose for fraud and deception (not just with Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) - see the other
stuff he's written on this site) and he's really done his work on Herbalife - more than
anyone I've seen outside of Pershing Sq. He published his magnum opus yesterday
entitled '24 Ways Herbalife Is Mocking The Regulators', which does an excellent job of
summarizing all of the immoral and illegal things he thinks the company is doing. Here's
the beginning:

Summary


· As I wrote yesterday, sentiment among a lot of Herbalife bulls is that they concede
the company is deceptive, but invest because they think regulators are spineless.


· So, Herbalife continues business as usual, inclusive of these 24 ways that it's
mocking regulators on a daily basis.


· Per its own internal strategy documents, Herbalife targets those that live in extreme
poverty and who may not have the education necessary to understand they're being
defrauded.


· This is more than an investment thesis, these are ethical and moral wrongdoings
that need the full on attention of those smart enough to discern it.


· From a personal standpoint, allowing this company to operate does a huge
disservice to the country that I have also been a major beneficiary of my whole life.


I think by now it's obvious that the market seemed to shrug off Mr. Ackman's
Manhattan presentation on Herbalife's Nutrition Clubs given earlier this week. I
continue to contend that the information delivered in the presentation was rock-solid
evidence of a massive business model flaw that's hiding under the Nutrition Clubs
that are producing as much as 40% of the company's revenue.


In other words, Mr. Ackman's claims are extremely material to the company, its
investors, and regulators. Simply put, if Mr. Ackman is proven right and Nutrition
Clubs have to be shut down or modified in the way they operate, it's going to cripple
Herbalife's growth - quickly.


As I read this, it reminded me of one part of Ackman's presentation (posted here) that I
wasn't quite satisfied with in which he addressed one of the most common arguments
made by Herbalife and its supporters: if the company is such a fraud, how come it's gone
on for so long and gotten to be so big without it being shut down? Ackman's answer, the
"Big Lie" phenomenon, is incomplete I think. In my mind, there are four answers (in
descending order of importance):


1) The fact that Quoth the Raven came up with 24 (!) items to highlight underscores how
complex Herbalife is. Even after more than two years of focused effort by untold numbers
of people and the expenditure of $50 million, Ackman and his team are still coming up with
new information and insights. This complexity makes it really hard for investors and
regulators to get their heads around what's going on - and, as we saw on Tuesday, really

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2345145-how-has-herbalife-kept-the-game-going-for-so-long 3/85


hard for Ackman (or, in fairness, anyone else) to make a simple, clear, succinct case
against the company. There's always a "But wait, what about this…" argument and/or data
point the company or its supporters make.


2) Even after one has done the exhaustive fact finding and analysis to understand all of
the bad things Herbalife is doing, the laws and regulations governing this industry are
unclear. There are few bright lines and most multi-level marketers (MLMs) are clever
enough to operate in the vast gray areas. The devil is in the details to determine if
something is a legitimate MLM (e.g., Pampered Chef, which is owned by Berkshire
Hathaway) or an illegal one (e.g., BurnLounge).


Even when people agree on the facts, there can be big differences of opinion as to
whether Herbalife is legal - for example, a prominent bull publicly called HLF "scumbags",
but is still very bullish on the stock. Because of the ambiguity in the laws and regulations,
countless MLMs (mostly private companies) are doing sleazy things - and only the most
extreme violators are being shut down.


Incidentally, I think China has it right: just ban all MLMs (in the sense that it would be
illegal to pay people for building a downline; I have no problem with a company recruiting
people to sell its products to their family and friends and making a commission on it (like
Pampered Chef) - it's anything related to the "business opportunity" where most of the
abuses occur). Sure, that would hurt some legitimate businesses, but I think the whole
sector is so poisoned by bad actors that drastic action is necessary.


3) As much as I don't like to admit it, there are elements of Herbalife's business that are
legitimate - there is a veneer of legitimacy, however thin - that makes it a tough nut to
crack (as Ackman and other shorts like me are learning the hard way). Ackman claims
that Herbalife is exactly like BurnLounge, but I don't think it is. While they are very similar,
it's not the same open-and-shut case. Herbalife has some sales outside of the network -
just not very much. It has some profitable, happy distributors - just not very many.


On the spectrum of MLMs, with Pampered Chef at one end and BurnLounge on the other,
I'd say Herbalife is 80-90% of the way toward the latter - but not 100%, which makes the
company that much harder to bring down. As Charlie Munger once said, "If you mix raisins
and turds, they're still turds." Herbalife has enough raisins floating around to convince a lot
of people to ignore the turds - especially if it's in their self interest to do so (e.g., Herbalife
is a good client of Wall Street so analysts aren't going to say a critical word; it pays
prominent people a lot of money to endorse it; it spends tens of millions of dollars annually
on public relations and lobbyists, etc.).

Comments (326)


Ackman and his team have done yeoman's work collecting extraordinary amounts of
information and using it to make a compelling argument that Herbalife, at its core, is a
predatory, illegal business - but this is a judgment call that investors and regulators (and, I
suspect, eventually, courts) have to make.


4) Lastly, Michael Johnson and his team at Herbalife are really clever. There's a reason
this company has become the largest and most profitable MLM (and it's not because the
powder it's selling has magical properties, contrary to widespread claims by many
Herbalife boosters). I think Ackman was right when he said on Tuesday that Johnson will
go into the fraudster Hall of Fame alongside Bernie Madoff. The parallels are striking: both
of them operate/operated in loosely regulated industries with lots of gray areas; both were
charismatic, smooth, polished - and exceptional liars; both were very clever in building and
maintaining a veneer of legitimacy; both cleverly parried the occasional inquiry from
regulators and the media; and both attracted the attention of dogged whistleblowers.


The only question now is whether Ackman will prove to be more successful than Harry
Markopolos in catalyzing regulators to take action. I'm betting that the answer is yes for
two reasons: a) Ackman has the deep pockets to match the company's; and b) I've known
Ackman for nearly 30 years and I've never encountered anyone who's more driven and
persistent when he's convinced he's right.

I completely agree with you, Ackman and anyone else against Herbalife. I saw a lot of local friends in Miami get
sucked into it and I tried to warn them but I was perceived as someone who was "jealous" who didn't want them to
"succeed". I actually looked at other public MLM and wrote a negative piece on Blyth which is run by a crooked
management team, don't know if you have ever looked at it or what the company did to investors for the past 5 years.

Ackman's "Best presentation of his life" was the biggest dud ever! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! They're still
mopping up the crocodile tears Ackman shed. Smart shorts have already begun to exit --- who is going to be
the bag holder here?


HLF will be in business for generations to come b/c their products and business opportunity work. Don't
believe me, no problem.  
Ichan, Soros, Stiritz, Fidelity, Perry... will show you the hard way on this foolish bet by Ackman.


Ackman went short 20 million shares of common stock in Dec. 2012. Ackman got spooked when HLF stock
was rising again so he eventually converted 40% of his common short to puts that will expire in Jan. 2015.
Ackman is still short 12 million shares of HLF!! ))))))squeeze((((((

Ackman's presentation was a dud just like his prior presentations were duds. Chapman said it best, "Ackman
is the reincarnation of PT Barnum." And even went a bit further on Tuesday with his phony crocodile tears. I
believe it is very true that Ackman will stoop to any level necessary to try to pull this off. Obvously he is failing
miserably.


HLF has been around for 34 years for a reason, they have a winning business plan, quality products, quality
people and incredible management. The fact that Ackman a few others underestimate not only Herbalife, but
network marketing in general is a plus for HLF longs and the reason why Ackman has been getting his tail
whipped so badly, especially last Tuesday.


And I like your comments about Ackman getting spooked after he claimed he would take his POS "to the
ends of the earth" and then repositioned his trade, covering on his short POS, at a huge loss, bought puts
which will expire worthless and have already lost value due to time decay and then on Tuesday said, "P..S.
may cover on this at any time." LOL.


As I see it, M.O.A.S.S and Jeff, don't forget, FTW.

"they have a winning business plan," 
You understand that the 25% - 42% buy their discount ...and in return they merely get the opportunity to sell
to earn it back..ex. the SC purchases 500 Volume Points for above and beyond $500..they now have the
opportunity to earn an additional 10% (pre-existing 25% Discount) for a 35% DSC when sold to a retail
customer outside the network.. The SC also have the ability to earn a whsle commission of 10% GRoss. This
alleged 10% Gross is really a -5% Net when you reconcile the 15% SV's whsle commission.

Jeffjacobjames - statements like those are amoral greedy anti-American. they are everything that is wrong
with society.


the only people driving stock up and down are the day traders and momentum traders profiting from the
noise. i play my game and the fact that you run around mouthing off, and stock goes up/down, doesn't bother
me one bit.


"A fool and their money are soon parted." when i was in college i used to pay bar tabs and cabs playing pool
against fools; i'd let the big mouth drunk run around talking trash about all the balls he was sinking, laughing
and mocking me, sometimes this went on for a long time and it "looked like" i was really losing badly
....eventually the balls on the table wound up in such a way that he would scratch on his last shot (checkmate
for bar pool). i didn't even know that much about pool, i just knew how to separate a fool from his money. they
always had that stupid look on their faces as i picked up their money and walked out. (good luck with HLF :)

I HOPE This goes to $150 in the "MOASS" (as the idiotic long day traders call it). Then I can recharge and
load up my puts because there is ZERO QUESTION Herbalife is a fraud and the Government will shut it
down. The question is: Before Jan '15 or Jan '16? That is the ONLY open Question.

Sadly there are always people looking to take advantage of disadvantaged people. Herbalife not only did this
but sold people diets that had chemicals the FDA forced them to remove and isn't significantly better than
eating a healthy diet. Thus they mined 2 classes that have issues. Those who want to lose weight without too
much effort and those who want to make money without effort and targeted those who were unemployed and
had failed to lose weight.


Rather than building a company based on success, Herbalife depends on continued failure for its success
making it a MLM. If indeed their sales got rich they'd have no sales force willing to sell out their friends and
family just to make a buck (some make relatively little more than that apparently) just like if their clients all lost
weight and got their diet under control they'd have no customers.


The fact this doesn't close is the same reason B of A stays in business after violating every rule in banking.
Regulators are captured by those they regulate and do nothing for a hefty salary from taxpayers. Which in
itself is yet another fraud.

27 Jul 2014, 12:29 AM


ForTheTruth
The real question Jeff is how much longer can Ackman keep this HLF short POS on life support? He has
been taking a killing since he started and lost over $70 million on his puts alone on Tuesday. No wonder he
was crying on tv.


Moreover, Ackman lost all credibility on Tuesday and I even understand that many of his investors are exiting
his P.S. Funds.


His puts have already lost value due to time decay and will expire worthless in January 2015. By then HLF
will be up over $90 easy and Ackman will also be down about $1billion or more on his short POS.


Can you say M.O.A.A.S.S and how about FTW???


Ackman is done stick a fork in him.

To me I don't care of if HLF is a Pyramid scam or not that is for the law to decided. I'm here for the Mother of
all short Squeeze, I believe at the end the company will be fine for certain things but it will not be shut down.
Ackman may be right in his other shorts trade but doesn't mean he will be right on this one. I can't not wait to
see the ending but I think it is coming soon. Let see who will have the last laugh. Long Call Options.

Interesting how they don't crack the top 10 diets in the US. Or the top 10 supplement companies. If not for this
website (and frankly Ackman's crusade) I'd have never even heard of Herbalife. Maybe it's because I'm not a
poor minority, thus I'm not part of their target demographic. Or maybe it's because they identified me as
someone who can do basic math and knew that I wouldn't fall for the gag. Who knows?

ralphbway
Jeff are you presently paid by HLF? If not contact them immediately. Companies like them can always use
more shills.


Included in my investment decisions are the questions about a company being ethical, doing business in a
way that I am comfortable with, how they treat all their employees all the way down the chain.


Obviously by your comments and many others I see on SA making money on companies regardless of how
ethically or not they create profit for you is your only concern. That's sad, but it is the world we live in.


On the bright side when HLF comes down it will be swift. I'd love to hear your comments then.


27 Jul 2014, 01:27 PM


herbs4mike
@Mike.... Is that interesting? I think it's funny that you find that INTERESTING, LOL. And you want to play the
poor race card. Perhaps you think I should try and find people that already have a career like a lawyer or a
surgeon. I'm sure they'd quit their job immediately to join Herbalife or pretty much any other job, right? Every
white guy earning 200K a year will just drop their current employment for ANY other job..... Earth to Mike,
people that don't have a job or have a lower (than they want) paying job are looking for employment
opportunities, not people that already have a career, pension, etc. But we know the Ackmanoholics like to
spin information like that...... Herbalife distributors are trying to find broke minorities.... Whaaaa.... Please...
Next time you get a chance to talk to Bill tell him to do his DD next time on his analyst work and he won't get
his billion caught up and have to buy everybody (according to the NY Times) to try and get his way.

Just because you never heard of it doesn't mean that others haven't. Your comment reminds me of the
Raven's when he posted that just because it wasn't in his neighborhood that was proof that it wasn't
anywhere but the ghettos. We operate in a middle class neighborhood and more and more friends are doing
the same.

Michael Phillips, Contributor
"people that don't have a job or have a lower (than they want) paying job are looking for employment
opportunities"


And instead of a job they are sold a marketing scheme that basically insures that they'll be poor for years to
come. But nobody is targeting them because they're poor and often uneducated, right?


27 Jul 2014, 11:09 PM


retailexecutive
You have it right in my opinion. I would be able to cry on demand if I had screwed up as badly. I have a lot of
respect for this writer but he is better at finding value on long cases than shorts. The company must be found
an illegal enterprise for their short positions to succeed and that is unlikely. I guess it would be bad for me as I
have been using the HLF product successfully for years. I do not profit from a down line and I know many
others like me as well.


I did like the writer's call on AIG and made a lot of money . I may have actually beat him to the party but it was
still a good call. This one sounds emotional and from any review of value the stock is under valued and even
with all the short BS the stock goes up because the product is good and there is a legitimate business
opportunity for many people to make a side supplemental small income. For a very few there is a nice living
to be made. With the product guarantee to make inventory returns it is hard to imagine what damage has
really been done.

Sure Mr.Whitney there is a little truth to Herbalife's BIG LIE. 
Now the truth is this: 
Mr.Gordan Geiko (I mean Ichan) walked into herbalife bought a 17% interest without the company initiating a poison
pill, very odd for a publicly traded company to do this, Netflix had a better strategy. 
So Geiko, I mean Ichan knows exactly what he is doing. He is helping Mr.Ackman the regulators have no choice but
to take drastic action against the company. 
A long time ago Piggly Wiggly: BULLS made money : BEARS made money : PIGS got slaughtered. I cannot believe
that I am seeing this in my lifetime and not reading about it, still the story is the same. 
Soros we also know he is one of the best. 
Shareholder activism RIGHT NOW is in its infancy, the age of transparency must be met, and according to the FTC
explanation on their website about pyramid schemes in the 90's they do not have the resources to fight this beast.
They need the help of everyone especially financial institutions to overcome this BEAST. 
Soros & Ichan (I do not know about stiritz) but they know herbalife is a pyramid scheme they will help their buddy
Ackman. 
I believe Ackman and when the tears in his eyes glistened for a moment, I know personally all too well when you
deceive the hearts and minds of people and take their life away, like herbalife is doing, what he feels. THIS IS NOT A
JOKE. 
I will continue to purchase PUTS on herbalife, who knows maybe one day I will get a chance to thank Ackman for
showing me purpose and relentless focus for the ongoing truth. 
GOD BLESS AMERICA. 
GOD BLESS ACKMAN.

Give me a break. The short squeeze following Ackman's presentation was triggered by these crocodile tears.
Nobody believes this is an ethical battle. Ackman is short for one reason... To make money. I would certainly
lean short here and take a small position myself on a return back to the $80s, but lets put the bad acting
aside. Far greater ethical travesties exist in corporate America than an MLM.

So, Charles Moscoe, are you saying that being a decent person and making money are mutually exclusive
concepts?


And you read investing blogs because, um, you're not trying to make money?


Or, you are, but you're just not a caring person...

I like Alan Hoffman's comments about HLF as he joins the team.


“Herbalife benefits millions of people around the world and I am proud to join the team,” said Hoffman.
“Herbalife has an enormously important mission of improving health and wellness around the globe and I look
forward to ensuring that the public more clearly understands the critical role the company plays in advancing
good nutrition. I also look forward to promoting the economic opportunities that this global nutrition company
provides for hard-working people in communities everywhere.”

“Herbalife benefits a few hundred people on top of the HLF pyramid exploiting millions of people around the

Fixed.

04 Aug 2014, 12:23 PM


Rogier van Vlissingen, Contributor
Indeed. The statistical problem which makes any MLM fraudulent is the misleading expectation that "anyone can
make it," which we also heard in the Ackman presentation on nutrition clubs, when the underlying statistical truth is
that only 0.001% of people might ever make it, which is typically not being disclosed or in such a perfunctory manner
that it is pointless.

This feature was in evidence with the NC training programs that PS documented: they are a hamster wheel that
keeps going only by the fallacious expectation that "if I do everything they say, I'll end up making $100,000 a month
like John Tartol says." Those expectations are being made real from the first $4 Nutrition Club visit, all the way to the
people that lost tens of thousands of dollars before they realized the odds were against them. 
Legally, the hard core deception underlying this is the uniform misrepresentation all MLMs make that offers "unlimited
income potential," on a non-exclusive basis to unlimited prospects. Ergo the chances of succeeding may be high for
the first guys in, but they gradually decline as the program grows. The odds are deteriorating all the time. But the
successful guys are the shills that keep the rest going. Their checks are real, but they are statistically substantiated by
the growing failure rate of the rest. The whole thing is just a fancy version of three card monte.  
I am not sure that any one in the industry, including Pampered Chef, does not make those same misrepresentations.
"Unlimited income potential," is a fraud just as much as the perpetuum mobile is a fraud. The thought of it is endlessly
appealing - free energy, free money, but things don't work out that way. So the problem is not that a few make it and
many don't, the problem is the misrepresentations and fraud that drive the system, and that is what ends up tripping
up companies. Clear regulations will do the rest, see Bruce Craig's letter to the FTC: http://seekingalpha.co...

Actually ''anyone can do it'' is a factual statement but you have to put an ''if'' with it; anyone can do it if they
learn how to do it then go ahead and do it, consistently, over a period of time long enough to achieve
whatever goal they have in the business. Most people join a company, usually do nothing but sometimes
approach a handful of people about it, then give up. Then, for some reason, MLM get's the blame for it.


26 Jul 2014, 08:19 AM


Dampflok
Rogier, in agreement, but I disagree with the statement:"Ergo the chances of succeeding may be high for the
first guys in, but they gradually decline as the program grows." I am convinced that the first guys in are the
actual perpetrators, so the chances for anybody joining are nil. Anybody "making it" later has to be absolutely
ruthless. Remember, the ones that make money on chain letters are the names at the top of the list, which
are those that started it.

ProTruth
I think that there are actually instances of individuals who "make it later" in MLM, but they are: 
-family members of top level distributors (who are "helped"),  
-"players" who are recruited because of their speaking/"motivational" abilities, or may be bringing in existing
downlines from another MLM,  
-individuals who have a troubling combination of hard-sell temperament/lack of principles (I always think of it
as individuals with cult-leader potential, seriously, that is more or less what it boils down to) 
-or other special circumstances


A normally-principled person joining and pursuing the BizOp who is unrelated to the upline, in a market where
that particular MLM tumbleweed has already blown through town....I agree, they have no chance...as
Fitzpatrick said, they are actually the main "customers" of MLM, they just don't realize it.


26 Jul 2014, 11:18 AM

@David... You are EXACTLY right. In fact, you might have stole that from me, LOL, Cause that's exactly what
I told them many moons ago... However, it doesn't fit the shorts agenda so they don't repeat it. Anybody,
(plumber, Trucker, Man, Woman, White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, ETC)... Anybody can be successful in
Herbalife, but Everybody cannot. Just like everybody cannot be an entrepreneur, or sales, or a restaurateur,
or an insurance agent and be successful.


Furthermore, The shorts 99% number is a total, blatant, and out of context bit of conjecture. Everybody knows
that the Herbalife supervisor retention rate is over 50%. 95% of Supervisors are the serious people that want
to make a career out of Herbalife; just as everybody knows that approximately 70-80% of all Herbalife
members start out just for the discount, with a good amount changing their desire down the road. As I have
said many times. There is only about 100k serious distributors worldwide (my estimation of 19 years of
Experience). And there is almost 2000 President team distributorships alone, Over 5000 Mill Team
distributorships (me included) as well. Obviously there are a few presidents team and more than a few mill
team distributorships that haven't panned out in the long run. However, much more than the majority have.
Likewise, there are a few distributors that were serious and never made it to supervisor in the old days
(before the 5000 a year qualification). But now with the 5k qualification, everybody that is serious, "cut out" for
a sales job, and is into health (i.e. not fat, or is in the process of losing weight) qualifies within a year. And
Herbalife is adding to the fold everyday.

spreading across the world at an alarming rate. I have news for you protruth..... Every year 75 million people
turn the age of 21, and statistics say half will be fat, even at age 21...... there is only 100,000 serious

It's hard not to get sucked in, sitting at a STS (success training seminar), the bottom line is that all these
meetings are based on greed, fear of loss, confusing the prospects with no.s, and selling the dream, with
hypnotic music, group think, and lots of caffeinated beverages. Overpriced products, cult leaders. Everything
has been calculated and time tested over 30 yrs. to perfection.. The marketing plan is based on..the prospect
paying for their discount and then selling it.. Within the 25% to 42% stair step ladder, Cherry picked and
skewed at best the sales leaders with a downline earn a max. of $104.00 Annual Compensation according to
HBL.. (I have previously broke down exactly how this occurs).. Once a 25- 42% becomes a Supv. the next
game they play is the "endless chain" I personally believe that it is impossible to break even until the
Millionaire Team, or Presidents Team.. No one has ever disputed this.. I believe this is undisputed.. Breaking
Even is not possible until you reach the President's Team.. Every President Team got there using Tools and or
lead generation, and/or selling their particular "System and trainings".. Some of the most common underlying
standards that are the common denominator to all participants are: Buying Your Discount, the Initial Purchase
leading to a Subsequent Sale wherein the SV's and Sales Leaders each receive 2x the profit or 2(50)=100 -
25 = 75, 2(40)=80 -5 = 75, 2(33)=66 +9 = 75. The Non-SV, or Non-SL, Senior Consultant initially pays out
40% but receives 5% less potential whsle commission of 35%.. Similarly the Qualified Producer, Success
Builder, and/or the Q-ing SV pays out 33% to the SV & SL's but because they paid 9% less than the promised
42% Retail Discount they ultimately end up buying it from the SV who is at 66% and short 9% of 75%. 
On the other-hand if the SV is 80% or 5% above and beyond 75% this 5% difference is paid to the Senior
Consultant who overpaid 5%. (40% was paid to the SV and SL's, as opposed to the 35% promised Retail
profit. Hence the 5% is subtracted from the 80% which offsets the amount and adjusts it automatically to the
standard of 75%..

28 Jul 2014, 02:40 PM

@Ritchie.... Sure..... It's called basic math..... How many people are on the earth, then divide that by the
average life of the average human being on this planet. I think the number I used was 80 years of age. So
6,000,000,000/80=75,00... people of each age. Now we know that there are small fluctuations. However, it is
a good estimate of how many 21 year olds there are on the planet.


Half are fat.... well, I don't have that handy. However, I have only read this about 500 times cause it's my job.
But you can certainly look it up easily.


Next 100,000 serious distributors.... I already told you my source for that information in the original post. And
it is a very good rough estimate. How do I know? I know how many people show up to all the world wide
events. The very serious distributors always make every big event (i.e. extravaganzas). so just get the
attendance of all the world wide extravaganzas last year, and you'll know exactly how many serious
distributors there are, and it's about 100,000.... And even if there were 150,000, this is a drop in the bucket
compared to the growing fat population of the planet... Once again, Herbalife will be around for a very long

Ackman is likely right, but pretending that this is an ethical battle is a strategic mistake IMO.


26 Jul 2014, 07:53 AM


Rogier van Vlissingen, Contributor
Charles Moscoe - it is not an ethical battle, though it certainly is an ethical issue. The hard core truth is that
there are laws against business opportunity fraud which have been enforced in a very helter skelter fashion,
as Bruce Craig pointed out again most recently. Having said that, the massive dumpster loads of evidence
that PS has collected and publicized virtually hand the case to regulators and prosecutors on a silver platter,
and it is becoming harder to think that something is not going to be done about it. Bill Ackman is ahead of
where Harry Markopolos was on Madoff. HM never got the SEC to even start an investigation, and the SEC
might not have had the required talent and abilities to even do so. Since the first Pershing Square
presentation, there have now been six investigations launched in this country, and apparently one in Canada.
Different from Madoff, HLF has not run out of victims yet. The brilliance of their "BOP" (Bottom of the
Pyramid) strategy is that it is easier to ripoff large numbers of people of little bits of money,and victims are
less likely to complain. Bernie needed to make "sales" of millions of $$ at a clip, and got his money from
people who would quickly get antsy if the returns were not there, or withdrawals not being honored. HLF is
selling $4 Nutrition Club visit, powered by a hope and a dream.


26 Jul 2014, 08:26 AM


Equitable Research, Contributor
The entire market is an ethical issue. It is designed to take money from the public and distribute it to insiders.
HLF is no exception. My poimt is that Ackman shedding tears over this is comical. He is crying because he is
losing money. That is all he cares about.


26 Jul 2014, 08:47 AM


Doctor Dividend, Contributor
Couldn't you say the same about the entire Wall Street market being an ethical issue?


A serious question: Do people not complain about Pampered Chef because they are "tangible" items where
you don't necessarily need to purchase monthly? Is the problem with HLF is that since the products are
"consumable" that people will keep coming back monthly?


Maybe the industry of networking marketing is not bad, but some of the network marketers that get into it are
what makes the whole industry leave a sour taste. Reminds me of 2007-2008 when mortgage people were

I think the whole idea of paying "advance retail commissions" in MLM is such obvious fraud.


How about putting an end to that, just for starters?


No payments made to upline until a retail sale actually takes place. Require robust systems to document retail
sales, and when the retail sale takes place at less than SRP than the upline rewards are proportionally
reduced as well.


That would throw some bracing cold water on the upline party.

You accomplish the very same thing with a return policy that includes commission clawbacks.


26 Jul 2014, 11:40 AM


ProTruth
The return policy is a weak argument, has many loopholes. We have already covered this.


Opened product is not returnable. Supervisors have many many tricks up their sleeves to get that product
opened. The Ackman presentation highlighted more than one. I thought one mentioned quickly at the end
was interesting, it was a new one to me:


The recruits all are "trained" to have pill "shakers"...plastic trays with compartments for the pills. They are told
to open all their HLF pill bottles (at $25 a bottle, I think she said?) and empty them into the compartments.
Voila, another way to make product non-returnable.


I believe they shake their pill shakers at rallies...it's an HLF "thing".


Obey obey obey your coaches and the upline, do as you are told. Do not question our proven success
method. Do I have to say the C-word again?

easy. Obey obey obey, you are going to make President's Team, "the only way to lose is to quit".


26 Jul 2014, 12:01 PM


ProTruth
Further, your return policy argument doesn't address the problem of retail sales occurring below SRP, up to
and including product being given away or thrown away. The way it works now, upline still gets rewards as if
product were sold at full 100% SRP, even if the product is sold at 65%SRP, 35% SRP, given away, or
whatever.


"Advance retail commissions" is endlessly rationalized by MLM/the DSA, but if you deconstruct it, it's really
not even very hard, the emperor has no clothes, it's the basis for a money transfer scheme. Money goes to
the top no matter what is happening in reality to product. Perfect cover. Advance Retail Commissions,
rationalized endlessly, by whatever means necessary, because they need that cover for the money siphoning.


If MLMs really are legit, they should have no problem switching over to a system where rewards are only give
after retail sales occur, and are proportional to the actual retail profit, not the fantasy SRP. MLMs should have
absolutely no problem with this if they are what they say they are.

Sounds like Protruth is a little envious..... Let me get out the salt..... Protruth last month I made the most
money in this distributorship since I started in it. My royalties and bonus alone, not counting retail sales were
over 10k. Yes, this is my claim and I am more than willing to back this up with documentation. I told you last
year I would be at the 5 digit mark soon.... Here I am, July 2014 pay for the first time just eclipsing the 5 digit
mark. I love Herbalife!! Just to let you know. This money is totally indicative of how many people I've directly
or indirectly helped last month(s). If no sales are made, if there is no demand for our products (by fat people
getting results), then I make nothing, ZERO..... Helping people is the key. No matter what, an Herbalife
distributor must look after the new people's best interest in every facet, no matter what level they are to the
advanced distributor. Then once people figure out that the distributor (I'm) truly looking out for and want to
help them, the team effect starts to take place, leveraging time, energy, etc. Thus the new distributor starts to
get enhanced results.

Would love to see a breakdown of your own retail sales and royalties from downline. Also how you use

@Rick.... Herbalife lacks transparency because it's not their club. It has nothing to do with Herbalife
intentionally hiding anything.... Everybody tends to forget that I, an Independently contracted distributor by
Herbalife, DO NOT work for Herbalife, nor do I want to. I work for MYSELF. Herbalife has no business putting
it's nose into my business. They are only my wholesaler and accountant, and that's all. My retail sales, I
usually have about 15 to 20 retail sales a month. I just opened a new club so that will go up until I let my
downline (who will be developed up from one of the customers of the new club) take over the club and inherit
the club retail customer base as well.

28 Jul 2014, 03:05 PM


herbs4mike
Thanks truth..... I do work and want people to get good results. But you know what I learned a few weeks ago.
Ken Reel published an article that talked about that Herbalife was a legal MLM but just by a fraction
(according to the VanderNat paper). And he "rode" Herbalife for that. And it's true that Advanced Retail
Commissions are just barely covered making it legal by just enough. My point is this. If Herbalife paid us
distributors less, then Herbalife wouldn't be on the border of legal. Which leads me to state that Herbalife
pays it's distributors the MAXIMUM allowed "by law" (VanderNat Paper). Isn't that great! Instead of a
company keeping the cash, it hands it out to it's workhorses. I love working with a company that pays us the
maximum, which is just the opposite of the norm. Most companies pay people just enough to keep them
there, even sports players are in that boat. But Herbalife pays it's independent distributors the maximum. And
people wonder why it's distributors are so loyal..... Products that have helped people lose weight and pay is
the max. I can't ask for more... I love Herbalife

That product claim is ridiculous, Amway does around $12 billion in sales and has some of the best selling
products in their categories in the world. They're #1 in nutritional supplements, #1 in home water treatment
systems, top 5 in premium skincare, top 10 in premiums cosmetics.


Same with your % reaching "the top". It's like complaining that there's only 100 people in the top 100! A
circular argument.


26 Jul 2014, 08:27 AM

Ridiculous or not those are the numbers Amway used to post on Amway's own site.Like all MLMs name of the
game is hold meetings, paint happy pictures of becoming Bill gates inside 60 days, separate flock from their
$200 starter kits, rinse and repeat. 90% of them will never make any money at it and thats not an opinion.
People are always any MLMs product.


There is nothing you can buy from any MLM you can't buy somewhere else for 1/2 the price, same quality
expect unlike the MLM's the competitors don't have to mark their products up so much to pay out these huge
commissions MLMs do.


Example. Living Life essential oils, real good stuff. I can buy the same oil same quality for 1/2 living life price
from a competitor who doesn't have to mark up product so much to pay out all those MLMers up and down
the chain before the product reaches me (like living life has to). Thats not an opinion either. Its not
complicated. Anybody can research it.

One of the biggest points raised by those who don't know how Herbalife operates is "how has it been in business for
30+ years?"


This is a great way to point out the staying power of these schemes. And it looks like Johnson is going to push this
POS until the wheels fall off. This company's engine is based on recuitment - FAR more so than 50/50 - more like
85/15 if you ask me.


False income claims, false medical claims, lead generation, aggressive accounting, insiders cashing out, Chinese and
U.S. scrutiny, nutrition clubs FAKING their retail sales, forced consumption, ridiculous "University" programs,
purchased legitimacy.

Yep, it will be Ackman crying his eyes out with more theatrics. Because he is about to lose his options worth
about 400 million in January. If he rolls them over it will certainly cost a whole lot of cash. But at home he'll be
crying himself to sleep asking himself why he didn't have Shane's faulty work double checked by a competent
authority in the MLM industry. Why he didn't just tell the truth about him not having Shane's faulty work double
checked correctly and just eat the small 250 million dollar lose (at the time) swallowing some pride? Watching
his options disappear in January is going to be a great sight to see. If he rolls them over, I wonder who will
charge him how much money for those options, since it will be private..... Maybe that's why he is trying to
buddy buddy up to Icahn..... Icahn's not dumb, I wonder what kind of premium he will charge, ouch

In investing you can be right as rain and still get taken to the cleaners if your analysis takes too long to play
out--the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. In fact to the extent you are relying on
timing, you are not an investor at all (reference Graham/Buffet/Munger on that one). Ackman may be right, but
I doubt this will ever work out for him.

Mr. Tilson- going by the timing of different pronouncements you have made about being short HLF, I believe you have
taken a beating so far. Right now it looks like you're down six and have the ball on your own 40 yard line. There is
time for one more play and you can toss a hail mary into the end zone. You convert and you're the hero. But instead
of divine intervention you need regulatory intervention. If the regulators don't rule in your favor then this week's
upward stock price movement for HLF will look tame compared to what you'll see in the future. A clean bill of health
will easily lift this stock to $90 immediately and well beyond over time. With all of the overvalued stocks out there at
this time, why would you want to take that risk and make that bet?

Those expecting the FTC to take action are only trying to stretch out this short play. No civil minded individual

HLF is & has been proven to be a fraudulent business.


It SHOULD be shut down or at the very least have severe restrictions put on them regarding the lies that
continue to be told without consequence.


Years from now, History will show Ackman was a hero for taking on this sham business that defrauds so
many.


I have no position. I just know fraud when i see it.

Why do you write so much about a stock you only have a 1% position in? Are you still long CALL? That was suppose
to be a 6 bagger. What about SODA? You stated those were much bigger positions than your shorts so why do you
wrote so much less about those? I haven't heard anything about CALL in months after it has gone from 13 to 25 and
back to 14. It appears your allocation of time is not consistent with your position sizing. Or maybe you feel obligated to
spread ackmans propaganda.

Or maybe there's a greater personal interest on HLF.


SODA (even with the recent buyout news) isn't anywhere near as intriguing as a a publicly traded company
accused of operating a pyramid scheme.

Comparing Madoff and Johnson is foolish. Madoff stole money and never invested it but used new people's money to
pay old people. HLF on the other hand actually sells products 4.8B on their income statement and makes 500m in net
income and has 500m free cash flow. Their financial statements are audited by a real CPA firm. To call HFL a fraud
you must prove the above figures false. Ackman can not do that as they are real. HLF is a legally proper firm that
makes real profits. Now how they do that is morally wrong but not illegal. I do not like MLMs but they are legal today.
Not long or short.

See if you can follow this logic, Chuck.


1. Pyramid schemes are a form of fraud.


2. The definition of a pyramid scheme is a company whose primary source of revenue comes from
recruitment (i.e. 51% vs. 49%).

3. A vast majority of Herbalife's revenue comes from recruitment (probably something more like 80% vs.
20%); whether its from recruits paying on a shake-by-shake basis to become nutrition club owners, or from
people just coerced into thinking they can make money off the opportunity.


4. Ipso facto, I've arrived at the term "fraud".

Plus, the "comparison" descriptor could apply to anyone in the financial industry. So, does this describe
Madoff, Johnson, or ACKMAN?:


The parallels are striking: both of them operate/operated in loosely regulated industries with lots of gray
areas; both were charismatic, smooth, polished - and exceptional liars; both were very clever in building and
maintaining a veneer of legitimacy; both cleverly parried the occasional inquiry from regulators and the media;
and both attracted the attention of dogged whistleblowers.


26 Jul 2014, 11:31 AM


Equitable Research, Contributor
That is still not a fraud. You may not agree with MLM as a business model but it prints money. As long as it is
legal (which it is!), its not a fraud. Notice that Tilson does not call it a fraud because he would likely be sued
(successfully). I get how you post anonymously and can say anything you want without fear of reprecussions.


26 Jul 2014, 12:27 PM


Edge Investing, Contributor
Anyone who thinks that HLF will sue Ackman, Tilson, QTR, SA, my grandmother, or anyone else is
delusional. One could say pretty much anything you want about the company, and they will not sue because
they would have to give their internal records over to the defendant. Ackman calls it a pyramid scheme, which
is 100% ILLEGAL and FRAUD. If HLF sued Ackman, they would have to prove they are not a pyramid
scheme, and Ackman would be able to look at their books so he could defend himself. HLF will NEVER sue
anyone about this matter..never.

Apparently HLF doesn't have to sue.. because Allergan is suing. They can spend their time and money. All
the public will know is Ackman and Co. being sued by 'botox' company for insider trading.


03 Aug 2014, 11:59 AM

Sequence could go something like this: Allergan sues Ackman, HLF cleared by FTC, Ackman's short bet is
blown up, FTC sues Ackman. It'd be a bad quarter for Pershing Square, eh?


03 Aug 2014, 12:06 PM


Hell on Deals
I can't imagine new investigations by the iRS, the US Treasury, the NLRB and the FTC adding a new line of
inquiry to their open investigation is going to help HLF. And the allegations by Allergan are laughable, and
"asked and answered" - one of Allergan's own attorneys early on made some comment that the
Pershing/Valeant deal was unusual but apparently permissible. I would love for HLF to sue, but I'm sure Icahn
is telling them "Not so fast, you know, my friend Bill has been right about a lot of things before."


I think the fact that HLF claims Ackman's actions are so defamatory but hasn't sued yet is very telling. And I
own NO HLF stock but will make a prediction that HLF will go down the tubes eventually. I don't know if it will
be soon enough for Pershing though. The last company I took apart ultimately had to file for bankruptcy a
year and a half after I started making disclosures about them. In the end, that company lost all their investors,
got sued by the NY AG, and folded (it was an international company too, and its a shame that due to a non-
disclosure agreement with the party I worked for, I can't tell you which one it was).

Deja Vu, Contributor
This is not Ackman Vs. Herbalife. This is Ackman vs. the political/regulatory influence of the entire MLM industry.


Pinning down Herbalife reminds me of the king who put a large tax on sale of land. So his own minister who wants to
sell land, gives the land away for free. The catch is that to get the land, you have to buy a coconut for a thousand gold
coins.


Trying to regulate Herbalife out of existence, I've come to realize, is like building a wall. Build a wall ten feet high and
ten miles in circumference at enormous cost, and they will bring a eleven foot ladder that will cost them ten bucks
more.


Also, to win, Ackman has to try to manipulate obdurate "Bartleby, The Scrivener" type dimwit regulators, whose gaze
is fixed firmly on the revolving door. That regulatory slavering you see, is not of a German Shepard police dog, but
more of a Labrador drooling for a dog biscuit.

If only the regulators were so benign and would simply prefer not to.


Look at what Obama just did to Corinthian Colleges. Basically just shut them down. of course, the put
themselves in a position for that by relying on the Department of Education for revenue.


Fortunately, even little pinheaded regulators in Washington can't put HLF out of business, even if its business
in the US is shut down, because tehy only get a small percentage of their revenue from the US.

Kudos to the author and QTR.


If Herbalife represents the best the MLM industry has to offer, as many HLF proponents proclaim, it points to a
fundamental truth to which many MLM critics have long held: MLM v illegal pyramid scheme is a legal distinction
without a practical difference.


26 Jul 2014, 09:36 AM

Ackman has laid out a clear cut case as to how a majority of this company's revenues come from recruitment,
versus retail. The onus is now on Herbalife to prove they have retail sales - they can't do it, or they would

illegal and then found out he was fired cause he was wrong AFTER his boss bet a billion dollars on his faulty

knew before Ackman bought the senator (according to the NY Times). However, over a year later, the FTC
was forced to get into the mix after the Senator's inquiry. So enjoy your wait. Herbalife is going to do nothing
for you. I'm going to enjoy Ackman's options expire.

a downline; I have no problem with a company recruiting people to sell its products to their family and friends and
making a commission on it (like Pampered Chef) - it's anything related to the "business opportunity" where most of
the abuses occur)---Whitney Tilson


What are you talking about . Pampered chef is also MLM with a party plan.From the Pampered Chef website:


""Roll in the dough! 
Make as much as you “knead.”


Make yourself a little extra cash or start a new career, cook up what you need as fast as you need it. It’s all up to you.

Something the author, QTR and other shorts haven't mentioned is Pampered Chef MLM is owned by Warren
Buffett! He actually owns three MLMs. Interesting that Ackman hasn't attacked the Oracle of Omaha for that.

first things first: i am hlf long (bought before stock split, hope i will hold forever or sell to some crazy optimist), i am
distributor, supervisor. 
first things first: i lost 40+ kilos. 
http://bit.ly/KplraG


i became a distributor few years ago. 
and, i lost a friend. my first distributor was my friend. was. he was so eager to earn money selling me herbalife
products... so i canceled my first code. but, i did not cancel my love for herbalife :) i 'downgraded' myself from
distributor to end customer :) beacuse i was sick of him. 
later, i personaly picked my new upline (my first upline found me, but i found my second upline myself), and signed
my second and current licence.


i was sure i will never sign another member or distributor. 
i signed just to have a better price. 
so, i bought 500+ volume points, and get 35 percent discount. 
(as i said, i am supervisor now, it means i have 50 percent off.)


ackman was one of my motives to make an experiment. 
i just had to see how it works. i just had to see, to try myself. 
i posted some pictures on facebook. 
and, show is going and going on...


corporate banker, web editor, attorney, investment banker, web designer, business owner, pharmacist (quit), teacher
(quit), another teacher and her dother, my sister, mom (quit) and brother in law (quit) became my end customers. they
did not join herbalife.


pharmacist (quit), his colleague (quit first week), journalist (quit), historian, economist, sports agent, it executive,
business owner, retiree and lector signed with herbalife.


combined, they lost 150+ kilos, my next goal is 1000 burned kilos. a tone.


not a single one of them wanted or wants to earn money with herbalife. 
not a single one. 
some of them were consumers (members), most of them are just happy consumers. are. hope will be forever :) as i
am :)


i think i will recruit 100, maybe even 1000 members in my life. 
and, i bet 99 percent of them will be just members, end customers with code.


how much do i earn? 
ok, i'll tell you, cca usd 150 per month. 
pretty good for man who does not want to earn by selling herbalife :)


do not underestimate power of the people like me, who doesn't want to make money with herbalife, but who lost 20-
30-40 kilos and do not add up :) 
i will promote herbalife all my life, because herbalife helped me.

No doubt that Herbalife makes great products. You can't drive sales growth like they do without them. I think
that is what caught Ackman in his short and has forced him to try to play the ethics card. I think that he
underestimated how effective the weight loss products are. I still think that HLF goes higher before the
inevitable collapse. By then all shorts will be squeezed out. I think Ackman will win this and agree with Tilson
but still find the entire premise of Ackman's presentation to be so ironic. I tailed Ackman on GGP and made
out like a bandit and will likely tail here again but I think it is still too early to get short.

of many articles written that slammed Ackman. So what grounds, please inform us. Maybe Ackman will take
acting lessons so he can try and cry the FTC into finding something.


Like I said earlier, even if the FTC finds something small (like some distributors are out of hand).... Herbalife
would probably settle behind closed doors and the shorts would get creamed on the opening. Because it just
plain math, and VanderNat at the FTC know this math cause it's his formula. And using his formula, Herbalife
is certainly in the clear. Furthermore, after the BL case, end users can be members...... Put a fork in Ackman,
he's done. So please tell me how you think Ackman can convince the FTC to try to take Herbalife to court in a
full blown trial.

I think this article has the potential to impact the market negatively for HLF. Surely that is Tilson's intent; to use his
fame and high visibility in talking his book to hopefully start the wheels turning that eventually bring this puppy down.


Maybe writing articles on HLF will get a couple TV hosts to ask you about it on their shows and get the story out
exponentially. Smart guy and probably right on this stock but it strikes me as somewhat shameless that so many of
Tilson's SA articles simply talk his short book. Short positions get you nervous, Whit?

anyway).

It just amuses me that Tilson has a far greater propensity to pen an article on one of his short positions rather
than a long. It's called fear. In an idyllic world he would just write up his best idea and 'share' it with a bunch of

movement though you'd never know it, holding price flat when it would otherwise rise. It's also possible that
information in this article could spur people to do due diligence and sell the stock at a future date when their
DD is complete.


All liquid stocks are buoyed or cratered based on information and a negative article does count as a source of
information. Strange I should have to point this out.


Beyond that, people, including hedge fund managers, are not entirely rational or ego-free. What I mean is that
Tilson may believe he could crater the stock by exposing his 'truths' even if he can't. I'm questioning his
motive, not his efficacy.

"Now how they do that is morally wrong but not illegal. I do not like MLMs but they are legal today."


This seems to be the prevailing sentiment of the market. The market agrees that the nutrition clubs are unscrupulous
fronts used to generate profit. They just don't agree that there is anything illegal about it and if that is the case the
company is undervalued.


This seems to be shortsighted. First, the business operates as a pyramid (not just an MLM). Because of this those
profits will be short lived and soon enough the bottom is going to drop out. It won't take regulatory action for this to
happen. It's the nature of how pyramid schemes work. Whether you agree that it is legal or not makes no difference.


As for the question of legality. I find it hard to imagine that you could watch the 3.5 hour Ackerman presentation and
not think this is illegal. Regulator action or inaction does not answer the question.


I could speed down the Interstate at 85mph right past an officer. If they choose to not pull me over this doesn't make
my actions any more legal. In Herbalife's case they looked past 85mpg long ago. We can argue at what speed they
are going, but there is no doubt in my mind they are speeding, and excessively at that.

it's legal. Investing based on fallacies is dangerous territory.

Ninja,


Not only is HLFs bottom not falling out, they have only scratched the surface. HLF has a market potential of 5
billion people. With 3 out of 5 people obese, that is a huge market. Then figure in the targeted health
products, the skin care, the sports line and of course the business opportunity and all of the countries and
continents that HLF is not in yet plus new products.


The opportunity for HLF is unlimited. Just like the risk in losing money when you are short is also
UNLIMITED!

groups apparently see those affected by HLF as their constituents. This is apparently because theyeach perceive
them as above the poverty level, not ordinary consumer, and in a sense, "investors". The economic status of those
affected by MLM schemes need to be fully documented in a university sociological study. This is where Mr. Ackman

I watched the presentation and the only thing I saw was a proud American detailing how that history and
legacy of our country should not be sullied by businesses like HLF which prey on the unsuspecting. We're
supposed to be a country of opportunity, not opportunism.


In general, regardless of what's in it for them, I give people trying to stop the exploitation of others the benefit
of the doubt. He was displaying he fact that he's a caring person. What you say, billionaires don't have
feelings? He could, like many, just go all Gordon Gekko and only go after the money, and you think him a fool
because he chooses to combine making money with ameliorating some evils? In summary, Bill Ackman -
unlike many - had the guts to put his money where his mouth was. When was the last time YOU staked a
billion dollars on something you believed in? And yes, its his investors money, but he is beholden to them on
performance for it.


Full disclosure: The only thing I'm long on is my country. I served proudly, my son serves, I put my money in

Fact is that most aggressive MLMs eventually collapse on their own. The whole "ethics" and fraud talk is nonsense
however. Shorting HLF is like jumping in front of a speeding train right now. Everything about the company is firing on
all cylindars and the valuation is cheap. It will be a short one day no doubt. But for every horror story there are 100s of
Herbalife diehards. This stock can double before Anybody would question the valuation so what we have here is this
last ditch nonsense ethics argument from Ackman. It is embarassing and While I believe Ackman is a genius and I
read everything he writes (along with everything Tilson writes), he should have cut his losses awhile ago.

Wasn't Ackman convinced that he was right about a JCP turnaround in his 2012 presentation (which included a slide
that shows the stock price potentially rising as high as $315)? It was about a year later when he threw his investment
into the garbage as if it was a dowdy shirt purchased from a JCP clearance rack.

Perhaps it is better to rely on Expert Analysts such as Ex FTC Advisors like Walter Vandaele. Which brings us

test, and got his definition of End user rejected by the Ninth circuit Court ? Matt Stewart ? QTR ? The List

^As long as Mr. Tilson is comfortable with his due diligence, which has a strong basis from a fundamental level, then
there is no reason to succumb to current market sentiment. Not only is the business model of multi-tiered recruiting
illegal, but it is unsustainable as the market size cannot increase much further.


That being said, the classic saying by John Maynard Keynes may prove correct in this scenario. "Markets can remain
irrational longer than you can remain solvent". From a high-level view, HLF's P/E and operating performance may
sway investor sentiment to a bullish momentum swing. For now, I remain a cautious yet interested spectator.

Who are the "adults" in this scenario?


27 Jul 2014, 10:44 AM


burbankbob
I think the author has identified one of the key questions and deserves credit for attempting an answer. The problem is
that the longevity of Herbalife comes very close to being a dispositive fact in any case against it. The principal
characteristic (and danger) of true pyramid scheme (like their Ponzi scheme cousins) is that they collapse, leaving
late-comers holding the bag. Herbalife has been in business for 30 years with no collapse. Ergo, not a pyramid
scheme. It's not quite that simple, but close. Absent that danger of collapse, all you're arguing about is whether
Herbalife has committed some kind of fraud by not being clear enough about how low the chances are of success.


With respect to the substance of the argument, (1) I don't find the business model or the compensation structure all
that complex, certainly no more so than any other MLM or a franchise system; (2) the "veneer of legitimacy" is
actually legitimacy (HLF shares some characteristics of a pyramid scheme but not all, and it has adopted policies to
keep it on the right side of the law); (3) I don't see the evidence that its leadership is particularly smart, or at least
smarter than the average corporate leadership. In other words, HLF has kept the game going because it is not
actually a pyramid scheme.


26 Jul 2014, 03:48 PM


Hell on Deals
RE: "(2) the "veneer of legitimacy" is actually legitimacy (HLF shares some characteristics of a pyramid
scheme but not all, and it has adopted policies to keep it on the right side of the law);.."


burbankbob - More like the "veneer" of policy. HLF has this disingenuous tendency to claim they have
enacted policies to remedy any number of ills the company has been accused of, but then continues to hide
behind the excuse - when examples of the behaviour still occurring are pointed out - that their distributors are
"independent contractors" and thus not subject to their oversight. Word to HLF, you can't have it both ways.


I started my career 25 years ago as a narcotics cop, and worked major frauds for a while, too. One of the
seminal truths of police work is that many criminals get away with stuff because they believe their own lies so
much, they get other people to believe them too. I have no doubt that some day HLF will be exposed for the
criminal enterprise it is, my only question is, will that be soon enough for Ackman and the other courageous
shorts? Those who - even if motivated by money - did a tremendous service by helping to expose this fraud.


You can defend HLF all you want. You can believe in the product, or not. (Note, its not impossible to commit
fraud even with a good product). But for most thinking people, its hard to get past the fact that:


HLF refuses to release good financials - even the most competitive companies out there (think Coke v. Pepsi)
divulge revenues and other relevant financial detail

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2345145-how-has-herbalife-kept-the-game-going-for-so-long 54/85


HLF has never conclusively rebutted the pyramid scheme question because they have refused to release
comprehensive data on revenues. This is an obfuscation that at least one government agency ought to stop
with a subpoena.


HLF runs a business plan based solely on exploiting those less inclined to understand their business model.
Most businesses want SMART employees, duh! Not HLF, apparently, or at least, not the bulk of them, only
the 1 percenters at the top. For the rest, they want folks gullible enough to invest thousands without
understanding a contract thats as duplicitous as it is outrageous.


HLF's own (forced, and small print) disclosures admit that most of their promotional pitches are lies - that few
ever attain the 100s of thousands they promise. I'm not saying other companies don't lie, but few do it on so
many levels - to the press (repeatedly they have denied knowing they were under investigation only to have it
revealed there was no way they could not have known), to the government (we're not a pyramid scheme but
we won't show you all our numbers), to consumers and investors (via, among others things, financials that
had to be re-stated) , to potential recruits and to their own distributors (make a $100,000 a month!!!)


HLF's solution to difficult questions is not to answer them, but to attack those asking. For example, they whine
about Bill Ackman lobbying and engaging with regulators, while they themselves outspent Ackman on
lobbying expenditures and hired a former aide to the Vice President to run interference with regulators.


I left police work and, at various times worked for various government agencies. If at any time my boss had
told me that the higher ups (including the President - I was a policy advisor) wanted an answer on an issue
and I refused to answer and instead questioned why they (he) wanted to know, you can bet I would have
come to a quick end.


Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and HLF deserves a quick end.

What if all the negative things about the herbalife business opportunity are well known, but people ultimately
choose to participate regardless?


It is not that far fetched.


A substantial portion of the population knowingly use a product that slowly kills them (Tobacco). A substantial
percent freely choose to travel great distances to play games that they know are rigged (casinos). People
willingly play state lotto's even though the vig is often as much as 40%.


The shorts are on a cruisade to help the poor? Great.


I dare them to do an analysis of state lotteries - they are not called a tax on poor people for no reason.


Here is a story: When I was in school I worked briefly at a convenience store. I felt bad for a number of the
poor, hard luck people who I felt were ruining themselves financially with lottery tickets. I spoke up and did my
best to explain how bad the odds were, and why they should not play. You know what? They don't give a
damn. Don't want your "two cents" or mathematical explanation of the odds. Basically look at you with a look
that says, "F off" or "who cares" and then ask to buy 40 more tickets.

Bottom line: What if the people negatively impacted by the severely low odds MLM/HLF business opportunity
still want the freedom to participate and make their own decisions - you know, like real grown ups?


Regardless, the HLf product is documented to work for it's primary purpose - weight loss and weight
management. Quite frankly, given the massive obesity crisis in the low income population, I would not be
surprised if this real product benefit vastly dwarfs the harm created by the low odds mlm opportunity.

"HLF refuses to release good financials - even the most competitive companies out there (think Coke v.
Pepsi) divulge revenues and other relevant financial detail"


You;ve got to be kidding, right?

I've studied their financials, on and off, for five months now, and it know Coke's - my family sold Taylor Wine
to them (Coke) in 1985, thus I know of what I speak. The key word in my comment was "good".. You go and
study five years of their financials for five months, and get back to me. Oh, and I assume you are a fraud
investigator..

@briian865


No, are you that dense? I said HLF was a fraud, and its financials are a lot less transparent than those of
many other companies. HLF has said in the past that they shield certain numbers because they are
"proprietary" (or some such nonsense) and I pointed out, just using one illustration (KO v. PEP), that plenty of
companies that are fierce market competitors still release the kind of data they withhold. If you are so brilliant,
call up the company and ask them for some financial detail in areas like currency conversion or distributor
compensation, and see what kind of answers you get. Ask them why they use transfer pricing to allocate
foreign expenses and other non-GAAP accounting devices. Ask them why they champion their "American
dream" but when they get asked the uncomfortable questions, they fall back on "we're incorporated in the
Caymans." I find it pretty telling when even a US Senator (Ed Markey) can't get answers to his questions.

I'd just like to know how/why two of the Big 4 accounting firms both gave HLF clean audits in the post-
Sarbanes-Oxley world. Just answer that question. Did the audit teams, staffed with experienced partners and
top-grade staff accountants, not see what this lady sees? Or, are they just all "in on it"?


When you peel back the rhetoric of these people, common sense is just staring you right in the face. It's like
QTR publishing the dallyings of that Canadian guy concerning the accounting around HLF's return policy. I
mean, really? KPMG and PwC both just missed that? Or are we to believe neither KPMG or PwC ever dealt
with a return policy before? It's just silliness.

Have you ever audited anything? I have, and its possible. (In fact its why i get asked to review filings). To take
the one already cited a million times, Enron got away with it for 7 years. Fastow, Skilling, et al started their
accounting shenanigans in 1993, and didn't start to get caught until 2001. Does anyone even still remember
how Fortune magazine rated Enron the "most innovative" company in the US from 1996-2001? Or, how high
its stock price went???


From one explanation of the fraud: "As was later discovered, many of Enron's recorded assets and profits
were inflated or even wholly fraudulent and nonexistent. One example of fraudulent records was during 1999
when Enron promised to repay Merrill Lynch & Co.'s investment with interest in order to show profit on its
books. Debts and losses were put into entities formed "offshore" that were not included in the company's
financial statements, and other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related
companies were used to eliminate unprofitable entities from the company's books."


(Note, "Other sophisticated and arcane" financial transactions"...It's worth noted one person I consulted about
my volume points theory called it "arcane.")

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2345145-how-has-herbalife-kept-the-game-going-for-so-long 57/85


All those years, and through all those tricks, ENron's auditors never questioned it. And as anyone in law
enforcement can tell you, once an enforcement action or law is improved, someone figures out a way to
circumvent it. Its unfortunate, but true that since Sarbanes Oxley the number of companies caught committing
balance sheet fraud has not dropped to zero. Many have, in fact, just gotten smarter at it.


I could be wrong, but its my contention, based on available facts and months of analysis that HLF exploits a
number of accounting devices to inflate revenues. Thus my questions. The company is free to answer those
questions with actual, precise, and detailed evidence and not marketing lingo. Should they choose not to, I
am asking the SEC, the US Treasury and others to help them do it.


Because its my contention, since no one ever asked what a volume point is/was worth, and my analysis
shows its never worth the SAME value, AND HLF has not explained how transactions like distributor
compensation and product purchases get "converted" back into cash for the balance sheet, that volume
points can be used to enable fraud and inflate the balance sheet. Until I am told otherwise, I have to assume
that 'volume points" are worth whatever the company wants them to be, WHEREVER the company wants to
to be, and its not impossible for them to be worth different things in those places.


Its also not clear to me, and probably no one else, how the company handles foreign transactions initially
conducted in "volume points" and then put through potentially two conversions, once to a foreign currency,
and then to US dollars Given the difficulties they have in some foreign countries,that should be of some
interest.


You have to remember, there are accountants (auditors) and then there are forensic accountants. Most
companies do not voluntarily audit themselves using forensic accountants. Many ordinary accountants are not
trained to discover extraordinary and unusual elements of fraud. They just make sure the numbers "hit."

Back to Enron. Any examples post-SOX? Do you even know what SOX is? Do you have any idea what a
post-SOX audit looks like for a company of this size? Do you think both KPMG and PwC "just make sure the
numbers hit"? Your arguments demonstrate a considerable lack of understanding of a lot of things.

those places."


No need to assume as HLF has already confirmed you are correct in their SEC filings with their qualified
statements.


The specific number of Volume Points assigned to a product, and GENERALLY consistent across all markets,
is based on a Volume Point to suggested retail price ratio for similar products. If a product is available in
different quantities, the various sizes will have different Volume Point values. IN GENERAL, once assigned, a
Volume Point value is consistent in each region and country and does not change from year to year. The
reason Volume Points are used in the manner described above is that we use Volume Points for Member
qualification and recognition purposes and therefore we ATTEMPT to keep Volume Points for a similar or like
product consistent on a global basis.

One of the reasons Herbalife is not easy to understand is because it's not a single pyramid scheme. In much the
same way that Salesforce.com is a platform to create a customized business app, Herbalife is a platform to create a
pyramid scheme on top of. The foundation is there, but the details are left to the implementer.


From Ackman's presentation, "Best of the Best" may have crossed that line though, with Corporate promoting a
specific scam.


26 Jul 2014, 04:53 PM


rick80112
It seems that one strength of the MLM structure is that you have distributors who come up with new methods
of selling like the nutrition club in Mexico. The best (worst?) practices can then be adopted and adapted in
other markets. Another reason why HLF can survive and prosper for as long as it has.

The problem with Smart investors like Quoth the Raven and others that agree with Ackmans thesis, is their inhabilty
to put themselves in the shoes of the poor people they assure Herbalife is taking advantage of. This Smart investors
have Little or no clue into what kind of employment and productivity rates are happening in this third world countries.


Just to start giving you guys an idea, in Mexico, were I personally live, more than half of the population is poor. If an
averege person with no bachelors degree at least, is lucky to have a job, they need to work ten to twelve hours a day
do get paid 3 to 4 thousand pesos a month, thats about 300 dollars a month.


Operating a nutrition club can eaesely make them earn the same amount working 4 to 5 hours a day. What if they
work ten hours a day? Maybe for Bill Ackman and his follower brilliant investors, 400 dollars a month is almost
nothing, but for 80 percent of the worlds population that can be life changing.


Herbalife is giving the world a plan for better health and a plan for extra income, based on personal desire to better
oneself in those áreas. That has to be one of the most empowering alternatives that are being offered to human kind
to better themselves in the world today.


Using poor people as an excuse to attack a movement that was design to empower not only them, but anybody
regardless of social status, is not only irresponable, but also aberrative and suppresive.


Beware Smart investors of who you follow, history is full with sad stories of pseudo leaders that ended up causing
more harm than good to the world.

Many months ago, I believe Mr. Raven indirectly asked to join Ackman's team. I think one of the reasons he has been
so busying writing articles against HLF was to somehow make a name for himself and hopefully to get a job at a big
hedge fund, thereby going from the bottom of the pyramid to the top with his keyboard.


I don't think Ackman has any more bullets in his gun to shoot down HLF. Any future presentations will lack the wow
factor now. That is a good thing because there will be less noise and the FTC can do their thing without any
distraction. (i.e. Ackman telling Price Water House how to do accounting....kind of like a plumber telling a surgeon
how to take out an appendix).


On the topic of HLF, a significant piece of information was the study carried out by Walter Vandaele. He had access to
HLF's data base, he participated in the design and analysis of the study. Keep in mind, he was an advisor to the FTC.
His expertise is in the area of business, finance commerce and statistics. He lives and breathes this stuff.  
In the HLF debate, if you strip away all the noise, emotions etc, it all boils down to the Lieberman/Nielsen and now
Walter Vandaele's analysis of HLF. In my mind, they are all the information you need to come to a logical conclusion. 
The problem is when you are bombarded with so many articles and headlines, the average person on the street or an
investor first looking into HLF will automatically assume HLF is an illegal pyramid....that is the path of least resistance
in coming up with an opinion on HLF. 
Again, I think it is a good thing that the FTC is looking into HLF to clarify once and for all this HLF issue.


Btw, I actually have your book The Art of Investing. 
If you haven't, you should read the Outsiders (which profiles Stiritz) and Billion Dollar Mistake which profiles how
Ackman lost a ton of money on Target.

I think you hit the nail on the head there. Alot of the writers at this site are hedge fund fanboys. Heck, not to
name names and pick on any aspiring writers but look at the first few comments to Tislon's article. He has
"God like" status. Not to say i don't have great respect for Ackman and Tilson because I do as I respect them
for their achievements (ie. being rich). But as their popularity grows so does their egos and in Ackman's case
in particular the ability to cut losses when proved wrong (or too early). Also if you are going to pick people to
blindly follow, Icahn being best friends of Obama is a better bet than Ackman.

Makes you wonder if Vandaele looked closely at the nutrition clubs or just assumed that all sales there were

Some points to consider  
1) At the time the study was done, the controversy surrounding hlf was very intense. Im pretty sure Dr. V
knew very well what was at stake.  
2) His study was done from the point of view of the FTC...not from the point of view of an investor, SEC, 
activist etc. He knew exactly what the FTC would be looking for 
3)He designed the study. Being a statisician, he probably understands the power and complexities of
numbers 
4)His expertise is in the area of cosumer products and retail. Akman's track record shows that he has a very
poor grasp of the cunsumer/retail sector.  
5) Now with these points in mind, who's analysis would you choose? Akman's or Dr V's.

After some years of trying to make money in the HL program, she gave up.


But she never lost faith in the products.

Mr.Tilson,your article is the height of naiveté;allow me to explain:In criminal law,there are no "gray areas"-it is very
much black and white;thus,you are shorting HLF,based predominately on Ackman's investigation,and despite his
expenditure of $50million,you make a statement that belies his conclusion that it is a thinly veiled criminal
enterprise.Despite you accolades for QTR,he like you are seriously underwater,like Ackman in your respective HLF
short;QTR deserves our respect,in that he chose to lose his own money,while you and Ackman,based upon your last
report are losing in the neighborhood of 60%.I love your statement,that the"laws and regulations for MLM's are
unclear"-that is your statement-when pray tell did you come to that understanding-before or after you made your short
bet?Forgive me,but if I were to put my client's money at risk with an HLF short-position,I would have done my due
diligence well before I made the bet;obviously you,nor QTR,nor Ackman had any inkling of the rules and
regulation,and now after a $50million investigation,this thought hits you like a thunderbolt.Did it ever cross your mind
that maybe the likes of Icahn,Soros,Bass,Chapm... and Loeb were well aware of your self-admitted complexities of
the legality of the MLM business;forgive me,but aren't you the same investor,who bought a boatload of Borders,when
it was $1/share thinking that it could possibly a good investment?You were not betting on the company so much as
betting against the prevailing wind of Wall Street,that it got it wrong.Why is a long investment in HLF any different?I
am not betting on HLF,I am betting against Ackman,who wagered an enormous amount of other people's
money;frankly,I do not believe that HLF is a criminal enterprise,and will be shut down based upon my own reading of
the regs and jurisprudence-is that a new concept?doing your own homework?Let's face it and if your inclined to be
honest answer this question-would you rather be in my position and be up 150% since Feb/2013 or would you rather
be down $600million+ like Ackman,or 60% down like you?Is it the fact that you,like Ackman are trying to rid the planet
of this "pestilence" in the hopes of receiving a Nobel Prize nomination or,at the minimum,a couple of extrs months in
days of indulgences.If you were to answer me honestly,and I know,as a matter of investment strategy,you cannot,but
you have to admit the the bad-mouthing of yourself,QTR,Ackman, and numerous others who inhabit this site,are
doing so just to make a buck.Let's cut out the sanctomiousness and discuss the merits of this company as a possible

The SEC, FTC, FBI, IRS and others routinely investigate companies for the hell of it, right? I mean, they
probably have nothing better to do, so they just went after HLF, on a whim.


One of the most preeminent experts on pyramid schemes sent a letter declaring HLF to be just that.


I hope you are not a lawyer, I truly do, because if so, I fear for your clients. Verdicts are black and white, the

"Enter Whitney Tilson, the self involved, self promotional and congratulatory talentless hack that follows every single
major investor into their investments and then appears on television to make the idea sound like his own. Tilson’s
awful track record, endless hours of conference hosting and blog writing versus actual research, and lack of creativity

or original thought are actually great counter indicators that HLF may actually survive and prove Ackman wrong. At
least Ackman does some work and comes up with an idea. Whitney is always the empty suit."


It's been close to 2 years since that comment and HLF is up about 150% since then. What do you think?

User 19446751
Can someone please answer one question for me? I have been following this saga since it broke and I have no dog in
the fight. I have been reading a ton of negative articles here, not many positive articles and would like to know this:  
If Herbalife is taking advantage of so many low income people like Mr. Ackman claims it is as quoted by the person
known as QTR and someone named Matt Stewart, why is it the only group that everyone talks about is low income
Hispanic members? Are they the only people that get involved in selling Herbalife? Where are the low income whites,
blacks and Asians at? To me, it seems as though Mr. Ackman is trying to pull the race card on this company or at
best, is using the Hispanic population to try and bring a company down that has been in business for over 34 years.
And if I did read correctly a while back, he seems bent on taking this fight to the end of the earth, which makes this
more of a personal vendetta and could spell trouble for someone like him. As I said, I have no dog in the fight but it
seems odd that Mr. Ackman is saying he is standing up for all of those people who are getting shafted by Herbalife,
but I only see one race of people. Seems odd to me. I guess I should stay away from this stock until this mess is
cleared.

Ok, now I'm absolutely, 100% sure you don't know what you're talking about. Pershing Square doesn't have
12-14 billion in assets. Pershing may manage assets owned by its investors, but they are not owned by
Pershing Square. And, rightly so -- PS is a hedge fund. Comparing a hedge fund's assets under management
to a CPG company's hard assets (especially one that does not utilize brick & mortar retail outlets) is just more
silliness, and anyone with knowledge and experience would know that without being told.


03 Aug 2014, 10:11 AM


Hell on Deals
Oh, and all that cash on HLF's balance sheet is theirs personally??? It's ultimately the shareholders in some
sense, same thing. I know PS is a hedge fund, you miss the point entirely. At the end of the day, both PS and
HLF are managing other people's money, how is that so different? Except that, PS is managing more of it.

These discussions--surprise surprise... do NOT deal with the single most important issue. How the hell does this
scam of a company sell ANYTHING? Herbalife is selling products easily had via hundreds, not thousands, of other
places, if sold under different sexy names, formulations, and promises. There is no "proprietary" herbal formula this
company can offer, for any market segment-- fat folks--that cannot be imitated, bested, upended, remixed, improved,
because you cannot patent herbs, or extracts of them, however druglike the stuff may be. It is utterly amazing that
indiscriminate peep buy these products, let alone buy them this way (NYSE:MLM).


27 Jul 2014, 09:46 AM


Nat Stewart, Contributor
You could say the same thing about many of the brand name products sold at the supermarket. The "special
formula" idea is mostly a marketing gimmick. There is nothing special about them, but people still pay a
premium for them.

Finally,let me address the utter duplicity of Ackman.In his Allergen deal,which will be the topic of an already-called
Congressional hearing,Ackman found a loophole in the law,which avoided his public disclosure of his position.Did he
beak the law-NO;Did he do something unethical-Yes;will he get to keep his profits-Yes.The number of Allergen
investors who sold prior ro Ackman's disclosure number in the hundred's of thousand who lost millions due to
Ackman's unethical,but legal behavior.Is it fair?Who knows?One thing is certain,that because of his antics Ackman
performed in the Allergen deal,he will be a pariah will the SEC-bet on it.

Another "one more thing"-if history is any guide, prior to earnings, QTR will make statements relative to the so-called
adverse effect of the Venezuela currency impact on HLF earnings-mark my words-it will happen


27 Jul 2014, 09:14 PM


j.ricci
In the words of Steve Jobs-One more thing: An investment in HLF is no different than playing Texas Hold 'Em with
Ackman one on one.It is a question of odds and risk assessment.The cards have been dealt,and Ackman needs the
King of Spades to win the Hand(the equivalent of the Federal Gov't closing down HLF).12 cards have been
exposed,and the "river card"has yet to be disclosed.There are 40 cards left in the deck.Ackman has a 1 in 40 chance
that the "river card" is the card he needs.That is a mathematical calculation of 1 in 40,or less than 3%(more
specifically,2.5%).Can the River Card be the King of Spades-of course.Are the overwhelming odds against it being the
King of Spades-Yes.Mr.Tilson,you are in the camp wherein you are hoping(if not praying) that the 2.5% prevails.Don't
get me wrong,that phenomenon could happen,but the odds are enormously against it. Under such an analogy,maybe
it will become clear to you why there are so many individuals(smart individuals),who have taken the other side of the
HLF bet.Also,and this question is directed not only to you but also QTR-Who purchased HLF shares on Tuesday?
Ackman is proud of the fact that for the first 6 months of this year made 25%-I made 25% on Tuesday alone.Who
purchased the 27million shares on Tuesday?I'll be happy with your guess.But,please endeavor to answer that
question.


27 Jul 2014, 09:14 PM


j.ricci
Mr.Tilson(and to a lesser extent,Mr.QTR)-I have absolutely no problem with investors "hawking" their investment
portfolio,it is done all the time and it is inherent in the marketplace.But,despite all of your arguments,try a novel
approach and do the math;in Massachusettes,Senator Markey sent out a letter to the FTC regarding 1 forelorned HLF
distributor which was debunked by an article of the Boston Globe;in Illinois,there are 16 disgruntles distributors;in New
york, there are 12.That is a total of 29 distributors out of 3.4 million worldwide.This information is in the public
domain,and you have access to this same information as I do. How many Mcdonalds franchisees are disgruntles? Do
a litigation search,and you will see that there are hundreds of lawsuits by these franchisees against Mcdonalds for
false misrepresentation;does that make Mcdonald's a "criminal enterprise"? Once again and Google the amount of
franchisees MCD has-the answer is over 250,000 worldwide. As to the issue of Hispanics being targeted,the
Californian "human rights" organization,has been the recipient of Ackman's largesse-what does that tell you?It should
tell you that Ackman is purchasing their loyalty-and regretfully,in this day and age,loyalty,like everything else,has its
price and can be bought. In conclusion,based upon published reports in the United States,there exists 26 disgruntles
individuals,out of 550,000 and to you.Ackman and QTR is a cause for alarm.Once again,I ask for your honesty,to the
extent you can give it:Ackman has expended $50million to conclude that 29 individuals with HLF are disgruntled;so if
he spents another $50million more,that number may increase to 50;another $50million, the number will increase to
100and so forth and so on.What Ackman succeeded in doing by his last presentation is prove to Wall Street that his
credibility is gone;the fact that you and QTR view the presentation as a bombshell event supporting your short thesis
is illogical;on the day of his presentation,HLF increased 25% on 27million shares;Ackman postulated that HLF was
buying,but that statement was debunked by Bloomberg News-so who was buying?Other than yourself and Ackman
there are no other significant short=sellers in the stock;surely retail shots could not have possibly traded that volume-

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2345145-how-has-herbalife-kept-the-game-going-for-so-long 69/85


so either one(1) of these options had to occur-(1) either you or Ackman covered,or (2) the longs in the stock bought
more,which,obviously,d... the float,and if so, will make it more difficult for you and Ackman to cover,in the not to distant
future.Mr.Tilson,please accept the fact, that the inhabitants of this site are extremely educated investors,who can
divine the difference between Chicken turd from Chicken Salad-we read what you read;we listen to what you listen;so
far,it is our investments instincts,that by far out-distance yours. As a result,if you are going to continue your smear
campaign,may I suggest,that more detailed intellectual arguments are utilized;if not, to the extent you have not
already lost your credibility,there may occur a significant aftermath and financial consequences relative to your own
investors in your hedge fund;please remember,that unlike Ackman and his profitable Allergen bet,you do not have any
such shining investments in your own investment portfolio-the more you breach the sagacity of Ackman as to HLF,the
more financial substance you will risk.Accept the fact that you made a mistake and cut your losses-isn't that your
fiduciary responsibity to your investors?


27 Jul 2014, 09:14 PM


j.ricci
BTW,at the conference Ackman referred to Matt Stewart as a "genius"-that is the equivalent to a kiss of
death.Regretfully,Ackman did not mention QTR-if he did,the stock would propelled another 10%-Could you imagine
the laughter in the auditorium would have been,had Bill Ackman stated that the big time media has neglected to follow
his HLF accusations,but that he is particularly impressed and grateful to "Quote THE Raven",for his prodigious and
excellent work on the topic?Had he did,even's Ackman's father would have put a bag over his head.


27 Jul 2014, 09:26 PM


j.ricci
If you want a telling moment in the debate,I recommend that each of you fast-forward on the Ackman
presentation,until he gets to the Q andA,wherein he calls on his own father for heaven's sake-this poor man,after
sitting through 3 hours of Ackman's so-called evidence asks:"Bill,what is your definition of a pyramid scheme and how
close are you to proving that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme"-that is an exact quote from his own father,who obviously
was still in the dark as to his son's presentation and evidence,and did not believe his son has yet to prove his case
that HLF is a pyramid scheme.I also suggest you fast-forward to the last question from a lady,who adroitly asks how
could HLF be a pyramid if its return policy is 100% and the company pays for shipping?Listen to this;Ackman answers
that the present return policy did not come into being until Ackman got involved,implying that HLF is less of a pyramid
scheme than what it was 18 months ago and that it was due to Ackman's involvement.According to Ackman,we longs
may owe him a debt of gratitude.Unbelieveable


27 Jul 2014, 09:26 PM


j.ricci
Final thought: How much resolve in his short bet can Ackman be,when at the conference he read a disclaimer
that"Pershing Square reserves the right to cover some or all of its position,at any time and without notice".I am sure
Tilson and the other disciples must have been thrilled to heat that;as for tomorrow,please mark these thoughts-
sometime tomorrow afternoon or during the conference on Tuesday,HLF will announce 2 things-(1)that progress is
being made with the FTC;and (2)HLF has amended the shareholder agreement with Icahn to allow Icahn to purchase
more than 25% of the company(personally,I believe it was Icahn and Bob Chapman,who were buying hand over fist

on Tuesday)-if just one materializes the price will top $85-if both,then the price goes over $100,as Ackman will need
to cover furiously;if you recall what happened with GMCR several months ago,when Coke diclosed a 10% position,it
caused Einhorn to bid the price up after-hours over 55%-so there is precedent for what I predict

If HLF is not fraud then how about a few regulations for the industry (esp HLF)?


1. All sales tax collected at point of sale and each sale documented. 
2. Disclosure for all members that product does not treat or cure any medical condition and describing it as such
opens them up to personal liability 
3. Disclosure of how much the average member/distributor made in the past year and the earnings of all individuals in
the organization signed before anyone joins the organization. 
4. All nutrition clubs must be certified as food serving establishments by local health departments and obey all other
food service laws and regulations.


Pretty simple, easy and transparent... in fact, all other business have to follow these types of regulations. Investments
require documentation the client understands the risks they are taking, every vitamin bottle discloses the product does
not treat or cure anything and all business that serve food have to follow regulations.


But it would mean the end of Herbalife if all were put into practice

Letter delivered to SEC today (original images - which included snapshots of key HLF material supporting data in the
requests may not show & some portions redacted to protect sensitive information):


July 30, 2014


The Honorable Mary Jo White, Chairman 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
100 F Street, NE 
Washington, DC 20549


Dear Madam,


I hope this letter finds you well. I am encouraged, in this matter, to send it to you because of your deep background as
a securities fraud lawyer and a federal prosecutor. Personally, I am gratified for the actions you undertook in bringing
to justice those responsible for the 1983 WTC bombing and the bombings of certain embassies. My family has had a
long and proud association to the U.S. military, and (redacted)


I have been told by several journalists that it will take someone of exceeding intellectual rigour to understand some of
the issues and concerns I will detail with this package, and there too, I appreciate your talents and thus send this with
the greatest of hope it is reaching the correct audience.


What I am enclosing includes both the form of a “FOIA” request (which I request so that if my arguments here are
deficient, I may better understand the SEC’s position in the matter by requesting the documents and information that
would pertain to it), and a corresponding request that the SEC pursue a somewhat unusual matter that is principally of
interest to me, but potentially of interest to anyone conducting business within the economic confines of the
Exchange, or affected by it.


First, to complete your understanding of my interest (both intellectual and fiduciary) I will provide a little background if I
may.


It has been acknowledged by many of my colleagues, even those that hold me in the highest esteem, that I have a
penchant for - even a preference for – investigating the most complex, obscure, and potentially “lost” causes. My
inquisitive nature, the same one that got me admitted to Johns Hopkins University when I was eleven, loves a
challenge. It was in this spirit that a colleague detailed for me some months ago what he framed as “the hottest topic
on Wall Street” - the Herbalife saga.


My professional background includes a litany of positions and roles that mirror my devotion to both the under-served
and the overly cunning. I have conducted all manner of investigations on behalf of some government agencies, as
well as private corporations and non-profit entities. Currently I work for (redacted) my duties there include ...(redacted)

(working with the FBI’s Kabul office) in identifying members of the Pakistani terror group Tehrik-i-Taliban (NYSE:TTP)
that threatened (redacted) in Afghanistan. (redacted) I also oversee the Risk Management Program, (redacted)


Because I have only a small government pension and (redacted) I have no financial stake in any actions undertaken
with reference to Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) . None. My investigation and research began as the result of a collegial dare,
“See if you can do any better than anyone else in understanding HLF’s financials.”


I do have some skills with that regard. At (redacted) I often work with foreign currencies and assess operational
capacities. I was one of the lead analysts sent by (redacted) to Indonesia in 2006 to evaluate (redacted) 2004 Asian
tsunami and conducted an analysis of both physical operations and the financial accounting methods used to
effectuate programs using ~$200M in both USAID (redacted) funds. To determine risk, I often investigate balance
sheets and filings for irregularities. (Redacted)


[SECTION REDACTED] 
My requests – which come with the included supportive documentation from my research – are these:


• That the SEC investigate the role of “volume points” within the corporate structure of HLF, to determine if they are a
virtual currency that should be regulated by the US Treasury (a second package of that nature is going to the US
Treasury). FinCen has a number of regulations to discern if an instrument used as a proxy for value constitutes a
“virtual currency” and they are detailed at length in the supporting documentation, and include references to the
following applicable US codes, regulations and laws: 
• Bank Secrecy Act 
• Final Rule on “Money Service Businesses” 
• Guidance on “Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual
Currencies” (March 18, 2013) 
• Final Rule on “Pre-Paid Access”


And, specifically, that “volume points” appear to comport to all the regulatory requirements to be met by a “virtual
currency” including the FinCEN definitions that:


• “In contrast to real currency, "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some
environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency;” 
• “This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real
currency;” 
• “Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter
under the regulations implementing the BSA;” (Bank Secrecy Act) 
• “The second type of activity involves a convertible virtual currency that has a centralized repository. The
administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between
persons or from one location to another.;” (i.e., internationally) 
• “…any exchanger that uses its access to the convertible virtual currency services provided by the administrator to
accept and transmit the convertible virtual currency on behalf of others, including transfers intended to pay a third
party for virtual goods and services, is also a money transmitter;” (I.e., the transaction between HLF customers, the
distributors, and the company) 
• “How a person engages in "obtaining" a virtual currency may be described using any number of other terms, such as
"earning," "harvesting," "mining," "creating," "auto-generating," "manufacturing," or "purchasing," depending on the
details of the specific virtual currency model involved. For purposes of this guidance, the label applied to a particular

process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of
the person engaging in the process.” (i.e., distributors obtaining/accumulating volume points, from the company’s own
literature): 
• 
SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1hu9wCa


• That the SEC determine if, given the SEC’s own language in the CF Financial Reporting Manual (beginning with
Section 6600, “Selection of a Reporting Currency”), if “volume points” are allowable as a measure of revenue
reporting;


• That the SEC determine, given the requirement in Section 6620 that for foreign corporations (HLF is registered in
the Cayman Islands) certain conditions must be met to demonstrate that the chosen “currency” is of sufficient stability,
solvency and universality to be used as a reporting currency, if “volume points” meet that requirement, or are capable
of meeting it, or if HLF has been using “volume points” in that capacity in violation of that requirement:


• Or that the SEC determine whether, for purposes of filing and registration, that HLF must comport to the provisions
required for a domestic registrant since HLF also operates as Herbalife International of America Inc. in which case, as
a domestic registrant dollars would be the required form of currency used for reporting;


• That the SEC determine if HLF is criminally culpable or civilly liable for violating the provisions of that requirement by
using “volume” and “volume points” within SEC filings to avoid proper disclosure; 
` 
Note that according to Herbalife “volume points” and “volume” are interchangeable terms, so for the whole of this
document/request, let it be stated that any reference to “volume points” incorporated herein shall refer to HLF’s use of
either “volume points” or “volume” in its filings, financial statements and guidance:


SOURCE: http://bit.ly/1qO3OEL, Page 1, in a statement by General Counsel Brett Chapman


• That the SEC determine if HLF’s reliance on using “volume points” to report certain events and numbers within its
formal filings to the SEC is used in a manner designed to criminally circumvent the SEC’s requirement to divulge
certain material events with the potential ancillary possibility of misinforming investors and which constitutes fraud;


• That the SEC enquire to HLF as to how their auditors value “volume points” for reporting purposes, and determine if
that process is consistent and transparent when being used to convert figures, such as distributor sales and
compensation, back into dollars or any other recognized currency for the purposes of government regulatory filings,
tax purposes and investor guidance;


• That, if it is determined that “volume points” constitute a virtual currency, or if it is determined that “volume points”
are an improper proxy for value in filings and financial statements, that the SEC will require HLF to re-state any and
all financial statements and filings in which “volume points” are used in an improper manner using an acceptable
currency measurement;


• That the SEC determine, regardless of any ruling by the US Treasury that “volume points” are or aren’t a virtual

• That, pursuant to the above sections requiring the use of a US recognized currency for filing purposes, the SEC
require HLF, pending the request for a determination of “volume points” as a virtual currency by the US
Treasury/FinCEN, to report all figures currently expressed as “volume” and “volume points.” in US dollars or other
recognized currency.


In tandem with the requests detailed above for actions to be taken by the SEC to clear up this matter, I am requesting
the following information and production of documents under “FOIA” that might pertain to any aspect of this issue:


• Any data, documentations, correspondence (notes, memos, emails, letters, transmitted forms or filings, etc.), ruling
or other material information made by or for the SEC by any entity – private or public - that pertains to the use of
“volume points” within HLF’s SEC filings, including discussion with other government agencies, and or
acknowledgement that some such documentation is under review is part of a current investigation and therefore
outside of the scope of FOIA;


• Any data, documentations, correspondence (notes, memos, emails, letters, transmitted forms or filings, etc.), ruling
or other material information made by or for the SEC by an entity – private or public - that pertains to the use of
“volume points” within HLF’s SEC filings, by and between the SEC or other government agency with HLF, its auditors
or any other entity acting on behalf of HLF.


I am confident you can see how these issues are of grave concern to anyone determined to see that investing in, and
transacting business with, SEC regulated entities can be conducted with the proper assurances that the SEC’s laws
are properly enforced, and that confidence in American commerce will be upheld.


Insomuch that this topic is one of immense public interest and the outcomes of any investigation have the potential to
positively affect many communities through either remediation or reassurance, and I am therefore requesting these
actions, and making these disclosure requests in the public interest, I request that the SEC waive any costs
associated with the production of documents and other materials and its compliance related to the “FOIA” aspect of
this letter.


Finally, I ask in the name of privacy that if this request is required to be publically disclosed, that you release the
enclosed redacted version which avoids public disclosure of information that could be used to identify me -to do
otherwise might incur potential risk to my personal safety. None of the redacted material, which is of a biographical
and career information nature, is material to this request.


Thank you for your service, and for your time and attention to this matter.


Sincerely,

Ms. Jennifer Shasky Calvery, Director 
FinCEN 
U.S. Department of the Treasury 
1500 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 
Washington DC 20220


Dear Madam,


I hope this letter finds you well. Just as with my letter to Chairman White at the SEC (enclosed), I am encouraged by
your long history and deep knowledge of topics associated with the matter I would like to bring to your attention.


I have been told by several journalists that it will take someone of exceeding intellectual rigour to understand some of
the issues and concerns I will detail with this package, and there too, I appreciate your talents and thus send this with
the greatest of hope it is reaching the correct audience.


What I am enclosing includes both the form of a “FOIA” request (which I request so that if my arguments here are
deficient, I may better understand FinCEN/Treasury’s position in the matter by requesting the documents and
information that would pertain to it), and a corresponding request that FinCEN/Treasury pursue a somewhat unusual
matter that is principally of interest to me, but potentially of interest to anyone conducting business within the
economic commerce, or affected by it.


First, to complete your understanding of my interest (both intellectual and fiduciary) I will provide a little background if I
may.


It has been acknowledged by many of my colleagues, even those that hold me in the highest esteem, that I have a
penchant for - even a preference for – investigating the most complex, obscure, and potentially “lost” causes. My
inquisitive nature, the same one that got me admitted to Johns Hopkins University when I was eleven, loves a
challenge. It was in this spirit that a colleague detailed for me some months ago what he framed as “the hottest topic
on Wall Street” - the Herbalife saga.


My professional background includes a litany of positions and roles that mirror my devotion to both the under-served
and the overly cunning. I have conducted all manner of investigations on behalf of some government agencies, as
well as private corporations and non-profit entities. Currently I work for (redacted) administering (redacted) 's AML
program to ensure that we are complying with the USA PATRIOT ACT. I have assisted (redacted) (working with the
FBI’s Kabul office) in identifying members of the Pakistani terror group Tehrik-i-Taliban that threatened (redacted) in
Afghanistan. (Redacted) I also oversee the Risk Management Program, (redacted)


Because I have only a small government pension and (redacted) , I have no financial stake in any actions undertaken
with reference to Herbalife (NYSE:http://bit.ly/RGdvEj) . None. My investigation and research began as the result of a
collegial dare, “See if you can do any better than anyone else in understanding HLF’s financials.”


I do have some skills with that regard. I often work with foreign currencies and assess operational capacities. I was
one of the lead analysts sent by (redacted) to Indonesia in 2006 to evaluate (redacted) and conducted an analysis of
both physical operations and the financial accounting methods used to effectuate our programs using ~$200M in both
USAID and (redacted) funds. (redacted) I often investigate balance sheets and filings for irregularities. (Redacted)

My requests – which come with the included supportive documentation from my research – are these:


• That FinCEN/Treasury investigate the role of “volume points” within the corporate structure of HLF, to determine if
they are a virtual currency that should be regulated by the US Treasury (a second package of that nature is going to
the SEC). FinCen has a number of regulations to discern if an instrument used as a proxy for value constitutes a
“virtual currency” and they are detailed at length in the supporting documentation, and include references to the
following applicable US codes, regulations and laws: 
• Bank Secrecy Act 
• Final Rule on “Money Service Businesses” 
• Guidance on “Application of FinCEN's Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual
Currencies” (March 18, 2013) 
• Final Rule on “Pre-Paid Access”


And, specifically, that “volume points” appear to comport to all the regulatory requirements to be met by a “virtual
currency” including the FinCEN definitions that:


• “In contrast to real currency, "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some
environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency;” 
• “This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real
currency;” 
• “Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter
under the regulations implementing the BSA;” (Bank Secrecy Act) 
• “The second type of activity involves a convertible virtual currency that has a centralized repository. The
administrator of that repository will be a money transmitter to the extent that it allows transfers of value between
persons or from one location to another.;” (i.e., internationally) 
• “…any exchanger that uses its access to the convertible virtual currency services provided by the administrator to
accept and transmit the convertible virtual currency on behalf of others, including transfers intended to pay a third
party for virtual goods and services, is also a money transmitter;” (I.e., the transaction between HLF customers, the
distributors, and the company) 
• “How a person engages in "obtaining" a virtual currency may be described using any number of other terms, such as
"earning," "harvesting," "mining," "creating," "auto-generating," "manufacturing," or "purchasing," depending on the
details of the specific virtual currency model involved. For purposes of this guidance, the label applied to a particular
process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of
the person engaging in the process.” (i.e., distributors obtaining/accumulating volume points, from the company’s own
literature):

• That the Treasury determine if, according to regulations of the SEC in the CF Financial Reporting Manual (beginning
with Section 6600, “Selection of a Reporting Currency”), if “volume points” are allowable as a measure of revenue
reporting, and/or the de factor use of “volume points” by HLF in reporting documents conveys upon them status as a
“virtual currency”;


• That FinCEN/Treasury determine, what if any legitimacy “volume points” have in terms of use as a virtual currency
for official regulatory reporting requirements. And if they can meet the requirements stated in SEC regulations that a

unit of measure used as “currency” in a reporting document be of sufficient stability, solvency and universality to be
used as a reporting currency, if “volume points” meet that requirement, or are capable of meeting it, or if HLF has
been using “volume points” in that capacity in violation of that requirement:

• That FinCEN/Treasury determine if the volatility and vagueness of “volume points” assigned (Corporately
determined) value(s) is permissible for use in government regulatory filings, such as those required by the SEC. It is
important to note that an analysis determined that “volume points” have no constant value, even on the same page.
To wit, an analysis of a Malaysian product price sheet distributed by HLF shows that the relative “value” of a “volume
point” has no relation to any recognized currency nor any commodity. It appears, quite simply, to be randomly
assigned despite the fact that HLF is conducting commerce using it as a proxy for value in terms of :

Herbalife Volume Points Explained 
Each Herbalife product is assigned a Volume Point Value. For example, the Herbalife Shake, or Formula 1 Nutritional
Shake Mix, has a Volume Point Value of 23.95 Volume Points. Therefore, no matter where in the Herbalife world you
are, or in what currency you pay for your Herbalife products, the Volume Point Value of your order will be the same
everywhere. 
Move up the Marketing Plan by accumulating Volume Points in these ways: 
• PPV = Personally Purchased Volume 
Volume purchased by you directly from Herbalife using your Herbalife ID number 
• DLV = Downline Volume 
Volume purchased by your non-Supervisor downline Distributors directly from Herbalife, ordering between 25% to
42% discount using their Herbalife ID numbers. 
• OV = Organizational Volume 
The personal volume points of all your Supervisors, three Supervisor Levels deep. This is the Volume Points on which
a Supervisor is paid a Royalty Override of up to 5%. 
Personal Volume (PV) 
• Volume purchased directly from Herbalife by you (PPV) plus the volume purchased by all your non-Supervisor
downline Distributors who orders at a discount of between 25% to 42% (DLV) in that same calendar month. 
• It therefore excludes any 50% discount orders by Qualifying Supervisors and orders of Fully Qualified Supervisors
and their distributors. 
• Your PV, PPV and DLV can be tracked by logging in to your http://bit.ly/1te9F3s website using your unique Herbalife
ID number and PIN code. 
Your Personal Volume Points determine you discount level. 
For example: 
You are a distributor living in Australia. You sponsor B, a distributor living in England. B places an order for 200
Volume Points at a 25% from Herbalife on the 12th of the month. Both you and B now have 200 Personal Volume

Points, because B’s volume points is part of your DLV which counts for you too. 
If you now place an order of 300 volume points from Herbalife in the same calendar month, that order will push your
Personal Volume for the month to 500 volume points, and therefore you will purchase that 300 volume point order at a
35% discount. This will also qualify you to the Senior Consultant level. You will never fall back to the 25% discount
again. 
Your Volume Points and the Volume Points purchased by your Distributors who are not yet Supervisors, count for you
as Personal Volume and will help you qualify to the next discount levels. 
Whether you are in Spain, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, United States or where ever in the Herbalife World you
might find yourself, you will get equal treatment from the Herbalife Marketing Plan. 
If we therefore say, “you only need to buy 300 more Volume Points to qualify to the Next Level”, it basically means
you can make up any order of Herbalife products which have a combined Volume Point Value of more than 300
Volume Points. 
Herbalife Volume Points are only valid for the calendar month in which they were acquired. 
On the 1st of every new month, we all start with ZERO Personal Volume Points. 
We then build on these Volume Points as the month progresses and our total Personal Volume for that particular
month, is the total on the last day of the month (called “month end”). 
The first of the next month, we all start at ZERO again. 
The reason behind this, is so Herbalife can have a cut-off date to calculate everyone’s commissions and profits
generated from those orders, which is then paid on the 15th and 21st of the following month.

• That FinCEN/Treasury determine if HLF’s decision to use “volume points” to report certain events and numbers
within formal filings to the SEC, the IRS and other agencies was intended to criminally circumvent the SEC’s
requirement to divulge certain material events with the potential ancillary possibility of misinforming investors and
which constitutes fraud;


• That FinCEN/Treaasury enquire to HLF as to how their auditors value “volume points” for reporting purposes, and
determine if that process is consistent and transparent when being used to convert figures, such as distributor sales
and compensation, back into dollars or any other recognized currency for the purposes of government regulatory
filings, tax purposes and investor guidance, with particular emphasis on how calculations used, if any, would comply
with government/IRS tax reporting requirements designed to ensure that proper value is assigned to any proxy value.


• That, if it is determined that “volume points” constitute a virtual currency, or if it is determined that “volume points”
are an improper proxy for value in filings and financial statements, that FinCEN/Treasury will require HLF to re-state
any and all financial statements and filings in which “volume points” are used in an improper manner using an
acceptable currency measurement, that FinCEN/Treasury will require HLF to re-submit any tax filings that previous
used” volume points” as either a primary measurement, or as a means or method of conveyance of value in corporate
transactions (example, distributor compensation) which provide a foundation for the figures used in those financial
filings;


• That FinCEN/Treasury seek to determine, regardless of any ruling that “volume points” are or aren’t a virtual
currency, if they are used in tandem with non-GAAP practices such as transfer pricing to shield revenues from public
disclosure, to avoid taxes or to circumvent currency controls either in the U.S. or internationally;


• That, pursuant to the above sections requiring the use of a US recognized currency for filing purposes, the
FinCEn/Treasury, in concert with the SEC require HLF, pending the request for a determination of “volume points” as
a virtual currency by the US Treasury/FinCEN, to report all figures currently expressed as “volume” and “volume
points.” in US dollars or other recognized currency.


In tandem with the requests detailed above for actions to be taken by FinCEN/Treasury to clear up this matter, I am
requesting the following information and production of documents under “FOIA” that might pertain to any aspect of
this issue:


• Any data, documentations, correspondence (notes, memos, emails, letters, transmitted forms or filings, etc.), ruling
or other material information made by or for FinCEN/Treasury by any entity – private or public - that pertains to the
use of “volume points” within HLF’s IRS filings or tax documents, including discussion with other government
agencies, and or acknowledgement that some such documentation is under review is part of a current investigation
and therefore outside of the scope of FOIA;

Hell on Deals,


The below is from HLF's 10-Q. In addition to the questions you raise, you will note HLF neither requires the volume
point value for a product to be consistent across all markets, regions, and countries nor assures the volume point
value for a product won't change from year to year.

A key non-financial measure we focus on is Volume Points on a Royalty Basis, or Volume Points, which is essentially
our weighted average measure of product sales volume. Volume Points, which are unaffected by exchange rates or
price changes, are used by management as a proxy for sales trends because in general, an increase in Volume
Points in a particular geographic region or country indicates an increase in our local currency net sales while a
decrease in Volume Points in a particular geographic region or country indicates a decrease in our local currency net
sales. 
We assign a Volume Point value to a product when it is first introduced into a market and the value is unaffected by
subsequent exchange rate and price changes. The specific number of Volume Points assigned to a product, and
generally consistent across all markets, is based on a Volume Point to suggested retail price ratio for similar products.
If a product is available in different quantities, the various sizes will have different Volume Point values. In general,
once assigned, a Volume Point value is consistent in each region and country and does not change from year to year.
The reason Volume Points are used in the manner described above is that we use Volume Points for Member
qualification and recognition purposes and therefore we attempt to keep Volume Points for a similar or like product
consistent on a global basis. However, because Volume Points are a function of value rather than product type or
size, they are not a reliable measure for product mix. As an example, an increase in Volume Points in a specific
country or region could mean a significant increase in sales of less expensive products or a marginal increase in sales
of more expensive products.

I read all that before, and its beside the "point" - my point is, you (I assume you are somehow related to corporate
"HLF" since you use "we" and "our" in your explanations) that "you" - HLF - use it like currency when it doesn't meet
the standards for currency, and more importantly, the SEC requires certain measures to be in "recognized currency" -
the "volume point" is not a recognized currency. Even if Treasury accedes to my request and declares it a virtual
currency, for prior years when it was not recognized, HLF may still be in violation of SEC regulations by using "volume
points" to convey monetary value that is in turn reflected in statutory filings. It's even more complex that that, I studied
it for about 5 months and have over 100 pages of analysis. In simpler terms, you pay people it! - you're using it as a
currency! Welcome to the real world. It should be illegal - no wait, it is! - to file SEC documents based on a fake
currency, and yet that is what you ("HLF") are doing.


One of the standards for a currency is that it have a consistent value relative to something else (in laymen's terms)
and yet by your own admission (in corporate documents) it has NO consistency. I did any number of calculations. The
"volume point" has a different value - calculated out - from product to product, from country to country. You ("HLF")
establish this when you say things like, "Therefore, no matter where in the Herbalife world you are, or in what
currency you pay for your Herbalife products, the Volume Point Value of your order will be the same everywhere."
That's because you are pegging the value to an HLF product, not an exchange rate or another currency, and thus the
value never stays constant. You are using it like currency - paying compensation based in it, using it to purchase
commodities, and finally, using it to measure corporate material events, when it has no established value. That'sounds
fraudulent, but even if its not, its also not allowed to be used as a basis for figures that get translated into financial
numbers on an SEC doc. If you are really from HLF corporate, you can start shitting bricks now. I await any reply you
have - after all, I have at least a five month's head start on you.

You say: "I assume you are somehow related to corporate "HLF" since you use "we" and "our" in your
explanations"


I'm amazed that someone who claims to be so smart did not instantly recognize that the language using "we"
and "our" was an excerpt from an SEC filing.


Also, note the reference in the quote to "key non-financial measure." HLF complies with GAAP. That it
provides information (volume points) in addition to GAAP is not a problem.


On the currency, how is it a currency if it can't be exchanged? It is a performance measure used for
compensation. Many companies have bonus plans that are based on various financial and operational
metrics.


You are missing the forest for the trees.

Nope not missing the forest for the trees. They pay people in it, AS A UNIT OF MEASURE. Its one thing to
have a bonus plan and compensate people in bonus DOLLARS (a recognized currency) or OPTIONS (also
recognized), but quite another to pay them in bonus VOLUME POINTS. That makes it a de facto virtual or
alternative currency and subject to Treasury regulation.


Also, as to how bright I am, that's for others to decide (and like Diogenes, I'm willing to admit I don't know
everything - Diogenes is a good fit for another reason, he tackled the issue of the debasement of currency),
but the comment about them being with corporate was a riff off them using the royal "we"...and was
somewhat sarcastic on my part.


GAAP v. non-GAAP, I was specifically addressing their use of non-GAAP transfer pricing, they admit to this
use in their filings, and they stipulate that its a non-GAAP practice. My reference was to the detailed analysis I
included to the regulatory agencies (and which for reasons of length can't be submitted here, its ~50 pages of
white paper, and an additional 60 pages of notes) which details how they could combine non-GAAP transfer
pricing with volume points to potentially practice tax avoidance and other issues of concern.

I think you misunderstand the Volume Points. They are used in a formula to pay bonuses, not as a de facto
virtual or alternative currency.

Can you provide an example of where the same HLF product has different Value Points in different countries?
I'm just looking for a specific example, instead of broad, unsubstantiated statements

Hell on Deals,


I wouldn't fit in very well at HLF corporate as I agree with Ackman that HLF is a pyramid scheme. From what you are
saying HLF may yet have another problem on its hands. The list seems to be getting longer all the time.

Sure, we might as well have a party of regulators and law enforcement, SEC, FTC, DOJ, FBI, two state AGs,
and now Treasury... Perhaps the market might even get it that something is up ?

Rogier.. The market doesn't believe Ackman. Now with the Allergan suit.. people will see him as the guy being sued
by the 'botox' company, for insider trading.
