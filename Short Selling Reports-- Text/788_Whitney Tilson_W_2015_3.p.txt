Wayfair's Compensation Shenanigans And Massive Insider Selling
Nov. 23, 2015 6:57 AM ET15 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Wayfair has persuaded investors and analysts to focus on “adjusted EBITDA” and
free cash flow rather than GAAP earnings.


The company pays its top executives far below market salaries, thereby minimizing
cash compensation costs.


To offset low cash comp, Wayfair gives its top executives large stock/option grants.


The company has instituted a Rule 10b5-1 automatic selling plan to convert the
stock/option grants back into cash comp, resulting in massive insider selling by the
top eight executives of nearly $7 million per month over the last seven months.


The effect of this scheme is to inflate reported “adjusted EBITDA” and free cash flow.


This scheme is fairly common among tech and venture/private equity-back
companies – but Wayfair’s is among the blatant and has among the biggest impacts
on reported financials.


Some public companies, especially money-losing ones in the tech sector, adopt some
form of a compensation scheme for top executives that has the effect of maximizing both
total compensation and also, counterintuitively, preferred financial metrics like "adjusted"
EBITDA/earnings and free cash flow.


Here's how it works:


1. Persuade investors and analysts to focus on "adjusted" EBITDA/earnings and free
cash flow rather than GAAP earnings;


2. Pay top management very low cash salaries;
3. Replace this lost income with large stock/option grants; and
4. Institute a Rule 10b5-1 automatic selling plan to convert the stock/option grants back


into cash comp


As a result of this compensation scheme, adjusted EBITDA/earnings is enhanced
because it excludes "the impact of equity-based compensation and related taxes", and
free cash flow is enhanced because lower cash comp means "cash provided by operating

activities" is higher.


Cash Comp and Insider Selling for Wayfair's Top Eight Executives


While many companies have adopted some form of this scheme, Wayfair appears to be
an extreme example, as cash comp for the top eight officers is laughably low (a mere $1.8
million annually combined) and they're dumping their stock like mad: $48 million of stock
sales since April 1st - an average of nearly $7 million per month - a jaw-dropping run for
the exits, as this table shows:


But wait - it gets worse! Even among these ultra-low salaries, the $80,000 for each of
Wayfair's co-founders, Shah and Conine, are noteworthy – but they weren't always so low,
as each "elected to reduce their base salaries to $80,000 for 2014 from $480,000 in
2013…because our goal was to weigh compensation towards providing equity awards to
ensure that a significant portion of an NEOs' [named executive officers'] compensation
opportunity is related to factors that directly and indirectly influence stockholder value."


The impact of them cutting their salaries by $400,000 each was to increase Wayfair's
"adjusted EBITDA" and free cash flow by more than $800,000 in 2014 (there's also a tax
benefit to the company).


But don't shed any tears for Shah and Conine: in addition to each owning Wayfair stock
worth approximately $600 million, in October 2013, at roughly the same time that they
agreed to cut their salaries by $400,000, the board awarded each of them large stock
awards (restricted stock units) valued at $3.1 million. Now that's a "sacrifice" I'd make all
day long!


The Impact of Wayfair's Compensation Scheme on Its Financials

So let's take a look at how all this stock-based compensation improves Wayfair's non-
GAAP, self-reported financials. First, here's Wayfair's GAAP net income for each quarter
since Q1 '13:


Now, here's net income as well as Wayfair's non-GAAP, self-reported "adjusted EBITDA":


Over these nine quarters, net income was -$217.2 million vs. adjusted EBITDA of -$81.1
million, a massive $135.1 million higher - and, nearly two-thirds (64%) of this improvement
was due to excluding "equity-based compensation and related taxes."

Equity-Based Compensation as a Percentage of Free Cash Flow


One way to measure how much equity-based comp is being doled out by a company is to
compare it to the free cash flow a company generates. Here's a chart showing each of
these amounts by quarter for Wayfair:


As one can see, in the nine quarters since Q3 '13, Wayfair has generated $17.2 million of
free cash flow - and doled out stock and options worth $86.5 million. Over the past four
quarters, the figures are $62.3 million of free cash flow and $81.0 million of stock-based
compensation.


This chart shows how Wayfair compares to three other companies over the past year
(Wayfair's percentage would be much higher if the comparison were the entire nine
quarters or Q1-Q3 '15):

As one can see, Wayfair is much worse than even salesforce.com, which is notorious for
doling out excessive stock-based compensation.


The Best Time to Short Wayfair


Wayfair is a very crowded short right now, with 42% of the float short, which means there's
a risk of a short squeeze, so size it appropriately. In addition, even if you can get the
borrow (I've heard it's tough), it's expensive: I'm currently paying a negative rebate of
-17.2% annually. This isn't surprising given that the stock only went public a year ago and
only 37% of the 84 million shares outstanding are part of the float currently.


However, the risk of a short squeeze will diminish and the borrow may become less
expensive and more readily available over time if insiders and private equity firms
continue to sell. In particular, keep an eye out for Wayfair to announce a secondary
offering, which I would expect in the next few months if the stock remains elevated.


This would significantly increase the float and put a lot of stock into weak hands - as one
friend described to me: "some chumps whose investment banking salesperson told them,
'You gotta take this down.'" This point, right after the secondary, might be the very best
time to short the stock.

Wayfair is by no means the only company to utilize stock-based compensation, report
non-GAAP earnings, and have massive insider selling, but it certainly appears to be an
extreme example.


Prudent investors might want to ask themselves: if insiders are in such a rush to sell this
stock, why would I want to buy it?


Disclosure: I am/we are short WAYFAIR.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article.

That is a brutal takedown of a company that well deserves it.

Mr. Tilson - if you read my short thesis on Fitbit, published here on SA - you would seen insiders just sold 14 millions
shares at $29. There are 140 million shared owned at $1 per share and they granted themselves 40 million low cost
options.


Why did you bet the ranch shorting Fitbit at $37? Wasn't Fitbit a much more compelling short?

I've always been baffled by the move to back out stock-based compensation from adjusted numbers.


Adjusted numbers have some value... if you are excluding one-time charges to make quarters more comparable for
the underlying business. But if you're excluding normal, everyday stock-based compensation, that isn't ever going to
go away or change.


Its rampant in tech and its aggravating to see this type of non-GAAP accounting spreading outside that industry.

The backing out of stock-based compensation is primarily of use for bond (and other credit) investors -- who
are more focused on cash flow and don't care about dilution (in fact, they welcome share issuance and equity
dilution).


For equity investors, backing out share-based compensation doesn't make much sense (and since Wayfair
has no debt, it makes less sense for them to make this adjustment). That said, if their comps. have debt and
use this number, it may be useful for comparison purposes across the industry.


In any event, this is very common and investors are not as stupid as some people may think (in aggregate).
While a company may focus on this adjusted EBITDA number, the market knows what's going on and isn't
confusing "adjusted EBITDA" with actual earnings.

Here are Billionaire, John Malone's thoughts on executive compensation. Last time I checked, John Malone was
worth north of $7 billion.


http://cnb.cx/1MMRKJx


MALONE ON EXECUTIVE PAY


Faber: Zaslav makes an awful lot of money. Maffei makes an awful lot of money. You pay your guys so much money.
Why do you pay them so much money?


Malone: Whoa. This is black-scholes models. My philosophy is I give them large stock option grants up front that are
meant to compensate them for the next five years. They vest over four and five years out. Stock performs, they can
make a lot of money. If the stock doesn't perform, they don't make anything. Okay? So I want my CEOs to be just like
me. Invested in the company in its long-term success…I won't apologize to anybody and I think the black-scholes
model sucks as a mathematician. You know, how many executives do you know that really want their options to be
granted when the stock is at an all-time high?

Given the cost to borrow, have you thought about using the options instead. You could create a synthetic short stock
position (long put, short call on the same strike). I haven't run the numbers, but that might work, although the cost to
borrow should be imbedded in the options prices as well.

The options are also pretty illiquid as there are not much open interest. Also, the bid ask spreads are huge.

Whitney: You will ultimately be correct, but I think that you are just a little too 
early. Strong sales growth, $250M in cash and no debt. Its really hard to break a stock with these metrics. I like
shorting stocks that have a lot of debt and the potential for bankruptcy.

I think Wayfair is overpriced right now. One good thing about paying executives in stock is that you are paying
executives with something that is actually worth less than what they are selling it for (assuming the stock is way
overpriced). The way I am thinking of the situation - I actually think Wayfair is worth more because it is paying
executives in (overpriced) stock instead of cash.

How does the author look at the company now in 2016? I still see ridiculous amounts of insider selling by the
executives. It's quite unbelievable actually.
