Important  Information  Regarding  DoubleLine’s  Investment  Style 
DoubleLine seeks to maximize investment results consistent with our interpretation of client guidelines and investment mandate. While DoubleLine seeks to 
maximize returns for our clients consistent with guidelines, DoubleLine cannot guarantee that DoubleLine will outperform a client's specified benchmark. 
Additionally, the nature of portfolio diversification implies that certain holdings and sectors in a client's portfolio may be rising in price while others are falling; or, 
that some issues and sectors are outperforming while others are underperforming. Such out or underperformance can be the result of many factors, such as but 
not limited to duration/interest rate exposure, yield curve exposure, bond sector exposure, or news or rumors specific to a single name. 
DoubleLine  is  an  active  manager  and  will  adjust  the  composition  of  client’s  portfolios  consistent  with  our  investment  team’s  judgment concerning market 
conditions and any particular security. The construction of DoubleLine portfolios may differ substantially from the construction of any of a variety of bond market 
indices. As such, a DoubleLine portfolio has the potential to underperform or outperform a bond market index. Since markets can remain inefficiently priced for 
long  periods,  DoubleLine’s  performance  is  properly  assessed  over  a  full  multi-year market cycle. 
 
Important Information Regarding Client Responsibilities 
Clients are requested to carefully review all portfolio holdings and strategies, including by comparing the custodial statement to any statements received from 
DoubleLine. Clients should  promptly inform DoubleLine of any potential or perceived policy or guideline inconsistencies. In particular, DoubleLine understands 
that guideline enabling language is subject to interpretation and DoubleLine strongly encourages clients to express any contrasting interpretation as soon as 
practical.  Clients  are  also  requested  to  notify  DoubleLine  of  any  updates  to  Client’s  organization,  such  as  (but  not  limited  to) adding affiliates (including broker 
dealer  affiliates),  issuing  additional  securities,  name  changes,  mergers  or  other  alterations  to  Client’s  legal  structure.
