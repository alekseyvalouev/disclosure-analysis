Eros: Is The Game Finally Over? We Think So
Nov. 13, 2015 12:29 PM ET88 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


Management avoided releasing a movie list until the stock dropped 30%. They
provided a list of distributed films that had fewer films on it than they have previously
publicly disclosed.


34 films, or 26% of the films in management’s list, were theatrically released prior to
the fiscal year indicated. One additional film has yet to be released.


Based on public data sources, Eros appears to have overstated theatrical revenues
by at least 116% and 49% during the fiscal years 2015 and 2014.


We now believe there is irrefutable evidence that the company’s theatrical revenues
are substantially below what it has reported.


Eros released a statement and a film list yesterday in response to repeated investor
questions. We believe that the film list definitively proves that Eros has been misleading
investors. We believe, now more so than ever, that the company is a scam and that the
equity is worthless.


Brief Background to the Eros Saga


On October 30th and November 10th, we published articles on Eros International PLC
(NYSE:EROS) ("Eros"). In our most recent article, we attempted to verify the 134 films the
company claims to have released in fiscal years 2015 and 2014 in its 20-F filed with the
SEC (Source, see page 34).

Unfortunately, despite our detailed work, we were unable to verify the company's claims
that it had distributed 134 films. Indeed, our work suggested that the company had grossly
overstated its film count. Subsequently, we challenged the company in our last article to
publish the list of all 134 movies it claims to have released in its two most recent fiscal
years. We also challenged the company to release revenues by film. At the Wells Fargo
2015 Technology, Media & Telecom Conference on November 11th, an attendee was
actually thrown out of the Eros presentation after asking the company to release its
movies.


Yesterday, November 12th, following repeated inquiries from investors, Eros released "an
exhaustive list of films released in the [fiscal] year [2015 and 2014]. It includes global
films, overseas-only films, films with all rights as well as films with specific rights across
the various languages. All films may not have been released theatrically." (Source, see
latest releases tab). In addition, we used the WaybackMachine to archive this data should
it ever be taken down (Source). Should the need arise, we also have screenshots of the
movies named by Eros.


EROS' Film List Proves It has Overstated Film Counts


Obviously, at this point, we believe that everything released by the company needs to be
verified. As a first step to verifying the company's claim that it had released a list of its
movies, we counted the movies now disclosed on the company's website. Eros only
published 64 and 68 movies for fiscal years ending 2015 and 2014, respectively.
This is one less for each fiscal year than the numbers reported in its 20-F financials.
This discrepancy should be immediately concerning to investors. Furthermore, we
checked each individual movie to verify the actual release date. For the list of sixty-four

movies that Eros claims it distributed in fiscal year 2015, twenty of them were
actually not released during fiscal year 2015, according to independent, public
sources. In other words, the company has misled investors by putting old movies onto its
list of films it released.

Four Two Ka One:


According to Box Office India, Four Two Ka One was released on May 10, 2013 (Source),
which is during fiscal year 2014, not fiscal year 2015.


Amazingly, ErosNow also identifies Four Two Ka One as a 2013 film (Source).
Nonetheless, Eros includes this film in its list of movies released during fiscal year 2015.

It's Rocking: Dard-E-Disco:


According to IMDb, It's Rocking: Dard-E-Disco was released on November 9, 2012
(Source) and was, therefore, a fiscal year 2013 film, not a fiscal year 2015 film as claimed
by Eros:

Listen Amaya:


Similar to the previous two films, Listen Amaya was not released during fiscal year 2015
as Eros claims. The release date according to IMDb is February 1, 2013, which is part of
fiscal year 2013 (Source).

If investors would like to verify our work, we fully encourage them to search the internet for
any or all of the other twenty films that we have identified as falling outside of fiscal year
2015, but which the company has claimed were distributed during fiscal year 2015.
Further, there are many instances where Eros does not appear to be the distributor. For
example, JAI Viatra Entertainment appears to be the distributor for Bazaar e Husn, Munna
Mange Memsaab, Riyasat, and Tum Ho Yaara. However, we give Eros the benefit of the
doubt that it was the distributor for these movies or had a role in the distribution of these
movies and allocated the distributor revenues to Eros when calculating its theatrical
revenue (as discussed later in this article).


We repeated this same exercise with Eros' fiscal year 2014. Eros published a list of 68
films as compared to the reported 69 films stated in its 20-F. Of these 68 films, 15
were not released during fiscal year 2014 according to third party sources.

Similar to fiscal year 2015, we have provided a few examples of the discrepancies below.

Ab Hoga Dharna Unlimited:


Eros claims Ab Hoga Dharna Unlimited was released during fiscal year 2014. This is not
the case. According to IMDb, the release date is April 13, 2012, which is part of fiscal year
2013 (Source).


Box Office India corroborates with the IMDb release date of April 13, 2012 (Source).


Similarly, ErosNow identifies Ab Hoga Dharna Unlimited as a 2012 release, not fiscal year
2014 (Source).

The Bong Connection:


Interestingly, we found a review by Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India for The Bong
Connection dated as of July 7, 2007 (Source). Thus, the movie could not have been
released during fiscal year 2014.

Another review site, Rotten Tomatoes, has The Bong Connection listed as a 2006 release
(Source).


Furthermore, IMDb states that The Bong Connection was released during November 2006
(Source).

Finally, ErosNow also had The Bong Connection on its website (Source). Interestingly, it
listed 2007 as its release date. Whether the film was released in 2006 or 2007 is a moot
point to us, as it is clear the film was not released anywhere close to fiscal year 2013.


Additionally, here is a zoomed-in screenshot from ErosNow for the movie The Bong
Connection:

Jeet Lengey Jahaan is another movie Eros claims was released during fiscal year 2014.
However, according to Bollywood Hungama, the movie was released November 23, 2012,
which is part of fiscal year 2013 (Source).

While management backed away from our second challenge and did not publish revenue
by film, we updated our revenue analysis based on the forty-four films that were in
theaters during fiscal year 2015. Based on public data sources, Eros appears to have
overstated its fiscal 2015 theatrical revenues by approximately 116%. Eros claims
that it generated $123 million of theatrical revenue during fiscal 2015, but based
upon publicly available sources we calculate that the actual theatrical revenue was
only $57 million.

Our updated 2015 revenue estimate is actually slightly lower than our last estimate.
Nonetheless, we feel like we are still being generous with our assumptions. According to
Eros's 20-F, it has global distribution rights for only six of its Tamil/Telugu films. We weren't
able to identify all of the Tamil/Telugu films with international distribution rights only, so we
gave them full, worldwide credit for nine Tamil/Telugu films. These nine include Eros's
three largest Tamil films released during fiscal year 2015. Again, we gave Eros full credit
for Kochadaiiyaan, as we could not find a source that precisely divides the film's revenues
between its Hindi and Tamil versions. This movie was a Tamil blockbuster, but Eros only
participated in the less lucrative Hindi release.


Additionally, our Tamil/Telugu revenue estimate is actually 85% higher than our Hindi
revenue figure. This is notable for a few reasons. First, there are 23 Hindi movies
compared to 19 Tamil/Telugu movies, so the difference is larger on a per film basis.
Second, we would expect Hindi movies to be more profitable as they have a larger
potential audience. Lastly, revenue from Tamil films is not tracked well and our research
has indicated that there is frequently revenue exaggeration for Tamil films (Source). Thus,
one could reasonably haircut this figure. We did not.


Our updated 2014 revenue estimate of $72 million shows that Eros's reported revenue of
$108 million is overstated by 49%. While we increased our prior estimate, the
overstatement by the company is still enormous. In addition, $6.5 million, or 50%, of the
increase in our estimate comes from a generous assumption that Eros was the sole
distributor for many of the films even though competitors are listed as the distributor
and/or there are no sources that independently validate that any of these films have ever
been released theatrically.

We are also attributing $3 million in revenue to Eros for twelve films that Eros claimed to
"release" during fiscal 2014. However, we were unable to find any verifiable data. Box
Office India tracked data on Golmaal in White House, a film that only had 6,400 total
viewers. Eros earned a whopping $1,657. With no mention of these twelve films anywhere
on the Internet, we doubt that the films earned anywhere close to $3 million for Eros.


For the nineteen films that we hadn't included in our original analysis, but for which box
office data was available, two were distributed by Eros and six were distributed by
Ayngaran. The other eleven additional films often have distributor data available, but Eros
or its subsidiaries are unsurprisingly not listed. We generously assumed Eros had
worldwide distribution rights for four of those films where no distributor is mentioned, and
the international distribution rights for seven where competitors are listed as distributors.
This added $3.5 million to our revenue estimate. If anything, we think that our estimates
are generous to the company.


We believe incontrovertible proof now exists that Eros has significantly overstated its
revenues. In total, we believe that theatrical revenues for fiscal year 2015 revenues were
overstated by at least 116% and theatrical revenues for fiscal year 2014 revenues were
overstated by at least 49%.


Conclusion


Every aspect of Eros we have investigated has revealed serious red flags. A brief review
of these red flags includes:


Movie Count - The company provided a list of 64 and 68 movies for fiscal 2015 and
2014 respectively, 1 less than its regulatory filings for each year. 26% of these films
were theatrically released prior to the fiscal year indicated.
Revenue - Fiscal 2015 revenue is overstated by 116%. Fiscal 2014 revenue is
overstated by 49%.
Revenue - Television Syndication and Digital Ancillary Revenue implies a ~40%
market share compared to a 15-19% market share based on theatrical revenues and
single-digit market share based on theatrical revenues from third-party sources.
Aggressive Accounting - The company changed its amortization period from 5 years
to 10 which inflated operating profit by 172% during fiscal 2015. DSOs have steadily

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3683816-eros-game-finally-think 27/48


increased from 139 days in fiscal 2012 to 192 days in fiscal 2014. Since then, DSOs
have rocketed to 280 as of June 30, 2015.
Capital spending - There has been no credible explanation for the $100 million
increase in capital spending during fiscal 2015. The additional information provided by
the company today, namely that 26% of the films that they purchased were purchased
post-theatrical release, makes the $276 million in investment during fiscal 2015 even
more incredulous.
CFO resignations - CFO of Eros PLC resigned May 2015 and CFO of Eros
International Media resigned November 2014.
Subsidiaries - The foreign subsidiaries are fueling the revenue growth, but the
reported revenues are not being collected, resulting in massive growth in receivables.
At one subsidiary, this receivable increase surpasses revenues for the period, an
accounting impossibility. More than 100% of revenue growth is being earned in the
UAE.
Auditor - The company hides behind Grand Thornton as the auditor. However, small
auditors audit the questionable foreign subsidiaries. Anil Jagetiy & Co. resigned as
auditor of Eros Digital Private Ltd. and also audited many of the most important foreign
subsidiaries. This firm uses a gmail address, has no website, and appears to have only
one or two employees.
ErosNow - Eros' claims to have a 3,000+ library. This is in stark contrast to the 1,162
films actually available on ErosNow.
ErosNow - Management now claims that they hope to get a few million paid
subscribers over the next 3-5 years and that it will contribute meaningfully over the
long term. This is a big pullback from its $1.2 billion three-year goal discussed at the
FBR Digital Media Conference on October 8, 2015.
Related party transactions - The company has engaged in numerous related party
transactions of dubious value. One particularly galling example is Next Gen receiving
9%, 14% and 13% of Eros's capital spending during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and
2013, respectively. Next Gen is 99% owned by an executive's mother and has no
employees.


We believe that Eros has provided us the definitive proof that the company's financial
statements are not what they claim to be. The company produced a list of films that does
not match in number what it claimed to have distributed. And when we audited the list film
by film, we discovered that 26% of the films listed had been released in years preceding
the fiscal year indicated by the company claims. Eros even included one film that has not
yet even been released to theaters and therefore would count to fiscal year 2016 results.
We then researched the company's theatrical revenues for the films it claims to have

distributed in each fiscal year, omitting from the estimate though those films that we
determined were released in other fiscal years. This analysis leads us to believe that the
company has overstated its revenues in fiscal year 2015 by 116% and in fiscal year 2014
by 49%.


This is the third installment of our investigations into Eros. The red flags that we originally
identified continue to exist, but since we started peeling this onion each layer reveals more
and more troubling red flags. Investors should be very concerned. As a next step, we will
be writing to the company's auditors and the enforcement division of the SEC. Recall that
the last time we did this, on UniPixel (NASDAQ:UNXL), the company ultimately received
an enforcement action and its stock has declined 96% since our first article. We expect
Eros' stock will decline by as much or more. We believe the stock is worthless.

still some value even if the company had to change management and restate financials because they still would have
some revenue and operating income

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3683816-eros-game-finally-think 29/48


Look at EROS balance sheet. Majority of the assets are a/c receivables (are they real or fictitious?) and
intangibles (much of it purchased in various shady related-party transactions involving family members).
However, EROS liabilities including debt, which is three times its cash at hand, is quite REAL. So, how much
equity does EROS actually have? No one knows, I guess, due to all the above red flags.


Someone had posted a picture showing that EROS bonds are trading at 33 cents to $1. If that is true, **bond-
holders** are panicking. I wonder how any equity holders, who will truly get $0 in any bankruptcy, are still able
to remain smug!

As I say below, the bond holder group is purely retail-based investor in the UK. They are panicking just like
equity holders - there's almost a feedback loop between the equity and bond price reaction. I'd posit that the
bond presents a much better risk-reward opportunity here than the equity.


With respect to the A/R size - I think if you compare Eros India's latest DSO it is in fact lower than the other
Indian publicly listed distributor Shemaroo (presentation on their IR site). I cannot comment on whether there
is something untoward going on; I can only say that what Eros is showing is not out of kilter compared to
other industry players.


Intangible assets - that's the nature of rights they acquire when the buy / co-produce movies: it's the book
value of the annuity stream they expect to generate over time - that's fundamentally their business; they do
not make "tangible" widgets.


Debt - if you believe their EBITDA figure, leverage is pretty modest in fact by industry standards. Goes 
back to my comment that the bond is a much superior risk-reward opportunity here.

Alpha exposure say there are only 64 films released in the year ended March 2015 but the Eros website has
65. They missing one is "action Jackson". I've googled it an it looks like it flopped but was definitely released
in 14/15. alpha exposure have simply missed it off their list. If the contributor can't tally up a list of films I think
there is a serious question over their credibility...

Please read this Illuminating Article by an Indian analyst covering Media on mistakes by Alpha: 
the revenue analysis AE has done belies a lack of very basic understanding of Indian Film Market particulalry
theatrical revenue part. The Indian theatre market, unlike the west, is substantially unorganized. Of the 9K
screens, 7K are unorganized single screens (majority in Tamil/Telugu markets) and only 2K are organized
multiplex screens (majority in Hindi markets). Now the overall gross box office and distributor share numbers
AE has calculated (Its calculated since some of the source websites often give only the gross/nett box office,
not the distributor share) imply distributor share/gross box office collections of around 1/3rd around 35%. If we

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3683816-eros-game-finally-think 30/48


were talking only about Hindi films and multiplexes, this would be correct (Consumer ARPU = 100 - back out
20-25% E-tax - back out 55-60% multiplex chain share and Eros gets around 30-35% of the gross BO).
However, single screens and Tamil/Telugu films work differently. Firstly, E-tax rate for regional films in their
major markets is nil. Second, Eros being a large player (15-20 large/mid-budget releases annually) has
negotiating power. So their revenue share from single screens is 55%. As an example, I am providing the link
to a Telugu film trade website that provides both gross BO and distributor shares (an Eros film) - distributor
share is more than 50% of gross BO collections of a film. Make the adjustment in Hindi (distributor share at
40% of gross BO) and Tamil/Telugu films (distributor share at more than50% of gross BO) and FY14 at least
should be fine. 
Guys: Similarly we can find our FY 15..So revenue overstated argument is not valid and about Movie list
already Alpha exposure has been proved wrong.

EROS is not worthless as of today but actions against the company will make it worthless in a couple of months
unless a serious change management and transparency happens both in investor relations and daily operations. I see
it Flirting at $10 in near term. If they can defend themselves from all charges it will fly past 10 and if not, it will dive in
the 5s and stay there for months. Regardless of the move it makes after this saga, EROS will be flat at the price it
settles for months to come until something huge happens such as management change but then that will be difficult
since it looks like a family business with lots of personal ties and profiting. Another red flag for investors. CEO making
his daughter the CEO of the digital division. Sad but movie industry demands the need for continuous re-invention
and I don't know how short sighted the management is...No business is ever linear. exponential growth is healthier
and they will learn this the hard way unfortunatley. I dont have a position in EROS. I just think the company would still
have a linear progression if they reported actual # of films without inflating their numbers. Finally, if they are found
guilty of all charges and it is looking more and more likley, the debt will bring this company back to ZERO.

Another issue! The author seems to know all about the Eros movie list, but forgot to put the following note:


"The above is an exhaustive list of films released in the year. It includes global films, overseas only films, films with all
rights as well as films with specific rights across the various languages. All films may not have been released
theatrically. 
Some of the above films are low budget films which may or may not have been theatrically released before and if so it
may have just released in a few single screens in India but a vast majority of them would be new unexploited films.
When we buy these films we typically buy long term all rights worldwide and for the purposes of the electronic rights
such as satellite television, DVD or other digital rights, these films would be a premiere when we bought them. So we
treat them as a new release in that year of purchase. Notwithstanding these are small films and not very valuable in
terms of cost or revenue compared to the high and medium budget films"


This one quotation from the companies site invalidates this whole entire argument. The author is not including all the
facts in this article. Seeking Alpha is a site for validated points, not for biased one-sided agendas.

I believed the author when he questioned UAE revenue but this latest article is totally wrong. So I am
doubting their other 2 articles too. 
Here is the reason. 
The recent purchase are considered new releases as far as EROS is concerned. (May be in future Eros
should create another category - recent purchases.) Also, these purchases are not valuable in terms of cost
or revenue. Author has not given any example of high/medium budget film.

The list that this author is using to show a supposed comparison between movie titles and their releases is
contradicted by a statement inside the article itself!


"10 May 2013" - Four Two Ka One


Yet on the list made by this author, he/she has put 12/7/2012. 
The author seems to be attacking a company with invalid facts and incorrect math. 
Also, the author is using facts like a drunk man uses a lamppost, for support rather than illumination. 
The author keeps saying "Fiscal Year 2014" and "Fiscal Year 2015" but never DEFINED EROS'S OWN FISCAL
YEAR.

Company said in its Nov. 12 statement "As of September 2015, based on Rentrak data Eros’ market share in the UK
this year is an impressive 68% with a four year average of 44%, and market share in USA is 73% as of September
2015 with a 38% four year average. In addition, this information is reported in all of the Company’s presentations and
the investor day decks which can be validated by anyone independently which gives a credible benchmark for
theatrically released films". So perhaps you are underestimating the market share and revenues?

Is the author suggesting an attendee was thrown out of a high profile conference in New York, which is most likely
being recorded? So how did this play out, an attendee asks a question, the CEO / CFO refuse to answer and instead
throw him out? And this news is no where to be found, except on seekingalpha. Folks, please enlighten me if I got
anything wrong here..


"As part of the NYSE IPO process in November 2013, the Company's entire film library, and not just the new release
slate tables, went through full due diligence in which each and every agreement was vetted. This same process was
repeated for the follow-on equity offering in July 2014. Every year when the Company files its Form 20F, the Company
and its auditors review the entire slate for that particular year. Further, the Company has never claimed to produce all
the films it releases. The Company’s disclosures clearly demonstrate that it co-produces or acquires films for
distribution. All these filings are available on the SEC's EDGAR database as well as on the Company's website."

Your claim “Fiscal 2015 revenue is overstated by 116%. Fiscal 2014 revenue is overstated by 49%.” is based on less
than meticulous analysis. 
First your claim pertains to “Theatrical revenue” not overall reported revenue. Theatrical revenue comprises around
50% of total revenue. Second, company’s press release states “As of September 2015, based on Rentrak data Eros’
market share in the UK this year is an impressive 68% with a four year average of 44%, and market share in USA is
73% as of September 2015 with a 38% four year average”. Those are big, verifiable numbers as against the numbers

you use which are just estimates from ad-based websites. US/UK have low entertainment taxes, so distributor share
of gross is higher than in India. India’s high entertainment tax is a strong reason for theater owners, especially single
screen theater owners, to ‘under-report’ revenues. Note that majority of theaters in India still belong to this category.
Finally, company has repeatedly said that they pre-sell distribution rights in certain zones to sub distributors or theater
owners for a pre-committed price which they book as revenue upon movie’s release. So again, box-office collections
alone do not reflect the entire picture. Overall, I think there is a reasonable chance you are grossly underestimating
the actual revenue attributable to EROS from theatrical releases.


13 Nov 2015, 02:45 PM


Ankurj
Your claim: "Revenue - Television Syndication and Digital Ancillary Revenue implies a ~40% market share compared
to a 15-19% market share based on theatrical revenues and single-digit market share based on theatrical revenues
from third-party sources."


First, the KPMG report you cited only includes ‘domestic’ TV syndication/Digital Ancillary revenues – not the overseas
revenues from these sources. EROS started as an overseas distributor of films and almost single handedly built this
revenue stream for the entire industry. They distribute content to 50 countries in 25 different languages. Based on my
estimates, company reported around $100mn total revenue in this category in fiscal 2015, including from overseas
sources which itself contributed roughly half of this. If they are earnings $50mn in TV/Digital/Ancillary in India, that’s
only 12% market share not 40% as you claim. In addition the company has said that roughly $60mn (~20% of overall
revenue) comes from library monetization, which is movies released in prior year, not the reporting year. You included
this segment also in your '40% market share'. KPMG report does account for this source of revenue at all as their
focus is on 'movie makers' and films produced in any given year - not prior years. Anyone reading your analysis
should read the KPMG report before reaching any conclusions: http://bit.ly/1WWZGwx

No one in the industry has the sort of library that they do. As such it is a unique asset should be valued accordingly.
Further, the company is generating 20-25% of annual revenue from the library, so even if amortization schedule is

Hopefully they will release good results early next week.

"Alpha Exposure" - Please count the number of Movies listed on the company website and update your commentary.
the company is right. I would recommend usind the Excel "count" function.


Also - The Movies that you list as pre fiscal year 2014/2015 releases - i watched most of their trailers on youtube.
These were not originally Eros movies. Eros purchased them from then producer in the fiscal year 2014/2015 and
hence count as an Eros "release" for that year. The company has this in the disclosures as well. Strange you did not
pick that up as well. Please update article.


Also - not one of these movies were a big money makers. Eros probably bought them for peanuts, but can show them
for free on Eros Now. Netflix does that too. you need these movies for cushioning - cannot keep just keep running
"box office Hits" alone - the company would go bankrupt.


Also - can someone with a legal background advice me on the following: Given the misrepresentations and fallacies
presented by "alpha exposure" in these articles, can Eros shareholders seek legal action against them for MtM loss
compensation?

Yes. In the forum SA setup for authors there are a couple of threads that cover this. Eros can press charges, I
can't say for sure if owners of the equity can do it though. If one can prove securities fraud and material loss I
believe it is certainly possible - especially given that there are legal firms crediting the recent price swings to
this author. I would happily join such an endeavor.

It is very interesting to watch how the stock market reacts to the articles written by the authors with vested interests.
Next to these authors, there are law firms waiting to add salt to the wound in the name of protecting investors, ah!
Trader and Investor communities fall to these traps more often than not and some of these traders/investors might go
bankrupt before the truth surfaces itself. Talking about 'truth' here, one has to question who is more trustworthy
between this author and EROS. From the comments and rebuttals above, this appears to be an issue of possible
misinterpretation of the Fiscal Year, SEC filings, Auditor's Report, and Library listing of EROS by this author. I don't
understand why one should trust this author who self proclaims to have vested interest (by going short on EROS
stock) in tarnishing the image of EROS. It is so pathetic that other media sites also quote this Seeking Alpha article as
an authoritative source to believe EROS as a fraudulent company. Is it the Auditor who is more qualified to vet the

Eros should create a new category recent purchases of old release. That would solve the issue. This has nothing to
do with fraud or dollar amounts. It is just how they categorize it. Categorizing new purchases as new release is
misleading but not as big a deal as the article is describing.


I bought a house build in 1950. For me it is a new addition to my portfolio. I would classify as new listing when i put it
on rent. This will affect my tax return for 2015 and not 1950.

5/18/2018 Eros: Is The Game Finally Over? We Think So - Eros International Plc (NYSE:EROS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3683816-eros-game-finally-think 39/48


EROS is the Queen of Bollywood, and I'm looking for a newly created entry point (thank you) to supplement the
shares I already own.


Having some fundamental understanding of how business in India is conducted and how the movie industry there
works I must say that I have complete faith in the company leadership, the company structure, and their decisions.


Like many of the others have posted in response to your charges I certainly hope the ax you decided to swing goes
both ways. There are a good number of ambulance chasing firms your articles have incited to investigate EROS and
they nearly all mention you alphaexposure; in fact they quote you and credit your articles with the changes in price.
There is always the off chance that I am wrong, you are correct, and I could lose money on this investment; but, I
doubt it - EROS has too much going for it and I usually have a little more foresight.


Even though I prefer companies I invest in don't spend resources on situations like the one you have caused I fear
you may have forced their hand. If, when the dust settles, all of your allegations are proven incorrect I hope the dance
continues into one that at least makes you think twice about publishing. It isn't unheard of...

As mentioned earlier by TheNoLossGuy, the amateurish mistakes of the self proclaimed moral cleanser 'Alpha
Exposure' are reiterated here: 
1. Alpha Exposure so conveniently counted the number of films wrong by 1 in his tearing hurry to tear up the stock (as
if there exists significant scope to further tear). Can such a simple arithmetic mistake go pardoned after such a ruckus
been created by him involving immeasurable financial misery to many. He couldn't simply count 65 numbers clearly
mentioned in the Eros website for FY2015 and similarly 69 for FY2014. The world deserves an apology on this simple
but grave error.


2. All the movies mentioned as belonging to some other years have not been produced, co-produced and originally
distributed by Eros.  
To take 2 movies from your list as examples:  
a. Movie Four Two Ka One was produced by Sunil Shah and Distributed by Manoj Nandwana of Jai Viratra
Entertainment LTD & Rais Khan of Jannat Films in May 2013.  
b. Movie Listen Amaya was produced by Ashok Sawhney and Distributed by Turtle on a Hammock Films in Feb 2013.
In the above movies there was no original Eros connection. Eros clearly states in its notes to the movie list the
following: 
"Some of the above films are low budget films which may or may not have been theatrically released before and if so
it may have just released in a few single screens in India but a vast majority of them would be new unexploited films.
When we buy these films we typically buy long term all rights worldwide and for the purposes of the electronic rights
such as satellite television, DVD or other digital rights, these films would be a premiere when we bought them. So we

treat them as a new release in that year of purchase. Notwithstanding these are small films and not very valuable in
terms of cost or revenue compared to the high and medium budget films"


All the movies you have selected are low budget movies which would have been purchased by Eros at stealing rates
if their performances were poor and distributed thru its own mediums not necessarily theatres to be categorised as
releases for Eros. They are not material in financial terms while they may be relevant in strategic terms to explore
potential of its new mediums or to explore newer regional markets where they don't have a presence. A case in point
is their recent entry into newer regions like Kerala, Punjab etc where they could tap an existing catalogue to explore
thru its channels. 
The above conclusion by Alpha Exposure is thus gravely wrong and implies serious repercussions under the eyes of
law. Moreover, he cant expect an organization to commit a mistake as simple as he did with the counting of movies for
both the years and report releases which they have not.


3. All the revenue estimates of Alpha Exposure are based on market sources and 'estimates' involving subjectivity to
the maximum and to suit the shorts views. Do we believe these subjective figures from a biased person or believe in
the audit of a reputed firm like Grant Thornton. It is a call left for the viewers to take.


'Alpha Exposure' needs to be exposed for the right reasons and serious actions need to be taken against this riot.

The previous CFO Andrew Heffernan's parting words were as follows: 
Mr. Heffernan commented “During my time with Eros, the company has experienced significant growth in revenues
and its film slate and the launch of its digital distribution platform. I look forward to the company continuing to
capitalize on its potential to expand further in one of the fastest growing media markets in the world.”  
The new group CFO's background is as follows: 
Mr. Parameswaran most recently served as the Global Head of Media and Telecommunications Investment Banking
at Jefferies LLC. Prior to Jefferies, he was the Americas Head of Media & Telecom at Deutsche Bank and also
previously worked at both Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers.


Do CFO's have an obligation to stick to the company they work with till they reach their graves? Can this be brought
as a point by the destructive Alpha Exposure for defending his position? We wouldn't have gone to this extent of nitty
gritty but for the reckless reporting by this 'market farce'

If you consider your own facts of Fiscal Year 2015 Movies, then there are 8 movies which you have crosses as not
fallin in Fiscal year 2015 - should be addesd in Fiscal year 2014 - have you missed it by mistake like EROS or some
other intention...Pls check


Those 8 Movies are:- 
1) Amdaavad Junction - 10/25/2013 
2) Bin Phere Free Mein Tere 5/3/2013 
3) Chor Chor Super Shor - 8/2/2013 
4) I dont Luv You - 5/17/2013 
5) Ishq Actually - 10/25/2013 
6) Its Too Much - 10/25/2013 
7) My Husband's Wife - 8/9/2013 
8) Zindagi 50-50 - 5/24/2013


If you add up these 8 movies as per your Fact-Finder sheet and add them to 2014 Release sheet - then it comes to
61 Movies (53+8=61)


Please don't be biased -is my humble suggestion.


You may be doing a good job for someone - but at the end of the day " It should be a FAIR job/work)

I'm a neutral in this debate, neither long nor short, though I did follow the company quite closely (and met with
management a couple of times) after the London listing.


Clearly alpha exposure has an agenda, but that's OK, it's openly disclosed, and no more disqualifies his analysis or
opinions than does the opposite bias of those who are long the stock. From my neutral position, it does seem rather
odd that a serious , listed company employs such unserious auditors for its overseas subsidiaries - has the company
or any poster here come up with a good explanation? The nepotism doesn't help either - a listed company can't be
run like a private Indian family business. The cash flow issues are also real and worrying - could those who are
happily long this stock say when and how they expect cash flow to catch up with reported profits?

Would Grant Thornton pass the following statement in the annual report without checking the veracity of facts
in the subsidiaries:


"In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Eros International PLC and 'subsidiaries' as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2015, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board." 
/s/ Grant Thornton India LLP 
Note the word 'subsidiary' above.


As to your second question, the company has targeted to become cash flow positive at the end of this fiscal ie
FY16. Aren't there innumerable ecommerce/internet companies globally with net losses on top of negative
operating cash flows at astronomical valuations for us to be deliberating on a company generating operating
and net profits (operational).

I don't own shares in this company yet, but, I will be adding it soon potentially. So, here are my 2 cents. There
are not many parallels to draw from to say conclusively whether or not EROS is lagging in collecting the
revenue booked in a specific time period. That's because the nature of each business is different and EROS
should, by all means, demonstrate its efforts, ability, and confidence in collecting those dues. Same goes for
whether the revenue booked is overstated or accurate.  
That being said, I take strong exception to the prophecy of Alpha Exposure that EROS would go down to $0.
That's because, 
The founder & Executive Chairman of the company has built this business ground up and in this business for
more than 3 decades already. They have already made operational a Netflix like global delivery platform for

Not sure if you are familiar with the Indian work culture here in the states. I feel its the same mentality they
use to hire cheap labor overseas applies here in their accounting. I am sure there are better accounting firms
with no gmail address in India but they will go with cheap or well connected ones.


I am a developer myself and I have to say they cheat in code too but since not everyone can understand
codes, they often get a pass here. When we audit their codes, we find a whole lots of issues. Well, math is a
language everyone understands and its going to be hard to get out of this...


I will still add a small long position regardless of my bearish sentiment on Monday for potential near term
bounce. If they correct their mistakes, I will continue to add.

Grant Thornton did the same with Globo no? 
Globo subsequently turned out to be a fraud.


15 Nov 2015, 07:58 PM


41982106
For every Globo there may be several hundreds including fortune companies which may be having clean and
creditable accounts & audited by Grant Thornton. For no simple reasons are the big audit firms where they
are, there are a lot of creditable & diligent practises which go on consistently over many years to earn their
place in the haloed group. There could be mistakes by anybody & you don't crucify them recklessly for the
wrong reasons. It's easy to be part of a vicious revelry as the ever suspicious world leans onto negative
initiations quite easily. The important point here is to study the points raised by AE & check whether there are
any gross mistakes in the arguments especially when he has a short position in Eros & would tend to benefit
immensely. He would have already made a killing but when there arise questions counter to his arguments,
the ego tends to get hurt & the arguments get into the zone of getting personal. 
AE started off with his initial elaborate report with no material mention of theatrical revenues. He went on a
binge on an unheard of subsidiary auditor without a single mention of Grant Thornton. When pointed out on
the fallacies in his report by people here, he went on a binge on over reporting theatrical revenues by Eros,
insinuating prior year releases being added up to bloat the numbers. HERE HE DIDNT LOOK AT THE NOTE
IN EROS FILM LIST WHICH CLEARLY INDICATES THE SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION OF THESE FILMS
WHEREBY THEY BECOME RELEASES FOR EROS THEN. 
HE MISCALCULATED THE NUMBER OF MOVIES BY 1 AND IS YET TO APOLOGISE ON THIS ERROR
WHICH THOUGH SMALL IN A RUNNING DOWNHILL GRAVY TRAIN ASSUMES DRACONIAN

He insinuates fraud due to a suspicion being raised by a CFO resigning in 2015. HE DELIBERATELY
OVERLOOKS THIS CFO HAS SPENT AROUND 9 YEARS IN EROS & HAS LEFT APPRECIATIVE

When you find several arguments to suit ones prejudiced position & contains flaws at such basic levels, it's

personal vendetta in the later stages.

Forget incontrovertible proof, the revenue analysis AE has done belies a lack of very basic understanding of the
Indian film market. Since I am a media analyst in India and used to track Eros India stock till FY14, let me illuminate.
Take note that my issue is not with the entire analysis (some of which I agree with) but the theatrical revenue part.
The Indian theater market, unlike the west, is substantially unorganized. Of the 9K screens, 7K are unorganized
single screens (majority in Tamil/Telugu markets) and only 2K are organized multiplex screens (majority in Hindi
markets). Now the overall gross box office and distributor share numbers AE has calculated (I say calculated since I
have seen some of the source websites and more often they give only the gross/nett box office, not the distributor
share) imply distributor share/gross box office collections of around 1/3rd = ~35%. If we were talking only about Hindi
films and multiplexes, this would be correct (Consumer ARPU = 100 - back out 20-25% E-tax - back out 55-60%
multiplex chain share and Eros gets around 30-35% of the gross BO). However, single screens and Tamil/Telugu films
work differently. Firstly, E-tax rate for regional films in their major markets is nil. Second, Eros being a large player (15-

20 large/mid-budget releases annually) has negotiating power. So their revenue share from single screens is ~55%.
As an example, I am providing the link to a Telugu film trade website that provides both gross BO and distributor
shares (an Eros film) - distributor share is >50% of gross BO collections of a film. Make the adjustment in Hindi
(distributor share at 40% of gross BO) and Tamil/Telugu films (distributor share at >50% of gross BO) and FY14 at
least should be fine.

When there is a coordinated attack on a smaller & less liquid stock orchestrated with a purpose, it is quite

committed by the author. Everyone has his day in the sun. I am quite glad that one of the best law firms if not
