Angie’s List Committing Fraud on their Subscribers -- Please Sue Us 
Angie, so we can prove your fraud in court! 
 
In the last 3 months alone, the CEO of Angie’s list has sold around as much stock in dollar terms as this 
company generated in their only profitable quarter in 18 years.  Mr. Oesterle calls this a “transition year” for 
Angie’s.  Agreed.  He is transitioning your money into his pocket. 


 
Background 
In Part 1, Citron provided its analysis and opinion that Angie’s List (NASDAQ:ANGI) is not a business, but 
rather merely a stock market artifact left over from Web 1.0.   Established in 1995, Angie’s has never in its 
eighteen year history been profitable.  It is Citron’s thesis that the pre-eminent reason for the company’s 
consistent record of abject execution failure is that any website designed and built around the principle of 
“non-anonymous”, reader-contributed reviews cannot ever function as an “honest source” of referrals.    
 
 


 
 
 
Angie’s has taken gobs of Wall Street money, which it spends trying to drive topline revenue from a big 
telesales room.  It is important for investors to understand that this is not and never will be a scalable internet 
business model.  It is a lead generation business, one that neither its subscribers nor service providers receive 
long term value from.   
 
Citron has never seen an internet business with such negative user reputation on the internet.

and http://www.knaddison.com/technology/why-angies-list-sucks?page=1 
 
Meanwhile, complaints about involuntary subscriber renewals via automatic credit card charges and 
involuntary price increases go unmet and unresolved … for now …  Citron believes that once the speculative 
pixie dust settles, it will be obvious that Angie’s lead generation business model is worth no more than the 


value of HomeAdvisor … which is about $6 per share, if (and that is a huge “if”) Angie’s can 
actually insinuate itself into sustainable and real profitability, an transformation we think is highly unlikely.  
 
 
 





Today Citron expands on this opinion below, and also publishes a detailed financial critique of the company’s 
statements about how it purports to become profitable vs its published financials here.

 Lying to the Public and their own Members about the 
Nature of “Membership” Subscriptions 
 
Is this the picture of trust?

   Citron Conclusion #1:  Lying to Member Subscribers about the Ratings 
and Objectivity of Service Provider Listings and about whether the service 
providers are paying to be listed.  





How can a non-
anonymous review 


possibly be trusted to 
be objective when the 
service provider knows 


your identity, your 
address, and has been 


inside your home?   


They don’t? 
How can this 


outrageous claim be 
trusted, when in fact 
over 70% of Angie’s 
List revenues comes 
directly from service 
provider businesses? 
This is a bold-faced 


EFFIN’ LIE!

But here’s how Angie’s List represents these facts to its own members and the 
public:   
 


 
https://support.angieslist.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/46 





“Member-supported” …?   
“Grassroots chapters”…?   
“Charging service providers to appear would undermine the overall quality of 
our content”…?  


 
Finally, Angie’s List makes a statement that Citron agrees with!  Unfortunately, 
they imply they don’t charge service providers, which is the biggest lie so far!  
 


   Citron Conclusion #2:  Citron calls upon Angie’s List to Stop Lying on 
its website about being “member Supported” and not charging Service Providers.   


“We feel that charging service providers to appear on the List would undermine the 
overall quality of our content.  Other services that charge businesses often feature 
skewed results that don’t reflect consumers’ experiences. “

Meanwhile, the company continues to loudly proclaim its growth in “paid memberships”, but the numbers of such 
“paid members” is barely able to keep pace with the falling membership subscription rates.  





    Citron Conclusion #3:  Declining average subscription rates imply 
bottom of the barrel geographies, increasing numbers of free subscriptions, and 
the end of the rainbow.  


As Angie’s List becomes ever more dependent on service providers for revenues, it builds 
its subscriber base using a lot more free, discounted and very low cost subscriptions than it 
discloses.  And it is justifying higher service provider advertising fees based on its claims 
about the growing number of paid subscribers.  These claims are in severe conflict.

  New Story Shows Lunacy of Business Model 
 
In our first part we described how utterly stupid and irresponsible the Angie’s List business model is.  Just this week we 
read an article that illustrates our point perfectly 
 
http://www.azfamily.com/news/consumer/Investigations-underway-for-Sound-Creations-contractor-210647461.html 
 


Someone hires a non-licnesed contractor from Angie’s and is upset with the job.  This would not happen if in 
fact Angie’s would verify service provider licensing, which they don’t.  After being contacted by the consumer 
advocate, Angie’e decided to intervene.  What makes this recent story relevant is twofold. 
 


1. It shows how utterly unreliable their business model as their value add does not exist 
2. It proves why the company can NEVER move into an e-commerce model.  If in fact the company 


generated a significant amount of cash from selling services, than they would be a guarantor for those 
services -- something they can never do. 





Yet the CEO talks like he can just turn on a “Buy it Now” feature.   Best of luck with that!  
 
  


How are we to believe that average service provider revenue can climb sustainably at 
70% - 120% per year while average membership subscription rate is declining over a four 
year timespan, approaching half its rate of just 4 years ago?   
 
Angie’s sales pitch to service providers renewing contracts at higher rates is predicated 
on increasing number of paid subscribers.  But if large numbers of these turn out to be 
free… the service providers won’t continue to renew, and won’t pay up for 
advertisements , because their results aren’t supported by a larger and ever-more 
motivated membership.     
 
Plus large numbers of free subscribers, as well as monthly subscribers, are not even 
counted in these average revenue per subscriber figures…

     Conclusion 
 
Angie’s List CEO calls his website the “only honest broker of user reviews” on the web, but it slots its service 
provider listings based on how much they pay.  Their deceptive member renewal policies now have them in 
the crosshairs of an ominous class-action suit, which all investors should read.  
 
It is Citron’s opinion that there is nothing inherently trustworthy about the premise of a website where 
anonymous reviews can’t be posted.  Here’s just one of many news stories making our point.  
 


 
http://www.fox19.com/story/22141092/fox19-investigates-consumers-sued-for-online-reviews 





The other side of the coin, a listing of page after page of only “Grade A” reviews, in which service providers 
are jacked for “$15,000 to $50,000” for the privilege of being listed on the first-page, is not sustainable.   
 
Angie’s most recent quarter abounded with red flag indications as well.  The company noisily drew attention 
to nearly $10 million generated from operations.  But this was not a function of profits, it was a change in the 
schedule of sales force compensation – which went from paid whole at the time of contract sale, to paid 
ratably over the course of the contract.   So this “cash” is merely a one-time adjustment, not a sustainable 
cash source --  Angie’s still owes the sales people.  They simply generated a cash adjustment, and increased 
their liabilities to offset it.  This is financial sleight of hand.  
 
For a company that tells so many lies to investors, subscribers, and service providers, the irony leaves us 
shaking our heads …. And he calls profitability “A Funny Metric”.  Yikes!     
 
Behind the curtains, Angie’s receives cash up-front and recognizes that revenue over the life of the display 
contracts and subscriptions, typically one year term for service providers and subscribers.  It can manipulate 
its bottom lines temporarily by constricting expenses, such as lowering employee compensation or 
commissions.   Misleading the investing public with one-time adjustments is also a lie.   
 
It is Citron’s opinion that indications of the collapse in financial performance will appear in the next few 
quarters.  The low member renewal rate in the 70% - 75% range means a new customer doesn’t break even 
for five or six years … and it is likely that former members churned out will not return to the fold.   Meanwhile, 
annual advertising increases of 75% - 125% on service providers may have caught a one-time air pocket, but 
can’t possibly be sustainable either.  It remains Citron’s opinion that service providers will not stay around at 
high and ever-increasing display rates as further renewals won’t be cost justified, and other competitors, with 
truthfully disclosed service provider lead-generation models, gain traction.   
 
Cautious Investing to All.
