Oncothyreon: Phase III Unlikely to Show Survival Benefit
Jul. 25, 2011 10:20 AM ET111 comments
by: Martin Shkreli


Oncothyreon (NASDAQ: ONTY) has 40 million shares outstanding. At $10 per share,
ONTY’s market capitalization is $400 million. The company has $72 million in cash and $5
million in debt. The company’s main asset is an 8 – 12% royalty on a Merck KGAA
investigational drug called Stimuvax. Stimuvax is being tested in a large Phase III pivotal
clinical trial for lung cancer and the results of this study will be disclosed soon.
If the study reveals that Stimuvax fails to improve lung cancer survival, as I suspect it will,
Oncothyreon stock will drop 80% to cash value of $2 per share.     I believe there is a high
likelihood that the trial will be stopped for futility at the second interim analysis in a few
months. If not, the study will fail at the final analysis which should be about 9 months from
today. My hedge fund is short ONTY common stock and long various ONTY put options.


There are two smoking guns that support my case: first, Stimuvax is not a well-designed
drug and is likely to be inert in humans. The second is that the phase II data are not
suggestive of a benefit, and the phase III is highly unlikely to succeed. We will prove that
recent analyses speculating that the length of the trial is somehow predictive of Stimuvax
success are illegitimate and only serve to increase the risk/reward ratio for short sellers.


Mechanism of Action


Stimuvax is often referred to as a MUC1 “cancer vaccine”. The problem with this
terminology is Stimuvax is not a vaccine in any way, shape or form.   Vaccines typically
stimulate an immune response against an introduced antigen. This allows the immune
system to fight off this antigen in the future.


MUC1 is widely expressed in humans. Stimuvax is liposomal MUC1, so Stimuvax can’t be
a MUC1 vaccine because the immune system won’t know that MUC1 is an antigen to fight
off.
Without some leukopheresis/immune-training process, a-la Dendreon or a specialized
adjuvant, it is difficult to generate a vaccine to an endogenously found peptide. A MUC1
antibody or small molecule antagonist would make a lot more sense. Indeed, several
companies are attempting to improve the immune response for prospective MUC1
vaccines as well as attempting targeted payload strategies for MUC1. MUC1 is certainly a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/281421-oncothyreon-phase-iii-unlikely-to-show-survival-benefit 2/27


good marker for cancer, but it still isn’t useful. MUC1 tests are no longer used. MUC16,
which you may know better as CEA125, is widely used to determine ovarian cancer
staging and status. Antibodies, armed antibodies and vaccines to CEA125 went nowhere.


According to the NIH’s protein database, mucin 1 (MUC1) is a 1255 amino acid protein.
Stimuvax is the common repeat found in mucin 1. I wonder if the inventors assumed this
will serve as an antigen to the immune system and T cells will destroy any cell with mucin
1 expression. It doesn’t take a cell biologist to appreciate this is not a good idea given the
widespread expression of MUC1.


Furthermore, without legitimate immune response data and with no side effects, my
supposition that Stimuvax is inert is likely correct. The tandem repeat found in Stimuvax is
no different from native MUC1. While the glycosylation patterns may be different, it’s hard
to see MUC1 inducing a potent immune response. Indeed, the failure of the similar
MUC16 to generate a viable anticancer candidate bodes poorly for MUC1 and Stimuvax.


Getting back to the question of whether Stimuvax is an effective vaccine, we noticed that
only 21% of Stimuvax patients in the Phase IIB study had an immune response to
Stimuvax. Because the only way Stimuvax could have any anti-cancer effect would be
through immune recognition of the MUC1 tandem repeat, and a subsequent immune
response strong enough to destroy MUC1 expressing cells (a long shot), a 21% immune
response (forget evidence of a CR/PR) is not promising.


Most good vaccines have to have 100% immune responses or close to it. The immune
response data is uncontrolled and hazy at best. For a drug billed as a vaccine, Stimuvax
doesn’t do a great job of proving it is a vaccine. Even in a small n=22 trial that tested a
new formulation of Stimuvax, immune response results were not disclosed.


Statistical Considerations


Let’s move on to what everyone really cares about. ONTY has recently risen dramatically
because there is speculation that the START study will succeed. “START” is the Phase III
study Merck KGAA is conducting to determine if Stimuvax extends overall survival in lung
cancer. It is important for anyone trading ONTY to understand, that it is much more likely
any putative “extension” or “delay” in the combined overall survival of the START study, is
much more likely to be a result of rising survival expectations for this tumor type and a
miscalculated overall survival, than it is to be a miracle performance from Stimuvax.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/281421-oncothyreon-phase-iii-unlikely-to-show-survival-benefit 3/27


I’ve seen this movie before, and it never ends well. The long trade has a very poor
risk/reward characteristic and it is mathematically inept to assign a higher probability of
success to START because the combined median overall survival is higher than originally
expected. Unless you can perfectly estimate the control group overall survival of a new
study by looking back at literature, and taking into account the several new drugs
approved for this disease, you are making a mental assignment error of hoping you’ve
stumbled onto a free lunch when you’ve only found yourself in a game of speculative
musical chairs.


The enrollment curve that was released at ASCO has helped us determine that the
START trial is exactly on schedule. The control group should register a 33 month median
overall survival. We also think the Stimuvax arm will register a 33 month median overall
survival. This data is backed by recent clinical results (Kelly et al, Franca et al, Gadgeel et
al and Chang et al) as well as the recent innovations in lung cancer.


Again, nothing can be determined about the performance of the individual arms from the
data released thus far. We only have two data points from the trial: the enrollment curve,
and the timing of the first interim analysis. One can relatively easily impute that the
combined overall survival of the study is 33 months. It is tempting to look into the scientific
literature and see that there are some lung cancer studies with 25 months of overall
survival.


It is even more tempting to assume Stimuvax must be on track for 37 months of overall
survival given the 2:1 randomization of the study, or any other sizeable benefit. There’s a
lot of hand-waving that can be done here. Instead of retrofitting past data to speculate on
the potential clinical benefit of a drug in a new trial, investors are better served assuming
the null hypothesis that the combined median overall survival of the trial fairly represents
today’s standard of care and the investigational and control groups do not differ.


It is downright silly to assume the Stimuvax arm is outperforming the control arm without
any a priori evidence of this. As we’ll see later, the only basis for assuming Stimuvax
success is a single specious Phase II study. Stage III NSCLC is highly heterogeneous and
survival can be well in excess of the combined observed 33 months in START.


The recent advances include Avastin, Tarceva, Alimta and other drugs, as well as
improvements in radiation techniques and genetic sequencing of tumors altering treatment
paradigms render looking at past data to determine the likely performance of the control
group of START a waste of time. I posit that when all is said and done with START, the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/281421-oncothyreon-phase-iii-unlikely-to-show-survival-benefit 4/27


Kaplan-Meier curves of the two arms will be found to overlap. History tells us a cancer trial
taking longer than expected is not suggestive of a benefit. Recent examples of this include
Novelos, Genvec and Telik.


With respect to statistics, we used the publicly available data to simulate when the first
interim analysis and second interim analysis would take place in the START trial. Our work
can be found here. The trial is exactly on time. I think the drug is inert and there is a good
chance the trial will be stopped early for futility in the next few months. If not, the trial will
fail in the final analysis.
Buying ONTY is a bad idea, especially if you think the recent statistical analyses by
“biostatisticians” suggest a successful study. I recall fondly Northfield Laboratories where
we hired 10 separate biostatisticians (they’re cheap) to analyze that pivotal trial. These
folks are prone to biases and like stock-pickers, it’s hard to find good ones that are
impartial and thorough. We have learned enough about statistics in our collective
experience to dismiss the recent analyses as uninformed opinion to take advantage of.


Prior Stimuvax Data


The prior Stimuvax data is not encouraging. This data has serious flaws with a small n,
open-label nature and a large background imbalance that would have favored Stimuvax.
There is a rich history of positive phase 2 lung cancer trials failing to replicate in phase 3
(Affinitak, CPG7909, ASA404, figitumumab, Novelos and others). Subgroup analyses with
no rational basis are done to support Stimuvax efficacy. Even these subgroup analyses
don’t rise to the level of p<0.05.


Another subtle but important finding from the Phase II data is the separation of the
Kaplan-Meier curves after overlapping for 12 months. Most legitimate cancer drugs have
quick separation of K-M curve. This “late” effect can be ascribed to baseline
characteristics. Metastasis kills cancer patients. Stimuvax doesn’t seem to have an anti-
metastasis mechanism of action, but the data bears out its late effect. It’s much more likely
there was a baseline imbalance, and indeed there is substantial evidence for that.

Even if Stimuvax works, which I am positively sure it does not, the valuation of ONTY isn’t
tremendously compelling. With 60,000 applicable lung cancer patients (Stage III is rare),
30,000 on treatment at $50,000, total end-user sales of $1.5bn, a royalty to ONTY of
$150m, net profits of $100m, 10x earnings results in a $1 billion market cap for ONTY.


This is roughly a double for the stock in the best case scenario. The odds are not 50-50.
They’re more like 5%. You lose almost all of your investment if the trial fails. Most lung
cancer phase IIIs fail. Without a rationale design, reasonable phase II data or a better
reason to invest, I would walk away from ONTY or short it. Our fund is short and owns
puts.


Disclosure: We are short ONTY and may reverse, hedge, liquidate or otherwise modify
our position at any time without notifying SeekingAlpha.

So much to say, so little room.


-- Recently a three-year follow-up of the phase II study was published that showed a survival benefit for Stimuvax that
was statistically significant across the whole intent-to-treat population. Why harp on earlier subgroup analyses and not
even mention that result?


--"Even if Stimuvax works, which I am positively sure it does not..." You are committing the same sin as those who
state that they are 90% sure that it does work. Unless you have bribed doctors involved in the trial, there is no way
you can scientifically make that statement. You claim to be savvy in biostatistics, and then you make a rookie mistake.
You can make the null hypothesis, but you can't assert that it is necessary true with anything approaching certainty.


--You are making assumptions about the putative mechanism of Stimuvax (if it works) that you have no reason to
make. Are you sure that it does not affect metastasis? Are you sure that we know the true mechanism of action for
Provenge (DNDN), for that matter?


--Finally, I can't believe that Merck would have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on clinical trials if the indications
were so clear that the result was a foregone conclusion. Sure, every company makes mistakes, but such an
expensive one would not have been made lightly.


In conclusion, the situation is not nearly so black-and-white as you paint it.

I am certain Stimuvax doesn't work - my analysis represents a cohesive understanding that draws on each
aspect of the Stimuvax situation--biostatistics is only a small part of the thesis.

Wow. Terrible analysis re: statistical trials. Let's review the four trials mentioned:


1) The Kelly Trial - the last ONTY article discussed the Kelly trial and showed that it was completely irrelevant to
median OS in lung cancer due to the need to not only do CRT but also consolidation before randomization


2) The Franca trial - equally irrelevant - this had only 14 stage III luncg cancer patients in it and it focused entirely on
RESECTED patients. Resected patients live far far longer than unresectable patients because the cancer has been
cut out of them.


3) The Gadgeel trial does have a longer median OS at 34 months but this is for the treatment arm and covers only 28
patients. The longer median OS was observed in the arm receiving Alimta (pemetrexed) at the same time as CRT.
This is not the current standard of care.


4) The Chang trial only saw an improvement in median OS in patients receiving high dose proton therapy. There are
only 9 high dose proton machines in the USA and only 3 are used for lung cancer patients.


Please give some examples of large studies in Stage 3 NSCLC that show 30+ months of median OS in the control
arm. Thank you.

So basically you can't point to any evidence whatsoever that the control group will live 33 months? Your
analysis can be summed up as: "control and ONTY both live 33 months" and your supporting evidence as
"none". Please show me just one similarly designed Stage 3 NSCLC trial that has a median OS in the control
arm of 30+ months. I bet you can't give a single example.

overall survival for the START study is 33 months.


25 Jul 2011, 03:36 PM 


quincy.john
Wow, so your logic is that you assume that the control group and the treatment arm live the same and
therefore whatever the median overall survival is on a combined basis must be the same for each arm? This
is among the dumbest lines of logic I have ever heard.


25 Jul 2011, 04:13 PM 


bob52523
Your argument:


Stimuvax doesn't work. Therefore control and treatment groups will have same median survival. The
combined survival for START is 33 months, so survival for control group is 33 months and survival for
treatment group is 33 months. Since Stimuvax doesn't increase overall survival, Stimuvax doesn't work.


I guess we shouldn't be wasting time and money with drug trials. We should just ask you.

Stimuvax. The article said the future looks bright and the probability of success was great. Now just a few days
later,your article comes out, saying that success for the new drug is very slim, and the stock will drop down 80%. My
question to you is' how does an average Joe like me, who gets advice from seeking Alpha, and other online articles,

Freedom of speech does not apply from a carte blanche persepective to stock market analysis, Martin. Just
like it doesn't apply to libel and slander. There are laws.


Lucky for you, I don't think you actually broke any laws here. You're only guilty of putting forth hackneyed
logic, and any efforts to claim you did so maliciously could be defused by you merely claiming that you're a
poor analyst. This may typically be seen as a lose-lose, but seeing as no one really pays attention to the
personalities who write these things, you've got relative obscurity on your side. And the choir you're preaching
to won't care.


All of that said, the fact that your best defense of your article is "freedom of speech" and your right to say what
you like, rather than a rational explanation for why it's ok to rely on facts and talking points that have long
since been addressed both directly and via simple inference, is telling.

It sure is getting exciting with the back and forth love/hate getting even more charged. I fall into the camp that thinks
Stimuvax has a chance and might make a difference. There is very little you can do currently with advanced lung
cancer and the potential is huge. I would like to guess as to how much money his "fund" has lost up until now. My little
1,000 shares sold at 9.25 a few weeks ago from >$3.00 purchased (scaling into some options for a pop shot if it

This individual's "ignorance" regarding the mechanism of action of Stimuvax is amazing. From his discussion it's fairly
obvious that he doesn't understand the science involved, or is trying to make a quick buck off idiots, which given the
stock action and his disclosed position is more likely. If you want an intelligent description of the mechanism of action,
do a google scholar search for "L-BLP25" (stimuvax), and you will find many peer reviewed articles that describe the
mechanism. Also, if stimuvax is inert, shouldn't the immune response be 0%?


The lesson from both this article and the exuberantly bullish one, is that you should do your own research.

Author’s reply »  That's a good point. Although when I say inert, I mean inert from an anti-cancer perspective.
So the paltry immune response is still inert because there is a syllogistic loss as you try to "amplify" the
immune signal; generating an immune response is one thing, prolonging survival is another. Also note that
the immune response data was never controlled--could have just been the cyclosporin!

Wrong again. The drug you are looking to name is cyclophosphamide, which is quite different than
cyclosporin, which is an immunosuppresive agent used to control transplant rejection. Nice flip answer, but
again one should try at least a little to prove you know something, anything, without getting it dead wrong.

No one could dispute Oncothyreon had been on a fantastic run since February 2011. Only Martin Shkreli knows when
he first went short, but its likely he's upside down on his position.  
Anyone with any confidence in the short side ought to remain quiet and build their short at even higher prices. But no!
Instead Marty blogs about his view. Why? Who can know? He admits he may close out his position at any time, which
includes before reaching maximum potential gain. If he did that, he'd likely be closing out a position he wished he
never took, aka simple manipulation.

I think this is exactly what Martin wants to do: cover his short. He must have lost lot by now and can stand it.
That is why he jumped out instead of keep shorting.


Scientifically, Martin either doesn't know the action of Stimuvax or he pretend he doesn't know. All cells
express MUC1 but cancer has a different MUC1: barely glycosylated MUC1, which is different from normal
MUC1. Short stretch of MUC1 peptide from cancer cells normally is not a good antigen as vaccine. However,
with adjuvant and loads of the short peptide, you can surely generate immune response, which is where
Stimuvax comes into play.


I think Stimuvax will work. Look at DNDN's vaccine, it has the similar concerns but it does work in the end.

Seems you do indeed need a cell biologist to explain some of this you clearly don't understand. Some corrections are
noted above regarding the garbled junk you offer on CEAMUC16 and the rest of the nonsense. CEA is
carcenoembroyonic antigen and it is used for colorectal cancer, CA125 is NOT a mucin, but it is used as an aid in
ovarian cancer, and there have no vaccines or trials based on it's use as a therapeutic. unless you want to believe
that the monoclonal antibody B43.13 is such a vaccine, it is not. believe me on this one I know it well.  
However your claim that MUC1 is not used is just plain false, it is refferred to as CA27.29 (Truquant) or CA15.3, and it
is used for BrCA therapeutic management and for early diagnosis of recurrence. Gee how did you miss that.  
Maybe you missed the rest of the information about the product such as claiming it has no adjuvant. The adjuvant is
monophosphoryl Lipid A and it comes from GSK. It is GSKs best adjuvant and is being used in a number of other
products in this same arena. or perhaps you misunderstood the role of the liposomes delivery, which is what we call
fusagenic. This 'loads the peptide' into antigen presenting cells as the membranes fuse, the lipopeptide is dumped
into the APC.  
With regard to your claim of non-immunogenic you cite only the T cell proliferation numbers, not aware of the antibody
responses now are you, but ignore them at your own risk. This product is highly immunogenic and your weak
attempot at suggesting otherwise is just that, weak. 
The rest of your 'opinions' about failure etc are already well refuted by the numerous trial publications that you chose
to misinterpret or are simply not accurate descriptions of the pt populations in this study, and offer nothing valid for
comparisons.  
Finally the background check on you and your so called fund are a joke. Expecta few calls from the regs.

and a few more comments, you state 
"Another subtle but important finding from the Phase II data is the separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves after
overlapping for 12 months. Most legitimate cancer drugs have quick separation of K-M curve. This “late” effect can be
ascribed to baseline characteristics. Metastasis kills cancer patients. Stimuvax doesn’t seem to have an anti-
metastasis mechanism of action, but the data bears out its late effect." 
Take a look at the Provenge curves, this effect is exactly what happens with vaccines, as they are not cytotoxic
poisons, but rather over time build an immune response, and in this specific case the immune response is targeted to
an adhesion ligand that plays a role in metastatic spread. The role of MUC1 in metastatic spread is extremely well
documented in dozens (hundreds) of publications, but I like this one from Cancer Research 
Regimbald, L.H., et al (1996) The breast mucin MUC-1 as a novel adhesion ligand for endothelial ICAM-1 in breast
cancer. Cancer Res. 56: 4244-4249 
Now I understand that you will never understand any of this scientific background, just stop pretending you do. The
product is designed exactly to target the mechanisms of tissue adherance and vessel extravation, the fact you don't
get that is hardly an excuse for your attempt at manipulation.

I owned ONTY since the days when it was Biomira. I agree that Stimuvax may not have survival benefit based on
early Clinical trial result. This is different from DNDN which I also owned for a long time. Provenge had survival benefit
in one of the P3 trials though OS was not the primary end point. The outcome of current Stimuvax trial is
unpredictable while you had some favorable trial data to rely on for Provenge. Long or short ONTY now is a crap
shoot. I wouldn't bet my farm on either side. However, I'm hopeful about ONT-10 due to the track record of the
management.

Never said this? 
MUC1 is widely expressed in humans. Stimuvax is liposomal MUC1, so Stimuvax can’t be a MUC1 vaccine
because the immune system won’t know that MUC1 is an antigen to fight off.  
Without some leukopheresis/immune-t... process, a-la Dendreon or a specialized adjuvant, it is difficult to
generate a vaccine to an endogenously found peptide.


Seems as if you don't remember your own hit piece, but here it is "or a specialized adjuvant"


"MUC1 is certainly a good marker for cancer, but it still isn’t useful. MUC1 tests are no longer used."


From what source do you make this false statement? MUC1 tests are called CA27.29 or Ca15.3 and they are
FDA approved for 2 indications, patient therapeutic management and early diagnosis of recurrence. They are
widely used all over the world and here, I know because I developed the first of these that was approved by
FDA.

Mr. Shkreli, you're poorly informed and totally outclassed on this one. 
Remember your Avanir article of May 31st (A compelling short opportunity) where you bragged how you could
"go into great detail on intellectual property" but you said a 2004 article represented "prior art" to a patent with
a July, 2002 priority date? You also cited the wrong 2004 article. It took a few weeks but with Avanir's help
and a message board poster named Big Gain Hunter who knew something about the patent, it was shown
that you ignored the July, 2002 priority date! When your core mistake was pointed out to you, instead of
addressing it any shape or form, you carried on about some nonsense with another poster with quotes from a
movie. But (although you claimed you could go into great detail on intellectual property") you never backed
that up by commenting on your core error except to say you were not being paid to answer questions and you
were busy and to "wait in line". 
Here, you have Redplate who is the authority on the subject immediately showing you some of your glaring
mistakes and your knowledge of this subject is so obviously inadequate and your need to maintain the illusion
that you know what you are talking about is so necessary to your "persona" here that you don't even have the
intellectual basis to begin a discussion that increases your understanding. 
You obviously like TV/movie quotes so I think this airline commercial tag line might work best for you, "Want

I agree with Martin that the probability of showing success is much less than probability of failing.


(1) Stage 3A patients in this trial is a mistake since they're going to live longer. With really no data, this
decision makes no sense. Just basing it off of their open-label small study is idiotic.


(2) Red, that's post-hoc analysis, which is meaningless at this point. Everyone knows the control group here
did worse than expected. ONTY/MRK seem to have also cherry-picked patients in the Phase 3.


(3) Bulls should take heed: Transgene did the same thing using a similar drug. Ran a Phase 2 in NSCLC,
found a small subset with improved survival! Looking to go into Phase 3...


(4) I think bulls failure to disregard their previous product, Theratope, as having no bearing on their future
prospects with Stimuvax, even though it appears to follow the same logic of targeting MUC1(but via a different
pathway). "Theratope (Sialyl TN-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (STn-KLH)) vaccine incorporates a synthetic STn
antigen that mimics the unique tumor-associated STn carbohydrate on MUC1 found on breast and ovarian
cancer cells."


Why should you believe their new pathway makes more sense here or can show more efficacy?

First comment, the 3a group was the subgroup from the phase II that showed the greates advantage, it is not
the first time they have been tested. Logic tells us that earlier is better for a vaccine, and yes survival will be
longer for both treatment and controls. Your comment is false. 
second recent publication of update survival at three years is not a subgroup it is stat sig for the entire study,
surprised you haven't bothered to read it. 
the cherry picking comment doesn't deserve a response, it is a randomized largest ever trial for a vaccine in
cancer with well defined criteria for entry. The FDA likes it and thus the SPA, your comments wont have any
effect on their thinking. 
The difference between Theratope and Stimuvax are mechanisms of action (antibody vs cellular, CTL) and
target composition being sugar vs peptide. CTLs see only peptidesand the classical CTL response is the holy
grail of cancer immunology, think of a rejected transplant such as a kidney. Ever see the physical damage the
immune system does to a rejected organ? I have and it ain't pretty.

I've followed this stock since the Theratope days and Biomira made a crucial mistake when they increased the

I also wonder how the recent FDA decision regarding Avastin might effect new applications. The Hamburg jury is
apparently still out, but some of the presentations at ASCO presented the issue fairly well ( "Raising the Bar for
Efficacy in Cancer Therapeutics"). The FDA clearly wants home runs for new oncology drugs, and (as fantastic as the
science may be) does anyone really know if Stimuvax can (or cannot) achieve this?


As someone who has been long ONTY for quite awhile, it is great to read commentary from someone who appears to
be a full-time scientist. It's unfortunate that a company representative could not respond as well, but I would imagine
they are far too busy working on producing a drug which may improve lives than to respond to speculators.


Given the decision-making style in Washington right now, perhaps it would be more financially sound decision for
investors to avoid making future investments in any biotech or pharma at all (with the exception speculative short-term
traders).

which previous estimates had put at closer to one in 15.


Moreover, those inventions, which included 40 new drugs for cancer, are currently generating in excess of $100 billion
a year in sales for drug and biotechnology firms. That’s about one-sixth the total revenue for the entire global

dj, 
No one knows what the results of the START study will be. 
It's a very large study but that doesn't mean that if Stimuvax is effective that the study will reflect that. There
can be many other things that happen like unlucky sampling, or the placebo group living longer than
expected. 
Also, it might be that Stimuvax does not actually work, it has not been conclusively shown to work yet
because previous studies are not adequate to conclusively show that. 
But Mr. Shkreli's article is full of wrong information and also shows faulty logic, like why he assumes the
placebo group will live 33 months on the average. 
Redplate is the expert. 
Even Redplate does not know that Stimuvax will work but he presents some reasons to hope that it will work
and he shows the many inadequacies of Mr. Shkreli's article. 
This is not the kind of stock that is suitable to hang your family's fortunes on. No stock is, but especially not
one small biotech stock with no drug that is FDA approved, hoping for a good result of a Phase 3 study. 
I'm optimistic Stimuvax will be successful in their trial but not enough to bet my family's fortunes on it. 
You have to realize you're making an educated bet on this. 
Like any gamble, it could work out in your favor or it could fail. I think the odds are in your favor, but even if
the odds are 65-70% that the START study gets good results and 30-35% that START will fail (I think that is
very optimistic and I would not dare to estimate the odds are any better than that-and they may well be
50/50), is even 70/30 a risk you are willing to bet on as much as you say you are betting?

Buy a strangle and wait. Investing all your money on one biotech pie in the sky hope is crazy.

Pretty sure Red just destroyed any credibility Martin had, if he ever even had any. Can't believe he just ignores Red's
posts.

Fact is you have no answers to the questions and comments. This isn't about loud it is about correct. As they
say we are all welcome to our own opinons, we are not welcome to our own facts. 
In this case you don't seem to even have a grasp on your own article, did you find where you said there was
no adjuvant yet?  
I'm not just an investor here, but you haven't figured that out yet either have you.

Author’s reply »  That is actually not a fact but an opinion. You interpret everything I say to support your
agreement instead of trying to be the socratic careful scientist you think you are. Give me a break.


I said there is no specialized adjuvant with respect to Stimuvax. This is true. MLA is not a specialized
adjuvant. Giving MLA and a purported antigen doesn't make a vaccine. Sorry.


Your self-importance is also meaningless to me and others. I don't care if you are Dr. Butts himself. I hire
hundreds of idiot consultants through expert networks who are just as if not more qualified. You're not a
professional investor. Investing is about risk reward assessments and a practical application of a wide array of
sciences - cell biology, structural biology, pharmacology, mathematics, statistics, finance, etc. Your expertise
in one area may be useful (doesn't seem like it to me), but that doesn't make someone a good investor.
There's a reason George Soros and Warren Buffett are not masters of a specific area but in general bright
folks who apply a wide set of analysis to their investing problems.


Furthermore and finally, they and I am humble and it keeps us good. You're ill-tempered, confrontational and
contemptuous. Your attitude is hard to respond to. Your unfriendly nature is very surprising and atypical. Get a
grip on whatever is bothering you and then come back with a reasonable attitude and well phrased questions.


Hope that helps! x, Martin

Actually this has nothing to do about a science discussion but more about an investment discussion. If the
whole motivation behind one's bias is to short a stock then a discreditation attempt will be the deciding factor.
If this is the case in this article, then the validity of the content is suspect and the credibility of the author must
be questioned.

First let clear up your attempt at a response. Adding MPLA to an antigen is in fact a vaccine. There are
exactly zero people in the field that will agree with your suggestion to the contrary. Zero. MPLA is exactly and
completely a specialized adjuvant. Give Glaxo a call and ask them. Call a hundred of your consultants and
ask for an honest opinion. zero will agree with this 2+2=0 comment. 
The rest of your more personal comments are funny considering. Next time you want a different response try
being either truthful and actually informative with facts, and drop the made up thesis so let's fill in some facts
to reach it approach.  
I never tried to suggest that I would offer investment advice, although I do quite well indeed thank you. I do
however offer biotech guidance and advice on everything from basic immunology, cell biology, strategic
decision making and help with IP evaluations and support. Sincve I retired from biotech 5 years ago I have
supported a dozen companies with such consulting, and continue to enjoy a few challenges in between
games of golf.  
In this particular case of ONTY I am surprised you haven't dealt/commented on the IP. Afterall biotechs are
valued on IP aren't they. Maybe you would learn something. With your lack of training or background
experience in the industry I sincerely doubt it. Remember we are entitled to our own opinions not our own
facts. So far you haven't scored a point, care for another serve.

Author’s reply »  Aren't you smug? You can work with semantics all you want but adding MPLA to an antigen
doesn't make it a vaccine. A vaccine has to elicit an immune response :)


Your tough guy attitude is frustrating. ONTY stock is going to 0. I've seen this movie too many times. Sounds
like you're just a cancer vaccine sucker who has believed in this stuff for decades. Give me a buzz through
the right channels if you want to go in depth. I can't argue with someone who won't cede an inch of ground. I
could do the same but it's just intellectually dishonest.

You are finally correct I am not a professional investor. I am a vaccine professional, and clearly with your near
insane responses you are not. I have developed a number of vaccines, and in fact had my own company
where I was VP vaccine development, bought out by GSK for 1.6B.  
You on the other hand run a construction company a sham hedge fund.

Thank you for your responses. I feel like an idiot for investing so heavily in ONTY. I kind of was hoping it would be the
blockbuster Cancer drug that the earlier article mentioned. I thought if the trial was successful, the stock would go
through the roof and I can make some good money and get out of this rut of living from check to check. I guess I'll
back off and get into something a little more safer. Is there anything anyone recommends that is safe but also may
reap a high reward in the future? Thank you for your tips. I'll still keep a small amount of shares on ONTY and
hopefully we will hear the results from this trial soon. Thanks again.

None of the longs responded to PSlice's prescient comments above either...


27 Jul 2011, 05:15 PM 


bazooooka
Dj,


At this point you should just put a stop loss in, maybe close to where you bought in. Worst case you get out even;
best case it does run and you can then move your stop up to protect profits and then rinse/repeat if it keeps going up.


There are no certainties (especially in Bio-tech). If you want something for the long hall maybe KO or WMT (or AAPL
or GOOG for a little more risk). Then again with less risk there is less reward.


This stock is super high risk you'll either make 100%+ or lose damn near that. Remember those that can average
above 10% returns a year are considered the pros.

Call me naive, but one thing I would like to see in place here is that if someone like Martin Shkreli writes an article that
subsequently moves the market, I'd sure as hell appreciate a warning about it....a pre-contribution rule that states the
slant.


This rule could apply to any contributor based on reputation/page hits/firm size/capital/etc -- I'm not questioning the
science behind his hypothesis, all I'm looking at is potential market movement and his ability to screw-the-pooch if I'm
on the wrong side of a trade.

You need to understand T-cell vaccines and not think of it as standard chemotherapy. It is 2012 and this could well be
the year of T-cell vaccines. Statistics aside, your fundamental understanding and analysis of the science could be
better. Unusual for a hedge fund to go public on any position. Always good to hear opposing views as important to
question one's investment thesis.

Looks like you were right again, Martin!!! What is the deal with RTRX? Had a look at the 8-K. Seems very interesting.

Nice call! Like most immunologists and anyone else who understands "antigen presentation", I expected stimuvax to
fail. Not surprised therefore, while researching PX-866, to find your negative review. I was waiting for the vaccine trial
to fail so that I could invest in PI3K inhibition. And yet I've found this strange trading pattern (broken two days ago, to
an extent) where share price was capped by sellers apparently not seeking best price. This was accompanied by
pulsatile selling when the bid was weak and four consecutive reports of decreased short interest. Do you, Martin,
have an explanation for the protracted period of price capping? TIA for any help. There are two knocks on PX-866.....
it didn't originate from a sophisticated phama chemistry lab, and glucose sensitivity issues should be faced with any
"pan" inhibitor. I say BFD re. the first "knock".... the physiological characteristics look good, etc. Regarding glucose
sensitivity? The phase I portion of both phase I/II trials that are due to read out in about four weeks do not show this
issue. Moreover, the insensitivity is reversible and preclinical results say that it could be moderated with relative ease.
So, why the outrageously low MC:book? Results from the phase I portion of both trials (not the phase I PX-866 trial!)
due to report in about four weeks? They look good. Scale them up, and both trials hit endpoint. Both poster
presentations are available at the ONTY website. Best of luck, all, and TIA for any help.
