Editors' Pick Short Ideas Tech


The circumstances of Chinese fabless semiconductor company Montage Technology
Group Ltd (NASDAQ:MONT) are fascinating to us. If the bull case is correct, the
company has rapidly gained market share in the Chinese set-top box market and is well
positioned as a memory buffer supplier for LRDIMM, a rapidly growing form of memory
critical to emerging cloud computing applications, yet it trades at only 12 times forward
earnings. If the bear case is correct, the company's revenue is likely overstated by as
much as 70%, sales are shrinking rather than growing, and the company may be trading
at something like 15x actual trailing revenue in spite of being an unprofitable fraud. We
have reviewed the available evidence, including MONT's public statements and filings,
the report by short-seller Gravity Research ("Gravity"), published reports from sell-side
analysts, our own conversations with sell-side analysts, conversations with Americans
involved in Chinese logistics/supply chains, and conversations with MONT's outsourced
public relations firm. We left messages for but were not yet able to speak with MONT's
American CFO, due to his travel to Shanghai. This is our summary of the situation,
based upon the most accurate and complete information available to us at the present
time and our subjective interpretation of that information.

LQW Technology Co. Ltd. ("LQW"), one of Montage's distributors, has emerged as the
epicenter of the controversy. According to MONT's prospectus dated 1/31/2014, "LQW
has been a distributor for the Company's products since October 2011." In 2011, MONT
reported $50.4 million in sales, all of which was either directly to end customers or via
distributors other than LQW. By 2012, LQW became, by far, MONT's largest distributor,
generating roughly $39.1 million in sales for MONT; non-LQW sales, including those by
other distributors, and those by the company directly to end customers, dropped to
roughly $39.1 million. In the first nine months of 2013, non-LQW sales fell again, to
$21.8 million, while LQW sales again increased, to $53.6 million.


MONT states that it has contact with end customers both before and after the sale, even
when a distributor is involved in the sale, so it is possible that LQW's revenue increase
reflects a conscious decision by MONT to steer more of their sales to end customers via
LQW rather than having those sales fulfilled by MONT itself or by other distributors.
Conversely, it's possible that LQW exists primarily to overstate MONT's financial
performance. Let's examine LQW.


LQW was incorporated by Yat Hing Anthony Ho in Hong Kong on October 20, 2011, at
the same time it reportedly began doing business with MONT. Anthony Ho has multiple
decades of high-level experience in semiconductor sales, including experience as the
director of Asia-Pacific sales for Newave Semiconductor (in 1999-2001), a company
founded by MONT CEO Howard Yang. Ho was later a co-worker of Yang and several
other MONT employees at one or more large semiconductor firms. Reading between
the lines, it is obvious that Yang and Ho had, at a minimum, a good working relationship,
and were likely friends. Of course, hiring or contracting with a trusted, well-qualified
friend is not necessarily nefarious.

The connection between LQW and MONT runs deeper than a friendship between old
business associates. On February 2, 2012, ownership of LQW was transferred from
Anthony Ho to Shanghai Lanqi Micro-Electronics Technology Company Limited
("SLMT") . Concurrent with the transfer, Ho resigned as the only director of LQW and
was appointed as its Secretary, and Yueci Chen and Dexiu Zhu were appointed as the
two new directors. As documented by Gravity and not refuted by any party to date, the
address listed in the LQW filings for Zhu Dexiu does not belong to Zhu Dexiu; rather,
that address belongs to MONT's Vice President for Finance and Administration, Phoebe
Su! Dexiu Zhu, incidentally, lives in Guoshu Village in Hefei, a five hour drive from
Shanghai.

Also alleged by Gravity and not disputed is that SLMT was formed in 2008 as a joint
venture between MONT, who contributed 10% of the capital, and senior MONT
employee (now Engineering Director) and large MONT shareholder Wu Lei/Larry Wu,
who contributed 90% of the capital. Additionally, MONT's VP for Finance and
Administration, Phoebe Su was appointed as the initial auditor of SLMT.


MONT, in their response to Gravity's allegations, notes that MONT ceased to hold an
interest in SLMT after transferring it to a third party on July 3, 2009, "at which time SLMT
was no longer an affiliate of Montage Technology (Shanghai). When Gravity Research
was working on their story, we believe they must have seen this record but chose to
ignore it to mislead the reader," notes MONT.


The Gravity report does not reference the July 3, 2009 change of control but does note
that, according to a filing on January 17, 2014, ownership of SLMT "was transferred to
Zhu Yan (received 60% ownership) and Chen Yueci (received 40% ownership)."
Disturbingly, as alleged by Gravity and not refuted, "Zhu Yan is also the legal
representative of Yunduan Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., which is owned by Yunduan
Media Company Ltd (a Hong Kong entity) which is controlled by the parents of Stephen
Tai (President of MONT)."


Montage has proclaimed, "LQW Technology Company Ltd. is not an affiliate of Montage
or its subsidiaries." Semantics aside, LQW is majority-owned by the legal representative
of a company belonging to MONT's President/co-founder's father, and in LQW's most
recent annual statement one of its two directors' home addresses was that of MONT's
VP for Finance.
Two-thirds of our firm grew up in Kentucky, so we aren't going to judge anyone solely
because their business relationships resemble a family tree. How does LQW stack up
operationally?


On October 15, 2012, LQW changed its address of record to its current location, Room
612, 6th Floor, Hong Leong Industrial Complex, No. 4 Wang Kwong Road, Kowloon Bay,
Hong Kong. Gravity reports, "LQW's registered 'office' is actually nothing more than a
small warehouse room that we estimate to be between 1,000 and 1,500 square feet… A
security guard working at the building during the day said that LQW had moved into its
room a few months ago, but that he had never seen anyone from LQW entering or
exiting the premises."


Sources tell us that this location is indeed the principal place of business for LQW. It
contains a small stock room with many boxes labeled Montage, and a small office area
with one desk for one person. We believe that this is LQW's only place of business, and
that Anthony Ho is LQW's only employee.


MONT's other distributors distribute several companies' products. MONT's other
distributors each have a website that promotes the products they are distributing. LQW
seemingly promotes only (or mainly ) Montage products, and has no website.2


LQW does not claim to distribute product to end customers entirely on its own, but
rather interfaces with "secondary distributors [who] assist [LQW] in jointly selling and
promoting [MONT's product] and actively provide customers with after-sales services."
Perhaps that is a legitimate reason for LQW's small size.


We asked knowledgeable market participants for their impressions of the situation. No
person we spoke with felt that LQW's arrangements were typical or ordinary. Reactions
ranged from "surprise" that a distributor selling $6 million in set-top box chips each
month could be a one-man shop, to frank incredulousness. It was noted to be "unusual"
that one stocking distributor would be more than 50% of a company's revenue, "very
unusual" for a distributor not to have a website, and also "very unusual" that an
important stocking distributor would stock product only from one company.


LQW's business is, indeed, very unusual. Add the tight, undisclosed relationships
between LQW and MONT to the equation, and you've got more red flags than Beijing on
China National Day.
Perhaps because MONT just completed not one but two equity offerings with woefully
insufficient disclosure -itself a violation of securities laws - the major investment banks
which helped to underwrite its equity offerings have thus far been incredibly delicate in
the way that they've (barely) defended the company. "Based on all information currently
available to us" and "Montage has stated…" are typical of the level of caution.


Only Needham and Chardan have gone out of their way to inject their own opinions into
the fray. Needham notes, "Over these seven quarters, the company's cash balances
increased by over $25MM. In our opinion, the significant increase in the company's cash
balances significantly undermine [sic] the claims of fraud made by Gravity Research."
We significantly disagree, as Longtop, China Century Dragon Media, and NIVS
Intellimedia, all now delisted, are good reminders that bank statements in China do not
necessarily equal cash in China.


Chardan's note, by analyst Jay Srivatsa, is more the brash tone that one would expect
from sell-side analysts in situations like this:
"We contend that LQW Technology is actually a real distributor based in Hong Kong
at 612, 6/F, Hong Leong Industrial Complex, 4 Wang Kwong Road, Kowloon Bay,
Hong Kong. We are puzzled as to why Gravity Research would not call the Founder
and GM of LQW. Also, contrary to the report [sic], we do not believe LQW has any
offices in Shanghai… Finally, we believe MONT is a company with a real business
with PWC as its auditor and with its cash of ~$150 million being held in Hong Kong
offices of UBS and Morgan Stanley. It's CEO and management teams have been
buyers of stock in the IPO and recently concluded secondary offering and that gives
us confidence that MONT is unlikely to be a fraud like the report claims."


Of course MONT has a lot of cash, having sold 8.16 million shares at $10 on 9/25/2013,
and another 1 million primary shares at $21.00 on 1/31/2014. But Srivatsa's last
argument is actually pretty persuasive - why would management add to their holdings of
a fraudulent endeavor? If MONT is really a fraud, management should be looking to
cash out at the first available opportunity, perhaps the March 24, 2014 IPO lock-up
expiry.


Typically, members of management would file a Form 3 after an IPO, and a Form 4 if
they added to or subtracted from their holdings subsequently. Unfortunately, at present,
there are no ownership filings for Montage displaying in the SEC's EDGAR system. We
don't believe this is due to any fraud on the company's part; their investor relations firm
says they are having a problem with the "core feed not working," so it is reasonably
likely the company made its filings but perhaps due to a coding glitch they are not
showing up.
Unfortunately, because the forms are not showing up, and because the investor
relations firm is unwilling to say how many shares management purchased because
they are not sure if it is public information (although apparently the analyst at Chardan
knows, so it must not be very un-public, if your firm was an underwriter on the deal), it is
challenging to test Srivatsa's hypothesis.


It appears that Howard Yang (CEO/co-founder) and Stephen Tai (President/co-founder)
each purchased 100,000 shares of stock at some point (likely the IPO at $10.00)
between the IPO prospectus and the secondary offering prospectus, and that other
members of management collectively purchased 49,162 shares.


Interestingly, Xunren Yang and Shuzhuang Liang, the parents of MONT co-
founder/CEO/Chairman Howard Yang, sold 400,000 shares, about half of their entire
ownership stake, in the recent secondary offering at $21, for proceeds of $8.4 million.

Kuai Lap Tai and Iong Wa Chao, the parents of MONT President/co-founder Stephen
Tai, also sold 400,000 shares - 30% of their holdings - in the secondary offering, for
proceeds of $8.4 million.


Liang Wu sold 160,000 shares - 40% of his stake - for proceeds of $3.36 million. Who is
Liang Wu? It turns out, as Gravity has convincingly demonstrated, that he is actually Wu
Lei/Larry Wu, the initial 90% investor/co-founder of SLMT, and currently MONT's
Engineering Director.


Without the benefit of Forms 4 to review, that adds up to roughly $2.5 million in recent
stock purchases for company insiders, versus $20.2 million in stock sales for company
insiders (including their parents). That doesn't give us confidence in the stock.


Wellington Management recently filed a 13G noting that they now own 11.26% of MONT.
Assuming they owned 4.99% of the shares outstanding prior to MONT's large dip on the
Gravity report, Wellington bought at least 1.72 million shares of stock in a very short
period of time. It's possible they purchased all 3.1 million shares of their position on
February 6 and 7, in which case the buying represents a very large percentage of the
shares traded on those days. Past experience (with UNXL) suggests that Wellington
may not have done as much work as we have done on MONT. It's bearish that the stock
has traded so poorly in spite of a large institution mopping up a great deal of supply.


Is there perhaps a low-single digit percent chance that a Chinese company whose
insiders sold $20 million in stock before the IPO lock-up expired, and that has major
undisclosed relationships with its largest distributor, a distributor with massive sales, one
employee, no other products to distribute, and no web presence, is not a fraud? It's
possible. But we doubt it. Unless the company's American underwriters aggressively
purchase enough stock to become major holders themselves, we believe MONT will,
over time, drift down towards a price not very far above the cash on its books. Although
fraud can persist for a long time in frothy bull markets with easy credit, we believe
MONT has violated securities laws badly enough to provoke an SEC investigation, and
that the eventual outcome of such an investigation will be unfavorable for the company.
We are short MONT.
