February 18, 2014 
Time to Go “Old School”: 


 Citron Busts Medbox (OTCBB:MDBX) for  
MULTIPLE FRAUDS -- Stock Is Worthless 


 
Citron Research is in our 13


th
 year of publishing investigative research into suspect 


publicly traded companies. During that span, Citron has exposed more corporate 
fraud than any other source on Wall Street.  Our published work has focused on 
over 150 companies, some with very notable individual investors and firms publicly “on 
the other side”.   
 
Our writings have warned the public to steer clear of investments rigged to vaporize 
their cash.  All of this writing is available for anyone to evaluate.  
 
Much of our work, especially in our early years of publishing, focused on the sparsely 
regulated Over-the-Counter and Pink Sheets markets 
 
When it comes to exposing fraud on the Pink Sheets and the OTCBB, Citron has NEVER 
been wrong.  Yes, we know NEVER is a bold statement … but it is what it is.   
 


Introducing Medbox  
 


In this report Citron is not going to rehash the numerous law enforcement red flags 
adorning the bios of the nefarious characters behind MedBox, and their many go-rounds 
with criminal and civil law enforcement entities. Citron believes these disturbing facts 
are extremely relevant to investors, but they have been previously detailed very 
thoroughly by the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation as well as other media 
outlets.  For those of you who do not know who is running the show, you can read it 
here 


http://sirf-online.org/tag/medbox/ 
 


Instead, this report will focus on the systemic fraud throughout this company and the 
stock promotion behind the fraud that has brought this worthless company to a $1 bil + 
market cap.  Yes you read that correctly.  There are currently 44,500,750 shares 
outstanding.

   So What Exactly is Medbox Selling?   
 


Good question.  Medbox claims they are not in the marijuana business, but rather 
offering products and services to candidates for dispensaries.  That means they offer 
legal services (even though they are not lawyers), and construction build-out consulting 
(even though they are not construction contractors) to a highly limited cohort of 
wannabe dispensary operators.  They do offer to help clients fill out applications for 
dispensary licenses in the states where marijuana sales are legal, along with literally 
thousands of professional and non-professional consultants competing for the business.   
 
And if and only if their client actually obtains a license for a dispensary, they are 
contractually obligated to buy a dispensing machine from Medbox. 
 
Ironically, Medbox’s founder and COO Vincent Mehdizadeh was formerly busted for 
dispensing legal advice without a law license (can be read in previously stated article).  
 


  Medbox is Spitting In The Face of the U.S. 
Government. 
 


In January of 2014 FNRA issued a warning about investing in marijuana stocks and 
possibility of fraud. In the warning we read: 
 





http://www.finra.org/investors/protectyourself/investoralerts/fraudsandscams/p325352 
 


In response to the warning Medbox’s founder had the audacity to issue a response, 
posturing his reply to make it seem this warning did not apply to his company. 
 


In Medbox’s official corporate response, we read: 
 





Marijuana Stock Scams 
 
“Regardless of how you first hear about them, the offers almost always 
contain hallmarks of "pump and dump" ploys. Specifically, fraudsters lure 
investors with aggressive, optimistic — and potentially false and misleading 
— statements or information designed to create unwarranted demand for 
shares of a small, thinly traded company with little or no history of financial 
success (the pump).”

239909031.html 





At the time of the above quote, their OTC/Pink Sheet Disclosure Statement for Q3 2013 
indeed claimed profitability..albeit small and questionable 


http://www.otcmarkets.com/financialReportViewer?symbol=MDBX&id=113733 
 


But wait …. a new filing on January 21, 2014, just over a week later, reports on THE 
SAME quarter with a completely different set of financials that show the company is 
actually losing money. 
 


http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547996/000138730814000004/form1012g.htm  


 
Comparing the two sets of financials you will see that there is not just one line item that 
has changed but rather – THE COMPANY LITERALLY HAS 2 Sets of Financials…or maybe 
3.  
 
If shareholders want to be forgiving (which regulators most definitely are not) they can 


say:  Oh c’mon, the company had one bad accounting quarter … NOT SO!  Medbox 
has systematically and repeatedly committed FRAUD on their financial statements, and 
the public statements they make about their financials are laced with lies!  
 
A press release on April 2, 2013 reads: 
 





http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=56990343 
 
Two weeks later on April 15


th
, it reaffirms that lie in another PR:   





"Medbox is proud to report that Q1 2013 was its highest revenue 
quarter in the company's history at more than $2 million booked as 
revenue ...” 


"...making Q1 2013 revenue well in excess of $2 million -- a company 
record” 


“Some of the public companies in the marijuana sector are in the business 
of self-promotion … Since day 1, our company has… demonstrated 
profitability while not deriving revenue from the cultivation or sale of the 
marijuana itself. As far as I know, we are the only company in the space to 
have accomplished those feats. 


-- Vincent Mehdizadeh, Chief Operations Officer at Medbox, Inc 
-- Corporate PR, January 13, 2014.

Bit just one month later on May 21, 2013 in an SEC filing for Q1 we read: 
 


"Revenues $ 1,749,554.93" 
 


https://www.otciq.com/otciq/ajax/showFinancialReportById.pdf?id=105065  
 


OK, c’mon Citron what’s $300,000 between friends?  Don’t nitpick over a small change!  
….Right? 


 
Not right.  It gets worse…again.   On January 29 2014, a new filing reports Q1 2013 yet 
again.  This time, its: 


“Revenues $1,245,522” 
 
So their Q1 2013 revenues are now 40% less that initially stated, during the time the 
company raised money.  
 


https://www.otciq.com/otciq/ajax/showFinancialReportById.pdf?id=115813  
 


  More Fraud by Medbox 
 


Just in case publishing two  (oops!)  three sets of financials published to the public was not 
enough, let us now illustrate the fraud at the core of the business.   
 
Most recently the company solicited business in Massachusetts to entrepreneurs 
wanting to apply for dispensary licenses.   In a small local newspaper in Massachusetts 
we read of the continued fraud by Medbox: 
 


 
 
http://t.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131015/NEWS/310150327&template=t
abletart  
 


In the same article we read: 
 


 “Two Plymouth County applicants, Dracut-based Meyesone and Plymouth-based Fogo’s 





 
 
“In various Phase 1 application filings with the Department of Public Health -- 
which is overseeing medical marijuana in Massaschusetts -- Mehdizadeh 
wrote in a form letter that he has “over $62 million in available assets, and 
pledges $1 million for setting up dispensaries.

listed Mehdizadeh’s company Vincent Chase LLC as their financier, and both were 
rejected in their Phase 1 bid.” 
 


Wait, these multiple applications are in direct contrast to what Mr. Mehdizadeh has told 
both Wall Street and State Health Regulators 
 





   So How Did Medbox Do in Massachusetts? 


Assuming you are the type of investor who can look past fraud, a non-scaleable business 
model, and an insane market cap, and want to be look at just corporate promises -- we point 
you to the disaster in Massachusetts.   


Medbox put on quite the full-court marketing blitz in Massachusetts.  With the whole 
dispensary licensing process going into full swing, the company left no stones unturned in its 
quest to sign up clients, putting on seminars and producing a lot of targeted videos:  
 
( Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Dispensary & Rules Seminar Part1- Intro to Medbox and 
Kind Clinics – Bedrick ) 


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41CO6c1Fwrg 


(How a Massachusetts Medical Cannabis Dispensary would operate with the Medbox-
MDS technology ) 


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcJXUxT20oc 


In addition, there were the big media appearances and interviews:  


http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/04/03/medbox-medical-marijuana-vending-
machine/ 


Medbox’s self proclaimed greatness came from the fact that they had been able to 
procure a fair number of licenses for their clients in Arizona.  This seems to have been 
because the licenses were awarded by blind lottery, without regard to the credentials of 
the applicants, or how many applications were submitted.   


Well Citron is pleased to present all those who made it to Phase 2 in Massachusetts: 
 
http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/hcq/medical-
marijuana/dispensary-application-materials.html 
 


“I have no financial interest in any of these dispensaries other than making 
sure that the clients that we have been hired to represent obtain licensing.” 


-- Vincent Mehdizadeh  
Founder and principal shareholder of Medbox

And as far as Citron can tell, only one of them is a Medbox client- but it gets so 
much worse.  In order to prove the accusations made in the local article, we see this 
from the one client from Medbox who made it to phase 2:   
 
THEY HAD THEIR LEASE SIGNED OVER TO THEM FROM MEDBOX.  This directly 
contradicts the company’s disclosures to investors and their auditors.  Here is the 
smoking gun: 





http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/quality/drugcontrol/medical-marijuana/applications/total-health-1of2-app.pdf (pg 83) 
 


Don’t even bother asking where this contingent liability appears on Medbox’s financial 
statements.

A Promotion to Make Madoff Proud 
 


When discussing the word fraud over the past 6 years, we admit the word “Madoff” has 
become a completely overused cliché when invoked to compare to another financial 
scam.  But then when we read the “testimonials” on the Medbox webpage, we can’t 
help but resurrect this comparison.  All of these statements will one day be used as 
evidence in the eventual stock fraud case against Medbox and its executives.

( NOTE:  Citron has archived page prints of these pages of testimonials and will republish them with its 
own link if the company attempts to remove them from its website.)

Testimonials from clients?  Shareholders?  Both?  
 








 
 
And this one is our favorite.  It demonstrates how management’s actions are so 
exaggeratedly promotional … oblivious to the lines between investors and customers … 
unaware that this admission proves Medbox’s client relationships are riddled with 
related-party transactions.   
 


“This is a letter of recommendation for Medbox and Vincent Mehdizadeh 
as it relates to my business interactions with him. I find Vince to be honest 
and forthright in every aspect of our business relationship in the past four 
years. I am currently involved with Vince in another business venture and 
I would not hesitate to enter into future business ventures with him. Vince 
is hard working and has fantastic communication skills with all of his 
clients. Never once has Vince left me in the dark regarding any issues 
and he always returned my inquiries in a timely manner. 


Please feel free to have potential clients contact me if they have any 
questions regarding Vince and his character.” 


“If I could turn back time I would have invested all my liquid resources in 
their business. Quite simply, Medbox has proven the single best 
investment for myself and my family. We are reaping the rewards of their 
intuition and ability to react properly as they break ground in an explosive 
market. 


If you are looking for a real investment in an emerging market, look no 
further, the facts surrounding Medbox speak for themselves.” 





“Medbox made me feel comfortable and confident about investing, and I 
did. They made no false promises nor guarantees of riches; they told it 
straight….Well, several years later, my investment has paid off, and it may 
turn out to be life-changing for my family.” 


“As one of the earliest and one of the largest Outside Investors of Medbox, 
I have a very strong statement to make.   Medbox is the best thing to ever 
come into my investment life.”
Citron Exposes Medbox February 18, 2014 Page 9 of 13 
 





Business Model 


We feel stupid even writing this, but putting a marijuana vending machines behind the 
counter is nothing short of stupid.  They should put it next to the beer machine and the 
Xanax machine.  It is so ridiculous that they cannot even sell the machines to people 
who also do not sign up for the “total program”.   Needless to say, anyone who thinks 
you will buy marijuana out of a machine without smelling it- has never bought 
marijuana. 


Old School Stock Promotion Market Manipulation 
Maneuver 


In what is probably the most ridiculous corporate action in the history of stock 
promotions, Medbox decided to declare something they called a “stock split” but in 
reality executed a stock dividend of a restricted share per each share outstanding, in 
December. 


As justified by management: 





" We wanted to reward existing shareholders and also increase the stocks 
marketability by making it attractive to a larger number of potential 
investors” 


-- Vincent Mehdizadeh,  
COO and Founder of Medbox, Inc” 


“I contacted what was then Vincent’s private company, Medicine 
Dispensing Systems, back in 2011 so I could get started in the MMJ 
industry with a leader. Vincent has ushered me through every step of my 
desire to operate a new business and I credit him and Medbox with 
getting my small group of partners a dispensary license in Arizona. I 
couldn’t have done it without him and his expert team. In fact, when the 
Arizona government challenged the dispensary program and licensing 
was halted for a year, Vincent gave me a personal loan of $7,000 in 
order to help me and my family out as we had invested most of our 
money into the new business and were not expecting the circumstances 
beyond everyone’s control occurring at that moment. Vincent didn’t have 
to do that but that’s why Vincent is as successful as he is. He always tells 
me that in life people should pay it forward and not expect anything in 
return. Well, I can safely say that Vincent deserves all the success. He 
has worked hard for it!”
Citron Exposes Medbox February 18, 2014 Page 10 of 13 
 


What?  Now you are getting high on your own supply.  What other company has 
rewarded its shareholders by giving them a whole restricted share without splitting the 
stock -- IT HAS NEVER BEEN DONE.  Also, how does it make it attractive after the split?  
If anything, one would be crazy to buy the stock anytime after the split -- you get half of 
what someone who bought it the day before got. 


This was a clear attempt to manipulate the stock through either a short squeeze, a 
rogue broker operation, or a simple “something for nothing” scheme – all three are 
ridiculous.  Management goes on to say:  


 
http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medbox-declares-a-2-for-1-stock-split-in-the-form-of-a-special-stock-


dividend-236547271.html 
 


No!  What sets you apart from other companies is that you are a scam stock promotion -
- and you regard your potential shareholders as too naïve to understand that an investor 
who buys your shares today is going to receive half the ownership of someone who 
bought shares prior to December 18, 2013.    
 


Just in Case you want more Fraud … Here it is, served cold. 
 


   You Lied to Me at Hello!   
 


It seems like Medbox management cannot help themselves – they cannot control their 
serial lying in promoting their stock.  The first thing displayed to a visitor on their 
corporate home page is a video link (which we assume investors watch because they 
obviously don’t read).  It is for Medbox Lockbox Express, and the first shot in the video 
is:  


"What sets us apart from most other companies in our space is our low 
issued and outstanding share count, attention to transparency, relationship 
with our shareholders, and overall work ethic…

The leader?  Medbox has not sold even ONE Lockbock Express system!  Not even one 
sale … amidst a highly competitive industry.  Worse, according to their filings, this 
product is not even available for sale -- just a dream so far.  
 


Meanwhile, here is the link to an entire annual conference and trade show of dozens of

Mainstream Media 
 


Some of you might have bought this stock because of the company’s numerous 
appearances on mainstream media. It should be noted that the media is not very careful 
about vetting these companies – they want a marijuana story, so they get some intern 
to go call people … and this is the result they get.  
 





(Click to see Medbox CEO Bedrick’s CNBC appearance) 
 


“What people don’t understand … there is a tremendous opportunity for large 
organizations, large franchises like McDonalds, agricultural organizations like RJR 
or technology like IBM. Medbox has that ability to be all of those companies.

  Anticipating Medbox’s Predictable Response 
to Citron 
 


A special note to founder Vincent Mehdizadeh from Andrew Left, editor of Citron 
Research: 
 
 








Dear Vincent and Bruce,  


Let’s skip the bullshit and cut right to the chase.  Your situation is hopeless.  
Your track record of corporate misdeeds at Medbox and misleading 
shareholders is beyond salvage.  I know when you read this report, you’ll feel 
a lot of righteous indignation and your first reaction will be to want to sue me.   
I hope you do!   


If you would be so kind as to file a suit, my attorneys will use the power of 
discovery afforded by civil trial procedures right here in California to unravel 
this entire scam and lay it on the doorstep of Federal regulators.  There is 
truly nothing you can say to defend yourself from the contents of this report 
except to contact your personal lawyers immediately and ask them what 
steps you should take so you can avoid going to jail. Nothing more to be 
said.   


In the meantime, I sincerely hope you and your team have not sold a single 
share of restricted stock away from the market – because we will find it in 
discovery.  Please sue me.

  Conclusion: This is a Full On FRAUD, Folks 
 


You Have to be Smoking Crack to Buy this Marijuana Stock 


It is not as if Medbox is a company that has had a few reporting deficiencies amidst a 
small but growable business core.  Rather, everything they do seems to have an 
underlying purpose of deception.  There is a consistent pattern here, which runs the 
spectrum of nearly every corporate action, from the most significant: 


 Management Backgrounds in Consumer Fraud 
 Fraudulent Financial Statements 
 Unidentified Related Party Transactions 
 Market Manipulation of Securities  


 
to as small but obvious as their own self-description: 
 


 
http://www.thedispensingsolution.com/about-us 





… despite most of the listed offices being mere P.O. boxes that exist to 
create a deceptive impression for naive investors. 
 


So What’s it Worth?   


0  … Zero…Zilch…Goose Egg…Nada …or in Pink Sheet terms .0001.   


The company has nothing unique or proprietary.  (We do not believe their patent will 
provide any realistic obstacle to competition, and is not broadly enforceable.)  They own 
a ridiculous vending machine business, peddling a machine that they cannot seem to 
give away….they have to force it down their clients’ throats, contractually speaking. The 
only thing in this operation that is more shaky than the business model is the 
management. 


Run, don’t walk!
