Green Mountain Coffee: One Of My Favorite Shorts

Jesse Eisinger, one of the best investigative journalists around, raises some very good
questions about Green Mountain Coffee (NASDAQ:GMCR) and its accounting in his
column that ran in the New York Times earlier this week, Seeking Answers From Green
Mountain Coffee, which begins:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1690592-green-mountain-coffee-one-of-my-favorite-shorts 2/16


Green Mountain Coffee Roasters' first-ever investor day is Tuesday, and the
company is flying high.


The stock price of the company, which sells coffee machines under the Keurig brand
and the little K-Cups that go in them, has soared more than 260 percent in the last
year.


Despite persistent questions, most of Wall Street remains resolutely bullish on Green
Mountain, which has a market value of $12 billion.


In 2010, the company disclosed it was being investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In 2011, the hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who is
betting against Green Mountain's stock price, delivered a highly critical 110-slide
speech at an investor conference, raising questions about the company's future
prospects and, more seriously, its bookkeeping. He followed up a year later with
another one.


A class-action lawsuit, which was dismissed, quoted anonymous former employees
about suspicious activities. Green Mountain has said it conducted an internal
investigation that cleared the company.


Green Mountain operates on a razor/razor blade model - selling brewing machines
but making its real money on the K-Cups. It used to disclose exactly how many K-
Cups it sold but stopped doing so in 2010. Instead, it tells investors the year-over-
year percentage growth. Wall Street has dutifully plugged numbers in to estimate the
unit sales.


Last year, Green Mountain faced expirations of the patents that covered its brewing
system. Wall Street has been monitoring whether Green Mountain will lose market
share to new private-label knockoffs. And indeed, a recent Barron's article
suggested that it was losing share faster than expected.


A recent disclosure from the company's new chief executive, Brian Kelley, has
revived the questions about sales, as do on-the-ground accounts I have received
from former factory and warehouse workers.


Because Green Mountain's investor day will give analysts and shareholders unusual
access to company executives, it seems like an opportunity to ask them some hard
questions.


Here are a few from me.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1690592-green-mountain-coffee-one-of-my-favorite-shorts 3/16


*Just how many K-Cups has Green Mountain sold year-to-date and is it less than the
Street understands?...


*How wide is the gap between how many K-Cups the company says it has sold and
how many have ended up in customer's hands? And why?...


*What explains the unusual movements of Green Mountain inventory described by
some former company workers and associates?...


*What is happening with the SEC.'s investigation of Green Mountain, which the
company has said involves its accounting practices?...


Let's take a closer look at K-Cups, where the math just doesn't make sense - and the
company isn't helping with an explanation. At the analyst day earlier this week (see
webcast and 188-slide presentation here), the company was asked to reconcile this
estimate of K-Cups (since, as Eisinger notes, the company stopped disclosing K-Cup
sales in 2010): there are 16 million brewers, GMCR claims usage (an "attachment rate") of
1.4 K-Cups per day x 365 days/year, which results in sales of 8.2 billion K-Cups per year
(which doesn't even count maybe 15-20% additional consumption away from home).


But GMCR isn't selling anything close to this number of K-Cups, per both analysts and the
company (see Eisinger's article), so what gives? My answer: usage is declining. It makes
sense that the people who bought brewers first are likely to be the heaviest users, so the
company and analysts should be modeling declining attachment rates - but of course
they're not.


When Mark Astrachan, the Stifel Nicolaus' analyst (and the only one with a “sell” rating on
the stock), asked about this at the analyst day, Green Mountain’s CEO Brian Kelley said:
"We don't multiply it by 365. (inaudible) You're applying straight math that we don't do."
(Yes, he really said that!) When Astrachan tried to follow up, Kelley said: "We're not going
to get into that here. That's not the intent and we're not going to get into the model in that
kind of detail here." (The "detail" he's referring to is the attachment rate of the brewers -
one of the most important metrics there is!)


An even greater concern is that 700-900 million K-Cups can't be accounted for. Eisinger
writes:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1690592-green-mountain-coffee-one-of-my-favorite-shorts 4/16


That's a far cry from 5.6 billion. There seems to be a gap in the United States of
about 900 million K-Cups.


What's going on?


Mr. Brandt said the company declined to give its overall sales volume, but said the
IRI number that I was furnished with was too low. He said a company analysis
indicated that this portion of Green Mountain's sales should be about 2.7 billion, not
2.6 billion.


Still, even if we use the company's figure of 2.7 billion, total sales in the United
States would be 4.9 billion, or about 700 million K-Cups short of what the company
has said. That's a lot of extra K-Cups sitting in the channel.


Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I've seen this kind of thing before: in many of the China
frauds, companies were booking fake sales, resulting in fake profits. But that leads to a big
problem for the companies: it's hard to fake all the cash that should be in the bank as a
result of the supposed profits. The solution? Make overpriced/fraudulent acquisitions
and/or fake excessive cap ex to reduce the cash (that was, of course, never there).


Now go back and read David Einhorn’s 110-slide presentation on GMCR at the Value
Investing Congress on Oct. 17, 2011 (posted here) and look at the high-priced acquisitions
on pages 50-53 and pages 68-72 on cap ex. Einhorn estimated that $431 million (58%) of
GMCR's 2012 cap ex was "unexplained" and concluded:


Capital spending is growing much faster than the business
Capital intensity should be getting more efficient as the company achieves scale
The gap is so large and insufficiently explained that it raises questions about what is
being capitalized and casts doubt on the business model


Einhorn gave an update on GMCR in his presentation at the Value Investing Congress on
Oct. 2, 2012. He didn't release the slides, but here are my notes:



http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/10/19/heres-the-einhorn-presentation-that-killed-green-mountain-shares
5/23/2018 Green Mountain Coffee: One Of My Favorite Shorts - Keurig Green Mountain Inc (NASDAQ:GMCR) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1690592-green-mountain-coffee-one-of-my-favorite-shorts 5/16


GMCR's cap ex as a percentage of sales was 11.0% in 2011, 13.1% (est.) in 2012,
and 9.2% (guidance) in 2013. Compare this to the 3.3% average in the food
products industry, with a range of 1.0% to 6.3%.


GMCR's cumulative cap ex from 2007-2012 was $1.043 billion and K-Cup shipments
in 2012 were 7.1 billion. Divide these two and you get 14.7 cents of cap ex over six
years for each K-Cup produced in 2012. Einhorn compared this to a competitor,
which spent 3.8 cents for each K-Cup produced (buying the same production
equipment as GMCR). Again, massive unexplained cap ex.


Einhorn then turned to the production capacity that GMCR's competitors were
bringing online and estimated that they would have enough capacity to take 19%
market share by the end of 2012 and 26% by the end of 2013.


Lastly, Einhorn showed that competitors were already selling K-Cups for 22-39%
less than GMCR was, and highlighted price cuts GMCR had taken that would wipe
out nearly all of its profit.


(Obviously these last two things haven't occurred yet - but that doesn't mean they won't…)


Is GMCR committing massive accounting fraud? I don't know - and I certainly can't prove
it - but there are a number of warning flags, so I sure can't rule it out. The company could
easily put a lot of these concerns to rest by providing some obvious disclosure - like
number of K-Cups sold - but refuses to (despite providing highly granular disclosure on
most other matters), which makes me all the more suspicious…


The nice thing about GMCR as a short is that I think it's a good one even if its accounting
is clean because of its very high valuation (29x trailing EPS and 22x FYE 9/14 estimates
(if you believe them)) combined with its patent loss a year ago, which is resulting in a ton
of low-cost competition entering the market (see page 44-48 of Einhorn's 2011
presentation and my notes from his 2012 presentation above).


It's almost never pretty when a company with a monopoly market share and monopolistic
pricing begins to face competition from low-cost generic producers (think what happens
when a drug goes off patent) - but it can take some time for the competition to emerge and
impact the monopolist's financials, during which time the monopolist can give whatever
guidance it wants (and you can be sure that Wall St. "analysts" won't question the pie-in-
the-sky guidance). Witness this week’s analyst day…

My guess is that you do not own a Keurig brewer at home nor work in an office where they are used such as my
Fidelity office in Greenwich.


As a GMRC shareholder since 718/2012 I watch the amount of space Costco devotes to GMCR. Note COST now
offers 200 K-cup packs on line. .


13 Sep 2013, 09:50 AM


AgileDave
Costco.com has a bunch of k-cup brands and styles, including Costco's house brand which is made by
GMCR. but they have a bunch of alternate brands, and that's what Tilson is saying will eat into GMCR's
primary business. The stock price doesn't care about Tilson's history, or the stock price history, only what it
will do next quarter. The investors' meeting was kind of weak. We shouldn't be stampeded by negative
analysis, but we shouldn't take too much comfort in past glories, either. Be careful.


13 Sep 2013, 01:02 PM


TedNewbie
That is exactly right. Costco is currently offering a Kirkland Signature Breakfast blend at $0.37 per k-cup. (200
cups at $74.99)


This is much lower than the $0.53 per k-cup that GMCR used to enjoy.

This article is worthless. It covers old data that is not relevant and doesn't talk to all of the new additions (Tetley,
Campbells, etc.) GMCR is also adding on cold beverages and possible international expansion. 
Einhorn has lost his shirt on GMCR and you will to if you follow Einhorn. 
I do not own this stock.

markb
There is zero risk of GMCR committing "massive accounting fraud" with the SEC sitting in their offices for the last 3
years. And your analogy of "drug goes off patent" where the product is chemically identical is plain wrong for a
premium branded consumer good, where the consumer, by virtue of buying the expensive machine, is looking for a
non-generic product. Maybe a better analogy is Ralph's cola ekeing out a few low end share points from KO/PEP.

Whitney, although you may be right on this trade longer-term. It's always better to short deteriorating fundamentals as
opposed to straight overvaluation.

Your track record for shorting has been abysmal.  
HLF has more than doubled since you shorted in December 2012. 
IOC has more than doubled since you first shorted it. 
Your “top 3 shorts” for 2013 are up on average 58% YTD. 
When one short a shock and it more than doubles and the borrower is forced to pay heavy fees to short the stock,
your loss are compounded.

Don't get caught up in David Einhorn's prediction or in fact most "predictors" of the markets. It's truly amazing how
many stupid people on wall street actually make any money. Since last year, every stock Einhorn mentioned is up at
least 100 fold since his comments were made. Who's really the one we should trust? Definitely not Einhorn. ONLY
INVEST IN WHAT YOU KNOW and you will beat all the overly paid fools on wall street. I personally own three stocks
in last ten years and all are up over 350%. Beat that Einhorn! $BAM, $SBUX, and $AMT

Long-dated put options on Green Mountain stock are very expensive. They give you insufficient upside for the risk
you are taking. Green Mountain might be overvalued but if the puts are also overvalued then it is not such a great
short.


13 Sep 2013, 01:14 PM


Rappenco
Svetoslav; 
I agree; 
Put options are an especially dicey way of betting against a stock. 
It can take a long time for the fundamentals to catch up with these high fliers and time is one thing that kills
owners of options. I tried this tactic with Tesla but the premium was excessive requiring a huge drop in the
share price before I could actually make money. If you pay $30 for an at the money put you better hope that
stock starts falling in the very near future. 
There is a whole bunch of folks out there searching for stocks with large short interest as these shorts will
have to cover and buy thus driving the shares higher. Look at Chipolte;(CMG) ; I wanted to short it at $300.
These short hunters tend to be very effective.

I love reading this stuff. It's either feast or famine with may commenters. We'll obviously all see how it plays out. As for
generic K-cups taking share, who knows. When someone puts out inferior coffee, not worried. I've tasted some and
some are ok, some are undrinkable. Even had one, don't remember the brand, that was instant coffee in the cup. No
kidding. Obviously they won't grow at 80%/year anymore, and I wouldn't buy any stock now, but if they can pull off
global expansion, who knows. Remember, they're essentially a domestic company. As for coffee drinkers, we're a
picky lot. Kind of like coke and pepsi. Hardcores on both sides. And with their scale, they should be able drive some
effeciency allowing them to reduce prices and maintain margins, or most of them in order to address generics if
needed. If next generation of brewers will require barcoded cups to work, kind if hurts the generics, don't you think. It
will all be fun to watch over the next few years. Maybe we'll be put out of our misery and someone buys them and we
can argue about something else.

The GMCR short who followed Einhorn could be the major contributor to keep GMCR stock price at current high level.

resurfaces again after New CEO has lead GMCR for one year. If any accounting problem, you would believe new

CEO would do the clean house before starting his own era. It is very tough to make money those days, even those
big shots like Einhorn have to leverage their old glory and publicly announce their long or short after establishing their
position. But those big shots are more wrong than right.(2) I regularly check grocery stores for K-cup, the shelf space
is much bigger and store brands take about half. But the store brands have no much price advantage over K-cup, only
~$1 per box. (3) Don't short any stock based on valuation, look at AMZN, NFLX.

Bought $GMCR in '07. Have ridden the wave through 2 SEC investigations, Einhorn's follies, the end of the patents,
and almost every other doom and gloom scenario possible. Whenever I read another of these type articles. I just have
to remind myself occasionally that I have a cost basis of $7, relax and ride the wave for three more years until I retire,
sell the stock, buy a new Keurig, and have enough left over to buy k-cups for the rest of my life.

Storecounter, I knew a guy like you years ago, who bought a stock called Dimeathaid. It was some BS
pharmaceutical company that claimed its drug could cure everything. Needless to say, it was all lies.


Like you, he bought the stock for pennies and rode the stock all the way up, and on paper made a killing.
Unfortunately he believed the story so much he never sold. He rode the stock all the way down to zero.


As for being able to survive 2 SEC investigations, Bernie Madoff proved that some crooks have a gift for
deception and the SEC ain't that smart.


So it looks to me like you've made 13 times your money. You did well. Now be smart and take profits,
otherwise you will end up like the gambler that goes to Vegas wins a fortune but doesn't have the sense to
walk away from the tables.

By the time you've read all three of these books you will understand why Priceline is an obvious long term
winner and why GMCR is a risky gamble.


There are many, many good books out there. My suggestion is to read as many of them as you can. The
more you read the better you will understand the mechanics of making money in the markets.

100 percent hindsight is a diploma for fools. The phrase in his context, I believe is a comment on past
performance. We should all refrain from blasting an observation without considering where someone is
coming from. Speaking of past performance, can't help think about how Buffett gained plenty by recognizing
oversold and under appreciated stocks and used his influence ($$$) to move the market and then cashed in
on the results. I am singing the show tune, "If I were a rich man" from Fiddler on the Roof.

The big accounting issue the shorts see is the inventory levels, which for a while increased much faster than sales.
Either sales keep increasing to justify these amazing inventory increases, or something else will happen. In terms of
Einhorn, being right does not mean the trade will be profitable. Look at HLF. Do 99% of the people make money in
MLM? Of course not. Is the stock a cash cow? You bet. Enough said.

Harry, but it appears you are wrong about this being a cash cow. It isn't. Its had negative FCF (free cash flow)
in 6 of the last 10 years. Yeah you are right, shorting the stock might be dangerous since its very difficult to
know when the stock will crash and burn, but that is not an argument for going long. There are plenty of other
great companies to go long on. Personally, I would give this one a wide berth if I were you. At best, its a
dangerous stock to own.

I never assumed GMCR is a cash cow, and I am looking for a way to short it. I was only trying to suggest
stocks that have outrageous valuations sometimes keep those valuations for a very long time.

Yet another person wanting to be a hero by shorting GMCR. On the contrary, I made some good money on the way
up from 42 to 76. I'd consider buying again once P/E becomes more reasonable.

to me like you are lucky.

frankiethepunk
Very interesting article. I took a look at GMCR about a year and a half ago and didn't much like the look of it. For one
thing it had negative FCF for 6 of of 10 years which indicated to me that it was burning through cash at an alarming
rate. However, after reading this article, I now realize it was a method of explaining bogus sales figures.


But I guess the biggest warning for me is that I had used this company's products at one time and found that
consuming coffee in this manner (with the little K cup thingy) was a very unsatisfactory coffee drinking experience. It
felt like I was drinking coffee from a coffee dispensing machine in the basement somewhere.


Intuitively it felt like there was a very limited market for these machines. I think I also found out that the price of these
Keurig machines was several hundred dollars, which I thought was totally ridiculous. Only posers would buy this
overpriced ridiculous machine and I couldn't imagine that there was a big market for these machines.

If you compare it with the many other ways of brewing a really good cup of coffee (either single or multiple cups) there
are a wide variety of inexpensive alternatives. So the notion that this company was generating exponential sales
triggered my BS alarm. Something wasn't kosher.


Anyway, a very interesting analysis. Its good to know that my original instincts on this were good. It goes to show the
stock market is a treacherous place for the unwary and gullible.


14 Sep 2013, 07:18 PM


markb
Your original instincts were good? You didn't like the look of it a year and a half ago when the price was 42 so
you were dead wrong. Then you couldn't imagine there was a big market for these machines and they sold
16mm so you were again dead wrong. You assume the SEC has missed fraud for three years but a well
known short blabbing on SA has found it...again, dead wrong. Perhaps you should stop relying on your
investing "instincts" and try an index fund.

You will learn sooner or later, that the reason you should buy a stock, is because the company underlying it is
a good company with good long term prospects.


The last reason you should buy a stock is because you think the price is going to go up, (or sell because you
think the price is going to go down)


I know this sound counter-intuitive but in the short term it is practically impossible to predict reliably what will
happen to a stock's price.


Its like betting on the outcome of a football game. Anything can happen. But if your team is a good team, over
many games it will win many more games than an inferior team.


The stock market is full of companies who's stock price will be bid up by an irrational public. GMCR is one of
those companies.


Read the analysis presented above. When ever you find the company management stonewalling and
obfuscating the way this one is, you can almost guarantee its a good short.


In the short term you might make money, in the long term you are practically guaranteed to lose money.

facts.

Whitney,


If GMCR is overspending in cap-ex, doesn't it means a) high depreciation will eventually hit the bottom line - EPS b) if
it doesn't depreciation the high priced acquisitions then it will accumulate too much goodwill on its asset side.


Also it is rather unfair to compare cap-ex % of GMCR to food industry as a whole.


Not that I think GMCR is a buy here or it is not overvalued - but the arguments you provided is rather weak IMO.

Take a look at first 9 month cash flow statement--cap ex substantially reduced, company is gushing cash and buying
back stock. That part of Einhorn's thesis (which I relied on in shorting the stock) appears to be refuted.

I shorted this stock via short calls two years ago based on Einhorn's presentation. I could not very well assess the
patent issues or the inventory situation though those factors plus a sky high valuation supported his thesis. What
struck me at the time were the acquisitions and capital spending/cash flow that made me question whether the
company was profitable. When I looked at the financials for the first three quarters, it was striking how changed the
situation is. Cap spending is down substantially, the company is gushing cash and buying back shares. Bottom line:
valuation is high and accounting issues have not gone away, but I would be wary of shorting.

I'm probably one of the few but I have no problem waking up and getting through the day without any coffee; it really
shocks me how much coffee people consume with no sign of slowing. I really hope people's attitudes change about
coffee because it is definitely not healthy for you and the fact that you're paying such a ridiculous amount to harm
your health is downright stupid.

Coffee has many well documented health benefits. Like anything else, excess can be detrimental. Studies
have shown 2 or 3 cups a day improves several conditions. Some people have problems with caffeine, which
can be removed, so the caffeine concern is separate from the coffee. But this thread isn't about drinking
coffee, but buying shares of companies selling products to millions of people who you think aren't as smart as
you. One wonders if you're an investor or just a troll with lots of spare time?

The author seems to be hoping for a meltdown similar to the Gillette accounting & channel stuffing scandal in 1931.
Gillette's patent expiration in 1921 made no impact on the growth of the company. The stock market (and economic)
crash in the 1930s killed Gillette stock along with nearly all other stocks, but the company still went on to became one
of the most successful brands and stocks in history. The accounting scandal was no obstacle to its long-term growth.
In the long run this will be a marketing story. So far, the marketing has been extraordinary.


For a fund manager who gushes over Warren Buffett, it's surprising to see this type of speculation against a company
with a strong and growing consumer brand.

"For a fund manager who gushes over Warren Buffett, it's surprising to see this type of speculation against a

Which brand - do you mean the "Keurig" machine brand, or Tully's, Timothy's, Diedrich, etc?


Are you suggesting that these are strong and growing brands, in that they'll one day challenge/surpass
Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Folgers, etc?

Viva: Inane ridicule of short-term stock moves is best suited to the Blahoo boards. GMCR is expensively
priced; there's no denying that fact. The durability of the brand is where the author might have gone awry.

GMCR bulls always make the bear camp a tough room to work. However, Mr. Tilson raises some salient points and
his citing of Jesse Eisinger's compelling article, appropriate to the discussion.


It will be up to regulators to decide if accounting issues merit actionable consequence. Yet, the author makes a good
short case on valuation (29x earnings), especially for a company whose sales plummeted from outer space less than
two years ago.

The account issue has been targeted by the short for years. I will expect the new CEO (installed last Sept)
would correct the problem if there is a problem. What do you think as this is the major theme for short? For
valuation short, if it works, AMZN, NFLX, TSLA would be better candidates.

As I mentioned on another post, never stand between a coffee addict and his fix. When you see Mr. Coffee makers on
sale at garage sales for a dollar, one might think the market for the drip system is declining. It is hard to argue with
convenience, not to mention efficiency. How much coffee is thrown out when you have to make 4 cups in order for the
maker to produce decent coffee. And when, like myself, I have to wash the pot and the basket and notice I am
pouring out more coffee than I am drinking.

The trend is in place even though the PE is rich. There is no going back, other than to gain the fine taste of freshly
brewed using the more sophisticated equipment as shown on the Food Network, but then it is much more expensive
and will become a treat rather than a staple.  
The resilience of the stock maybe like that of the bumblebee, where physics says it can't fly, but the bumblebee
doesn't know it, so it just keeps flying.  
Yes, I am long GMCR. I am using monthly call options to provide some downside protection because I do that with
nearly all my investments. Competitors had better deliver flavor, or people will go back to what they like every time.  
OK Tilson, how much have you lost? You give new meaning to taking it in the shorts.

I haven't seen any mention in this thread of the recent reductions in coffee prices. It should improve margins for
GMCR and other manufacturers for a while.

GMCR's announcement of future expansion into soda drinks is a cause for concern for shareholders. The soda idea
has a large chance of being a failure and a diversionary waste of money. Just ask the managementt at Primo Water
(PRMW), who made a costly error by going into the home soda market and have more or less exited the business
with large losses. On the other hand, if GMCR succeeds in the home soda market, it will be another tribute to the
company's marketing skill--and another painful problem for short sellers.

I still see plenty of growth left in the K-cup market and Green Mountain brand loyalty in particular. Enjoy the recent
downdraft in the stock price, while it lasts. There are better short candidates out there than GMCR.

stock seems over priced, a lot, given it's lack of transparency, threats to it's business model and priving. But a short?
that's questionable. Mr Market can be crazy for a very very long time.
