A STOCK ONLY A TRADING
ROBOT COULD LOVE


Citron introduces Great Northern
Iron. (NYSE:GNI).
 


You absolutely won’t believe this:  A stock that is
going to die, for certain.   100% guaranteed — a
veritable ghost ship of a stock. No fraud, no
deception, no fad.  Simply a huge oversight by the
market.


Why is this stock di�erent from every other stock?
One simple fact: In exactly 4 years and 3 months, it
goes away. Period.


GNI is an iron ore mining trust set up by a railroad
baron primarily to provide a legacy for generations
of heirs. Twenty years following the death of the
last living heir (they are all explicitly named) in the
trust, the cash is divvied up, and the property
reverts, in this case to Conoco Phillips, that has
acquired the holding. That’s it. End of story. No
mystery. Its all right in the 10-K, where it’s been
printed every year for decades.


The devil is in the details.

The terms of the Great Northern Iron Ore
Properties Trust Agreement, created December
7, 1906, state that the Trust shall continue for
twenty years after the death of the last survivor
of eighteen persons named in the Trust
Agreement. The last survivor of these eighteen
persons died on April 6, 1995. Accordingly, the
Trust terminates twenty years from April 6,
1995, that being April 6, 2015.


At the end of the Trust on April 6, 2015, the
certi�cates of bene�cial interest (shares) in the
Trust will cease to trade on the New York Stock
Exchange and thereafter will represent only the
right to receive certain distributions payable to
the certi�cate holders of record at the time of
the termination of the Trust. Upon termination,
the Trust is obligated to distribute ratably to
these certi�cate holders the net monies
remaining in the hands of the Trustees (after
paying and providing for all expenses and
obligations of the Trust), plus the balance in the
Principal Charges account (this account is
explained in the Trust’s Annual Report sent to
all certi�cate holders every year). All other Trust
property (most notably the Trust’s mineral
properties and the active leases) must be
conveyed and transferred to the reversioner
(currently Glacier Park Company, a wholly
owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips) under the
terms of the Trust Agreement.


Check Please!
How do you value a company that is going away,
and surrendering its productive assets as it goes
into the sunset ? Runo� calculations take the
present value of future payment streams: 17
quarterly distributions plus about 8.53 in cash per
share when the trust is liquidated in April 2015.


So what does it earn? The last 3 calendar years, it
has earned 7.63 to 11.75 per share. The most
pro�table quarter in its history was the September
2010 quarter, in which it earned 3.50 per share.

So calculating the net present value of 18 quarters
of earnings from $3.00 to $5.00 per quarter, against
a discount rate of 2%, 4% or 6%, with a liquidating
payment thrown in, we see a range of present
values from $54.00, to at most (if the most
favorable discount rate is thrown at a quarterly
earning 50% higher than the company has ever
earned in its history) of ….. drum roll……$94.00.
Realistically, with execution and commodity pricing
risk rolled in, any value above $75.00 requires a
huge leap of faith.

So what is this stock doing north of

Possible ?
 


In a world where single-stock picking is rapidly
becoming extinct, drowned by the massive waves of
quant funds and computer generated trading, the
above detail – that this company is soon to become
extinct – has been entirely forgotten.


Don’t take our word for it: look how many times
GNI has been mentioned in these articles titled
“Best Yielding Stocks”, “Top Net Cash Flow
Stocks”….etc., where it is compared to other stocks
that …… well ….. won’t cease to exist on April 2015.
So the computers go about their merry way,

Every single one of these articles ignores the fatal
�aw in its investment premise — that this
company has ongoing enterprise value, which it
simply does not … it is going away — with date
certainty in 2015 — for an estimated liquidation
value of $8.53.


Conclusion:
The art and science of stock picking — which begins
by reading the �lings — is apparently Not Dead Yet. 
If you’re concerned about a possible run-up in the
price of iron ore negating the pro�t of this trade, we
suggest hedging with Mesabi Trust (NYSE:MSB)
