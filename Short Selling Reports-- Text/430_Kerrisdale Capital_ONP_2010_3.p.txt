Orient Paper: Loeb's Not the Right Firm for the Investigation
Jul. 22, 2010 5:54 AM ET156 comments
by: Chinese Company Analyst


Last week, Orient Paper (NYSEMKT:ONP) announced it would retain Loeb & Loeb to
conduct an independent investigation into the issues raised by Muddy Waters LLC.


While I welcome the third-party investigation, Loeb & Loeb is not the right firm for the job. I
don’t intend to discredit Loeb & Loeb’s credentials. But given their active involvement in
the Chinese Reverse Takeover (RTO) space, they are neither independent nor objective
when it comes to whether a Chinese RTO is defrauding investors. Rather, they are firmly
entrenched in the “club” of service providers that earn substantial fees from Chinese
companies that have listed publicly in the United States through reverse takeovers of U.S.
shell companies.


A service provider such as Loeb & Loeb is financially incentivized to conclude that Orient
Paper is not making up its numbers. Failing confidence in Chinese RTOs could lead to
materially reduced revenue for the firm's Chinese securities practice.


I’m not alleging any past, present or future wrongdoing on the part of Loeb & Loeb. I’m
merely saying that Loeb & Loeb is not a genuinely independent party; they are not the
appropriate law firm to perform a third party investigation into whether Orient Paper is
falsifying its financial statements; and I and other critics are unlikely to be satisfied with an
investigation led by Loeb & Loeb that exempts ONP from wrongdoing.


If Orient Paper is serious about having third parties investigate critics’ claims, they should
hire a law firm that is not actively involved in the Chinese RTO space, and can act as a
more objective investigator. I provide dozens of potential law firms at the bottom of this
article.


Loeb & Loeb’s Active Involvement in Chinese RTOs


Loeb & Loeb is one of the leading law firms in providing legal counsel to Chinese
companies that undergo RTOs, or merge with SPACs, to become public in the United
States. They are also one of the top firms that provide legal counsel to the investment
banks and PIPE investors who provide banking services or capital to these companies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 2/60


As they write in their website, “In 2009, Loeb & Loeb LLP’s Corporate Securities practice,
notable for taking many of the first private Chinese companies public on U.S. stock
exchanges, completed 33 major transactions totaling approximately $2.1 billion in 2009”.
For press releases from Loeb & Loeb discussing their strength in Chinese RTOs, see here
and here.


Loeb & Loeb is a sponsor of many conferences that focus on Chinese RTOs. They
sponsored CCG's China Rising Conference this year and last year. They are sponsoring
the Roth China Conference this year, and sponsored the 2009 and 2008 Roth
conferences as well. They sponsored The Dealflow Reverse Merger 2010 Conference in
June.


The lead partner of the China practice, Mitch Nussbaum, is a regular on the China RTO
circuit. He speaks on panels regularly with other key service providers of Chinese RTOs -
see here, here and here. In this link, for instance, Nussbaum speaks at a 2:15pm panel
moderated by Crocker Coulson, ONP's investor relations representative. Two hours
earlier, ONP board member Drew Bernstein gave his own speech at the event. It's difficult
to imagine a scenario where Loeb & Loeb accuses ONP of fraud, when Bernstein has
called the allegations "categorically false and without merit" and Coulson has been
coordinating ONP's public responses to the charges of fraud.


Nor has Loeb been able to sidestep some of the controversies among Chinese RTOs. For
the September equity offering for China Natural Gas (OTC:CHNG), which was alleged to
be a fraud by the blog “Worthless Pennies”, Loeb & Loeb was legal counsel to the
underwriters. For the April equity offering for Lihua International (NASDAQ:LIWA), which
has been flagged by Chimin Sang and Steve Chapski as potentially falsifying its financial
statements, Loeb & Loeb was legal adviser to the company.


A Genuinely Independent Third Party should Be Picked Instead


I don’t think Loeb & Loeb should be chosen to investigate the serious allegations of fraud
that have been charged against Orient Paper. A law firm with a Chinese office that is not
actively involved with Chinese RTOs should be selected to conduct the investigation. Loeb
& Loeb is not sufficiently independent. They generate substantial fees from Chinese
companies that have undertaken RTOs to become publicly listed in the United States.
They have a vested financial interest in seeing that Chinese RTOs are cleared of
wrongdoing, generally speaking.


Here is a list of the top 25 foreign firms in the “Corporate/M&A” practice in China, as
selected by “The Legal 500”.

Also, is a law firm even the best organization to conduct an investigation. Law firms are generally hired to investigate
because they have attorney-client privilege and don't have to reveal what they find. Law firms are generally not the
best investigators because they represent the client. Entities that are in the investigative profession would be much
better, but they wouldn't have the cover of the attorney-client privilege.

Thanks again, Yahoo, for linking to a article written by a self-interested, anonymous blogger with zero credentials.


A few points


1) You are talking out of both sides of your mouth, presumably to avoid a defamation lawsuit and to further drive down
the stock's price. On the one hand, you say that you're NOT arguing that Loeb has ever or will ever commit fraud, but
on the other hand, you're saying that they have the financial interests and the connections such that it's likely that they
will commit fraud. So which one is it? Either you're saying Loeb, a firm with no reputation of integrity issues, is or isn't
going to commit a fraud. What are you afraid that they are going to do? Encourage the Big Four Auditor to falsify
documents? Encourage the auditor to overlook things? Nothing is going to happen by accident. Face it, you are
alleging that Loeb is going to commit fraud, and that is a statement without any basis and is completely reckless and
defamatory.


2) As stated above, the law firm does NOT have unilateral control over the audit. They are hiring a big four
independent auditor. For the Big Four auditor to risk destroying their reputations to help Loeb build a small part of their
business would be absurd.


3) Loeb is a big international law firm with a 100 year reputation of excellence and no integrity problems. They are not
going to risk destroying their reputation in hopes of developing a tiny practice area. Moreover, the type of supposed
conflict you describe happens all the time in large law firms. Many law firms conduct independent investigations on

certain companies and represent companies in the very same, even narrow, industry without any problems. If you
have a problem with this "conflict" why don't you contact the NY Bar Association and tell them and see if they believe
this violates the Bar's conflict of interest rules? I guarantee you, they will say thanks and you'll never hear about it
again. There is no conflict.


4) Your double standards are amazing. You think that we ought to believe allegations made by Muddy Waters, a self
interested pair of guys who absolutely no record or history. You expect us to believe you, an anonymous blogger with
also no record or history. But somehow, we should automatically dismiss the work of a law firm with a 100 year history
of excellence and a Big Four auditing company? Not to mention BDO, the audit firm that's already reviewed all of
ONP's accounting. You love to say, let's focus on the facts and not the people, but now you're saying that you wont
believe anything that comes out of this investigation because one partner at Loeb is trying to build business in China?
This is complete and utter garbage.


22 Jul 2010, 08:14 AM


Chinese Company Analyst, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The basic point of the article is that Loeb & Loeb is not an objective party and that it has a
self-interest in this investigation. A law firm that is not receiving large amounts of fees from helping Chinese
companies go public through RTOs, and underwriting their secondary equity offerings, would be a more
independent third party.


I see your arguments, but my underlying point is very simple. If ONP wants to conduct an independent and
objectively-conducted third party investigation, then it should strive to hire independent and objective third
parties.

Loeb and Loeb are lawyers, they are not going to do any of the auditing, those are left to accountants. They
are going to be investigating the legal side, meaning they are going to be looking into legal options against
Muddy Waters. You are suppose to hire someone on your side.


A big four auditor will be doing the accounting verification. How much more impartial can you get than hiring
one of the big four? I would prefer it if the SEC did the investigation, they are more impartial. But realistically,
getting one of the big four is the best that can be done.

For sure Muddy Waters and Chinese company analyst are one in the same. One would have to be naive to think
otherwise. They (He) are now reaching for ideas at the bottom of the barrel. What next ? The color of the CEO's
underwear ? The insinuation that Mitch Nusbaum from Loeb and Loeb would do something unethical to help any one
company at the expense of jeopardizing his own career is utter nonsense. Other than Piper, no one else on the list
knows what RTO stands for !

The “arguments” the anonymous author of this blog makes could be destroyed by any student in an introduction to
logic class.


The messaging: 
Trust a bunch of random guys who are shorting a stock and have a direct financial benefit to exaggerate their claims
and look for scare tactics. Trust me, some anonymous author, I am in a similar position, i.e. if you listen, I will make a
lot more money. Don’t’ trust a well known and respected law firm with many years experience who would get in real
trouble for doing something so blatantly unethical.


The anonymous author should make his point more directly. If this anonymous author believes ONP is doing
something so blatantly wrong, can Loeb & Loeb ignore the fraud without committing fraud themselves? So is this
anonymous author claiming Loeb & Loeb will ignore it for financial benefit or won’t.


I don’t think this anonymous author can consistently claim that: 
1. ONP is committing large scale Fraud. (See anonymous author’s previous article.) 
2. Loeb & Loeb will not commit any Fraud “I’m not alleging any past, present or future wrongdoing on the part of Loeb
& Loeb.” 
3. Loeb & Loeb will not report on the ONP’s Fraud. “they are not the appropriate law firm to perform a third party
investigation into whether Orient Paper is falsifying its financial statements.”


I suggest this anonymous author come out of his hiding and say what he thinks. You will need to modify one of the
above arguments. Your choices are: 
1. ONP is only changing minor things in their books that can be ignored by an auditor. 
2. Loeb & Loeb will purposefully ignore large scale fraud for financial gain. 
3. Loeb & Loeb will report on the fraud I allege exists. (In which case ignore above article the anonymous author
posted.)

Simple question, yes or no answer please. Do you have any evidence Loeb and Loeb has committed fraud?

22 Jul 2010, 10:08 AM


Chinese Company Analyst, Contributor
Author’s reply »  No. "I’m not alleging any past, present or future wrongdoing on the part of Loeb & Loeb."


At the end of the day, the investigators could theoretically wash their hands and say that they saw "no
evidence" of wrongdoing, even if the fraud is patently obvious to any objective observer. If ONP gives all
parties forged documents, the investigators can say "Hey, we saw the documents and they looked real to us."
The only parties committing fraud would be ONP, not the third parties. So I'm not sure that Loeb and Loeb
would be necessarily committing fraud if their conclusion of the investigation showed that they saw no
evidence of wrongdoing.


But this is all conjecture. Again, I'm not implying what Loeb is going to do or what they've done. All I'm saying
is that ONP should pick a more objective and independent law firm to run its investigation.

about stocks he doesn't like (obviously has short positions on those) - how convenient. The other "source" states he
trades infrequently, then mainly as SHORT positions. Even Muddy Waters stated in the first paragraph of their
Disclaimer how they would stand "to realize significant gains in the event that the price of the stock declines." So they
would have no reason whatsoever to make any type of positive statement about ONP. More to the point, ONP is not
having Loeb & Loeb conduct the audit themselves, they are being retained to hire one of the Big Four auditing firms.
To that end, I don't believe one of these auditing companies would purposely falsify information for a MicroCap
company such as ONP when it could potentially ruin them. There's a reason why they are the Big Four now, instead
of the Big Five. They wouldn't want to have another repeat of what happened to the other auditing company that had
been part of the Big Five.

taken to court as well.

One other point, with Muddy Waters having a short position on ONP, if they owned the stocks when they were at
$8.43 as per their report date, then they have already made a sizeable profit from nothing more than feeding off the
fears of other investors. Does anyone else really want to help line their pockets with their/our money? I don't.

CCA: You should consider expressing your specific ONP fraud concerns to Loeb & Loeb. Loeb & Loeb, as well as the
hired audit firm, need to be aware of exactly what to look for, what data is needed, and how to analyze that data. It
would be a shame to have these firms conduct due diligence, only to miss key points in your argument, leaving you

The supposed article published didn't translate when I tried using the MSN translator. I was only able to see
references to "Moody Water" (?) in it. Secondly, the translation by Muddy Waters was provided "in-house". Hmm. All it
was, was a reference to an on-line poll. I repeat, an ON-LINE POLL. The reference to a tax bureau insider is vague -
was it a U.S. bureau insider? Or a PRC insider? And if HBOP really did overstate revenue and taxes paid by almost
400%, and this was know by the SEC, wouldn't there be some kind of news about that? It just seems there's as many
questions about the "investigation" conducted by Muddy Waters as those raised by them. Again, I would obviously
take anything a company with a SHORT position has in another company with a large grain of salt.

Hi, thanks for those good points.


I'm still waiting for the first person to actually tackle all of the critical points raised by Muddy Waters, which definitely
convinced me. Like many people here, I was convinced by the Street's Pearson that his was a good deal, but the film
and pictures of his visit displayed stunning amateurism, hidden behind a facade of "the winter storm". Muddy Waters
didn't just stop there, they used their gut feeling to check the facts. They have spent an enormous amount of time and
effort researching all the aspects of the business and of what they were told by management, about a 1000% percent
more than Pearson, who thinks he will just get all the information from filings and management, without doing any
work or spend any time checking all the facts later. Pitiful Pearson who said in his reply that he was struck by how few
questions they asked. It strikes me how little critical research Pearson


If you still hold the stock, it must be because you haven't read the actual report. READ IT, then look at the poor quality
of the replies.

Next consider that there are many, much safer, untarnished investment opportunities.


While they've surely also made mistakes there report goes much deeper than any of the superficial notes, such as
those of Pearson, who's all about pump and dump. I'm still waiting for the first time Pearson actually stating that he
dumped his shares. He would be a real sucker if he's still holding this one.


PS: look at the Pearson movie of Sun Group High-Tech, another of his recommendation of his, and looking equally
very amateurish. Also, no more word on China Carbon Graphite Group Inc, after it fell almost as soon as he
recommended it.... The list of his blunders if very long. Just don't listen to him... ever. It's going to cost you money.

The length of your response is fishy. Why put in all that effort to convince people to sell a stock that you have
no interest in?


Very fishy.

Where is this alleged fraud taking place? I live in China and plan on visiting ONP in August. I don't have a track record
as a stock anaylist but I am a factory manager in china so I know a thing or two about capacity. I recall reading
comments about falsifying capacity and overstating the cost of some new equipment. Is there a source for this data?

Bzwunski: Check the last 5 or 6 articles on Yahoo finance finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ONP , specifically
seekingalpha.com/artic... .


The fraud thing may be becoming out of hand. Using ONP's stockholder equity for 2009 at 56 million and divide by
11.78 million publicly traded shares gives a book value of $4.70, about its closing price.

Trying to make some sense of all this. Going back to some of the argument points previously brought up.  
1) Muddy Waters tried contacting ONP's top 10 customers. A cleaning lady answered the phone at one of them during
business hours. Seriously? That would be like a janitor answering the phone at a company here in the U.S. Why

would the cleaning lady, of all people, answer the phone at a company? I find this one hard to believe. 
2) The aforementioned companies could not possibly generate the revenue needed to order the volume reported in
the filings. Again, this "due diligence" seems somewhat questionable. Who exactly did they talk to at the companies
they contacted? Was it a higher level executive? Even if the person(s) from Muddy Waters identified themselves as
reporters/potential investors, chances are they're probably similar in the way they conduct daily business inquiries, not
permitted to divulge financial information; anyplace I've ever worked at it was strictly forbidden to talk about specific
numbers with anyone we did not recognize as being a fellow employee. Really, if some complete stranger from
another country were to ask you how much money you make in a year, or how much money you spent every year on
some expense like clothing, would you give a straight forward answer? 
3) The investment bank stated by ONP, ROTH Capital Partners, did have an analyst visit the company's principal
operations in the past 12 months; as stated on page 162 in their (ROTH's) China Source research report dated May
11, 2010. So, there have been at least 4 different visits to the company's operations - the ROTH analyst, Eric Jackson
in March, the gentlemen from Muddy Waters, and Doug Irstad of Wall Street Media (apologies if I misspelled his last
name) just earlier today. Odd that of the four visits, only the gentlemen from Muddy Waters appear to have come
away with a negative impression. Coincidence that they have (and emphasis on STILL HAVE) a short position? I
guess I'd take their negative report more seriously if they had, or would have, a neutral position on this particular
stock - with nothing to gain financially if the price of this stock goes down. 
Basically, I think we should avoid jumping to any negative conclusions - especially since ONP appears to be trying to
right by its investors and will have an independent 3rd party auditor (in the form of one of the Big Four) conduct its
own audit.


23 Jul 2010, 04:15 AM


Van Gastel
You don't get it, do you. Muddy Waters just went much further in their research than any of the others.
Obviously you didn't read the report, like all the other people asking such questions...


23 Jul 2010, 02:35 PM


CSMhater
Whoah! Calm down. I didn't say Muddy Waters is lying, I was just pointing out there was some questions
about their own investigation into ONP. And yes, I did read the report - hence my previous reference to their
very first paragraph being a disclaimer about Muddy Waters standing to "realize significant gains in the event
that the price of the stock declines." Back to the points, nowhere in the report did it state who they talked to -
that's why I asked that question. The report only states they spoke with XYZ company who told them they
generated X amount of revenue. Did Muddy Waters get the name of the person and their job title of said
companies? If they did, it wasn't stated in the report. To me, that would be a basic staple of any type of
investigation, when writing a report you state your sources - not done in this particular instance. Muddy
Waters was very diligent in stating other sources in their report, which is why this particular omission stands
out to me. On page 11 of Muddy Waters' report they state "larger companies would be easier to contact, and
with some relationship building efforts, likely to disclosure that ONP's claims of purchase volume are false."
Note the statement of "relationship building efforts" in order for the companies to be truthful of volume
purchase. It would seem a safe assumption they (Muddy Waters) believe most companies they contact would

initially not be forthcoming in divulging such information. Yet we are supposed to believe the companies they
contacted were telling them the truth about sensitive financial information to someone who works for a start-
up company they had never heard of? My point is, one of Muddy Waters' main argument is the falsification of
volume generated by orders from their top 10 customers. Their "due diligence" seems extensive on the
surface, however, looking at it closer, questions about their methods seems to raise questions of their own.
Finally, on page 29 of Muddy Waters report, they stated themselves they were "willing to accept a thesis that
there is a strong underlying business with some investor money being skimmed." Really? They were willing to
initially recommend "ONP as a possible Strong Buy" even knowing some INVESTOR MONEY was being
skimmed? And to that point, how much skimming were they willing to let slide, to look the other way on? 2%?
5%? 10%? Please tell me what you feel would be an acceptable amount of skimming. To me, that's a slippery
slope to start going down on - once you start to compromise your principals, where do you stop? Like I've
stated before, I feel Muddy Waters appears to have raised some legitimate concerns, but by their own words,
they have made it difficult to accept everything they reported on at face value. Again, I have no stock position
on this company. I'll wait for the confirmation that ONP has reached an agreement with one of the Big Four
auditing firms before reinvesting in this company.

I hope everyone has watched the new video by Doug who made a surprise visit. It is clearly a much bigger operation
than Muddy Waters would have us believe. It is a huge campus which could easily have 600 employees and there
were trucks going in and out.

That should put a lot of questions to rest.


And also, Rick Pearson is coming out with a response next week.


23 Jul 2010, 09:26 AM


Van Gastel
Now, that is real business with lots of new elements, good news for ONP, an unannounced visit and the full
cooperation of management. That should alleviate a good deal of the worries, and is any way a much much
better response than all the simply dismissive comments on the MW reports. Thanks for that good news and
sharing your efforts with us.

wsmco.com/show.aspx:


issues with the video:


1. Where are all the production lines? 
the video shows only 2 or 3 production lines but there are supposed to be 7 or 8 production lines. (8 according to their
last 10k, 7 according to their recently changed website).


2. Where are all the employees? 
there are only about 40 or 50 employees shown in the video but there are supposed to be 600 employees. The
pictures of the grounds looks relatively vacant. Hardly any people seen. At the headquarters, only see about 1 car
parked in the parking lot.


3. What happened to the count of trucks? 
Narrator says in the beginning he was going to count the trucks going in and out but that never happns.


4. Where is the disclosures about building plans? 
the video shows plans for building large buildings, not explained whether facilities for producing paper, does look like
buildings to house people. Not aware of disclosures in SEC filings that planning to do this building. We saw the
alleged plans - explain what is being built. What is the cost? When will it be completed? What is it for?


5. Where is the information to answer the questions? 
Virtually no specific information is provided. Why no questions of the CEO.


A video like this would be simple to do to show legitimate operations. First, show the operations by going through
each step of the papermaking process, having the CEO explain in, and showing it in the video. Then show each
production line, the type of paper it makes, the amount it makes each day. In the process, you should also show the
hundreds and hundreds of employees. 
This was a great chance to follow up and asked questions about the issues raised by Muddy waters and others. None
of them was addressed in this video. 
Take a look at as many videos or in person visits to real operating facilities while in action. Do any of them appear as
barren as these? 
Finally, no offense to the narrator, but how does this guy sound to you? Does this look like a relatively barren place
where they staged activity?

Legitimate questions.. and if you were sitting around in your car just observing trucks and activity, why was it
not possible to state precisely what you saw going on, e.g. trucks moving in and out, as this is precisely one
of the things that Muddy Waters tackle in their report. Sounds like you've been waiting there for nothing.
Count yourself lucky you weren't arrested for espionage.


Indeed many of the MW questions are not answered in specifics (obviously they have superior research and
reporting skills to all the other analysts), but as I said, it does alleviate a very great deal of the worries, but is
short on specifics, facts and numbers....

i dont know about you but i saw a good 150+ employees just in the 3 the production lines he went through. Multiple
security guards dozens of employees scattered around each building producing the paper, this doesnt account for
maintenance either. You all are so quick to believe a company who is shorting this stock for what reasons? Because
they talked to some cleaning lady? Good proof if you keep investing on reasons as solid as that you will be sure to
never turn a profit. Hold your shorts!! Sounds like a great plan. Ill go with video evidence that this company who is
being accused of fraud is giving tours of its facilities? Seems legit to me, and why would a company that doesnt need
to expand be expanding to a new thousand acre plant? To just throw money away?

Bzwnski: 
I think ONP is a fraud, based on my own work independent of Muddy Waters. I think the PIPE investors may
have been aware when they invested but may have shorted to lock in the difference between the market price
and any discount they got on their shares and/or may have worked the pump and dump scam. In any event,
they may be all sold out by now. 
So, the investors motive now would not be to drive down the price of the stock and get it on the cheap, but
rather to have the necessary conditions occur to get the 3 million shares, or a portion thereof, for nothing.
One of those conditions is if ONP's net profit doesn't meet the minimum net profit requirement, approximately
$18 million, or is $0. The lower the net profit, the more shares the investors get. 
Could the investors have known it was a fraud and be paying Muddy Waters to bring the fraud to light? That is
certainly a possibility. Might the investors also have shorted, or purchased the equivalent options? Perhaps,
certianly it has been done before. However, I have no idea of the answers to these questions. 
If the answers were yes, the new directors have someone else to blame for the necessity of them calling for

an investigation, the new directors could look good afterwards for having called for the investigation, the CEO
could be blamed and dismissed, and maybe the company rehabilitated for perhaps another pump and dump
scam or other shenanigans. 
I have no idea if any of this is occuring but you raised a similar possibility and asked for my thoughts.
Remember the possibility, ONP either $0 net profit for the year (or, if investors get the shares if ONP doesn't
timely report, then that option is a possibility as well), CEO blamed and removed, investors with $3 million
shares, damage control with attorneys and Deloitte financial advisory services, and ONP repitched again. 
Just guessing but see if it doesn't come true not year, except that last point. Another twist could be for the
investors to pump up the stock and short it before they possibly get $3 million shares, then they could have
more bad news and have the stock drop further and profit. I am sure many other twists are possible as well. 
Not saying any of this will happen and these investors would do any such thing. Just know that you can find
stories like this by reading cases SEC prosecutes. Like reading about false flag operations or double agent
stories, those have nothing on the shenanigans that go on in the investment field. Funny, you can find names
of people prosecuted and either fined or found guilty residing at even large hedge funds and investment firms
without doing too much work on the internet. 
Whether Muddy Waters was paid or not, there are very serious problems with the SEC filings of this company
such that their representations could not be true. That is why I repeatedly advise to look at the facts and
evidence and reason soundly therefrom.

Mr. Door: 
There are not anywhere near 150 employees shown in the video. Multiple security guards and dozens of employees
that you reference adds up to 40 to 50 employees shown that I estimate (assuming they are actually employees and
not just hired to stage for the day). 
Other than that, you don't address any of the points I raise. Alleged expansion is not necessarily a good thing - it
could be used as an excuse to raise and confiscate capital instead of doing expansions. Expansions also can result in
big losses of money. 
Of concern though is that expansions like this, if they are planned, should have been disclosed in SEC filings,
including those for hte recent capital raise. What are they specifically planning to build, what does it cost, when will it
be completed. These are questions that investors want answered because many companies have gone broke doing
unwise expansions. 
I am not quick to believe anything, that is why I look at everything with a critical eye, including this video, authored by
a person who is long the stock and has prior posts promoting it. 
Disclosure: short onp.

I have a very basic question directed mainly at the gentlemen of Muddy Waters - if you truly believe ONP is
committing fraud, why would you own stock in that company in the first place? To me it seems a bit two-faced: "Yeah,
I believe ONP is committing fraud and are misleading the investors, but I might as well profit from trying to bring about
their downfall." Am I the only one who sees the irony of that particular situation? I would think if they wanted to take
the high road, they would have come out with their "investigation" results and simply invested their money in a
different company they believe is on the level, instead of trying to run a smear campaign and line their own pockets
with it.

Loeb is hired to get an accountant on board to investigate the books. i believe your article is only written to help the
value go deeper so you can make a profit. 
Your article is going beside the point in the whole affair: ONP is willing to be investigated and get a reliable
independent accountancy company to check the books

damaging a company while making a profit. vultures!

I stand corrected on that technicality - although "borrow" by definition means to acquire temporarily. Which is
what Muddy Waters is doing by taking a short position on this company - they made that statement in the very
first paragraph of their report. So we're splitting hairs on that issue. The point I was trying to make is this: was
Muddy Waters' results supported by their investigation? Or was their investigation just to support the results
they already had in mind? I only question if their motives were altruistic. It's easy to make the facts support
the path you want to go down, harder to go down the path where the facts lead you. ONP claims Muddy
Waters came to them first and wanted a king's ransom to write a favorable report about them, but they
refused. I bring this up because like I previously stated, there has been 4 separate visits by different parties to
their facilities. Of the 4, only Muddy Waters came away with a negative impression; maybe they're the only
experts in paper production and would therefore know better than the other 3 parties that visited. Maybe each
visitor saw what they wanted to see, I don't know. As for some of their other claims, like a cleaning lady
answering the phone during business hours? That seems a bit outlandish. If the company was that small,
then surely one of the other part-time employees would have been able to answer the phone. Granted,
Muddy Waters does bring up what appears to be valid concerns - and ONP appears to have valid responses.
However, this has turned into a "he said, she said" battle of words between the two companies. I no longer
have any position on this particular stock (sold it at a nice profit, but not by short-ing it), but am watching what
happens with a close eye for possible future investment opportunities. I will say this, if ONP does not make an
announcement within a week about which of the Big Four auditing firms will conduct an audit, then I would
have to agree that there appears to be some type of smoke-and-mirrors tricks going on with that company (it's
already been a week since they stated they would hire one of the Big Four firms, and really, how long should
it take to come to at least a preliminary agreement with an auditing firm? Especially if ONP is watching its
stock price plummet). If they are eventually exonerated by whichever auditing firm, I'd be more than happy
take the findings at face value and invest in them again. Although I get the impression some people (i.e.
ChineseCompanyAnalyst, Muddy Waters) still wouldn't be convinced.


24 Jul 2010, 02:20 AM


Willem55
Please read the news on Yahoo, where ONP stated they would hire Loeb to get them a accountant that is
independant. its there for everyone to see, so my comment is not unsubstantiated at all. 
the best approach here is buy more ONP because they will go up again and this proved to be true yesterday
with aftermarket trading going higher. 
disclosure: I am long ONP based on a independent investment report from a source that did visit the
company, when muddy waters started to muddy the water i bought more stocks. And they are going in the
right direction.  
vultures can only be killed in 1 manner and at low costs and no time wasting: feed them poison. I hope this
whole indecent negative publishing campaign of them is blowing up in their faces.  
They could and should be sued for slander and taken to court to nail them but that's for ONP or the oversight

I will not participate in this discussion anymore. Because this discussion will lead to nothing than frustrations and
angry faces on both sides. The Muddy Brothers made their case and now the only thing we can do is to wait who is
right.


For me short-selling (as opposed to selling to liquidate a long position) is 100% immoral since you are acting counter
to the interests of the party that actually owns the shares that you are selling short, although mostly legal. Naked
short-selling is illegal in addition to being immoral. A short sale is the sale of something that you do not own. You may
be able to "borrow" shares to sell them short, but that is usually somebody's broker "loaning" shares of a customer
who has a long position that is "held in street name" without informing them of that "loan" or in any way compensating
for either the "value" of the "loan" of the stock or any of the loss that results from the downwards pressure on price
from the short sale. This is all legal, but still 100% immoral, unless you have the moral values of a Wall Street trader.


I would be tempted to say that short-sellers have the moral values of a piece of dog poop, but that would be an insult
to dog poop. In my personal hierarchy of moral values, short sellers and the brokerage firms that "enable" them have
moral values somewhere well below the moral values of al Qaeda.


Sure, non-naked short-selling is still legal, but slavery and a lot of other barbaric practices were also legal at some
point, so being technically legal is no justification of moral value. Contributing to the detriment and even destruction of
the economic value of a portion of the real economy (since each short sale does place downwards pressure on the
stock price and stock price is a key factor in a company's ongoing ability to raise capital) is clearly immoral. But, some
people clearly place a high value of short-term "financial" profit even if it comes at the expense of real economic
"value."


The additional downwards pressure of short selling during times of financial and economic stress can also damage
the ability of normal, average, everyday retail investors with 401K accounts to withstand the dire fear-mongering
promoted by short-sellers.

These innocent retail investors end up selling at the worst time.


Short-sellers add no productive value to their finances or their lives. How much more immoral does an activity need to
be before we acknowledge that it is anti-economic, anti-social and plain old immoral? How can we consider such
harm to individuals as anything other than immoral?


A short-seller may eventually "cover" their "short sale", technically known as "buy to close" or "short covering", but as
a general proposition that hardly compensates society or the economy for any economic destruction of value that may
have occurred in the interim. Just because short sales eventually are covered or closed in no way makes up for the
interim period where non-owners are interfering with the ability of a company to raise capital in the capital markets.
The harm has already been done.


I rest my case and wish you all good luck with the Muddy Brothers Gang.

you won't be able to use margin in the account.

Reply. Short sellers are often on the front lines finding serious problems with stocks. That's a service to all of
us. See Enron, WorldCom, and many of the restatements/fraud in the Chinese RTO market. Are all short
sellers angels? No. That's why we have to look at the facts, of which you are not providing many.


This story is not over yet. But it sure would be useful to see more verifiable facts from the longs supporting
their position. The video posted yesterday raised more questions than it answered IMHO. The guy presented
no hard numbers (i.e. # of trucks leaving facility, production per machine, etc) that could have put most of
these allegations to rest.

I'll second that. (Seasaw's point)


Dutch Trader: what are your thoughts on # of production lines, # of employees, # of R&D staff, how they've edited
statements on their website over the last week, and other facts that have been raised by Seasaw? Do you have any
doubts about the company after objectively comparing the MW et all allegations and the ONP et all replies?


I've got no stake in this stock one way or the other. Just keeping tabs on this out of curiosity.


While we're still waiting to see the final verdict, it seems those on the "short" side of this story are bringing facts to the
table. You seem more content with discrediting the messengers.


23 Jul 2010, 06:05 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Dutch Trader: 
Okay, so your point has nothing to do with ONP specifically, you just have a problem with short selling generally. I
don't have a problem with short selling. I don't believe that selling short is acting counter to the person who owns the
shares. In fact, if the company is really a good company, the person that owns the shares has an opportunity to buy
the shares from the short seller. If the company has done so well that people will not sell except for a higher price, the
owner of the shares has the opportunity to sell for a higher price when the short seller has to cover or buy back the
shares. 
Most good companies make money or have cash flow to fund their operations. Raising capital is necessary for
expansion - which may or may not be a good idea - or for funding current operations when those operations haven't
been able to fund themselves. Economic value is not automatically created when capital is raised - it can be created
or, as it often is, it can be destroyed. 
What is clearly immmoral - and I am surprised that you don't address this is a more serious fashion - is fraud by a
company to transfer wealth from purchasers of its shares to themselves. Short sellers sometimes do a service is
helpfing to short circuit these frauds earlier than would occur otherwise and save investors from losing money they
otherwise would have lost. 
Where is your moral outrage for companies that have looted and pillaged money from their shareholders for their own
gain and economic benefit? Although many capital raises have been beneficial, there have also been a great many
capital raises that have stolen money from purchasers of stock, such that it is a red flag to investors to examine the
capital raises for the value they have added to or detracted from the company. It is very suspicious when a company
repeatedly does capital raises and is unable to fund its operations from its own earnings. Often, the company either is
losing money such that it shouldn't be in business or it is looting from shareholders. In those cases, short sellers can
be helpful to put an end to these practices earlier than otherwise would occur.

Some forms of short-selling may be legal (currently), but legality is never a moral justification in my opinion. No
amount of excuses can erase or balance out the inherent immorality of selling something that you do not own along
with the negative economic and social consequences that can result from that attempt to "make a fast buck".


Of course there are enough arguments that argue and explain that short selling can be good, some points you
mentioned already.


But for me as Roman Catholic it is also a moral question.


23 Jul 2010, 06:48 PM


A. Hendrick
Let's leave the morality issue aside for now. It's irrelevant to the evidence put forth by Seasaw on ONP (which you
conveniently fail to address in any of your posts).


23 Jul 2010, 07:00 PM


Dutch Trader, Contributor
I agree with Seasaw that fraud by a company is immoral, but we are talking about short selling. Seasaw
mentions that short sellers sometimes do a service in helping to discover a fraud and to preventing investors
losing more money. "Sometimes" that is true, but "most of the times" they don't do this out of moral reasons
but just to make money.


And for those in the financial markets who are "morally-challenged", I would put forward the following simple
test: simply imagine if your neighbor did something equivalent in the real world (outside of Wall Street and
"the markets") - would you conclude that they are "a good person"? If a neighbor or person who you do not
know "borrowed" your car without your permission and returned it badly damaged and killed or badly injured
several pedestrians and other motorists while driving your car (again, without your permission), would you say
that their behavior was consistent with being "a moral person"?


It has been said that if you leave your securities with a broker you can ask to have them delivered to you so
no one can short them. True enough (I think), but that simply is not true for retirement accounts. No such
option is made available to customers with retirement accounts, such as 401K and IRA Keogh accounts or for
mutual funds. I would also note that no broker that I have ever heard of discloses the short-selling aspect of
keeping stock "in street name." Sure, a lot of people may informally know that, but it isn't even recorded in
writing or in any official documents of brokerage firms on the Internet.


23 Jul 2010, 07:16 PM

Again, you fail to address any of the discrepancies brought to light by Seasaw regarding the companies 10Ks,
R&D staff, production lines, etc. and instead focus on the morality of short selling.

Dutch Trader: 
I am not sure that you are in agreement with the Catholic Church on short selling. I do not believe that the Catholic
Church has ever declared or considered short selling to be immoral or any kind of sin. We can write and get the
official catholic position on it if you doubt what I am saying. Certainly, many catholics, including clergy, have shorted
and are shorting stocks. 
Again, I addressed your claim of negative economic and social consquences and you have not responded to my
points. At this point, this is just a conclusory statement by you without support. 
As far as making a quick buck - it is much easier to lose money shorting and very hard to make money at it.
Historically, people long stock do better than those that short it, so it is not generally an easy, quick buck. As far as
selling something you don't own, you have borrowed it and are obigated to buy it back and return it. How is this
different than a company borrowing money and giving it another company to purchase equipment to attempt to profit
and then pay back the money? Is that immoral as well? 
Some forms of short-selling may be legal (currently), but legality is never a moral justification in my opinion. No
amount of excuses can erase or balance out the inherent immorality of selling something that you do not own along
with the negative economic and social consequences that can result from that attempt to "make a fast buck".

I have seen a number of arguments (and even formal academic papers) in favor of short-selling over the years and
some of them do superficially "sound good", but superficial is not good enough. It is usually deep down in the
assumptions were the problems lie. A lot of cute and clever logic and reasoning means nothing if the assumptions are
bogus. Bogus assumption #1: "If used responsibly, in moderation, and according to law..." Well, I guess that
eliminates 99% of short-selling.


I will stop now this discussion and will also not reply anymore because it has nothing to with the topic "Loeb's not the
right firm for the investigation anymore".

The purpose of short selling is to hedge your position and to limit your downside risk.


However people like "Waldo mushm." and "ChineseCompanyAnalyst" use this tool to scare and create panic
and benefit from it. That is unethical and should be made illegal.


These people should be investigated and punished if proven guilty.

Seasaw you are a smooth talker but you never came with arguments or facts to confront me with the following. We
both know that fraud by a company is immoral, but we are talking about short selling. Seasaw mentions that short
sellers sometimes do a service in helping to discover a fraud and to preventing investors losing more money.
"Sometimes" that is true, but "most of the times" they don't do this out of moral reasons but just to make money.

I know that it is legal. We are talking about the fact if it is moral or not? Especially in the case of false accusations. 
If Muddy Waters was wrong in their findings, you would find it moral? 


24 Jul 2010, 04:38 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Dutch Trader; 
I and others have been talking about whether ONP was committing a fraud and you have been criticizing us as short
sellers. Understand I was long ONP until Muddy Waters and my own followup caused me to believe there is extensive
fraud at the company and reverse my position and sell. I then shorted ONP because I was convinced of its problems.
Understand I have never shorted any company ever before. 
Your analogy is simply incorrect. When I shorted, I borrowed the shares from a broker, specifically JP Morgan, who I
asked directly asked permission from and who agreed and knowingly lent them to me. I have no reason to believe
that JP Morgan did not have the right to loan the shares to me. I didn't borrow the shares from some unknowing or
unwilling person. If JP Morgan loaned something that wasn't theirs or that was someone elses and they had no

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 26/60


permission or right to loan, JP Morgan has done something wrong, not me. 
Thus, to correct your analogy it would be as if my neighbor borrowed my car with my permission. Now, if I didn't have
ownership of the car or the right to lend it, then I would be at fault, not my neighbor. 
The second part of your analogy about returning the car damaged or injuring others with the car is also incorrect. A
short seller merely sells the shares. The short seller actually sells the shares at the highest price he can, much like a
person who owns the stock does. The reason is because the short seller only profits if he buys the stock for less.
Whether other people who own the stock are willing to sell it for less is up to them, not the short seller. Effectively, the
short seller cannot do anything to damage the stock by short selling. Thus, a short seller cannot return stock in
damaged condition; a short seller buys back the stock and returns it to the borrower, who sale price depends on the
best offer of anyone who wants to buy it. 
Of course, I do agre with you that what would be descipable, unethical, and illegal is for a short seller to make false
statements or allegations, without any basis, against a company to persuade people that it is worth less than it really
is in order to get people to sell their stock for a lower price than it is worth. There is no dispute that this has been done
by short sellers and it is obviously completely wrong. However, I don't believe this is the case with Muddy Waters, the
chinese company analyst, myself, or others regarding ONP. We have just been presenting facts, reasoning and
analysis. On the other hand, the response from the company and its promoters I believe does not meet the genuine
criteria. 
With regards Muddy Waters, they have done their research and investigation and made many specific factual
allegations. If the facts they presented are fabricated and falsified by them, I would agree with you that it would be
immoral, despicable, unethical and, I believe, illegal. However, I don't believe that is the case. They have reasoned
from the facts and made opinions and conclusions that is fine if they honestly believe them, even if they are wrong,
but again are immoral and the rest if they don't believe them and they are falsified. I think it is relatively clear to
separate the facts from their research and investigation from their opinions and conclusions, which I don't put as
much weight on. They also provide extensive information so that somebody, like yourself, could go about verifying
whether they presented the facts truthfully or not. ONP, in my opinion, does not do this. 
I very much appreciate your last post (not sure about the smooth talker part, though). It appears we at least have
some agreement in some parts - presenting material facts that you know are not true or have no basis for believing
are true is immoral and unethical (and I believe illegal) whether you are a short seller or the company or long the
stock. Are remaining disagreement is that you believe that short selling is immoral, whereas I, along with the Catholic
Church I think, that short selling is not immoral. 
To answer your remaining - yes, I believe short sellers short primarily to make money just as I believe that people buy
stocks primarily to make money.

Ithbir: 
The purpose of some short selling is to hedge your position and to limit your downside risk. This is not the purpose of
all short selling. Jim Chanos has a fund where he only shorts and does so to profit, not to hedge risk. David Einhorn
expects each short to be a good bet in and of itself and make a profit and does not short to hedge and limit risk,
although it appears that he likes the benefit it has of smoothing out his returns. 
I have no evidence that Waldo Mushm or ChineseCompanyAnalyst shortsell to scare and create panic and benefit
from it and you present none, so I can't respond to this point. As I noted in response to Dutch Trader, anyone

presenting knowingly false information or information that have no basis to believe in is being unethical and, if the
information is material, may be acting illegaly, whether it is done by short sellers to reduce the perceived value of hte
company or whether it is done by the Company or its shareholders to inflate the value of the company. 
I believe that anyone who does such things should be investigated and prosecuted. However, in this case, it appears
to me that the investigation should be into the company as I noted discrepancies in ONP's own representations in its
SEC filings and on its website in one of my previous instablogs.

Thank you Seasaw64 for your reactions I appreciate and respect your arguments. You are good in debating, for me
English is not my native language so sometimes it is hard for me to formulate the right words. You have made several
good points and maybe once I will become a short seller too...hahaha, only in the Netherlands this service is not
provided by the brokers.


I think Muddy Waters and their managed partner Carson Block know what they are doing and especially the last one
has a lot of experience in the Chinese way of doing business. Personally I hope Muddy Waters but also Chinese
Company Analyst will sometimes publish "long" (positive) reports of Chinese companies. Companies that can be
example for the rest of the bunch.

Thank you. Your writing is very good and even more so for someone who English is not their first language. 
By the way, the ChineseCompanyAnalyst has writte postively about a Chinese smallcap company - YUII - and has
reported he has a long position in it. I have no position, information, or opinion on it. 
Carson Block and Mr. Regan both as long as you can get on a Chinese company - they both own their own
companies in China and live and work there. 
i have no doubt that there are plenty of very good Chinese companies. As Charlie Munger is reported to have said at
Berkshire's 2010 conference, "China is setting a new record for advancement of civilization at a very rapid rate. It's
fun to watch." See link at news.xinhuanet.com/eng.... 
Also, it might be good for you that they don't allow short selling in your country. Short selling is a difficult way to make
money. Mohnish Pabrai has commented persuasively on the problems with short selling as in investment strategies in
articles, books and interviews. See www.grahamanddoddsvill....

Author’s reply »  Don't "trust" me. Just investigate the facts - I'm only forming arguments based on the facts
that are out there. My anonymity has little to do with my arguments.


There are no "big name" firms supporting ONP. There isn't Goldman Sachs or Blackstone or KKR defending
ONP's honor. There's Roth, Pope and a bunch of PIPE firms.


The following is going to be a bit of an ad hominem attack, but I'm tired of people defending ONP because
there are "big institutions" investing in it.


The "big institutions" are dedicated PIPE funds and investment banks that cater to PIPE funds. And to the tell
you the truth, if I were ever at an intersection, and I had Roth and a bunch of PIPE funds telling me to go one
way, and a homeless bum telling me to go the other way, I'd probably pick the homeless bum every time.


PIPE funds are some of the savviest moneymakers around. Sophisticated pump-and-dumps have always
been and will continue to always be one of the best ways to make money in investing. But PIPE investors
aren't exactly the guardian angels of finance. If you're ever invested in a stock because a bunch of dedicated
PIPE funds have backed it, you need to spend more time learning exactly why dedicated PIPE funds are
some of the savviest moneymakers around.

in evaluating such advice is the person's identity. It reminds me of Douglas Hofstadter's writing's on Strange Loops. 
I have to disagree for two reasons. 
First, I would always do your own work rather than blindly trusting or relying on someone else. To the extent you rely
on someone's elses work, I would trust but verify. In other words, you must evaluate the facts they present and see if
they are verifiable and supportable. You must look at the reasoning to see if it makes sense or is logical. 
It makes no sense to just trust a big firm with a good reputation to give you accurate information. Usually, only a few
people in that big firm do the work and those people may do high quality or low quality work and they may have
integrity or they may not. 
More problematic is the large number of people who have gone broke trusting a big firm with a "good reputation". If
you would like historical examples, I can provide them as they are numerous. I personally agree with Charlie Munger
has a healthy skepticism of the entire accounting profession. And, of course, most people have a healthy skepticism
of the entire legal profession. 
I think ONP was not successfull in refuting the allegations of Muddy Waters. I think that if Muddy Waters were
incorrect, it would have been quite easy for ONP to refute their allegations with independently verifiable information.
More importantly for me is the inconsistencies that ONP has had in their own SEC filings and website as well as the
video evidence presented by the ONP promoters, which made ONP appear much different than the picture I imagined
of them from their SEC filings and their own website. 
I would have a lot of skepticism towards anyone, regardless of their entity, who simply states they have investigated it
and ONP is not fraudulent. I would need independently verifiable facts and sound reasoning. However, at this point, I
think we have plenty of evidence presented to make our own sound conclusion.

… Alas, I have read the July 22nd article on the Muddy Waters website and I think I understand some of the
confusion (not fraud) that their original report and ensuing turmoil has generated.


I have always felt that the Muddy Waters people were comparing operations and accounting procedures at ONP to
western business practices.


Some of the allegations of fraud and shell companies may seem valid by western standards but are an essential if not
required part of doing business in China.


Some of the other allegations, drawing from my memory are: 
Fraudulent RTO  
Dongfang Trading company 
Overstating the cost of new equipment 
Changing top 10 customers year to year. 
High inventory turnover


RTO: 
I have not see reams of documents, best estimates, bank statements, balance sheets, etc. 
What I do know is that a RTO is an inexpensive way to take a company public on the targeted exchange as opposed
to an IPO. If the Chinese people can find a way to do something cheaply, they will exploit it to the MAX. Remember,
China is a nation of savers. It is their nature to be as tight as possible with their money. This move is commendable.


DongFang Trading company: 
In China, when goods are imported or exported, the government requires the use of an Import/Export license. This
license is not cheap. Some of them can cost as much as $350,000USD or more and they are specialized and specific
as to what they can be used for. Large companies Like Intel, Motorola, and other western companies the US investor
would be familiar with more that likely have their own import/export license they purchased from the government at a
hefty fee to import raw material and export finished goods. Smaller companies that don’t have the resources to buy a
license have to use other means to export. Enter the trading company. A trading company is in every sense of the
word the ultimate middle man. It is not unlike acceptance banking from the days prior to wire transfer. In the case of
ONP, DongFang is owned by the chairman. It appears to have been originally set up as a Trading company to import
and export paper and paper related products as provided by the license. Most smaller non public companies would
list a trading company as a supplier because they would pay the trading company(not the actual supplier) for the
imported goods purchased. The trading company in turn then pays the supplier and normally pays any taxes due to
the government, and takes a small fee for the transaction. That is how a trading company makes money from a
transaction. ONP looks to be using DongFang more as an export/import license instead of a trading company and
(addressing the Beijing subsidiary) still doing some actual trading with third party companies. I am not sure of the
legalities of using the Im/Ex license like this but it appears to be going on. If ONP is using Dongfang as a Im/Ex
license then DongFang would indeed show no or very little revenue and the cost would be reflected on the ONP
books. It would be a cleaner way to account for Im/Ex transactions that way. So yes, DongFang is a shell ,but it is a
required and legitimate entity.


Overstating the cost of new equipment:

Lumber, Pulp Processing, and Paper making equipment cannot be purchased at the local Walmart. Having grown up
in the Northwest I am intimately familiar with this equipment. When a company wants to install a new line, be it for
lumber or paper, it has to be designed to the specifications of the purchaser. When the Muddy Waters folks called the
vendor for the new ONP paper line they got someone on the phone that said the biggest line they sell is much smaller
than the ONP line as far as tonnage goes and it costs less. So it stands to reason that a larger line would cost more.
A growing company like ONP does not have identical multiple locations through out China. Hence they do not have a
stock design for a specific paper line that produces a certain tonnage annually. So that means it has to be designed
and built from the ground up. A paper line that produces over 300,000 tons of paper a year is not a tinkertoy and
knowing what I know about the level of technology in China, it is more than likely the biggest paper line that the
vendor has ever built. The pictures that I have seen of ONP competitors show equipment that appears to have been
designed, built, and imported from abroad. Imported equipment is very expensive compared to domestic built, so here
again the least expensive route is taken.


Changing top 10 customers year to year.


I remember reading part of an interview with the ONP mgmt. and they stated they were going to switch a line from a
high grade paper to a lower grade paper because the raw materials for the higher grade product were increasing
rapidly and the margins were being reduced. After the switch, questions were raised as to how the new customers for
the lower grade paper were cultivated so rapidly. The answer is that being tight with the money on the expense side, it
gives ONP a big competitive edge as far as pricing. Like I have already mentioned price is the big “decider” for
Chinese buyers. Unless told otherwise the cheapest always prevails.


High inventory turnover


An up and coming company like ONP with expanding orders will have a tough time keeping an inventory at all. As
orders come in, production capacity is filled to the point of full capacity. At some point more equipment is ordered but
before it can be installed demand keeps increasing to the point of exceeding 100% capacity. When this situation
occurs, product is literally going from the machine and then loaded on the truck for delivery without intervening
warehousing. I suppose that for accounting purposes some form of inventory could be recorded, but it is not a true
reflection of the situation. There are some manufacturing terms I have not heard used by anyone when capacity and
inventory were referred to and that is: Lean manufacturing and Just in Time. To my knowledge, ONP is not either ISO
or AS certified but it doesn’t preclude the company from using modern manufacturing techniques to achieve maximum
efficiency. Therefore, a minimal inventory would show a higher turnover that a slower growth company keeping a
larger inventory.


Some important things to remember about China.


China is not America. Chinese businesses operate differently than American businesses. Sometimes the only
common thread is profit. Only time will tell whether or not ONP is a fraudulent company. I intend to visit them in
August to determine just that. My gut feeling is that they are on the up and up for the most part. Some corners may
have cut here and there. The Chinese are famous for that. I think there are actions the company took that are
misconstrued by some people as fraud but in the context of the Chinese business environment it is standard practice.
China is a very dynamic place right now. That is why it is attracting so many investors. In a lot of cases there are no
standards or average performances. As China tries to become less dependant on exports and more of a domestic

consumer driven economy standards and norms will increasingly move in a state of flux along with that will come
shortages, surpluses, and all the growing pains that every industrialized nation has had to endure. I view Chinese
companies as no more corrupt than their American counterpart. How many off balance sheet monkey business
shenanigans have US companied been caught doing in the last few years. In every country there are honest people
and there are cheats. Time has a way of weeding out the bad apples.

RTO: 
RTOs are also a way to go public without undergoing the same scrutiny that IPOs undergo.


DongFang:  
I haven't yet looked into this, so I'll just make no comment at this point.


Overstating the cost of new equipment:  
There's not much I can say on this - I haven't independently dug into the going prices for paper production
lines. Muddy Waters has and they've argued that the production line wouldn't cost more than $8m. You have
a different belief, based on your "intimate" familiarity with the equipment, so it's your word against theirs. So
again, I have no particular comment.


Changing the Top 10 Customers:  
You write "The answer is that being tight with the money on the expense side, it gives ONP a big competitive
edge as far as pricing."


ONP is a small commodity paper manufacturer with no economies of scale. It's doubtful they have the pricing
power to be the low-cost producer of paper, and sufficiently so to be able to cultivate a boatload of customer
relationships (incidentally, with customers who are far too small to even be able to buy the amount of paper
ONP claims they buy).


Orient Paper is a paper manufacturer. It operates a commodity business, and Orient Paper doesn’t have any
special technology over and above its competitors. As well, while China is a faster growing economy than the
United States, it is nevertheless competitive, and paper demand isn’t growing at 50% a year. The Company
can’t simply change its product mix, replace 80% of its Top 10 customers and still grow revenue by more than
50%.


High inventory turnover: 
A small commodity paper manufacturer like ONP is extremely unlikely to be able to achieve 15x inventory
turns when its much larger, more sophisticated competitors have inventory turns of 4x to 7x. ONP isn't Toyota.
Nothing about any of the videos that we've seen indicate that ONP has some first-class just in time / lean
manufacturing techniques.


In fact, nothing about any of the videos that we've seen indicate that ONP has first-class anything. It
manufactures and ships some paper - there's no denying that. But its revenue isn't growing 50% a year, and
its profit margins and inventory turnover aren't industry-leading. Its overall business is much smaller than its
SEC financial statements indicate, and the company is fabricating its numbers.

Since you are anonymous - i am assuming that you are the anonymous dog on the internet you are referring to or are
you just making a silly, sarcastic joke. 
I know that you would not be criticizing anyone for being anonymous when you yourself are, that would be
hypocritical, which I am sure you are not.

SeaSaw64: 
Not to get away from the issue at hand with ONP but, I believe the problem most people have with others not
revealing their true identity is an instinctual distrust of someone who purposely remains anonymous. Think
about it rationally - if you were accused of a crime, even with evidence brought forward, you would still want
to know who accused you. Even in our imperfect legal system, the accused has the right to face their accuser.
Or maybe a more accurate analogy would be if a friend of yours was accused of a crime, you as a friend
would most likely ask "Who accused you?!" And would be very irked if the only response possible would be: "I
don't know, just some anonymous person." Plus, there's the question of credibility, it's impossible to verify
someone's credentials who remains anonymous - just because your bio states you're a licensed investment
advisor doesn't necessarily mean it's true. Don't get defensive, I'm just using it as an example. Which is
essential what is going on here with ChineseCompanyAnalyst (with compelling evidence brought to light by
Muddy Waters) accusing ONP of fraud and yet still willfully remaining anonymous. And while the other people
posting comments probably do not work for ONP, they probably have a vested interest in their stock, just like
you have, or had, a vested interest (in the form of short position) in their stock. 
Back to the issue at hand with ONP: using the given advise of investigating the facts, I still feel there are
some question marks about the report itself Muddy Waters did; like I had previously stated, there are some
parts of the report that seem incongruous with the rest of the report. I'll wait for the results of whichever Big
Four firm conducts the audit. With all the furor surrounding this company, I believe whichever firm does end
up doing the audit will truly be diligent and thorough. If they find ONP not guilty of fraud I'm sure they will have
sound reasoning to refute any of the issues/concerns brought forward by Muddy Waters.

Bzwnski: 
I don't believe that the Muddy Waters article generated confusion or that they didn't understand Chinese business
practicies - they both own and operate companies in China. 
Also, good business operations and accounting practices don't change depending on what country you are in. You
don't get a wink and nod for unacceptable business practices or committing fraud because you are in China. 
The allegations of fraud and shell companies are valid by any standards. Operating fraudulently is not excused or a
good business practice in China or anywhere else.

Finally, perhaps you should have the reports handy in front of you, rather than just relying on a faulty memory. The
site is www.muddywatersresearc..., so it easy to look at it when you are posting to seekingalpha.com on your
computers. 
1. Fraudulent RTO - can you provide a cite anywhere where Muddy Waters criticized ONP for doing a reverse merger
or said it was fraudulent for doing a reverse merger. This argument should be easy for you to answer because it is not
one they made. 
2. Dongfang Trading Company - you state that ONP is using this company for its import/export license. this makes no
sense. ONP does not claim to be doing any importing or exporting. ONP claims to get its raw materials locally from
Dongfang Trading Company from used paper obtained locally. If Dongfang is providing the used paper to be recycled,
which ONP claims, Dongfang would have to have revenues and expenses and not be just a shell company.
Furthermore, ownership of Dongfang by the Chairman would be required to be disclosed as it creates a conflict of
interest. 
3. Overstating the Cost of New Equipement: 
Muddy Waters said that the manufacturer said on several occasions that they don't make the equipment of the size
that ONP ordered. Do you have any specific information from the manufacturer that it does? If you do, please provide
it. Otherwise, you have provided no facts, evidence or reasoning to dispute Muddy Waters claims, other than your
pure speculation. 
Changing top 10 customers year to year. 
4. Changing Top 10 Customers Year to Year 
You state that ONP has a price advantage over other producers supplying low grade paper. Please provide the
verifiable facts supporting this assertion. What is ONP"s price for this low grade paper and what is price of its
competitors? How does ONP have a price advantage over other competitors which have the advantage of large
economies of scale over ONP? Even if they had a lower price, they doesn't mean they can get sales immediately as
new customers would be worried about quality, reliability, etc., so you would still need an explanation of how they
would be able to acquire new customers at such large volumes so quickly. Based on the lack of detail or support for
your assertions, it again appears that you are just speculating. 
5. High Inventory Turnover 
Again, you provide no facts or evidence, just pure speculation. ONP's own reports indicate that they are contracting,
not expanding. In 2007, they reported in a video on their website 8 plants, 9 production lines, and 863 employees.
Now, their website indicates two plants, 7 production lines and SEC filings say 600 employees. A recent supposed
complete pictures of their operations show only 2 or 3 production lines. As far as modern manufacturing techniques,
their CFO admitted they have no r&d facilities or r&d team. Besides the very small digital photo lines, the equipement
for the other line appears old and small and inefficient. Using the same speculation you use, another way you might
have very little inventory is if you produced very little product. Merely speculating as to possibilities is not the way to
resolve questions, you need to look at facts and evidence. Your entire paragraph on this issue is just how you imagine
it might be, not how it is based on facts and evidence.  
6. Some Important Things to Remember About China. Good operations are good operations everywhere and bad
operations are bad operations every where. Fraud and lying may be more commonplace in China, but that does not
make them more acceptable for a business to do or to investors looking to invest. The same principles of good
business operations, sales operations, accounting, disclosures, etc. are important everywhere and don't change
where you are. The average level of performance in those areas may be different, but it does not make them
acceptable.

In summary, you appear just to make up possible acceptable explanation but these are without any substance as you
provide no facts or evidence in support of your points, only pure speculation. Furthemore, Muddy Waters made more
and better arguments than you present here. I provided the site. I have also presented issues in my instablogs here
on seekingalpha.com.

Seasaw, while you're defensive against these ad hominem attacks, do you not think that you're goading this type of
behavior? You have stated that you are short and you respond to nearly every single ONP positive post on here with
the fervor of a canine defending his master. You're not spending hours upon hours responding to every single post
with these page long reactions for the sake of illuminating the misinformed. You're doing it to protect your short sale
and drive the price further down. And you have been successful. I lost a ton of money and am now out of the position.
It was getting far too hairy in too short a span. Now it's heading back up. Please continue your due diligence, as you
have been, of biting, kicking, and clawing this stock price down so that I can have an advantageous buy in
opportunity.

Are any of them good investment companies?

prettyboyfloydm: 
No, I am not goading ad hominem attacks at all. I was long ONP. After I did my original due diligence (which I feel I
did poorly at this point), I read all the promoters of the stock to find anything negative I missed to show I might be
wrong. This includes Rick Pearson, Eric Jackson, Harbinger, Roth, etc. Most claimed to have visited and were highly
complimentary of the company. 
Then I read the Muddy Waters report which concerned me greatly - I immediately realized that this was the due
diligence I should have done and my due dililgence was poor.  
The clincher for me was the Rick Pearson video posted on youtube. ONP was presenting itself as a fast growing,
cutting edge company operating more efficiently and effectively because of leading advanced technology. The video
looked to me to show the oppositve - a small, antiquated factory working inefficiently with old, dilapidated equipement.
Frankly, it was shocking to me. 
I sold my long position at a substantial loss. I then shorted the company. It appeared to me to be a certain fraud. 
Shocking as it may seem, it also seemed there was a large operation promoting companies like ONP who profit from

these companies in one way or another. Some may be unknowing of any fraud, some may just be indifferent and not
do their due diligence to know one way or another, and some may be co-conspirators. I don't know.  
But it does appear that a whole host of people come up in support. At the lowest level are posters and bloggers on
sites such as this and yahoo. Many of them simply are inflammatory, making insults or shamelessly pumping the
stock. Then there are the commentators like Doug from Wallstreetmedia.com, Rick Pearson, and Erick Jackson who
cheerlead the stock with what they imply is good due diliigence but they fail to provide the type of verifiable facts and
evidence or reasoning therefrom that good due diligence entails. Then there are the firms that deal directly with the
company, the IR firms like Crocker, analysts like Harbinger and Roth Capital, investment banks, lawyers, accountants,
and so on. 
So, anyway, if ONP is a fraud, it has a lot of support. 
My goal is to try to keep the focus on facts and evidence, particular that are verifiable, and sound reasoning
therefrom. I think everyone should do their own due diligence and make their own conclusions. With the vast support
of ONP but their failures to provide good information in my opinion, I have been trying to provide such information. 
Thus, I wrote two instablogs. One instablog took the information directly from ONP - from its own SEC filings, its
website and its CFO - and showed the problems and inconsistencies that make the ONP story not believable in my
opinion. As a result of my method, ONP could not complain about the source of the information - it was themselves.  
The second instablog looked at the video of ONP by the promoter Doug at wallstreetmedia.com. To an
undiscriminating mind, the video might appear to help ONP's cause. I beileved that to a discriminating mind, the video
was further evidence of the inconsistencies and problems with ONP so I provided the analysis. 
What I recommend is one review the evidence itself - ONP's SEC filings, its website, and the two videos by Rick
Pearson and Doug and judge for themselves. 
A discussion using facts and evidence and sound reasoning is helpful. One using personal attacks and speculation
are not helpful in my opinion. 
Rather than question me, I recommend that you question all those who are posting sites pumping ONP and making
personal attacks and insults on others, without providing facts, evidence, or sound reasoning.

Chinese Company Analyst: 
“China is a faster growing economy than the United States, it is nevertheless competitive, and paper demand isn’t
growing at 50% a year.” No, but can a company’s business grow or take away business from competitors while the
WHOLE industry grows at a much slower pace. Take Amazon.com. The book industry obviously didn’t grow nearly as
fast as Amazon’s earnings. And initially they were the underdog, taking on bigger competitors like Barnes & Nobles
and Borders. But they provided a product that was cheaper than competitors and they took market share from
competitor despite of their small size.

“The Company can’t simply change its product mix, replace 80% of its Top 10 customers and still grow revenue by
more than 50%.” 
Why not? New customers drive business. How did Walmart grow? It sold goods at a cheaper price and took market
share.


“A small commodity paper manufacturer like ONP is extremely unlikely to be able to achieve 15x inventory turns when
its much larger, more sophisticated competitors have inventory turns of 4x to 7x.” Small companies have high
turnovers compared to larger companies. That is economics 101. Small companies need to save costs, so they don’t
produce must inventory. They produce it when someone wants it. Large companies work on mass production (it is
cheaper) and sell the products.

Hello Everyone, As I have mentioned in my previous entries, I live and work in China. I also intend to visit ONP in
August. Rather than just show up In BaoDing with a camera in hand, I am encouraging everyone on this blog to
submit what they would like to see in the way of pictures, questions asked, financial descrepancies explained, etc. 
Depending on the number of requests I receive, I will try to ask and get as much information as possible. I know ONP
will have a formal audit in the near future. I have contacted ONP and have already opened a dialog with them. I am
more of a factory floor production person so if capacity is missing I will spot it immediately. I will also try to shed more
light on how a trading company works and the many ways it can be used to enhance as well as retard bottom line
performance. Please, I would like to get to the bottom of this puzzle rather than argue among ourselves.


FYI I am long ONP a small amount


25 Jul 2010, 07:29 PM


CSMhater
Bzwnski: 
I've got a few things I would really like to get cleared up: 
1)The correct name of the company from the 2008 SEC 10-K filing that is the supposed "smoking gun". Muddy
Waters refers to a company named "He Bei Oriental Paper Co. Ltd." on page 5 of their report ($2.4 mil. revenue).
However, when I pulled up the actual filing copy from the SEC website, it clearly states "Hebei Baoding Orient Paper
Milling Company" ($65.2 mil. revenue). Seems to me, that's quite a discrepancy, especially when $62.8 mil. is
potentially in question. Kind of like if I were to cite Tommy Hilfiger financials, when it might really be Tommy Bahama
figures being used. Doesn't seem like thorough due diligence.


- Side note to that end, did Muddy Waters try and contact ALL of the top 10 customers from 2008, especially if that is
supposed to be a smoking gun? They state on page 8 of their report they "confirmed with two of the 2008 top 10
customers that ONP's purported sales amounts to them were false", yet there is a striking absence of their attempt to
contact the other 8. Not exactly what I would call due diligence.


Continuing on to the other points I'd like clarified -  
2) If at all possible, could you talk to an authorized executive of the the top 10 customers from 2009? And get
clarification as to their actual order amounts and if possible, their own revenue generated? On page 9 of Muddy

Waters report, it only states their attempts to contact the customers, yet does not indicate who at the respective
companies they talked to. Again, that seems like a glaring omission in light of how "diligent" Muddy Waters was in
citing other sources throughout their report. Also, by their own words on page 11 of their report, they state "larger
companies would be easier to contact, and with some relationship building efforts, likely to disclose that ONP's claims
of purchase volume are false." This seems to indicate Muddy Waters believes most companies would not be
forthcoming in just giving out financial information to someone they have never met before and to a company they had
never heard of, no less. 
To me, these seems like two of the major points that would clear things up. Granted, replacing 8 of your top 10
customers from one year to the next and still having a 56% growth seems doubtful, but it does at least seem possible.


3) Could you try and verify their daily production capacity?


Thanks

26 Jul 2010, 01:31 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Modie: 
There is no reason to think that ONP's business is growing faster than the industries as a whole. Indeed, there are
reasons to believe it is contracting as I detailed in my instablog based on ONP's own reports. There is no reason to
believe that ONP is making products cheaper than competitors. Sure, these things are possible theoretically and may
have happened with the companies that you mention, but there is no reason to think they are happening with ONP.
Quite the oppositve. 
Why can't company change its product mix, replace its top ten customers and grow revenue by more than 50%? First
of all, the company would need to either get new equipement or retool its existing production lines for the new paper,
if that is possible. That takes time and money. Paper is a commodity and there are plenty of paper companies
supplying paper in the area, so it would be very difficult for ONP to simply take those customers away from
competitors. So it also takes time and money to get those new sales, particularly when you have not established
enough of a reptuation and goodwill with your current top customers such that they are either keeping the same
amount or increasing their orders. As to Walmart, I'm not sure why you mention them becaue that is certainly not what
Walmart did. 
As to ONP's high inventory turnover, I can follow your argument. Small companies do not necessarily have higher
turnover than larger companies. You reference the larger companies advantage as to economies of scale when you
that they work on mass production because it is cheaper (note: also kind of contradicts your earlier point that ONP's
paper is cheaper). You also note that ONP just manufactures the paper when someone wants it. So we are supposed
to believe that ONP is increasing sales so rapidly while making customers who order paper wait till ONP then

produces it and then the customers also has to send a truck to get it (ONP does not deliver the paper). It simply
makes no sense.

CSMhater: : 
I don't know if the firm who investigates, if one does, will be thorough and diligent at all. Presumption like this are the
enemy of good reasoning. What and see. If they do great. If they don't oh well.  
As far as anonymity, companies, particular frauds, tend to attack short sellers. Read David Einhorn's book "You Can
Fool All of the People Some of the Time". Look at all the personal attacks on the Muddy Water's guys. Look at the
recent attacks on short sellers during the financial meltdown. Furthermore, in this case, all of the pertinent information
is in the control and possession of ONP. If they were able to, they could have quelled this quickly and completely with
thorough and verificable responses. In my opinion, they didnt. Indeed, my posts were based on ONP's own
representations through its SEC filings, website, and CFO, as well as the two video's of ONP taken by its promoters. 
I am not aware of any parts of the Muddy Waters report that are incongruous. If you have commented on it, I am not
aware of it and didn't agree with you. 
However, to me, since the conversation is about ONP, the only important focus is ONP. I don't care if the devil itself
wrote a report or it has contradiction, if it does have accurate, verifiable evidence showing fraud by ONP, that it what
is relevant in my opinion so that should be the focus. 
I am still waiting to hear if they actually went ahead and hired Loeb & Loeb or a Big 4 Accounting Firm. I am not sure
why they need to hire a law firm to help them hire a Big 4 Accounting Firm. To me, this might mean that they want to
try to claim the protection of attorney-client information for anything revealed. If they really want an investigation, I
would hire an investigator, not a law firm. Law firms specialize in representing clients, not doing independent, neutral
investigations.

1) the name of the operating subsidiary. You are focused on the English translation of the Chinese name. That is
irrelevant as it can be translated different ways. You want to focus on the Chinese name to see if the Chinese names
are the same. It has already been established in my opinion that they are and not sure what benefit it would be to ask
the company, you would want to establish by indepnednetly verifiable iinformation. 
2) Muddy Waters contacting the top ten custoemrs - you misrepresent the Muddy Waters report. Page 9 of the report
provides a chart of their contacts and attempted contacts of the top ten customers and their summary. I found it quite
diligent.

First, thank you for the clarification regarding the name of HBOP, that's why I asked.


Secondly, I don't believe I am misrepresenting the Muddy Waters report;  
1) In the report on page 8 they state "We confirmed with two of the 2008 top customers that ONP's purported sales
amount to them were false by at least a very large amount". Nowhere does the report state if they tried or were able
to contact the other customers for 2008. Granted, the issue with these two companies is alarming; but I repeat, what
about the other 8? 
2) The chart on page 9 only shows their attempts to contact the top 10 customers for 2009. Again, if Muddy Waters is
going to use this argument as part of their report, then they should state who they talked to, and what their position is
within this company; because if they only talked to someone who works at a desk and would not know how much the
company actually orders, and who they order from, how valid can the information they give be? Although, according
to your previous arguments, you would seem to believe them more than you would an executive of the company. But
using your own arguments, where's the independently verifiable information regarding the revenue and purchase
amounts of the top 10 customers for both 2008 and 2009. Muddy Waters has not provided this. Without documented
proof, we are left to rely upon the word of someone who works for these companies - again when it comes to relying
upon this information, please tell me who am I to believe? 
2) By Muddy Waters' own words, it would seem most companies, at least in China would not be forthcoming in
divulging financial information - and to a complete stranger working for a start-up company they had never heard of
before. Again, on page 11 of Muddy Waters report they state " larger companies would be easier to contact, and with
some relationship building efforts, likely to disclose that ONP's claims of purchase volume are false." "Relationship
building"? "Likely to disclose"? So are we to believe the companies they contacted told a complete stranger the truth
about their finances? Even in China, I'm pretty sure most companies would not want employees talking about
financial information to random people. Anyplace I've ever worked, the company made it clear they did not want the
employees talking to anyone outside of the company about specific financial information. I doubt it would be any
different in China. Muddy Waters did not provide verifiable information: 
on page 9, the chart say "Purported Volume", it did NOT state "Verified Volume". Using their own words: 
Hebei Tianpurun Printing - "Claims to generate revenue of approximately $5.9 million" 
Baoding Huatai - "Seems likes" 
Beijing Huafumei Paper Sales - "It wouldn't specify, but it seems" 
Shanghai Hengxin Paper - "The contact did not know whether it buys from ONP" 
Hebei Marching Paper Products & Packaging - "Being that it is based in a small village, its revenue is likely no more
than $100,000." 
There's quite a few "seems" in that chart. Nothing in that chart stating "we were able to verify XYZ company only does
XX amount of volume." 
Admittedly, the fact Muddy Waters was unable to contact 4 of the companies is troubling and is one of my concerns.
Hence, my request to get clarification on the top 10 companies. Obviously, when investing in a company, the
generated revenue is one of the things you look at.


Did anyone actually read the SEC 10-K filing for 2009? Or the 2008 filing? While I will not claim to have read them
word for word, I did go through most of them and in response to questions about the sudden 56% increase, on page
29 of the 2009 filing under "Revenue" they state "The increase was attributable to (1) the increase in our customers'
demand for various paper products in year 2009; (2) for year 2008, the interruption of production and delivery
schedule before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games with respect to our sales to customers in and around Beijing;" and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 41/60


two other points which have debated ad nauseam. This would be a legitimate reason for the increase. Is it true? I'm
not qualified to answer definitively "yes" or "no". I'm just putting it out there. The urban centers of Beijing and Tianjin
has been their marketing focus because they ejoy a "price advantage in the region over competitors from other
locales in China." [page 8 of 2008 10-K filing, under Marketing].


I must in good faith state there is also another discrepency in the 2008 filing and 2009 filing that makes me question
ONP. In the 2008 filing they state "Of the more than 140 clients we serve, HBOP's largest customers are..." [page 7 of
2008 10-K filing, under Customers]. However, in the 2009 filings they state "Of the more the 100 customers we serve,
the largest customers are..." [page 9 of 2009 10-K SEC filing]. So ONP goes from serving over 140 customers in 2008
to over 100 in 2009, a 28.5% decrease in their customer base? To me, highly unlikely if they had a 56% increase in
revenue. Is it possible? Yes. Probable? Very unlikely.


One other point of interest is on page 29 of Muddy Waters report regarding their methodology. Again, their own words: 
"We initially approached ONP as a possible Strong Buy... We were willing to accept a thesis that there is a strong
underlying business with some investor money being skimmed." I'm sorry, really? Some INVESTOR MONEY being
skimmed? My question to that is this: how much skimming did Muddy Waters initially believe was acceptable? 2%?
5%?, 10%? Would someone please tell me how much skimming they believe is acceptable? To me, that's a slippery
slope to go on. 
Seasaw64, I do believe also that Muddy Waters has raised some very valid concerns, however, the investigation they
conducted also raises its own questions. This is why I currently do not have a stock position on this company. Thank
you for your eloquent responses. 
You seems well versed in the matters of finances.

Phenomenal follow up CSM hater.. great research. Thanks for the information


26 Jul 2010, 10:47 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
CSMhater: 
First of all, you can see the serious problems with ONP from their own information - from their SEC filings and their
websites. I detailed these problems in my own instablog. And, yes, I have read every one of their SEC filings multiple
times. 
1) Why believe Muddy Waters over ONP about the top 10 customers? ONP has failed to provide any of the
information about the top 10 customers which you want, even though all of that information should be in their
possession. You don't even know the names of the top 10 customers from ONP, because the english names don't
provide enough information to translate into Chinese. ONP does not provide the address or phone number. 
On the other hand, Muddy Waters has provided independently verifiable information because they have given you the
Chinese name, the address and phone number. Thus, their information is indpendently verifiable becasue you can
now investigate yourself. You can call and try to find the information. Some people at the company may tell you the
information; some people may not. There are investigative techniques - you can buy a book on Amazon to learn them
- that can increase the likliehood of getting that information. You can visit the company and try to find out. You can

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 42/60


think about it and come up with questions - for example, do you pick up the paper you order (onp says they don't
deliver) or is it delivered by the manufacturer. 
Could Muddy Waters have done a better or more complete report? Sure, you can say that about almost any report.
But Muddy Waters is providing you substantial, important information that ONP is not and ONP is in a much better
position to provide this information. Furthermore, Muddy Waters did much better due diligence than I did and did a
much better report than I probably would have done - so I think they did a very good job. Their report looks much
better to me than the companies response. 
2) Can we believe that companies that Muddy Waters contacted told a complete stranger the truth about their
finances? Sure, it happens all the time. My last plane flight, a gentleman told me all about his company and its
finances. Approached the right way, many people will talk about all kinds of things. Perhaps you have not done any
investigative work and are not familiar with this. There are books on Amazon you can purchase about investigating
and you will find relationship building as one of the important keys to getting people to talk to you. 
On the one hand, you cast doubt on Muddy Waters getting any info, but on the other hand, you criticize them for not
getting more for customers. Well, I think you already identified the problem, not everybody was forthcoming. I don't
know why Muddy Waters didn't put the name of the people they talked to - but it seems you suggest an answer -
perhaps they would unsure if such disclosure would get the person undue attention at their company. 
The bottom line is that Muddy Waters identified a number of falsifications. At that point, I frankly have difficulty trusting
anything ONP says. 
3) Outstanding catch regarding the customers going from over 140 in 2008 to over 100 in 2009. No matter how many
times I go through SEC filings, it always seems there is still something I missed. Read my instablog - this is consistent
with their reports of reducing production lines and employees. The evidence to me seems relatively clear that this
company is reporting a contraction, not an expansion. 
I think you make some very valid points. In fact, if you review your points, you will se that they make a very bad case
for ONP. 
Thank you very much for your contributions and the kind comment.


Clarifications on the top 10 companies - I believe that if ONP could have provided such clarification and it would have
helped them, they


Muddy Water's disclosures about the top 10 customers are independently verifiable because they have provided you
with the Chinese names and phone numbers of those customers. ONP


I have read every single SEC filings by ONP multiple times, including the 2008 and 2009 10ks, as well as their
websites. I detailed the problems in my instablog. 
You can forget about Muddy Waters and stil determine ONP is no telling the truth because ONP can't keep its own
story straight - it contradicts itself. I detailed this in my own blog. 
It appears your point about Muddy Waters is that they could have done a better report and got and provided more
information. Of course. This is true about any report. But I think they did a thorough job. 
You criticize them for not getting all the information for the customers then criticize them for claiming how can they
have got any information because the companies would not tell them. 
My point is this, unlike ONP, Muddy Waters provided us with the Chinese name and contact number of its top ten
customers in 2009. That is why it is verifiable - you can follow up and do your own due diligence. The most likely

person to believe is someone who works for the customer who you contact on your own. Yes, there are times when a
person calls up a company and can get information from them. Indeed, skilled investigators get all kinds of information
from people that they may not be supposed to reveal.


My point about the top 10 customers is that, unlike ONP, Muddy Waters gave you the Chinese name and the phone
numbers of the top 10 customers. You can go about

I have enough info to decide for myself but most people might get scared because of the disinformation
campaign by short sellers. 
Its is clear I am long in ONP because I believe their story, my Chinese advisor and I believe that the
investigation by Loeb and an independent accountancy firm will reveal the reality about this paper
manufacturer. 
Buy more of it if people get scared out of their stocks but I do hope that muddy waters will be prosecuted for
what they did: disseminate misinformation.

Willem55; 
Unfortunately, your post appears to be just another one of attempts by many people to pump the stock without any
supporting evidence or facts. Instead, you are completely conclusory. 
I posted two instablogs noting problems and inconsistencies regarding ONP, discovered by examining ONP's own
representations through their own SEC filings, their own websites, and their CEO, as well as 2 videos shot by
promoters of their stock. 
The approach by commentators questioning ONP such as Muddy Waters, ChineseCompanyAnalyst, and particular
myself, tend to focus on facts and evidence and sound reasoning therefrom.

To everyone: 
I think it's been established there's enough information out there for everyone to decide for themselves whether they
believe ONP is fraudulent or not. It's up to you as the individual investor to make your own determination. Do I believe
categorically that ONP is committing fraud? No, I do not. However, I just don't feel there's enough evidence to
convince me to re-invest my hard earned money into them. Let me state, I AM NOT short-ing this company; so I have
no financial gain if the ONP stock price drops. Initially I was long on this stock, but have since sold it. To me, there's
just too many questions about this company, so I'd rather invest my money in other companies (and hopefully do a
better job of "due diligence" on investigating them!). I hope whoever has invested in this company makes a profit one
way or the other; whether it's by having long positions or short positions. After all, in the end, isn't that what this is all

be involved in a independent audit of their financial date by a reputable CPA Firm!! COME ON!


28 Jul 2010, 02:28 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
I am short the stock. But when one of the first actions of a newly formed audit committee, formed with new directors
required by recent investors in a large capital, is to find it necessary to decide to hire a law firm and an accounting firm
to determine whether management has been embezzling and comitting fraud, I do not find that a good fact. Can you
recite me any time in history this has resulted in good news for the company? 
In the meantime, I would like an announcement that they have hired a law firm and what their name is (they say they
decided to hire Loeb & Loeb, but Drew Bernstein said previously said they were hiring DLPiper and that didn't
happen.) I would also like an announcement that they actually hired a big 4 accounting firm and their name. 
Additionally, is this an admission that the audit by their current accountants is not any good? If it is good, why not
release that audit report, with all the supporting detail and backup?


28 Jul 2010, 03:54 PM


CSMhater
I might have been wrong about there being enough information to decide if ONP is, or is not, committing fraud. Not to
stir up any trouble - but I just saw the analyst at ROTH Capital, one of ONP's investing banks, has suspended
coverage of ONP until results of the independent third party investigation. Again, do I completely believe ONP is guilty
of fraud? No. However, it's getting harder to believe in their innocence if even one of their investment banks is
suspending coverage.


Also, I watched the promotion video for ONP (www.orientalpapercorpo...) and was perplexed they haven't updated
their information. It clearly stated Orient Paper was 1.) traded on OTCBB, 2.) listed its ticker as OPAI. (Did a Google
Finance search, OPAI produced no matches). If they're having such great increases in revenue, couldn't they afford to
update their promo video and give potential investors the correct information? To me, if I were running a company that
welcomed investors, I would make darn sure they had the correct information; because as most companies would
agree, one the best ways to help generate revenue is to get your name out there through marketing, and accurate
marketing at that!. What does this mean? Maybe nothing, then again it makes you wonder what they're using all their
generated revenue on. Just pointing out if I had done my due diligence on ONP to begin with and had come across
this video first and then tried to find information regarding the company listing its ticker as OPAI and not coming up
with anything, and along with the other concerns brought up by Muddy Waters, it definitely would have made me
thunk twice before investing in them.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 45/60


A few other questions: 
1)Does anyone know when will ONP let us know who and when the indepedent third party investigation will be? In
this age of instant communication, it seems to be taking a long time to get just this part going.


2) In their July 6 response, they stated "Orient Paper is currently arranging a field trip for some of its larger
institutional investors to meet with management of Henang Qinyang in order to clarify the specifics of the equipment
purchase transaction." That was 3 weeks ago, nothing has been mentioned since.


3) In the same July 6 rsponse, Orient Paper provides a link which shows photocopies of reports regarding the HBOP
in question. Granted, I can't read Chinese, and the MSN translator didn't work on this copy and documents can easily
be forged. However, Muddy Waters has not provided any link to their supposed copies. The only link I was able to find
from them was results of an ON-LINE POLL, and a Chinese newspaper article which has an obvious reference to
ONP. I have not been able to find anything showing copies of the financial papers Muddy Waters supposedly saw
which is purported to have the personal seal of Chairman Liu. (If anyone has found a link showing these, in my
genuine pursuit of trying to get all the facts, please let me know). I would think if Muddy Waters thought this was
signifcant enough to refer to it as a smoking gun, they would have found a way to get some kind of copy. We are to
just take their word for it. (In any trial, this type of "evidence" would not even be admitted). I have not been able to find
anywhere a statement by Muddy Waters indicating they saw with their own eyes these documents. Just a reference to
a "tax insider". This point seems questionable. Muddy Waters even stated themselves in their own report, they have
"obtained information contained herein from sources we believe to be accurate and reliable. However, such
information is presented 'as is,' without warranty of any kind - whether expressed or implied. Muddy Waters, LLC.
makes no representation, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, or completedness of any such information..." 
Not exactly a ringing endorsement as to the veracity of their facts. But, in light of other valid concerns raised by
Muddy Waters, it would seem ONP is a risky investment. If the information provided by ONP is true and accurate, I
would love to re-invest in them, I just have a difficult time taking EITHER side at face value. Again, all of this just
seems to muddy the waters (sorry, bad pun intended) regarding ONP and which side to believe.

My advice: If you ae long on ONP, you'd better got out from this company's stock as the stock can halt trading forever
as NEP does at any day.


Don't bet the stock is too cheap to pass. There are many good companies to invest why stick ito this one.


When things are not clear, exit first, ask questions later.


It is your money on the table, your hard earned money. You could lose all the money.


Chinese are laughing on us American. American are too easy to be cheated. That is why American become poor.
Most lost their live savings in US stock market. Many by investing on Chinese stocks: NEP, ONP, BBC, FUQI, VISN,
LIWA, CHNG, ...


Many lost 80% or more with very "good earnings"!!!


No position on any of those stocks no matter how cheap it is. Once it is halt trading, or delisted, your money is lost.

I don't think it will be delisted. Muddy Waters even claims it is worth at least a buck. So if they are right, it will fall to $1
per share and with climb back up over the years. So if you haven't lost much, it may be better to invest in beaten
down U.S. blue chips. But if you lost a lot AND have don't need the money anytime soon, it is foolish to sell and claim
the loss. Remember, you don't loose anything until you sell.

"Professor Statman is an expert in the behavior known as the 'fear of regret.' People tend to feel sorrow and
grief after having made an error in judgment. Investors deciding whether to sell a security are typically
emotionally affected by whether the security was bought for more or less than the current price. One theory is
that investors avoid selling stocks that have gone down in order to avoid the pain and regret of having made a
bad investment. The embarrassment of having to report the loss to the IRS, accountants, and others may
also contribute to the tendency not to sell losing investments. Some researchers theorize that investors follow
the crowd and conventional wisdom to avoid the possibility of feeling regret in the event that their decisions
prove to be incorrect. "

CSMhater
User155460:


Why "must" I be short this stock? Simply because I have doubts as to whether or not ONP is committing fraud?
Nowhere have I actively encouraged anyone to sell their ONP stock. I have only stated it's never a bad thing to walk
away from a stock having made a profit. If you have not been able to make a profit from this stock (or at the very least
break even), that is not anyone else's fault. When you decide to sell your stocks is entirely up you; no one has forced
you to hold on to, or sell your stocks. If you are currently in a position where selling your stock would cause you to
take a loss, I genuinely feel for you - I've been in that situation before with a couple of different stocks. However, I did
not have anyone to blame but myself for when I decided to sell the stocks. While it would be easy to blame Muddy
Waters and some of the others who have posted comments questioning ONP, all they have done is try to come out
with what they believe are facts about ONP's fraud. Do I completely trust the facts provided by Muddy Waters?
Admittedly, I question some of the claims made in their report, due to what I perceive as a lack of documented proof.
Having said that, their report at the very least prompted me to do better research of my own into ONP, their SEC 10-K
filings and their responses to Muddy Waters (and lack of follow-up); after having done so, I have some serious doubts
as to their financial situation. Let me re-state them for you:


1) Lose 8 of their top 10 customers from 2008 to 2009;


2) They lose almost 30% of their customer base (from 140+ in 
2008 [page 7 of 2008 SEC 10-K filing under Customers], to 100+ in 2009 [page 9 of 2009 SEC filing]), but still have a
56% increase in revenue? 
Perhaps you could provide me with a few examples of companies who have legitimately done this. Like I've stated in
previous comments, I'm just trying to get all the facts.


3) Both years maintain approximately 600 employees - if they had  
such a great increase in revenue, (in large part due to their  
increased paper production) wouldn't they need to increase the 
number of employees?


4) The follow-up to ONP's statement that an independent auditing  
firm (supposedly one of the Big 4 firms) would be conducting an 
audit. That was 2 weeks ago. In this age of instant  
communication, how long does it take to make at least a  
preliminary agreement? At least enough of an agreement so they 
could make a public statement?


5) In ONP's response July 6, they stated they were "currently  
arranging a field trip for some of its larger institutional investors to 
meet with management of Henang Qinyang in order to clarify  
the specifics of the equipment purchase transaction." That was 3 
weeks ago, there has not been a word since about this.  
- This, along with point 4 above, sounds a lot like a "The check is  
in the mail" response.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 48/60


6) According to their own SEC 10-K filings, paper consumption in China rose approximately 10.45% in 2007 from
2006 (page 6 of 2008 10-K SEC filing), yet ONP's revenue from 2007 rose 29.9% (page F-5 of 2007 SEC filing). The
paper consumption in China rose approximately 8.85% in 2008 from 2007 (page 7 of 2009 filing), yet ONP's revenue
rose 64.2% (page 25 of 2008 filing). Repeat, China's consumption up 8.85%, ONP's revenue up 64.2%! 
Having watched different videos of their production plant, I really did not see anything special about their process that
would warrant such an increase.


7) Discrepency in their SEC filings regarding their Competitive Edge -  
In the 2008 10-K filing, they state: "Because we are approximately 75 miles (120 kilometers) from Beijing...our largest
target market,..." [page 11 of filing under Price Advantage]. 
In the 2009 10-K filing they state: "...because we are approximately 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Beijing,...and our
largest target market,..." [page 11 of filing under Cost Advantage].  
What? Did they move their entire production plant a whole 15 miles closer to Beijing? While this might account for
some of their increased revenue, I found no mention of ONP having moved their plant. To the contrary, they have
stated in their filings how they are currently leasing the land on a 30-year lease signed in 2002.


8) According to their 2009 10-K filing, the reason for the drastic 56% increase in revenue was due in part to "year
2008, the interruption of production and delivery schedule before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games with respect to our
sales to customers in and around Beijing;..." [page 29 of 2009 SEC 10-K filing]. Keep in mind they had a 64.2%
INCREASE in revenue for the 2008 year. Yet, they state the Olympic Games were an "interruption".


9) One of ONP's main investing firms - ROTH Capital - has suspended coverage of ONP until the results of the
independent audit are known. Not what I would call a vote of confidence.


Now, each point taken by themselves, maybe nothing to be concerned about. However, taken together forming a
clearer picture, I think you can understand why I, personally, have my doubts about the innocence of ONP. Put
another way, if a friend were to ask me whether they should invest their money in ONP stock, I could not with a clear
conscience say "yes." I would advise them to put their money in a different company.


As I've stated before in a previous comment, I truly hope everyone who has invested in ONP (whether by long
position or short) makes a profit off their stock.

Well, they have been reporting profits since their IPO. All the analysts, including Muddy Waters, say they have
positive earnings. Muddy Waters argument is that they overstated earnings by 27 times. That still means they have
positive earnings. 
$1.03 per share / 27 = $0.04


Still positive.


30 Jul 2010, 09:24 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Modie: 
You are confusing net profit with total revenue. Muddy Waters reported that ONP overstated revenue by 27 times, not
earnings. Muddy Waters stated that ONP reported a net loss in 2008 of RMB 2,861,941.41 (about $400,000.00) in
their audited PRC , as stated in the audited PRC financial results filed with a local government entity. 
If ONP was making money, why would multiple insiders be loaning it money to fund working capital? ONP reported
the following loans for working capital purposes: 
(1) The CEO of ONP reported loaning money over a period of time for working capital purposes that amounted to
$6,148,710 as of March 31, 2009. 
(2) On August 8, 2008 a member of the Board of Directors loaned money for working capital purposes amount to
$880,200 as of March 31, 2009. 
(3) On August 5, 2008, a member of the Board of Directors loaned money to ONP for working capital purposes which
amounted to $1,098,075 as of March 31, 2009. 
According to an article recommending to stear clear of ONP,  
his issue was brought up in a June 8, 2009 Motley Fool article, it is generally a torubled company that is resorting to
loans from multiple insiders to fund working capital. See "Beware Chinese Penny Stocks" dated June 8, 2009, at
caps.fool.com/Blogs/be.... 
ONP is the only one reporting they had positive numbers - all the other people you refer, including the analysts, were
just taking those numbers as true. There have been many questions raised that cast doubt on ONP"s reports.


31 Jul 2010, 12:55 PM


Michael Bryant, Contributor
Why do you look at he past when we should be focused on the present and future of the company? Isn't that what
investors do? In 2008, ONP was obviously not doing as well as it is now.


The Board owns the company, so they are just reinvesting in their own company.


And why does a large, profitable companies borrow debt even though they have enough cash to pay off that debt? 
1. The interest they make from the cash is more than the interest they pay for the debt. ONP can probably compound
the money 100% by the time it is due. 
2. It is safe business practice to save for rainy days. This is what Nortel did. They spent all their cash, and when
things got sour, they collapsed. Krispy Kremes is another example.

Modie: 
I have a hard time making sense of what you are saying. Are you saying that one should not look at the history of a
company when evaluating it for a investment decision? I cannot agree with this as it makes no sense to me. 
I didn't criticize ONP for borrowing money from the bank. There are lots of reasons large companies borrow money
from the bank and it doesn't make a lot of snese to go into all of them right now, particular as that iwas not my
criticism. 
I don't believe ONP can compound the cash at all. 
ONP reported that the loans were needed for working capital. Do you know what working capital is? They did not
report they were saving for a rainy day and there is no evidence I see of any savings.

seasaw64: 
Right. They were using the borrowed money to fund operations. That is what I said or should have been implied. Any
cash they made is saved for rainy days, and the borrowed money is used for operations.


And what is investing? Don't you invest in the future? That is the definition of investing. When small companies start,
people invest in them because they have an idea or something. There is no history to look at. ONP is a small
company. Amazon was loosing money in its early days. Would you invest in them? If you did, you would have made a
ton of money.


Further, most of the time, stocks don't go up if they don't give a good forecast even if they surprised for the current
quarter. Again, investing in the future.


02 Aug 2010, 10:37 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Modie: 
As I said, the problem was that the CEO and other insiders claim to have been loaning a significant amount of money
to fund working capital. ONP did not have any cash saved for rainy days. They didn't have enough cash to operate -
instead the reports indicate insiders were having to loan millions of dollars for ONP to operate. 
The loans by insiders to fund the business were not investments, they were loans to fund the operations because it
was not making enough cash to continue operating. 
I am not aware of Amazon having insiders make loans to fund working capital. Amazon is a completely different
business than ONP - they are not comparable.

Isn't that what insiders do. They lend, buy shares, or whatever to keep the company running. And you don't just lend

CSMhater
Seasaw64 or ChinaCompanyAnalyst:


Since both of you seem well versed in the manner of finances, could either of you explain something that I'm unclear
on? In ONP's 2008 10-K SEC filing, they state "the Chinese currency (Renminbi Yuan) has been appreciating against
the U.S. dollar, leading to an increase in net revenue as reported in U.S. dollars." [page 26, 2008 SEC 10-K filing,
under Net Revenue]; yet they state they "rely entirely on revenues earned in the PRC..." [page 19, 2008 SEC 10-K
filing under The Fluctuation of the Renminbi May Harm Your Investment].  
- Two things:


1) If they rely entirely on revenues earned in the PRC, how can they claim the dollar-yuan conversion could partially
account for their increase in net revenue?


2) With the appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, wouldn't that mean ONP is actually making LESS money than
they would lead us to believe? It would take less yuan to make a U.S. dollar. 
Doing a quick year average conversion, from 2007 to 2008, it would appear there is at least a 6% discrepency. 
1/1/2007 - $1 = 7.8041 yuan 
1/1/2008 - $1 = 7.2946 yuan 
- year average: $1 = 7.54935 yuan 
1/2/2009 - $1 = 6.82302 yuan 
- year average: $1 = 7.05881 yuan


Wouldn't it be more accurate to try and calculate their yearly earnings using the same dollar-yuan conversion, if
possible? 
I'm just trying to gather information so I will be better prepared if I decide to invest in a different Chinese company.


Thanks for any clarification you can give me.

Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
As pointed out in a June 2009 Motley Fool article, when insiders are lending money to the company for working
capital, it is generally a sign of a troubled company. A very small percentage of publicly traded companies have any
loans from insiders for working capital and when they do, it is almost always viewed as a negative sign for the
company. 
Amazon is irrelevant to the discussion. I can show you hundreds and hundreds of failures for every 1 successful
amazon. Again, Amazon doesn't have insider loans for working capital.

So where do they get the money to finance operations in the first place? From the bank? That's not how the Dutch
East Indian Company started. To me, if I were an insider and owned a significant amount of the company (that's what
insiders are by definition), I would rather loan money to the company than have the company borrow from the bank,
and the bank collects interest.


03 Aug 2010, 10:24 AM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
Modie: 
You seem to be missing my point. The company resorting to insiders providing loans for working capital is generally
considered problematic. It generally means the company is doing poorly. 
ONP's operating entity claims to have started in 1996, so it is not like they needed money to get started. 
Listen, if you think it is a good sign for insiders to be providing loans to fund working capital, that is your prerogative. It
is not my view and historically, companies that did that were shown to be having financial problems.

I see ONP has retained Deloitte Touche as the independent company to investigate the allegations raised by Muddy
Waters. Does everyone think this will help clear ONP of the accusations, or not? The reason why I ask is because the
wording in the released statement indicates "Deloitte will provide support to Loeb & Loeb, which is working with the
Company's audit committee..." 
I'm a bit unclear as to what "provide support" really means. I thought whatever company did the audit was going to
conduct an independent audit of their own. This just seems to cloud up the issues even more. Could anyone provide
any clarification on this?

Sounds good to me. Many here questioned their intent of actually hiring a Big 4 auditing firm given it has been a few
weeks since they expressed their intent. Well, they have retained them and Deloitte will be staking their reputation on
the legitimacy of their findings.


03 Aug 2010, 02:47 PM


CSMhater
Playing Devil's Advocate, the wording of the statement indicates Deloitte Touche will "provide support" versus doing a
full independent audit; which would give them wiggle room to claim innocence if later down the road something else
comes to light to cast suspicion on ONP. It just seems Deloitte, Loeb & Loeb, and ONP are still trying to cover their
backside - especially Deloitte. I'd feel more confident if Deloitte came right out and said that they were going to
conduct a full audit independently with support FROM Loeb & Loeb. I was raised learning to take accountability for

Author’s reply »  Deloitte is not doing an audit. It is providing "support" to Loeb & Loeb, and will "assist" it in its
"investigation". It's unclear what Loeb will ask of them and how the assisting will proceed.


Providing support and assisting does not equate to an audit.


The arguments that ONP is falsifying its financial statements are extensive and compelling. In my opinion, the
company is defrauding investors and the actual underlying business generates meaningfully less profit than its SEC
filings indicate.


The hiring of Deloitte to assist Loeb in its investigation doesn't make these arguments any less compelling, or ONP
any less of a fraud.

Without sugar coating, they are going to be involved in going through everything to dispute MWs claims. They are not
doing a full audit, but just the claims made by MW. It is funny how shorts try to spin everything, even this, into a
negative.

I'm adult enough to admit when I was wrong - you were correct in your original statement about Loeb & Loeb
conducting the audit. While the statements by ONP would lead someone to believe one of the Big 4 firms was going
to conduct the audit, re-reading the statement, nowhere did they specifically state one of the Big 4 firms was going to
actually do the audit themselves.


ONP only state they have "decided to retain Loeb & Loeb LLP, who plans to work with the Company's Audit
Committee to retain a Big Four audit firm, to conduct an independent investigation into the issue..." 
- I only now noticed how the wording could mean Loeb & Loeb will retain a Big 4 firm to conduct their (meaning Loeb
& Loeb's) "independent investigation".

Later in the press release ONP will "...take the exceptional step of retaining a top-tier international law firm and a Big
Four audit firm to conduct an independent third-party investigation..." 
- I only now noticed how it was stated a law firm AND a Big Four audit firm - there was never any mention of one of
the Big 4 firms separately conducting an investigation. 
Nowhere did it ever state ONP was going to hire a Big Four firm and that the Big Four firm was going to conduct it's
own independent investigation of Muddy Waters' allegations.


Again, it appears you were right in stating Loeb & Loeb was going to be conducting the "independent" audit.


It's this type of sneaky, oily, wording by ONP that really makes me wonder if they are as innocent as they claim to be.
If ONP were really innocent of all the allegations, why wouldn't they have hired Deloitte (or any of the other Big Four
firms) to conduct an independent audit, instead of just providing "support"?


p.s. ChineseCompanyAnalyst, were you a lawyer at one time? (I meant this as a compliment). You seem to be the
only one to have caught the tricky wording of ONP's statements! Everyone else (myself included) interpreted the
statement the way they wanted it mean.


And to everyone else - NO, I am not short-ing this company's stock. I'm waiting to see how everything shakes out. I
just truly want to get all the facts (as much as they are available) about this company's finances before re-investing
my hard-earned money into this particular company.

Michael Anderson, Contributor
You are either very ignorant or purposely posting misleading statements. It was obvious that a full audit was
not going to be done from the beginning because they are doing this to dispute just the claims made by
Muddy Waters. Both of the firms are very reputable and they are going to provide the information that they
find, especially Deloitte as they are not going to hurt themselves over a small amount by not revealing certain
details. They were brought in to help disprove Muddy Waters. I do not understand what you are confused
about or what you find misleading. You are just taking small aspects of the releases and turning it into
something that it is not. The way you make it seem is that they are in cohoots with one another and will not
provide damaging evidence if found. Again, neither Loeb and Loeb nor Deloitte is going to damage their
reputation over a small amount of money and a small company. What ONP is doing, is very commendable
and they are doing a tremendous job trying to put these claims to rest. Pretty much, it is an investigation using
both of these firms to disprove the claims by Muddy Waters. It is as simple as that.

1) I never claimed (or thought) any firm was going to be doing a "full audit" of ONP - just the allegations
brought forward by Muddy Waters. 
- However, since the allegations by Muddy Waters go back at least two years, the audit would have to be
quite thorough to completely exonerate ONP.

2) Have you actually read the entire string of comments? Almost everyone was jumping down
ChineseCompanyAnalyst's throat about how Loeb & Loeb was NOT conducting the audit, that they were
merely going to hire a Big Four firm. However, the press release from today clearly states : "Deloitte will
provide support to Loeb & Loeb, which is working with the Company's audit committee...", and later in the
release "...Deloitte, which has outstanding capabilities, to support the full investigation..." 
- Nowhere did it state Loeb & Loeb would be providing support to Deloitte as it conducts the investigation into
Muddy Waters' allegations. I'm sure even you can understand the difference as to who is supporting whom,
and how that relates to which company is heading the investigation.  
- Also, just for clarification, it is auditing firms who have to sign off on 10-K SEC filings regarding the financial
statements, not law firms. An accountant is not the same as a lawyer. Therefore, I would be more inclined to
believe the findings of an independent AUDITING firm in this particular issue than a law firm. 
- Perhaps you could clarify as to why Loeb & Loeb would be conducting the investigation? Like I've stated
numerous times, I'm just trying to get all the facts so I can be better informed if I decide to re-invest in this
company.


3) I don't believe I implied Deloitte was "in cohoots" with ONP (if I did, I apologize), I merely stated all the
companies involved seemed more concerned with covering their backside, and the wording of "provide
support" allows for Deloitte to claim ignorance if something else should come to light which questions ONP's
innocence. Nowhere (yet) has there been any clarification of just how much "support" Deloitte will be
providing. 
Perhaps you have some clairvoyance, (or maybe an insider contact?) as to what, exactly, "providing support"
would/does entail. That's the part that I am "confused about."


4) I myself had stated in previous comments posted that I did not believe one of the Big Four firms would "hurt
themselves" over a Micro-cap company. I actually implied in a previous comment that whichever auditing firm
was brought on, they would not want to do anything that would make them go by way of Arthur Andersen,
when the term was actually the Big Five. 
- While I do not believe Deloitte would withhold damaging evidence, I re-state that by being in a supporting
role, it's easy for them to claim ignorance if something else comes out - they would easily be able to say "Hey,
we didn't know. We were just the supporting cast."


4) As most people would agree, it's usually in the little details that a fabricated story gets tripped up on. 
- To that end, have you read and combed through ONP's last couple of 10-K SEC filings? There are
discrepencies that make me question if ONP is reporting accurate financial information.


5) I myself find it commendable that ONP is trying (emphasis on trying) to disprove the allegations by Muddy
Waters. I have stated quite a few times before that I am not entirely convinced of Muddy Waters' allegations
due to what I perceive is a lack of documented proof. However, neither side has come out with overwhelming
evidence to convince me their side of this dispute is the correct one. 
- I'm still waiting for an update on the the supposed "field trip" ONP was organizing for some of it's larger
institutional investors to clarify questions regarding details of some of their purchase agreements. Maybe you
have some additional information regarding this point that you could share. I would appreciate any information
you could provide.

Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
CSMhater: 
Orient Paper did not report that they were trying to disprove Muddy Waters allegations. Instead, the new members of
the board of directors, who are the members of the audit committee, stated they were investigating the allegations by
Muddy Waters - in other words, investigating whether management was committting fraud. This is not typically done if
management can answer the fraud allegations satisfactorily to the audit committee or if the allegations can be
dismissed out of hand. 
Of course, there may be additional motivation because the new members were put in by the investors in the recent
capital raise, who have a make good provision, were 3,000,000 shares have been escrowed if Orient Paper does not
make a required net profit of, I believe, approximatley $18 million. If Orient Paper has a net profit of $0, the investors
get the entire 3 million shares. Can anyone say "bingo"?

…seasaw64 and all: 
There has always been something curious about Muddy Waters and their “arrangement in Kowloon(part of Hong
Kong) not mainland China, and their presence in the US.(a feed store in Silver City, Nevada). They are heavily
insulated from legal action against them. So on the surface it would appear that Muddy Waters was created to publish
derogatory reports against ONP. It seems to me that someone went to a lot of trouble just to slam ONP. An easier way
would be to just spread bad will on all the blogs, submit articles to publications like “The`Street” and the WSJ, etc. The
net damage would be about the same. Seasaw’s comment about “Investors” being on the audit committee. And the 3
million shares is escrow, made me wonder if there is something else in play here.


Was the additional capital raised private capital, or a secondary offering? If it was a secondary offering to the public,
how were these “Investors” chosen that sit on the audit committee?  
If the additional capital was private, it would confirm my suspicion that Muddy Waters is trying to drive the price of
ONP down in order for these private investors to take the company private on the cheap. Sort of a different angle for a
hostile take over. 
I could just be spinning my wheels here, but it is just too coincidental that the existence of Muddy Waters seems to be
to attack ONP and nothing else. I have not seen anything else come from Muddy Waters, no research an other
companies, no list of stocks that they are covering , nothing. Does anyone else find this a bit odd?

Okay, now I'm starting to get confused. I was of the mistaken impression it was actually ONP that started the whole
"independent investigation" to refute Muddy Waters' allegations. At the beginning almost everyone kept referring to
ONP hiring Loeb & Loeb. And as far as refuting the allegation, according to the comment by michael_anderson210 (4
comments above) : "...they are doing this to dispute just the claims made by Muddy Waters."


Let me see if I have this correct.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 57/60


1) It was the Board of Directors who hired Loeb & Loeb [per the press release of July 16, 2010]


2) It was Loeb & Loeb who retained Deloitte Touche [per the press release of August 3, 2010]


3) Loeb & Loeb will be conducting the investigation into the allegations raised by Muddy Waters.


4) Deloitte Touche will "provide support" to Loeb & Loeb. (meaning Loeb & Loeb, for lack of a better term, will be the
lead investigating firm)


5) Loeb & Loeb, along with Deloitte Touche, will be working with the Audit Committee of ONP's Board of Directors.


6) So it appears there are at least 3 separate entities working together on this investigation. (the phrase "Too many
cooks in the kitchen" comes to mind!)


Do I have everything correct so far?


You indicated the investigation is not necessarily setting out to disprove Muddy Waters' allegations; you also seem to
indicate the Audit Committee of ONP's Board of Directors themselves are not entirely convinced of ONP's innocence.
Is my interpretation of your comments correct? If this is the reason for the independent investigation, that is definitely
not a vote of confidence in ONP; kind of along the lines of ROTH Capital suspending coverage.


A couple of other points I am still unclear on:  
1) What exactly is Loeb & Loeb's role in the investigation? Since Deloitte is providing the support, I would assume
Loeb & Loeb is in charge of the investigation. More to the point, why is the law firm the one in charge?


2) ONP keeps using the term "investigation" versus "audit". Is this something we, as potential investors, should be
concerned about? 
"Investigate" by definition means: "1a) inquire into; examine. b) make an official inquiry into." 
Whereas "audit" means: "An unbiased examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization." 
There's a definite difference between the two. As just about anyone who's ever had to sign a contract knows, the
wording and definition of the wording are very important. And while the issues raised by Muddy Waters are not strictly
financial (i.e. the daily paper production), the main issues center on revenue - by ONP, HBOP, and ONP's customers.
It seems ONP and the Board of Directors have been very careful to keep using the word "investigation", not "audit". I
would think "audit" holds more accountability into the findings. I don't know if I'm reading too much into this. Your
thoughts? 
I guess what I'm trying to make sense of, is this - Should the announcement of the "independent investigation" be
taken as a sign of ONP's innocence (like a lot of people seem to think)? 
A lot of people seem to take the announcement of Deloitte Touche being retained as an automatic sign of ONP's
innocence. I still think I'll wait until the findings of the investigation are complete before agreeing with that conclusion.

CSMhater: 
I agree with almost everything you said. Not sure that "there are too many cooks in the kitchen" at this point, though. 
The press release said that the law firm was being hired to investigate the allegations of Muddy Waters - in other
words, the claims that management was embezzling and committing fraud. There was nothing about any investigation
into any claims or allegatiosn against Muddy Waters.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/215804-orient-paper-loebs-not-the-right-firm-for-the-investigation 58/60


My point is when to you hire a law firm to investigate allegations that management committed fraud and
embezzlement? You do it when their is something to investigate, when management has been unable to establish
conclusively and convincingly that it did not committe embezzlement and fraud. Otherwise, the company can present
the conclusive and convincing evidence to investors and an investigation is a waste of time.  
I don't know specifically what Loeb & Loebe will do in the investigation, so I would have to speculate. As far as why a
law firm was hired to be in charge, I suspect for several reasons, all of them for legal reasons. First, they may be
anticipating litigation, such as a class action suit, so a good idea to have a law firm in charge to prepare the defense.
They also will also be able to try to claim attorney client privilege not just for their communications with the law firm,
but for all the communications with the law firm, which might not occur if just an accounting firm was involved.
Additionally, if further action is needed, legal advice may be necessary. For example, I suspect the CEO will be
blamed and removed.  
I believe that the law firm has been hired to do an investigation into claims of fraud and embezzlement by
management. I cannot say this is the wrong action, it may be very appropriate. They may do an audit as well, I am not
sure yet. I think an audit is in order.  
Of course, I think the investigation is a bad sign. When has it occured that a company hired a law firm to investigate
claims of fraud and embezzlement, or other malfeasance, by management and it turned out good for the company? I
have asked this numerous times and no one has been able to identify a single time. Imagine if the audit committee of
Bank of America, or any other company, announced that it had hired a law firm to investigate allegations of fraud and
embezzlement by the CEO. Would you take this as good news? Would anyone?  
I think you are right. To evaluate the investigation, it has to occur first, we have to see what they do and how they do
it, and review any report or actions taken. I certainly think that you can't prejudge it. 
However, I have formed opinions based on Orient Paper's own SEC filings, press releases, websites, videos of their
facilities, and statements by management. In my opinion, Orient Paper needs to immediately announce that its SEC
filings cannot be relied on and must be restated. That is the appropriate action because the SEC filings are so
inconsistent, both internally and with other sources of the company's representations.

Wow! Looks like you were right on the mark as far as why a law firm would be heading the investigation. I just read
how Rosen Law Firm has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors. Definitely not a good sign for ONP.
Although, since this is only a civil lawsuit, it could be argued that nothing has been proven yet as to the guilt (or
innocence) of ONP. Personally, I'm still just waiting to see how everything shakes out before investing in them.


-Side note, does anyone have any idea how long this could potentially drag out?

How's this for another prediction; 
1. law firm find that ONP made little to nothing, or a net loss, in 2009. (CEO likely found to have embezzled, made
transaction from company bank accounts to personal bank accounts, and let go, as well as possibly other executives).

2. ONP is then found not to meet the net profit performance threshold requirements found in the capital raise (PIPE)
agreement signed in october of 2009. 
3. As a result of ONP not meeting the net profit requirements, the original investors in the capital raise get the 3
million shares (or a portion thereof) that were escrowed in case ONP did not make the target. 
4. The original investors, hedge funds and other investment firms, may be short at this point and may use the 3 million
shares they receive (or a portion thereof) to cover their shorts. 
Could the original investors have known ONP was a fraud? Could they have then organized the pump by the
street.com writers, by wallstreetmedia.com, by the analysts Roth Capital, Hudson Securities, Harbinger, and others?
Could they then have sold their shares as the stock price rose? Could they have then shorted the stock and paid or
other incentivized Muddy Waters to reveal the truth about ONP - that its revenue was fraudulently inflated? 
Of course, I have no idea and all of this is pure speculation. But, of course, if you know a company is fraud, it may be
possible to do all this if you make a securities purchase agreement where you get 8.3 million shares for $5 million
dollars, where you get 3 million shares, or a portion thereof, if net profit of the company fails to meet performance
thresholds, and, as part of the agreement, 3 new independent directors are appointed that now make up the majority
on the board of directors.  
Is truth sometimes stranger than fiction? 
That leaves the question as to who is pumping the stock now on seekingalpha.com and yahoo message board? well,
whoever is holding the bag would be a likely candidate. It could be the CEO, if he really owns his shares, or whoever
has control of them if he doesn't. Those shares are the subject of a lockup agreement in the purchase agreement of
the capital raise, so they can't be sold until October of 2010. it could also be supported by some of the pumpers who
may have been unwitting pawns in the fraud and may still be true believers. It could also be a smattering of retail
investors who are in denial. Whoever it it, they certainly lack the size, power and force of the original pumping
machine of the street.com, wallstreetmedia.com, the analysts, and other groups. 
Of course, all this is just speculation or one theory as to how the facts fit together. There may be other better theories.
As you can see, I keep seeing holes in my theories and, as a result, try to develop better ones.

Thanks for the kind words. Just had a nice vacation recently, but should have another one soon, I agree. Also, I am
very well rested, although it does appear that I have never needed near as much sleep as most people seem to need.
Hope you have a good vacation and are well rested as well.

It seems not too long ago, John Bird was deep frying wings at Golden Fried Chicken of America. Seriously I do not
have enough of an imagination to make this stuff up.


He also, from what I can see, tried to do a few other business ventures including installing alarm systems, and
something called equuspring.


I'm not sure when or why stock bashing came about but he perhaps he failed badly at the other things and needs
money?
