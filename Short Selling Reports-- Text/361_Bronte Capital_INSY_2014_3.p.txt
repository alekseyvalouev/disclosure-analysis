The sometimes eccentric views of John Hempton

The New York Times pile onto Insys
The New York Times picks up where this blog leaves off, piling onto Insys Therapeutics. To quote: 
 


Interviews with several former Insys sales representatives suggest the company, based
in Chandler, Ariz., has aggressively marketed the painkiller, including to physicians who
did not treat many cancer patients and by paying its sales force higher commissions for
selling higher doses of the drug. 


Under F.D.A. rules, manufacturers may market prescription drugs only for approved
uses. But doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit. Over the last decade,
pharmaceutical companies have paid billions of dollars to settle claims that they
encouraged doctors to use drugs for nonapproved treatments, or so-called off-label
uses, to increase sales and profits. 


Drug-safety experts said the range of medical professionals who appeared to be
prescribing Subsys was troubling, particularly given concerns about the widespread use
— and abuse — of narcotic painkillers. In December, Insys disclosed that it had
received a subpoena from the federal health department’s Office of the Inspector
General for documents related to its sales and marketing practices. The company has
said it is cooperating with the investigation.


 
Marketing the drug off-label is a criminal offence and as the drug has near substitutes it will not be
much if any loss to consumers if this company were closed. 
 
The Feds are clearly interested having indicted a doctor who was allegedly prescribing large
quantities of the drug off-label. 
 
Can somebody please explain to me why this company is trading at 21 times historic earnings and
almost 7 times historic sales? Because I don't quite get it.

You are barking in the wrong forest looking at comparative valuation metrics with this type
of stock. Not everyone buys or doesn't buy on comparative valuations - the public buys
future prospects stories/incremental good news and some do not even look at those
metrics. 
 
It got ramped up there on a tight float/promotion. Kapoor according to Reuters held
31.69m/92.67% of the shares with a possible double counted Kapoor Childrens Trust
holding 4.2m 12.27% (=106% of outstanding in total) leaving a float of max 2.5m shares.
So that is how it got there. With maybe Max 2.5m share free easy to get it up there - not
so easy to get the market to digest 32m shares at those levels but around twice that

number have changed hands. Nice bit of gradient work. Maybe the 3:2 split on Mar31
was to facilitate this. Not sure how many shares Kapoor holds now.  
 
Can send you the charts and a 1880's telegraph operators green visor to wear while
looking at them if you want.
