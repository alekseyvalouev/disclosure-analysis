Summary

ZYXI


We identify UnitedHealthcare as Zynex’s largest payor and estimate it was paying
~7x more per order relative to other commercial insurers, artificially sustaining the
weak underlying business.


We find UHC recently changed its TENS coverage policy which may lower its
payments to Zynex by 80% - equivalent to 40-100% of 2021 EBITDA.


Reimbursement pressure is evident in accounts receivable which ballooned in Q3,
outpacing revenue growth. Days sales outstanding rose to highest level in over 4
years.


Zynex could be forced to modify its revenue recognition and write-down accounts
receivable to adjust for the new policy.

At the same time, Zynex’s CEO will likely continue to tap his 43% stake to meet
substantial personal cash flow needs.

The bull case for Zynex Medical (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:ZYXI, "the Company") is based
on the belief that insurers would continue to pay for its overpriced TENS units and
generic electrodes because waste and abuse is ingrained in the US healthcare system.
"Everyone is overbilling." The idea proved more resilient than we expected. We thought
payors, particularly commercial insurers, would have a better handle on waste and
abuse, especially involving products as unproven and primitive as transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units which are technologically on par with transistor
radios. Skeptics like us believed Zynex would eventually collapse, the only question was
when. We think the end is in sight.

Temporary Payor Vulnerabilities Enabled Zynex Turnaround


We have identified UnitedHealthcare (UHC), the benefits division of parent UnitedHealth
Group (NYSE: UNH), as Zynex's largest payor and primary target of abuse. We
estimate UHC was paying Zynex ~7x more per order relative to other commercial
insurers. We find the insurer recently changed its coverage policy for TENS, which
will cut its reimbursement to Zynex by approximately 80%. Consequently, Zynex
will lose high margin orders that we estimate account for 40-100% of 2021
EBITDA.


Zynex was already showing signs of nearing the limit of what insurers would tolerate,
backing away from aggressive hiring guidance and reducing staff beginning in Q1 2021.
Now after being cut-off by a large source of earnings, Zynex will be left with few options,
none of them good for shareholders. Any meaningful order growth will likely come at the
expense of margins as the average reimbursement per order turns loss making. Zynex
could focus on pockets of high reimbursement, but this means becoming a much
smaller company.


If the stock weren't about to be crushed fundamentally, it will nonetheless be pressured
by CEO Thomas Sandgaard who is selling stock to meet his significant cash flow needs.
In 2020 Sandgaard, whose wealth is tied up in his 43% stake in the company, bought a
3rd-tier English football club that was burning through £1m per month. Sandgaard most
recently tapped his shares in August 2021 ahead of the league's transfer deadline. His
Premier League aspirations will require copious funding underwritten by unwitting Zynex
shareholders.


With the fundamentals and technicals aligned, we think now is a great time to be short
Zynex.


It's important to remember that before Zynex began its rise from an OTC penny stock in
2017, its underlying business was so weak that it was on the edge of bankruptcy under
the weight of a $3m line of credit [Pg. 9]. At the end of 2016, Zynex couldn't even pay
the premiums on its liability, property and auto insurance [Pg. 25].


Then out of nowhere the business improved. Zynex was offering the same unpatented,
archaic TENS unit yet revenue per order nearly tripled from 2016 to 2017 - suddenly the
business was profitable.

UnitedHealthcare Closes Reimbursement Policy Weakness


The improvement was never well explained. After the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted competitive bidding in 2015, slashing Medicare
reimbursements for TENS, public reimbursement policy has remained weak. Sandgaard
claims the upswing was the result of increased market share after the exit of two large
competitors. He's likely referring to an increased share of the workers' compensation
market, which pays TENS claims at levels far above average. We think Sandgaard was
also referring to patients insured by UnitedHealthcare which we believe has been
Zynex's largest single source of high margin revenue since the turnaround in 2017.


We think Zynex's unexpected "hockey stick" growth in 2017 was due to 1) an
increased share of workers' compensation patients and, 2) the exploitation of
reimbursement policy weakness at UnitedHealthcare.


The workers' compensation market might be the last area where the TENS business is
feasible, due to an arcane and poorly controlled reimbursement and coding framework.
While our checks with workers' comp investigators indicate the industry is tamping down
on Zynex's abusive billing tactics, our focus here is on UHC and its new policy which we
think will render the business unviable in its current form.


UHC did not have an official TENS coverage policy until recently. Instead, the insurer
negotiated reimbursement rates and allowable supplies with manufacturers ad hoc.
Sometime in 2017 it appears Zynex was able to negotiate a nonsensical quantity of
electrodes per patient - 64 pairs per month, a figure we confirmed with UHC
employees and patient claim forms.

Exhibit 1 - Supplies as percentage of revenue jumps in 2017


Source: Financial statements


Sandgaard hinted at this during the Q4 2017 call in response to a question about the
increase in supplies revenue (bold emphasis added):


"And then we have also seen that there are some insurance plans that actually
allow for more supplies than we have, we've been able to negotiate in the past.
That's very much a negotiating item and by being able to negotiate well and make
sure that the patients get the supplies that they actually need."


An increased share of workers' comp patients and the new opportunity to dump massive
quantities of electrodes on UHC patients led to major shifts in the company's financials:
supplies rose to 79% of revenue in 2017 after averaging 39% between 2009 and 2016
(Zynex breaks out revenue for devices and supplies). Revenue per order increased
160% Y/Y in 2017 - while device revenue per order decreased. Operating margins,
negative to slightly better than flat in the years prior, jumped to 38%. UHC and workers'
comp propped up an otherwise limp, money losing business.

Zynex exploited UHC's reimbursement vulnerability through 2020, and concurrently
grew its salesforce by roughly 5x which naturally led to order and revenue growth.
Investors saw a rapidly expanding, profitable company with no significant competition.
Sandgaard meanwhile was making reckless projections - at a time when the average
sale rep was generating just above $200K in annual sales, he touted plans of an 800-
person salesforce generating $800m in sales, utterly ludicrous figures for the TENS
market. Zynex stock went from $0.10 in 2016 to nearly $30 in 2020.


Unfortunately for Zynex, UHC eventually woke up. In February 2021, UHC announced
a new coverage policy for TENS effective May 2021 which specifies the quantity of
supplies allowed per prescription. The policy stipulates "usual maximum utilization" is
one or two units of a monthly supply pack which includes electrodes, batteries, and
conductive gel.

Processed Claims Show Policy Effect and Damage to Zynex


Source: UnitedHealthcare


Instead of being reimbursed for 64 pairs of electrodes per patient every month, Zynex is
limited to at most two units of a supply pack.


Our prior work on Zynex, which included interviewing former employees and reviewing
the reimbursement policies of numerous commercial insurers, led us to suspect UHC
was reimbursing Zynex abnormally. This was confirmed when a UHC insured patient
sent us Zynex claims information.


Zynex's standard monthly claim was for lead wires, 2 batteries, and 64 pairs of
electrodes. For the electrodes, Zynex was billing an "MSRP rate" of $49.50 per pair for a
total of $3,168 per month. Over 10 months, the patient received 640 pairs of
electrodes.


Exhibit 4 - 640 pairs of electrodes received by UHC patient over 10 months

When UHC approved the claims, it allowed $0 for the batteries, $14 for lead wires and
almost $520 for the electrodes (UHC pays Zynex the total allowable minus the patient's
copay). Including $250 for the device, Zynex was collecting nearly $5,600 for patients
with UHC commercial health plans over the average 10-month prescription.

After two months, concerned about their co-pay obligation the patient reported the
excessive quantities to UHC which flagged the patient's file and led to denials of 4 of 8
submitted claims. Relevant for Zynex investors is the change in denial reasons.


Exhibit 6 - UHC policy change prohibits abusive coding by Zynex


Source: UnitedHealthcare patient, NMR


As shown in Exhibit 6, UHC had been denying claims due to "incomplete medical
records", meaning Zynex did not provide documentation to support the medical
necessity of 64 pairs of electrodes (note UHC would have paid these claims had the
patient not complained). Two months after the new TENS policy went into effect in May
2021, UHC began denying the claims for improper coding as Zynex was still billing with
the "unbundled" electrodes HCPCS code A4556 rather than one or two units of the
supply pack using the "bundled" code A4595. The use of "unbundled" codes is a
common method of fraud and abuse in healthcare billing.


Two claims were approved for $115.62 without being reviewed to meet regulatory
compliance timelines. Although both are subject to review and recovery, the $115.62 for
6 units of A4595 ($19.27 each) is the best case for Zynex going forward - an 80%
reduction in the rare case UHC pays a claim without review. But the likely outcome is
that both claims will be denied upon review and Zynex will be left with $38.54 for two
units of A4595.


The most recent claim was denied due to "evidence that services have been
misrepresented". Here, UHC reviewed the claim and determined that 6 units of the
supply pack, instead of 1 or 2, was a misrepresentation of provided services.

Using Zynex's stated average reimbursement duration per device of 10 months, we

The Ugly Math: Revenue Loss Equivalent to 40-110% 2021E EBITDA


Not only will Zynex lose revenue - it's margins will be materially impacted. We estimate
the average reimbursement per UHC order was ~5x the ex-UHC average, skewing the
overall average higher and making a big contribution to margins. Using Medicare's fee
schedule, our estimate of commercial insurance reimbursement and our work on UHC,
we estimate reimbursement by payor and worker's comp orders which we think lie
somewhere in the middle:


Exhibit 9 - Estimated average reimbursement per order by payor


Source: NMR estimates


Based on discussions with CFO Dan Moorhead, who told us that UHC is Zynex's
largest source of revenue, and the company's disclosures which note that two
payors make up 37% of accounts receivable [Pg. 16], we think UHC may account
for only 2-5% of orders, but 10-25% of revenue. As such, the UHC orders are highly
capital efficient - Zynex won't be able to simply reduce expenses to offset the lost
revenue.


Exhibit 10 - We think UHC is a small part of orders but larger part of revenue

Exhibit 11 - Equivalent loss estimate for 2021E earnings


Source: NMR estimates


Assuming the new policy cuts UHC reimbursement per order by 80%, depending on
how much UHC makes up of current revenue, it's possible Zynex will be left unprofitable
going forward (Exhibit 11).


Early effects of the new policy are evident in Q3 accounts receivable which rose by
$5.9m Q/Q vs an increase in revenue of $3.8m. Days sales outstanding (DSO)
increased sequentially by 17% to over 60 days, its highest level in over four years.

It Could Get Worse: UHC May Attempt to Recoup Millions in
Overpayments from Zynex


We think the large receivables and DSO increases are at least partly due to lower
collections from UHC, and that Zynex hasn't yet changed its revenue assumptions to
account for the policy. As a result, most of the receivables attributed to UHC in Q3 and
on may not be collectable. If so, Zynex will eventually have to write-down accounts
receivable and restate earnings. Precedent occurred in 2009 when Zynex
underestimated payor discounts forcing it to restate receivables and net income lower
for the year prior by ~50% and 95% respectively [Pg. 41].


While Zynex may not be accounting for the policy in its financials, we think it's reducing
its salesforce and adjusting investor communications in response to the change at UHC
and for what we think is a workers' compensation industry stiffening its reimbursement
protocol.


Consider the narrative shift - coming into 2021 Zynex had over 500 sales reps, the story
was aggressive growth into untapped market share and over 600 reps by end of the
year. At Q1, Zynex reduced its salesforce to under 500, but still expected 600 by year-
end. By Q2, rep headcount was reduced to 450 and year-end guidance was lowered to
550 (Sandgaard attributed the reduction to a "competitive job market" and a "focus on
productivity"). By the end of Q3 the salesforce shrank to 430 and Zynex no longer
planned to make any net additions before year-end.


Also noteworthy was the abnormal amount of discussion on the Q3 call devoted to the
so-called Blood Volume Monitor, a product that received FDA clearance in February
2020 yet has generated zero sales. The increased messaging around this failed device
suggests a dim outlook for the TENS market.


UHC's change of policy was overdue. It's surprising that it took so long since UHC acted
against a Zynex competitor for billing in the same manner, although less egregiously.
We became aware of the situation through a lawsuit filed by the competitor.

Tampa-based EMSI, a private TENS manufacturer, is Zynex's largest competitor and the
only other TENS company in UHC's network. In September 2018, after conducting an
audit of EMSI claims, UHC demanded EMSI stop billing for individual pairs of electrodes
and to instead use the bundled supply pack code. In addition, UHC reduced the
allowable quantity of electrodes per patient from 8 pairs to 4 pairs per month (2 supply
packs).


Exhibit 12 - Excerpt of EMSI vs UHC lawsuit


Source: EMSI v. UHC, 2020


In October 2018, only one month after UHC demanded the coding change, EMSI
"succumbed to the pressure" and began billing only two units of the supply pack. EMSI
has billed with this code ever since, according to an EMSI representative we spoke with.


In July 2019, UHC demanded EMSI repay $5m for almost four years of paid claims with
the unbundled electrode code (A4556, the same code Zynex has been using) or UHC
would "offset" future EMSI claims against this amount. Last year EMSI filed a lawsuit
against UHC seeking an injunction to block the $5m repayment demand (the case went
to arbitration).

Source: EMSI v. UHC, 2020


Several elements of the EMSI case are relevant to Zynex shareholders:


UHC has shown a willingness to attempt to recoup payments from a TENS
manufacturer billing improperly


1.


Not only can UHC litigate for immediate repayment, it can also offset future claims
against the amount owed


2.


EMSI was only billing for 8 pairs of electrodes per month per patient. Zynex was until
recently (or may still be) billing for 8x this amount!


3.


If UHC were to conduct a similar audit of Zynex claims, any overpayment demand is
likely a multiple of $5m considering the quantity difference and that Zynex is larger
than EMSI


4.


We don't know why UHC initially only acted against EMSI and not Zynex even though it
was sending patients 8x more electrodes. Even if Zynex and EMSI negotiated different
contracts with UHC, why allow such wasteful supply quantities to persist? It doesn't
make sense. However, after following Zynex since 2019, we've learned that insurers
move slowly, especially large ones like UHC. Whatever the reason, the EMSI case
shows that once it identifies abusive billing, UHC will pursue the culprits and attempt to
recoup overpayments. So, the penalty for Zynex could go beyond reduced future
reimbursements and include liability for past profits.

Technical Pressure: CEO Forced to Sell Shares to Meet Cash flow Needs


The risk of a repayment demand makes the recent announcement of a 10% cash and
stock dividend seem ill-advised. Rather than conserving cash or making the effort to
move past a teetering business reliant on abusive medical billing by investing in new
technology or M&A, Zynex is spending cash on a reckless attempt to "reward
shareholders" - the largest of course being its own CEO.


The fundamental blow couldn't have come at a worse time for Zynex whose CEO is
forced to sell shares to meet his significant personal cash flow needs.


Sandgaard bought the English football club Charlton Athletic in September 2020. To
fund the purchase, he sold 1.25m Zynex shares two months prior. Charlton was nearly
bankrupt or on the edge of "administration" before Sandgaard took over. At the time, the
club required £1m in cash per month to operate and although the financial strain is
currently lower with spectators once again allowed to attend games - operating a lower-
tier team (Charlton is in League One, the third tier of the English Football League) is an

Growth Topped Out, Reimbursement Risk in Focus: 75%+ Downside


This is especially so for Sandgaard who has advertised ambitious goals for Charlton,
hoping to take the club to the Premier League within 5 years. Serious EFL fans scoff
(the British press has referred to Sandgaard as a cross between Bon Jovi and the
fictional character David Brent from the mockumentary The Office), but what's important
is that Sandgaard's dreams will require a lot of money and most of his wealth is tied to
his 43% stake in Zynex.


We've already seen Sandgaard's Charlton endeavors leak into Zynex when he sold
$2.7m worth of shares on August 6 as the league's trade deadline was approaching.
Also remarkable is that Zynex stock was supported by an active share buyback program
at the time. Whether or not these discretionary, open market sales were appropriate is
controversial, but Zynex stock is 20% lower since. Another trade window closes on
January 31 and, if the curiously timed $0.10 dividend or $1.5m he is effectively paying
himself on January 21 is insufficient, we expect Sandgaard to tap his shares again.


Consensus revenue and EBITDA estimates for 2022 are $181m (+38% Y/Y) and $38m
(+65% Y/Y), respectively - the street is modeling growth, yet Zynex has stopped adding
sales reps and likely lost its largest source of revenue. We believe both numbers will be
materially cut next year when Zynex is forced to lower guidance and/or disclose
repayment demands. We think the EBITDA figure could be cut by 40% or more based
our view that UHC accounts for a large part of Zynex's profitability (Exhibit 11). To stem
losses Zynex will be forced to cut staff significantly and reduce non-profitable orders
from Medicare and most commercial health insurers. Private competitor EMSI, roughly
half the size of Zynex in terms of employees and revenue, is a model of where Zynex
potentially goes from here.


Where should a structurally unprofitable, one product, no (meaningful) pipeline, growth
challenged company trade?


Exhibit 15 - Consensus too high in 2022

For illustrative purposes, if we assume UHC accounts for 15% of Zynex revenue, an
80% reduction in UHC reimbursement, and that ex-UHC 2021 revenue of $110m grows
10% next year (fair to optimistic considering the company is no longer making net
additions to its salesforce), a 0.5-1.0x multiple on $126m revenue equates to
~$1.60-$3.30 per share (post stock dividend share count of 38.5m). We think the
multiple range is appropriate considering our stalled growth forecast, remaining
reimbursement risk, and possibility of UHC overpayment clawbacks and accounts
receivable write-downs.

I am disappointed the most recent article by Night Market Research about Zynex does not
have a comment section. The author launched another grenade however Zynex has issued
a press release stating it will not impact their year.

The comments have been silent about the cause of the recent sustained drop.  
Are there additional health care plan changes that are impacting long term sales, or is this a
side effect of Zynex trying to drive sales by hiring massive amounts of sales staff? 
In general marketing is very specific in direct to consumer medical devices (daytime TV
ads), so I get a little confused when "quality" of sales staff is seen as a substantive issue, as
these sales roles are inherently call center level staff. I can see an argument for high quality
sales people when selling directly to hospitals/labs/medical offices, but this would be B2B
health and Zynex is direct B2C sales. 
Also is the dilution of the shares and a special dividen (rather than investment back into the
company for growth) also impacting sentiment?

prescription only products so the quality sales force is important on their work with
hospitals, clinics, etc… they are not call center sales.

This stock was always more about hype than substance... I remember looking at it and
finding it hard to believe it reached the stk price that it did. There are so many other
competitors in the TENS field but evidently as the author found out the company was
somehow able to game the system which my guess was a lot of luck on its part...

I am surprised (or maybe I missed it) that no one commented on the Special Dividend or the
acquisition of Kestrel labs, and I would be interested in the thoughts. 
But either way, the stock is at a 2 year low and it seems the sentiment is down.


Regarding the 10% shares, I do question if adding more shares at this point makes sense
when the price is falling, wouldn't the majority owner rather conduct a share buyback?


Based on the FDA applications, Zynex seems to be looking at diversifying into pulse
oximeters & surgical equipment, given most of this discussion takes place around TENS
units which is their core, does anyone know when the new Zynex products will enter the
market & when they estimate profitability?

@SellsSeaShells management plans to submit the new product for approval in 2023

You are absolutely correct about the buyback. 10% share dividend serves no
purpose and creates no shareholder value. They'd be better off using some of the
$27.5 million they raised in July of 2020 at $22 a share and buy back stock at prices
below $10. A buyback even makes more sense than a cash dividend. The company
should generate in excess of $20 million in FCF over the next 12 months. Hopefully
they get it right.

@Clementine22 Yeah, I don't like the dividend one bit here...especially with the
acquisition. I believe they went the dividend route because the CEO actually wanted
cash to spend, even though a buyback would have been a far better capital
allocation decision. The CEO then should have sold some of his shares, but instead
he got greedy again and didn't want to lower his ownership in the company.


In all seriousness, I believe the CEO treats this company like his own personal piggy
bank, and there is not a thing we can do about it. Over the long-term, it will not only
lower stockholder returns, but the stock will also trade at a lower multiple...and
rightfully so. The company just got a lot riskier now compared to a month ago.

@Skipping rocks Not sure "the company just got a lot riskier now compared to a
month ago" is a fair assessment of risk. Managements inability to declare rolling
buyback program just tells us they are not adept at taking advantage of Mr. Markets
mood swings.


A few comments on risk:


1. Shares currently trade for 13.5x 2022 earnings estimates with EPS/net income
expected to increase ~50%. Shares are sufficiently discounted that half that growth
rate would compensate the typical growth/value investor for the risk of holding. 2.
Time will tell if management made a good acquisition. An acquisition does not
automatically increase a company's risk profile. The acquisition certainly does not
stretch the balance sheet. 3. Management's most recent guide and financial update
act as another morsel disproving this authors 3rd short report in 3 years.


In this instance, share upside is significantly in favor of the long-term investor. Facts
are facts.

Putting aside share price and valuation for a moment.


The author has made similar assertions about the business since October 2019. Since the
end of 2019, management has grown revenue over 2.5 times. Income has grown over 75%
cumulatively. FCF has grown 30% cumulatively. Investor who follow the story know that
income and FCF have not grown in line with revenue due to growing the direct salesforce
from 135 at the end of 2019 to 430 at the end of the most recent quarter. It's hard to be too
disappointed with the growth in the salesforce and their added expense because they are
also the reason revenue increased over 2.5 times since the end of 2019. Recent attrition in
the salesforce is due to firing less productive reps. Perfectly legit for a small company
scaling up.


The business has not fallen apart as the author suggested it would in the past. In fact,
business performance suggests the opposite. It suggests the business has thrived
financially.


Insurance carriers have the ability to contest reimbursement amounts and often negotiate
with Zynex (hence receivables). Management believes this is a "normal business practice"
and states it regularly on earnings and conference calls. Carriers will likely push back more
in the future the bigger Zynex business becomes. Management may elect to accept
negotiated rates in order to receive payment earlier (payment is typically received 9 to 15
months after billed). This is a normal business practice in the insurance space. Changes to
past sku's or billing codes have not changed the trajectory of growth (see above growth).
Further, over the past 4 quarters, management has announced some pretty heft order
growth. (Q32021: 70%, Q2 2021: 247%, Q12021: 140%, Q42020:117%) Revenue from
leasing and selling devices and related supplies from this order growth will be realized over
the next 9 to 15 months. Growth may be slowing but it's off a significantly larger base.


Management has also stated that the average monthly user uses approximately 8 to 10
electrode packs (16 to 20). The adhesive on electrodes eventually wears off. Daily users
may require a greater number of electrode packets. Since there are 30 to 31 days in a

typical month, it's probably not unheard of that a user with chronic pain would use a packet
everyday. That's 60 to 62 electrodes. This individual may be an outlier but is certainly not
outside the realm of possibility.


The supplies are expensive but Zynex leases most of their device revenue. It also costs
significant sums to employ the staff to make sure billing claims are filed correctly. Just ask
the two former players kicked out of the market. (Hint: they cut corners and costs and paid
the price.) (Another bigger hint: This is one of Zynex's competitive advantages. It costs
significant amounts to hire a small army of people to make sure things are done correctly.
As a first mover, Zynex is swallowing up market share.)


Back to price and valuation, shares trade for approximately 13.5x 2022 estimates. Estimates
projecting +65% net income growth seem conservative when compared to order growth
provided above. The company has no debt. Cash will likely exceed +$45 million (15% of the
mkt cap.) at year end. Zynex can easily afford a regular dividend and standing buyback.
None of this suggests the business is about to fall apart or that some significant insurance
claim is pending. Even before the recent correction, the share price appropriately discounted
the risk.


Sort the probabilities yourself. I will agree with the author in one area. The future is not
certain.

If what the author says about United Healthcare is true it’s very bad news for Zyxi.
Btw, I believe each pack of electrodes has 2 pairs. So you think 1000s of people
need 64 pairs (128 individual) electrodes per month? Two pairs per day? These are
crazy numbers.

In case you missed that the first time.


Also, the total bill shows 64 electrodes so …. 64/2=32. That’s 32 packs.

"Unfortunately for Zynex, UHC eventually woke up. In February 2021, UHC announced a
new coverage policy for TENS effective May 2021 which specifies the quantity of supplies
allowed per prescription."


First, great research. However, I do have some questions. Assuming the above statement is
true, why haven't we seen revenue and especially earnings take a large hit? I know they
reduced their sales staff and such, but at this point, even with that change, they are still
really profitable. Sure, let's just say they have to take a writedown on receivables, that is a
one-time expense.


Is this UNH change the only risk? Or are there any other skeletons in the closet when it
comes to other insurance companies? As far as I could tell, it does not look like there is. So
having said all that, and assuming the worst is behind Zynex for reimbursement, the
company is only trading at an EV/EBITDA of about 10. Furthermore, it is still growing quickly
so at this valuation, couldn't one still consider it quite undervalued?

they are still hiring rapidly around the country. Could be getting rid of some to hire
better quality now that more people are back into the workforce. Looks and sounds
like expansion, they do not seem to be slowing development of their Salesforce a bit.

@Gravityon “reduction” means cutting back on hiring … which is not occurring.
Sounded like quality improvements in the works with their sales team. Probably
some poor hires during the pandemic that needed to go. it’s costly to any business
to keep low performers. Seems like right move as more people are job hunting.

What does Night Market Research say about Zynex ramping up hiring for their non-invasive
patient monitoring division? Seems irresponsible to tell people to short a company that is
building something that could be a bigger portion of their business than the pain
management side.

Well after a short thaught i wanna ask the autor few simple questions: 
1. UHC allready had such a case with another company, but decided to pay 3000$ instead
of 45.50. And that is since 2017...?! 
2. Because of all "fraudulent activities" company somehow got from 0.10$ to 30$ and the
owner is so stupid/greedy that he dilecided to sell small part of his shares for all this time? 
3. Lets say owner is stupid/greedy/or has no clue what is going to happen soon, 
How about the rest of the managment? All of them should be selling every share they have
right? 
Well even if you don't like the stock i guess you can sell it, but i really wanna see how your
shorting idea plays out :) Good luck with that.

@apetrou1959 May I ask a very simple question: when you look at that picture of the
CEO and when you read this article (and others bearish on the company, inclusive of
the earnings call reports), is there really, seriously and honestly, any part of you that
does not scream out that "he looks / sounds / acts sketchy?"

@Investing For The Future because he plays the guitar, wants to have an impact on
the opioid crisis, and, who knows why, but saved an English football club from going
into administration? Sounds like a decent bloke when you read what is out there, this
SA snapshot starts to seem pretty bogus and as if there is an agenda behind it.

@ItsAllAboutThatBase Sure - do you by any chance have an explanation for why
Zynex suddenly emerged from obscurity in 2017?


"Supplies Revenue shifted from 32% of total revenues in 2016 to 63% of total
revenues in 2017. Revenues per order suddenly doubled in 2017.


Revenue per order also fell for devices in 2017 yet increased sharply for supplies."


In my humble opinion, there is something very sketchy about latching on to a new
brand and mission only in 2017 while simultaneously seeing a massive shift to
revenues in potentially over-priced 9-volt alkaline batteries and cloth electrode
supplies.


What, did said pain patients suddenly experience a seismic shift in their pain profiles
thus demanding more and more batteries on a daily basis in 2017?

I am feeling even more confident after all that nonsense. Thanks for the TGIF discount on
more shares. Talk to you in a year.

I’m not familiar with you (the author) but I think you make a compelling case. I covered ZYXI
for several years but have not followed it for a long time so can’t offer an investment opinion.
I’d be very interested in talking to you though and would like to chat offline via IM if you have
interest. Thanks (edited)

@Brian Marckx, CFA He really does. Both my wife and I work / have worked in
pharmaceuticals / med device for nearly a decade. We both have networks of ~600
professionals on LinkedIn. Zynex is a terrible long term investment prospect at this
stage.

This could be the dumbest stock to short on the planet. Your followers will slip from 500 to
300 when he blows out numbers in 2022.


I wouldn't want to be behind your thesis and im not long.
