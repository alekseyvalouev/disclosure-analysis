TRUP


FOIA's reveal that the Washington State AG is asking to be kept aware of the
ongoing DOI investigation into TRUP.


I can only interpret this as an additional risk to the company as it brings forward the
threat of prosecution vs augmentation of sales techniques.


In a vacuum this might be easy to shrug off but in the context of a string of data
points suggesting escalating tensions between the company and
regulators/prosecutors it's material.


To begin this article I'd like to present a timeline of a few things we now know about
NASDAQ:TRUP and its multiple state investigations.


April 25th, 2018 - The Louisiana State Department of Insurance cites "Pages and
pages of violations"

The State Attorney General's Office is Tracking The Case?


June 12th, 2018 - State of Washington informs TRUP that it needs to respond to
new allegations (including Veterinarian licensing status) by June 3rd


January 10th, 2019 - TRUP informs the State of California that they have hired a
litigation partner specializing in Multi-State Litigation to handle the ongoing case in
CA


January 17th, 2019 - TRUP informed that the case in Washington has not yet been
assigned to an attorney. The State mentions a co-council being involved, I assume
it is the same litigation partner handling the CA case. (email detailed below)


January 23rd, 2019 - The Washington State Attorney General requests a copy of
the report being generated at the Office of Insurance Commissioner regarding
TRUP. (email detailed below)


February 13th, 2019 - TRUP hosts its 4th quarter earnings call and fails to disclose
or discuss either the CA or WA investigations.


Sometime after October 23rd, 2018 - TRUP alters its FAQ page to reflect the
changing status of the territory partners program

A Second Reference to TRUP Hiring Additional Council


Source: FOIA


It's hard for me to understand why TRUP doesn't think this is important enough to
include additional disclosure in its Form 10k.

The CEO Maintains That There is Nothing to See Here


Source: FOIA


I can only assume "her" is a reference to Kara Baysinger, the attorney who specializes
in Multi-State Litigation and represents the company in front of CA for the case in that
jurisdiction.

The trajectory of the TRUP investigations seems to be widening to additional states and
expanding to at least garner the interest of additional prosecutorial bodies. I remain
confused as to why the company isn't more forthcoming in their 10k about these issues
and, instead, chooses to use the FAQ as a way to offer additional disclosure to
investors. I remain resolute in the conclusion that costs will continue to rise (as shown in
PAC) due to the increased burden of becoming compliant with longstanding state
insurance regulations.
