Will Unilife Run Out Of Cash Before Year End?
Sep. 5, 2014 9:37 AM ET26 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


At June 30, UNIS had only $10.8mm of cash â€“ this, plus blowing the remaining ATM
by dumping stock at $2.13, means UNIS has only $23mm left.


UNIS burned a staggering $28.7mm cash just in the most recent quarter (ended
June 30) alone!


If their PR statement is true that this was $16mm of capex and R&D above normal
quarterly levels they burn $13mm/cash PER QUARTER: 5 months of cash left.


With $55.5mm of debt, a Sept 8th covenant trigger and undisclosed debt covenants,
things could get ugly even sooner than year end.


Questions around the apparent law enforcement investigaiton involving UNIS still
unanswered.


On July 30, Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS) filed a Hype-filled Press Release that included a
heretofore unachieved level of grandiose promotion by embedding a flashy promotional
video rather than including actual financial numbers. The PR highlights the success they
have had at "Accelerating Investment" i.e. cash burn (Unilife Accelerates Investment to
Meet Increasing Demand from New and Existing Customers).


During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, the Company invested approximately
$16 million in capital expenditures and R&D above normal quarterly investments


That investment is now generating revenue at an attractive growth rate. We are
pleased to refine our full year revenue guidance for fiscal year 2014 to the high end
of the $12 million to $15 million range that we had guided previously.


The hype-filled press release, lacking the numbers available to those who actually read
the SEC filings, seems questionable to me considering that almost immediately after,
UNIS unloaded the entire remainder of their stock ATM achieved by dumping shares on
the market (via their broker) at a whopping $2.13/share net proceeds just a few days later.

SEC Filings Reveal Staggering Cash Burn


In fact, taking a look at the SEC filings which included the above press release as well as
required financials revealed that Unilife burned $20mm on an operating basis and an
additional $8.8mm investing in equipment. It is unclear how Unilife came to the "$16mm
above normal R&D and capex levels" for the quarter as the entire R&D line was $6.7mm
so 100% of the capex and R&D = $15.5mm. Is UNIS implying that normal run rate will
include zero R&D and capex? Even given this optimistic assumption, the Company
burned through $13mm of cash in a quarter on a "run rate" basis using this favorable
assumption. Compared to the $10.8mm cash and the $12.4mm from the ATM this is a
mere 5 months left of cash which means UNIS could potentially run out of cash and file
bankruptcy by November or December this year.


New SEC filing raises questions about the Debt: What happens September 8?


According to a subsequent SEC filing on Aug 28th there may be additional debt available
to add to the books to survive liquidity past year end but with a big question raised. This is
on top of the fact that UNIS has still not disclosed its debt covenants to investors - given
UNIS history of overpromise/under-deliver I think this could be because the covenants are
potentially dangerous to UNIS shareholders.

The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary covenants, as well as,
covenants relating to achieving minimum cash revenue targets at the end of each
calendar year, maintaining minimum liquidity targets, the execution of certain
customer and employment agreements in form and substance satisfactory to lender
no later than September 8, 2014.


Question: What happens on September 8th? Is UNIS in compliance even with their
massive cash burn or will we see an expensive credit amendment?


Do Shareholders realize how expensive this debt really is? = 17.5% effective
interest rate


From the same SEC filing Aug 28:


In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Borrower entered into a royalty
agreement (the "Royalty Agreement") with ROS which will entitle ROS to receive
royalty payments. The buy-out amount ranges from $6.5 million, on or prior to the
first anniversary of the agreement and up to $21.0 million, after the fourth
anniversary of the agreement


The Loan will be accreted to the face value over the loan term based on an effective
interest rate of 17.5%.


As a result, on the Closing Date, the Royalty Agreement was determined to have a
fair value of $7.0 million and the Loan was allocated the remaining proceeds of
$33.0 million


Questions Still Remain About Apparent SEC or Law Enforcement Investigation?


Unilife has still not disclosed its debt covenants nor the status of an apparent law
enforcement or (and?) SEC investigation I outlined was seemingly underway in April using
a FOIA request. Shareholders deserve answers, not promotional videos. I reiterate my
price target of $0.

I see the shorters have come out of the woodwork like I said on the previous article by stonestreetadvisors

farmguy2
if you knew anything about the Pharma Industry you would know that the companies signing agreements with Unilife
do far more detailed analysis (than you) in determining the solvency of a company BEFORE they engage in an
agreement...I guess if I were shorting this stock I would put a price target out of $0 too hoping it sticks...Great Article !

Don't expect an unbiased analysis from a biased person. The author is presenting a biased opinion to support his
short position because UNIS has recovered from a sale of stock at $2.13 to around $2.5 depending upon which day
you look at the charts. This is an 15% increase. Can you imagine how you would feel if you were down 15% in a
month? 
Since we do not have details how do we know whether or not the CapEx was financed by the vendor?  
We all know that UNIS has a history of demanding upfront commitment payments so cash may not be a problem.
Unfortunately they do also have a history, proven or alleged, of having a CEO who doesn't always give you the true
scoop, hence the stock is an easy target for manipulation

The company has two supply contracts that will generate peak sales of $240 million per annum in a few years time.
On these two contracts alone the company will have no trouble sourcing further equity (albeit highly dilutive) should
they require it in a worst case scenario.


It was only in March Orbimed agreed to debt fund the company, most likely on the basis of these two locked in supply
agreements. So far the company has met ALL milestones on these two contracts. Hikma filed its first Unifill FDA

submission recently. Hikma made a point to mention Unilife and this achievement in its recent Interim Results
presentation. Additionally, the company shipped its first commercial supply to Hikma in the past couple of weeks. We
will find out next week the company has received the remaining Hikma milestone payments of $10-15 million.


The Sanofi contract appears to be on track. The latest Finesse manufacturing line is currently being qualified, with the
aim of supplying commercial supply next quarter. That will most likely trigger the last $5 million milestone payment
from Sanofi.


As far debt covenants are concerned. The company has always operated with very minimal cash balances from
quarter to quarter. Their current cash balances is nothing new and should be no eye opener for the likes of Orbimed. I
would also suggest the recent acceleration of expenditure was okayed by Orbimed.

Sooker great points.


Milestone targets/payments have yet to be missed! 
And with the milestones being hit every time means that those cash making syringe lines are getting closer to spitting
out revenue making devices that have a sales contracts in place and eagerly awaited by 2 very happy customers.


Thats only from one of the six product platforms, with deals from the other five platforms not too far away i can see
why the shorters are having their last gasp of air!!!


A few events worth watching after the Sept 9 call.....


>European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons Conference, London, UK, Sep 12-16, 2014 
>Partnership Opportunities in Drug Delivery, Boston MA, Oct-14-15, 2004 
>PDA Universe of Prefilled Syringes, Huntington Beach, CA, Oct 6-7, 2014

The 8 September covenant appears to relate to the signing of new customers. It should be noted the company signed
4 new customers/programs since the March Quarter (when the Orbimed deal was struck), none of which have been
publicly disclosed at this time. Two in the March Quarter and two in the June Quarter. At a minimum, two new
customers came on board after the Orbimed deal was struck.


Again. The company is perfectly aware of these covenants (the author is implying it isn't), it signed at least two new
customers since the debt arrangement was executed and it accelerated its investment in building manufacturing
capacity with the complete knowledge of these debt covenants.

Again those sympathetic with the UNIS shorters make alarmist comments. What worries me most is that the longer
UNIS hovers at these low levels the more likely that they could be a successful low-value takeover of UNIS at (say)

$10. Interestingly if there was a takeover at $10 tomorrow then the 19.8m short shares would be out of pocket nearly
$150m to cover!Having been a long-term Unilife investor my target is considerably higher than $10.

I agree there could be a takeover of UNIS but my price target is $0.10 for the takeover. That might be too generous
but I'm willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt since they have always been so successful in the past at
creating shareholder value and meeting their guidance.

If your takeout is 10 cents why don't you short the stock? 
If the company does half of what they have promised the stock will at least double from here. Do you think the people
at Orbimed, who pumped in 60 million of capital into the company are just stupid or easily conned?

Face it, if you own this stock you will be a LOSER.

Pfft, they have contracts with some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world and have innovative
products that I consider to be like apple in the syringe market, just you wait and lose shitloads

@sooker  
That is great they signed two more customer agreements!


I've got UNIS as one of my largest positions. Although i'm just a small time independent investor I think they have
some revolutionary platforms that will all be very big businesses.


I'm also glad to see they made the investments in the last quarter as that's what growing companies are supposed to
do. It shows they are ramping up for some thing big!

Will UNS run out of money before years end?..... anyone shorting the stock would definitely try to scare others into
thinking that could be the case. We are staying long and won`t be scared off. We have quiet confidence that with good
management and patience our lives will be considerably brightened :-) :-)

Author (The Pump Stopper): 
So are we still going to run out of cash?


1. 6/30: 10.8 mm cash balance 
2. Aug: 12.4 mm ATM 
3. 20 mm left on Orbimed deal 
4. 25-30 mm still left in upfront milestone to come in from EXISTING customers, CEO says are "totally reliable on,
baked in" 
5. Revenue from Commercial sales that just started 
6. Upfront cash from any new customers/deals to be signed imminently 
7. Dilution if needed, hopefully not bc CEO seems comfortable with #1-6 but no guarantee..


Let me guess you still say they'll run out of cash..

I am on a crusade to improve the quality of the postings to Seeking Alpha so we don't have to put up with fear
mongering, self-serving and useless information, so I am reposting something I posted on another site: 
I have been following UNIS for some time and have read the articles that have been written on UNIS by both long and
short. By and large the Longs have presented their case objectively based upon numbers and analysis. On the other
hand the shorts or potential shorts have written more on emotions rather than facts. I think seeking alpha publishes
these articles because they know they will get more views and more comments than serious analysis and since they
are paid by their advertisers on page views rather than content, they are happy to oblige. 
Interestingly since the authors are also paid on page views they know that controversy is more likely to generate more
income for them because the longs are more likely to criticize the shoddy analysis, so everybody wins except the
longs and the serious investors who are looking for facts.

The UNIS debate started with Forbes demonizing CEO Alan Shortall based upon unproven allegations but generating
lots of coverage and magazine sales: 
http://onforb.es/1uyC4T3 
and others. Thus tainting the company and pressurizing the stock by keeping future investors away, but for the
allegations UNIS value would be much higher. 
This allows shorts to write negative articles with the hope of picking up the stock at much lower valuations.  
IMHO UNIS would be priced closer to $4++, had it not been for the overhang of allegations


Consequently if you want more, well analyzed articles, I suggest you drop in a comment even if it is to say, "Thanks",
on good articles because as it currently stands only the writer knows how many views he received. Conversely if we
are to get fewer crappy articles maybe the first poster should write a comment stating this is crap and request a good
Contributor to post a comment that he will be responding to the poorly written emotional article by way of a rebuttal
article. This way even though crappy article will get an initial page view they won't be getting the comment views
which add to their revenues by their posting of nonsensical data. 
The end result will be, we will be rewarding good articles and semi ignoring the poorly written ones. Thereby
encouraging the good contributors by rewarding them with the opportunity of receiving the money they rightly
deserve, not only based upon their first analysis but also by way of their rebuttal.


Just my 2 cents. If you agree then perhaps you can hit like so that more of us will know and understand the new
process. This way we can avoid losing valuable time on criticizing and rewarding poorly written analysis 
Note to good Contributors: If you are in agreement and are willing to take on the task of rebuttals, would you please
add your comments. 
Thanks

Today and this week is going to be rough for UNIS and a lot of low margin stocks as investors pull money out to invest
in Alibaba. Essentially investors need to find approx $70 billion of new money and have it in cash to be allocated
shares. The demand for this is very high, indications are it is several times oversubscribed lets say 5X but based on
recent IPOs may be 10X. This means investors have to liquidate 5 to 10 times as much stock to be eligible for shares.
In other words between $350 & $700 billion off sales being converted to stock. Note options expiring this Friday
means the stock may be below $2.5 thru Friday. I bought some more by selling out of the money puts 
Expect NASDAQ shares to be most impact and consider buying a few more shares in the downward draft. This is not
the market correction we have been anticipation for a while

This is not good. The CEO may sell 600,000 shares at a price not to exceed $3.10 per the amended registration
statement, time yet to be determined. Expect more downside

@HOLO 
Thanks for the clarifications. 
If you had read my previous post you wouldn't be jumping to conclusions. I said I bought more today and said not to
worry. I currently have exposure to over 40,000 shares and will buy more if it declines further. I am holding this for the
long term and I suggest you read all the posts before getting personal especially because you don't like a comment.  
Stick to the facts instead of name calling, I expect name calling from weak hands not informed investors
