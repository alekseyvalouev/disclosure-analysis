Oppenheimer’s Second Misleading Report after
Whitewashing UDC at Its Conference


Posted on September 19, 2013 by asensio.com


Oppenheimer has put out another report supporting the views of


Universal Display Corporation (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED)


management – that its patents are not weak and that litigation does


not pose a material and imminent risk to UDC’s contractual


Samsung revenues and its entire patent troll business.** Once


again, Oppenheimer has made blanket assertions without any


reference to independent outside sources and without discussion,


this time after shielding UDC from questions at an Oppenheimer


conference. We think this blatant reliance on the representations of


interested parties instead of disclosing its due diligence and


reasoning is harmful to investors. The fact that Oppenheimer has


suddenly become “more confident” in the strength of UDC’s patents,


apparently only based on a shallow, undisclosed discussion with


UDC, seems like a promotional tactic that can only exacerbate


investors’ misunderstandings of UDC. Oppenheimer has not


addressed the substance of our original report on UDC’s November


hearing, which is our first in a series of criticisms of UDC’s


disclosure policies focused on the weakness of its key patents


versus the “dramatic breakthrough” claims it makes to investors.


The truth is that the proceedings at the European Patent Office


(“EPO”) challenging UDC’s “dramatic” key patents, especially


European Patent No. 1449238 (“EP-238”), pose an imminent and


serious threat to UDC that we believe is already reflected in the


undisclosed terms of the Samsung contract. Oppenheimer does not


acknowledge management’s unwillingness to disclose material


information and is dismissive of the EPO proceedings and the entire


jurisdiction of Europe as not representing “any serious threat.”


Only a challenge “in US federal courts” would pose such a serious


threat, according to Oppenheimer. We explain below the facts that


Manuel Asensio
doesn’t bet
often. But when
he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

make Oppenheimer’s view appear wholly misguided and inexpert.


This is based on publicly available information about procedures at


the EPO compared to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office


(“USPTO”) and our discussion with patent counsel, who has


provided expert guidance on these issues in a peer-reviewed


journal, and who made a filing in the EP-238 case.


The EPO is the most efficient venue to cause complete revocation of


UDC’s “dramatic” key patents. Unlike the EPO, the USPTO does not


have an opposition procedure, where newly granted patents may be


opposed by any party. The EPO opposition procedure allows an


opponent to challenge virtually any aspect of a patent, unlike in the


U.S., where post-grant review of patents is materially narrower. An


EPO opposition proceeding is significantly better for the opposition


in a number of ways. EPO adjudicators are generally more


technically proficient with backgrounds more suited for factual


reviews, according to experts. The U.S. system, by contrast, tends to


be more complicated, more expensive, and less likely to result in


full revocation of a patent. The USPTO procedure is far less fact-


based than the EPO, which allows broader challenges, including to


UDC’s reliance on a simple “one embodiment” experiment.


Oppenheimer’s blanket statement about “US federal courts”


misunderstands the legal and procedural deficiencies of the U.S.


system, especially at the appeal level. The U.S. has no final appeal


process in its patent system and relies on general judges; the EPO’s


Boards of Appeal is final for a market with a population of over 500


million. A revocation of UDC’s patent in Europe first would make


revocation in the U.S. easier.


The EPO is ideal for a serious opponent seeking full revocation of all


UDC’s overlapping “dramatic” key patents claims for another


reason. Since the EPO’s Boards generally have backgrounds that are


better technically matched to the subject matter and the EPO allows


broader fact-based challenges, UDC has been forced to make


dramatic admissions, or confessions, that its opponents can use in


the U.S. and in other actions.


Crucially, an EPO decision to revoke UDC’s patent could allow for a


much easier path to revocation in the U.S. system, with its


complexities and limitations, and in other jurisdictions. The EPO


system presents a far quicker path to absolute finality. Any decision


by the USPTO can be subject to a lengthy appeals process in the


general civil justice system, but if the EPO’s Boards of Appeal revoke


EP-238, the decision will be final for ALL member states. UDC will


not have appeal rights in any of the 38 countries that have signed


the European Patent Convention.


Oppenheimer referred to UDC’s deal with Samsung, by itself, as a


supposed validation of the strength of UDC’s key patents, without

any further explanation. This does not seem to reflect an


understanding of the internal decision-making at Samsung and the


necessity of Samsung to obtain a freedom-to-operate opinion from


patent counsel.


Samsung’s decision-making was undoubtedly guided by a legal


“freedom to operate” and a cost comparison of having to pay-off a


patent troll in an infringement lawsuit with licensing payments that


could be meager relative to the scale of Samsung’s operations. This


decision-making involves an assessment of Samsung’s total leverage


as the only mass manufacture of OLED displays. UDC has redacted


key portions of its August 2011 agreements with Samsung, including


the rights that Samsung has to cancel the agreements in the event


that a key patent is revoked and all other terms that protect


Samsung.


Based upon a comparative analysis of the 2005 and 2011 Samsung


agreements, and the 1998 DARPA public disclosures, which we have


had reviewed by experts, we believe that Samsung’s cancelation


rights, which UDC has petitioned the U.S. Securities & Exchange


Commission (“SEC”) to hide from investors, are concrete and


extensive. Furthermore, we see this as a clear explanation of UDC’s


irregular revenue recognition policy that has been the subject of


inquiries by the SEC. UDC’s explanation of its revenue recognition


to the SEC was even more irregular, referring to “obsolescence” as a


reason why UDC only recognizes license fee revenue only in the


quarters when they are actually paid, which does not appear


consistent with the most basic revenue recognition principles of


U.S. GAAP, if in fact the fees are not contingent.


These matters that are central to valuing UDC shares – the validity


of its patent claims, the science and experimentation behind those


claims, and legal procedures that could result in revocation of a


patent – are very complex. We believe investors deserve a full


airing of these issues, not a whitewash.


** Oppenheimer’s report, dated Sept. 18, 2013, was issued after an


Oppenheimer investor conference where UDC management gave a


presentation. The report states:“We continued our discussion


around the patent portfolio and became more confident in its


strength. For example, we were reminded that prior to signing a


license agreement, Samsung spent considerable time reviewing the


validity of UDC’s patent portfolio. Additionally, UDC’s core patents


haven’t been challenged in US federal courts—we believe this


would be one of the first places we’d see any serious threat to its


portfolio. And finally, after reviewing recent cases, we do not


believe anything new has been recently disclosed to negatively


affect our view.”
