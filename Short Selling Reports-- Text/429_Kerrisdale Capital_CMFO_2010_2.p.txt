CMFO and
Xianghe: A
Dubious
Acquisition
Jun. 4, 2010 8:49 AM ET17 comments | Includes: China Ma…


This article discusses a questionable acquisition that China Marine Food made
in January 2010 that was used to justify a $30mm equity capital raise.


As I wrote in my last post, the financial statements that CMFO files with the
SEC are substantially different from the audited financial statements that it
files with the Chinese government. Whereas companies like YUII, FUQI and
SOLF have matching financials when comparing US and Chinese audited
financial statements, CMFO’s revenue in its Chinese filings for 2008 were 85%
lower than in its SEC filings. Other financial line items were smaller by similar
orders of magnitude.


The company is falsifying one set of financial statements – that’s an obvious
fact. The question facing investors is whether CMFO is falsifying the SAIC
financials that they file to seven branches of their own government, or whether
they’re falsifying the SEC financials that they used to raise $30mm of cash
from U.S. investors in January 2010.


In this article, I explain why an acquisition that the company made in January
2010 provides strong evidence that CMFO is engaged in fraudulent activities.
Specifically, I believe that the company which CMFO acquired is fraudulent
itself. 
 


A Questionable Acquisition


In January, CMFO raised equity capital partly to fund an acquisition of Shishi
Xianghe Food Science and Technology Co., Ltd. (“Xianghe”). Xianghe is a
manufacturer of algae-based soft drinks. The purchase price was $27.8mm.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/74799-cmfo-and-xianghe-a-dubious-acquisition 2/13


Here is the description of Xianghe’s product:


“Xianghe is a Fujian based manufacturer of the branded Hi-Power algae-based
soft drinks. Hi-Power was developed by the Yellow Sea Fisheries Research
Institute Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences in coordination with the
founder, Qiu Shang Jing. Hi-Power is marketed as a high-protein content
drink, low in calories and fat, which provides the consumers a combination of
immune system benefits, improved digestion and reductions in hyperglycemia
and hypertension. Hi-Power’s target market focuses on health conscious
consumers in China’s fast-growing beverage market.”


Here is a link to an informative 8k dated March 16, 2010 about the Xianghe
acquisition. Most of the following discussion is disclosed in this 8K. In this link,
we discuss specifically where in the 8K we get supporting material for the
statements we make below.


From the 8k, we learn that Xianghe’s product actually originated in January
2009, when Qiu Shang Jing paid Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute
(YSFRI) $8,776 for “know-how” regarding the development of an algae-based
drink. To repeat, Xianghe basically began 1.5 years ago, when Mr. Qiu
purchased “know-how” on how to make a certain algae-based drink for eight
thousand seven hundred and seventy six dollars.


In April 2009, Mr. Qiu leased office space from CMFO (CMFO waived the rent
beginning in July) to set up his new algae-drink company. On July 28, 2009,
Mr. Qiu incorporated Xianghe as a legal entity with $43,979 (that’s forty three
thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine dollars). On October 2009, Mr. Qiu
contributed an additional $689,504 for a total registered capital of $733,483.


Xianghe was then purchased by CMFO for $27.8mm in November 2009,
through a 2-step acquisition that was completed in January 2010.


I’ll repeat the key points. Xianghe began when Mr. Qiu bought “know-how”
regarding how to make an algae-based beverage for ~$9k in January 2009.
Over the following 9 months, Mr. Qiu contributed an additional ~$733k (with
90% of that in October, one month before the acquisition).


In November, CMFO purchased 80% of Xianghe for $27.8mm.


Based on my calculations, Mr. Qiu achieved a 139,160% annualized return on
his investment in the algae drink.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/74799-cmfo-and-xianghe-a-dubious-acquisition 3/13


For the avoidance of doubt, here is a graphic representation of what
happened:


 
 
I find it extremely implausible that a company essentially begun in January
2009 and that received less than $750k of capital in its first 11 months of
operation (with 90% of that in the 10th month) would be worth $28mm at the
end of the 11th month, unless it had a truly unique patent or technology.
Xianghe is a maker of an algae-based beverage. I doubt that this qualifies as a
sufficiently unique product that’s worth $28mm purely because of the inherent
attractiveness of the product.


Equally absurd is the fact that the “know-how” which Mr. Qiu purchased for
$9k is now valued on CMFO’s balance sheet at $23.5mm.


Incidentally, Li Xiaochuan is “the researcher” of YSFRI and also an independent
director of CMFO.


More Dubious Financial Statements

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/74799-cmfo-and-xianghe-a-dubious-acquisition 4/13


Xianghe was begun when “know-how” was purchased in January 2009 for $9k.
The company wasn’t actually incorporated until July 28, 2009.


So one would think that Xianghe would have negligible revenue and profit in
its first 5 months of operations, correct?


Not according to Xianghe’s financial statements. Keep in mind that Xianghe
was audited by CMFO’s same poorly qualified auditor: ZYCPA Company Ltd.
ZYCPA, according to its website, has 2 partners and 25 personnel. It received
its PCAOB designation in December 2008.


Between July 28, 2009 and December 31, 2009, Xianghe claims to have
generated $7.6mm in revenue, $3.0mm in gross profit, $1.7mm of net profit
and $1.2mm of cash flow of operations.


With approximately $742k of equity capital (comprised of $9k for know-how in
January 2009, $44k of cash contribution on July 28, 2009 and $689k of cash
contribution on October 8, 2009), Xianghe was somehow able to generate
$7.6mm of revenue and $1.2mm of cash flow from operations in its first 5
months of operations, from selling an algae-based beverage.


Again, I'll demonstrate my points with a graphical representation:

Conclusion


The financial statements for Xianghe provided in the 8K that is “audited” by
ZYCPA appear to be fraudulent. The Xianghe story is implausible, and any
investors who think otherwise simply didn’t take the time to read the March
8K. Xianghe does exist and does make algae-based drinks. But I believe that it
is not worth remotely close to $28mm and it did not generate remotely close
to $7mm of real revenue in its first 5 months of operations. I think that
Xianghe's numbers, like those of CMFO, are fabricated.


The acquisition of Xianghe served as a way for the creators of CMFO to justify
a $30mm equity capital raise in January 2010. I believe that the vast majority
of the $28mm that was used to purchase Xianghe was either redirected to
personal bank accounts or used for some other dubious purpose.

have previously done. Nice to be noticed.


I am only starting to look at this piece of
work thanks to your efforts; but there are
2 items that I would like to bring to your
attention. A capital contribution does not
have to be in cash. The Chinese allow a
company to start with cash infusions as
low as 15% of the Registered Capital. In
other words the Oct 09 Capital
Contribution was most likely ~$100,000
cash and a promise to provide the balance
of the capital within the statutory time
limits. (3 years I think)


The second issue is that the fictional
revenue and earnings have to be spent.
The only assets you can buy with fictional
earnings are equally fictional assets. It is
implausible for a company with $30mm in
cash to float a secondary asking for
expansion money. CMFO most likely did
not actually pay the money discussed.
They made a deal at a far lower price but
are able to show a plausible (barely) use
for the fictional profits. They have also
created an asset on the books and another
opaque (fictional) revenue source.


Keep up the good work.

confirm that they match the 2009 SEC
filings? Or have you abandoned your
previous allegations because the company
rectified the situation? If so, where's the

Yes. But you have absolutely no basis for
smearing the one they have, other than
it's an easy ad hominem attack.

Note that the Ghost had no idea the
Xianghe acquisition even existed when he
wrote his first article, where he wondered
what CMFO had spent its proceeds from a
share offering on. Um, they spent it on this
acquisition. You might want to consider the
Ghost's lack of understanding of this
company, its history or any of its
businesses before swallowing his
"analysis."

Our Ghost short seller wants us to ignore
his total lack of track record (that anyone
could verify) and experience with any
industry, much less CMFO's industry, and
instead focus on "the facts" and "common
sense." So let's use a bit of common
sense: if the acquisition was a scam, why
would the 8K lays out all the detail of the
"scam"? Why not try to hide it? The
common sense conclusion is that while this
is a related party transaction -- which the
8K DOES DISCLOSE -- it is not a
fraudulent one.


What does common sense tell us? That
CMFO committed fraud and detailed it so
completely in public filings that even our

anonymous short-seller -- who didn't even

week ago when he wrote his first article
(now abandoned) -- could piece it
together? Or that this transaction, included
the related-party nature, was so fully

anyone without an agenda and an
increasingly expensive short position.

Author’s reply »  You have every right
to develop your own interpretation of
the Xianghe acquisition. The company
has laid out the facts and chronology of
the acquisition and it's up to investors
to make their own inferences from the
details.


You can draw your conclusion that it
was merely a $28mm acquisition where
CMFO overpaid by $27mm. Or that it's
believable that an algae-drink company
can generate annualized revenue of
$17.7mm based on its first 5 months of
operations, after receiving $53k of
startup capital, and $690k of secondary
capital in its 3rd month of operations.
Or that an "algae-based drink know-
how" that cost $9k to acquire in January
2009 deserves to be valued on CMFO's
books at 23.5mm today.


I instead draw the conclusion that the
Xianghe numbers are fabricated. Given
that the company's accounting firm is
as unreputable as they come, this isn't
hard at all to believe. I believe that
Xianghe merely served as an excuse to
justify a $30mm capital raise that was

I read the 8-K independently and drew
the same conclusion that CCA did. I am
more than certain that either you
haven't read it or you are completely
impotent in reading financial statements

For anyone who has some working
knowledge of accounting, this 8-K just
reads shocking, like watching the

Author’s reply »  Speaking of analysts,
Brean Murray needs to do a better job
differentiating between the frauds and
real companies in the Chinese smallcap
universe. I understand that they want
to generate investment banking
revenue, and that PIPES and secondary
offerings for fraudulent Chinese RTOs
are a terrific and growing area to earn
investment banking fees. But there's a
difference between providing
investment banking services to a
fraudulent company and having buy
recommendations on a fraudulent
company.


Brean Murray, we all make mistakes.
Differentiating between real and
fraudulent Chinese RTO smallcaps is a
very difficult task. I applaud you for
tackling this space and trying to provide
capital to small Chinese companies. And
as you try to help investors cross this
minefield, you're going to occasionally
step on some landmines. CMFO is one
of those landmines. Many investors

overlooked the March 16 8K, which
clearly lays out in stark terms how
fraudulent Xianghe and CMFO actually
are. It's excusable that you also
overlooked the 8K. Research analysts
are overworked and underpaid, and are
subject to pressure from investment
bankers to hype companies that provide
investment banking revenue.


But over the next few weeks, if not
months, increasing scrutiny is going to
be given to the Xianghe acquisition and
the issue of CMFO being a fraudulent
company. This will not be a case of
some anonymous internet analyst
writing two posts, and then all being
forgotten. As the issue gets broader
exposure, you'll be faced with two
choices: either stand by your Buy
recommendation or to suspend
coverage on CMFO.


It's a tough decision. I wish good luck
to the Brean Murray analyst and/or
research committee that decide how to
respond to the allegations. Naturally, I
think that Brean Murray should do the
right thing and suspend coverage. But
I'm short the stock, and so am
obviously biased in my opinion.
