Dose Of Reality: Opko Set For A Pullback As Insider Selling Begins
Feb. 8, 2013 9:40 AM ET58 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Shares of Opko Health (NYSEMKT:OPK) have risen 65% in the past three months as a
string of domestic and international acquisitions, along with a greater collaboration with
Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY), has opened up numerous new pathways for the company.


Opko's prospects as a company continue to be bright; however, at the current price of
around $7.00, the market cap of Opko now exceeds $2 billion.


This is in spite of the fact that Opko has recently disclosed that it does not expect to
become profitable in the near term, which implies that massive revenues (as predicted by
various authors) are not on the near-term horizon.


As shown on the Form 4s, insiders have now begun selling, with Opko's VP of Finance
and Chief Accounting Officer selling $336,000 of stock on February 1st.


Based on the information below, at any prices above $5.50, Opko is a clear sell. Although
at prices of $4.00-$5.00, the stock likely becomes an interesting buy once again.


Even those who are very bullish on Opko's long-term prospects are now leery of the
recent run-up and the lofty share price. Various signals are now emerging that the stock is
headed for a significant correction.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 2/30


The signals include the following:


Insider selling: According to the latest Form 4, on February 1st, Opko's VP of Finance
and Chief Accounting Officer, exercised his options and immediately sold 100% of the
shares underlying at $6.72. Total shares amounted to 50,000, resulting in proceeds of
$336,000.
Heavy share issuance by Opko: Opko has been taking advantage of the run-up in
the share price to issue 20 million shares for its acquisition of Cytochroma at $4.87
and another 25 million shares via a convertible bond at $7.07. These represents
issuance of over 45 million shares all in the month of January alone.
Negligible buying by Frost: Purchases from Dr. Frost have continued, but the vast
majority were in 2012 at prices of $4.00-$5.00. Only 70,000 shares were purchased
above $6.00. Dr. Frost's historical position is greater than 140 million shares.
Huge overhang from potential sellers: The recipients of shares from recent
acquisitions along with the convertible bond shares now create a massive overhang
of more than 50 million shares.


Author Kevin Quon has been bullish on the stock but also noted in his most recent article
that the market cap has become difficult to justify. The Motley Fool notes that Opko has
"received an alarming one-star ranking," meaning that it is expected to be a notable
underperformer. Author Josh Ginsberg continues to be bullish on Opko's business
prospects but notably made no evaluation of the share price following the run-up to $7.00
and $2 billion in market cap.


Clearly these comments do not reflect a lack of opportunities for Opko nor do they reflect
a lack of faith in Dr. Phillip Frost or Opko management. Just about anyone familiar with
Opko or Dr. Frost continues to be bullish on the long-term prospects for the company.


Instead bearish comments are a reflection on Opko's share price, which has simply moved
way too far way too fast and is now due for a meaningful pullback.


Back in November, Jim Cramer noted that the company was a "$4.00 and change" stock
but cautioned viewers


don't jump all over this thing because you will lose money if you chase it up to $5.00
or something silly like that.

That was just 10-12 weeks ago and now the stock is at $7.00. On his most recent show
featuring Opko, Cramer continued to be positive on the company's prospects but stopped
short of calling it a buy.


The reasons for his restraint are twofold.


First, the $2 billion valuation now creates far more chance of near-term downside than
further upside.


Second, according to Dr. Frost, Opko's prospects for drug revenues are looking likely to
be 2014-2015 events as opposed to 2013 events. Clinical trials for the various drugs will
be completed in late 2013 and in 2014, such that commercialization will occur about a
year after that, according to the interview.


While Cramer will be telling investors to not chase the stock up to $5.00, Bill Alpert at
Barron's was telling them to sell outright at $4.00. The scathing article from Barron's
stated that Opko was only worth $1.00-$2.00. Alpert cited medical journals which showed
that Opko's diagnostic tests were failing to detect Alzheimer's and prostate cancer as
planned. Alpert did acknowledge that Opko would likely be presenting investors with other
shots on goal in the future, noting:


With Frost's deep pockets and a dizzyingly diverse project portfolio, Opko will surely
have other stories to tell if these diagnostics don't fly. But prospective investors might
want to wait for the validation that comes with real fundamentals.


There are several misconceptions about Opko which are leading some investors to
continue bidding up the stock even at prices above $6.00.


The misconceptions are as follows:


Many investors are under the impression that Dr. Frost has been purchasing a large
volume of shares at over $6.00 when in fact his purchases have been negligible. The
benefit of these small purchases is more one of signaling to the market which has
caused the share price to continue to rise.
Revenue forecasts from bullish authors seem to have significantly overestimated the
revenue potential for Opko's drugs and its 4KScore product. For example, authors are
consistently predicting that expected revenues from numerous drugs will exceed
those of the best selling drugs of all time for the entire industry. With 4K, authors are
assuming the test will sell for triple the price and immediately capture 50% of the
market.

Many investors are pinning their hopes on a continued short squeeze, but the short
squeeze on Opko is now fading. The number of days to cover the short position has
fallen from 43 days to just 11 days. Short interest itself has fallen by 30%, such that
the covering shorts will no longer be supporting the share price and may now be re-
entering the trade as a new short.


In decades past, Dr. Frost enjoyed spectacular success in selling Key Pharmaceuticals
and Ivax Pharmaceuticals after they matured into substantial revenue generators.


But investors must keep in mind that his involvement with each of these companies lasted
well over 10 years before the companies were in a position to ultimately be sold.


Those who choose to sell Opko on this latest run-up to $7.00 may well have the
opportunity to buy back into the stock at prices back in the $4.00-$5.00 range, at which
time they can still make a longer-term bet if they are speculating on an ultimate sale of the
company by Dr. Frost in the years after revenues begin to materialize.


The Dr. Frost Effect


Many investors seem to believe that the purchases by Dr. Frost are so large that they
have pushed up the share price of Opko and caused a short squeeze. However, this is
demonstrably not the case.


Author Kevin Quon recently noted that:


As of January 11, Frost has effectively taken 135,764,800 shares off of the open
market… For a company that held a 17.7% short position of the outstanding float, or
24.26 million shorted shares as of December 31, such continual buying pressure
by the CEO has put a real pinch on those looking to profit from a decline in the
company's price.


Quon had separately noted that:


Despite having share prices climb nearly 50% in the last 3 months alone, Frost
continues to steadily buy large volumes of shares.


In reality, the volume of shares being purchased by Frost at above $5.00 has actually
been entirely negligible, as shown in the chart below. The data comes from the Form 4
filings to the SEC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 5/30


The chart on the left shows the volume of shares purchased by Dr. Frost at each price
range over the past three months. This is the time period in which the share price has
skyrocketed. As we can see, almost all of Frost's purchases occurred at $4.00-$5.00.
There were some purchases even above $6.00, but the volume on these was tiny.


The chart on the right is a subset of the chart on the left and shows the exact prices and
volumes of each Dr. Frost's individual purchases in 2013. As we can see, there have only
been a few purchases and the largest one in 2013 so far has been only 50,000 shares.


As a result, it is clear that these purchases are not "large" and are not "pushing up the
price" of Opko by themselves. Opko typically trades around 3 million shares per day.


But obviously Frost's purchases do have a different effect that is distinct from the simple
aspect of supply and demand. The real effect here is one of signaling. As Frost
continues to buy, retail investors continue to take notice and jump on board with their own
buying.


Dr. Frost currently owns over 40% of Opko, with outside institutions owning only 16% of
the company. As a result, aside from Dr. Frost, the float is held almost entirely by retail
investors.


Investors who pile in at the $6.00-$7.00 level are missing out on the simple economics of
why this works for Frost in a way that doesn't work for anyone else. This may be one of
the reasons why institutional ownership continues to be quite low.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 6/30


Smaller investors need to realize that the result for Dr. Frost has been an increase in
ownership of only 0.2% during 2013. His position was already so large that the added
shares (even at higher prices) have virtually no impact on his overall cost or on the size of
his position.


Dr. Frost invested a mere 0.2% into new shares at higher prices but the signaling value of
this boosted the value of his existing 140 million shares by 40%. The economics of this
would be nearly identical even if Dr. Frost had purchased the shares at $10.00 or $20.00,
so it can be expected that his small purchases will continue for the foreseeable future.


Obviously, if the rest of us had the same effect from signaling, we would continue buying
small amounts of Opko as well.


If Dr. Frost isn't selling, then why does he care about the stock price ?


The first point that investors need to realize is that although Dr. Frost isn't selling shares,
Opko is selling frequently and in large size. Opko has already issued over 45 million
shares just in the month of January as a result of the Cytochroma acquisition and the
convertible bond.


Dr. Frost is using the greatly appreciated stock of Opko as a currency for going on his
shopping spree for new companies to acquire.


Prior to the recent interview of Dr. Frost on Cramer, the stock had been at $6.00, however
the Cramer effect quickly allowed Opko to issue shares under the convertible at $7.07.


The disadvantage of the convertible is that it requires $5.25 million per year in interest
payment by Opko, totaling $26.25 million in interest for the 5 years in which the bond is
not callable by Opko.


Dr. Frost knows that he will continue making acquisitions and he knows he will be issuing
much more stock to pay for them. But he is uncertain what the price of the stock will be in
coming months, so he was happy to lock in a $26 million interest obligation in exchange
for the certainty of issuing equity at $7.07.


As shown above, Dr. Frost made the vast majority of his purchases at prices below $5.00.
Only a mere 70,000 shares have been purchased at prices over $6.00. But the signaling
effect, along with some help from Cramer, has provided Dr. Frost and Opko with a higher
share price for issuing stock in financings and acquisitions.


Mr. Quon also seems to agree with this conclusion, stating that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 7/30


By propping up the company's share price with his own insider purchases, Frost was
able to wield greater buying power in the latest acquisitions.


What is the right price to sell Opko stock?


Obviously the $7.07 conversion price of the convertible says that selling stock at $7.07 is
an attractive sale price in the eyes of Opko and Dr. Frost. This appears to be true even
though it required paying $26 million in interest.


Just three weeks ago, Opko agreed to acquire Cytochroma for an upfront price of $100
million. As in the past, Opko used its stock as currency with 20.5 million shares issuable in
lieu of the $100 million. This equates to a share price of $4.87. In addition, there may be
an additional payment of up to $190 million, which can also be paid stock if desired.


And now most recently the VP of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer sold 100% of his
recently vested options at a price of $6.70-$6.74.


So for those investors who have ridden the stock up, each of these can be viewed as a
signal from those who know best that the current level is a time to be selling rather than
buying the stock.


What are the recent acquisitions worth?


In December Opko closed its acquisition of Prost-Data Inc. (OURLab) based out of
Nashville. One week later Opko announced that it had acquired Silicon Comércio of Brazil.
Within the span of just one month, Opko was already on its third deal with Canadian
Cytochroma in January.


All three deals do appear to bring significant potential to Opko in the future. But investors
do need to realize that doing three major acquisitions in three different countries in just
four weeks is a huge amount for any one company to chew on when it comes to
integration and implementation.


The current share price seems to reflect a view that completing the three deals on paper is
equivalent to having already made them work for shareholders. Investors will need to be
patient before expecting results from these recent acquisitions, no matter how exciting
they are.


In mustering up their patience, investors need to consider that over the past three years
Opko has now acquired companies in:

Mexico

Canada
Brazil
The United States.


Opko had acquired the rights to rolapitant for anti-nausea and vomiting from Schering
Plough (NYSE:MRK) in 2009.


Despite this blistering pace of acquisitions over a three year period, Opko has only just
broken through the $10 million mark for quarterly revenues in its most recent quarter.


Rolapitant has been in Opko's drug portfolio for nearly four years. So again, if these past
acquisitions are still works in progress, the most recent acquisitions can be expected to
take a few years before they begin to bear the results that investors are currently hoping
for.


At $11 million in Q3, revenue growth continues to be impressive relative to where it was in
the previous quarter. However, investors need to keep in mind that Opko is not growing
these revenues organically, but is instead buying these revenues, using its stock as a
currency.


In addition, many investors seem to forget that while each acquisition brings the potential
for new revenues, it also brings the certainty of immediate new expenses related to the
deal and all of the new employees that come with it.


Opko has made this point clear. In its most recent 10Q released in November, Opko
stated that:


We have a history of operating losses and we do not expect to become profitable
in the near future.


Clearly, if Opko were expecting even a single billion dollar product to hit the market any
time soon, it would be expecting an immediate swing to massive profitability. In its most
recent quarter, Opko's operating expenses totaled only $21 million against revenues of
$11 million. An extra billion dollar in expected revenue would obviously change that
equation.

In the past, Dr. Frost demonstrated his long-term focus and extreme patience. Ivax and
Key Pharma both took more than 10 years before their revenues grew to a point where
they were sellable companies.


Opko currently realizes the time frame which will be required to ramp up revenues as well
as the uncertainty which is always associated with bringing new products through the FDA
and then into the market. Opko also realizes that it will continue to absorb significantly
larger expenses as a result of the acquisitions, even prior to any ultimate revenues which
may be realized.


However, despite this clear communication from Opko, many investors are making their
own forecasts of surging revenues that will seemingly lead to immediate near-term
profitability.


A dose of reality - how many billions in revenue?


Many Opko bulls have predicted that Opko is going to launch a series of new drugs which
will each immediately bring in multi-billion dollar revenues.


Opko does have numerous new and attractive shots on goal. Its drugs will certainly
address very attractive market opportunities. Yet we can see that this extreme level of
optimism is clearly quite overdone when viewed in the context of the best selling drugs of
all time.


Simon King of FirstWord Pharma recently posted a list of the all-time best selling drugs
along with the revenue numbers they achieved in their absolutely best peak years.


In order to qualify as one of the best selling drugs of all time across all years, a drug
needs to be able to generate peak sales of around $5 billion in any single given year.


A list from the Pharmacy Times shows that the cut-off level for the best selling drugs in
2011 was much lower, at $2.7 billion.


In other words, if even one of Opko's new drug candidates sells $1 billion, it would be
going from a base of zero to the pharmaceutical stratosphere immediately.


And in this article, Rich Duprey provides numbers that are far more realistic based on
global revenues realized by competing drugs for Replidea and Alpharen (Cytochroma's
drugs). The reality he shows is that competing drugs from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and

Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) which are already established and successful in the market only
generate revenues of around $300-$600 million. And the other reality is that it will likely
take a number of years to ramp up to that level.


There are two points that the very bullish authors are missing when they provide their
mega billions in revenue forecasts. First, there are established drugs which have been
competing strongly in the market for many years.


Second, not all individuals with these conditions end up taking drugs. Duprey notes that
"surgery is the typical standard of care for secondary hyperparathyroidism."


As a result, when authors simply start multiplying numbers of sufferers by expected drug
prices they come up with spectacular forecasts which end up being far higher than what
we see in the real world.


Launching a drug from zero to $300 million in revenue is obviously a major
accomplishment. However, in making an evaluation of the current share price, investors
need to realize that this level is actually 70-90% lower than what is being predicted by
various authors who have set ultra-high expectations of numerous multi-billion dollar
drugs.


The dramatic rise in the share price and the $2 billion market cap make it clear that many
people are betting that the stock will realize these bullish forecasts even when they are
impossible to reconcile with real world revenue potential.


And also of importance is the fact that these revenues are not expected to ramp up until
2015.


Revenue potential is reflected in the acquisition prices


These lower but more realistic revenue projections should not come as a surprise to
anyone who has followed the terms of Opko's acquisitions.


With Cytochroma, Opko issued $100 million in stock up front and may provide up to $190
million in additional payments subject to certain performance milestones.


Cytochroma has two drugs in late stage trials, Replidea and Alpharen. If it were the
expectation that these drugs would be pulling in several billion dollars in revenues within
the next 2-3 years, then they simply would not have sold for a mere $100 million upfront.
And in fact, there would have been numerous other buyers who would have been happy
to bid far more than the $100 million plus $190 million in milestone payments.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 11/30


The fact is that when an acquirer such as Opko buys a new drug (company), it expects to
obtain its payback over the course of several years and it discounts the price based on the
uncertainty involved in getting the drug successfully approved by the FDA and accepted
by the market.


For Opko, they were willing to pay $100 million upfront, and Cytochroma was willing to
accept. If everything goes perfectly, then Cytochroma founders will get an additional $190
million over coming years, if or when the success happens.


Pulling in several hundred million dollars off a newly purchased drug is no small
accomplishment and it would certainly be yet another coup for Dr. Frost.


But with a valuation of over $2 billion before the drugs are even through their clinical trials,
investors need to ask if the regulatory and commercial success of these drugs is already
being priced in before the events have been proven. The sellers of Cytochroma were
more than willing to put the value at an immediate $100 million.


A balanced look at 4KScore's prospects


The nearest-term revenue development is expected to be the launch of the 4KScore test
for detecting prostate cancer. As a result, it is arguably the most important element for
evaluating the current share price and the results are expected to be positive for Opko.


Opko notes that the 4KScore test as "a next-generation prostate cancer test" which "could
create a diagnostic test able to accurately predict prostate cancer-positive biopsies." In
addition, Opko notes that 750,000 unnecessary prostate biopsies are performed annually
in the US. According to Opko, "A panel combining our PSA test and our novel kallikrein
markers could create a diagnostic test able to accurately predict prostate cancer-positive
biopsies."


However Barron's challenged Opko's prostate test, saying:


A May 2010 Journal of Clinical Oncology report by the test's developers claimed that
their four-marker test would reduce unnecessary biopsies by half. However, an
accompanying editorial in the same issue pointed out that the new screen was less
sensitive than existing tests-failing to detect 14% of high-grade cancers-and was not
likely to change prostate-cancer mortality.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 12/30


The 4KScore test has already been launched in Europe and is expected to be launched in
the US in 2013. Opko's recent acquisition of OURLab provides the company with 18
phlebotomy sites in the US, with a national sales force that calls on urologists.


Ongoing sales of competing PSA tests suggest that the revenue potential for this market
is indeed quite large. However, investors in Opko do need to temper their optimism with
some amount of realism in terms of what to expect and when, in terms of sales of prostate
cancer diagnostic tests.


The sales force will no doubt help the marketing effort for the 4KScore, but it cannot
increase the test's ability to actually detect prostate cancer.


There are two issues that investors should consider when making their revenue forecasts:
competition and emerging medical trends regarding PSA testing. As for competition,
Opko will certainly not be the first company to launch a revolutionary new PSA based test
and then see its stock price soar. As noted in the New York Times quite a few years ago:


The stock price of Biomerica Inc. quadrupled yesterday after the tiny medical
technology company said it would produce a five-minute test for the diagnosis of
prostate cancer... The company said it would first sell the test outside the United
States and would begin sales here if it received clearance from the Food and Drug
Administration… Biomerica's shares soared $7.375, or 311 percent, to close at
$9.75 on volume of 3.6 million shares in Nasdaq trading.


As with Opko, Biomerica's EZ-PSA prostate cancer test was first launched outside of the
US and was subsequently approved in Japan as well. The EZ-PSA test is still
commercially available. However, Biomerica (BMRA.OB) never had blockbuster success
from the test. Biomerica's stock has now traded down to $1.20 and has a market cap of
just $8 million.


Biomerica actually bears some similarities to Opko and describes it business as:


Biomerica, Inc.(Biomerica), develops, manufactures, and markets medical diagnostic
products designed for the early detection and monitoring of chronic diseases and
medical conditions.


The company will do close to $8 million in revenue this year, and with a market cap of just
$8 million and no debt, it actually appears to be a very interesting speculative buy.

Competition has meant that the prices of PSA tests have come down substantially, with
some test centers providing various tests for as low as $49.00.


In assessing revenue prospects for Opko's 4KScore, some bullish authors have assumed
that Opko will immediately capture a 50% market share while simultaneously charging
triple the price for PSA tests. The result was $1.8 billion in annual revenues expected by
a recent author.


Each investor will have his or her own individual method of forecasting, however, using
more realistic assumptions for price (below $100) and market share (15-20%) would yield
a number that is at most $200-300 million. This is still a considerable amount of revenue
to realize from a new product, however investors do need to realize that such estimates
fall around 85% below the $1.8 billion level that many seem to be hoping for.


Author Josh Ginsberg recently estimated that Opko would be realizing as much as $8.3
billion per year based on the 4KScore and Opko's near-term drug prospects. In doing so,
he quoted the $1.8 billion forecast for 4K from another author.


However Mr. Ginsberg does suggest that individual readers conduct their own due
diligence in arriving at such estimates.


Some of the competition may not come from competing PSA tests at all, but instead
will come from competing non-PSA technologies.


According to a 2012 article in MedCity News:


Armune Bioscience Inc. is developing a test based on serum autoantibodies,
which the company says are more stable than antigens and may be easier to detect
during early stage cancer. First, the company is focusing on creating an alternative
to the low-specificity, prostate-specific antigen test that's the current standard for
detecting prostate cancer.


The company has already raised over $3 million from investors to develop the test.


According to a 2012 article in Fierce Biomarkers:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 14/30


Beckman Coulter (NYSE:DHR) has received premarket approval from the FDA for
its biomarker-based Prostate Health Index (PHI). According to the company, this test
is 2.5 times more specific in detecting prostate cancer than PSA (prostate-
specific antigen) tests in men with raised levels of PSA, and could cut the number of
unnecessary prostate biopsies 31%.


In addition, Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) currently offers a urine-based screening test
for prostate cancer.


Medical pushback against prostate cancer testing 
In reality, a much bigger potential impediment to Opko realizing 4K's full revenue potential
could be the increasing amount of backlash that PSA tests are facing from the medical
community. The backlash against PSA testing has been building for two years now and
seems to have escalated substantially in 2012.


These criticisms are coming from many of the most respected names in the medical field
with respect to prostate cancer. Surprisingly, they are calling for a near halt to the
widespread use of PSA tests used as an advanced screener.


The PSA test was actually invented by Dr. Richard Albin. In a New York Times OpEd
piece entitled "The Great Prostate Mistake," Dr. Albin decried the current over-use of
PSA tests as:


"a profit-driven public health disaster."


Later, an article entitled "PSA Screenings: a Money-Making Scam" went even further to
hammer home the same point.


Most recently, the backlash against PSA testing seems to have come to a head in much
broader medical circles. The San Francisco Chronicle noted that:


many possible screening programs turn out not to do any good - and in fact some
tests like PSA cause harm. That's why virtually all expert public health panels do not
recommend the PSA test.


Also in 2012, an article entitled "Harvard expert urges caution for use of new prostate
cancer test" raised similar concerns. Each of these authors raises a wide range of points
which suggest that the problems with PSA testing outweigh the benefits for many of the

men who end up getting the test done. The authors go on to strongly criticize the industry
for over-promoting PSA tests in pursuit of profits.


They suggest that the appropriate target market should consists primarily of men who
have already had prostate surgery, rather than as a predictive measure performed in
advance. Clearly such a shift would result in a very dramatic reduction in the size of the
addressable market.


For now it seems safe to say that PSA tests will continue to be widely used for the
foreseeable future. However, the increasing trend in the medical community to curtail their
use should certainly be considered as a factor by those who are expecting multi-billion
dollar revenues from 4KScore alone and in the very near term.


Such investors should also keep in mind the strong cautionary comments raised by the
medical community specifically with respect to Opko's prostate cancer test, as was
highlighted in Barron's.


Playing the short squeeze


Even when the share price was just over $4.00, the short interest in Opko was enormous.
During 2012, the short interest in the stock typically ranged from 30-32 million shares, so
about 25% of the outstanding share count at the time.


The bet on the short side was premised on the fact that at $4.00, Opko was still a $1.2
billion company with almost no revenues and with losses that were increasing
substantially each quarter.


Much of the recent surge in the share price can be clearly attributed to short sellers
scrambling to cover.


We can see from the Nasdaq that the overall short interest has now fallen by nearly 30%.
Meanwhile, the number of days to cover the short interest has fallen from 43 days in
August to just 11 days at present. The short in Opko was very large, but is now very
moderate.


As a result, short covering cannot be expected to continue to prop up the share price
going forward, and in fact shorts will likely begin re-entering the stock at current levels.

Conclusion - knowing when to take profits and when to re-enter


Shares of Opko have been on a spectacular run and have been boosted by a series of
simultaneous positive factors including:


The positive signaling effect from Dr. Frost's small purchases.
Ample positive attention from Jim Cramer.
A notable short squeeze.
Ongoing enthusiasm from bullish authors with ultra bullish revenue forecasts


However with a market cap of over $2 billion, the stock is clearly one of the most
overvalued names in the healthcare space relative to its actual revenue prospects over
the next 2-3 years.

Comments (58)


The only new near-term revenue event will be the market launch of the 4KScore in the US
in coming months. Realistically revenues from the 4K product may be around 85% lower
than what has been predicted by bullish authors, and will certainly take time to ramp up
even to that reduced level.


Opko itself has cautioned investors that it does not expect to become profitable in the
near term, which basically tells us that any potential billion dollar revenue events are still
expected to occur much further out than many authors are currently forecasting.


The near-term signals of an impending correction in the share price include:


The onset of insider selling of shares by management / insiders.
The signaling effect of over 45 million of new shares being issued by Opko in
January alone.
The overhang from the convertible and from the shares issued to acquisition targets.
A sharp decline in short interest such that the short squeeze will no longer be
supporting the share price.


Any prices over $5.50, Opko isn't just a good short, it is a great short. But once the
share price pulls back to the $4.00-$5.00 range, it likely becomes an interesting buy
and hold stock for some time, depending on how results begin to shape up in 2013-
2014.

I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company

Moreover, Frost bought another 37000 shares yesterday (feb 7) at around 6.90. Added to the $7mm
investment in the convertible bond, his buying pace has INCREASED. As for the assertion that this share
buying increases the value of his holdings disproportionately, that is stupid. Why? Because he cannot
possible sell on the open market. He can sell the company, but if someone (Teva?) is buying the company,
they will be looking at the fundamentals, not at the stock price.

While I appreciate your references, I would like to contest one in particular. You quote me as saying the following, to
which I still heartily agree with:


"Despite having share prices climb nearly 50% in the last 3 months alone, Frost continues to steadily buy large
volumes of shares."


The key word to emphasize was "steadily" as large volumes remains a subjective stance. While I personally consider
30,000-50,000 shares on a near-daily basis to be large, you may not see it to be the case, and that is your right.


However, your following chart below this quote is misleading. The reason the chart on the left is skewed is due to the
market response. Although you track for three months, the rapid climb in share price above $5 occurred after January
2013. Only after this time period did the stock go largely go above $5. Additionally, as I described in my article found
here (http://bit.ly/V3Nj5E), Frost also stopped his buying for an extended period of time around January 15. This was
inherently related to the convertible notes offering that readers were quick to point out.


I would therefore like to reiterate that the key point to take from my particular comment was that Frost continues to
buy with consistent regularity as noted in the 2nd chart on the right.


-------------- 
Having said all this, for the most part I remain hesitant to suggest that it is a good time to buy regardless as I largely
agree with most of your assertions. I am personally in a hold position myself, and look forward to the long-term
potential of the company. This is a nice article from the short point-of-view.

Technically, the offering was still dilutive to him. I'd say he roughly owns 40% of the total diluted share count.
And he only participated in the offering for about 4% of the rough 25 million shares to one day be issued as a
result of it. It's hard to say his participation in the offering was even out of a bullish nature as much as it was
to show face.


As the author correctly references me, I do believe that Frosts objective is to support the share price in order
to leverage better financing opportunities for extended growth. There is nothing wrong with this, and I fully
support Frost's conviction to use his personal wealth in order to create a better business.


I believe I've been quite fair when it comes to this stock. Frost remains the sole motivation I'm even interested
in it. I agree with what the author is saying here for the most part. Frost will continue to buy regardless which
is why I will remain long-term bullish on the company. However, from a technical standpoint, this stock was
well overbought in my opinion.

It is quite apparent you are short -- and it appears given the absurdly long dissertation you are a SCARED short.


For some reason you conveniently forgot to mention that Dr. Frost was prohibited from buying during the recent quiet
period. So 1,000 words of your gibberish painted a negative picture over an extremely positive story.


You say, "...the test will sell for triple the price and immediately capture 50% of the market" Yet, you refuse to state
"triple" from what price. You refuse to state 50% of what market. Citations are also mysteriously missing.


The only thing about your rambling discourse is that you did NOT make your point. Too bad for you that you are paid
by the number of views, and not by the number of words.


You wrote 5,500+ words (yet, somehow missed the truth) versus the Constitution at a measly 4,533 words. I can only
imagine how the Constitution would read if you were the author. America was blessed.


But, congratulations are due to you -- OPK is down 28 cents today.

Congrats for the nice hit piece. Frost and the company's CFO participated very meaningfully in the recent 3%

It would be interesting to learn where the share deliveries of the stock underlying the short sales were coming from as
once Frost buys any stock it becomes subject to a registration agreement and the stock was really not marginable
during the period this article discusses as for the most part the stock was selling under five.


Thus for those two reasons it is quite a stretch that 32 million shares could be delivered on the short side on
settlement day. This is a listed company so there are literally no exclusions on three day delivery.


Contrary to what the article states, Frost was buying a good portion of the trading shares when volume was very
substantially lower as is pointed out. However, his purchases at that time would with short shares at over 30 Million
would have substantially changed the ratio reported and raise it substantially as a percentage. You can't have one fact
without the other.


We would also ask the SEC to look into the fact that one man can be the CEO, The negotiator with Bristol, the judge
and jury on  
acquisitions, a determinator and pre-registration sales of large amounts of debt. Moreover, he is a former regulator,
and an owner and chairman of a large brokerage firm with a large interest in the company's affairs.

He bought the majority of his shares while negotiating the agreement with Bristol, he did not file a K when stating the
fact that the stock was becoming illiquid (relatively) as his stock became locked up, the timing of his announcement
got him the highest price minus a percent or two that the stock ever sold at. And last of all he never announced to
anyone that he among other had been sued by one Daniel Fisher under civil RICO for with a multitude of complaints
name in the suit. It is public information and was filed in California. Most interesting is the fact that insiders certainly
did not buy into what had been done as they had registered options that were easily convertible and saleable. It would
seem that all of the insiders played the game to win, but the this seems to be a case of  
extreme insider activity with part of the Board selling and part buying. There is more to this story than meets the eye.

Provide links to your info please and maybe how long you have been commenting on seeking alpha.
Suggesting criminal allegations or intent without basis is not taken kindly by some.


Dr. Frost has purchased opk shares in the four dollar range in the same amounts he has purchased stock in
the 5 and 6 dollar ranges.


Yes hes purchased larger quantities in the 4 dollar range. The stock sat in the 4 dollar range longer than it has
in the 5 and 6 dollar ranges so his "future acquisitions" would be key. His history to date however has been
consistency. You can't make your assertions re his pattern of trading until enough time has gone by to make
the assertion valid.


Obviously insider trading is not the only metric by which a stock is bought or sold. But it is a damn good one.

Author’s reply »  Those who are focused on Dr. Frost's buying are missing the point entirely.


Dr. Frost's purchases are now so tiny that they do not change his ownership position or his in price in any material
way.


The only value that these purchases have is to send a signal to the market, which you all seem to be picking up on.


I expect Frost's buying to continue. However it doesn't matter whether he buys at $3.00 or $10.00, because the
continued sizes of his buys are now so small that it is not going to affect his economics.


If Dr. Frost were trying to trade the stock with the expectation that it is going to push much higher, he would be buying
in a size that actually matters, not in increments of 20-50k. These increments are entirely immaterial in the context of
his 140m share position.


Thanks for your comments.

Actually this would have been true for quite some time now, so it really doesn't support your thesis. But this is
only a concern for traders. Since so much of OPKO seems to be in strong hands, you might well try an article
like this to scare some shares loose. My position is a ten year gamble based on Frost's record, not a trade.
Everyone should review the history - see http://bit.ly/WNL8Ud. And this even leaves out the ultimate take out

Based on your contention then Dr. Frost would be a fool to buy another share of OPK. Discounting of course,


"Dr. Frost's purchases are now so tiny that they do not change his ownership position or his in price in any
material way."


If you don't consider spending a million dollars since Feb. 1 a material impact on anybody's balance sheet
then I got to say, I really do not need to read anymore.

Dr Frost cannot buy in size?? Do you not know the insider rules. He can only purchase shares as a % of the 3
week active traded float of the stock. Aren't you the same shortseller that said HITK was going down the

Pretty weak piece. Sure OPK is expensive here. Investors are paying for future growth that will come from multiple
products in development. Their analyzer is due to be approved this month or March. 
Shorts have been smoked in the short term and now you (as likely one of them) are hoping to push the stock back
down. Meanwhile, except for a quiet period where Dr F couldn't continue to buy stock, he has been a steady buyer all
the way up. He is again at it. Some CFO sells stock to fund his new home is NOTHING compared to where this is
going .

badsangria
I think you've done a good job of outlining Dr. Frost's past stock purchases. However, unless you are a mind reader,
you don't know what he will do in the future. A few other factors to consider:


1. Dr. Frost has demonstrated an extraordinary personal commitment to the company. This is one of the most positive
things you look for in a company. 
2. His past track record in building companies is beyond reproach. 
3. There is always the possibility that he is preparing the company for a buy-out in the future, which he has done with
great success before.

Logan Adams cashes in 50k shares from options conversions and you make some bogus claim, " Opko set for pull
back as insider selling begins" R U A JOKE. 204 inside buys and 1 50k option sale in a year and you claim " now that
insiders are selling??? AH HUM.


Dr. Frost 2/7 buys 47,500, 2/6 buys 30,000 
1/31 Dr. Frost and Coo Hsiao take options as collateral for 175 million loan, a net of 150 million to opko after interest
payments are set aside.


A 150 million cash infusion from the insiders you claim are selling so MANY shares makes OPKO thoroughly viable
as 4k, and rolipitant come to market in the next few weeks, or months in the case of the Tesaro product. Desperate

Nice one day gain for you, hey. Let us all know when you close the short. One insider sell does not necessarily
indicate the "beginning" of insider selling. Time will tell.


BTW, you hurt your cred quoting Cramer.

The author is claiming that 30K shares is not significant. But Frost has been (and continues) to by around ONE
MILLION shares a month, which is over 0.5% of the float. Show me another public company where the management
buys that much, and I will by as much of it as I can get my hands on.

Please consult with a urologist or oncologist regarding PSA testing. PSA monitoring is very important . Majority of
people who treat such diseases wholeheartedly disagree USPTF suggestions (given that most are not even experts in
the field or are in the medical field). Since PSA has come around since the 1980's the rate of death has declined in
the population. Having said that, although I am long, the valuation is a little high.

InsiderS selling? One insider sold. "Many investors" - you mean the handful on the yahoo board? Good grief. Though
I agree it needed a pull-back to consolidate, your generalizations are poor journalism/research to say the least

Well Dr. Frost bought on 1 Feb 40 000 shares at $6.46, on 6 Feb 30 000 shares at $6.90 and today (8 Feb) 37 500
shares at $6.85. So it is quite early to say that Dr. Frost stopped buying. In the last 3 days he bought 67 500 shares!! I
would say he resumed the buys after 2 weeks pause. 
Regarding the VP of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer that sold 50 000 shares at $6.72, it is important to
remember that he exercised the option on the same day at $0.56. A $300 000 profit is always nice to make.

It is also important to remember that it is not the first time he did it. He did it now (5 Feb) but had already done on 17
Jun 2011 ($3.40), 12 Sep 2008 ($1.63), 10 Sep 2008 ($1.86) and 5 Sep 2008 ($2.00). 
So the fact that he sold it does not mean anything. 
The important fact from this article is that you are short.

08 Feb 2013, 05:48 PM


Ascendant1
Why is it that the author of this article would categorize an option exercise and sale of 50,000 shares as significant
from an officer who owns no common stock whatsoever and in the same breath call Dr. Frost buying over $1.9 million
in stock since January 1 insignificant? He has not bought that much above $6 a share because it has not been above
$6 that long!!! If you add the time frame plus what he did in the recent offering he is actually stepping up the pace in
terms of dollars.


Second, regarding the short position, you might want to point out that since December, the only reason the days to
cover has dropped so significantly is because the volume nearly doubled from 1.26 million a day on December 31 to
2.17 million a day on January 15. In that time period the shorts covered about 300,000 shares and the stock went up
12%. If you back out Frost, insiders, and restricted stock this float is not that big and smaller every day thanks to Frost
so the short situation still looms large. The average days will go lower still on the next report as the share volume
continues to increase but as a percentage of the float the picture is still dicey for the shorts.


Lastly, anyone who invests in biotech or devices knows that within two years is very near term to revenue. Dr. Frost
has done a tremendous job of using stock to make acquisitions and is keenly aware of the buying power so he has a
great deal of interest in the price for that reason. He is building a powerhouse here, people said the same thing about
Celgene being overvalued a few years back and now look at it.


You may be right in the end as this type of company can lead to big rewards or big loses but go easy on the obvious.


Good luck to the longs like me!


08 Feb 2013, 06:01 PM


dublzoute
maybe rather than worrying about whether he can influence the stock price, dr. frost simply wants to buy low and sell
higher as the value is realized. by now any selling of shares by dr frost would crush the price and he would be left
holding the bag. your article makes no logical sense.

Talking as someone who has no interest in whether the stock goes up or down, I find the piece to be very
logical. Good luck with your position. You're taking all the risk if the company fails, whereas the convertible
bondholders get a guaranteed 3% if the drugs fail, and if the company does well, they can buy in at close to
the same price the stock is at now. If Frost likes the company so much, why didn't he just do a secondary
offering at the current market price and buy the shares himself instead of doing this convertible debt deal?
Seems loopy to me.


09 Feb 2013, 09:01 AM


donzoab
What kind of shill for this writer are you? Your posts are illogical. The company refuted the entire piece in one
easy press release. Dr F again buying in the market at market prices. Seems the short sellers are prepared
for battle. Good lluck, you are going to lose your shirt on this one.


11 Feb 2013, 12:56 PM

If you read the 3% debt deal Dr. Frost created the deal and he and Jane his COO bought the notes. The
terms of the note are such that no shares may ever hit the market. He apparently did not want to dilute the
shares. He and Jane are taking all the risk to the DIRECT benefit of current share holders. He did every
LONG a big favor basically giving the company enough cash to last four years at current cash burn rate with
NO DILUTION. Likely the cash is to launch the 4k score test which is due to roll out shortly. This article is
trash and no more than attempt to make money by the author at the expense of longs. The only reason one
could find the article logical is if they had not spent sufficient time studying the company.

What you say is true, that this type of company is a risky investment, and only slightly less so for bond holders IMO.
But that is not the thesis of the article. Maybe you should re-read it.


To address only one point in this shotgun approach - if Frost's purchases are designed to keep the value of the stock
at a given level in order to fund acquisitions, so what?. The acquisitions do have value, so even if the stock price were
inflated the "underpayment" for the assets would theoretically zero out the difference.


Logic is a blunt instrument, and can be wielded by those who may be less than candid about the motives behind their
statements. My position in this stock is admittedly highly speculative. So is a short position, but maintaining it is
expensive, whereas my horizon makes this short term move irrelevant. This article was prepared in advance for
release when a trigger like a single insider sale occurred (unless you think it was a coincidence, or the author is a very
fast worker). Does that fact not suggest anything to you? You may find this piece of work admirable, but that has little
to do with any grasp of reality.


09 Feb 2013, 11:25 AM


Adam Gefvert, CFA, Contributor
I think if I was an insider I'd rush to sell at this price. Compare this stock to ITMN. ITMN recently did a share
offering at $9.90 per share, and sold convertible bonds that yield 2.5% and can be exercised at around
$12.35 per share. The stock now trades at $9.75. If there was a billionaire scooping up shares, it would
probably trade much higher.


Now OPK. The convertible bondholders get 3% interest, and can convert their bonds for stock at $7.07 per
share. Right now, the stock trades at $6.50. The bondholders have almost no risk at all. There is $150M of
outstanding convertible bonds. Right now, the market cap of OPK is $1.9B. Now lets say that a bad scenario
happens and OPK's recent acquisitions of those drug companies fail, and the stock trades for $0.65 per share
in five years. That's still a $200M market cap for the company. The bondholders can just sell off the
companies remaining assets, or do a share offering to get paid back. While many retail investors will have
stock that they spent over $6 per share for.


Now, the flipside. Lets say the drugs are very successful, and OPK goes up to $10 per share. The convertible
bondholders can just get stock at $7.07 per share, only about 10% more than the current price. And before
this article came out, the shares were trading for above that price. The only reason why, is because Dr. Frost
is buying shares in the open market, and that creates a buying frenzy in the stock by misinformed retail
investors.

So, how many shares were you short today?

akarc
He states he has no position in the opk. However w/ statements like 
"I think if I was an insider I'd rush to sell at this price ", he may wish to take a short position. His articles would indicate
he has no problem with shorting stocks.


I made a small addition to my small position close to it's low Fri. as i said I would above (just for disclosure purposes).
As of fri's close I am happy w/ that action.


I noted seeking alpha gave this post an "editors pick" rating. I don't know what criteria seeking alpha editors use or
why they designate any post an "editors pick". I do know that I have found some totally bogus info on this site re
individual stocks. And to be fair have found some good info to follow up on.


Years ago after some very disappointing results using a full service broker I adopted a policy of never relying on the
advice of any one person on any one site as the reality is, "everyone talks their book!"


I have also learned that there are some people in this world way smarter than myself. Dr. Frost is one of them.
Although one suspiciously early comment in this thread questioned the integrity of Dr. Frost, (which was totally bogus,
legally questionable, unsupported, and probably cemented my decision to make another small purchase) his history,
by "my own" reading, is commendable.


On the flip side I can not stand looking at or listening to Mark Zuckerberg or Facebook. But recently took a very small
position there. Can't ignore their potential in mobile.


Friday was an emotional knee jerk reaction to the sale of one insider and I agree w/ the commenter above that this
article was probably pre written and ready to go for just such a circumstance. Besides fundamentals and technicals
there is a psychology that should be considered. But then hey everyone does what there gonna do, good reason or
not.


Full disclosure: I have no control over congress, the banks, the fed, stock market, Europe or the rest of the world.

Opk is up today. It would appear that a number of comments posted on fri are not showing today (as of yesterday).
Unless it is a fault of my computer or I am missing a "see all comments" option somewhere I' curious as to why many
posts refuting the article are not showing.


On my computer the comments stop at a suspiciously bogus negative comment by Big. And that concerns me. As this
was a Seeking Alpha "editors pic" I would think all comments would relevant.


Then again I can not discount a prob on my end. So I have reported to situation to Seeking alpha for clarification.

Its a long and well thought out article and you bring out some very good points. It is now July 10th and Mr. Frost had
bought 193,601 shares above the $7 price.


Personally, I believe Mr. Frost is going to do what it takes to make OPKO very profitable and he has shown he can do
it.


I will stick the Dr. I believe the guy is a genious and will make the bulls very happy.
