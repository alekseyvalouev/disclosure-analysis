StoneMor: With Dividend At Risk, Shares Could Fall Sharply
Aug. 12, 2013 9:30 AM ET110 comments
by: Richard Pearson


In July 2012, the Whiting USA Trust (NYSE:WHX) was trading at $18.00 and had just paid
one of its highest ever dividends. Whiting had long been subject to heavy criticism due to
the unsustainable nature of its dividends, which were based on finite oil and gas reserves.
Each time a negative article surfaced, the retail investor base shrugged it off or refuted the
concerns of the critics. It was notable that institutions and insiders refused to own Whiting.
It was almost entirely held by mom and pop retail investors for its dividend yield of at least
10%.


On July 17th, 2012, Seeking Alpha author Shane Blackmon published an article entitled:
You'll Lose 50% Of Your Money If You Hold This Trust For The Next 3 Years."


In fact, it did not take 3 years for the stock to fall 50%. By the end of that very day, the
shares closed down by 50%.


The majority of investors had already been made aware that the dividend at Whiting was
fundamentally unsustainable in various ARTICLES and comments. However, each person
was individually certain that they could keep collecting the dividend for the short term, and
then exit before the price imploded.

On July 17th, 2012, they found out the hard way that it is impossible to time the implosion
of an unsustainable dividend scheme.


Shares of Whiting never recovered, and are now down by more than 70% from their pre-
article price. Whiting now trades for below $5.00.


StoneMor Partners (NYSE:STON) is in a different business than Whiting, but in many
respects the problems are identical to those of Whiting.


The stock is often not particularly liquid, however there are very cheap call and put options
listed at very frequent strike prices.


Investors should be particularly concerned that institutions and insiders absolutely refuse
to own StoneMor, just as they did with Whiting.


Investors should also be concerned about the steady stream of warnings that StoneMor's
dividend is an unsustainable "Ponzi dividend."


Ultimately we will see that current investors in StoneMor are set to lose around 30-50%
relative to the current price. The only catalyst that is necessary is when others decide to
sell. This could happen either before the dividend is cut or after.


The reason for this is that the dividend is in no way sustainable. As with Whiting, some
investors are already aware of this, but choose to keep collecting the dividend in hopes
they can get out before the big drop in the share price.


With Whiting, there was no fundamental change or announcement that led to the 50%
drop. Instead it was just that on that day investors chose to stop bearing the risk of the
dividend cut and get out. Ultimately the dividend was cut well after the drop in the price of
Whiting.


On the surface, StoneMor has all the hallmarks of an ideal retirement portfolio dividend
stock. Revenues are stable. The industry is set for continued growth due to the aging of
the US population. Gross margins are stable, even though the company does continue to
lose money every quarter at the bottom line.


But the biggest attraction of StoneMor is clearly its large and stable dividend of 8-10%. It
is the dividend that has made StoneMor a darling among retail investors. Hunger for this
dividend has pushed the shares up to over $26, its highest level since 2011. Many retail
investors now seem to regard it as almost a fixed income investment due to these
characteristics.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 3/34


But that is where the good news ends.


The problem with StoneMor is that the "principal" here is far from protected and the yield
is far from guaranteed. Despite the low volatility in recent months, regarding this equity as
a fixed income security is a dangerous mistake.


Even a cursory analysis reveals significant problems at StoneMor, which indicate that this
dividend (and thus the equity price) should be at significant risk. Because the valuation of
StoneMor's equity is entirely dependent upon the dividend, any reduction in that dividend
will quickly send the stock down by 30-50%.


We can see that StoneMor has been panned by insiders, institutions, equity analysts and
debt analysts. This leaves just passive retail owning more than 90% of the stock.


Now that StoneMor has gone ex-dividend (August 1st), the best move for holders of
StoneMor is to take the dividend and run, selling the units.


There has been an abundance of ARTICLES, which continue to praise StoneMor as an
attractive dividend investment. These articles are typically very brief and perform no
analysis other than citing the cosmetically attractive dividend along with the attractive
fundamentals of the industry. These articles do nothing to assess whether or not
StoneMor can actually keep paying this dividend. They also do nothing to explain why this
stock continues to have a dividend yield that is several hundred percent above its peers.


This was also the case with Whiting before its collapse. Brief articles noted a high
dividend, but failed to test whether or not the dividend could be sustained.


There are numerous red flags, which show that the dividend and the unit price are at
significant risk with StoneMor. Many of these red flags should be too obvious to ignore.


Each of these red flags is a separate way of noting that the market is telling us it expects a
dividend cut. These are the clues from which we can predict the 30-50% downside move.


Red Flag #1: Institutions refuse to own StoneMor


Retail is not the only one who loves dividends. Institutions are big fans of stable dividends
as well. Yet total institutional ownership stands at just 9%.


As with Whiting, the institutions are well aware of the unsustainable nature of the dividend
at StoneMor. They are also aware that purchasing StoneMor simply for the dividend is a
devil's bargain. As soon as the dividend level is reduced (or as soon as confidence fades

in advance), the equity price will fall by far more than the amount of any hoped for
dividends.


Red Flag #2: Company insiders refuse to own StoneMor


If the industry is growing and the company is thriving, one would presume that insiders
would be eager to lock in an 8-10% dividend as well. Yet the combined total of insider
ownership between a dozen different individuals stands at just 3%.


As with institutions, the insiders are well aware that the 8-10% dividend policy is
unsustainable. As with Whiting, insider ownership is negligible.


Red Flag #3: Rating agencies have ranked StoneMor as a junk credit


StoneMor equity is not a fixed income security. Neither the dividend payments nor the
principal amount invested come with any guarantee. But by looking at the actual debt of
StoneMor (which does come with a guaranteed payment of principal and interest), we can
see just how risky the equity proposition is.


Despite the stable industry characteristics and the consistent revenues, both Moody's and
S&P rate StoneMor as a junk credit. The current rating of B- is just one notch above being
a near uninvestable CCC credit.


S&P had noted an expected recovery value rating of 4, indicating that in an event of
default only 30-50% of principal would be recovered.


Both rating agencies express concern that StoneMor is so highly leveraged.


Reasons for rating StoneMor so poorly are explicitly due to the fact that during its entire
life StoneMor has never generated enough cash flow to pay its dividend. StoneMor is
either borrowing new money or issuing equity to pay these dividends.


The agencies describe this as "negative discretionary cash flow."


This is the definition of "Ponzi finance." StoneMor is paying an attractive current return to
entice current investors. But the only source of this return comes from the new investment
by future investors. Without a constant supply of new investors, StoneMor has no possible
way of paying this dividend.


This is a practice, which everyone should recognize as dangerous and unsustainable. It
always comes to an end. And when it ends, it always ends badly.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 5/34


S&P previously noted this concern explicitly when putting a junk rating on StoneMor by
saying, "Our ratings primarily reflect our opinion that StoneMor's business model, growth
strategies, and ownership structure will result in negative discretionary cash flow that will
require ongoing external funding." S&P added, "In our view, the company's financial risk
profile is 'highly leveraged' (as defined in our criteria), primarily reflecting slim operating
cash flow."


But in expressing their opinions, Moody's and S&P are talking about the risks to debt
holders, not to equity holders. The risk to the equity holders is clearly far greater than that
of the debt holders, particularly the risk of near-term price declines.


Red Flag #4: Clear financial warnings from equity analysts


Surveys such as Value Line and Morningstar continue to highlight warnings on StoneMor.


Value Line continues to rank StoneMor at near its lowest ratings for financial strength,
safety and timeliness.


Morningstar continues to rank StoneMor as a "D" for Growth and as an "F" for profitability.


Yet despite these unpromising financial conditions, StoneMor continues to pay out a huge
and unsustainable dividend which it finances using new investors.


Red Flag #5: An uninterrupted history of losses


Over the past 5 years, StoneMor has posted roughly 5% annual growth in revenues. But
this has largely been the result of increasing acquisitions. These acquisitions and the
accompanying revenue growth have not translated into any profitability whatsoever. Over
the past 4 years, annual losses have ranged from $6-14 million.


This is clearly why Morningstar ranks StoneMor an "F' for profitability.


The cumulative loss so far in 2013 is now over $13 million for the first 6 months.


StoneMor bulls attribute these losses to the nuances of death care accounting, by which
revenues are not fully recognized until the services are used (i.e. the customer is buried).


But we have now had 9 years since the IPO in 2004 for any of this revenue recognition
delay to start catching up. Instead, despite new acquisitions (including in 2012 and 2013),
the losses have continued.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 6/34


Pre-tax losses in 2012 did narrow to $4.8 million from $13.7 million in the previous year.
However that trend looks to be short lived. The pre-tax loss in 1Q2013 has already come
in at over $3 million for the single quarter. One time items in 2Q 2013 resulted in a loss of
$11 million for the quarter.


This means that in the first 6 months of 2013, StoneMor has already lost more than
it did for full year 2012.


Red Flag #6: StoneMor is close to breaching debt covenants


As of the latest 10-Q from just a few days ago, there is a new risk of breaching covenants
on StoneMor's debt.


StoneMor's debt covenants require that it not exceed a maximum consolidated leverage
ratio of 4.0. As of Q2 that level hit 3.97, so it will take almost nothing further to violate this
covenant.


StoneMor is also required to maintain a minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio
of 2.50. The current ratio is 3.22, such that if there is just a 1% decline in EBITDA,
StoneMor will be in violation of its covenants.


Breaching debt covenants will further restrict StoneMor's ability to pay the dividend.


From latest 10-Q:


We have two primary debt covenants that are dependent upon our financial results,
the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated debt service coverage ratio.
The consolidated leverage ratio relates to the ratio of Consolidated Funded
Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.97 at
June 30, 2013 compared to a maximum allowed ratio of 4.00. The consolidated debt
service coverage ratio relates to the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated
Debt Service. Our consolidated debt service coverage ratio was 3.22 at June 30,
2013 compared to a minimum allowed ratio of 2.50.


Valuation implications


By looking at comparable death care companies, we can see that StoneMor is drastically
overvalued relative to any fundamentals. The sole reason for this overvaluation is hunger
for the (unsustainable) dividend by retail investors. Were it not for the dividend, StoneMor
would quite obviously be trading at roughly half of the current price.

StoneMor has three publicly traded comparable companies, Service Corporation
International (NYSE:SCI), Stewart Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:STEI), and Carriage
Services, Inc. (NYSE:CSV). Due to Service Corporation's pending acquisition of Stewart
Enterprises, it's best to compare StoneMor to only Service Corporation and Carriage
Services.


STON SCI CSV


Market Cap. 559.9 Million 4.0 Billion 322.3 Million


P/Sales 2.3 1.63 1.55


TTM P/E N/A 25.8 27.7


EV/EBITDA 25.2 9.3 11.7


Net Debt/EBITDA 7.4 2.8 5.3


Credit rating B- BB BB


Dividend Yield 9.2% 1.5% 0.7%


Profitability: StoneMor is the only one of these peers that loses money, the other two are
actually profitable companies.


Debt (leverage): StoneMor is also far more leveraged than its peers, with a very high
Debt/EBITDA ratio of 7.4. This is the leverage concern that was expressed by the rating
agencies.


Credit rating: StoneMor is rated 4 notches below its peers by the rating agencies - just
one notch above a CCC credit. It two comparables are both rated BB, just 2 notches
below investment grade.


Valuation: Despite these drawbacks, StoneMor trades at a substantial price premium to
its peers. StoneMor's Price/Sales ratio is roughly 50% higher than its peers. EV/EBITDA is
more than double its peers.

It is quite obvious that the only reason for this drastic valuation discrepancy is the massive
difference in dividend yields. While the comps pay out 0.7-1.5% annual dividend yields,
StoneMor pays a stunning yield of over 9%.


This is also how we can come to the conclusion that any meaningful cut in the dividend is
likely to see the price of StoneMor fall by at least 30-50%.


A closer look at the unsustainable dividend


As shown in the charts below, StoneMor's dividend has been climbing steadily, even
though it has not generated enough cash to pay these dividends in any of the past 4
years. In any given year the shortfall ranges from $14-40 million.


So far in 2013, StoneMor has again paid out nearly $25 million in dividends, despite
bringing in only $16 million in OCF.


As a result, in each year, StoneMor has tapped the debt and equity markets. In effect, this
means that StoneMor is simply raising money from new investors in order to pay off the
existing investors.

So far in 2013, StoneMor has again already raised around $20 million from new investors,
net of its debt repurchase. It has also made use of its credit facility with its banks.


The problem is that the base of investors who need to receive a return keeps growing
larger and larger.


Meanwhile, we can see that despite stable revenues, StoneMor continues to be
unprofitable every quarter.

Distributions approaching a breaking point


Schemes such as this are always unsustainable. When they suddenly end, it comes
without warning.


As the investor base continues to grow, the financing need grows exponentially larger as
does the need for finding an ever-growing supply of new investors.


StoneMor has been tapping both equity and debt investors in order to continue funding
this above market 8-10% dividend.


Part of the problem lies in the fact that insiders and institutions refuse to own StoneMor. In
most cases, retail investors either cannot or will not perform the analysis necessary to
properly evaluate the security. Instead they just keep cashing their dividend checks and
hoping for the best.


In its recent earnings announcement, StoneMor illustrates why retail investors have been
overly confident in receiving their dividend even as institutions steer clear.


The earnings release states that distributable free cash flow (non-GAAP) for the three-
month period ended June 30, 2013 increased to $24.9 million from $13.3 million for the
same period last year, an 86.8% increase.


Hopefully more astute investors will realize that the term "distributable free cash flow" is a
fabricated non-GAAP measure and specifically does not refer to operating cash flow. It is
effectively a made up metric.

5/22/2018 StoneMor: With Dividend At Risk, Shares Could Fall Sharply - StoneMor Partners L.P. (NYSE:STON) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 11/34


For example, the release noted that "distributable free cash flow" in 2Q2012 had been
$13.3 million. In reality, OCF that quarter was only $6 million. Against that $6 million in
OCF, StoneMor had paid out $12 million in dividends that quarter. As usual, it financed this
by issuing debt.


Had StoneMor actually generated that $13.3 million in cash, there would be little to be
concerned about when paying a $12 million dividend for the quarter. But instead, we can
see clearly that this metric is meaningless as StoneMor still needed to borrow to pay the
dividend for which it lacked cash. In reality, StoneMor paid out a dividend, which was
double what it actually generated in OCF.


It is important to note that this arbitrary non-GAAP "distributable free cash flow" number
does not even approximate real cash flow. According to the company, the components of
this number include GAAP cash flow, plus additions for the Merchandise Trust. But as
disclosed in the most recent 10-Q:


The merchandise trusts are variable interest entities (VIE) for which the Company is
the primary beneficiary. The assets held in the merchandise trusts are required to
be used to purchase the merchandise to which they relate. If the value of these
assets falls below the cost of purchasing such merchandise, the Company may be
required to fund this shortfall.


Adding in the value of the Merchandise Trust into this new "distributable free cash flow"
metric renders it basically meaningless.


It is notable that StoneMor's treatment of this "distributable free cash flow" has already
been evaluated by the SEC and this view has been rejected. Yet StoneMor continues to
disclose this manufactured and arbitrary metric as a way of suggesting that the dividend is
in some way sustainable.


The $24.9 million in "distributable free cash flow" for 2Q2013 is a very inspiring number on
the surface. But it is misleading in two respects. First, it includes a one time cash benefit
of a lawsuit win by StoneMor.


But more importantly, it uses the same flawed methodology to suggest that StoneMor is
actually generating cash that it is not.


In reality, StoneMor paid out the largest dividend in its history at nearly $13 million during
Q2. Meanwhile, actual operating cash flow stood at just $9 million. So once again,
StoneMor paid out around 150% of its OCF as a dividend.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 12/34


But the impression given by the recent press release is that StoneMor only paid out $13
million while generating $24.9 million. This is simply not the case.


Meanwhile, the share count has now ballooned to over 21 million, up by more than 50% in
4 years. Total debt now stands at $230 million. Interest paid during the first 10 months is
already at $10 million.


As the investor base has expanded, each of the new investors becomes "entitled" to the
ever expanding payment obligations.


Conclusion


StoneMor continues to be unprofitable and generate insufficient cash flow to pay its
dividend. StoneMor continues to tap the debt and equity markets for ever larger sums in
order to continue paying an above market dividend. As a result, its share count and debt
obligations have continued to expand over the years.


StoneMor's continued publication of the "distributable free cash flow" has confused some
retail investors into believing that the company does have adequate cash flow to pay its
huge 9% dividend. However the SEC has already disallowed that methodology for
computing cash flow.


Paying out an enormous 9% dividend has now become quite obviously unsustainable. As
the investor base continues to expand, the payment obligations expand exponentially
creating the need to continually raise ever larger amounts of new money from more and
more investors. StoneMor has now disclosed that it is now dangerously close to breaching
debt covenants (within 1%).


As with the Whiting Trust, StoneMor is likely to fall by 30-50% as soon as investors decide
to exit.


As with Whiting, the catalyst for this move is not dependent upon StoneMor cutting the
dividend in advance.


Now that the stock has gone ex-dividend and earnings have been announced, there is
simply no reason to continue holding the stock. The best move is to exit and eliminate the
30-50% downside risk before other sellers act first.

It has been more than a year since the last silly article like this. Same tired old arguments without understanding of
the merchandise trust. Only thing new here is the attempt to compare STON to WHX - what dishonesty. WHX is a
trust that has in its charter that it will end in 2015. I have been short WHX for several years - I am not short STON.

Thanks for the history lesson. Certainly, the article was oozing "I hope this happens with my article"...

While I am neither long nor short STON I don't see how you can compare it with a royalty trust. Whiting possesses a
dwindling resource and has a finite life.


STON is an LP and does not share the characteristics of a royalty trust.


12 Aug 2013, 09:48 AM


yoyoma1
Yes totally different business models, but WHX and STON do share one characteristic; they both have a
dividend that is unsustainable.


With WHX the realization that the dividend would eventually be cut caused the price drop. 
With STON a large price drop could actually cause the dividend cut since STON relies on the issuance of new
equity (and debt) to fund the dividend.


But the author's point is the price drop can (and probably will) precede the cut.

Waiting for a dividend cut is like waiting for Godot. I've read versions of this same story for a decade now.

I'll surmise that it's because each of those articles crated a dip in the stock price that allowed the shorts to

And they wonder why regular people don't trust the stock market...

@giorgiolb, Yes this is an old story, but you have not provided any argument against the assertion that STON

@DividendInvestorLA Yes the bashers are trying to make profits shorting this stock, but you have not
provided any argument against the assertion that STON is a Ponzi scheme. I agree with you that manipulative
articles are more reason to not trust the stock market.

yoyo,


I don't need to provide any arguments. I'm not the one making assertions to scare out weak-handed retail

The term Ponzi Scheme has a very specific definition. If the shorts have some inside knowledge of same,
perhaps they should inform the SEC.

Yes I agree. The whole market seems to be working that way these days. Print a scary semi-GROUNDLESS

And then read that insiders own 3% of the 21.3M shares or 639,000 shares. Would I like it to be higher...yes....but you

Not so.

I do have to say this is probably a great short. I put it on the shelf about 3-4 months ago, bc we're in a bull market. But
this is one stock to stay away from.


Having done work on STON, it's amazing what some companies are able to get away with.


Happy trading, nice article.

The Merchandise Trust holds $414.38 million as of June 30, 2013, while the corresponding Merchandise iability is
$127.88 million. 
There also are $544.32 million in deferred cemetery revenues on the balance sheet.  
These sums have been growing and will be realized as merchandise and services are delivered.  
Furthermore, the company discloses why they disclose both GAAP and non-GAAP figures because non-GAAP
numbers provide a more accurate view of their business and cash flow. See page 34 of the 10Q.

If it goes down then it will a good buy. I made already several profitable trades with this stock. It fluctuates nicely,
thanks to the people who write articles to get the stockprice down, and also the dividend is huge. So buy low and sell
high.

I find that to begin with the comparison of this company to a royalty trust to be so patently dishonest, in my opinion it
renders the entire article as nothing but a cheap short-sellers hit piece. The repeated mantra that the dividend is
unsustainable is all too similar to the tactics of politicians who believe if they repeat something often enough, it will
make it true. Meantime, the company continues to not only pay the dividend but increase it, while the banks continue
to finance the acquisitions.


12 Aug 2013, 11:41 AM


Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Whether it is MLP, royalty trust, common stock etc is all the same. The fat is that they cannot pay the
dividend without getting money from new investors each time.


Everyone knows that this cannot be sustained, it is just that no one knows when the party will end.


There is simply no reason to bear that risk for 3 months until the next hoped for dividend.

Like with Mr Harper, you should be given the benefit of the doubt that you are just honestly mistaken and
need to study a little more the dynamic of the deferred revenues and merchandise trust. However, the
response above, so deflecting and irrelevant, is giving me pause about that.

Cheerful Reaper
I'm a recent investor in Stonemor (~4 months), and I'm certainly not an expert, but I think you missed some
important points in your analysis.


For starters, this is not a stock, but a limited partnership unit. As such, it has interesting tax reporting
treatment. As a unit holder, I would much prefer the company keep reporting losses, since I don't have to pay
tax on "return of capital" and I can deduct business losses from my income.


The cash flow is generated not by new investors, but by sales. The "new investors" are, in most cases,
acquisitions purchased with company "stock" (l.p. units).


Basically, what you interpret as business losses is the accounting treatment management utilizes to maximize
free cash flow and not burden the unitholders with reportable profits. If this were a corporate entity, I'm pretty
sure they'd do it differently.


The credit rating is also damaged, most likely, by being a limited partnership and not a corporation. The
General Partners have a lot more latitude in allocation of cash flow than a corporate Board would, and I can't
imagine banks liking that.


There are certainly risks here, but I'm not sure you've either correctly identified nor quantified them.

No - not angry Brian. Just amused. The angry folks are generally those that just bought in because of the
dividend and haven't experienced this before. Most of the folks commenting here have seen this silliness
happen a few times. You haven't been heard from for awhile on STON - I wrongly concluded you capitulated
on this because of the failure of your predictions (over and over again) to do anything more than have the
short term crater that you profit on.


You have been writing articles like this on STON for several years now and I . I generally have given you the
benefit of the doubt about your integrity. Persisting in this without ever really addressing the surplus in the
merchadise trust and the deferred revenue is slowly leading me to the conclusion that I have been wrong
about your integrity.


12 Aug 2013, 02:40 PM


Brian Harper, CFA, Contributor
I'm short 1 share as a token...covered the rest because the cost to borrow (the shares, not for the company),
as I referred to above, is astronomical (25% annually recently, including dividend)...so it's not worth it. I
completely stand by my original comments, everything I've stated I still 100% agree with. The company has
started buying in Florida recently because the state has lax trusting laws...mgmt noted the latter on the recent
conference call. So STON can do pre-installs, plunder the cash, and keep paying the quarterly upkeep.  
Also, those who point to the merchandise trusts as a huge plus are completely mistaken. These are akin to
insurance contracts. Do you think the hundreds of billions of securities on AIGs balance sheet is AIGs money,
free and clear? No, they simply derive benefit from the return on the investments. These merch trusts are for
future services which have not yet been delivered...and many of these contracts are simply front loading
revenue. Anyone notice that STONs cemetery revs were actually down in the last quarter, despite acquisitions
and despite the co's "aggressive" sales of pre-need?  
So many red flags...


12 Aug 2013, 05:59 PM


bbmaven
I appreciate your reply Brian and am back to trusting your sincerity. I am sure that makes your day:)


Seriously though, it seems to me then that you are doubting the accuracy of the latest 10Q which indicates
that the merchandise trust holds over $400 million as of the end of June with the related liability for
merchandise to be delivered of about $125 million. The surplus has been consistently growing for some time. 
Are you just categorizing the entire $400M as covering liabilities dollar for dollar?


Of course, neither AIG or STON are free to do whatever they want with their pools of money. However, AIG
must keep a conservative loss reserve to cover far more unpredictable costs. STON's obligations and the
amount they must keep in reserve are far more predictable.


I don't think there is any evidence that will satisfy those who are disbelieving of STON's accounting until they
stop growing and begin to harvest. Then, the GAAP and non-GAAP numbers will begin to converge - and
then we might hear about how much more conservative STON has become in their accounting. It won't be
true - but so what? I am not particularly invested in being right.

By the way, I had been long STON for several years, but back in the winter, sold my shares and have been
selling lucrative puts since then. I have found I collect the "dividend" up front and the volatility premiums are
really quite juicy. I hadn't re-upped since July expiration - I was very excited to wake up this morning to find
this article from whoever this new guy is and had a good time selling puts this morning. You, Value and this
guy certainly contribute to the continued volatility on this little cemetery company and I appreciate that.

Brian Harper, CFA, Contributor
It's not like STON will simply pocket $400 million upon all these contracts maturing. There are merchandise
costs, variable costs associated with installing the crypt, performing admin services, performing the funeral
services, and residual commissions. And huge upkeep costs with all their cemetery. The co has a very
disingenuous slide on their presentation which makes one think that their margins on pre-need are 80% or
more. In reality all they are doing are locking up a future burial. Even if STON's margins suddenly jumped to
the level of SCI, a bigger and in my opinion much more operationally sound company, they'd have $38 mil in
op income against $20 mil in annual interest expense, resulting in in PT income of about 85 cents a share.
Even if all their pre-need matured over the next 20 years and did draw an 80% margin, you'd be at $1.62/shr
in PT income...not enough to cover the dividend, under very rosy assumptions. And not enough to pay off the
debt. 
Sell your puts if you want...they reflect the high cost for shorts to borrow the stock....just bear in mind you may
be picking up quarters in front of a bulldozer.


13 Aug 2013, 10:01 AM

Thanks for your advice and well wishes.


As long as the inflows into the trust are greater than the outflows, it represents growth in revenue and
profitability. That growth will not be reflected in the GAAP numbers. I choose to believe that the liablities
attendant to those inflows is close to what STON is representing in their SEC documents. When the inflows
and outflows start converging, the GAAP and non-GAAP numbers will begin to converge also and then your
analysis will make some sense. Until then, ANY use of the GAAP numbers will just serve to create FUD and
articles like this will show up on a regular basis.


Since I have delved deeply into these numbers in the 10Q and have chosen to believe them, I am going to
stay long. What I learned after crunching and backtesting last winter is that selling the puts is more lucrative
than stock ownership and has exactly the same risk. Furthermore, since it is taking place in a tax deferred
account, I don't need to worry about the impact of UBTI on the tax status of the MLP units. The risk I am
undertaking by collecting those premiums is exactly the same as ownership of the shares - the return is just
significantly greater because, as you say, of the high cost for shorts to borrow the shares. And what causes
that high cost to borrow the shares? All of the FUD surrounding this weird little funeral/cemetery company.

This story created a momentary panic regarding the stock, and STON dropped well over $3.00 at one point. As I type
this, STON has recovered somewhat to a drop of $2.13 and it continues to bounce back. (I hope you had sufficient
time you needed to cover your short, which is no doubt why you wrote the article). While STON is by no means run in
the most efficient manner (see TD Ameritrade's neutral take on this), it has had up quarters and down quarters.
Institutional ownership is minimal, but so is short interest. CSV, by comparison has 10x the institutional ownership, but
also nearly double the short interest. It's interesting to note that as STON is dropping today, CSV is rising. Looks like
people are switching death industry stocks. CSV is not much of a dividend payer, unless you call a rate of .56% a
dividend. It's hard to believe that 1 solitary person can move a market, but it happened here. My personal take on
STON is that it's definitely not as well run as some other companies, but I wouldn't say it's at death's door (pardon the
pun) either.

I agree with the comment that this is all about an after dividend short play on STON based on its non standard MLP
based accounting model. To increase future dividends an MLP like STON has to grow which it has been doing
aggressively. Even though they are making highly accretive buys, because of the accounting rules in this business the
full benefits take years longer to show up on the books. I am surprised that the author did not mention the real
potential threat to STON which is congress changing the MLP rules. On the other hand since they are close to their
ratios they may have to slow down the rate of growth. This would be bad for both the shorts and the long term
investors as the quarterly numbers would quickly improve. As a long term investor, I hope they can continue the
current growth strategy.

STON is an egregiously obvious short-play to anyone with a rudimentary background in financial
analysis/understanding of free cash flow generation. The company's merchandising trust liability doesn't matter, it's all
restricted cash anyway, can't be paid out...the fact that current revenue generation doesn't match current cash flow
generation is critical to building a company's capital structure and dividend policy, and in this case STON's
management team (or bankers) miss the mark in a frightening manner. Reliance on perpetual access to the equity
capital markets not to finance growth, but to finance PAY-OUTS, is obscene and any retail investor involved in this
stock is being played a fool by bankers and a management team that appears craftier than they. In the interest of
looking out for retail investors, please don't buy into this dividend story.


I am long STON puts.

And there we have the usual new IDs posting supporting comments, usual in a short manipulation...


How sad and trite.


Yet, it works so why shouldn't they?


12 Aug 2013, 02:11 PM

I'm absolutely dumbfounded by how investors in this company are unable to realize that the only way the
company can finance its dividend is by issuing new equity.


Bernie Madoff ran a similar business model, in fact it worked for a number of years. He provided returns to
investors by raising new capital. As long as he could raise new capital, he could provide returns! No one
really complained until he couldn't raise new capital...


14 Aug 2013, 11:41 AM


Giorgio il Buffone
But Bernie Madoff didn't invest in any assets. He didn't even invest in a burial plot.


14 Aug 2013, 02:28 PM


DividendInvestorLA
Shame on you for accusing honest people of being crooks.


That is one of the most disgusting post I have ever read (along with a similar post of a similar short attacks on
STB) - when all else fails, attack the integrity of honest managers.


So disgusting words fail me.

5/22/2018 StoneMor: With Dividend At Risk, Shares Could Fall Sharply - StoneMor Partners L.P. (NYSE:STON) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 25/34


SJF2005
Mr. Pearson,


As you I'm sure well know, GAAP accounting-based analysis, the basis of both your and Moodys/S&Ps pro-forma
credit ratings, is irrelevant when analyzing StonMor Partner LP's specific business model. Thus, your and their points
about profitability, operating cash flow, and financial leverage (debt/EBITDA), and Valueline and Morningstar' rankings
for STON are all moot, not to mention highly misleading to unsophisticated retail investors.


A simple back of the envelope calculation reveals that STON has $500.675 million in identifiable, liquidate-able assets
net of depreciation and assuming a 50% haircut versus $273.22 in total debt outstanding. And this DOES NOT
include a massively-overfunded Merchandise Trust. So, a basic "recovery rate" test with punitive assumptions reveals
that if the company were to cease operations tomorrow and enter bankruptcy, bondholders would be 100% covered
and then some based on what would realistically be realized in a bankruptcy proceeding. Not to mention, do you
really pay attention to the ratings agencies anyway or seriously think other investors should?


Like all partnerships, STON funds accretive acquisitions through a combination of debt and equity issuance and credit
facilities. Not a smoking gun.


STON is a growing niche operator in a consolidating market and pays a sustainable, high distribution, so why on earth
should it trade at a similar EV/EBITDA or net debt/EBITDA multiple to your two comparison stocks whose business
models are different and whose payouts are paltry? (Especially given that your EBITDA calculation is pro-forma; on
an accrual basis it'd be neutral to your thesis.)


There is nothing wrong with making a profit on an intelligent short bet scrupulously argued, but have you no
conscience about doing so on a thesis of superficial plausibility all while hoodwinking the average investor?


Your assertions are just that. Your article is classic stock manipulation. You should be ashamed.

without knowing his true motivations.

STON has $14 Mil in cash and is paying out $12 mil in dividends a quarter. What could go wrong? That and the fact
the assets minus liabilities (Partners capital) is $139 million and the market cap was over $533, the author might be
on to something


12 Aug 2013, 01:55 PM


abbythecat
You completely left out the merchandise trust and the cemetary trust assets.


But, of course, YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS.


You deliberately write this article of half-truths hoping (and sadly succeeding) to bring the stock price down to benefit

STON has had an uninterrupted string of distribution increases from May 2005 to the present. During this period, the
quarterly distribution has gone from $.463 to it's present level of $.60.


IMO, it is unfortunate that with a growing history of this type of article that SA does not do basic fact-checking of all
articles premised on shorting stocks.


In recent months the number of new authors (including a large number of college and high schoolers) has exploded
on SA. Not a good sign for SA's future credibility.


12 Aug 2013, 02:53 PM


dorbeckistane
Why should hedge fund managers like Jacobsen and Ackman get to make money on scary stories and not
high schoolers? Instead of getting pissed, look at this as a chance to get some shares cheap.


I have no position in STON.


12 Aug 2013, 04:51 PM


DividendInvestorLA
I agree. Each of those articles does chip away at SA's credibility.


To be honest, I often find more interesting elements in the discussions here than in the articles themselves.


12 Aug 2013, 07:40 PM

Was going to say that: I often read the title, first few paragraphs, and skip directly to the discussions. Much

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1628252-stonemor-with-dividend-at-risk-shares-could-fall-sharply 28/34


nuljava75
i have no position here. the problem with this article is that specifically the title connotates/gave me the impression
that something tangible has happened.


i scan thousands of stocks per day. when this popped up on my radar, i immediatley went to financial news headlines
app and i came across this; "STONMOR: With Dividend At Risk......." at a glance, i thought the company had made an
actual announcement or guidance had been provided with respect to future divi amounts.


instead it is someone with an opinion who is sharing ideas and posting rhetoric that is 7+ years old as far as i can
recall. the company just retired all of their high yielding junk bond debt and issued a brand new float with a 7.8%
interest rate. if things were as bad as everyone claimed, no way they get that debt deal done in the single digits.


12 Aug 2013, 03:04 PM


SJF2005
Not to mention (regarding that junk bond debt), few people know that Stonemor was the ONLY company that
was a new issuer to have successfully tapped the debt markets in calendar year 2009. No other new debt
issuer was able to issue debt during the financial crisis. Regardless of what the ratings agencies say, this fact
alone speaks volumes.


12 Aug 2013, 03:40 PM


DividendInvestorLA
I do take SA titles with a huge grain of salt now, but with hindsight, I agree with you. Someone not wise to the
occasional misleading headline on SA would conclude "Oh my God Stonmore just said the dividend was up
for grabs!)"


It is not the most ethical thing in the world to do IMO.


Sadly, since there is no downside to publishing such an article they will continue unabated.


12 Aug 2013, 07:38 PM

SA titles are indeed created to attract eyeballs, not only here, but also when the links are reposted on Yahoo
finance and elsewhere.


13 Aug 2013, 02:27 PM

Dividendinvestor,


Yup, I have the same complaints about such sensationalism.


14 Aug 2013, 02:29 PM


MLP Trader, Contributor
"There has been an abundance of articles, which continue to praise StoneMor as an attractive dividend investment. "


Wow. You didn't even bother to read the existing articles. Of the 18 that appear when you click the link, 8 are
absolutely negative on STON and generally recommend selling it short. How about:


"The Impending Implosion Of StoneMor Partners" 
"Stonemor Inflated On Dividend Enthusiasm" 
"4 Reasons To Avoid StoneMor" 
"Stonemor Dividend Unsustainable"


Another 5 articles are lukewarm or suggest that STON may be worth further investigation. One talks about the bonds
and not the stock. So that only leaves a few that are genuinely bullish. The reality is bashing STON is a popular sport
on this site. You are joining a large crowd of shorts who know little about the company or its business.


As far as I know, I'm the only SA writer who has actually had a conversation with management and asked them about
the more controversial issues. (Actually there was one who talked to them on the phone, but my understanding is that
was not a conversation but rather a series of barely veiled threats against them.)

Actually, re-reading the headline, I have to say that it is quite misleading. It makes it sound like the company has
declared the dividend in jeopardy, when it's really not the case.

As a new dividend growth stock oriented investor, I initially invested in STON because of all the favorable SA articles
and the high dividend yield. However, I eventually realized that I was unable to understand its business model
sufficiently to maintain my faith for keeping it in my portfolio. So I sold my position in June 2013.


13 Aug 2013, 07:19 AM

I completely agree with your assessment of the STON situation. I would add two things.

2. In my experience, which goes back some years, any stock that returns a 10% dividend, automatically
carries risk, otherwise buyers would bid the price up and reduce the yield. This isn't your grandmothers
retirement stock.


I have no idea who is correct in their analysis, but something is happening, hence the "lively" discussion.


I would also conclude that investors can get very emotionally attached to their holdings, and writers can be
very off base.


I will seek other investments.


23 Oct 2013, 05:34 PM


DividendInvestorLA
I do think generally that you are echoing an "anti-dividend" prejudice that is present in parts of the investing
community.


Everything is risky and is a high-dividend stock like HCLP, which I bought when its dividend was over 10%
and rallied higher and faster than my wildest dreams, really any more "dangerous" than "staid" GE with its
management that oversaw a huge drop in the stock price and a big loss of capital on their media
investments?


Personally I don't think so.


Every company has to be looked at for what it is and does.


26 Oct 2013, 01:36 AM


Akaralph, Contributor
The author got what he wanted, and those of you looking for a bargain in STON also received a good price.


In the future you should avoid any of his articles. I have no idea if his misinformation is legally actionable - but I'm sure
his actions will catch up to him someday soon.


13 Aug 2013, 01:24 PM


bbmaven
There is no legal prohibition to being short and writing an article which points out the flaws that the author perceives in
the company. That is true even if he is 100% wrong - and that is as it should be. This is no different than being long a
stock and writing about why you are enthusiastic about the company.


There is a line that can't be crossed however - and that is if you short the stock and then engage in a campaign of
deceit and lies to profit from the market action. However, I don't believe that is what Mssrs Harper, Value and Pearson
are doing. I believe they are mistaken, stuck in their GAAP analysis and not expending a great deal of effort to really
understand the accounting. STON is an easy target to garner attention because its accounting IS confusing and takes
quite a bit of time and digging to understand.

Proving they are knowingly spreading FUD is a huge burden and their defense would easily carry the day - they don't
have the burden of proving their case - just that they made an honest mistake.


13 Aug 2013, 01:39 PM


DividendInvestorLA
That is the problem of cases where you have to prove intent. That's why all the prosecutions you see are
often supported by evidence showing the ill-intent as without it you can't prove what was in people's head.


The fact that the perpetrators of a fraud will likely go free doesn't make it right, however, and doesn't speak
well of our system of justice either.

It happens more often than you think for such thinly traded stocks. Check out other SA articles by the shorts
and you'll see STON's trading volume went up 4-10 times immediately thereafter on no news.


14 Aug 2013, 02:32 PM


DividendInvestorLA
The reason is that the misleading headline is picked up by news feeds like Google and Yahoo and seen, as if
it were real news by millions of people.


It IS very sad, however, that so many people know so little about proper investing that they sell reflexively
without taking the time to find out that there was zero real news.


14 Aug 2013, 04:43 PM

As a follow up to my post above. If someone can move the number that easily, it is not someplace you want to

Thinly traded, and subject to big swings on SA articles equates to roulette.

Gio,


You are correct. However, some have inherently more risk than others. Thinly traded, big dividend (and
controversial) are red flags.


With that yield and the whole fixed income world begging for yield and yet staying away, are REALLY BIG red
flags. You really think the retail investors in this stock are smarter than the those with in depth research teams
and billions in capital to put to work? I suggest anyone mull this one over.


I have no skin in this game, but their are certainly better opportunities. What I have concluded in reading
comments here is that there a lot of very emotionally invested holders, that is never good.

Thinly-traded, lightly followed small caps are always more at risk than universally-owned megacaps. It goes
with the territory.


Those who believe that retail investors can't compete with "in depth research teams and billions in capital",
however, should probably stick with index funds.

The GP gets paid on cash distributions, so the GP's primary interest is to increase cash distributions, not
conservatively manage the business.


I am long STON but the article was a useful public service. It is a warning to the bankers not to allow STON to get
overleveraged.


13 Aug 2013, 09:32 PM


linkdonald
Good article. STON is risky, no doubt about it. I used to own it and sold when the risk level did not decline as business
increased. It is an LP so some rules are different. They engage in aggressive but legal accounting practices and an
examination of the balance sheet with close attention to assets shows a company that THEORETICALY could be a
potential winner with good management and a few breaks. Needless to say a distribution (dividend) cut of about 50%
would also be in order. In short, it is what it is and , contrary to what is implied in this article, all the relevant
information appears to be up front and in the open.


13 Aug 2013, 09:44 PM


DividendInvestorLA
Since you seem to think a high dividend is detrimental to growth, this is certainly not the stock for you. I
advise you to avoid STB and SDRL too, even though those are two of my very favorite companies (SDRL
having run up quite a bit lately so this may not be the right moment to initiate a position if you're "all-in-all-out"
kind of investor.)
