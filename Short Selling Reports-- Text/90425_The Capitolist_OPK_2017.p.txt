Opko Health (OPK) has a preposterous valuation of nearly $4 Billion dollars with
virtually no assets or cash to show for it.


The most Bullish Investment Bank has very close ties to the founder (He is
chairman of both institutions).


The Company bought the worst performing clinical lab that existed on the public
exchange.


They are unable to gain an LCD from Novitas (a Medicare Administrative
Contractor with jurisdiction in NJ where the BioReference facilities exist) for the
new "4k" test.


Rayaldee is simply a high priced nutraceutical with multiple Prior Authorizations
(PA) required, and the HGH product is likely going to receive a refuse to file letter.

In the spirit of full disclosure we have been short Opko Health (OPK)on and off from the
day they closed the BioReference (BRLI) transaction so we are playing with house
money at this point. The BRLI transaction was telling because it was a tremendous
display of incompetence by management. In the case of unprofitable corporations we
place a very high premium on the judgment of management and their historical
successes/failures. In this case the leadership is either past their prime or extraordinarily
low quality - because of the risk associated with management and the decisions they
have made we continue to see significant downside volatility available in the name -
thus the position remains.


With roughly $0.14/share of cash on the balance sheet the closing price of $7.00
yesterday offers very little margin for error. This is exasperated by the fact that
Diagnostic revenue is essentially flat and the company generated a ~$34m loss as
defined by Cash Flow From Operations in the first quarter. A federal investigation - and
the potential fines associated with False Claims Act Violations - could call into question
the company's ability to continue to operate.


In the end - we see this company as having downside to the very low single digits
(Between $1 and $2 seems like a reasonable value for the Lab business) as none
of the catalysts are likely to turn out favorably for the company. A dilutive equity raise or
convertible debt offering is an additional catalyst to the downside that seems likely given
the company's cash burn. In this article we will principally focus on the lab business as it
was supposed to provide CF to fund trials and has turned out to be a mess that is now
under investigation from the Feds.


Here is the disclosure from OPK 10-Q below:


In April 2017, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the
Southern District of New York (the "SDNY") informed BioReference that it believes
that, from 2006 to the present, BioReference had, in violation of the False
Claims Act, improperly billed Medicare and Tricare (both are federal
government health care programs) for clinical laboratory services provided to
hospital inpatient beneficiaries at certain hospitals. BioReference is reviewing
and assessing the allegations made by the SDNY, and, at this point, BioReference
has not determined whether there is any merit to the SDNY's claims nor can it
determine the extent of any potential liability. While management cannot predict the

outcome of these matters at this time, the ultimate outcome could be material to our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.


Our thoughts on how management created this disaster are below:


Conflicts may have contributed to the share price elevation


OPK is based in south Florida and is the brain child of one Dr. Phillip Frost - Dr. Frost
serves as both CEO and Chairman of the company. He also serves as Chairman of the
Board of Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. the bank that has bestowed the highest price
target on the company (a ridiculous $19.50).


These price targets are not based in reality - the clinical lab business can not support
more than a $1/$2 share price and the clinical assets are a series of blunders (as we
detail below).


Management Does not Understand the Clinical lab Billing Regulations (Significant
Error in Judgment)

Clinical labs bill the local Medicare Administrative Contractor - and by local we mean the
contractor that has won the jurisdiction where the Laboratory is located - the patient's
location has nothing to do with the billing. This is important to understand for a number
of reasons


The local MAC for the New Jersey Labs that OPK bought in the BRLI transaction is
Novitas


1.


We believe that OPK bought BRLI because they thought there was some "magic
sauce" to their billing strategy that allowed them to get high priced genomics tests
through Medicare - this was going to help get the "4k" test covered and generate
additional sales to justify the transaction. Novitas is not traditionally considered to be
a thought leader in the clinical lab space so there was a small chance of a positive
Local Coverage Decision (LCD) - and in fact Novitas initially did issue a positive draft
coverage decision only to yank it when they realized how weak the data behind the
test was


2.


Palmetto GBA (in South Carolina) published a negative LCD on the OPK 4k test
(finalized on 01/01/17) highlighting that it provided LINK HERE.


3.


Specifically Palmetto States:


Despite the claims offered by these authors, their study is significantly
flawed. Their model includes patients outside of the intended use population (PSA
> 10 ng/mL) and patients who previously were biopsied with no cancer discovered.
Furthermore, in their iteration of the formula it is unclear how much hK2
contributes above using all the other components which are commercially
available. Total PSA contribution is very significant. The AUC of the full model is
0.821, and without the incorporation of the hK2 the AUC is 0.806 with overlapping
confidence intervals. Throughout the studies there is 1) inconsistent use of PSA as
a threshold for biopsy; 2) significant changes to the methodology (use of F(ab')
fragments of the monoclonal capture antibodies); and 3) modification of the
algorithm. Furthermore, earlier data was generated on (usually) a 6 core sextant
biopsy and likely does not reflect the tissue volume assessed in American men.

In summary, the intended use population has been inadequately validated;
the 4Kscore model has continuously changed; the model has been recurrently
tested on potentially inappropriate patients (PSA > 10) and patients with inadequate

biopsy sampling; it is unclear how much the hK2 and possibly intact PSA contribute
to the model; the value of the 4Kscore model/algorithm is fraught with
statistical hypothesis and not prospective outcomes or concordance in a
defined patient population likely to be considered for biopsy (eg: PSA 3-10
ng/mL); assumptions are made that no harm will come to following young men with
unknown low grade prostate cancer (not on AS); there is significant difficulty
equating the model used in the Swedish study to the presently proposed formula;
and the incidence of clinically diagnosable prostate cancer in patients with low risk
by the model/algorithm at 10 years is very concerning.
Consequently, due to significant issues with assay validation and absence of
clinical utility, 4Kscore testing is not reasonable and necessary and is not
covered by Medicare.


OK but you just told us that Novitas is the only one who counts right? Why do we
care about Palmetto?


This is important - in the world of Medicare lab billing the Palmetto staff is considered to
be best in class. So much so that when Noridian (separate MAC) won the J1 jurisdiction
from Palmetto (CA,NV,AZ) CMS requested that they follow all of Palmetto's decisions
regarding lab tests - so much so that the principle reason we even have gene specific
codes for molecular diagnostics is that Palmetto started doing it on their own (and the
AMA got scared so they wrote up new codes).


So in this case Palmetto is the equivalent of Jesus and Mary and the holy spirit.


BRLI is Strike 1 on Frost and company's credibility, Strike two is Rayaldee


Rayaldee seeks to displace vitamin D in patients with chronic kidney disease. It is not
dissimilar form a nutraceutical in that the product is a slightly different form of Vitamin D
that the company claims will offer patients and advantage over the supplemental Vitamin
D that has been used for decades. Although we expect that payers will reimburse the
product there are multiple step edits and hurdles to overcome:


This drug is going to be restricted to nephrologists1.


It will be on the highest cost tier in the formulary2.


Vitamin D will continue to be the preferred treatment - patients will have to fail it as a
prior authorization to having Rayaldee approved

This number of step edits is going to cause the launch to be excruciatingly slow. Our

Strike 3 is the HGH Asset and The Fact That Dr. Tony Cruz Is Filing the BLA


Its hard for us to be polite about the way OPK has communicated this failure. If you
could indulge us with a few declarative statements:


The CEO (Dr. Frost) has suggested, on Bloomberg television (LINK), that a single
patient in the placebo arm was responsible for the outperformance of the placebo
and subsequent trial failure. A well designed trial would have been designed to throw
out a newly minted CrossFit member for a protocol violation - that person wouldn't't
have been reported in the final analysis.


1.


One person can not possibly throw an entire trial off unless it is severely
underpowered (again management judgment is questionable)


2.


The FDA is unlikely to accept the filing if the placebo responders are filtered out.3.


To our knowledge Dr. Tony Cruz has never successfully filed a BLA - much less a
BLA with a meta analysis


4.


Perhaps a second post we will offer greater detail around the clinical candidates and
drug product.


Good Luck To All
