CTE’S representations conflict with results of
competitor survey.


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


SinoTech Energy Limited (NASDAQ: CTE $2.80) claims it is “using


leading edge technologies, include certain patented lateral


hydraulic drilling, or LHD, technologies,” And that CTE, has it “an


exclusive right to use their technologies in China.”


CTE claims that Jet-Drill Well Services, LLC has given it an exclusive


right to the Landers patent that it called its “base patent.” (See the


patent diagram here). However, there are at least three companies


providing LHD services in China. Two of CTE’s Chinese competitors


are joint ventures with U. S. companies that use the Landers patent.


One is a former owner of the Landers patent that retained rights


use to the patents in China. The other is the current owner. Below is


a description of the three companies doing business in China.


One of CTE’s competitors in China is Shanghai Witsun Jetdrill


Enhancement Services Co., Ltd (“Witsun”). Witsun’s website states


that the company is an industry key player specializing in LHD


services. To see their website click here.


Witsun is an exclusive partner of Well Enhancement Services


(“WES”). To see WES’ website click here.


Yantai Jereh Oilfield Services Group Co., Ltd. (“Jereh”) is a company


also located in China that has a joint venture with Radial Drilling


Services, Inc. (“RDS”) to provide Jereh with LHD equipment and


support services. To see their websites click here and here. RDS is


recognized to be the world’s largest LHD manufacturer and


operator. RDS using the patented technology that includes the


Landers patent that CTE claims to be their “base patent.”


Jereh, and RDS are beginning their venture with only $1.5 million.


CTE, has already purportedly spend $120 million on the 20 LHD
