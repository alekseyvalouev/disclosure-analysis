NanoViricides: House Of Cards With -80% Downside, 'Strong Sell'
Recommendation
Feb. 11, 2014 9:00 AM ET157 comments
by: Pump Terminator


PLEASE SEE FULL DISCLOSURE IN OUR PROFILE


Aside from sounding like the name of another terrible Keanu Reeves movie, NanoViricides
(NYSEMKT:NNVC) is the worst US reverse merger we have ever seen. NNVC is so
obviously a vehicle designed specifically to enrich insiders we find it offensively similar to
the China RTO frauds. This is the first report in a series we will release outlining the most
egregious shareholder violations we are aware of in any NYSE company. With multiple
questionable stock promoters NNVC has pumped the stock +330% while heavily diluting
shareholders and stealing NNVC out from under public investors as insiders siphoned off
millions of dollars. We also believe one of NNVC's top scientists has been dishonest which
calls into question NNVC's "technology," which we believe is clearly not viable. NNVC's
fair value is <$1 versus current trading price of $4.60 and is currently breaking down from
the large unrestricted stock selling volume created by the (yet another) recent RDO equity
sale. Our medium-term price target is $0.00 as we believe NNVC will implode once it is
unable to raise cash, like the CEO, co-founder and ex-CFO's previous defunct company,
SSUR.


Whistleblower Document: "Smoking Gun"


NNVC shareholders seem unaware of this incriminating must-read document, written by a
company insider and supporter, which outlines countless examples and allegations of
NNVC managers Seymour and Diwan abusing shareholders and looting the company.
Once NNVC insiders face subpoena power under threat of perjury, we don't see how
anything will be left for NNVC shareholders. As you read this please keep in mind: If this is
how NNVC treats a longtime supporter and associate how do you think it will treat YOU, a
faceless public shareholder?


Have NNVC Management Effectively Stolen the Company Out from Under
Shareholders?


It seems to us Anil Diwan and Eugene Seymour have stolen all potential value in NNVC
from public US shareholders. Let us explain and introduce the two main players.

NNVC's CEO Eugene Seymour on RedChip (RedChip is famous for promoting multiple
China frauds)


NNVC's president, cofounder and chairman Anil Diwan,


(also cofounder and majority owner of Theracour Pharma)


First, NNVC does not own any of the intellectual property or patents under development
by NNVC. 100% of NNVC's research, development and "technology" relies on licenses on
the IP from Theracour. As a result, NNVC is literally nothing without the "Theracour
Pharma, Inc" relationship. Unfortunately for NNVC, Theracour is also majority owned and
controlled by NNVC's President, Chairman and co-founder Anil Diwan. If the Theracour
relationship were terminated or changed for the worse, there would literally be zero
technology or IP left with NNVC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 3/45


Brammel's suit revealed the following: In 2007 and 2009 Brian Brammel (longtime
associate and supporter of Eugene Seymour) raised money from his network so NNVC
could allegedly begin early stage work on Dengue Fever, Ebola and Keratoconjunctivitis.
What Brian and his investors was not told was NNVC had never signed any licensing
agreements with Theracour for these diseases. Brian Brammel only learned this absurdity
after NNVC had spent the money and came back to him for more money to now be used
to pay Theracour for the licensing on the diseases Brian had already funded development
on! Diwan and Eugene seem to have deliberately used NNVC's cash to develop drugs for
the benefit of Diwan's Theracour to which NNVC had no rights.


NNVC then had to pay Theracour to secure these licenses. However, in a worrisome
conflict of interest, Anil Diwan seems to have controlled both sides of this transactions for
both NNVC and Theracour. As a result, Diwan and Seymour decided to create and pay
Theracour (and themselves) 7,000,000 (at the time) brand new specially crafted "Series A
Preferred Stock" (worth ~$36m today). No shareholder vote took place, nor were any
disclosures on the details of this transaction, fairness opinions or independent consultant
analysis ever provided to shareholders that we could find.


Devil in The Details: "stolen control of the company and now have absolute
dictatorial power"


The trick is these "Series A Preferred Stock" have very unusual terms only offered to
insiders which grant them "absolute dictatorial power" over NNVC, while Diwan already
controls Theracour. Originally, each A share converted into 4 shares of NNVC stock and
carried 4 votes per share but on 6/15/2012 (after the insider lawsuit first became filed)
mysteriously the Preferred shares were amended to each carry an astonishing 9 votes
each! This may not seem important until you do the math on what this means.


In effect, this means NNVC insiders granted Theracour an astonishing 63,000,000 votes
total (at the time). So all in Eugene Seymour and Anil Diwan (the only two board members
at the time) in 2012 increased their own voting control from ~30% to 54% and effectively
stole control of NNVC from shareholders.


"We want to avoid having to go to shareholders every time we need something" -
CEO Eugene Seymour discussing Brammel proxy by email


After this they required no shareholder meetings or approval of anything they do. If they
raised their cash compensation to $50m per year or sold the Theracour licenses back to
themselves for $1, there is essentially nothing shareholders could do to stop them. While

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 4/45


all the dilution has impacted this math slightly, with (what we believe is) Leo Ehrlich's likely
share ownership while Diwan, Seymour and insiders continue receiving egregious A
shares, NNVC shareholders can look forward to much more "dictatorial control" of NNVC
by Diwan and Seymour. If Leo Ehrlich did not own shares why is NNVC seemingly
keeping shareholders from inspecting the shareholder registry and trading records??


"In real terms the officers and directors have been slowly and methodically stealing
voting control of the company for their own self-dealing pursuits." -Brian Brammel
Complaint Direct Quote


So now, we believe if you own NNVC shares you quite literally own nothing. You own a
subordinated piece of paper without useful voting control that is held hostage by people
who control all the value and seem to dictate the terms NNVC shareholders (you) pay
them. With Anil and Eugene seemingly controlling the public cash raising machine and
together controlling Theracour, which receives the cash and holds all the value, they have
created the perfect vehicle to get rich. They combined a public financing vehicle that
bleeds shares into the market to unknowing public investors while Theracour and insiders
get the money. Where are NNVC's original articles of incorporation and bylaws? They are
referenced in the 10ks but we cannot find them filed with SEC as they claim anywhere.


Interestingly, we also could find no evidence Anil Diwan himself was ever elected in any
legitimate shareholder meeting…. Nor was a proper shareholder meeting called for first 7
years of company's existence and no proper shareholder meeting called to select the
current CEO either?!


"the Board has avoided calling shareholder meetings because the Board knows it
would not be able to obtain sufficient votes to approve these transactions and
intentionally chose to disregard the requirement of calling such meetings." -
Brammel Complaint Direct Quote


If Anil and Eugene did not intend to unfairly enrich themselves at the expense of NNVC
shareholders why did they create this unusual structure resulting in their complete control
of the company??


Theracour Pharma: Taking Cash from NNVC Shareholders and Giving it to Anil
Diwan


In case you were wondering the answer to the question above, read on:
5/22/2018 NanoViricides: House Of Cards With -80% Downside, 'Strong Sell' Recommendation - NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSEMKT:NNVC) | Seeking …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 5/45


"specifically Seymour (NNVC CEO) represented to Mr. Brammel that Diwan did not
want CIMS (Brian Brammel's Company) to be further involved with the company
because he felt CIMS was trying to take things away from him and that he (Diwan)
felt that CIMS's questions about the licensing agreement were meant to take
benefits he had received under the agreement away from him as they were not fair
and of market value." -Brian Brammel Complaint (emphasis added)


This sounds to us like NNVC CEO Seymour personally admitting Diwan discussed how
the Theracour agreement is not fair to NNVC shareholders and was not of market value.
So we believe either CEO Seymour lied here to Brammel, or Chairman and President
Diwan lied about the original Theracour agreement being fair and signed off by an
independent consultant. Where is this consultant's report and the detailed original
Theracour contract? Given this is the (only) important part of NNVC why has this not been
provided publicly to shareholders?


Furthermore, Theracour's terms (what we could find) seem egregious to us and not in line
with industry standards:


"(1) that TheraCour can charge its costs (direct and indirect) plus no more than 30%
of direct costs as a development fee"


Apparently, Theracour can gouge NNVC for an arbitrarily decided "30% of direct cost"
additional fee? As Diwan is 70% owner of Theracour, 70% of this money is his and how
much cash he has received is not explained in the SEC filings. Even worse: "TheraCour
may terminate the License upon a material breach by us as specified in the agreement." If
Diwan and Seymour control NNVC can't they also control if NNVC agrees to a "material
breach" and gives Theracour back the IP that NNVC shareholders paid to develop?


Is it a coincidence that now, after seizing total voting control of NNVC, Diwan suddenly
hires his own wife at NNVC paying her a very healthy salary and then Diwan goes on to
also suddenly decide, apparently without independent opinion, NNVC now needs to pay
millions of dollars in build out costs on a building Diwan owns?


NNVC's Absurd Manufacturing Facility: Giving More NNVC Shareholder Money to
Anil Diwan


In another example of NNVC Diwan and Seymour extracting shareholder cash, they
recently determined NNVC now requires their own cGMP compliant manufacturing facility.
They also decided the best way to do this would be for Anil to sell NNVC shares in the

open market when SeaSide88's conversion rate was being determined, unnecessarily
causing even more shareholder dilution. Diwan then used this money to purchase a
building in his own entity "Inno-Haven, LLC" that NNVC would then pay millions of dollars
to build out. Allegedly Diwan's personal attorney (also an NNVC shareholder) even
oversaw both sides of this transaction! Is there really not a single facility in the world that
NNVC could use that was not owned by Diwan? Where was the independent analysis
indicating this was the best choice?


Even worse, as of 1/27/2014 NNVC does not have any lease or terms signed for the
building it is paying for! NNVC is once again spending resources to develop assets owned
by Diwan before establishing the terms or costs it will incur. We sense shareholders are
about to get pillaged again.


"NNVC will be forced to comply or miss critical deadlines for its FDA submissions
and abandon its substantial investment made for Diwan's asset. Diwan will be in a
position to dictate terms and with Seymour will have dictatorial vote in the Company
to control the terms of the lease." -Brian Brammel Complaint Direct Quote


Anil Hires His Wife as CFO While Auditor and Internal Financial Controls are Failing


NNVC uses a tiny "no name" auditor repeatedly cited for numerous deficiencies including
"failure to perform sufficient audit procedures to test cash", which seems like basic audit
work to us. If NNVC's auditor is not even verifying cash then what is it verifying?


We estimate, in the first 24 quarters NNVC was in existence NNVC had to file "notification
of inability to timely file" it's SEC filings more than 19 times. Why a company with zero
revenue outsourcing virtually all its operations seems unable to get their accounting and
SEC filings in on time is baffling.


Shareholders need not worry, however! Diwan recently hired his own wife, "Meeta Vyas,"
as CFO so she can supposedly look out for shareholders and ensure the financials are
honest….


There is no excuse for a public company with more than a few million dollars to not be
using a reputable big 4 auditor. NNVC shareholders should demand this to ensure their
financial statements are reliable.


NNVC "Science" Verified by Krishna Menon: Apparently With A Record of "False
Claims"?

NNVC's "Chief Regulatory Officer", Krishna Menon


Krishna Menon (originally a veterinarian in Jamaica) is not just Chief Regulatory Office but
also principal owner and COO of "KARD Scientific" the lab that NNVC uses for their often
cited animal models and studies NNVC touts as efficacy evidence. All researchers
obviously stake their entire career on accuracy, validity, reliability and honesty yet Menon
appears to have more discrepancies than any public executive we have ever seen. Truly
incredible.


We will not repeat this hilariously embarrassing article so read this now. Ironically it is
authored by a journalist Menon originally contacted to get more blindly supportive media
attention.


- India New England Article on Krishna Menon: "Researchers many claims don't check
out."


"routine fact-checking by INDIA New England soon revealed that the story of Krishna
Menon contained many false claims and exaggerations" - India New England Article


We noticed this story was no longer on India New England's website and some claim it
was taken down because it was false. We called India New England and here is what we
were told about the article's accuracy: "All entirely true, no question. The only reason we
took it down is the editor is no longer with us and this story caused quite a stir, and we
grew tired of all the phone calls when the editor who wrote it doesn't even work here
anymore."


Amazingly we found even more examples of conflicts in what Menon has publicly said. In
his NNVC management biography he claims "a PhD in Pharmacology in 1984 from
Harvard University " and yet in the CTIX management biography (where he is President)
he claims "a PhD in Pharmacology from Kerala University ". We don't see how Menon can
be telling the truth in both statements.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 8/45


It seems Menon claimed in 2005 (when NNVC came public) to be "the holder of 7 US
patents ", yet when we searched the US patent database we could find no patents of
Menon's before he made these claims? Did Menon lie about this or did NNVC fail to do
even the most basic of background checks?


Furthermore, allegedly Vivien Boniuk, MD from Feinstein's Institute who has done
"research" for NNVC is also a shareholder. Where is the truly independent analysis?
Where are the big pharma companies knocking down their door with huge cash payments
for exclusive research contracts like BIND? Is it really impossible to find an independent
lab to test your drugs that is not owned and run by a company insider?


Instead NNVC shareholders are fed a steady diet of "imminent news," promises and
promotion that never materialize into anything meaningful like this absurd 2009 press
release about agreement with unnamed "Major Pharma" that turned out to be nothing.


Eugene Seymour and Leo Ehrlich's previous company "Saliva Diagnostics" seems to have
essentially gone straight to zero and appears to have received law suits and multiple FDA
warning letters . This defunct company now trades with ticker SSUR for $0.05 per share
with $198k market cap (not a typo).


Given all of this, we find it hard to believe anything these people say is true.


NNVC Insiders Are Getting Rich


By our estimates, of the ~$36m in cash NNVC has raised (excluding the recent equity
sales, they haven't had time to spend that yet) insiders have collected ~$8m in
compensation, a full 22% of every dollar they have received. This excludes any sums
received by Theracour which would further enrich Diwan and Ehrlich received by Diwan or
Ehrlich, and any KARD compensation Menon received. For example, as 70% owner of
Theracour, Diwan is entitled to 70% of the ~$36m in "Series A Preferred Shares," or $25m
in value if converted into shares at current stock price, that he created and paid himself.

NNVC then spent another $7m on SG&A (whatever that includes for a company with
basically no operations). These two items alone are a full 42% of all the money NNVC has
raised. We estimate NNVC has only performed testing on ~5k animals which makes the
~$20m "spent" on R&D over the past 7 years also very questionable.


How have the millions of dollars of insider compensation and expenses been financed? By
heavily diluting shareholders of course


Continuously Using RDOs Leaves NNVC Vulnerable to "Death Spiral"


"I don't give a $h*t what the market price is, I just want to get this done quickly…"


- NNVC CEO, Eugene Seymour from Brammel Complaint Email Exhibit (apparently
displaying his attitude towards shareholder dilution while discussing terms of yet another
dilutive capital raise.)


Most companies sell equity to institutional investors directly when they need cash. Not
NNVC, as they rely on a special toxic type of equity financing called a "Registered Direct
Offering" or RDO. Instead of placing shares of stock with long-term supporters of the
company, RDOs instead are typically offered at enormous discounts to hedge funds who
usually dump the shares into the market as quickly as possible. For instance, NNVC's last

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2010691-nanoviricides-house-of-cards-with-minus-80-percent-downside-strong-sell-recommendation 10/45


RDO sold shares at $5.25 when shares traded as high as $6.54 the previous day, and
NNVC still had to throw in ~2.6m warrants to get the deal done. Another RDO NNVC did
with "SeaSide88" was offered at a 26% discount to the previous day's price, included a
10% dividend on unconverted shares, and had warrants.


The risk in this is that NNVC becomes what we call an "inception company" because it
only exists as long as shareholders believe it exists. They NEED you, the public
shareholder, to keep buying the stock or these RDOs stop working as there is nobody to
buy the discounted stock the hedge funds can sell into the market. Once the share price
breaks down, it requires an ever increasing amount of shares and warrants at increasingly
large discount to generate the cash required, until shareholders get diluted into oblivion.
Many shady junior gold mining companies are experiencing this dynamic currently.


In just the last 3 months NNVC has been diluting shareholders and selling shares to the
market hand over fist with 2 separate deals for ~$30m in the past 5 months. NNVC's
previous RDO sold stock at $3.50 per share , which is substantially below where the stock
is now. Anil Diwan himself has also sold stock into the open market in the high $2s. If
NNVC stock stays this elevated, we expect continued RDOs to provide insiders cash.


Do you think Diwan and NNVC are selling huge amounts of stock because they think the
stock is undervalued? Do you think there could be any connection between the company
needing money and all the conferences attended and stock promoters? Now that they
have the money what do you think happens to the stock next?


NNVC Management Response: "Total Bull$hit"


We had an investor contact NNVC on the phone and, when discussing the complaint, the
company representative was obviously shaken and responded loudly "that issue is
complete Bull$hit." NNVC claims since there is not a big monetary demand that there is
nothing to worry about but we believe that clearly misses the point. Some incredible
allegations have been brought to light and if some of these are true there is very real risk
NNVC faces severe punishment from the SEC or worse. This complaint is just the
beginning and we believe once Seymour and Diwan, things are only going to get worse.
Otherwise why was NNVC in such a hurry to do two RDOs so quickly? God knows how
bad it really is inside NNVC and there could be many more lawsuits of increasing severity
that could result in the end for this company in our view. Furthermore, NNVC only survives
due to a consistent stream of shareholder money and so when public investors decide
"enough is enough" NNVC will cease to exist. Taking drugs through the required FDA
stages can easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars which NNVC does not have.

Unfortunately we did not receive articulate responses supported by facts but instead
received more useless blanket statements. We believe NNVC needs to hold an open and
public conference call with an opportunity for all investors to voice their questions and then
NNVC needs to respond in detail to all allegations with responses supported in
documented fact. Otherwise, they lose all credibility and should resign.


NNVC Valuation Completely Detached From Reality


Shareholders have recently been willing to pay $4.60 per share, based on our estimate of
56.4m shares, gives NNVC an eye popping $260m market cap for this "business." Even if
you assume NNVC's licenses from Diwan's Theracour are based on legitimate science
AND ever shown to be valuable AND you believe NNVC management will let
shareholders keep the upside (all of which we doubt) NNVC's current valuation STILL
makes zero sense:


For example, BIND therapeutics, a clinical stage nanomedicine biotech platform company
(unlike NNVC) has formal collaborations with Amgen, Pfizer and AstraZeneca for
development and a potential game changing (BIND-014) compound already in phase 2
clinical trials for lung and prostate cancer. BIND theoretically has enormous potential
payments of up to $1b in upfront and milestone payments with $450m potentially pre
commercial . BIND has received millions in upfront payments from AMGN, PFE and
AstraZeneca with these huge pharma partners also agreeing to pay for development
costs. BIND even has $80m in cash!


NNVC has none of these positives yet NNVC trades at a much higher value!! Even if you
choose to ignore all the scary NNVC red flags above (BIND appears to have none of
these) NNVC at a minimum should trade at a lower valuation than BIND, which alone
indicates more than -30% to -40% downside per share depending on the appropriate
discount. And this assumes you believe NNVC is a legitimate company with good
management looking out for your best interests.…


NNVC trades for 21.5x tangible book value and a huge premium to other obviously
superior biotech companies so we caution that as this story comes unwound there is
almost no downside support. We expect to see NNVC trade -80% or more from here, as
NNVC stock has done in the past.


We think NNVC should trade for less than cash given egregious dilution and cash burn
(biotechs often trade for less than cash for these reasons) but even applying a generous
premium to NNVC gives a per share value of less than $1 or -82% downside.

CONCLUSION


The early stage biotech industry is tough for shareholders under the best circumstances.
Well-funded companies staffed with honest and legitimate scientists putting shareholder
value first, still fail constantly. NNVC has burned ~$33m in cash over the past nearly 7+
years and done essentially nothing as far as we can tell except dilute public shareholders,
make insiders rich and develop Anil Diwan's technology.


Even if you believe NNVC has legitimate technology with the best management team, who
you believe will put your shareholder interests ahead of your own, NNVC valuation still
makes zero sense. With 10k+ publicly traded companies and thousands of life sciences
companies, we cannot imagine why anyone is unable to find something better to do with
their money than "invest" it in this worthless shell where shareholders own virtually nothing
and management seems intent on extracting all the money for themselves. NNVC is
clearly held together with scotch tape and we recommend investors sell their shares
immediately before this house of cards comes crashing down.


Disclosure: I am short NNVC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Anyone who just read this defamatory article should immediately read the April 16 news release on NNVC it
is an international award honoring and recognizing the management and original scientist as the most
important nano scientist in THE WORLD plus it up dates on FDA trial requirements etc it put this slam piece
right in the garbage where it was born and should have stayed.

sleuth, 
I agree! Who are you going to believe - an anonymous Internet blogger who refers to himself as Pump
Terminator or professionals who recognize the trailblazing strides this company is making? NNVC is on the
verge of providing to the World the next "penicillin-like" class of drugs. BTW, we will probably not hear again
from the manipulator known as Pump Terminator as SA is being sued to reveal his/her identity, and evidence

There might be some big pharma behind the attacks on NNVC. I have been observing this stock for a while.
They secured their independent ownership through a few layers of security to avoid a hostile takeover. The
competition is so alarmed and nervous about NNVC's novel solutions of killing viruses that they decided to
deploy ugly play against its management. The fight is just starting. They will do anything in their power to
derail potential success of NNVC. They will initiate more bad press coverage (the recent New Yorker
Observer's article is a joke and Duff McDonald just copies PT). But PT started barking again with the
assistance of Rawnoc from Investor'sHub. They all put absolutely no merits and science behind their attacks,
just pure speculation. I am surprised of the judge's verdict protecting identity of the scammer. If you are a
legitimate player here do not be afraid to identify yourself. I do not believe at all of your pure intentions to
protect investors from NNVC's fraud. Your tone and language are so vicious, PT, that one day you will just
suffocate by your own bitterness and misery.

I just checked your link bashing CTIX. Dyman Associates is an investment company & no where on its

Message Boards or SA. Their drugs may not prove to work, but there is absolutely no evidence that they are
run like NNVC. This morning's price action proves that.

That link was garbage, & if that's "evidence", then its as weak as it gets. Again, I went to the Dyman website
& there was no evidence they were "pumping" CTIX. If anyone has gotten a "pumping" call from Dyman, I
would like to know about it. That Finnsih website had a 1 line blip, presenting or stating no evidence. As far as
the company is concerned, I'll wait & see how the drugs test out. If CTIX had been "pumped" by an outside
entity, it would have been posted all over the Yahoo message board months ago.

Well written and thought provoking article, I have started to follow your postings. I have been burnt in the past by

However based on your article , I tried to short NNVC through Schwab this morning and received a message when I
tried to place the trade that the stock was ineligible for a short.


How did you short it ?

This article makes a number of important points about NNVC, but it goes well over the top when it talks of Mr. Erhlich
and Dr. Menon. These two are doing outstanding work, rapidly advancing multiple drugs through clinical trials at CTIX.
There is a world of difference between the two companies.

A skeptic might think that one way to get cheap shares in a stock they know is going to be worth $100 a share
someday is to pay someone $1000 to run a "hedge fund" managing that money, go short the stock AND THEN write a
article trashing the stock.


How do we determine who is right?


To the author, why not use your real name and tell us what country you live in? 
Also, how large is your hedge fund and how large is your "short" position in NNVC?


I would not be surprised if I've personally made more money taking advantage of these bear raids to trash stocks
down than is in the hedge fund... but I've also had some stocks go under so there is always the risk the author is right.

company just ended phase 3 with a drug that is now at the FDA's door for an NDA for dialysis patients. Relaces iron
much more efficently during dialysis saving mucho money for the payers! Stock was 15 trasher brought it to $10 ish
claimed no good results but the chronic kidney meeting just last week or two gave them best in show award for new
drug! still waiting and holding on. Second PRAN a possible and currently best shot at,Alzheimer disease cure or at
least treatment, attacked a few days ago as not efficacy positive , but the trial was for TOXICITY. Which I'm betting
hugely likely to approve as all indications are positive, ala 5 FDA. Safety committee meetings during test and no
recommendation to change any protocols and 95% of cohort including placebos elected to go and completed a 12
month extension! Writer claimed data not good enough but the data has not been publicly disclosed, due by end this
Q. And now this one, this is a concentrated attack as you can see in he comments to undermine the co. They are
either great hoodwinkers d fooling various governments to get in bed with them while only interested in raping and
pillaging and yeah building facilities and raising millions to steal. Fooling the FDA. Into orphan drug status, not so

I had to laugh at the quote from India New England. This journal evidently said, "The only reason we took it down is
the editor is no longer with us and this story caused quite a stir, and we grew tired of all the phone calls"


I can only imagine how distressing it is for a publication's article to cause a stir. And gosh, having to answer the

Trond... The article you refer to was taken down after the editor received facts proving it was poorly
researched and included erroneous information.


I don't know much about NNVC and how their website is updated, but, Dr Menon is no longer affiliated with
them and has never been the one to update the information on the site. He can't be blamed for any errors.
The affiliation ended due to too many obligations with CTIX. Go to the CTIX website for accurate background
on Dr Menon. http://bit.ly/10rKRJE


Following is a short quote: "Dr. Menon is a trained veterinary surgeon and holds a PhD in Pharmacology from
Kerala University. His PhD work focused on anti-folate therapy of various cancers."


I can only imagine how many inaccuracies are in the above article after seeing the ones on a subject I'm
familiar with.

posted them under a pseudonym. CTIX is such a transparent company that they are willing to one-on-one
interviews between anonymous bloggers and the CEO! When you called up to ask for the interview, did you
say "hey Leo, this is KarenCA/Sharon/ActionJ... and I really want to do an exclusive interview with you? I
know you're not Equity Options Guru because it turned out he's a scammer named Tom Meyer who posted

I'm more of an investor type these days and started doing a tremendous amount of research on the
companies I invest in. I read SEC filings, news, blogs, whatever is available. The interesting thing is why I
started writing in the first place. I don't know if you recall, but, SA removed three articles on CTIX that were
discovered to be written by the same person. Before they removed them I was disgusted that three different
people could put out so much misinformation about a company. None of them even mentioned the ongoing
trial at Dana Farber. So, I decided to write something to clarify what the company was doing at that point in
time. Someone liked my article and sent it to the CEO.


He knows my full name. I'm not anonymous to him. And, because of having done two interviews I decided to
call him after seeing this article to see if there is any relationship at this point in time. He said there is none. I
believe him.


I've actually had other opportunities to interview CEO's since I routinely invest in biotech and these CEO's are
much more accessible than those of long established companies. Personal things have kept me from it the
past few months but my intention is to start writing again in the near future. And, I may start doing those
interviews with others. Time will tell.


Think what you like. I certainly understand how one can become jaded in this arena. Good luck in all your
trades and life in general.

I'd be curious to see what their situation was, when they were preclinical. How much the founders of that company
burned through of "the public's" money and how much they extracted?

I took a look at NNVC a week ago. Their approach to fight various diseases is novel and seems to have merit. Before
investing I like to see a technology moat or at east enough of a lead that it would be hard catch up. A cursory search
of the US patent archives yielded very little under the search terms of the company or " Anil Diwan". The two patents I
found were quite specific and, in my opinion, easy to circumvent. Also, the business structure among NVCC,
Theracour and Diwan seems peculiar, easily manipulated, and "incestuous". So I stayed away.

Just reread the co announcement that they raised $20 million ( now holding approx $40 million) and that capital will
fund phase 1 & 2 on humans for injectable flucide and also the dengue fever trials. Plus they must have fooled not
only the US FDA but also the Europeans as they have orphan drug designation from the European Medical Agency
(EMA). This was press released on Jan 21 '14. They claimed they received the funds from "institutions and current
stockholders". So are they just recycling the money they loot to put it back in to loot again? Doesn't make much sense
to me does it to you pumper dumper! The EMA is the European Agency to "evaluate medicinal products" according to
their web site. Its also the agency " responsible for the protection of public and animal health through the scientific
evaluation and supervision of medicines". Pretty strong to bother to bluff your way through he FDA. And those guys!
You are a manipulating short seller with the morals of?


The more I look the more ridiculous your claims are. I'm going to bed its late in thevAM here in Thailand. Good night

Orphan drug is in no way an endorsement of any drug. It only is acknowledgment that the sponsor has
chosen a small patient population. Nothing more, quoth the raven.

Robert0713... There must be scientific rationale to get a drug approved under Orphan Drug regulations. It’s
much more involved than simply looking at the patient population. Safety and effectiveness of a drug must be
established first.

You may want to read up on Orphan Drug regulations. Following are some FDA links on the subject that you
may find of interest:

-- Orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits, such as reduced taxes, from
the federal government. It does not mean the drug is safe and effective and legal to manufacture and market
in the United States.


12 Feb 2014, 10:00 AM


gbstern13
Robert-


You are correct in that Orphan designation does not mean the drug has passed all necessary safety and
efficacy thresholds to market. However, there are some thresholds and research data that needs to be
submitted and approved by the FDA to receive Orphan status. You make it seem like it's as simple as, "Hey,
we've got an idea for a small population drug treatment, can we have Orphan status please?" There is much
more to it than that.


While I think there are some interesting points raised in the article about the corporate structure, if the owner's
true intent was to defraud investors and enrich himself via shell companies, the time and money required to
deal with FDA filings (and European counterparts) would seem counterintuitive to that sole purpose.

Dr. Diwan, founder, President and Chairman of the Board commented, “This is a shameless attack from someone
who neither understands the science nor the development work that has gone into nanoviricides® drug candidates.
With very little money we have built a rich pipeline of drug candidates that are now getting closer to the clinic. I have
personally taken high risks in making certain that the Company can continue to advance by undertaking the building
of a highly specialized cGMP manufacturing facility at a time when NanoViricides did not have sufficient funds to be
able to commit to this critical venture. All of the biological testing of our drug candidates is conducted by third parties.
We are very happy to note that our drug candidates have been found to be safe and highly effective, and therefore
worthy of clinical development.”

Would agree with your comments but the article seems to conflict with the key premise of the article that it is a

Instead the author of the article appears to either be directly involved in the derivative and demand for

I bought this NNVC on advice from a pretty well known newsletter company. Shame on me for not reading the 10K... I
DID read it last night and was horrified. The major and multiple conflicts of interest and opportunities for self-dealing
for the exec team are worthy of the worst 'New Jersey/Chicago style politicians.' Even if they aren't taking undue
advantage, the sheer fact that they have __structured___ their company this way, is appallingly bad mgt practice re
the actual conflict of interest and the potential for egregious self-dealing, and enough reason to avoid this team like
the plague (pun intended), regardless of whether or not, or how much $$$ execs have 'unfairly taken' to date.) The
incestuous STRUCTURE is enough for me to say no, i want out, even if their products and services have technical
merit. 
That said, I bought low enough I realized a rather hefty 61% profit on NNVC this morning -- before it crashes far lower
on some new revelation of exec hanky panky. A BIG THANKS to the author and Seeking Alpha for the 'red flags
raising' that got me out with profit before a disaster. 
(BTW - This same tech newsletter is infamous imo, for missing similar red flags due to negligence due diligence wise,
eg the 'over reliance on a single large (crooked) Chinese customer' fiasco that was American Superconductor, that
lost me 96% of my investment overnight. This obvious red flag was not mentioned even once in their buy recco, or
many updates).

are then treated with NNVC drug candidates and they do not die. We have a winner here, a BIG. Winner in he

position was in a small spec-only account of my own money. I have been paying far more attention to other
accounts, including my fam clients who i have in much safer, often dividend paying positions. When I read up
on NNVC back in spring 2013 I didn't spot the structural issues, and liked the virus related story and upside,
for something the world really needs. Pandemic anyone? After that I didn't pay much attention to the position,

was a rare Cox recco that had real upside.


Assuming I'm a bear attacker is both _wrong on the facts and _distracts from alerting other long investors that
the CORPORATE STRUCTURE of NNVC created by the exec team is SUFFICIENT REASON to ditch this
flakey mgt and stock, imho. Don't fall in love with the bio story, look at the structure, it's just so wrong.


I don't care if they have world-beating technology, or perfect/cloudy IP rights... There are too many other fish
in the sea with solid technology and STRUCTURES that aren't _vulnerable to exec self-dealing. Like I said, I
don't care about whether the exec actually have/are or NOT doing self-dealing, or are or NOT screwing
shareholders... it's the shabby way they've structured it and the risk they _can self-deal, so easily, that justifies
an exit. Find a better, clear fudiciary, cleaner structured biotech team is my point.

A few weeks ago I emailed NNVC to see if they were having any upcoming trials for chikungunya because a good
friend of mine was suffering from the long term effects of this virus. Lo and behold, much to my surprise I received a
phone call from Dr Seymour. He was very polite and seemed interested in my friend's condition and offered some
recommendations. In over 15 yrs of investing, I've never received the time of day from any executives of any publicly
traded company. And get this, I have never bought any shares of NNVC before or after I spoke with Dr Seymour. All I
can say, that from my experience Dr Seymour is a stand up guy. There seems to be a lot of complaints about this
company not producing any products or revenues for many years. Welcome to the world of biotech. Also, after
reading many of the above comments that accuse the reporter (who publishes a damaging article but refuses to use
his real name) of writing inaccurate information, well, it seems to me that this critique of this company is not worth the

Yes clearly they have top level science tech and world class collaborators. Top line scientists don't bother with less
than top line solutions to the quests they are on. The renewal says everything you need to know about the drug
candidates credibility! There can be NO doubt about the legitimacy of the company and in sifting thru the rebuttals to
the piece there is thin if any facts that remain for these fearmongers to stand on to attack the stock.. 
If the science continues to work as it has so brilliantly on animals (curing deadly doses of deadly diseases) when
being exposed to human trials this stock is going to be worth hundreds of dollars a share. 
Two more points are that the company's drugs do not enter into the bodies cells so the likely negative side effects are
significantly minimized. And secondly the human trials will be shorter than most FDA trials because if you are
scheduled to die due to some nasty virus and you don't its rather readily recognized that it worked. Yes if a body is
cleared of a disease causing virus it's sort of black or white. I am anxiously awaiting trials. Bring it on Dr Seymour!
Lets get the cGMP facility up and approved so we can get into testing and I believe that facility is due in a month or 2. 
Lastly the company claims that the master method behind the functioning for each disease can in weeks be adapted
to any virus as it is sort of like fooling the virus to think it found its cell target while it really is meeting a deadly mate.

You are right on in your analysts. The product is unique because it does not interact with cellular
mechanisms, the immune system or other complex chemical pathways in the body. What happens in vitro and
in animals should be exactly what happens in humans. We just need to know it is safely cleared fro the body.

It would be a shame for such a good source of negative sentiment for volatile stocks to vanish. I count on it
for getting cheap shares with nice gains already from buying the day this article broke.


Yahoo! message boards are filled with anonymous bull crap. Many of us feel the same about a good
percentage of the articles here.


An article here by someone admitting he is short and hoping to profit from the stock going down and unwilling
to use a real name should be a huge clue to the validity of the arguments.

I also like SA but it is a vehicle, and an effective one for misinformation used by bear raiders! I've had the misfortune
of having had 3 companies and stock positions attacked by what I would term flimsy sleazy articles that served to
trounce share values in the last month or two. PRAN still being wounded unfairly I think and RMTI a bit back as not
having good phase 3 data, even tho both of these companies haven even RELEASED. The data ! RMTI just now
recovering as the info is out ( not the FDA data but overview as they finished the phase 3) it is now rallying. So take
the hit and wait for the recover. I'm glad NNVC is fighting back, the other 2 just foolishly took punches to the face and
gut and didn't respond. 
NNVC management IS. Stockholder friendly !

I don't understand why it is a problem when you are long on a stock that the price goes down. Isn't that just a
wonderful chance to buy more? "Whether it's socks or stocks, I like to buy when things are marked down." WEB . 
Personally I wouldn't invest in Nanovoricides because they don't even have an answering machine with their name on
it. Has anyone here actually visited their laboratories? Etc. It is also outside my circle of competence and the people
who know their stuff ( high ranking CAPS players at Fool.com ) , don't like it.

I was long NNVC, believing it to have amazing potential with a novel concept. I am disappointed to hear that Dr.
Diwan has only two relevant patents, both easily sidestepped. Now I wonder how Dr. Diwan can conjure up multiple
unrelated ligands at the drop of a hat, while other companies involve dozens of medicinal chemists with
supercomputers to do the same thing for just one. A year or two ago, I called Dr. Seymour to complain about how
thinly spread out the company's efforts seemed to be (flu, HIV, rabies, ebola, etc.) without a focus on one entity to
drive the company's fortunes in human clinical therapeutics. He was the chummiest of all individuals with whom I
have ever had the pleasure of talking, and said that he also graduated from Columbia's medical school a few years
ahead of me. Today I became suspicious and called the alumni office, to find that there are no records of a Eugene
Seymour having ever graduated from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Further, I cannot
find a curriculum vitae for Dr. Seymour anywhere on the NNVC website. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have been conned
twice before, and I am terribly afraid that NNVC is the third time.

FYI, I am neither long nor short NNVC. BTW, a true curriculum vitae states exact time periods for training, position

He is an alumni of the Baylor College of Medicine, class of '65 (713) 798-4054. You don't get alumni records

of information. In fact, I would call her a fraud, as few of her "facts" ever check out the way she presents
them.


25 Feb 2014, 12:53 PM


Old Turk
STJ, I did call Baylor, and you are correct: Dr. Seymour was indeed awarded an M.D. degree in 1965. And
Baylor is a first rate place. Nonetheless, I have to wish you the best with this group of individuals, as I suspect
that a management that doesn't hold annual meetings, that holds a majority of the voting shares and that
controls the flow of funds to other closely held entities (per Pump Terminator) won't have the welfare of other
NNVC stockholders at the top of its priority list. I await publication of NNVC's FluCide results in humans in a
peer-reviewed journal. If the results are as predicted by Drs. Diwan and Seymour, this technique will
represent a major step forward in medical care. If the preclinical results have been fudged by the good Dr.
Menon (remember the painted mice at Memorial Sloan Kettering?), it will only mean that NNVC wasn't the
place to be. I still admire the novel concept of letting viruses self-destruct on nanospheres laced with
appropriate ligands.


The generic concept of nanospheres sporting ligands is not broadly patentable; there are many such products
already in production for other purposes. A very specific ligand can find a patent, but these products are of
such high molecular weight that an easily engineered small change could seek its own patent.

If I were the FDA, I would insist on duplicate animal studies done in a truly independent laboratory prior to
allowing human trials. And I would insist on a squeaky clean inspection of the cGMP facility that would
manufacture the therapeutic product.


I tip my hat to Drs. Seymour, Diwan and Menon for bringing such excitement to the field of medicine. I just
wish that they didn't look like such a den of thieves.


25 Feb 2014, 04:36 PM


STJ
Old Turk -


1. They have held annual meetings for the last 2 yrs.


2. Diwan's interests are very much aligned with those of NNVC shareholders. TheraCour's IP is not worth
much without a clear path to commericalization. NNVC is that clear path. If something happened to that
realtionship Diwan would lose valuable time to market and without the financial rescources of NNVC he would
have to start over with fund raising. Who would trust him at that point if he had just pulled the rug somehow
on NNVC? The issue raised there just does not survive a common sense analysis. And now it looks like
NNVC may well purchase the new manufacturing plant which, if it happens, would further distance Diwan
from market success in the event of problems with that realtionship (a relationship which by the way is spelled
out very clearly by agreement, and which only allows termination for material breach with 90 days to remedy).


3. Data fudged by Menon?? How about the results from USAMRIID (Ebola), Dr. Gus Kousoulas at LSU
(HSV), Dr. Eva Harris at Berkeley(Dengue).... were those all fudged too? Not to mention they are currently
lined up for testing with 3 world class organizations - Viroclinics, Public Health England and LRRI.


4. They were issued very broad application of their key patent as can be seen here -


"The US Patent has been allowed with a very broad range of claims to a large number of families of chemical
structure compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of making the same, and uses of the same.
The disclosed structures enable self-assembling, biomimetic nanomedicines. NanoViricides, Inc. holds
exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licenses to these technologies for a broad range of antiviral applications and
diseases."


"It is rewarding to see that the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recognized the novelty and the
broad utility of the entire ‘pi-polymer’ class of materials as defined by the inventors, and granted a patent with
sufficient scope to protect the whole of the invention, for all foreseeable pharmaceutical applications, including
the nanoviricides® anti-viral substances,” said Dr. James Demers, PhD, JD, now with Gotham Patent
Services LLC, who represents the inventors before the USPTO and directs the international patenting effort.
He further added, “The application was drafted so as to describe and claim Dr. Diwan's invention, on which
the nanoviricides® technology is based, as broadly as possible, and we anticipate that other countries around
the world will also grant claims similar to those allowed by the USPTO.”

Old Turk,


 
No problem, sometimes it is hard to discern the thoughtful posters such as yourself from the bashers with an
agenda that are great at misleading and distorting such as Teri Buhl and the author of this Seeking Alpha
article (if indeed they are separate entities).


 
Let me add #5 to the above -


 
5. If it is such a "den of thieves" why would a Director (Dr. Boniuk) invest $7M in the company? By the way,
Dr. Boniuk first learned of the company through his sister, Dr. Vivien Boniuk (another independent tester), who
performed animal studies on the Company’s drug candidates for adenovirus and herpes virus infections of the
eye. The article implied that this was another inside job since she is related to a board member, when in fact it
is completely the opposite.... she introduced her brother to the company as a direct result of being impressed
with the science. That is very typical of the distortions presented throughout the SA article.  
http://yhoo.it/1ehf9oQ


 
I would very much encourage you to stick with facts and not rely too much on agenda driven B.S. from the
likes of Teri Buhl and Pump Terminator.


 
Happy investing.

Ah yes, "painting the mice". Here's the answer to the claim "They're researchers! They have PhD.'s! They would

Most of the "research" for NNVC has come from Krishna Menon, who lied about his Harvard doctorate, inventing
drugs for Eli Lilly, and God knows what else.

People read the SEC quarterly filings and annual reports. If you don't understand them, don't invest. Read "The

>>THINK & Do the math. <<


This is classic "Wolf of Wallstreet" pump and dump. You are being taken to the cleaners: NNVC) Acquisition In
Review" claims that an anonymous source informed the author that an unidentified entity is "intent on acquiring
NanoViricides" and that this phantom entity valued the Company "between 2.5 to 4.5 billion dollars".


The author has not contacted any of the Company's executives prior to this posting, nor has Seeking Alpha attempted
to verify any portion of the story with the Company.


The Company has no knowledge of being an acquisition target, and has not had any discussions whatsoever of such
nature with any parties. Eugene Seymour, MD, MPH, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of NanoViricides, said
"We find it odd that Seeking Alpha would publish one story claiming the Company has no value and a second
claiming that it is about to be acquired for possibly up to $4.5B."


The Company provides information regarding its achievements, major corporate events, as well as business strategy,
via its press releases, the quarterly and annual reports, and other SEC filings such as the current reports. The
Company advises our investors and shareholders to obtain their information from these authentic sources, and
perform due diligence based on credible and authoritative sources. The Company further advises our shareholders
and investors that they should not rely on false and baseless statements from unknown and phantom entities, such as
this post, as well as the prior post by an admitted short seller, both published on the Seeking Alpha website. The
Company has filed an action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York to compel Seeking Alpha to disclose the
identity of the person who wrote and published a defamatory, malicious, and libelous article about the Company on
February 11, 2014, on the Seeking Alpha website, as previously reported.

NNVC has been verified long ago not to be scam, cheat or fiddle of a company. Scientific reference books have
explained and delineated the fundamentals and legitimacy of NNVC therapeutic advancements (ref - CRC publication
Bionanotechnology II ISBN -10: 143980463X).


Institutional investors have made review and purchased shares after having demonstrated acceptance to the
NYSE/AMEX. (Ref - Vanguard, Goldman Sacks, Deutsche Bank, et.al.)

Working within the pharmaceutical industry protocols to perform in vitro and later, animal testing, prior to human
phases, NNVC has been documented to have had excellent success in both. (Ref – H5N1 & Rabies at the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi, Ebola studies with the United States Army Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Epidemic Kerato-Conjunctivitis EKC, anti-Herpes clinical study with THEVAC and Herpes Simplex Virus
HSV with Dr. Rosenthal at NEOMED, anti-HIV therapeutics testing with the University of California in addition to
KARD Scientific, Dengue Fever tests with Dr. Eva Harris at the University of California, Berkeley, et.al)


The majority of all testing has reported excellent efficacy against the viral types targeted, with no apparent toxicity
issues. In proceeding with the normal course of new drug development the FDA granted a pre-IND meeting, which
upon being held gave guidance for facility and testing requirements to proceed to first human phase testing. After
much effort, NNVC is currently finalizing the facility and preparing for such testing. The FDA and the European
medical agencies were also impressed enough to grant NNVC’s Denque Fever anti-viral an orphan drug designation.


The Chair Professor of Ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine, and a Director of the Company, was asked why
he invested a total of $7M ($7,000,000.00 USD) in NNVC during the 2013 calendar year. His answer was, “As I
became familiar with the technology and the various on-going programs that the Company has, it became apparent
that the potential was nothing short of amazing”.


It is possible that as a director, he could have some bias, but it is the writer’s understanding that he was originally
made aware of the company by a family member that was impressed by the testing she was doing on one of the
company’s anti-viral compounds. The point however, is that this well respected doctor, doctors and institutions in other
countries, Dr. Harris, Dr. Rosenthal, as well as others, including financial institutions like Vanguard and Goldman,
including the FDA, find NNVC credible and worthy of note and respect due. 
It is in the writer’s opinion, that if some person, or group puts forth the suggestion that NNVC is a company built upon
a scam or a fraud, or is a ‘snake oil’ stock, that their statements or actions are more apt to be based on deceitful
ulterior motives designed to promulgate their own scam or fraud, however large or small, than based on the reality of
the company or its technology.


It is the writer’s opinion that from a developmental company standpoint and from an industry comparative and
historical perspective, NNVC has shown good stewardship of funding by achieving excellent efficacy results for the
total invested dollar value to date. It would also be naïve of the writer to assume no missteps have been made and/or
clear skies lie ahead. Like all companies, NNVC has been presented with its own set of corporate, technical, business
and legal issues. Some likely brought about by their own mistakes or imperfect actions while others made by the
assortment of those outside with their own agendas, good or bad. So far though, NNVC appears to have managed
their funds effectively to be on the doorsteps of human trials of a potential game changing anti-viral therapeutic
product. For that they should be commended.


It is important for all investors to do their own due diligence. It is best to avoid tendencies blindly follow or blindly
assume accuracy and legitimacy of positive or negative commentary. It is also critical to understand one’s risk level
and beware of misinformation. Recognize that not all misinformation is intentional, while other cases are indeed
malicious and/or manipulative in nature.


The writer currently maintains a small equity position in NNVC common stock and as such could be suspected of
bias. While not in the medical or pharmaceutical field, a background in science and engineering, including chemical
process R&D experience, has been of immense help to the writer in recognizing true technical merit in areas
investigated over the last 30+ years. It is a humble opinion that NNVC has a valuable new therapeutic platform and

would be a loss to humanity if it were to ultimately be unsuccessful. It is also a humble opinion that NNVC will have
headwinds by the relentless capability of the business and investing world to put forth a nearly endless list of
obstacles to almost any endeavor, regardless of the underlying technology, worth, or legitimacy. All said and
considered, it is the writer’s opinion NNVC is BUY in the speculative biotech equity category.

I assume you in league helped plant this attack. Or are you just some wonderful Good Samaritan policing all
the stock markets in the US to question any and all bear raid attack pieces. If so thanks ever so much looked
for your up listing when the new saints were posted last weekend by the Vatican. Missed your name!

Tempest in a tea cup. Look at the power pointer sensation on the company's web site.
