Citron reviews some amazing facts about regional bank
International Bancshares (NASDAQ:IBOC).


On Wednesday IBOC announced a “strong quarter” in a
Press Release that came out right in the middle of a
strong day for the market without any prior notice. If you
were looking for the conference call…look again. They
seem to be the only public bank in their region that will
not talk to investors. If you were looking for a balance sheet….look again. They are the
only bank in their region who gives you just a headline without a balance sheet in the
PR. Instead, management offers the blanket statement, “We are confident in the
strength of our balance sheet and especially the quality of our loan portfolio”


You’d have to be a hermit not to know that banks from coast to coast are under stress.
Why? Because they all got caught up in making very bad loans during the “bumper
crop” of bad paper originated during 2005 to 2007. If many wrote down the value of the
loans on their books to reflect current market realities, they would be insolvent.

The Competition


Citron reminds readers that IBOC’s book of commercial and construction loans, the two
largest sources of pending delinquencies, doubled during the go-go period of 2005 to
2007. With nearly 1.4 billion in real estate and construction loans classified as “maturing
within one year”, Citron marvels at how IBOC’s glowing report yesterday can possibly
square with reality.


Influential banking analyst Meredith Whitney commented last week, “Commercial real
estate will decline ‘hard and fast,’" on Bloomberg Television.


For a lot of the regional banks that have so much commercial real estate exposure as
a percentage of their core capital levels, it’s going to be more difficult.


But according to IBOC management, they’ve got an immunity card.


While every other bank who accepted TARP money is selling stock to repay the
government and beef up its balance sheet, IBOC has decided to buy stock to combat
short sellers while still holding TARP money. Funny, if they are so pleased with their
construction loans from the boom years, they why not return the public’s TARP money
— after all it does stand for Troubled Assets Relief Program.


While IBOC’s PR gives short shrift to its loan losses, here’s what competitors are saying
about the Texas market:


From Zion Bank this week:


The Company recognized an impairment loss on goodwill during the first quarter of
2009 of $634.0 million or $5.55 per diluted share compared to $353.8 million
during the fourth quarter of 2008. The first quarter impairment loss was at Amegy
Bank of Texas, which has $616 million of goodwill remaining after this impairment.
This loss primarily reflects declines in market values of peer banks in Texas and
a weaker economic outlook in that state.


And ….

What’s under the covers? Citron reviews IBOC’s loans of record


The most significant driver of the loss we experienced this quarter was the non-
cash impairment of goodwill of nearly $634 million. All of this relates to our 2005
acquisition of Amegy Bank of Texas. The impairment charge primarily reflects
declines in market values of peer banks in Texas and the weak economic
outlook in that state with the decline in energy prices that we’ve seen in
recent months.


From Cullen/Frost: (who refused TARP money)


As expected, Texas is not immune to the effects of the broader U.S. recession.
The state’s overall economy is slowing, impacted by weaknesses in the job
market, lowered rig counts and reduced exports linked to Mexico’s economic
problems. Although our non-performing asset levels have been impacted by
the recent slowdown in the Texas economy, we remain confident in our ability
to manage credit quality. Cullen/Frost is well positioned to navigate through difficult
times, as our executive team was with the company during the 1980s.


The other Texas regional banks Cullen/Frost Bank, First Financial, Sterling, and Texas
Capital all reported this week, accompanied by consistently cautious conference call
comments from management, and analyst downgrades. Oh, but we forgot …. IBOC
doesn’t have analyst coverage, and doesn’t do conference calls.


Citron cannot fathom how IBOC expects investors to believe its current bad loan
reserves are sufficient to match the scope of its problem loans. Specifically, from 2007 to
2008, non-accrual loans and 90 day past due loans increased 213% from $54 million to
$170 million. During the same period the allowance only rose 19% from $61.7 million to
$73.5 million. The allowance as a percent of non-accrual and past due declined from
114% to 43%, and astounding decline. If the allowance had stayed at 114%, pretax
earnings would have been 60% lower.


To try to gain more clarity on its loan portfolio, Citron looked at some of IBOC’s largest
financing chunks, as much as we were able to gather from public sources.


The Spring — $ 70 million financing by IBOC, nearing construction completion. 
Current status: Our best estimate, only 50% sold with 10% deposits.

One of Austin’s first luxury high-rise condo projects is nearing completion.  


How’s the market now? Citron notes that next week Austin will see an auction of condos
in a luxury project now estimated to fetch 40% of their planned sales price through
auction.


To the Dallas Fed, the Austin market looks like this:


“Conditions in the Austin real estate market remain weak, as they do across the
state,” said D’Ann Petersen, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallasin a recent Statesman article. “The national recession has trickled down to
Texas and the state, and its major metros are seeing job losses. The credit
situation has also impacted the real estate sector in Austin, especially the higher-
priced segment.”


But not to IBOC.


Barton Place (.pdf):  
This one, due for completion in early 2010, is just 40% sold with 10% deposits.


Astroworld: 
This loan, to redevelop a 104 acre site formerly a Six Flags amusement park site next to
the Houston Astrodome, was proudly announced as a “major” deal for IBOC. The
purchase price was $77 million, presumably mostly with money borrowed from IBOC.
Two years later, its just a vacant site with weeds growing up through the pavement.


Sapphire: 
This South Padre Island project, just opened, we can not figure out occupancy here but
we have to imagine with the devaluation of the peso along with the violence in Mexico,
any border town might suffering, unless its an IBOC financed-project, of course.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.


Citron estimates these 4 projects alone account for perhaps 20% to 25% of IBOC’s
construction loan book. If the company would host a conference call and field questions
openly, perhaps some genuine transparency on this troubled book of business could be
established. Meanwhile, it appears to Citron that IBOC’s $70 million loan loss reserve is
insufficient to cover the liability of these 4 imperiled projects. That’s before we even
begin to consider the overhang of the rest of their $1.8 billion real estate / construction
portfolio, which itself is just an outsize portion of its $5 billion plus loan portfolio.


Conclusion


There is a complete disconnect between IBOC management’s rosy portrayal of
conditions and objective data points about IBOC’s financings outstanding. While its
competitors all speak cautiously about the slowing Texas economy, IBOC insists
everything is great, but offers no transparency whatsoever into its loan portfolio.


Citron notes IBOC’s exposure to construction loans is more than twice its competitors,
its gross yield from loans is well higher than its competitors (indicating riskier loans
when originated) and its reserves are the lowest of its peers.


Meanwhile, the company threatens to buy back stock from “different” pools of money
than the TARP dollars it has taken.


It is Citron’s opinion that the day of reckoning for this bank is only a matter of time. 
Cautious investing to all.
