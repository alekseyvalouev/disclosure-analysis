Chinese RTOs: What Can Investors Buy When Even 'Big Four'
Auditors Fail?
Mar. 31, 2011 6:54 AM ET60 comments
by: Alfred Little


On March 29  China MediaExpress Holdings (NASDAQ: CCME) filed an 8-K (here) that
included a detailed list of reasons why its auditor, Deloitte, resigned.


Deloitte’s concerns included:


Authenticity of bank statements
Suspicious circumstances surrounding bank balance confirmation procedures
Validity of certain advertising agents/customers and bus operators
Possible undisclosed bank accounts and bank loans
Subsidiaries shown in SAIC filings are inconsistent with management’s
representations
Validity of a sampling of tax invoices from certain large transactions
Subsidiary tax payments to the SAT could not be verified
Cash salaries to certain employee bank accounts could not be verified
Production process of advertising programs could not be verified
Potential double counting of a certain number of buses


Most of Deloitte’s Concerns Share a Common Thread: “Paper”


Bank statements, confirmation letters and contracts of all types, government filings,
ownership certificates and tax invoices are all paper documents easily forged by dishonest
management with the help of a few dishonest bank and government officials. The
consequences of getting “caught” are nil, since Chinese law offers no protections for
foreign investors in legally unenforceable variable interest entity (VIE) management
contracts used by companies such as CCME and OTCPK:CBEH. Dishonest management
can keep turning paper into gold until investors decide the “paper” evidence of profits and
growth are contradicted by the reality of the business.


Foreign investors are clearly in a very poor position to perform on-the-ground analysis of
business fundamentals. Even China-based investors have to be willing to spend
considerable time and resources to verify whether a business is real. For example, the
due diligence report (summary here) on CBEH prepared by the International Financial
Research & Analysis Group (IFRA) took a team of analysts six months to create and cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars. IFRA investigators went to the source to obtain

independent audit and tax reports. Field agents spent months observing and
photographing CBEH’s biodiesel factories. Videographers created time-lapse films
showing the lack of any production. Technical experts evaluated the production process. A
team of analysts called and met with CBEH’s suppliers, competitors and technical
partners. Certainly CBEH’s auditor, KPMG, did none of this type of tangible due diligence
(other than the year-end physical inventory count) before they signed off on CBEH’s 2010
financials.


As shown in this astonishing surveillance video, even a group of Rodman & Renshaw
investors who took the time and expense to visit CBEH’s factory were easily fooled by
management that simply staged production activity that day. Dozens of additional
surveillance videos (see the same link) showed that prior to the Rodman investor visit the
factory was not producing any biodiesel at all, despite management repeatedly publicly
claiming the factory was operating at 100% of capacity.


What Can Investors Buy When Even "Big Four" Auditors Fail?


Assuming then that the audit opinion, even from a “Big Four” cannot be relied upon, what
can investors do? First of all, absolutely avoid buying companies exhibiting more than one
or two of the following 12 warning signs:


1. Reverse mergers with high short interest
2. Management misappropriation of funds to related parties
3. Unnecessary dilutive share issuances when the company has excess cash or


production capacity
4. Amazing revenue and earnings growth relative to peers
5. Drastic divergence between financials filed with the U.S. SEC and Chinese regulators
6. Weak balance sheet with large receivables relative to sales and unwillingness to


disclose customer, distributor or supplier details
7. Large growth by acquisitions that appear unusually accretive
8. Weak governance indicated by high CFO and auditor turnover and lack of involvement


of truly independent directors
9. Past involvement of unscrupulous stock promoters


10. Huge cash and shares fees paid to investment banks and other middlemen
11. Wildly promotional press releases or frequent press releases
12. Company provides very detailed financial guidance and always meets it

Second, even if a target investment passes these tests, then an investor still needs to
perform at least a reasonable amount of tangible due diligence. Clearly most investors do
not have the capacity to conduct time-lapse video surveillance of a company’s factory.
Nevertheless, they should at least seek to “piggyback” on investigations performed by
those who can afford the due diligence expense.


Unfortunately, in the last year even the most sophisticated investors such as the Carlyle
Group have stepped on landmines. In fact I am unable to give even one example of a
successful “piggyback” investment in the last few years, since the whole space is
apparently riddled with fraudulent companies.


Fortunately, large China-based investors appear to be rethinking their due diligence efforts
and are more willing to engage the services of intensive researchers such as Kroll, IFRA,
Business Connect China or China Whys. This is a lengthy process and U.S. investors
should be patient, watching for hints of the first good “piggyback” opportunities as they will
likely emerge on sites like Geoinvesting and Seeking Alpha.


I continue to be confident that eventually there will be some very good buying
opportunities once the majority of the fraudulent companies are exposed over the next
several months.


Disclosure: I am short OTCPK:CBEH.

Point 6: 
Weak balance sheet with large receivables relative to sales and unwillingness to disclose customer, distributor or
supplier details


I can imagine that companies don't want to disclose customer, distributor or supplier details because of competitive
reasons.


But the reality is that most industries have enough consultants and cross-hiring of employees that competitors know
how well a company's various product lines or divisions are running.

Your video footage is a weak editing attempt. You have nothing that is credible. All of your words/edited videos are
heresay to instil fear in investors who are not on the ground in China.


Reveal you true identity like a true journalist and stop pumping lies and misleading twisted articles to benefit your
short position.


You are truely shameless. You are nobody. You are simply riding the wave of shorting the sector of the moment.

I guess it won't be long before KPMG starts doing what Deloitte performed did on CCME. It's a shame how KPMG
and Deloitte signed off on these obvious frauds in the first place.


#12 is my favorite - how magically all these companies can show incredible growth and always meet their strict
"make-good" targets or earnings guidance is unimaginable. I guess retail pumpers on SA will say it's part of the China
miracle. CBEH and CCME are best examples of these. It's incredible how they kept reporting incredible margins and
growth, when the rest of the industry and stronger competitors are losing money or having a tough time.


If your kids are into magic, you should get him to major in creative accounting in college, just like the CFOs of CCME
and CBEH.

The posted (by Alfred Little) videos of the CBEH biodiesel plant operations that came out this week are a sham. If you
pay close attention, you *can* spot large trucks and trains inside the plant - although typically only for a single short
video frame (that's why they are easily missed). The sampling rate of these posted videos makes this loss of
information possible.


For example:


vimeo.com/channels/cbe... Tongchuan 3-06-2011


There are definitely some trucks moving around inside the facility behind the gate between 00:39 (12:00 timestamp on
the video) and 00:43 (12:35 timestamp on the video). There is a quick shot of the front of a red truck cab at 01:01
(14:27 timestamp on the video). A large truck shows up around the same place at 01:17 (16:01 timestamp on the
video).


There are similar quick flashes of trucks in the March 9th footage in vimeo.com/channels/cbe... March 9-13 Investor
Tour Hoax. For example, at 01:36 (10:48 timestamp on the video) there is definitely a quick 1-frame shot of a large
truck in the same place behind the gate. There is another of a large red truck (same spot) at 01:43 (11:35 timestamp
on the video). Another large red truck at 01:46 (12:02 timestamp on the video). Another large truck right behind the
gate at 02:47 (16:06 timestamp on the video). etc.


You can also see some flashes of trains, they pass by to the left of HQ in videos that allow you to see that area.


For example: 
vimeo.com/21634517


At 00:43 (14:04 timestamp on the video) and 01:05 (16:18 timestamp on the video) you see trains leave the facility.

generous jack
thats right , I saw so many trucks that were"missed" by Alfred fraud ,and of course you would clean up before
the investors arrive, wouldn't you clean your home when you have guests? and is it possible the video's have
been recorded during the Chinese long holiday(dont trust the paper dates I can show a paper dated march
2000 today and claim that today is march 2000) , there are so many ways to fake a video , edit/cut things out
of the clip and what not , its not that difficult. 
sorry for bad english.

Well, the set of videos originally released by Alfred Little *were* from the 2nd week of the Chinese New Year
celebration. I don't think the videos are fabricated, or have incorrect date/time stamps - however, surely the
video sampling rate (which only keeps 1 frame per minute) can loses a lot of important information of what is
going on inside the facility. Here are my comments about the first set of videos:


OMG, I just took a look at some of Alfred Little's videos, and since I already knew about the Chinese New
Year celebration, which effectively shuts down the country for 2 weeks (this year it started on February 3rd), I
realized that's all he's filming w/ regards to Tongchuan - simply amazing! So, his videos of this CBEH
biodiesel production facility are probably authentic and dated correctly, but the misinterpretation that therefore
these facilities never generate any significant biodiesel is completely crap - since he only filmed Tongchuan
DURING the 2-week shutdown after the Chinese New Year! AMAZING. Of course, most non-Chinese
probably wouldn't realize this, and instead they think this is evidence of fraud.


Take a look at www.vimeo.com/channels... "Tongchuan 2-17-2011", starting 2:03 into the video (video
timestamp is 19:17) - you can clearly see FIREWORKS being set off! HA HA HA!!!! Simply friggin' amazing
that investors were taken by this complete BS.


So, this is a total friggin' joke. It is almost like it was engineered by the Chinese themselves, it is so funny (and
making fun of us non-Chinese, for not understanding their culture). Surely CBEH will now be able to
repurchase more of their shares as part of the $20M share repurchase program, now that the stock price is
lower! Stupid non-Chinese investors who were panicked into selling by this crap.

Good try. Based on CBEH's claimed 100,000k capacity, there should be a lot more than "a few" trucks when
the plant is running at 100% utilization. 100k/365 = 273.9 tons/day. 273.9/15 tons per truckload = 18 trucks
per day. That's how many trucks you need to transport out the biodiesel. Plus for every truck of biodiesel
produced, you need at least 18 trucks of raw materials. In total, there should be 36 truckload of stuff every
day. No doubt CBEH is a hoax, because we've seen only 4 trucks over the last 4 months. Plus not every truck
you saw counts, to transport biodiesel, you need tanker trucks.


Even the dumb Mr. Market is smart enough to figure out that (price -30%). Try to speak with some investors
who went on the March 10th tour, you will find out how disgusted they're about the way CBEH intentionally
deceive them. Even Rodman & Renshaw, their investment bank have ditched them now.

chris,


Don't you know about the multiple underground pipelines from suppliers and to customers they built a couple
of months ago? They are going to put out a PR on them any minute. They have been saving the news due to
the Chinese New Year holiday. They thought we celebrated it here, from FEB 1, to March 31. It's that cultural
difference thang.

Good try yourself. I know you work for a hedge fund - just exactly where do your interests lie w/ regards to
CBEH? Of course you are shorting them. 
Anyways, if you would like, I challenge you to go frame-by-frame through the March 2011 videos that Alfred
Little uploaded, and note exactly how many trucks you see (and how many are tanker trucks). Then after
you've done that, congratulations, you've just wasted all of that time - since all I need to prove is that the
videos are missing *some* of the important information, which they clearly are (because of the 1 frame per
minute sampling rate).


31 Mar 2011, 06:36 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
Nice try. Ask some investors who went on the March 10 tour. Management told them they transport pretty
much everything out with trucks.


Plus, doesn't look at you know anything about Chinese holiday. Check out CBEH Q4 earnings call transcript
on their own website, Susan Zhou said Chinese New Year ended on Feb 9. The video starts on Feb 10.

Author’s reply »  eremmel,


I checked each one of the instances you saw trucks. Yes, i see the trucks too. BUT, they are outside the gate!
The biodiesel plant is in the foreground. Outside the gate is a parking lot and street. On the other side of the
street is a cement plant. The trucks you saw were outside the gate, driving down the street or turning around
in the parking lot (the street is a dead end).


Furthermore, every time a truck or any vehicle enters the plant the guards open the gate. The gate never
opens during any of the scenes you selected.


Regarding trains, CBEH never uses trains to ship biodiesel or receive feedstock. I will publish some pics of
the "train station" today.

"Susan Zhou: Sean, I think you are asking about—the question is on  
the first generation 100,000 tons was shut down for maintenance. Actually, the maintenance was already
completed by the end of January this year. So, after January we have the traditional Chinese New Year
holiday, which is about a oneweek holiday. So, the plant is already back to full production on February 9, right
after the Chinese New Year"


Yeah, that discrepancy right there seems like a good reason to do a massive sell-off of this stock, right? I
don't think so.

My understanding is that the entire country of China shuts down for the 2 weeks following Chinese New Year.
I don't know the detail, since I'm not Chinese. But, surely you cannot point to that 2nd week of Chinese New
Year and expect that shows the level of production of CBEH biodiesel for the rest of the year. Anyways, the
videos are too lossy (1 frame per minute), they are missing important information. Nothing can be proven one
way or the other with such a loss of information.

Check out CBEH Q4 earnings call transcript on their own website, Susan Zhou said Chinese New Year ended
on Feb 9 and plant has been running at 100% capacity after that date. The video starts on Feb 10 showing

An SEC investigation in CBEH will be imminent.

With KPMG's resignation and looking back at the time when you made this comment about how everyone in
CBEH agreed with you, iI totally see your point about how the employees don't care at all about how long the
holiday was, since they were never asked to work at the idle factory.

I've got a prediction for you. 
You are going to bitch and bitch about CBEH for a few more weeks. 
Then the company will announce in a "shocking" statement that it needs to re-state earnings for 2008 - 2010. Then
the stock will be halted.


Then we will never hear from you again.


Remember who controls the whole China small-cap space.


It's not you. Your are just a pawn, and we use you for your $.


That's all.

I find it interesting that the author suggests that the Big 4 auditor failed. What leads you to that conclusion?


From what little I know about this situation, it seems that they did everything right, they identified that certain things
just didn't add up and refused to sign off on the financials. They went so far as to resign and forgo future revenues
from this client rather than risk signing off on financials that they were not comfortable with.


Actually, it must be really tough for an auditor to detect fraud when there is collusion among management. The fact
that Deloitte's team identified that something was amiss despite what appears to be a group of CCME employees
working to mislead them is particularly impressive.


This actually gives me much more confidence in financials that have been audited by a Big 4 firm, especially in China
now that we see that they are sufficiently doing their job and refusing to sign off when things don't add up.


By the description above, it doesn't look like Deloitte was overly relying on "paper". If they had, I'm not sure they
would have caught this. I see quite a few procedures above that suggest the opposite - that the auditor used bank

confirmations, salary tests and other such tasks to determine that something did not jive with what the paper
documents provided by the company.


I guess having a good auditor really does make a difference when it comes to being able to rely on a company's
financial statements.

Deloitte had to have Muddy Waters rub their noses in the fraud, before they could see it. They signed off on
the same fraud last year, for $523,000, and probably a lot more that we don't know about. They would have
done the same thing again, if MW hadn't blown the whistle. The SEC is watching now. Get it?

Auditors have a responsibility to be "Professionally Skeptical". When a company doesn't want you talking to
their bank, and only using their numbers, even to make a simple verification request, that's a good reason to
be skeptical.

eremmell, can you explain the employee count to me?


Even dubious China small-cap cos have a few thousand employees for $150MM - $250MM in rev.


What about the proven frauds? 
RINO had 400. CCME had a few hundred. CAGC has a few hundred.


Now, CBEH actually claims 3x the rev of many of these other POSs ($600MM in 2011) so I would guess they have
5,000 - 10,000 employees. Yes, "on paper" this company is 2 yrs away from being a billion dollar company.


Yet how many do they have? They only have 400 employees (& 82 are admin).


That's $1.5MM per employee. Aside from the richest of hedge funds, how many businesses in the world bring in
$1.5MM per employee? Now how many can do it in the 3rd world?

Bigbarry -


I don't know. Maybe you shorties are right about some of this. All I want is for this stock to go back up to $4 or
so, so I can take my gains. I thought I had bought CBEH near the bottom, since I bought after the initial
shortie attack (after CBEH responded with the open letter to shareholders) - I did do some dollar-cost-
averaging later, so it isn't as bad as that. Sure, these Chinese stocks are a gamble, I went into this knowing
that. *BUT* surely there is fraud in what these hedge funds are doing to manipulate the stock price.
Remember the first recent attack piece targeting CBEH said the company is 100% fraudulent - even the gas
stations. How could that possibly get past KPMG? Sorry, I don't believe that. According to
www.fixyou.co.uk/track... , CBEH looks like a pretty good investment (for a Chinese company) - with the
exception that it is under review (having announced an independent investigation) because of the recent
shortie attacks. Did the CEO need to respond to the initial shortie attack with the open letter to shareholders?
My guess is that he did so because he is generally an honest businessman and takes pride in what he has
built. In retrospect, it was a mistake because the detailed response gave the shorties more ammunition, like
they claimed that there is something in that letter that proves that CBEH engaged in undisclosed related party
transactions. The letter explicity states that they did not. 
So, I'm sick of the hypocrisy that these shorties and hedge funds are engaging in. Perhaps they think (in
some cases) that they are doing the right thing by trying to keep Chinese companies down so we can protect
American companies and American jobs, but the U.S. government gave that away to the big multi-national
corporations long ago...

I have a serious question that no one has answered to my satisfaction.


What makes Baidu, (BIDU) different from CCME?


In fact, the China internet giant Baidu should be more suspect in that they are under the protection of the Chinese
government, to the extent that the thugs that run China forced Baidu's only real competition Google out China.


If Big 4 auditors and major fund managers could not detect fraud in CCME for years then it is likely that Baidu or other
China business giants are also flat out frauds.


Why believe ANY Chinese company is real, particulary when the government itself is the final arbiter of the
paperwork?

JoTeng you are a devious shorty. Stop blaming Chinese companies, there have not been any cases of fraud
in China ever. This reverse pump and dump HAS TO STOP. The SEC is on your case.


You're way out of your league shorty.

Like I've always said, the RTOs are just the beginning. What sort of extra "protection" do investors have w/ IPOs?


Nothing. Bankers make a few due diligence calls to customers/suppliers but that's it. Everyone relies on the audit- it's
the only line of fraud protection. If Big 4 audits aren't reliable w/ these little guys who have simple businesses, how
reliable are they w/ big guys who have many more lines of business (and are much more time-consuming to check)
and much more $ at stake?


Props to any SA big dog who can take down one of the big Chinese companies.


31 Mar 2011, 10:17 PM


JoTeng
I must say this.


Six months ago I would have said this situation is overblown.


Now, I think it might be the tip of the iceberg.


In addition, if you run a major fund and are holding tens of millions or more in big name Chinese companies the
thought must be taking hold that you might not own what you think you own.


The next shoe to drop could very well be a company like Baidu or Alibaba.


If CBEH is garbage and CCME is garbage then maybe the very big plays are garbage too.


I have a feeling we are about to be treated to just such an allegation.


31 Mar 2011, 10:29 PM


JoTeng
One more question.


If you ran a major American or European company that is in direct competition with some of the major Chinese
companies would you not make it your business to find out if your competition is lying about the basic numbers it
reports?


You bet you would.

You would be crazy if you did not examine that possibilty in light of the massive fraud being uncovered daily.


31 Mar 2011, 10:36 PM


eremmell
I just might pay a hedge fund to run an attack campaign against them, something similar to what was just
done to CBEH. Or is that being paranoid? Hmmm....


31 Mar 2011, 10:50 PM


JoTeng
Im on a roll and I have one more point.


It would be quite a story if a scandal that started with RINO and a small cadre of shortselling sleuths ended with
SinoPec or China Mobile being unmasked as basically garbage on a huge scale.


31 Mar 2011, 10:40 PM


bigbarry
eremmell, 
Part of investing is understanding the environment you are in. Are we in a highly-monitored, well-regulated world with
a reliable legal system and minimal non-public information?


No, we are in the Wild West.


And to survive in the Wild West, you better be able to handle a few gun fights and shootouts. Otherwise, you'll get
wiped out.


My advice to you is to get out and never come back. You are in way over your head. Leave China to the big boys.


31 Mar 2011, 10:42 PM


eremmell
Look, I appreciate your desire to educate me, and you do have some good points. But, don't be so arrogant,
OK?


If I want to gamble my money on some Chinese stocks, that's my choice. You aren't necessarily going to have
more luck gambling than me. The "Wild West" analogy is a good one here, though. BUT ... it is somewhat
different in China I think. The Chinese govt. is pretty controlling. My opinion is that at the top of the Chinese
govt., they have a lot of engineers doing engineering of the country (including social engineering). They WILL
kick our butts with manufacturing solar technology. They will be cheaper. I suspect sometimes that we (U.S.)
may encourage (or at least not investigate/prohibit) these short seller attacks against China, as part of a
covert economic war against China - to help protect our own U.S.-built technology (like OUR solar technology
companies).


AND ... there are a number of fraudulent U.S. stocks as well. My favorite example at the moment is ZLCS.
Yes, it is a real company. Yes, it is bleeding cash, A LOT. Yes, its drug pipeline is crap, all early stage stuff and

not much of it. It is being pumped up, that's the only reason it trades above $2 currently.


So, to assume that all U.S. companies are less fraudulent than all Chinese companies is a big mistake, I
think. So, that's where the "Wild West" analogy fails.

eremmell, 
In the last paragraph, I was just being honest. I think you will end up losing everything if you continue to play. But
that's your choice. The more dumb money, the better for me.


In the wild west, do you really think you have a special ability to read press releases and made-up financials to give
you an edge? Do you have access to unique information in China (like the hedgies)? Plus, the hedgies can sway
public opinion. You can't. You are their pawn. You react to their information... and your behavior is predictable.


01 Apr 2011, 12:52 AM


eremmell
RE: CBEH, it is not as wild as you say. As long as they have KPMG, they inherit some of the reputation of that
auditor. Yes, the hedgies certainly can sway public opinion - but when they do this by spinning the facts into
lies, and pushing the stock price way down based on complete lies, eventually the truth will out and the stock
price will recover. If CBEH's independent investigation goes fine, and they keep their auditor KPMG, this stock
will be up to $4 in a couple of months. They can start their stock buy-back in mid-May.

This stock should be at least at $2.50. They auditors have to confirm that cash so why is it trading below that amount?


01 Apr 2011, 05:14 PM


bob22
The big 4 have to confirm that cash that these companies have in their account. They have 2.50 a share so who is
dumb enough to sell this stock for under what they have in cash?

I'm not. I just scooped up more today at $2.30/share. Target price: back up to $4/share in 2 months. Will hold
until the end of May.

"alfred little" hides his identity, information, contact address, etc. he is identical to Muddy Waters Research and is very
possible the same person.


muddywatersresearch.com is a website that was registered less than 10 months ago. A total sham setup for the sole
reason of taking a huge short position and then publishing fake research and paying to hide identity.


The owner registered the website through a company that BLOCKS THE REGISTERS NAME AND CONTACT
INFORMATION. The company specializes in sham companies with the purpose of ripping off consumers and other
illegal activities. Just google it.


Here is the company that is hiding his identity:

Alfred Little is doing a great service to investors. It would be GREAT if he would publish a list of all Chinese stocks
with a rating system. I wonder if the Chinese business community will wake up and hang a few shysters to protect
their markets ...

I agree that Alfred Little is doing a great service to the investment community by exposing the frauds in the Chinese
reverse merger space. He does it intelligently with facts and sound reasoning - unlike the incessant cheerleading from
most analysts, small cap PR companies like Redchip and from the exectives of the firms themselves. For those of us
who have professions outside of the financial industry, and cannot spend much time researching, he has been more
than helpful.


I noticed CAAS has a Big Four auditor too and was up Big today. Of course the financials were UNaudited.
Wondering if Al had any opinion on them. Seems like they are following the same template as many of the others
RTO frauds.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for the kind words King. Unfortunately I don't follow CAAS. I like to see a rally once in a
while, though!

I think after todays delisting of CCME the answer has become pretty obvious - do not invest in these stocks, don't
even day trade. You might get stuck and become an accidental long like me and lose a lot of money. I learned my
lesson.
