Pleading the fifth on China operations: Despite never 
appearing in the financial filings or being mentioned on conference 
calls, Jiangsu UTP Supply Chain is involved in almost every aspect of A.O. 
Smith’s China business. The relationship is public knowledge in China. 
UTP’s involvement spans the acquisition of raw materials, the hiring 
of labor, potentially co-owning factories, marketing, and most notably 
“accepting” inventory and financing AOS distributors. We estimate that 
UTP may be responsible for as much as 75% of AOS China sales. 


The UTP relationship has obscured China business 
performance and financial statements: The UTP 
partnership has allowed AOS to inflate gross margins and mask the 
actual China revenue slowdown through distributer-financed channel 
stuffing. We also believe that the irreconcilable capex, R&D and asset 
inventory accounts are being used as cookie jars to preserve the 
“integrity” of the financial statements while hiding UTP’s involvement. 
Our detailed distributor channel checks indicate China revenue will 
fall by as much as 21% in 2019 vs management’s claims of a 6-8% 
decline.


Is the cash really there? We believe that A.O. Smith does 
not actually have access to $539 mln that reportedly sits in China—
about 84% of the company’s total cash at yearend 2018. We have 
conducted dozens of interviews in China and believe that AOS may 
have used its cash for distributor loans to prop up sales. That would 
mean the money is in escrow and cannot be touched until loans 
are repaid. What’s more, distributor loans are at risk in a weakening 
market. Chinese distributors of AOS products—financially imperiled 
companies--are being financed at 18% to take AOS inventory, and 
many are holding six months of inventory. These companies are at 
risk of default—and AOS could be on the hook.


China headwinds are everywhere: In Q1, AOS reported a 
66% drop in Rest of World earnings due to China declines but said

the drop is temporary. We disagree. During China’s boom years, AOS 
benefited from selling a premium product at a mid to high price point 
through direct channels in Tier 1 cities. To offset numerous steel and 
rental price increases, AOS has continuously increased the price of 
its heaters, until the appliances reached a price point unobtainable 
for some of the original purchase base. The higher-priced product 
has been a particularly poor fit for Tier 2-4 cities, the next leg of 
AOS’s China growth strategy, and the price-sensitive online channel 
continues to take share from the direct channel. AOS has recently 
launched new products at their original price points, but these 
“startups” are just ramping up and will carry much lower margins for 
the foreseeable future. Distributors believe the new product releases 
are just a way to discount old stock and force new inventory into 
the channels. These product/channel challenges are presently being 
compounded by a weakening Chinese economy and the U.S.-China 
trade spat’s impact on selling an American-branded product in China. 


Limited U.S. organic growth, fundamental 
challenges on the horizon: Concurrent with a booming 
Chinese economy, AOS U.S. sales were boosted by a series of 
acquisitions in the water-purification space. We believe that AOS’s 
North American organic growth rate has averaged less than 5% over 
the last three years. Furthermore, this growth was underpinned by 
strong housing starts in recent years and, more importantly, a strong 
replacement cycle related to home sales prior to the financial crisis. 
We expect North American organic growth to shift down a gear, as 
housing starts have begun to show weakness, and the replacement 
cycle weakens over an extended period as it laps the financial crisis.


Accounting anomalies, sham acquisition and poor 
governance: Beyond the UTP-contrived Chinese financial 
statements, we highlight financial irregularities in other regions as 
well. Most notably, a rare “unfavorable” mark was given to AOS’s 
Indian operations by their local auditor. AOS is claiming in China 
a capital spend of twice the amount reported in the U.S., and a 
government official told us that AOS is investing in UTP’s new factory. 
Our research has also uncovered the undisclosed fact that AOS

was fleeced of $50 mln as a result of a 2010 acquisition in China. In 
addition to the potential concerns raised by the recent timely exit of 
AOS’s long time CFO, it’s worth noting that AOS’s ISS governance 
score is a 10, the worst possible score.


Crisis in Management Confidence Poises Stock for 
Significant Downside: We’re challenged to understand how 
investors with an appreciation for the breadth of Chinese operational 
and financial obfuscation can get comfortable investing with a 
management team that was either this in the dark or complicit. 
We anticipate the multiple of the stock to re-rate materially in the 
near term as a result of a crisis in confidence and expect that 2019 
revenues will eventually disappoint based on below-expectation 
results for China and U.S. water heaters.  We are short AOS and 
value the company at $22.68, a discount of 53% to the current share 
price, based on a 1.2x multiple of our estimated 2019 sales and an 
assessment that steady-state growth will be around 2%.

The Incompetence of A.O. Smith
It turns out that China is not the miracle market that AOS, a manufacturer 
of water heaters, boilers, and water-purification equipment, makes it out to 
be. Our extensive interviews in China show that AOS is hiding its slipping 
foothold in its biggest foreign market behind an undisclosed channel part-
ner. That partner, called Jiangsu UTP Supply Chain, helps AOS post target-
ed sales volumes by using liberal credit for distributors and high levels of 
inventory. UTP finances AOS distributors and builds inventory, apparently 
to meet AOS sales targets and hide deteriorating AOS margins. Our inter-
viewees told us that UTP even manages manufacturing processes at AOS, 
hires and pays AOS staff, procures raw materials, and cooperates in R&D. 
Local government officials in AOS China’s headquarters city of Nanjing 
told us that UTP and AOS are cooperating in building a new plant.


We believe that AOS underwrites UTP’s loans to distributors. Our inter-
views, credit reports on UTP and AOS China, and other evidence all sug-
gest that the cash the company has in China is being held as security 
against bad loans to UTP clients. That would mean that a significant por-
tion of AOS’s cash is stuck in China and at risk of being tapped to cover 
defaults. Yet AOS has disclosed nothing about the cash and never explained 
why a region accounting for 34% of company revenue needs to hold 84% of 
company cash.


The UTP relationship
The AOS relationship with UTP is widely known in the industry, and UTP 
talks about it openly.


From the UTP website: “Shanghai Hongjing Cold and 
Warm Equipment Company [a subsidiary of UTP] is 
master distributor for A.O. Smith in the Shanghai 
region.”


Investors should 
ask management 


why they have 
not disclosed 


their relationship 
with UTP 


despite its deep 
entanglement 


with all aspects 
of the business in 


China.

In an article posted in Today’s Headlines (Jinri Toutiao) on November 19, 
2018, the founder of UTP, Bai Yuanlong, was quoted as saying that, at a 
difficult time in his life, he met a person “who gave me enlightenment and 
help with rich life experience and wisdom when I was in a dilemma. He is 
the senior vice president of A.O. Smith, the president of China, Ding Wei.” 
Ding Wei1 responded in kind, heaping praise on Bai.2


A competitor confirmed the relationship and described UTP as a “tun-
huoshang” (吞货商 ), which translates as “stockpiler.” We believe AOS has 
been using the UTP relationship since 2015 to achieve growth in an in-
creasingly difficult market by pushing out more credit and incentive pay-
ments to distributors. 


Our interviews with UTP staff and with 19 AOS distributors described deep 
financial entanglements between the company and AOS, which appears to 
be UTP’s largest client and whose relationship is described by UTP staff as 
“more intimate” than the relationship with other clients. 


 ‣ UTP purchases AOS product at a discount of 10-15% and sells to 
AOS distributors, including some of its own subsidiaries. UTP does

not pay up front but pays AOS after the Tier 2 distributors pay UTP. 
Although the distributors pay before taking inventory, UTP remits 
the payments to AOS in arrears once a quarter. This practice could 
obviate the need to report UTP as a material customer, since UTP 
could be construed as a service partner simply warehousing inven-
tory for the distributors. We estimate that about 75% of AOS product 
in China goes through UTP.


 ‣ Distributors take about 10 days of inventory at a time and usually 
pay UTP rather than AOS. Since UTP settles with AOS once per quar-
ter, UTP receives a significant float from AOS apart from the financ-
ing that we believe AOS provides.


 ‣ UTP is obliged to take any inventory requested by AOS and cannot 
return goods, according to interviews. If the company is unable to 
sell the products on to distributors, it holds the inventory for the fol-
lowing quarter.


 ‣ UTP executives and distributors told us that UTP extends working 
capital to AOS distributors at 18% annualized. The loans generally 
have six-month terms but are repaid as distributors sell inventory 
then re-extended when they take on more—-usually on a cycle of 
between 10 days and six weeks. 


 ‣ UTP is the exclusive distributor for Shanghai and Shenzhen, the two 
biggest markets for AOS, as well as for four cities in Hebei Province. 


 ‣ We believe that AOS lends money to UTP at 2%, allowing UTP a 
16-point spread on loans.


 ‣ UTP is building a large factory to make environmental products in 
Nanjing. Zone officials in Nanjing told us that this factory is being 
built in cooperation with AOS. There is indirect evidence from finan-
cial statements that AOS may have helped pay for this factory.


 ‣ We believe that UTP cooperates with AOS in water filtration R&D 
and manufacturing. UTP subsidiaries sell AOS water filtration equip-
ment.


 ‣ UTP employs some of the AOS production workers to lower costs by 
paying lower benefits and decreasing fixed pay and increasing vari-
able pay to improve efficiency.

 ‣ UTP manages warehousing for AOS. 


 ‣ UTP and AOS operate on adjoining parcels of land in Nanjing.


 ‣ UTP procures raw materials, including steel, for AOS. 


 ‣ Through joint ventures, UTP operates online stores for AOS on 
Tmall, JD.com, and Vipshop, the largest online channels.


Our interviewees say that AOS embarked on the relationship with UTP in 
late 2014, and UTP became the AOS supply-chain partner in 2015, a histor-
ically poor year for China’s housing market. Qingdao Haier, which had an 
18% share of the water heater market, reported an 8% sales decline in 2015 
and a 19% drop in profit. But AOS reported 14% growth, with accelerating 
momentum. On the Q4 2014 call, CEO Ajita Rajendra said:


One final comment on China. The recent declines in the China stock 
market and value of the yuan are unprecedented. And we acknowl-
edge the concerns of the investment community surrounding our 
China business. While it is not our practice to discuss monthly re-
sults, recent trends might add some perspective given that the latest 
macro events in China materialized in mid-December. In local cur-
rency, the average of our daily shipments in January increased over

Since 2014, AOS guidance for China has become markedly less accurate.


In 2015, the first year of working with UTP, the company gave no guidance 
on China revenue. In 2016-18, China revenue has under-performed guid-
ance by an average of 4%. For the company’s revenue overall, results have

UTP cooperative joint venture?
In the same development zone where AOS has built its new environmental 
products factory, UTP’s subsidiary Jiangsu Senyuan Electric Co. Limited 
is building a large factory to manufacture air-purification equipment for 
the consumer market. Senyuan was founded in November 2016 and has no 
staff or headquarters, according to our checks. 


An official of the Nanjing High-Tech Development Zone, which has juris-
diction over both the AOS and UTP facilities, told us in a phone interview 
that AOS is “cooperating” on construction of the UTP facility. He said the 
new UTP factory would produce the AOS Chanitex brand and some AOS-
branded air-purification products.

On September 14, 2016, when the project was announced, China Energy 
Net reported that “The UTP air purifier production base project relies on 
the scientific research and industry strength of Jiangsu UTP and A.O. 
Smith to create an environmental protection industry technology research 
and development platform and achievements.”3


We note that UTP has no consumer products at all, and the company em-
phasizes that it has no own-branded products planned. Construction of 
such an enormous factory would be unlikely to be done to accommodate a 
new product line.


We believe that certain clues from AOS financial statements support the 
comments of the Nanjing government official. One is that, in 2017, finan-
cial records indicate that AOS China may have paid out a dividend worth 
¥409 mln ($60 mln), but AOS the parent shows no receipt of any such divi-
dend. 


In China, the company has publicly announced that it is investing $150 
mln in its new factory, while U.S. investors have been told that the cost 
is $65 mln.4 Meanwhile, the Chinese financial statements show increases 
in fixed assets well out of proportion to reported capital expenditures in

China. In fact, the value of long-lived assets in China—which specifically 
exclude cash--rose by $106.8 mln from 2015-2017, while reported China 
"capacity expansion" capex for those years was cumulatively $50 mln.


In 2018, the trend reversed, with capex of $13 mln for China but just $1.8 
mln in growth of long-lived assets.


The subsidiary that makes water and air filtration equipment, A.O. Smith 
(China) Environmental Products Co. Ltd., unlike the other three operat-
ing companies in China, is owned by a Hong Kong subsidiary. According 
to Hong Kong corporate records, the directors are former CFO John Kita, 
Senior Vice President Wilfridus Brouwer, Executive Vice President James 
Stern, and a Hong Kong resident named Michael Wong (黄恂武 ), whose 
name does not appear in A.O. Smith documents. If AOS is sharing rights to 
the environmental products business, we theorize it might be through this 
company.

Employment
UTP says that it employs workers on A.O. Smith’s behalf in order to better 
manage costs. Below is a job ad by UTP for AO Smith warehouse workers.


Distributor credit
UTP told us that it provides credit to AOS distributors at up to 18% annu-
alized. In order to provide those loans, UTP, which is cash-poor, needs to 
borrow. 


Via Chinese attorneys, we obtained financial statements that had been sub-
mitted to China’s tax bureau by UTP and AOS China. UTP has ¥1.43 bln in 
short-term debt. Chinese banks typically lend based on fixed-asset collat-
eral, but UTP has just ¥147 mln in fixed assets, making up only 10% of the 
short-term debt. Current liabilities exceed current assets. A lender would be 
discouraged by UTP's financials alone: UTP’s after-tax profit is insufficient 
to pay the interest on debt—even though that rate is artificially low. Based 
on our understanding of Chinese lending practices, we believe no bank 
would lend to UTP without extra guarantees or collateral.


So where does UTP get its loans? We think it’s from AOS. AOS may be 
providing an entrusted loan, meaning that AOS would extend the loan to 
UTP, or AOS may guarantee the loan by depositing cash in escrow. If AOS 
is providing distributor financing, AOS should make such a disclosure and 
report some of its China-located cash as restricted.

A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS)


Anne Stevenson-Yang   anne@jcapitalresearch.com    +1-860-391-6094
See final page for disclaimers. 


Here is the evidence: 


 ‣ From a credit report we obtained from the People’s Bank of China 
Credit Reference Center, we know that AOS, through A.O. (China) Wa-
ter Heater, has provided a third-party guarantee in the value of ¥2.1 
bln. A.O. Smith (China) Water Heater has net tangible fixed assets in 
the PRC of only ¥400 mln ($59 mln), an amount insufficient for the 
size of the guarantee, and we estimate net tangible fixed assets for 
AOS operating subsidiaries in China to be only ¥1.2 bln ($178 mln). 
A.O. Smith (China) Water Heater subsidiary does, however, have cash 
balances that would cover the guarantee. A bank would require AOS 
to deposit that cash to secure the guarantee. 


 ‣ UTP and AOS use the same banks and branches in Nanjing—the 
Bank of China Nanjing Branch, Huaxia Bank, and Everbright Bank. 
Everbright and Huaxia are relatively small banks, and the overlap of 
all three banking relationships is unusual. These banking relation-
ships would facilitate an entrusted loan.


 ‣ UTP financial statements show that the company is paying just 2% 
interest on its large loans. This is far below market rates, while, as 
we outlined above, a Chinese bank is unlikely to extend a loan to 
UTP at any rate.


 ‣ AOS earns well below market rates for its cash deposits, and UTP 
pays well below market rates for its loans. Those facts suggest that 
AOS is providing an entrusted loan to UTP at under 2% a year. To 
give an idea of this discount, China’s average corporate lending rate 
in Q2 2018 was 5.97%. Private companies inevitably pay more—
when they can get bank loans at all.


If AOS has provided credit to UTP at the rate visible on UTP’s books—2%-
-UTP could make a 16% spread on the lending. UTP executives say the 
company provides financing to AOS distributors to purchase inventory, and 
distributors confirm this. Of the 19 AOS distributors we interviewed, 65% 
purchased and borrowed from UTP. An executive of one of the AOS large 
distributors in northern China said his company can borrow tens of mil-
lions of Renminbi from UTP at one time.


We view these loans as extremely risky. Chinese distributors of consumer 
appliances tend to be small, thinly capitalized private companies with thin 
margins. When industries see downturns, as happened with steel trading 
in 2009-10, construction machinery in 2012-13, and many other industries,

the distributors frequently default. Defaults among steel traders nearly 
sank a number of banks and reached 40% in some regions. We think that 
defaults are a significant risk for AOS distributors.


AOS does not admit there is any problem with its cash. On the Q3 2015 
call, CFO Kita said: “You know a lot of the independents and the distribu-
tors that we have we get our cash up front. So really there isn't a whole 
bunch of AR type risk that we run in China.”


But even if the cash on account were not compromised, that is demonstra-
bly false. In 2016, AOS’s Chinese subsidiaries, with revenue of ¥6.76 bln, 
had receivables of ¥2 bln, or 30% of gross revenue. In 2018, receivables 
were ¥1.84 bln on ¥7.55 bln in revenue, or 24%. Why such large amounts 
of notes receivable if the company advocates a policy of advance payments?

Accounts for A.O. Smith (China) Water Heater show "notes" receivable of ¥1.06 
($158 mln), representing extended credit to customers. These notes receivable 
are triple the value of accounts receivable, which is highly unusual - normally 
trade receivables are much greater than notes receivable. But AOS does not 
quantifiably separate out these two asset sub-classes in its U.S. GAAP. 


The few times that analysts have asked management about the cash, man-
agement has seemed to dodge the question. Here is an exchange from the 
Q4 2015 call: 


Ryan Connors


I wanted to ask two different questions about China. One has to do 
with your cash position there, Ajita, and there has been some talk 
lately about, in light of all the issues, China reinstituting some of 
the capital controls, in particular clamping down on corporate prof-
its leaving the country. How does that impact your view of your 
cash position there? Are there enough investment opportunities in 
China, given the environment, or should we look at that as kind of 
stranded cash?


Ajita Rajendra


Why don't I give a general comment and then let John talk specifi-
cally about the cash. I was in China last week, and as you know, I 
go there very often. It's interesting that all of the talk that we hear 
about China in terms of the stock market and all of the things hap-

pening -- the people on the street, that is not even a topic of conver-
sation. They are looking at different drivers and different things.


I met with customers, I met with obviously a lot of people in our 
workforce. I had dinner with the ex-dean of the business school at 
Nanjing University. The focus and discussion are on very different 
topics. So things like this, they are not really -- it's not a topic of 
conversation within China. Specifically on stranded cash, obviously 
that topic wouldn't come up, but we don't have too many concerns 
about that. John, maybe you want to address it directly.


John Kita


Ryan, it's clearly one of the things they are talking about is capital 
controls. We have in the past -- we took out about $100 million out 
of China in 2014. We certainly have uses of cash in China. As we 
talked about, we’re going to be adding the water treatment and air 
purification plant. We're looking at opportunities, always, to expand 
our product lines, as we did with air purification and water treat-
ment both four or five years ago. So we will obviously continue to 
monitor the situation.


The hidden decline in China
We believe that AOS is hiding declining sales in China via its undisclosed 
relationship with UTP. AOS statements about sales in U.S. dollar versus 
Renminbi terms are confusing, perhaps intentionally so, as the company 
continually downplays poor sales results while trying to stay this side 
of market regulations on disclosure. AOS claimed sales improvement in 
China in 2018 in U.S. dollar terms and 3% decline in RMB terms, while our 
interviews indicate that sales booked by the Chinese companies fell by at 
least 5% and sales to end-users by at least 7%. Distributors are now carry-
ing double the normal level of inventory. We believe AOS is able to report 
sales growth only because of help from UTP.


A.O. Smith (China) Water Heater, by far the largest and most profitable sub-
sidiary in China, reported a gross sales decline of 8.62% in 2018 to Chinese 
authorities. From a different angle, given many inter-company transac-
tions, we estimate that, on a consolidated basis, AOS income in China 
declined by 5% in 2018 even after packing channels with inventory.


Q1 2019
In 2019, the channel stuffing that has enabled AOS to report growth is no 
longer working. AOS reported a truly awful quarter in Q1 but once again

told investors not to worry, AOS is completely in control. The facts contra-
dict their assurances.


AOS explained that the 18% fall in China sales in Q1 was due to a $50 mln 
build-up of inventory in Q1 2018. In other words, the lower sales in Q1 
reflected an exaggerated comparable. The company said inventory build in 
Q1 2019 amounted to $25 million, and so Q2 2019 sales would fall by $25 
mln. 


However, our distributor survey in Q1 2019 shows that the company is still 
carrying around two months of more inventory on average than normal. 
That translates to about $140 mln in excess inventory still in the system. 
Meanwhile, news reports say that inventory is building in the water heater 
industry and sales are in decline.5


AOS has been very careful not to say that inventory is back to normal. 
They claim that they are not certain how much inventory is in the chan-
nel—disingenuously, as we know that distributors are required to report 
inventory levels to AOS. 


Worse, AOS will launch more new products in China in 2019 than any

other year. Distributors have pointed out to us that new products are used 
to force them to take on new inventory in order to stock the new models. 


Sales levels are at the same level as 2016 now, and operating income from 
China has not been this low since 2012. Net margins have been com-
pressed to 5%, down from 12% in recent years. The company claims high 
fixed costs, but we believe that the main reason is that sales growth is in 
lower-margin products. We are not expecting margins to return to 12%.


The company appears to be completely in denial. “We expect improved per-
formance in China in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, 
but project lower China sales than in the same period in 2018 due to the 
second quarter 2018 inventory build,” Chuck Lauber, CFO-designate, said 
on the Q1 call.


 “We see more of a positive sign with some of the government possible 
stimulus packages and some of the other things that could help consumer 
demand if the tariff issue gets resolved,” CEO Kevin Wheeler said. 


“Our business model in China is solid for the long-term opportunity, and 
we continue to forecast low teen margins for the full year,” (Kevin Wheeler,

CFO John Kita6 announced his retirement at age 63 in January, just two 
weeks before the company announced its preliminary results for 2018 and 
for Q4. When the audited results came out on February 16, his departure 
seemed fortuitous.  


 ‣ The company projected China sales to decline by 7-10% in U.S. dollar 
terms in 2019. 


 ‣ China saw declines in profitability, employees, and number of exclu-
sive retail outlets.


 ‣ Long-lived China assets increased a mere $1.8 mln despite $13 mln 
in added capex, which, per the AOS definition excludes cash.


 ‣ The proportion of cash held in China rose from 72% to 84% of total 
company cash. This occurred even as AOS repatriated cash to repur-
chase stock and pay a dividend. Cash in the U.S. was left at $1 mln, 
which suggests a need to borrow heavily between reports.


2019 to be down 16-21% in China
AOS is forecasting that sales in Renminbi will fall 6-8% in 2019—more 
than the 3-6% drop forecast in Q4 2018. Our estimates show much worse 
performance. We believe sales of water heaters—by far the biggest catego-
ry--will fall by around 25%. AOS is losing market share in the growth mar-
kets of online and lower-tier cities. Our most conservative prediction for 
the overall sales decline is 16%, as the water purification products soften 
the fall. The sales decline could be as much as 21%, which would drag AOS 
top-line sales down 7% for the year.

Removing excess inventory will reduce AOS water heater sales by around 17%. 
We believe the real estate market will turn down this year by around 7-8%, 
dragging down water heater sales. Therefore, we expect sales of water heaters 
to fall 25%.


AOS has around 30 top-tier distributors and many more sub-distributors. 
We interviewed 19 of them. We conducted an in-depth survey of 12 dis-
tributors, which account for approximately 30% of AOS China sales. Survey 
respondents indicated that growth halved from around 23% in 2017 to 10% 
in 2018. However, these sales figures include the inventory build at the 
distributors. 


On average, distributors increased their inventory by two months, from 1.5 
months to 3.5 months. The distributors say that 1.5 months is normal. 


A.O. Smith has disclosed very little about normal levels of inventory in 
China, but on the Q2 2018 call, the company did disclose that “normal” 
inventories are as high as 85 days:7

what you said. Just curious, what is the normal level of inventory? 
Obviously, it's at least a month different than that. And would that 
be normalized? If you get it down 30 days, going into next year, 
if we have a similar rate of growth, call it, mid singles in local in 
China, would that be an adequate inventory reduction or would that 
require further inventory reduction next year?


Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp. I would tell you that that is 
going to be a move in the right direction. If we're close to where we 
want to be, we'd probably like to drive it down just a little bit more 
over time. But, again, moving to 30 days would get us right into the 
level that we think is appropriate going forward.


Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And you're mov-
ing it down to 30 days or you're moving it down by 30 days? I'm just 
trying to understand what's the normal level of inventory in the 
market?


Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp. I'm sorry. Moving it down by 
30 days.


Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC Down by 30. And what 
would that be then? That's like you end up with a quarter's worth of 
inventory? How big is the inventory normally?


John J. Kita - A. O. Smith Corp. That would be a little bit less than a 
quarter.


Kevin J. Wheeler - A. O. Smith Corp. Yeah, bit little less than a quar-
ter.


Larry T. De Maria - William Blair & Co. LLC Little less than a quar-
ter. That's great. Thank you.

kind of in the 70, 80, 85 range. (Bloomberg transcript Q2 2018, page

We believe the discrepancy is due to the UTP relationship. UTP takes in-
ventory on a quarterly basis and sells it to distributors (including its own 
subsidiaries). AOS may count UTP inventory as its “channel inventory.”


AOS claims it does not know precisely how much inventory is in the chan-

nel. We are curious, then, where more than $100 mln has gone that was 
spent on the company’s ERP. From conference calls, here is reported spend-
ing on the ERP, including incremental spending on a Chinese ERP. On the 
Q4 2013 call, CEO Rajendra said there would be about $10 mln in incre-
mental ERP capex for China (Seeking Alpha transcript page 8). But Kita 
had said that an acquired China ERP, called QAD, would be sufficient for 
some time: “But right now, China, when we sold EPC in 2011, we put QAD, 
a very good system, into China. And it can handle their growth for quite 
some time.” (Q4 2016 Bloomberg call transcript, page 6)


How UTP helped the optics in 2018
Excluding the inventory build, sales actually fell by 7% in 2018. AOS re-
ported China sales growing at 4%. The Chinese filings of AOS operations 
show sales falling by at least 5% in 2018. Using that number and factoring 
in the inventory build at the distributors, it is possible that actual sales fell 
more than the 7% indicated in our survey. 


A large Tier 1 city distributor, one of the top five distributors, said that 
sales fell sharply last year. The company said AOS adopted a sales strategy 
that would make AOS sales look like they were rising but would be bad 
for distributors. AOS stuffed channels, pushing UTP and, in turn, distribu-
tors, to take on more inventory than they needed, to hide the sales decline. 
Interviews indicate that this was achieved by providing higher rebates on 
sales volumes. UTP also reduced the interest rates it charges distributors 
for working-capital loans, and we believe that may have occurred at AOS’s 
direction, given that UTP is not able to return unsold inventory. Our inter-
views indicated that UTP does not undertake to pay for inventory it cannot 
sell but, in the case of unsold inventory, would plan to hold it for future 
sale.


We sent an investigator to attend a distributor conference in Nanjing. The 
meeting was open to those who professed interest in becoming AOS dis-
tributors. At that meeting, distributors complained about the sales targets 
and product cycle. The company gave them some relief by increasing the 
length of time during which the distributors meet their minimum purchas-
es and by calculating sales rebates quarterly instead of monthly. Distribu-

tors found these measures to be weak and continue to complain about high 
sales targets.


The UTP effect
By extending credit to distributors and inducing UTP to take on extra 
inventory, AOS was able to report sales growth in 2018. We believe that 
the cost to AOS for this visible boost to sales is a wobbly balance sheet and 
compromised cash.


Paying up for the price premium
One anomaly in the Chinese accounts is the line called “other income.” 
This mysterious line is holding up the net profit of A.O. Smith (China) Wa-
ter Products. Other income in 2018 was $39.7 mln.


Compromised cash
For many years, AOS accounts have contained a striking anomaly: a huge 
proportion of the company’s cash balances are kept in China, the only coun-
try in which AOS operates that has a non-convertible currency and a closed 
capital account. We believe the UTP relationship is key to this mystery. 


Cash balances in China exceed the proportion of Chinese revenue and profit 
in the company overall and have been rising even as Chinese sales growth 
has flattened. In 2013, when AOS reported 26% sales growth in China, the 
company had 49% of its cash and 27% of company sales in China. By 2018, 
when reported sales growth was 4%, the cash had risen to 84% of the total 
but sales to just 34%. This is true even as AOS dividended a chunk of cash 
out of China in 2018.


The cash balance is puzzling. Even if AOS were financing all of its sales, 
the typical six-week repayment cycle suggests that, for $1 bln in sales, AOS

would need to have just $125 mln on hand. We estimate that UTP handles 
very roughly 75% of AOS water heater sales, or ¥4.8 bln ($714 mln) as of 
2018. Distributors tell us they finance about half the inventory they take on. 
That math makes $539 mln look excessive. We think AOS may be hiding 
some of the losses by over-reporting capex. We think the company has over-
stated capex by around $10 mln.


If AOS really has $539 mln in unencumbered cash balances in China, then 
its financial managers are some of the dumbest on the planet. A.O. Smith 
(China) Water Heater, the main operating entity for AOS China, shows esti-
mated net interest earned on cash of 0.7%. AOS’s group of four Chinese oper-
ating companies is posting negative inflation-adjusted returns on its cash. 
Yet Chinese banks routinely hand out 4% in annual interest for 12-month 
deposits in wealth management products (WMPs). 


When AOS reports that its China cash is largely in “marketable securities,” 
we believe the company must mean WMPs. Chinese accounts show no mar-
ketable securities, contradicting the AOS 10K filings. This may confirm that 
marketable securities are in fact WMPs. But in 2018, bank WMPs of 92-day 
duration were yielding up to 7.72% annualized, with the average 12-month 
rate 4.74%, according to Finance Street on February 11, 2019.8 In 2016, when 
A.O. Smith (China) Water Heater earned 0.8% on its cash, banks were paying 
an average of 3.8% on the safer type of bank-issued WMPs, according to a 
report by the Bank Wealth Management Product Registration Management

Center.9 If the reason for the low interest rates is offsetting charges, then 
what do these charges relate to, and are they financial instruments that have 
been separately disclosed by AOS in its U.S. filings?


Before 2018, AOS had some excuse to keep money in China: the exchange 
rate was mostly appreciating, which boosted the potential value of Renminbi 
balances, and U.S. tax law made it advantageous to keep money offshore. 


But other companies had already gotten around prior tax penalties through 
income stripping—paying excessive amounts of (tax-free) interest on inter-
company loans--or entrusted loans. It is unusual that AOS did not use these 
routes and instead preferred to borrow money at a cost in the U.S. And most 
CFOs would have pushed the cash to a safer offshore tax haven, something 
that would have been easy given the ownership of the Chinese operating 
entities by Hong Kong and Barbados holding companies. At any rate, those 
excuses disappeared in 2018 after implementation of the “Tax Cuts & Jobs 
Act,” which made keeping balances offshore irrelevant.


Yet, by the end of 2018, AOS still had “substantially all” of its cash in China. 
Why? Expected capital expenditures in China do not come close to matching 
the scale of cash held in the PRC.

Margin decline
For years, high margins and high growth in China have driven AOS share 
price. Shares really began to take off from 2010-2017, when China revenue 
grew from 15% of the company total to 34%.


Until 2018, growth in China exceeded any other region by a factor.

A key driver of enthusiasm for AOS shares has been the superior gross 
margin in China. The idea is that higher gross margins will lead to higher 
profitability, as the operation scales up. The truth, however, has been that 
both gross and pre-tax net margins have compressed, even as the business 
has grown. Net margins are below those realized in the United States. We 
believe the falling net returns are a result of higher incentives provided to 
distributors to make sales volumes.


In the financial statements for A.O. Smith’s four operating companies in 
China that we obtained from Chinese attorneys for the years 2016-18, ap-
plying principles of consolidation, we see a 320 basis point deterioration in 
gross margin between 2017 and 2018, from 47.2% to 44%, and a decline in 
net margin from 16.6% to 12.8%. 


While reported gross margins in China are higher than in the U.S., net mar-
gins are considerably lower in the Chinese financial statements. Excluding 
mysterious “Other Income” and “Fair Value” changes in the Chinese state-
ments, which we believe are not related to the operating business, the 2018 
and 2017 pre-tax profit margin for consolidated Chinese accounts falls to a 
range of around 9% to 12%. The gap between higher gross and lower net 
margins signals to us that AOS is burying COGS below the line.


We believe that AOS gross margins are overstated by omitting distribution costs.

AOS is paying four times as much as key competitors for distribution ser-
vices. As the company’s price advantage in China erodes—as is now occur-
ring—that inefficiency will cost dearly.


AOS enjoys an average 50% premium in water heater ASP over its competi-
tors. But it also spends 30% of gross revenue on sales costs, compared with 
18% for Qingdao Haier and 11% for Midea. With a price around 50% high-
er, AOS is still outspending the competition by a factor of two to maintain 
that price point.


These Chinese companies have a much more sophisticated distribution, 
logistics, and after-sales service system than does AOS, with clearly lower 
costs. Cost of sales for Midea and Qingdao Haier includes Integrated Chan-
nel Services, meaning end customer delivery services to customers but not 
warehousing.10


UTP has helped AOS mask margin erosion in two ways: first, we think AOS 
lends to UTP at well below market rate. Second, our interviews indicate 
that AOS sells to UTP gross of rebates, which are likely booked as sales 
costs. AOS sales costs are unusually high. Consequently, AOS China shows 
unusually high gross but low net margins.


Water treatment
AOS is resting high hopes for future growth on expansion of its water-
treatment business, especially in China. But in this area, the company faces 
intense competition and does not enjoy a brand advantage. The growth in 
consumer-facing water treatment has dropped sharply, as reflected in the

decline in the growth of water treatment sales outlets from 14% in 2017 to 
1% in 2018.


The company has provided relatively little information about its water- and 
air-treatment businesses in China and has been vague about what products 
its new plant will produce and whether one of the old plants will be closed. 
We speculate that the reason for this vagueness is that AOS China in real-
ity is in an undisclosed cooperative venture with its silent partner, UTP.


The new China plant
In 2016, AOS reported that the China company had started construction 
of a new water-treatment and air purification facility in Nanjing, the city 
of its China headquarters. That facility was completed in May 2018. Total 
costs were estimated to be $65 mln when announced on the Q1 2016 call. 
The factory opened on May 18, 2018 and produces home and business wa-
ter- and air-purification equipment with an annual production capacity of 3 
mln units.11


A.O. Smith has acquired a large piece of land next to the new factory and, 
according to announcements by the Nanjing government, has committed 
to build a phase 2 facility. Chinese news reports claim that ¥960 mln ($143 
mln) has been committed to the facility—double the amount that AOS has 
reported. In fact, the AOS China website claims that $150 mln has been 
invested in the new factory since 2016.12

Non-AOS branded products
We think it possible that the new UTP plant may be intended to produce 
AOS products that are locally branded. AOS does design and sell products 
for the local market that are not AOS-branded and sells them through 
alternate channels. AOS stopped reporting separate sales for AOS-branded 
and non-branded products as of the start of 2014.13 On the Q3 2017 call, 
former CEO Akita Rajendra commented that the company has designed 
products and channels specifically for the China market:

So we literally designed some products which were very conducive 
for the Chinese market and fit the market needs in China and we 
are actually selling those products two different ways in China. We 
are selling them Lochinvar manufactured products, branded Loch-
invar in China through one set of distribution and then we are also 
manufacturing those products in China and selling them under the 
A. O. Smith brand name. So, we are -- and both those are being very 
successful. So if there is a change, it's that we recognized that there 
was a market for the non-condensing products, designed some prod-
ucts for the Chinese market and we brought them out there in the 
last 12, 15 months, and they have been very successful. So we are 
very happy about that. (Source: Q3 2017 Bloomberg conference call

Owned or leased?
Curiously, although the AOS plant became operational in May 2018, com-
pany filings simply stated that AOS continued to have six non-US manufac-
turing facilities, the same as 2015, 2016, and 2017. The main difference Is 
that, prior to 2018, the company explains three of these non-U.S. facilities 
were directly owned and three were leased, whereas in 2018, this changed 
to four directly owned and two leased facilities. One interpretation may be 
that the newly commissioned plant replaces a leased plant, but AOS has not 
disclosed the closing down of a leased facility in China.


Moreover, if the company owns at least some plants in China instead of 
leasing them all, it should also own the related land-use rights, which are 
typically classified as an intangible asset, not PPE. AOS US GAAP filings 
do not disclose land-use rights as an intangible asset.


Land-use rights in China have a similar structure to long-term leases but 
are not the same. The company owns the right to use the land.


Filings show the company classifies intangible assets outside goodwill as 
"other intangible assets." There is no sign of rights to land use.

AOS consistently overestimates the amount of capex its China operation 
will use. We speculate that China may overstate its capital needs in order 
to provide an excuse to hold onto its notional cash balances. In 2018, for 
example, AOS projected $30 mln in capital spending for China but, at year-
end, reported $13 mln in capital spending. That is typical. Total capex 
forecasting for China in 2015-2018 was $140 mln while actual spending 
was $69 mln, a variance of 51%. This variance is not likely explained by in-
corporating both maintenance and growth expenditures; we estimate AOS 
China' consolidated annual fixed asset depreciation--a typical proxy for 
maintenance capex - to be considerably less than this variance.


Retail: eating up excess inventory?
AOS company reports indicate $70-80 mln of store display assets in China. 
We believe that the number is vastly inflated. All the retail outlets selling 
AOS products in China are owned and operated by distributors, who are 
particularly emphatic that they buy the display inventory and AOS does 
not own it. What’s more, a lot of these store display assets are dummy shell 
displays rather than the more expensive fully working inventory.

Furthermore, we suspect that AOS maintains the number of retail outlets 
for the purpose of hiding fake assets. In our interviews, we learned that AOS 
China subsidizes the rent for many of the stores and pays the salaries of up 
to three salespeople. Those subsidies make it just barely worthwhile to oper-
ate a store. But distributors particularly dislike standalone AOS stores and 
claim they are good only for sales to friends and family. For bigger-ticket 
consumer appliances, as China's retail environment continues to modernize 
logistics and retail outlet efficiencies, a small stores approach under tradi-
tional "old ways" local sales channels is becoming less attractive.


AOS reports that it expenses about $40 mln a year on China store displays 
as part of advertising costs, specifically through "amortizing" them be-
tween 12 and 36 months. But that makes little sense.


 ‣ The term "amortization" is typically used for intangible assets, while 
depreciation is used for tangible assets. No explanation is provided 
as to why physical store displays could be "intangible" assets. AOS US 
GAAP filings show only patents and customer lists as amortizable 
intangible assets.


 ‣ As an advertising cost, these expenses are not categorized as inven-
tory cost of sales.

 ‣ There is no disclosure on whether these store displays were sold and 
therefore contributed to revenue. 


 ‣ If these store displays are part of fixed assets, we do not think they 
form an impressive part of AOS China capex expenditures, since the 
associated amortized expense must in scale cumulatively equate to 
their cost. If these store displays started out as inventory work in 
progress and later transferred to fixed assets, where is the disclosure 
referring to this non-cash flow inventory capitalization?


 ‣ If these assets were sold or given to distributors, we believe related 
cost should be fully expensed in the same year, not spread out over 
up to three years. If a car or a washing machine is sold to a con-
sumer, the seller's expense is booked in the year of sale, not over the 
subsequent life cycle of the sold item.


Assuming an average of two years’ shelf life for these store displays im-
plies a value of of around $70–80 mln. In the 2018 10-K, the company 
changed its amortization schedule to 12-36 months:

Old: “Included in total advertising costs are expenses associated 
with store displays for water heater, water treatment and air puri-
fication products in China that are amortized over 12 to 24 months 
which totalled $43.0 million, $37.0 million and $27.4 million during 
2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.” (2017 10-K page 33 )14


New: “Included in total advertising costs are expenses associated 
with store displays for water heater, water treatment and air puri-
fication products in China that are amortized over 12 to 36 months 
which totalled $38.7 million, $43.0 million and $37.0 million during 
2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.” (2018 10-K page 33)


We cannot find sufficient assets on the balance sheet of AOS entities in 
China to reasonably account for these store displays, as tangible, intangible 
assets, or other assets, for the remaining unamortized store display as-
sets. We know AOS supports the stores with subsidies, but those are likely 
included in sales costs. Furthermore, distributors are adamant that they 
purchase the displays themselves.


Excluding construction-in-progress, we estimate 2018 AOS China had net 
consolidated tangible fixed assets of some $180 mln and barely significant 
intangible assets of around $14 mln, which should primarily consist of 
manufacturing facilities and land-use rights, respectively. 


The risk is that AOS has invented these assets as a journal entry to smooth 
away inflated sales, or profit margins or at the very least inappropriately 
mischaracterized China store displays. This could also be a pocket in which 
to hide the write-down of unsold inventory. 


Why all the retail outlets?
Retail outlets are very inefficient and unlikely to be profitable. Based on 
the 9,000 outlets in China we estimate average sales per year of ¥860,000 
($128,250) or about 122 units. This could not possibly be profitable to oper-
ate. Store closures to prevent losses appear inevitable, but this will clearly 
impact marginal sales in what was supposed to be a high growth area for 
AOS and may further exacerbate overstocking at distributors.


We visited 15 retail outlets in Beijing, Tianjin and Chongqing. Only two 
had customers when we visited, at different times of the day. Our visits and 
interviews of retailers supports the very low levels of sales made at retail

outlets indicated in the reported results. 


The company claims that retail outlets provide it with staff available for 
after-sales installation and service. But the distributors who own the stores 
complain bitterly about being asked to carry these stores and say that they 
are inefficient.


Challenges in China
The water heater industry in China has seen its best days and now is in 
decline. We do not expect that to reverse.


AOS has referenced something called “ABC data” on the industry. We are 
not familiar with this data source. Competitors in China generally cite Eu-
romonitor. Qingdao Haier (600690 SH) reported in its 2018 AR: “The water 
heater industry recorded a decrease of 3.2% in retail volume and a growth 
of 0.5% in retail value in 2018.” The respected tech industry publication 
Zhongguancun Online, originally a subsidiary of CNET, reported that Chi-
nese water heater sales declined by 2.7% through October 2018.15


Channel Mix / Product Strategy
The markets that continue to see growth in China are low-tier cities and 
online channels, both much more price-sensitive than the well-to-do fami-
lies that are AOS’s traditional market, in Tier 1. A distributor told us in an 
interview that AOS performs badly in Tier 3 cities, where competitors, with 
lower-priced products, have better logistics and the same quality.

The chart clearly shows that the cheaper brands gained share and more 
expensive brands lost share. Midea, with a much lower average price than 
AOS, was the 2017 leader in online sales and in growth.


AOS said in its Q2 2018 call that the company is coming out with a new 
water heater product in China specifically for online sales, suggesting that 
it will be cheaper. On the Q3 2017 call, then-CEO Akita Rajendra said that 
the company has designed products specifically for China that go through 
a discrete distribution channel and are not sold under the A.O. Smith brand 
name.


In 2018, according to industry monitor TideJD.com, the much larger of-
fline market for hot water heaters declined by 0.9% while online sales grew 
25%.18 


The battle moves online
Water heater sales are growing in lower-tier cities,19 but AOS is losing mar-
ket share there to cheaper domestic competitors. In the company’s presen-
tations executives give share only in Tier 1, offline markets and say that

share is growing.20


AOS stopped disclosing its online sales in China in 2018, but a March 1, 
2019 analyst presentation provided an estimate.21 Online sales are now 
28% of AOS China sales.


In fact, in 2018, as reported by AOS, total China sales increased by $36 
mln, but online sales in China increased by $50 mln, based on the March 
1 presentation. Whatever the reason for the anomaly, it is clear that the 
growth for AOS now comes from online sales.


Giving up on direct sales
In 2017, without mentioning any change to investors, AOS handed its 
online sales business to a new joint venture called Nanjing Hesiman Net-
work Technology Co. Ltd that was formed by AOS’s top eight distributors. 
According to five interviews with Heisman staff, AOS online is Hesiman’s 
only business. UTP owns 10% of the company through a subsidiary and is 
the second-largest shareholder after the AOS distributor Nanhua Group. 
Online sales are of lower-end, cheap products with lower margins. Ding 
Wei, head of China, said during the November 5, 2018 investor day confer-
ence that products sell online for about 30% less than for the category as 
a whole. “The e-commerce on average is selling 30% lower the category-
wise. Not us, just category average price. E-commerce is 30% lower than 
offline.”22


Because AOS does not disclose details, we must rely on Chinese news, the 
listed shop owners on sites like TMall and JD.com, and Chinese corporate 
registration records. “In 2017, A.O. Smith made a bold new gesture,” said a 
January 18, 2018 article in the industry publication Tianxia23 ”to promote 
the formation of a joint venture by core agents. The core e-commerce busi-
ness was all handed to agents. In other words, the online operation, sales, 
and the entire after-sales service were all handled by the agent.” The ar-
ticle adds that AOS moved two-thirds of the staff of its online sales depart-
ment into this venture and out of AOS.

The Chanitex brand and AOS China Environmental Products
Perhaps the only enduring asset AOS acquired in its 2009 acquisition of 
Tianlong Holding Co. Ltd. is a brand of water-purification products under 
the name Chanitex. 


Chanitex, sold through dedicated franchise outlets, does about ¥120 mln 
($17.9 mln) in sales. AOS-branded water purification equipment, on the other 
hand, does more than $350 mln in sales, according to our interviews and 
company reports. Chanitex has 180 distributors and 400 stores nationwide. 
Chinatex sales grew at 37% in 2017, but growth fell to 10-15% in 2018.

We find the reported water treatment sales puzzling. Chinese domestic 
financial reports do not support the claim of $400 mln in 2018 revenue; 
the environmental products company reported $158 mln in gross sales in 
2018. In any case, the water- and air-purification products are far less prof-
itable than the water heaters—they are just wasting capital.


AOS began disclosing sales for the water treatment business worldwide 
only in 2016, when the company acquired Aquasana. In previous years, 
there have been revenue disclosures for China only.

Weakening End Market
We identify two phases of China’s water heater market and, consequently, 
AOS China growth: 2007-2014 and 2015-present. AOS was able to take ad-
vantage of the exploding sales of new real estate in the post-2009 stimulus 
and to garner a premium price for its products in this breakneck market 
that had little regard for cost. But the real estate market cratered in 2015, 
as the government tried to restrain credit growth. 


China went through a high-growth period in sales of water heaters 2007-
2012, in tandem with the real estate boom. But by the second sales boom, 
in 2016-17, water heater sales had petered out, and China’s became a re-
placement market.


AOS has roughly a 37% share of China’s electric water heater market, accord-
ing to China Market Monitor. It has a 28% market share of water heaters over-
all in terms of revenue and 18% in terms of volume, reflecting the company’s 
price premium.25 Chinese statistics differ in reporting market share of the top 
10 brands of water heaters, depending on whether they report by number of 
units sold or revenue and whether they include all water heaters or just elec-
tric heaters—which represent about 57% of the total water heater market and 
in which AOS is dominant. Different statistics organizations report that AOS

has from a 23%26 to a 32%27 share of water heaters overall. The one thing they 
agree on is that AOS is losing market share in lower-tier cities and online. The 
chief competitors are good brands selling at lower price points: Haier, Midea, 
Gree, Whirlpool, and Macro. It appears that China’s market is less willing now 
to pay a premium for an American brand than it was a few years ago.

A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS)

See final page for disclaimers. 


Trade War Implications
AOS provides very little information on inter-segment sales. We know from 
conference calls that the company exports some boilers from China to the U.S. 
The A.O. Smith (China) Water Products Co. Ltd. subsidiary is very likely dedi-
cated to inter-segment sales (the company records no sales costs), but a sig-
nificant portion probably go to the water heater company, which has a higher 
income tax base than Water Products. If we believe that half of the company’s 
¥1.5 bln ($220 mln) in 2018 sales were for export to the United States, tariffs 
of 25% would make those sales uncompetitive, and AOS would like turn the 
company to serving the China market exclusively. AOS does not import sig-
nificant components to China. It imports some from India.


A more qualitative but probably more significant impact of the trade war will 
be damage to the AOS brand in China. AOS products are clearly branded as 
American, using the English letters A.O. in the logo, and this has been an 
advantage for many years. That tide is turning.


Fundamental US Challenges
AOS acquisitions in water purification have temporarily improved the growth 
profile, but in this area, AOS is wading into a brutally competitive field in 
which margins are declining.


For water heaters, AOS has enjoyed a robust U.S. market for new home con-
struction that brought organic growth to 7% in 2017 and 6% in 2018, by our 
calculation.


A.O. Smith sales correlate with nothing as closely as new housing starts, and 
the company has enjoyed two bumper years for starts in the United States. 
That run now appears to be ending.

Now, market expectations are consistently outstripping performance of 
housing construction.


The company faces another headwind: the sales declines of the financial 
crisis will translate into a slower replacement cycle now that a decade has 
passed. Water heaters are generally replaced every 10 years or so. The cri-
sis years of 2009-10 make for difficult base sales to lap.


Accounting and Governance Concerns
In order to repurchase stock and pay a dividend, AOS repatriated $312 mln 
in cash in 2018. Based on information from the 10-K and AOS China fil-
ings, out of the $312 mln in foreign repatriated cash in 2018, some $134 
mln came from China and $178 mln came from non-China foreign subsid-
iaries.

there is a $55 mln discrepancy based off changes in China-reported re-

The U.S. 10K shows some $72 mln of marketable securities were net re-
deemed in 2018, however Chinese filings show only $17 mln of cash was

China Sham Acquisition
AOS appears to have been fleeced of $50 mln in China in 2010 by a couple 
who persuaded them to buy rights to transact with nine loosely affiliated 
companies, falsified financial statements, over charged egregiously, per-
suaded AOS to wire the cash to a newly established account in Hong Kong, 
then ran away with the money. The scandal involved a Chinese admiral 
named Wang Chaoliang, who was alleged28 to have taken ¥15 mln in bribes 
to help the couple steal A.O. Smith’s money. The couple has been sued mul-

tiple times in China and Hong Kong, and the wife, named Lu Xueyan, was 
arrested in Shanghai. But AOS never took an impairment on the $82.7 mln 
that it paid for the nine-company confederation that was called Tianlong.


Zhang and Lu appear to be genuine criminals. The judgement29 in A.O. 
Smith’s lawsuit against Zhang, heard in Hong Kong in 2012, shows that 
Zhang operated under three pseudonyms and flaunted a court injunction 
in order to transfer assets to his daughter. A court case in Anhui30 in 2014 
revealed that Lu had paid to have a false ID created.


A former AOS executive involved with the acquisition told us that Tianlong 
had misrepresented its sales to AOS and actually had less than half the 
sales claimed.


The only hint of trouble given in the company filings was a statement say-
ing a $5.7 million fixed future payment for the acquisition was not paid due 
to breaches of representations and warranties - far less than the amount 
that was bilked from AOS. In another classic case of accounting window-
dressing, company filings state this unpaid amount was recognized as a 
gain as part of a settlement with the former owner.


AOS had announced its acquisition of 80% of Tianlong in the autumn of 
2009. In 2010, the company acquired the 20% balance and recorded a bar-
gain purchase (negative goodwill). Rather than write down the 80% value 
of the company to reflect the lower price paid for the remaining 20%, there 
was effectively an uplift in the value for the 20% based on the price paid 
for the 80% the year before. That is a technically legal accounting fudge.

The accounting fudge machine soon kicks into action again, because sub-
sequent goodwill evaluations are based on the whole reporting unit that 
the acquisition was incorporated into and not just the acquisition itself. 
Consequently, as long as the goodwill evaluation for the water business as 
a whole still adds up to recorded value, there is no goodwill write-down. 


When it was consolidated at the time of the 80% purchase, there were no 
meaningful additions to gross PPE at cost to reflect any tangible assets (See 
page 27 of the 2009 10k). On a best-case scenario, AOS paid up for a manu-
facturing license, some business contacts, and not much else. AOS estab-
lished a company in Shanghai, Shanghai Water Treatment or SWT, to hold 
the Tianlong assets.


The 10k statement for the Tianlong acquisition appears odd:


"The company acquired an 80 percent interest in SWT the business at a 
total cost of $76.7 million............ As required under ASC 805 the company 
recorded 100% of the fair value of the assets and liabilities as of the date 
of acquisition, with the 20 percent noncontrolling interest recorded in the 
equity section of the company’s balance sheet. The acquisition value ex-
ceeded the fair value of the assets acquired by $90.6 million, of which $55.4

million was recorded as goodwill and $42.2 million was recorded as intan-
gible assets in the Water Products segment."


The above statements are from the same paragraph on page 37 of the 2009 
10K. 


Note the statement above refers to "acquisition" value and not "consolidat-
ed" fair value. If the acquisition value exceeded the fair value of acquired 
assets by $90.6 mln, this must be all goodwill, and not $55.4 mln goodwill 
plus $42.2 mln in intangible assets; Where is the tangible PPE? And Does 
$90.6 mln in excess of fair/book value on a price paid of $70.6 mln mean 
that Tianlong had negative net fair/book value? The company's poor phras-
ing is misleading and provides little confidence in its representations. 


A more sensible interpretation Is that the $90.6 mln excess to fair value re-
fers to the full 100% of consolidated net assets, not the acquired 80% inter-
est, and that the excess to fair value Is represented by goodwill only of $55.4 
mln, not $90.6 mln. Using the more sensible interpretation suggests the 
remaining net fair value of assets excluding goodwill and Intangibles was 
only $5.3 mln - not much considering this was meant to be the acquisition 
of a manufacturing operation.


Rest of World Issues
AOS sales growth in Rest of World ex-China is puzzling, and the company

The chart does not account for inter-company sales. Consolidation brings 
growth in ROW ex-China in 2018 down from 26% to 21%.


In 2011, the company changed its reporting segments to North America 
and Rest of World. But outside the United States, only Canada has signifi-
cant volumes of business. Since Canada is now included in “North Amer-
ica,” we question where growth in Rest of World ex China might come 
from—it’s not Europe, India, Mexico, Vietnam, or Turkey.


There is reason to question AOS cash balances, not just in China but in oth-
er foreign operations. Cash held in non-China foreign subsidiaries is far in 
excess of the scale of these non-China foreign operations, relative to sales, 
long-lived assets, and almost certainly earnings. It is hard to see how this 
foreign group could generate such cash or justify having it. 


China makes up the great majority of foreign operations ex-China, foreign 
operations sales amount to just 9% of the AOS total. “Other foreign” sales 
appear to have come mostly from Mexico, as India sales were about $34 
mln in 2018, (2018 10-K, page 18). Europe, the Mideast, Hong Kong, Tur-
key, and Vietnam combined were less than $18 mln (“less than 6% of Rest 
of World Sales,” 2018 10-K page 4). If Mexico accounted for the balance, 
sales there would have been $68.9 mln.


AOS does not break out profit by region, but we know that most non-China 
foreign operations are loss-making or not making much money. Yet cash 
held by non-China foreign subsidiaries exceeded revenue there in 2013 and

was still 86% of revenue in 2017, before the company repatriated a portion of 
the cash. That means the non-China foreign operations cannot be generating 
enough cash flow to create this stock of money. AOS could be moving money 
to offshore tax havens, likely to Hong Kong to secure loans to China. We also 
think it possible that some of the cash balances are either partly fiction and/
or used as undisclosed collateral for third party financing.


India
One of the mysteries of the AOS business is why the company has such a 
fabulous China business in water heaters and can’t get any traction in In-
dia, when the markets are arguably very similar. India sales have averaged 
only 2% of the Rest of World Segment since 2014 and topped out at 4% of 
ROW in 2011-12. The explosion in Chinese housing construction accounts 
for the difference in volume of sales but not really for the difference in 
margins; the India business consistently loses money.


We believe that losses are worse than reported and that AOS has overstat-
ed its India capex to bury those losses. 


Auditors said AOS’s fixed-asset accounting was inadequate.


Disclosures on capital plant roughly line up with the company’s reports 
to its Indian auditors. But they do not line up with our investigations. We 
have reason to doubt that disclosure. So do the Indian auditors. In the most 
recent filing, AOS’ India auditors recorded an “unfavorable” remark on the 
fixed assets.


AOS has reported about $35 mln in net capex spend to its Indian auditors. 
We believe that AOS has overstated its capital expenditures in India by 
between $7-10 mln.

We estimate that AOS spent a total of just about $8 mln on its plant near 
Bangalore.


 ‣ Press releases indicate that the company acquired around 20 acres 
(871,000 square feet) of land in Harohalli. In the first phase, the plant 
built covered 76,000 square feet, and in the second phase, 150,000 
square feet were added.31


 ‣ Our interviews with real estate agents and industrial zone officials 
in India indicate that the land cost would be about INR 14 mln per 
acre translating into and investment of INR 280 mln ($4 mln) for 20 
acres of land. It appears that the company paid less. Indian financial 
statements for FY18 indicate that AOS paid INR 132 mln ($1.9 mln) 
for the land in 2009. 


 ‣ The normal cost of construction currently is around INR1,000 
($14.45) per square foot. Assuming higher-end construction for 50% 
more, we estimate the cost of constructing the factory INR339 mln 
($4.9 mln). The cost of construction five years earlier would have

been substantially less. 


 ‣ The company’s Indian financial statements for 2017 give a 2016 
value for the machinery of INR10.8 mln ($156,000). Assuming it was 
purchased seven years previously, walking back depreciation, which 
is over 10 years in the Indian statements, we estimate that the equip-
ment cost INR100 mln, or $1.5 mln.


In total: $1.9 mln for land, $4.9 mln for plant construction, and $1.5 mln for 
equipment, totaling $8.3 mln.


We met with a retired Indian auditor, who told us that the unfavourable 
comment on the AOS financials was highly unusual. It was also the first 
time this unfavorable remark was reported.


The 2017 audit report also shows undisclosed on-going tax disputes and 
many inter-company transactions, especially between India and China.


Indian distribution
AOS established a sales office in India in 2008 and began manufacturing 
water heaters there in 2010 and water treatment products in 2015. The 
company has consistently expressed hope for growth and profitability but 
reported losses. 


India seems consistently to miss its revenue targets. The business was 
promised to be a revenue driver for the parent. The India business clocked 
$20 mln in revenue in 2012 but was at just $26 mln in 2017.


Governance Issues
We believe AOS reporting problems are violations of SEC rules.


FASB and SEC Reporting Violations
1. Failure to separately disclose land use rights and/or correctly catego-


rize them as intangible assets

AOS does not separately disclose its China land use rIghts or show them 
in its intangible assets. This is clearly required by FASB Accounting Stan-
dards Codification 805 (ASC 805) and ASC 350.


2. Failure to distinguish between different types of receivables in either 
the balance sheet or cash flow statement


Regulation S-X Rule 5-02, Balance Sheets says receivables must be sepa-
rately stated for:


(1) customers (trade);


(2) related parties (see§ 210.4- 0S(k));


(3) underwriters, promoters, and employees (other than related parties) 
which arose in other than the ordinary course of business; and


(4) others.


And goes on to say:


“(b) If the aggregate amount of notes receivable exceeds 10 percent of the 
aggregate amount of receivables, the above information shall be set forth 
separately, in the balance sheet or in a note thereto, for accounts receivable 
and notes receivable.”


AOS China, with notes receivable in excess of 24% of total receivables, is 
clearly in violation of this rule.


3. Failure to disclose restrictions on foreign cash balances (FASB SEC 
Regulation S-X Rule 5-02

of 1 indicates lower governance risk, while a 10 indicates higher gover-
nance risk.”32


We concur. Company accounts are replete with incomplete and inconsistent 
disclosures. Just a few examples:


 ‣ Operating cash flow numbers show that the U.S. had to borrow cash to 
help finance its dividend, buybacks, capex, and acquisitions, despite ap-
parent strong operating cash generation from the U.S. business.


 ‣ There were large divergences between foreign earnings before tax 
and foreign operating cash flow in 2017 and 2014.


 ‣ There is a $55 mln discrepancy between non-China foreign cash re-
patriated and retained profits in the Chinese subsidiaries.


 ‣ It is very odd to have virtually zero cash in the substantially large 
and apparently profitable U.S. business consistently at the end of ev-
ery year.


 ‣ Cash held in non-China foreign subsidiaries is far in excess of the 
scale of these non-China foreign operation.


 ‣ The U.S. 10-K shows some $72 mln of marketable securities were net 
redeemed in 2018, however China filings show only $17 mln cash 
was net redeemed.


 ‣ There is a clear discrepancy between notes receivable in the consoli-
dated China Chinese filings and the AOS 10K filings.


 ‣ For reconciliations between the balance sheet changes and cash flow 
statement expenditures, there is very little consistency in capital 
expenditure/acquisitions.


 ‣ The $27 mln increase in China long-lived assets in 2016 makes no 
sense if only $13 mln was spent on China capex in that year. Like-
wise, in 2017 China long-lived assets rose by $66.5 mln, yet China 
capex was reported in 2017 at $24 mln. 


 ‣ The MD&A statements for capex are not consistent at all compared 
with actual capex numbers shown in financial statements.

 ‣ The intangibles section of the 10-K contains no land use rIghts. Does 
the company own China land-use rights or not?


We could go on. Suffice it to say that the AOS accounts are riddled with 
contradictions and omissions.


One aspect of AOS’s poor governance is the randomness with which the 
company compensates its China president. In 2018, modified Ding Wei’s 
compensation by adding a fourth component of “China Margin.” They don’t 
provide the specific targets, but claim he hit 76.2% of the combined China 
goals. It seems outlandish that this can be the case, in light of the China 
sales growth they projected for 2018 to investors of 13% vs. 2% actual. 


So sales growth came in at about 15% of plan (revenue shortfall ~$100 
mln) but Ding got paid on 76% of the target.


2017 Proxy


For Mr. Ding, we used three components to calculate his annual incentive: 
Return on Equity of 21.53% and two business unit performance objectives. 
Forty percent (40%) of Mr. Ding’s incentive opportunity is based on China’s 
performance with respect to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), 
thirty percent (30%) on China sales and thirty percent (30%) on Return on 
Equity as described above.


2018 Proxy


For Mr. Ding, we used four components to calculate his annual incentive: 
Return on Equity of 24.58% and three business unit performance objec-
tives. Mr. Ding’s incentive opportunity is based twenty percent (20%) on 
China earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), twenty percent (20%) on 
China margin, thirty percent (30%) on China sales and thirty percent (30%) 
on Return on Equity as described above.


We reported record earnings in 2018 and achieved 110.5% of the corporate 
Return on Equity incentive bonus target and 76.2% of the combined China 
EBIT, China sales, China margin and corporate Return on Equity targets. 
Accordingly, the named executive officers were awarded incentive compen-
sation bonuses set forth in the table below. In addition, the PCC may award 
discretionary bonuses it deems appropriate. The PCC approved a discretion-
ary bonus of $100,000 to Mr. Kita in recognition of his individual efforts in 
implementing a corporate restructuring

From the Initial 2018 Guidance:


“We believe China will grow about 13% for the full year. If you adjust for 
the $20 million pull-in in quarter four, this is a 17% year-over-year growth 
rate.”


<Q - Mike P. Halloran> : So, just an easy quick one. The 13% China growth, 
is that a constant currency number?


<A - John J. Kita>:  We said that's U.S. dollars and we expect the currency 
to be flat or maybe RMB, maybe a little bit stronger year-over-year


Actual China Results:


“Sales in China grew four percent in 2018. Excluding the impact of the 
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese currency, our sales in 
China increased almost two percent in 2018.”


Valuation
AOS’s acquisitions have been made at around 2x sales. These businesses, 
when acquired, were growing much faster than the overall business. They 
are about 10% of total sales. But 90% of the business is NOT growing 
anywhere near as fast. We estimate that, as a whole, AOS revenues might 
grow 2% in the long run. AOS’s current company multiple is 2.5x--much 
too high.


Overall, we believe that AOS management is weak and fails to plan for 
emerging challenges or opportunities, instead choosing to sweep problems 
under the rug. We therefore estimate that, based on a 1.2x multiple of 2019 
estimated sales of $3.12 bln, the company’s shares are worth $22.68, a 
discount to current price of 53%. We choose the lower end of the multiples 
because we believe shareholders will discount based on dismal disclosure 
standards and what is either dishonesty or incompetence.


Questions for management
We encourage investors to make management explain some of the yawn-
ing discrepancies between reported results and realities on the ground. 
Here are a few questions we have:


 ‣ Why has AOS not disclosed its relationship with UTP?


 ‣ Why does AOS keep so much money in China? Do you have plans to 
repatriate that cash? Why or why not?


Has AOS invested 
in a project with 


UTP without 
informing 
investors?

 ‣ What is the “other income” of $39 million?


 ‣ Has AOS invested in UTP in any way? 


 ‣ Did AOS pay out a $60 mln dividend from its China companies in 
2017?


 ‣ Why does AOS have so much cash in non-China foreign subsidiaries, 
when those appear to be generating very little cash flow?
