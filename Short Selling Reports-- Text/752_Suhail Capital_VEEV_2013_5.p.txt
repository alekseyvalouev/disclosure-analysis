-Frankenstein, 1931


We have over the past two weeks received quite a few inquiries from fellow investors
regarding Veeva's (NYSE:VEEV) Life Sciences CRM addressable market. What has
surprised us is that one particular analysis put out there by one of the underwriters has
gotten so much attention. This analysis is highly quantitative which we guess is why it is
has received a good degree of interest. Ironically, when we read it, our first impression
was that this was the work of a mathematician gone mad.


Just take a look...


A Bottom-Up Approach


Another way to size the market is to simply see how many potential customers Veeva can
secure, and apply an average annual recurring revenue figure. It is important to note that
currently most customers are only using the CRM product, so this analysis only refers to
the CRM market. We have used the company's most recent reported quarterly data, which
was FQ2 2014. The company reported $49.5 million in total revenue, with $34 million in
subscription (or recurring) revenue. The company also disclosed that it had two 10%
customers in Novartis and Eli Lilly. Exhibit 4 highlights our assumptions for total available
market.


First, we back out the two large 10% customers, which get's us to $27 million in recurring
revenue. Annualized, this works out to be $108 million. Veeva disclosed that it had more
than 170 customers.


We assume that 75% of the revenue will come from only 15% of Veeva's largest
customers. The other 25% should come from smaller customers, which make up
approximately 85% of Veeva's customer base.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1907191-veeva-mad-science-and-train-wreck-ipos 2/7


We then do the math and deduce that for the largest customers, the average annual
recurring revenue (NYSE:ARR) per customer is $2.4 million. For the smaller customers,
we get an average ARR of just less than $200,000 per year in ARR.


Using market data, there are approximately 23,000 Life Sciences companies worldwide.
We conservatively assume that Veeva can eventually secure a 20% market share in this
market. That gives us 3,450 potential customers. We note that given the vertical-specific
nature of the company's products, this market-share assumption could turn out to be quite
low.


Applying the $2.4 million ARR to the top 15% of those gives us a TAM of $1.6 billion.
Applying the $200,000 ARR to the other 85% gives us an additional $775 million TAM, for
a total of $2.4 billion for the company's CRM product.


Should this analyst now take a crack at the Beal Conjecture?


Now our Takedown of this Nonsense


Worldwide pharmaceutical sales totaled $800-$850 billion in 2012 according to
Pharmaceutical Executive, Cegedim Strategic Data, IMS Health, The European
Federation of Pharmaceutica Industries and Associations, Marketline, and countless other
sources. (you can confirm the data here or here) The top 50 companies accounted for 70-
80% of those sales. Yes, 50 companies, it is called BIG PHARMA for a reason. These
same 50 companies are what everyone in LS CRM, including Veeva, use as their
addressable rep market.


"So for the base CRM product, when we think about the high end of the market, you
mentioned 500 companies. We measure in track, kind of the top 50 pharma companies.
So if you look across the top 50 global pharma companies, at all of their pharmaceutical
sales reps, we penetrated roughly one third of those users. " Matt Wallach, Veeva 3q CC


50 is 0.20% of 23,000. Applying this number to the mad genius analysis from above gets
you a global CRM life sciences TAM of $4.8 million. Now, our research indicates that there
are about 500-2,000 companies on planet earth with a drug to sell and at least one sales
person to sell it.(the more reliable number is closer to a 1,000, but we will be generous)
Applying this customer range to the underwriter's bottom-up analysis gets you to a CRM
life sciences TAM of $48-$240 million. Now we know based on actual Cegedim and Veeva
revenue numbers that the market is clearly bigger than that (closer to $700 million), but
that is not the point here. The mere fact that one of Veeva's own underwriters would try
and TAM the market this way shows how fundamentally flawed their understanding of the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1907191-veeva-mad-science-and-train-wreck-ipos 3/7


LS CRM market is. It also establishes conclusively that the vast majority of Veeva's
revenues are coming from 20-30 customers at most. Basically, the customer count
number is very misleading, and this is why they were so reluctant to break it out with
respect to CRM for the SEC. (also further evidence that the live CRM user number which
was disclosed at the Veeva User Conference four weeks before filing should have been in
the S-1)


Also, we'd like to point out that the Marketline report referenced in the S-1 by Veeva
doesn't agree with what they disclosed.


Here is their disclosure:


"According to MarketLine, in 2012, life sciences companies had combined global revenues
of approximately $1.6 trillion, and the industry is expected to grow at a compound annual
growth rate of approximately 6% per year through 2016." Veeva, S-1


Now, from the exact September 2012 Marketline report cited in the S-1:


"The global pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences industry grew by 6.8% in 2011
to reach a value of $1,107 billion. In 2016, the global pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life
sciences industry is forecast to have a value of $1,535.7 billion, an increase of 38.7%
since 2011."


So, they actually used the 2016 estimated market size as the 2012 actual size.
Furthermore, this Marketline report is only current as of 2011 for reported global life
sciences revenue. And we checked to make sure this is not just a citing error, as the more
current data from Marketline also doesn't agree. (i.e. they have the biotechnology market
only growing $10 billion from 2011) Though we are still trying to understand how $1.53
trillion gets rounded up $1.6 trillion, and at the same time a 6.8% cagr gets rounded down
to 6%.


You are probably thinking how could all of this be possible for a $6 billion dollar IPO. We
are thinking exactly the same thing. Maybe it's about time Jim Cramer tasks someone to
read 'those blogs' before dismissing them and saying "buy, buy, buy." Maybe it is also
about time that some of these underwriter's compliance departments take a look at this
'research' mess and pull these shameful reports.


Disclosure: I am short VEEV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

To get a more accurate estimate of the addressable market for Veeva's CRM product, you need to consider
biopharmaceutical companies with significant field operations (field sales to health care providers and payers as well
as field medical liaisons who do not sell but educate) vs. purely number of companies or their revenue. Size of field
operations is the key adoption driver of CRM base product. Generally, large biopharma companies have largest field
operations but there is variation based on whether they sell primary care or specialty products, etc. Historically,
smaller companies were loathe to invest in CRM because of high up-front cost until their operations had reached a
critical mass - expect that SaaS will increase CRM penetration since small companies can pay as they go. Believe the
best estimate of addressable CRM market would be based on number of field people (plus some additional for
headquarters staff to manage field interactions).

Author’s reply »  As we are invested in a slew of low cost/penetration saas stories and have basically laid this
argument in out in our original report as part of a shrinking pie/changing profile software pie vs. a consensus
view that continues to work off legacy on premise pie; we get that better than most. But reality is the asp
impact here dwarves the marginal penetration because of the existing high penetration in this segment. Add
in the industry budget constraints as well as the changing way in which drugs are sold, will pharma reps even
be around in decent numbers a decade from now?...and you should grasp why at $5billion this stock looks
grossly mispriced. Though we will concede that hiring someone like you to consult pre-ipo would have
probably made selling this story more compelling, and less filled with holes you could drive a truck through.
Fact of the matter is 42% of drugs sold on the planet are from 10 companies. The top 50 account for 75%. We
are 100% certain that there are not 23,000 life sciences companies engaged in commercial sale or
development of drugs. Based on extensive conversations and regulatory database reviews it is a fraction of
that. The broader life sciences definition also includes companies that enable the discovery/development
process. This means companies providing contract research services, clinical tools, clinical trial services,
instruments, consumables, supplies, etc.

Once again, I appreciate your work and insight regarding VEEV. It seems that others are finally beginning to take
notice of your initial extensive report. I imagine that many have conducted or are in the process of conducting their
own due diligence based on your thesis. As the VEEV "discovery" process gains mass, I expect the selling and
decline in VEEV's pps to accelerate.

Author’s reply »  When you spot such basic and glaring errors in an s-1, you have to wonder what everyone
here was thinking. These are not copy/paste mistakes. Someone made a conscious decision to inflate the
numbers and put them in this way despite the fact that they don't agree with the industry report they are being
attributed to. It's the same story with the addressable TAM, though as we have shown that requires just a little
bit more effort to disprove. This is what happens when an IPO comes along that everyone assumes can be
milked on the back of a 'story'.

Even Doctor Gloom and Boom (Faber) mentioned VEEV as a short. 
He was wrong most of the time recently, but he rarely does mention specific stocks to short.

I chuckled to myself when you referenced Kramer.. I remember hearing it live during his lightning round...
summarizing your entire short position with blogs are against it...I guess once you have the CEO of a company on for
an interview your not going to change your mind no matter what...


BTW.. i look at the product being based on Salesforce platform as a negative not a positive

Hey any chance you could work through your math for memore directly. It's probably my weak math skills, but I can't
seem to confirm any of your calculations.


For instance, if 75% of their $108 annualized revenue comes from 15% of their claimed 170 customers, isn't that
$81M from approximately 26 customers? This yields $3.11M per top customer not $2.4M. I have similar issues with
trying to actually corroborating the numbers you are quoting. I think your points are still valid, I just like to directly
confirm the numbers someone quotes like this.

Author’s reply »  That's not our math. That is the brilliant work of Wells Fargo's analyst jayson maynard. Why
doesn't it agree with your calculations? Who knows you will need to ask him. Though can't see why you would
waste your time as the point of us including this was to show just how fundamentally flawed it is. Pharma
seats are really concentrated amongst a few customers. The top 10 companies are probably 50% of the
seats. The top 20 probably get you 75-80%. That means roughly 90-100k seats are scattered amongst the
bottom 25 of the top 50 and probably no more than a few dozen other pharma names. The life sciences

company count is sub 5000 and probably closer to 2-3k. And the count and companies with approved drugs
and at least a rep to sell them is 10-20% of that. So what are u corroborating?


Here is what matters: Seat count, penetration at customer of available seats(implmentations take time), and
asp across the entire seat count because of the large differential between pricing in developed mkts and
em's.

Suhail Capital,


Well, I am corroborating the numbers you used in your post. I usually find that sloppiness undermines one's
argument, while accuracy strengthens it. If the precision of the analysis and presented calculations doesn't matter,
then there's not much point in including them.

Author’s reply »  Hence the whole purpose of this post. Guess you didn't get the reference to the analyst
solving beal conjecture statement. Everything under 'bottom up' till the Beal reference is lifted straight from
Wells Fargo's initiation report. Because its so quanititative it ends up attracting people like you who seek to
'validate' the numbers and understand the math, and hence scientifically proof their veeva investment in some
way. Reality though is that it is total garbage. This is the whole reason for the post as we were in fact
astounded at how many people contacted us seeking our take on the math in that one little paragraph, when
they should have literally been laughing at this work and sharing it with colleagues as a finance version of a
razzie award winner. It is in fact a classic example of what goes wrong when you make horrible assumptions.
What's amazing is how many exceptionally smart people spent a lot of time trying to grasp it. That in of itself
shows the power of mathematics and the willingness to assume that if something 'analytical' is in a sell-side
report it must be credible. Like we stated using the 23000 number from veeva's s-1 jumped out at us because
we know for a fact....literally down to the number....how many pharma reps there are at each of the top 50
pharma companies on the planet. See, it shows how poor the persons basic understanding of the space even
if that 23,000 number from the s-1 one was remotely right (we have conclusively shown it is an utter fraud of a
number). CRM is about having something to sell, and hence a salesforce. We knew, even before we looked
into how off the 23000 number was, that most pharma companies have no 'approved drugs' to sell. Hence the
immediate red flag of trying to use the 23000 number as a base for a crm TAM analysis. T put this in
perspective. A top 5 pharma can have anywhere between 18000-30000 reps. While a bottom 5 in the top 50
is between 1000-2000. These 50 companies are responsible for 80% or so of all global industry sales. Once
you exit the top 50 literally all the drug companies left on the planet probably don't even field a combined
sales force equal to two of the top ten names. Again, it's called "big pharma" for a reason.

To make it simpler, the error is not in the math itself, but in how the data and relative numbers are used.
