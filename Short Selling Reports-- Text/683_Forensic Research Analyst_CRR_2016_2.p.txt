CARBO Ceramics: Will You Take The Bait?
Mar. 18, 2016 7:00 AM ET12 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


Our updated analysis of the FracFocus database incontrovertibly demonstrates that
CRR’s largest remaining customers are moving away from ceramics to sand
completions.


CRR quietly busted a leverage covenant at the end of January and today is in near-
term danger of another covenant violation.


We believe that a near‐term dilutive equity raise can only buy a few more quarters of
further balance sheet runway and will only serve to delay the inevitable.


1-year target price for CRR is $6.00 per share, which reflects a 40% probability that
CRR fails this year and a 60% probability of a $10.00 per share equity raise.

I know CRR took a dive well before the oil market went down, from $150 to $50, so the trend was already established.
And now due to capex cuts, I heard O&G companies are using whatever is cheapest for frak sand. I think EMES and
HCLP see this in the market.


My only questions is if this could change if oil gets back above $60? Does their products have a place at all in this
market, if not, can they adapt?


Personally I hold SLCA, CRR, HCLP, and EMES and really just am betting on the sector to rebound when prices
stabilize but it would be nice to add more weight to the likely winner. From what I've read, that will be SLCA.

Don't the silica rules recently promulgated by OSHA/NIOSH bode well for ceramic proppants in the oilfield from a
safety and long-tail claim standpoint?

I thought they restructured the loans and were free of any potential covenant issues through 2017, no?

Apparently some people in the know think CRR will do just fine:

According to Scribed, this article was written by Daniel Shvartsman who just happens to be guess what?..... No, not a
hedge fund manager but an Editor at Seeking Alpha Pro since 2012! According to his SA bio, Daniel wrote articles for
SA prior to coming to work for them. I don't know how to do links but one can be found supporting this, among the
comments on Daniels most recent "piece of work" which sent Intrexon down 26% today, a fact which SA ballyhooed
earlier today in a self promoting blurb. The article may have been removed by Daniel because I cannot download it
from Scribed, getting a message that it has been "removed by the owner". However, other contributors maintain that it
is still up. I just know I can't get it any longer. Regardless, why Daniel have you not publicly revealed that you work for
SA and instead claim to be a,haha, hedge fund manager? Reminds me of another shorter, Bleeker Street
Investments, who turned out to be a college kid working alone out of his dorm room. Anyway, Daniel, tell us won't you,
how many others amongst your co-workers did you show this too before even submitting it to SA for "vetting" and
approval? That's a sweet seat you got there Daniel. SA promotes all your shorts and you get a paycheck. I'm sure you
must love that though I'm not sure that lawyers for the companies you've maligned, nor the SEC, will feel quite the
same.

You haven't commented about the deletion, which you should. Who deleted the XON piece from YOUR scribd
account, and why?
