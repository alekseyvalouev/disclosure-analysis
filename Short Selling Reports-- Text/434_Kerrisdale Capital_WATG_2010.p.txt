Wonder Auto's
Wonderless
Acquisition
Oct. 4, 2010 11:12 PM ET4 comments | Includes: Wonder A…


The research firm OLP Global came out with an excellent research report on
Wonder Auto Technology, Inc. (OTCPK:WATG) last week, which I’ve attached
here.


The report examines a $15 million acquisition that Wonder Auto made in July
2010, and raises serious questions about whether the acquisition was
legitimate.


Acquisition Overview


In its second quarter 10Q, the company announced it acquired Vital Glee
Development Limited (“Vital Glee”) for $15 million on June 24, 2010. Vital
Glee was an “investment holding company and through its subsidiary engaging
in automotive shock absorber manufacturing business”. Click here for the
relevant disclosure. I’ve re-pasted it below:


“On June 24, 2010... [a subsidary of WATG] agreed to acquire 100% equity
interest in Vital Glee Development Limited (“Vital Glee”), for a total
consideration of $15 million of which $8.7 million was settled in June 2010.
The remaining consideration will be divided into 2 equal installments and will
be settled by December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 respectively. The
Company obtained control over Vital Glee on July 1, 2010 by appointing the
sole director to Vital Glee. Vital Glee is an investment holding company and
through its subsidiary engaging in automotive shock absorber manufacturing
business.”


Little additional disclosure was given, in the 10Q or any subsequent SEC
filings.

OLP investigated the acquisition further. From speaking with management, OLP
determined that Vital Glee’s operating entity was Jinzhou Lide Shock Absorber
Co., Ltd. This is further confirmed by a Roth Capital report on September 30,
2010.


After some investigation, OLP found serious issues with the acquisition, which I
will summarize below:


1. Jinzhou Lide was formed in April 2010


According to the AIC records for Jinzhou Lide, which are included in the OLP
research report, Jinzhou Lide was established on April 26, 2010. You can also
see this on the Jinzhou AIC website here (use Google Chrome's translation
functionality if you cannot read chinese).


I'm doubtful that a business that has been operational for 2 months can be
worth $15 million.


Management told OLP that Jinzhou Lide was formed from a reorganization of
an older company, which engaged in the same auto shock absorber business in
Jinzhou. Management, however, declined to provide the name of Jinzhou Lide’s
predecessor company, and I discuss below my skepticism around
management’s claim.


2. Jinzhou Lide was established at the same address as another facility
owned by WATG


According to AIC records (see page 4 of OLP report or the website I show
above), Jinzhou Lide was established and located at:


Bohai Street, Jinzhou Economy & Technology Development Zone, Jinzhou,
Laoning


This is the same address of Jinzhou Wanyou Mechanical Parts Co., Ltd., a
subsidiary of the company. OLP learned this by calling the company, but you
can look on this site, this site, or this site to verify that Jinzhou Wanyou is
located at Bohai Street, Jinzhou Economy & Technology Development Zone,
Jinzhou, Laoning. Or simply search for the chinese characters of the address
and the chinese characters of Jinzhou Wanyou Mechanical Parts Co., Ltd.,
which are found on pages 3 and 10 of the OLP report, respectively, in Google
Chrome.

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/659080-chinese-company-analyst/98727-wonder-autos-wonderless-acquisition 3/7


Not surprisingly, we also see this address show up in this 8k from April 4,
2007, where Jinzhou Wonder Auto Suspension System Co., Ltd. sells a stake in
Jinzhou Wanyou Mechanical Parts Co., Ltd. to WATG. Click here for the relevant
page showing the address. Jinzhou Wonder Auto Suspension System Co., Ltd.
is shown as a related party throughout several historical SEC filings, such as
its 2007 10K.


We now see that WATG paid $15 million for a subsidiary that was two months
old and established at the same address as one of WATG’s current facilities.


3. Jinzhou Lide had a registered capital of only $1.2 million, and yet
was sold for $15 million two months after being established


Jinzhou Lide’s registered capital is only $1.2 million, which implies that its
shareholders only put in $1.2 million in April 2010 to establish the business.
Yet it was sold to WATG for $15 million in July 2010. I’m doubtful that Jinzhou
Lide’s value rose 1,200% in its two months of operations.


4. Management has not disclosed the identity of Vital Glee’s seller


In the vast majority of M&A transactions, investors are aware of the identities
of both the buyer and seller. In this case, WATG management has not
disclosed the identity of the seller, and investors cannot determine the identity
of the seller through any other means. Vital Glee is registered in the British
Virgin Islands (BVI), and the BVI registered agent will only release the director
and shareholder information if Vital Glee management consents. Upon OLP’s
request, the BVI registered agent sought permission on multiple occasions
from Vital Glee management, but has yet to receive approval to release Vital
Glee’s shareholder information.


OLP also asked WATG management to identify the name of the seller.
According to OLP, the WATG CFO stated that he does not know the identity of
the seller.


The question therefore remains: who owned Vital Glee and who received the
claim to $15 million upon its sale?


WATG should publicly disclose the identity of Vital Glee’s sellers, and enable
investors to independently access the relevant information from the BVI
registered agent.

5. Jinzhou-based sources in the auto parts industry were unable to
identify Jinzhou Lide’s predecessor, and weren’t aware of M&A
involving any $15 million shock absorber businesses in Jinzhou


OLP identified 14 companies in the auto shock absorber business located in
Jinzhou that have effective AIC registrations. They are listed here. OLP spoke
to “numerous” members of this list in an effort to identify Jinzhou Lide’s
predecessor and none of them were able to identify a company that could have
been Jinzhou Lide’s predecessor.


Additionally, none of the sources were aware of a $15 million acquisition in the
auto shock absorber sector in Jinzhou.


Conclusion


We have seen corporate governance issues and questionable financial and
management practices at other Chinese RTOs structured and financed similarly
to Wonder Auto. Like others, Wonder Auto has not chosen a top-4 auditor,
instead choosing to go with PKF Hong Kong, a firm that boasts only 4 partners.
Like others, Wonder Auto has eye-popping financial figures, claiming 40% to
50% revenue growth annually since 2005 and 20%+ operating income growth
during that same time period, which imply extraordinarily high returns on
capital on its capital expenditures and acquisitions. During the global downturn
of 2008 and 2009, which impacted China just like the rest of the world, WATG
doubled both revenue and gross profit, and increased EPS by 40%. The
company has raised substantial amounts of dilutive equity at low valuations,
such as $69 million in November 2009 at a valuation of less than 15x PE.


The facts behind the Jinzhou Lide acquisition are damning. WATG appears to
have paid $15 million for a 2-month-old company established at the same site
as one of WATG’s other subsidiaries. WATG has yet to disclose the seller of
Jinzhou Lide, and its general disclosure of the acquisition is noticeably sparse.
Numerous local competitors are unaware of a shock absorber business in
Jinzhou that could have been the predecessor to Jinzhou Lide. They also have
not heard of a $15 million acquisition in the sector. The shock absorber
business community in Jinzhou is small enough that such a predecessor and
acquisition would not go unnoticed.

Comments (4)


If management wants to prevent further allegations of fraud, it should release
an 8K elaborating on the details of the Jinzhou Lide acquisition. It should
provide predecessor financial statements of Jinzhou Lide; the identity and
backgrounds of its sellers; an explanation of why its initially registered address
is the same as one of its subsidiary's; a list of customers; and additional
information that would allow independent analysts to verify Jinzhou Lide's
legitimacy.

Author’s reply »  At this point, I simply
don't have enough information about
Wonder Auto Suspension or any of the
funky acquisitions that Wonder Auto has
been completing over the past 4 years.
I have my suspicions and I'm short. OLP
came out with a large 72-page report
on Wednesday that's only available to
its subscribers and which I haven't seen
yet.


I take Roth's research with a grain of
salt. They've attested to doing due
diligence on ONP and CHBT, and those
companies have been exposed as
frauds. At some point, I assume that

management will come out with a
response, perhaps reiterating much of
what Roth says in its report. And at
some point, the OLP report will be made
public, or at least its content or main
findings.


For now, I wrote on what I could infer,
and requested that management reveal
certain things about Jinzhou Lide in an
8K, including "predecessor financial
statements of Jinzhou Lide; the identity
and backgrounds of its sellers; an
explanation of why its initially
registered address is the same as one
of its subsidiary's; a list of customers;
and additional information that would
allow independent analysts to verify
Jinzhou Lide's legitimacy."


I'm sure that my post won't be the last
word on WATG, and we'll see what
emerges over time.

You must be kidding me, you take the 72
page report of OLP seriously (which you
haven't even read yet), but you take
Roth's report, a reputable firm, with a
"grain of salt". Is it the 72 pages that
impresses you?


You have no facts, just speculation, you're
short, and you're trying to scare others
into selling. Anyone who listens to what
you have to say here should take your
words with far more than "a grain of salt".
