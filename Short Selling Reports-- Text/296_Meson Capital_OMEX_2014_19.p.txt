SSCA August Salvage Declines 89% From June, Funds OMEX Losses
3 Days

Summary


Latest Salvage Inventory sheet: ~275 Double Eagles, ~35 oz of gold dust/nuggets
and ~100oz misc small denomination coins, 89% LESS gold collateral vs May 19 –
June 12 recovery.


Clearly no trace of “army gold” cache: zero ingots salvaged for the first time (vs 2
tiny ones in prior month).


Based on Fifth Third Loan Agreement, incremental double eagles should allow an
additional cash draw on credit line of ~$275,000. Enough to fund OMEX operating
losses for 3 extra days.


Inventory facts contradict promotional management statements on recent
conference call. OMEX now insolvent and likely filing bankruptcy shortly unless
vague “marketing agreement” debt closes soon.


Strategy Shift? Unnecessary early credit line draw to inflate Q2 cash balance and
unprofitable SSCA efforts appear to be attempts to spite short sellers while impairing
shareholders and creditors.


The inventory sheet from the latest month of Odyssey Marine Exploration
(NASDAQ:OMEX) salvage has just been posted on the SS Central America court website.
The total recovery is approximately 400oz of gold coins, dust and nuggets with no ingots.
The items that can be borrowed on the Fifth Third $10mm credit line (Double Eagles and
Ingots) include ~275 double eagles with a face value of $5,500, a decline of 89% vs the
May 19-June 12 recovery period where $51,799 face value of double eagles and ingots
were recovered.


This recovery should allow OMEX to borrow an additional $275,000 ($1,000 per
double eagle) against the existing Fifth Third credit line which should be enough to fund
an additional 3 days of cash burn based on losses to date ($3mm/month = $100k/day
approx.). In total there should be a max credit availability of ~$7.25mm on this $10mm
credit line (net of $500k restricted cash).

Table of all monthly SS Centra America recovery reports so far, source Meson / court docs


"First of all, we have secured or negotiated a new loan agreement, the first $5 million of
that loan agreement we expect to come in, in the coming days or week, but probably this
month in the month of August.


Secondly, we've drawn down an additional amount on the bank loan facility that we
secured in the month of May, based on our cargo recovery results in recent weeks." - CFO
Philip Devine Q2 Conf Call Aug 11


On the conference call, the CFO was highly evasive of answering the question of how
much extra they were able to draw on the credit line, only saying they "drew an additional
amount." As it turns out, this amount must be only $275k or so, enough to finance a mere
few days of operational losses. Given you know the facts now about the second
statement, are you optimistic about the vague language of the first?


How does the fact of this new recovery square with recent statements by
management on the conference call?


OMEX Q2 Conference Call [Facts inserted by author]:


"The SS Central America project has gone through phases of high rates of valuable cargo
recovery and phases of lower recovery rates depending on which parts of the ships we're
working on….


The recovery rate in May and the first half of June was very significant. [FACT:
~$52,000 face value of gold recovered that month] The rate of recovery of valuable cargo
items slowed down in the period between June 15th and July 15th [FACT: ~$3,500 face
value of gold recovered this period] as we spent time moving large deposits of debris from
an area of the shipwreck believed to hold important artifacts effect and valuable cargo.
This was a planned and necessary step in carrying out a thorough archeological recovery.


These past weeks have again seen an uptick in recovery results coming from newly
explored areas of the shipwreck site. It was this renewed rate of cargo recovery that
allowed us today to draw down a further cash advance from our bank on our $10 million
credit facility." - CFO Philip Devine


"For the past week, we've had a substantial recovery success" - COO, Mark Gordon

"With a steady stream of gold coming up from the SS Central America, the Oceanica
project moving forward rapidly…" - CEO Greg Stemm, Q2 PR


Shareholders might be tempted to think that this "uptick in recovery results" in "newly
explored areas" might be comparable to the early results, right? FACT: Total gold recovery
declined over 80% from the May-June period to the most recent "uptick" month, and
declined 89% if only counting the gold eligible for collateral on the credit line, which is the
only gold that can produce immediate cash inflows to fund operations.


"the Oceanica phosphate project is progressing beyond our original expectations" - COO,
Mark Gordon


FACT: Oceanica EIA still isn't filed despite CEO Greg Stemm claiming "finished and will
be filed shortly" 10 weeks ago at June 4 AGM, locals are protesting including a Member of
the Senate


"we have just entered into a loan and long term exclusive marketing agreement which
provides up to $10 million in new funding" - COO, Mark Gordon


FACT: A Letter of Intent (LOI) is NOT an Agreement and the deal has not closed


"I am asking you to give your management team a chance to allow actual results to
influence your judgment as to whether OMEX is an investment you should buy, hold or
sell. I urge you to make this decision for yourselves based on real facts" - COO, Mark
Gordon


OMEX Now Almost Certainly Officially Insolvent


OMEX's Stockholders' Equity is now almost certainly negative: it was only $2.158mm at
the end of Q2 and losses have almost certainly exceeded this now given the $3mm/month
loss rate. Even using wildly optimistic accrual accounting, assuming a receivable (netting
expenses) booked at $2mm/month for work done at the SS Central America, a
$1mm/month loss (far better than has been achieved so far this year) leads to shareholder
equity being negative at the start of September.

Business Strategy Now seems Aimed towards Spiting Short Sellers Rather than
Shareholder (and Creditor) Value


Since last October 2013, we have said we want OMEX to increase its transparency with
shareholders. The harsh reality, we believe, is that once shareholders realize the full truth
about OMEX, they will realize that it has no prospect to be a viable business and the stock
will become worthless. Indeed, management appears aware of the issue, describing
themselves as an "easy target" for short seller commentary on the most recent conference
call. Had current shareholders invested their money instead in any of the OMEX-related
private entities (Neptune, Mako, Seagrass, etc.) their money would have been already lost
and no liquidity available to cash out. The fact that the stock still trades, allowing people to
exit at an astoundingly high $100mm market capitalization is an unusual opportunity
provided by public markets.


Unfortunately, it seems management has gone the other direction - rather than addressing
their "easy target" status by improving the business model, they are trying to sweep the
facts even further under the rug by changing their business strategy towards actions that
appear designed to spite short sellers (in the short term at least) while destroying
shareholder value - and we believe further impairing creditors in bankruptcy coming
shortly. In fact, OMEX even dedicated a solid paragraph in its most recent legal 10Q
document complaining about short sellers.

Comments (55)


For example, why did OMEX need to draw down the additional ~$2.5mm on their Fifth
Third credit line to post a $5.7mm cash balance for the end of Q2? This creates additional
interest expenses that shareholders will pay for the purpose of inflating the closing cash
(and debt) balances for the reported quarter end. The continued efforts at the SS Central
America also appear to be incrementally unprofitable given the small recovery over the
last 2 months. However, management relishes in "proving shorts wrong" that said there
was no economic reason to continue recovery. We hope management puts their fiduciary
duty for all stakeholders ahead of their ego and starts providing the transparency that
shareholders deserve after tolerating so many unfulfilled promise over the years.

I hope to provide relevant fact-checking insights to assess the accuracy of the title statement: 
" SSCA August Salvage Declines 89% From June, Funds OMEX Losses 3 Days" 
In the title statement above, the author is using and mixing very different meanings for the term "value" within the
same statement... namely "face" value versus “collateral” value and ignoring the "commercial" or GAAP and Cash
value of the inventory? It is the latter value(s) that will go to fund “OMEX Losses”.


On the one hand, the author's article indicates that the 89% "value" differential is based on the actual "face" value of
the recovered coins and bullion. That is, a $20 dollar coin has a "value" of $20. If we were discussing recently minted,
virtually identical coins in similar physical condition, the comparison could be valid. However, it is a very well
established fact that old gold coins, especially of the nature of those coming from a historic wreck such as the SSCA,
have value for their rarity, also known as numismatic value, which is what enhances the actual market value of the
coins by very significant multiples. Even with only casual knowledge of this basic fact of rare coin valuation, the author
should know that any single $20 gold coin minted in the late 1850's can have market value into six figures per
individual coin! In fact, any individual coin in this inventory if of high “uncirculated” quality, can have a commercial
value in excess of the $300,000, which is of course the total value cited by the author in their article. In fact the
$300,000 as presented by the author, is based only on their estimate of a “collateral value” formulation of a working
capital loan, which most observers would find is an ultra-conservative advance rate, and which will be exceeded by a
significant seven figures when the commercial value is realized (the latter being the basis for Odyssey’s remuneration
under its recovery contract is earned). Thus given the importance of the commercial value to both the GAAP and
Cash results the Company will report in future SEC filings, why is no attempt made by the author to even
acknowledge the existence of a commercial value, nor much less to estimate the range of commercial value of the
inventory? This gap in the author’s analysis is a very relevant, major and disturbing omission that unless clarified,
leads the reader of the article’s title (and article itself) to erroneous misunderstanding of the most meaningful value
representation of the recoveries in question. The title has been presented with two conflicting value statements,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2430295-ssca-august-salvage-declines-89-percent-from-june-funds-omex-losses-3-days 7/18


focused on “face value” and “collateral value”, while the “commercial value” that the Company will receive under
GAAP and Cash accounting is ignored. Thus, the value of the inventory as described by the author ($300,000) in the
title is misleading since it bears virtually no relevance to the total seven-figure funding Odyssey will receive for this
current inventory under GAAP and/or Cash accounting.


For proper balance, I wish to note that even Odyssey does not attempt to place a commercial market value on the
inventory at this time, nor does the Company make any public statements as to their belief as to the GAAP/Cash
value of the inventories they have recovered to date. Why? well without a lengthy process of individually examining
the recovered coins (which will take place under over the coming months), it is virtually impossible for anyone today,
including the author, to establish with any accuracy how the current market value will translate into the cash
commercial value. Thus for the author of this article to say with conviction that the current inventory of valuable coins
"...Funds OMEX Losses Three Days" is a statement that applies a partial estimate of debt collateral valuation on the
inventory and ignores the real market value of rare coins of numismatic qualities. The commercial value, while not
determinable with precision until significant diligence is completed by an expert coin reviewer over the coming
months, is clearly so far in excess of $300,000, so as to make the omission of any discussion of the realizable
commercial value less than credible financial analysis to rely on in publishing an article on Seeking Alpha whose
policies discourage “Bombastic” titles that are not supported by diligent analysis.

How could you possibly give the public a of value? You said 20 dollar double eagles at $5500.00. That is the lowest
price. Most will be over 10000.00 because of grade. You also only included the 20 double eagles in your math. There
other rare coins more valuable than the 20 dollar double eagles. You advisors are doing a bad job this time.

The above projections of bankruptcy are unsettling for stockholders, and it is unusual there are so few comments on
this issue. Here are mine: 
Since the lack of returns on the Central America site seem to trigger these words, let's look at it. Why was Robert
Evans, probably second in command of the Columbia America group, so sure the site still contained most of the
precious cargo? His involvement with Omex guided my modest investment, and I've decided to stay with it only
because of my interest. I'm 85, an amateur treasure hunter with little return in more than 50 years, and just still
fascinated with it.

If we move on into other projects, Oceanica looks problematic in dealing with unstable and corrupt government. The
material is there, and it's not necessarily in the fishing community's domain, but this group has been recruited by the
money hungry opposition. Somebody will recover that phosphate. 
It is hard to understand how Omex disposed of the compensation from the 'Gairsoppa' recovery. That project is
unmatched, anywhere. And the company seems to remain in excellent stead with the Royal Navy and the Ministry
given control of HMS Victory, another outstanding project. I think they have 80% of that, and most of it is in relative
shallow, but nasty water. 
Some other contributions would be nice.

Donald,


One reason would be because this is Meson Capital's 18th negative OMEX article in 10 months and it's like
watching reruns of Desperate Housewives. Bob Evans was intimately involved through the entire salvage
from 1989-1991 and did more due diligence than probably anyone on the treasure and potential treasure on
the SSCA. Being sure treasure is there and actually recovering it all are two different issues though. OMEX
will not recover every single gold coin that is on the site and the question remains how will they continue to do
on scattered passenger gold. That being said, IMO they have recovered somewhere between $30-40 M
already depending on how rare some of the coins and private bars are.

35oz nuggets/dust 
100+ California fractional coins 
100+ silver coins, including foreign


This amounts to about 340 oz of gold.


However, there is substantial numismatic value here:


In MS-63 condition, a 1855-S $3 coin is worth $95,000 according to the 2015 Red Book. A 1856-S goes for $32,000
and the 1857-S for $75000.


The $2.5 pieces should average $10,000 each.


The 1856-S $1 coins go for $30,000, in MS-63 condition.


There are no known recent sales of MS-63 $5 1855-S coins, and we have 8; maybe a couple will grade that high. In
MS-60, they go for $12,500.


A 1857-S $20 in MS-63 condition goes for $9000. However, one in MS-67 condition sold for $138,000 two years ago,
and we have loads of them, a few of which may grade that high.


These are all realistic numbers but depend on condition; the above conditions are optimistic. Of course, they have all
been undisturbed since 1857.


I won't be selling any OMEX Monday morning.

There is also gold jewelry, I figure the total value is about $10 million on the last month. The expenses for a month is
only $2 million so they were profitable by $8 million last month.


I read somewhere that they were not recovering much for the prior month as they has to move the coal carried aboard
the ship and are now starting to move into the passenger cabin areas. This new gold is passenger gold and they are
starting find a lot of it. The next amount should be a lot more than this.

The total recovery so far I think someone said is worth about $40 million or more. Since they have only spent about
$6 million they have made $34 million. They can easily get a loan on the recovered gold.

In the 8-K, the below is included: 
"As further consideration for the credit facility, Odyssey assigned to the lender a portion of the shares that
Odyssey owns in an Odyssey subsidiary and granted the lender the right to convert the outstanding loan
balance into shares of that subsidiary or to purchase additional shares of that subsidiary from Odyssey if the
loan is repaid. Odyssey’s obligations under the credit facility are secured by specified assets, including a
portion of Odyssey’s shares in the subsidiary."


What OMEX subsidiary would a coin marketing concern be interested enough in to buy shares? Not
phosphate. This collateral is a (hidden) asset, or is the HMS Victory a subsidiary?

Might I suggest that rather than "Guess" at cash levels and credit line drawdowns and announcing your guesstimates
on here (for the sole purpose of creating a negative spin) - you group email the questions to management and get
actuals to save yourself from going to jail for publishing materially misleading false info for the intent of causing
material damage to a publicly traded security (think you have already been reported for this and we don't want you in
jail just yet!).. Management said on the conference call they would gladly answer publicly emailed questions on
completed financing deals and material changes to short term liquidity, so lets just ask them to avoid the guesswork?..


My best guess is that you have a larger group of "pent up investor demand" on the sidelines as investors set to "buy
OMEX on good news" probably significantly outweighs the group set to "sell OMEX on bad news" due to your
handiwork.. So you have an asymmetric supply and demand set up as a result of your rumor mongering..


My best guess is that over the course of the next few weeks to next few months the factual news announcements will
show a positive spin on both the SSA CA recovery $$size and on the Mexican approvals to start on the offshore
mining of the phosphorus deposit.. Once this happens I do not really see where your negative spins go?


Once astute investors see its not a bankruptcy candidate anymore..The valuation on that offshore deposit alone will
revalue this thing up multiples from current values, thats why I'm buying it..Not for the treasure wrecks but I love the
mining biz model they have and I know others do too..If they can pull off those Mexican approvals - with the
partnerships they have..This thing is worth a tonne.. Run any cash flow model on that mining biz from 5yrs out to
25yrs out and discount those flows and "Wholy Cow thats a huge bloody number" even with a 20% cap rate!!..Get out
of the way!..


Meson - was wondering what your cash flow model shows for that deposit if it does get all the approvals and moves
ahead? Can't be less than $1Bn..? You must see that as your biggest risk being short this company?

Hi Mr Pink


"Meson - was wondering what your cash flow model shows for that deposit if it does get all the approvals and moves
ahead? Can't be less than $1Bn..? "


Just an observation based upon my limited experience as a home builder in Mexico and in BCS, the Baja Peninsula
that houses the Oceanica deposit.


It took me 8 months to approve moving 12 cacti from one part of the lot where I was going to build, to another. And it
cost me $7K. Then 2 years after the house was built, I got another visit from Semanart who did a survey and asked
me all the same questions that were asked and complied with on the original application, (during this visit I showed
them where the cacti went physically). Then 6 months later, I received several notices requiring me to sign that I had
moved the cacti . This was delivered by 3 notices posted on my sliding windows with deadlines, promising some type
of legal default if I didn't get those forms right back. That's Semanart.


As a codicil to this story, I later sold the lot that housed the 12, moved cacti. The new owner did NOT get Semanat
clearance and actually built his house right on top of the location of those 12 transplanted and now defunct cacti.


So (and I am very long OMEX and staying so) I am NOT expecting Oceanica to be accretive to OMEX's bottom line
until sometime in late 2015 or 2016. My estimate of time to fruition is only valid in that it is quite different than what

Mykie -


I do not expect any cash flows from Oceanica / Mexican Baja deposit in 2015 or 2016 - more likely for 2018 or
2019 or 5years+ as noted in the original post..Actually OMEX is not the right company to take on the entire
project in terms of engineering and funding, so its great to see them collaborate with strategic partners for it,
as this adds to their credibility.. They should JV the deal with additional partners - like JP Morgan who can
properly fund it and from the sounds of it they have located engineering and construction partners for the
design and build CAPEX phase.. OMEX should just get paid to operate a portion of the operation and own a
tiny piece. Still worth a tone for them and adds massive cash flow stability to their company in years T+5Y to
T+25Y..

"It took me 8 months to approve moving 12 cacti from one part of the lot where I was going to build, to
another. And it cost me $7K."


That's $583.33 per cactus. I'm sure the $ was put to good use, however. Wow.

As further consideration for the credit facility, Odyssey assigned to the lender a portion of the shares that
Odyssey owns in an Odyssey subsidiary and granted the lender the right to convert the outstanding loan
balance into shares of that subsidiary or to purchase additional shares of that subsidiary from Odyssey if the
loan is repaid. Odyssey’s obligations under the credit facility are secured by specified assets, including a

This looks like a tricky question so I'll just take a guess: did they use shares in LEI?

ryan bhandari
The fact that they did not name the sub is further evidence of mgmts evasive manner. Since they know they
are coming up short with the SSCA they have pegged investors hopes to Oceanica -- now they have used the
Oceanica equity as collateral for the loan but refuse to mention it in this press release. Very shady.


20 Aug 2014, 10:06 AM


Cliff-Fiscal, Contributor
ryan. How do you know they are coming up short on the SSCA. The recovery is about where they thought
they might be at this stage. Estimates from about $50-80M for the total project. Imo they have excavated
about 40-50% of the ship and very little of the debris field with recovery values ranging between $35-40
million at this point.


20 Aug 2014, 10:28 AM


ryan bhandari
I understand there is usually a methodical process to a recovery like this, however I think from mgmt's
perspective they would have been more aggressive in pulling up higher value objects more immediately,
given the specific liquidity concerns of the company. There may be more high value stuff down there but if I
was mgmt, I would have wanted to pull that stuff up before that last conference call instead of having to ask
investors to have faith in them etc. It also affects their ability to secure more funding if they need it. Just my
two-cents.


20 Aug 2014, 11:23 AM

Pulling up higher value items first would not be conducive for the archeology work they are doing, nor be an
efficient way to excavate. It would not help monetize items any quicker although it would help if they were
trying to draw down on loans.

Odyssey is following a recovery plan approved by the court who has rights to the ship. This work is being
followed closely by parties with an interest in the HMS Victory, a valuable historic project to say the least. The
company may not be so concerned about liquidity as others.


20 Aug 2014, 12:26 PM


ryan bhandari
Yet, the pattern of recovery indicates they did find the highest value stuff first, followed by smaller and smaller
(dollar amount) recoveries. Do you believe this to be coincidence or the fact they have indeed been
opportunistic in their hauls?


20 Aug 2014, 12:51 PM


ryan bhandari
Is the SSCA set up as a subsidiary? Or do you think they were referring to Ocenanica?


20 Aug 2014, 12:52 PM


Cliff-Fiscal, Contributor
Odyssey got off to a great start due to unfinished work from 1991 and the fact they had Bob Evans prior
knowledge. They hit a slow period due to moving the large amount of coal which was probably not possible in
1989-1991. Now, barring a lucky break on any further commercial cache, they are into passenger gold/silver
which is in smaller parcels. Gordon said they had run into a nice stretch before coming in last time but we
don't know any specifics until the next report and diagram. Finding these trunks, leather bags, etc has proven
very valuable. They have yet to work the debris field yet in any detail.

The 8k information sited by our author is very helpful in understanding the new $10 million funding deal. As
either being short or long OMEX, the key issue is that the parent company decided to structure the deal most
importantly without having OMEX shares used as collateral, nor for the conversion mechanism. Not only does
this potentially preserve $10 million of cash when the deal matures in 2016, but is let's the market know that
additional shares of OMEX will not be coming to market. I believe that is bad news for the shorts and good for

longs. Otherwise, long or short, which subsidiary has borrowed is immaterial since all reporting of debt needs
to be consolidated in the next 10Q filing, and so it would be most appropriate for the Company to disclose
such matters in an SEC filing (next 10Q) as opposed to the chat from a less visible board forum. Since the
author has already established for us the complete lack of value of both the Oceanica and Neptune
subsidiaries, the Company appears to have pulled off a brilliant funding with the conversion feature into
shares of one of these subsidiaries. Amazing how easily investors will part with $10 million these days for a
parent company reported to be on the verge of bankruptcy.

I think that they pulled up the high value items first. They started at the stern of the ship, where they knew the
most coins in the smallest area were located. Not knowing which coins were to be found, they went after the
most they could recover in the shortest period.

Completely false analogy BlueRidge. They've salvaged almost $50mn from the SS CA at this point. They're
likely due approx $23-25mn from the proceeds. They've monetized approx $8mn via the bank facility and
$5mn from the marketing agreement. I would call that bringing in wood to heat the house, but leaving some
wood outside for later.


Luckily for shareholders, it sounds like there's lots more wood to chop!

I personally wouldn't make BK predictions (at least not as to specific dates), since the company seems to be
very "innovative" in raising capital to keep this thing afloat and draw in more suckers. They've been doing it
for almost 20 years now.

How many promises of riches has mgmt made to shareholders over the years? How many projects were
touted as the "next big thing" or a "goldmine", etc.? Yet they've never paid a dividend and the stock price has
consistently gone down. The verdict has already been rendered on this company - courtesy of mgmt's
absolutely ABYSMAL long-term track record.


22 Aug 2014, 02:59 PM


HarrietBall
I don't know how many promises were made and not kept in the past. I just know that I like what I hear now.
They promised zero on the CA and have delivered a total of $40mn+. They've not promised anything with
respect to Oceanica, and have delivered $27.5mn in cash and a lot more in implied value. So, yes the trend is
changing and we will see more evidence of this in coming weeks.

Blue: "Rear view mirror investing" should be the title of your next title piece to support your short premise.
Following the same logic, other names who had past failures and stock prices to reflect the same (say F,
APPL, etc.) once failed, always failed...just brilliant theory! Did you ever see the definition of insanity? It
messes with your mind when you are on the wrong side of a trade such as OMEX. Maybe you have been
another unsuspecting victim of one too many short & distort campaigns that have been highlighted across the
Internet? The time to short was in the $3s (unfortunately for me where I started my long position) and now
should be covering before we see the "mother of all short squeezes" as Roland Perry states in his SA
analysis. Go read his piece which I find pretty much factually correct (I attempt to correct factual mistatements
I find on SA and other boards) but, of course Perry's analysis ending in a table pounding long
recommendation (he also misjudged the short campaign nastiness and was premature in his entry point
however). With such polar opposite opinions on OMEX, there certainly will be big losers and winners...sooner
than we might imagine. Disclosure: Long OMEX

Actually, I don't recall mgmt ever promising riches, or touting the next big thing or goldmines. Many stocks
have never paid dividends, and OMEX stock has not consistently gone down. It has traded between $2.50
and $4 since 2011, until early this year. It broke below $2 about the time Meson began its negative campaign
and short selling increased markedly.


Consider where the stock would be had they kept the 17 tons of silver coins recovered in 2007, which Spain
won in its lawsuit. That was a major OMEX mistake, but the company's business approach has been
corrected. The stock reached $9 on the initial announcement.

With the company's cost-cutting underway, SS CA will provide two years of future ops. Salvaging the HMS
Victory will be the "goldmine" to which you refer. Any short seller who does not cover at these stock prices is
probably in the wrong business.

And we could say the same of the short brigade on OMEX, Blueridge. The short thesis has been wrong time
and time again. The "leader" of the shorts has serious quality issues. His fund is being dissolved after poor
performance, he's been fired as Chmn of LEI, there's a petition to bring an SEC investigation to his research
which has over 100 signatures, and he is likely facing a big legal battle. I don't really see a good reason to
believe the shorts at this point. They've been thoroughly discredited.

The $10 million will fund this company into next year, and by then they should be getting revenues from the sale of the
Central America coins. The next salvage report will be an interesting one, I expect to see many more gold coins so
your graph will show a higher recovery rate then.


Final value for the project could exceed $80 million dollars or more. OMEX could end up with $50 million of that.
Subtract the loans and you have $30 million in profits going into next year, to be collected as the coins and artifacts
sell..

There are many coin dealers that would die to be part of the sale of this recovery. The coin collector community will
pay high prices for the coins. The recent sale of the Saddle Ridge hoard showed that.


The variety of coins is amazing, also many seem to have come straight out of the San Francisco mint vaults into the
hands of the passengers prior to sailing. Prices will be very, very high.

Fourth Central America Operational Report Now Available.


Report #14-04 which covers activities at the SS Central America shipwreck has been filed with the United States
District Court, Eastern District of Virginia by Recovery Limited Partnership (RLP). Odyssey Marine Exploration
$OMEX has now placed this report on its website:


http://bit.ly/1ARuypc.


This report covers operations conducted on the site between July 16 and August 15, 2014. During this time, over
1,000 gold coins in a wide range of denominations, dates and mint marks including privately-minted gold coins and
rarer smaller denomination gold coins. This brings the total gold coins recovered to date to 3,096 and the total number
of coins (both gold and silver) to over 15,000.


In addition to gold coins, during this rotation, Odyssey also recovered over silver coins, over 60 pieces of jewelry, and
interesting cultural heritage artifacts. In conjunction with the ongoing archaeological excavation, a science program is
being conducted with the collection of additional biological specimens for scientific study and the collection of samples
for medical research.


A report covering current operations is scheduled to be filed with the court by September 25, 2014.


Earlier this year, Odyssey Marine Exploration was awarded the exclusive contract to conduct an archaeological
excavation and recover the remaining valuable cargo from the SS Central America shipwreck by the Receiver for
Recovery Limited Partnership (RLP). Work at the site began in April 2014.
