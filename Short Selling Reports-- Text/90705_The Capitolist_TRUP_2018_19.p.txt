TRUP


Trupanion (TRUP) is the most expensive insurance company on a price to book
ratio (~10x) that I can find on the exchange (at least 3x the nearest comp
Progressive Insurance).


The company has repeatedly stepped over the line of legality regarding the
licensing of their sales force and marketing techniques.


The customer acquisition costs are ripping higher along with churn and evidence of
noncompetitive high pricing suggests TRUP may be entering a rate spiral.


The company currently trades at a 70% premium to where the comps are being
purchased, and TRUP is losing market share to those comps.

The Nightmare Is The Hamster Wheel


The Brief History of My Coverage of Trupanion


It's important to highlight where we started this journey and how risks to the model have
come home to roost in the form of higher costs and slower growth. I believe the
company is worth less than $10/share and the most recent quarter highlighted the kind
of dramatic deterioration of fundamentals that I predicted would happen once the
regulators stepped in.


To be clear, NASDAQ:TRUP is the worst value available to investors within the pet
insurance industry (public or private) and the comps bare this out (report here). The pet
insurance product offered by TRUP is the most expensive and non-competitively priced
product available to consumers in the space. The company is in the process of
converting a largely unregulated and poorly paid Multi-Level Marketing ("MLM") sales
force - the "Territory Partners" - into a compliant and more expensive properly licensed
insurance sales force. Because the product is priced non-competitively, the cost of
acquiring these customers is ballooning and churn has hit an all time high.


Because TRUP under-priced its business to get off the ground they need to continually
raise prices on existing customers, but the regulators have begun pushing back on said
pricing increases. That forces TRUP to increase the cost of its insurance to new clients.
Several years in, TRUP policies are so overpriced compared to their peers, that the
company is forced to spend ever increasing amounts of money on acquiring new pets.
This reduces TRUP's ability to generate profit, which reduces TRUP's ability to build
statutory capital by which to underwrite new clients and grow the business. The tell tale
signs of such a cascade will be decreased Gross Margins (due to not being able to raise
rates fast enough to cover increased claims), increased customer acquisition costs (due
to the need to price initial offerings higher), which lead to negative incremental EBITDA
growth per dollar spent on marketing. And eventually to the need for additional capital.


The most recent quarter offers much cause for concern.


For those new to the story this is the short and sweet of what has transpired:


TRUP is a pet insurance company that (at the time of my first publication) ran a
nearly fully unlicensed insurance sales team they call "territory partners". In

The Financials Are Telling A Treacherous Story


addition to the "territory partners" TRUP was paying Veterinarians and Veterinarian
Assistants by way of cash gift cards and trips to Hawaii for the successful sale of
insurance.


My initial report highlighted some of these violations, I detailed a litany of marketing
violations here, here, here, and here.


In the second report I published a letter from the Chief Administrative Officer Asher
Bearman and Chief Council Gavin Friedman where by they took the opportunity to
accuse me of securities fraud and make claims such as, "Trupanion does not pay
any compensation to veterinarians based on the sale of insurance." and
"Territory Partners do not sell or solicit Trupanion direct to consumers
unless they have elected to obtain a license as direct marketing is not their
role."


Threatening language aside TRUP promptly halted all payments to veterinarians
after my post.


And after a lengthy investigation from the Washington State Office of Insurance
Commissioner "OIC" into these claims and others the OIC agreed with my
interpretation of the law with regards to the licensing status of "Territory Partners",
payments to Vets, and the behavior surrounding reviews.com.


On the most recent conference call TRUP CEO Darryl Rawlings stated, "Recently,
a few states have inquired about the role of territory partners". As predicted these
regulatory violations will need to be remedied nation wide.


The TRUP thesis has always been a fundamental short with a regulatory component.
The loss of the cheap unlicensed sales force is an important catalyst however
fundamentals are telling the tale of a business that:


Is struggling to generate additional subscriber growth1.


Has priced it self out of the market2.


Is spending increasingly large amounts of money acquiring policy holders for
negative returns

Is showing tell tale signs of a rate spiral (including very high rates for new policy
holders, rapid increases in customer acquisition costs, increased churn, and a
willingness to destroy value in the name of top line growth)


4.


Lets go through this step-by-step starting with the sales trajectory over time because
TRUP has two different sales lines that highlight important issues facing the business.


Throughout this section I will use Italics to symbolize my narration of concerns and
commentary as opposed to defining what you see in the slides above.


Figure 1: Revenue Broken Down by Sub-Segment

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4281647-trupanion-8-price-target-hamster-wheel-flywheel?source=all_articles_title 5/11


As you can see the growth in the "other" segment is far outpacing the gross adds in the
subscription business. The "other" business represents the pet insurance sold by "Pets
Best" (and others) that TRUP underwrites in a white label offering for "Pets Best", its
new owner Synchrony Financial (SYF), and other competitors to the TRUP business.
This highlights a bizarre competitive issue facing TRUP. Even with the knowledge of its
own high pricing, TRUP is providing underwriting services for competitors who then
under-price them and drive them out of the market. Presumably TRUP is only engaging
in such a self destructive business practice because they are desperate for the money.


Attempting to overcharge initial customers is a tell tail sign of real trouble, from an
underwriting perspective. The fear that grips investors is that the insurance company
(TRUP in this case) is attempting to "back-fill" the losses from their legacy plans by
overcharging the new customers. In TRUP's case there is ample evidence that they
have begun to aggressively overcharge for their service.


Figure 2: Evidence of Being Non-competitively Priced


Source: Author's Previous Report


As I detailed in this previous report, TRUP is the highest priced product among its peer
group. In fact the other policies are between 24% and 34% less expensive than what
TRUP offers clients. We saw the effect this is having on topline growth in Figure 1 - here
you can see that Pets Best averages at a 28% discount to TRUP, which explains why
they are growing so much faster (recall they are the "other" category).

The next phase of concern - after accepting that subscription growth is slowing and that
the offering is no longer competitive - would be to examine Gross Margins for signs of
stress and double check that the company isn't over spending on marketing in an
attempt to overcome their noncompetitive pricing.


Figure 3:Gross Margins Are Collapsing At The Same Time That CAC Is Rising


Source: EDGAR Filings and Author's Calculations


Deterioration of Gross Margin is due partly because of the growth displayed by the lower
margin "other" business. Regardless it will be impossible for TRUP to hit the long range
GM targets set forth by CEO Darryl Rawlings given this trajectory. As you can see the
cost of acquiring new pets is moving steadily higher suggesting that either the high
pricing paradigm TRUP has entered into is creating a headwind - or the Total
Addressable Market "TAM" is much smaller than expected.


Finally we have to examine churn, if customers begin churning off the service at a rapid
pace it will be nearly impossible to functionally grow the business.

Source: EDGAR Filings Author's Calculations


TRUP's rates increase every year as the policy holders pet ages. The basic problem
with rates that increase yearly is that eventually you reach a price whereby the
customers with the healthy dogs can't justify the cost, the policy holders with sick
animals have far greater incentive to continue paying premiums. As a result you
generate two distinct problems: 1.) TRUP's book of business becomes considerably less
profitable over time pressuring them to add new pets 2.) The number of pets churning
off over time eats into your new pet adds damaging TRUP's ability to meaningfully grow
its subscription business. In fact the number of pets churning off has grown from a
low of 38% of new pet adds in Q3-2015 to an all time high of 58% in Q1-2019.


The steady growth of this trend also points to the hamster-wheel affect taking over, the
churn is simply catching up with the additions... One should expect this dynamic will
lead to lower profits per dollar of revenue because of the pressure to spend money
acquiring additional lives as the book displays a higher level of atrophy each year.

Evidence of Being Over Valued Compared to Peers


Source: EDGAR Filings and Author's Calculations


In the chart above I look at the gross dollars added in sales each quarter on a YOY
basis (to remove seasonality). In the early days TRUP maintained a respectable
EBITDA growth rate but that has been in steady decline despite record high increases in
revenue. This speaks to the hamster wheel phase that the company has entered.
Despite hefty - record in fact - absolute dollar growth in revenues the company is now
destroying shareholder value as YOY EBITDA is negative.


(Note: I have removed the ~1m benefit that the company receives from renting their
building as it was not included in prior years and is not descriptive of the operating
business that I am trying isolate. To be conservative I DID NOT add that rent back into
the quarters prior to the purchase of the building... although reasonable - it would have
made this slide look MUCH worse)

Conclusion


Grab the growth, tame the risk
$


Source: Author's Previous Report


As you can see Pets Best was taken out for ~$720/pet by Synchrony Financial. TRUP's
current share price reflects a $2,340/pet valuation implying that the stock price needs to
fall by ~68% to be on par with the Pets Best acquisition. The Embrace transaction offers
no quarter as it was completed at a significant discount, as well.


Source: Author's Previous Report


At a steady state TRUP is worth the $9.67 - $7.75 per share value supported by its
comps (Pets Best/Embrace). However, the business looks to be in a state of collapse,
that if left unattended can deteriorate into a book of business which is essentially
worthless. Longs holding this company are paying full value for a (healthy) book of
business that is 300% larger than what the company has today. Subscription adds net of
churn last quarter were just over 16k pets - at that rate it will take the company 21 years
to grow into the valuation you are buying today.
