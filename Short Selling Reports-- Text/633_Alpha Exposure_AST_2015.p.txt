Asterias Biotherapeutics' Stem Cell Program Is Dead On Arrival
May 18, 2015 2:52 PM ET36 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


Summary


Its development portfolio is based on a stem cell program that had been abandoned
by its previous owner and has shown no signs of efficacy.


Asterias has been repackaging old clinical data as new developments.


Asterias has ties to a stock promotion and faces a near-term need to raise significant
capital.


We believe Asterias Biotherapeutics (NYSE: AST) is one of the most compelling shorts
today.


1. Its development portfolio is based on a stem cell program that had been abandoned by
its previous owner and has shown no signs of efficacy.


2. Asterias has been repackaging old clinical data as new developments.
3. Asterias has ties to a stock promotion and faces a near-term need to raise significant


capital.


Asterias' pipeline was abandoned by Geron in 2011 after showing no signs of efficacy in
its first Phase 1 trial


To best understand the prospects for Asterias' stem cell portfolio, it is important to
examine its development history when it was under Geron's (NASDAQ: GERN)
ownership. For background, Asterias purchased its entire stem cell program (AST-OPC1,
AST-VAC1, and AST-VAC2) from Geron in October 2013 (here), but it was Geron who
initially developed the stem cell program and conducted early clinical trials.


AST-OPC1 is the furthest along in terms of development and is Asterias' main focus, so
we will concentrate our analysis there.

AST-OPC1 had a difficult history while under Geron's ownership when it was known as
"GRNOPC1." First, it was placed on Clinical Hold by the FDA in May of 2008 (here) soon
after filing an IND. It was later revealed, as per a release in October 2009 (here), that the
FDA instituted the clinical hold due to a higher frequency of animals developing "cysts in
the injury site than had been seen in numerous previously conducted preclinical studies
with clinical grade GRNOPC1." GERN initiated its Phase 1 trial for GRNOPC1 in October
of that same year after the FDA Clinical Hold was lifted in July 2010 (here).


In our view, a Clinical Hold by the FDA is a red flag. Not only does it raise safety concerns,
but it also highlights the difficulty of bringing therapies successfully through the
development pathway, especially stem cell therapies which are not well understood.


Just over a year later, Geron announced on November 15, 2011 that it was ceasing
development on GRNOPC1 and the entirety of its stem cell portfolio (here). On the
conference call to explain their decision, Geron executives initially noted the cost and time

required to develop GRNOPC1. Later on the call, GERN admitted that GRNOPC1 had
shown no signs of efficacy in its Phase 1 trial, which we believe to be the more important
factor. Quotes from the conference call are below:


This lack of efficacy or signs of improvement was further corroborated by a press release
from Asterias on May 22, 2014 that reported updated long-term results from the original
Phase 1 trial by Geron. In the release (here), Asterias stated:


After abandoning its stem cell program Geron could not find a partner


Upon announcing Geron's decision to cease development of its stem cell program, Geron
said it was looking to find a partner for the program. On the same conference call, the
GERN CEO expressed optimism and said he hoped for a major partnership: "In fact a
number of the potential partners that we have ongoing discussions with are global
companies."


A research note by Roth Capital Partners following the conference call mentioned three
major companies as potential partners:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3192796-asterias-biotherapeutics-stem-cell-program-is-dead-on-arrival 4/14


Despite optimism for signing a partnership with a major company, GERN could not find a
single development partner. In November 2012, GERN announced that it had agreed to
divest its stem cell assets to BioTime Acquisition Company, a subsidiary of BioTime, Inc
(NYSE: BTX), that was later renamed to Asterias BioTherapeutics (here, here and here).


GERN received no cash as part of the divestiture and only received Asterias Series A
common stock. As part of the transaction, GERN agreed to divest the Asterias Series A
common shares through a distribution to shareholders (here), and on May 28, 2014
(here), Geron announced the distribution of Asterias Series A common shares. We believe
this is a strong sign that Geron did not believe in the potential of its stem cell portfolio and
wanted to quickly dispose of the shares. We're not sure where current Asterias
shareholders' misplaced enthusiasm comes from.


To summarize:


1. Asterias' AST-OPC1 has been hit with a Clinical Hold by the FDA.
2. AST-OPC1 was abandoned by its previous owner, Geron, who admitted that AST-


OPC1 exhibited no promising signs of efficacy.
3. Geron failed to sign a partnership with any major player for its stem cell portfolio, sold


its stem cell program to Asterias in exchange for shares in Asterias, and later disposed
of all of its shares.


4. Subsequent to its divestiture by Geron, the new owner also reported that patients in
AST-OPC1's first Phase 1 trial showed no signs of improvement.


History of stem cell therapies is against AST-OPC1


Proponents of Asterias say that Geron's Phase 1 dosage was too low (only 2 million AST-
OPC1 cells) to show any efficacy and that safety was the primary endpoint, which was
met. They claim higher doses of AST-OPC1 at 10 million or 20 million cells are needed to
show efficacy.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3192796-asterias-biotherapeutics-stem-cell-program-is-dead-on-arrival 5/14


That may be true; however, there's been zero clinical evidence to support this claim. In its
clinical trial, Geron's original study called for an increasing dosage in later cohorts, but as
a result of the initial findings, Geron didn't even move onto the higher dosages. Both
Geron and Asterias have made it clear that AST-OPC1 has failed to show any sign of
efficacy.


Furthermore, we highlight below a list of numerous other stem cell therapies that have
failed. Stem cell therapies have not shown much success. We don't believe investors
should put much faith into AST-OPC1 when it has shown no signs of efficacy in clinical
trials and when multiple other stem cell therapies have failed, either due to lack of efficacy
or due to significant adverse safety effects.


1. NeuralStem - Failed to show efficacy in ASL in its Phase 2 trial (here)
2. Cytori - Phase 2 trials halted due to cerebrovascular events (here)
3. Athersys - Phase 2 studies failed in ischemic stroke (here) and in ulcerative colitis


(here)
4. More stem cell trial failures from 2014 can be found here in this article:


http://celltrials.info/2015/01/04/failures-2014/


It is clear that to us that both its own history and the stem cell field's history are heavily
against AST-OPC1.


Asterias is repackaging old clinical data as new


Moreover, it is worth pointing out that Asterias has not presented any new data or shown
further development of Geron's stem cell portfolio. The recent Investor Meeting that
Asterias held on May 8, 2015 was more or less a review of Geron's previously presented
data on AST-OPC1. Asterias did review the trial design of their current Phase 1/2a clinical
trial of AST-OPC1, which is under way. However, this clinical trial is nearly identical to
Geron's initial Phase 1 conducted in 2010, which Geron terminated mid-way through
because the compound failed to show any signs of efficacy.


On May 14, 2015, Asterias announced the availability of an abstract regarding Phase 2
clinical data on AST-VAC1, which is another of the assets that Asterias acquired from
Geron, in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) (here). However, this long-term follow up
on the trial provided little new information relative to what Geron had presented in 2010 at
ASH. We believe this "update" is completely meaningless given that Asterias has no plans
to further develop AST-VAC1 and admitted on the 1Q 2015 earnings call that they had no
update on a potential partnership (here).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3192796-asterias-biotherapeutics-stem-cell-program-is-dead-on-arrival 6/14


Despite the flurry of news, it's important to dig into the details. We found that:


1. Asterias has been presenting updated data on trials that we believe provides no
meaningful new information.


2. Asterias has not significantly altered the clinical development program for AST-OPC1
from Geron's original development pathway, which Geron abandoned because of a
lack of efficacy.


Ties to BioTime and Low Cash Levels


Finally, we want to highlight two specific risks associated with Asterias. First, Asterias was
created and spun out of BioTime.


As documented in the following two articles (here and here), BioTime has a checkered
history. The first article highlights BioTime's history of failures in stem cell therapies. It also
explains how BioTime has used the creation of numerous subsidiaries like Cell Cure
NeuroSciences, ES Cell International, and OrthoCyte to create short bursts of enthusiasm
to boost BioTime's share price. This is the same path that BioTime is pursuing with
Asterias. The second article highlights how BioTime was the subject of promotional
newsletters that boosted BioTime's share price.


It should also be noted that BioTime has failed to successfully develop and commercialize
any therapy. Over the last 10 years, BioTime has earned just over $23 million in
cumulative revenues, according to FactSet. In the meanwhile, BioTime has lost $143.7
million in net income and burned through $119 million in cash flow from operations. Its
high cash burn has forced BioTime to increase its share count from 17.85 million shares
on March 4, 2005 to over 83.15 million shares as of March 9, 2015 through eight stock
issuances.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3192796-asterias-biotherapeutics-stem-cell-program-is-dead-on-arrival 7/14


This heavy cash burn reflects the second risk that should be noted for Asterias. Based on
the cash balance as of March 31, 2015 and 2015's estimated cash burn of $15 million to
$17 million, as provided by the company here, Asterias is set to run out of cash by the
beginning of September, which is less than five months away.


To no one's surprise, Asterias entered into an ATM (at-the-market issuance sales)
agreement with MLV & Co on April 10, 2015 (here). It was filed in an SEC 8-K filing;
neither BioTime nor Asterias issed a press release announcing that Asterias shareholders
were soon going to be diluted. Given the high cash burn and imminent funding needs,
Asterias shareholders should expect Asterias to withdraw on the ATM very quickly.


Conclusion


We believe Asterias BioTherapeutics is a compelling short. Its lead stem cell compound,
AST-OPC1, had been abandoned by its previous owner after showing no signs of efficacy
in its first Phase 1 trial. Furthermore, Asterias' parent company BioTime has a checkered
past, both with its own development and with its manufactured subsidiaries like Asterias.
Lastly, we believe that it is evident that Asterias is in dire need of capital, which suggests
to us that shareholders should expect significant dilution in the near-term. Our price target
is $0. [we are short this stock]

There are some pretty impressive mutual fund companies invested in AST who have presumably done their

AST initiated with "buy", target set to $22 
May 6, 2015 9:41 AM EDT

May 6 (FlashRatings.com) - Analysts at Lake Street initiate coverage of Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (AST) with a
"buy" rating. The target price is set to $22.


Lake Street notes, "We believe investors have yet to fully appreciate the high barriers and underlying value in the
stem cell technology platform that Asterias has built in regenerative medicine and cancer immunotherapy. The
company has one of the largest intellectual property portfolios in the stem cell space, with more than 400 patents /
patent applications, and its technology is ultimately better-suited to a pharmaceutical business model because of the
ability to centrally produce large quantities of high-quality cells that can be used off-the-shelf - as opposed to
manufactured for each patient from their own cells."

Now this is a really self serving "alpha exposure":


Economics, not science, thwarts embryonic stem cell therapy 
Geron Corp. pulls the plug on its ambitious effort to reverse spinal damage and will focus instead on financially less
risky cancer drugs.


Now without questioning the funding side of the equation (which is not ideal), to say that a ph 1 (with very low cell

This article reflects how scamming individuals or groups can distort the truth to serve their personal financial
gains. Dr. Lebkowski has mentioned in a recent conference call with investors that the cysts have been an
issue for patients who have received 2 million cells in a previous dose going back for years. This is what the
FDA will be examining and NOT the opinion of some ignorant stock players who could care less about the
success of hSECs or patients.

Efficacy is demonstrated with animal models prior to submitting documents to the FDA for clinical trials. It is
NOT what is expected normally in phase I of clinical trials; safety, dose and side effects are what are normally
in the outcome list. After we see the results from 20 million cell doses in a dozen patients, then we will still not
be able to say it does not work, but that it might need an agonist or some combo drug. So, until we see more,
do not believe a bashing report on how it does not WORK. He makes no argument that supports what he
states. INSTEAD, tell the author that his tactics at subverting the value of Asterias will NOT WORK!

Horrible article. Apparently getting FDA approval to go from 2 mil to 20 mil cells and expanding enrollment to give
solid data doesn't constitute a "change" in the new studies. I guess we should count out a treatment that had a "FDA
hold" years ago even though they cleared it now just because it was on hold. They fail to mention their partnership for
funding with CIRM or that they hold BTX. Apparently evidence that the injury site showed signs of improvement with
dosages of 2 million (which were meant for a rat's mass) are meaningless.


18 May 2015, 04:16 PM

A legitimate reason to short would be that BTX owns like 20 million shares of AST now valued at about 200 mill. How
long can BTX sit on that?

NORMALLY phase I clinical trials are not about efficacy. They are about safety and dosing and side effect monitoring.
The earlier trials for hSECs by Geron were about dosing and it continues now; however, the earlier trials, unlike what
you stock manipulators mention, were what has led to increasing or escalating the dose from 2 million cells to 10-20
million cells. That will make a difference!


02 Jun 2015, 11:00 AM


JackSA15
Here' s why your article is a 2-bit read. Remind us about why an FDA hold is a statement about hESCs and not the
FDA? Their filing was the first EVER anywhere for clinical trails with hESCs and that was formidable to anyone with
an IQ above 10. Dr. Jane Lebkowski, formerly with Geron, likely knows about 100 million times what you idiots know
about hESCs, has stated that there are no real issues with the cysts after years of following some patients. (That is
what the FDA will be examining, real data, and not the bunk of stock manipulators.) The earlier trials were done with
very limited numbers of hSECs, as required by the FDA. Early trials are about safety, and dose and staging of the
dose or doses, and NOT about efficacy. It has moved to higher level in clinical trials, and you manipulators FAILED to
inform your readers that the FDA did NOT halt the trials following the initial trials. Also, YOU FAIL to mention its
therapeutic potential for treating multiple sclerosis by regenerating sheaths or remyelination. ---Hey, why be positive,
when scamming the ignorant, eh? There is a way to get them to work, and the proof is in the pudding for anyone with
a little intellect. However, for scammers who wish to play us and the stock, then there is no limit to what they will do to
manipulate the ignorant.


See the results presented at ASCO this week with 11 of 19 patients still in remission after 52 months and then look at
JUNO at $ 53 and ask why AST is only worth 11bucks!

5/18/2018 Asterias Biotherapeutics' Stem Cell Program Is Dead On Arrival - Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NYSEMKT:AST) | Seeking Alpha

I'm in for the very long run. I will find it hard to believe Asterias/BioTime will not find uses for Geron's embryonic stem
cell patents. It's just a matter of time.


It is, however, a shocking drop in such a short time.

Convinced that it is a good time to enter at $4.50

Trying to see thru the haze of "back & forth"? So how do the rest of us "dummies" make sense of the stock and/or this
discussion? The stock shows promise and is a long shot? Given. The science is suspect? Help each other out with
some answers, instead, so much "I am smarter than you" rhetoric!

I read this right after watching a video of an AST-OPC1 10 million cell patient doing an overhead press with about 20-
ish? lbs.

Well AE also wrote an article "Imetelstat Might Be Brought Down By Hy's Law". Yet J&J just yesterday had
Imet as one of its top drugs on their pipeline. So AE got lucky (big deal). OPC1 trial is giving great results (just
like Imet) and eventually will pay off for the long term investors. In the mean time the vultures can short all
they want. It does not affect my long term investment.

True but... look how much shade the author was thrown on this call that took a few years to come to fruition.
The article you reference is just a few months old. Who knows how that will work out but... The call here
(published with stock over $10) to where it is now needs a tip of the hat.
