VirnetX Is Worth Well Under $1 Per Share

Summary


VirnetX stock is nearly worthless.


VirnetX has little hope of generating free cash flow.


VirnetX faces high likelihood of losing new FaceTime infringement suit.


On July 9th 2014, under an article entitled "The VirnetX Tinderbox" we posted the
following comment:


While our timing prediction that a decision would come in the next four weeks was
incorrect, we correctly anticipated that VirnetX (AMEX: VHC) would lose on appeal at the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). At the time we posted this comment, we
did not elaborate on why we felt VirnetX would go to approximately $0, because borrow on
the stock was in short supply and we did not want our cost of borrow to rise nor did we
want our borrowed stock to get called away. Now that borrow availability has eased, we
will elaborate on why we think VHC is worth less than $1 a share.


On September 16th, the CAFC released its decision in "VirnetX, Inc. v. Cisco Systems,
Inc. et al." The judges ruled: "We affirm the jury's findings that none of the asserted claims
are invalid and that many of the asserted claims of the '135 and '151 patents are infringed
by Apple's VPN On Demand product. We also affirm the district court's exclusion of
evidence relating to the reexamination of the patents-in-suit. However, we reverse the
jury's finding that the VPN On Demand product infringes claim 1 of the '151 patent under
the doctrine of equivalents. We also reverse the district court's construction of the claim
term "secure communication link" in the '504 and '211 patents and remand for further
proceedings to determine whether the FaceTime feature infringes those patents under the
correct claim construction. Finally, we vacate the jury's damages award and remand for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 2/32


While this decision caused a 44% decline in the price of VirnetX's stock, we believe the
market is not fully grasping the impact of the decision which reads, "However, we reverse
the jury's finding that the VPN On Demand product infringes claim 1 of the '151 patent
under the doctrine of equivalents. We also reverse the district court's construction of the
claim term "secure communication link" in the '504 and '211 patents and remand for
further proceedings to determine whether the FaceTime feature infringes those patents
under the correct claim construction." Accordingly, any patent involving the term "secure
communications link" must go back to the district court for a new jury trial. This leaves
open the very real likelihood that a new jury determines that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) did
not infringe VirnetX's patents. At the very least, it puts VirnetX in the precarious position of
needing to win in front of a jury again and, even if they win in front of a jury, see that the
next verdict is upheld on appeal in front of the CAFC all over again. Realistically, this
process is likely to take at least another two or three years.


Along with needing to re-try the most important part of their case against Apple, VirnetX
will also need to come up with an entirely new damages theory for the patents that Apple
was found to have infringed. The CAFC ruling tells VirnetX that it cannot use Nash
Bargaining and that it cannot just assign an arbitrary royalty rate to the list price of a
product such as an iPod, iPad, or iPhone. Instead, VirnetX must present the jury with a
credible damages theory based on the actual value of the invention. Investors should
therefore note that the court implicitly blessed using a $29 software upgrade for the Mac
that included FaceTime as one of many features as a potential royalty base. Therefore,
FaceTime (and VPN on Demand) "cost" some fraction of $29. Thus, a jury will need to
determine what percentage of the software upgrade is attributable to FaceTime and VPN
on Demand.


Below we will lay out two hypothetical scenarios to show how meager the royalty VirnetX
receives is likely to be. While being able to charge a royalty on the whole $29 may be
difficult to justify, the CAFC to some extent does seem to endorse the $29 figure (at least
as a starting point, i.e. a maximum for the royalty base), when it said, "Because Apple has
not challenged it, we offer no opinion on whether the $29 software upgrade is itself so
closely related to the patented feature that VirnetX may rely on its entire value in
determining the proper royalty base for the FaceTime feature." Apple does not tell us
exactly how many units were sold in the U.S., but they do say that 39% of their revenue
last year came from the U.S., so we approximated that 39% of units are also sold in the
U.S. With the exception of the $29 for the Mac software upgrade, all numbers are
hypothetical.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 3/32


The table above shows that if VirnetX is able to collect a royalty for both FaceTime and
VPN at a 1% rate, it would achieve $38.5 million in annual revenue. Alternatively, if
VirnetX is unable to prove to a jury that FaceTime infringes its patents, its royalties fall to
just $8.7 million a year.


But VirnetX may find it hard to even achieve 1% since it has signed royalty deals at as low
a rate as 0.24%, as was pointed out in this decision, which stated "Finally, Apple notes
that the sixth license covered sixty-eight VirnetX patents, and was therefore much broader
than the license to four patents Apple would be seeking in the hypothetical negotiation. It
also equated to a 0.24% royalty rate, which is significantly lower than the 1-2% rate
Weinstein testified VirnetX would accept." Therefore, VirnetX receiving 1-2% is not
guaranteed. In a situation where VirnetX only collects a royalty rate of 0.24%, their
hypothetical revenue falls by approximately 75% relative to the scenario outlined above.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 4/32


This would equate to about $10 million if they could collect for both FaceTime and VPN on
Demand. If they can only collect for VPN on demand, this revenue number would fall to
just $3 million.


Now that we have gone through what the CAFC ruled and what this means for VirnetX's
future royalties, we will discuss VirnetX's probable path forward. VirnetX's next step will
likely be to petition for a rehearing and/or a rehearing En Banc at the CAFC. If the En
Banc is denied, which is likely, they will then have 90 days to appeal to the Supreme
Court. If their motion to the Supreme Court is denied, they will then have to make a
strategic decision on whether or not to have a new trial covering infringement by
FaceTime. VirnetX may decide not to have another trial on FaceTime and instead only ask
for a new hearing regarding damages for the patents infringed by VPN on Demand if it is
concerned that it will lose the new infringement trial and such a loss would negatively color
the jury when it goes to debate damages for VPN On Demand. Once VirnetX has a new
trial covering FaceTime infringement, a new damages hearing on infringement by VPN on
Demand, or both, it will receive a jury decision, which the loser will inevitably appeal. Keep
in mind, there is a substantial risk that VirnetX will lose the new trial on FaceTime because
both the VirnetX and Apple experts agreed that FaceTime does not meet the anonymous
requirement that is now part of the definition of a Secure Communications Link. At the end
of the day, it will be years before VirnetX sees any money, if they even see any at all from
FaceTime. This of course leads us to an examination of VirnetX's balance sheet.


VirnetX ended the most recent quarter with $25.7 million in cash compared to the $38.9
million it started the year with. In other words, VirnetX burned $13.2 million in the first half
of 2014. If we carry forward the $13.2 million cash burn in the first half to the full year,
VirnetX will end the year with $12.5 million in cash. Since VirnetX is burning over $26
million a year, ending the year with only $12.5 million puts the company in the position of
needing to do an equity raise before the first half of 2015 ends. We believe VirnetX will do
an equity raise soon so that it can avoid putting in a going concern warning in their SEC
filings, which would be required in the 2014 10-K if the company has less than 1-year of
operating cash on its balance sheet at the time of the 10-K filing.


Before we take the final step of valuing VirnetX, we would be remiss not to bring up two
more points. First, this decision also has ramifications for the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)
case because we now know that VirnetX cannot rely on the same damages theory and
VirnetX will need to construe Secure Communications Link as including both security and
anonymity. We believe that this definition makes infringement unlikely and, in any case,

the inability to use Nash Bargaining makes a large damage award implausible. Second,
Judge Leonard Davis who made the initial rulings in this case will be retiring in May 2015.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the same judge will hear the Apple case again.


If we return to our revenue scenarios, we can see that in a best case, VirnetX only
generates $38.5 million a year and in a worse case, it generates $3 million a year.
Unfortunately, the company's annual expenses last year of $38.9 million are greater than
the royalty base in even a best-case scenario, which means that EPS would be negative.
Even using the $26.4 million expense run-rate from this year means that the company
earns only $0.23 in pre-tax EPS. One last important point with regards to valuation on
future royalty streams is that these patents all expire in October 2018, so future royalty
streams will be limited given the expiration date on the patents. Hence, this 23 cents
would only accrue for about 4-years for a total of less than $1 per share. Of course, with
Apple already having implemented a work around to FaceTime and possibly coming up
with a work around to VPN On Demand, future royalties might end even sooner. With its
cash balance depleted in the next year and no prospects for profits, we value VirnetX at
well under $1 per share.

VPN infringement has been settled by the CAFC. Apple infringes. Only damages need be set in the remanded trial.
Facetime infringement will be retried but apple can't argue that patents are invalid as the CAFC has ruled them valid.

market, they would need to issue 5.25 million shares (before considering any discounts or fees payable to the
underwriters). This is 10.2% of the outstanding shares. Then again, anyone long is stock probably isn't too
good at math.

This may be the most short-sighted bs article I've ever read.  
With the patents now validated, and Apple affirmed to be infringing at least VPNoD, a huge layer of risk is now
removed. It's no longer a question of "if" but a question of how much and when.

Wrong. You are forgetting about Apple's experiences with trying to work around VirnetX's technology. This
cost Apple more than $20 Million per month and Apple's customers were very unhappy. This will all come into
evidence in the second trial as proof of FaceTime infringing VirnetX's technology and as proof for damages. A
jury can easily understand these facts, and Apple will have a hard time avoiding a royalty of $10 Million per
month payable to VirnetX based on these facts alone.

Author’s reply »  The above author's comment regarding an incremental cost of $20mm/month was the
rumored cost to apple of using relay servers for FaceTime instead of the currently used NAT servers. Relay
servers were determined not to infringe in the last trial. Now that the definition of Secure Communications
Link has been changed to include anonymity, FaceTime does not infringe and only VPN On Demand
infringes. All of my commentary above was directed at the prior poster's comments, all of which deal with
FaceTime.

only two claims were sent back for retrial, all other claims the court found apple to have infringed...and that is a final

essentially worthless.


17 Sep 2014, 05:55 PM


The Chairman
FaceTime still infringes 504 & 211. Apple insists that FaceTime does not infringe the “secure communication
link” claim term for two reasons: first, because when properly construed it requires anonymity, which the
FaceTime servers do not provide, and second, because they do not provide “direct” communication, as
required by the district court’s claim construction.


With respect to the first argument Prost construed the disputed claim term so as to require anonymity and
remanded for further proceedings to determine whether Apple’s FaceTime servers provide anonymity.


From pages 14 & 15. 
"With respect to the second argument, Apple argues that FaceTime servers do not provide “direct”
communication because the communications are addressed to a NAT, rather than to the receiving device. The
district court concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the jury’s finding that the NAT routers
used by FaceTime do not impede direct communication, VirnetX, 925 F. Supp. 2d at 831, and we agree. As
the district court noted, VirnetX’s expert testified that the NAT routers still allow for “end-to-end communication
between the two devices,” J.A. 1565, because they merely translate addresses from the public address space
to the private address space, but do not terminate the connection. J.A. 1465, 1536–37. Even Apple’s expert
admitted that the connection does not stop at the NAT routers. J.A. 1984".

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 11/32


"Apple argues that this testimony cannot support a finding of infringement because it is inconsistent with the
court’s claim construction that required “direct addressability.” But the district court considered this argument
and disagreed, noting that its claim construction expressly provided that “routers, firewalls, and similar servers
. . . do not impede ‘direct’ communication,” and VirnetX presented evidence that NATs operate like routers or
firewalls. VirnetX, 925 F. Supp. 2d at 831. Thus, we do not think the district court erred in finding that there
was substantial evidence on which the jury could have relied to reach its finding of infringement on this
element".


It only takes one claim to be proven for infringement not all claims. Apple won the first argument on anonymity
but lost the second argument and are infringing on the claim of Direct Communication Link. The CAFC have
only remanded the first part of the disputed claim term for further proceedings so as to require anonymity. The
second part has been affirmed therefore FaceTime infringes the 504 & 211 patents. End of Story.

Author’s reply »  This is incorrect. A product cannot infringe VHC's patents simply by using a direct
communications link. A product can only infringe by providing secure and anonymous communications via a
direct communications link. Hence, FaceTime does not infringe because it does not meet the limitations of the
patents in question. Frankly, if all a product needed to do to infringe was to establish a direct communication
link, then the telegraph would infringe as far back as the 1800s.

These are actually different claims in the patent so the limitations of one is not linked to the other - they may
be implemented, constructed and argued in court separately - the last one being most important. The issue
that CAFC had was in claims construction itself, not whether Apple infringe the construction per se, CAFC will
not consider anything without proper construction first and that was the CAFC point (the lower court made a
mistake and we are fixing it) and thus it was remanded.


FYI - Apple actually DOES USE Anonymity in Facetime - any engineer will tell you this but pleased do your
own research.


If your argument is that Apple can remove anonymity to be in compliance with a new claims construction?
Then I would technically agree (but only in part) because the second argument still holds true and will be
affirmed - again, in fact all 4 patents were found valid.


Now would Apple do that, is that a practical argument to make? Not very likely because you loose all privacy.
Apple must take privacy seriously, as Tim Cooks recent letter confirms.

I thought the district court decision would be affirmed. I was wrong. The shorts scored here - kudos. I'll get that out of
the way first.


But...Trying to assign a value to VirnetX right now is pointless. It could just as well be worth $30 per share as $1 per
share. However it is definitely not worthless (as in $0 per share) - there are valid patents and Apple has infringed so
ultimately damages will be paid.


That being said - the problems are significant as I see it... 
*Apple can continue to delay, go for jury confusion, appeal and maybe even get a friendlier CAFC panel like Mayer(of
Vringo fame) or a slow poke like Newman, En Banc or SCOTUS - just more delay delay delay. 
*No clue how the smallest salable unit will be defined as it relates to damages but we know Nash, 25%, and EMVR
are out (EMVR because the technology isn't the demand driver). 
*Cash could be an issue for VirnetX 
*Leonard Davis is retiring and he has tried every VirnetX case and knows the technology pretty intimately. On top of
that there is still a vacancy on the CAFC and will probably be an extended vacancy in EDTX after Davis retires thanks
to our politicians - just more delay to gum up the works. 
*Licensing anybody else seems like a long shot at this point given the current situation.


Unless there is some kind of freak unexpected settlement I think VirnetX shareholders are in for a long roller coaster
ride with short sellers taking full advantage of the uncertainty (just like the last 2 years). So many unknowns.

Of course I could be all wet - just like I was thinking there would be a full affirmation.


Good luck however you choose to play this one.

Author’s reply »  The path to this being worth $30 is about a 1 in a billion probability in my opinion. The stock
can easily be worth $0 if the company continues to generate less in revenue then it has in expenses. That's
how companies go bankrupt. I expect to cover my short at about $0.50 per share or lower.

After CAFC ruling and share price dump, it seems trying to read into the minds of Prost and Chen was akin to
predicting an outcome from reading the tea leaves in a cup. Prost did a hatchet job on damages and tossed
FaceTime infringement under a truck.. and what did Chen do?.. no dissent so he was in full agreement with
Prost's hatchet job.. no third judge needed. The overall resulting outcome turned out to be the complete
opposite to what you were alluding to in your article last month. It seems to me when people are so absolutely

Kendall Larsen and team VirnetX clearly took a hit to the jaw. But it is by no means a knockout punch. IPR's are now
no threat, their patents are declared valid and we will see what Apple will have to pay when the fight is over and it ain't
over yet by any stretch of the imagination....There is an incredible amount of value to their patents and an even
greater amount of talent amassed in the VirnetX team of highly ethical professionals that make up VirnetX. Unlike the
slippery lying and conniving thieves they are forced to recon with which they will reckon with in the end.

It's really funny to see how a piece with facts becomes a "hit piece". VHC longs have been drinking Kool-Aid for a
long time, while paying salaries of lawyers and corporate big-wigs. I have no position on VHC but it is as ugly as it
gets when you try to tell perma-bulls of VHC that they are wrong and they are investing on hope, rather than facts.
Not even court rulings makes them see things clearely and with objection.

VHCSCOTT, Contributor
This article was written by an admitted short-seller to induce panic in the longs, and panic is not warranted here. The
CAFC did not direct that VHC was only entitled to a 1% royalty on a $29 base. VirnetX will merely have to be more
thorough in the evidence it presents in support of damages at a second trial. Ironically, the CAFC created a good road
map for VirnetX to follow in the Apple v. Motorola case.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 15/32


Additionally, there are many more ways to measure damages, including the value of the patented technology to the
infringer. In VirnetX's case, the evidence of how much it cost Apple to do a workaround and the consumer complaints
this work-around engendered will come into evidence at a second trial. Apparently, this work-around cost Apple more
than $20 Million per month, and was very unsatisfactory to Apple's customers. These facts indicate that VirnetX's
technology is worth more than $20 Million per month to Apple. A royalty of more than $10 Million per month seems in
order. Does anyone believe that someone would buy an iPhone without proper security that actually works?


The bottom line is that VirnetX merely has a proof problem that is not particularly hard to satisfy from a technical legal
standpoint now that we know what the CAFC expects.

Taking a step back in terms of value of VPN + Facetime to apple: 
Facetime was used in almost all ads when iphone / ipad launched. It was their premier feature. VPN on
demand is an absolute requirement in corporate markets which represents Apples highest iphone domestic
growth area.

This had been a binary situation with a very high short interest... something that I would generally avoid... but that is
no longer the case. The damages have been vacated along with the most promising damage theories - clearly
reducing the size and increasing the uncertainty of any potential reward for shareholders. Additionally the time frame
for any potential payment has become significantly longer and less certain. Finally, with ~19M shares trading in the
past two days, the short interest is likely far smaller than the 17M disclosed at the end of August.


In my opinion, this ice cube is going to melt.


17 Sep 2014, 07:03 PM


VHCSCOTT, Contributor
Among the most promising damage theories will be the evidence that Apple attempted to work around
VirnetX's technology and could not find a commercially feasible way to do this. It cost Apple more than $20
Million per month and Apple encountered tremendous dissatisfaction from its customers. These are all very
easily understood facts that will be deadly to Apple in a second trial. A $10 Million per month royalty is easily
supported by these facts. Consequently, there is a very good chance VirnetX gets a much bigger judgment at
a second trial.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 16/32


The short interest current trend has changed, see shortanalytics.com, and shortsqueeze.com lags as you
point out, it says 17.4M +- as of today. I believe that does not include the possible naked shorts that have
been asserted to exist.


The damage theories are affected by this decision - a possible take on the remand consistent with this opinon
direction Prost and Chen issued is at page 29 of the opinion. However, this is in the opinion section on "Jury
Instruction" beginning at page 26, it may be necessary for those new to this to review the oral argument
exchange on the jury instruction to fully understand so that as an investor you have done a due diligence
effort:


Where the smallest salable unit is, in fact, a multi-component product containing several non-infringing
features with no relation to 
the patented feature (as VirnetX claims it was here), the 
patentee must do more to estimate what portion of the 
value of that product is attributable to the patented.


The legal cites are to the Cornell case, the first mention of smallest salable unit, which Prost and Chen at
page 29 of the opinion, convey the smallest salable unit concept as follows:


as where the district court noted that, 
rather than pursuing a “royalty base claim encompassing 
a product with significant non-infringing components,” 
the patentee should have based its damages on “the 
smallest salable infringing unit with close relation to the 
claimed invention.” 609 F. Supp. 2d at 287–88 (emphasis 
added). (NOTE - the emphasis added by Prost and Chen is to "with close relation to the claimed invention.)


The additional direction is at page 30 of the opinion where they cite Unisplay,S.A. v. Am. Elec. Sign Co., 69
F.3d 512, 517 (Fed. Cir.n 1995.) 
I urge all to cobble the two together to determine what consistent with this opinion means in terms of
preserving the integrity of the general rule and the exception.


It does take a bit to wrap your mind about it, but it is the nature of the complexity inherent in this dispute.
Michael Lewis, through the character Zoran Perkov.


Zoran mused that people, likely through heurtistics, think "complex is an advanced state of complicated. It's
not. A car key is simple. A car is complicated. A car in traffic is complex."


The traffic complexity here is that Prost and Chen, through the jury instruction have bent the arc of patent
damage in some way, however, not as determinative as you assert, because they did not rule on the
damages, remand in this sense means to reconstruct and reform, and with that done Prost and Chen have
merely nudged the ground rules to allay the fear that without doing so "the jury’s verdict was tainted by the
erroneous jury instruction." See page 30 of the opinion.


Please understand the above is not predictive on my part, it is descriptive in nature. The whole thing is still in
traffic.

Another obvious hit piece that is easily rebutted:


<<Accordingly, any patent involving the term "secure communications link" must go back to the district court for a new
jury trial. This leaves open the very real likelihood that a new jury determines that Apple did not infringe VirnetX's
patents.>>


Wrong and Mischaracterization. Only the 2 patents involving Facetime and only their application to Facetime have to
go back for a new trial on infringement. Regardless of what the jury decides about Facetime, Apple will be deemed to
have infringed upon VHC's patents via Secure VPN which was upheld by CAFC.


<<Investors should therefore note that the court implicitly blessed using a $29 software upgrade for the Mac that
included FaceTime as one of many features as a potential royalty base.>>


Wrong. CAFC specifically stated that it was not passing any judgment on the use of $29 as a royalty base for iOS
products. It did not even say that it was ok to use $29 for MacOs. The royalty base will be different for every product,
Mac, iTouch, iPad, iPhone, etc... Thus, it is IMPOSSIBLE for iOS products to have a $29 base because there is no
evidence to support doing that.


<<But VirnetX may find it hard to even achieve 1% since it has signed royalty deals at as low a rate as 0.24%, as was
pointed out in this decision, which stated "Finally, Apple notes that the sixth license covered sixty-eight VirnetX
patents, and was therefore much broader than the license to four patents Apple would be seeking in the hypothetical
negotiation. It also equated to a 0.24% royalty rate, which is significantly lower than the 1-2% rate Weinstein testified
VirnetX would accept." Therefore, VirnetX receiving 1-2% is not guaranteed.>>


This is where the author loses all credibility. In the sentences that followed the cited sentence, the CAFC said the use
of the other licenses was appropriate and the 1-2% royalty rate that Weinstein came up with was supported by
adequate evidence. VHC will not get less than a 1% royalty rate in the new trial because the Court approved the 1-2%
range.


<<there is a substantial risk that VirnetX will lose the new trial on FaceTime because both the VirnetX and Apple
experts agreed that FaceTime does not meet the anonymous requirement that is now part of the definition of a
Secure Communications Link.>>


Blatant misrepresentation. If that were the case, the CAFC would have reversed entirely and not remanded for further
proceedings to determine if Facetime infringes based on the new claim construction.

Alpha Exposure, first your math is wrong and second your opinion is very biased and ignore the affirmations that can
not be appealed further.


In the interest of full disclosure and full transparency may I ask if you sought any professional legal opinions before
you wrote your article? Please answer that directly because I am curious where and how your opinion was forged? No
harm, if it's just your opinion but I am curious how you can ignore the affirmations in this case in terms of ACTUAL
LAW.


For example your emphasis on CAFC argument 1 regarding the 504 and 211 and the decision by CAFC on a new
claims construction for the term "secure communications link" BUT you ignore the second argument (and about 4
other claims) "direct communication link" that was ruled in VHC's favor on the same patents - the 504 and 211 for the
Facetime application? VHC need only one claim. How could you miss that?


Apple still infringe (maybe not as much) IF they can prove to the lower court they use zero anonymity on FT (which
they factually could but do not use for good reason - security). However it would be funny to see Apple argue that they
do not infringe because Facetime DOES NOT provide anonymity, meaning LESS security . Think about it. I am sure
VHC will have neoguh money to make a few phone calls to industry peers :-)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2502575-virnetx-is-worth-well-under-1-per-share 22/32


Alpha ... Facetime is a MASSIVE user application for Apple and VHC may now compel the court to force Apple to
show how many users actually do FT everyday (this could get worse for Apple on FT because more people use it now
than 4 years ago). Alpha my contacts tell me ITS A HUGE NUMBER. I have an iPhone for personal use and I know
use it at least three times each weak for family FT, in fact I like that I can do that on my private phone not business
phone. Do you use it?


I do not care if you are long or short (thats just the game) but what you write is a reflection of you and you ignore the
ACTUAL laws in terms of infringement (not damages - we all know that story - more testimony - more delays - it sucks
- and I do not disagree) but the story got bigger for VHC ... Apple IS STILL INFRINGING, as affirmed by the second
highest court in the land and I do not think SCOTUS would hear this case. Yet you are talking about an En Banc
hearing for VHC???? Why would they seek that - especially when CAFC agree on the RR based on a 1% license -
basically a FRAND deal.


Please be fair and clarify your comments. Thanks.

Regarding Direct Communications Link, please see my response above. Apple's FaceTime does not infringe
because the patent limitations are not met.

Alpha Exposure, there is no need to be rude with snide comments like "duh" and I suggest you take a look at
the forest not the proverbial (Apple) tree. :-) (excuse the pun).


1. Your math is still wrong.


2. Take another look or seek a second legal opinion on what it really means when a CAFC court re-affirms
and validates not only the patents but multiple claims of infringement against a giant corporation. Yes, Apple
bought some time on damages (I give you that) BUT that is not what mattered the most to Apple This entire
case is just a blip on their balance sheet. What matters now is they still infringe on many claims and all 4
patents are VALID. Do you honestly think this is helpful for their future lawsuits. Do you honestly believe that
VHC can't afford to make a few phone calls explaining what CAFC just validated - especially to Apple
competitors. I bet VHC is already on the phone for things like VPN on Demand and SDNI - both are very
useful and will greatly reduce security threat vectors like "man in the middle" attacks - a massive issue for
websites today. You see no value in VHC? Can you say you honestly believe that or are you just a FUDer.


3. My comments on Face Time and the 504 and 211 still hold true, the infringement limitation on the first
argument must be re-heard because of claims construction (I agree and thats what CAFC said) but that does
not mean that the second argument on direct communications link is invalid - it was in fact affirmed. Can you

NEVER do)?


As I said before, yes Apple gets more time, but VHC still have 24 months of operating cash including capped
future legal expenses. The burn is a million a month WITHOUT trying to raise money - thats 2 more years
with 0 revenue - plenty of time.


Think about it and keep an eye on the second Apple case. In my experience Apple will settle this, neither

b. toe
I have been wondering about a couple of things, and I do not recall having seen the topics discussed:


(1) Does VirnetX have the option of basing damages on lost profits? The patent exclusivity should have entitled the
company to 100% of the profits from selling a software package/service that implements the technology--with no
competition, assuming that companies such as Apple had refrained from infringing. VirnetX is no longer able to sell
that service because Apple has basically been giving their technology away for free.


(2) I have seen references to a 1-2% rate, which presumably corresponds to a FRAND rate. This puzzles me. Why
does VirnetX have ANY obligation to license at that low a rate? Did they make an SEP commitment at some point in
the past, to license for others to use? And if they have not made such a commitment in the past, how can they be
compelled to license to infringers at a low rate that is typical of VOLUNTARY licensing?


Anybody have an idea of the answers to those issues? Thanks in advance.

for Nokia's patents that were far less important for future development) and will most probably offer a nice piece of

Another look by CHINABOB ON IV - ON 4GE LTE COUPLED WITH PATENT VALIDITY,


START OF CHINABOB: 
VHC at $50 per share today


The shorts are at it again. Around the close they posted a piece on Seeking Alpha indicating that VHC value is less
than $1 per share. This is ludicrous. They have been successful in bringing the price down in after hours trading to
$7.10. I don’t know how much lower they will be successful in bringing the price down but in my very humble opinion
the stock has a much larger value than the current price per share.


Please, please do not make any investment decisions on what I am about to say. I only make the following statement
to give you something for comparison and possibly a different perspective.


At $7.00 per share VHC has a market cap of around 350 Million. At the very, very least with the CAFC decision VHC
in my opinion is worth $50 per share. You ask, WHAT KIND OF NUTS ARE YOU CHINABOB?


The CAFC confirmed that VHC’s 135, 151, 211 and 504 patents are not invalid. This adds significant strength to these
patents. It puts others on notice that the patents are good. Secondly, the CAFC ruled that Apple was infringing the
patents in regards to VPN. This is huge, it has been proven by the district court and Affirmed by the Appeal Court that
APPLE IS INFRINGING ON VHC’S PATENTS.


You say, yeah but the CAFC vacated the damage judgment and it could be some time before VHC has significant
revenues. This is true and it may take another six months or so to sort this all out but just remember the Appeal Court
Affirmed that APPLE IS INFRINGING ON VHC’S PATENTS.


Why do I keep repeating that? Because that has to do with my minimum $50 per share valuation. Why so?
Companies like Samsung, Google, Microsoft individually or collectively would love to have VHC’s Affirmed Patents in

their portfolio, then you add the kicker of Apple’s infringing. These companies buy smaller companies for 2.5 Billion on
a somewhat regular basis, i.e Microsoft recent purchase of Mojang, Minecraft.


Where could they buy cheaper insurance for 4G LTE Essential Patents than for one of the above mentioned
companies to pay 2.5 Billion for VHC which amounts to $50 per share. Samsung is in a fierce battle with Apple, what
would VHC’s patents do for them. Could they twist the tail of Apple if they owned VHC’s patents?


Make no mistake, I believe the long term value of VHC is much higher than $50 per share but I only post this to give a
different perspective than the ridiculous low valuation the shorts are attempting to put on the stock. I believe that I
have a much better argument for $50 per share than Seeking Alpha has for $1 per share.


You decide.


CHINABOB -30-


Dale Korpi comments - The author in this article and CHINABOB create a wide range. CHINABOB incorporates more
than the Apple patents it is still not dispositive. The present state of Virnetx's claim construction challenge on "secure
communication" as well as parsing the damages consistent with the Prost and Chen direction. (Their direction seems
to pivot on their cite to Unisplay, 
S.A. v. Am. Elec. Sign Co., 69 F.3d 512, 517 (Fed. Cir. 1995).


Prost and Chen therefore are changing the arc of damage theory but the heavy lift on burden of proof with more
stringent apportionment proof shifts to the plaintiff. 
Case Western Law review that provides historical context of the present damage theories and apportionment
evidence, quite critical to the task that Virnetx now faces, the eminent Judge Rader is granted a cameo for his
comments in Red Hat.


If you are long, short or neutral this is your due diligence, to make your assessment of $1 or $50.

Thank you to the author of this article. I took a flyer on this when it initially dropped. In 500 shares at $7.73, watched it
climb to just under $9, then watched it drop and sold those shares at $7.96 for a tiny profit of $125. Then re-entered
with 600 shares at $7.63 and held overnight. I saw a poster on the Yahoo VHC message board referencing this article
so I came here this morning and read it in the pre-market hours. You provided much more information than the
company response and the brief news stories that came out yesterday. I immediately sold, getting out at $6.31, for a
$800 loss. About $675 loss total for my two round trips. Glad I came here. Thanks for the insights and detailed info.
Saved me about $1.80*600 so far!

Fair value is less than $100M and shares should be $1 or less.


You Bulls should have sold at $7 when the news broke and took the 50% loss. Today your loss is 75%. Hold a few
more days and your loss will be 90%.


The key to investing is knowing when to fold LOSERS. Its time to fold.

Beyond the risky court bets $VHC has one thing - patents. how come there is no discussion of the value of the entire
portfolio. There is definitely a market and they have some very strong 4G patents - that alone should provide value.


18 Sep 2014, 12:03 PM


Dale Korpi
sonic,


Gabriel also exists as a product and as to the 4G LTE see the Investor Village post today by CHINABOB.


Cash does spend, no matter generated from value derived from a service/product company or a NPE.


The valuation of a TESLA is quite elusive at this time - faith is necessary to pay so much now for current
revenue and car production. It may never obtain the scale.


In this case, demand is present for VPN and secure communication, the problematic for Virnetx now lies in
satisfying the Prost and Chen take on apportionment. It does game the damage theory in favor of risk takers
who chose to ignore prior art. A Case Western Law article on the same is on the freelibrary to carry out your
own due diligence.


The interesting admission against interest (not legal but as to consumers) by Apple is that Facetime is not a
secure communication as it lacks one end. Not a quality user experience on Apple's part.

VHC should be over $20 after the ruling. Rather than listening to someone who has written a hit piece to drive the
stock price down, read the CAFC ruling. The CAFC validated VHC's patents and also validated that Apple infringes
those patents. Using the method that CAFC is clearly recommending in their ruling which is quoted below, Apple's
royalty is likely to increase significantly.


“With those principles in mind, we conclude that the district court here did not abuse its discretion in permitting
Weinstein to rely on the six challenged licenses. To begin with, four of those licenses did indeed relate to the actual
patents-in-suit, while the others were drawn to related technology. Moreover, all of the other differences that Apple
complains of were presented to the jury, allowing the jury to fully evaluate the relevance of the licenses. See J.A.
1600, 1650, 1678–82. No more is required in these circumstances.”


There are 6 companies that have royalty agreements with an average in excess of 1.5%. That is far more than the
original award of .5%. Apple did Virnetx a favor appealing the ruling, they will now get a higher rate. You better cover
your short position quickly or you might get trampled as investors recognize the real value of Virnetx.

Apple will just appeal the ruling. 
Then appeal again. 
And again. 
And again. 
And again.


Eventually VHC will run out of money or settle with Apple. Either way this stock is not worth even close to
$20.


18 Sep 2014, 02:17 PM


Dale Korpi
Richard,


I agree that does cover the royalty rate, but the royalty base still presents a challenge for all NPEs given the
shift to apportionment (see not only the opinion but the Case Western Law Review article as well) in damage
theory.


Prost and Chen, to their credit, nudged it to this through their ruling on the second part of Judge Davis's jury
instruction. The effect was they allowed the infringement decision to stand but chose to have a redo on the
claim construction on secure communication, as the author has aptly pointed out.


Number crunch time is appropriate for the possible permutations/combinations as the case may be.

This was a solid article. Perhaps skewed to the downside, but the golden goose that was Apple is now gone. VHC will
get some money after several years but the cost of litigating Apple again is not worth the revenue it will generate for
the company. It's a losing proposition.


VHC needed this trial in order to sell at a premium or fund future litigation. Now cash burn is a real concern and all
potential Licensees have little pressure to sign a License with a company who may not be a going concern in the near
future.


If VHC were to really look at its current strategy objectively it just doesn't make sense to proceed with this litigation. I
think they have little choice but to move forward at this point due to market's perception. Inevitably they will need to
get more money.


More downside is sure to come but long-term prospects remain possible via LTE-A. That is their only saving grace.


Rational investors will look at current PPS and will find a narrative to short (you just read it and it is very convincing).

Alpha, kudos on actually publishing an article on VHC. Just in case you haven't realized it yet, you are going up
against some seriously messed-up-in-the-head investors, complete with conspiracy theories about whos in bed with
whom.


What I will point out here, regardless of the merits of the infringement claims, is that with VHC's damage constructions
thrown out the chances of them being able to create a new construction that meets the higher court's requirements
and award them anywhere near what they had in the last round are pretty close to zero. IMHO, I really doubt they
could get more than $80M or so now (and I think it would be closer to $10-15M) even if they were to win. And I think
those investors who are not completely off their rockers probably understand this.

This isn't even counting the absurdity of the patents in the first place. VPNs and encryption have been in use, over the
internet, for over 30 years. From my perspective, 'on-demand' is no different from starting up a SSH tunnel which one
has been able to do on bsd/unix/linux systems for a very long time. Those of us who actually write code for a living
kinda scratch out heads at just how screwed up the patent office is. Legalities aside, I think at least the Supreme court
is finally recognizing the absurdity of these sorts of lawsuits. I expect Apple will litigate this all the way to that body
and that it will be the end of VHC when they do.


Frankly, I don't know why anyone would want to invest in VHC in the first place. They bleed capital... only their top
exec and their lawyers are actually making any money. They don't give a damn about the quality of the patents they
use to litigate. They depend on the broken patent system to extort money from other companies. For these sorts of
people, shareholders are going to be dead last on their list of people they care about. That much is obvious just by
reading through the financials. How any investor could possibly believe otherwise is beyond my understanding.

appellate courts only rule on whether the correct legal definitions and procedures where followed correctly
and even though the courts do offer advice on the proper procedure ie. the bargaining rule, the doctrine of
equivalents, etc.. there has to be another trial to determine the facts of whatever the appellate vacated and
reversed back to the district court.


 
for all we know this thing could go to retrial, they get a billion bucks(obviously hyperbole)


a midst all the legal speak and opinion from the appellate court all we really know is that the damages are
going to be reassessed, but the rest of the opinion here is really speculation because even though the
appellate judge offers words on the subject a complete different methodology must be used to asses the
damages and I am not involved in the case and don't know what counter point or different method of valuing
the damages will be, no one here knows what the ultimate number will be or how they will be arrive at that
number. 
I'm sure case law offers some guidance but someone else can look it up, but no two cases are the same

Confusion in determining appropriate royalties just opens the door to increased legal and delays. Apple may have
accepted this as the master plan in handling VHC for the future.


Still I take some comfort in knowing certain Patent Assertion Entities wont face this battle, like Worlds, Inc. WDDD
whose Markman hearing is next month. Worlds owns the patents covering 3-d Multiplayer game play (MMORPG).


When it comes to determining that patents value, for infringement, one only needs to examine the retail box of the
latest Activision Blizzard CALL OF DUTY. Nicely placed on the spine is the MULTIPLAYER ONLINE Stamp. Not a
feature you have to buy, but the reason you buy it.


VHC will eventually win, not before a very long expensive and protracted legal engagement consumes a large portion
of their capital.
