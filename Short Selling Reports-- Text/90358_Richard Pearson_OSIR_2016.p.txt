Summary


Short Ideas Healthcare


Aggressive channel stuffing resulting in inflated revenues is now becoming obvious
– but is about to end.


Past analysis has focused on multiple “accounting irregularities”, new information
raises questions of outright fraud.


Recorded statements from the CEO may prove to be the “smoking gun” which led
to an auditor resignation.


Osiris has now just lost its largest customer, which was bought by competitor
MiMedx.


I expect the stock to trade to around $2-$3, down 70%-80% based on either
substantial restatements or an auditor resignation.

Author's note on use of the word "fraud"


As of this writing, I currently have over 3,200 followers on Seeking Alpha. These readers
have no doubt come to realize that I tend to cover shorting opportunities where
companies are doing something wrong. I do not simply focus on overvalued stocks. But
readers should also be aware that I very seldom ever use the word "fraud" even when
there are many red flags which might otherwise justify such use. I am very careful with
using the word "fraud".


The last time I came out and used the word "fraud" was when I wrote about ForceField
Energy (NASDAQ:OTC:FNRG). The stock had been trading at around $7.80, but
cratered by nearly 30% on the day of my article. This prompted the company to issue a
forceful response against me. The company promised a full business update and
rebuttal for the following Monday. By Monday, the stock was down by a full 60% and the
only update the company could provide was that the chairman of ForceField had been
arrested by the FBI at the airport in Miami while trying to flee the country. The stock was
immediately halted. It has since resumed trading at around 1-2 cents. Down 99%.

Even while the stock was halted, we can see that there were numerous retail investors
posting comments in support of ForceField at the bottom of my article. Those investors
would have clearly lost around 99% of their money by refusing to get out of an obvious
fraud.


I would strongly encourage readers of this article to read those positive comments at the
bottom of my article on ForceField. I expect to see similar positive comments on Osiris. I
also expect that those who are still supporting Osiris in the face of very obvious
problems are about to be sorely disappointed

There are two points to be made here. First, I only use the word "fraud" when I see
something egregiously wrong with a company. Second, when a fraud comes unraveled,
the implosion is often swift and brutal and provides little to no opportunity to get out.
With thousands of other stocks to own out there, there is simply no reason to hold on to
a stock that has even a hint of fraud about it.


Background on Osiris Therapeutics


There are many existing red flags on Osiris. The CFO has already resigned and been
replaced. The auditor (BDO) has also resigned and been replaced. Internal accounting
controls have already been deemed to be ineffective. Research analysts have switched
from "buy" to "sell". The company's receivables DSO ("Days Sales Outstanding")
balance has exploded to over 130 days, despite assurances from the company that it
should be declining. There are blatant inconsistencies between various SEC filings, as
well as inconsistencies between statements made by management and information
contained in filings. These appear to have led to the auditor's resignation. We can also
see that Osiris' largest competitor is publicly calling into question the supposed
revenues being generated by Osiris using independent market data.


Former auditor BDO first required multiple restatements of past financials due to
improper recognition of revenue. The auditor then took the highly unusual step of
requiring Osiris to begin recognizing certain revenues on a "cash basis", only once
actual cash had been received. Osiris' newly appointed CFO assured us that the
damage was done and there would be no more issues. Shortly thereafter, auditor BDO
resigned altogether. Osiris didn't disclose the resignation of its auditor for a full week,
and then only disclosed the resignation once a new auditor had been appointed. This
limited the damage to the stock price.


But prior to the resignation, the auditor also required some new disclosure:


On occasion, customers purchase product and request that the Company store
the purchased product in segregated freezers at the Company's facility.


In other words, the supposedly "sold" product is not even being delivered to the
customer.

Moreover, we know from the company's receivables disclosure that most of the product
is sold on very generous extended payment terms.


So what the disclosure above means is this: in certain circumstances, no product
changes hands AND no money changes hands, yet Osiris still recognizes
revenues from supposed product sales.


Such an arrangement is downright absurd. Osiris is merely manufacturing
revenues when no sales are actually occurring in reality.


The tip off about these irregularities is that Osiris' DSO balance now exceeds 130 days.
This is more than double the average of competitors and is well in excess of what even
Osiris itself considers to be delinquent payment by its customers. Osiris discloses that
payments which are due more than 45 days are considered delinquent. So it is safe to
say that the majority of receivables are delinquent.


If we had no more information than that above, Osiris would be a very attractive short
candidate. Osiris has appointed Big 4 auditor E&Y in an attempt to instill confidence with
investors. But as we have seen in the past (examples provided below), when troubled
companies appoint Big 4 auditors, these auditors are even more likely to uncover
problems, and are just as quick to resign. Based on the analysis below, I see very little
chance that Osiris will be able to issue its annual 10-K filing. I fully expect E&Y to
become aware of the problems below and to resign before the annual report is due. Or
at a minimum, there will be further substantial restatements.


Osiris has $43 million in cash (about $1.23 per share) and does generate some
revenue (but almost no profit). As a result, the stock is not likely to be a true
"zero". Instead we should expect the stock to trade at around $2-$3 based on
restatements or auditor resignation.


What does Osiris do?


Osiris produces three types of human tissue products. The company's main product is
Grafix, which is basically frozen tissue derived from donated human placentas. The
product is used for wound care, including burns and diabetic foot ulcers. Osiris does not
disclose the breakdown of its product sales, but analysts estimate that 90%-95% of
revenues come from the sale of Grafix alone.

Osiris also produces a cartilage allograft known as Cartiform, which accounts for
minimal sales.


Finally, the company produces a bone allograft which is currently known as BIO4. The
bone allograft was originally produced using placental membranes and was known as
Ovation. But the FDA ruled against the production of Ovation and required Osiris to stop
producing and marketing the product. Rather than destroy the remaining inventory,
Osiris took a very unusual step. Osiris handed all remaining inventory to several
distributors and told them to simply pay for it once they could eventually sell it. So even
though the FDA ruled against it, Osiris found a way to keep selling the product.


Since that time, Osiris has made substantial changes to the bone allograft product. It is
now made from bone tissue rather than from placental tissue. The new product is known
as BIO4.


A closer look at Stability Biologics


As part of my due diligence, I began identifying and contacting multiple distributors who
do business with Osiris. The largest of these is Stability Biologics. As will be shown
below, there is considerable uncertainty as to just how much business Stability actually
does with Osiris. This is due to blatant inconsistencies within Osiris' SEC filings.


But in any event, Stability was most recently listed in the 10-Q as being responsible for
11% of Osiris' revenues. And we can see that Stability was just bought by MiMedx
(MDXG), creating a gaping revenue hole for Osiris.


It also means that the past channel stuffing must now come to an abrupt end, with
revenues set for a steep drop.


We know that Stability was Osiris' largest customer because it is the only one that Osiris
discloses in its SEC filings. But we quickly run into problems quantifying it. This is
because the SEC filings from quarter to quarter provide wildly differing numbers - even
for the identical quarters.


In Q1 of 2014, Osiris claimed that Stability accounted for fully 58% of its revenues that
quarter. But if we then look at the 10-Q for 2015 (which shows revenues from Q1 2015
and Q1 2014) we can see that Osiris now says that in Q1 of 2014 (i.e. the same exact
quarter), Stability only accounted for 15% of revenues.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3812496-osiris-aggressive-channel-stuffing-accounting-irregularities-outright-fraud 7/30


Here is the text from each 10-Q:


From the 1Q 2014 10-Q (page 10):


During the first fiscal quarters of fiscal 2014 and 2013, revenues from one of the
distributors of our Biosurgery products, Stability Biologics, comprised approximately
58% and 64%, respectively, of our total Biosurgery product revenues.


From the 1Q 2015 10-Q (page 11):


During the first fiscal quarters of fiscal 2015 and 2014, revenues from one of the
distributors of our Biosurgery products, Stability Biologics, comprised approximately
13% and 15%, respectively, of our total Biosurgery product revenues.


Something is clearly very wrong with the sales that supposedly went to Stability. This is
most likely one of the factors which led to the resignation by BDO.


Why did auditor BDO resign from Osiris?


Concurrent with the release of its 3Q 2015 financials, Osiris announced that it was
restating past financial results for multiple quarters because there was


lack of sufficient evidence of the contractual arrangements to satisfy the applicable
auditing standards, which is necessary to recognize revenue on an accrual basis
under GAAP.


In short, Osiris was improperly recognizing revenues. Simple as that.


On the quarterly conference call, Piper analyst Ted Tenthoff asked:


should we anticipate any other changes during the quarter or does this pretty much
bring this issue to a close?


New CFO Greg Law responded that:


It's bringing the issue to a close.


While CEO Dr. Lode Debrabandere stated that:

Remember Ted that we absolutely discontinue duration in 2014, so that will cost a
very, very vast kind of sound observation and so that makes it all come to a
closure and be done with it.


But it wasn't done. Not by any means. In fact, things were about to get much
worse.


Just a few days later, Osiris released an 8-K noting that auditor BDO had now deemed
its internal controls to be ineffective. Details of this change were analyzed by author
Edward Vranic in his own article.


As of this time, BDO was continuing to raise serious concerns but had not yet resigned.


But then the company presented at a Canaccord conference and was questioned by
several audience members on receivables. The audio for this conference can be found
here.


First, new CFO Greg Law sought to reassure the conference that there would be no
more restatements, stating:


So are we done? I believe we are done.


But it was the statements made by the CEO (at approximately 8:50 into the audio)
that likely led to the swift resignation of auditor BDO.


In response to a question on receivables, CEO Dr. Lode Debrabandere stated that:


For example, PhysioRx, we have publicly stated that we booked $1.1 million in the
fourth quarter of 2014. Of that, $1.1 million, $800,000 has been received already in
cash, and the remaining $300,000 is expected before this year end. So, that is pretty
much done. There is still a $0.7 million order out there of PhysioRx from the first
quarter. And then there is the Stability acquisition of Ovation from the 4th quarter of
2014 that makes up to the about $7 million total.


These comments are crucial and are most likely what led to the resignation of
auditor BDO.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3812496-osiris-aggressive-channel-stuffing-accounting-irregularities-outright-fraud 9/30


So what the CEO is telling us is that there is about $1 million of receivables coming in
from PhysioRx and at least $6 million coming in from Stability.


But we can see from the most recent 10-Q that Stability only accounts for 2% of
accounts receivable, just $757,000. So what Osiris has already disclosed to investors
($757,000) is nowhere near the level which is being stated by the CEO (at least $6
million).


These amounts come from a single distributor and amount to at least 10% of the
revenue which Osiris reported to-date in 2015.


The statements regarding Stability are wildly at odds with what Osiris discloses in its
SEC filings. Within a few days of these statements from the CEO, auditor BDO suddenly
resigned. (Despite the repeated assurances from the CEO and CFO that we were
"done" with accounting issues.)


Appointing a new auditor


When a troubled company appoints a Big 4 auditor, it should actually be viewed as more
cause for concern than cause for relief. We have seen this consistently around the world
in China, the US and Japan.


Back in 2010 and 2011, there was a wave of auditor resignations among US listed
Chinese companies. Even the companies which had not yet faced an auditor resignation
still faced a crisis of confidence and plunging share prices.


As a result, a number of these companies sought to reassure investors by appointing
Big 4 auditors. The ruse worked for a few months and the share prices soared - even
though a number of these companies were entirely fraudulent.


But what happened was that ultimately the Big 4 auditors were even more stringent that
their smaller predecessors and when it came time to put out a 10-K, the Big 4 auditors
found even more problems and simply refused to sign off.


We saw this repeatedly on Chinese companies including Wonder Automotive (formerly
WATG) where newly appointed PWC resigned, Subaye (formerly SBAY) where newly
appointed PWC resigned and Duoyuan Printing (formerly DYP) where newly appointed
Deloitte resigned.

We have also seen similar "upgrades" followed by auditor resignations with US
companies. This includes EBIX (EBIX) and Advanced Emissions (ADES) which
upgraded to KPMG only to have them resign. We saw the same thing with NATURE S
SUNSHINE (NATR) in the US when E&Y resigned.


In Japan, we saw the same with Olympus (OTCPK:OCPNF) and Toshiba
(OTCPK:TOSBF) in the wake of their fraud scandals.


The point is that former auditor BDO suddenly found ample problems to justifying
resigning. A Big 4 auditor is almost certain to find all of these problems, and possibly
more, prior to the release of a 10-K.


The outcomes I expect from here are either that E&Y will simply resign, or they will
again require massive restatements due to the inconsistencies described above.


Third party accusations of fraud?


The fundamental questions to the fraud thesis are: is Osiris overstating revenues? If so,
by how much?


It is unusual that Osiris does not disclose any breakdown of revenues between its
products. However, analysts estimate that 90%-95% of revenues come from the Grafix
product alone. It is almost everything.


The main competitor and market leader in the wound care space is MiMedx. MiMedx
has already come out in two public statements formally stating that Osiris is overstating
its revenues.


From the MiMedx Q3 conference call:


Generally speaking, we find our data to be reasonably accurate with occasional
acceptance for some companies that do not publicly disclose the product line
breakouts. For example, we've analyzed the Medicare 2014 claims data for the
hospital outpatient market. This data shows that in 2014, MiMedx had the market
leadership position with 34%, Organogenesis was next at 31% and Osiris was at
just under 8%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3812496-osiris-aggressive-channel-stuffing-accounting-irregularities-outright-fraud 11/30


Now this Medicare data tells us that the SmartTrack data for MiMedx and
Organogenesis are reasonably consistent with the Medicare data. With the
SmartTrack, Osiris data is very likely significantly overstated. Our SmartTrack
data shows Osiris at about half or 50% of our wound care revenues. The sales in the
category are most likely closer to 20% of ours in wound care based on the
calculations from the Medicare data.


Separately, in a recent letter to shareholders, MiMedx stated the following:


We have previously presented the Medicare and commercial payer data on the Grafix
product as well as other competitors. Osiris has refused to give its shareholders any
revenue breakdown. They like to create the myth that their revenue is largely
competitive with our EpiFix product in the advanced wound care sector. That is not
the case. There is information from Medicare, the Veterans Administration and from
commercial payers showing that Grafix revenues are approximately 20% of our
EpiFix revenues.


How can these discrepancies be explained? It is simple. Osiris is recognizing
revenues in exchange for receivables. The products simply sit at the distributors and are
never being sold to the end market. And unfortunately Osiris is never getting paid. We
can see this from the DSO balance which now exceeds 130 days.


But now that Osiris' largest customer has been sold to Osiris' largest competitor, the
scheme must come unraveled and reported revenues will plunge.


Conclusion: What is Osiris doing wrong?


Osiris has consistently been improperly recognizing revenues. That much should be
clear. This has inflated both the absolute dollar about of revenues as well as the
perceived growth rate.


Osiris has only begun to get caught. Before resigning, former auditor BDO required
restatement of 3 quarters of revenues for PhysioRx, and required PhysioRx to be
treated on a cash only basis.


But PhysioRx has always been a tiny customer, accounting for roughly $1 million in any
disclosed quarter.

Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Stability Bio is a much bigger deal. It is likely the problems with Stability that resulted in
the auditor's resignation. This can be gleaned from the timing of the resignation vs. the
comments made to audience members at Canaccord.


We know that Stability was a major customer, but many of the disclosures which
quantify this are contradictory. This is a major problem.


At one point, Osiris disclosed that Stability was responsible for 58% of revenues in Q1 of
2014. Later, Osiris stated that it was just 15% of revenues in that same quarter. The
difference is clearly massive and yet no explanation or reconciliation has been provided.


Separately, at a recent conference, the CEO stated that Stability was responsible for
around $6 million of receivables owed to Osiris. Yet the most recent 10-Q puts that
amount at just $757,000. It should be viewed as telling that the auditor resigned shortly
after these statements were made.


Auditor BDO resigned on December 11th. However, Osiris deliberately did not notify
investors of the resignation until 1 week later, once it had already appointed a new
auditor, the Big 4 E&Y. But given Osiris' past troubles, investors should be feeling more
concern rather than comfort over the appointment of E&Y. E&Y is virtually certain to
encounter the same issues that led to BDO's resignation as well as additional issues
regarding receivables.


Competitor MiMedx has repeatedly cited Medicare and VA data, accusing Osiris of
overstating revenues by 2-3x. What is most likely happening here is that Osiris is
offloading inventory onto various distributors (including Stability). This inventory is never
sold, resulting in the exploding receivable balance at Osiris. But Osiris still books the
sales anyway, inflating revenues.


Osiris is still valued at around $300 million, despite the fact that it struggles to achieve
any profitability. An auditor resignation or massive restatement is highly likely, which
would send the stock to around $2-3 in short order.

17% more lives should bring in 20 to 25% more sales in this group (Medicare) which based
on previous earnings call is about 1/3.


Q3 sales= 25 million, so about 8 million


Estimated impact 2 to 2.5 million more in Q1.

It may help a bit, but until accounting is cleared I doubt it will make any difference.

@Tor12


Thank you for your reply. I also read your comments above.


The author is talented in choosing his corporate preys and the right timing to pull the trigger.
He overwhelms the market with his piece and his methods are quite similar to (negative)
propaganda, i.e. Take some facts, distort them and make his own story to unleash hell in
due time.


You have argued above that long investors do the same. Well not quite so. When a bullish
investor writes about a company's potential it is always clear to the reader that it is a
hypothesis not proven facts. Honest bears do the same: stick to facts.


Here, the author mixes true facts e.g. Osiris abundant cash position, with other facts he got
out of his hat e.g. Stability Biologics, and he insists on having closely verified them. Then he
builds a seemingly consistent theory from which he infers that the company is run by thieves
and that stock will plummet... No hypothesis but absolute certitudes, not open to discussion
(according to him) while we know that most of this is trash.


You will note that this is a double edge sword: for investors who weathered the storm when
the article was published and for the army (3200 the author says) of his fan-followers who
gleefully went short on the stock.


I do agree with you on one point, there is a case for moral hazard for those who followed his
analysis and are now short. Given the effect on the price, which fell by almost 20% when the
article was published, with significant volume, I assume there are many of them.


As for his intention, they are clear to me: short, throw the bomb and cover at the lows.
Pocket the gain and leave the casualties behind without even considering to answer
questions Case closed count the money don't waist time and move to another juicy

questions. Case closed, count the money, don t waist time and move to another juicy
opportunity. He is smart enough not to believe his own lies and so do probably some of his
followers, who are familiar with his "strategy".


The litmus test in his case is how well the article does on the market when published, and
for the follower how much he can make money. Content, fairness or truth are hardly a
measurement of quality if at all.


So unlike what you apparently think, the author can go on like this for a long time.


As a conclusion, yes there is one issue the author raises that has some grounds: DSO.
Analysts have underlined this issue, Bears and Bulls. Osiris newly appointed COO, Mr Law,
said he's giving this matter close and full attention and recruited the people for this specific
task. I tend to believe people who have his type of background.


Osiris also made clear the commercial strategy: targeting the 1000 big accounts hospitals of
which they have so far opened about 800. This profile of client has not only large sale
potential but also solid financial basis. In addition, Grafix is covered under the "bundle" by
Medicare. There is no reason to believe payment will not follow.


I can see only one reason DSO augmented. Osiris was an RND company which shifted to a
fully integrated company 2 years ago. Regrettably, the impressive growth in sales and
product line (up from 0 to 5 and 7 shortly!), was not backed by enough resources on the
administrative side.


Clearly then an "execution problem" rather than "channel stuffing" as the author and you
suggest. Isn't this more credible then the accusations made by the author and do you really
believe Osiris is a den of liars and thieves?

The most interesting from this article is that they contacted Mr. Richard Pearson for

@9592411, okay you're a long right. Does that article and statement give you any
color on what I think is probably the major issue here....accumulating ARs and
DSOs? Those are the hallmark of the financial issues raised by the author.
Debrabandere doesn't say anything that settles it up. So while it's a cute byline that
Richard P or whatever didn't respond to comment, Debrabandere didn't say anything
that makes me think "d @mn I shouldn't be short". I wish the guy had responded just
so longs wouldn't have another non-issue to get wound up about (can't find the
author), and so we could actually address why on earth ARs are skyrocketing. I don't
see anything in the company's reply that makes me change my mind.

I agree with Hanibal 1135 
In this case it is very difficult to recognize a fraud. Why should the Management pump up
the revenues by roughly 3 milion (3% of the revenues 2015)? This doesn't make any sense
for the Company and for their pockets. 
If fraud is recognized why should BDO assist Osiris to restate its accounts? 
E&Y is now more than 1 month in Charge and if there is fraud I suppose the new Auditors
had plenty of time to discover it... and eventually resign. Especially when BDO is supposed
to ensure a smooth Transition to its successor accounting firm (Osiris document January
19).  
What speaks also against the sincerity of the author is the wrong (false?) Statement about
the massively overestated importance of Stability Biologics in the revenues of the company. 
Nevertheless I do not understand why it takes so Long to restate a couple of operations. But
I can imagine that BDO - due to recent possible changes in their auditing Standards -
overshooted in their restatement's decision. Anyway as Tor 12 said: Let's see how this Plays
out.

Thank you for making your thoughts clearer.


Well you know there are sets of rule applicable to all markets and fortunately enough to the
financial market as well. You can't sell a bull to a person in a hurry by bragging about its
milk...


The author starts his article purposely by comparing Osiris to one other company he
identified previously enmeshed in a corporate scam. He is implying Osiris is cheating.


The difference between cheating and not complying with auditors -revised- opinion (auditors
concurred with the treatment earlier), is simply enormous and so are the legal
consequences.


Rogues intend to cheat while honest people may be in the latter situation.


I simplified this situation by calling it a "mistake" earlier, although auditors did concur with
the company when those revenues were booked. Should the extremely cautious standards
(cash basis) be held applicable to this revenue recognition issue, then auditors should be
held liable, definitely not the company. Which may explain why they chose to resign.


The author's intent is obviously to mislead his readers by pretending to give facts. Investors
who made comments under this article (and previous ones by Vranic) and the company
gave straightforward answers to these.


Let me point out one of these "facts". The author claims that as part of his "due diligence" he
contacted Stability Biologics which he says is the largest distributor of Osiris. The company
in the previous earnings call (November 15) mentioned that it severed contracts with all
distributors except Stryker (bio4) and Arthrex (Carthiform).


Further, on January 19 Oisiris made the following statement:


"Transitioned Stability Biologics® from being a meaningful revenue contributor to Osiris in
previous years, as disclosed in our filings, to contributing less than 0.5% of revenue in the
second half of 2015."


This is how diligent the author's research is.

impossible with any size at all. and you can't pull that trick very often before it's dead

Make your thoughts clear and I will be glad to respond. Where did they pump? By selling
MSC technology with a hefty consideration and royalties? Or is it because they made a
killing with Grafix in 14/15? Assimilating an accounting mistake (recognition timing of
revenues for some discontinued products) to a fraudulent behavior is simply out of context.

I'm pointing out the author is free to make accusations about the company as he
sees fit. It's not "borderline" simply because he has a short position. This is a market.
Grow up and embrace the way the public markets work. No, there is not some dirty
cabal of conspiratorial short sellers as a bunch of whacko longs always delude
themselves into believing when they make stupid investments. I see guys like you a
dime a dozen. If you really think longs are bailing on account of his "borderline"
article and those longs are the dumber for it, back your money up with a truck and
you'll get paid when you're proven right, as you think you are.


"Assimilating an accounting mistake" is an interesting take on a major accounting
transgression. In the real world, that's the textbook definition of fraud. Lying about
revenues.


This is a real company but that doesn't mean it hasn't committed fraud. I strongly
suspect the sales #s are precisely as this author described - turning up as AR. Aka,
they were not actually revenues in the spirit of revenues, but they were conveniently
turned into revenues for accounting purposes in order to deceive the investing
public. 75% of frauds I short commit their transgressions at the revenue line. Just
because OSIR sells real products doesn't somehow absolve them of their basic duty
to the market they've taken capital from.

@nhsully, do elaborate. Because I'm certain you have no idea what you're talking
about. I'd love for you to point out the regulation that prohibits whatever it is you're
inferring.


If I think this company has committed fraud, I can say it. Even if I'm short. Even if I
end up being wrong at the end. Just like if you are long a company, you can say it's
the greatest company in the world. Even if not.


Your guys' dumb argument always breaks down when the rubber meets the road.
What do I mean? Well, if I really am wrong, but somehow the author's and other
shorts' inaccurate views printed in Seeking Alpha are actually negatively impacting
the share price (if you were actually investing as a profession, you'd realize how
stupid this retail investor misconception is about Seeeking Alpha....it doesn't move
the market), regardless a market misconception is your opportunity to load up at a
cheap price and make a killing at my expense. that's the beauty of the markets. You
can literally make money at my expense here if you think I'm wrong. There is no
better way to prove me wrong than fleece me. This is literally zero sum. I sit on my
shorts for long periods of time. Load up buddy!


At the end of the day, every fraud I'm involved with has guys like you. Maybe I'm
wrong maybe I'm right. I've been wrong plenty of times before. But there are mirror
images of clueless dudes like you in the wake of tons of frauds I've followed. It plays
out pretty much the same every time. Shorts point out problems, long cheerleaders
go bananas. The irony is it's usually shorts to point out to the longs the problems,
and longs take umbrage and fight short sellers - instead of actually investigating the
problems we raise. Tanking around 50%, that's when you guys hate the shorts the
most. Once it clears 70%+ down, then you guys start blaming the company. And
finally, you just disappear altogether licking your wounds.

You're welcome Godisrupt. This 700 k order is the first order by a non US seller and will be
booked in Q4. Given the proven success of Grafix in the US (even bearish analyst Brean
estimates Q4 sales at 30 million$, 20% up) there are strong reasons to believe this client will
be loyal, as many other in the US. Compare to Mimedx, producer of Epifix, which only
received FDA approval to export 2 weeks ago...


You are right, the article you mention was evidence that bears will use any strategy,
shamelessly, to flag Osir down. The company was not sued for giving kickbacks or anything
of the sort as purported.


The author above found the weak spot to pound on (accounting restatement), nervous
markets, fear and also Osiris poor communication skills (compared to its competitor,
Mimedx), have done the job.


If we compare the market value today to what it used to be at its lowest when Osiris did not
distribute Grafix yet (it was an RND company) we realize that the distribution business
(Grafix and 6 other products) is close to being considered a liability... and we are talking
about a company with 90 million $ sales and impressive growth record.


Now bears will cast doubt on the figures due to the resignation of auditor BDA. The author is
close to suggesting the management is at best mediocre or even "outright fraud".


Well, I've been listening to the CEO over the last 5 quarters (earning calls, presentations...).
Lode Debrabandere is a PhD, with a brilliant academic record and an impressive
background in marketing.


Implying that a person like this and his team are "outright frauds" is tantamount to seeing Al
Capone at every corner of the street...


Obviously, the author does not suffer from paranoia and we all know why he's doing this.
Rules apply to freedom of speech however, and I am not sure he complied with these.
Disparaging a company even with a disclaimer regarding his short interest is clearly border
line. I hope Osiris will strike back to protect its name, business and shareholders interest.

@9592411 - you, my friend, apparently don't have much experience with frauds.
Welcome to your introductory course. A lot of things will surprise you if you're long.

I got in on the short side as soon as I saw the auditor change. Investment theory 101 is that
an auditor resignation is really bad news. Auditors don't just give up fee paying clients
unless something is very wrong. And if you are thinking the new auditor is going to give you
good news I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn. The new auditors have huge liability
issues going in they will write down everything down to the kitchen sink.These arguments
about product quality are moot. Oh and 120 days aging on receivables is considered
uncollectible - more Investment 101.

OSIR has been good to me. Over the last 1.5 years I bought the dips and sold all, but the
profit, on the rips. I had accumulated a nice position with the house’s money. I should have
seen it coming in May when I read this article http://bit.ly/1RMoFoM. http://seekingalpha.co... 
Headline: At Least One of Osiris' Executives May Be Under Investigation for Providing
Kickbacks and Fraud. A big thank you to Hanibal35 for first answering my question on Nov
23 regarding how much revenue, from a recent deal, would be realized through future
quarters. When he answered 700K. 700K will not do squat to overcome the upcoming
restatements. http://seekingalpha.co.... Following a rule I live by Accounting issues=danger.
I sadly sold entire position. IMO OSIR has not told the whole truth. They have downplayed
the impact and the fact that they had to manipulate Rev reveals ignorance or arrogance.
Either one is uninvestable. I was looking to come back in around $4 based on Fib charts; but
I believe as this unfolds it will break through that low target. Thanks for the good times OSIR
but we must part ways… it’s not me - it’s you.

You say, "Osiris has now just lost its largest customer, which was bought by competitor
MiMedx." Sounds scary. But Osiris stopped using that distributor (Stability Biologics) in the
3rd Quarter of 2015. They now supply product in the US only through Stryker, Arthrex and
their own proprietary sales force. So why do you describe Stability as Osiris' largest
customer? How reliable is the rest of the information you gleaned through your "due
diligence"?

I would say the author is a bit frightened to answer the questions as it would only prove his
ignorance, poor research or outright slander. My guess is he covered on the lows and left
his followers with their short. Will they hold through the weekend with E&Y close to
completion of their audit? This all in my opinion of course....

"through the weekend", hilarious. Day trading goofballs and conspiracy nuts like you
never fail to disappoint. I'm short fyi, and will hold until the stock tanks. I'll watch
some football this weekend if you're curious.

It is very amazing that this article has been published anytime just before osiris should
deliver the restated Q-10. What is even more amazing is that MiMedx is facing stronger
competition from Osiris after that the National Institute for health and care excellence (GB)
in August 2015 rated Grafix therapy with the mention HIGH QUALITY while Amniotic
Memory wound graft (Epifix) was rated LOW QUALITIY.

Since you seem so sure of your opinion, I thought I might ask a few questions


When was Graphix released to the market?


Have you seen the VA data for 2015 and has market share changed between OSIR and
MIMEDX products?


Is the product revenue you are so concerned about Ovation?


What products were being sold by Stability?


Did the former auditor agree with the revenue accounting method in prior quarters?


Was the resignation of the CFO an unannounced occurrence?


How long has BIO4 and Cartiform been on the market and who sells it?


The answers should be readily available to you based on your article, sadly you didn't
include them....

You obviously know the answers to the questions you ask and I understand that you
do not want to dignify this trash article with a well-researched rebuttal. 
This seeking alpha contributor (or should I say mendicant) should be ignored, as his
analysis is very flawed and his irrelevant comparisons are unfounded and
preposterous. 
Seeking Alpha should stop publishing this sort of rubbish.
