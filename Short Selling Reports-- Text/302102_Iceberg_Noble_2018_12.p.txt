MESSAGE TO NOBLE GROUP’S CURRENT
AND PAST SECURITIES HOLDERS WHO
ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH NOBLE’S
PROPOSED RESTRUCTURING AND
WANT TO JOIN LAWSUITS AGAINST THE
PARTIES ASSOCIATED TO THIS FRAUD
FOR A BETTER FINANCIAL RECOVERY


August 14, 2018  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 2 Comments  


Many investors of Noble Group (shareholders, perpetuals, bonds holders),


who have suffered massive losses, have asked us how they could sue Noble,


its managers and the parties responsible for this major fraud, including its


auditor and the banks that have facilitated this scheme. These investors are


naturally exasperated. The same team that has cooked the books, sank Noble


and paid itself dozens of millions every year, is not held accountable. These


managers are now given another run in complete impunity. This scandalous


situation is unprecedented.


We have talked to experienced law firms. They are ready to represent the


interests of these investors, challenge the scheme of arrangement and start


ligation against the parties responsible for this fraud. Note that whatever


the result of the shareholders vote on the restructuring is, it will not prevent


the investors who voted against from opposing the scheme of arrangement.


Litigation funders are also interested in financing these lawsuits, which


would considerably lower litigation costs. We expect many objections to be


raised against the scheme of arrangement. For example, the legal release,


designed to protect a long list of organisations from future lawsuits, is


extremely wide, and very unusual. The new Noble is absolutely not


financially viable. It has almost the same financing costs. Commodity banks


are generally expected to refuse to finance this company as long as the


same management is in place.

Some securities holders already want to join this action. We encourage


other investors to contact us. Note that the securities holders who have


already sold Noble’s securities can also contact us if they have suffered an


economic loss.


We also invite Noble’s former employees who would like to share


information on Noble’s financial misrepresentations and other


wrongdoings to get in touch. We have recently received internal documents


that confirm key aspects of Noble’s accounting and leave no doubt on its


fraudulent nature.


The “new Noble” as it is advertised in the restructuring proposed by Noble is


a scam, exactly as the “old Noble” was a scam. It is another trick to foul


investors. It will be the same company, with the same failed management.


The same persons who have lied to investors for years are already lying on


the viability of the new Noble. How many times did this management


promise a turnaround? When was the last time Noble’s managers said the


truth? In the US, Noble’s managers would have undoubtedly been charged


with fraud by the SEC. As usual, Noble’s managers will pay themselves


obscene salaries and bonuses. The ad hoc group will get rid of its exposure as


soon as possible, leaving other investors with heavy losses.


There is only one way for Noble securities holders to recover their money: to


sue the firms and persons who have organised this fraud. It is the right


thing to do in terms of justice, but it is also the only viable strategy to get


their money back. The restructuring proposed by Noble will direct any cash


flow to management and the ad hoc group. We expect the other


shareholders to lose everything.


Although Noble’s managers and the auditor E&Y are responsible for one of


the largest frauds of the past twenty years, they have been allowed to


operate in complete impunity. Noble’s securities holders (current and past)


have the power to end this unprecedented scandal.
