Comments On Lumber Liquidators' First Quarter Business Update
Apr. 3, 2015 8:08 AM ET77 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Lumber Liquidators reported that same store sales were down 17.8% in March.


Even worse, gross margin plunged from an estimated 38.5% to 31%.


The company’s margins soared in 2012 and 2013 in large part, I believe, because it
was cheating by sourcing tainted products.


Now that it can no longer do so, margins will likely return, at best, to historical
ranges, which will significantly reduce earnings going forward.


Using even generous assumptions, the stock is significantly overvalued.


Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) released its First Quarter 2015 Business Update yesterday
morning, in which it disclosed that same store sales in March were down 17.8% - a terrible
number, to be sure, but better than some had feared, so the stock was actually up slightly
on the news.


I'm not surprised that sales weren't as bad as expected given how much the company is
slashing prices - just go to the company's website and you'll see what I mean. This
obviously had a big impact on margins, however - the company didn't disclose how much,
but a Morgan Stanley analyst report out yesterday estimated that gross margin plunged
from 38.5% in January and February to 31% in March. Here's an excerpt from the report:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3049086-comments-on-lumber-liquidators-first-quarter-business-update 2/22


A knock on Q1 and future results is that gross margin is weaker than expected. The
company is clearly being promotional in stores with a ~$1.00 off per foot of
Bellawood and nearly every other SKU on sale. In addition a mix shift away from
laminate towards hardwood (10%-15% margin difference) is putting pressure on
gross margin. We think that while sales are the more important story line today, at
some point the focus will shift to whether LL can bring these margins back up. Based
on the gross margin range provided, and assuming higher SG&A than initially
thought, we think Q1 earnings could be as low as $0.10 or as high as $0.17. Our Q1
EPS estimate goes to $0.14.


Q2 margins are also likely to be under pressure. At the beginning of Q1, LL
anticipated gross margins of 38.5%. On its 03/10 call, LL lowered this target to 37%
and further lowered it this morning to ~36%. Assuming LL was running margins at
38.5% for January & February (2/3 of the quarter), it implies March gross margins
came in at 31%. It is a valid concern if this rate holds through Q2 and we look
forward to more clarity on this on the April 29th conference call. But, for now, we
believe better sales will carry the day.


Here is a chart of Lumber Liquidators' gross margin by quarter from Q1 '06 to the present
(using Morgan Stanley's estimates for January-February and March):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3049086-comments-on-lumber-liquidators-first-quarter-business-update 3/22


The key thing to notice here is the very consistent gross margin between 34% and 36%
for four years - and then the extremely rapid increase starting in Q1 '12, which is exactly
when: a) Rob Lynch became CEO (1/1/12) and b) Lumber Liquidators acquired Sequoia
Floorings, whose primary operations are in Shanghai (the deal, announced on 9/29/11,
was "expected to close by the end of the year").


The company would have you believe that the rapid increase in its gross margin was due
to various legitimate and sustainable factors. On the Q3 '13 earnings call, CFO Daniel
Terrell said:


Our gross margin over the past two years has benefited from a portfolio of initiatives
working individually and in combination to deliver cumulative multiyear benefit…We
aggregate gross margin drivers in three primary categories, all of which contributed
to third quarter expansion. The product margin drove 300 basis points due to shifts
in our sales mix, including an increase in moldings and accessories, lower cost of
product due to sourcing initiatives and higher like kind ASP, not due to retail price
increases, but a result of greater retail price discipline at the point-of-sale. [emphasis
added]


I believe that most of Lumber Liquidators' margin expansion is due to only one of these
three explanations - "lower cost of product due to sourcing initiatives" - but that this wasn't
done legitimately, but rather by cheating: buying, mostly in China, illegally harvested
hardwoods, toxic laminate, etc. and thereby saving 10-20% on sourcing costs.


(Interestingly, one source told me that Sequoia, rather than being the cause of Lumber
Liquidators sourcing tainted products in China (which is what I'd assumed), was, in fact, a
good operator - but once Lumber Liquidators took control, Sequoia turned to the dark
side.)


Why would Lumber Liquidators do something so immoral and potentially destructive? The
oldest reason in the universe: greed. The company saved a lot of money on sourcing
costs (not a "few pennies," as founder and Chairman Tom Sullivan claims), which I think
was a major contributor to a quick doubling of operating margins, which in turn helped
send the stock price up eight times from $15 to $119 in less than two years. Both Sullivan
and Lynch recognized a golden opportunity when they saw it, dumping $37 million worth
of stock at prices more than double today's level in early- to mid-2013.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3049086-comments-on-lumber-liquidators-first-quarter-business-update 4/22


Another key thing to notice in the gross margin chart is that the outlier isn't the 31% gross
margin in March - it's only 300 basis points (bps) below the bottom end of the 34-36%
historical range - but rather the 42% peak gross margin, which is 600 bps above the top
end of the historical range.


I confidently predict that, even if one excludes any potential fines, remediation costs, legal
bills and settlements, damage awards, etc., Lumber Liquidators' gross margin will at best
only return to the 34-36% range. This means that operating margin will, at best, return to
the historical range of 5-9%, as one can see in this chart of Lumber Liquidators' operating
margin over the same period:


Earnings Estimates and Resulting Stock Price


If we take the midpoint of the historical operating margin, 7%, and assume $1 billion in
sales, that means Lumber Liquidators would have $70 million of operating income.
Applying a 39% tax rate and dividing by 27.2 million shares results in earnings per share
(EPS) of $1.57 - which is almost exactly current consensus analysts' estimates for 2015 of
$1.60.


The difference between us, however, is that I think $1.57 is normalized earnings power in
a best-case scenario, excluding many costs that I believe are likely to be substantial and
long-lasting, whereas analysts think 2015 will be an unusual trough year and that the
company's EPS will soar 41% to $2.26 in 2016. I would bet my last dollar that Lumber
Liquidators doesn't earn $2.26 in 2016.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3049086-comments-on-lumber-liquidators-first-quarter-business-update 5/22


Rather, I think it would be extremely generous and optimistic to estimate that the
company's earnings grow 10% in 2016, which would result in EPS of $1.76. If I'm right,
what multiple might the stock trade at? It could trade as low as 6x if regulators take strong
action and various lawsuits gain traction (which I think is highly likely), and as high as 15x
if not, which results in a stock price range of $10.56-$28.16. Either way, it's a substantial
discount to the current price of $33.20, which is why this remains my largest short
position.


Sales of Chinese-Made Laminate


In addition to revenue and margin information, I was also very curious to see what
happened to the sales of Lumber Liquidators' laminate. How many customers hadn't
heard of the 60 Minutes story and/or believe the company's ludicrous claim that its
Chinese-made laminate is "100% safe"? The answer, apparently, is most of them, given
that the company disclosed in its press release that "Total laminate net sales, which were
21.2% of net sales through February 2015, fell 480 basis points to 16.4% in the month of
March 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the sales mix of laminates sourced from
China."


My understanding is that about half of Lumber Liquidators' laminate is from China, so that
would be ~10.6% of total sales. I'd estimate (purely guessing) that 3/4 of the decline in
laminate sales is the Chinese-made product, so that's 360 bps (480 x ¾) of 10.6%, so this
would mean a ~34% decline in sales of Chinese-made laminate.


In other words, the company is dumping this toxic product as fast as it can - and roughly
2/3 of customers who were buying the product before the 60 Minutes story aired are still
doing so.


For the sake of the health and safety of Lumber Liquidators' customers, I wish the
company would stop selling what I believe is a dangerous product, but as someone who is
short the stock, I'm actually delighted that the company has adopted a strategy that I think
is truly insane. First of all, management's credibility is plunging every day they continue to
make the preposterous claim that there's no problem at all. Perhaps the problem is minor,
but there's definitely a problem.


Secondly, more than 70 class action lawsuits have already been filed against Lumber
Liquidators and when they start reaching courtrooms, the fact that the company continued
to sell toxic flooring after the 60 Minutes segment aired will look very bad. Rather than

More like 35.5% to 36.5% PROFIT MARGIN for Q1, 2015 per SEC filing ... very impressive and that's no lie ...
!!!


I wonder why margins are misstated on low side at 31% in article above ... ???


_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ copy/paste below from 8-K _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _


Gross margin is now expected to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5% in the first quarter of 2015, including
approximately $1.5 million in incremental transportation costs related to the East Coast distribution center
transition and consolidation. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2014 was 41.1%

Even the guys who make the Fast and Furious movies think Whitney's schtick is getting a little repetitive.


03 Apr 2015, 09:00 AM


Clayton Rulli, Contributor
Whitney says" For the sake of the health and safety of Lumber Liquidators' customers, I wish the company would stop
selling what I believe is a dangerous product..."


In the same paragraph, he then says: "First of all, management's credibility is plunging every day they continue to
make the preposterous claim that there's no problem at all. Perhaps the problem is minor, but there's definitely a
problem."


---The product is "dangerous"? Clearly this is an unproven laughable opinion. As per Janney Capital, Osha standards
for Formaldehyde are twice the level the "failed" floors tested for in the 60 minutes study, and this is for installers
exposed to those levels 8 hours a day all week long, mind you, source: http://bit.ly/1DEKlvc Therefore by Osha
standards, LL's floors are not dangerous to homeowners or to installers for that matter. 
---Second, Whitney concludes his eye grabbing opinion of it being "dangerous", with "...the problem is minor." That
sounds a little better Whitney, thank you for not exagerrating for the entire paragraph. Since the product is not
dangerous to homeowners clearly under OSHA, I'd say the "problem" is not specific to LL, but perhaps for all products
from China. The EPA announced there is no current law guiding companies like LL HD or LOW in regards to flooring
standards, so really Whitney is making something out of nothing. http://bit.ly/1BVIzA . In my opinion, the only
"problem" here is when short sellers exaggerate loopholes in laws or lack there of, and pose there opinion as fact by
saying a product is "dangerous", when it cannot be supported by actual scientific information or law.

Just think if every company stopped selling what some believed is a dangerous product. I believe alcohol,
cars, planes, cigarettes, plastic bags, gasoline and formaldehyde are dangerous but that doesn't mean they
shouldn't be sold.

2+2 does not equal 5. The LL margins made no sense and for one very obvious reason which we all know at
this point. Having heard the CEO and founder on CNBC my inclination is that his credibility is extremely
questionable. Those that put money above all else are not my kind of people. IMHO these guys can start
buying back as much of their stock as they want. I'm sure they sold quite a bit while doing what was ethical
wrong.

At this time, W.T. is fighting a losing battle.  
It is obvious that LL will lower prices, spend money on the legalities and remove the suspicious product from
inventories and suffer losses. That is how companies handle hurdles and survive.  
LL has Good products, Great staffs, Name recognition, Long history, and a lot more. LL will handle the damaging
reputation in less than a quarter. It already has corrected the Sourcing issues. It is offering numerous solutions to gain
the customers/contractors confidence. LL is the only place that one can find a vast variety of floor covering.

My reply:


I genuinely believe that all of the research and conclusions that I've published are correct. The idea that I'm knowingly
doing the opposite to benefit my short position is beyond ludicrous -- which should be clear to anyone who does even
a perfunctory check of me and my background. My reputation for integrity is well deserved and something I cherish,
so rest assured that I wouldn't throw it away (not to mention risk going to jail) by engaging in short-and-distort
scheme.

My financial interest in LL may be causing subconscious bias -- by definition, I wouldn't know, but I will say that I'm
actively seeking disconfirming information (and not finding any).


If I am proven wrong -- that LL's Chinese-made laminate is in fact safe and CARB-compliant -- then it will be a major
embarrassment to me and I will publicly apologize to the company and anyone else who's been harmed. (I’m not
worried, as I think odds of this are less than 1%.)


But, to answer your question, if I am proven wrong I will not be paying damages to anyone. Think of it this way: if I
saw and smelled smoke in a theater, I would surely yell "FIRE!" If it turned out that there wasn't a fire -- but I genuinely
believed there was one, had good reason for this belief, and yelled "FIRE!" with good intentions of saving people from
harm -- nobody would think I should pay the medical bills of someone who sprained their ankle running out of the
theater.

Actually I think you are wrong here from a legal perspective. If "genuinely believe" someone is about to attack
me and I think they have a knife and I shoot them dead but it turns out they have a ham sandwich and they
were opening it up to take a bight then I would be guilty of manslaughter. So I don't think you are even correct
from a precise legal definition. Otherwise everyone could just say hey I thought he was gonna rob me or
attack me, oops my bad, now he is dead.


03 Apr 2015, 11:58 AM

All I can say is wow. I sure hope I don´t share a crowded theater with Tilson. Tilson SMELLS smoke and yells
FIRE which could create disorderly chaos without knowing there is actually a fire or imminent danger. If I
smelled smoke (which wasn´t super visible and no FIRE) I would make my way to the exit and inform the staff
which could handle the situation more carefully and safely (like open exit doors, turn on lights, have staff
organize the flow of traffic, etc). Maybe someone just smoked a cigarette outside or workers are welding in
the renovation on the theater next door. Totally irresponsible.


Even if this silly comparison makes sense, which it does´t and sort of disturbs me, it is entirely different to the
current LL situation. In the theater example Tilson may argue it was a split second decision (not really since
he merely smelled some smoke) but this LL situation is nothing close. We are talking about a level of a
substance of ONE type of product of a company which is really only tested in one state in the entire world and
even there it is not clear it is in violation yet Tilson has taken upon himself to yell FIRE without regard to the
negative repercussions on the company or its employees. He has yelled FIRE with reckless abandon by
using hyperbolic argumentative terms like ¨evil¨ and¨drenched¨. It is even worse since Tilson is actively
seeking to make money off of this reckless behavior. I don´t know if this is illegal but it certainly is immoral and
scummy. Tilson is essentially saying since he truly believes he smells smoke he is in the right to scream FIRE
and then sell anxiety pills (making money) to everyone leaving because they are all stressed out. It is all ok
because he Truly believes this.

"Actually I think you are wrong here from a legal perspective. If "genuinely believe" someone is about to
attack me and I think they have a knife and I shoot them dead but it turns out they have a ham sandwich and
they were opening it up to take a bight then I would be guilty of manslaughter. "


Not in Florida! If you genuinely believe you're in danger, stand your ground and fire away! It is completely
legal even if they only had a ham sandwich.


As for the issue of damages to LL, it is a judgement call, and the Wikipedia info is pretty murky:

I think it would be hard to convict this clown unless you could prove that he didn't do any research at all, or
that he knowingly made false statments about LL (which is hard to prove).

The main thesis is Chinese is cheap, I wonder if you have been to China in recent years, With the rising
Chinese Yuan, everything I see is expensive over there these days. With the dollar rallying against almost
every currency except Yuan, there is plenty of places to source cheap lumber, like Canada, Australia and
South America, why go to China?

Tilson is really sounding pretty bizarre here. So if is am a religious person who genuinely believes it's ok to kill people
from other religions then it's ok because "I genuinely believe" it to be true.


He seems to have really tricked his mind into doing this without feeling any empathy or remorse even if he is wrong.
So I guess as long as I genuinely believe something it doesn't matter if I repeat the same false accusations 1000x and
I won't compensate any damages because since I genuinely believed it to be true then I can do no harm in my mind.


I believe this is truly psychopathic behavior.

Mr. Tilson could you please explain to me and the rest of us what level of anything is consider ¨drenched¨. Are there
3, 4, 5 levels of drench-ness? What is the cut off? Is something below this cut off non drenched and anything above
drenched? Since you ¨truly¨belive the wood products are drenched then surely you have some sort of mental relative
framework you can share with us.


I would ask the same question with respect to the level of ¨evil¨. Is GM or Monsanto evil? More evil ? Less evil? Is LL
more or less evil than the s&p 500 average level of evilness?


03 Apr 2015, 12:12 PM

Very good point Max. The problem is that Tilson et al think that since they ¨firmly believe¨the company is evil and
dangerous it doesn´t matter what the real facts are, just their interpretation of the facts. It truly is a morally bankrupt
position for him to take and he is in so deep now he can´t backtrack without losing face. He freely admits he does´t
read the comments. Is this because of the agita or more likely that he does´t want to consider opposing ideas or
different lines of thinking. He is essentially putting his hands over his ears and screaming so as not to allow himself to
hear anything else.

Even though I find Mr. Tilson's constant attacks on LL (one article every 2 days?) rather distasteful, as a I hold LL
longs, I actually don't mind them from an investment perspective.


Due to the rise of its implied vol, LL options now trade with weekly contracts, so I've been just selling strangle like
call/put trades, and earn weekly carry, with limited capital exposure. Since I long, the selling of call legs after the stock
bounced is practically free for me, as some pointed out, higher highs.


Unfortunately for me, the negative impact from each of his article seems to be diminishing.


PS: I am just being subtly sarcastic, and wanted to comment on this so that I get notifications when others comment.
It's interesting how the public sentiment moves against Mr. Tilson, with each additional article.

Whitney Tilson must have forgotten the time in late 2012 when Chapman, Loeb and dozens of others aware of his
idiocy paid him $25-35/share for HLF while he was short it at that level … on its way to $80+! Even today, down by
half, the stock is 50%+ higher than when Tilson publicly declared his short in HLF, despite EPS estimates falling all
the way to $4/share. And that was only the first PUBLIC time many like Chapman have faded his idiocy – his NFLX
short, GMCR short, and the list goes on. Chapman probably has made more than Tilson's paltry AUM taking the other
side of "Ackman's retarded brother" - as he is now known on Wall Street.

Thanks for being so transparent in your analogy - shouting fire (repeatedly) in a crowded theater even after the fire
department has arrived. Who does that?


03 Apr 2015, 03:23 PM


Matt Brice, Contributor
I thought people might be interested in the response I received from California Dept of Public Health.


One thing that is getting overlooked is that the second test that 60 Minutes did (Tilson didn't even do this one), is that
it is an emissions test designed for "green certification" and is no way related to any legal limit. Further, it isn't
designed for a single-family house, so the assumption that go into the emissions rate are way off-base. I had hoped to
write this up in an article, but it really isn't worth rebutting every single one of Tilson's false claims. See below for the
response I received to my questions from the CDPH. By the way, this is actual research, not "I smell smoke, therefore
I will scream fire."


What are the standards applicable to formaldehyde emissions under the CDPH 01350 testing protocols? 
CDPH response: For each building material tested, CDPH Standard Method (version 1.1, 2010) defines a maximum
allowable projected concentration of 9 micrograms (µg)/m3 for formaldehyde using an office or school classroom
model scenario based on the area specific emission factor (in unit of µg per square meter per hour) measured from
chamber tests (see Sections 3.10 and 4 of CDPH Standard Method for details). CDPH Standard Method also includes
a new single-family residence scenario appendix, but it is only informational. If one chooses to use the informational
new single-family residence scenario, the maximum allowable projected concentration of 9 µg/m3 for formaldehyde
still applies.


Do these standards carry any regulatory enforcement or are they suggestions that support various green
certifications?  
CDPH response: CDPH Standard Method (version 1.1, 2010) is a voluntary guideline and not a regulatory standard. It
is aimed at encouraging the use of low-emitting building materials in indoor environments to better protect public
health. It has been widely cited in various building codes, standards and rating systems, some of which (i.e.,
California Green Building Standards Code) can be enforceable.


What, if any, connections do the emissions rates from these standards have to Prop 65? 
CDPH response: In Section 4 of CDPH Standard Method (version 1.1, 2010), it requires that volatile organic
compounds “(VOCs) emitted by products appearing on State of California lists of toxic substances, including Prop 65,
are considered to be chemicals of concern and shall be included as "Target VOCs" for the testing of emissions under
this method.” Therefore, the lab test report generated per CDPH Standard Method (version 1.1, 2010) shall include
quantification of VOCs appearing on the Prop 65 list. However, in terms of whether a product emission passes or fails

CDPH Standard Method, the maximum allowable projected concentrations are only benchmarked to the non-cancer
Chronic Reference Exposure Levels (CRELs) published by Cal/EPA Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment and don’t have a direct relationship to Prop 65 Safe Harbor levels.


Are products that exceed these standards considering pollutants or just not recommended? 
CDPH response: CDPH Standard Method (version 1.1, 2010) is a voluntary guideline and is aimed at encouraging the
use of low-emitting building materials in indoor environments to better protect public health. Products that fail the
CDPH Standard Method are not designated pollutants, but rather are identified as exceeding VOC emission guidance
levels.


Were the development of these standards regulations-based or health guidelines?  
CDPH response: CDPH Standard Method (v1.1, 2010) is a guideline document with health-based emission criteria.


Can you provide any other information/background on the development, implementation or enforcement of these
standards? 
CDPH response: The FOREWARD section of the method describes CDPH development and implementation of this
standard method.  
CDPH is not an authorized regulatory body on building material emission and does not enforce or certify tests based
on the CDPH standard method.

Instead of ad hominem attacks and suggestions that bearish articles written by short sellers are devious regardless of
their content, we should all focus on the arguments laid out by Whitney. He is dead right that the stock should be
trading at a sub $20 level if gross and operating margins would normalize at historic levels. It would be hard to justify
LL as a long term holding - even at these levels, but adding to a short position at these levels is dangerous given the
potential for a mega short squeeze.


03 Apr 2015, 05:13 PM


nhsully88
His arguments and LL's recent margins may be built upon misleading information he and 60 minutes
publicized. If so and margins improve based on the potential for a different story, then his arguments fail. In
addition, lawsuits going the other way could lead to quarterly improvements when they are settled.....

I think readers should challenge the argument Whitney is making vice attacking him.


If you do not like his articles - don't read them.


BTW - I think he always publishes his short positions in his quarterly updates as he does his long positions.


This is just another short for him when the vast majority of his investments are longs. Find another public investor that
tells people what he is doing! 
Then you attack him vice his investment thesis. No wonder most public investors don't say anything.

Tilson states:


"The idea that I'm knowingly doing the opposite to benefit my short position is beyond ludicrous -- which should be
clear to anyone who does even a perfunctory check of me and my background."


The funny thing is I did research his background of past SA posts. I posted the results but it was deleted. Bottom line
the results are horrible(80% failure rate at best). Anyone can look up his past ideas and judge for themselves.


Same hyperbole on every idea which for the most part never came true. I don't know if this will be deleted also, but I
wanted to let Tilson and readers know that I have done the "background check" and the results only further
strengthens my skepticism of his hyperbolic attacks.

Tilson has a real point about the intrinsic value of the stock being $10-$28 given highly probable margin compression.
A lot of the comments here , more than I have seen against any other contributor, are vitriolic and do not respond to
the points made in the article. Tilson has laid out a real case for a significant drop in the stock price below $28 even in
an optimistic scenario. It will be interesting to see what happens once the lawsuits begin impacting earnings.

That is the shame of it. There will be plenty of lawsuits, whether founded or unfounded. That is the way of it.

I have thought about this also. I have stopped reading or even clicking on any Matt Stewart articles since he
has over 50 (probably more) negative ones on HLF alone. Anything over a few articles, especially in a short
period of time, is just propaganda and not additive to the conversation. In this case (Tilson) I do think it is
worthwhile to point out the shallowness of the author and his position/arguments since it may not be readily
apparent to the casual reader.

Hey Tilson, six articles of yours ago on March 12, 2015 you said


"Going forward, I'm going to lower my public profile and allocate my time elsewhere as: 1) I've now shared publicly my
facts and resulting conclusions; and 2) It's not about me (or 60 Minutes or anyone else) vs. the company. It's about
the company's actions, what harm might have resulted, and what the consequences will be.


With numerous state and federal authorities as well as various law firms pursuing this vigorously, I'm confident that
the truth will be out, so I'm going to go back to my regular job of trying to buy the occasional cheap stock of a good
company."


What happen with that? Why have you not gone away as you stated? Oh that's right, you have no integrity and your
reputation is shot. You are nothing but a two bit losing want-an-be.
