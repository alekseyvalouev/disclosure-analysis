Herbalife's Shocking Confession
Mar. 3, 2016 10:26 AM ET425 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Herbalife just confessed that the numbers it reported in the last two quarters for one
of its most critical metrics, Active New Members, were hugely overstated.


This is terrible news for three reasons: the numbers are much worse, it calls into
question the company’s internal systems (and perhaps integrity).


And it highlights that Herbalife is so complicated that not even the company itself
can get its arms around it.


Shareholders, analysts and regulators should demand that management
immediately answer a number of important questions.


The Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) saga has had so many twists and turns over the years that I
thought I'd seen it all -- but I was wrong...


Herbalife just confessed in an 8-K filed early this morning that the numbers it reported in
the last two quarters for one of its most critical metrics investors and analysts use to
evaluate the company, Active New Members, were hugely overstated due to “database
scripting errors” and “quarterly aggregation issues.”


I'll give you three guesses which direction almost all of the errors are… And the
adjustments aren't small -- they're huge. Here are the highlights (lowlights): 


In Q4 ‘15


The company reported that "Worldwide, active new members' excluding China was up
16.7 percent in the quarter". The actual number: +3.2%.
In the U.S., the company reported a 71.0% increase. The actual number: +30.7%.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company reported a 44.0% increase. The
actual number: +17.7%.


In Q3 ‘15

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 2/105


The company reported "On a worldwide basis excluding China total number of new
active members was up 21.0% compared to the prior-year period." The actual number:
+8.7%.
In North America, the company reported a 33.0% increase. The actual number: +1.8%.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the company reported a 34.0% increase. The
actual number: +10.2%.


For the entire year (2015)


The company reported that "[Worldwide active new members, excluding China] up
8.3% for the full year." The actual number: +3.4%.


Why This Is Terrible News


I’m sure Herbalife bulls will say that: 1) This doesn't affect reported financials (or so the
company claims); 2) Active New Members are still growing (albeit at a slower rate); and 3)
In two countries (Mexico and Brazil), correcting the errors slightly increased growth. 


But anyone who views this new disclosure as anything but terrible news for the company
is kidding themselves for three reasons:


1. The much-worse number undermine management's claims that the business is getting
better;


2. It calls into question the company's internal controls and systems (and perhaps
integrity); and


3. It highlights that Herbalife is so complicated that not even the company itself can get
its arms around it.


Active New Members Is a New, Made-Up Metric


It’s ironic that this metric is causing trouble for Herbalife because Active New Members
isn’t a GAAP number – rather, it’s something the company just made-up a few months ago
and first started using on its Q3 conference call in November, supposedly as evidence that
things were getting better (kudos to Quoth the Raven, who noticed this and asked shortly
thereafter, “Why is the company using a term called “active members” on its latest
conference call that does not appear in any filings or any previous conference calls and
has not been defined?”) It really says something when you can’t even get your made-up
metrics right!


Questions Management Needs to Answer Immediately

Comments (425)


Shareholders, analysts and regulators should demand that management immediately
answer the following questions:


Management first used this metric on the Q3 ’15 conference call on November 3, 2015
and again used it many times on the Q4 call, yet has never fully defined or explained it.
Does management plan to continue using this metric and, if so, does it plan to better
explain it?
Management trumped the strong Active New Member growth as evidence that the
business was getting better. Now that they know that Active New Member growth was,
in fact, far lower, is this evidence that the business is doing poorly?
Now that management is aware that Active New Member growth was so much lower
than they thought, does this affect guidance going forward?
When did the company learn of this error and how much time elapsed before it was
disclosed?
Why did it take so long to discover the error?
Who discovered it? Was it someone internal or external?
Should shareholders be worried that this mistake is indicative of larger problems with
the company’s internal controls and systems?
How does the company propose to compensate shareholders who bought the stock at
inflated prices based on incorrect information?
Given that the company trumpets Active New Member growth as a critical driver of the
revenues and profits of business, how is it possible that slashing Active New Members
has no impact on the company’s reported financials? Is there any chance that at
restatement will be necessary?


Disclosure: I am/we are short HLF.


I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving
compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article.

This has very material implications at every level.


Investors have to take further pause on top of the numerous other icky things about hlf.


hlf is a scam.


hlf scam behavior keeps pouring out at every level of the (dis)organization.


The wrong calculations seem very inconsistent and imply the data was cooked.


hlf said this was a key metric for investors so this has to be a key metric for the company to guide the
financial forecasts.


The massive errors beg a lot of questions!


For them to drop this kind of bomb just days after the earnings call just seems like the pop and drop and bait
& switch consistent with hlf that seems to be pervasive throughout all of hlf.


Investors should be very upset that the bait and switch extends to them too and not just the defrauded
gardeners bus boys maids. The scam goes from the Home Depot parking lot to the Wall Street ivory towers.

saying about this massive error?


Well, if they just happen to sell sell sell on the pop and gotten out before the drop, the Federal Government
just might give them a call.


So,


hlf cooked the data OR hlf does not know what the heck it is doing, either way this looks and smells awful and
further erodes confidence from the public and investors.


however, the hlf negligence ignorance incompetence somehow always lands on the benefit of hlf and top
distributors to come out ahead .. way ahead.


The fish stinks rotten from head to tail.


The key metric screams that hlf is all about recruiting recruiting recruiting (for a more compelling message,
just look at the CEO Michael Johnson and President Des Walsh videos).

The company has a lot of integrity to correct this mistake so quickly - even if it's an irrelevant internal side
metric that nobody cares about compared with numbers impacting earnings or cash flow.


Unlike say a company like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which recategorized $58 Million in net revenue and has
yet to release its full q4 '15 earnings.

"numbers impacting earnings or cash flow."


Let me help, you seem to be struggling. What matters for stock price is what the stock is projected to do in the
future. The way you project in the future is based on a lot of factors, including growth of your sales force (in
MLM, read your customers).


Hope this helps.

Speaking of pop and drop warning signs, have you seen the 50% peak to trough at PSQ? As a fund holder,
Whitney, you of course have a duty to your investors to disclose your conflicts of interest, disclaimers, yada
yada yada, and you see that is how Pershing Square was built from the rubble of Gotham Partners - another

I agree, PSQ's NAV is highly questionable due to collective risk of current and ongoing SEC investigations
insider trading lawsuits and likely investor redemptions combined with the company's undisclosed short
positions, derivative positions, and real estate holdings in less liquid markets.

This does not change earnings or financials at all. So Herbalife's excellent EPS and revenue were achieved
with LESS active new members than previously reported. This sounds very bullish to me! The earnings and
sales revenue look even stronger!

Unlike fixed income securities, stocks move on expectations for future growth, inflated numbers of customer

"is not easy to get new members but I keep trying"


ok Jerry Denis, tell the Non Supervisors they are eligible to receive Whsle Net Profit in their pockets, like at
the STS monthly meetings and likewise Non Supervisors can earn Retail Net Profit in their Pocket, like at the
STS monthly meetings, and it's really not a Fry's Electronics surcharge that is rebated right back at ya the
next month!.. Just keep believing otherwise and ignore the "Buy Your Discount" Business Model.. HBL will
implode when the USA Latino grasp this concept.. What is the incentive to purchase a boatload of commodity
products at extreme surcharges.. Let me repeat Non Supervisors earn No whsle nor Retail Net Profit of any
kind.. think...about the "initial purchase, and subsequent sale mixed in with the "Buy Your Discount" aspects.

Jeff:


Sure it is. If it weren't for Ackman, none of this would be going on and these pyramid, scam, Ponzi and people
abuse conversations would not exist in HLF's media. If it weren't for Ackman, HLF would be trading at near
$300/share levels by now consistently growing share price and dividend. So if it wasn't Ackman, then who
started the charade? I actually liked it and was hoping to see the price come back down into the $20 but the
accusations don't seem hefty enough. Come on Hedge Fund Bill, do it again. I need to grow my portfolio.


05 Mar 2016, 04:27 PM


Skrambled80s
Regarding the relevance of VRX, Ackman stands by that company as a solid company and continues to
describe Valeant's problems as PR issues. When signs of accounting irregularities emerged, he doubled his
position. 
What does this say about the quality of his research and investment decisions? Should we trust a word he
has to say about Herbalife? Obviously not. 
Ackman has many talents and skills, none of which is value investing.


05 Mar 2016, 04:43 PM

Wez, It may affect future expectations but in no way changes the already reported earnings per share or

I own a bit of HLF.


I saw these numbers. They looked very strange and weird. I immediately discounted them as meaningless.
You can't have a 72% growth rate in something like that and report modest single-digit revenue growth. It
never made sense and anybody with a bit of common sense knew it.


By the way, why is it the shorts weren't all over this with their vaunted "research" right away?


Over the past 4 years, idiots like Ackman and Einhorn and others who never went through years of
experience with Pre-Paid Legal created massive volatility and a great buying opportunity.


I've been able to trade the stock, but, even more importantly, I've been able to seel all kinds of options with
outrageously high implied volatilities and generally buy them back for pennies. AS a ersult, my HLF position
(which is my second largest) is essentially "free and clear" with close to zero cost basis on my blotter.


Thanks, guys!


Keep up the good work!

alexalekhine,


Agreed, Herbalife is a great company to invest your money on, as of right now I am learning how to trade, and
where I am going to invest my money, right now I am only buying the product to consume and I give it to my
future recruits, is not easy to recruit, now there are a lot of MLMs, every one wants to be rich doing MLM, so
many companies is even crazy some that I approach in my gym are already recruiters of a different one. So
much competence, MLMs are so good so once I start making money as a member in Herbalife I will be doing
the same strategy as you. to diversify, herbalife member (recruiter) and buying the stock of herbalife great
plan that I have.


You should try to be a member. and recruit a few and maybe one will be your golden recruiter who will make
you rich quicker than owning the Herbalife stock.

Shocking confessions continued - Whitney Tilson's Q1 2016 results were released today.


- In Q1 2016, Tilson's fund was down 3.6% vs. +1.3% for the S&P 500. Tilson was -4.9% compared to S&P
500. Very disappointing news for his investors.


- Tilson's fund declined 7.3% in 2015 vs. +1.4% for the S&P 500. Tilson was -8.7 % compared to S&P 500.
More losses for his investors.


A large part of his losses were his Herbalife short. Perhaps Mr. Tilson should make his HLF short a part of his
confession. That would be shocking and is long overdue!

Listen, here is even simpler math. I buy at $100 and I sell at $200. The profit is $100. You can try to reclassify
cost differential any way you want. What I paid subtracted from what I sold it for is indeed gross profit.

Simplicity and You are Friends.. 
HBL math is simple:


Life and HBL in General are a little more complex.


JC Pennies is having a Discount of 50%  
or 
Buy 2 get 1 Free.


I am the Customer.. 
I buy shoes for @ $100..Price Paid $50 or 50% Discount 
or  
Receive 2 Pairs of shoes for $100. 
----------------------... 
The Above is from the Buyers Perspective. 
I will now present it from the Sellers Perspective Below:


In order to Achieve 50%.. I cannot Purchase at 50%.


Before I begin..


"Listen, here is even simpler math. I buy at $100 and I sell at $200. The profit is $100. You can try to
reclassify cost differential any way you want. What I paid subtracted from what I sold it for is indeed gross
profit.


I don't disagree with the statement.. well..only partially, and here's why..


If I am a Fully Qualified Supervisor I am selling to a third party Customer, outside the network.. I would agree
that there is a Potential to achieve a 50% Gross Profit.. (Gross)....I further believe it is a possibility of 50%
Net.. If a FQSV SV is at the Break Even Point in the Business a 50% Net could be a Reality..


Here's where it gets a little tricky..  
You cannot INSTANTLY obtain 50% buying Privileges.. even as a Supervisor.. and/or a Fully Qualified
Supervisor... 
So we must address this issue first. 
1. How Exactly does a SV achieve 50% buying Privileges from HBL so they can make their 50% Gross..


Joke: Buy from AMZ or EBY or Craigslist at 50% and the sell the product at 100% MSRP.. Instant 50% NET!!

But Seriously, (ok I'm not going to get into $$ amounts here of HBL pay to Play shenanigans...I will only
discuss it as a %..) 
*You like simplicity.. so I will attempt to make it simple..


In order to Qualify to receive a 50% Retail Gross as a Fully Qualified Supervisor, you are required to make a
money transfer to the KingPins..  
Step 1: 
Instant SV @ 50% Buying Privileges. 
No..Wrong, Don’t the KingPins Deserve to Profit..HBL says yes. 
So. you must Qualify in order to Receive.. 
Legally stated, In order to participate in order to receive commissions inc 
If you have to pay consideration in order to receive “recruiting rewards”, “mlm compensation” (all rewards are
based on Earn Base *encrypted word for Retail)...which is incidental (*incidental = HBL is required to pay
Recruiting and MLM Compensation based exclusively on retail sales only.. MOJO has stated publicly 2 yrs.
ago at FPTR that the FTC has only one Problem...Is this the problem?) 
HBL is convinced that every product sold is a bona fide retail sale in order to legally pay the above rewards,
commissions and bonuses on. HBL collects upfront tax and freight at Retail amounts..  
All participants who are discount customers are allegedly paying tax and freight + 50%, 40%, and 33%.
Likewise collects 73% on every dollar excluding tax and freight.  
Similarly;  
HBL pays out 63% to the top 1%.. 25% Retail, 
22% TB TM and above (Excludes MHB)  
16% AVG to SV’s..  
*73 - 63 = 10% Difference (-15 is collected from RO’s but only +5 is paid out...which is -10 net. 
Transparently stated, HBL collects a total of 75% from each and every Participant Pool and Distributes 73%
out to the Field.. The difference between 75 and 73 is 2%.. Where.. HBL pockets this..  
The remaining 25% Product Cost Allocation is broken down as Follows.. 21% Product Cost and 3% HBL
pockets. So HBL actually nets 10% and then another 7% on Shipping and Handling Based on Retail Amount..
Interesting to note that HBL collects a total of 13%...the very same amount HBL pays out to the TAB (top
achievers Bonuses which encompasses all sales leaders from Get (Global expansion team thru Founders
Circle). 
It is very interesting to note that in order to to get to Get Team position you personally and your 1st three
levels excluding SV’s must be doing 5,000 Volume Points.. Think $5,000.. X 3 consecutive mos. In order to
qualify for your +5%.. *Just a reminder that all participants must contribute -15% each and every month..The
-10% Breakage...let me clarify.. the way HBL works is encrypted.. Whenever you see a negative $ amount
(know this is a positive amount going to a higher level..in this case a Tab Team member..(also be aware there
is a positive amount expressed in form of discount.. usually Retail, (to Restate a - amount represents a -$
going to the “entitled” don’t I deserve its: For 8 yrs. Or more they have simply been behind the curve and are
now demanding that because of the net loss of others “the marketing plan dictates the actions of distributors”
they have this sick and twisted gangbusters attitude of “We did the work, now we are going to get it” Because
of the marketing plan, it is impossible for anyone to earn an net profit from the marketing plan till at least
President Team.. their are exceptions though. ..

I want to continue my long and winding road to Retail if any.. A Qualifying SV who is at the 42% level is just
that.. There is no 50% retail available. So to break down the 42% alleged Retail Profit.  
+25% is offsetting the -25% all participants are required to contribute to the Sales Leaders (Non SV’s and
above) the 17% remaining is offset as well, Take a look at the spread difference between 42 Discount and 33
Cost 
So 
+42 - 9 = +33 
And +33 +9 = +42 
So that = -9, +9 
--------------------- 
Step 2: 
+50 - 8 = +42 
And 
+42 + 8 = +50 
So that = -8, +8 
----------------- 
Conclusion: 
-9 and -8 = -17 (BYD) buy your disc. 
+9 and +8 =+17 (SYD) sell your disc. 
Simple Conclusion: 
+17 + -17 = “0”


Similarly 
+25 + -25 = “0”  
Offsets the SL’s vs. Retail Profit

You went to a lot of effort to try to say that if I buy at $75 and sell at $100 for some reason I don't make a $25
gross profit. Or, if I buy at $50 and sell at $100 I make a 50% gross profit. You can add all the long-winded
irrelevant detail you want. Those are the facts. You dont have to buy anything to get a 25% discount and thus
potentially make a 25% gross profit.

The fact that HLF leaves these levels of 25%, 35%, 42% and 50% and 5% to three levels and 2-7% for
uplines is simply product pricing. If you had a R&D costs of x%, marketing of y% and sales of z%, you would
factor in x+y+z% into your pricing. Allocating it to distributors costs or operating costs is the same. Really,
you're going to great lengths to obsfucate something that is very, very simple.


16 Apr 2016, 12:29 PM

"You dont have to buy anything to get a 25% discount and thus potentially make a 25% gross profit."


Let me be perfectly clear, Read my lips: +25% is offset directly (not indirectly) by -$25 Allocation to the Sales
Leaders (Tab Team and above, not SV's)


I have Broken Down previously there are Qualifying SV's and Fully Qualified Supervisors.. The Prior can only
receive an Allege 42% Retail Gross at Best in your Fantasy.. The Latter may Earn an 50% Retail Net.. The
Difference between net and gross here, is that only Non SV's are required to make a "contribution" to the
SV's.


Now to address your "Fantasy Delusions", You absolutely must subtract 25% from the Supervisor receiving
the alleged profit of 50% Retail Net. When you Reconcile, and looked at the Fixed Costs.. (Every single
Member Participant) must make a required "contribution" to the Sales Leaders (excluding SV's but includes
GET to Founder Circle) of 25% Allocation 23 (SL) + 2 (HBL). 
So the alleged SV Retail Net Profit.. Poof disappears (has been transferred to the Sales Leaders..  
Want to Restate it very succinctly; It is true that FQSV SV's receive Gross 50% from a customer outside the
network.. But it is a misrepresentation to Not Reconcile, (50 - 25% Fixed Cost that every single participant
within HBL must pay to Sales Leaders (Allocation).. The Allocation paid out to Sales Leaders is not a % it is
hard Cash! Expressed in a Simple Formula: (By the way cut this out, and GLUE it to your Forehead) Better
yet, tattoo this Formula to your Forehead! +25% is offset by -$25.. 
Done! Do I need a lot of words to express the calculation.. NO! 
You might say, well at least their is 25% for the Fully Qualified SV's ($25 Net Retail) Partially True, but this is
rarely the case.. I'm not going to address what the Endless Chain as a FQSV entails here.. But my Final
Answer is that FQSV can possibly earn +$25 Retail Net.. 
On the Other hand the Qualifying SV may as it appears only earn -$8 less than a Fully Qualified SV because
they do not yet have 50% buying privileges from the co. as yet. The FQSV does have 50% buying privileges
from HBL.. So..50 -8 = 42 and 42 +8 =50! 
Notice their is an +8, -8 Difference between the FQSV and the Q-ing SV. You cannot deny, or ignore this.. Are
you an Ostrich? (Hide your head into the sand to avoid Reality.. 
HBL has been successfully fooled the masses for 35 years.. No one has ever examined HBL in a "Correct"
way (breaking it down for the masses).. Lot of white lies, that are black lies.. 
One Last addition: 
FQSV's earn 25, 15, or 8 from the Non Supervisors.. 
I want to focus on the "8" here: 
There is a 25% allocation among the SV's and Non SV's, 
HBL in their annual reports call it a 50% Distributor allowance.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 18/105


So 25% potential Retail Allowance + in this case 17 NSV and 8 SV equals another 25% ...(So 50% Distributor
Allowance). 
But I want to take it a step further..look at the spread of 42 and 33 and there is +9 and -9.. and look at the 50 -
42,, +8, -8.. Now put the 2 equations together..(not going to lay out all the math equations again)...but (+9 ,+8
= +17), and (-9, -8 = -17).. Done 
So to RECAP.. -25, +25, and -17, +17 and -8 +8 = -50 and +50.. HBL conceals all Recruiting Rewards, +
MLM Commissions to the SV's to Founder Circle Members, with 50% Discount Allocations from Participants..
25% from Non SV's and 25% from all Participants.. So get out the Glue again and or Needles and Tattoo this
Formula on your Forehead.. -$50 is offset by +50%. 
Final Conclusion: 
Non SV's earn no Retail Profit.. only after reconcilement properly. 
Fully Qualified SV's earn 25% Retail Net.


SV = +8 
SV = -17 
So tot. is -9 
( -9, -8 = -17)


Similarly:


NSV = -8 
NSV = +17 
so Tot. = +9 
(+9, +8 = +17)


So:


( -9, -8 = -17) 
(+9, +8 = +17)


42 - 9 = 33 
33 + 9 = 42 
(Notice the "9")


50 -8 = 42 
42 +8 = 50 
(Notice the "8")


HBL is an Illusion, I have gone in great depth, in previous posts regarding this..


Tying it all together 
-33 + -17 = -50 
"0" 
+33 + 17 = +50


Since Now I have proved by words and even a math equation that FQSV's and Q-ing SV's earn No whsle
and/or Retail Profit, NET, GRoss whatsoever..

I was trying to emphasize to the shorts..or longs, because I feel the same strong way about something
completely different...not related to "active new member" 
(your "theory" on buying a discount versus selling at a margin.) 
When Executives like Dez Walsh and John Desomoine, and Bruce Peters talk about the "Business Model"
they don't mean, what you think they mean.. as you say "Buying at a Discount" To the Average, Normal
Investor it appears this is a Positive.. I buy a greater amount of volume, I receive a greater discount, and I
purchase less volume, I receive less discount.. Most 100% investors believe this is not Discrimination based
on price..(which is not wrong) but under the surface something "sinister is brewing unnoticed by investors.. It
is "Buy Your Discount" (1) EX. In order to receive a 35% Discount within one of PKGS. HBL says 61% of all
Participants Purchase.. This was years ago when HBL Executives attempted to answer David Einhorns
questions on a quarterly conference call.. 61% of members become a Senior Consultants and are considered
small business owners.. (But that is not my point) In order to become to receive this alleged 35% discount,

the participant must buy thier discount at a 5% surcharge ratio to 35% ..so 40:35..Notice their is a spread of
+5, -5,, (35 + 5 = 40, and 40 -5 = 35) I have entirely excluded the product cost from the mini equation in order
to show clarity of what the sales leaders and Supervisor receive as a percentage. In a nutshell, the +5, and -5
within that equation disappears.. FYI this is who the ex Senior Dr. Van Der Nat of the FTC says is totally
legitimate.. He states in his white paper that the discount has to be proportionate to the potential retail.. HBL
meets and always satisfies this requirement in my findings and calculations I have presented here on HBL
Board. The SV rewards which are recruiting are perfectly acceptable and the MLM commissions HBL and
Sales Leaders earn are perfectly acceptable as well.. The Non Supervisor is the only participant who is not
earning anything.. Because they have bought their discount, not received a discount.. Let me explain further..
35% + $7 = is equivalent to 42. You cannot say 42% nor can you say $42.. It is neither.. what I say is a 42
Allocation.. But this is theory not practice.. what really happens at the Non SV 35% is that HBL adjusts
(manipulates) the SV Recruiting Fee Proportionatley in relationship to Retail amount of the whlse
commission.. (I'll repeat that in a different way, by breaking it down). Before that, let me clarify very
specifically, I am talking about what happens during a split level commission.. of a payout of a hybrid payout
of alleged 42%.. There was the initial purchase of 42%. 3 scenarios may occur but here I am demonstrating
what happens when a 42% sells directly, or indirectly to a 35% "initial purchase" who is a member within that
sellers downline. It is impossible to for a participant to make a "subsequent sale" without making an "initial
purchase".. So we are attempting to discover what if any alleged profit a Non SV may or may not earn and
how HBL interprets the business model in practice not theory.. It is absolutely not straight forward as an
investor might think.. In order to describe the transaction correctly, "new words" that are not in HBL's
nomenclature must be made.. HBL does not want anyone to create words other than their terms they use in
order to  
prevent a participant or investor observer from realizing how the "correct" interpretation of the business model
works in actual practice.. (not theory).. Everything HBL states publicly is Discount this Discount that, Do not
confused by that word..need to look at the entire phrase.. "Buy Your Discount then sell it".. not merely a
"Discount" the participant receives; greater/less discount based on the amount of product purchased. The
latter phrase is what hbl wants "you" to believe..though it is far from the reality of the business model, and
regards how it is actually practiced. Got all that? Let's continue.. a 42% is selling to a 35% and the spread
difference is 7%.. 7% is translated by HBL and HBL will send the Non SV seller $7. (Fact).. But let's back up
here.. something is not right.. How can a seller ,who is at a greater discount, give a discount to another buyer
(who is at less discount than the seller) $7 from their own pocket or indirectly through HBL.. It is coming from
a wrong of false starting point in the marketing plan.. Any Bank will refuse to cash a mere % from HBL.. It is
incorrect to solely talk about a Discount.. when talking about surcharge can be correctly interpreted clearly by
all parties.. If we were to translate this correctly so all parties would clearly understand. It would go something
like this.. I the seller have paid $58cost(42% DISC) and I am selling to a downline Distributor at a 35%)$65
cost. HBL has fiercely attempts to defend of expressing the transaction as a Dollar amount.. They absolutely
refuse to talk about is any other way than a discount. and for years I have attempted to correctly address the
transaction as the following: The/my "initial purchase"/Single Level 
(the surcharge/initial purchase..is subsequently sold/Split Level/transaction to a another (non SV) within my
downline or one personally sponsored by me. who has received a discount based entirely around a artificial
surcharge. The Goal of the seller is to offset their initial loss by attempting to "Recoup their Loss" through
recruiting efforts by themselves or others within their downline. The Alleged Discount is a manufactured

Surcharge to give the false illusion that somehow this is a great opportunity.. It is not... One
deception/misrepresent... is that a 42% is selling to a 35%.. and the profit is 7%.. (I want to repeat here)..
Banks do not accept mere "%" checks from HBL and cash them.. Correctly stated it is a seller who is paying
less surcharge than the buyer or ($58 selling to a $65).. Clearly the 42% and/or $58 is paying a recruiting fee
to the SV.. Hence the SV is at 50% Discount and or purchases at $50 Surcharge.. (the product cost allocation
is actually allocated at $21 or 21%..) So there is at least a 25% surcharge or $25 Cost at the SV Level..
Why..all SV's (coincidentally) all participants must pay the 25% allocation to the Sales Leaders including SV..
*Note the SV does not pay a recruiting fee to their up line FQSV as all Non Supervisors must do. 
Backing up do want to clarify.. that in practice not theory, the 8% SV recruiting reward (contribution by the
NSV) is cleverly disguised. Specifically the President of HBL will state this is incorrect.. OK.. Well, the 7%
alleged Profit to the Seller, is actually not a Discount, when you (BYD: buy your discount).. Buy Your Discount
is actually -$7 (negative SEVEN)..and I'm not going to get into it but here, have gone into great detail about it
in prior posts.. but if you want me to explain it again, just email me..  
but..in a nutshell another -$1 is required.. (-$7 + $ -$1 = -$8). 
32 (25 + 7) "-" 33(25 + 8) = -$1..But I just want to show the investors where the other equation within this
equation is. +16 -15 = +1%,, So; -$1 is offset by 1% discount..and ex senior economist of the FTC "Dr. Van
Der Nat" is smiling because HBL can legally get away with it!!!! Yay.. So the multi-level expression "If I...Would
you... actually is alive and working here. 
Yen and Yan, Quid Pro Quo, Tit for Tat, (these phrases all describe HbL Business Model).. Final Conclusion..
All money paid by the Non Supervisors are transferred to the SV and Sales Leaders as a desperate attempt
to recoup their initial surcharge disguised as a discount. (in order to see this the participant or sophisticated
investor observer must understand that the HBL entire business model works just like Fry's Electronic Store
Rebates.. Product Surcharge advertised as a discount only to be rebated after you participate in some
fashion..

Recruiting, Recruiting, why... to attempt to recoup your loss. When is break Even, at the president team? I talk
to millionaire team members a lot,,, they don't disagree, that they are still waiting to break even, but they are
sure at the PT they will break even.


Tell me honestly, this doesn't describe the typical HBL, Millionaire team member or even some Executive PT
members, they are all running around trying to meet quotas, to receive a break even paycheck at best.. Don't

state, your journey or the person you become is the Goal..What type of person becomes a President Team
Member? 
Brad Harris seems to think that if you do it right, there is absolutely no reason to retail the product.. Do you
agree or disagree and why?

....and I love HBL, I truly do, it's one heck of a "piece" of work as well, the marketing plan is so complex, that I
imagine Mark H.and Larry T. received the green prints for the Business Model from Little Green Men in Outer
Space.. (it's a pretty racial statement isn't it, but who is going to complain) 
I hope you will brave enough and ask me a question.. and if not, let me ask you, what part did you like best?
HBL Senior Distributor Relations believe that I am constantly calling the wrong MLM Co.. (Isn't this a
talent1800 marketing plan, and what products do you sell?) No, and NO, (HBL is just not ready yet for "your"
marketing plan)..ok,, I know that, but, but,, Distributor Relations hangs up on me again.. (We are extremely
worried about you...) Let me make a suggestion to HBL .. Keep on hiring, Team Players, that are not Math
Geniuses.. One Senior Male Distributor stated that "he does not get paid to think" another stated to me on the
phone,, the key to rank advancement is Winning,, another agent stated buying a product is like an
investment.. You got 99 sincere, passionate agents, that are true believers, and only 1 agent or 2 (both male)
that are green apples..

Has HBL ever been "straight up" about anything.. 
What I do, is ponder and think about HBL.. I'm not a strategist, but I have met the strategist for our state..she
usually comes to STS's and all she did was attempt to answer my HBL Business Questions with prodding
personal questions about me, that had absolutely nothing to do with HBL.. Now she doesn't even
acknowledge my presence, (I stand in front of her, jumping and waving my hands in front of her attempting to

get her attention..to no avail)..She allegedly represents HBL corporate....She too, gleefully admits, I'm not
good at simple math, and yes I am a team player.. "I could never ever disagree with anyone HBL presents as
Reality"....If I ask her a question about the backend of HBL marketing plan, she says, there is no backend.. it's
all front end. It's all about the Discount, Discount! I tell her the Discount is not how HBL works in Practice..
she disagrees politely, she believes I'm all about theory.. She is very slippery, she will neither deny or confirm
anything about anything.. What I have noticed about her is she wears extremely short dresses, (I'm not
making any comments or judgements about her, just stating the facts as I see it.) I notice she likes to hold
another females waist and/or hand and seems to enjoy this immensely.. Her favorite saying to me, is every
time we meet, is CALL ME.. which I have but she has yet to return one call....I am always attempting to clarify
what her role and responsibilities are.. She stated her primary goal was to only associate with the top GT and
above Leaders; WHY,, they are the productive ones... The only thing that matters strategy wise, is putting
more money in the superstars pocket.. Hence, the promotions,, this is the one takeaway she will admit to.. A
promotion is when one stretches their downline to do more.. Purchase more volume.. One Variable of income
is determined by how much you personally purchase, and/or sell to your downline.. 
I have been keenly tracking as best as I can, two important criteria at the STS monthly meetings.. one is how
many new customers.. The most successful Distributors out of a room of 50 is: There will be one person with
10 New Customers.. and the remaining 7 leaders will state anywhere from 3 to 5 New Range.. The next
metric is how much did you earn from combination of Retail and RO or PB from HBL.. Other than the PT
Leaders or MT Leaders.. it could go as high as $500 for one, and another $300, for the rest, it is dramatically
lower.. Maybe 4 or less who claim they received $100 from HBL. *Note, Out of a group of 50 over 3 yrs.. I
have noticed in STS groups, there are an average of 3 non TAB Sales Leaders who stick around and are not
recruiters.. It seems they rely on retail sales to earn an average of no more than 300 average over the 3 yrs.
per month.. But these 3 individual members are known to consume 3 to 4x product over their retail sales..
The vast majority, and I mean 92% are not earning any money, but purchasing product, it seems like the
fantasy of becoming on of HBL's elite is enough for them.. They are perfectly content and please do not
attempt to wake me up, and don't even whisper that they have a 1/5000, MT or 1/10,000 or becoming PT..  
100% of the regular Members that attend the STS monthly, live and breath HBL nutrition.. Over 3.5 yrs. I have
only observed a couple less than 5 times (and this is exaggerating) I'm really stretching here, where there
was a member brought a brand new recruit to an STS.. The majority of work is done in a nutrition club.. In
one particular organization.. there is mass recruiting of SV's going on, but anywhere from 6 most to 3 yrs.
they are gone.. Poof.. Two final comments. Mark Hughes said it best, in order to succeed you must replace
more SV's as soon as they quit. This matches my observation in one organization.. The other "Fact" I have
observed is that the true goal of a HBL leader is to get this person to duplicate more than themselves(means
r-e-c-r-u-i-t) before they churn (q-u-i-t) in order so that the SV and sales leader can have an false appearance
of growth from their downline.. the downline leaves but yet leaves a new downline, who ultimately will leave
as well.. and this begets another false impression of temporary growth.. JD7777 said it best.. Success in HBL
is based on Failure,, downline moves up thanks to the Roll UPs.. placed in HBL marketing plan

Great interview on Bloomberg and you raise many great questions here. I don't expect that any of them will be
properly answered voluntarily. I would die with laughter if they read out your questions and answered them one by
one on a call (consider yourself dared Herbalife). Herbalife is in defence mode and for the most part the only people
that do significant analysis on new information are the shorts - the longs mostly reject the pyramid scheme case so
can't actually understand the company. The company tends to disclose as little as possible in the most vague way
possible. Otherwise they would just be giving as Ammo. That's why we love the old conference calls where they run
their big mouths.

Nice job Whitney! It's so funny that the opinions on the significance of this metric diverge so much between the bulls
and bears. These are absolutely HUGE corrections. 71% to 30% ??? Come on bulls, you have to admit that the
incompetence involved here is massive. And to blame it on a database scripting error is even worse. You'd figure that
someone would have done at least some manual calculations to verify the procedure before letting it get reported.

Did they have their database engineers calculate that value? They probably got the direction of cash flow
wrong in the script.

$889 M in cash in the bank.


That doesn't require a database calculation, and it has absolutely nothing to do with "new active members"
and would have no overlapping calculation with $$$$ in the bank or $$$$ made.


At this point, the company should seriously consider dropping use of the metric altogether - given that it
seems to have been created as an internal statistic to address that Ackhole.


In my 1000 comments about Herbalife, I have never once mentioned "active new members." There would be
no harm to the company if they delete the term for usage at earnings and delete the database.

"given that it seems to have been created as an internal statistic to address that Ackhole."


HLF told the SEC "The Company began tracking this non-financial metric in 2015 in connection with certain
marketing plan changes."


"There would be no harm to the company if they delete the term for usage at earnings and delete the
database."


It's not about harm, it's about benefit. If HLF tracks it, it must be because they think it is relevant to the
business or investors. HLF benefits when people understand the company and their business model, which is

All I'm saying is, I owned the stock before yesterday, I bought more yesterday, and I don't care about internal
member statistics as much as I do the bottom line and the top line number$.


Again, I bought more stock yesterday. I would imagine Bill Ackman did as well as he was totally silent. Any
other time something like this came out over the last 3 years, the first thing he would do is get a camera and
mic in his face.


While it's understandable that Bill doesn't want to show his face these days since he is one of the biggest
losers (of money) in the world, he had to use Whitney as his proxy right here. That indicates to me that Bill
used the opportunity and high volume to cover some of his losses. If he didn't, he is a fool.

"April 14, 2013" 
what a historic day for HBL. 
(EB) Earn Base is synonymous with the declaration of independence. 
of July 4, 1776..  
Earn Base is an unnecessary additional layer of complexity so the wall street smarties or the FTC for that
matter, have absolutely no chance at understanding the complex encrypted hieroglyphics that the cons want
you to believe is simple.. Actually, there are three ways: 
1. Confuse people with numbers ..(it's simple math; don't over think it), even if you are like the corporate
strategist that attend each and every STS, if you don't understand it, let HBL computer calculate it. Absent
Gross or Net,, that is up to you.. Business Owner.. like MOJO said: Good Luck with that,, SEE YA!! 
2. Sell the Dream, SuperMan, SuperWoman, as MOJO would say, You Betcha!!  
Mojo has stated that $1000 a year is a lot of money.. Your 1st 1000 is always the hardest. TRUE in MLM, it is
very very rare.. I doubt that a mere President member earns anything close to it.. They will never admit it..
though.. in fact I have not even seen an Executive PT make a Positive Cash Flow,, they are still trying to
Recoup their multiple losses.. Personally, the only way to get ahead of the "WAVE" is to recreate one of the
original systems the TOP 132 have built their Fortunes on..too bad they have missed their chance.. HBL is
ruthless and cold and won't hesitate to cut any new comers off.. They still tolerate Doran Andry and all his
President's Men/Woman..tool traitors..

Try becoming a real estate agent and spending thousands of your own money just to get a "job" with no
salary or benefits while your broker takes 50% of your profits for their supervision. 
Life isn't easy and money doesn't grow on trees, but if you can overcome an ingrained sense of entitlement

"Try becoming a real estate agent and spending thousands of your own money just to get a "job" "


Actually, the only money you spend is on a $10 review book to take the salesperson exam and the money you
spend to get to the test facility and back. Once you pass, you can start working... Sounds cheaper than HLF.

Wez,


Per usual, you're wrong.


No state in this union allows a real estate agent a license without taking a test that alone costs hundreds of
dollars. The required schooling before you can sit for the test costs hundreds of dollars. Periodic continuing
education and license renewal exams will cost you hundreds of dollars to maintain. Marketing costs between
nothing and tens of thousands of dollars.


While it may be convenient for you to spread more misunderstandings about alternative entrepreneurial
enterprises, your understanding of business in general is quite limited.

The rest was spot on, I know because I bought my review book for $10 used, passed the exam and had
brokers calling me to sell with them.


Way back, before I bought my first house, I got interested but ultimately decided against doing anything in
Real Estate.


Sorry Skrambled, wrong again buddy.


Hope this helps.

scrambled said: """Try becoming a real estate agent and spending thousands of your own money just to get a
"job" with no salary or benefits while your broker takes 50% of your profits for their supervision."""


That's not exactly a great defense to the vast majority of HLF members never making a dime.

Nobody ever said that the vast majority of people seeking to make income from Herbalife products don't make
money. Obviously, they do - just look at the product sales.

You have no obligation to buy products on a monthly basis and your income is based on your ability to work
hard ! Can't be bothered = 0 income, work hard = unlimited income :-)

Right, Scrambled, not to mention the amount of time it takes before your first sale in real estate. I have agent
friends who still haven't earned after 2 years. They have to be self supporting to get started and survive the
first year or so. Very few earn straight away. With HLF you can start selling the products right away and get
some decent cash. And yes Wez I KNOW this to be true.


03 Mar 2016, 03:40 PM


Wez
Comparing the income potential between HLF snake oil sales and Real Estate sales is laughable. I'm
currently looking at paying my listing agent $80k when my house sells. That would probably put an HLF
distributor up on stage if they made that once in their lifetime...


Suggesting that Real Estate sales comes with costs that a serious attempt at success in HLF wouldn't also
have is also nonsense.

Skrambled80s,


"Obviously, they do - just look at the product sales."


It's not obvious at all. Plenty of product is being purchased by participants, and participants are being
encouraged to take plenty of product as if their financial lives depended on it, but there is no data showing
whether plenty of product is being to sold consumers and for what price.

While they are not obligated, they are encouraged to purchase from their own product lines where they not
only get a discount, they also accumulate towards earnings. Problems do arise when a contest is announced
and a dealer is falling short (including team) to qualify for winning(s), they buy more product in advance and
the stocking begins. Another contest is announced and the IBO stocks up some more. Many qualify, but there
is always a preset number of winners. Two - three years later and the attic, garage, basement and every
pantry is loaded with product. Product is expiring and while they can return it, returns cut into the sales. The
IBO is failing miserably within the first year but who's counting. That IBO's recruiter or up-line is responsible
for the success of their recruits and should be paying attention to the order levels these poor souls are placing
just to win a contest yet no client list where potential recruits exists. I know for a fact that some of the up-line
encourages to buy more because it also increases their chances to qualify as well instead of guiding them on
how to build their business. I understand the MLM businesses very well and they are legitimate. However, as
in all circles of life, there are always bad apples that should have been removed but instead, like everything
else, no one sees anything and the problems become unmanageable.

Wez...


You said...."Actually, the only money you spend is on a $10 review book to take the salesperson exam and
the money you spend to get to the test facility and back. Once you pass, you can start working... Sounds
cheaper than HLF."


Now, although I don't write on HLF any more, I still read the board occasionally, and I caught that comment of
yours. Now, I can't speak for all states, but I can speak from first hand experience and checkbook about the
state in which I live.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 36/105


Background: I moved to a new area more than a decade ago and for kicks I decided to get a Real Estate
license. I had no intention to do residential real estate as a business, I was just interested in the the possibility
of doing some real estate investing in my new local market and thought getting a real estate license might be
a good way to begin to learn about the local market. I've kept my license active for more than a decade, but
other than that I haven't done anything with it.


I can give you a detailed accounting of costs, but suffice to say that just to keep my license active costs me
over $1,000/year. It comes primarily from fees to be in the MLS, the cost of joining a local Realtor Association
(required to get access to the MLS), and smaller annual fees to the State Real Estate Department.


The start up costs are also pretty expensive and take a lot of time. The original license requires taking
approximately 100 hours of required classroom courses (cost about $400) plus take an additional required
course in writing buy/sell contracts ($100) plus take a school exam on everything involved in those 100
classroom hours ($75) plus a take a state exam ($75) plus jumping through a few other assorted hoops
required by the state.


In addition to the start up and annual costs, there is a continuing ed requirement that takes nearly 30 hours of
classes and passing exams. It only costs about $150, but you have to do it.


The point is that it takes a lot of time and a lot of money to get started and there is a lot of money involved
annually before one can earn his/her first dollar.


Now, this relates to HLF only because others have brought up the comparison of becoming and staying a real
estate agent against the start up and continuing costs of becoming an HLF distributor.


Obviously, again in my state there is no comparison. I believe a similar story is true in all states, but I can't
speak to that first or even second hand.


Now, in the large area where I live, there are more licensed real estate agents than annual residential sales
and the 20/80 rule applies. A little more than 20% of the agents do just over 80% of the business. The
remaining 80+% of the agents do some but very little annual business.


Maybe there are some other business metaphors to being an HLF distributor, but I can't think of anything as
inexpensive to get into.


The same arguments have gone on here ad infinitum for more than 3 years about HLF's distribution network.
I won't begin to say anything about that directly. I wrote about my beliefs a long time ago, nothing is changed
for me, I have nothing new to add to that conversation (or argument) and I haven't read anything new from
those on either side of the trade in 2 or 3 years. All I'm discussing here is something I know for certain from
first hand experience, which is the cost in money and time to be a real estate agent in my state.


People on this board, in an effort to discredit HLF, have said that being a real estate agent costs the same or
less as being an HLF distributor. That is simply wrong.


Until the subject was brought up on this board by others I would not have thought it was relevant.

You're wrong on cost and cost of time and marketing . 
An agent's license is held by a broker who takes 50% of commissions. In some states an agent must be
licensed for years before they can become a broker. Many brokers sell little product themselves and most of
their money managing their downline.

there any realty firms that have 4 million salespeople, who mostly sell houses to each other and not to the
general public?

This conversation is irrelevant to HLF, but seems to be fun.


In my state, the start-up requires spending over 100 classroom hours plus about $650 to get your state real
estate license -- in my state that is called being a licensee/salesman. But, before you can list or sell your first
house you need to be associated a broker where you "hang" your license. Where I am, the front end start up
requirements don't end there. In order to get access to the MLS -- the heart and soul of residential real estate,
you have to join one of the multitude of local Realtor Associations and then you can join the MLS. Those two
things alone are around $700 to $1,000 depending on a few factors. It's only after you've gone to all the
classes, taken all the tests, hung your license with a brokerage firm, joined an association and joined the MLS
that you can go out to do your first sales/listings.


In my state, before you can sell the first house you've invested well over $1,000 hours and over 100
classroom hours.

Why even ask that question, it has no relevance to the discussion about MLM and HLF selling predominantly

percentage of transactions to employees, of course a Realty firm is going to buy and sell a few transactions
from employees.

True, but not all. Most become members having been a customer and were offered the opportunity to become
their "own boss". Here, they would be trained to sell and naturally, as a customer, they now buy the products
at a discount. Using the same technique that enticed them to become an IBO, they repeat the process with
their warm market (friends, family & coworkers, etc.). As their confidence grows, they work the cold market by
introducing the product and then the opportunity. No IBO should be sitting on more than two weeks of the best
selling inventory. If properly managed, they could run it with no inventory as they can get product quickly or if
desperate, another IBO may have and help by swapping/costing. This is no scam, however, some ruin it for
many by running their teammates to ruin and those will hate the company. I know someone who is quite
successful in Herbalife and has a deep team that is also very wide and she runs it smooth. Once a customer
believes in the product as it works as intended, she asks if others she knows would benefit from it and show
her how she can make money and save some too. She ensures that every potential recruit is willing to work
hard before approaching with the opportunity as many are simply customers. Early on, as with any MLM,
many are excited that they are starting their own business but do nothing at all to get to first base. Qualifying
your recruit is more important because it will save you a whole lot of time, energy and frustration. It doesn't
pay to have a team of 100 if not one earns you a dime but cost you. The only way to fail in HLF IBO
opportunity is if you don't work it as intended. In Real Estate, however, you can go without selling a home for
months no matter how hard you work it.

Speculative: The problem isn't from the scenario you described as long as the overwhelming bulk of products
are being sold the general public. The problem comes when recruiting ad infinitum happens amist the upline
making money from people's inevitable failure. This happens because the comp plan rewards recruiting more
than selling. When recruiting is more profitable than selling and the upline makes money when purchases are
made and not when sales to CUSTOMERS actually occur, then you have a product-based pyramid scheme.

You're missing other CRITICAL distinctions, specifically the incentives that direct people to behave a certain
way. In Real Estate there's only ONE "upline" commission level. There are no downline commissions for
agents to recruit their own competition, who then in turn, recruit more people, who then even recruit more
people. This is despite the fact that almost all of these people are completely unnecessary and you've
destroyed the ability of everyone or almost everyone to make a living by selling to the public.


In legitimate business, money is made by selling to customers. In MLM, money is made by from the
purchases of recruits and not from the selling of products to the PUBLIC.

A new member packet is under $100 and not much commission is made from that member. Far more is made
by growing a team who not only use the products they used to buy and pay more for but train them to be self
sufficient so hey can train their team(s). It not easy work but that is what many new members believe because
it seems so. If it was really easy, then everyone would be doing it.


Here is HLF's statement of average gross compensation which clearly states that no one gets paid by simply
recruiting/sponsoring a new member. So how is recruiting more profitable than selling?

of a % of the commissions of the recruit. Most frequently, an agent with some experience will "mentor" an
agent with less experience and take a % from the newbie out of the supervising broker's cut.

You mention "to recruit their own competition." It is demonstrative of the benefit of a downline to the
distributing upline member and their downline member that rather than compete with one another the
members can co-exist and profit together. If not for participation in the downline member's profits, the upline
member would have no incentive to bring in the downline member as they would be perceived as competition.
Since they are essentially on a team together through the up/downline structure, the incentive is for them both
to succeed rather than for one succeed at the expense of the other.

"In legitimate business, money is made by selling to customers. In MLM, money is made by from the
purchases of recruits and not from the selling of products to the PUBLIC."


 
I managed retail operations for over 20 years and believe me, your statement couldn't be further from the
truth.


As a manager, my employees broke their horn and got paid hourly. My salary was derived from those broken
horns and so was my boss, his boss and all the way up to the CEO. This in the corporate world is the real
pyramid that everyone has come to accept as the norm; modern day slavery to say the least. In this
"legitimate business", the CEO makes the most $$$ and limits how much pennies to his $$$ you can make.
The CEO doesn't set up a plan for your success but he surely has his laid out for him/herself. In legitimate
businesses, commissions on sales start low for the seller and higher into management yet, in MLM it's the
other way around.


Surely, some or many try to operate their MLM IBO their own way as in all MLM's and give the companies a
bad reputation but those who follow the systems achieve success they never dreamed of.


I knew this guy on this link when I was younger and he made it huge with PRIMERICA and he tried recruiting
me in my early 20's. I have sat with him for dinner after he has made it but didn't want to leave my slavery
lifestyle just yet. He is a multimillionaire having a team of multimillionaires below him by following their proven
system; similar to HLF's. It works for those who really want it but even in Primerica, bad apples exist there
too. Trust me, I know.


This one here Eddie Ayala was a cop in Bronx NY and also joined Primerica making millions. I used to hang
out in his home in upstate NY.

Bill Ackman and his web of trolls, shills, and paid assassins has taken his investors money to the lowest level

""How does someone make money "buying from themselves"?" 
Actually,.. Des Walsh Publicly stated on CNN money watch, when asked how the business model works.. he
stated, "you buy your discount then sell it",, he just parroted John D. Simeone though, see herbalife ir.com
transcripts..'


Too Bad, the replay on CNN was cut off.. my question who edited it short.. One is they redacted the grin of the
prez's evil grin, I'm not gonna say anything about his teeth, but there was a close up.. He just might need
some dental work, and as a disclaimer, I am not a dentist,, nor prevent or cure required dental issues.. And/or
there was some non intentional correct information that was stated that could potentially get HBL in boiling

" Most people just run out of money and quit." 
My Goal as an up line is to inherit your downline. I make more money when they roll up to me.. My evil desire
is that I spend you right out of business..  
Even as Susan Peterson.. will say "NOW that's is just Wrong!" with he southern accent she will advise you to
do whatever is in her best interest.. Front LIne, Front Line,, oh Really, is that how you build Susan! Leon W.
and Mark H. always stated that "chasing the business will give you depth" Security through Depth? Oh, I see
they are building Security for you because Front loading SV's on the Front line not only mean $$$ for you, but
simultaneously your forcing them to quit indirectly because the pyramid structure collapses faster like
that...You don't want to wait three years, when 6mos. to a 1 year is faster.. 
I've seen newbies fly from the west coast to the east coast just because they believe some "one" they are
attempting to recruit via Facebook states they will attend.. an STS.. It is so OBVIOUS to anyone that has
been observing the industry that this as Mark Hughes would say.. "BRAIN DAMAGED"..this woman, running
around, like a chicken without her head, (working so hard, the wrong way VIA Social Media and passing out
Flyers.. etc. she could not see the forest from the trees! Yep, she's out, misses Local STS now, Flying around
the country attending with reckless abandon, hit and run, "Marisol", Go Marisol, a waste of a human being..
from the moment she was swaying her "behind" to the pounding frenzy of hypno trance music while sipping

GO, Girl, she gave it everything she could, total ostrich head in the sand, Doey Eyed "as if "she stood in the

The questions for the survey are not on your link.


And page 41 has conflicting information. How can 92% of sales be to non distributors? That is very conflicting
when at the same time. Herbalfie claims that 73% of their distributors were customers who joined for a
discount. These two numbers indicate that the books were cooked or Herbalife didn't check out their
numbers.


Based on what we've seen lately, Herbalife issuing wrong numbers wouldn't be implausible.

oh boy. Math again. The two sets of customers who are distirbutors and customers who buy at retail are two
non overlapping sets. If you ad the 40 or so percent that joined only for the discount and had no expectations
of earnings, plus the sales outside the distributor network. There are two groups, people who bought the last
three months and survey of ex distributors. You're trying to foot those lol. Statistics...good old statistics. And
then you draw the conclusion that the books must be cooked. Shorts.

What information do you believe Herbalife has, that hasn't been provided to the FTC, that would "support their
side"? Really curious as to what that "information" might be? Do you believe Herbalife is withholding
information from the FTC?

This data is the most important metric Herbalife have to project future growth because it is active distributors
who are the drivers of the ongoing recruiting and future growth. Less members, less recruiters, less
conscripted consumption means less growth going forward.

Well, call me normal but this company is a saturated one trick pony that has no other diversified income
streams or income channels to fall back on other than endless churn of new members to self consume
volume points and recruiting others to do the same to drive forward growth.


Couple that with an admitted ongoing FTC investigation, downwardly revised sales member metrics, a
useless database and a business opportunity that needs to recruit around 2 million members per annum and I
would not invest, buy the commodity, or recommend the business opportunity to anyone.

How can projections remain the same? the growth or shrinkage of member base is a key precursor to gains or losses
in critical financial performance numbers. if member base growth is laughably misunderstood, and overstated, seems
a layup that future financial projections must be reduced as well.


And the database excuse is pathetic--i operate a large database in my business, and we would never run anything
ever without manual testing of any process we engage. What a complete joke. This routine is shocking even with

What is Herballife management's take on this? Are they claiming technical incompetence or ignorance? I
know they cannot be admitting fudging the numbers, so which is it - incompetence or ignorance? This is a
multi billion dollar company, and no one knows if their reporting data is accurate?


Also, if they are so incompetent as to be unable to read information from a few database tables over the
course of three earnings reports, what else are they misreporting due to these database issues?


This whole thing is absurd and getting more ridiculous by the minute. But judging from the initial reaction
(shares -7%), shareholders don't really care. Guess they have been conditioned to ignore bad news.

User - I completely agree with you. HLF is blaming a technical issue using language (database scripting error)
that is familiar to a very small group of investors. However, this is even worse if you consider this from a
business and not purely and IT (database error) perspective.


If HLF truly had 16.7% worldwide growth in "Active New Members" and a 71% increase in North America
alone think of the increased support that would go along with such a massive increase in members. Incoming
emails, questions from members, help desk calls, amount of outgoing printed materials, number of welcome
packets, number of people on local/regional sales calls, product manufacturing increases, etc., etc., etc.,
would have all seen a corresponding spike.

Meanwhile in China, the stock market bubble has burst, capital flight is causing instability to the economy,
decades' worth of foreign reserves are being spent in the span of a few months to prop up the currency, and

To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of, or the productivity of, our Members. Accordingly,
our success depends in significant part upon our ability to recruit, retain and motivate a large base of
Members. The loss of a significant number of Members for any reason could negatively impact sales of our
products and could impair our ability to attract new Members. In our efforts to attract and retain Members, we
compete with other network marketing organizations, including those in the weight management, dietary and
nutritional supplement and personal care and cosmetic product industries. Our operating results could be
harmed if our existing and new business opportunities and products do not generate sufficient interest to
retain existing Members and attract new Members.


Our Member organization has a high turnover rate, which is a common characteristic found in the direct
selling industry. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding sales leader retention
rates.

HLF itself, in it's annual report has stressed the importance of recruiting members. If the guidance that
management has given was even partially based on incorrect metrics, then this is a cause for concern for
investors for future revenue, profitability, and the adequacy of the business model. It also raises other
questions that Tilson here has brought up.

In MLM's it is a fact that there will always be recruits. It is also a fact that many will explore the opportunity out
of a number of emotional choices such as friends and family do sharing moments. Anyways those that join
and follow the system by selling and of course, buy the products they used to buy from their recruiter, now get
it from their own ordering at discounted prices. They recruit and repeat the process teach their recruits the
same. That's an active member. Then there are the ones that join and do nothing. They are new and they are
a member but contribute nothing to grow their team, don't sell and many stop buying the product but did from
their recruiter. Idiotic to say the least but when some join, they become hermits and even the recruiter can't
locate their recruit. Believe me, I know. So, does the member thing make sense now?


06 Mar 2016, 12:16 PM


The Conservative Investor
@speculative


Yes, good description and I agree that active members are the moneymakers for Herbalife. New active
members are therefore the drivers of revenue and earnings growth. This is precisely why Herbalife makes
such a big deal about new active member growth.


A lot of comments here focus on the wordplay between "new members' and "new active members", but it is
the latter that drives growth. Even if it is non-GAAP, there is a reason they created this statistic.


Now, here's the question: if Herbalife cannot or will not keep an accurate count of new active members, which
is more material to the business than new members who are classified as non-active, what confidence is
there that the total member and total new member counts are accurate?


For that matter, what confidence is there that management won't simply blame database errors for any other
restatements they make in the future?

User 9747281,


For the purpose of reporting their quarterly results, it is not necessary for them to report those numbers. Why
they do is beyond me. There is absolutely no way they can come close to being within 10% accuracy in
forecasting future revenue and earnings by how many members in any new category they gain/lose. They
can double the number of members every quarter for the next ten years and if they don't produce
sales/revenue they can only report the actual and forecast from those reported revenue and earning trend.
Yes, they dropped the ball in an extremely idiotic fashion believing that using those metrics would make them
stand out and it blew up in their faces. They seem to be counting their chicks by the number of eggs they
have.


Reporting revenues and earning based on product sales whether to recruits/customers is the metric they
should be utilizing. Of course, they may want to highlight the best selling product and most profitable but the
headcount(s) don't have an enforceable revenue production as every recruit even veterans produce sales that

If it were me, I wouldn't want to be recognized in public due to the embarrassment and humiliation that awaits.

Assuming these numbers weren't generated on purpose (i.e. the database script was designed to collate data

Given how management championed this metric on earnings calls it should be damning evidence by itself
that you cannot trust Herbalife's numbers at face value. But again, the market is shrugging it off, so most
people believe otherwise.


@Skeemp Lapoonski


This is not a criminal or civil trial and you as an investor do not have to wait for a smoking gun. When there is
doubt about the accounting of a company, you do not have to wait until the evidence becomes overwhelming.


Whenever I see shareholders dismiss huge discrepancies in a company's reported numbers, I see a disaster
waiting to happen. In this case, the excuse given is ridiculous and does not pass a basic sanity test - they
would have you believe that the supposed database error was specific to this one metric, and one metric only.


If this is bias, it is bias backed by history. The warning signs were there before Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities collapsed in a smoldering heap, just as the warning signs were there before Enron, WorldCom,
Waste Management, Tyco, AIG, Lehman, etc. etc. etc. all met their own judgement days in the end. The
shareholders suffered enormous losses every time.


If you know your history, this is exactly the type of warning sign to look for. Now there is a possibility that
everything is fine and it is a one time oversight as you say. The market is going along with the story Herbalife
is telling, just like it went along with the stories those now infamous companies told before judgement day. But
you don't have to be complacent and you don't have to go along with the market consensus that everything is
fine.

Herbalife is such a fraud it's not even funny. Any moron with any sense can see how unreliable their financials are. In
Feb '16, they had to make a restatement because 2 cents of earnings was mis-allocated between fiscal years. And
now we have non-financial statement adjustments which generally overstated sales. If these events don't
demonstrate cooked financials and the need for the SEC to step in and close down HLF, I don't know what does. SEC

You must be thinking of Valeant Pharmaceuticals which has yet to release Q4 of FY 2015 earnings (uh oh,

Valeant pharmaceuticals is PSH's largest holding. PSH is short many shares of Herbalife, but how many is
undisclosed. PSH has been advertising across the world that HLF is a pyramid scheme, in order to
manufacture sales declines in the company and manipulate shares of HLF stock.


PSH's liquidity and solvency would seem to be in question, and consequently HLF is highly likely to incur
short term upward spikes in share prices while Valeant is likely to decline to levels not seen in a decade for
the unforeseeable future.

So the grand question is how does this new information that has nothing to do with actual earnings effect
Herbalife's just recently released earnings report at a financial level. The answer is, it doesn't. The only
reason these numbers are released is to help investors understand the field in it's entirety, it when reported
accurately is a helpful nugget, when it isn't its useless. The truth is had the correct numbers been in the filing
no one would be talking about it.

"Not true, the difference is neither "semantics" nor "wordplay". One is an internal metric that the management
was clearly attempting to use to measure something (what exactly hasn't been defined AFAIK), and the other
is a metric reported in their SEC filings."


"Yes, they made a mistake ... by all appearances an honest, innocent mistake that, once discovered, they
quickly corrected with an 8-K filing."


@Skeemp Lapoonski


They made up this non-GAAP metric and repeatedly used these "honest, innocent" mistakes on that metric to
highlight their growth worldwide. I doubt you or the other longs even bothered to read through the 8-K filing,
so here's another hidden gem nobody noticed:


“For example this quarter the number of active new members and our North American region was up 33
percent” – comparing the 3 rd quarter of 2015 vs. the 3 rd quarter of 2014


Corrected value: 1.8%


“[U.S.] Active new members were up 33 percent compared to the same quarter last year.” – comparing the 3
rd quarter of 2015 vs. the 3 rd quarter of 2014


Corrected value: 0.8%


So apparently, they forgot about Canada altogether in the first statement, or they thought Canada stayed flat
for the quarter, or they just didn't care, or they made up the numbers and forgot to account for Canada. They
weren't shy about touting that 33% growth number for both US and North America. Actual numbers are 0.8%
and 1.8%. You would have people believe that management didn't notice this kind of stuff before, during, or
after the earnings call?

Ok, why not make up a metric called "New Awesome Members" and post that it's up 1000% yoy? Then go

Of course I have some ideas that mirrors the other *speculation* we see here, but I'm not going to allow

The problem with fraudsters like Herbalife is they start getting cocky. Herbalife has been getting away with blatant
fraud and exploitation for more than 30 years. They openly mock regulators. They make up new words and
propagandize them to give an illusion of growth, when in reality none exists. They have a long history of lies,
manipulation, and devious, criminal behavior.  
This is not sustainable forever. The scrutiny they are under will not go away.  
Herbalife is not able to reform itself. It is corrupt to the core.  
Herbalife will ultimately go to zero. When? Not soon enough. But it's getting closer...

Old Analyst, Contributor
As anyone who followed what I used to write here knows, I said, "Sayonara" a while ago to writing on this board.
However, I do read it from time to time to see if there are any new ideas that will help me make (or avoid losing)
money in the stock.


In the last couple of days I've had a few extra minutes and "came back". It is like entering a time warp. Or maybe it's
just like the movie "Groundhog Day" (if you don't remember it, look it up on IMDB.COM).


The same people are saying and/or screaming the same useless sound bites on both sides of the issue that they
were doing before I left. I notice that QTR has apparently returned after leaving to go to Twitter and wherever else.
Matt still writes negative articles, except they have slowed to a trickle since the one or two a week when I left. The
same people who love MLM are still here saying the same things in sound bites, as are the same people who hate
MLM. Lately, it seems the MLM lovers -- and a few actual long stockholders -- come out in force when the stock goes
up and the MLM haters -- including a couple who actually are short some stock -- come out when the stock goes
down.


Almost all the articles are still negative, although there has been some positive news and the stock is acting
reasonably well given the intense downward market pressure. In general, there are a lot fewer articles, probably
because the Bulls are long gone from this board and the Shorts look a little silly writing when the stock is soaring. It
seems QTR and some of the shorts are still up to their old tricks -- the last QTR article took the most convoluted logic
possible and picked the least likely leg of a decision tree to warn that the "market" was dead wrong when it read what
HLF said about discussions with the FTC. In the past, I've said over and over again on this board that investing is all
about batting average and playing the odds. Future evolution related to even the strongest business, market or
regulatory developments is always uncertain. But, if there is a development that is, say, 85% positive and 15%
negative, you can count on the shorts to focus their entire discussions/arguments on the 15% and ignore the other
85%.


There is yet another "Groundhog Day" phenomenon still on the board. Whenever there's an article published,
regardless of the article's topic, the same people use the Comments section to say the same things they said in the
past gazillion Comments sections.


Ah, well... "Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose."


Does ANYONE, on either side of the stock, have ANYTHING NEW TO SAY that might help an investor like me make
(or avoid losing) money? If you do, please drop me a personal message at SA as I'm sure I will miss it here.

Old Analyst:


Good to see you back. Always saw you as a reasonable person and worthy opponent here.


I agree with most of what you're saying.


I hear what you're saying on the Groundhog Day phenomenon. That's one reason I've toned down my posts.
Both sides have been saying the same things ad nauseum, even when there's newer and relevant news
being the real subject.


As far as your last question, "Does ANYONE, on either side of the stock, have ANYTHING NEW TO SAY that
might help an investor like me make (or avoid losing) money?"


I would say that this is a battle for billionaires to win or lose. I see it as a risky stock, both long and short, but
even more so if short. The risk:reward ratio just isn't there for either.


There's literally tens of thousands of other companies that don't have the legal risks and falling financial
metrics that Herbalife has. We can debate the legal risks, but not the published financials. In any case, even if
you can assume, for the sake of argument, that the chance of extremely negative or fatal legal action against
Herbalife is 10%, why not choose a stock that is closer to 0%???? There's not a shortage of quality
companies to choose from that don't have the risks and negative metrics that HLF has.


On the short side, the cost of puts or to borrow shares is insane. The thesis depends on the government
actually doing it's job to cripple or kill Herbalife, despite the lobbying and influence. I don't think Herbalife's
financials are going to cause them to go out of business anytime soon. I think it just whithers on the vine like
Avon, but that could take years to develop.

A company with close to 0% perceived legal risk will likely have limited upside prospects versus a company
where the market has priced in a 70% risk of legal action against it, and in particular when the 70% risk priced
into the stock corresponds with a real risk of 1%.


Herbalife will rise.

Jeff L...


Those are good questions about why I own the stock....

cost index funds where all I do is manage asset allocation.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 87/105


But, the essence of "Seeking Alpha" is to find assets (in this case, stocks) where you believe the market has
mis-priced the risk and reward.


In my article on SA from now many months ago (I think it was called something like, HLF: The Long Case) I
described HLF as the antithesis of a Graham and Dodd (actually, G & D and Cottle) stock. It is a classic
"Special Situation". By its very nature, the stock is likely to have a very wide range of possible outcomes. By
definition, risk and reward are opposite sides of the same coin. You are right that there are tens of thousands
of companies and their stocks that do not have the magnitude of legal and other risks associated with HLF.
But none of those have the reward potential either. Back in my article, I described HLF as stock that had the
potential to go up or down by a lot in a relatively short period of time. It isn't appropriate to compare it to a
Dow stock or many of the other thousands of stocks you refer to.


So, why do I own it? Because, almost all of my portfolio is built out of the kind of relatively low risk relatively
low reward stocks you characterize. I ALWAYS have a stock or two like HLF that I play with. If it triples or
goes to zero it won't affect my lifestyle one iota. To me, it's like playing poker at stakes I can afford. And,
having done this kind of stuff for a living many years ago, I find it fun. And, unless I had lots of money at stake
I wouldn't be the least bit interested. It's like playing nickel/dime poker; it's poker, but it really isn't.


(BTW, it is beyond my comprehension why so many people with no money at risk spend so much of their time
and energy on this board engaging in such emotional arguing about HLF. Why do they care? What else is --
or isn't -- going on in their lives?).


When I first heard about the Ackman attack in December 2012 I happened to have some extra time. So, I
spent a day or two full time learning as much as I could about it. The prospect of hedge fund titans on the
opposite side of a high stakes trade was just too much for me to pass up. But, unless I put a lot of money into
one side or the other of the trade, I basically would have spent no time on it going forward from there. It would
have interested me only in reading the occasional story I might see in my day to day reading.


Now, how do I see the stock...


I wrote about my case in great detail in the SA article I wrote that I referenced above. I have a lot of
experience, admittedly from a long time ago, in the way regulators work and what they try to do. Obviously, I
also have a lot of experience in securities research. And, I know quite a bit about the mindset and business of
hedge fund managers.


So, as I said above, the essence of Seeking Alpha in stock picking is to find mis-pricing in stocks. What that
means is that your analysis begins with understanding what is most important (much tougher than it seems)
followed by your own view of the likely future. And, then, somehow or other, trying to calculate what is already
built into the stock price and how that differs from your own expectations and then what happens if you are
right -- or wrong.


The strongest part of my bull case was (and still is) that I believe regulatory risk was and still is (although less
so now) overstated in the stock price. I defined "regulatory risk" as anything a regulator might do that would
fundamentally change the HLF business model in the long term and result in lower or non-existent growth
prospects. The extreme would be "shutting down the company" (which, from the beginning, I assessed at a
less than 5% probability). The other side is that there would be the equivalent of a financial hand slap and that
would be the end. What I expected was a significant financial hit coupled with some significant business
5/23/2018 Herbalife's Shocking Confession - Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 88/105


model changes, but nothing that would kill the company's long term prospects. Was that mispriced in the
stock? Back then, I believed that the market, as evidenced by the then current stock price, was pricing in a
risk of severe regulatory action at about 60% whereas my personal view was that it was 20%. If I was right,
that was a serious mis-pricing.


With recent developments, I think the market is pricing in a serious regulatory risk at about 40% while my own
view is that it's about 5%.


Shifting away from regulatory risk, I looked at business risk...


I thought Ackman's constant and highly public attacks were hurting HLF's basic business, maybe a lot.
Volume points and recruiting were going down. Not good. I thought that would limit the upside in the stock
and might increase the downside. But, once I analyzed that in great detail, I concluded that disclosure of all of
Ackman's political payoffs, purchasing of testimony from Hispanic groups, hiring Global Strategies group to do
what I believed were possibly illegal or breaking securities laws would all result in a reduction of his intense
public attacks. I've been dead right on that one! And, if that happened, I thought it would stop the downward
pressure on HLF's basic business. I wasn't right enough on that one. I underestimated how long the business
model changes HLF was implementing would have negative effect on their business.


Now...


I think the regulatory risk (as I defined it above as serious game-changing regulation) is less than 10%. I think
the recent increase in Volume Points may very well indicate a positive turnaround in the company's business.


So... as to the stock price... My thoughts...


If there is what I've defined as serious regulatory action, I think the stock drops sharply to maybe the 20 - 30
range. Maybe lower. There are hard and soft assets and cash to help support the price. It's not going to zero
in our lifetimes. But, as I personally asses that risk at less than 10%, I'm not spending a bunch of time
worrying about it.


On the business side, it looks like there is the beginning of a top line turnaround. Although I can see it taking
several more quarters before we really know that. I can still see the possibility of a bumpy road for the top line
in the next few quarters. But, it looks to me like the serious decline is over.


Given those circumstances, the stock seems reasonably priced at the moment.


BUT, as I expected all along, it sounds like the FTC resolution will be some sort of a negotiated settlement.
And, it sounds like it might be close in time. If that resolution is as I expect it to be, the regulatory overhang
will be gone from the stock. In those circumstances, I can see a significant pop in the stock.


I think you see a short term pop just from the resolution. Maybe $10 - $20. I see that happening fast, maybe a
couple of days or so. I think it is possible that some of the large short position is already unwound, but nearly
all the float is shorted. So, I still see a huge short squeeze as part of that pop, and it might go longer than a
few weeks.


And, if I'm right about the fundamental turnaround, that could easily push the stock up into the $80 - $90
range in 6 months or a year. Maybe more.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 89/105


So, that's my case... $55 now. Downside of, say, $20 - $25 (-60%) if there is horrible regulatory action. I give
that a 10% probability. My price/probability matrix is something like this:


$20/5% 
$30/0% 
$40/5% 
$50/5% 
$60/25% 
$70/35% 
$80/20% 
$90/10%


Expected Price: about $70 - 75


Under that model, my expected return in a year is about 35%. That would be spectacular if it happened. But,
it isn't for everyone, because there is such a huge range of possibilities. If you think any Dow stock is
prototypical of the kind of risk/return you like in your own portfolio, don't touch either side of HLF with a
thousand foot pole!


Totally separately, but interestingly... I think Pershing Square may be falling apart. If it does, Ackman or his
counter-parties will have to cover whatever is left of their short. That per se probably won't do much for the
stock. But, it will be a wonderful show watching the Wall Street hedge fund piranhas trading against Ackman.
In fact, he even complained about it in his most recent quarterly letter -- complaining that other hedge funds
were trading against him and they weren't smart enough to see the great things he saw! Why will Pershing
Square fall apart? First, investment performance is horrible. Not just bad... horrible. Clients can't live with that.
Second, Ackman is out of his sweet spot. He seems to have succumbed to a classic portfolio manager
failing... What worked at asset level A doesn't work as well or at all at asset level 3 or 4 times A. He sold his
clients on him being a focused activist. But, think about it. His assets are so large that he is forced into buying
relatively small stakes in larger companies where his personal power is much smaller than in the past. Is he
really pushing Mondelez into something they might not do anyway? Did he really think he was going to be an
activist and make serious changes at Valeant? Has he done anything at all active at Howard Hughes or
Platform Specialties? No. Today, Pershing Square is more or less just like any other hedge fund that picks
stocks it thinks will go up. Ackman's activism has essentially stopped. Even his gigantic ego and arrogance
must be seriously deflated by his highly visible shellacking in Valeant and his over the top emotional and
arrogant so-far failure vs. HLF. His HLF escapade has far greater negative impact on his "brand" as it does on
his portfolio. HLF is now one of the smallest positions in his portfolio. Third, there is one aspect of the
Pershing Square situation I haven't seen written about. His portfolio is down (as measured by Pershing
Square Holdings stock price and NAV) more or less 40% since its October 2014 launch. It's down even more
from its peak price a couple of months after launch. That means his portfolio has to go up by about 70% from
here just to get even from where it was about a year and a half ago. Guess what happens to his business? If
his partnership agreements are at all like others, he won't be able to take any carried interest until he gets
even. And he might even have to give up some of his 1-1/2% management fee. He could be working for
years, being really successful from here, without making serious money for himself. He will lose and won't be

able to attract great investment people to work for him if they can't make serious money because the firm
can't. And the chance he can raise a new fund are about zero. it is Gotham Partners all over again.


All of that has very little to do with HLF stock. But, considering Ackman has been the center of attention in
HLF for the past 3 plus years, it is interesting to watch.


Now, all of this has been rambling. It took me way longer than I thought to answer your question. I haven't

your high school English teacher would disapprove not to mention grammar mistakes and long windedness

You wrote so many words, yet you've previously ignored answering the below 3 questions, which only
requires 3 words.


"There is no evidence of inventory loading, the natural result of people buying more that they need "just to get
a larger discount". None. Zero. Nada."


Is the below inventory loading, yes or no?

"There is simply NO EVIDENCE and NO DATA to support Ackman's belief that HLF's distributors get paid for
recruiting."


The court in BurnLounge set the standard for determining whether rewards are paid for recruiting.


In HLF is it necessary to recruit to earn cash rewards, yes or no?


Is HLF's marketing plan set up to motivate participants through the opportunity to earn cash, yes or no?

Regardless, the questions are not irrelevant to your position in the stock, since you said "I am long partly
because I believe in the company fundamentally and partly because I believe that Ackman's arguments
simply don't hold together. "

Ackman's arguments include inventory loading and participants earning monetary benefits from recruiting.

Willy TSA,


Inventory loading is built into the Herbalife Marketing Plan, Matching volume orders Must be placed if a
distributor is "Short" Volume points at the end of the month. herbalife sends the member a notice at the end of
the month.


Not Placing a Matching Volume Order will lead to the Matching volume Permanent Penalty. Lose your
downline.


Also the Rule that members must resign before returning anything is inventory loading.


See; Herbalife Marketing Plan and Business Rules.

And Herbalife tricks members into recruiting free.

Skrambled80s
One small correction to OA's otherwise apt analysis: Bill Ackman's short position in Herbalife would not
appear to be small based on Perishing Square's last NAV report, which identified 1 short position representing
10% of NAV.


Between the deterioration of Pershing's portfolio and the realization by investors that Ackman's claims are
false, this could easily rise to a 15% of NAV short. It was only 7% of the portfolio not too long ago.

"And, if I'm right about the fundamental turnaround, that could easily push the stock up into the $80 - $90

So, that's my case... $55 now. Downside of, say, $20 - $25 (-60%) if there is horrible regulatory action. I give
that a 10% probability. My price/probability matrix is something like this:

@Old Analyst


First off, I appreciate your thoroughly constructed comment given your stated lack of time.


From what I can see in your comment, you expect there to be a 25+35+20+10 = 90% probability that
Herbalife stock trades up from its current price point in 6 months, with a 65% chance it could get you better
than a 20% return in that time.


That sounds like a screaming buy in anybody's book, yet you seem to maintain the air of someone who could
care less about the stock and have no interest in a position because it would take too much time.


Now I'm no poker player but something doesn't quite add up here and I was hoping, if you have time, that you
could explain how you came about that 90% probability of HLF stock going up in the next 6 months. If true,
this sounds like exactly the type of cigar butt investment for a Graham and Dodd investor. Thank you for your
time in advance.


09 Mar 2016, 03:53 PM


Old Analyst, Contributor
Because you asked me so nicely and didn't yell and/or scream, I'll be very happy to share my thoughts.


First, about my position... I have what I think is a very large position on the long side of the trade. My guess is
that it is very much larger than that of most if not all of the commentators on the board. But, of course, I don't
know that.


What you read that I said is that it really doesn't matter to me whether it triples or goes to zero, because it
won't affect my lifestyle one way or the other. Yes, I've been very fortunate in my business life. What I didn't
say so clearly and I'll try to repeat... I got fascinated by the situation in December 2012 and I decided I'd like
to pay very close attention to it as it evolved and developed. Knowing myself, the only way I'd actually do that
is if I had some serious money at risk (I consider any investment "money at risk", so don't read anything more
into those words). So, after doing some research and I decided I liked the long side better than the short side.


In fact, I've traded out of a portion of my trade from time to time, and every time I did it I decided I'd made a
mistake and re-purchased my position not that long after. The mistake was reducing the position at all.


Now, as to Graham, Dodd and Cottle... First, not to pick a nit, but I don't look at my own numbers quite like
you do. With the stock at 55, the way I think of it is that the 25% at 60 and the 5% at 50 are essentially the
same, and it says that the stock has about a 30% chance of doing nothing. That leaves me with a roughly
10% chance that the stock will go down and a 60% chance it will go up. If it wasn't clear, I was characterizing
and trying my best to assign probabilities, but they are 100% judgmental. If you or I wanted to add or subtract
10% from any of the point estimates I certainly wouldn't argue.

5/23/2018 Herbalife's Shocking Confession - Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 93/105


My general point is that I think there is a strong possibility that the stock is up in 6 months or a year. I think
there is a significant possibility it will be up a lot. I think there is a small (but not zero) percent probability it will
go down a lot. And I think there is a significant possibility it is more or less the same as it is now.


AND, all of that has a giant caveat... I don't believe in absolute price targets, even with the probability analysis
that I wrote. That's because I believe almost everything is RELATIVE TO THE MARKET. If we go into a bear
market, there is an old expression that says, "When they raid the house the take all the girls".


Now, having said all of that... Back to G, D & C.. I haven't read the book from cover to cover since my
business school days in my Investment Management class. My recollection is that although GDC discusses
"special situations" the fundamental analysis the book teaches doesn't really apply to them. Just for the
record, by definition, a "Special Situation" is a stock that is much more impacted by what's going on in the
company or in the stock's technicals (in this case, the large short position) than it is by the economy or the
overall market. I've always said that HLF is a special situation primarily because the range of future prices is
likely to be much larger than any group of random stocks. In this case, what the regulators do or don't do will
have dramatically more impact on the stock price than short term sales and profits. GD&C just doesn't do that
kind of stock very well.


So, is it a "screaming buy" as you put it? Well, I probably misled you a bit when I wrote my probability matrix. I
wrote it just to characterize my best thoughts rather than to be precise. And, reading it the way you did got
you to an appropriate observation. It's just that I didn't mean it the way I wrote it!


Having said that, I think it's a strong buy -- for me! I've said a few times that an investor in HLF needs to be
prepared for a much, much larger than usual price movement in a relatively short period of time. My best
guess is that it will be on the upside, which is why I'm very long. But I fully understand that I could be dead
wrong and the move could go the other way. Most individuals' portfolios can't live with that kind of reward/risk
spectrum. Mine can, and, frankly, I'm having fun with it.


As I reread your comment for the third time, I see I didn't directly address one of your points. You said... "yet
you seem to maintain the air of someone who could care less about the stock and have no interest in a
position because it would take too much time." My original comment seems to have left you with the
impression that I don't own the stock. My bad. What I thought was obvious (because I'd written it here several
times) is that I have a very large long position.


What I could care less about is paying attention to almost all the writers on this board. Nearly all have no
position in the stock, one way or the other. Nearly all are grossly too emotional to be serious investors. Nearly
all talk in sound bites. Nearly all focus on details and miss the big picture. Or, more likely, they use a handful
of examples to generalize about millions of HLF distributors. Nearly all the bears are just repeating what Bill A
says. The bulls aren't much better. Both sides, for the most part, are worse than politicians in Washington in
the sense that they see only one side of every issue and refuse to ever acknowledge even the possibility of
being wrong. Nearly no one (apparently, you, and a couple of others are exceptions) are willing and or able to
engage in stock-price focused discussion with the full understanding that left-brained logical disagreement
without being disagreeable is a really good way to learn something. And, for the most part, in a very long time
I haven't read a single NEW idea that is useful to me in evaluating my own position in the stock. And, it just
gets downright boring to read the same people saying the same things all the time.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3950696-herbalifes-shocking-confession 95/105


You did, and quite eloquently at that. I should have noticed that you mentioned you were long the stock, that
is an oversight on my part and led to a subsequent misreading of your bullish case for Herbalife. I too believe
that thoughtful disagreement leads to greater clarity for all parties involved.


Having said that, it seems we are in disagreement about this company. I believe with respect to companies
like Herbalife, where there is smoke, there is fire. The bullish case seems to revolve around the possibility
that


1) Herbalife will not be subject to regulatory actions that would materially affect its ability to continue to
operate in the manner which it has in the past.


2) Herbalife will continue to its trajectory of growth via acquisition of new members to replace older members
who either quit or stop actively buying and selling product.


Let's start by discussing point 2: I believe that with or without regulatory action, Herbalife cannot continue its
current rate of growth, or even maintain its current level of sales going forward.


As you mentioned, there is macroeconomic risk that would affect the Herbalife business model - much of the
world outside of the US is slowing, stagnant, or in recession. Herbalife has near zero growth inside the US, so
a lot of hope is pinned on Herbalife's expansion in China. With 300,000 members in China out of a reported 4
million, how explosive would the growth have to be in the next few quarters to meet the bulls' expectations?


Keep in mind that China's stock market bubble just burst, its currency is under attack, its forex reserves are
falling at unprecedented rates, and its housing bubble is reaching critical mass as we speak. Somehow,
Herbalife bulls seem to view China as the ultimate, limitless new frontier for growth and I believe they are four
years late to the party.


Now as to point 1: I believe it should be irrelevant to investors what regulators decide to do once they
complete their investigation. Why?


Because as an investor, you do not have to wait for definitive proof of wrongdoing to ditch your position in a
company currently under investigation. Where there is smoke, there is fire. Hedge fund activists like Ackman
and Icahn have drawn a lot of attention to Herbalife, and regardless of their positions in the stock that
attention has shown a very big, very bright spotlight on the company itself.


Is Herbalife doing anything improper by promoting a business model where its members are also customers,
where recruits send money up the next rung of the recruitment chain in a pyramidal fashion with members in
the bottom half experiencing near 100% turnover? Not my place to say.


However, with this spotlight, Herbalife has had to make a number of changes to how it reports its numbers
and the results have led to financials which have been underwhelming in recent quarters. Revenues are
trending lower as are earnings, and balance sheet deterioration has led to negative shareholder equity in the
company.


Now, the intense pressure of dealing with this spotlight has led to a restatement of its own specially
engineered non-GAAP metric (Active New Members) meant to track the growth of its highest contributing,
most profitable recruits. The excuse given (database error) is unbelievable, bringing forth the possibility that
either

a) management lacks the ability to accurately track numbers material to their core business


b) management lacks the interest to accurately track numbers material to their core business


or


c) management purposely doctored the numbers and used said numbers to promote the illusion of strong
growth in their core business


If you are a shareholder, none of these possibilities is good. In the best case, you are dealing with people who
have not mastered the art of tracking, checking, and collating data. In the worst case, you are dealing with
frauds. Coupled with the headwinds mentioned earlier and clear trend of deteriorating results, the only
catalyst for even a short term spike in price would be a favorable ruling from regulators.


As a result, the risk reward prospects here are very poor, and I see a high probability of loss for investors who
buy Herbalife stock. The amount of investor complacency coupled with the overly optimistic anticipation of a
favorable regulatory outcome leads me to believe we will see some truly horrific losses in the months to
come.

not want to do so,then he should keep his mouth shut-in a nutshell,I want to know Tilson's motivation relative to his
posts,as his losses are clearly an indication of where he is coming from-please do not tell me you have a problem with
that?

drolenc-one more thing:would you mind calling Mr.Tilson and ask him to defend his article-you are a surrogate,who
did not write the article-he did. As a result,it is incumbent on him to defend his self-serving position.While you are at
it,ask him whether he is long VRX and,if so,how much in the hole he is on that trade.You write a scathing article,at
least have the integrity to respond

Jricci,


I am not a surrogate, nor do I care what any specific person's position is. The size of Mr. Tilson's position is
his own business, and is only meaningful relative to his own portfolio and objectives. He did disclose he is
short, so why do you care how large a position he has? Does not knowing your position or anyone else's
position on this board mean they and you should all be silenced? Please grow up.

j.ricci
Mr.Tilson-I lied,it was not my final post-please respond as to your losses on HLF(and VRX)


06 Mar 2016, 12:40 PM


j.ricci
as i suspected-no response-just float a dire headline and remove yourself from any further discussion.Mr.Tilson,you
remind me of Bill Ackman,who floated a headline on CNBC that the higher-ups at HLF had all hired criminal attys in
anticipation of their soon-to-be-occurring "perp walk".How ironic is it, that it will be the executives of VRX that will be
making that "perp walk",if not Ackman himself.

I am short. 
But only 5 shares. 
I know it is a scam, but they manage to keep the shades down and placate the government. 
Tell you what. 
Become a sales person for Herbal Life and tell me how you feel about yourself. 
Like scamming your friends and family? 
The story is not over. But to me it is a giggle.

Whit, 
Now is a good time to regret your investment in Pershing Square and all of your additional positions that mirror Bills
portfolio. 
The Herbalife short game is over, the Valeant long game is over, and Perishing Square will soon be out of its misery.


15 Mar 2016, 11:38 AM


The Conservative Investor
Herbalife's stock is up about 5% since my last post highlighting the accounting issues and oversight at the company.
Apparently nobody cares about proper book keeping anymore, or maybe everybody just believes the regulatory
agencies have no chance of finding fault with a company that claims it hasn't mastered the art of reading a database
table.


The news have since shifted to Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a company with no business relationship to Herbalife
whatsoever, because Bill Ackman is invested with a long position in the former and a short position in the latter. I
guess one way to distract from smoke coming out of your house is to point to a house on fire elsewhere.


Lost in the noise is the latest revelation from Herbalife that they forgot to report expenses related to the protection of
their CEO. Yes, forgot. Fortune Magazine just shed light on the fact that Michael Johnson spent more than four times
what Donald Trump spent on personal security services last year.


Judging from the reaction in the stock, Herbalife shareholders agree that their top management guy needs four times
the protection afforded to Donald Trump. When the guy running your company spends more than four times what the
most controversial billionaire presidential candidates in recent memory does on security, you might want to ask why.
And more importantly, who's paying for it.


P.S. Did I mention this Michael Johnson guy sells granola bars for a living? I guess he must have really pissed off
Captain Crunch or the lucky charms leprechaun.

VRX was and is built on smoke and mirrors just like Mr.Bill's false and manufactured allegations against HLF. 
VRX will be going out of business. 
Pershing Square will be going out of business. 
HLF is here to stay and prosper. 
Imo. 
...the energy bars from HLF are delicious and I readily gobble them up every time I donate blood at the American Red
Cross....going today as a matter of fact.

Oh my. So, a vote for Herbalife is a vote for the American Red Cross? Or are you saying that ingesting HLF
energy bars allows you to donate blood due to some special dietary requirements?

Herbalife is the BEST INVESTMENT against ACKMAN Positions none of the Holders of HLF will SELL they are Here

a BIG POP

K, I am confused by the "contested civil complaint" option. Could it be similar to the one FTC filed against Pairsys,
recommending that the company is permanently shut down? ("contested" - I assume by HLF post filing.)

"So, here's Ackman's situation overall, and why I believe Pershing Square will fall apart in the next year or
less..."


At this point, it's hard to argue that this is actually possible.

Multi-Level marketing scam. 
But people cannot argue with the price. 
When it starts going a wee bit lower, will short more. 
I do not who this company is doing favors for, but eventually the truth will made certain.


20 Mar 2016, 01:44 PM

>>When it starts going a wee bit lower, will short more.


Hey, just a little free investment advice. You should wait for it to go "higher" to short more. Shorting when it
goes lower means you miss out on the price drop.

Much like Enron and WorldCom this stock can go a lot higher.When they have a Convention thousands of people
attend. They have Soccer players on the Board. 
Leave them alone. And they will leave you alone. They supply extra money for thousands of Americans. 
So why am I short. 
As for free investment advice, I will leave a few buck on the table, but I gotta wait for the trend to reverse.


03 May 2016, 09:53 AM


Davey Johnson
You do get, waiting to short more is a bit silly. Calling a trend reversal is pretty hard, if not impossible. So if you feel it's
going to $0 you should be shorting on the upticks, not the downticks.
