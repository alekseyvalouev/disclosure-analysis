https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 2/17


Three important parts of Mallinckrodt's (NYSE:MNK) story have gone unnoticed by Mr.
Market. First, the company is a serial acquirer and often hikes drug prices. Second,
Mallinckrodt has a large patient assistance program (Acthar Support and Access
Program) not specifically disclosed in its 10-K. Third, Mallinckrodt and Questcor paid
some top Acthar prescribers $100,000+ in speaking/consulting fees and two top Acthar
prescribers have been associated with Medicare fraud.


Serial Acquirer and Price Hikes


Mallinckrodt has made numerous acquisitions since going public in 2013:


(Source: Crunchbase)


These acquisitions are often paired with price increases. Finding drug price changes is
difficult, but a simple Google search shows that Mallinckrodt has indeed raised the
prices on some of its drugs:


The medication was introduced at $12.90 a vial. Cadence had increased the price to
$17.70 a vial by the time it was acquired by Mallinckrodt. After the deal, Mallinckrodt
raised it to $42.48 a vial, on an average wholesale price basis. Bloomberg October
2015


2,000% price hike on Synacthen Depot, a drug that treats a potentially dangerous
form of infant epilepsy. Mallinckrodt raised the price to $680 per vial from $33.05 per
vial earlier this year, Alberta health officials told CBC. FiercePharma November 2015

It is unclear where the Senate may set its sights next. But fresh Medicare data points
to a candidate right in Ms. McCaskill's backyard: St. Louis-based Mallinckrodt PLC. It
makes H.P. Acthar Gel, a 1950s vintage, off-patent drug whose cost has rocketed
from $40 a vial in 2001 to $38,000 today. New York Times December 2016


The New York Times quote references a recent report from the Senate Committee on
Aging titled, "Sudden Price Spikes in Off-Patent Prescription Drugs: The Monopoly
Business Model that Harms Patients, Taxpayers, and the U.S. Health System". The
report does not mention Mallinckrodt specifically, but some of Mallinckrodt's actions are
similar to those of Valeant (VRX):


Bloomberg October 2015 Story on Mallinckrodt Senate Aging Committee December 2016 Report


Within months, [Mallinckrodt] more than doubled
the price of the drug, called Ofirmev. Revenue
from the medication shot up, too, and hospitals


searched for ways to absorb the costs - large


hospital systems like Johns Hopkins Medicine and
New York University Langone Medical Center say
their expenses surged $1 million a year or more.
It's the same story that's been repeated throughout


the healthcare industry, as pharmaceutical


companies acquire medications and hike their


prices to reflect what they say is the fair value of the


drugs. That industry practice has come under fire in


recent weeks from lawmakers in Washington. In
this case, hospitals were able to fight back by
seeking other options, cutting into Mallinckrodt's
projected sales growth.


Hospitals interviewed by the Committee have also


been forced to make extensive changes, while


simultaneously facing significant uncertainties and


suffering enormous budget repercussions from the
price spikes. Nitropress and Isuprel, two Valeant
drugs, contributed greatly to the overall rising cost of


drugs for hospitals. The Johns Hopkins Health
System reported it suffered a $1 million hit in 2015
from price increases for Nitropress and Isuprel. In an
effort to reduce costs, these hospitals have taken
aggressive steps to reduce their usage of Nitropress
and Isuprel: cutting back or eliminating the use of


Isuprel on hospital emergency "crash carts";


substituting other drugs where possible; actively
seeking alternative approaches; aggressively
monitoring usage; and reducing inventories.


If you are still not convinced just look at the 10-Ks. The words "acquisition" and "acquire"
appear 371 times in Mallinckrodt's most recent 10-K, while "volume" is used a total of 16
times. Likewise, the words "acquisition" and "acquire" appear 906 times in Valeant's
most recent 10-K, while "volume" is used a total of 39 times.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 4/17


How has Mallinckrodt avoided the scrutiny of lawmakers? Maybe it's because
Mallinckrodt's U.S. headquarters are in the home district of Senator Claire McCaskill
(ranking member of the Senate Committee on Aging). Or maybe it's because
Mallinckrodt has been aggressively subsidizing co-pays for its largest and most
expensive drug.


Acthar Support and Access Program (A.S.A.P.)


What is the Acthar Support and Access Program? Search Mallinckrodt's most recent 10-
K and you won't find anything. I have not seen the Acthar Support and Access Program
mentioned in any Mallinckrodt SEC filing, analyst call, or investor presentation.
However, it seems that the Acthar Support and Access Program plays a large role in
patient procurement of Acthar. Below are two screenshots from websites for the
program:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 5/17


(Source: Acthar Website)


It is difficult to judge the size of the Acthar Support and Access Program because the
first website only says "Mallinckrodt has donated more than $774 million in Acthar at no
cost to patients" and the footnote discloses that the "Dollar figure refers to commercial
value of free drug based on data through June 30, 2015." The footnote does not
disclose when this program began. However, a more updated website shows that $1.04
billion in Acthar has been provided based on data through March 31, 2016.

(Source: Acthar Website)


From these two differing dates and amounts, we know that Mallinckrodt provided $266
million in Acthar at no cost to patients between June 30, 2015, and March 31, 2016. The
available evidence makes it difficult to determine exactly what this program does, but
based on the screenshots, I believe part of the program pays Acthar co-pays for patients
with private insurance.


What percent of patients with private insurance pay any co-pay for Acthar?


Mallinckrodt discloses net sales for Acthar in its SEC filings and Citron excellently
reported that roughly 61% of Acthar sales are to Medicare and Medicaid. This means
about 39% of Acthar sales are for private insurance (and therefore eligible for co-pay
assistance). Here's the math:

Net Acthar Sales
to Private
Insurance


$106.938 million $111.813 million $96.876
million


$315.627 million


Of the $315.6 million in eligible Acthar sales, we know that Mallinckrodt provided about
$266 million in Acthar at no cost to the patient. From this, we can conclude about 84%
of Acthar patients, not on Medicare or Medicaid pay absolutely no co-pay for
Acthar (266/315.6 = 84.3%). The practice of drug companies subsidizing the co-pays
for expensive drugs is commonplace, but the lack of disclosure seems odd.


Mallinckrodt is a $5 billion company, yet it doesn't specifically mention its $1
billion+ patient assistance program (Acthar Support and Access Program) once in
its 141-page 10-K. On the other hand, Questcor (the company that made Acthar
until acquired by Mallinckrodt in 2014) clearly disclosed the Acthar Support and
Access Program in its 10-K:


(Source: Page 6 of QCOR 10-K filed 2/26/14)


Going back to the first screenshot for the Acthar Support and Assistance Program, it is
important to pay attention to the footnotes:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/1/29087485_14840295579061_rId28.png

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891288/000125582314000005/questcor-10k2013.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 8/17


(Source: Acthar Website)


The second highlighted footnote mentions "independent charitable organizations." Why
doesn't Mallinckrodt directly provide the services? What is Mallinckrodt's relationship
with the independent charitable organizations that provide assistance for its largest
drug? Is Mallinckrodt receiving any tax deductions? (According to page 47 of its 10-K, "
[Mallinckrodt's] effective tax rate was negative 109.5% and negative 120.5% for fiscal
2016 and 2015, respectively.") Why is part of the program administered via a third-party
organization? Again, the available evidence makes it difficult to determine what exactly
this program does, so I e-mailed Mallinckrodt about the footnotes. I have not received a
response.


To add more confusion to the Acthar Support and Access Program, one patient
brochure says the Acthar Support and Access Program partners with a specialty
pharmacy to help patients get Acthar:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 9/17


(Source: Patient Brochure)


However, a search of Mallinckrodt's 10-K for "specialty pharmacy" yields no results.
Right now, there are many questions and few answers.


One question that Mallinckrodt has not answered is what percentage of its net income
comes from Acthar. If Acthar profits grew in line with sales, then we can figure out how
much of Mallinckrodt's profits come from Acthar (by using Questcor's data and
Mallinckrodt's Acthar sales disclosure).


Figures in $ millions QCOR 2013 MNK Acthar 2016 % Growth


Net Sales $799 million $1.150 billion 43.9%


Net income $293 million $422 million E 43.9% E

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 10/17


Mallinckrodt's 2016 net income from continuing operations was $489 million. Assuming
our estimate is correct, ~86% of Mallinckrodt's net income from continuing
operations was from Acthar (422/489).


This is a crude estimate but should work because substantially all of Questcor's net
sales and profits were derived from Acthar. This does not take into account any potential
synergies, tax advantages, or margin increases of Acthar under Mallinckrodt. (Please
note that Mallinckrodt's total net income in 2016 was $644 million. This figure is higher
due to discontinued operations. Using this figure as our baseline, Acthar accounts for
~66% of net income).


Paying Doctors


ProPublica published the list of the top 9 Acthar prescribers through Medicare for the
year 2014:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 12/17


Using the government website openpaymentsdata.cms.gov, we can track how much
these doctors have received from pharmaceutical companies. Three of the top 9
prescribers have received over $100,000 from Questcor and Mallinckrodt:


Prescriber Amount received from QCOR 2013 QCOR 2014 MNK 2015 Total


Sudhakar Tumuluri $57,312 $84,519 $27,318 $169,149


Vijay Singh $15,403 $98,434 $48,999 $162,836


William Wilson $66,416 $77,597 $30,742 $174,755


(Source: OpenPaymentsData)


The compensation table above includes speaking fees, consulting fees, travel and
lodging reimbursements, and food and beverage values, but does not include any
payment for research. Below is one page of the compensation data for Dr. Vijay Singh in
the year 2014, when he was the fourth largest prescriber of Acthar through Medicare:

Some doctors also may be understating the value of Mallinckrodt's gifts… unless you
can think of a 2-cent food:

(Source: OpenPaymentsData)


The open payments website only shows data going back to 2013, but some actions
before 2013 are certainly troubling. For example, Dr. Sean Orr of Florida, a "top
prescriber of Acthar", "had his license suspended for a year for allegedly having sex with
one patient, and he agreed to pay $150,000 to the Justice Department to settle a
whistle-blower fraud suit over bogus bills without admitting wrongdoing."


The government's complaint against Dr. Sean Orr doesn't mention Questcor or
Mallinckrodt specifically, but does mention the potential conflict of interest arising from
pharma payments:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4035674-mallinckrodt-valeant-junior 15/17


(Source: Law360 - page 12 of complaint)


Dr. Orr is not an isolated incident. According to ProPublica,"Gavin Awerbuch [was] the
most frequent prescriber of the [Acthar] in 2011." In November of 2016, Dr. Gavin
Awerbuch "plead guilty to health care fraud and distribution of controlled
substances."


On the opposite end of the spectrum, Doctor Mark Metersky (winner of the Alfred Soffer
Research Award) was troubled to find Acthar being marketed aggressively in the
medical journal CHEST. He wrote a letter to the editor questioning the lack of clinical
data supporting Acthar's use for certain medical indications. Here is part of what he said:


Because there may be unpublished or difficult-to-discover data regarding
corticotropin, I am hoping that Mallinckrodt can direct me and the readers of CHEST
to any reliable data that show that injectable corticotropin is more efficacious than
oral corticosteroids in treating symptomatic sarcoidosis. If no such efficacy data exist,
I see no justification for prescribing Acthar. The United States' increasing medical
costs are unsustainable, and this type of sales strategy by Mallinckrodt and
other pharmaceutical companies only exacerbates the problem.


Dr. Metersky is not alone. Insurance companies have also balked at Acthar's efficacy
and price. SA author Quoth the Raven pointed out that at a 2014 conference Dr. Ed
Pazella, a director at Aetna, was asked about Acthar. He said,


A combination of aggressive marketing and aggressive price increases finally
caused [Acthar] to become a line item that a finance guy looked at and said:
'What the hell are we paying for this? Why? What is it?' And that's when we started
looking at what's our policy around this stuff … We see a gradual decline, and
hopefully almost no use outside of infantile spasms within the next couple of
years. This is one of those things that's taking a while.

Conclusion


Lawmakers may want to take a close look at Mallinckrodt. Mallinckrodt has made
numerous acquisitions and large price hikes. Mallinckrodt has a large patient assistance
program dealing with an independent charitable organization and a specialty pharmacy--
none of which is specifically disclosed in its 10-K. Mallinckrodt and Questcor have paid
top prescribers of Acthar $100,000+ and the top prescriber of Acthar in 2011 recently
plead guilty to Medicare fraud.


In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: you see a cockroach in
your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives. Warren Buffett
