Summary


Now with Oceanica's EIA filed, environmental groups can comment on the claims
made by OMEX.


The Mayor of Comondu, where the project is based, has now formally spoken out in
opposition to the Oceanica project and supporting the Fisheries - will protest to the
President.


Fisheries Cooperative Society Production Puerto Chale, an important Fishing coop
and major contributor to the Baja economy is formally opposed to the project.


"We are completely against mining projects being established in this area, above all
within our municipality, as it aggressively threatens the different marine species and
ecosystems" - Mayor of Comondu.


At a minimum, it appears further scientific studies will be required to resolve
important questions for both the fishing economy and the gray whale population
impacts.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s Oceanica "Don Diego" project has its
EIA filed for roughly one month now which means the environmental groups can formally
begin commenting on it.

Oct 3, Constitucion, Baja California Sur (NYSE:BCS). During a meeting held in Comondú
town hall, attended by the Mayor, Perez Sanchez, representatives of the local fishing
cooperatives and various authorities, among them the Fishing secretary, José Fernando
García Romero, the rejection against a phosphate mining project, which aims to develop
in the Gulf of Ulloa, was made clear.


"We are completely against mining projects being established in this area, above all within
our municipality, as it aggressively threatens the different marine species and ecosystems.
So as the municipal government, we will lead all possible actions to prevent the "Don
Diego" project, promoted by the company Ocean Explorations, from being authorized in
the Gulf of Ulloa" said Mayor Pérez Sánchez before the fishing leaders.


Before the demonstrations against the project both by the state and municipal authorities,
and the industry, some agreements were made to initiate action against Oceanic
Explorations:


First, they will send a pronouncement to the head of SEMARNAT, in which the members of
the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Aquaculture will pronounce themselves to be fully
against the authorization of the Environmental Impact Statement for the project.

Second: the fishing federations will present a request to the delegation from SEMARNAT
(Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources) in BCS to hold a public meeting in the
municipality of Comondu, in the Emiliano Zapata Plaza, in Constitución.


Third: the state Fishing Secretary will seek the advice of Antonio González Vizcarra, the
former head of Semarnat in the state.


Fourth: there will be an open letter to President Enrique Peña Nieto, which will state the
total rejection of the approval of this project.


Fifth: a meeting was called for the Comondú Subcommittee on Fisheries and Aquaculture
for the next day, 8th October, at 17:00 pm in the presidential boardroom.

company Oceanic Explorations.


"We all depend, especially us, on fish stocks. The other groups are with us, they
strengthen us, support us, in order to say no to mining. Everyone is pulling the same
direction: towards a rejection of this project", said the leader.


The Puerto Chale Fishing Cooperative asked Jesus Camacho, leader of the National
Confederation of Fishing Cooperatives (CONACOOP), to take a position. This body, for
one, will seek out the head of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources
(SEMARNAT), José Guerra Abud, to let him know of the concerns the industry has in
California.


"We also ask Jesus Salvador Ojeda, president of the Ecology Commission, and part of
this sector, to intervene to see if he can get on the podium and make sure the information
is made   public," he added.


He said he will monitor the actions of the General Directorate of Risk and Environmental
Impact of SEMARNAT, and based on the result, "would decide upon how to proceed."


"I am confident they will back down, but am more confident in our own people, and that we
can confront this ugly monster. I cannot say that I trust (the federal government) fully
because I don´t know what is going on behind the scenes; you know there are many
things going on in the background ", he said.


Oceanic Explorations S de RL de CV submitted their Environmental Impact Statement, to
the General Directorate of Risk and Environmental Impact of SEMARNAT, on September
3, 2014, but the environmental authority decided to publicize the start of the process in the
Ecological Gazette on September 17, 2014.


The Puerto Chale Fishing Cooperative said that their fishing concessions are in danger,
because the phosphate mining project is located right within the same coordinates.


Marine mining will affect the Grey whale and fishing in Comondú; a public
consultation is sought

Sept 24 - La Paz, Baja California Sur . The position of the Puerto Chale Fishing
Cooperative on the Don Diego marine mining project proposed by Oceanic Explorations
de S de RL de CV remains negative despite the change in leadership.


Upon assuming the leadership, Florencio Aguilar decided to issue a warning of the
damage that the dredging of the seabed could cause to the dynamics of the marine
populations.


The fisheries engineer, Bareño Tomás Camacho, manager of the technical department of
the fisheries body, presented a series of slides that showed a direct influence of the
mining concession on the fishing concession, and the fishing area.

"The place that this project will impact the most is our concession area and the fishing
spots, just consider the plume of sediment dispersion and the noise," he said.


Oceanic Explorations S de RL de CV submitted the Environmental Impact Statement to
the General Directorate of Environmental Impact and Risk of Semarnat (Secretariat of
Environment and Natural Resources) on September 3, 2014, but the environmental
authority decided to publicize the start of the process in the Ecological Gazette on
September 17, 2014.


The company insists that the coordinates of the five marine sites are not located in
established fishing areas, contradicting the Comondú fisheries sector.

To demonstrate its position, the fishing association made   a comparison between the strip
of dispersed sediment cloud (part of the Gragado system) in the north and south of Bahia
de Ulloa. He concluded that the level of suspended solids rises to 10 micrograms per litre
in some parts.


The increase in sound waves can cause a prolific effect to the conduct of the Grey Whale,
the cooperative found that there are perimeters in which up to 120 Hertz are generated. In
other portions, these can reach up to 140 Hertz of noise, generated by the dredging
machine of the huge ship.

For all of their concerns, the Puerto Chale Fishing Cooperative decided to start the
process of public consultation, so the public could learn about the objectives of the
company.


"The project is located in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Mexico in the Bay of Ulloa on
the west coast of Baja California Sur, between Abreojos and Cabo San Lazaro, to give it
points of reference on land, with its nearest point a distance of 12 nautical miles (22.224
meters) from the coast" according to the Environmental Impact Statement for the Don

What's most notable is that the EIA was filed a month ago yet we haven't heard from any of the important
environmental NGOs who might oppose the project. Why is this? Perhaps because dredging is one of the more
environmentally friendly forms of mining known. Perhaps it's that the science behind the application is strong.
Perhaps it is because true environmentalists weigh the massive benefits of this new fertilizer source to Mexican
society against the project and understand that the environmental costs are quite manageable. Some will definitely
oppose the project as this is their reason for being, but the silence thus far is telling.


As for the Mayor of Comondu, he can voice opposition but Oceanica isn't even close to his jurisdiction. Oceanica is
not only outside of Comondu, but is outside Mexican territorial waters. It's 25 miles off the coast in Mexico's EEZ. The
Mayor wants to extract payment.


And as for the fishermen, first of all many do not oppose the project. This article refers to a particular cooperative and
there are a number of others. Second, to put this in perspective, the fishing industry in this region is very small,
generating around $25mn in annual sales. Oceanica could generate somewhere between 300-700mn in sales
annually depending on the investment put into the project. Third, the operation doesn't overlap with the fishing
concessions, and the plume will not impact fishing as proven with scientific data and historical dredging operations.


Why is it that almost all of Meson's "independent" sources of information in Baja come from one blog, the BCS
Noticias? Aren't any other more prominent sources writing about this controversy? Is there really a controversy? And
is the BCS Noticias really an "independent" source as Meson portrays, or does Meson work with this "independent"
source to generate negative articles. These are some of the questions readers might be asking themselves.

My family has a substantial investment in OMEX at a loss. The price and demand for potash is down and OMEX has
no experience in sea mining, processing, sales and distribution. There is no margin for error and no business plan is
available for review at this time for us to review the viability of this venture. I am concerned. 
Premarket OMEX is 93 cents a share.

Woody, given the opportunity I'm virtually certain Odyssey will sell their rights. Environmental (and other)
approvals would create the very high chances of that occurring. It if happens, that'll be Mako on steroids.

The picture of the ship blasting sand is not an OMEX ship (or did they purchase it). It is a one of a kind sand dredging
ship used to build up shoreline or create dry areas for construction. This ship was reviewed on a cable channel. Why
is this picture in your article, it is deceptive.

I truly admire Meson's never give up attitude. Make's you wonder WIFM (what's in it for them). But that aside. Their
headline could be applied to absolutely every bridge over water, and every channel, and canal digging project ever
undertaken. 
But rarely is an environmentally safe boon to millions derailed, because a couple of fisherman are scared they will be
temporarily inconvenienced.

Comments regarding money is an easy claim to make and yet just as easy to deny. Just happens that I remembered
the lead-in summary on the petition site where Meson Capital had drawn attention to one signature (one of 600) of the
Puerto Chale top guy. See what the lead summary to the petition said: 
"Fishing, whale watching, tourism, and surfing are all sustainable local means of surviving for future generations while
this offshore phosphate projects offer what seems to be zero benefit to the community! Oceanica claims to have spent
$10m so far and theoretically built the project into a $250m+ business yet we see no evidence the local community
has seen a dime." 
I suspect they've cleaned up their PR since then?


A wrinkle in this is that the Comundu - Puerto Chale - fishing activity is centered in Magdalena Bay where shrimp and
other higher value catch takes place. The coastal fishing pangistas (north of Magdalena) are not part of that crowd,
yet are the most proximate to the mining site, their activity being concentrated kilometers to the east, hugging the
coastal depths which are more productive. These same guys are the ones responsible for the dramatic turtle bi-catch
which has drawn global condemnation of NGOs. Odd bedfellows indeed, which may be part of the deafening silence
we hear. 
Still, there are very VALID ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS that deserve transparent oversight by qualified
oceanographic experts for years to come. You can be sure that the fisheries will blame every dead turtle or fish that
comes in on the tide on mining activity. Serious science by the NGOs (domestic and international) needs to be
encouraged just as does the pecuniary interest of the real fishing communities as part of a community license which

demands they don't ignore their impact on the endangered turtle population. 
"Can't we just all get along"?


Note that almost no other media source in Mexico has covered this story except BCS Noticias which you find acts as
a voice peace for Puerto Chale. But they did correctly report the official filing of the MIA on Sept 4th which was
incorrectly reported as leaked in a Sept 8th Meson Capital article and they also corrected their incorrect story of
missing drilling permits that were not ever required by Mexican law. So BCS Noticias is a source that does get it right
and to report on opposition is likely also correct this time.

Author’s reply »  You have the NGO issue totally backwards. 
NGO's attempt to influence government policies and work up the chain to cause change. 
In this case the government (local at least for now) is ALREADY formally opposed to it. Wouldn't a local
government have at least as much sway to the higher levels of government vs an NGO??

"You have the NGO issue totally backwards." 
I think you are confusing how NGO's generically function, and this specific MIA process with SEMARNAT and
the public consultation process. The Mexican process is pretty straightforward and very professional. Anyone
with an axe to grind can request a public hearing, which is the next step according to the official SEMARNAT
website, which can be accessed with the below link:


http://bit.ly/1rjH1Kz 
(the case number one needs to enter is: 03BS2014M0007)


Any NGO, Mexican or otherwise, will have to have spoken up already-or very very shortly- as the process is
moving right along. As some of the other commentators have pointed out, that part of the process has been
quiet. 
Your source, BCS Noticias which is a local BLOG that is clearly against this project, would have been printing
reports NON STOP if there were any major NGO's protesting the Oceanica project, don't you think? All they
have now is a few fishing cooperatives that have a problem with it and, as everyone's concerns should indeed
be heard, I really don't think this project (so far) has seen any major unrest, if you will.


In October 2013, Minera Frisco, a mining company controlled by Carlos Slim, was granted environmental
approval to search for gold (http://onforb.es/1rjH49b) 
This project had HUGE opposition, and it was for gold, a resource that has no real significance for Mexico,
unlike phosphates and fertilizers. The NGO's were not quiet about this and they didn't "work up the chain to
cause change." They were openly and vehemently opposed to this project before, during and after the public
consultation.  
I am not saying that there will not be any NGO opposition to the project; the fact that we haven't heard
anything major yet, does not mean the NGO's are working quietly behind the scenes: this is the time for them

Rory,


Keep up the good work. It's good to know we have a knowledgeable commentor who knows and understands the
nuances of the landscape surrounding the political processes in Mexico, regarding this project.


As for the article, I think it is very important to note that any project in any town, any city, in any country around the
world requires a vetting and approval process. Simply because some groups might object to a particular project does
not mean that the project will be denied. It's all part of an open, transparent governmental process surrounding the
complete dissemination of correct and unbiased information, so that everyone understands the issues. That is why
Odyssey submitted a 4600 page report to honestly and transparently provide as much information as possible for
consideration by all parties in the process. Those processes always bring out both objectors and supporters. To
simply point out that there are objectors to a proposed project means that the governmental review and approval
processes are working correctly so that objectors concerns can be considered and weighed as part of the approval
process.


At the heart of it, this article seems to infer that because there are (or may be) objections by some groups of people,
that the project is doomed and will be denied approval by the Mexican government. If we were to believe this, then no
application for any project, anywhere, large or small, would ever be approved because objectors would rule. That's
not how it works.


Readers of this article should understand that the review and approval processes in place are not adversarial. They
are now skewed to supporters or objectors. They are in place to ensure that everyone understands the benefits and
impacts of a particular project, and if necessary, to require modifications to projects prior to approval so that the
project adheres to applicable laws and issues which may have an impact on quality of life, security, personal liberties,
the environment and other applicable items deemed to be legitamite concerns. Those items are identified and
resolved as part of these review and approval processes, and hence, the great majority of mid sized to large projects
worldwide, regardless of their nature, ultimately gain authoritative approval at the governmental levels required. And
the Oceanica project will be afforded the same due diligence of Mexican approval process law. All objections cited will
be vetted and all benefits from supporters will also be considered and weighed. Ultimately, this article does nothing
informationally except to point out that there is a Mexican governmental approval process for projects to proceed in
Mexico, and that those processes are working exactly as they are supposed to. We all understand that, and thank you
for reminding us.

Woodmeister, obviously OMEX doesn't have any experience mining, processing, or distributing. Just like you don't do
your own dental work, you hire someone to do that. Just as OMEX has partnered with industry experts such as
Boskalis. You didn't really think Stemm and Gordon were going out there with a bucket and a rope did you?

Hello Shortretort 
Apple does not build nuclear reactors either but they have $130 billion dollars in the bank which provides lots
of room for error. A company this fragile financially has exploded their risk with a mining venture with no
experience or cash. I may lose $200,000 on this stock and I hope they are successful.

when better technology was available to see if they could find the remaining 75K of specie. Testing of new 2014 high
tech technology on this site which they retain all ownership rights to is a perfect use of their time and assets, and
could yield an unexpected catalyst very soon. It also may have been what some of the positive comments that Greg

And how do you support that statement? You know, of course, that the project has support at the highest
levels of the federal government. It is no secret that President Nieto and the PRI party have made increased
domestic fertilizer production an important piece of the national platform. Why do you think that President
Nieto will be defeated in his efforts? What is your factual evidence to support that?


Is it similar to the factual evidence you had to support your statement that OMEX was insolvent a month ago?
Is it similar to the factual evidence you gave that OMEX would be bankrupt imminently on at least ten different
occasions? Is it similar to the evidence you had that the Central America had been re-salvaged since
Thompson and that it would have almost no gold left on board? Or what about your contention that OMEX's
auditor is being investigated? Or that OMEX's ceo said the firm would run out of money? Or that OMEX didn't
have required permitting from semarnat to do the core drilling work?

Okay….thanks… In all fairness, to say the project has 0% chance, you must be 100% certain. How is that
possible? I appreciate your conviction, but how do you back up your conviction? What is it about the project
that makes it 100% nonviable? From what i understand about this approval process (and that is very little),
during the public consultation segment -which should be soon- we should get a much better gauge of its
chances. At this point, things are still pretty opaque with the process. If we don't see significant opposition to
the project, you need to seriously adjust your odds. Thanks of your response, but pitching a 100% certainty
for anything is suspicious, sorry to say.

So Mexico has never approved a mining project and just kills every one of them with a slow death? 
As I stated earlier, we need to revisit the odds during or right after the public consultation process. Stating
100% certainty at this point, like Green River below has stated, is just misplaced.

"I am confident there is zero chance this project is approved in 2 months when the 60 business days are up"


We know you are confident. The issue is that your confidence is not justified by your analysis, and this has been
demonstrated repeatedly in the past. You were 100% confident when you stated "The Environmental permitting stage
stops nearly all mining projects in Mexico?" Yet, Mexico is one of the most friendly mining jurisdictions in the world, is
the number one producer of silver, and a top ten producer of gold and a number of other minerals.


This time is no exception - your confidence is misplaced once again. A quick check of a few random issues of the
SEMARNAT gazette shows that a large proportion of projects are approved in 60 business days. This includes mining
projects. Some mining projects do take 6 months, but many do not. Check out mining project 26SO2013MD124 for
instance, or 10DU2013MD061, or 11GU2013MD037 - all approved in 3-4 months.


Undersea phosphate mining environmental applications have never been denied anywhere in the world, ever.
Namibia did put a moratorium on mining phosphates while it studied the environmental impact, but appears to be
doing a u-turn on that decision. http://bit.ly/1kuTGJw .


Undersea phosphate mining uses a proven, low environmental impact technology, that has been used for over 30
years in European waters. The process has even shown to be beneficial to sealife. Seabed phosphate mining has an
environmental impact, but that impact is small relative to land-based operations, and relative to the large benefits to
society.

Yes, I read that part in the summary. That refers to areas outside of the dredge site. It says nothing about
what happens inside the dredge site (which could be way more destructive than whatever positive benefit is
evidenced outside). So...basically you're not correct. Thanks anyway.


21 Oct 2014, 01:26 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
Blue Ridge, you need to do more homework on marine aggregate dredging. There's a zone of direct impact
which is the area that is dredged. There is also a much larger area impacted by tailings and sediment plume
in an indirect impact zone. The fact that the increased biomass occurs in the indirect zone is a distinctly
positive benefit attributed to dredging. Many organisms in the direct zone are killed, but there is evidence of
positive impact on sea life outside the direct zone.


Incidentally, an environmental scientist has speculated that removing phosphate from the sediment while
adding topographical variation may have a beneficial impact on the direct area as well. As you know, this site
is said to be very inhospitable to benthic fauna right now. This may be due to the high concentration of
phosphate rock. Getting rid of some of that phosphate while adding more variability to the floor could be a
very good thing for sea life.


The MIA is backed with a tremendous amount of historical data and modeling that shows this and more. I'm
looking forward to hearing the SEMARNAT decision.


21 Oct 2014, 01:54 PM


Papaoomowmow
"It says nothing about what happens inside the dredge site "


That is not true.


Without any more spoon feeding, in general their tresting showed specific dredge sites initially lose a
substantial amount of both biodiversity and life in general. In 3 to 6 months they recolonize to 66% of diversity
and 80% of life. In the meantime surrounding areas pick up 4 times the life and diversity.


You do the arithmetic.

Green River Asset, Contributor
So you're going to propose a Greenpeace article that is completely based on hypotheticals to contradict a
fact-based, scientific paper that relies on empirical data from real, live seabed dredging experience?


Over $50mn has been spent researching the impact of marine aggregate mining in the UK over the last thirty
years. This work has guided the way the industry is run in the UK today, and it has likely played a role in
guiding the Oceanica environmental filing. All those facts point to a reality that seabed dredging can be
accomplished with minimal environmental impact. We also know that the societal benefits of this project are
enormous. I thought Meson was all about fact-based research?


Speaking of Greenpeace, you may find this article on "holding Greenpeace accountable" interesting
http://bit.ly/1tJEVLT. The author argues that Greenpeace is guilty of crimes against humanity when it
terrorizes developing nations into following the arbitrary standards it sets for wealthy, green industrialized
nations. Greenpeace focuses exclusively on citing problems with developments and does not pay attention to
projects' societal benefits (which is probably why the organization has become marginalized). This biased,
one-sided perspective leads to many poor decisions with very real consequences. The author believes
Greenpeace is responsible for malnutrition, death, and disease on a fairly large scale.

I actually liked receiving the Greenpeace link since, although carrying its bias as suggested by Green River,
has a decent compilation of a a wide range of theoretical concerns, involving anything from shore line
diamonds to deep ocean cobalt crust and everything in between. These need to be considered in light of the
specifics of the Don Diego mining environment and methods proposed. This fruit salad which Greenpeace
offers is however less useful in consideration of a specific apple such as Don Diego. However, the
Greenpeace report does offer some useful insights on mining techniques, such as the following observation
on dredging discharges: 
"Discharges into surface waters from some types of operations could lead to algal blooms, turbidity clouds
and impacts on commercial fish species (Namibian Marine Phosphates, 2012). The release height of
dewatering discharge may help to mitigate to some degree the impact of sediment plumes in the water
column (Agarwal et al., 2012). If released close to the seabed, models suggest that the plumes should be
confined to deep water and not move into the upper water column due to differences in water density (Bashir
et al., 2012)." The MIA filed by Oceanica suggests that a deep water discharge system will be used, which is
not surprising given Boskalis involvement and their understanding of best practices. By contrast, a recent
short sponsored report showing a photo of a surface sand beach replenishment discharge system is highly
deceptive when Don Diego is being discussed. Apples need to be compared to apples, not pineapples!

Green River, Tincap, Rory, Bulldog and others have all made great points on the Mexican federal processes regarding
the Oceanica project. Rick at Meson has also made some points. But, I know government, government contracting
and governmental approval processes very well, both here in the United States and abroad, and I will tell you
this........


The only thing that matters in the approval process by the Mexican Government for the Oceanica project is
POLITICAL WILL. It does not matter who likes the project, It does not matter who is opposed to the project. We saw
this happen in the United States with Obamacare. Everyone hates Obamacare. No one wanted it to become law, It
was shoved down our throats through political will.


Nieto's platform is increased national fertilizer production. Same as Obama's platform was healthcare reform. There is
the political will. It is the only ingredient necessary for the Oceanica project to be approved. It doesn't matter who
doesn't like. Nieto's answer will be the same as Obama's......"Tough, we're getting it whether you like it or not".


We can debate the why's, why nots, and heretofores until the cows come home. I agree it may take a little longer that
60 business days, but in the end, the outcome will be the same........"Stamped Approved".

You are incorrect. As shown by the latest article.


La Paz, Baja California Sur (BCS). Regarding the support that was given to the mining project submarine
"Don Diego" the leader of the Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives, Alejandro Martínez Tirado , who is also
councilor for the Green Party in the City Council La Paz - he said not endorsed and called him a "speculation"
nonsense; this, after be known today that the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat)
determined to deny authorization to Odysse Marine Exploration for the project aimed at the extraction of
marine phosphate in the Gulf of Ulloa , in the waters of Comondu.


"We have not endorsed any mining project and it should be clear, speculation about it , no sense, our only
interest is and will be everything that has to do with is social aspect of the fishing industry , " he said for
Political Radar ,  
medium which reported that Alejandro Tirado "stated clearly that the assumptions that are found in media and
social networks around the issue of his alleged support for the mining project " Don Diego " is far from reality,  
because as representative of a important for the economic life of the entity sector as is the fishing, should be
and is respectful of the institutions and the decisions taken thereon by federal authorities serving under laws
all you have to do with the underwater mining project on our shores. "

Not that it matters right now, but the official letters the fishing coops in La Paz and Comondu sent to
SEMARNAT are on their Facebook page. Whatever nonsense is above doesn't jive with the official letter they
sent (that is in print for everyone to see). You won't see it online BCS Noticias, however.
