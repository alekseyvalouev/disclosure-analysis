A Very Detailed Look At Organovo

Investment Overview


Shares of Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) have recently skyrocketed due to
widespread media coverage and an equally widespread misunderstanding of the
company's near term revenue potential. The stock has risen from $2.00 to over $13.00 in
the past 12 months and is now valued at over $1 billion. To date Organovo has generated
no real commercial revenues, but has brought in small amounts of money from grants and
collaborations. The company hopes to launch its first commercial product, a 3D liver
assay, in December of 2014, 13 months from now. A launch of any possible next products
has not been announced or discussed, but would likely take several more years for any
visibility. So for now, this one product is all that there is to hope for for the next few years.


In July, Organovo conducted an equity offering at $4.50 per share. As a result, the
company now has a cash balance of approx. 58 cents per share. Aside from the recently
raised cash balance, the sum total of all of Organovo's other assets is just $1 million.


On October 22nd, Organovo Holdings announced that it had presented data
demonstrating retention of key liver functions in bio printed tissues for up to 40 days. In
response to this, the share price rose modestly from around $6.50 to as high as $7.50
before retreating back below $7.00 once again. The news was out and the stock remained
flat for around two weeks. This is clearly not what caused the stock to soar recently.


Starting on November 6th, about two weeks after the announcement, the stock began to
take off. Most of this was due to a rapid fire series of bullish articles on the Motley Fool
and Seeking Alpha which often came out on nearly every other trading day since the
announcement. Many authors and investors have suggested that Organovo may be on
the verge of a massive revenue opportunity of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars
in the near term.


During this brief time, the share price has nearly doubled, hitting a new lifetime high of
$13.65. The company has nearly 90 million shares fully diluted such that it has now
exceeded $1 billion in market cap. It should be noted that there has been no other news
whatsoever from the company, only from bullish authors. Readers should also make note

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 2/106


of the tremendous surge in volume which has occurred on no substantial news. The point
here is that this spike was not driven in any way by the only significant
announcement made by Organovo back in October.


Authors who suggest that Organovo is set to begin pulling in tens or hundreds of millions
of dollars from sales of liver toxicology assays starting in December 2014 clearly do not
understand this product or the market for it.


By now it is well known that drug companies risk losing billions of dollars when one of their
drugs enters and then fails clinical trials. Liver toxicity is one of the most common reasons
for a drug to fail. As a result, many of these authors have simply created a leap of logic
that if the drug companies stand to lose billions, then Organovo must stand to make a
fortune by introducing another diagnostic test for them. This isn't how it works at all.


It is clearly the case that much of the overwhelmingly retail shareholder base simply does
not understand the market for 3D liver toxicology assays. What they clearly don't realize is
that there are already competing 3D liver assays on the market right now, and sold in the
US, which sell for as little as $1,750 per 96 well tray. Yes, these are 3D bio printed liver
toxicology assays, which serve the same function as what Organovo hopes to offer. But
Organovo won't even begin for at least another 13 months from now. Retail investors are
not aware of competing 3D bio printing companies because many of these companies are
not public companies and/or are not US companies. Multiple examples of competing
companies in the 3D bio printing space are shown below. Yet because they are not public
they have not enjoyed almost daily bullish articles from places such as the Motley Fool.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 3/106


It is clearly shown below that Organovo's total revenue potential from 3D liver assays for
Organovo amounts to just $3-5 million cumulatively from 2014 through all of 2016. This is
because the total market size for 3D liver assays is limited to a few thousand units at
most. By 2020, other product offerings (such as kidney assays) may eventually emerge,
but so far there is still nothing definitive from the company at all. It should be kept in mind
that Organovo has possessed its current technology since 2009, and developing this first
product has taken 5 years. So investors should understand that the wait time until we see
second product may also be a few more years.


Some of the confusion likely stems from the Organovo presentation which cites a $500
million market opportunity for cell assay products by 2018. The data came from "Scientia
Advisors". Investors need to understand two things. First, this market opportunity applies
to an extremely wide variety of assays to be used across the market for a wide variety of
uses. It will also be served by many competitors, not just by Organovo. Right now
Organovo has in development just a single assay product to fit into this entire market,
such that the size of the overall market has very little to do with Organovo's financials over
the next 5 years. Second, investors should be aware that the Scientia data was part of a
"sponsored" study in which Organovo hired and paid the firm to produce these estimates


It should also be kept in mind that any revenue in the near term assumes that Organovo is
successful in developing the product and that it is launched on time in December of 2014.
Investors still bear the risk that the product either doesn't work as well as planned or is
delayed beyond December 2014. For now, we can give Organovo the benefit of the doubt
and assume the best for this project. But investors must absolutely realize that the very
best case, assuming success, is for a just few million in revenues (NOT a few hundred
million). This will be clearly demonstrated below.


Just two weeks ago, prior to a surge in high publicity articles, the stock was sitting flat
below $7.00. As the share price has risen due to over a dozen recent articles,
management has been selling hundreds of thousands of shares in October and November
and has filed a massive S8 registration statement by which they can now issue to
themselves over 11 million new shares. This represents nearly 13% of the company in
new shares, and would be valued at over $130 million, just for the personal benefit of a
small group of insiders. (Editors' note: The company has stated that 5 million shares were
registered in the latest S8, which brought the total shares under the 2012 plan to 11.6
million.)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 4/106


As should likely be expected, these insider sales and the large S8 equity registration
statement escaped the attention of many investors because they have been consistently
filed by Organovo management with the SEC on Fridays, and notably after the market
was closed. As anyone would expect from this, most investors were quite obviously not
even looking at their screen on a Friday at 5 pm. The most recent set of management
stock sales came again last week. The SEC filings were released again on Friday. And
again it was well after market hours when no one was looking. Links to these filings have
been included.


As investors come to realize that Organovo currently has only a few million dollars in
cumulative revenue potential over the next 3-5 years, it becomes very difficult to justify the
lofty $1 billion valuation. These realistic revenue numbers are a dramatic variance from
investors' mistaken expectations of hundreds of millions of dollars. The biggest near term
catalyst for a sharp decline is the ongoing insider sales the huge equity registration by
management and the sudden realization that revenue potential is minimal.


Investors should therefore expect the share price to quickly return to below $7.00,
where it was prior to over a dozen promotional articles on Organovo released in the
past few weeks. As recently as November 5th, Organovo had traded as low as
$6.61.


Important Note: The market data with respect to pricing and volumes of 3D liver assays
should be seen as highly verifiable. This is how investors should estimate future revenue
prospects. Links are included so that they can be verified by anyone. For investors who
wish to conduct their own checks, I strongly encourage them to ask Organovo
management directly about expected prices and volumes. Management can be reached at
IR@organovo.com. Alternatively, investors can ask other 3rd party sources such as Zacks
analyst Jason Napodano who has covered the stock or companies such as Insphero
(shown below) which already sell 3D bio printed liver assays. These sources will yield
estimates that should all be very much in line with the ones I present below.


Background Information


Organovo is a stock which lends itself to significant misunderstandings by the market. It
also lends itself to over promotion and manipulation. Despite all of the mainstream
enthusiasm for 3D printing and bio printing, Organovo has just 7% institutional holdings -
93% of the stock is held in retail hands. Stocks such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) are
held in the majority by institutions.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 5/106


Organovo has just one analyst who has covered it, Jason Napodano from Zacks.
However, Mr. Napodano has recently dropped coverage of Organovo due to the valuation.
On the Twitter page for TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein, a series of tweets and retweets
between Feuerstein and Napodano now suggests that "At this price, I think $ONVO could
be as much as 500% over-valued."


When a stock is only owned by retail investors and there is limited research coverage, it is
very easy for the stock price to be heavily influenced by articles in the media. This is
especially true when the articles come in rapid succession almost every day. Of course,
investors need to be aware that many of these very bullish articles come from those who
happen to own the stock and would like to see it go up.


In arriving at my revenue projections, I conducted simple market analysis and identified
competing 3D liver assays which are already being sold on the market. The price for these
3D liver assays is readily obtainable. It is also easy to estimate the number of units that
might be sold in a year. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are around 500 new drugs
which enter phase 1 testing each year. Organovo might hope to gain a significant share of
these. They might also hope to gain a share of roughly 1,000-2,000 other compounds that
could be tested each year. Each 3D liver assay tray contains 96 wells which can be used
to conduct independent tests. As a result, for any given drug, a single tray should be more
than ample. Based on this, if Organovo was extremely successful and immediately
captured significant market share, it might end up selling as many as 1,000 total units of
these 3D liver assays in a year. As a result, we come up with a number of roughly $2
million per year in revenue to Organovo. But this is beginning in 2015 after the product is
launched in December of 2014. For the year 2014, investors should remember that
product revenue should be close to zero.


That is a very simple method of market analysis that helps us approximate total revenues
for Organovo. It is not going to be precise down to the dollar, but it shows clearly shows
the following:


There is precisely zero chance of Organovo reaping hundreds (or even tens) of
millions of dollars in revenues over the next 3-5 years. Organovo management
certainly can have no such expectations. Only the retail investors do as a result of a
recent string of bullish articles. Even if an investor wants to arbitrarily double all of
the assumptions above, it does not even come to $10 million cumulative revenues
for the next 3 years total. Beyond 3 years, we have been given no indication when
additional products will be launched.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 6/106


In arriving at my unit calculations, I first used clinicaltrials.org. I then cross checked my
numbers with those which had been prepared by Zacks, who had consulted directly with
Organovo management when making their revenue estimates. As a final check, I spoke
directly with Swiss company Insphero which already sells these 3D bio printed liver
assays for drug toxicology. The results are all quite consistent at a maximum of a few
thousand units per year for the total market size. Insphero is the company that sells these
3D bio printed liver toxicology assays for $1,750. More details are included below.


The market for 3D liver assays is simply not a large one, the prices are not very high, and
there are already other competitive products actively selling in the market. Those who
have projected hundreds of millions in sales have simply failed to look at the market for
this product. Instead they simply (and falsely) assume that any product being sold to big
pharma must automatically generate hundreds of millions of dollars.


It should come as no coincidence that my estimates above are very closely in line with the
estimates of Zacks' research in their detailed initiation report on the company. On Page 16
of the report Zacks shows clearly that the company is expected to generate revenues of
$0.5 million in 2014 and then $2.0 million in 2015, going to as high as $4 million for all of
2016. Zacks used a different method than I did in arriving at these estimates: they
interacted directly with management in putting revenue estimates together.


I contacted Zacks analyst Jason Napodano a few days ago to see if these revenue
estimates were still valid or if anything had changed. He noted that his revenue estimates
are still valid for upcoming years. Nothing has changed. Mr. Napodano has written on
Organovo on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS and has been consistently positive on the
company and on their technology and prospects. But because he has a much clearer
picture of the realistic revenue potential over the next 3-5 years, he last maintained a
$5.00 share price target for the share price. His last coverage was updated just 12 weeks
ago.


But now we can see from the Zacks' website that the company is no longer providing
updates on Organovo. When I wrote to Mr. Napodano about this, he stated "I dropped
coverage given the exorbitantly high valuation. Can no longer recommend people own it."


A price between $5.00 and $7.00 is certainly where Organovo should be expected to trade
in the near term. This is where it was just 2-3 weeks ago. This is well below the current
levels and certainly below the lofty levels expected by those who have inaccurately
suggested hundreds of millions in revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 7/106


We can contrast the market research approach to numerous other articles which have
appeared in the press in recent weeks. On Friday, one Seeking Alpha author applied
simple random guesswork in trying to calculate revenue potential stating:


We don't how long it will take ONVO to reach $100 mill. to $200 mill. revenue, that
might better support current prices, as there is not enough guidance from the
company to make those projections. But a reasonable guess of going from $0 to
$100 or $200 would be at least three years, which would put is in the FY 2017-18
timeframe as being the earliest when we would expect annual revenues to reach
that level.


In fact, there are actually plenty of data points to help quantify just how much revenue
Organovo can expect from its only product (3D liver assays) over the next 3-5 years.


This author demonstrated no research into the market and simply stated that by 2018
Organovo might be raking in as much as $200 million. This is a staggering amount of
revenue and is in no way supported by anything that Organovo currently has in the works
or has even envisioned in the near future.


(Perhaps by coincidence, when this article was released trading 3 days ago, CEO Keith
Murphy filed to note that he had just sold another 100,000 shares. His filing to notify
investors came after the close of the market on a Friday, so many investors might be
expected to have missed this.)


Similar revenue projections in multiple other articles are the sole reason why the share
price has doubled in the space of two weeks to its current billion dollar valuation. They
have truly lit a fire under retail investors which then sparked momentum traders to pile in.
But these types of projections for the next 3-5 years are entirely without foundation. They
are wrong. When the momentum traders take the reverse direction on the stock, a
significant correction should be expected. Momentum traders by definition do not even
care what a company does. They only care about the near term direction of the stock.
Momentum traders tend to pile in in force and amplify movements to the upside as well as
to the downside. Yet they are "direction agnostic" and are just as happy to profit from a
stock on the way down.


Over a ten year time frame, Organovo can be expected to attempt to develop other
revenue streams such as assays based on other organs like the kidney. But these are
years away and we do not have any visibility on when they might be launched. Organovo
has possessed its current technology since 2009 and the first commercial product, the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 8/106


liver assay, will not be launched until 5 years after that time. In the more distant future, the
real excitement for the company is the potential to develop fully functioning replacement
organs for transplants. But this is even further away and has no impact on the current
share price.


At present, the reality for all investors is that Organovo is only capable of
producing liver tissues that are just 1 millimeter thick and which can be sold in
trays for less than $2,000. Even this will not become a reality for another 13 months,
and then only if all goes as planned. The notion that Organovo will reap hundreds
of millions in revenues at any time in the foreseeable future is pure fiction.


There is already significant competition in the 3D bio printing space


Organovo is the only publicly traded company that is solely focused on 3D bio printing.
This has led many investors to believe that it is the only company engaged in this
business at all. This is completely mistaken.


Below I will list a quick 7 notably obvious direct and indirect competitors within the 3D bio
printing space. Like Organovo, these companies are all involved in the printing of cell
matter such as organ tissues using 3D bio printing technology. But readers should note
that beyond these 7, there are many, many more for those who care to search around. As
with Organovo, many of these companies have their roots within some of the world's most
prestigious universities and research institutes. (Organovo's origins came from the
University of Missouri). These various competitors are active in the US, Europe and in
China. Some of them already are commercializing products well ahead of Organovo.


For example Swiss company Insphero sells 3D liver assays for drug toxicology and has
partnered Cyprotex. A spin-off company of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
(ETH) Zurich and the University Zurich, InSphero was founded in 2009 by Dr. Jan
Lichtenberg, Dr. Jens M. Kelm and Dr. Wolfgang Moritz. On the Insphero website, these
are very clearly marked as liver assays for toxicology. These serve the identical purpose
that Organovo hopes to serve 13 months from now. But for Insphero they are already on
the market. The price comes in at just around $1,750 for each 96 well tray. Different tests
can be run independently in each well, such that one tray is sufficient for 96 different
outcomes. This means that one tray should be largely adequate to get test results for a
single drug. Product inquiries for US sales can be direct to sales@insphero.com or via
their US sales number at +1 207 751-4908.


Insphero describes its current operations as shown below. This should look familiar to
Organovo investors, except that Insphero has already been selling its product since 2012.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 9/106


InSphero is a leading supplier of organotypic, biological in vitro 3D microtissues for
highly predictive drug testing. The company, headquartered in Zurich,
Switzerland, currently counts 7 of the top ten global pharmaceutical and
cosmetics companies as customers. InSphero 3D Insight™ Microtissues enable
more biologically relevant in vitro applications in efficacy and toxicology.


I did call Insphero directly and spoke to a sales representative who confirmed that
the market for these 3D liver assays (which have been on the market for over a
year) is only in the thousands of units total. The sales rep noted that in a large spike
before the upcoming holiday season, the company actually shipped nearly 100
units in a week, which was extremely large. I also confirmed that the primary use of
these tests (as with Organovo) is for drug toxicology testing by pharma companies.


Here is a screenshot from their website.


Yet another competitor is the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, run by Dr.
Tony Atala. Their business should sound very familiar to those who follow Organovo. As
noted in livescience.com.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 10/106


Atala's group has pioneered 3D printing methods that aim to build human organs
with layer upon layer of cells. Their bioprinting methods lay down the cell layers
along with artificial scaffolding to keep an organ's structure intact as it takes shape -
a technique that has allowed the group to make tiny, less complex versions of full-
size human organs. "We're printing miniature solid organs: miniature livers,
hearts, lungs and vascular structures (blood vessels)," Atala told LiveScience.


Wake Forest is far enough along in its development of that it has already been selected by
the DoD to lead the following programs, as noted.


The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is leading the $24-million effort
funded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), on
behalf of Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).


And then of course there is New Jersey based Hurel Corp. which develops and
commercializes similar 3D bio printed products. Hurel was a spin out from Schering
Plough (now Merck) labs from 2007. The company is now backed by Sanofi. According to
MedCityNews,


It [Hurel] has raised $9.2 million in a Series A round for its lead product - a
technology that replicates the human liver, using living cells, and referred to as
organ-on-a-chip or human-on-a-chip.


Hopefully this also sounds very familiar to investors in Organovo, because this is in line
with what Organovo hopes to launch in 13 months or so.


Beyond just livers, there are also other 3D bio printing companies focused on different
tissues. Texas based TeVido Bio Devices is focused on developing 3D bio breast tissues
for breast cancer victims. This is similar to the larger and longer term ambitions that
Organovo has for fully useable tissues. They have already stated that they expect that it
will take 7 years and at least $40 million in order to get to the beginning of clinical trials.
Companies such as TeVido and Organovo can therefore expect a long and expensive slog
before they are even able to contemplate the beginning of FDA trials on such products.


But competition for developing 3D tissues and assays is not just limited to Europe and the
US. It has become an explosive business in China. Already the HangZhou University of
Electronic Science and Technology is printing 3D bio printed body parts. Likewise a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 11/106


company called Unique Technology based in QingDao has already supplied its 3D bio
printers to dozens of universities across China.


There is also competition emerging offering to provide 3D bio printers more broadly to
other organizations. Germany based envisontec already commercially sells a 3D bio
plotter which can be viewed here.


For those who wish to look further, there are dozens more institutions and organizations
which are actively involved in 3D bio printing. For those who are interested in seeing many
more, I included a short list of the 3D bio printing partners who work with Insphero as
Appendix II.


The first issue here is that there are numerous other 3D bio printing entities aside
from Organovo and that some of them are clearly further along than Organovo.


But the more important issue is that these dozens of other 3D bio printing entities
do NOT get the benefit of daily hype articles from sources such as the Motley Fool.
This is simply because they are not publicly traded and no one (i.e. motivated
shareholders) benefits in the short term from giving them excessive hype and
sensationalism. It is very important for investors to realize that speculative
companies with tradeable stocks get far more attention than their private
counterparts simply because traders want to profit from stock moves.


Looking more closely at the 3D liver assay product


The low price of the 3D liver toxicology assay should not come as a surprise to anyone
who knows pharma testing. 3D liver assays will not fully replace traditional testing
methods anytime soon. The pharma companies will still conduct first line animal testing,
and will then proceed on 2D liver tissue samples and then conduct the 3D test last.


The concept of a "3D bio printed liver toxicology assay" sounds very exotic (and
presumably expensive) to many retail investors, but in fact it is just another fairly simple
diagnostic test for pharma companies. Many investors might not realize that the thickness
of these "3D" samples is in fact just a mere 1 millimeter. It hardly appears to be "3D" at all,
but it does in fact meet that definition from a technical perspective.


At present the biggest technical challenge is in creating the vascular structures for
delivering blood that is necessary to support thicker structures, so 0.5-1.0 millimeters is
the current limit for thickness of these tissues. We could certainly print thicker samples

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 12/106


with a bio printer. This is physically achievable. But they would quickly die for lack of blood
flow. At less than 1 millimeter the blood circulates by simple diffusion such that vascular
structures are not necessary.


According to Organovo CEO Keith Murphy,


Murphy cautions. "Our ability to make tissue thicker than about one millimeter is
restricted by our ability to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the cells. Today, nobody
can integrate the small vessels and capillaries needed for thicker tissue. Therefore,
we're not making whole organs," he stresses, although doing so may become
possible eventually.


This reality may come as a shock for those who envision Organovo as a company which
prints large and thick human organs using a 3D bio printer. Many are not aware of the 1
millimeter limitation. The reality is that even getting to just one millimeter in thickness has
been a massive challenge and accomplishment.


The real point is that for pharma companies this is just another simple 1 millimeter liver
diagnostic which will hopefully offer additional predictive value prior to determining
whether or not to go into clinical trials. And we can see that the cost of these tests is
around $2,000 or less for a 96 well tray which gives the ability to conduct 96 individual
tests. Interested readers should feel free to verify these numbers with Organovo
management, with companies such as Insphero or with analysts such as Jason Napodano
or other 3rd party sources.


It all comes down to Intellectual Property ("IP")


The reason that there are so many competitors in the US, Europe and China is that there
are still tremendous amounts of IP which are available through hundreds of universities
which have been focused on 3D bio printing for as long as a decade. There are many
ways to achieve similar ends and 3D bio printing is still in its infancy. As a result, patenting
one's own process certainly does not prevent others from obtaining their desired
outcomes through slightly different means.


The technology being used by ONVO was licensed from the University of Missouri in 2009
for just $25,000 along with 1-3% of future revenues, if any. In 2010, the company entered
into further licensing agreements for additional technology for just $5,000 plus
reimbursement of patent costs. In 2011, ONVO entered into similar licensing agreements
with Clemsen University for a total of $32,500 plus an additional $32,500 in patent costs.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 13/106


As of 2013, the value of all of ONVO's non cash assets (i.e. all of its intellectual property)
was valued at less than $900,000. This should not be surprising when one realizes that
the only product currently on the horizon is the drug toxicology liver assay which
commands a low price of less than $2,000 and a small market size of perhaps 1,000 units
per year.


In the meantime, ONVO only spends a mere $1 million per quarter in R&D expenditures.


Significant transformation in the world of technology and biotech is tremendously
expensive. This holds true without exception. For example 3D systems still spends over
$10 million per quarter on R&D even though its technology seems to be at a more mature
state. And in developing an electric car that will actually sell, Tesla Motors
(NASDAQ:TSLA) spends over $50 million per quarter!


By contrast, Organovo spends around $1 million per quarter and its total IP (which it
purchased) is valued at well under $1 million.


The one thing that Organovo has done quite successfully is to raise over $60 million from
investors due to the strong share price. Yet much of the share price strength has resulted
from hyper bullish articles from authors who engaged in pure speculation about bio printed
full organs and other outcomes which are clearly decades in the future. Despite all of the
hype and the soaring share price, the stock continues to be held 93% by retail investors
and has attracted no mainstream Wall Street research coverage. In fact, the heaviest
source of promotion for Organovo is via the presentations at
RetailInvestorConferences.com. This should be seen as highly unusual even for
companies with market caps even as small as $200-300 million, and certainly unusual for
a company which has now surged to over $1 billion.


The point from this is that there is a very clear reason why Organovo has attracted no
institutional or research interest. Organovo bought some very inexpensive IP 5 years ago.
The company spends very little on R&D and its only near term product offering is for a
simple diagnostic which is already on the market from other competitors. Meanwhile,
Organovo has heavily targeted retail investors and has been able to use that hype to raise
around $60 million over two years from stock sales.


What are the insiders doing?


Looking at the insider behavior at Organovo is very interesting.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 14/106


Over the past few weeks (and as the share price was soaring due to articles), CEO Keith
Murphy has sold 200,000 shares of stock, bringing him in nearly $2 million. On each case
his SEC filings were stealthily submitted after the market close and on a Friday, such that
many investors may not have seen this at all.


Chief Strategy Officer David Eric has also sold nearly 100,000 shares.


CTO Sharon Presnell recently sold 75,000 shares, and sold an additional 75,000 shares in
August.


Of greater concern is the fact that on November 8th, Organovo filed a massive S8
registration statement which now covers 11 million shares to be issued to management.
This represents nearly 13% of the company and would be valued at well over $100 million
for this small group of individuals. S8 filings are often sources of concern for investors
because they basically allow management to issue large amounts of stock to themselves
or their "consultants" for any reason. The filings can be done on very short notice. S8
filings were much abused vehicles by Chinese reverse merger companies during the wave
of fraud that hit these companies in 2010-2011. They used these S8s to issue large
amounts of stock to themselves and their cohorts and then quickly sold the stock at highly
inflated prices. S8s were largely how many of the Chinese fraudsters made themselves
rich. This does not mean that all S8s are bad. It just means that it is an easy way for
insiders to award themselves tremendous amounts of stock on very short notice. Investors
should rightfully view large S8s with skepticism.


And by the way, this recent S8 registration statement by Organovo was again stealthily
filed by management on a Friday (Nov 8th), well after the close of the markets such that
most investors did not even see it. The filing of this massive S8 fortuitously coincided with
the recent ramp of the stock following a string of bullish articles.


The point from this is that management can feel free to sell as many of their current
shares as they wish, because they know that they can simply issue themselves another 11
million more.


Going back further, we can see other interesting insider activity.


As of the initial public offering in 2012, company founder Dr. Gabor Forgacs owned 13.9%
of the company. As an owner of more than 10% of the company, he would have been
required to report any sales of his stock.



http://www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.xD9Ae.htm#1stPage

http://www.secinfo.com/d14D5a.p87av.htm
5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 15/106


Also at that time, his son Andras Forgacs held 1.8% of the company and was also a
director. This is below the 10% threshold, but as a director he would still have to report
any share sales.


By December 2012, Dr. Gabor Forgacs had reduced his stake to 12%. But by April of
2013, he had reduced it to 9.7%, beneath the 10% reporting threshold. This was just prior
to the uplisting in 2013, when the stock soared for the first time to over $8.00, up from
around $1.00 a year earlier. And by being below the 10% threshold, Dr. Forgacs would not
have to report that he sold his stock. We can see from SEC filings that Dr. Forgacs has not
provided any information about holding any Organovo stock since 2012. Dr. Forgacs
resigned as a director on February 8, 2012 (see page 84 of this SEC filing), on the day
Real Estate Restoration and Rental, Inc. was officially merged into Organovo holdings,
such that this stock sales also would not be reportable. We therefore cannot tell how many
(if any) shares Dr. Forgacs still holds. But the pattern of his actions appears to have been
conducive to being able to sell when he wanted to without having to report the sales which
would alert investors.


Meanwhile, his son Andras resigned from the company in July 2013, also as the stock had
just hit all time highs at the time. This would also allow him to sell his stock without
reporting it. There are also no subsequent updates indicating that Mr. Andras continues to
hold his original position so we really don't know.


The last filings indicating ownership by the Forgacs were in March of 2012.


But perhaps a bigger question for investors is why did the founder and his son
resign from this company at all? If the future is so bright for Organovo, then
presumably these two founding insiders would want to go along for the ride.


A word on Organovo's collaborations


Like many development stage biotech and healthcare companies, Organovo was able to
secure several collaborations with big pharma names. In 2010, they secured a deal with
Pfizer and by 2012 they had delivered constructs to Pfizer for internal evaluation. No
update has been provided since then as we now approach 2014. In 2011, Organovo
entered into a research agreement with United Therapeutics. The agreement had later
been expanded, but it appears that it still expires several months from now. In January of
2013, Organovo entered into a collaboration agreement with the Knight Cancer Institute at
Oregon Health & Science University ("OHSU"), to develop more clinically predictive in
vitro three dimensional cancer models with the goal to advance discovery of novel cancer

therapeutics. However this is purely academic and does not appear to provide any
revenue to Organovo. Additional recent announcements have been made including
Hoffman LaRoche and L'Oreal but no revenue from these has been disclosed either.


These name brand collaborations have added instant credibility and have occasionally
boosted the share price. But the fact remains that in the past these big names have paid
up to have a look at what Organovo has for them, and then they have moved on after
looking.


This should be readily apparent by looking at the amount of collaboration revenue which
has been steadily dwindling each quarter. As of the most recent quarter, Organovo
brought in just $23,000 in collaboration revenue. By contrast, in 2012 the total for the year
was over $1 million.


Learning from the past - have we seen this before?


At the beginning of 2013, Casey Research published an article describing the then-recent
moves in the stock, which were also spectacular. The description provided by Casey is
now about a year old, but should seem oddly familiar to those who have witnessed the
moves of the past few weeks. Investors should read this carefully, keeping in mind that it
describes the effects of a promotion that happened over a year ago!


From Casey Research:



http://www.caseyresearch.com/cdd/organovo-good-company-or-lesson-hype

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2013/11/18/4238561-1384831120811369-Richard-Pearson_origin.jpg
5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 17/106


ONVO went public at $1.65 per share on February 14, 2012 and experienced some
impressive momentum out of the gate, climbing to $3.01 (an 82% increase) by May
17. That's when things really went crazy. Just one month later [IN JUNE 2012],
ONVO traded as high as $10.90 (a 560% increase from the close on its first trading
day just four months prior) after some of the larger newsletter companies like Motley
Fool wrote numerous positive articles about the company and helped propel it to
a $500-million market cap (despite no change in fundamentals) virtually overnight.


Think about that for a second. ONVO was trading for half a billion dollars despite
generating less than $1 million in revenue during the prior twelve-month period. Yes,
that's a price-to-sales ratio of over 500. And it's not like the forward one- or even
two-year revenue projections were calling for growth that could come close to
justifying that valuation. The numbers just didn't make sense. When investors once
again came to their senses and recognized this reality, the stock fell - hard. By
mid-July 2012, ONVO was once again trading below $2.00 per share. Despite a
brief pop above $3 per share in mid-October, the stock remained flat through mid-
December.


The point from this excerpt is that we have seen the exact same phenomenon again. It is
a series of hyper bullish articles (also coincidently coming primarily from the Motley Fool)
all coming at the same time which sent this stock soaring within 2 weeks and without any
new fundamental developments from the company. Casey makes a good point as well.
Investors shouldn't be looking at the current price to sales ratio, they should be looking at
the 2-3 year forward price to sales ratio. As shown above, revenue for 2015 should not be
much more than $2 million under any circumstances. But now we are at over a $1 billion
market cap such that the forward price to sales ratio is still at least 500 times projected
sales. And even if they grow these sales in 2016, we are still talking about 200-300 times
sales.


Conclusion


There is an old saying that if you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes "the truth". This
does not mean "truth" in the literal sense, instead it just means that the lie becomes
universally accepted.


Lately the headlines have been filled with bullish articles on Organovo which predict
massive near term revenues as a result of providing billion dollar savings to big pharma
companies. Many of these articles have been written by individuals who happen to own
5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 18/106


stock in Organovo and who have certainly derived great benefit from the recent doubling
of the stock in two weeks.


The actual truth is that Organovo hopes to launch a fairly simple 3D liver assay in 13
months from now. It is hoped that this product will offer some incremental benefit above
and beyond animal testing and 2D testing. Existing products are already on the market
and sell for less than $2,000 for a 96 well tray. The total market size for all such liver
assays for all competing suppliers numbers in the mere thousands of units.


As a result, Organovo's revenue potential should be expected to add up to just a few
million dollars over the next few years - certainly NOT hundreds of millions of dollars. And
in fact, NOT even tens of millions.


But the sheer repetition of this misinformation of late has caused Organovo's share price
to double in about 2 weeks, now hitting a $1 billion market cap. The latest surge has been
driven by high volume momentum traders who do not even care what the company does.
These traders are also agnostic about share price direction. They are just as happy to
profit from falling share prices as they are from rising share prices. They can exacerbate
downward moves in the share price just as they have exacerbated the recent upward
moves. As a result, as soon as investors realize the reality of Organovo's actual revenue
potential, the share price should be expected to see dramatic moves lower on very high
volume.


In the meantime, management insiders continue to sell large amounts of stock at current
prices pulling in millions of dollars personally. And now they have registered over 11
million more new shares to give themselves. Organovo as a company will certainly not be
pulling in $100 million in revenue any time soon. The only ones to get this much money
will be Organovo management when they personally award themselves the 11 million
shares of stock under the recently filed S8.


Appendix I - practical considerations for shorting Organovo


Following the dramatic spike in the share price, many investors have lamented to me that
shorting Organovo is often "impossible" due to lack of stock borrow..


A much better alternative is to sell the December call options. When selling options with a
fairly low strike price of $5.00, the performance is basically identical to shorting the stock.
Investors get 1:1 exposure on both the upside and the downside. The only drawback is
that if the share price falls below $5.00, the investor no longer benefits from additional
downside. But the major advantage here is that selling calls does not require the short
5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 19/106


investor to borrow stock, so there is no expensive borrow fee. In reality, selling naked
options like this is often no more risky than shorting common stock. It does require an
additional level of option approval from one's broker, but this is well worth it because this
technique applies to many stocks aside from Organovo.


Another alternative is to buy the "in the money" puts. Many investors shy away from puts
because they are seen as being a very risky "all or none" bet. That certainly applies to "out
of the money" puts. But if the stock price is below $12.50 and the investor buys $12.50
puts, he is already "in the money" and the option will largely perform 1:1 on the way down
just like being short stock. As with selling calls, the short investor does not need to pay the
expensive borrow. However there is typically a moderate premium that must be paid. So if
the stock is at $11.50, the investor might pay $1.50 for the $12.50 put, effectively getting
short at $11.00. Because the stock is at $11.50, the investor has paid a 50 cent premium.
One advantage here vs. being short the stock is that if the share price does rise
dramatically, the investors losses are capped at that $12.50 level. But should the stock fall
back to $8.00, this $1.50 bet pays off $4.50 (a triple). And again, if the stock rises above
$12.50, the investors losses are capped.

look like everyone is doing that today .

3D Investing, Contributor
Your detailed analysis is a lot of words and not a lot of detailed analysis.


Note:


1. Institutional ownership is going up and rapidly.


2. Their liver assay is at least twice the thickness and can be printed with small blood vessels.


3. There is nothing suspicious about the CEO selling his stocks. This has already been debunked. You should also
look up how much the CEO and his staff makes.


4. If you ask any Zack's analyst if his predictions are still correct, then you will always tell you it is. Saying no is like
saying he's bad at his job. As history have shown, Zack's is wrong as often as they are right.


5. You're bringing up other bio companies with inferior products. ONVO can charge more for their products because it
is better. Not only that, they are already expanding their tech to other organs.


6. You don't realize that ONVO selling these assay samples creates a bigger market. It will be practical to test a ton
more products. Most products doesn't get tested before hitting shelves. Only drugs gets strictly tested.


I'm sure other people can write more. There's no point in discussing on so many of your article's flaws.


Here's the one thing that determine price, money supply. Money is being poured into ONVO by institutions. Price will
go up. ONVO has the 3 keywords that everyone wants to hear "3D printing, pharma, tech". Not only that, they proved
their products are successful and shows it can create a new market.

DDD SSYS VJET XONE all are overvalued also


19 Nov 2013, 10:33 AM


3D Investing, Contributor
You are right, especially DDD and XONE. But people are hoping it is a huge industry in the future. All signs
says yes. This only proves that the efficiency of the market quickly eliminates any unexploited profit
opportunity. So in essence, their current price is fair pricing for the possible returns they get vs the risk they
fare.


I think the word overvalued is used too often and can be misleading. Everyone define fair value differently. On
top of that, there is no standard in assessing value. The only real value is the middle ground that sellers and
buyers meet everyday. That's the only one that matters.

So ONVO has products to sell? Is that how it charges more for them? Because they are better? In that case
please confront the author's contention that they do not yet exist.


19 Nov 2013, 10:57 AM


3D Investing, Contributor
"So ONVO has products to sell" 
Yes they do, else they wouldn't be announcing it is for sale in 2014. Do you realize that they have to make
these printers themselves from the ground up? The process to make bio ink is very complicated and take
weeks to make. Between making the machines and establishing procedures for their customers, taking a year
is probably pretty quick. Have you not noticed they have been hiring more researchers and CAD
professionals? Oh that's right, you failed to do research.


"Is that how it charges more for them?"


Yes, since thickness of tissues are very important and they can produce much thicker tissues with blood
vessels, it is obvious they can charge more.


"Because they are better?"


Do some research and stop asking the same question in different forms.


"In that case please confront the author's contention that they do not yet exist. " 
Yes, it is in their labs and also published. It is also peer reviewed. It is as real as it gets. Their only problem is

tudong- to address just one of your points '1. Institutional ownership is going up and rapidly', when you start
from a near zero 2.6% you can get to a diminimus 8% fairly quickly.


Rather than speculate though, here's what we do know- institutions file reports within 45 days of the CLOSE
of a quarter.


http://1.usa.gov/185Yxjg


Nov 15th being the latest filing deadline we did see an uptick in institutional ownership of ONVO from a
microscopic 2.65% to a current still very small 8%. But where are the famous biotech investors such as the
Baker Brothers? All the main institutional holders fall either into the category of unmanaged index funds -
Vanguard for example - or the typical mutual fund that buys a broad sampling of different companies trying to
fit a particular investment strategy (US smallcap equity, etc).


Most of this recent buying was triggered by ONVO being uplisted to AMEX thus requiring Vanguard and a few
funds to rebalance and integrate them into their market matching holdings. They're agnostic about the
company - they just want to match the movement of the overall stock market. As for the mutual funds their
managers allocate a fraction of their investment to 'healthcare' (typically 5 - 8%) and most of that is invested
in major hospital chains and big pharma. Pure biotech would be a small fraction to which these funds bring
precious little expertise. But it's not their job anyway; they're not trying nor expect to beat the market (or
Vanguard!) they just don't want to perform worse (and lose customers and management fees) to their
competitors. It's a reliably low standard since they rarely beat the market.


What you're also not considering is that these stock purchases were made, and absorbed, prior to Sept. 30th.
Therefore we know that they bought well below today's nose-bleed levels and is no endorsement of the
current price. Indeed any fund manager who'd take the sort of risk of paying the current 100% premium to
recent values would know that he'd likely be looking for a new job pretty soon so we can discount the
possibility that funds, not momos (you momentum traders), are driving the current pump, soon to be followed
by dump.


Finally consider that the typical smallcap biotech stock usually sports an institutional backing north of 50%,
not a minor 8% such as ONVO. 
Consider the following smallcap ETF (PSCH). It lists ten holdings-


http://bit.ly/185YzaN


The least of them has 81% institutional ownership with the rest ranging up to 110% (those pesky shorts must
have created excess shares). This is at a minimum TEN TIMES the interest in ONVO.


Anyone long ONVO should at least ask themselves why there's an absolute dearth of interest from the smart
(biotech hedge funds), or even no-so-smart money (mutual fund 'pros')? Why is this stock repeatedly
marketed to the retail crowd who couldn't be expected to calculate the fundamentals in a field as arcane and

speculative as biotech? And why has no major (or minor) pharma stepped up with real money for a piece of
ONVO or even a sizable collaboration? I'm not refering to the 'no-specifics, no-revenue' deals ONVO recently
announced which cost the signing companies nothing but gave ONVO a great publicity point to sell to retail
shareholders.

But you are saying they have a product to sell, but at the end try to cover the fact they don't. Fact is, others
are doing the same thing and there will be competing products by companies that are already known to the
big pharma companies in the space.  
But if I play along with you, what is the income they can expect from sales if they get 100% of the liver assay
market? Or did you not read the whole article to get to that part?

'3. There is nothing suspicious about the CEO selling his stocks. This has already been debunked. You
should also look up how much the CEO and his staff makes.'


Debunked by who? Just stating a claim is not proof. The fact is the insiders are selling a lot of stock and they
are also very compensated. Murphy's base salary alone is over $300,000 a year but the perks, free stock,
and benefits make this package worth millions.

There you again (to quote R. Reagan)-


'5. You're bringing up other bio companies with inferior products. ONVO can charge more for their products
because it is better. Not only that, they are already expanding their tech to other organs.'


Thank you for your in-depth analysis of the market and pricing and relative advantages of different 3D
bioprinting technologies. I guess that settles the argument because you say so. It's a wonder you're wasting
such prodigious talents on an SA comment section. Why aren't you writing articles instead so that you can
grace us with your wondrous perspicacity?


BTW- did you know that they have no 'tech for other organs' at the present, or indeed for years into the
future?

'6. You don't realize that ONVO selling these assay samples creates a bigger market. It will be practical to test
a ton more products. Most products doesn't get tested before hitting shelves. Only drugs gets strictly tested.'


Considering that there are already 3D liver assays being sold this argument doesn't warrant a rebuttal.


What else you got?

This is a throw every negative thing at ONVO article to see what sticks and supports the author's short
position kind of article. Anyone following the stock closely should know these arguments. We've been through
Atala and his group. We know about the supposed insider selling (every dump piece usually cries foul on any
insider sale - no matter the reason). Unfortunately, it worked. No one is saying ONVO will be a 100% success.
The question is whether you are in too early or too late. This is the question of every stock with new tech
waiting to be commercialized.


Look to the partnerships ONVO has. Their partners foot the bill for much of the research. If there are products
currently existing that do what ONVO only dreams of doing, according to the shorter, why are all these
companies and institutions like the Michael J. Fox Foundation, Pfizer, Knight Cancer Institute, etc. coming to
ONVO? Because they didn't do their due diligence? Because this author is the only one that knows about all
these "competitors?"

"Not to mention that the only thing that can create a bigger market is increased demand, not increased

There is already demand. And no, a new market can be created with either demand or supply. It only needs to
have both when the product is in the market.


No one "needs" a smartphone until Apple came out with the iphone. People didn't even know they wanted it
until Apple announced it.


Good thing for ONVO, there's a line of large institutions willing to work with them to make their products
happen.

'Look to the partnerships ONVO has. Their partners foot the bill for much of the research.'


Well considering that ONVO was paid all of $23,000 last quarter, or roughly $8,000 per month, they can't be
doing much research now, can they?


These publicity deals come with no payments. How do we know? Because the few times anyone's put up any
money ONVO makes sure we all hear about it. Plus we can read a 10Q. All these deals accomplish is to give
ONVO insiders another opportunity to sell their stock at jacked-up prices or drop a secondary equity deal on
the retail market to fund their lavish salaries. Meanwhile these other institutions get to look like they're on the
cutting edge of medical technology, which looks good for their own sponsors and supporters, without putting
up any money. Kind of a win-win which is why they get done.


btw- Pfizer did put in $1M (sofa change) three years ago for an advanced look at ONVO's liver assays but
that deal ended a year ago and they were never heard from again. They came, they saw, they went so one
assumes they couldn't have been very impressed.

This must be the first pharma tech company you've followed. Everything single one of them followed the
same trend.


1. Raise funds

It's high risks and high rewards. Apparently, people are willing to take it.

Yes, we all know Pfizer hasn't come back yet. They delivered to Pfizer in the 4th quarter of 2012. So, it's not
like they have been waiting for 3 years. Pfizer has to study what was given and conduct their tests. These
things take time obviously. Unless you have Pfizer saying no thanks, this is still pending. I'm not saying Pfizer
will sign on. I'm not saying they won't. Bottom line, if the author's competing products already do what ONVO
wants to do, why the hell did Pfizer invest in the first place? Why hasn't Pfizer said no thanks to ONVO we
found your competitor!


The amount Pfizer provided doesn't matter. Why would Pfizer pay 100 million for something they can get for
$100,000. They are not stupid.


Oh, and yes, all these "cutting edge" institutions just want to look good for their sponsors and supporters.
They don't care if the tech they invest in can save lives, and prevent diseases. Michael J. Fox doesn't really
care about being cured. He got a new show, so he is set for life with Parkinsons. No worries there.


19 Nov 2013, 02:30 PM


Mukticat
Why would Pfizer need to deliver a 'no-thanks', and what makes you think that if they did ONVO would
necessarily disclose it? If your answer is that they have to disclose all material information then you just made
my point that all their recent hyped announcements have nothing material - ie-revenues - to disclose either.


A year's a sufficient time to wait and so far ONVO's gotten nothing. Meanwhile Pfizer's $7B annual budget for
R&D goes elsewhere.

Yep, bought puts after researching the institutional involvement (little to none), no profits, usual spike on

awesomeimo101
Absolutely right! The recent volume surge was not because of the retail investors. It seems many institutional
investors jumped into this one. Many of these investors have more inside knowledge of what's going on with
the company before investing millions. I would use this as an opportunity to add more.

So no facts to show Pfizer is through with its analysis. No facts to show Pfizer sent a no thank you card. You
guess, Pfizer is finished with its analysis. No facts to say why they invested in ONVO when there are
competitor products that do what ONVO wants to do - at least according to this author.

Also, if you are asking me why ONVO releases positive news for the company that can help the company
make money, I think the answer is obvious. So it can make money. So people know who they are working
with. That's plain and simple. What's the big deal? What company doesn't release positive news?


And I guess you have insider information that says ONVO has released all their good news, right?


You know as much as I on that (meaning, zilch).


19 Nov 2013, 03:50 PM


Mukticat
What are you asking me to prove a negative? I can't say why Pfizer appears to have dropped Organovo but
12 months of silence say they have.


Why would they invest a tiny sum in ONVO when there are competitors making the same product?
Acknowledging that ONVO has competitors and doesn't own this field for themselves is a good start 1 ring
binder. The other answer would be that with an annual budget of $7B dollars Pfizer can afford to throw a little
money around to check out new technologies. That said they're not in the business of wasting money which
would explain why they went no further with ONVO after they saw the results.

tduong: ONVO's liver assay will be ~.5 mm thick (20 cell layers). It has no plans to make it thicker because
there is no enhanced diagnostic value in doing so. Also, the tissue is most certainly not printed with small
blood vessels. Vascularization occurs as the cell layers grow and aggregate. Vascularization is important for
extended shelf life. If ONVO's product can reach ~60 days, this would make it more marketable versus the
Insphero product. Right now, it appears that both products last ~40 days. If so, then it is a competitive
situation.

ONVO currently has no products to sell. The first one will be the Liver Assay which will be launched in late
2014.

SA Editor Douglas W. House, Contributor
tduong: ONVO has no products to sell at present. It's first offering will be the Liver Assay. It is projected to
launch in late 2014. Also, ONVO does not manufacture 3D bioprinters. The NovGen is made by Invetech, a
contract manufacturer.


The thickness of the assay tissues is not directly proportional to its diagnostic utility. The thickness of the Liver
Assay will only be .5 mm. There is no need to make it thicker. Thickness is important for implantable tissues,
i.e. a cardiac patch. No company on earth is remotely close to having such a product ready for clinical trials,
though.

ring: All the collaborations have been modest dollars. The UTHR and PFE were proof-of-concept deals. For
example, PFE's agreement was only $600k. PFE does hundreds of these small deals. It's a venture capital-
type of model. PFE hopes that several of its investments will pay off big but most will not return anything.


19 Nov 2013, 08:57 PM


SA Editor Douglas W. House, Contributor
ring: It does not take much time to assess toxicity data. The details of the PFE collaboration were never
disclosed, but if it focused on this area, then the answers it sought would be available very quickly after the
"incubation" phase. The microwell assay's results are determined by automated plate readers. I doubt if it
takes more than 30 minutes to read a 24-well plate.


If liver toxicity was, indeed, the area of interest then PFE's inaction is disheartening. If the focus area was
something else, then no judgment can be made on the PFE's lack of follow up.

Mukticat - I'm saying we don't know. You are saying Pfizer is out. Since we don't have a yes or no, from either
party, we don't know. What evidence do you have that Pfizer is out? One year is enough time to determine
whether they are in or not you say. How do you know one year is enough time? Maybe Pfizer is waiting to see
what competitors come up with before deciding. Maybe they got backlogged. Maybe they presented terms
and ONVO didn't accept. We don't know. So stop saying you know something that you don't. It ruins your rep
and it's so simple.

Douglas, thanks for chiming in and providing information on so many points.


Regarding the Pfizer situation, I know ONVO said wait 6-12 months on Pfizer. I have no idea when that time
period starts, but that time limit sticks in my head. Maybe there is something more than toxicity at issue based
on that. Maybe the company is just buying time. I don't know.


20 Nov 2013, 11:46 AM


Mukticat
The longs have the right to bally-hoo ONVO's collaborations with other companies - which they do all the time
as a endorsement of their concept - but after a year of these collaborations ending with no further action, no
deals, no news, no partnerships, it's logical to assume that this didn't lead anywhere. It's how an endorsement
becomes a . . . dis-endorsement?


You can postulate all kinds of theories to explain the great silence from Pfizer but eventually it comes back to
the theory known as Occam's Razor; the simplest explanation for an event is generally the most likely.


http://bit.ly/1hXsGoV


For example wouldn't it be plausible to assume that had Pfizer been very pleased with the liver assays they
got a look at they would have said 'here's another million, now bring us kidney cells, or heart cells'?


And by the way, Pfizer is not the only Big Pharma out there; where are the other multi-billion dollar drug
companies? How can they be so blind to the fantabulous 'disruptive' promise of a Novagen bioprinter?


PS- The Methuselah Foundation doesn't count.

It doesn't matter much at the moment. Stock is plummeting and it was easy (as many retail longs here attest,

I thought they would be growing new human livers for transplant by now with all the hype this stock has received. I
guess you take a fad (3D printing) and combine it with a hot sector (Biotech) and you get ONVO.


19 Nov 2013, 10:14 AM


3D Investing, Contributor
if they were growing human livers, then their stock price would instantly jump to $100 per share.


115k people waiting for transplant a year at a minimum 200k a pop is a lot of money. Considering, a tray of
tiny 1 layer thin assay cost nearly $2k. Making an entire organ and selling it for $200k is probably a low price.
If my life was on the line and I have insurance, I'll probably pay way more than that. Cancer patients pay up to
100k per visit depending on treatments. Anything in medical is expensive.


Note: the recent drop is because of the increase of short interest. It went up about .2%. At the same time,
institutional ownership also went up .1%. If institutions keep buying, these shorters may just lose their lunch. I
hope they bought some calls in case it continues to get pumped.

I heard stock lemon say DDD was a Bubble stock dipped to 29 from 44..now its over 80 good luck with your short
sorry for your pain.

Going to 7? You'll be lucky if it stops there. The last time this got seriously pumped and dumped it went

A very long article to short a tiny stock, This tiny stock is a developing company, developing something that could lead
to huge savings on drug development, something that could improve skin beauty, food production etc. The tiny
company could also be a good acquisition target. It's a "diamond mine" waiting to be excavated . The share price of a
developing company with unique product/invention should not be determined only by valuation. Look at the high start
up and present valuation of Amazon and Sales Force. ONVO is a long term investment with immense long term
prospect.

This stock is a classic Pump and Dump. If investors want to pump it higher, go ahead, but I'm not going near ONVO.


I love the 3D Printing sector, but I'd stay away from 1-trick ponies, such as XONE and VJET who specialize in
industrial-sized, mega-printers. These companies are dependent on a small number of large sales, which I don't like.
If one of these companies miss a few printer sales, they're stock price can plummet faster than you have time to get
out.


SSYS and DDD are the companies that will continue to dominate this industry and are safe longterm investments.
They both work on all aspects of 3D printing and I believe that desktop 3D printing is going to be their 'bread and
butter' in the long run. There are millions of small businesses, schools, etc. that can afford a desktop 3D printer and
will buy them as the technology gets better.

Very few companies can afford mega-printers that have price tags in the millions... I feel that one company will
dominate this market and all others will have to go to desktop printing to sell quantity. Also, the XONE and VJET
already selling such few quantity, they will also be competing against the resale market from the ones they're selling
now.


19 Nov 2013, 11:50 AM


Market DJ, Contributor
How is VJET a one trick pony? They make money and are growing fast.  
I would put my money in the industrial segment of the 3-D printing sector, and I would be very skeptical with
consumer based desktop 3-D printers.


19 Nov 2013, 06:20 PM


Trevor Fontaine
VJET isn't making money, they're loaning businesses money to buy their expensive printers... and how is
selling 3 printers/quarter 'growing fast'?


I don't think you really did any research about 3D printing, but considering you wrote that comment on Nov
19th, just before VJET took a cliff dive and pictures of their 'factory' were posted online... I'm assuming you
lost a lot of money right after you wrote this comment


22 Nov 2013, 12:12 PM


Market DJ, Contributor
No i did do research on VJET. They do make money, albeit not as much to justify a 1B dollar cap space. And I
got in at 30 so I made quite a bit of money and got some free shares out of the deal as well.


Thanks for asking.

The author is misleading people: He states: "Starting on November 6th, about two weeks after the announcement, the
stock began to take off. Most of this was due to a rapid fire series of bullish articles on the Motley Fool and Seeking
Alpha which often came out on nearly every other trading day since the announcement."


SA had on 11/2 an article about whether it was time to sell ONVO - this wasn't a flattering piece for the company.
Since then until today, there were only 2 other articles written. TWO. One said WAIT to buy the stock. The other
article was mostly positive.


On the Fool, you have articles nearly every other day about the stock, but they weren't pump pieces. They were
articles like why the stock jumped today; the 5 biggest winners and losers of the week, three companies that soared
today, etc. Simple reports on what happened. Besides that, you have an article about the Body on the chip - a
competing technology (opposite of a pump piece); an article yesterday about "Tread Carefully" (opposite of a pump
piece) and articles about new health care tech, or 3D printing tech in general, which are cautious but I'll count as

If you don't like the stock, just explain why and back it up. Don't give false reasons for why the stock jumped. It hurts

What you don't seem to realize is that the recent SA and Motley Fool articles that purported to caution on
ONVO were in actuality carefully calculated straw men arguments. You know the kind where they start out by
saying 'ONVO has amazing developments, a huge market, a truly revolutionary, disruptive product but it may
have gotten a teensy bit ahead of itself . . . but I'm staying long' variety.


Sure enough they worked. The stock continued to make new highs. Richard's article has actual damning
information in it and sure enough it's working too.

Really. The articles that advised caution were really bull articles on the company. The articles that were about
competing tech were bull articles. Some people might call some of them at the very least, balanced. This
article is sorely lacking balance. However, given the position of the author as a short, it's understandable.

Institutional investors don't buy at "discounts" to previous stock prices. Institutional investors, when not
required to buy for allocation purposes, buy based on discounts of the perceived intrinsic value plus an
additional margin of safety. To think and act with dollars otherwise is speculation at best, akin to gambling.

English: They believe a stock is a buy at $20 (their perceived intrinsic value plus an additional margin of
safety) but the stock was at $25 so they don't buy. Then the stock goes down to $15 because an article that
raises concerns they already know about scares people, do they buy at $15 and get a $10 per share
discount?


Yes.


19 Nov 2013, 01:53 PM


BPC Equity
1. You are assuming that an article with a couple thousand page views sways a stock that averages ~3 million
shares traded daily. This idea is false.


2. By your logic in presenting your argument I can deduce that you probably fall for the old mark it up and give
a discount sales gimmick.


So say the financials, growth prospects, operational risks, future market, and margin of safety required by the
investor for a certain company would indicate that the company is worth $20 per share. The stock comes
down from $25 dollars per share (price) to $20 per share. The investor buys. Did the investor get a discount
of $5 dollars per share? NO you overpaid by $5 per share. If the investor can buy for $20 what you can only
buy for $25 at that moment, then there is a $5 per share discount. Otherwise it is simply the price.


There is A LOT that can be gained when one learns the difference between price and value. The institutional
investor will buy based on value not price.

contributed to the drop in ONVO's price today? Are you scared now!! I am terrified!!!


Now, let's stop playing dumb. To answer your question, you bet I do, but not in the way you want to portray
probably. It's never a simple calculation - SA puff piece, buy the stock now!


What retail investors need is information. SA and the fool provides some - usually with a bias. Guess what,
you BPC, with your 786 comments, provide some information that can influence investment decisions also.
Yes, you my friend! I take all of that into consideration when investing and I appreciate all of it - good and bad.
I read message boards. I look at this website and that website. I try products out when I can. I go to stores. I
see what other people are wearing and using. I read science articles I have no clue of understanding to get a
feel of what's going on. I don't believe everything I read here or there, but I don't discount it's value just
because it comes from an SA or fool article or someone I don't know named BPC Equity.

About this article Emailed to: 10,197 people who get ONVO real-time alerts and 370,875 people who get
Investing Ideas daily.


Not a couple thousand people you are talking about. This is only email!


Now think if just 20,000 of that 390,000 decided to trade on a $10 stock in one of the hottest industries in the
market now. How many shares would that entail you think? A few million maybe?


19 Nov 2013, 03:07 PM


BPC Equity
Ok so 2/3 of the average trading volume of this particular stock is influenced by SA? C'mon man! Of the
370,875 that get emailed daily what percentage do you think read the emails form SA, come to the conclusion
that perhaps I should take action with that piece of the portfolio, and then subsequently do so? I would
venture to guess it is rather minimal.


As one commenter noted above, that this author received a response from the CEO of ONVO, as being a
scam. You read that as this forum has a deep reach into the pulse of commerce and investment circles. I read
that as: Why in the world is a CEO of a start-up biotech firm focusing on SA? Is he glued to his company's
Yahoo Finance screen tracking every pip in the stock price? The fact that there was time taken out of the
managements day to draft a response to online web forums indicates to me: 1. There must not be much on
this guys plate or 2. He is himself worried about the price and his financial interests.


Have you contributed to SA? If you have, you would know that publishing is not instantaneous with a click.
Therefore, if the author poses an article for review and submission, it could take days for the piece to be
published. SA controls the flow of the articles not the author.

But you are telling me price doesn't matter. These smart guys aren't going to pay $20 for a stock if it's at $15.
Are you telling me they put in orders to buy at $20 and just leave it there until circumstances change?
Circumstances are always changing. Look at ONVO today. Who predicted it would drop 30%? No doubt
institutional investors wait and see.


In one way, I see your argument as irrefutable. New information, trends, change their valuation and risk
models I'm guessing. In that sense, you are always right. But that takes the heart out of this argument of
"discounts." That's why puff pieces and dump pieces are written. That's why there are so many authors that
are criticized for circulating biased, and misleading, information. That's why stocks can get oversold or
become cheap.

today? Hey, this article that gets circulated to about 400,000 people by email alone.


10,000 of these guys get alerts and 50% probably own ONVO (5000). If you take just 5% of 380,000 you
have 19,000 people I'll count as investors ("minimal" you might say). That's 24,000 investors getting a short
article with a stock that is asking for people to take their profits. Yeah, snowball.

"These smart guys aren't going to pay $20 for a stock if it's at $15. Are you telling me they put in orders to buy

Try to separate "price" (a function of the stock market) and "value" (a function of the company's operations,
financial performance, prospective market for their product or service, growth in the company's revenue,
earnings, and more importantly cash flow(not necessarily for a start-up), risks involved with operations, risks
involved with competitors, and risks involved with the economy as a whole, and the return you would require
as an investor in light of all of these risks).


If an investor (company or individual) asses the risks involved with a particular investment and deems that
$20/share is the current VALUE of the company, of course they are going to buy at a PRICE of $15. This is a
discount to intrinsic value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 43/106


So in the case of ONVO (briefly):


You would consider a possible market that would require the use of organ assays for bio-med testing,
determine what market share the company may be able to achieve versus the competition. Try to determine a
profitability in the future for the company, maybe determine what avenues for add on projects, new uses for
the product (maybe printing donor organs in the distant future), determine what risks are involved in their
operational process,......, then you would also have to determine if the company can make it to the future and
profitability numbers without having to take on considerable additional capital for R&D and CAPEX costs, ....
really there is no end, and you are correct it can be ever changing.


Bottom line is stocks don't get over-bought or over-sold because of any article period. If you are willing to risk
your financial well being based upon the movements of a school of fish then by all means go ahead it is after
all yours to do so.


The problem with retail investors is a vast majority of them either don't have the acumen to read between the
lines when it comes to financials or don't bother reading them at all. So they are forced to manage their
portfolios based off of articles that are published on this website and many others to generate AD REVENUE
whether the content is factual or not. The same goes for Fool, WSJ, Marketwatch, Cramer ... you name it.


The problem with "investing" in start-up tech an biomeds is there is fierce competition, a lot of uncertainty, and
no immediate profits to begin with.


If you want to be an investor research fundamental analysis, value investing, and contrarian investment ideas.
If you want to be a short term trader look at technical indicators.


Either way good luck

I also should have linked to articles I have read about management. I'd have to research that again. The main
concerns I had were about transparency of mgmt's use of stock issuance, but it's been several months since I
looked hard at it. Richard's claim that they have issued stock to themselves would strengthen those concerns.

ONVO's partners? Would those costs nonetheless appear on ONVO's sheets? Is what they are doing really
expensive or mostly just HR costs and petri dishes? I don't know! Does this author know?


2. Institutional investors can be wrong and often are. I don't say that lightly.


3. If stocks don't get overbought or oversold, how do you explain ONVO's dramatic run and decline? You may
not believe an article can make a difference, but there are posters above that have said they sold because of
the article.

There was an article about YY in August that obliterated the company, implying they were porn site(ish) and
cooking the books. Many posters on there sold based on that article. You may not like it, but that's retail
investors for you and we screw everything up for the textbook guys.


I hear a lot about market psychology. Is that nonsense too?

"Is some R&D cost covered by ONVOs partners?"  
Don't know. Don't care. If it takes ONVO more capital to bring a product from concept to fruition than it does a
competitor, does it really matter when the money is coming from? I think not because eventually the partner
footing the bill will either have control over the company or likely take business elsewhere.


I don't know what the author knows or doesn't. Don't care. I use these forums to gauge public sentiment about
a company not as investment research.


Institutional investors can be wrong, you are absolutely right. If you arm yourself with knowledge independent
from these sources, then institutional investors being wrong is the best thing that can happen to you. (Look up
David Dreman).


I said that stocks don't get overbought or oversold based on crappy or solid articles on SA, Fool, ..., big
difference.


I don't know much about YY. I also don't invest in China. If the position you are in is shakey enough to be
swayed by some bloggers, then you probably shouldn't be in that position.


Market psychology is real. I love market psychology, I act in an inverted manner to what the psyco market is
doing.

Thanks for your comments, Douglas. You are arguing (and agreeing) with both bulls and bears so your words
carry a bit more weight. What about author's claim that management is issuing stock to itself. Is that
legitimate?


Management may be much better than I have surmised.

SA Editor Douglas W. House, Contributor
platonic: The stock issuances claim is not a smoking gun. If you look at any early stage public company that
enjoys a run-up, you'll see options exercised, open market sales, etc. These transactions are customary
because they are, in many cases, the bulk of compensation for the execs. This is the payback for the risks
taken. Upon the execution of these transactions, you should expect to see additional option grants, stock
awards, stock grants, etc. At first blush, this appears self-serving. After all, is management not in for the long
haul? If the future is so bullish, why are they cashing out? And why are they stuffing their collective pockets

again? In essence, they are taking money off the table, much in the same way ONVO longs did once the
stock became extended. It doesn't mean that they believe that the company is now a fraud, it just means that
the market has over-reached and now is a good time to book profits. Once the price fully corrects and begins
building a new base, sellers will return as buyers and the process will begin anew. If you don't mind some
unsolicited advice, spend your due diligence time analyzing the technical issues surrounding 3D bioprinting of
tissues and organs and the size of the market for 3D assays. This will clarify the pros and cons and will
enable you to see through the hype. If you haven't already, read my Tengion article, my regenerative medicine
article and my ONVO article. Each of these is quite extensive and should provide useful background info for
you.


When you evaluate any nano cap stock concentrate on the growth story. This is what will propel it upward.
The area that I look for in the financing realm is any unusual transactions, contracts, related-party
transactions, etc., that would imply impropriety. This requires expertise to judge this, of course.

Douglas,


Your comments seem insightful and intelligent, as do your related articles; thank you.


The points you make remind me of an experience I had during the internet bubble period: At the time I was
working toward MD and PhD degrees in a research lab at a well-known New York hospital and some of us
young folk were of course following the unbelievable performance of the tech sector in the late 1990s.


Anyway it became known to us in the lab that a small biotech (that is still currently trading) had entered a
relationship with our lab regarding possible development of a protein of human neutrophils for use in fighting
certain types of bacterial infection--dangerous types of blood infections affecting very few people/year. We
promptly started following the company--not just the equity price charts, but the chatter at investment sites
regarding the company. We were SHOCKED at the kind of comments people were posting--the product was
the BEST THING EVER and was going to cure everything and anything and the stock was going to the moon
etc etc. These people knew nothing. We weren't sure how many were naive retail investor fanboys and how
many were people who were long and using the media to pump the stock so they could sell. We were working
with this protein for years in various academic pursuits and none of the claims had the slightest bit of merit,
people making the claims had no understanding of the markets the product might be aimed at and their size
(VERY SMALL it turned out) blah blah blah.


Anyway, I decided just before the most recent surge to write put options on ONVO well below the money.
Based on further reading I think I may decide to BUY some puts using the proceeds I got writing the previous
puts. Thanks again--very early, no products, private competition. Looks like maybe a tiny long-term bet on
both ONVO and especially InSphero may make sense at a far more reasonable (i.e. lower) price.

Hobdair: Many thanks for the kind words. Yes, stock pumpers are "a dime a hundred". This has been the case
ever since the first bourse opened in Amsterdam in 1609. I would caution you on the use of options if you
have not thoroughly researched how the prices behave and how to trade them. For example, you will only
make $ going long if there is a big move, say 30% or more. This is why professional options traders write
them, instead of buy them. Usually, traders will offset a long position with a corresponding short position on
the other side in order to minimize the risk and the $ paid.


ONVO's price spike was due, in large part, to being a 3D printing company. If you look at the charts of DDD
and SSYS you will see comparable price action. Bullish investor sentiment re 3D printing still has legs so be
careful on the short side. In my opinion, ONVO's realistic valuation considering the "castle-in-the-air" allure of
tissue engineering is ~$500M. This will undoubtedly go up as the Liver Assay launch date approaches. This is
because it will be the first "3D product" on the market. The modest size of the opportunity won't matter early
on. It will when ONVO discloses its sales numbers, though. Also, if ONVO announces any collaborations with
Big Pharma, it will goose the share price. I think this is probable. Don't forget that regenerative medicine is
one the market's "next big things". Take a look at Gartner's Hype Cycle graph. ONVO may already be on its
way up the steep part of the curve. Yikes!

Your comments about options are not quite correct, Douglas. While it sometimes does take a drastic move to
profit by exercising options by buying or selling the reference stock, the options themselves can be sold at
market value. It doesn't take much for the value of an option to increase (or decrease) in value by 50% or
more.


25 Nov 2013, 12:44 PM


SA Editor Douglas W. House, Contributor
platonic: I'm not sure what you're saying. ....the options themselves can be sold at market value. Huh? If the
market value of an option drops 50%, yes, you can sell it at market value. This represents a 50% loss,
though, I believe.


My comments are correct. Most of the $ is made writing options, not buying them due to the rapid time decay.
Also, I didn't mention those niggly issues of liquidity and slippage. Most retail investors have no business
dabbling in options because they don't have the first clue on how to trade them.


25 Nov 2013, 04:33 PM

We may be talking past each other. Obviously you know how options work, but for the sake of any new

You said, "You only make $ when you go long if there is a big move." It is true that you make big money (2-
20X return) only when there is a big move. But in this market there are many stocks that go up 10% in a
month. If you buy options on such a stock with a strike 10% below the stock price on a day when the price is
near support (50 or 100 day moving average), there is a good probability that you will double your money on
a 10% move in the stock price.


Take for instance a stock that trades at $90 in early November and for which Dec21 $80 calls are available for
$10.50. A 10% rise in the stock results in almost 100% return.


I agree that most people don't know how to trade options, but it doesn't take long to learn.


The beautiful thing about buying options is that your downside is limited to the cash you use to purchase
them, whereas the upside is unlimited. The reverse is true of writing options.


I know someone who started trading options in September and the value of his portfolio (only a fraction of
which he put at risk) is up 80%... and this after numerous trades that were a complete loss. I don't know how
long the market conditions that allow him to do this will remain, but this does seem to be a very good time to
learn how to trade options.

While I believe we share the same views about ONVO I have to weigh in with da House on the foolishness of
trading options for amateur traders. In the right hands, yes, options can multiply your gains but considering
that most 'traders' haven't a clue they can also magnify losses. The fact that losses are limited to the
premiums will still add up quickly. That's why the pros make money writing options knowing they will mostly
expire worthless. Even I rarely buy puts to short a stock preferring to write naked calls. That said Pearson's
advice to buy deep ITM puts makes a lot of sense when it's a stock with a high borrow rate. Usually the time
value decay is offset by the interest expense saved.


26 Nov 2013, 04:55 AM


BPC Equity
Not to nitpick platonic, but:


"The beautiful thing about buying options is that your downside is limited to the cash you use to purchase
them, whereas the upside is unlimited. The reverse is true of writing options. "


is not entirely true. When you buy calls your upside is unlimited, but when buying puts your upside is limited.


26 Nov 2013, 09:30 AM


Mukticat
Also when you take a position via options if they expire worthless you got zero. If you buy or short the stock it
might not move in your direction but percentage-wise you've still got the position which probably has gone
nowhere near zero.

In principle I suppose this is true, but when you can make 1-20X buying puts and 1-∞X buying calls, where do
you draw the line? I've seen 13X return in a day on out of the money puts. So far I haven't seen anything that
good on calls, though in principle I could.


These ONVO puts will probably net 2-5X by the end of December. It's hard to complain about the upside on
puts not being big enough! Plus I think it's easier to time when a stock is overextended and ready to plummet
than when it is ready to take off.


27 Nov 2013, 07:00 PM


Greenfire87
"options"  
Let's not forget to add margin to this conversation, which can multiply your long position by 2.5 -3.5 times your
buying power. On momo stocks, one should hedge such a bet with equal puts to protect against losses when
the air gets let out of your tires. Protective puts are cheap insurance against major losses when momo's go
nono's.

As you state in the beginning you are a SHORT! So your article for me is the same! You wrote all kind of BS before

But GE uses it for fuel injectors, NASA for a rocket engine! I did notice some of your facts in here are twisted a bit but
most are correct! I will still hold some ONVO, but sold a lot the other day because anybody with sense knew a price
correction was coming!

Northwest Trader, Contributor
3D printing is not as strong. It has improved. It is also slow. Which is also improving. Only recently has direct
laser sintering allowed for the fabrication of higher strength metals.


That said, there is no precedent for determining strength of metal performance as the underlying crystal
structures of the metal are inconsistent.


So as we stand now, there will always be a place for cast and machined metals.


There is progress being made with internal geometries that may compensate for this. There are trade offs.


So high performing metals will likely continue to be alloys and composites. I am speaking from an aerospace
perspective.


I can see 3 D printed... (hardware (non-structural), jewelry, machine parts) quickly becoming common place.

Richard has been on a role lately and I have no reason to think it is because of luck. Even without reading his article,
if I had seen ONVO go up I would have been looking for a chance to pounce on puts. ONVO management is not
investable in my opinion. Probably the only reason they are publicly traded is that they were falling behind the other
companies and needed cash to stay afloat. There will be many other chances to short them successfully as more
advanced 3D bio printing companies go public.


19 Nov 2013, 12:45 PM

I suggest that longs instead of wasting their breath trying to rebut something with nothing consider instead the trading
dynamics of a hot momo stock like ONVO. The last time ONVO was pumped from 2 to 11 was in mid-2012. The longs
were making the same breathless projections about ONVO's phenomenal potential even back then.


What happened? The smart early money sold to the follow-on crowd and the stock almost as quickly plunged back
down to 2. It remained at 2 for the next six months until most likely the experience, and unlucky participants, of that
debacle moved on and a new batch of fresh-faced investors replaced them.


That's how stocks get broken and repaired . . . and broken again. Today's drop is just the beginning of the Great
Unravelling. In fact all you need to do is look at TSLA - another company with a huge momentum trader following and
little institutional support - to watch this at work (although I think most would agree that it's unfair to Tesla to compare
them to a vaporous company like ONVO).


19 Nov 2013, 12:48 PM


User 5877231
2 key words there. Insti support. Don't see that with ONVO.


For short term 1-2 month trades, one doesn't have to be correct on the product release date, prospects,
competitors, etc. One just needs to check insti support, insider sales and price trends of the stock. They all
point to a level below current $9.60 today.

It's obvious that the author has no expertise in the various techniques from biochemical, cytologic or a physiologic
perspective. First, liver enzymes assays and this technology is NOT the same nor does it use scaffolding technology.
These other companies (named above) employ this technique. To say apples to apples does not even apply here. Yes
scaffolding technology is 3D but that is the whole POINT. They're all the same!!! This is what Oganovo offers, it
different and it's as nature has constructed it. And what we PhD's and other clinical providers see in this technology
goes way beyond liver assays. How Richard got so side tracked on the fact that all this techonlogy does is liver
assays is ridiculous. This way of cytologically layering tissue as it occurs in organism will be the new gold standard for
all biochemical & histologic modeling & can easy be tranformed into any clincal applications where advance modeling
will save millions and millions in hard research resources and the applications are so widespread. You can't even
speculate on all the various applications because they will extend into many fields such as oncology, hematology,
neural, orthopaedic and the list goes on and on. It won't just be a technology for pharmaceuticals companies. Who
came up with that idea... that it will only be used for toxicologic assays and so forth?? The "liver assay" was just a
step of demonstrating a single clinical application. And you can not even compare scaffolding technology to pure
cellular organization as it occurs anatomicalyl and physiologically in the organ system. You could test wind speeds on
a likeness of a house built out of cardboard and use it as your "standard model". Or take your predictions of how
these materials will hold up in the wind from building an actual house out of real bricks and morter & constructed
exactly as people will live in.

Neovasculization is in no way problematic. I would say they have not had time to focus on those cascades but
as you know if a segmental nerve root can reinnervate then certainly the very basic proliferative phase and
vascular extention is a small problem that will soon be addressed. It may take time and collaboration but not
more than a year. Now keep in mind I have absolutely no knowledge of this company other than the science.
However they obviously needed at this time to focus on what they have to work with and getting data out
there to prove their basic science. What you must realize is protein manufacturing, peptide assembly will
allow for any growth factor needed. Insulin like growth hormone, growth hormone releasing factor etc... What I
see is the timing & blending of these technologies, with the assembly of basic proteins and long chain
peptides will aid and allow researchers to essentially side step the religous right & their retardive influrance of
scientific discovery.

It would be nice to see articles written about ONVO by other authors. This guy had a few that were published and very
similar to this and then taken down by SA. I'm operating on memory here because I don't cache my entire web history.
Does anyone else remember this happening with this author and his articles about ONVO?

If all this is correct, why didn't you post your article BEFORE the run up? How do your trust a short specialist with this
timing of an article that appears to profit shorts?


19 Nov 2013, 02:35 PM


platonicbomb
the guy above you indicates he did post several articles prior to the run up but SA took them down.


19 Nov 2013, 06:27 PM


debauche
Does timing of an article influence it's legitimacy somehow? Funny how you expect shorts to take the time to
write an article like this and share it prior to a run, for no real gain for themselves other than what.. to be a
good citizen or something? Do you ask why the pumpers didn't time their articles for this drop instead, or are
they held to a different standard??


19 Nov 2013, 06:49 PM

Actually he does have articles on ONVO from the past.

The ad hominen squad just showed up to try to slime Richard. When you can't attack the facts attack the messenger.
Apparently the 25% dip today did the trick.


There's zero hope of getting your money or profits back if you bought above 10 so use any deadcat bounce to get
what you can, while you still can.


Remember TSLA? After earnings came out it dropped from mid-170's to 150. But that was just the start. It's now in
the mid-120's. Once these empty shells begin to come apart it's hard to tell where they'll bottom (though in fairness to
TSLA it's not as empty).

Richard has none of the facts correct and niether do you. If your saying a particular company is all hype
please discuss the details of their specific moldalities versus these other companies in which Richard is
saying ONVO is just another of... 
Please give real details not just a bunch of cliche or some old story about other companies and what you
guys call "pump n dump" . 
Where are Richards answers to some these excellent points that some other posters wrote about. Please be
specific.

'Richard has none of the facts correct and niether do you.'


johnjppa- Richard's been explicit, I've been explicit, it's you that needs to be explicit. This is a debate and if
you have a problem with some point or other in Richard's article let's hear it and tell the world how he got it
wrong. To simply state 'he's wrong, he's wrong' means nothing and isn't going to sway anyone who's mind
isn't already made up.

Look up the page I have several post and that clearly describes why ONVO product is different. Did you read
the post. It's as clear as a bell working with microtissues soultions or immuno imaging through antigen/antib
mech. is not the same as layer technology. Dude before you continue, I am sure that Organovo will put out
responses to these other technologies very soon and hopefully they are trained (better than myself) how to
present difficult biotech concepts to the non technical investors. Look at the post. 
I fine for a debate but address my above post "johnjppa" there's 2 others ...and let me know where my
reasoning is off.

Oh I did. Was it so hard to check 'headlines' for ONVO?


Here's what I already posted on another ONVO article today-


http://seekingalpha.co...


'Wow thanks for finding that censored, err pulled, Motley Fool article. How a newsletter that prides itself on
teaching rational prudent investing to the masses could allow itself to become a mouthpiece for contributing
writers, with long positions and a clear agenda to rope the dopes in, is beyond me.


I went back and counted and starting a week ago Tuesday there was a positive article that day, then again on
Weds, Thurs, Sat and Sunday. Five articles in one week extolling ONVO's supposed 3D excellence. Not one
made any attempt at correlating the valuation of the company to the possible this-decade revenue streams.
They just talked about 'revolutionary', 'disruptive', yada yada, all the current catchwords to excite a gullible
public.


Not even after this campaign had succeeded in driving the price from 9.00 last Tues to a 12.50 close by
Friday (after an earlier flirt with 13.50) did they question the valuation of ONE BILLION DOLLARS. Nope they
published two more articles over the weekend to prime the retail mugs for Monday.


They're a sad joke for what they've foisted on their followers. Kudos to SA for allowing the printing both sides
of the story.'


 
I Sought and I Easily Found!

Muk, you still haven't provided any links or titles. By your "count" is not a title. You lost this one. Just save
your credibility and admit it. It's sad, because you caution people and that's necessary, but you don't need to
do it falsely. The issue we are discussing isn't so huge, but it goes to the credibility of the author. He didn't
have to mislead.


Again, if you have the titles to all these puff pieces during the time the author stated from 11/6 to the date his
article was published from SA or the fool, provide them please. And once again, news and reports of what
happened during the week or a day don't count.


I already linked to the search results of both sites here. Maybe your search will turn up something different,
but there is only one way to spell ONVO.

Richard, Thanks for the enlightening article.

But notwithstanding the commercial or scientific future of Organovo, let the traders have their day: the nimble

Wait till Adam Feurstein and "Alpha Exposure" get ahold of this stock and write a "hit piece" here at Seeking Alpha.


ONVO investors--you have been forewarned. I've seen these guys summarily "take down" other stocks quickly. They
just wait for the most opportune time to do so.


The smart money will wait until after they have done their dirty work before going long. It's just to risky at these levels
now.

Somebody asked about a good entry point for ONVO... $1.50 per share? I looked at their SEC filings as well,
$23,000...Come on Man!


I never have short interest in a stock, or root for a stock to crash, but after watching this run-up and investors trying to
call ONVO a 3-D sector play when it is nothing but hype, then yes I am now rooting for this ONVO to go away....

I agree with heraldlau. Everybody values differently. This article is a little too pragmatic for me. I'm sure some people
are just investing in a trend but I believe many are investing in the potential of this company. This article lacks
imagination. Did the Amazon's of the world climb a pragmatic ladder? Or did they take a few unforeseen leaps? A
company doesn't explode practically. It takes a few of the right ingredients at the right time. I believe ONVO has that
potential. That is why I am invested.

My investment strategy is not day to day. I invest in years. I got in early on this company and intend to be here

Pragmatism is for value investing, which I appreciate. However, I am invested in this company for its potential
growth. There is no way to value breakthrough innovation or even anticipate it regardless of tendencies. If
their was no real potential here, these large pharma companies would not waste a second on partnerships.
Their faith gives me faith that this companies potential is exponential.

Insphero, the only company even worth addressing, which is obviously why the author dedicated the most time to it,
does something very different from what ONVO does, and produces very different results. They do not have a 3D
printing platform, with which they can create layers of different types of cells. They have a well plate that creates a
hanging drop. http://bit.ly/1dUs3q8 . I encourage you to read through this, and watch the video and compare it to
Organovo.

There simply are no liver assays out today that are direct competitors to Organovo or that can match the published
performance of the Organovo liver assays.


Keith has also been very open about the fact that they are currently working on multiple other tissue types, and that
livers are simply the first they will bring to market.

from being economically feasible. I did a blog post on in vitro meat if you want to check it out. A hamburger
only costs several hundred thousand dollars, for instance. Don't look for printed handbags any time soon.

This article proves a point i make very often in my articles I write for SA: you can make more money READING SA
articles than you can writing them. If ONVO has more shoes to drop, they will do so and Mr. Pearson will gain
readers, etc. Keep in mind all the 3d printing companies got hit hard today, perhaps in sympathy...perhaps just a bad
day for stocks with PE ratios in the zillions.


19 Nov 2013, 04:10 PM

Mr. Pearson refers to other authors owning the stock and infating the price through positive articles day after day like
it is a bad thing and it has never happened before. I do not see how this is any differant than Mr. Pearson writing a
negitive article and shorting the stock. Thank you for pushing the price down and giving me another great buying
opportunity. Here is my discloseur I AM LONG THE STOCK!!!


19 Nov 2013, 04:26 PM


User 7941361
Thank you for the well-written, well-researched article! It's a very good summary of the major concerns with this
business and I agree the valuation is nonsense. I'm long the stock, bought more today, and will buy more if it hits $7.


This is a developmental stage company and the CEO says as much when he talks about the future of their products.
Organovo will not be printing full organs any time soon, but he has said that they have plans to develop more
products. I completely agree that you shouldn't expect enormous profits in 3 years and the share price appreciation is
disconcerting from that perspective.


You mentioned that it's not the only company with this technology, but the only public one. While nothing about the
company currently makes it sound like a great investment, hedging upside can be just as important as downside, so I
like ONVO as a small speculative play, but not a large investment to throw everything behind. ONVO has a history of
fluctuating wildly though, so if you have any money in it, from any side, you need to be committed and not be swayed
by the daily swings because that's how you'll get burned on this, no matter which side you're on.


19 Nov 2013, 04:29 PM


jbessette90
Thank you for you opinion Mr. Pearson. It's very simple why the shares ran up: institutional investors like Vanguard,
Oppenheimer, and Piper Jaffray bought in. Institutions now hold eight percent of ONVO where as before in 2012 they
did not.


In addition your examples of competitors like InspereO's gravity drop are inferior to Organovo's Novogen bio-printer
technology something you would have realized if you had technical expertise in your camp or just having dealt with it
yourself.


It appears in your rush to do your due diligence you failed to understand the VAST technology gap between Novogen
and InsphereO in addition to all the other "so called" competitors are merely suppliers of InsphereO the inferior
technology supplier or Academic Institution like Wake Forrest and the DOD.

My time in academia and the military have given me the experience that they are NOT PROFIT driven organization
only research & development.


Organovo is one of a kind technology and terms of insiders selling they have to increase the float and raise capital, it's
obvious you are short and with less and less shares available to short you have to be creative on the options side of
the game.


Mr. Pearson you are mistaken and time will vindicate me while you are relegated to just earning a short paycheck!


19 Nov 2013, 04:41 PM


Mukticat
'It's very simple why the shares ran up: institutional investors like Vanguard, Oppenheimer, and Piper Jaffray
bought in.'


You clearly do not understand how the market works. Institutional investors only report their holdings long
after the fact, in this case their buying occurred at least 50 days ago, if not longer. Therefore they could not be
responsible for this recent pump and dump. If they had been foolish enough to be buying they would have
rushed out with analysts to refute Pearson and defend their position but obviously they didn't.


No doubt Murphy will be out with something to try to promote the stock again. That's to be expected- this
company and his 6.7M shares have proven to be a goldmine for him.


As for Insphero I have zero doubt that you and the rest of the aggrieved longs had no idea it even existed
before this morning.


PS- Piper Jaffrey has no position at all in ONVO. Oppenheimer owns a glorious 33,000 shares out of 90M.

It should be no surprise to anyone that the stock was overvalued based on their earnings, most "development stage"
companies are. What is interesting is the sheeple that would actually lend credence to an admitted short and force the
stock down 30% when this article was spun with a one-sided objective in mind. You could trash google if you put the
right spin on it. Watch the stock go back up to $13 tomorrow. I hope you all hedged your shorts.

Deja Vu, Contributor
Courageous article. Many times one would hesitate to write such a forceful article as the cost of defending a lawsuit
can quickly bankrupt an individual.


Either you are very courageous or did not think the thing through (note whether you are right, as you most likely are,
is irrelevant). I was threatened with a lawsuit in response to an article I wrote (I'm going to be super vague where and
when) and I had weeks of sleepless nights and rebukes from the wife and fears for the financial well being of my
family.


You might want to consider that if you have already not. Perhaps you may want to set up a LLC and write the article
as the LLC, not as an individual. I'm not an attorney however so take what I say with a pinch of salt. Excellent article, I
enjoyed reading it.


19 Nov 2013, 04:46 PM

It does take courage to write an article like this. As anyone can easily see Pearson has disturbed an entire
hornets nest with his article, something that simply doesn't happen when SA authors write bullish pieces. And
yes I've heard many instances of companies suing or threatening to sue authors. It points up to why anyone
writing a short article has to be super careful about getting their facts right.


SLAPP suits, which it sounds like you were threatened with, can easily be defended (IF you have the
resources!), false information not so much.


All the more reason to give credence to Pearson's work.

Courage? These types of articles are written all the time with little real threat of a lawsuit being filed. Give me
a break. There is so much false and misleading information out there, anyone with a brain can write
something negative and not entirely true but avoid getting sued.


The "courage" comes in publishing something that the author knows misleads people as to the facts.

Mr. Pearson, how long did it take you to write this bomb shell my friend? Do not get me wrong but making money in
the market is all about anticipation and participation. Thus, why do you end the party when the troopers are dancing

You're way off on this in a couple regards... need to read your sources a bit closer.


In fact... it's all wrong, lol.


You cited the press releases referencing 500million in sales. current valuations are based on 50 million in sales, and
that's appropriate, no one evaluated based on 500million. $13-15 dollar price range is appropriate.


Why are 3d printed cells so valuable? in vivo vs in vitro correlation. In vitro, in a lab, currently moderately correlates
with in vivo, in body, functioning.


Insphero produces cryopreserved cells, frozen and dumped on a dish. ONVO will replace them and many others,
that's their goal. Live 3d cells have a very accurate in vivo correlation, it's already been demonstrated. ONVO
achieved viability of 40 days, enough for acute and subacute testing. That's the true number to watch for the value of
their assays. if that number can grow up to 3-6 months you can do subchronic and chronic testing.


insider selling... They've been insider selling since the stock was much smaller. They weren't insider owner sellings
but planned corporate selloffs.


Appreciate your research, but believe you're way way off on this one.


19 Nov 2013, 05:00 PM


just read the instructions
nice timing in publishing this selling proposal.


19 Nov 2013, 05:00 PM


greeg3
Agree completely with your article. Long ONVO since $5.05 and still long, but with some puts as a hedge. I definitely
believe ONVO will be headed below $10/share and hopefully back to levels of $5-$6, where I can buy more. Only
thing that worries me is all this institutional buying, which creates a lot of volume for ONVO to work through on its way
down...


19 Nov 2013, 05:01 PM


Bullmarketcall
Sold all shares at roughly 8. At that point, share price looked overbought at least. 8-12 became pure euphoria. there is
a 1 billion company that only looses money, has no product to sell and has a brilliant future _ but fore the coming 2
years to be patient. Shares could easily be worth 4$ again. That was a price. Hoewver, shares could double too. But
not from anything solid. Again, like what happened this year to UNXL or NQ. Outstanding future, but present in doubt.

Hope you are still very thankful, for your loss, by a knee jerk reaction. Next time, try to read the article more
closely, paying attention to the small print, where the author says he has just shorted the stock. Also try to do
your own due diligence.


09 Jan 2014, 02:25 PM

Short sighted to say the least! Good article if you are a day or swing trader. Long term investors see the potential for
enormous gains with ONVO.


19 Nov 2013, 05:14 PM


leonct74
I think any writer should be carefully when analyse and compare scientific products without having the proper
background and knowledge. Ttuong11 is right, what is the most encouraging and unique about Organovo is the
thickness they have achieved in their bio-printed tissues. Really appreciate if you could update your article with
companies who have released the very same product if you can find any.


19 Nov 2013, 05:15 PM


PatrickC41963
He can't update with other companies who have released the same product because you and I know they do
not exist. I am disappointed that the stock took a dive over the last couple of days, but I am still up over 125%
since my initial investment in January, so I am not worried. ONVO only makes up a very small part of my
portfolio and I have a lot of faith that it will make up a huge part of my portfolio as long as I hold on for the
ride. I am not swayed by the naysayers.


21 Nov 2013, 03:50 PM

Insphero is a cryo liver assay company. Most of the listed are, and it's extremely old type of tech. You sort of listed off
who organovo will be replacing. Also.. maybe not the most unbiased source to reference? lol.

review in vivo and in vitro. in vitro, in lab, currently moderately correlates with in vivo, in body. You want in vivo to be
as close as possible to in vitro. The research has indicated 3d bioprinted cells from Organovo have that association.


Also the insider trading.. that's been debunked, as it should be. Please check the older articles.


Also the value of liver assays, you need to do more research there. Your numbers are valid but your conclusions
wrong. If you can get an accurate in vivo to in vitro correlation you will replace many current assays entirely and you
will be able to charge more than them.


As to the PR, valuation articles have been written. The $13 price was appropriate if they can achieve $50 million in
sales, no one used the $500 million marker.


19 Nov 2013, 05:23 PM


jhaverlack
Here's the problem I have with your 'analysis'. As soon as I saw your name as the author on the article, I already
knew what you were saying. The objectivity in your analysis is certain the "what is" of those metrics that are available
for anyone willing to do their own due diligence, but your subjectivity in relating your view paints you as a clearly
subjective author on the topic. That's not to say that makes your wrong, just not worth a lot of time.


Quite honestly, you were saying the same thing back in July and missed not only the huge rise and opportunity that it
presented on the back of your analysis, but missed a significant move in the segment overall.


Again, many of your financial arguments are the "What is" of their financial situation but what you don't know is what
we all don't know .... what is their future. The financial burn of this company is well understood. But so too is the
massive potential of their technology which can be considered near-term.


The markets today are as much about potentiality as they are about established and successful execution. That's not
to say that the current valuation and recent stock price rise is justified, but it's not to say that it isn't as well. The push
pull over valuation and potential has begun.


Your subjectivity continues to fail you here as it did back in July. You can be 100% correct about hard financial
aspects, yet miss tremendous opportunity. But my biggest message to you here is that I only had to see the author's
name to understand what was about to be said .... again.


Cheers!

It's funny but I see the author's name and I know that a huge amount of research, at great financial risk of
lawsuit if he gets it wrong, went into the article, and the results bear it out. Pearson recently panned FRAN,
NEON, IRG & TEAR based on predicted earnings shortfalls and guess what? Four for four tanked upon
earnings. Now five for five although of course ONVO has no revenues, much less earnings, so that's kind of
hard to attack, lol.

I think people (public) picked up on some potential indications such as organ transplants etc... This would be some
years down the road. However, the applications for this moldality is still so far reaching in things that would not
interest most people. However, to most researchers their are many potential applications. The seeding of granulation
tissue, synovium, possible treatments of spinal syrnx etc... If this company and Univ. of Missouri and the other parties
that are directly involved and have other interest are able to fully protect there techniques the value will be huge.
huge.

Richard, 
Great article and spot on. By the way I don't short stocks. I got out of ONVO last Friday. The stock reminded me of
NGEN and all the hype. I learned from that mess to be ready to get out quickly. 
I was going to buy back in when it reaches $5.00 but after reading your research I decided to wait. Do you think this
stock is going down the same as TNGN? As you stated TNGN is ahead of the game. Even the founder of ONVO
stated this during his presentation at a TED conference . Thanks for the research


19 Nov 2013, 05:44 PM

Richard, 
this is a great article. One of the best, I have seen here. I had some ONVO and after a few trades I decided to sell few
months ago ending up in loss. But nothing dramatic. 
Today I am really glad I did as I do not believe in this stock at all. 
If I could short the stock today, I would certainly do after reading your article. Unfortunatelly it is not possible to do it so
fast here in Europe. But thank you anyway. You earned another follower. 
Those people that do not agree with you are ridiculous to argue. They should be buying heavily :-)) $8.9, what a
wonderful opportunity :-))

u sold months ago at $5 and u are thanking Richard for that?


19 Nov 2013, 06:20 PM

John, 
Actually that time I read similar article showing things are not right at ONVO. That is why I sold months ago
for $5. You can imagine my feelings watching the stock going at $13 then. However I am really glad I did not
step in again. These days would be painful. And I am pretty sure this is not the end. This stock is driven by a
hype, not results or realistic goals. Most of investors just speculate and do not want to miss the chance to
spot on next Apple.  
So I thanked Richard for his article to assure me, I should not touch this stock with a ten feet pole... unless it
drops bellow $2 or a breaking news appears.

Can you trust a report from someone that believes Zacks over Motley Fool? I have no stock in ONVO nor would I
short it. But the author of this article certainly has shorted the stock and has redeemed his position by this tainted
article. I am amazed at how many people follow the hype on S.A. I hope S.A. Pro does better at informing the folks
than they do on the free sites.

"You guys speak like ONVO has some sort of exclusive right to every organ in the body or any of the other
possibilities you list, and no-one else does. Ridiculous."


No, but I believe they do have at this time the exclusive right to the human blood vessel. Check their IP.


19 Nov 2013, 08:13 PM


omeshrin
I agree that the valuation of $13 was somewhat high, but it's what people were willing to pay to own part of a
paradigm-shifting company.  
Do I think facebook is worth what it says it's worth, even taking its revenue into account? Of course not! There are
numerous overvalued companies, and Google's $80 IPO was once considered grossly overvalued but it just kept
climbing. If someone really wants to own and hold shares, they'll see the potential and have them.


Also, take this important thing into account. Most small-cap investors like myself do NOT have insider info. When that
big news breaks out after market close and the market makers make their move, regular investors riding the fence on
this stock get caught in the crossfire. It's easy to say "X is the correct valuation" but market makers do NOT work that
way. They talk that way, but they do not work that way.


I strongly disagree that there is zero chance they will make the revenue to justify the 1bil cap in the next several
years.  
Even though ONVO is not generating revenue at the moment, they do have products, they have potential, they have
very strong IP, solid ethics, and they have met every deadline. Additional revenue can come from royalties on drugs
and from partnerships, grants, IP, partnerships, and the implementation of ONVO's product into FDA laws and
regulations for all drug approval. If it can show a good record, it can also aim for monopolization, which is the path I'm
seeing here. Will it merge with other companies in the future? Probably. Will it be bought out? Possibly. Will it
generate revenue by outsourcing its IP? Likely.


When we're talking about competition, every company has competition. MSFT did, GOOG did, YHOO did. The market
thrives on competition. It drives companies to excel. What I like is ONVO's IP and the speed and precision with which
it has met its deadlines. I like prudent, active and ambitious companies.


No one can predict the future. Maybe it will take 30 years, who knows? But I seriously doubt that it will take that long
for ONVO to take off. And while product is scheduled to come out in late 2014, we don't actually know what will
happen. That's a forward-looking statement in itself. Something might happen before that. This is partly what makes
this stock so exciting. One surprise after the next.  
Just waiting and seeing.

$NOVO - This article sounds too personal than analytical. So what if the Company Managements are selling share?
Would not you do the same if you had worked in an IPO company for 5 years and your $0.00001 shares were $13? I
would sell and I think everyone else would as well. I suggest you make a table of new companies and list how many
share is being sold by each of their top Executives.

I pay attention to open market transactions. Not option executes or anything that is compensation based.
There are many reasons why Executives sell their shares. Boat, kids college, ....., you get the idea.


There is only one reason for an executive to execute an open market buy (in most cases), and that is
because he/she believes that the stock is cheap. There are however rare cases where an executive would
utilize an open market buy to raise capital for the company out of his/her own pocket. This can be seen most
recently in the case of Elon Musk buying shares of Tesla in the open market. IMO


20 Nov 2013, 10:04 AM


User 314828
If TSLA treasury shares were reissued, and Musk bought, or if a a newly issued secondary offering occurred
and Musk bought some of the secondary, then his purchase would facilitate bringing capital into the company.
An open market purchase would not bring capital into the company since, by definition, the shares that are
purchased are already in the OPEN MARKET! .

ALL the people in the market are not necessarily savy loaded. specially the retail chaps.. many do get influenced by
the tipsters,,pseudo analysts,brokerages and fund managers,,yes the new version of the old carnival callers on the t
v.-the worst type of hustlers. most retail are carried away by jargon, fancied flavour of the time. 
else, how and why were there broken beggars from the speculating/investing community? 
the telling arguments in the article are::1 the insider mass selling 2the ceo's time frame of 2+years for any worthwhile
product sales,3no hint of any research work on any other product,,4 the presence of existng similar product selling
competition--there was an alleged Ph.D ABOVE SPOUTING this ology and that but not conclusively refuting
anything5 the usual bubble formation of unjustified price bloat in ultra short time and quetionable timing. 
as we all know>> the market runs on the greater fool is born every minute principle. < greed drives up, and like a
frightened horse rearing up on its hind legs at the cliff edge,, and bolt back- the precipitous retracement too takes
place..  
the institutional ,fund manager absence may well be because, they r not convinced fully of the worthiness of the
management's credentials to see through the development to sales stage,, the sustainability of the relevance ofbthe
product,, its marketability, and profitability and so on 
. the most charitable explanation can be--- they are allowing thepeople like us the honour,, pleasure and pat in of
funding the research and development to saleability,, and if successful swoop down to pick up the fat creature ,, while
the toilers will be happy with small potatoes..

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 76/106


11:49 yesterday John's comment $8.70  
2:26 (your comment time) $8.84


You call a 1.6% return a ton??? HAHAHA


21 Nov 2013, 02:41 PM


suhaas
16 cents change in a 8 dollar stock does not make it a 1.6% gain. Also, profit depends upon number of shares
bought, numbers sold, and price at which it was sold.


Obviously your math is as bad as your investing acumen. Stay invested!

If the author thinks that volume spiked from 3M shares to 12-15+M based on "retail investors" and a few Motly Fool
articles, he is clearly mistaken. Volume of that size can only come from institutions.

The good thing about this article(other than im able to pick up cheap shares) is the response that comes from the
CEO who has nothing better to do than watch a blog site hack...


Time to cover 
I'm wondering what the environmental industries will be...

The Great Unravelling continues. ONVO, which has been purely marketed to retail investors, rises and falls on the
backs of momentum traders. Had it been otherwise the stock would not have risen 100% following a no-news, no-
revenue earnings report. Institutions just don't invest that way; easily gulled retail do. Likewise a single article like
Pearson's could not have pulled the rug so thoroughly as to cause the stock to plunge 35% in two days.


Had there been institutional interest they would have supported the stock with purchases and analyst
announcements. Instead we get Keith Murphy running to the nearest 'Retail Investor Conference' to try to staunch the
bleeding.


The name of the conference says it all.

5/22/2018 A Very Detailed Look At Organovo - Organovo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:ONVO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 77/106


Mukticat
ONVO looks to be heading for the 7's. No matter what you think about the company you also need to
consider that this is technically broken. With the millions of shares traded in the 10's to 13's there are a lot of
underwater, bagho . . . err, traders.


Once upon a time, like Monday, they were elated, sure they were on a rocket ride to at least 20. Now they've
belatedly discovered that they're the Greater Fool du jour. The music's over or whatever metaphor you prefer
to use.


Behavioral psych being what it is it is well known that people experience the pain of loss far more acutely than
the joy of a gain. Ergo one's investment goals quickly shift from 'I'm gonna be rich if I stick this out!' to 'OMG
please lord get me out of this at less of a loss!'


What this means in practical terms is that as long as a stock is on an upswing making new highs every long's
a winner and there's not a lot of sellers. The stock easily goes parabolic. Now the situation is roughly
reversed. There's very few buyers and every long is praying for some small spike, anything to allow them to
reduce their losses. In their rush to be first out they'll smother any deadcat bounce that comes their way. We
saw that earlier today after the stock managed a small rebound based on an ONVO pr released this morning.
But within a few hours it had been quashed and we're back to making new lows. That is the nature of
'overhead'. None before, lot's now. It creates a wall of resistance.


If you add in the inevitable margin calls - a long squeeze if you will - then you can look forward to forced
selling tomorrow which in turn creates more margin problems.


My point? Arguing about Richard's article now isn't a viable trading strategy. You'll have your chance to get
back in at a much lower price if you still believe in ONVO while sparing yourself further losses if you exit
pronto.


20 Nov 2013, 03:21 PM


dcmorris
I exited my trading position 19 minutes after I received the notice that this article was published, without
looking at anything else. Learned that one from the last time. Others should learn this for the next time. I keep
my long position for reasons you dont seem to understand.


Speaking of the last time, its amusing that the short attack in July, ONVO was trading at +7 and you boys
were pumping that the stock was going down to 4. This time at +13 you boys are pumping this stock going to
7. I suppose time will pass and we will see another factual deficent short bent thesis from your master when
the sp hits around 20. I'm in, see ya then.


20 Nov 2013, 10:18 PM


Mukticat
Frankly anyone who saw this go parabolic and didn't stick a trailing stop on it needs their head examined.


Last July it dropped from 8.50 to 5.00, or -40%, a respectable move. I don't recall if I put a price target on it
but it worked out fine.

onvo is still 50% overvalued according to the PR released today by the Company! Best Case Scenario ... Fair Value is
4.48!


Today's PR ... released by the company is very bearish!! TAM is the broadest definition of Market!!!


All Addressable Market ... 500m by 2088? ... Lol ... ONVO to go to 5$ before the End of the Year!


Total addressable market (TAM), also called total available market, is a term that is typically used to reference the
revenue opportunity available for a product or service. TAM helps to prioritize business opportunities by serving as a
quick metric of the underlying potential of a given opportunity.[1] 
One approach is to estimate how much of the market any company can gain if there were no competitors. A more
encompassing variation is to estimate the market size that could theoretically be served with a specific product or
service. TAM can be defined as a global total (even if a specific company could not reach some of it) or, more
commonly, as a market that one specific company could serve (within realistic expansion scenarios). This focuses
strategic marketing and sales efforts and addresses actual customer needs. The inclusion of constraints such as
competition and distribution challenges then modifies the strategy to frame it with realistic boundaries, reducing the
market down to the serviceable available market (SAM), the percentage of the market that can actually be served
(either by that company or all providers) out of the TAM.[1]


Even CEO's pumping estimates ... put ONVO Value at less than 5$ per share!!


50% (optimistic assumption) of the 500m market .. is ... 250m in revenue ... 30% Net Income ... would translate into
75m USD profits per year! ... in 2018! (5 years from now!!)


Assuming a 30% Discount Rate (Genetech has a 25-30% discount rate in 1990) ... and a PE of 20 in 2018 ... it would
translated in a ONVO .... FV ... of ... 400m USD!


Since ONVO's got ... aobut 90m shares outstanding! ..


The implied valuation by the CEO's comments .. (optimistic) ... is $4.48 ... ONVO is still 50% Overvalued!!

UNEMON1
CEO estimates the Addressable Market to be $500m by 2018l. Assuming an optimistic 40% penetration rate, ONVO
would be generating $200m in revenue by 2018.


Mature (non-start-up) biotech companies have on average a Ebit Margin of 35% and an EBIT multiple of 19.66.


This would translate into a ONVO Market Cap of about $1.40b by 2018!


A common discount factor applied to initial stage Bio-Companies (ONVO belongs to that category) ... is approx 25-
30%  
http://bit.ly/17M4Rf2


The discount rate applied to genetech in the 90's was approx 20-29%


Since 5 years from now ONVO could be valued at $1.40b ... it's present value is no more than $377m - $450m


= 4.18-5.10 USD per share! ... ONVO is currently 50% overvalued ... eve when the Pimping Estimates issued by the
Company are applied! ...


Probably ... ONVO ... in not worth more than $2 per share!


20 Nov 2013, 03:05 PM

Good points, I was going to ask how many companies have a market cap larger than an optimistic estimation of how
big their total addressable market will be in 5 years.

Just as for the Greeks, The Titans of Wall Street have also seemed to have met a very harsh reality. Long, and short.


Organovo, is not just another Corporation, dude. Like humans, each human has its own fingerprint. They are all
slightly different. You mentioned Organovo's small institutional ownership of a mere 7%....But ...Did you ever bother to
dig into the reason for it?


Why did it have such a small amount of Big shots owning it when it up listed?......hhhmmm?


You are barely old enough to shave....I shall let you ponder.


Next.....What becomes of a Company after being THE most active stock on the NYSE for 2 weeks straight?


You think all those shares were traded by "Joe the barber", down the street?.....Again, Ill let you ponder.


Since this is a now absolute zero company...with absolute zero expectations, what happens to share price when news
of any kind what so ever hits the stand?


Again.....Many thanks for increasing the Short Interest dude.


21 Nov 2013, 12:19 PM


Mukticat
No, it was you who raised the short interest by bidding this up to 13.50. I can assure the ONVO short interest
has gone waaay back down since it's subsequent collapse.

It's my understanding that ONVO is being pushed by several stock letters. As long as the price hits a high
target, say $13, and doesn't necessarily have to stay up, then pushers can claim "HUGE percentages never
seen before" & "buy in now for the next HUGE pick!!!!" then they accomplish their goal.  
Of course this comes at the expense of you, the momo's who haven't quit lerned the "curve" of promo letters. 
And just to note; I was long onvo, love onvo, but to buy in above $5 @ this point in time with catalysts this far
out is mind boggeling.

Just listened to the webcast (ie- 'Retail Investor Conf'). They ran ONVO up in anticipation of the new rubes
who they hoped would buy the shares off them (I joined in the selling :-))


I'll hand it to Keith; he's a one-man hype machine. It all sounds like the most amazing thing since the
discovery of penicillin until you remember that anything with even a smidgen the size promise he makes
would have Big Pharma knocking down the doors trying to get in. And of course many competitors would
come along since with their huge <sarcasm> R&D budget of $6M a year is no barrier for a Big Pharma
company (Pfizer's budget alone is $7 BILLION a year, or 1,125 ONVO's) to create their own bioprinted
materials.


05 Dec 2013, 01:22 PM


Jpokergman
I don't care if its Organovo, or ABC, Twigget's from outer space.


When I am pointing out an idea that so many shares are being traded by relatively small investors, it is an
EXTREMELY rare event.


It is even made more rare should the Company find success.


When "Little guys" are ahead of big guys in terms of percentage ownership, then the Dollar value, is totally
irrelevant. Due to the fact that the Institutions will "Pony-up" whatever the asking price is.....Because it ain't
their fracking money dude.


So...."IF", you really love ONVO, as you proclaim....which I seriously doubt. You are sitting on a gold mine.


Personally, I think you are either short, or you are a Mutual Fund Hack, trying to get schmucks to unload their
shares.


05 Dec 2013, 03:25 PM


Mukticat
You make an excellent point- when you see a 'cutting-edge, disruptive, blah,blah,blah' stock and the smart
money is steering clear while the company deliberately tries to rope in the retail crowd it would be a very rare
event indeed if the dumb money was really onto something.


Nine times out of ten it's just a scam to enrich the insiders.


05 Dec 2013, 04:19 PM


Greenfire87
j poker, 
Trading on emotion I see. Not so good for the bottom line.  
Just to note, you should address who you are talking to for clarity.


Gold mine WAS right. It's now in my pocket, thank you!


I'd buy it again, when the price becomes reasonable, say $4.0  
Maybe more if catalysts justify it.

False fact: the author states that he spoke with the analyst at Zacks and quotes him as saying he dropped the

Who to believe?


Bent fact: the paragraphs on insider trading, while correct with the selling of shares by management other than the
timed filings, neglects to inform the reader of the 10b5-1 trading plan. This was filed with the SEC on 10/10. 
What to believe?

Regarding the Insider Sales did you notice that they always file the notification with the SEC on a Friday
afternoon? How coincidental. 
Any chink in the story they're selling and they want to bury it on a Friday afternoon, the graveyard of bad

This company relies on stoking the enthusiasm of retail buyers to maintain a stock price far ahead of its
fundamentals. You think Keith Murphy wasn't pinching himself for his astounding good luck getting $9.64 for
100,000 shares??


(well his utter happiness might have been just slightly tempered by Eric David, his Chief Strategy Officer,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1848361-a-very-detailed-look-at-organovo 85/106


Published Aug 16, 2013


'Important key customers of InSphero AG, market leader in the area of three dimensional cell culture models
for pharmaceutical research, presented the advantages of InSphero’s 3D-InSight-Micro tissues at
international congresses. The 3D-micro tissues developed by InSphero build up human organs true to original
in a miniaturized scale, enabling the improvement of predictability of in vitro tests analyzing new drug
compounds.


Recently, the leading US pharma company Pfizer could show that the InSphero 3D-InSight liver tissues,
which contain all important cell types of the human liver, delivered unmatched results in studies investigating
the effects of liver toxic substances. These positive results were presented at the world’s most renowned
toxicology congress (Annual SOT Meeting, San Antonio).'


 
Now we understand Pfizer's absence since receiving ONVO's liver assays a year ago. They've been out
dating Insphero, lol. Then we see that it's not just Pfizer. Apparently Roche and the 'top-10 pharma
companies' have also been going out with Insphero.


 
'Further positive results were presented by Roche at the annual congress of the American Association of
Cancer Research in Washington DC. The organotypical structure of InSphero’s 3D-micro tissues for the first
time allowed reconstructing the mechanism of action of a complex antibody-based cancer drug . . .


.... In the meantime InSphero is working together with all top-10 pharma companies and will for certain be
able to present further exciting results within the next months”, states Dr. Jan Lichtenberg, CEO and
Cofounder of InSphero.'


 
Apparently their 3D cell models work well for cancer research. And their CEO - who isn't just trying to pump
the share price up for his own personal stock sales - sounds pretty damn optimistic that their product is really
going places. Then it gets the imprimatur of Nature-


 
'Accordingly it is not surprising that Nature – one of the world’s most prestigious scientific journals – has
recently published an extensive report about InSphero and the successful introduction of the 3D technology
into the pharmaceutical industry.'


 
What seems a bit odd is that among all the different and novel ways described for producing better in vitro
tissue cultures Insphero gets a lot of attention and ONVO none at all. Here's the link-


http://bit.ly/1i1CRYo


 
What seems shocking is that ONVO managed to somehow 'forget' to include Insphero in their 10-K list of
competitors. Lawyers will be taking note.

onvo opened today at 8.1300 and had a high of 9.7200 and a low of 8.1300 and closed at 8.600 and after market

and volume seems strange... anyone have any idea as to the volume trend ?


21 Nov 2013, 08:07 PM


dcmorris
Mr. Napodano's analysis of valuation has nothing to do with Organovo saying they elected to end the relationship.
The author used a wrong fact(according to Organovo) to further justify the paragraph, and you quoting him and Jane
is just as misleading. This is the crux of what's wrong with these articles. How does one debate someone that is
willing to use false information and then have you swarm every comment confusing the truth? Here's a direct question
for you Muk, do you and Pearson communicate to each other?


What does the day they file the required Form 4 have to do with leaving out of the article that this selling is a
prearranged, board and shareholder approved employee trading plan that was disclosed over 6 weeks ago? Did Dick
not know of this SEC filing? Makes me wonder his overall ability to present facts if he couldn't find this, and this is not
the first time I question that ability, unless this was exactly the intent...


I cannot comment on the CEO pinching himself like a little school boy around the water cooler.


21 Nov 2013, 09:51 PM


Mukticat
If they dropped Zacks then obviously it was because they couldn't get Napodano to play ball and overvalue
the company for them. Since unlike a Roth or Cowen or an Oppenheimer Zacks doesn't do equity raises they
have no reason to play patsy to management to get those lucrative equity underwriting deals. Just another
scummy play since clearly he'd outlived his usefulness to them.


Frankly it would have looked better if Zacks had ONVO rather than visa versa.


But what do you think about the one objective analyst out there who got an inside look into the company
pegging a '3 to 4' valuation on them? I think that's more relevant than who dropped who.


22 Nov 2013, 01:24 AM


Mukticat
Their habit of burying bad news on a Friday is more relevant than the fact that they have a plan for cashing in
their stock. It shows a disregard for ethics.

Now we can have an actual debate.

thesahibzada
the short sale restriction was placed on the stock about 15 minutes prior to after market closing lol... i wonder why


21 Nov 2013, 11:35 PM

Just read the press release. Some strange phrases in there: Liver model is "three dimensional in size, shape, and
substance"--does anyone KNOW what it means to be 3-D in substance or 3-D in size?


They say Zack's stopped covering the stock on Sept 13 at Organovo's request. Zack's valued the company in the
mid-5s I think.

platonic: It's possible that ONVO hired Napodano to write the article. This type of engagement is typical for an
emerging company. In fact, when you read an SA article that is all puff and rah-rah, chances are the author
was paid for his work. Most companies hire an investor relations consultant to actually recruit the writer. I've
been approached on a number of occasions to do this for sparsely-covered firms.

I am really hating blogs currently since they have just create markets for these people who missed out. Just like VJET
and Cintron then Cintron getting hammered by a Citi Bank report. I do not get it. I am glad I sold Monday and now I
am buying even more since everyone jumped cause of these bloggers and how they skew facts to create a down turn
in their favor.

While you ponder...


In your discussions on significant competitors you consistently use the term 3D bio printing to describe the products
that are available to the market, and thus relate your discussion to the assumed fact that all bio tissues of this nature

are the same product without distinction. My understanding is that these distinctions are what separate products and
the market potential.


http://bit.ly/1ceGQea


http://bit.ly/1ceGQeb


IMO, the hanging drop micro tissue used by InSphero(to a certain extent all the other listed competitors), while
certainly 3D in their structures, are not 'printed'. This is the distinction that separates Organovo from the 'competitors',
and the reason they have been granted(discuss this separately) world wide patents due to this novelty. One could
also find distinction with the use of scaffolding in the creation of the constructs.


Do you not feel that these scientific distinctions should at least be mentioned in the discussion?


23 Nov 2013, 04:59 PM


Mukticat
The scientific abstract cited in your link describes the current state of 3D liver assays. They've been on the
market for years. This is something that almost no one knew until Pearson wrote his article. At best what
ONVO might bring to market is an incremental improvement over current assays but certainly nothing that is
'revolutionary' or 'disruptive'. The market for these products is small; a few million dollars in sales a year and
ONVO is going to have to compete with them for a piece of that. They might be able to charge a bit more if
their product is better; something we have no proof of yet, but it's not going to be like some blockbuster drug
that greatly improves on the existing protocols.


This would explain why institutional biotech investors have not gotten swept up in the ONVO craze. This sort
of information about the limits of the 3D liver assay market would have been widely available to them.


http://bit.ly/1g9QvVY


'Developed to overcome the limitations of conventional 
2D culture, multi-cell type 3D liver microtissues resemble 
liver-like cell composition and an extended stability in 
culture. The long-term viability and functionality of liver 
microtissues allows for routine compound testing as well as 
chronic and inflammation-mediated toxicity. The 96-well 
format allows for microtissue mass production enabling the 
implementation of an organotypic liver model at an early 
time point in drug development.'


btw- the complexity of the science involved points up the ridiculousness of retail investors trying to assess the
value of a company like this and its product. It's better to watch what the pros are doing . . . or not doing.

Good question. No one knows. Maybe their particular 3D liver assay is better than the existing ones but since
they've never been tested side by side we have no idea. What we do know is that Pfizer and United
Therapeutics both tested it out and haven't come back.


25 Nov 2013, 01:42 PM


dcmorris
Good question, Organovo knows 
The value comes from the precision science of printing your own cells into formed and functionable tissue...its
not dropped into place by gravity.  
The true value then comes from the enabling science. 
As Mr cat puts it, the complexity of the science involved is real, so I start here.


http://bit.ly/1evX2db


There will be more tech produced products, the liver assay is just the first to be commercialized. We don't talk
around here about the lung fibrosis or cancer models that are being studied as well as the skin implications.


26 Nov 2013, 01:22 AM


Mukticat
'Organovo knows'? All you need is a company's website to get at the truth of the matter? Whatever, but even
in that link there's nothing that suggests or says ONVO's 3D technique produces better results over existing
3D liver assays.


What I find a bit peculiar is how Big Pharma seems not to have noticed what a 'disruptive quantum leap into
the future' ONVO has on its hands. You would think with such a blockbuster they might want to partner with,
or fund ONVO, a bit more than a $1.15M run-rate spread out over the last 18 months. But I suppose if you're
running a lab that's going to revolutionize medicine $6M a year in R&D ought to do it.


26 Nov 2013, 03:38 AM


Mukticat
I don't want to be accused of pumping ONVO with inflated numbers so to be fair I should explain that most of
that '$1.15M run-rate spread out over the last 18 months' occurred in 2012.


For the first six months of 2013 collaboration revenues have totaled $129,000. With a little luck they could hit
a quarter million for the year.

Some people like a cat are not visionaries. They only know how to latch on to others and make money be fear
mongering.


Unlike them, ONVO is a visionary company, and knows how to create more and more useful products, from a
single, but amazing innovation, that some claim has a very limited application.


I invite visionary investors, to share in their success, and not get sidetracked by these negative elements of
society.


07 Dec 2013, 09:14 AM


dcmorris
This is just me criticizing what I feel was the most important information the article skimmed over:


"The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is leading the $24-million effort funded by the Space and Naval
Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), on behalf of Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)."


"And then of course there is New Jersey based Hurel Corp. which develops and commercializes similar 3D bio printed
products."


"It [Hurel] has raised $9.2 million in a Series A round for its lead product - a technology that replicates the human liver,
using living cells, and referred to as organ-on-a-chip or human-on-a-chip."


The 'body on a chip' program that is being funded internationally is a natural progression as the science from all the
different R&D sources is more fully understood. This will be something we will see by 2017/18 and will be an
awesome advancement. All should put this near the top of future DD. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.


Then this: 
"Hopefully this also sounds very familiar to investors in Organovo, because this is in line with what Organovo hopes to
launch in 13 months or so."


Please expand on how this 2 year old research project is connected to Organovo's 'hopes to launch' liver assay in
2014?

'Please expand on how this 2 year old research project is connected to Organovo's 'hopes to launch' liver
assay in 2014?'


Simple enough - it points out that there are better funded and sponsored avenues toward a radical future in
biomedicine than Organovo. If they can create a 'body-on-a-chip' model the options for testing a drug on a
variety of different tissues greatly expands. Why settle for just a liver assay if it were possibly to test heart
tissue, kidney, and other organs as well?


THAT would actually be 'revolutionary' and 'disruptive' as opposed to ONVO's 'incremental' improvement - if
that's what it is - in 3D liver assay technology.


24 Nov 2013, 08:28 PM


dcmorris
We have discussed this before, but i'll bring it up again.


"Organovo has just 7% institutional holdings - 93% of the stock is held in retail hands."


This statement and subsequent discussion is based on incorrect and omitted facts. First of all, the institutional
ownership amount is 7.99%.


http://bit.ly/HRTabx


And second, this has a reporting date of 11/15 as of end of quarter date 9/30 per SEC filing requirement of Form 13F.


http://bit.ly/1fAhgFR


So from this Organovo has acquired near 8% institutional ownership in the first 2.5 months since their up listing to the
NYSE. A lot are indices funds, but not all. Great start IMO. You then go on to discuss this level without regard to the
following 2 months and the probability that holders might be accumulating positions during this time, and then
correlate this lack of speculation to things like 'non-catalyst' events such as the advancement of the scientific proof of
concept 40 day functionality of the tissue.


Do you not feel that this information would be prudent to add to the discussion on institutional holdings?


24 Nov 2013, 12:15 PM


dcmorris
Let's talk about that non-catalyst event.


Looking at the chart 
http://yhoo.it/1fAhPzm;c=


I see a steady climb since the information was released mid Oct. My research said that this would be material
information that would impact the sp positively once the true meaning was understood by the market. I bought shares
based on this information, and the price moved like I thought. To many positives that were not brought up in the
discussion, 40 day functionality, dose-dependent responses and the most important, 2 month advancement in the
timeline of this accomplishment were never discussed. Only correlation comes from social media publications as the
catalyst?

This company is doing everything in its power to sell itself to the retail crowd. First we have this joke called 'Retail

You too can sign up and attend for free which is quite unusual in itself since most investor conferences make you pay

Now down to 8.75 and still they're selling. Wonder what's up?


27 Nov 2013, 06:14 PM


Mukticat
Now we know . . . ONVO just filed to sell 4,000,000 shares in an ATM offering.


http://1.usa.gov/1aZEEbg


That's a shocker considering they have all the money they need for several years with $53M cash on the
books as of last quarter and spending next to nothing on R&D.


Clearly they see the current stock price as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stock their coffers with cash, lots
of it, and they're not gonna let it slip away.


This also shows that once again they couldn't find an institutional investor to take a stake so they structured
this as an ATM, or At The Market offering. This means that they'll be joining the other sellers on the Ask and
feeding new shares into the retail market. You, the existing shareholders, will have a chance to give them
more money while getting more diluted at the same time.

I'm not sure. A lot of orders are effective for regular hours only. Certainly if people forget to cancel them
they're going to kick in as soon as the market opens on Friday.


ONVO sure delivered a turkey for Thanksgiving.


27 Nov 2013, 06:50 PM


Mukticat
And I would have to surmise that some people were tipped off in advance considering that the stock for no
apparent reason began to drop from the morning onward. There wasn't a market downturn or correction in the
3D stocks so maybe Murphy was taking care of his own?


27 Nov 2013, 06:53 PM


ECapo
But that means that most have sold..do you really think this will tank more Mon..and what will the bottom
support be Mukticat?


28 Nov 2013, 01:50 PM


Mukticat
Capo- where does this idea 'most have sold' come from? Who are we talking about? There's about 77M
shares currently and 61M in the float. All those shares can be traded, probably a high percentage of them are
underwater, and there can and probably will be plenty of sellers.


As for tanking on Monday I don't think it will wait. It started to tank yesterday AH when investors noticed
Organovo filed to sell 4M more shares directly into the market and it should continue to tank when the market
opens a half day tomorrow and investors discover the news ONVO tried to bury Weds afternoon.


As for where's the bottom?


There's an old adage that 'in the shortterm stocks are a voting machine', ie- investors decide, or vote, on what
they think it's worth, 'but in the longterm they're a weighing machine', meaning that it is the weight of earnings
that will ultimately determine its real worth.


If you consider that the market for 3D liver assays is quite small, and there's other competition for that market,
and that there will probably be new entrants into these markets since that's the nature of business, the
chances of ONVO earning a profit ever become quite slim. And if that's the case then the value of ONVO
becomes a function of their book value. Book value would include cash and other assets. Patents depreciate
since they lose time value and considering ONVO paid less than $100K for all their patents there's not much
value there. So in the end this stock could be worth less than a dollar assuming they don't blow all their
money.

BTW....The color of the paint is $reen.

Mukticat, you're short on ONVO, it's obvious. But at what point, if at all, would you get back in it stock at the end of
this "downfall"..???Thank you!

That may have been me. I requested that a lot of comments here be deleted because they went against the rules.
Many commenters were alleging bad faith on the part of other commenters, making a blanket dismissal of others'
comments, making personal attacks, etc etc etc. None of this is allowed, and I reported many of those comments as
abusive. I don't know if I requested that your comments in particular be deleted. Based on the tone of some of your
remarks, however, it is very likely that I did. If you yourself find that your time is being wasted by comments that don't
comply with the rules, I suggest that you too report them as abusive.


As a paying subscriber (not just a registered user), I wish SA would delete many more comments than it actually
does.

It's been suggested that investors would benefit from a table of Insider Trading in ONVO. It's not easy to format for SA
since there's no way to preview a post so please excuse me if the columns don't exactly line up.


Here's all the latest insider activity for 2013. Mind you . . . THESE ALL ARE SALES (Date, Seller, Qty, Price, Total) -


11/13/13 Murphy Keith . . . . . -100,000 . . . $9.64 . . . $963,830  
11/13/13 David Eric . . . . . . -16,470 . . . $10.39 . . . $171,105  
10/18/13 Murphy Keith . . . . . -30,000 . . . $6.63 . . . $198,990  
10/16/13 Murphy Keith . . . . . -70,000 . . . $5.76 . . . $403,046  
10/10/13 David Eric . . . . . -3,530 . . . $5.66 . . . $ 19,995  
10/7/13 David Eric . . . . . -63,000 . . . $5.86 . . . $368,953  
10/2/13 Presnell Sharon . . . . . -75,000 . . . $5.64 . . . $423,225  
8/12/13 Presnell Sharon . . . . . -75,000 . . . $5.60 . . . $420,068


Keith Murphy is the CEO, President and Chairman of ONVO


Eric David is the Chief Strategy Officer


Sharon Presnell is the Executive Vice President


*******************


Keith gets to make nearly $1,000,000 a month selling (you) stock. It's a shame the company only averaged $8,350 a
month in sales but for Keith it's really not a bad business model ;-)


He's just required to go out there every day and promote the stock so he can get top dollar for his remaining
6,301,750 shares. Based on his October sales he's clearly happy to get 5's for his shares . . . so can you imagine if he
can get 9's?!?


You've made him one very happy man.

Time for an update!


You just can't stop the music, err, selling!


Longs take comfort that your ONVO execs are very practical, rational people. They see a golden opportunity
and they ain't gonna let it slip away.


12/16/13 Barry Michaels . . . . . -85,353 . . . . . $9.07 . . . . . $774,152

ECapo, the company always informs the shareholder what they think on all subject matter. This is what they
say and it is what I use as an answer to your question:


"After giving effect to the sale of 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at an assumed offering price of $9.55
per share (the last reported sale price of our common stock on November 26, 2013) and after deducting the
sales agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our as adjusted net tangible book value as
of September 30, 2013 would have been approximately $88.8 million, or $1.10 per share. This represents an
immediate increase in net tangible book value of $0.42 per share to existing stockholders and immediate
dilution in net tangible book value of $8.45 per share to new investors participating in this offering at the
assumed offering price."

You might want to ask yourself why the company is amassing a warchest far in excess of their current needs.
This is, after all, a company that only spends $6M/yr on R&D. $50M wasn't enough that they had to
immediately go raise another $40M??


If a company knows it's on the right track it'll only raise cash as needed since selling too much equity early on
means selling it at lower prices that don't reflect the future value of the company. OTOH if a company can't
wait to push more shares out the door then they realize the current price is a golden opportunity that must not
be wasted!!


And if the only buyers of this new equity are retail while institution won't go near them, then double warning!

SO IS YOUR TAKE ON ONVO THAT IT IS A SHAM???


23 Apr 2014, 12:40 AM


Mukticat
Yes my take is that ONVO is not only a 'sham' but a 'scam' too. With minimal money they succeeded in
reverse mergering a tiny OTC stock into a higher profile AMEX stock, told a great story about themselves and
raised tens of millions of dollars in the process. The money will keep the company alive and paying salaries
and perks and options to the Insiders for years to come. They've already awarded themselves so much stock
that the CEO is able to sell 100,000 shares a MONTH like it was nothing. He's already made $45,000,000 in
the last FIVE MONTHS.


Oh and the company has already raked in $3M in revenue during it's entire existence. That smells kind of
scammy but if you really want to know if ONVO's a scam don't take it from me, take if from Richard Pearson
and Citron and the latest most damning piece by Simeon Research;

There's good news in this; it establishes $1.10 as a probable floor for the stock since that's how much cash is on the
books.

T'would appear the Xmas Tax Selling time of year has arrived.


Consider that a) the RUT smallcap index (the index for low cap stocks like ONVO) is up a whopping 32% ytd, and b)
that over a six-day period in mid-Nov over 100 MILLION SHARES traded hands over TEN DOLLARS.


Every investor who bought and held those shares is losing money on them. Otherwise it was probably a pretty good
year for them considering how much the low-value, high-beta category of stocks went up. Obviously it makes sense to
accelerate any losses into 2013 to offset some of the gains.

This shouldn't be missed-


SA features a 'Positioning for 2014' year-end biotech article of best ideas and they interviewed Jason Napodano for it
today, Dec 31, 2013.


For anyone who doesn't know Jason is a professional analyst with Zacks who focuses on small and microcap
biotechs and was the one and only analyst that followed ONVO until he dropped coverage of them a few months ago.
He had an intimate inside look at the company and was well-situated to have a far better understanding of the
business than any of us.


Here's what he had to say about ONVO in its entirety-


'(SA): You have covered Organovo (ONVO) previously, and 3D printing remains alluring to retail investors. What do
our readers need to know to succeed in this space?


(JN): Avoid it. There's too much hype in the stock and too much risk for this investment to make sense for retail
investors right now. Organovo is a very interesting company with almost science-fiction like technology. Unfortunately,
the valuation is completely ridiculous because of the hype around 3D printing and I don't see how investing in this
name at today's valuation makes sense. Public Enemy said it best in 1988: Don't Believe the Hype'


later he says,


'(SA): Alternatively, what name do you see presenting the greatest risk to investors in the year ahead?

$3 per share. At nearly $10, I just don't see it.'

" Don't Believe the Hype "


Those words have been used so many times about so many stocks.


. How many stock analysts quoted excessively high PE ratios, or price to sales ratios on Apple or Google while their
successful business models, and ultimately, stock price prices rose higher year after year.

The post you are replying to hardly bashes the company. It bashes only the valuation. And it merely quotes a Zacks
analyst. I doubt SA will ever censor posts that quote well-known analysts.

Investors are always rational in their actions, but errant in their assumptions. It is rational to buy something that you
expect to go up but errant to assume that it would double because it did before. It is rational to short ONVO if you
think the stock will go down and that the company has no tangible value at the time being... The errant assumption is
that stock won't eventually have at a minimum a great enough perceived value that will cause you to capitulate before
it gets there, or that there aren't better opportunities elsewhere and better timing.


Just wait. 5 years from now Joe Sixpack will be out to play in the market and he will want to invest in a "story" and the
brokers will be all too happy to pitch one to them... it goes like this:


Joe 6-pack:I just inherited $10M from my baby boomer parents who got rich off of [3d printing stocks] and sold before
the high and want to buy stock in a cool company, have any suggestions? 
Broker:"So you see these 3d printers that have begun to proliferate and become more personalized and
commercialized? Well now they are going to be able to take the same concept and apply it to biolog. They will 3d print
organs. Those same organs will be used by biotech companies (you know companies like [XYZ] which has gone up X
times in X years after discovering a drug that may cure/(reverse the effects) of [X disease]?). Those same organs will
be used by [Intuitive Surgical] so a doctor in California can do surgery in new york to give someone a new kidney
without requiring a donor. If this makes it past the next stage, they will also work on being able to get people with lung
cancer a new set of lungs!


Joe 6-pack: Oh Boy, how much does it go up each year? 
broker: it was once $2 so XYZ thousand percent since the low and XYZ hundred percent a year. 
Joe 6-pack: How many shares will $1M buy right now!? Get me in!


The fundamentals, beyond whether or not the company can survive to the point when the retail investor has excess
disposable income, cash and credit to spend and an appetite for stocks don't matter. The story is as good as it gets,
and the sentiment is already bad and the shorts have already tried to take the stock down to zero when it was a $2 or
$5 stock. I understand it has only $15M in cash and negative earnings and a rich valuation. But I'm betting the reward
if it can manage to raise money long enough until the retail investor returns to the market is going to be so enormous
you won't believe it... NEVERMIND the biotech boom, the demand in the future for bioprinted material, and the

At less than 8% ONVO has one of the lowest Institutional Ownerships seen for a supposedly billion dollar biotech
company. Nonetheless one would expect that if ONVO were truly on a successful launch path that biotech investors
and institutions would begin to gravitate toward the stock. Yesterday, however, we found out the opposite- that
Institutional Ownership is SHRINKING, not growing!!!


American Financial Group was the second largest holder of ONVO shares and yesterday they reported that they had
sold 2,750,000 shares of ONVO nearly liquidating their entire position.


Here's the original SC-13 dated January 1, 2013 wherein AFG reported owning 3,000,000 shares of ONVO.


http://1.usa.gov/M9D8M1


Here's yesterday's February 10, 2014 amended SC-13 wherein AFG discloses that they only have 250,000 shares left
(meaning they sold 2,750,000 shares).


http://1.usa.gov/M9DamY


****************


ONVO is left pitching itself to the least informed investors out there since anyone in the biotech business can see just
how massively overvalued the stock is and won't touch it.


11 Feb 2014, 05:54 PM


hhess13892
"Some" people who comment on ONVO are obviously short. They feel they post "substantial information"
which is really incomplete information. Example,such as when they point out the sales of Keith Murphy. They
know full well these are pre-planned sales under Rule 10b5-1 and tout there will more sales while omitting
that fact.


These same people place a negative spin on ANY positive posting about ONVO.


12 Feb 2014, 02:53 PM


Mukticat
So you admit that the ONVO Insiders are selling millions of dollars worth of stock a month and you now know
that the main institutional investor - American Financial Group - has liquidated 95% of their holdings.


You sure make a great argument for ONVO, lol.

I have NEVER denied the selling. There you go twisting info again. Only responded to your partial information

As ECapo stated above ONVO is a speculative company and all of us know this..


You just can't see the potential as a short and will continue to beat the drum as you have for your last I'm
guessing several hundred negative postings about ONVO.


I have pocketed 50k from this since 11/2012 and still hold a few thousand shares. So "lol" all you want my

Mukticat again...if you are anyone does not like or believe in ONVO do not invest in it...I again state "INVEST" 
your information is repetitive and not necessarily relevant to this company a lot of the time and does not
include supporting analysis....I see from your posted bio you state you are: 
"Professional full-time trader (since 1999) specializing in both long and short opportunities." 
from writing negative comments on ONVO for over a year I may assume you are and have been short ONVO
and you want to make more money shorting....But I am not a professional as you....I am only an average Joe.
I am interested in unbiased information. For full disclosure...I do not gamble by shorting or betting stocks will
go down. I do not and never have and never will.  
Concerning this stock as an investor, I believe ONVO is a Bio company using 3D technology..and a leader in
this field with great potential. As an investor....at this time I believe in ONVO.
