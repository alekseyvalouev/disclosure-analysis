Plug Power: Unprofitable Past, Poor Fundamentals, And A Best-Case
DCF Value Of $2-$2.50/Share
Apr. 2, 2014 11:00 AM ET274 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


At $7.54/share, 17.7x 2014 revenue, and a market capitalization of $1.2 billion, we
believe Plug Power is highly overvalued.


PLUG has never been profitable, operates a business with low barriers to entry, and
competes in an unproven sector, all while shareholders have suffered extreme
dilution.


Since 2006, the company has burned through $320 million. Over the same period,
PLUG managed to raise over $316 million through secondary common and
preferred issuances.


Introduction


It's been a sensational year for investors in Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), with shares
rising from pennies to more than $10. But now, it appears the party has ended, as
investors are starting to cut through the promotional hype that has enveloped the
company to rediscover the business's less than promising fundamental outlook. We
expect shares to continue declining sharply in coming weeks. In particular, it's hard to
imagine a company that no one wanted to buy at 15 cents a share last year is now worth
$7.50. Plug Power, contrary to the bullish hype, faces severe competition, has a weak and
unproven business model, and likely lacks in the research capability to innovate its way
out of its current precarious financial situation.


At $7.54/share, 17.7x 2014 revenue, and a market capitalization of $1.2 billion, we believe
Plug Power is flagrantly overvalued. PLUG's dramatic share price surge has fueled
speculation from investors who seem to know little about Plug Power's history and
operating background.


We explored what a best-case scenario would yield for equity investors. Using a 10-year
DCF, we believe that PLUG is worth less than $2.50/share, well below the current price of
$7.54. Even under the highly optimistic assumption that PLUG achieves its $70m revenue
target in 2014, quadruples its sales over an eight-year period, and achieves a long-term

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2122093-plug-power-unprofitable-past-poor-fundamentals-and-a-best-case-dcf-value-of-2-2_50-share 2/67


gross profit target of 32%, shares would be 68% overvalued. Even worse, in the much
more likely scenario that PLUG disappoints investors and misses its long-term guidance
targets, PLUG shares are worth a fraction of that target.


After the February announcement of its 1,738 unit Wal-Mart deal, PLUG's shares nearly
doubled on investors becoming entranced with a growth story. However, a single order is
not an indication of sustained growth, especially in the context of PLUG's existing
customer list. And even though most of these customers have been with the company
since 2008-2010, none have adopted PLUG's solution on a substantial scale. For
example, the Wal-Mart order represents just 5% of its entire fleet. Third-party research
further suggests that PLUG's lack of customer penetration is due to the expense of fuel
cells relative to battery - fuel cells are only economically viable for a small subset of
distribution centers: those with space constraints, round-the-clock shifts, and expensive
workforces. Facilities that lack these difficulties will continue to prefer lower-cost options.


Evidence strongly suggests that fuel cells will remain a niche solution in the warehouse.
According to General Electric's chief engineering officer of its Power Conversion division,
fuel cell technology is too dependent on platinum to be more than a niche product. But
should fuel cell technology ever reach cost parity with batteries, the economic benefits will
largely accrue to Ballard Power (NASDAQ:BLDP) and other owners of the underlying fuel
cell technology. After all, Plug Power is merely a value-added integrator of Ballard's fuel
cells, and no more. If Honda or Toyota decided to produce fuel cell powered forklifts
tomorrow, these better capitalized competitors could probably produce a more
sophisticated fuel stack, undercut PLUG on price, and aggressively take market share. In
fact, Toyota has already developed a prototype for its line of fuel cell forklifts with plans to
produce a commercial line "in the near future." With a threat as imposing as Toyota
looming, investors should be skeptical of PLUG's long-term growth projections.


The recent surge in the stock price has been driven by speculative investors hoping to
make a quick profit, as indicated by the past 1-month average daily trading volume of 89.5
million (CapitalIQ), representing 62% of PLUG's 144 million basic shares outstanding
(latest 10-K, 10-Q). On March 7th, 2014 CEO Andrew Marsh appeared on CNBC and
presented no new information, yet the stock closed 30% higher. Three days later, the
stock surged another 25% despite the absence of new updates. We believe that as this
speculative momentum ends, investors will look to lock in short-term gains and move on,
making PLUG an extremely compelling short opportunity at its current price of 18x 2014E
revenue.

5/23/2018 Plug Power: Unprofitable Past, Poor Fundamentals, And A Best-Case DCF Value Of $2-$2.50/Share - Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG…

PLUG's stock price has multiplied by 44x in the past year based on statements made by
CEO Andy Marsh. At its current valuation of $7.54 per share, investors are no longer
adequately compensated for bearing PLUG's many execution risks. Shareholders have
ignored downside risk on the notion that the company has already transformed its
industry, but PLUG has yet to deliver on any of its promises.


PLUG's current share price of $7.54 implies LTM and 2014E revenue multiples of 43x and
18x, respectively. To put this into perspective, PLUG's current market capitalization is
higher than the sum of the market capitalizations of Ballard Power (PLUG's critical
supplier of fuel cell stacks) and Hydrogenics Corporation (competing manufacturer of
hydrogen equipment and fuel cell-based backup power systems), despite expecting to
generate less than half of their combined revenues. Even more astounding, PLUG's
forward sales multiple of 18x exceeds that of even Tesla and Facebook, more
innovative companies that have already demonstrated above-market growth. Elon Musk
himself had a colorful opinion of the technology: "Fuel cells are so bullsh*t."

PLUG is no Innovator -- It's Merely an Integrator of Third-Party Technology


Despite PLUG's claims to be an innovative manufacturer, our research suggests that
PLUG is actually a value-added integrator. Crucially, PLUG does not manufacture critical
components of the GenDrive system. This includes the all-important fuel cell stacks that
PLUG sources exclusively from Ballard Power Systems. From PLUG's 2012 10-K:


"Although most components essential to our business are generally available from
multiple sources, we currently obtain certain key components including, but not
limited to, fuel cell stack materials, energy storage devices, and other major
components from single or limited sources. In 2010, we signed a supply
agreement with Ballard Power Systems, or Ballard, which continues through
December 31, 2014. Under this agreement, Ballard serves as the exclusive
supplier of fuel cell stacks for Plug Power's GenDrive product line for North
America and select European countries."


While investors expect PLUG to eventually achieve significant revenue growth via mass
customer adoption, we'd argue that PLUG's economics will largely pass to Ballard Power.
After all, an integrator of parts is far more commoditized, and far more expendable, than a
technology innovator.


If PLUG were truly a pioneer in the fuel cell industry, we would expect it to expend
significant resources on research & development. Comparatively, fuel cell companies like
Ballard, which focus on developing fuel cell stacks and systems for automobile OEMs and



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1093691/000100329713000101/esplugpower10k1.htm

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2122093-plug-power-unprofitable-past-poor-fundamentals-and-a-best-case-dcf-value-of-2-2_50-share 5/67


system integrators, spend significantly more on R&D. Since 2009, Ballard has spent more
than 2.6x on R&D than PLUG, which makes sense given PLUG's inferior placement in the
value chain.


Given PLUG's dependence on Ballard as its sole supplier of fuel cell stacks, shareholders
should be aware that Ballard, like PLUG, has never been profitable. In the event that
Ballard faces a liquidity crisis or is unable to deliver fuel cell stacks, PLUG would certainly
face adversity. Though PLUG announced its intention to seek alternative suppliers, there
have been no updates regarding that process.


Driving the Hype Machine: A Catalogue of PLUG's Failed Promises


Since taking over as CEO, Marsh has had a history of missing projections for revenue,
unit shipments and gross margins. PLUG significantly underperformed against Marsh's
forecasts for the FY periods of 2010, 2011 and 2012.


2010 Guidance (03/15/2010): Andrew Marsh on Q4 2009 Earnings Call:


"First, Power Plug will dramatically increase unit shipments for the year, shipping
between 2,100 and 2,300 systems, consisting of at least 1,100 GenDrive and 1,000
GenSys fuel cells. Second, consistent with these shipments for the year, Plug Power
will generate between mid-$40 million and low-$50 million in revenue. Third, Plug
Power will achieve a gross margin percentage in the mid-teens. Fourth, Plug Power
will set its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization in non-cash
stock or equity compensation targeted at mid-$20 million loss for the year."

2011 Guidance (05/25/2011): Andrew Marsh on Q1 2011 Earnings Call:


Coming into this year, we plan to ship between 1,600 and 2,300 units. We have the
biggest backlog we've ever had. The revenue for the business continues to grow,
indicated by the fact that in the last 4.5 months, the company has booked over $18
million of business, and that $18 million of business represents 555 unit orders
received in the first quarter alone."


We'd like to point out that Marsh made the forecast on May 25, 2011, almost halfway
through the year, yet only shipped 1,024 units, significantly underperforming his forecast.


2012 Guidance (03/08/2012): Andrew Marsh on Q4 2011 Earnings Call:


Plug Power is setting our 2012 shipment expectations at 2,300 systems and we
expect product and service revenue to be approximately $40 million. At the moment,
we have $36 million in backlog, of which $27 million is expected to ship in 2012.


2012 Guidance (06/07/2012): Company Presentation


Again, it's critical to know that the presentation was on June 7, 2012, almost halfway
through the year, yet PLUG missed its 2012 forecast for units shipped and revenue by
40% and 35%, respectively. This type of underperformance is inexplicable were it not for
PLUG's need to generate support for its perpetual dilutive secondary offerings.


For 2014, Marsh has forecasted 3,000 units, revenue of $70 million, gross margin of 25%
and EBITDA margin of 5%.

2014 Guidance (01/16/2014): Andrew Marsh on Business Update Call:


"I'd like to now reiterate our goals for the entire year. Plug Power will ship over 3,000
units to 20 manufacturing and distribution centers. We'll achieve $70 million in
revenue and 25% gross margin and 5% EBITDAS."


While Wal-Mart's recent order is certainly positive news for PLUG, we question PLUG's
ability to forecast given the company's poor track record. The Wal-Mart order was for a
total of 1,738 units, set to be delivered over a two-year period. If we assume that PLUG
can deliver half of the order, or 869 units, it would still need to deliver an additional 2,131
units to meet the 2014 forecast. To put that into context, a delivery of 2,131 units would be
53% higher than what PLUG shipped in 2012. If past performance is indicative of 2014
performance, PLUG could again miss its 2014 unit guidance by 30-50%, making its
already extreme forward revenue multiple even more untenable.


PLUG Remains a Niche Solution that has Gained Minimal Customer Penetration


According to 2013 Fuel Cell 2000 report, PLUG was already the market leader in the fuel
cell material handling industry with around 85% market share, and yet the business
generated only $26 million of revenue. Fuel Cell 2000's report includes a list of companies
currently utilizing fuel cell systems for its forklifts. As shown below, PLUG competes with a
variety of alternate competitors, including Oorja, Hydrogenics, and even Ballard itself.

Viewing PLUG's competitors above, Hydrogenics (NASDAQ:HYGS) stands out.
Hydrogenics is a publicly-listed manufacturer of hydrogen-based fuel cell products. This
Canadian company has strategic investors that include Commscope, Enbridge, and
General Motors, the latter of which owns 5% of the business. In addition to forklift
deployments, Hydrogenics sells hydrogen fueling stations, backup power systems, and
power-systems for transit buses. Customers include General Motor, Michelin, and the U.S.
government. Hydrogenics generated $42m of revenue in 2013, more than 50% higher
than PLUG, and yet trades with a market capitalization that is one-third that of PLUG's.


Oorja, a private California-based business, has nearly a dozen fuel cell customers that
include Nissan, U.S. Foodservice, and Baldor Specialty Foods. Oorja uses methanol-
based recharging system to keep on-board lead-acid batteries fully charged, eliminating

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2122093-plug-power-unprofitable-past-poor-fundamentals-and-a-best-case-dcf-value-of-2-2_50-share 9/67


the need for battery swapping. Refueling the liquid-based system takes less than one
minute, thereby improving productivity for the busiest distribution centers. Oorja had
shipped over 400 units as of Q4 2011.


While PLUG certainly has a robust customer list, we ask ourselves why none of these
customers utilize PLUG's products on a larger scale. PLUG argues about the compelling
benefits of utilizing a fuel cell based solution; however, the low levels of customer
penetration raise serious suspicion.


Sysco, one of PLUG's largest customers, operates over 100 distribution centers and has a
fleet of over 11,000 forklifts. PLUG first deployed its solution with Sysco in 2010 and yet
has managed to deliver only 763 units (as of 2012 report), representing a penetration rate
of 7%. Kroger, another marquee client, has been a customer since 2011 and has only 161
forklifts with PLUG's solution. Coca-Cola, also a customer since 2011, has only 96.
Although the market appreciated Wal-Mart's recent order of 1,738 units (which is to be
delivered over a two-year period), the order represents only 5% of Wal-Mart's total fleet
which is surprising considering Wal-Mart's status as a PLUG customer since 2005.


We believe that PLUG's lack of customer penetration can be explained easily: fuel cell
forklifts are only economically viable for space-constrained facilities that demand round-
the-clock shifts. According to a study by Colorado State University, "...fuel cell forklifts
were considered most commercially viable at materials handling facilities that had
extraordinary costs of facility space, labor and electricity. These outlier facilities might
be physically unable to expand a battery room with increasing workload, located in
geographic areas with high prevailing wages, and which are subject to high electricity
peak demand prices."


In most other cases, fuel-cell based solutions simply cannot compete with existing battery
technologies from a cost perspective. The Colorado State report goes on to argue that
there are few scenarios in which fuel cell powered forklifts had an economic advantage.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2122093-plug-power-unprofitable-past-poor-fundamentals-and-a-best-case-dcf-value-of-2-2_50-share 10/67


"Analysis of the project NPC and project NPC per unit of workload shows that fuel
cell forklifts cannot compete with battery technologies on an economic basis
for the workloads and facility types considered."


However, the researchers did note the following:


"The fuel cell powered forklifts are the most scalable forklift system. Charging is
eliminated and refueling takes only ~5 min at a hydrogen filling station. Fuel cell
forklifts have no thermal management problems at the workloads considered for this
study. For workloads under 3 EBUs, the fuel cell forklifts are assumed to require no
additional floor space and no duplicated vehicles or powerplants."


These facts lead us to believe that PLUG is a niche solution for a small subset of
warehouse facilities that operate on three shifts in large, 24-hour distribution centers. This
helps explain PLUG's lack of organic growth and reminds us that PLUG may already have
largely penetrated its addressable market. For the vast majority of distribution centers, fuel
cells are simply not the correct solution.


An Unlikely Best Case Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Implies a Share Price Near
$2.50


Our DCF analysis is based on a scenario where all the stars align for PLUG. But even
under these generous assumptions, we arrive at a share value of $2.44, 68% below where
the stock closed on Tuesday. This valuation implies a much more reasonable 4.7x 2014E

revenue multiple, far below the current 17.7x multiple. We challenge PLUG's proponents
to construct their own fundamental models; only then might they realize how absurdly
overvalued this equity has become.


DCF Assumptions:


2014 financials per management guidance
26% revenue growth in 2015-2017, 21% from 2018-2019, and 16% from 2020-2021

estimate of $70 million and 3,000 shipped units in 2014) growing at 5% per year
Gross profit margins of 25% in 2014 expanding to 32% by 2021. Marsh stated on a
business update call on 12/04/2013 that overall gross margins should be 32%-33%, "I
expect that our margins will settle down in the 32% to 33% range. And that when I look
at gross margins, and when I look at the service business, the labor portion of it is little
less than lower gross margins than the parts business. So overall, about 32% to 33%."

Misunderstood Share Count


Many shareholders seem unaware of PLUG's true number of fully diluted shares of
common stock. Investors should be aware of the dilutive impact of options, warrants and
restricted stock units, each of which significantly affects the company's diluted share
count. Based on our analysis, we arrived at a total diluted share count of 160.5 million
shares, far above what appears on news sites like Google and Yahoo Finance.


On March 19, 2014, Air Liquide filed a form schedule 13D stating that it could convert its
preferred stake on May 8, 2014 to 10.9 million common shares. We believe that Air
Liquide is seriously considering this conversion as its stake is worth $83 million,

representing 32x its initial investment of $2.6 million. This would further dilute existing
shareholders.


As of April 1, 2014, Google Finance and Yahoo Finance displayed outstanding share
counts of 106.3 million and 103.5 million, respectively. In reality, there are 160.5 million
shares outstanding (using the treasury stock method), rather than the reported figures on
Google and Yahoo. These share count differences result in a material market
capitalization delta of $408 million (Google) and $430 million (Yahoo).

Operating Cash Burn and Equity Dilution


PLUG has never been profitable in the history of its existence. Since 2006, the company
has burned through about $320 million, generating only $154 million of revenue over the
same period. In order to stay afloat, PLUG required multiple secondary share offerings. If
market conditions had been less favorable for speculative companies like PLUG, it may
have gone out of business long ago.

Over the same period, PLUG managed to raise over $316 million through secondary
common and preferred issuances, often underwritten by the same investment bank which
published research reports in favor of the company. Cowen and Company, sole
underwriter of PLUG's secondary offerings from 9/16/2013, 01/15/2014 and 03/06/2014,
currently rates the company a buy with a target of $7.50. Though these instances are
common on Wall Street, we were concerned when Cowen released favorable commentary
and raised its price target to $5.50 from $5.00 on March 3, 2014, sending the shares up
25% three days before it underwrote 3.9 million shares in a secondary offering.

5/23/2018 Plug Power: Unprofitable Past, Poor Fundamentals, And A Best-Case DCF Value Of $2-$2.50/Share - Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2122093-plug-power-unprofitable-past-poor-fundamentals-and-a-best-case-dcf-value-of-2-2_50-share 15/67


Over time, these secondary offerings would have caused ~94% of dilution for a
shareholder that owned PLUG stock in 2006. To put this into perspective, a shareholder
that owned 1,000 shares in 2006 would effectively own a mere 60 shares today.


Some of these secondary offerings have been combined with warrants to further sweeten
the deal for new institutional investors. PLUG's 1/15/2014 offering marketed 10.0 million
common shares combined with 4.0 million warrants and was sold to a single institutional
investor for $3.00 per share, representing an extremely aggressive 16% discount to the
previous day's close price. In these arrangements, PLUG only receives the upfront
proceeds on the common shares and nothing from the warrants. As a result, PLUG
shareholders gain nothing from the warrants except further dilution of their ownership.


Conclusion


The speculative ramp-up of PLUG's share price is unjustified, and we believe the
downside potential is immense. PLUG has never been profitable, operates a business
with low barriers to entry, and operates in an unproven industry, all while shareholders
have suffered extreme dilution. PLUG describes itself as an innovative manufacturer at
the forefront of the fuel cell industry, but in reality PLUG is nothing more than a value-
added integrator, sourcing key fuel cell components from third parties. While the market
gives PLUG substantial credit for its recent Wal-Mart order, the company must
demonstrate significantly more growth and profitability to justify a realistic valuation. And
even then we believe that PLUG deserves to trade closer to 4-5x revenue, or 70% below
the current forward trading multiple.


Shareholders must consider whether a company that has generated $27 million of LTM
sales, has been uncompetitive for more than a decade and has survived by diluting
shareholders, is truly worth $1.1 billion. Should PLUG miss its projections for 2014, it will

pain for current shareholders. With speculative investors driving excess trading volume
each day, in what looks like a game of musical chairs, don't be left without a seat when
PLUG shares correct downwards.

Rationalized reason seriously? Can you not read when they release the news of the deals that have been
going on? Wal-Mart has put in big orders along with the FedEx order too. Now with this "new" car maker who
ever it might be (Tesla, VW, etc) that we keep waiting for.


As I've said in many other PLUG posts this stock will be in the $10-$11 range by end of summer and then
higher towards the year end.

When you start talking about the same Walmart, Auto "Major" Announcment stuff all I hear is "Baaaa, Baaaa."

You must only shop in Walmart Stores.... Do you think it's an accident that WalMart has the absolutely lowest
prices?


Do you think Walmart can sell everything at absolute rock-bottom prices because it's making its Vendors rich?


Bottom Line - If a company can not create positive margin on their Goods before selling to WalMart; it is not
going to suddenly start making profits after a WalMart order (especially the ones to sustain a Billion-plus
Market Cap company)

It's too bad you guys don't have a clue what it's like to sell products to WalMart...


Are you aware that PLUG has been selling to WalMart for years already? Notice that those sales were
negative margins? (Just like every other Sale PLUG delivers...)

Whether you are shorting or not. Coming on here saying that PLUG isn't valued correctly, saying everything is
old news blah blah, that this company has no future in sight. Basically showing you're a short for this stock. If
you're not in this stock at all quit your hating and move on to something that you are invested in that your
input would actually be useful because your input here is beyond useless and pathetic...


Geez all these PLUG articles are always getting hundreds of comments haha

Good Luck to you Flyerguy - I wish no harm upon anyone Long or Short.


But don't be so blinded by your passion & conviction that you dismiss logic & reason. There is no doubt that
PLUG the stock is garbage; and time will show this to be true (whether you figure out before the crash or not)

Srsly - why do you engage the plug sheep? Have you read their posts in the past? This textbook example is
barely coherent:


"Now with this beverage maker "Diageo" just continues to show you don't short this stock!! Shorts never win
and you will continue to see that!!"


No, shorts never win. Stocks only go up. Hype and air count for more than profitability. It's different this time!


Come on, man. I read your stuff and you're 100% right @ plug, but you're wasting your time trying to teach
calculus to savages. A wise Chinese philosopher once said "If you stop to confront every barking dog on the
road, you will never reach your destination"

You're absolutely right (& very nice quote - I believe I've heard it before).


I guess I'm trying to assuage my conscious by attempting to give the poor Sheep fair warning; since they are

I will honestly feel guilty taking all these characters' money through Long-Dated puts & L.D. OTM Bear Credit
Spreads.... (Pure Shorting PLUG is a crazy idea to me right now!)


I won't be wasting my time, thoughts, & keyboard taking on this Mob anymore (or at least I will try not to :-P)

regurgitating the same old information that all the other short articles use.  
What I do find interesting is that Andrew Left can write a short article and value the stock at 50 cents, then
have another short write an article and value the stock at up to 5 times that amount with essentially the same
exact info. Quite a difference. The one similarity is the obvious motive of the articles.

manfredthree
@mlauritz... too bad your info on Walmart is even more out of date than your bits on PLUG. We assume you
do not shop at Walmart, if you did you would know they not only do not have the 'absolutely lowest prices'
(that is reserved for online shopping, definitely not from Walmart), but that Walmart has not for years held out
that they do. Walmart, like AMZN, adds huge value through location and extremely intelligent distribution. And
the model would break down entirely in your 'absolute low' scenario.  
As a distribution giant, Walmart is in the middle of PLUG's wheelhouse. PLUG's products enhance mission -
critical operations in the WMT distribution chain, just as with all of PLUG's other customers.  
But its nice that your give us an opportunity to make so many major corrections in one short reply.

There has been no FedEx order since 2011. This last order (range extenders ) was the Govt paying for
something that FedEx gets for free. The first order FedEx made was for 35 units in 2011 and the Govt paid for
half of them.

Flyer,


You know that the car maker, as you refer to it, that sale is not one that is going in to cars; that it is to run the
material handling equipment at the assembly factory. Plug has no plans to integrate its fuel cell stacks in to
anyone's cars. And it is more than likely BMW, where Plug already has a large fleet running, and BMW is
expanding the plant that is running those trucks.


03 Apr 2014, 11:16 PM

PLUG's PEM fuelcell stacks are a minor part of BLDP's business.

It remains to be seen what Marsh has meant by saying 'new auto manufacturer'. I am long Plug, but I do
acknowledge that Marsh is a horrible speaker and a calculative communicator.


04 Apr 2014, 09:07 AM


Doewap
11% of revenue is not minor:


quote ValueWalk:


Regulatory filings indicate that Plug Power made up 11% of Ballard's 2013 revenue


end quote


And 2014 is supposed to be bigger, but 2015 it will drop.


So for Ballard, getting orders from other businesses is all the more important now.


Their Telecom may very well make up for this probable loss.


04 Apr 2014, 09:09 AM


CleanEnergyNow
Plus I think $PLUG will keep buying stacks from $BLDP for quite some time, it will take a while to get the
ReliOn production facility up to speed and also $BLDP will help with larger orders as they come in to increase
production capacity and turn-around.

I suspect that PLUG has intentionally mislead investors by announcing a pending deal with a large automaker - they
want people to think that fuel cells are going into cars. No fuel cells are going into cars. They are only (hopefully)
selling fuel cells for the forklifts used in the warehouse!! and selling them at a loss


I love the comments - I couldn't be happier with who is on the other side of this trade! As a matter of policy I should
inform you that you'd be better off indexing.

Anyone with even the faintest knowledge of Plug's product offering would be able to know that the GenDrive
is not going to go into any automobile or truck for the purpose of propelling the vehicle.

Right and not just EU, there will be FCEVs sold in the USA in 2015 for sure, maybe Hyundai and/or Mercedes
will get a head start and release FCEVs in the USA in 2014. (This will only be in certain areas where H2
fueling is already available, L.A. for example)

T o same 123; Weighing Machine did not say that they lied, he said mislead. 
A proper choice of words: could be misentrepreted as going into cars. Of course Fuel cells, supplied by

Actually, the range extenders that $PLUG makes will be applicable to BEVs (battery electric vehicles),
including but not limited to battery electric FedEx trucks, and could be used to extend the range of travel
before needing a recharge of the main battery, which takes time. So in a way, we could say that Plug Power
fuel cell systems "may" go into some BEV cars and trucks.


21 Apr 2014, 09:13 AM

You need to take into account that Plug had to correct a lot of issues on units delivered in 2012 which hurt the
service margins.

all you do is make it easier for players like me to buy more shares and put up a resistance so short sellers can beat
this stock up. everyone just watch this stock break $10.00 a share when the news comes out about the auto
company.

also why don't you tell cowen that it should trade at $2.50 a share. They bought it at $5.75 a share. I think they would
know more about Plugs financials then you do. So let me see you respond to that, if you know the answer.

You're right - they bought at an instant Discount @ $5.75 a share the same day it was trading $6.30+ ....

Where do you get this political garbage? First off, fuel cell are in cars manufactured by Honda. The Clarity.
Look it up. http://bit.ly/Apsaf3 
They are not being ass produced for a number of reasons: 
1) The fuel cell stacks needed in Autos are terrible expensive. This is why Honda is only "leasing" them as
they want them all back. This is why you have to get physical damage insurance from Honda and not your
local insurance agent because it would be too expensive and Honda is subsidizing them. 
2) The fuel cells don't work too well in cold weather. Which is why they are only sold in Southern California.
Not sure if this is a technological problem which can easily be overcome. 
3) No infrastructure to refuel with hydrogen. Producing and distributing large amounts of hydrogen is far, far
away. Only Southern California right now.


This is a technology and economic problem. Not Republican/Democrat. And since most Democrats have no
concept of basic economics or science, they blame Republicans. I suggest you go back to school and study
up on those two subjects.

Mr. Republican, your comments does not bode well for your Party. The issue is whether a company with a
history of missing projections, practices that consistently dilute existing shareholder value, does not own the
technology it touts as a source of future success, and is selling at a gigantic 18 times projected earning,
higher than global leaders like Facebook and TESLA, deserve this kind PPS or PE on future unknown
earnings.


Mr. Republican, the issue, therefore, is that you could lose a huge percentage of your hard earned money
invested in this stock. Now, if you Mr. Republican disagree, please feel to offer empirically based rebuttal.


This goes for most other comments regarding this perceptive article.

Actually, under G.W. Bush, the DoE was given a nod by big oil and research on H2/FC technology was
supported. I think big oil (which pretty much controls DoE) was genuinely curious if hydrogen technology
could eventually be a viable alternative fuel. By the end of the Bush administration, the answer was clear.
This is very viable technology but it is way too good, way too soon!


So big oil used its leverage over Obama (they paid for a lot of his campaign expenses, I'm sure) and asked
him to choose Steven Chu as secretary of energy. Obama agreed. In his first DoE budget, Chu proposed $0

for hydrogen in transportation applications. It was a mystery to those of us in the industry for quite some time,
how could this otherwise quite intelligent man not see the potential in hydrogen and fuel cells. Does he just
need a little education on the technology?


Then the BP blow-up in the Gulf came along and Chu had a pretty light touch and hands off approach. That
was a tip-off to me that BP had friends in high places and I looked for connections. This article explains a lot... 
http://exm.nr/1hx7hwd


As the article points out, as director of Lawrence Berkeley Nat'l Labs, Steve Chu happily accepted a $500M
grant from BP to explore bio fuels. At the time, BP's Chief Scientist was a Steve Koonin and they were good
buddies (Chu & Koonin). Fast forward now to Chu arriving in office and who does he pick as Under
Secretary? Steve Koonin.


So yes, I agree that there is a lot of reluctance on the part of big oil to move into hydrogen and fuel cells. It's
only natural from their standpoint, they have invested a lot of money in their inventory in the ground and they
want to extract and refine and sell it to realize the profit. If hydrogen and fuel cells take over the market too
soon, they'll be left holding the bag.


When Chu cut the hydrogen budget (early 2009), Congress put it all back that year but it was still a bit of a
black eye for the hydrogen fuel cell industry. Luckily, the automakers turned out to be not as linked to big oil
as one might expect and they said basically, "With or without DoE support, we're going ahead with
development of the technology because we believe it is the right solution going forward." And they have spent
billions (collectively) on it resulting in some great vehicles which I have had the pleasure of driving at trade
shows.


So thanks to the automakers and their collective commitment to the technology, we will have hydrogen
vehicles on the road in the USA next year.

A quote like


...likely lacks in the research capability to innovate its way out of its current precarious financial situation...


says it all and this one further proves you are ignorant on Plug's current R&D activities: 
...After all, Plug Power is merely a value-added integrator of Ballard's fuel cells, and no more...


And this one: 
...For example, the Wal-Mart order represents just 5% of its entire fleet. ..


Actually, Sir, that is a bullish argument.


But this takes the cake: 
...In fact, Toyota has already developed a prototype for its line of fuel cell forklifts with plans to produce a commercial
line "in the near future."...


Will you please explain then how Plug's business is flawed...?

Graphene supercapacitors will replace chemical batteries. Fuel Cell Technology will replace fossil fuels for
transportation needs and materials handling.


Ballard powered buses in Scotland http://bit.ly/1h2R085


According to a Forbes article -


"FedEx Express is also the beneficiary of a DoE award for development of hydrogen fuel cells. The $3 million project
is actually a collaboration between FedEx Express, Smith Electric Vehicles and Plug Power, which is one of the
better-known players in this market segment.


The focus is on creating hydrogen fuel cell extenders for 20 electric delivery trucks that are part of the FedEx fleet.
Right now, the trucks have a range of only about 80 miles per charge. The converted vehicles will run on lithium-ion
batteries combined with a 10-kilowatt Plug Power hydrogen fuel cell system, specifically the GenDrive Series 1000.
(An image of the GenDrive appears below.)


The intent of the project is to prove out whether these converted vehicles are really more efficient than diesel-powered
trucks: it is anticipated that the “fuel” needed to power this fleet will cost 35 percent to 40 percent less than for diesel
trucks.


Plug Power has installed more than 4,000 GenDrive units, mainly for materials handling applications, where it says it
has roughly a 90 percent marketshare. Some of its biggest customers include Walmart, Sysco, Procter & Gamble,
and Mercedes.


In mid-January, the company announced a turnkey system for its technology called GenKey; it includes the GenDrive
fuel cells, GenFuel hydrogen fuel and infrastructure, and GenCare maintenance service. The intent is to make it
simpler for businesses to adopt the technology. In fact, it designed its products as a “drop-in replacement” for
traditional lead-acid batteries.


“GenKey allows us to increase our value-add for customers through building a comprehensive turnkey solution that
streamlines the transition to a hydrogen infrastructure – we do all the hard work, so the customer can focus on the
best use of it’s newfound productivity,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power, in a statement.


That’s important, because one of the big market inhibitors for hydrogen fuel cells has been, obviously, the lack of fuel
stations. As of 2012, there were only about 200 of them in the United States, estimates the DoE, although an initiative
announced in May 2013 aims to remedy that. California, as an example, has announced it will invest up to $200
million to reach 100 stations across the state by 2024.

Plus fuel cells are pretty scalable: technologies being tested by several automakers could provide up to 300 miles per
tank, which negates the range anxiety concerns that have plagued electric vehicle adoption. From a consumer
standpoint, Hyundai is planning to sell a Tucson SUV powered by a hydrogen fuel cell starting this year. Toyota also
has announced plans to pioneer this market, showing off prototypes of its FCV at two high profile shows this month.


Aside from Plug Power, another player to watch is Nuvera Fuel Cells, which like Plug Power, is testing applications
that use hydrogen fuel cells to power refrigeration units in delivery trucks. It received a $650,000 grant in August 2013
(which will be matched with private funds), to help with a test involving Thermo King. The initiative uses Nuvera’s
Orion fuel cell stack technology, which range from 10 kilowatts to 20 kilowatts. The trucks are powered by diesel
engineers: the refrigeration units will use the cells.


Nuvera is also involved with a trial to outfit marine vessels with larger versions of its technology: it has been
commissioned by Italian shipmaker Fincantieri to deliver eight Orion units for use as range extenders; delivery is
scheduled by mid-2014."

How about PLUG goes to $0? lol This author have authored so many garbage that cost losses to those that listened
to him. The article lacks depth in content, research or imagination imo. PLUG is at the center of a disruptive industry
which the time is here and the whole space would be unstoppable. 
In classical logic this is called "Appeal to Tradition: (also "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"). The fallacy that a standpoint,
situation or action is right, proper and correct simply because it has "always" been that way, because people have
"always" thought that way, or because it continues to serve one particular group very well.. A corrupted argument from
ethos (that of past generations). (E.g., "In America, women have always been paid less, so let's not mess with long-
standing tradition.").

A. Marsh has mentioned several times that PLUG will be EBITDA positive in 2014. Keep in mind, no U.S. FC
company has yet to be EBITDA positive in this sector, I believe.


You, more or less, are stating that PLUG Power's Mgt is still unable to prove that they can "profitably
monetize their Products". So, who are we to believe, you or A. Marsh? No offense, but I will take my chances
with him because he has more to lose (i.e. credibility) than you.

One of the 2 analysts works for PLUG's primary underwriting Bank - so no big surprise they're bullish.

back in the day, morgan hired tesla, not because morgan wanted to be the new Edison, but to keep tesla out of
Edison's way.


the underplot in who framed roger rabbit is actually a rather dark conspiracy on the part of automakers and big oil to
destroy public transit in l.a. and make it the totemic city of cars.


it's the nature of the market and of people whose wills to power are oversized for one reason and another.


so I'm not going to join the chorus of voices claiming all these cautions nothing more than short promotion. the points
the author makes are extremely valid.


if this were cigrx I'd be out and waiting for the reset to ride the next pump.


of course businesses lose money until they start selling their products, and their products start to sell when
consumers see value in the offering.


that's started now for plug. every order that's made now will increase that momentum.


if fuel cells are relegated to being the beta in the beta vhs battle, or Atari computers in the Microsoft/Atari/apple/... etc
etc battle, then people in plug will lose.


but if fuel cells stick within the marketplace, then bldp tech and plug integration will be huge.

5/23/2018 Plug Power: Unprofitable Past, Poor Fundamentals, And A Best-Case DCF Value Of $2-$2.50/Share - Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2122093-plug-power-unprofitable-past-poor-fundamentals-and-a-best-case-dcf-value-of-2-2_50-share 36/67


the walmart purchase, those notorious miser potters on their mountain, indicates that plug has a strong value
proposition, whether it's just pr or whether plug is losing money on the service side. if walmart continues to invest in
this tech in more centres, then plug's case is proven.


but it's totally acceptable for this author to be making the bear case known.


if you sold when this particular article was pub'd, you can now buy it back for .60 less per share. on a thousand
shares that's $600, enough for a tank of gas.


hopefully, most of us playing this are playing with house money now, like with cig rx.

It's nice to see both the long and short's view of a stock. However, the problem that I think many are having with this
article is the low price target associated with this stock...And how extreme numbers like that actually scare the
average investor away from this stock. 
I would call BS on a long that says this stock should be $1000 today just the same as I am calling BS on this short
article saying it should be $2.

GA or GS/GE?
highly suggested SEC to investigate such guys later on!!!


02 Apr 2014, 11:53 AM


qrc3288
for what? voicing his opinion? is that to mean the SEC should investigate anyone who recommended a stock
long as well?


what a joke. you read other bulls on here, take their advice and use it as an opportunity if stocks correct in the
mid-term as a result of a public short-seller. HLF and Ackman is a perfect example. A number of guys went
long when the stock tanked and doubled their money. Should be sending this guy a thank-you note if you
really like the stock...


which btw sounds like a complete concept with absolutely no basis in reality traded by a bunch of retail day-
traders riding the S&P 500 2013 wave. so recommend me to the SEC as well I guess.

Have you noticed that shorts come out with facts and actuals while the cheerleaders come out with garbage articles
devoid of facts? The truth about PLUG hurts. The company is garbage and people are paying $7.80 for it now just to
flip it for more money. The person who pays the most will be the one who gets it in the end when this stock drops
below $1 a share. This company has been a pump and dump stock since 2000.


The fact is few customers are going to get a positive ROI on a $20,000 battery plus the infrastructure needed to
convert to fuel cells. SCiB batteries are much cheaper and charge in about the same time is fuel cell technology.


02 Apr 2014, 12:02 PM


brandondelbosque1@yahoo.com
if it was so much garbage, then why is places like walmart, cisco, BMW, mercedes and so on buying the
product. a lot of people like to look at plug like it is 2000. I admit it, it failed then,but this is a different era and it
has now perfected its product. People need to stop looking at the past and focus on the future.


02 Apr 2014, 12:57 PM


Doewap
It is called perception.


And your assessment of battery vs fuel cell is void of knowledge.


Can you show us any SCiB batteries fit for the same vehicles as the GenDrive?

You are missing the point, Dan. This is a different company than it was in 2000. It is possible for an R&D
company to morph into a profitable business. That is what's happening here and the technology is very much
in harmony with our present and future needs for more ways to store and transport electricity with minimal
environmental impacts. Please re-evaluate in light of the latest news.


02 Apr 2014, 07:21 PM

no matter you short or long, this plug tank will not be filled or drained over night, it need times to work out. 
May be quite a long time to show the real result.


Now there's only one certain thing in the short term, that is high fluctuation.

Holthusen
What R&D is Plug doing, besides researching ways to buy products from innovative Companies, assembling
them, and then selling the package? 
They've done a good job selling, but do they really have an edge over anyone doing the same assembly at
lower price?


03 Apr 2014, 09:24 AM

You know why those big Co's supporting it? they just want to put bit of money there, as sort of PR stuff, so
consumers won't think they are just creating nothing new, instead of outside decorations.


put some money there, then forget it, and back to sell those old style gas cars, that is what they really
thought. At least they are not committed, just involved. like that old sayings upon breakfast about bacon and
egg, the pigs are committed, and the chickens are involved. They can throw quite a lot of eggs around,
instead of changing the old habit and create something really new. If they really serious about it, they should
build a whole factory for that, it should be no problem for them, considering their size and financial strength, if
it will be big, why leave those good chances to some poor rookie startups, at least they can swallow some up.
They are doomed, those big autos. 
Except those who embranced EV full heartly, Nissan, Tesla, etc.


03 Apr 2014, 09:32 AM


Doewap
You are oversimplifying this. I admit there are also people who overcomplicate Plug's business. Neither is
good for valuation.


Plug is master of the RELIABLE and ECONOMICAL (not less expensive, but at acceptable cost) use of air-
cooled inegrated power supply in forklifts. This is what one may refer to as a harsh environment, it is not
stationary and it is not consistent in power demand, temperature, humidity etc..


It is now trying to apply the same knowledge to airport ground support and refrigerated transport. That is
where its R&D is taking place.


It is NOT technically very complex and at the same time, it is NOT easy!

You are analysing the auto industry with WHAT relation to Plug exactly?

Long this sector. silver linings to this hit piece is that $BLDP and $FCEL stayed positive while $PLUG (temporarily)
slid. These short articles are having the opposite effect long term because they keep on saying the same things.
These stocks don't ride on fundamentals. Its climate change. Google IPCC. The inflection point is that climate change
is here to stay and only thing we can do is mitigate severity.

If the stock had not been on the most recent upside run, this article never gets written or posted. Just because a stock

But...yawn...it's just another slick presentation in a steady stream of such articles that basically regurgitate the
same information. If these people, who seem to be trying to support a short position, were true to their
convictions they would simply establish a short position and wait for the stock to take the nose dive that they
believe is in store for it. It's when good folks with short positions have to resort to writing articles to move the
price lower that you begin to question the veracity of their positions. It's also getting a bit boring and
predictable.

I will say it again I feel $5+ is where this stock will be until the next order comes in. That being said it is $1 to $2 more
than this article speculates and $2 under where it is currently. The Ballard part of the article is interesting to me
because PLUG announced that Ballard was the exclusive provider until the end of December, 2014 and then it
questions why they have not announced any new providers. Is that really a concern at this time?


Revenues 2012 26.1 million, revenues 2013 26.6 million and projected for 2014 are 60 million. That is why I still hold
shares.


02 Apr 2014, 12:20 PM

I do not own one share of plug and in the past have shorted the hell out of it but this is just a hit piece for one of the
other fuel cell companies. TO point people in this stock to theirs. This happens in many areas of the market. Tech
stocks having people " promotions " to point people to other tech stocks. Although I agree with the gentlemen`s
sentiment that the stock is over priced you should never believe in any hit piece written pointing you to another
company. I personally would not own a share of PLUG but the market is a gamble so pull the slot on whatever
machine you want.

People who lack the necessary education and experience tend to liken the market to a casino. Perhaps you
should stick to changing oil filters, or whatever it is you do best, and let accomplished professionals handle
the investing. You might then view the market more optimistically.


02 Apr 2014, 02:00 PM


FF373737
Kevin A, you are kidding yourself if you think anyone can predict where any one stock or where the market
will be in the next 5 minutes, 5 hours, 5 days, 5 weeks, should I go on. There are just too many factors that
come into play. I just like the way he said it is all.


Accomplished professionals fail on a daily basis with regards to the markets, all of them on any given day.
Anyone that tells you otherwise or thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. On just about any given decent
stock you can find one saying buy and one saying sell. With regards to the market some say its bull and some
will say bear. The only ones you hear from after is the one that's right until they are wrong. Some are better
than others but none are perfect over any long period of time. Many accomplished professionals end up out of
the market and finding something "they do best" just like the rest of us.

E. Musk is quoted in this article stating that he said fuel cells are BS. Interesting, since Mr. Musk is attempting to
improve his bottom line cost figures by building a lithium-ion giga battery factory-apparently the only way left to bring
down his cost to an anticipated $10,000 per battery pack.


On a more opportunistic note, fuel cell electric vehicles may seem to be the way to go for now. Improvements are
being made to bring down the manufacturing cost which is not as obviously restricted in cost improvements as are
lithium batteries. This will be another feather in Plug Power's cap when their 3 million dollar government grant to
customize 20 FedEx electric vehicles with hydrogen FC's and build the GenDrive infrastructure necessary so that
FedEx may convert more of its electric vehicles in their fleet with hydrogen FC extenders.

The author writes about Plug competitors (Hydrogenics): 
"This Canadian company has strategic investors that include Commscope, Enbridge, and General Motors, the latter
of which owns 5% of the business."


Not true. 
GM sold its HYGS shares back in 2009.The management lies about GM being Hydrogenics shareholder.


Enbridge has sold most (perhaps all) of its HYGS shares few weeks ago.


The prices of all f-cell companies are manipulated and should be investigated by SEC.

Too bad another Steve Jobs isn't at the helm of this company. 
If the heads of PLUG get their act together and do their best to prevent the carpet from being yanked out from under
the REAL INVESTORS who have faith in them (like diluting and rediluting the stocks and hyping about themselves
without the numbers to prove it)...they may survive....nothing worse than making investors lose faith in your stocks... 
That said - PLUG has spectacular potential. If PLUG can't stay above water a bigger player will gulp it up...A big
player like Air Liquide already sees the value in it. 
Those GenDrives are the future. It's unstoppable...

If the rumor is true and Diageo is really thinking about buying Plugs product, this could be a bigger deal then walmart.
If thats the case, this stock will easily break its year high.


02 Apr 2014, 01:01 PM


Doewap
I am sorry, I do not mean to dump on Plug, I am long since 0,68 with considerable amounts.


But I do not believe Diageo has made a deal with Plug other than starting a trial.


I can not imagine customers coming from nowhere going straight into a genkey contract. It is just too much into the
vein of the operations.


Furthermore, I do not believe that any account will eclipse WalMart with the exception of a potential future deal with
Ikea.

To make a long story short; I am a retired officer of a retail installment sales finance company located in the state of
New Jersey, but upon retirement about 11 years ago, I opted to move to a warmer and friendlier climate so am now in
Sunny Arizona. 
To supplement my retirement, I have become an amateur investor but due to common sense and the use of due
diligence, I've done fairly well in my choices. I've written a response to a combination of the mailings that are being
received about PLUG.


What's really amazing is the number of FICTION WRITERS out there who manage to get a lot of novice investors all
shook up and in turn they create havoc on the individual stock on which the writer LIKELY HOLDS a major SHORT
position. This is the second time that I've seen this happen in as many weeks, but I've only been investing in Plug for
roughly 4 to 5 weeks.

Perhaps those "writers" should try giving their work to a publishing house??


There are certain things that PLUG is involved in that are not yet Public Record and it certainly appears (at least in my
own humble opinion) that they still do have major sized plans for their company and that the legitimate investors in all
likelihood will fare well if they don't panic and don't get too greedy.


As I've stated before, I am not a licensed broker nor am I an analyst, so I can give no recommendations, but that
would likely be true of most of those who write in - but it would be nice if they wouldn't stretch to facts beyond belief.


Good luck to all of you.

so let me get this straight.


you imply short sellers write articles to induce price declines to profit at the expense of novice investors. you
may disagree with negative articles, but at least many provide compelling food for thought and supporting
evidence for valuation claims and assumptions.


meanwhile, you airily tell those "novice" investors that PLUG is actually a long due to certain "things" that are
"not yet Public Record" and recommend holding until those non-public "things" come to fruition.


WHAT!@$#@#$*@#$ So you're telling long investors "don't panic" hang in there because you know some
illegal, market-moving inside information. In reality I suspect that's all you can come up with to recommend
long, but seriously. Comedy central right here.

the technical's on PLUG, in my opinion are shifting since this mornings well written article. there has to be a

there is no upside left in this stock at the moment. only downside.

For a growth company, their core product isn't growing:


"Our unit backlog on December 31, 2013 was 1,439 units representing approximately $24.2 million in invoice value.
Backlog on December 31, 2012 was 1,309 units representing approximately $25.9 million in invoice value."


They shipped 918 units in 2013 vs. 1,391 units in 2012. That is a DECLINE of 34%.


02 Apr 2014, 02:19 PM


Doewap
Plug redefines the term lumpiness, for sure. But the shipments in the past were almost exclusively against
trial orders and single site & equipment only orders.


Plug of the past cannot be compared to Plug of the future. The face off between shorts and longs exists only
because of Plug's extended state of inflection.


03 May 2014, 08:36 AM

After carefully reading your analysis I question your motives in Plug power. You have made a lot of assumptions not
proven on economic or financial concepts. My question to the writer is it because Plug was getting close to the $8.48
mark where you would be forced to cover?


02 Apr 2014, 02:20 PM


hahaha23
Who buys based on current value? Facebook buyers anyone? Seriously, you buy based on what the stock may be
tomorrow. It's obvious based on market sentiment that PLUG has reached its inflection point and it's a big deal. When
you live in the past, you will miss out or be in denial. That's it folks.

Kerrisdale Capital Management's website reads, "Kerrisdale Capital Management is a private investment manager
THAT FOCUSES ON VALUE..." (emphasis my own).


I didn't have to read your website though to realize you are a value shop and growth is not your specialty. This article
was obviously written by a value manager making assumptions on growth company and/or growth investors. In short,
stick to value companies. Seriously, why even bother using quotes from a 10K from 2012? Are you being objective, or
does it simply fit your value biased approach?


PLUG is certainly receiving its fair share of attention these days, I am skeptical of everything I read whether its pro or
con, but lets keep a level head about this company. I look forward to another article from your shop hopefully
showcasing the downside possibilities from Elon Musk's flavor of the month "Tesla".

People always focus on the past with PLUG. I agree, the past is a black eye, but look at the future. This company has
some real positive factors that I think will make the past a distant memory. Why can't it be another success story? I
think it will be, the shorts will be hurt!

Nothing new: bearish analysts are trying to make quick bucks doing short sales every time the stock is going up. Their
intent are seen now by long PLUG investors. 
No selling and adding more when the stock dips. When PLUG post a few big orders and profits in 2014, the stock
would be $14-$20 and the price would be sustainable. 
PLUG was $1,500.00 when in initial start years and had no profits. The sky would be the limit from the current price
when it posts the first profit since the company is found. Just disregard this article which they seems to put out there
days after days trying to suppress PLUG stock price increase and momentum. Sooner rather than later, these king of
analysis would be irrelevant and disregard by the market when PLUG booking a few more big orders...

Can somebody explain how the barriers to entry for this market are low? It says that in the article summary and
conclusion but I didn't see much mention of it in the body. Does the author mean Toyota or Honda can easily enter?

Well done Kerrisdale. This stock is such a joke -- a horse race between this and UNIS for the biggest promotion of the
past year. Both are going under $1 -- it's just a question of when.

Considering this was one of the only articles widely posted about PLUG today... The author has successfully swayed
the market (i.e. halted today's stock price increase) for a personal gain. Kudos! That is power! Reason for that
statement:


FACT: The disclosure states that Kerrisdale Capital Management CURRENTLY holds a short position with PLUG.


OBSERVATION: Odd that an extremely low target price would be associated with an article written by an author who
CURRENTLY holds a short position.


PARALLEL: Selling home alarm systems to people whose homes you've broken in to :/


Love how this stock system works. Perhaps I'll take a long position and THEN write an article about how PLUG
should be $1000 like it was back in 2000.

You're welcome to do so. I'd love to see the rationality as to why a consistently money losing enterprise with

frmpalo,


Chances are that he/she will not reply. The company named above, Kerrisdale Capital Mgt., is a hedge fund.
Shorting a company is one of their tools to earn money for their shareholders, unlike mutual fund companies
which operate under different bylaws. The SA platform has become the quintessential advertising forum for
the bear/bull retail market.

Currently, Plug Power owns a large portfolio of intellectual property including more than 150 US patents related to fuel
cell stack design, fuel cell system design, fuel processing, fuel dispensing, energy storage and controls. This includes
patents relating to the safe dispensing of hydrogen and the use of a fuel cell system as a direct battery replacement in

Ballard's fuel stacks are quite expensive and take a huge % of markup. 
Now PLUG finally will get "in-house" fuel stack production rolling, margins will significantly increase. I guess the
author is dreading writing this before the ReliOn acquisition. LOL LOL 
Andy has been clearly stating for over a year now that fuel stack production is his goal, I guess author did not take
Andy seriously or just brushed it off as a non-event????

Really? In-House Fuel Cell production - you believe eh?


What a steal PLUG got paying only $4M (in stock) for a company that will replace the $500M+ Valued Ballard
Power Systems!


I can't believe the rest of the market missed the opportunity to buy such a valuable firm such as ReliOn at
such a remarkable discount! (Literally; I don't believe it!)


02 Apr 2014, 10:31 PM


JonasGrumby
mlauritz- Your facts that you posted sorta came out twisted, bent and acutely distorted. ReliOn does not
replace the company Ballard ($500MM cap value). ReliOn technology becomes Marsh's in-house
manufacture of fuel stacks, thus eliminating the Ballard markup on the sales of fuel stacks to PLUG. Now why
in the world would you interject the cap. value of Ballard into the equation has me baffled.  
Ballard's main products are sub-megawatt stationary fuel cells for electric & heat generation. ReliOn does not
make such a thing.  
So not only did PLUG buy fuel stack production technology, they have now a few more big names to fling
around in their PR's. 
July-December, 2014 will be exciting and hope to see you then.

PLUG has absolutely horrific fundamentals. Some of the worst numbers I have ever seen from a company. I don't
care how early of a stage they're in. Only $26MM in revs and a loss of $62MM. So what if they sold some forklifts to
Wal-Mart? Is that supposed to be proof of a successful business model?


Oh, and here is this gem I found in their 10-K under risk factors: "We do not have extensive experience in
manufacturing and marketing our products and, as a result, may be unable to sustain a profitable commercial market
for our new and existing products." It goes on further "We do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient,
low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture our products in commercial
quantities while meeting the quality, price, engineering, design, and production standards required to profitably market
our products."


So they've never mass produced their forklift fuel cells. Keeping that in mind, here is the ultimate red flag: "For
example, platinum is a key material in our PEM fuel cells. Platinum is a scarce natural resource and we are
dependent upon a sufficient supply of this commodity. Any shortages could adversely affect our ability to produce
commercially viable fuel cell systems and significantly raise our cost of producing our fuel cell systems."

They rely on platinum! It's $1,450/oz! They've never mass produced fuel cells and they rely on an extremely rare and
expensive metal worth more than gold. Building gold plated fuel cells would be cheaper. How about diamond crusted
forklifts? What happens when there is another market downturn and the platinum market spikes?


No sane investor should invest in this company. Go to a casino.

@ Emmanuel Noriega - The second I read in your posting that $PLUG sells forklifts it rendered your posting
worthless. At first I thought you were being sarcastic but clearly know nothing about this company, its
products or what us longs think the future holds despite its checkered past and CURRENT fundamentals. The
fact that you got 5 likes is what really scares me cause that means that 5 other people have no clue either.

Great article. The DCF is very generous. Being such a volatile stock I would estimate the discount rate higher at 13 to
15%. Anyways that wouldn't change the reality much, it's waaaaaay overvalued fundamentally. Not that it
matters.....until it does. Good luck to the longs. I'm glad to take the other side of that trade all day long. I hope the
price spikes higher so I can make even more money going short. Trade of the year. I'm going all in on PLUG short. I
thought the DDD short was enough for the year but it came to early, so maybe now I'm just getting greedy.

speculated to be worth somewhere between 50 cents and has been purchased this year at over $11 at one

Any Worth it does possess today is tied to the Accumulated Tax Losses/Credits which may be worth a few
nickles per share at best.

"PLUG’s current market capitalization is higher than the sum of the market capitalizations of Ballard Power (PLUG’s
critical supplier of fuel cell stacks) and Hydrogenics Corporation (competing manufacturer of hydrogen equipment and
fuel cell-based backup power systems), despite expecting to generate less than half of their combined revenues." 
Market expects that PLUG's sales will grow 144% this. Ballard and Hydrogenics growth are nowhere near that
number. PLUG's share of combined revenue is growing. At least, market expects that. 
"Even more astounding, PLUG’s forward sales multiple of 18x exceeds that of even Tesla and Facebook, more
innovative companies that have already demonstrated above-market growth. " 
Yes, but market doesn't expect them to grow as high as Plug Powers. Plug 144 percent growth vs. Tesla's 84% and
Facebook's 44%. 
So higher multiples reflect higher growth projections. The main question should be: is PLUG's growth in 2014 going to
be that strong?


Besides that, good job.

"These facts lead us to believe that PLUG is a niche solution for a small subset of warehouse facilities that operate on
three shifts in large, 24-hour distribution centers. This helps explain PLUG's lack of organic growth and reminds us
that PLUG may already have largely penetrated its addressable market. For the vast majority of distribution centers,
fuel cells are simply not the correct solution."


I am just wondering how many warehouses you believe exist in PLUG's addressable market. Could you please
elaborate? It is my understanding that of the addressable market Plug power has about 2%. Would that not leave a
market of 98% that they could get?

dbrown- Not only forklifts, also electric vehicle range extenders. So you can start with UPS, USPS, FEDEX
and a post above made a Tesla comment which I won't elaborate on. So the cliché "Think Outside Of The
Box" is needed here. Think outside of forklifts. 
Many long distance fleets are evolving quickly to CNG LNG. Check CLNE. 
USPS FEDEX and UPS have both long distance vehicles and local delivery. 
Yes locally done using electric. Range extenders, ooops already there. 
Tesla already talking about it. 
Check FCEL and their tri-generation services. Just ramping up. 
Nitrogen consumed by road vehicles and forklifts!!! Consumed by fuel stacks. To see where nitrogen will be
sourced from, then FCEL is your read. 
Eliminating the expensive Ballard fuel stacks was a giant leap for Marsh. 
Keep your eye on the birdie.

The acquisition of ReliOn is exactly what Marsh has been planning for over a year. In-house production of fuel stacks
lead DIRECTLY to increased margins. 
Ballard fuel stacks were quite expensive keeping revenue margins slim. 
In-house production will lead to higher profit and also drive a larger demand since the delivered product can now be
made cheaper. 
Second half CY2014 will be quite an interesting ride.

I am a small time investor, first time actually. I have a friend that has been in the forklift battery business for years.
Very dangerous battery work and very unhealthy to say the least. He believes this is the future for all commercial
energy for forklift types. I see the news writers being the ones that drive the prices up and down. I am sticking with
PLUG because they have a great product. Sure if I sell I make a few bucks. Investing is interesting when a company
makes bad policies in the distant past. They are in a different realm now. Different management as well. Stop being
so negative about them based on the past. A baseball players batting average is the past not the present.

It looks like, this is a very obvious typical scare tactics of short sellers to desperately cover their short when they
realized they made a mistake in shorting the stock.


The technical chart indicators is in contrast with the pessimistic view of this article.  
$Plug has real products, real industry leader customers, and providing the product's technology of the future.


If I am to enter a position for this stock, I will preferably go long instead of short, this is because no matter what
negative article they write to bring the price down, the technical charts is showing the opposite.


just my opinion....

Just wait until PLUG gets down to or below $7.. then we'll all see another article talking about how PLUG has nothing

Can't believe you put "Unprofitable Past" in the title. It's not even a relevant information to make a investment decision
on Plug Inc. Besides, even the most successful company has a Unprofitable past. Not a convincing evidence to prove
Plug is a bad investment.

I don't think the whole technology is at such a disgrace, but i do think those fuel cells are playing the game wrong,
what they should do is scale up and compete with Nuclear and thermal power plants. 
It is even cleaner than burning gas, due to its high efficiency.  
Instead of competing in the auto area, they should focus more on static applications, i.e, power plants, backup power,
etc. 
the especially attractive area will be using natural gas, directly, to power.

Clearly you have the short seat next to the doctor, John, and the other hedge fund folks. No new news, just
backwards reiteration of what has been said already.


We all know the past, but I as an investor like to see companies that have good timing, vision, and takes appropriate
strategic action on behalf of the company and the shareholders. Andy is taking this company to the leading edge and
is very conscious of the business economics' and is out to prove this technology. I agree the technology did have its
struggles for a decade during product development, but now it is ready for prime time. The business model is at the
ground floor, and is ready to start showing profits.


The acquisition of ReliOn Inc just proves that Andy is following his words and taking action to grow the opportunities
of the business. This acquisition will drive the cost of the gen drive units down with synergistic manufacturing
opportunities in addition to growing the customer base. Not to mention the potential future applications of Plug's
technology that could go mainstream and blow the above DCF analysis out of the water.


I see good things to come for Plug for the long term. Short term, hold on to the rails and brace yourself.

PLUG needed to get their products in use in the public eye for recognition that the product is viable. Walmart, the
largest retailer in the world is committing $millions with the conversion of all their battery powered lift trucks to H2. Not
an easy task to get in the Walmart door, PLUG is inside the warehouse. 
I don't know if PLUG makes money on the Walmart deal or not but the marketing benefit of the deal is huge.

People are buying electric cars, you should focus more on small customers, what they are buying, instead of stating
which big customer bought how many of this forklifts, and how many more big orders from those big Cos will be
expected. 
It will keep its advantage in this small niche market, if they are really focus on this, why they are diluting their shares
all the time? they should focus more in creating values and at least break even for their shareholders, instead of
giving people the illusion that this tech is hot and will be the next big thing and thus drive up the stock price.


If somebody are manipulating those fuel cell stocks, they are the Fuel Cell Management guys, not us investors. 
I am though think they do have some markets, power generation, backup power, some forklift, but I really don't
appreciate those management guys, esp. in their finance dept, seems the only thing they know is issuing more shares
and diluting.  
No matter we investors are long or short, we are all fooled by those management 
guys.


Even it is the next google, have google management did the same at their earlier stage ? keep talking , popping up
big news, by the CEO, and then diluting?


They are running a manufacturing company, not running a pyramid scheme ,which the product itself is nothing. 
Those management guys need definitely focus more on their products, as well as shareholder value.

Wow, the discussion on this stock go from silly to ridiculous in a hurry. If ReliOn is such a great strategic asset, why
would Cummins, one of the largest energy equipment companies in the world, be willing to sell it for a measly $4
Million, and as an asset sale? Clearly it must be a great business, and there must be tremendous value in the
operations as an on-going concern. Am I missing something here? Lousy money-losing company buys lousy
worthless assets for over-inflated stock, increases overall value of the firm? I think not.

@ Sameer, maybe Cummins saw an opportunity to make money off of some patents that they had no
intention of getting to involved in. Kodak practically gave away its digital tech patents many years ago
because they thought it was going to be a niche market. IBM gave away tech patents that eventually made
Apple what it is today because they thought they were worthless.


04 Apr 2014, 09:59 AM


Sameer Advani, Contributor
@FF373737, I suppose that's possible. It's more likely that they didn't see much long term benefit of having
an equity stake in the company, and they took the opportunity to liquidate their position.

Please take a look at a recent article written by Michael Bigger, a former banker / trader who managed $5+ billion
accounts. He started buying PLUG at .23 cents (yes, down there) and he thinks that PLUG has an eventual $10 billion
market cap possibility (that works out roughly to $100 per share) in 10 to 15 years.

The author of this article has used the following flawed assumptions to assess the future profitability of a company
(PLUG)


1. Past performance -- Not a professional way to value a company. I don't think I have to remind readers that Apple
was on the verge of bankruptcy in the early 1980s and Steve got the sack.. and the share price was around $ 4.


2. Poor fundamentals -- Obviously the author knows very little about PLUG and the products


3. DCF -- who nowadays use discounted flow to evaluate a company?


Here is why PLUG is " over valued"


" Today Fork Lifts -- tomorrow the world ( EVs)

Mark my words - Musk's Giga Factory will end up a " GIGA HYPE" and Elon will have to chew on his Lithium
batteries.


05 Apr 2014, 10:46 AM


CleanEnergyNow
Yes, I agree that the Giga investment in lithium batteries Elon Musk is about to make (maybe it's not too late)
could end up being a wrong turn. I like the guy a lot, respect his vision and ability to carry through. Just wish
he would take another look at fuel cell technology and fold that into his thinking. That Giga factory could be
part battery and part fuel cell manufacturing. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) need batteries too, just not
the huge ones required for the range Tesla is looking to achieve. Range and recharge time is where fuel cells
shine. When Toyota, Honda, and Mercedes all have their FCEV's on the road and in the hands of the public
(next year), the battery-only Tesla EV is going to lack the ability to head off on a long, all-day drive that the
FCEVs will have. Plus, buyers of these vehicles tend to care about the environment and I believe that
manufacturing batteries is more harmful than manufacturing fuel cells. But Tesla may have answers (reuse,
recycling, lithium for that in their new process, not sure. Articles like this one (found by Googling
"environmental impact of battery production")... 
http://bit.ly/1lAFgZO 
... make you wonder how much we are gaining with batteries and suggest (to me anyway) that fuel cells are a
better solution from an environmental standpoint as well as the other advantages (no charge time, unlimited
range (as long as you can fill 'er up on hydroen), no huge battery to replace/dispose when it wears out, less
bulk/weight, less foreign dependence, and maybe one or two others I am forgetting).

Thank you for being honest up front. I do not like reading articals pretending "NOT" to be SHORTS  
I Ask this question? When PLUG announced the purchase of ReliOn for 4m in stock (I aculy went to ReliOn web site
and did some DD) I ask you why would a company sale it's self for 4milion in stock to a componney heading down the
craper the CEO of ReliOn must know some thing? Fuel cells they are coming like it or not


09 Apr 2014, 06:15 AM


ikarus
Maybe ReliOn was already in the crapper to begin with. If their business is so valuable, why sell it for $4mm?
PLUG is probably also worth about $4mm, so that should be your main take away from the deal.

@ikarus, making waaaay too much sense here. wrong forum for that I guess. this forum is all about hype and

CleanEnergyNow
ReliOn was not hugely successful (hence the reasonable purchase price) but has some great IP that fits well
with some of what $PLUG wants to get into (TRUs, APUs, GSVs, etc.). But $BLDP will still be making most of
the stacks for $PLUG for some time to come. $PLUG has viable, disruptive technology that has already
identified a substantial market, created a popular product for it and has others in its cross hairs. I believe that
a short position is not wise at this time and respectfully suggest you convert to a long position and enjoy the
ride to $50 or above within three years (this is just me guesstimating, it could happen sooner or take longer)...

There is HUGE GROWTH AHEAD- Plug Sales forecast 100% percent year over year growth 2014 to 2018 
1997-2013 4000 fuel cells 
2014 4000 fuel cells 
2015 8000 fuel cells 
2016 16000 fuel cells 
2017 32000 fuel cells 
2018 64000 fuel cells 
2019 128,000 fuel cells 
Hydrogen fuel sales on 256,000 forklift fuel cells would be 380 million in hydrogen revenue alone. 
Actually these number are conservative.The international truck association predicts 90 percent of forklifts to be fuel
cell powered in 11 years. That means 5.4 million forklifts in 11 years. The numbers above would only give 256,000
forklift fuel cells to Plug in 5 years. That would be less than 5 percent penetration. See how large the numbers get. I
am not even including fuel cell numbers for TRU's,Electric Vehicle Range extenders, Air port tuggers and the

The truth is: The technology that $PLUG is selling is valid. It is truly revolutionary. They are not the only
company involved in this industry but it is an emerging growth area, that's for sure (IMHO). The industry has
an association that is working to support companies like $PLUG...

Not sure how the 2.5 value could be valid. Only way is when PLUG is at 25.0 they do a 10 for one split, not likely.


17 Apr 2014, 09:33 AM


CleanEnergyNow
Or maybe when it is at $250 and they do a 100 to one split? But we are not gong backwards from here, I don't
think. The only downside I see is if a large company acquires $PLUG, then we will all get compensated but
the growth phase will be much slower once we own shares of GE or Siemens or whoever buys it (instead of
$PLUG). But that's a year or two down the road, at least, I hope.

Times are a changing. Comparison to Plugs past does not work. Plug has a different business model than it did 3
months ago. In 2013. Plug had only one revenue stream and that was from Forklift fuel cells. In 2014 Plug developed
additional revenue streams: 
1)Stationary Fuel cell revenue (Relion purchase) 
2)Hydrogen Infrastructure revenue. 
3)Hydrogen Bulk Sales revenue 
4)Hydrogen Service revenue 
4)Fuel Cell Range extenders going commercial in Q4 2014 
7)Fuel Cell TRU's going commercial in 2015 
8) Air Port Ground support vehicles ???


It will take several quarters before these additional revenue streams start affecting the bottom line and accelerate
Plug's path to profitability.


Also the statement "Kroger, another marquee client, has been a customer since 2011 and has only 161 forklifts with
PLUG's solution" is not accurate since Kroger has ordered more than 600 additional fuel cells leapfrogging it ahead of
Sysco to become the 2nd largest user behind Walmart. Kroger has about 10,000 forklifts and has started conversion
of its forklift fleet.

5/23/2018 Plug Power: Unprofitable Past, Poor Fundamentals, And A Best-Case DCF Value Of $2-$2.50/Share - Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG…

Walmart has also started the conversion of its 40,000 fleet of forklifts. The initial order of 1723 was open ended (
Announced with great fanfare by Walmart in their February 2014 Sustainability conference) and additional sites are
being surveyed for conversion. Walmart projects cost savings of 3 to 7 million per distribution center over 6 years
following conversion to fuel cells. It is incomprehensible that Walmart the most cost conscious corporation would not
aggressively pursue those savings.


The figures for Mercedes are also not correct. In July 2012, Mercedes purchased 72 GenDrive fuel cells for the lift
truck fleet at its Tuscaloosa vehicle assembly plant. In August 2013 Mercedes-Benz ordered an additional 123 fuel
cell units to power new forklift trucks for its material handling fleet at a new logistics hub now under construction in
Tuscaloosa, AL This more than doubled their original order.


The main restraint to fuel cells is the availability of a nearby hydrogen source. 
Andy Marsh stated in his April 2014 business update that Plug would be building regional hydrogen distribution
centers to bring the hydrogen within reach of more of it's customers. The introduction of bulk hydrogen refueling
centers will open new markets for fuel cells where none have existed before.

Japippy@Aol.Com
Has anyone considered the fact that most companies do not make money for the first few years that they are in
business? 
Has anyone learned anything about the 100 + patents they have recoded with the U S Patent Office? 
Does anyone take into consideration the recent take over of the Re-Lion Company? 
Sounds to me like many of the respondents here are from Shortville U S A.  
Give this company a little time and it should start flying. Keep in mind most new ventures in business do not even last
5 years, and how old is Plug?

Has anyone considered that this thread is from 4/2 and maybe should stop necroposting in it?


Let it die already.

I think Japippy has good points and just because a thread is old we shouldn't try to stop people from posting.
SA can determine when a thread has "expired," making posts to it necrotic.

Purple_K
FWIW necroposting means keep the dead thread alive with pointless, irrelevant commentary. Which I realize
applies to 95% of posts about $PLUG, but srsly, there are newer threads to discuss. Nobody's trying to "stop"
anything, so calm your kittens. I'm just saying stop beating the dead horse.

Purple K and Kerridale are in a cahoots, they are not looking out for you

Purple_K
Im not sure what a Kerridale is, but SA knows that EquityTrader1975 is a sockpuppet for "JMstocks75" - a
guy I had banned for making unprovoked homophobic comments


(viewable here: http://on.fb.me/1lRHaq6 )


And you're right. Im not looking out for you - Im looking out for ME, which is how the market works. This isnt a
charity organization. Nor did I ever say I was looking out for anything but my own best interest.

reality is PLUG power bubble is bursting. I am quite surprised it even went to $11.
