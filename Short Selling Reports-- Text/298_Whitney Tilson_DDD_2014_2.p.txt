The Beginning Of The End Of The 3D Printing Bubble
Feb. 6, 2014 8:06 AM ET189 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Mark my words: Wednesday's blowup of 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) is the beginning of the
end for the 3D printing bubble (I'm short five stocks across the sector, the largest of which
is DDD).


I'm not the slightest bit inclined to cover any of these positions and, in fact, shorted a bit
more DDD as it bounced on the entirely predictable rush by analysts to reiterate their buy
ratings - "move along, nothing to see here" (more on this below).


3D printing is real, but the stock valuations aren't. For example, coming into today, DDD
was trading at 17x revenues. So now it's trading at 14x. So what? Even if DDD is
accounting properly for its nearly three dozen acquisitions in the past three years - which I
highly doubt - it's maybe worth 3x.


The story is the same for pretty much every company in the sector, which is in a
completely obvious and STUUUUUUUUUPID bubble.


It will never happen, but someday I wish the executives of a company like this were
injected with truth serum and then wrote the press release. For DDD's, it would read
something like this:


We're suffering from severe indigestion from our roll-up strategy, which got
completely out of control, leaving our company an unmanageable mess. Our
investments to drive growth are falling flat - in particular, our big push into the
consumer space is a total bust - so we are barely making our top-line guidance and
completely blowing our bottom-line guidance. In short, the wheels have completely
come off our bus.


But the last thing on earth we're going to do is admit this. Instead, to delay the
inevitable, we're going to trickle out the bad news and, like the wizard behind the
curtain, frantically pull every lever to keep the charade going as long as possible so
we can unload as much stock as we can.


Meanwhile, the "analysts", if injected with truth serum, would write:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1998081-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-3d-printing-bubble 2/41


Our confidence in this company and management team is pretty well shot - we can
see that the wheels have fallen off - but we don't dare stop pumping the stock
because then we'll lose the company's investment banking business. Though the
stock is down, it's still absurdly overvalued, so it's likely that DDD will do a bunch
more acquisitions to try to keep the game going - and that spells fat fees for us! So
we're going to keep pounding the table on this tub of crud until the last retail investor
has been sucked in and incinerated.


As an example of the contortions analysts are twisting themselves into to remain bullish,
consider this note from the Pacific Crest analyst yesterday:


While valuation is always challenging in this space, with DDD being perhaps the
most challenging, we still believe 3D Systems is the most innovative company in the
space, and we expect it to outgrow the industry. We see upside to $91, or 10x 2015
EV/sales; we are lowering our multiple to 10x from 11x to reflect lower earnings
leverage.


Wow, lowering the multiple of next year's revenues from 11 to 10 - how conservative!


By the way, was it really only last month that we were subjected to this foolishness at
CES? 3D Systems Appoints will.i.am as Its Chief Creative Officer. Here's a video of
will.i.am with DDD CEO Ari Reichental - it's high comedy! Talk about a great tell for a stock
about to crash - check out this stock chart of DDD over the past year:

Here's one more sign of a bubble: last week marked the launch of the first 3D printing-
focused mutual fund, the 3D Printing and Technology Fund (TDPIX). I'm not making this
up. Here's the web site, an interview with the manager, and the ad in last weekend's
Barron's:

Disclosure: I'm short five stocks across the sector, the largest of which is DDD.

Chan sometimes sees risks that others do not see. Here is one of the big risks that nobody talks about re: 3D
printing. Are you ready? What if a 3D printer starts printing other 3D printers and then competes with the
company that made it?

The already is one that does that and it's open source. Look up RepRap project. It's open source thus, not for
profit, but the problem is that many of the components can't be 3D printed.

I can't argue with valuations being high- I've been doing that (and avoiding the well-known players) for months.


I'm not sure the existence of a mutual fund with a 3D printing industry focus constitutes a bubble however, but as a
short it's understandable that you see things differently.


That said, there are some undiscovered true VALUE stocks in the 3D printing sector and I'll be introducing one of
them next week.

DDD messed up pushing into consumer machines...the money will be made on the industrial side.


Covered my short @ $55 but would like to get short again after the bounce. Some companies that create the software
and design programs are reasonably priced and more conservative bets on 3D printing. Long/short pairs could be a
good idea here.

@Gettin'Long. Last time I made that comment many flamed me for that. Getting into retail is too early. They
are light years away from StarTrek replicator. It is just a hobbyist product. It will be like those fitness
equipment that people buy and use a few times and forget about it. I don't expect any repeat sales.


They should focus on industrial manufacturing, tissue/organ printing, etc. Huge money can be made if you
can print organs.


07 Feb 2014, 06:09 AM


Steven Couche, Contributor
I agree. Biomedical applications seem very far away too though, at least 10 years. 
For consumer machines to gain traction, either the technology has to dramatically increase or the price has to
dramatically decrease, either of which will take 3+ years in my opinion. The other tricky part with consumer
machines is each owner has specific needs and creating a network of machines does not add value to each
individual machine, unlike early printers or cell phones. 
I won't buy one till it can make food I see on the Cooking Channel.

06 Feb 2014, 08:38 AM


fxfx
aapl has one of the lowest P/Es and unlike 3d-printing, it has indeed a consumer mass market. I am long
aapl. once the market's obsession with profitless revenue growth stops (it has barely started) stocks like aapl
will shine again and go through the roof, provided the company doesn't screw up until then. There aren't
nearly as many industrial uses for 3d printing as to justify the collective market cap of all 3d printing stocks.
Probably it doesn't even justify the current market cap of one of them .(of the larger players).

Apple are too arrogant. They think the customers are there to serve Apple, not vice versa. And that's wrong.
You cannot make the customers Apple-friendly. You gotta make Apple customer-friendly. If I was into shorting,
I'd short AAPL. Same like Blackberry, too full of themselves, and we know what happened to BBRY.

The dust will settle soon. Citron, Whitney, probably 7 or 8 more to come all jumping on the bandwagon to insure their
shorts make money. I'm outside looking in and will buy when the dust settles. It's easy to predict a fall in a stock's
price when the price has already crashed. 
AAPL was at 250 times earnings at one time and it was on the cutting edge of a new industry also.

The author's points are well taken but with all his shorts perhaps he is trying to make his perspectives a self fulfilling

While earnings may not be what people expected, revenues are still growing at around 50%. Are you saying revenues
will stall? Even with reduced earnings guidance you are looking at a forward PE half of the current. Is that obscene
given the rev growth? Also free cash flow growth has been good. If they had no revenue growth nor any earning
prospects I would agree, and the short term will see a lot of volatility. In the end there are still solid fundamentals in a
fast growing industry.

This rare vision of the future is what makes unimaginable things come real. These dreams are to be real in

only some to mention... Making the futuristic view become a reality make those who belive progress is not
good to become aware of possibilities. Happens in every technology jump. But they will have to jump off the
boat and sink in their statu quo.

13 Feb 2014, 02:59 AM


Lonnie Starr
In an industry that we know was growing increasingly competitive, and because early customer gains are easier to get
and to hold, than to try to pry away from the competition later. The company decided that, in this young and very
complex industry, they had better get cracking early on delivering tomorrows promise, than to simply keep booking
profits and later become a "me too" tag along.


Early investors had to pay a premium to get in early, and while the price has fallen on short term news, the engine that
made those premiums necessary is still running as hot as ever. Shorting this industry is nothing short of market
timing, pick your imagined high point and hope a short will work from there. Of course, that might work a few times,
but in the overall, it's a poor investment strategy, since shorting is not a sure thing, nor does it deliver much in the way
of profits as compared to going long.


As an example a 100 share buy at 69 way back before the split, yielded several thousands of dollar in profits, more
than doubling the cash invested. While this fall of 30 some point, for 100 shares shorted yielded only a paltry 3K LOL!
Sure I have paper losses of several thousands of dollars to show for holding tight, but, in the end, I'm still looking at
way more than the shorters profits per share in my tank.


With market expectations still putting high winds at my back, I believe we will recover those lost profits quite nicely
over the next few months, and there's always the prospect of the errant good new breaks spurring the rally even as
growth once again rears it's beautiful head.


In short, the longs will suffer less and win more than the bears over all. Of course, when investors talk, so much of it is
based on hindsight, one never knows what the truth really is, unless someone gives it away by some mistaken cite.
One thing we do know is, you cannot time the market effectively, and thus people who tell us they brought at the
absolute lows and sold at the absolute highs are only fooling themselves. Thus, I doubt sincerely that any short seller,
came in at the very top and sold at the very bottom. 
So, of the thirty some points the stock moved, short sellers on average, probably captured only about 2/3rds of it, and
that's if they were lucky.


Well, short sellers still have some 16 million shares sold on the table, I doubt they can close those positions profitably
anytime soon. But, if history is any guide, the drop in short interest from Novembers 27 million share high to
Decembers 15 million share low, had to be a hair raising ride as it took us from the 50's to the mid 90's. 2.599 billion
dollars changed hands yesterday, but the up volume exceeded the down volume, so I doubt that much of those short
positions could have been closed. Up dollar volume was 1.66 billion while the down dollar volume was a paltry 993
million. Meaning that even while shares were being sold off, the buying continued with renewed rapidity and vigor.

It's not all about bubbles, the sector has legs. Thus this is little more than a delightful buying opportunity come our
way. As far as company guidance is concerned, they're talking about their expectations of the future, based on what
they see today. Companies have been known to err in making too conservative predictions about the future. So it
does cut both ways. Good luck with the shorting, but I don't see enough bang for the buck, for shorting, to be of any
interest to me. It's a strategy that only works best when a company can't get out of it's own way. Worse yet, then
there's the margin calls!

now 3D printing is in everyones mouth shows the bright future of this technology, not only used by tech nerds. The
printing of polymers, metals and even organic materials opens up unforeseen possibilities. I'm not invested right now
in 3D-stocks but everyday surprised when hearing news of their technical possibilities. One thing is for sure: 3D-

printers ARE NOT in every household right now, people have to get accustomed to the new possibilities, have to
understand it's not magic. So you have to decide if you're trader or investor. Traders keep away from this stocks
please. You ruin this nice technology and the lifes of many developers. Investors: You should know the importance of
this technology, in the short term especially in industry, so invest! In Germany it seems almost every company has or
will buy a 3D printer. The style of this article alone still makes me laugh...STUUUUUPID. Enough said.

You may want to re-read for accuracy...and understand that DDD is trading at 17X REVENUE projrctions, not
EPS and the eps multiple is nearer 100X depending on how much margins get squeezed from "R & D"
spending.

Ouch. I feel sorry for people that believe the hype. This was the short of the year. It's going waaaaaay lower. DDD has
a largely undifferentiated product lineup in a nascent industry that has a low barrier to entry, and requires huge
efficiencies of scale and scope just to return it's cost of capital.


good luck longs, I'm afriad this sucker is doomed.

Why are we talking about valuation?! 3D systems is a growth company......what growth company has fundamental
valuation? The answer is none! I personally like what the company did by announcing its earnings expectations for
the year. To me it's brilliant.....expect less from us and maybe we will give you more! They are being realistic about
their growth approach! So yea shorts will make money.....but isn't that what the market is about? In the end longs will
make money too....cos the stock will bounce back in time. It's a fact.....trust me!

Yeah, look at the valuation of LNKD. DDD is not overpriced, definitely not for some $65.

It was too high, based on the time proven PE and PEG, at $57 when I sold my last position and it is too high now.

Author’s reply »  I think this comment pretty well captures the nature of those who are long DDD: "This article made
me almost choke on my food! A PE of 17 nowadays is miles away of a bubble"


DDD is almost entirely owned by retail investors who have been lured into a gigantic promotion engineered by
management and Wall St. "analysts" -- who are laughing all the way to the bank. Yet the retail investors fall for it
because they don't know the difference between a stock trading at 17x REVENUES vs. one trading at 17x after-tax
EARNINGS.


It saddens me to see people have their hard-earned savings incinerated in scams like this, which is why I'm trying to

I'm using the 3D printer to finally create some of my inventions that were cost prohibitive with injection
molding. Inside moving parts, single piece structure, so many possibilities. Not to mention having folks like
Kickstarter to help fund new companies. Most people are creative and innovative, or will learn that they could
be, thus the exponential possibilities when everyone has access. And we are talking world wide. 
So many machines now at a price as low as folks spend on TV's, video games, or sports equipment. Printbot
is only $299 ! 
I just do not see limitations here.

I like how shorters always say they are trying to "warn" investors like they are some kind of hero when in fact
they are putting money in their pocket and HURTING retail longs with all of their bashing articles.


Go ahead and keep hiding under the guise of "warning" investors if that makes you feel better. Were the
investors of NQ "helped" by short article writers? What about their "hard -earned savings incinerated" ?
(comment quote above)


No, they were not helped, a great company was temporarily hurt and so were it's long shareholders while
shorters profited, not to mention the fact that the company was tied up refuting countless bogus claims
instead of concentrating on running a profitable business with strong growth. And no, I don't hold a position in
3d's or NQ, I just had to speak my mind.


What a joke. Please sell it somewhere else.

Lots more chance to get burned with speculative stocks than with value stocks. How long does anyone putting money
into the stock market need to understand that? Money is too hard to come by to toss it away due to a hunch instead of
a prudent calculation of value, unless it is really gambling you want to do instead of investing. If gambling is the game,
fine, it is your money, but don't call it investing at 100X earnings and 17X revenues.

The thing is not every investor buys and holds forever. Most of us find a good entry point and trim our positions as we
profit and then even sell our entire positions when we feel the valuations are to rich. What is to rich? I don't know but I

Author’s reply »  I was at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month and spent a couple of hours in the
3D printing area of the convention hall, which had maybe 15-20 companies exhibiting. DDD’s booth was the largest
and it was filled with all sorts of printers, ranging from the new Cube (which it says will retail for under $1,000) on up.
The printers were all furiously at work – but doing little more than producing little plastic trinkets.


I’m a real gadget fiend so I was really expecting to find myself lusting after one of these machines, but was sorely
disappointed. I understand 3D printing’s usefulness for industrial uses like producing prototypes – a business that’s
been around for many, many years – but utterly fail to see any chance of widespread consumer adoption like. Yet the
hype and valuations in the sector presume that 3D printing is going to be as revolutionary as the iPhone or iPad. What
a crock!


My other big takeaway was the fierce competition – more than a dozen companies were showing off 3D printers that
appeared very similar to those of DDD’s. Heck, there was even a low-end, generic Asian manufacturer with a printer
for $499. In short, this looks like a business that is already becoming highly commoditized – which likely explains why
DDD’s margins have declined for each of the past two years – and are projected to decline further this year. DDD said
it’s because it’s making wise investments to tap the incredible growth opportunity, but I think it’s because its products
aren’t selling well and are facing stiff competition.


It was during CES that DDD announced it appointed will.i.am as its Chief Creative Officer. At that time (with the stock
near its all-time high), I wrote in an email blast to 3,000+ people:


This ranks up there with the silliest things I’ve ever seen. When (not if) this stock collapses, we’ll look at this as a sure
sign of the top… I challenge you to read the press release and keep a straight face. Here’s the beginning:


"3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) today announced that will.i.am, global entertainer, entrepreneur and philanthropist, joined
3DS as its Chief Creative Officer. In this leadership role, will.i.am will inspire, shape and drive all of 3DS' initiatives to
mainstream the use of 3D printing through major collaborations with creative brand partners, innovative global
campaigns and educational grand challenges designed to grow the popularity of 3D printing.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1998081-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-3d-printing-bubble 18/41


The addition of will.i.am to the 3DS team brings tremendous talent, vision and influence, and underscores the
company's commitment to democratize 3D printing. 3DS plans to leverage will.i.am's international creative industry
network to immediately extend its reach into select high-end fashion accessories houses, leading entertainment and
life style brands and key corporate sponsored educational and sustainability initiatives."


Note that will.i.am was an early 3D visionary, having featured a 3D Printer in his Dec. 2012 video for the song
"Scream and Shout" with Britney Spears. Alas, the printer used in the video was a MakerBot Replicator (MakerBot
was purchased by DDD competitor, Stratasys, last June): http://bit.ly/1eYe8OB


This deal reminds me of Blackberry’s deal with Alicia Keys, announced a year ago when BBRY was at $16.60. Here’s
an excerpt from an article about that debacle:


"When Alicia Keys was first named global creative director at BlackBerry on Jan. 30, 2013, much derision was made
at her expense for tweeting from an iPhone just days before the announcement – and maybe even once again a few
days after, in an apparent hack scandal.


But Thursday’s (Jan. 2) news that Keys was ending her one-year partnership with the brand comes at a time when
BlackBerry is the only party with egg on its face. The company is capping off a tumultuous 2013 that saw the
company seeking, and ultimately rejecting, a $4.7 billion takeover bid from Fairfax Financial Holdings, a house-
cleaning of its top executives, including CEO Thorsten Heins, chief marketing officer Frank Boulben and chief
operating officer Kristian Tear, among others, and the failed launch of the BlackBerry Z10, a would-be competitor to
the iPhone.


“BlackBerry and Alicia Keys have completed our year-long collaboration,” the company said in a statement Thursday.
“We thank Alicia for her many contributions including providing creative direction for the BlackBerry Keep Moving
Project which attracted more than 40 million visits, advocating for women in STEM and launching the BlackBerry
Scholars Program. We have enjoyed the opportunity to work with such an incredibly talented and passionate
individual.”


In the first few months of 2013, Keys was singled out as the latest in a trend of celebrities – particularly musicians –
taking on “creative director”-like roles at major brands like Diet Coke (Taylor Swift), MasterCard and Bud Light
Platinum (Justin Timberlake), Intel and Coca-Cola (Will.i.am), Monster Audio (Keys’ husband Swizz Beatz), and just
last month, PepsiCo’s Aquafina Flavor Splash (Austin Mahone). But just how meaningful were these partnerships,
which were carefully worded so as not to seem like glorified endorsements?"

Remember the first computers? Were as big as a room and had the memory of a cricket. Of course the
current printers are big, and slow, and doing plastic trinkets. :-) Yes, today. But in a few years? You'd say, wait

You may not understand the consumer opportunity...don't forget the millions of people who fall into the

Can you imagine, $500 just to cut paper?? 
Or think about all the "makers" who have stores on Etsy.com 
There definitely will be a consumer market for this technology. It may not be this company providing those

According to Yahoo Finance (YF), DDD has a PE of 143. I agree that valuation is high, however, YF has no
PE listed for Tesla and that has been rising. Nonetheless, Tesla has not risen without some severe pullbacks -
and I would not be surprised if more are likely to come. Such volatility is even more likely when the
fundamentals, such as PE, are opaque.


So generally, I support your thesis to the extent it says that the stock currently appears over valued. However,
I do no support your thesis that partnerships with artists might not be "meaningful".


This is because even if they are "glorified endorsements" and written poorly, artists, even local artists, often
disproportionately impact society. Best example might be Jay-Z and Samsung:

I haven't always agreed with the author in the past, although I do think he makes some fine points here (the Will.i.am
thing is Alicia Keys and Blackberry; the mutual fund is absolutely absurd when an ETF would have made more sense
and even that would have been a bit silly), but rather than shorting on the day a stock moved down more than 25% at
one point, perhaps a better tact would have been to wait a day or two for the dust to settle and the short
covering/upgrades/whatnot to cool off before beginning to leg in further with the short position? 
In a market that is desperate for growth stories (see also social media), the 3-D printing stocks have seen large
moves down before, only to be ramped again. I'm not sure that this is the end of the industry as an investment darling,
whether valuations make sense or not. Additionally, while valuation is astronomical, there's a real industry here whose
products will likely have implications for other industries (food, healthcare, etc) - if not DDD, then someone else -
perhaps HP makes its way into the industry? I mean, HP will probably make its way into the industry years too late,
but hey, they'll probably get to it at some point. 
I'd feel more comfortable being short any number of social media names that will likely be replaced by some other
"next big app/service/whatever" in the months and years to come.

SGLb is suffering from lack of news, a general market pullback and, 3D printing bashing. It is a good
company in development stage of 3D printing quality control software and sensors. Several companies have
an interest in this technology including GE for printing metal jet fuel nozzles because it adjust the printer to
account for warping while printing, it also save money on post production inspection and rejected parts. Now
is a great time to buy the stock as it is at its low resistance level and likely to shoot up as soon as it gets some
media coverage.

Very humorous, Whitney. Practical investors like Bill Gunderson claimed that they sold before the rollover. I don't
know, as this stock is really unpredictable. Right now the price is within a dime (10%) of Cree, another darling of the
nouveau tech crowd. Guess which one I'm in? Will tell when the dust settles. As a hobbyist who buys just about every
gadget on the market, guess which one I don't own? A 3D printer. An invention chasing for a killer application.

3D systems is worth every Bubble, as some ather 3D plays like STYS. Much to be released in near future. Every one
who sees the end of bubble: turn cup around, try to see an entry opprtunity that will not last long.  
3D is making a case for a long term company, one that has to pay a price for value: Patience is key. There is very few
discussing the potential of this industry. There is no argument to discuss how it could change industries. New
products, R/D is a key. DDD is paying the rpice for a bet on Research. Investors, usually dont like companies which
invest heavily in Research: It makes it riskier, and it makes results take a while.  
This is very simple: New products will make a technological difference. Mark my words

Nice analysis Whitney. Here's another bear issue... 
Most new technologies have their fastest gains in ability early on. After a while diminishing returns set in and things
become more stable. For example, PCs started in the 70s; by the 80s they were in widespread use. 3-D printing is not
a new technology; it's been around for over 30 years at least. If there were gains in its usability that would lead to
widespread consumer adoption, they probably would have come by now. 
Also, remember that there is a difference between microelectronics, where cost curves are continuing to come down
sharply, and human-scale engineering, where costs are pretty stable. The key to 3-D printing is a mechanical process
that cannot be minaturized. That's why the cost/capability of 2-D printers have not followed that of computers.

market picks back up with spy near 1770 here, then DDD might just pick back right up where it left off. my point. let

I don't think shorts know the meaning of Bubble. The company forecast $680-$720 million for 2014. The CEO said
they will double their revenue in two years organically. At current valuation that is about 6 times sales. This is a
tremendous growth for this company. Shorts are focusing too much on P/E. What's the P/E for facebook, amazon,
and netflix? And these companies are almost at their saturation point. 3D industry, on the hand is on the verge of
explosive growth. My only concern is that 3D systems shouldn't lose its competitive edge and for that I am glad they
are investing in R&D. The irony is that Citron earlier said that 3D systems is not spending enough on R&D and that
because of this reason, 3D systems will lose. So, in fact they are wrong on this. I would be buying on these dips, the
story is still intact. If you are shorts, I would be covering right now. Don't let one more Tesla repeat on you.

Latest Money magazine (January/February) listed DDD as one of 5 firms on the leading and cutting edge of
innovation. Notes that with a high valuation, volatility is a given but feels it is a company that is in the best position to
turn innovation into profits in their burgeoning field. Expects profits to rise 25% a year for the next few years. 
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan. "When you look forward, I really don't think it's a
question of if people will have 3D printers in the home, It's whether it will be in the garage or the kitchen"

Speaking of valuations, DDD has a P/E of ca. 140 and a P/S of ca. 14. And it's the biggest leading global 3D printing
company. That's not overvalued. Pricy, but not overvalued. Look at LinkedIn for example: P/E of ca. 800 and a P/S of
ca. 18. Now THAT'S overvalued. :-) No wonder they're down -10% afterhours.

Well ... if DDD is the leading 3D printing Company... then I can assure you one thing ... the 3D printing
industry has no Future!


DDD ... certainly brands itself as the leading 3D printing Company ... but that's far away from the truth.


3D printing will find an incredible number of applications in the industrial sector ... it will however not be a
mass product for retail Customers. DDD is promoting the retail Customer strategy ... which is flawed per-
definition. How many ppl do have a saw machine at home? ... ... 3D-printers should not be compared to
Ink/laser printers.


DDD ... is the most overvalued 3D company with a Mcap > 500m ...in the space! I would rather owns SYSS ...

I wrote DDD is the leader, now. Can it get overtaken? Sure. Can it be bought by HPQ? Sure. I agree that
industrial will have an edge over consumer, at least in the beginning. That's why I'm long XONE too. SSYS
with MakerBot is more heavy on the consumer side than DDD. DDD is the most diversified. So, I have DDD

I don't know if this has been mentioned by someone else (I did not go through the entire comments). The internet era
has ushered in what one may call in virtual corporations where few entrepreneurs, enthusiasts and backers join hands
to develop and promote specific products. One action taking place in this 3D is (one I know) http://bit.ly/1fLQRTK  
where one can put their hands on a 3D printer for $500. Look at the history how this has been made (few dreamers
using factories in China to produce the parts). In addition to the impact of this project on corporations such as DDD,
we can see the emerging trend as more and more engineers and entrepreneurs become comfortable with such a
model.

Hello 3D printing aficionados. I'm back. You may recall my posts in late 2011 and early 2012, warning everyone that
3D printing was and is nothing more than a scam. The consumer versions could only "print" trinkets then, can only
print trinkets now, and will only ever print trinkets in the future. The industrial versions are far too slow to ever replace
subtractive manufacturing processes. All versions are too slow to be economically viable. This is the Achele's heel of
3D printing.....lack of speed. Throw in a bit of creative accounting and hype, which was masterfully executed primarily
by DDD, the result is the mess we have today.


I applaud Whitney Tilson today and applauded Whitney Tilson over a year ago when he was one of the few voices of
reason. I'm now glad I took Whitney's and other's advice and got out with a healthy gain, while still missing out on a
lot of the upside.


If I were to hold up a convenience store and make off with $ 300.00 and get caught, I would spend time in jail and
have a criminal record for the rest of my life. The 3D sand baggers, Wall St. analysts/boiler room promoters who have
and are stealing millions are going to get off Scot free and laugh all the way to the tax haven bank located on an
island somewhere. I love unfettered capitalism. Don't you?


The people who perpetrated this scam should be in a cockroach infested jail. How about Guantanamo? Naw,
probably no cockroaches there.

Author’s reply »  I just realized what DDD reminds me of: Tyco! Such wonderful parallels – both have real underlying
businesses, but are in highly competitive industries, so how does management concoct a growth story to jack the
stock through the roof? Easy! Just acquire every company in sight, get very creative with acquisition accounting, and
then work closely with Wall Street’s finest to pump it up.


I think there’s a good chance DDD ends up the same way: a smoldering crater.

Whitney Tilson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  To those who wonder why I published this after the stock's fallen quite a bit, I have two answers:


1) I think it's as good a short now as it was at its peak a month ago (which is why I shorted more yesterday) because
now the momentum of the stock is broken and investor and Wall St. analyst confidence in management is shattered,
yet the stock's still absurdly overvalued; and


2) I've been pounding the table on this bubble for quite some time. I was early, but nailed the top. For example, this is
what I posted on the ValueInvestorsClub DDD message board on 1/4/14, with the stock at $96.42:


DDD now sports a $9.9 billion market cap and trades at 21x sales.


Think about the implications of this. I used to think that it's mathematically impossible for a company with a $10B
market cap and more than 10x sales (much less 21x) to ever be a good investment, but a few companies have
proved me wrong. They all have three characteristics:


1) They serve rapidly growing global markets;


2) They have winner-take-all (or at least most) business models; and


3) They have extremely "light" business models -- meaning they can scale globally with very little capital required.


The stocks of such companies can actually be cheap – even with big market caps and P/S multipes. Examples of
stocks that have done well subsequent to periods at which they were trading above 10x TTM sales and had market
caps in excess of $10B include Microsoft and Yahoo in the late 1990s (and Yahoo again in 2003-04), Amgen and
Biogen prior to around 2003-05, Adobe in 2000, Google, priceline.com and Infosys in the few years after their IPOs,
Qualcomm from 2001-2006, Salesforce.com at various points, as well as LinkedIn, Facebook, Baidu, Tencent, Gilead
Sciences for their entire existences. (Incidentally, Netflix, which I still own, has all of these characteristics I believe –
and trades at “only” 5.2x revenues; it was 1x revenues when I pitched it at the Value Investing Congress 15 months –
and a 7-bagger – ago.)


Note that every one of these 15 companies falls into two categories:


1) 11 are software/internet companies that don’t deliver a physical product – the lightest business models imaginable;
or


2) Four have intellectual property (three have patented drugs) that allows them to earn supersize profits (gross margin
in the 70-90% range and net margin of 20-30%). 
So now let’s apply this framework to 3D Systems. Re. #1, I’ll grant that 3D printing is a rapidly growing global market,
but the company utterly fails characteristics #2 and #3. It’s a highly competitive market with no winner-take-all
characteristics (though each company does have some IP) and DDD doesn’t have a particularly light business model
(certainly not when compared to the software and internet companies I cite above). (Incidentally, the same analysis
holds for Telsa, which I’m also short – it trades at 10.8x sales and is an auto manufacturer!)


In the past 20 years, DDD’s gross margin has only crept above 50% in the last two years, and its net margin has
actually fallen from its peak of 15.4% in 2011 to 11.0% in 2012 to 9.5% in the last 12 months. This is what investors
are playing 21x sales for?!


Mark my words: this will end very badly. I think DDD is maybe worth 2x revenues, so my price target is around $10 –
down nearly 90% from here.

For 3D printing to go down by 90%, 3D printing would need to terribly fail, and soon. Yes, the valuations are
high, as are the expectations. But I don't see the prices falling that much, more than they already have. I
reckon Revenues and Profits to increase at a higher pace than the stock price, lowering the valuations. But
then again, I'm not an expert like Whitney (or Chan :-))).

3D printing: Go in a restaurant and can't smell the food? That's because they don't hire chefs anymore, they hire

Whitney, if there is now only ONE fund in 3D printing, how is that a bubble? 10 funds, maybe, but one? Rather, it
points to the necessity to satisfy an exponentially growing demand.


About your criticism of will,i.am, you are ignoring the desires and the purchasing power of the folks under 40, plus the
general tone of folks outside the US.


06 Feb 2014, 07:46 PM


The Conservative Investor


To Whitney Tilson: You seem to have a history of great analysis but lousy timing. Shorting and covering NFLX from
2010 to early 2011 was a great example. You may be completely right in your thesis for the here and now but
completely wrong in the outcome tomorrow.


For growth stocks like those in the 3D printing sector, stratospheric valuations do not need to be analytically justifiable
in the short term if there is the potential for that company's products and services to revolutionize industry and society
in the long term.


Here is an example. When I used my first iPod a decade ago, it did not strike me in any way as being a revolutionary
product. It was simply more convenient than the alternative (an old beaten up Walkman). I thought the same when I
used my first Blackberry smartphone seven years ago. It was convenient, useful, and offered a service to me in a
pleasing package. Nowadays, everywhere you look people are staring at their smartphones and listening to music
from their iPods. The makers of these products – Apple and Blackberry – revolutionized their respective industries
and changed the world. So it will be for 3D printers and the companies that spearhead the industry and society wide
changes to come. People will buy them because they will make life more convenient, whether it’s to print their favorite
plastic figurines, their lunch, or their new heart.


Now ask yourself this question: If you could go back to the start of the millennium and invest in either Apple or
Blackberry, would you enter short?


06 Feb 2014, 07:46 PM


The Conservative Investor
Whitney Tilson's analysis was correct in this case.


If he entered short at the time of this article, when DDD was trading at $64.76 he would be sitting on a
considerable gain after nine months with DDD's current price of $35.37. If he shorted when the stock was in
the $90 dollar range then his timing was impeccable for this particular trade.


Hindsight is 20/20, but as DDD missed earnings and growth expectations the air deflated out of the bubble -
compounded by the company's propensity to generate debt and dilute shares to fuel its acquisition spree.

Former DDD stockholder, did sell out holding from 4 accounts starting at around $91 and the last batch around $89. I
was into DDD early on and benefited from the 3-2 stock split road the prices down and than up. DDD at one time
represented over 50% of my portfolio. 
I'm a believer in the 3D printing industry and even tried to become a dealer. My life has been spent in technology so
as a believer in 3D printing I figured I'd get in on the ground floor. Contact DDD and was put in touch with there local
Channels Manager. found out I had to buy the demo equipment - printers and materials - as well as set up a store
front. Big expense around a $400K investment. Decided I could do more with that kind of cash. 
Thus I brought the stock instead. I'm no longer interested in DDD as an investor.  
Good luck to you DDD longs. BTW incase you're interested, DDD books sales to dealers as if it were a sale to a
customer. And your required as a dealer to continue to buy materials and upgrade your equipment every few years.

If this is truly a bubble and it continues to burst then perhaps investors can sell and buy PHOT; once that bursts, if
anything is left one can just remove the H and buy some medicinal herb for the anxiety. 
Seriously though, I believe 3-D technology is here to stay. The stock and sector was overbought and needed a
correction but it will come back. I do have some worries that DDD might be losing focus by trying to do a little bit of
everything. A smaller, more focused, smarter company might just be a better play if one emerges. I sold DDD two
weeks ago but own CIMT and GGRGF currently. I am on the fence right now re. DDD.

Lonnie Starr
DDD is also adding a wide variety of strong support to their product lines, and that makes their products more
attractive than those of mfg's who can't offer such support. As the technology moves, so will owners need
support for software, converter software to make newer files work with their older machines, or to make data
packages from other vendors work with their machines. If you buy from a company that can't provide fixes,
converters, software and hardware upgrades, you may have to buy a new machine every year or so.


DDD also has an after market unit, to pass along hand me downs. It's the depth of support and ability to
function that makes the big sales to industrial users, so the new market entrants are focused on the nascent
consumer market. That market, by the time it grows to where it will support these new companies, they'll be
so cash starved they'll either be unable to provide support or they'll be gone.


People here talking about competition offering cheap printers, are not buyers of this technology, because if
they were, they'd be worried that the new comers might not be able to provide much support for their product.
Something you can be sure that DDD can and will do. More people buy windows because they know that
automatic updates are going to be available to fix problems that are discovered. With "BoB's" operating
system, you won't even find a registry cleaner or much of any kind of support when you run into problems.
Intelligent consumers who buy high ticket items always consider how much and how easy it will be to get fixes
and/or repairs. So that brand X 3d printer is more likely to end up in a closet or attic somewhere. If they user
needs a new one, they're probably going to look at DDD or SSYS for their next one.

It's interesting that Mr. Tilson posts this article as DDD is rising in price. The fact that by his own admission he is
heavily shorting the stock, posting the article just seems like a desperate move to protect his short position. The
market is the final arbiter. It's bigger than Mr. Tilson. Tilson has made his bed and now he has to sleep in it.

I don't believe him, he speaks much to glibly for a guy who has been meeting a constant rain of margin calls
over time, only to finally grab back a paltry few bucks after more than a 5 month wait. Were he really a
shorter, he'd be too depressed over his positions performance, watching longs gather boo coo bucks, while
his broker kept calling for him to add more dollars to his account to cover the rise, at the threat of having his
position closed for him. I know I'd be a nervous wreck. But noooo, now he's telling us he's increasing a
position that has failed to yield much, if any, profits over a very long time, in the hopes that the process won't
repeat. Worse yet, by Friday's close, he's already begun to pile up more losses. Unbelievable, if I was getting
the beating the shorters have taken so far, by now I'd either be long or be gone.

I would have to agree with you on this. One would have to close the position and wait for another run up
before shorting again, wouldn't you?

Let the shorts celebrate this round, they deserved it (only if they short above 80). I loss some money in the long, and I
won't blame the shorts, it is a fair game. 
Now I know about this a little better, I am not going to look at this with a 1, 3, or 5 years play, I don't have that EQ and
$$ on the volatility. It is a range play, with all the analysts coming out with buy ratings, I will not argue with them with
my money. Long below 55, short above 80 (using options).

Up>Down>Up>Do... All stocks do this dance. I see no reason to fret over it, this position is strong and
growing stronger day by day. Notice how much higher the "floor" is, than it was way back during the last
plunge? Hardly surprising, since there are more institutional buyers coming in, and they're paying the
premium to do so. The number of shares available to the retail trader is small and growing smaller all the
time. Because the institutions are grabbing large blocks of shares for their holdings. That new ETF that's been
announced will certainly need more than just a few thousand shares for their portfolio. So too, do the shorters
need some 16 million shares, go to the SEC and read the documents about the float and who holds how
much. That should be your guidance, better than someone posting missives and screeds about the high p/e.


At the rate the stock is recovering it's "overvalued" price premium, you'd have to be crazy to think that
institutions would abandon it and take profits. Obviously they expect even more appreciation to occur over
time.

Re Gorge, not pure-play, and 3D printing would be only a small fraction of their business and revenue. They
do robotics and safety systems. But, if you like robotics and safety, laced with a bit of 3D printing, go for it. But
they're not a "3D printing company" by definition or by default. It's a group of business, as the name implies.
Maybe Prodways does good, but what if the other group divisions do bad?

AMZN has an over 600 P/E (Yes P/E not P/R) and is still up over 533% in the last 5 years. It has NEVER made
money. But it IS the leader in the on line retail industry. And investors believe in its business model. Like McDonalds,
it will be damn near impossible to knock AMZN off its perch. DDD is in the same position as those two companies
were at the beginning. While it is inherently risky to invest in a young industry as the leaders have yet to be solidified
in the more mature industry, DDD is at the top right now, has the best game plan and if it can hold on to its position
(that's the risk), will be the AMZN of its industry. The industry has nowhere to go but up so being short 5 players is a
pretty "short sighted" position to hold (pun intended).

I think DDD will go to 30ish within 1/2 year, then stay there for a few months since people try to see if it will bounce
back. It will disappoint and drop to 20ish. That will be the bottom, but the bottoming process will take a while. After all,
DDD is not a dying technology. Big sharks like to rotate their money just like college assessment writing topics. If you

That's why I'm more on the industrial side. A 3D printer definitely uses much less power than an injection
molding machine, for example. A small "desktop" 3D printer, at the end of the day, shouldn't use more power
than a classic 2D inkjet printer tho, in my opinion.

twhite113 sorry but a little loss of vision....There is much more about 3 D then making a trinket! How
about..saving time...saving labor cost..able to make something needed that is not longer in production..able to
make some things cheaper..able to make something when you need it now...something that is not now in
production.. 
Military ...Industrial....Dentist Offices..Doctor Offices...Medical Research...Aircraft Industry and now even
Candy making..... and many other practical uses.... 
3D has been around since the late 1980s I believe but have progressed to a place now that opens much
more potentials..Even now dentist offices make their own crowns... 
Technology will cut the costs and it has already started. Soon large companies like HP and others will be
producing these at even lower cost. 
So I guess twhite113, I look at 3D as I look at what has happened with the technology and cost of whatever
machine or item you wrote your comment and viewed this website...The Future!

Correct. The telephone has been around since 1876, so why are people buying Apple iPhones and Samsung
Galaxies now, almost 150 years later? GPS navigation has been around since 1973, so how come it went
mainstream only some 10 years ago? Wireless has been around since 1891. But other than the radio,
modern wireless has been around only some 15 years. Same with 3D printing; yes, first appeared in the
1980s, but didn't become practical and commercially available until some 5 years ago. And yes, the first
working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of DDD. They're the true pioneers. But until recently,
there was no capability to go mainstream. Mainstream 3D printing had prerequisites that had to happen too.
And as they clicked into place some 5 years ago, 3D printing came out of the science labs into the
commercial world.

You couldn't have commercial mainstream 3D printing without today's computers, software, and the internet,
among other things. And if the phone evolved from "acoustic telegraphy" to today's smartphone, where do

Thanks ECapo, and I apologize for being flippant. However, aren't consumer level printers (not industrial) still
pretty much novelties? Also, no one has refuted my premise that they take large amounts of energy...do you
have a comment about energy consumption? I am under the impression that 3D is geared toward the retail
buyer at this point, where I think energy usage is very relevant for demand. Thanks


15 Feb 2014, 08:39 AM


Lonnie Starr
Whether a person is a hobbyist or a tinkerer (someone who tinkers with things in an attempt to either perfect,
improve or merely understand their performance) the focus is on what they can do and not on how much
energy it consumes, unless that energy consumption is unaffordable, which would rarely be the case.


In this event, a person would need a new part for a model, or be seeking to replace a part that had failed or
been destroyed. The means, time and costs of obtaining the part is of little concern when the necessary part
is highly desired. Say a model ship needs a new mast for it's main sail, or a new figurehead for the bow,
energy consumption on a per piece basis could run quite high and still be acceptable. Since the fact that the
part can be made at all, in house, is more attractive than to order out and pay shipping and handling, and the
time spent waiting for the part to arrive.


Researchers and engineers as well as others who work with various machines, microscopes, such and the
like, need parts as quickly as they can get them, and cost isn't that much of an issue as long as doesn't
exceed a certain dollar amount. Where ordering out would probably cost several dozens of dollars and take
perhaps a week or two to turn around, 3d printing that part might consume 10 or 20 dollars worth of electricity,
that would hardly be a barrier to printing in house.


The basic idea is that this alternative has not before been an option. All parts had to be ordered out, and the
wait for shipping turnaround had to simply be endured. But with machinist and foundry costs for casting and
finishing being what they are, mainly high for fewer pieces, because the initial costs are high and only
attenuated by orders with longer runs, this then becomes an attractive alternative, no matter what the energy
consumption might be.


Same goes for more complex fabrications, that might require that several molds be cast and several parts
finished. Where 3d printing them does it all in a single process, that can be performed on site. Giving the user
access to almost whatever designs they can dream up, in a matter of minutes or hours, makes the entire
world of discovery move along that much faster.


Storage rooms are full of machines that lack retaining rings, gears, control knobs and other parts, without
which they cannot function, now they can be easily repaired and put back into service or sold in functioning
shape. Energy consumption would be a small matter if 20 or 30 dollars worth of electricity were needed to put

a telescope back into serviceable shape, especially one that could be worth as much as several hundred
dollars to replace.


So, your question about energy consumption doesn't come into play, unless and until long runs are needed.
But at this stage of the game, long runs are not the target of the industry as yet.

Is there any way to determine what the adoption rate is by end users? If sales are mostly to an ever increasing
number of unwitting distributors without a congruent adoption rate by end users, we basically have an industry that is
filling a finite pipeline. The pipeline can only increase by adding more unwitting distributors who may have been
seduced by the hype associated with the 3D printing industry.


I suspect that end user adoption may not be keeping up the distribution network that has been and is being created. I
would love to hear from a distributor or two to find out how sales are progressing at their level. For example, Staples
carries a line of consumer printers. How are sales of 3D printers at Staples advancing? For the professional lines of
3D printers, what is the adoption rate by end users?


The adoption rate by end users at the consumer and professional level will tell us more conclusively the long term
prognossis of the 3D printing industry, not sales to distributors.


08 Feb 2014, 03:33 PM


temenem
Remember, almost NOBODY owns a 3D printer at home. So even minimal adoption rates would mean a lot.
For example, there are some 120 million households in the US alone. Let's say that only 1%, 1 out of 100
households, gets 1 single 3D printer. That's 1.2 million printers straight up. The jumps are huge when you're
starting from scratch.

I think the article has some interesting points, however I believe the 3D printing industry has a lot of potentials that
have yet to be discovered. Trying to estimate the industry and valuation in it's infancy stage is a fools game.
Healthcare and aerospace seems to be the leading categories in terms of disruption, but this is just the beginning.
The estimates can only go up from here which will only make the valuations seem cheaper.


I was trying to find the 13F filings for your fund but realized it's not large enough to meet the filing requirements. If
Whitney truly believes in a 90% drop in DDD it would make sense if he had a majority of his fund short it. it almost
seems like a no brainer right? I mean it's a guaranteed 90% drop and mathematically impossible for DDD to be doing
this. However, If it's a small portion of his portfolio and yet he still wrote such a bold article, it's an obvious scare tactic
which is a pathetic move.


It's important to read some of his past work and compare it to what he's writing now. He did something similar with
netflix and more recently with green mountain coffee. If you read his article about green mountain coffee he was sure
it was doom and gloom when it was in the sub $50 levels and made it one of his largest short positions which was
only 2.2% of his portfolio. Again big statement small action.

I don't see any "momentum" here to be broken. All I see is a steady accumulation by small, individual investors who
have read and buy into the longer term promise, and therefore have decided to pay the premium, as the price to get in
as early as they can and before much of the actual promise arrives. Nor are they alone, these retail investors,
because institutions are also deciding to pay this premium as well.


To be sure, institutions with there expertise and experienced people, are buying on the dips, but nevertheless they are
still paying the premium, as the stock has not dipped enough to erase it. Meanwhile, as time goes by and more
investors become aware of the technology and the promise it holds, as their dd reveals to them the facts about the

3D printing is a rapidly growing sector that is gaining momentum. The shorts keep quoting technicals that are
better suited to established sectors with lower growth as a reason that stocks are overpriced. As technology is
consolidated and refined, the price, speed, and quality of goods will be improved prompting increased sales
of printers and supplies. They like to point out that 3D printing has been around for over 30 years but fail to
mention that plastic printing was only started in 1990 and production quality capable printers have only just
become available with an ever broadening range of materials. By contrast the first transistor computer was
designed in was designed in 1956, the first Apple 1976, and the first iPhone in in 2007. 3D printing is just
getting started, don't let the unimaginitive technical traders keep you out of the next greatest investment
opportunity with scare tactics.

position, in cash, in his account at all times. His broker will call him (margin call) and ask him to make up any
short fall by some arbitrary time, largely based on how valuable his portfolio is. If he cannot raise the cash, his
broker has free reign to buy in the position and then sell off any stock(s) in his portfolio, sufficient to make up
any shortfall that comes from buying in the position. So, he's lost more than 30% on this trade.


I'd be a nervous wreck if that happened, most especially if it happened time after time after time. Click on his
handle to see what other recommendations he's been making over time, you'll probably conclude that he's not
the go-to-guy for analysis.

This article and the company's valuation reminded me of one of my favorite quotes from Scott Mcnealy of Sun
Microsystems in 2002, "“But two years ago we were selling at 10 times revenue when we were at $64. At 10 times
revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That
assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a
computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay
no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that
assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that,
would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t
need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”
