China Metal Recycling Holdings Ltd. (“CMR” or the “Company”) purports to be the largest scrap 


metal recycling company in China.  We believe that this is a lie.  Publicly accessible import data 


from the Chinese government suggests that CMR is a blatant fraud that has deceived the market 


about the size of its business.  


1. CMR is Nowhere Near its Reported Size.  Multiple independent sources show that CMR 


could not be sourcing anywhere close to the volume of scrap necessary to produce its reported 


volume of processed metals. 


a. MEP Import Data Indicates Fraud.  Publicly available data from the Chinese Ministry 


of Environmental Protection indicates that CMR has never been legally allowed to import 


more than 87,500 tons of non-ferrous scrap metal in any year, even though the 


Company would have to be importing an average of ~120,000 tons of non-ferrous 


scrap per month in 2011-2012 (~ 1,440,000 tons per year) to produce its reported 


output.  


b. Customs Data for Copper Imports Indicates Fraud.  Similarly, in order to produce 


CMR’s reported volume of copper, CMR would need to import ~113,000 tons of scrap 


copper per month, which would make it by far the largest scrap copper importer in China.  


Yet 2011 and 2012 customs data shows that CMR is not even in the top 10 of monthly 


scrap copper importers, and that Chiho-Tiande (HK: 0976), a competitor supposedly 1/5
th


the size of CMR (measured by sales), is listed as the top importer each month. 


c. All the Scrap in China.  In order to produce CMR’s reported volume of processed 


copper, CMR would have to account for 34% of all imported scrap copper and over 50% 


of the domestic scrap copper market in 2012.  Such a market share is not plausible.


2. Sales to Top Customer Highly Suspicious.  For the Company’s financials to be believed, 


CMR would have to account for 84% of the non-ferrous metals supplied to its largest 


customer (a Guangzhou state owned enterprise) in 2011, a level of supplier concentration we 


find highly improbable.


3. Fictitious Financials.  Many of the Company’s key financial and operational metrics deviate 


so significantly from other scrap metal recyclers that its reported performance defies 


credibility.  


a. Suspiciously Amazing Growth Rate.  CMR’s revenue and EBITDA growth from 2006-


2011 was more than twice its nearest competitor, even though the Company’s spent less 


on capital expenditures than its peers and its capacity utilization was strikingly low.

HK: 0773


b. Revenue per Employee Figures Not Credible.  CMR claims to generate $US 11 million 


of revenue per employee, a worker productivity rate that is 10x higher than all of its 


major industry peers and 6x higher than the revenue per employee generated by Apple (~ 


$US 2 million per employee), generally regarded as one of the global leaders in yield per 
employee.  This is simply not believable. 


c. Inexplicable Inventory Turnover.  CMR claims to turn inventory five to six times as 


fast as Chiho-Tiande, its closest domestic competitor.


d. Madoffian Return on Capital.  The consistency of CMR’s return on capital through the 


2008 financial crisis bears more resemblance to Bernie Madoff's fabricated returns than 


the returns generated by a highly cyclical scrap metal business during a commodities 


crash. 


4. Woe be the CFO.  Only six months after the Company’s initial public offering, CMR’s CFO 


abruptly resigned on the grounds that the board of directors failed to address concerns over 
potential improprieties that he brought to the attention of the audit committee and denied him 


access to CMR’s financial records.   


5. Chairman Cashing Out.  On January 25, 2013, CMR announced that its Chairman, CEO and 


founder, Chun Chi Wai, entered into an agreement with a state-owned enterprise to sell 56% 


of his shares in the Company.  When the man who knows the most about CMR cashes out of 


the majority of his shares, investors would be wise to heed his example.  We believe that there 


are two possible explanations for this transaction: either the purchaser is another victim of 


CMR’s deception, or officials at the state-owned enterprise are corrupt and thus complicit in 


the fraud.         


6. Valuation. As of June 2012, CMR had HKD 5.7 billion of bank debt outstanding, the 


holders of which would take priority over shareholders.  Because we believe that the 


Company has significantly overstated its sales, we doubt the authenticity of its reported 


receivables and inventory.  The book value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment 


is only HKD 460 million, so even after senior secured bank creditors seize CMR’s fixed 


assets, such creditors would still be owed over HKD 5 billion!  After senior secured debt 


holders, local Chinese unsecured creditors with priority over Hong Kong shareholders are 


owed roughly HKD 10 billion.  The Company’s heavily levered balance sheet and the scale 


of its deception suggest that shareholders will be left with nothing. We therefore put a price 


target on CMR’s shares of HKD 0.00.

Glaucus Research Group California LLC is an investor in the public markets.  We conduct exhaustive due 


diligence inquiries into public companies by studying publicly available records, market research and 


financial statements.  After we have conducted our research, fieldwork, and analysis, we may (or may 


not) take trading positions based on the results of our inquiry.  


In some cases, we publish our research opinions to the public through our blog 


(www.glaucusresearch.com). What we publish is our opinion, and we provide all of the facts and 


evidence that support and underlie our views and our investment thesis.  We clearly disclose any bias that 


may exist due to our having a short position in the researched company.  We are not registered as an 


investment analyst in the US or in Hong Kong, nor are we required to be.  We are based in California, and 


we study and analyze stocks trading in markets around the world.


Often our due diligence and analysis takes many weeks, sometimes many months, depending on the 


volume of publicly available information, the complexity of the financial statements, and the level of 


analysis and modeling required to get to the truth about a company’s business.  


However, in some cases, conclusive evidence of fraud is so blatant that it requires little advanced 


level of financial or accounting acumen or sophisticated modeling to reveal the truth.   We believe 


that China Metal Recycling (“CMR” or the “Company”) is one such case.   


CMR once claimed to be a small business with plausible financial metrics, a believable market share (~5-


6%), a reasonable percentage of the copper supply chain for its largest customer (5%) and a reported 


volume of scrap metal imports that was near the volume of scrap metal import quotas granted to the 


Company by the Chinese government.   


But since it went public on the Hong Kong exchange, we believe that CMR’s lies have become bigger 


and bigger, building upon each other until they formed an unstable tower of fabrications that is rotting 


from the inside.  Today, the Company is deeply in debt.  Today, the Company claims to import a volume 


of scrap metal that is ~3500% (2011) greater than it is legally permitted to import by the Chinese 


government.  Today, CMR claims to supply 84% of the copper purchased by its largest customer, a level 


of supply chain concentration that defies credibility.  Today, CMR’s implied share of the scrap market has 


become so absurd that it is simply unbelievable.  


We therefore believe that tomorrow, or someday soon, the SFC will halt trading of CMR’s shares, the 


exchange will delist the Company, and the authorities will prosecute those persons at the Company who 


have engaged in the fraud, and possibly also bring enforcement actions against the promoters of the 


Company and others who have facilitated the Company’s conduct, and who perhaps themselves 


participated in or benefited from it. Finally, we hope that the investors who have been victimized by the 


Company’s fraud will receive restitution as a result of CMR being brought to justice.

CMR IS NOWHERE NEAR ITS REPORTED SIZE


Publicly available data from the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection and Chinese customs 
records suggest that CMR imports a far smaller amount of scrap metal than the Company claims.  We 
believe this is clear evidence that CMR is exaggerating its revenues and the scale of its business.


CMR purports to be the largest scrap metal recycling company in China. 1 The Company’s revenue 
streams can be divided into three categories: ferrous metals (iron and steel), non-ferrous metals (mainly 
copper, aluminum, stainless steel) and other materials (ores, scrap plastics etc…).  The sale of non-ferrous 
metals (~95% of which is comprised of copper2) reportedly accounts for ~80% of the Company’s revenue 
and is the primary driver of its spectacular revenue growth. 


The scrap metal recycling business is fairly straightforward.  CMR purchases scrap in the form of 
household appliances, junk cars, old equipment and solid waste from the construction and manufacturing 
industries.  CMR then uses heavy equipment, giant shredders and manual labor to separate the scrap into 
its various metal components to produce metal products that meets its customers’ needs in terms of size, 
purity and other requirements.  


In this report, we will refer to the ratio of usable metal (i.e. finished product) to raw scrap intake (i.e. the 
input) as the ‘yield.’ According to Minmetals Futures (a futures broking firm owned by China Minmetals 
Corporation),3 the average yield for scrap imported into China is 30%.  In other words, for every ten tons 
of scrap copper imported into China, a business like CMR strips out three tons of usable copper.  The 
yield for businesses located in the United States such as Sims Metal is typically higher (75-90%) because 
most scrap originates in the United State or Europe, so companies in those markets get first pick of the 
high-yield scrap, whereas the low-yield scrap is generally sent to China where lower labor and energy 
costs make it possible to profitably recycle it.   


In order to calculate the amount of raw scrap that CMR would have to purchase in order to produce its 
reported sales volume of processed metals, we can simply divide the Company’s reported sales volume 
(in tons) by the assumed yield, in this case 30%.  The table below shows the results of our calculations for 
2006-2012.

such imports over this period. This is obviously not plausible, and we will show why in this report.

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA METAL RECYCLING HOLDINGS LTD


CMR purportedly imports 50% of its non-ferrous scrap metal because the domestic scrap metal market is 
small, fragmented and insufficient to meet demand.4 If we assume a yield of 30% (which is the average 
yield on imported scrap for Chinese recycling companies), it means that CMR would have had to import
an average of ~120,000 tons per month5 of non-ferrous scrap over the last two years to produce its 
reported amount of processed non-ferrous metal.   Considering China imported a total of ~400,000 tons 
of non-ferrous scrap per month in 2011-2012, CMR would have had to account for over 30% of all 


6  


But what makes CMR’s case so unusual is that even if we make an extremely generous (and implausible) 
assumption in favor of the Company, and assume that CMR’s yield is 90% (meaning it would have one of 
the highest yields of any major scrap recycler in the world), data shows that the Company is nowhere 
close to importing the required volume of scrap necessary to produce CMR’s stated volume of 
processed metals.  It is important to note a 90% yield assumption is patently absurd considering the low 
quality of scrap metal typically imported into China and the low average yield of Chinese recyclers 
(30%).  Yet even under this extreme and generous assumption, the Company would have to import an 
average of ~39,000 tons of non-ferrous scrap per month7 for its financials to be true.  Independent 
data shows that CMR is nowhere close to importing even this volume of scrap.

1) Ministry of Environmental Protection


The Ministry of Environmental Protection (“MEP”) tightly regulates scrap metal imports into China. 
Each year, the MEP publishes a list 8 of companies authorized to import non-ferrous scrap into the 
country.  The MEP also maintains a separate public database containing the authorized import quotas for 
each such entity, which can be found at this website (datacenter.mep.gov.cn) and accessed by any 
investor or regulator.  Below is a screen shot taken of the database.9

The MEP quota database (datacenter.mep.gov.cn) includes each company’s quota for materials imported under the 


automatic licensing administration (scrap iron, steel and copper fragments) and for materials imported under the 


restricted licensing administration (scrap wires, appliances and electrical equipment).  This distinction is explained 


on page 141 of CMR’s prospectus.

We checked the MEP database for the import licenses of each CMR subsidiary.  According to the MEP
database, it appears that only the following CMR subsidiaries are permitted to import non-ferrous scrap 
and only in amounts not to exceed the following quotas: 


These numbers should shock anyone familiar with the Company.  According to the MEP’s database of 
import quotas, CMR has never been legally allowed to import more than 87,500 tons of non-ferrous 
scrap metal in any year, even though the Company would have to be importing an average of 
~120,000 tons of non-ferrous scrap per month in 2011-2012 (and 1,440,000 tons per year) to produce 
its reported output.  


CMR states in its Global Offering that its ability to import scrap metal is determined by the MEP’s import 
quotas and that, as of June 3, 2009, the MEP had authorized import licenses to CMR’s subsidiaries 
Guangzhou Asia Steel and Tianjin Yatong. 10 This corroborates the information found in the MEP 
database which lists Guangzhou Asia Steel and Tianjin Yatong as the primary importing subsidiaries in 
2009 (the Ningbo Yagang facility became operational in Q3 2009 after the Company went public) and 
confirms that by its own admission the Company is not importing scrap metal under a different name or 
illegally circumventing the quotas.11  


Yet since 2007, CMR import quotas are tiny compared to the volume of scrap it would have to import for 
its reported non-ferrous metal production to be true. The following table shows the discrepancy between 
the import quotas found in the MEP database and CMR’s purported volume of imported non-ferrous 
scrap since 2006.

The data is clear.  CMR cannot legally import anywhere close to the volume of non-ferrous scrap required 
to produce its reported volume of processed metal.  Recently, it appears that the lies have gotten more 
egregious, as the Company’s reported imports of non-ferrous scrap metals exceeded its 2011 and 
2012(annualized) quotas by 3491% and 1904%, respectively. 


Even making the ridiculous assumption that CMR’s yield of metal to scrap is 90%, which as we discussed 
above is far too charitable to the Company, CMR cannot legally import even close to the required volume 
of scrap (as we show in the following table).  


We are confident that the MEP database is a reliable source because we performed the same exercise for 
CMR’s competitor, Chiho-Tiande (HK: 0976) (“Chiho-Tiande”) and the quotas listed in the MEP 
database essentially matched the quotas stated in Chiho-Tiande’s Global Offering and exceeded (instead 
of the other way around) the volume of scrap that Chiho-Tiande claims to import into China.  We 
summarized the data in the table below.  


There is little difference between Chiho-Tiande’s reported quotas and its quotas listed in the MEP 
database, suggesting that the MEP database is a reliable source for a company’s maximum import 
volumes.  Moreover, Chiho-Tiande does not claim to import more scrap metal than it is legally allowed.  
Rather, it appears that Chiho-Tiande is typically importing 59-92% of its licensed amount each year.  This 
makes sense: actual imports should not exceed import quotas. 


Compare Chiho-Tiande’s import data to CMR’s data. CMR cannot legally import anywhere close to the 
volume of non-ferrous scrap that it needs to generate its reported output.  We believe that this is 
compelling evidence that CMR is vastly exaggerating the volume of its sales and the scale of its business.

Do not take our word for it. The MEP database is publicly available online at this website
(datacenter.mep.gov.cn).  For your convenience, we have also downloaded the contents of MEP database 
and uploaded the data to a file on our website, labeled CMR Supplemental Data (available here). We 
therefore urge regulators and investors to check the database independently. 


2) Copper Customs Data Corroborates Our Conclusion


Independent data on scrap copper imports, sourced from Chinese customs records, corroborates the 
information from the MEP website and confirms that the Company is not importing anywhere close to its 
reported volume of scrap metal.


Scrap copper accounts for approximately 95% of the Company’s non-ferrous metals sales,12 half of which 
is sourced through imports.13  The following chart shows the breakdown the amount of scrap copper that 
the Company would have to import, given a market standard 30% yield, to produce its reported volume of 
finished copper. 


For the Company’s financials to be true, the Company would have to import an average of ~113,000 
tons of scrap copper per month in 2011 and 2012.14  Again, independent data shows it is nowhere 
close.   


Asian Metal (www.asianmetal.com) is a specialized metal and steel data research company based in 
China. Asian Metal has a distribution agreement with the Chinese government and each month it 
publishes a list, based on Chinese customs data, of the top ten importers of scrap copper. As an example, 
we include the three most recent top ten lists that were available (each of the top ten lists that we could 
obtain from 2011 and 2012 are included in Appendix I at the end of this Report).

To produce its reported volume of processed copper, CMR would have to import an average of
~113,000 tons of scrap copper per month in 2011 and 2012, which in turn would have made it by far 
the largest importer of scrap copper for each month during that period.  


Yet, if we look at the Asian Metals lists of top ten importers of copper for 18 of the past 24 months (the 
other months were not available),15 a CMR subsidiary only appeared in the top ten list once in eighteen 
months (September 2012 – pictured above), and then, only in tenth place!     


In its only top-ten appearance, customs data from Asian Metal showed that CMR imported a paltry 7,751 
tons of scrap copper in September 2012, even though the Company implies to have been importing 
almost an average of ~113,000 tons on average per month at this time.   


Not only is CMR noticeably absent from the customs data on major copper importers, but its competitor, 
Chiho-Tiande, was the #1 importer of copper every month, even though it is supposedly 1/5th the size of 
CMR (measured by reported non-ferrous metal sales).   In fact, Chiho-Tiande was the top importer of 
scrap copper during this period, accounting for 13% of the market in 2011 and 12% in 2012. If CMR
were really importing the volume of scrap copper that it claims, it would appear at or near the top of the 
Asian Metals top ten lists.

Even if we give the Company the benefit of the doubt and assume a yield of copper to scrap of 90%, 
which again is unheard of China, CMR would still have to be importing ~37,000 tons of scrap per 
month16 in 2011-2012 (see chart below) in order produce its reported amount of finished copper.   


The customs data from Asian Metals corroborates the conclusion that we draw from the MEP database: 
that CMR is fabricating the volume of its import, the size of its sales and the scale of its business.  


We believe that the SFC should confirm the findings set forth above, which are publicly available from 
both the Ministry of Environmental Protection and from Asia Metals, and then halt the trading of CMR’s 
stock to protect investors in the Hong Kong markets from further losses.

3) CMR’s Implied Market Share is Ludicrous


In order to produce CMR’s reported volume of processed copper, CMR would have to account for 34% of 


chart, we calculate CMR’s implied market share (assuming a 30% yield).


If regulators and investors were to take the Company’s reported production volumes at face value, CMR
should be importing almost 34% of the copper coming into China in 2012.  We know from the Asian 
Metals customs data that the top ten importers of copper combine to account for 30% of the copper 
import market.  In other words, there is no way that the Company alone accounts for 34% of China’s
scrap copper imports. 


Furthermore, CMR would also have to account for 56% of China’s domestic scrap copper supply.  Not 
only is it implausible that CMR purchases over half of China’s domestic scrap metal supply, but even 
the Company admits that such level of concentration does not exist in China’s fragmented domestic 
market.  CMR states in its prospectus that “copper resources are in relatively short supply in china, with 
domestic copper ore resources characterized by small scale miners, low grade ore, ore deposits mined for 
other minerals and high exploration costs.”17

VOLUME TO LARGEST CUSTOMER HIGHLY UNLIKELY


Publicly available data provides another data point suggesting that CMR is fabricating the scale of its 
business.  For the Company’s financials to be believed, CMR would have to account for 84% of the non-
ferrous metals supplied to its largest customer (a Guangzhou state owned enterprise), a level of supplier 
concentration we find highly unlikely.


CMR’s largest customer for the last six years is Guangzhou Iron & Steel Enterprises Group (“GISE”) 
(www.gise.cn), which the Company confusingly refers to in its filings as ‘GSEG’ (even though its actual 
initials are GISE).


18
  


According to the Company, sales to GSEG were “mainly attributable to non-ferrous metals sales.” In the 
table below, we estimate the reported volume of non-ferrous metals that CMR has sold to GISE since 
2006.


Because GISE is a state-owned enterprise based in Guangzhou, its financials and production data are 
published annually by the Guangzhou Municipal Government in the official Guangzhou Yearbook.  
According to the Guangzhou Yearbook, GISE has three main subsidiaries: 


1. Guangzhou Iron and Steel
2. Guangzhou Zhujiang Iron
3. GISE Nonferrous Metals Group 


GISE discloses production figures for three categories: steel, steel materials and non-ferrous metals. All 
of GISE non-ferrous production volume comes from the GISE Nonferrous Metals Group, which also 
discloses, separately, detailed production figures for major categories (electrolytic copper, non-ferrous

The table below includes GISE non-ferrous metal production figures, which are publicly available and

We are highly skeptical that CMR could go from a marginal supplier of 5% of GISE’s non-ferrous metals 


in 2006 to supplying 84% of its non-ferrous metals in 2011.  We are also skeptical that CMR’s share of


the state owned enterprise’s non-ferrous supply increased sixteen times in five years, especially 


considering that GISE’s non-ferrous production declined significantly during that period.

FICTITIOUS FINANCIALS


A common denominator of companies that have collapsed under allegations of fraud is that their 
performance appears too good to be true. CMR is no different. 


Recycling scrap metal is not rocket science.  CMR does not possess any notable technological advantage 
over its peers.  In fact, most of its domestic and global competitors have much more experience in the 
business than CMR.  


Yet CMR claims to be the industry leader in almost every financial metric, including growth, capital 
efficiency, employee productivity, inventory turnover, sales prices and returns on capital.  A quick tour of
the Company’s financials shows its books do not pass the smell test.  The raw data for each graph in this 
section can be found in Appendix II.


1) Suspiciously Amazing Growth Rate


First, the Company’s revenue and EBITDA growth from 2006-2011 is simply unprecedented and bears 
no resemblance to the growth trajectory of its domestic and international peers.  


2006- 2011 Revenue CAGR

2006- 2011 EBITDA CAGR


Compared to other scrap metal recyclers, CMR’s financial performance is simply incredible. From 2006-
2011, the company’s revenues grew at over the double the rate of its nearest domestic competitor, and 
nearly five to ten times the rate of most of its more-experienced international peers.  The Company’s 
EBITDA growth is similarly spectacular.


More suspiciously, the Company achieved such phenomenal growth even though, relative to its peers, its 
capital expenditures were minimal.

Nor can increased productivity at CMR’s existing facilities explain the growth.  From 2006 to 2011, the 
Company’s capacity utilization remained below 50%.


Given the CMR’s lack of capital expenditures and low capacity utilization, the Company’s meteoric 
growth seems too good to be true.  Other financial metrics support this conclusion. 


2) Employee Efficiency Metrics Suggest Fraud


CMR claims to generate $US 11 million of revenue per employee, a worker productivity rate that is
eleven times the revenue generated by its closest competitors and almost six times the revenue per 
employee generated by the tech-giant Apple Inc. (~ $US 2 million per employee), generally regarded as 
one of the world leaders in yield per employee.  This is simply not believable.  By industry standards, the 
following graph shows that CMR’s performance is so fantastic as to defy credibility.

Revenues/Employee


Measured on an EBITDA/employee scale, the Company’s performance seems similarly absurd.  


EBITDA/Employee


In our experience, when management teams exaggerate sales and growth numbers, they often forget to 
give a commensurate boost to other operational metrics such as employee headcount.  Thus, productivity 
ratios and other efficiency ratios that significantly deviate from the industry standard are often red flags 
when accompanied by suspiciously amazing financial performance.  We suspect that CMR’s management
21





















































www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA METAL RECYCLING HOLDINGS LTD | HK: 0773


simply forgot to increase its headcount when it juiced its sales figures, as there is no feasible way that a 
burgeoning scrap metal recycler can produce almost eleven times the revenue per employee than its 
nearest competitor.     


3) Inexplicable Operational Efficiency


The Company’s reported inventory turnover is also purportedly best in class (by a healthy distance), 
further undermining the credibility of its financial statements.  


Days in Inventory


Not only does the Company claim to turn inventory more than twice as fast as its global peers, but it also 
appears to be at least five times as efficient as Chiho-Tiande, its domestic competitor. 


How can any investor believe such reported numbers to be true?  Either CMR, as a relatively new entrant, 
has revolutionized the scrap metal recycling industry and achieved a level of operational efficiency so 
much greater than its peers that it should be the subject of business school case studies for decades to 
come, or it is simply a fraud.  We think the answer is obvious.

4) Madoffian Returns on Capital


One of the hallmark features of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was that he consistently produced positive
monthly returns despite wild swings in the market. The consistency of CMR’s performance bears a 
striking resemblance to Madoff’s returns: notice in the chart below how the Company’s return on capital
is remarkably consistent and was positive during the financial crash of 2008 – 2009.


Return on Capital


How many suspicious metrics do investors and regulators need to realize that the only explanation for the 
Company’s unusually strong performance is that the Company is dabbling in the dark arts of accounting?

WOE BE THE CFO


On November 18, 2009, a mere six months after the CMR’s initial public offering, its CFO and deputy 


Chief Executive Officer, Wong Hok-Leung, resigned from the Company after only 18 months at the 


position, sending its share price plummeting by as much as 45%.
20


The circumstances surrounding 


Wong’s resignation strongly suggest that the Company is engaging in financial improprieties.


On November 3, 2009, two weeks before his resignation, Wong approached the audit committee with 


“certain issues . . . that concerned him relating to the business of the Company.”
21


No CFO would make 
any such accusations lightly: he would know that after he went to the audit committee with evidence or 


suspicions of impropriety, either he would most likely be terminated or the audit committee would begin 


a very contentious examination into the management team.  At the very least, any CFO would know that 
such accusations would ruin his relationship with other executive officers and possibly derail his career.    


The fact that Wong would risk his professional reputation and his job by going to the audit committee 


suggests that he suspected that the Company was engaging in impropriety. 


In response, the audit committee brought the CFO’s allegations to the board of directors (which included 


the CEO and other non-independent directors).  The board then approached management, from whom it 
“received a verbal confirmation . . . that the issues raised by Mr. Wong should have no material 


adverse impact on the Company.”
22


During this time, Wong alleges that he was denied access to the financial information of the Company in 


connection with his whistle-blowing investigation.  Why? According to CMR, “the Company’s IT 


department had recently performed a security upgrade on its servers that disabled computer access to the 


financial database.” What are the odds that the Company was performing routine security updates that 
denied a CFO access to Company data at the same time as the CFO may have been investigating 


potential accounting fraud? 


Stop to consider the absurdity of this chain of events.  The CFO approached the audit committee with 


what most likely amounted to strong suspicions of fraud. But rather than hiring an independent 


accountant or law firm to review its CFO’s allegations, the audit committee and the board of directors 


appeares to have done little to investigate its CFO’s suspicions.  Only 4 days after Wong first 
approached the audit committee with his suspicions, on November 7, 2009, the board seemed ready to


put the scandal to rest by receiving “verbal assurances” from the management team that everything was 


fine. 


This is surreal.  If a CFO approached the audit committee with allegations of fraud, the board should have 


spent more than four days investigating the allegations and should not have gained any comfort from the 
mere verbal assurances of the same management team potentially accused of fraud. 


Five days after the board of directors dismissed his concerns, Wong resigned. According to Wong, he 


resigned because the board of directors was refusing to cooperate with his investigation into suspicious 
aspects of CMR’s financials:

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA METAL RECYCLING HOLDINGS LTD | HK: 0773


Mr. Wong stated in his notice that the reasons for his resignation were that the Board had failed 


to address his concerns or provide clarification on certain issue and that he had been denied 
proper access to the financial information of the Company.


23


Wong’s accusations are even more significant considering that he was both CFO and deputy CEO, 


effectively second in command at the Company.   Wong also has an impressive pedigree, further 
enhancing his credibility.  He is a British citizen and a member of the Association of Certified Chartered 


Accountants in the United Kingdom.
24


A recent study of public company accounting fraud shows that in the three years prior to the discovery of 


fraud, companies manipulating financial statements experienced higher CFO turnover than non-


manipulating firms.
25


  The study suggests that turnover is high at fraudulent companies because CFOs 
who refuse to bury their head in the sand either leave or are fired. In CMR’s case, the shoe seems to fit.


We believe that the circumstances surrounding Wong’s resignation strongly corroborate the evidence of 


fraud compiled in this report.


CHAIRMAN CASHING OUT


On January 25, 2013, CMR announced that its Chairman, CEO and founder, Chun Chi Wai, entered into 


an agreement with a state-owned enterprise to sell 56% of his shares (and 29% of the total shares of the 


Company) at HKD ~9.99 per share (a 5% premium to the closing price of CMR’s shares on January 25).
26


  
The purchaser named in the Company’s filing is the China Energy Conservation and Environmental 


Protection Group (the “Purchaser” or the “SOE”), a state-owned enterprise under the direct supervision 


and ownership of State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council 


of the PRC.


The inescapable inference from this transaction is that, at least in the eyes of the man who knows the most 


about the Company, the value of CMR’s shares has peaked.  In our opinion, Chun Chi Wai had a clear 
incentive to cash out before the information that we discuss in this report became widely known.  When 


the man who knows the most about CMR cashes out of the majority of his shares, investors would be 


wise to heed his example.       


But why would a PRC state-owned enterprise agree to pay a princely ransom for equity that we believe is 


worthless?  We believe that there are two possible explanations: either the Purchaser is another victim of 


CMR’s deception, or officials at the SOE are corrupt and thus complicit in the fraud.  We will briefly 
discuss both alternatives. 


The first alternative is that the Purchaser is yet another victim of a financial track record that we believe 
to be a hoax.  If the SOE and its officials who negotiated the purchase of Chun Chi Wai’s shares are truly 


innocent, we believe that they will use the information contained in this report to walk away from the deal 


rather than allow Communist Party officials to become the humiliated victims of what, in our opinion, is a 


blatant fraud.

“Why Do CFOs Become Involved in Material Accounting Manipulations?” is forthcoming in the Journal of

School of Business, and Mei Feng and Shuqing Luo of the University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of 


Business.

www.glaucusresearch.comCHINA METAL RECYCLING HOLDINGS LTD | HK: 0773


The Sale and Purchase Agreement governing the transaction is conditioned upon various approvals and 
consents from PRC authorities and CMR’s lenders and is subject to cancellation if shares of CMR are 


suspended from trading for more than 20 consecutive days.  There is ample opportunity for the Purchaser


to get out of the deal once officials at the SOE review of the publicly available evidence highlighted in 


this report.    


The second possible alternative is that the Purchaser knows that CMR is a blatant fraud and that the 


officials who orchestrated the share purchase are corrupt.  If this is the case, we believe that the 
consequences could be dire as they would be directly insulting ascendant party leader Xi Jinping, 


who vowed to the Chinese people last week to crack down on both “tigers” and “flies” – powerful leaders 


and lowly bureaucrats – in his fight against corruption.
27


Xi Jinping rose to prominence and leadership within the Communist Party as a crusader against 


corruption. In November 2012, Mr. Xi made a famous speech at a politburo session in which he stated 


that corruption could “kill the party and ruin the country.”
28


  The China Daily News wrote that his 
“remarks are a sign of new leadership’s determination to fight corruption in the coming years.”


29
  


Mr. Xi’s rhetoric has only escalated since then.  


As president in waiting, he gave a speech only last week in which he raised the stakes in his country’s 


fight against corruption: “we must uphold the fighting of tigers and flies at the same time, resolutely 


investigating law-breaking cases of leading officials and also earnestly resolving the unhealthy tendencies 
and corruption problems which happen all around people.” “Power” he added, “should be restricted by 


the cage of regulations.”
30


We believe that the officials at the SOE that agreed to purchase Chun Chi Wai’s shares (which we believe 
are worthless) for HKD 3.4 billion were either the victims of a deception or they are participating in a 


corrupt act.  In our view, the evidence presented in this report makes perfectly clear that the Company has 


vastly exaggerated the size of its business and fabricated its financial performance.  If Chun Chi Wai sells 
shares to a Chinese SOE, we believe that he puts both himself and those officials at the SOE who 


negotiated the transaction in grave danger of becoming targets in Mr. Xi’s battle against corrupt 


officials.  The punishments could be dire for all involved, including death. 
31


VALUATION


We believe that the SFC and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will quickly verify the evidence presented 
in this report and halt trading of CMR’s stock before any more investors are hurt.  We also believe that 


regulators will thereafter delist the Company and prosecute those executives responsible for the fraud.   


There is a wealth of evidence to support our contention that CMR has vastly exaggerated its sales and the 


size of its business.  To take it one step further, we believe it is likely that the Company has also inflated 


the size of current assets such as deposits, receivables and cash to keep the lie consistent.  After all, if a 


company is booking fake sales, the balance sheet will usually balloon with fake cash and fake receivables.
Therefore, if the Company collapses under allegations of fraud, the only assets available to yield any 


recovery to creditors would most likely be property and fixed assets.

As of June 2012, CMR has HKD 5.7 billion of bank debt outstanding, the holders of which would take 
priority over shareholders.  The book value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment is only HKD 


460 million, so even after senior secured bank creditors seize CMR’s fixed assets, the banks will still be 


owed over HKD 5 billion!  After senior secured debt holders, local Chinese unsecured creditors with 


priority over Hong Kong shareholders are owed roughly HKD 10 billion (in payables).
32


Ultimately, the Company’s heavily levered balance sheet and the scale of its deception suggest that 


shareholders will be left with nothing.  We therefore put a price target on CMR’s shares of HKD 0.00.
