Regulus To See Further Declines
Nov. 19, 2014 10:30 AM ET30 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Summary


Regulus is a retail heavy stock which has recently tripled on mere Phase I results.


Regulus' drug is not a one shot cure for Hep C and is inferior to Gilead's Harvoni.


As the stock has spiked, insiders and partners have been very quick to dump large
amounts of stock.


On October 22nd, Regulus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RGLS) released its "proof of concept"
data for its Hep C drug RG-101. The stock price quickly soared from its prior level of $6-7
to as high as $25 (intra day) as enthusiasm for the drug ran wild.


At its peak, Regulus' market cap was well over $1 billion and was briefly larger than that of
Achillion Pharma (NASDAQ:ACHN). This was notable because Regulus has just a single
drug through Phase I trials whereas Achillion has a total of four compounds, including in
Phase II.


In any event, awarding Regulus a $1 billion market cap for a single Phase I drug was
clearly not something that could last. The stock quickly dropped by as much as 30% from
its $25 high before showing a slight bounce.

Regulus has multiple big pharma shareholders, including AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN), Isis
Pharma (ISIS) and Alnylam (NASDAQ:ALNY). But aside from these, the free float itself is
dominated by retail investors. Outside institutional ownership stands at just 30%. Such
retail heavy stocks are quite often subject to much larger irrational price moves than
stocks, which are traded by institutions. But the extent of this recent move was very
surprising even for a retail heavy name.


Here is what you need to know about Regulus and why the share price is likely to return to
around $10.


First off, it is important to understand what the newly released data actually means. Part of
the run up in the stock was fueled by speculation that Regulus had developed a "single
shot" treatment for Hepatitis, which would make it far more convenient than the existing
multi week pill regimen being offered by Gilead and its Harvoni.


The speculation of a "single shot" treatment was nonsense. Even the data released by
Regulus shows this to be the case.

The graph below shows the data for the 16 patients in the trial. The downward slope of the
line reflects the decrease in viral load over the 29-day period. The two relatively flat lines
at the top reflect the two patients who received placebo. Naturally, their reduction in viral
load was basically nil, hence the flat line.


But among the other 14 patients, the results were notable. We can see at the bottom right
of the table that at 29 days, 6 of the 14 patients had viral levels that were Below Limit of
Quantification ("BLOQ"). That is the goal. Clearly, this is a good thing, but it should also be
kept in mind that this is a success rate of just 43% for a drug that is easily 5 years away
from being on the market. Yet it should be kept in mind that this compares to a rate of 90-
95% with existing Harvoni, which is already on the market.


But a second slide released by Regulus highlights a bigger problem. In the table below,
we can see that by day 57 there is a significant rate of ultimate treatment failure. This is
indicated by the "u shaped" trend of the lines. Basically, what this means is that after an
initial decline, the virus came back.

The reality is that the preliminary indications for RG-101 suggest that it is significantly
inferior to Gilead's Harvoni. The only thing that it might have had going for it was the
notion of the "single shot" convenience. But this is clearly not the case.


REASON #1: Position relative to Gilead's Harvoni. Harvoni boasts a success rate of
90-95% and is already on the market. RG-101 has a much lower success rate of 43%
and that was only in a small Phase I study. Harvoni is oral and does not require
injections. By the time RG-101 could even make it to market, much of the Hep C
population could have already been treated.


Common sense and a few outside indicators should tell us that this share price move was
totally unjustified and that it will correct sharply and quickly.


The first sign that the enthusiasm is largely misplaced comes from Regulus' loss of partner
Glaxo, just in time for the release of the "proof of concept" data. Earlier in the month,
Glaxo had announced that it would be partnering with Dutch company Santaris. Santaris
is taking a nearly identical approach to treating Hep C, which is targeting mir22 to block
viral replication.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2694825-regulus-to-see-further-declines 5/19


The significance of the loss of Glaxo may have been lost on many investors because this
negative news (via an 8-K) was actually released midway through the very positive
conference call discussing the proof of concept data. Regulus had been notified of the
termination 5 days earlier.


On October 17, 2014, we received written notice from Glaxo Group Limited, or GSK,
of GSK's election to terminate the Product Development and Commercialization
Agreement by and between GSK and us dated April 17, 2008, as amended, in light
of GSK's review of its overall research priorities.


Reason #2: Partner Glaxo abandoned Regulus in favor of Santaris who is
developing a nearly identical therapeutic.


The biggest indication we have that the share price move is totally unjustified lies in the
wave of insider selling that has coincided with the spike in the share price. As soon as the
stock shot up, insiders basically couldn't sell big enough or fast enough.


It should be noted that the CEO and Chief Scientific officer had been selling smaller
amounts of stock earlier in the year and right up until the release of the proof of concept
data. These sales were small in size and occurred at prices as low as $7.00. This is not
the big indicator.


The big indicator lies in the form of the massive wave of selling by Regulus and the major
insiders as soon as the stock popped.


On October 27th, just days into the stock climb, Regulus announced a public offering of
common stock intended to raise $80 million to take advantage of the sharp rise in the
stock from $6 to over $18. Prior to the offering, Regulus already had nearly $100 million in
cash, such that this raise was entirely due to the share price level and not due to the near-
term need to finance. When a company sells stock when it doesn't need the money, it
should always be taken as a sign that the share price may be at unsustainable levels.


But it should also be noticed that shareholder Isis was quick to get in on the selling action
as well, filing to unload $10 million worth of stock in the same offering. In fact, by the time
the offering was done, both parties ended up selling substantially more at the $17 offering
price. The offering size was increased to $103.5 million in total, but only $76 million in
proceeds are going to Regulus. This means that the amount being sold by Isis was
increased disproportionately. The point is simply that at a price $17, Isis was very eager to
sell more stock rather than less.

Partner Alnylam has also been quick to take advantage of the spike to sell more stock.
Meanwhile, last week AstraZeneca filed to sell 2 million shares at $17 raising $34 million.


Perhaps of greater importance is the fact these big sellers were already selling earlier in
the year at prices as low as $6. The recent spike in the share price has just been an
excuse to sell more and faster.


In appendix I, I have included a list of the insider selling that has occurred in 2014.
Including recent sales, it now amounts to over $60 million. This is in addition to the $76
million just issued by Regulus itself.


Reason #3: The speed and the huge magnitude of the insider selling indicates that
insiders themselves are aware of how wildly overpriced Regulus is at current levels.


Conclusion


Shares of Regulus soared from $6-7 to over $25 intraday due to the release of simple
Phase I data. The data is positive and encouraging, but in reality, even a 50% share price
move (to around $10.00) on such news would have been premature. The size of the surge
can be largely attributed to the fact that Regulus is a retail heavy name, which is subject to
much greater than normal volatility.


Regulus has just a single drug in development, which is only in Phase I trials. Yet it still
sports a market cap of nearly $900 million. The preliminary success rate among 14
patients is just 43%. This is good, but nowhere near the 90-95% level of Harvoni, which is
already on the market.


That is not to say that MicroRNA therapies are not worth looking into. Glaxo had
previously partnered with Regulus on this front. However, Glaxo has since abandoned
Regulus in favor of Santaris, with whom it had previously partnered.


But it is the insider selling which tells us which direction the share price is headed. Each of
the major insider shareholders including Alnylam, Isis and AstraZeneca have been quick
to unload large amounts of stock at current prices, even as there was already selling
taking place as low as $6 earlier in the year.


Investors in Regulus should expect to see additional insider selling and see the share
price drop back to around $10 in short order. This would still represent a 50% premium to
where the stock was prior to the "proof of concept" data.

For one ISIS sold only aprox 20% of their 7.1 million shares. Which always makes sense when you are funding a
huge pipeline. You can debate market value after huge run up but remember this is a platform technology. MiR-122
will prove to be an extremely viable target.


miR-122 Findings from Mt. Sinai 
http://bit.ly/11CzFxB


>>Nov 18, 2014  
Hepatitis C Antiviral Resistance Revealed


Scientists at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) say recent research has shed light on the
response of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) to targeted therapeutics and provided new insights about HCV’s role in cancer
development. Their work (“Hepatitis C virus genetics affects miR-122 requirements and response to miR-122
inhibitors”), published in Nature Communications, focused on microRNA genes, a type of regulatory gene, and used
whole-genome sequencing of the virus to challenge conventional wisdom about how the virus responds to emerging
therapies.


Their findings, note the researchers, may contribute to more effective development of hepatitis C drugs in the future
and to more personalized treatment for patients.


According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HCV is widespread, affecting some 3% of the world’s
population and more than 3 million people in the United States alone. Recent CDC reports indicate that hepatitis C
infections are on the rise among young people and are increasingly the cause of death among baby boomers.


The vast majority of people who get HCV will suffer chronic infection, which can lead to liver inflammation, cirrhosis,
and liver cancer. Highly effective new treatments have been launched recently, but their high prices have caused
public outcry and limited widespread use. There is no commercially available vaccine for hepatitis C.


In this new study, Mount Sinai researchers examined HCV response to an experimental treatment that targets and
blocks the supply of a microRNA (miR-122) that the virus needs for infection of human cells. Contrary to expectations,
they found that depleting the supply of miR-122 could trigger drug resistance with the emergence of HCV strains able
to infect cells with negligible levels of the microRNA. This information could be used for more effective dosing of drugs
targeting this gene, as well as for pre-treatment analysis to determine which patients may respond best to this class of
drugs.


“This effort, which was made possible by innovative microRNA analysis, offers significant progress toward precision
medicine in treating HCV patients,” said Matthew Evans, Ph.D., assistant professor of microbiology at the ISMMS and
a co-author of the study. “There is a critical need for more weapons in our arsenal to fight HCV, particularly for
affordable, effective treatment as we try to stay a step ahead of this virus and prevent it from developing the kind of
drug resistance we’re seeing in the bacterial realm.”


In another key finding, the scientists uncovered knowledge that may help answer the longstanding question of how
HCV leads to cancer. The study demonstrated that HCV hijacks the miR-122 gene, diminishing its normal activity in
liver cells. Since this microRNA is known to be a potent tumor repressor, it is possible that HCV robs cells of their

natural defenses against uncontrolled growth. Such an outcome could contribute to cancers that arise from chronic
HCV infection.


“We found that HCV itself reduces miR-122’s activity in the cell, possibly through binding and sequestering miR-122,”
wrote the investigators. “Our study provides insight into the interaction between miR-122 and HCV, including viral
adaptation to reduced miR-122 bioavailability, and has implications for the development of anti-miR-122-based HCV
drugs.”


“Our study offers broader implications for this class of microRNA genes and their interaction with targets, which may
be useful for a number of diseases in addition to hepatitis C,” said Brian Brown, Ph.D., associate professor of genetics
and genomic sciences at the ISMMS and a co-author of the study. “We are also intrigued by this new information that
may shed light on the link between HCV and the onset of cancer and look forward to future efforts to explore this
theory.”<<

"Contrary to expectations, they found that ***depleting the supply of miR-122 could trigger drug resistance
with the emergence of HCV strains able to infect cells with negligible levels of the microRNA***"

From the Nature paper


"Owing to the high genetic diversity of HCV in a single patient, we would expect this polymorphism to also be
present within patients before treatment with any anti- miR-122 therapy. Thus, we would expect the
emergence of A28 in individuals infected with HCV strains containing G28. Although we know that  miR-122 is
highly abundant in bulk liver samples, the expression of  miR-122 may vary between hepatocytes and this
would give some mutants a replicative advantage. This may account for the higher prevalence of HCV
variants with the G28A genotype."

"Therefore, combinations of or even single mutations in the 5′ UTR S1 reduced the antiviral effect of miR-122
antagonism."

RA Cap may be in and out for quick $.

author fails to point out who bought stock. RA capital, which owned 23% of ACHN, now has a larger position in RGLS
than ACHN. RA had $99M invested in RGLS as of 9/30 filings. RA CAP arguably the best performer in small cap bio
space. Ill follow RA before following a former banker without BIO expertise. 
Also note the quality of RGLS investors and would take issue with this being a "retail" holding. That's what makes a
market...

Results for one dose were excellent and it was the lower dose. Company never claimed one dose cure, nor anyone
else of any standing or affiliation, but it may end up being the quickest cure. It's also possible it could be used in
conjunction with another drug.

Forgot to mention RGLS CEO used to be CEO of ANDS, where he sold $1M shares prior to bad data in 2006. Very

I actually agree that RGLS could not possibly stay up in the mid 20s and I would not even buy it here, but this is a
very poorly written article with what I believe has a major mistruth in it. I would like the author to provide evidence that
GSK has partnered with Santaris on an anti-miR-122 compound. I don't think he can do it. GSK gave up there option
to license that compound years ago because they decided to go with Regulus. They did end their agreement with
Regulus recently as he states, but that was because of changing priorities not because they have picked up Santaris'
compound which is clearly an inferior compound and does not have a significant lead anymore.

Characterization of the in vitro antiviral activity and the preclinical and clinical resistance profile of miravirsen, a novel
anti-HCV therapeutic targeting the human factor miR-122. 
Ottosen S1, Parsley TB2, Yang L2, Zeh K3, van Doorn LJ4, van der Veer E4, Raney AK3, Hodges MR3, Patick AK5. 
Author information 
Abstract 
Miravirsen is a β-D-oxy-Locked Nucleic Acid modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide targeting the liver-
specific microRNA-122 (miR-122). Miravirsen demonstrated antiviral activity against HCV genotype 1b replicons with
a mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.67 μM. No cytotoxicity was observed up to the highest concentration
tested (>320 μM) in different cell culture models yielding a therapeutic index of ≥297. Combination studies of
miravirsen with interferon-α2b, ribavirin, non-nucleoside (VX-222) and nucleoside (2' -methylcytidine) inhibitors of
NS5B, NS5A (BMS-790052), or NS3 (telaprevir) indicated additive interactions. Miravirsen demonstrated broad
antiviral activity when tested against HCV replicons resistant to NS3, NS5A and NS5B inhibitors with less than 2-fold
reductions in susceptibility. In serial passage studies, an A4C nucleotide change was observed in the 5' HCV UTR
from cells passaged in the presence of up to 20 μM (40-fold the miravirsen EC50 concentration) at day 72 of passage
but not at earlier time points (up to 39 days of passage). Likewise, a C3U nucleotide change was observed in the
HCV 5' UTR from subjects with viral rebound after the completion of therapy in a miravirsen Phase 2 clinical trial. An
HCV variant constructed to contain the A4C change was fully susceptible to miravirsen. A C3U HCV variant
demonstrated overall reductions in susceptibility to miravirsen but was fully susceptible to all other anti-HCV agents
tested. In summary, miravirsen has demonstrated broad antiviral activity and a relatively high genetic barrier to
resistance. Identification of nucleotides changes associated with miravirsen resistance should help further elucidate
the biology of miR-122 interactions with HCV. (The clinical trial study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under
registration no. NCT01200420).

This is not the only drug in development as you stated. I would not want to be short when the next data point comes
out (multi dosing at higher dose). One dose of the Regulus drug versus how many for Harvoni? 84! Double that with
cirrhosis. Not a very fair comparison. Insurance companies would love the cheaper drug.

RGLS will follow ARWR stock price trajectory in chart. Small biotech stocks are for gamblers. The only way to play it
is when it's <$2 a share and buy a dozen of them.

RNAi plays have made many investors big money in short periods of time. MRNA is setting up to be another
short/med/long term RNAi play. This past week their partner Mirna Therapeutics had great phase I data on cancer
treatment on escalating dosage. MRNA is only a 40 mill market cap and there's large pharma ready to partner up at
some point in time.


Do some DD here and it could be the next RGLS on the upswing. target $2short/medium term

He very well could have had correct calls as well and he could be right in this $RGLS call but the fact of the matter is
that these articles are nothing more than tossing a coin. I think that investing is very dynamic and there are way more
variables involved that can be fathomed by one indivdual based on his/her experience.  
I suggest that people should do their own thesis and let the price patterns confirm their thesis. If it confirms they shd
take that position and if price pattern contradicts their thesis than they analyze again. In the end price patterns on the
charts telling what has happened and is leading to what has to happen now is utmost importance.


I see bullish pattern in RGLS and its time to go long
