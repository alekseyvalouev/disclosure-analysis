Analysis Of Celsion's Press Release Shows Extended Risks
Jun. 13, 2013 11:07 AM ET63 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


It's always flattering to be called out by a company for an article you've written, so we
were pleased to see Celsion (NASDAQ:CLSN) describe our last article (which can be read
here) as "misleading" and that our statements "require clarification" in a press release that
can be read here. If anything, we're pleased to report that a close reading of Celsion's
press release suggests that our statements were spot on. Our key takeaways from the
press release, none of which investors previously knew, were:


A change from Celsion claiming that they would meet with the FDA to now claiming
that an FDA meeting would be dependent on a maturation of OS data.
An admission from Celsion that they may need to pursue additional animal testing
before they can restart clinical tests in humans. This is an incremental delay and
therefore negative.
A new concept from Celsion of pursuing additional trials in enriched populations, which
we believe is a further negative due to the potential for a smaller target market and a
longer time to market.


We believe that all of this new information is incrementally negative. Our price target
remains $0.73 or roughly -50% from today's price.


With those as the highlights, let's analyze Celsion's recent press release, which oddly
enough never says what was misleading about our last article:


Celsion: As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, Celsion has
conducted a comprehensive post hoc analysis of the data from its Phase III HEAT Study
of ThermoDox® in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with its key principal investigators,
data experts and liver cancer experts.


Alpha Exposure: We agree. It's entirely normal for companies to data mine after failed
trials. In our opinion, this is typically fruitless because if you look in enough different places
you can generally find something that looks statistically promising simply due to random
chance.


Celsion: This analysis followed the announcement on January 31, 2013, that
ThermoDox® in combination with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) did not meet the study's
primary endpoint.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1499782-analysis-of-celsions-press-release-shows-extended-risks 2/18


Alpha Exposure: Exactly! The HEAT study was a failure. In fact, by the company's own
admission, it wasn't even close.


Celsion: Emerging findings from the HEAT Study post hoc analysis, which has provided
important insights regarding the use of ThermoDox® in conjunction with RFA to treat
HCC, suggests that ThermoDox® markedly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) in patients if their lesions undergo RFA for 45 minutes or more.


Alpha Exposure: We think the conclusion that Thermodox plus RFA for 45 minutes or
more improves PFS and OS is unlikely to be true. The conclusions are being drawn from
data mining and there is no way to know whether it's due to randomness or due to a
treatment effect. In fact, this is why the FDA approves drugs based on meeting pre-
specified endpoints in trials and not on post hoc analysis after data mining. Lastly, it is
important to note that regardless of whether or not Celsion thinks that there was an
improvement in PFS and OS, any benefit seen was NOT statistically significant. As a
result, even if the FDA would give weight to these results (and we are confident they
would not), the results still would not be good enough for approval of Thermodox.


Celsion: These findings apply to HCC lesions from both size cohorts of the HEAT Study
(3-5 cm and 5-7 cm) and represent a sizable subgroup of approximately 300 patients.


Alpha Exposure: 300 Patients is less than half the trial size, which enrolled 701 patients
(see the boilerplate here). This means that more than half of the patients enrolled in the
trial are not even part of this subgroup. In fact, if you look at the slide for the patients
undergoing RFA for less than 45 minutes, the hazard ratio for Thermodox treated patients
was 1.34, suggesting that there was a trend of patients in this subgroup who had been
treated with Thermodox dying faster than the placebo patients. Of course, this patient
group isn't statistically significant either, so unlike Celsion, we won't try to mislead people
into believing that there is something there. More importantly, as previously stressed, even
in their chosen subgroup of patients receiving RFA for more than 45 minutes, Celsion was
unable to find a statistically significant result. In our opinion, this speaks to the lack of
efficacy of Thermodox.


Celsion: In the patient subgroup treated in the ThermoDox arm whose RFA procedure
lasted longer than 45 minutes (63% of single lesion patients), overall survival improved by
53% (Hazard Ratio of 0.65 and a Pvalue = 0.105) when compared to the control arm of
RFA treatment only.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1499782-analysis-of-celsions-press-release-shows-extended-risks 3/18


Alpha Exposure: Once again, Celsion does our work for us by pointing out that even after
extensive data mining (which they refer to as "post-hoc analysis"); the company is unable
to find a patient group that has a statistically significant benefit from Thermodox.


Celsion: While the Hazard Ratio reported above should be viewed with caution since the
HEAT Study has not reached its median point for overall survival analysis, there is a
strong signal which our investigators and data experts consider to be encouraging and
sufficient to warrant additional clinical investigation.


Alpha Exposure: Celsion further helps investors understand that its data mining is of
minimal value, because the data mining itself is based on an immature data set.
Furthermore, it is our opinion that "investigators and data experts" almost always want
additional clinical investigations. These investigations are both lucrative and prestigious
for them, so it's unsurprising that they're encouraging the company to spend more money
on pursuing Thermodox, which has already failed a Phase III trial.


Celsion: These data were presented at a recent medical meeting of interventional
oncology by two of Celsion's lead investigators. Furthermore, the detailed data has been
submitted for peer review at upcoming international meetings in liver oncology and
interventional oncology. HEAT Study investigators have agreed to the submission of the
HEAT Study results and the post hoc data for peer review.


Alpha Exposure: The presentation of failed trials at conferences and in scientific journals
happens all the time. This is one of the ways that scientists learn and share data. It's no
reason for Celsion to celebrate and it's in fact the data that they've presented that has
been so poorly received by the experts we have consulted.


Celsion: Celsion is refining the appropriate theoretical models to establish quantitative
predictions for the influence of RFA heating time on local tissue concentrations of
ThermoDox®. Empirical studies will then be used to verify the model predictions using
appropriate animal studies which are targeted for completion over the summer.


Alpha Exposure: Celsion is basically admitting that it needs to go all the way back to
animal models with Thermodox to design a new trial. In fact, the prior animal models
suggested an optimal release of Dox within about 30 minutes, so the 45 minute cut-off
Celsion has been using seems arbitrary and most likely chosen to put the failed HEAT trial
in the best light possible. In our opinion, if Celsion needs to go back to animal models
before it can even design a new trial, the timeline to new results is likely to be even longer
5/18/2018 Analysis Of Celsion's Press Release Shows Extended Risks - Celsion Corporation (NASDAQ:CLSN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1499782-analysis-of-celsions-press-release-shows-extended-risks 4/18


than we previously estimated. Shareholders should be ready for massive additional
dilution in the meantime since we estimate that Celsion will need at least twice as much
cash as it currently has to run another trial.


Celsion: Assuming that our hypothesis is supported by non-clinical studies as well as
continued follow-up of patients in the HEAT Study to the overall survival endpoint, we will
meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss these findings.


Alpha Exposure: Celsion takes another step backwards with this statement. In the past,
investors were led to believe that Celsion would meet with the FDA to plan next steps
when the CEO said in the April 23 business update "Based on the strength of these
findings, the Company will request a meeting with regulatory authorities for guidance on
moving forward with our HCC development program." Now, investors know that such a
meeting with the FDA will only take place if both the animal models Celsion needs to go
back to as well as the still immature OS data are positive. This is an even riskier proposal
than investors were previously led to believe. Lastly, as investors wait for this data to be
generated, Celsion will continue to burn through cash and the timeline to starting (much
less completing) another Phase III trial will be even further extended. This is a clear
negative revision to investor expectations.


Celsion: We would plan to propose a regulatory path forward which may include additional
clinical studies based on FDA's predictive enrichment guidance.


Alpha Exposure: We agree that Celsion will need to conduct additional clinical trials. As
regards "predictive enrichment guidance," we believe that Celsion may be referring to
choosing a "study population in which detection of a drug effect (if one is in fact present) is
more likely than it would be in an unselected population" - which is described in this
document. This is an interesting idea by Celsion, but it carries with it two significant
drawbacks. First, in the unlikely event that the company ever runs a successful Phase III,
any drug approved on a trial that succeeds based on an enriched patient population is
likely to receive a label where the use of the drug is indicated for the population in which it
was studied. As a result, this may cause the hypothetical future market size to be much
smaller than it otherwise would be. A second drawback is that enrolling a large trial in an
enriched population is likely to take much longer than it would to enroll a general
population of HCC patients who need RFA. Hence the timeline to study completion would
be even longer.

Comments (63)


The single most interesting thing about Celsion's press release is that it claims our prior
article was "misleading" and that our statements "require clarification," yet there was not a
single quote or piece of analysis from our article that was refuted by Celsion. Instead, our
careful analysis of Celsion's desperate press release reveals many more reasons that the
company's future is bleak. We continue to see Thermodox as an abject failure and believe
that the Company's post hoc data mining analysis was both misleading and useless. In
our opinion, Thermodox has no future in HCC and the fair value for Celsion remains $0.73
per share or nearly 50% below today's price.


For our next article, we will provide an explanation of post hoc analysis and data mining
along with a mathematical example that shows why this type of analysis is more likely to
be random (or even misleading) than meaningful.

Logic Man
Your articles are actually very well written and only misleading to the degree that you purposely only consider
1 viewpoint and that viewpoint is that thermodox is worthless. This makes sense since the intent of your entire
article is to scare current shareholders (and provide a plausible cover story) so your short connections can
timely dump the stock as your article comes out in hopes of creating a panic and make CLSN over extend to
the downside. 
And as such, you deftly fail to mention the fact that even with a very small number of patients, the current
probability that you are right is only 10% and the probability that CLSN is right is 90%. Yes, this "mined" data
could very well be due to chance, but given the stock has sold off from over $9 a share to $1.40, it is pretty
darn cheap considering that there are very good risk/reward odds of an eventual Thermodox success not to
mention the multitudes of other uses of CLSN's liposomal patents and technologies in other cancers and
diseases. An eventual Thermodox success in any of these indications would reward the current buyers of
CLSN with returns on the order of multiple hundreds of percents but you, of course, would never want to tell
them that.

Celsion didn't specifically quote you and correct you because your article had no substance nor did it have any
concrete reputable proof of anything you claimed. Just like your article about UNXL, it seems your intentions are quite
negative. Did you want Celsion to call out your lie about Celsion not being there at ASCO or do you want Celsion to
point out that these so called doctors of yours might not exist?


This article though is much better written than the previous one because you didn't include anymore anonymous
hearsay. You would be wise to make sure your statements in the future only reflect your opinions formed based on the
truth and facts, if you don't want to get sued again of course.

You seem to be obsessed with two points: subgroup analysis is bad and Celsion did not achieve statistical
significance in the subgroup analysis. Well, subgroup analysis sometimes is very good, especially when subgroups
are selected based on reasonable criteria. Duration of a procedure seems to be a reasonable criterion. The reason
statistical significance is not achieved is most likely because the subgroup size is not large enough - not a surprise
there - it is less than half of the trial size. But 300 people is quite a good number to draw conclusions that are likely to
be true (statistical significance is usually defined at 95% or 99% levels, but making investment decisions based on,
say, 90% levels is rather attractive).


You seem to think that the latest statement is worse than the previous one. Actually, the exact opposite is true.
Previous statements were vague, as in we are going to see if we can find something out and then meet with the FDA
to see how to proceed. The latest statement says: it looks like we get 53% (!) improvement with pvalue of 0.105 if the
procedure lasts 45 minutes or more. We are going to look into it more and if the hypothesis holds up we will meet with
the FDA about the findings. Makes perfect sense to me.


13 Jun 2013, 03:08 PM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I do think that the latest statement is worse. They previously said that they would meet with

against the odds that TDOX doesn't work.


13 Jun 2013, 04:36 PM


Logic Man
Correct alphaplay. And investors need to further consider this. CLSN is monitoring the OS of the HEAT
participants and this is ongoing. Currently there is a 53% overall survival improvement where 10% of the time
this survival improvement is not real and due to chance. This needs to continue to go down from 10% to 5%
and it could as time progresses and control group members of the HEAT trial pass away. It won't take much
for CLSN to get this. They are pretty close to a pvalue of .05 already so at any time CLSN could do a press
release saying "We are excited to announce that we have achieved statistical significance in the subgroup
analysis of the HEAT study with a 59% improvement in overall survival!"


Then guess what the stock price would do the following day. All shorts would be roasted.


13 Jun 2013, 04:54 PM


Logic Man
If you would have noticed, CLSN mgmt has become increasingly excited and bullish as time has progressed
and they can see more of the OS trends. There is less value to meet with the FDA until they get close to the
.05 pvalue and since they see the OS trend is in their favor they are waiting to let the data get even better.
You do have a shot, but your short seems very very risky here. I'd advise closing it and then doing an article
on why you switched to a long position based on the extremely compelling risk reward ratio.


13 Jun 2013, 05:05 PM


wgreystone
I totally agreed with alphaplay's comment. The failed phase III trial of the HEAT therapy should really be
treated as a phase II trial. ThermoDox is not a new drug but a new delivery method of an existing drug, and
the clinical trial intention is to prove it has statistically significant improvement over the existing drug. Unlike
the typical phase 2 trial of a new drug which applies on a small group of patients to fine-tune the optimal
dosage and possibly the appicable patient group, you can't do a small scale phase 2 trial on ThermoDox to
prove or fine-tune the treatment method, as the target is not to prove if ThermoDox is effective but to prove
the statistically significant improvement. Obviously, CLSN management team decided to try out their luck by
doing this large scale trial as phase 3. If you think the failed phase 3 trial as phase2 instead, and the intention
is to find optimal treatment time and applicable patient group, then the post-trial ad-hoc anaylsis totally makes
sense, and the findings can serve as a good base for defining the protocol for the next phase 3 trial.

"The latest statement says: it looks like we get 53% (!) improvement with pvalue of 0.105 if the procedure
lasts 45 minutes or more."


That's not what a p-value means.

If sample size is small you can not expect much of the "p"


14 Jun 2013, 10:47 AM


IntelligentInvester
Yes they do actually... if you increase the sample size, it's a lot easier to get a more significant p-value. That's
why big pharma can tout low p-values because they can afford to recruit large samples. Maybe you should
have read a normal stats book and not a baby one.

I think you are not understanding my comment.  
One of the limitations of subgroup analysis is that sample size becomes smaller. For example, lets say a
study was originally designed for group A and B to have 150 patients per treatment arm considering a type 2
error of 20% and a type 1 error of 5%. When you do subgroup analysis you might end up in 50 patients per
arm. In this setting, interpreting a "p" value <0.05 should be done with caution as the subgroup analysis might
be large enough.


Big pharmaceuticals use large sample sizes because they need to, not because they have money and want
to boast "low p-values". Anybody that does research needs an adequate sample size for the lowest possible
type 1 and 2 errors. Sample size also depends on the impact of the treatment strategy. For example, if you
consider the penicillin vs placebo for the treatment of pneumonia in the 1940's a very sample size would have
been required (probably less than 25 per treatment arm). A trial on a cholesterol lowering drug to prevent
heart attacks would need a large sample size as the chance of event is small by itself.

Also, a study that requires a small sample size often does not need pharmaceutical funding as often a small
K1 or university grant can fund it.


Have a good day :)

" Celsion's recent press release, which oddly enough never says what was misleading about our last article"


Is it really odd, or is it just acknowledgment that there was nothing misleading about your last article? Presumably if
there were, CLSn would have refuted?????

All I have to say is that for the shorts to put this much effort in CLSN, they must be very concerned about a large pop
next week when the presentation occurs. I suspect the shorts got more concerned after the bull case was validated by
Sabby Capital who made the $10M investment last week at approx. $1.60/share.

Hello there, As per your view there won't be any material facts next week as CEO has bought yesterday. But I have
gone through the press release that was posted on May 30th under the topic "Celsion Announces ThermoDox®
HEAT Study Findings to be presented at the 2013 European Conference on Interventional Oncology (ECIO) in
Budapest, Hungary on June 19 and 20, 2013". This discloses most of the positive information about the recent
findings. Also there was a press release yesterday from the company, but I am not sure about the timing of the CEO
purchase and the press release.


CEO might have bought based on press release made on 30th May.


What is your comment on it?

@ Alpha- Looks like clsn is coming after you due to misstatement of facts.... 
Celsion says 'statements made in Alpha Exposure's blog entry are misleading and require clarification' 
Font size: A | A | A 
3:42 PM ET 6/12/13 | Briefing.com 
Co issued the following statement regarding a blog entry posted by Alpha Exposure, Contributor, on Seeking
Alpha.com: "Statements made in Alpha Exposure's blog entry are misleading and require clarification... Celsion has
conducted a comprehensive post hoc analysis of the data from its Phase III HEAT Study of ThermoDox in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with its key principal investigators, data experts and liver cancer experts. This
analysis followed the announcement on January 31, 2013, that ThermoDox in combination with radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) did not meet the Study's primary endpoint. Emerging findings from the HEAT Study post hoc analysis,
which has provided important insights regarding the use of ThermoDox in conjunction with RFA to treat HCC,
suggests that ThermoDox markedly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients if
their lesions undergo RFA for 45 minutes or more. These findings apply to HCC lesions from both size cohorts of the
HEAT Study (3-5 cm and 5-7 cm) and represent a sizable subgroup of approximately 300 patients. In the patient
subgroup treated in the ThermoDox arm whose RFA procedure lasted longer than 45 minutes (63% of single lesion
patients), overall survival improved by 53% (Hazard Ratio of 0.65 and a Pvalue = 0.105) when compared to the
control arm of RFA treatment only. While the Hazard Ratio reported above should be viewed with caution since the
HEAT Study has not reached its median point for overall survival analysis, there is a strong signal which our
investigators and data experts consider to be encouraging and sufficient to warrant additional clinical investigation...
HEAT Study investigators have agreed to the submission of the HEAT Study results and the post hoc data for peer
review.


Celsion is refining the appropriate theoretical models to establish quantitative predictions for the influence of RFA
heating time on local tissue concentrations of ThermoDox. Empirical studies will then be used to verify the model
predictions using appropriate animal studies which are targeted for completion over the summer. Assuming that our
hypothesis is supported by non-clinical studies as well as continued follow-up of patients in the HEAT Study to the
overall survival endpoint, we will meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss these findings. We
would plan to propose a regulatory path forward which may include additional clinical studies based on FDA's
predictive enrichment guidance. Furthermore, investigators in the HEAT Study have expressed significant interest in
participating in a follow-on clinical trial."

The company says subgroup analysis might show a real improvement in the group that was exposed to a prolonged
radiofrequency ablation. Subgroup analysis are part of any study. Because of study design and statistics, the
conclusions from these analysis tend to be "suggestions" and not "conclusions". Having said this, these findings may
trigger new studies which will require the adequate sample size to interpret the results correctly. Celsion is not
planning to submit to the FDA based on sub-group analysis.


My disclosure: I owned Celsion until January 31 (sold them after HEAT trial). I don't own shares but would like to see
solid data before I buy its shares now.


14 Jun 2013, 07:58 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I agree that the company is likely to use subgroup analysis to form the basis for new trials.
However, the proposed subgroup appears to be merely the result of data mining rather than any true
scientifically justifiable group and a large population has already failed. I believe it is highly likely that any new
trial of Thermodox in HCC will also fail. As a result, I believe that more money spent on Thermodox in HCC is
NPV negative. I therefore continue to believe that Termodox is worthless and that the stock's fair value is
$0.73 per share.

Of course, this is how the crap biotech game is played. A new trial = 2-3+ more years of $400,000 salary for
the CEO.


Look how long garbage companies like ONTY, ONCY, and ZIOP have been able to keep fleecing retail
investors.


Turdmodox is a just silly.

why 0.73 ? If i take your argument then it should not worth more than 0.19. Can you please explain?

The following was posted on the yahoo message boards. I thought it was an interesting post since it speaks to the
track record of Sabby. I am not sure how accurate the post is, but it is interesting if accurate.


I had to guess who is playing a hand in all this - and this is just a guess - I'd be looking at Sabby.

And if you think I'm crazy, look at some of Sabby's recent investments / deals.


1) Sabby did a deal with Cardium (CXM) in FEB 2012. At the time CXM was trading at 37 cents.


Today CXM trades at 7 cents. CXM the company received the money they needed; CXM shareholders, however,
ended up losing. And big.


2) In MAR 2012 Sabby held around 194M - nearly 20% - of GNTAQ. Since this time, GNTAQ has lost half its value.


3) In JUN 2012 Sabby owned 7.5% of TSPT; at the time, TSPT traded around $6.50. Today: $2.95.


4) In SEP 2012 Sabby owned 9.9% of EPCT. At the time, EPCT traded at 13 cents. Today: 5 cents.


I'd be surprised if Cayman Island-based Sabby is in the money losing business.

WATCH OUT for Lloyd! You need to put this stock in perspective, it's a Buck and change stock. You are trying to put
cash metrics on the stock price when Biotechs in drug development phase simply trade on potential or at this price
hope. Although you have certainly put a damper on the over enthusiastic public, what you are actually saying is They
have a Chance. So CLSN is actually a Lloyd Christmas stock and when Mary Swanson told Lloyd that the odds were
one in a million. He broke out in an ear to ear smile and said,"So you're telling me there's a chance!"

Good job Alpha, nice analysis. Seems like Celsion can't say anything back to you this time. I look forward to see your
next article about explanation of post hoc analysis and data mining... I wonder why so many people still believe
celsion have a chance ..

Well , I personally dumped my shares of Celsion for a small profit after reading this article . It was better than a sharp
stick in the eye loss . I will set on the sidelines and watch , if it does go to the .70 to .75 range I will be back in a
heartbeat because I believe this Company is on a right track . If the stock goes up I will move on to the next thing . R

Nov 2011 This is when they announced enrollment beyond 600 . My guess sometime a few months before this
release they found out the initial data was poor a leak happened that is why the PPS went south October through dec
2011, dont be naive insiders always leak no matter what you think. Sometime shortly after they found this wasnt
working out as planned they stumbled on what they thought was an Optimization of RFA . Being there was no way to
conclusively prove that at the stage in the trial they upd the enrollment to 700. Read these statements below and tell
me if my thoughts are wrong .


Nov 2011 CEO states 
Top-line data from 380 events is due "as early as 1 year from now", and this will be accelerated by extending HEAT
enrollment to 700 patients, 
( not real reason IMO they couldnt come out and say this is a flop at 500 patients but good news is 50 of the patients
have double PFS from extended RFA that would not be enough to confirm added time improved PFS.) 
they go one in PR 
the decision to continue enrollment beyond 600, assuming enrollment goes as planned, should provide a benefit in
terms of time to final data of 4-6 months based on their internal modeling.The PFS bar as been set high intentionally
to conserve alpha...an overall survival bar has not been set, but will have to be trending in the right direction.
Thermodox toxicity profile again will be evaluated in parallel on a risk-benefit basis, as it has been in previous DMC
reviews." 
The key word assuming things go as planned. things like 
he says we set the bar high for endpoint , if this is making the patients sicker and they are seeing little benefit then
they would stop at 600 . they were silent most times after this . they knew then it was unlike for the FDA to approve
even at 700 The last set of 300 patients will be undeniable proof this truly works. it would have . The subset is real If
MT is reading this post he would say that little SOB nailed it a regular perry mason. So buy this stuff works dont be
fooled by AF the volume on the buys were not duplicated in sales over past few days . all the shorts did was rob the
faint of heart or ill informed. The big dogs aren't so dumb. 20% float is not controlling wont bounce below 130 . the
institutional investor wont budge on no news

pushing 80 can . I got into the market back in the late 60s . In those days you had a broker dressed in a three piece
suit that called you with tips on what to buy . You went to his office and watched the ticker . It was a thrilling thing .
When you bought a stock you had to do it on the uptick which was 12 1/2 cents above the posted price . Of course in
those days you went down town and women were dressed in nylons , furs and dripping jewelry . Men were all dressed
in suits . Now you have shysters of all colors trying to con you out of your money dressed in Levis and a plaid shirt.
Stocks trade on the penny and it seems that the shorts and hedge fund con artists have control of the market .
Everybody is dressed like bums and pirates no matter where you go . Tattoos and piercings are the norm .These may
