QuinStreet: A Wreck Just Around The Corner
May 12, 2015 12:55 PM ET1 comment
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


QNST's clients face major issues beginning with President Obama’s plan to make
community colleges free.


QNST's client Corinthian College filed for bankruptcy last week, intensifying the for-
profit college industry’s collapse. Two others also knuckled beneath federal
regulators’ allegations that they plunged low-income students into debt.


Remaining potential clients may get weeded out when federal regulations kick in on
July 1. Career colleges will lose out on federal aid money unless students are
prepared for gainful employment.


QNST’s Financial Services division is also at risk as Google pressures QNST. At the
same time, QNST is being forced to increase media spend and watch its customers
turn into competitors.


Credit Suisse reiterates “underperform” and $4 price target. It noted QNST’s risk of
just 20 customers creating over 60 percent of revenue, and expects gross margin of
10.9% in 2015.


One minute QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) was merrily redirecting traffic from Google
searches and picking up millions along the way in exchange for generating leads. The
next minute two trucks flew around the corner, with President Obama at the wheel of one
and Google at the other. Wham!


Once investors understand the true impact of that double-whammy, we think they'll agree
that QuinStreet's business model looks like a beat-up, old jalopy. We'll explain why below
but investors should also take a look at opposing viewpoints here.


*Losing customers: A flick of President Obama's pen and shuttered colleges


QuinStreet gets paid for gathering information when people type in something like "online
college degree," or "credit cards," or "cheap car insurance," and then generating online
sales leads for for-profit schools, credit card companies and auto insurance companies.

But QuinStreet's Education division is clearly taking several huge hits - hits that promise to
thwart future revenue in this area.


For example, President Obama veered into QuinStreet's business with his plan for free
community college.


This plan would damage QuinStreet's for-profit education customer base going forward
because many of the people who might appreciate the flexibility of a for-profit college
would enroll in community college if it became free.


Just as ominously, federal and state regulators are cracking down on QuinStreet's for-
profit higher education customers. A US Senate committee revealed a disturbing
investigation into for-profit education. And attorney generals across the country have been
investigating these colleges' "dubious practices."


Corinthian Colleges (NASDAQ:COCO) filed for bankruptcy last week amid federal
allegations that it deceived students.


The US Department of Education forced Corinthian - already slapped with a $30 million
fine - to close the last of its campuses just a few weeks ago.


With $6 billion in federal student loans and grants, Corinthian was a significant client for
QuinStreet. Its loss was not reflected in QuinStreet's last earnings.


Corinthian proved to be the canary in the for-profit college mine, signaling the intensifying
implosion of the industry. Along with Corinthian, Career Education Corp. and Education
Management Corp. fell beneath federal regulators' crackdown against colleges for
allegedly taking advantage of low income students and hitting them with debt. Regulators
have left behind massive campus closings, Education Management's delisting itself from
Nasdaq, and a loss of nearly $8 billion in market valuation.


Here is the combined stock chart for Career Education (NASDAQ:CECO) and Corinthian
Colleges:

*New, debilitating regs to hit QuinStreet customers


Even more of QuinStreet's education customers or potential customers may get weeded
out when new requirements go into effect July 1.


At that time, career colleges and others will lose access to federal student aid money
unless they prepare students for gainful employment. Annual loan payments will have to
be no more than 8 percent of grads' earnings or 20 percent of discretionary income under
new federal regulations.


QuinStreet's filings say regulations have hurt business previously and may be expected in
the future.


*The past: Attorneys general sue QuinStreet, VA assumes control of website


QuinStreet is no stranger to regulators.


Attorneys general from 20 states investigated QuinStreet's "GIBill.com" and contended
that misleading, false and deceptive elements fooled veterans who clicked on the site
believing it was associated with the US Department of Veterans Affairs. They charged that
the schools QuinStreet listed were the only ones where students could use their military
education benefits. That was not the case.


QuinStreet forked out $2.5 million in the 2012 settlement while denying any wrongdoing.
The agreement, signed by QuinStreet CEO Douglas Valenti, included mandatory website
disclosures and the company's turnover of GIBill.com to Veterans Affairs.

Investors can see, then, that the regulatory environment can certainly cost QuinStreet.


"So," an analyst told TheStreetSweeper, "you're seeing a big, dynamic change here."


*QuinStreet must buy traffic, especially as Google algorithm changes damage
traffic, customers become competitors


We searched for "cheap car insurance" to see if QuinStreet's properties
carinsurance.com, insurance.com or insure.com would appear in our Google search.


A snapshot of the top companies that came up on the first search page shows that
insurance companies like Geico and Progressive show up in the paid ads but also just
below the paid ads.

None of QuinStreet's properties appeared until the second page, where insurance.com
finally pops up in the third slot from the bottom, as shown below. And while searchers are
most likely to click on one of the first couple of search results that appear, page after page
failed to return the other QuinStreet websites.

As if that's not enough, QuinStreet notes the competition is intense and barriers to entry
are relatively low. In the Financial Services division, for example, its MoneyRates.com
faces mammoth rivals like Bankrate.com.


Additionally, QuinStreet must deal with algorithm changes by Google - Panda, for
example, raised traffic to quality sites and lowered low-quality sites' rankings. QuinStreet
expects additional changes in the future and can't predict the cost of those changes to
QuinStreet's sites.


In fact, Google appears to be seeing less and less purpose in a middleman like
QuinStreet.

How so? Look at the top results for our search for "credit cards," a significant search
because QuinStreet is trying to strengthen its Financial Services division with emphasis on
CardRatings.com.


After 25 search page results, CardRatings.com still hadn't shown up (creditcards.com is
not a QuinStreet property, incidentally). What did pop up in the first slot, first page?
"Compare 60+ Credit Cards Online with Google." This indicates that Google sees less and
less usefulness for QuinStreet-type middlemen:


(Source: Google search)


So Google searches are redirecting traffic to big companies like Geico, Esurance or
Progressive. There's not really much use for QuinStreet. These companies can be
expected more frequently to go straight to Google rather than paying middleman
QuinStreet for clicks. The company is seeing the effects already in terms of rising media
costs, which last quarter jumped by $4.2 million.


"That's the problem with their business model," an analyst who requested anonymity told
TheStreetSweeper. "A lot of customers are smart enough to say, 'I'll bypass you and go
pay Google myself.'"


So, customers are becoming competitors and that trend is likely to strengthen.


"That's a secular, long-term trend," said the analyst. "That's why guys like QuinStreet will
always be in trouble."

*Financials disappoint


QuinStreet has a history of operating losses extending through 2013. And while reporting
a mixed quarter in the third quarter of FY 2015, the numbers are not impressive under
closer scrutiny.


Quarterly revenue reached $75.3 million versus $74 million consensus. Top revenue
makers are Financial Services, which rose 7 percent to $30.6 million, and Education,
which also brought in $30.6 million in revenue.


But… Education was flat from the previous year and just managed to be flat primarily
because deferred revenue of $1.6 million got thrown in there.


Gross margins were down one point, shaving those razor-thin margins down to 13
percent. And net loss per share got worse at -$0.07. Operating cash flow over nine
months reached a net loss of -$15 million.


Bulls assume margins will improve, auto insurance customers will grow, Brazil Education
will gain, and changes in lead conversions in Education will help avert some declines due
to regulation pressures.


*Investment bank turns thumbs down


So, is QuinStreet worth our investment dollars? Credit Suisse seems to shout, "It's a
terrible investment."


The bank applied the same methodology to QuinStreet as that applied to the rest of the
Internet sector. Computations estimated future cash flows and considered the time value
of money to determine the DCF or discounted cash flow.


Credit Suisse analysts led by Stephen Ju, wrote:


"…we have based our price target on DCF, which remains at $4."


"We have used a weighted average cost of capital of 14.0% with terminal growth
rate expectation of 0%."


Credit Suisse's reiterated "underperform" and $4 price target for 12 months came out May
6, when QuinStreet's shares fetched from $5.32 to $5.70.

Comments (1)


The investment bank noted 20 customers create over 60 percent of revenue. So anyone
cutting back on marketing spend to QuinStreet could significantly damage revenue. It also
expects unimpressive gross margins at 10.9 percent in 2015 and 13.6 percent in 2016.


So, Credit Suisse, an investment bank that made Fortune Magazine's list of world's most
admired companies, obviously considers QuinStreet a poor investment.


*Conclusion


QuinStreet is currently valued as if it is growing like crazy. Yet, its own executives - though
they may be influenced by their top compensation packages exceeding $4 million - say it
can grow only 5 percent.


We think that's wildly optimistic, considering the debilitating trends threatening to spin out
of control: Google is muscling in to grab Financial Services, President Obama and
regulators are pushing out Education, and customers are becoming competitors on the
jagged, hazard-strewn road ahead of QuinStreet.


TheStreetSweeper believes even the $4 price target from Credit Suisse is too generous.
We wouldn't be surprised to see this wreck send shares crumpling to $3 or lower.
