Orient Paper's Top Supplier: An Empty Shell Owned by ONP's CEO
Aug. 10, 2010 4:45 AM ET184 comments
by: Chinese Company Analyst


This article is about how Orient Paper’s (NYSEMKT:ONP) top supplier is either non-
operating or very small, and is majority-owned by ONP's CEO. I will also discuss certain
suspicious share transfers by this supplier in June 2009.


But first, I want to discuss a recent development last week. Last Tuesday, Orient Paper
announced that Loeb & Loeb, the law firm it hired to run its internal fraud investigation,
hired Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited to “assist” it with its
investigation into the issues raised by Muddy Waters, LLC. Per the press release,


Deloitte will provide support to Loeb & Loeb, which is working with the Company's
audit committee, in connection with the independent review of the accounting
aspects of the issues raised and the investigation of the relevant financial
transactions and customer relationships.


Deloitte is not performing an audit. It is merely “assisting” and “providing support” to Loeb
in the investigation. Much hinges on what Loeb asks Deloitte to do. I’ve previously written
that Loeb is not the right firm to be leading the ONP internal investigation. I do believe that
Deloitte is an appropriate financial consulting firm to investigate the fraud. But it’s unclear
what Loeb will ask of Deloitte, and whether Deloitte will need to sign off on any aspect of
the investigation. As a result, I could certainly see a scenario where the investigation finds
no wrongdoing, despite compelling evidence that the company is committing fraud.


Now, let’s move to the new evidence that ONP is falsifying its financial statements.


ONP’S Main Supplier is an Empty Shell Primarily Owned by ONP’s Chairman


According to SEC filings, ONP’s largest supplier is Xushui County Dongfang Trading Co.
Ltd. (“Xushui Dongfang”). From 2006 to 2008, Xushui Dongfang is listed as ONP’s largest
supplier, supplying $14.6m, $15.9m, $28.5m, and $30.7m of goods in 2006, 2007, 2008
and 2009. See the 10Ks for 2009, 2008 and 2007. Note that “Xushui County” is the same
county that ONP is based in.


Yet according to third party reports, Xushui Dongfang is an empty shell company with no
reported revenue. Here is a third party credit report from Qingdao Inter-Credit Services
Pte Co., Ltd. (“Inter-credit”). Inter-credit is a large independent credit agency that provides

a variety of credit-related services for clients. It operates out of 12 branches, and has 200
employees, including lawyers, accountants and debt collectors. It compiles independent
reports on Chinese companies, using data from AIC filings and other resources – a
sample report can be seen on their website here.


For any readers who doubt the authenticity of Inter-credit reports, here are their reports on
China Sunergy (NASDAQ:CSUN) and Solarfun (SOLF), both of which I believe are more
accurately reflecting themselves in their SEC financial statements than CMFO,
OTCPK:CSKI or ONP.


Here is Inter-credit’s report on Xushui Dongfang, as well as the Chinese and English
translation of the information received by Inter-credit from the Xushui AIC office:


Inter-Credit Report on Xushui Dongfang


Xushui Dongfang AIC information - Chinese Original


Xushui Dongfang AIC information - English Translation


The last year in which Xushui Dongfang reported financial results was 2007. In 2007, ONP
claims to have purchased $15.9 million in product from Xushui Dongfang (at the then
prevailing exchange rate); however, Xushui Dongfang only reported approximately
$200,000 in revenue in 2007 according to AIC reports.


Equally as important, Xushui Dongfang’s majority shareholder is none other than ONP’s
Chairman and CEO. Liu Zhenyong owns 70% of Xushui Dongfang, while Li Jianjun owns
30%. Zhenyong has contributed approximately $500,000 (RMB 3.5m) of capital to
Dongfang, while Jianjun has contributed approximately $220,000 (RMB 1.5m).


Naturally, ONP made no disclosure in its SEC filings that there were any related parties
involved in the purchases from its largest supplier. This is likely a violation of SEC
regulations.


It’s also a possible sign of fraud. Xushui Dongfang was likely used to generate fake
purchase invoices to show the auditors. Because ONP never disclosed the common
shareholder, it is unlikely that ONP’s auditors looked into Xushui Dongfang. Xushui
Dongfang's fake sales to ONP may thus have been used to inflate ONP's SEC financial
statements. Xushui Dongfang would have helped to make ONP appear much larger than it
is.

This revelation was first made on July 22, 2010 in the Chinese media when the 21st
Century Business Herald (which is considered to be the “Wall Street Journal of China”)
published an article on the allegations made by Muddy Waters, LLC. The article was the
lead story for the entire newspaper that day – to see a PDF of the newspaper with the
article, click here (it’s the article with “AMEX” in the headline and "ONP" throughout the
text). The article quoted a local tax bureau official as saying that Xushui Dongfang is “just
like a shell company.”

And here is the excerpt that discusses Xushui Dongfang:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/219704-orient-papers-top-supplier-an-empty-shell-owned-by-onps-ceo 4/57


In the upstream chain, this reporter discovered that a company named “Xushui
County Dongfang Trading Co. Ltd” (henceforth termed Dongfang Trading Co. Ltd),
according to ONP’s financial report, this company, with a (Chinese) name similar to
the Company’s, has been ONP’s largest raw materials supplier since 2006.


In the three years from 2007 through 2009, this company’s supplier share is at levels
of 53%, 50% and 37%, respectively.


Information shows that this company was established in 2001, registered at Xushui
County AIC, and its main business is waste material collection. In the application
information provided in the early stages of start-up, the company registration
address contained five houses located in “Xushui County Nan He Shou Ying Village
West”, and it also comes with lease contracts signed with the village committee.


This company’s initial registered capital was 500,000 yuan ($60,500 at the time),
with two shareholders. The first shareholder was Liu Zhen Yong, the second was Li
Chen. Li Chen once was a Director of ONP but resigned from the post in 2009. In
ONP’s published documents, his drawn salary from ONP was US$4,826 in 2008 and
US$4,093 in 2009. Li Chen now holds 201,164 ONP shares, which is 1.1% of shares
offered.


Not long after Dongfang Trading Co. Ltd was registered, the legal representation
was transferred from Li Chen to a man named Li Jian Jun and equity rose to
500,000 yuan. From what this reporter understands, Li Jian Jun is a native of
Xushui. Also, Dongfang Trading Co. Ltd and the HBOP factory address are in the
same place in Nan He Shou Ying Village.


“Dongfang Trading Co. Ltd in the most recent two years almost doesn’t have any
revenue,” the aforementioned tax bureau insider informed me, “It’s just like a shell
company.”


June Share Transfers


That’s not all.


Xushui Dongfang also somehow owned 4.4% of ONP’s shares prior to June 2009. We
have no idea how it received those shares because there is no disclosure relating to it in
the SEC filings prior to its sale of shares.


Click here for the 8K from June 30, 2009. Here is the first paragraph (bold added for
emphasis):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/219704-orient-papers-top-supplier-an-empty-shell-owned-by-onps-ceo 5/57


"On June 25, 2009 (the “Closing Date”), Orient Paper, Inc., a Nevada corporation
(the “Company” or “Orient Paper”), consummated a Purchase and Sale Agreement
with Xushui District Dongfang Trading Limited Company (“Xushui Dongfang”),
Barron Partners, LP, Fernando Liu and Golden1177 LP (Barron Partners, LP,
Fernando Liu and Golden1177 LP collectively, the “Purchasers”). Under the terms of
the agreement, Xushui Dongfang agreed to sell to the Purchasers an aggregate of
2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $.375 per share, for an
aggregate purchase price of $750,000. To facilitate payment and receipt of the
purchase price, the Company agreed to pay or cause to be paid $500,000 or the
Renminbi (Chinese currency) equivalent to Xushui Dongfang, a company
organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). In return,
$500,000 of the purchase price would be held in escrow for the benefit of the
Company and used to pay the Company’s current and past-due legal fees, investor
relations expenses, and auditing fees of a Big 10 accounting firm to be appointed by
the Company.”


What? Why did ONP’s largest supplier own 2,000,000 shares of Orient Paper, or about
4.4% of Orient Paper’s share count?


In no previous SEC filing had Orient Paper disclosed the sale or contribution of shares to
its largest supplier! Xushui Dongfang was unlikely to have bought the shares on the open
market, given that this normally requires regulatory approvals. Foreign equity purchases
by PRC nationals and entities require approval by the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, and are generally not allowed without compelling business reasons.


But this is beside the point. The question remains: Why does ONP’s largest supplier
feature the following?


1. It did not report any revenue in 2008 and 2009, and only $200k of revenue in 2007.
2. It Is 70% owned by the CEO of ONP.
3. It owned 2m shares of ONP prior to July 2009.
4. Why wasn’t the 70% ownership disclosed in SEC filings? The purchase of products


from Xushui Dongfang (keep in mind that Xushui Dongfang comprised 30% to 50% of
ONP’s cost of goods sold from 2007 to 2009) was certainly a related party transaction
by ONP, and a particularly dubious one at that.


The answer to these questions, in my opinion, is that Xushui Dongfang is a shell company
with no real underlying business that was used as part of CEO Zhenyong Liu’s efforts to
falsify Orient Paper’s SEC financial statements. It likely also aided his efforts to fabricate

Author’s reply »  How do you think that it's irrelevant that ONP's top supplier (comprising 30% to 50% of

Here is a good explanation posted on Dr. Eric Jackson's blog:


"DongFang Trading company:


In China, when goods are imported or exported, the government requires the use of an Import/Export license. This
license is not cheap. Some of them can cost as much as $350,000USD or more and they are specialized and specific
as to what they can be used for. Large companies Like Intel, Motorola, and other western companies the US investor
would be familiar with more that likely have their own import/export license they purchased from the government at a
hefty fee to import raw material and export finished goods. Smaller companies that don’t have the resources to buy a
license have to use other means to export. Enter the trading company. A trading company is in every sense of the
word the ultimate middle man. It is not unlike acceptance banking from the days prior to wire transfer. In the case of
ONP, DongFang is owned by the chairman. It appears to have been originally set up as a Trading company to import
and export paper and paper related products as provided by the license. Most smaller non public companies would
list a trading company as a supplier because they would pay the trading company(not the actual supplier) for the
imported goods purchased. The trading company in turn then pays the supplier and normally pays any taxes due to
the government, and takes a small fee for the transaction. That is how a trading company makes money from a
transaction. ONP looks to be using DongFang more as an export/import license instead of a trading company and
(addressing the Beijing subsidiary) still doing some actual trading with third party companies. I am not sure of the
legalities of using the Im/Ex license like this but it appears to be going on. If ONP is using Dongfang as a Im/Ex
license then DongFang would indeed show no or very little revenue and the cost would be reflected on the ONP
books. It would be a cleaner way to account for Im/Ex transactions that way. So yes, DongFang is a shell ,but it is a
required and legitimate entity."

To state specifically: Eric Jackson posted it on his blog and the article was originally from Edward Hoots.
Either way, his point makes sense


09 Aug 2010, 05:26 PM


Chimin Sang, Contributor
Even Eric Jackson acknowledges that Dongfang was owned by ONP's chairman. By definition, the
transactions between ONP and Dongfang belong to related party transactions and they should be properly
reflected in 10-K.


ONP is having lots of legal troubles here.

that makes no sense. It would only make sense to someone who also makes no sense. Logic, it would
appear, it certainly not your long suit. On the other hand, fraud does appear to be your long suit. First of all,
you can't set up a company with an import/export license that trades for you and have it show no financial
information. It has to record its transactions. It can't just pass them through without recording them. Second of
all, there would be no reason for the chairman to set up another company to have the import/export license.
Third, while Eric Jackson claims not to know whether it would be illegal to do it the way it speculates it is
being done, I can't tell you that it is certainly not legal.

I don't particurlarly hold Loeb and Loeb in high regard, they have some decent lawyers and some that aren't
so great. Loeb and Loeb has some lawyers I consider competent and some that I consider not so competent. 
I don't hold Deloitte in particular high regard. They did very poorly on their PCAOB audit, in my opinion.
Deloitte has some accountants that are competent and some that are not competent. 
Loeb merely provided advice. If you have a lawsuit against you, even if you are guilty, you can certainly high
Loeb and Loeb to defend you. Loeb and Loeb will happily provide advice to guilty parties for a fee. 
Deloitte also merely provided advice. Deloitte will happily represent and provide advice to companies who
have committed financial fraud for a fee. 
The audit was done by a committee from the board of directors and was not allowed to be done by
management who refused to allow them on to the facilities to inspect and evaluate the production
equipement. Clear indication of fraud. 
by the way, you never know what you get with Deloitte. Like many other large accounting firms, they let local
firms pay them to use their name for a fee. Deloitte claims no responsibility or liability for these firms, but
ignorant folk like yourself make dumb assumptions as a result. Go look on Deloitte's website to see for
yourself, it is one of the reasons they are Deloitte Tomahtsu (and not Deloitte & Touche).

Obviously the failure to disclose related party transactions(ie. that the chairman of ONP is 70% owner of the main
supplier) is an illegal activity and will be looked at with scrutiny not only in the pending class action but also the SEC
as this thing needs to be examined.


This is a rather large point in hte article, ONP's own 10-K's state these expenses to Donfang yet Donfang itself reports
no income/revenue? It doesn't take a multimillion dollar audit to point this out or even to see it.


Thank you 21st century business herald and chinesecompany. I feel strongly that the 3rd party report(from the 21st
century business herald)(the only report/opinion with no financial motive) verified much of what was in the MW claim
and carries much more weight than an analyst who may be long or short pushing his own position for his own
financial benefit. So this in effect just verifies basically what came out June 28th, 2010.


www.orientalpapercorpo...


please view that as well, OPAI video(prior to the purchase of the 2 photo lines btw) states 8 production lines. This is
prior to the purchase of an additional 2 photo lines. ONP doesn't even state 8 lines today after the addition of the 2
photo paper lines(see SEC filings). The OPAI video also states 863 employees, the SEC paperwork for ONP(OPAI) at
the time says 600.


This will be my first and only post on this site.

John Bird AKA chinesecompanyanalyst AKA waldo_mushman (waldomushman.com) has or has had a short position
in this stock and his only purpose is to attack ONP to cause the share price to fall so he can make money. It seems
like most, if not all, information he has comes from the Muddy Waters' report on ONP or the translation provided by
Muddy Waters of the 21st Century Business Herald article. How accurate is this translation??? How accurate is
Muddy Waters' first ever report?? This same report that John Bird relies on so heavily for ALL his information was
written AFTER W.A.B. Capital approached ONP with the offer to provide a favorable report FOR A FEE! The owner of
W.A.B. Capitol is none other than Carson Block's father. Carson Block is one of TWO people who are Muddy Waters.
Doesn't this all seem a little suspicious???? I think the fraud in all this is the short and distort attack by MUDDY
WATERS and JOHN BIRD.


Earnings are coming out and they are predicted to be 30% above expected results so of course JOHN BIRD wants to
protect his short position and that of his puppet masters.


Funny thing is ANYBODY can blog on SeekingAlpha and pass themselves off as an expert. JOHN BIRD talks like he
is an expert but lost a significant amount of money on another short position on CSKI. Instead of taking his lumps on a
bad position he sued the auditors claiming - you guessed it FRAUD! I think the only fraud is JOHN BIRD and MUDDY
WATERS but as that is only my personal opinion I suggest that anybody who reads this do their OWN investigating
and form their OWN opinion.


My position is LONG ONP!

Author’s reply »  If you don't think the translation is accurate, do your own translation of the article. I've
attached a PDF of the original chinese article within my seeking alpha post.


Carson Block has roundly dismissed the allegation that Muddy Waters wrote its negative report because ONP
would not pay them money for a positive report. I believe that the company made up the blackmail allegation
to discredit an in-depth and compelling discussion of how ONP is defrauding investors.


The "earnings" are based on made up numbers.

asked them to let me take a look at things related to me before the article is sent out to print. The reporter
agreed. However, the reporter never showed me what he wrote about me. I called him, emailed him, but he

A couple of days ago the short positions in ONP increased from 100k to 600k so it was clear that another "research"

Now i guess that you will try to re-buy the 500k shares before the results (August, 16). Let's see at what price can you
do that.

As far as what one said is fact, whether he is long or short, people can come to their own conclusions. ONP's own
story simply has too many holes in it.


Those who yelled "He is short!" sound like those who would like to burn people hundreds of years ago when the
people told them the earth was not flat.


As for how highly regarded a firm is, there are good examples how its reputation changes when its behaviors are
revealed. In addition, I remember what people said in Tyco international's case: they trusted its CEO's integrity. Its
CEO bought millions of its shares when it was coming down. He was still charged and admitted it's fraud.

Author’s reply »  It doesn't matter whether the uploads are linked on my website or within the Seeking Alpha
website. The content of the reports would be the same wherever they are linked, and that content provides
compelling evidence that ONP is falsifying its financial statements.

In my opinion, Seeking Alpha has lost all credibility in allowing false information to be disseminated (my personal
opinion), and CSKI and ONP should consider them a defendant in any lawsuits that may occur. I will never give any
attention to this website again.

This author is claiming huge, serious fraud of a Chinese company. The links he provides as evidence throughout the
report are to his own personally managed, owned and maintained blogger's PDF upload site, files.wordpress.com.


Every single link of evidence are to PDF's he has uploaded to files.wordpress.com, which is a blogger's website
where you can store documents. NONE, and I mean NONE, seriously NONE of the evidence he provides links to
come from a news or business website. They are ALL, I mean ALL from files.wordpress.com, which he can personally
edit and make up evidence for. I thought it was your policy to link to real news or financial websites!


The one of two times he actually links to something else beyond his PDF upload station, files.wordpress.com, he
claims that an article published on 21st Century Business Herald 's website contained evidence to prove some point
not even related to his argument in this article. By his own admission, that article is no longer on the website, yet he
still links to the news site's main page, which is pointless because the article is not even there. Then he provides
another PDF (yes another document that user's can edit themselves) to prove the article was once there. I'm sorry but
how on earth is this honest reporting?


The only other time he links to something else besides his own websites, he links to the main index page of inter-
credit.com, but that link does not provide the evidence or PDFs that he claims as it is just the main and first page of
that company.


Personally I am absolutely dumbfounded that you would publish this article and as an avid reader, I believe this article
violates your terms of use with regard to publication.

It's quite sad that trust is so blinding. The author presents compelling info regarding a company that traded @
10c/share a year ago and you guys bash his intentions and integrity??? He's trying to help you! If you have
arguments to counter him, go for it, but this is a joke. Chinese accounting practices are notoriously dishonest and this
is a well argued case. There are dozens of Chinese companies with P/Es around 5, many in more compelling
industries than OPN. Many of them are likely misrepresented as well.


PS. Wow, CSKI is up 5% on an earnings report after losing 50% in 6 months. Pop the champagne!

The worst investors select very specific time frames to act like they are good. Yes, it is down 50% in 6
months, but it was up 100% in 12, so it is flat, and now up another 5%. Your time selection proves your lack of
investing talent and focuses on limited time frames to "prove" some kind of point... it fails to do that.

Would you like to compare portfolio performance? The single most misused word in any competitive arena is
"talent." Obviously I understand this game better than you as I don't sit on positions while they lose 50%. Ever

Bought at $4.40 and sold at $7.47 the next day, bought in again at $4.46 and sold at $5.55. Last month alone
I'm up over 100%.

Whether or not I agree with the content of this article is not actually the most important issue for me with its
publication. Apparently one person with a vested short interest in the outcome can post repeatedly on this site with
the idea of slandering a company and a link to the article will appear in multiple places on the web as though it is
legitimate news.I consider that to be misleading, as anyone who thinks it through or observes the kneejerk reactions
of the shortsellers who feed off this type of thing would. Since there is little reason to put out articles that effectively
deliver the same message mere days before the audit report is published, this one attempts something new, namely
to claim that the result of the audit itself will be questionable, since it is "unclear what Loeb will ask of Deloitte". The
very motivations for writing the article seem unclear even in the mind of its author. If his or her feeling is that the audit
itself needs to be rendered irrelevant or inaccurate, then it follows to maintain a short position, but in writing article
after article with this repeated theme and suggesting that the audit itself will prove nothing, the author appears to
pursue a longterm attack of the company. For a shortseller this modus operandi seems misguided, since they wouldn't
be shortsales unless they only worked for short periods of time.

Chinese Company Analyst, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I thought I was being perfectly clear. For the avoidance of doubt, let me try to be even more
direct:


1. ONP is falsifying its financial statements. The actual underlying business is much smaller, its revenue
growth much slower, and its margins much lower than its SEC financial statements indicate.  
2. Its largest supplier (which comprises 30% to 50% of its COGS) is actually a shell company with no or
minimal operating revenue that is 70% owned by ONP's CEO.  
3. Loeb & Loeb is not an objective third party, because it receives substantial revenue from services to
Chinese RTOs, some of which are fraudulent. Deloitte is not performing an audit, and is only assisting Loeb.
Therefore, I have no faith whatsoever that the investigation will objectively investigate whether ONP is
committing fraud.


What part of my arguments are not clear and direct? What part of my thought process seems "unclear even in
the mind of the author"? I'd be happy to clarify.

Why do you care about ONP so much that you have to spend, what seems a lot of time reporting "bad" things
regarding the company? Who cares? All I can say is that it MUST mean you have an agenda. And that agenda is to
simply make money by reporting, what you deem "wrong" about any one company that you are short on. You do US
no favor by your "reporting". I don't care what you have to say about ANYTHING. So, stop it and move on to a better

You're an anonymous blogger with no accountability and no identity. ONP's CEO, ONP's current auditors, Roth,
Harbinger and Hudson Securities, Loeb Law Firm and now Deloitte, are all public figures with long standing
reputations. They have accountability and identities on the line and have found nothing wrong (Deloitte is the latest
which will come soon). You hide behind a computer screen. No one knows who you are, except you and your maker.


Frankly I cannot fathom how any one would take your article here (which links to another blogging website via PDFs
that you uploaded yourself), seriously. My opinion is that you are a complete fraud yourself.


If you are so certain about this, given that your opinion differs so drastically from several large firms that have
accountability, why don't you make yourself accountable and publish your real name, with a link something that
verifies it. Maybe a linkedin.com profile???

Worth noting is that the Chinese government must license financial reporting agencies such as Inter-Credit which
authorizes electronic access to summary filings made with the SAT. It is also worth noting that the second largest
scrap supplier that ONP reports has annual sales in an amount less than what ONP claims to purchase from them. In

more interesting than some pundit's view on where interest rates are going.


But they, like the SEC, want to make sure they get the story right, and not be swayed by people with agendas

Well this is where I think you're wrong and full of crap, and in my opinion the fact that you make up lies (i.e.
you just got called out for) is exactly the issue here. Yes, it's not the final issue on whether ONP is committing
fraud. In my opinion, Deloitte will be the final say on here since they have identity and accountabiliy whereas
you're an anonymous blogger. So yes, the lies you make up in addition to providing bent versions of the truth
go to the heart of the issue here.


You just made up a lie about U.S. newspapers reporting on ONP's fraud-- given this came along with a lot of
other information you provided. When called out on it, you recant but say everything else you say is correct---
well sir, had I not called you out, this would have gone down as just another unchecked lie that scares people
into selling shares, which in my opinion is your only real intent here.

Author’s reply »  I mis-spoke when I mentioned that a major U.S. publication has written on the ONP story. I
have not misspoken when I have said that (1) ONP is fabricating its SEC financial statements, (2) its top
supplier is an empty shell 70% owned by its CEO, (3) it can't have achieved its stated revenue growth with an
80% turnover of its top 10 customers, (4) it's unlikely that the company is achieving revenue growth, margins
and inventory turnover that are better than its larger competitors that have newer machines and better
economies of scale, (5) its CFO prior to Winston Yen (Jing Hao) was 25 years old, etc.

hah, you're too funny brother. When it comes to alleging fraud on a huge scale, what you refer to as
"misspeaking" mean lying and fraud. Mispeaking is "Hey can I have a Corona" -- Corona comes and you say
"woops I mean Amstel."


Saying, " Leading newspapers in China and the U.S. are taking note of the litany of evidence that ONP is
falsifying its financial statements" is an outright lie in an attempt to scare people into selling shares, and in my
opinion you are committing the fraud here.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/219704-orient-papers-top-supplier-an-empty-shell-owned-by-onps-ceo 23/57


1) ONP is fabricating its SEC financial statements.


Provide proof instead of comparing to SAIC filings. Which part of the SEC financial statement is fabricated, or
is the entire SEC financial statement fabricated?


2) Its top supplier is an empty shell


Provide proof that the "empty shell" company is committing fraud. Is Dongfang or ONP committing an illegal
activity by having Dongfang as a holding of ONP?


3) It can't have achieved its stated revenue growth


Provide proof why it did not achieve its stated revenue growth instead of making assumptions based on the
customer turnover. Have you personally verified with the customers that they indeed are not doing the amount
of business with ONP that is claimed? Please provide evidence other than "I spoke to a cleaning lady on the
phone".....


4) It's unlikely that the company is achieving revenue growth.


Please indicate why you find that the company could not be achieving revenue growth but would be able to
purchase a large custom machine and continue building?


As a ardent detractor of ONP and a frequest poster on Seeking Alpha, I feel it is important that you provide
factual evidence for your points instead of hearsay and speculation. Thank you.

Off topic - on Doug ONP last movie, did anyone pay attention to the amount on the contract (@3:01)? it's a 100M
RMB contract or about 15M$. Like 3 times higher that the top one from 2009 and 5 times the top one from 2008.


2010 looks quite promising for ONP.

i'm long ONP. I bought more shares @ 4.91 thanks to this article.


1. I can't see the whole management keep working as usual. At this stage of a fraud scenario, you should have a
couple of resignations among them. 
They know the reality of the business and so far no resignation.


2. I can't see ONP board allowing the earning pre-release especially with their lawyers now advising them on what to
do.


3. I can't see the CFO inflating revenue and at the same time showing a 80% turnover in his top 10 customers. it's
uneeded. it's unusual. it's a non sense.


4. I can't see the CEO falsificating a contract. Showing number 3 times higher than current top customer. Allowing a
US guy to pict him with it. etc. and all this under the guidance of his lawyer.

companies have a similar names and have Dongfang in their name? Type in Dongfang trading in yahoo:

The thing is that it cannot be disputed because his evidence is not verifiable because there is no link from a real
source, but just from his website. Even if his information provided is true, it does not give any evidence of the serious
accusation of fraud. The only way that this can be disputed is by someone contacting and getting info from Dongfang
Trading and/or ONP putting out information in regards to it. He has provided zero evidence of fraud. Especially since
SAIC documents are not neccessarily an indication of a company's actual revenues. By this being posted as an
article, it is manipulating the price of the stock by it leading to investors taking it as it is 100% correct. Can you or
anyone else say that this represents his accusation of fraud and be 100% confident in saying that? His other articles
are very misleading as I stated in a dispute to Seeking Alpha. Which his misstatements show that his agenda is to
manipulate.

CCA will say it is the same CEO/Chairman, but its a different company, so again. ONP is in the clear. I've

ONP has a seperate entity: Dongfang Zhiye Holding Limited (“Dongfang Holding”) was formed as a holding

Xushui County Dongfang Trading Company Limited is a seperate entity from the one mentioned above and

Dongfang Zhiye Holding Limited is a British Virgin Islands company, basically nothing, no revenue, etc.


Donfang Trading is in China, its actual address is the same address as that of ONP, chairman Liu owns a
majority stake in the company.


Donfang of the BVI is disclosed to the public, Donfang of China also owned by Liu is not disclosed to the
public/investors(this is likely illegal) and generates no revenue or little revenue compared with what ONP
states in its 10k SEC filing forms which means someone is fudging numbers. This "shell" company also was
not disclosed to investors and it is a pretty important piece of information to disclose(that you own the
supplier). You be the judge though..but don't rely on guys who post 100 times a day on a yahoo board from
everything from "Rosen was paid by MW to file a civil case" to "lawsuit withdrawn 1 day after it was filed no

"This revelation was first made on July 22, 2010 in the Chinese media when the 21st Century Business Herald (which
is considered to be the “Wall Street Journal of China”) published an article on the allegations made by Muddy Waters,
LLC. The article was the lead story for the entire newspaper that day – to see a PDF of the newspaper with the article,
click here (it’s the article with “AMEX” in the headline and "ONP" throughout the text). The article quoted a local tax
bureau official as saying that Xushui Dongfang is “just like a shell company.”"


Your proof cannot be a PDF which is easily made up. It must be linked to the original source. If that article has been
removed because its editors determined it was a fraud, then you cannot use it as a key point in your article.

it is not a subsidiary of ONP. It is a completely different entity. There is nowhere stating that Xushui County

If it is ONP, are you then choosing to believe one set of their reported numbers and not the other? If so, why believe
any of the information unless you are cherry picking information to bolster your short argument--not being objective.


So what is it: 
ONP reporting info to Inter-Credit is accurate/not accurate? 
ONP reporting info to SAIC is accurate/not accurate? 
ONP reporting info to SEC is accurate/not accurate?


What do the Chinese authorities do to company officials that commit fraud against the state and/or investors?


What do the US and Chinese authorities do to individuals that make false accusations of fraud against a Chinese
company/individual?

There are dozens of different parties that can get this information. Inter-credit is one of many. If they stop

ONP reporting info to Inter-Credit is accurate/not accurate? Inter-credit gets info from AIC. 
ONP reporting info to SAIC is accurate/not accurate? Sometimes it's accurate, sometimes it's inaccurate. My
belief is that ONP originally provided accurate information to the AIC, and then after Muddy Waters published
its report, they submitted inaccurate information to the AIC. 
ONP reporting info to SEC is accurate/not accurate? Not accurate.


What do the Chinese authorities do to company officials that commit fraud against the state and/or investors?
I don't know.


What do the US and Chinese authorities do to individuals that make false accusations of fraud against a
Chinese company/individual? Put them in jail. Fortunately, I'm not making any false accusations.

It is amusing that despite Muddy Waters having removed the original allegations from its site, the other hucksters
continue to perpetrate the con job. The jig is up, boys. Continuing to confuse subsidiaries with unrelated firms or
fantasizing about shell companies isn't going to change the audit results.


There was a compelling point made earlier in the thread: no resignations have occurred at ONP. Unlike Enron and
other scams, there is nary a rat seeking to leave the sinking ship.


Why?


The ship is not sinking. The allegations lack any substance. Not a single executive fears being connected with the
fraud at ONP because there is no fraud at ONP.


Soon enough, the audit will be released, the debate will end, and the smear artists will disappear.


But not for long. There is always another short-selling scam to be conducted against the gullible shareholders of
another innocent company.


And it is so easy to change screen names. Maybe next time, the charge can be led by someone posing as Brazilian
Company Analyst. Or Turkish Company Analyst. Or Zimbabwean Company Analyst. Or...

When I contacted the SEC, I requested that they correlate the IP addresses of those who have libeled ONP for profit.
I was told that is standard operating procedure and that they definitely intend to do so, both with regard to this site and
Yahoo message boards. ONP CFO Winston Yen also mentioned that Orient Paper is likely to seek civil redress that
will include subpoenaing the records of Internet Service Providers.


Of course, if there has been no wrongdoing the posters have absolutely nothing about which to worry.

The SEC is fully aware of who I am and I have spoken with them probably 20 times. They have my e-mail
because we exchange e-mail on a fairly regular basis.


You supposition that the SEC is concerned about Yahoo posts is childish and maybe a bit sad. The SEC is
concerned about protecting the American public from the people who own the printing presses. New stock is
printed and redistributed to the investing public. If that "currency" is fraudulently presented or promoted many
people can be injured. Short attacks do not effect the underlying reality of a company. You blather about the
short sellers doing harm. We are self interested but truth is our ally, not deception.

Well nice work Chinese Company Analyst. You could have saved us all a lot of back and forth if you had even known

me really knew where to get this article. So lets let Waldo take over your arguments for now. At least he writes better,
makes slightly better arguments and seems to be more resourceful. Besides that, this article from what google
translator provided me just cites and references MW allegations, and does little make its own analysis-- similar to all
the law firms that are now scavenging, they just reference MW's report (which has been retracted by its author). Also,
it has little to do with your original article you published here. You're just throwing a bunch of stuff up against the wall
to see what sticks, and this wouldn't have even stuck if Waldo didn't bail you out with a link.

Then you need to retranslate it. The 21st century business herald lawyer did his own digging and was the one
that found that ONP's chairman was 70% owner of the shell company which also just happend to have the
same address and which also had less revenue than what ONP stated by a rather large margin.

Further, the reporter states that chairman liu was basically ellusive in answering some of his questions.


Further, the reporter verified that MW did indeed identify the correct company. Meaning the spin release that
MW translated the chinese name for HBOP differently meant that it was an entirely different company even
though the chairman was listed as being the owner, same address location, etc, etc, etc

Ok, the whole smoking gun thing is done. No one cares if one reporter made some opinion interjection.
Deloitte, a very sophisticated financial and audit firm, will be looking at the same things as this reporter and
making its own opinion. So stay tuned for that. I think we'd all like to see what a legitimate financial firm with
years of history, accountability and identity has to say about this. Not some anonymous blogger.


Beyond that, talk about insider ownership? ONP is 30% owned by insiders. They only floated about 65% of its
shares. Does that sound like a company committing fraud to you? Not me.

What information did Muddy Waters have access to that they never provided, to show the operating
subsidiary they got the financial information from because ONP's AIC documents match their SEC filings? If
they did look at the correct evidence, then they reported the incorrect information from the subsidiary. So
please tell me what information they used to ascertain that the revenue was largely overstated except for their
non-expert opinion. There is also no verification that the CEO of ONP currently has a 70% ownership in
Xushui County Donfang Trading Company Limited. Even if he does, how does that point to any indication of
fraud? People can own multiple businesses. So even if he does own it, it does not mean that they are a
subsidiary or entity of ONP.

If you think the supplier story is a lie, there are several competitors to Inter-Credit that would be happy to sell
you some credit reports you can compare. Attorneys are readily available who will hot foot it down to the local
SAIC and get you copies of whatever you need. Why don't you try that approach.


Apparently supporting your hollow opinions is so much easier if you don't have to provide any substance. You
are ignorant and lazy. The data that has been independently sourced about this company presents a very
compelling story of fraud. Your support of their integrity is limited to the personal attacks you launch at every

This is a worthwhile site, but in this instance there has been a dereliction of vigilance. The unsubstantiated charges
against ONP cannot be documented, as verified by the fact that we are weeks into this contrived controversy and still
awaiting tangible evidence of wrongdoing by Orient Paper.


It's a little late in the game to start demanding proof. The damage has been done, the perpetrators have cleansed
their site of references to "the matter", and many ONP shareholders have been financially compromised.

It is funny how you and some of the other shorts hide your identity and act as if you have all this information
that no one has access to. All if your comments and statements on the websites and blogs are all misleading.
This article in particular. Even if the documentation you presented is true and the CEO of ONP is a majority
owner in the supplier and the AIC documents show low revenue, that shows zero evidence of fraud. They
have raw materials that have been seen on video and other representatives that have visited the company,
they have working equipment. Is their equipment as good as a larger paper company? of course not. 
Does the top 10 customers changing 80% when they equate for about 35% revenue represent fraud? Of
course not. Is there any indication that them lowering their employees and thus raising cost per employee
equate to fraud? of course not. Do ONP's SAIC documents match the SEC documents? yes.


Advertising is also mentioned as a reason for fraud as their advertsing expense is very minimal at best, but
advertising is a small portion of marketing. Correct? Their SGA costs which include market positioning are
significant(over $300,000 in 2008 and over $1 million in 2009 due to investor relation things on top of other
SGA costs such as market positioning).

At the risk of betraying a confidence I will tell you exactly why they backed off.


Both partners have substantial assets in China. The counsel they hired enlightened them to the risks posed
by Chinese law when making derrogatory comments about a company. Unlike in the US, freedom of speech
is not a protected right. Based on advice of their attorneys they decided that it was not worth the risk to keep
adding fuel to whatever fire might exist down the line.

The shorts don't come out to attack in the open until they have set up the short position. After they come out, they are
mostly just going to be buyers. If you sell, you are doing exactly what they want you to do.


Based on what is happening to ONP, I am mildly bullish. Will try to find out more about this company. If I have

Sir,


I just saw this new circus on ONP from a link on CMFO quote page. If I had something unique and valuable,
do you think I'd be sharing that before taking a position? And if anybody's argument here were firm and
convincing enough, there wouldn't be a loud and interesting circus like this on Seeking Alpha.


A piece of junk could be a bargain if someone takes it down from a pedestal and throws it to the roadside. If
the shorts beat down the price of a stock like ONP to a level low enough, it will be interesting long candidate.


If you have shorted, you'd want to buy lower just like me (if I even buy this one eventually). If you have
longed, you want it to have an up trend. But if you look at the people on this, most will be buyers.


From a probability point of view, the odds seem slightly in favor of longing a stock after the shorts have
beaten it down enough and the rate of price decrease has slowed due to resistance by the longs.


 
Like I said, I don't have a position in ONP.


Regardless which side you are on, good luck to you and happy investing.

Well I think we know what your answer would be to that. But then again, your opinion is pretty worthless since CMFO
is now trading above where it was was before the short attacks began. Lets do some math. Roughly 45 days after the

there, you really nailed it.

I have no position in CFMO and never have had one. I am short ONP. 
Stock prices mean nothing to me, particularly in the short term. In fact, last year I invested in NEP, sold out, and made
a 130%. Did I do a good job? I did at the time. I thought I was a genius, but now I think the company's financials were
fraudulent and I was a lucky fool. So I think I did a terrible job, even though I got very lucky and the result was very
good. 
In other words, you argument based on the stock price is ridiculous to me. If one continues to make good picks, they
may still do poorly on some picks, but they are likely to do well overall. Likewise, if someone makes poor picks, they
may still get lucky and do very well on some picks, but they are likely to do poorly overall. My goal is to make good
picks but, of course, every investors occassionally will make a poor pick.

I know nothing about CMFO. All I am saying is that the short attacks, and seekingalpha articles written about
CMFO caused the stock price to go down, but then it recovered and has surpassed where it was before they
began. All I am speaking to is the short term effect seekingalpha's articles have on stocks. If CMFO is
comitting fraud, it's not getting caught right now due to the shorters' efforts. It has shaken off those reports
and continued on the path it was before the negative reports came out.


Personally I think seekingalpha's policies on letting people post opinion pieces that show up as news on
yahoo finance is a travesty. This is not to say I haven't done it and won't continue to utilize it but if you're
going to write something that shows up in a news feed for all investors to read, you should really not be

over time so we can make better decisions about investing.

I believe that someone such as yourself 'Jamz Unlimited' should not be posting anonymously. Every last one
of your comments and your article that appeared on Yahoo does nothing but defend ONP.


A coincidence that you are long the stock?


I for one would appreciate at least the acknowledgement that there are several real red flags here (ONP
editing the R&D claims on its website since the MW report, Dongfang related party transactions,
discrepencies regarding leases from one 10k to the next, etc.).


Do you question nothing with regards to ONP?


For someone flaunting passing the CFA Level 2 test in their bio, I would expect a more objective analysis.


If ONP is guilty of fraud, it won't go unnoticed by the CFA Institute that one of their candidates was publishing
favorable articles on Yahoo Finance while being long the stock. Or better said, publishing favorable articles on
Yahoo Finance while being long the stock AND all the while selectively ignoring any positions that might
cause losses in their personal portfolio.

I have to agree with Arrow Hendrick that you, as well as the mass number of people pumping this stock, seem not to
address the evidence at all. They seem to just make conclusory statements without evidentiary support and, at the
same time, ignore all the evidence that shows a track record of prevarication by ONP and demonstrates that their
claims regarding revenue are questionable. 
As far as your points, you have assumed that the articles by people shorting the stock are causing the price to go
down. This is a the logical fallacy known as "post hoc ergo propter hoc" or "after this, therefore because of this. See

down or up on a short term basis is speculation. I do believe that, in the long term, we can show that a stock price will
roughly follow its return on equity, although the fluctuations away from that may still be extreme. 
Just to be clear, I am not saying that perhaps some of the evidence, particularly the verifiable kind, has not influenced
the stock price. However, that information may have been previously discovered in the due diligence by those
transacting in the stock or have been circulated through other people or sources. Certainly, there are a lot more
people looking and analyzing ONP than those posting on Seekingalpha. Of course, seekingapha articles may be
influencing stock prices, but without actual evidence, it is speculation to conclude it definitely is.  
I don't believe that your reasons against anonymity in posting are persuasive. One reason for anonymity is to allow a
writer to share their view while being shielded rrom unwarranted personal attacks. This is necessary bacause, as you
have observed in this case, is that when someone short a stock post information that reflects poorly on a company,
even if it is from the company themselves, they can be subject to death threats, threats of bodily injury, vitriolic insults,
posting of personal and family addresses, phone numbers and encouragement of violence against them, and so on.
All of these things, and much more, have occured to Carson Block and Sean Regan of Muddy Waters. Some of the
abuse a short seller who goes public may be subject to is detailed in David Einhorn's book "You Can Fool Some of
the People All of the Time". 
As far as accountability, how would you plan to hold an article writer accountable if you knew their identify? Has
anyone held any of the posters who are not anonymous accountable for anything they wrote on seekingalpha? 
As far as tracking someon's record over time, you can do that with the anonymous authors - their articles, instablogs
and comments are on their page just as it is on the indentified authors. 
As far as making better decision about investing, I caution against merely relying on the identity of the author to do
that. First of all, many fraudulent scams have relied on that tactic - need i remind you of the largest fraud in history just
pulled by Bernie Madoff, who was tauted as being as reputable as they come in order to garner many billions of
investor money. No, to be a good investor, I recommend not relying on the opinion of others as that has been the path
to the loss of a great deal of money by a great number of people. Instead, you must look at the evidence and you
must do you own due diligence and apply sound reasoning. That approach, combined with practice and the
necessary ability, is the way to becoming a good investor, not relying on someone because of their name or
reputation. 
Good luck to you!

You are probably right about it. I look at difference between stock price and whatever 'fair value' the business
should have. Price matters to investment/trading entry/exit points. So if another approach disregards or
discount the importance of stock price, there is a fundamental difference there.

I'm not even sure where to start.


Arrow said I should also be not anonymous. Well, first of all, I'm not the one making hugely controversial and no less
than sensational claims. You all claim ONP, including its ceo, cfo, auditors and board are conspiring to commit fraud. I
am merely saying this is NOT TRUE according to the evidence I see.


And Arrow, I would challenge you to find anything I have ever written that recommends that anyone buy ONP right
now. In fact there are multiple times where I say through posts that due to my code of conducts I follow, I cannot
recommend buying or selling anything, and very often I say that ONP is an extremely risky move to invest in right now
given the allegations and suited only for people with high risky appetites. Here is something I wrote on the boards
several days ago, and here is the link.


"Thanks for the support. I do have to say though this is not my recommendation to go out and bet your house on this
stock. Given that it's micro cap, has country risk, and now has allegations about it, I would give it no more than an
equal weighting. If Deloitte clears it you can bump it up a little in your portfolio, but basically-- don't go nuts."


messages.finance.yahoo...


And Seasaw, I disagree that your alias name on SeekingAlpha holds you accountable. It is way too easy to just get a
new alias name and no one would every know. You can't do that with your given name. Legitimate research analysts
post their real names and credentials when they write their reports. If their reports go bust, they deal with the
consequences of angry investors like men. You hide behind a fake alias name. You are publishing serious allegations
and making extremely strong opinions about serious matters such as a stock's valuation so why should you be held to
less accountability than a sell side analyst. Wait, I know why, because you're a blogger. And that is fine, so long as
you stick to blogging, but my problem is that that SA lets bloggers publish their blogs as NEWS, similar to a sell side
analyst. So, if they're going to let you publish an article that shows up in a news feed, I think they should make you
publish your real name so you have to deal with the consequences of your research just like everyone else who gets
that kind of publicity.


These, of course are just my opinions. Eli Hoffman would disagree with me, as does SA in general.

Yes, you add that disclaimer in one post.


Too bad in your other 200 plus yahoo posts on ONP you've started a campaign to have those with contrary
views banned from SA, state outright "This stock is going up.", assured investors lawsuits probably won't
happen, dismiss positions that question ONP as "crap" and "insane" without a thorough reading of the source
documents, and much more. This is often done in CAPITAL LETTERS WITH EXCLAMATION MARKS TO
MAKE SURE WE GET THE POINT THAT ONP IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD!!!!


Perhaps my favorite line is this: "I don't have time to do the research even though I know it's wrong. It's like
arguing with Adolf Hitler to me." How would you know CCA's facts are wrong without doing the research? Oh
yeah, you're long ONP.


Forget betting your house. Putting any money in this stock deserves a second thought (and probably a third
and fourth) after reviewing the red flags raised by various authors on this site. Authors, I might add, who have
clearly read through the SEC filings in much greater detail than yourself.


You've stated you are long ONP and you're not fooling anyone with your one-sided views. I'll repeat: not the
type of conduct I'm guessing the folks in Charlottesville expect from candidates. But I’ll leave that up to them.


If ONP ends up being a fraud, which is looking ever more likely in my humble opinion, God knows you’ve left
a paper trail long enough to hang yourself.

I never said your alias name holds you accountable. This seems to be the consistent tactic of people like you
responding to me, to completely mistate what I said. At the same time, you ignore my real comments and fail to
respond to them. If you want to respond to my comment, why don't you read it and respond to it and not make up
something I didn't say. 
Correct me if I am wrong, but the only point I can clean from your post is that I should have to face the consequences
of angry investors if the stock does ultimately go down after I post the problems about ONP. 
My question to you is 'What consequences of angry investors are you referring to?" I know that Muddy Waters is
facing death threats, threats of bodily harm, posting of addresses and phone numbers of themselves and family
members and exhortations that people committ violence against them, and so on. Is that the type of consequences
you are referring to that you think should occur? If not, what exactly are you talking about.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/219704-orient-papers-top-supplier-an-empty-shell-owned-by-onps-ceo 46/57


anonymously in general, I can tell you two things. One, althoug I call my instablogs articles because that is what they
are, they have not been made articles on seekingalpha and they have not shown up in news feeds as far as I know.
Of course, that may change, so it is not a very important point but I wanted to correct any misimpression your
comment may have caused. 
Second, please read my instablogs carefully. What I did was rely solely on Orient Paper's SEC filings, it's press
releases, it's website(s), and it's statements by management, as well as videos of their facilities presented by
promoters of their stock. Those representations by Orient Paper are contradictory and I simply pointed it out. I asked
questions regarding these which nobody, not even Orient Paper, has addressed or responded to. I will characterize
my instablogs as merely presenting facts and evidence, not as making serious allegations. 
I suggest that if you have any issues or problems with my instablog, what you are really saying is that you have a
problem with Orient Paper, because it is their representations that I detail. 
You again make a false statement when you say, "You state that the ceo, cfo, auditors and board are conspiring to
commit fraud". I have not seen that statement in anything I read. Again, the problems with Orient Paper have been
detailed extensively. The detractors of Orient Paper have mainly dealt with issues, detailing problems with the
company and have not usually identified specifically who is to blame. Muddy Waters is the only one I remember
specifically laying blame on a certain party - in their case it was the CEO. Perhaps the CFO is culpable or perhaps he
is merely repeating what he has been told. In any event, he actually admitted a number of problems. The auditors
may have been fooled or just done a poor job - their pay was certainly much less than one would expect for an audit
of that type by very good accountants. The current board has 5 members and it has not been established which, if
any, is culpable. The Board has actually called for an investigation, it is not clear the extent they may be culpable,
may have been negligent, or may have been fooled. 
You state that you think it is not true that Orient Paper is committing fraud. To me, that certainly is a hugely
controversial and sensational claim, just like I would think anyone claiming that enron was not fraudulent was making
a hugely controversial and sensational claim. 
Why do I say that? Because I have detailed a number of specific misrepresentations by Orient Paper (you repeatedly
ignore them, by the way). To me, it is fraud to claim that you have comprehensive R&D facilities, when you admittedly
don't. To me, It is fraud to claim that you have a 37 member R&D team when you don't. To me, it is fraud to make a
representation that you are building a 2 million metre facility when you are not and do not have the resources to do
so, and it is further fraud to then claim that you anticipate that, by 2010, that facilitate will produce 1.2 million tons of
paper, will generate 700 million to 1.2 billion in revenue and 160-230 million dollars in net profit, when you know you
are not, cannot and will not be building that facility. Is that enough for you or need I go on? You can read my
instablogs for more. 
Are you unable to understand your own writings? Of course, you recommended the stock. Your own quote of yourself
states - "I would give it (referring to ONP) no more than an equal weighting". And, to make clear that what you meant
is that you should own it in your portfolio to obtain this equal weighting, you go on to see "if Deloitte clears it you can
bump it up a little in your portfolio." 
So, you recommended to own it in your portfolio by giving it an equal weighting, bump it up to more than an equal
weighting if Deloitte clears it, but not to bet the house on the stock or go nuts on it. 
Nobody, Loeb & Loeb or Deloitte can clear Orient Paper of the problems with it that I detail because those problems
are based on Orient Paper's own inconsistent representations and the videos of its own facilities.


Your only point appears to be that I should have to face angry people if, after my posts about the problems with Orient

Congrats, you have found a small chinese company that does not update its webpage in time and that
overstates its R&D team (Maybe someone buys a small paper company in a chinese village for their research
team but it is difficult to believe for me). Keep looking that you will found more. 
I do not know where have you read that they said that their were going to build a facility to produce 1.2 million
tons of paper by 2010; I thought that the new product line would produce 360k tons of paper by 2011. Please
say sources.


But all of that has nothing to do with overstating their revenue and net income 50x. For me there is a lot of
difference between both things.

I do not have time to respond to everything you and Arrow just wrote. I barely have time to read it. I will say
though that there are no rules with my institution that say I can't make a recommendation. In fact if that were
true no sell side analysts would have the charter because they wouldn't be able to do their job. At several
points in the last few weeks, I do state its risks and what I believe to be its opportunities. I showed you an
example of when I clearly state its risks, including the allegations put forth of fraud. The part about me trying
to stay away from outright saying BUY THIS STOCK is just my personal ethical efforts.


Beyond that I think we're arguing in circles, vis a vis, my opinions on ONP and your opinions. I will let you get
the last word on your last enormous point. I cannot respond to it all.

Actually I will respond to one of Arrow's comments because it attacks my ethical values which I take very seriously.
He makes reference to the fact that I admitted I did not read all of the blogger's blogs If you read the earlier parts of
the post you cherry picked you'll see it is in reference to writing a response article to you guys but I do not have time
to do read all your allegations and respond to them. The rules I follow say nothing to the fact that I must read other
analyst reports before making my own opinions. In fact there are more strict rules to the effect that I shouldn't let other
analyst reports bias my opinion. The rules are regarding objectivity and independent thinking. If I read your reports
and allegations and just went along with them, THAT would be a violation. I realize it is important to investigate the
allegations against it, and I have done this and made my opinion. Your assertion that because I don't agree with your
point of view, that I am being unethical, in my opinion, is bad logic.


Lastly, if there was such a rule that said I had to read every single analyst report about a stock I am making an opinion
on (and there isn't), these blogs would not qualify. They are not reports. I do not need to read all your allegations and
take them into account when making my opinion.


I'm sure we can both agree these arguments are getting petty and off point. Lets let this discussion end. I'm sure you'll
have more to say in response to this post, but I am fine with that, and will let you have the last word.


12 Aug 2010, 09:18 AM

The problem is not that you don't read "all of the blogger's blogs".


The problem is you don't look into the company's own SEC filings yourself. When presented with
contradictions sourced from the SEC or the company itself, you won't even acknowledge that these are
serious red flags.


Instead of taking 5 minutes to check the sources on sec.gov, you base many of your arguments on the
motives of the messengers.


This is horrible analysis. One that will no doubt be looked into given your reference about passing the CFA
Level 2 test in your bio. Your articles have been picked up by Yahoo, you are long the stock, and every last
comment you post defends ONP. That is troubling. Again the problem is not that you don't read every last
word of criticism, it's that you look to be deliberately ignoring bad news about ONP due to your long position.


A perfect example of this is one of your last posts on Yahoo:


"Jamz is waiting for Deloitte's results before writing any more articles or making any more trade/investing
decisions. I have voiced this many times. Jamz prefers to trust the word of people and firms with both
accountability and reputation, such as Deloitte, not anonymous bloggers with nothing to lose if their analysis
is wrong."


You shouldn’t be waiting for Deloitte. You should be looking SEC filings yourself given how much you have
promoted this stock. It will take 5 minutes to ascertain the validity of the accusations. If ONP needs to restate
their SEC filings, it would look pretty bad that a CFA candidate was hyping the stock for weeks, all the while
not checking the SEC filings that are right in front of his nose.

Arrow,


I promised myself I wouldn't respond but you make it very hard to not respond to your post. I'll keep it short,
and then hopefully stick to my guns and stop humoring you. As I have said many times, I have looked into the
evidence myself and made my decision based on my own analysis. What I HAVEN'T done is read all the
blogs that many short sellers come out with. I don't find it useful. The fact you keep linking me to SEC
documents is funny. I have seen them all and believe it or not, I have come up with a different opinion than
you keep trying to point me to!


There is no violation to my ethical standards that I can even fathom. I am fully allowed to express opinions to
buy or sell, though I typically don't like to, and I try to say as often as I can that ONP is very risky, don't
overweight the stock, etc, etc.


As far as your very nice quote from me, I don't get your point. I did my analysis and I am waiting for Deloitte to
confirm it since I trust what they say.


Done and done. I promise not to respond again. :)

"I try to say as often as I can that ONP is very risky"


Should I take 'often' to mean one or two times in 250 yahoo and SA posts? And 'very risky' to mean "no more
than equal weighting" and not to "bet the house"?


And what happened to your profile picture? Deciding that possibly it wasn't the best career decision to link
yourself personally to a stock with so many red flags in their SEC filings?


Luckily, if this blows up in scandal, we have a cached version to see a picture of the CFA candidate that did
nothing but defend ONP despite obvious red flags he deliberately ingnored.

If you want to get back to the issue of actually analyzing the company be my guest. I’m still waiting for you to
explain how it is not a red flag that the company had negative SG&A spending in Q4 2008. I won't be
surprised if once again you fail to even acknowledge this as a concern.


But the issue I’m addressing is completely clear:


-Your glut of entries defending ONP are egregious for someone affiliated with the CFA Institute.


-Your hundreds of posts on the Yahoo message boards and Seeking Alpha do not offer an objective analysis.
They fail to address even the most obvious red flags, such as contradictions within the company’s own SEC
filings, and hence could be misleading investors in this stock who take comfort in your credentials.


- I question whether you are are placing the integrity of the profession "above your own interests" (your long
position in ONP appears to be influencing your analysis, evident by the facts you are deliberately choosing to
ignore)


-I question whether you are acting with "integrity, competence, and respect" (examples: "Waldo, you're a
moron." --- "People-- Weekend evening hours, I can't be held accountable for what I say. I drink heavily during
these times.")


-I question whether you are improving and maintaining your "professional competence" (see previous posts
and above)


www.cfainstitute.org/e...


Right now you have to answer to no one but anonymous bloggers. But if ONP is guilty of violations, they'll be
much more eyes on this story. Since you've firmly established yourself as one of the strongest supporters of
the company, you will likely have some explaining to do.

Response, point by point


1) I am under no obligation by anyone including CFA to reference another author's report when making my
conclusions (in fact like I said, that in itself could be a violation). This is where I think you are confused about
the CFA's rules. You claim that there are obvious red flags. This is not a fact. This is your and a few other
author's opinion. If the flags were so obvious, how did harbinger, roth and hudson research analysts miss
them when they did a full analysis. So again, if there are things to look into they sure as heck aren't obvious
like you're making them out to be. In this case, I did look into the things that the audit committee said they
would be looking into, and am fully satisfied with what I found. Again, I do not need to respond to the other
allegations presented by bloggers when making my analysis.


2) I am fully allowed to make a strong opinion one way or another on a stock, and again I do not need to
reference another person's opinions about it. I can also recommend how to weight the stock and trade the
stock.


3) There are rules about drinking at work. I do not work on the weekends or late evenings, so the fact that I
said I am not responsible for what I say during these times is irrelevant as I did not publish research during
these times. In fact I don't think any of my comments on the boards would be considered published research.
It is an anonymous message board.


4) Improving professional competence has to do with keeping up on new laws and attaining more education.
This concept not not apply here. I realize you pulled a few things off the website but this one doesn't make
any sense at all.

"This is where I think you are confused about the CFA's rules. You claim that there are obvious red flags. This

The red flags are obvious. That is a fact.


To repeat just one of many, when Chimin Sang (Ph.D and Booth School MBA if you care about credentials)
published an article highlighting, among other things, the fact the company had negative SG&A spending in
the 4th quarter of 2008 yet another red flag was raised. He links to all the SEC filings as proof.


It takes 5 minutes to check his facts. You choose not to and prefer to stand by your hundreds of posts that
analyze the stock with rose tinted glasses. Posts that in no way show objectivity nor "integrity, competence,
and respect".


You've established yourself as one of the strongest defenders of this company, facts be damned.


Good luck with that.

Jamz: 
Did you not read my post? You did recommend that people buy the stock, so don't say that you did not. A far as
arguing in circles, you never respond to my points at all.


Zappaton: 
No - I found a small chinese company that makes false statements on its website and continues to do so on its
current website. 
Yes - this "small" company claims to have be producing approximately "600 tons" of paper a day for revene of "102
million dollars" last year, claim to be growing at rates way beyond others in the industry, and claims margins way
higher than others in the industry. 
How could they be doing this? According to their website, it was due to advanced, cutting edge R&D which gave them
important intellectual property rights and allowed them to operate more efficiently and at higher margins than
competitors. In other words, the R&D is what allowed them to beat competitors and get the huge revenue and
revenue growth they claimed. Was it the truth? No, they have no R&D facilities, no intellectual property, no R&D team
except several guys trying to learn how to run the new digital photo paper production line that, even when fully
operating, can only produce 2500 tons a year. 
I am trying to imply anything, I am stating directly that the press release was a clear and obvious attempt to pump the
stock with knowingly false information. Orient Paper was not, would not, and could not ever be building a 2 metre
facility in 2008 that, by 2010, would produce 1.2 million tons, provide revenue of 700 million to 1.3 billion, or provide
160 million to 230 million in net revenue. They simply were no where close to having the financial resources to even
consider building a facility anywhere near that size.

The problem is that you are criticizing articles and blogs by other people without having read them. That is the

I wish you could vote people off of this site, because I'm pretty sure there would be a lot for this so called Chinese
Company Analyst character. Its people like him/her that are going to make int'l companies not want to list on
American exchanges, and instead only on their exchanges at home. Why bother here, with the US exchanges, when
you have to devote so much PR and time to drown out the voices of a few greedy short sellers with no conscious.
Shorting on self-made rumors is the same as stealing, no excuses, its pathetic.

Someone questioned why a micro cap Chinese company with $70MM in revenue doesn't want to use a top tier
accounting firm as auditor? Reality is most micro cap companies don't because it's too expensive. A third tier firm
costs $150K-$250K while a top tier firm costs 3-4 times as much easily.


If a company has only $70MM in revenue, the profit is probably less than $20MM. Even with $20MM, a $500K
difference will mean 2.5% less profit to the shareholders, unless they are accused of fraud and they have to pay a tidy
sum of shareholder money on top tier accounting firm and lawyers to defend themselves. If a company makes only
$10MM in profit, the extra accounting fee will cost 5% of profit to the shareholders.


So to use a third tier accounting firm could be reason for further investigation, or it could just be the CEO being a
majority shareholder doing something perfectly sensible - to save money.


Who do you trust more when everyone is accusing each other of lying:


1) A listed company governed by SEC rules and audited, and shareholders know they will lose big if they lie and get
caught.


2) A mere web login anyone can create multiple times for free that's used by someone hiding away somewhere, firing
off mixture of facts, opinions and speculations like a gunslinger in the lawless Wild Wild West to try to convince
shareholders what they have is a piece of junk so that he can buy it cheap.


Obviously one would be a fool to make an investment decision based on this forum. It's 100 times worse than a stock
tip dished out in a party. The guy in the party is just trying to prove that he has something hot, but here you could get
robbed.


Do you own research. If you can't figure out who is a bigger lier, then just walk away. There are thousands of other
stocks you can trade on. If you are unfortunate to have held the stock when it was under attack by the shorts, then
start a Yahoo Group or Google Group and pool money to pay someone to physically check it out in China. It won't
cost much to do that and it can be done for a few thousand dollars. Then you can at your pleasure either join the
thought provoking shorts or squeeze the shorts for a laugh to the bank.

1. When a company spends three times as much on PR firms and road shows than they do on auditing it is
transparently clear where the priorities lie. 
2. There is no financial crimes treaty between the US and China. A Chinese citizen could sell Ponzi type
investments to US investors with total impunity. The SEC couldn't get a subpoena served in China if they had

to. 
3. Don't believe anyone. Check it for yourself. Don't beleive me, don't believe CCA, don't believe Seasaw, but
most importantly don't believe the people taking your money. Confirm everything through third party
independent sources. The PR firm is not a source. Nor is the company. 
4. Short selling against a stock is a fundamental negative no different than analysts downgrades or loss of
institutional support. It is clear shorts (including myself) are working against this stock. Ignoring everthing
else; why stick around when there is the very clear intention to kick your long ass.

Mr. Carnes,


It's clear you've made some money here and that this won't be the last elaborate scam you cook up with the
other clowns. The party won't last forever though Jon.


Take care.

John,


The issue here is that those with hidden identity making sensational claims lacks credibility as much as those Chinese
companies accused of ponzi scheme. Both seem to have total impunity for the time being.


Obviously if one can figure out who is a bigger lier here, there would be a very good trade for the investor.


Cheers,

Orient Paper is the only one making sensational claims and is the only liar I have found here. 
Orient Paper is making the sensational claim that they have tripled revenue and quadrupled net profit while
contracting by substantially reducing the land they own and/or rent (losing 133,200 acres and left with only 42.95
acres), reducing the number of manufacturing facilities, reducing the number of production lines, reducing the number
of different types of paper they are making, and reducing the number of employees (by more than 30%). 
Here is another sensational claim by Orient Paper - in 2008, they claimed they were building a 2 million square metre
facility that they estimated, by 2010, would have a 1.2 million production capacity, bringing in approximately 700
million to 1.2 billion dollars in revenue and making approximately 160 million to 230 million dollars. A compete
fabrication - Orient Paper was not building that facility, and could not as they did not have the resources to do so. 
People like me are merely pointing out these sensational claims by Orient Paper.

I have seen that piece of information in Chinese also. After witnessing the bursting of subprime bubble in the U.S that
has derailed countless ambitious business plans by legitimate businesses, I wasn't too surprised by it. Not to say
ONP was being truthful, but I am also not sure if they were lying about it back in 2008.


On ONP specifically, I have my own questions about the company. The shorts raised some really good questions but
it's hard to say it isn't controversial the way they are presented. At the same time, the longs have raised a lot of good
questions also.


Not ready to trade on this yet. This is a good story.


Thanks

You must be kidding. The press release by Orient Paper saying they were going to build a 2 million metre facility in
2008 was nothing but a shameless attempt to pump the stock with false infomration. 
If you read the press release and read Orient Paper's SEC filings on their financial status, you must be aware that
there was NO chance that Orient Paper could or would build the facility that they were claiming. They simply did not
have anywhere near the financial resources to build such a facility. Furthermore, this facility is not addressed in any
SEC filing by Orient Paper. There was no subsequent press release or SEC filings stating that they would not be
building the facility. 
There is absolutely nothing controversial about the issues I raised. I laid out the problems with Orient Paper based on
their own representations in their SEC filings, press releases, website(s), statements by management, and videos of
their facilities. One can call it anything they want or argue with me, but I based what I wrote on Orient Paper's
representations and they show fraud in and of themselves.

Greetings,


I have to disclose that I started taking my position in ONP between 2:30-3:00PM last Friday after all my previous
posts on ONP. So I'd just excuse myself from this forum from now on.


Thanks again for sharing the information for both sides of the arguments in this passionate debate.


Happy investing.

Seasaw,


When the stock was at elevated levels, was there torrential insider selling? That is the telltale sign of fraud...there is
no other reason to goose the stock price under false pretenses. Enron executives artificially inflated the stock price
and then SOLD AT HIGH PRICES. Any evidence or similar behavior at ONP?


Absent that factor, your argument is that ONP execs know the company is fraudulent yet continue to hold their shares
on the way to zero.


Improbable.


Pump and dump doesn't work without the "dump" component.


So where did the dumping occur? Did Muddy Waters document insider dumping?


Or did Muddy Waters just short and distort?

Esther: 
These china company frauds do not appear to involved or report management selling their shares. Look at NEP.
Management did not sell their shares. However, they are suspended from trading, the CEO was fired, and money was
going from the company bank account directly to the CEO.  
One of the benefits for management, or whoever is in control, is the capital raises, the PIPES. That cash is going to
the company and then to the CEO in NEP. Muddy Waters claims that is what happening at ONP. In that case,
management wants to keep doing capital raises, and selling their shares may make that difficult. Indeed, ONP had
already registered for another, larger capital raise. 
Who is dumping? There appears to be a whole bunch of people that get Orient Paper shares for cheap. People
involved in doing the reverse merger for ONP. Investment banks and investor relations. There were consultants in
ONP that got 5 million shares for 40 cents a share. These types of people look to dump their shares. 
Who else? The investors - hedge funds, investment firms - who participate in the PIPES. They get their shares for
below market price. They may short to lock in the profit. After or during the pumping, these groups dump their shares.
Look at Barron Capital in the first year or so Orient Paper traded publicly. Look at the investors in the last capital raise
- what happened with their ownership of the shares. 
In other words, capital raise investors give their money for shares, but get a reduced price on the shares. The stock is
pumped. The investors get out at a profit. The general public buying the stock is the one who ultimately pays. 
Management gets the money from the capital raise, ultimately paid for by the public on whom the PIPE investor's
stock is dumped. NEP CEO then took that money, or at least some of it. ONP's management is accused by MW of
embezzling the money, or at least some of it. 
Does that explain how this could happen?


16 Aug 2010, 10:02 AM

If the embezzling can be proven, yes.

Don't like that at all.


Also, the chart has formed a large flat bottom triangle, which is a negative continuation pattern.

If Chinese Company Analyst is John Bird, his credibility is reinforced by a recent Business Week article (Jan 17, 2011)
which is a 6 page slam at fraudulent Chinese companies, many of them uncovered by John Bird (aka Waldo
Mushman). Most of these Chinese companies listed in the US do so through reverse mergers with a failed US
company. This makes them look legit, but the process avoids a close "US rules/regulations look" at the Chinese
owners. In the article Bird is quoted as saying " '...the carnage is just beginning...' "


Skeptics of Chinese Company Analyst's original post here might want to back off and take a look at the BW article. It
is compelling.


16 Jan 2011, 12:22 PM


jack789
BTW - Chinese Company Analyst is identified as KERRISDALE CAPITAL'S Adrangi in the Business Week article, and
Muddy Waters is a Hong Kong company unrelated to John Bird originally started by a Carson Block, lawyer - but it
has also leveled charges of fraud at Orient Paper
