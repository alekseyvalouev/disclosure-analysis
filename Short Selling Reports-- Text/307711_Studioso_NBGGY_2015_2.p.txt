Massive	Dilution	And	Massive	Overvaluation	At	National	Bank	Of
Greece	-	Shares	To	Fall	Below	$0.05

by:	Studioso	Research


Summary


NBG	announced	that	it	will	be	issuing	73.3	billion	new	shares	at	a	price	of	0.02	EUR.


NBG	currently	has	only	3.533	billion	shares	outstanding,	so	the	capital	raise
represents	significant	dilution	for	existing	shareholders,	with	current	shares
representing	less	than	5%	of	the	company.


NBG	shares	should	fall	at	least	82%	from	Monday’s	close	of	$0.25	a	share,	to
$0.0427	or	below.


Our	price	target	of	$0.0427	is	calculated	as	2	times	the	capital	raising	price,	and
even	this	is	incredibly	generous.


On	Thursday	November	19,	National	Bank	of	Greece	(NBG)	announced	that	it	plans	to
sell	1.166	billion	EUR	of	shares	at	a	price	of	0.02	EUR	per	share.

7/19/2019 Massive Dilution And Massive Overvaluation At National Bank Of Greece - Shares To Fall Below $0.05 - NATL BK GREECE SP/ADR NEW (OTCM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3709816-massive-dilution-massive-overvaluation-national-bank-greece-shares-fall-0_05 2/5


Of	the	1.166	billion	EUR,	475	million	EUR	is	a	'fresh'	capital	raising	and	691	million	EUR	is
part	of	the	'liability	management	exercise'	(LME).


In	the	same	press	release,	NBG	also	confirmed	that	it	plans	to	sell	another	300	million
EUR	of	shares	at	0.02	EUR	per	share.


For	these	two	share	sales,	the	number	of	new	shares	issued	will	be:


58.3	billion	shares	for	the	new	share	offering	(58.3	billion	shares	*	0.02	EUR	=	1.166
billion	EUR)
15	billion	shares	for	the	Greek	Public	Offer	(15	billion	shares	*	0.02	EUR	=	300	million
EUR)


NBG	currently	has	only	3.533	billion	shares	outstanding,	so	the	new	shares	issued	will
represent	over	95.4%	of	the	company's	share	capital,	being	73.3	billion	shares	out	of	a
new	share	count	of	76.833	billion	shares.


Furthermore,	as	noted	in	this	article,	given	that	NBG	is	asking	for	state	aid	to	meet	its
capital	raising	requirements,	the	company	will	be	required	to	convert	additional	bonds	and
preference	shares	into	ordinary	shares.	The	author	of	that	article	stated	that	the	face	value
of	those	securities	subject	to	bail-in	is	308	million	EUR,	being	111	million	for	remaining
bonds	from	the	LME	and	197	million	EUR	of	US	preference	shares.


Finally,	NBG	will	issue	additional	shares	as	part	of	the	Greek	government's	provision	of
state	aid.


This	will	amount	to	another	2.03	billion	EUR	in	contingent	convertible	securities	(CoCos)
and	677	million	EUR	in	ordinary	shares.	However	NBG	confirmed	in	the	November	19
press	release	that	it	plans	to	repay	the	CoCos,	once	it	receives	proceeds	from	the	sale	of
Finansbank.


Significant	dilution


The	amount	of	dilution	faced	by	NBG	shareholders	as	a	result	of	the	above	actions	is
staggering	-	as	we	noted	earlier,	the	new	shares	from	only	the	two	share	sales	will
represent	over	95%	of	the	company's	share	capital.	This	does	not	include	the	dilution	that
shareholders	face	as	a	result	of	the	bail-in	of	the	111	million	EUR	face	value	of	bonds,	197
million	EUR	preference	shares	or	the	state	aid	of	677	million	EUR	worth	of	ordinary
shares.

7/19/2019 Massive Dilution And Massive Overvaluation At National Bank Of Greece - Shares To Fall Below $0.05 - NATL BK GREECE SP/ADR NEW (OTCM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3709816-massive-dilution-massive-overvaluation-national-bank-greece-shares-fall-0_05 3/5


For	a	guide	as	to	how	the	dilution	should	effect	NBG's	share	price,	we	can	look	to	the
recently	capital	raisings	by	rival	banks	Alpha	Bank	(OTCPK:ALBKY)	and	Eurobank
(OTCPK:EGFEY).


On	November	18,	Eurobank	announced	the	sale	of	over	2	billion	shares	at	0.01	EUR.	At
the	time	of	writing,	its	shares	are	trading	at	0.016	EUR.


On	November	19,	Alpha	Bank	announced	the	sale	of	1.553	billion	EUR	worth	of	shares	at
0.04	EUR	per	share.	At	the	time	of	writing,	its	shares	are	trading	at	0.055	EUR.


Alpha	Bank	and	Eurobank	are	possibly	the	two	strongest	Greek	banks,	given	that	(unlike
NBG	and	Piraeus)	they	did	not	need	state	aid.	Both	Alpha	and	Eurobank	trade	at	multiples
of	less	than	2	times	the	offering	price	of	their	shares.


Therefore	our	price	target	for	NBG	shares	is	no	higher	than	2	times	the	capital	raising
price,	or	2	*	0.02	EUR	=	0.04	EUR	per	share.


For	ADR	investors,	this	is	a	price	target	of	no	higher	than	2	*	0.02	*	1.0675	=	$0.0427
per	share.


NBG	options


Trading	in	NBG	options	has	been	extremely	active	in	recent	days	as	a	result	of	the
company's	various	announcements	about	its	efforts	to	raise	capital.	One	can	look	at	the
price	of	the	company's	$0.50	puts	to	see	where	the	market	believes	NBG	is	headed.


Late	on	Monday,	NBG	December	18	$0.50	puts	were	bid	at	$0.38,	which	means	that	the
stock	needs	to	fall	to	$0.12	by	expiration	just	for	that	buyer	to	break	even.	It	is	likely	that
the	bidder(s)	at	$0.38	are	confident	that	the	stock	is	going	lower	than	$0.12	by	December
18.


Manic	Monday	trading


On	Monday,	NBG	shares	traded	more	like	a	biotech	stock	than	a	boring	bank.	It	seems
that	most	investors	forgot	that	the	New	York	listed	ADRs	do	not	represent	a	Greek	biotech
company,	but	just	1	share	of	National	Bank	of	Greece.


Warren	Buffett's	idea	that	"In	the	short	term	the	market	is	a	popularity	contest;	in	the	long
term	it	is	a	weighing	machine"	is	extremely	relevant	for	NBG.	After	NBG	closed	in	Athens
at	0.157	EUR	per	share	(equal	to	about	$0.1675),	NBG	shares	traded	as	high	as	$0.3350,
or	twice	the	USD	equivalent	of	the	Athens-listed	shares!

7/19/2019 Massive Dilution And Massive Overvaluation At National Bank Of Greece - Shares To Fall Below $0.05 - NATL BK GREECE SP/ADR NEW (OTCM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3709816-massive-dilution-massive-overvaluation-national-bank-greece-shares-fall-0_05 4/5


Given	the	wide	range	in	which	the	shares	traded	-	from	$0.1701	to	$0.3350,	the	logical
conclusion	is	that	Monday's	trading	had	little	to	do	with	fundamentals,	and	more	to	do	with
traders	playing	the	game	of	the	greater-fool	theory.


Despite	NBG	shares	closing	well	below	their	intraday	high	of	$0.3350,	it	still	seems	that
investors	have	not	yet	realized	the	extent	to	which	their	stakes	have	been	diluted	by	the
announced	(two	share	sales)	and	future	(LME	bail-in,	preference	share	bail-in,	sale	of
shares	to	Greek	government)	capital	raising	initiatives.	At	the	close	of	trading	on	Monday,
NBG's	Athens-listed	shares	closed	at	0.157	EUR,	and	in	New	York	saw	NBG	shares	close
at	$0.25.


Reverse	split


In	its	announcement	of	November	19,	NBG	alluded	to	its	plan	to	complete	a	15-for-1
reverse	split:


"The	Board	of	Directors	of	NBG	set	the	offer	price	at	€0.02	per	offered	New	Share
(the	"Offer	Price")	or	€0.30	following	the	15-to-1	reverse	share	split"


We	have	already	fielded	one	question	on	Twitter	about	what	effect	the	reverse	split	has	on
our	price	target	for	NBG	shares.	The	simple	answer	is	that	it	has	very	little	effect.


As	mentioned	above,	our	price	target	for	the	Athens-listed	shares	is	0.04	EUR	or	lower,
and	our	price	target	for	the	New	York	ADRs	is	the	USD-equivalent,	which	is	$0.0427	using
an	exchange	rate	of	EUR/USD	1.0675.


Multiplying	both	of	these	figures	by	15,	gives	a	post-split	price	target	of	0.60	EUR	or
lower	for	the	Athens-listed	shares,	and	$0.6405	or	lower	for	the	New	York	ADRs.


Given	that	both	the	Athens-listed	shares	and	the	New	York	shares	have	not	yet	split,	the
post-split	price	targets	currently	have	no	practical	relevance.


Catalyst	for	decline


As	mentioned	earlier,	Warren	Buffett's	idea	that	"In	the	short	term	the	market	is	a
popularity	contest;	in	the	long	term	it	is	a	weighing	machine"	is	extremely	relevant	for
NBG.	Until	the	new	shares	are	issued,	it's	possible	for	the	shares	to	trade	on	a	greater-
fool	basis,	where	someone	buys	them	at	prices	well	in	excess	of	the	0.02	EUR	capital
raising	price,	in	the	hope	that	they	can	sell	them	to	a	greater	fool	at	a	higher	price.

However	once	the	shares	are	issued,	then	it's	almost	certain	that	investors	who	bought	at
0.02	EUR	will	be	dumping	their	new	shares	en	masse	if	the	price	remains	above	0.04
EUR	a	share.
