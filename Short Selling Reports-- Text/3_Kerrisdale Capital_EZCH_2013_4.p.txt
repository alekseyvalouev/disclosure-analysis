EZchip: Bullish Case Continues To Myopically Overlook Competitor
Comments, Production Delays, And Stock-Based Compensation
Expense
Mar. 25, 2013 8:30 AM ET21 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Over the past few weeks, we've shared our EZchip Semiconductor (EZCH) investment
opinion in a pair of articles, outlining our belief that EZCH's $717m market capitalization,
8.0x 2013E revenue multiple, and 32.7x 2013E GAAP P/E (adjusted to include
$0.39/share of stock-based compensation) are wholly unjustified. The Bull case depends
on EZCH growing well in excess of the overall router market thorough 2016, a challenge
we believe is unrealistic given an avalanche of near and long-term business risks.
Customer concentration is dangerously high, newly introduced competition from
Broadcom (BRCM) could pressure design wins, Huawei's recent order delay proves that
in-house design risk is ever present, and weak end-market demand will pressure EZCH's
self-imposed 30% revenue growth hurdle (slide 8). To justify EZCH's almost 2x valuation
premium to the S&P 500, it must overcome this hurdle each and every year through 2016.
Most EZCH investors discount these risks, instead trusting a management team that has
over-promised and under-delivered for years, growing the revenue by just 11% annualized
between 2009 and 2012. But since some took the time to reply to our article, we feel a
response is due.

A Response to Feltl & Co's 'Short-Seller' Report


Following our March 11th report on EZchip, Feltl & Co. issued a one-page response that
addressed some of the arguments in our initial report. Feltl also reiterated its "Strong Buy"
recommendation that's been in place since it initiated coverage on August 22nd, 2012 at a
price of $32.28. Feltl's research note gave EZCH investors the positive reinforcement they
craved. After reading through the March 11th report, we believe that Feltl's response
includes the following three key points:


1. Broadcom's June 2012 Linley commentary proves that BCM 88030 targets the switch
market, not EZCH's core end-market of edge routers;


2. Even though Broadcom introduced the BCM 88030 almost a year ago, no explicit
customer wins have been announced;


3. A long sales cycle suggests no immediate competitive threat


In the interest of continuing the conversation, we've taken the time to address Feltl's
response below on a point-by-point basis.


1) More Recent Broadcom Comments Unequivocally State BRCM's Intention to
Compete in EZCH's Core Market of Edge Routers. While Feltl cites Broadcom
commentary from a June Linley conference, we've placed more credence on December
2012 remarks. At its yearly Analyst Day, Broadcom explained that edge routers are its
chief addressable NPU end-market, "Another example of a product that expands our SAM
is [a] 100 gig network processor [BCM 88030] that we introduced earlier this year…this is
a product that [is] very well-positioned for further penetration into the traditional network
processor market in EDGE routers primarily [emphasis added], as well as in some core
router applications, as well as packet transport applications." To drive this point home,
Broadcom included a full-page graphic in the accompanying Investor Presentation that
illustrates this remark. Whether EZCH likes it or not, it will be competing with BRCM for
new Edge Router NPU business.

2) Because Sampling and Testing Occur Over a Protracted Period, the Delay
Between Broadcom's BCM 88030 Announcement and Customer Wins Should be
Expected. Feltl correctly states that the BCM 88030 was first announced in April 2012.
But this passage of time does not imply that the competitive threat is removed. As EZCH
investors know through experience, the sampling and design process is iterated with the
router vendors over a multi-year period before public customer wins are announced.
EZCH first disclosed the research-stage details of its comparable NP-5 product in May
2011 and even after nearly two years, it has yet to provide samples to customers:


<Q - Paul Williams>: The NP-5, when do you think you'll be able to provide
samples to your customers on that?


<A - Eli Frutcher (CEO)>: In [the] June to July [2013] timeframe, I would say.
(EZCH Q4 2012 call).


And in the case of EZCH, timelines can slip. As of November of last year, EZCH expected
to sample an NP-5 "in the first quarter of 2013," a deadline that had previously moved
from Q4 2012 (Q1 2012 EZCH call). Now, the expectation is for late Q2 or early Q3 2013.
As for Broadcom's timeline, it expects to have customers in 2013, "And by the way, you
should be seeing all these products [BCM 88030] in production, right, with customers [in]
2013." (BRCM 2012 Analyst Day).


3) While a Lagging Product Cycle Does Provide EZCH with Run-off Value, EZCH's
$700m Market Capitalization Necessitates Substantial Future Growth. EZchip is not a
cheap stock. An 8x 2013E Revenue and 32.7x 2013E GAAP P/E multiple are indicative of
a rapidly growing business. To achieve the 30%+ annual revenue growth targeted in the

Q4 2012 Investor Presentation, EZCH must hit each of its growth levers in unison --
double-digit end-market growth, market share expansion, and 40% 4-year ASP growth. As
a business whose revenue fell from $63.5m to $54.7m over the past year, EZCH has yet
to deliver on this promise.


Even if EZCH is successful in retaining its current customers, it would be hazardous to
assume vendors wouldn't take advantage of BRCM's entry to pressure EZCH on pricing
and other terms. We are not alone in voicing these risks; EZchip readily acknowledges the
competitive shift in the marketplace:


"We believe that competition in this market will become more intense in the future
and may cause price reductions, reduce gross margins and may result in loss of
market share, any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenue and
decrease our net income." ̶EZCH 2012 20F


For EZCH to sustain its almost 2x valuation premium to the S&P 500, it must not only
transition each NP-4 customer to the NP-5, it must also increase unit pricing and
networking market share, both of which are questioned in the statement above. This task
could be made all the more challenging by continued softness in the router and switching
markets. Last week FBR securities released a report stating that the market for routers
and switches has hit a "dead end." The analyst went on to state, "Looking ahead, we see
the potential for additional negative technological trends that could significantly blur the
lines between routers, switches and servers." As networks move toward the cloud and
data centers, demand for traditional wireline infrastructure will continue to soften. This
sentiment is confirmed by Gartner, a technology research house, who predicts industry-
wide Edge Router and Switch growth of just 3.6% in 2013 (Dec 13th report). EZchip is not
blind to this trend; it has dramatically rebranded its last three investor presentations (Q3,
Q4, and Roth), shifting emphasis from Carrier Ethernet to NPS/Smart Networks.
Unfortunately, shareholders won't see NPS revenue until 2016+, if ever.


The Question of Stock-based Compensation


Other industry analysts, such as Paul McWilliams of Next Inning Technology Research,
challenged our decision to expense stock-based compensation ("SBC") in EZCH's forward
EPS projections. Ours is not a radical idea, and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP) mandate that SBC be expensed from EPS in all SEC filings. To justify EZCH's
add-back and non-GAAP EPS reporting, as used in Wall Street projections, it has been
argued that future cash flows will be used to purchase newly-issued, dilutive stock. We
completely disagree with this concept. Investors pay 18x 2013E EBITDA for EZCH stock

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1297781-ezchip-bullish-case-continues-to-myopically-overlook-competitor-comments-production-delays-and-stock-based-compensati


because they expect to have a claim on future cash flows. If that future cash isn't value
additive, and is instead used to correct for past SBC excesses, the earnings multiple used
to value EZCH should be materially lowered. In light of this, it makes sense that GAAP
dictates that stock-option expense is recognized on the income statement at the time of
grant.


While the effect of this dilution creeps up slowly, ensuring that investors barely notice, it
can have a drastic impact over an extended period. Over the past four years, EZCH's fully
diluted share count has climbed from 23.6m to 29.6m today, resulting in 25% dilution for
investors who first purchased the stock at the end of 2008.


While this track record of steady dilution presents serious red flags for long-term holders
of EZCH shares, it's doubly egregious when investors are also being misled into believing
that non-GAAP financials are indicative of financial performance. In 2012, EZCH reported
a 49% non-GAAP net income margin (Q4 Presentation, Slide 14), a figure that is
frequently cited by bullish investors and the sell-side analysts. After correcting this figure
for 2012's $11.2m of stock-based compensation expense, the margin falls precipitously to
29% (15.902 / 54.707). This is no rounding error. It reminds us that investors need to be
vigilant for excessive non-GAAP earnings adjustments.


Conclusion


While entrenched bulls argue that EZCH has zero competitive threats, we continue to
believe that Broadcom's more complete networking product line (NPUs, switches, KBPs,
multi-core processors, etc.) and lower cost base is a competitive advantage versus
EZchip. Cisco's success over Juniper is illustrative of the benefits of scale. One could

argue that Cisco was able to take share from Juniper because Cisco offered a wider
swath of products at discounted prices. EZCH could face a similar competitive dynamic
from its newly emerged larger competitors.


Equally as important, even if EZCH is successful in retaining its current customers, we
expect that the presence of alternatives such as BRCM will allow Cisco and other
customers to pressure EZCH on pricing and other terms. Given its high customer
concentration, the ability for customers to produce NPU chips in-house if they desired to
allocate the requisite internal resources, and the presence of competitors like Broadcom,
we think that EZCH will perpetually have limited pricing power for its products.


At EZCH's current market capitalization of over $700m, we believe the market remains too
optimistic. Revenue expectations for the next two years are $69.7m (2013) and $94.2m
(2014), requiring a 31% YoY CAGR, well in excess of the 3.6% Edge Router/Switch end-
market growth forecasted by Gartner (December 13th, 2012 report). Revenue growth of
30%+ requires EZCH to fend off Broadcom and in-house ASIC competition, have its
product mix drastically shift towards higher-priced NP-4, and be able to add new business
from Ericsson, Tellabs, and Huawei. If any one of these levers fails to deliver, EZCH will
likely see another year of moribund growth and disappointed shareholders.

As posted on another thread re: BRCM’s PR / CC hype…


My recollections of BRCM’s claiming imminent prominence in the 3G baseband market goes back a long time.


I’ve found over the years that Broadcom has a habit of hyping its position via the PR and webcast / CC route. My first
recollection is from early 2005 when they touted their entry into the WCDMA baseband market--- 10-15% share target
with first deliveries in late 2005.


Broadcom’s Oct 15, 2007 PR and CC “Broadcom Leaps ahead of the competition...” stirred the ire of Brian Modoff of
Deutche Bank in his Oct 22 report under the heading “Press releases and reality”. (note- Brian was cut-off during the
CC when asking penetrating questions).


**Eight** years later BRCM is still hyping but finally gaining some share among the “also rans”.

Author’s reply »  Mullen,


Thanks for the comment. I'll respond from two angles.


First, our central thesis is that EZCH shares are overvalued, in that the current market cap is far too high
relative to a reasonable expectation of what this company's discounted future cash flows are going to be. In
other words, even if EZCH does retain its NPU customers, the presence of BRCM will prevent EZCH from
being able to command high prices from its customers for it next-generation NPU products. If EZCH gets too
aggressive about pricing, Cisco and others would be better off re-focusing efforts to bring designs in-house, or
would go with BRCM. So the entry of BRCM is yet another reason why EZCH is unlikely to meet its lofty
revenue targets.


Second, you're right that Broadcom's track record is not beyond critique and it could fail to gain customers for
its edge router products. But it's nevertheless dangerous to completely dismiss the entry of a $20 billion
company with 8,700 R&D employees into EZchip's core end-market. The CEO of a $20 billion company does
not spend 5 minutes at his annual investor day to expound on a revenue opportunity that doesn't exist. Here's
a quote from the Broadcom CEO:


"I want to take one area in particular, which is the network processor space. We've got some tremendous
technology from NetLogic. We looked at all the different companies and we evaluated their technology. We're
looking to buy one. And we decided NetLogic was by far the best, so we bought them. And how has that
done? It's gone very well. We're shipping our 40-nanometer product in volume today. We're sampling our 28-
nanometer product, which we believe is best-in-class in the space. We're ramping a lot of new customers,
seeing good traction. We've grown that group every quarter since we acquired it. We're gaining share and
we're expanding from the data plane into the control plane. So an opportunity to grow into a new space, okay,
with those processors. So we're very excited about this technology. We think it's doing very well. We have
very high hopes for it going forward." - Broadcom CEO, December 2012 Analyst Day

EZCH now has direct competition in high-end NPUs where it historically had little or none. Whether this
competitive dynamic impacts EZCH on price, market share, or growth opportunities is hard to speculate, but
we think that the stock isn't fully discounted for this piece of information.

Re: Your continued use of BRCM in supporting your short against EZCH….


You appear to somewhat agree with me re: BRCM’s hype, saying…


** ”…You're right that Broadcom's track record is not beyond critique and it could fail to gain customers for its
edge router products. But it's nevertheless dangerous to completely dismiss their entry….” Into EZCH’s
markets.


I’d say it’s even more “dangerous” to short a viable and growing company that has over many years
established a significant customer base in a very specialized field and states …


”…(EZCH).."...Our experience in developing several generations of network processors with integrated traffic
managers, as well as working closely with leading carrier equipment vendors has enabled us to develop the
expertise and gain deep understanding of our target systems, the requirements and how they are best
addressed. We believe this represents a considerable barrier of entry for potential competitors.”


….yet , you go on to use BRCM’s CEO’s comments supporting your case, saying ,…**…” The CEO of a $20
billion company does not spend 5 minutes at his annual investor day to expound on a revenue opportunity
that doesn't exist. …” quoting their CEO’s comments regarding the Netlogic acquisitions hyping their NPU
business….

>>>>>


I stated in two previous posts, BRCM has a habit of seriously hyping their “opportunitities” and missing their
“goals” by years (8 years and counting in the baseband market)


Does BRCM currently sell a product that competes with EZCH NPU 3 or 4 or 5?


Does BRCM have one design win with Cisco in EZCH’s NPU space?


Until the above happens your short story is “dangerously” based purely on speculation at the highest level.

Author’s reply »  You laud EZchip's customer base. OK, let's talk about that customer base. EZchip earns 40-

distract focus from other areas. OK, this seems reasonable when Cisco's costs for the EZChip designs are
$20m to $30m (we're not even including the costs that go to MRVL for the manufacturing). But the EZchip
long thesis is based on revenues doubling over the next 3 years. Would Cisco still be willing to use EZchip
designs if it were costing it $70m to $100m? And frankly, why would Cisco even be willing to pay that much?
Why not just tell EZchip that they don't want to. What is EZCH going to do -- stand up to Cisco and lose 50%
of their revenue base?


Another 20% of revenue is transitory, as Juniper decided to move to in-house silicon in 2009. ZTE is a lumpy,
unpredictable 10% contribution and EZCH has little visibility on their near-term spending habits. The final two
Top 5 router vendors are Alcatel (not a customer) and Huawei (a partial customer in the best-case scenario).
Examples abound in the tech hardware sector of niche merchant vendors with extreme valuations whose
shares fell overnight on the loss of a key customer account.


I'm not sure whether anyone knows with certainty whether BRCM is selling NPUs to Cisco. Broadcom earns
$8bn a year, making it unlikely that they would call out a design win that stole a measly $25m of revenue from
EZchip. But BRCM is just one of the many risks present in this name. What you've neglected to focus on are
EZCH's production delays, constant shareholder dilution, the low likelihood that management can live up to
the market's expectation of 30%/year revenue growth, etc. That 30% growth hurdle is the consensus view.
Anything less and investors/analysts will be disappointed and the stock likely falls.

Author’s reply »  Thanks. Management's language on this issue has been vague. But it's really not an
important part of our argument for why we think EZCH is overvalued. So rather than get into a back-and-forth
debate about vague management commentary around a trivial matter, we just asked Seeking Alpha to
remove that argument. The article has since been edited.

It's not trivial to your competition hypothesis if Cisco and ZTE have "selected" the NP-5 over the Broadcom
BCM 88030. Given that BRCM announced the BCM 88030 series 11 months ago, presumably CSCO and
ZTE evaluated the NP-5 against the Broadcom product. Why do you think this new information is trivial? If

validation of your hypothesis, right?


26 Mar 2013, 07:12 AM


Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We call it trivial only in the context of our overall short thesis, in that an NP-5 design loss is
only one of many ways that EZCH would fail to hit the Street's 30% growth target. It's hard to argue that the
entry of a lower-cost, horizontally-integrated competitor into this niche field won't at all challenge pricing and
market share. Perhaps EZCH does have an NP-5 design win in one class of routers, but maybe Cisco and
ZTE also source BRCM silicon for another 100Gb device. Or maybe the vendors leverage BRCM's presence
to negotiate EZCH down on pricing. And Huawei's order delay might be because they are using BRCM silicon
(EZCH only speculates that it's in-house). At a price of 32x P/E, the valuation does not incorporate the
potential for these suboptimal scenarios to play out.


As for the specific issue of ZTE and Cisco being customers of EZchip's NP-5 product, I recognize the
disclosure you point out.  
Yes, "Cisco has selected a customized version of the NP-3, NP-4 and NP-5 for its principal CESR platforms"
and "ZTE has also selected the NP-4 and NP-5 for several of its CESR platforms." These statements don't
elaborate on the extent of the Cisco / ZTE relationships / contracts with respect to the NP-5.


Management had plenty of opportunity to clarify the extent of the NP-5 contracts in its conference call. Here's
the call transcript: http://seekingalpha.co...


Search for the term NP-5. And see for yourself whether the company uses language that confirms that
customers have already selected the NP-5, or that management "believes" and "expects" NP-4 customers to
transition to the NP-5.

Hello Mr. bank

Fasterrats
I'm not convinced you understand the business, nor have you done your homework (as rivershore has pointed out...).


Exactly what CESR products do you foresee BRCM getting into?


CSCO's edge strategy is clearly the ASR line (EZCH), and I believe their last line to address this market (Catalyst
6000 & 7000 lines) lasted almost a decade, and is still going strong...


Ericsson's eggs (for Easter) are in the SSR basket (EZCH), and their last edge line (Redback) goes back to when I
worked for BBN/Genuity (over a decade ago).

JNPR has Trio which they spent 5 years developing, and ALU has the FF3, which was a result of the Timetra
acquisition, several years ago. Both of these are ASIC solutions. I can't see them going away anytime soon, based on
the investment these companies sunk into them.


ZTE has been with EZCH since the NP-1, and their "next-gen" edge products are "Powered by EZCH":

For that matter, Tellab's 8660, CIEN 6500 and several other smaller routing companies have based their "next-gen"
products on EZCH (ECI, RAD, etc.) and these are very sticky design wins. EZCH is still enjoying NP-2 revenue from
JNPR's MX and SRX lines nearly 8 years later and several years after Trio was released.


I believe the last time I looked, Hauwei had less than 8 percent share of the CESR space. Not very impressive, but
they will contribute on the high end in the future.


The market has already decided for the foreseeable future. I believe the expression to be: "A day late and a dollar
short".

Excellent rebuttals. Although no investment is without risks that might not even be known, this article is mostly
innuendo and hyperbole. The fact is that EZchip is the dominant NPU at present and in the foreseable future. Then to
be followed with the NPS product. The only reason EZ has not delivered on the revenue growth previously expected
is because of the end users, the carriers, decision to not spend in 2012. It is not the fault of EZ as they have no
control over the end users spending. This in itself is a risk in investing in an EZchip type of company. But capex
spending is up with many billions of dollars being committed to expanding the network by the carriers going into 2013.

It is true that EZ has reduced its revenue targets going forward and that was a reason to short the stock, but at a
much higher level. Now, with revenues poised to increase based on carrier capex spending AND THE KNOWN
CONTRACT WINS in multiple carrier platforms, EZ is ready reap the rewards and from a much lower stock price and
a much reduced current P/E.


I see no reason why, barring the unforeseen, which is always a potential risk, that EZ cannot achieve the reduced but
still dynamic growth of 30% a year for the next several years.

I suspect that the author of this article has already taken a rather large short position against EZCH and is attempting
to use repeated articles on Seeking Alpha to scare investors in order to gain some advantage for his position. ( I think
his last article sent EZCH down and it immediately bounced back up the same day). If this is the rationale for these
articles, then all of the facts and discussion in this matter will not dissuade him. Also, if this is true, the use of calling
others myopic is especially ironic. But thanks to all who commented on these articles.

Thank you for the opportunity to buy more EZCH at a lower price.

BRCM CEO took 5 mins talking about Net Logic acquisition and their technology, it doesn't mean they have a product
to compete with EZCH. Though Net Logic was focused on NP area too, however, their product doesn't compete with
EZ directly, they address the different need in network protocol, and their chips were co-exist with EZ in the EDGE or
CORE route product before they were taken over. Another former BRCM aquisition (Sandpiper) years ago had the
chips directly compete with EZCH, however, i don't think they have any such product now since EZ beat it badly.

I am neither long nor short EZChip/EZCH, but I recognize excellent analysis when I read it. Thank you.


EZCH achieved its all time high almost precisely 1 year ago at $46.79. (This high bettered its previous high by a few
$$.) Since that high, it has endured a hellacious plummet, more than 50% from high to intra-day low. Now it sits only a
few $$ above that intra-day low.


Your worst case scenario calls for $12/share, approximately another 50% plummet from its current price... But only
another ~$12/share. Is it time, perhaps, to begin to look the other way? That is, long term investors should buy
declines to $20, or even $12...? Perhaps you view EZCH as a terminal short?


If this company's widget is SO good, why is it still a one product company that sells to only one company? Certainly
other companies would be beating down their door to buy or license their technology if it is so good.

So, what does a shortie do when ASR9000 sales go up 69%, per the CSCO conference call?

Congratulations to team $EZCH for their record breaking quarter, their #1 market share confirmed by The Linley
Group, their 84% GM and their beating earnings once again, top and bottom line.

Author’s reply »  This stock is still very overvalued. It was another quarter of uninspiring revenue and earnings, and
it's a bit shocking that the stock price continues to hover at its current levels.

It is indeed "shocking that the stock price continues to hover at its current levels" - the stock is way
UNDERvalued. EZCH's cash is 27% of its market cap. After backing out cash, their forward PE is only 11
while now growing at a 30% annual rate. Their gross profit margins are 85% and they are banking half their
revenues each quarter while continuing R&D on their game-changing NPS chip (see article "EZChip Breaks
the NPU Mold" from 10-15-12 at http://www.MPRonline.com). This company is more than financially sound,
undervalued, increasing its cash reserves each quarter, growing, and on the cusp of introducing their
revolutionary NPS chip. This is a rare price dislocation representing a great buying opportunity.

It is pretty obvious from your writing that you misunderstand the technology, the business model, the competition and
$JNPR, $CSCO and networking in general. Did you listen to either the $CSCO events or the conference call. 102%
YOY revenue growth annually is inspiring enough. I am amazed at your persistence and willingness to try to distort
the facts. Do you realize that $JNPR revenue has gone up for 10 years AFTER they started their own ASIC. That
$CSCO reiterated it's value of $EZCH. That Linley says NO ONE has a better product than NPS. That data center is
not even factored into the $EZCH real value of $40. I will continue to bet against you. I am not losing sleep over the
risk. $EZCH owns the long tail in networking. #1 market share now and in the future with the NPS.
