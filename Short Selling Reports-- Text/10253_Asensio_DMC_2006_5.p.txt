DMC’s Description of Ruling


is Incomplete and Defective.


Yesterday Document Security Systems, Inc.’s (AMEX: DMC,


$8.60) stock promotion su�ered a serious blow when in a 45


page memorandum containing over 194 paragraphs of


analysis and fact �ndings the European Central Bank (“ECB”)


won a decisive precedent setting decision and the revocation


DMC’s European Patent in the United Kingdom. After news


of the ruling appeared DMC then issued a press release


essentially claiming that its suit against ECB remains


economically viable. It appears reasonable to conclude that


both the suit and the press release show questionable


judgment (at best) and bad faith (not necessarily at worse.)


This ruling is the same fate its predecessor incurred in 1995


when its patent infringement suit against the United States


Treasury Department resulted in its patents being invalid.


(See May 18, 2006 asensio.com report titled “DMC: One More


For The Movies.”)


DMC used irregular stock transactions to obtain the funds to


�le the suit against ECB and then began a stock promotion


based on the pro�t potential of the suit. The highly


questionable matter of both the funding and the suit, along


with the 1995 loss, and DMC’s lack of organizational or


�nancial credibility, all reasonably point to the serious


likelihood that DMC is nothing more that a stock promotion

scheme to bene�t those that created and funded the idea of


suing ECB.


Among the long string of �ndings adverse to DMC in the UK


decision are that: its patent is not directed to the problem of


new copiers, essentially teaches pre-existing general


knowledge that would be of little assistance to the skilled


person, and is not written in the clearest terms.


The decision also states that the European Bankers Printer


Conference of 1987 and a Four Nation Group of Central


Banks in 1988 had essentially addressed the issues allegedly


contained in DMC’s patents before DMC’s �ling occurred.


DMC issued a press release aimed at defending the


legitimacy of its patent-infringement claim against the ECB


stating it had “successfully defended against all forms of


‘prior act’ and all other claims of invalidity.” We do not


believe the decision contains any such �nding or order.


In its press release DMC also claims the UK decision “does


not a�ect the validity of its patent in other European


countries.” Again, we disagree. Moreover, DMC omitted any


mention of the International Bureau of World International


Property Organization’s March 13, 2007 issuance of a report


denying a DMC European Patent O�ce �ling. The denial was


based on a reasoned statement that DMC’s subject matter is


not new, appears not to be novel since their use is well


known and has so many claims drafted in such a way that


even a skilled person would �nd it hard to �gure out the


protection DMC is seeking.


The ECB has also issued claims for the revocation of DMC’s


patent in other European jurisdictions. In addition, the ECB


has challenged DMC’s infringement claim independent of its


validity challenge. The British case is the �rst to be heard.


The UK decision does not allow for any o�cial shorthand


note of its judgment and has not yet entered its Order. Privacy  - Terms

DMC’s o�cial press release can only cause the Court to be


even more severe in its condemnation of DMC’s claims.


This adverse ruling comes almost one year after questions


concerning the legitimacy of DMC’s claims and irregular


stock transactions made their �rst public appearance. The


decision’s detailed technical fact discovery and �ndings that


add credence to the belief held by some that DMC’s claims


were never brought in good faith but were formed to create


a questionable, and possibly illegal, penny-stock promotion


scheme.


At this point, DMC may be well advised to make a review of


its compliance with regulations governing misleading


statements to investors a higher priority than promoting its


stock.
