Image Sensing Systems
(ISNS) – Significant Risk
Factor From 10-K
September 5, 2014 By stoup


Here is an excerpt from our short thesis article on Image
Sensing Systems (ISNS) made available to our premium
members on 9/3/2014 and published on Seeking Alpha on
9/4/2014.  The excerpt highlights a reality that the size
and growth of  one of ISNS’S key target market in the U.S
could be limited. We believe it also brings to light the
pressure the law enforcement agencies face when deciding
where funds in already tight budget will be deployed.  We
also conclude that law enforcement will be more inclined to
loosen the purse strings for DGLY products.


“The use of video and LPR products and systems
has been challenged, limited and banned under
existing laws, ordinances and regulations and
constitutional provisions protecting privacy
rights. In addition, governments and
governmental agencies have stopped or
suspended their use of LPR systems. For
example, Maine, New Jersey and Virginia have
laws limiting the use of LPR systems; New
Hampshire bans their use; legislation has been
proposed in Minnesota limiting the use of data
collected by LPR systems; and the Boston Police
Department has indefinitely halted its use of LPR
systems. In addition, laws, ordinances,
regulations and constitutional provisions may be
adopted in the future to limit the use of video
and LPR products and systems. These existing

and new laws, ordinances, regulations and
constitutional provisions could negatively affect
the acceptance and sale of our video and LPR
products and systems and thus have a negative
effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.”


Many citizens oppose Big Brother spy tactics, but
would welcome a product where law enforcement
is seemingly held in check.  In a time where
budgets are tight, government agencies need to
consider this reality when doling out money for
law enforcement products.


The appeal of some of DLGY’s law enforcement
body worn products is that action is recorded
once police officers exit their vehicles making
them accountable for their actions. ISNS’s
crime/police product is more like a standalone
“big brother is watching you product,” with the
purpose of reading license plates for data
aggregation and analysis. While useful, it is
certainly not the new “sexy” explosive growth
story DGLY is pitching. We believe this to be an
extremely important distinction that investors
need to wrap their heads around.


What that Street story didn’t mention,
interestingly enough, was petitions being signed
for license plate. Conversely, people seem to be
opposed to broad types of surveillance, versus
the personalized accountability that comes with
individual police cameras. We believe this to be
the tulip craze all over again.
