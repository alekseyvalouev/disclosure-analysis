Concrete Evidence That FAB Universal Issued Chinese Bonds Without
Telling U.S. Investors
Nov. 21, 2013 1:06 PM ET33 comments
by: The GeoTeam


FAB Universal (NYSEMKT:FU) has completely failed to address in any substantive way a
growing series of reports that challenge the core of FAB's business and expose an almost
complete lack of fiduciary responsibility and corporate governance by FAB's U.S.
management:


September 26 and October 1, 2013: TWO ARTICLES discuss massive dilution and
insider selling issues, while also beginning to question FAB's Chinese 5C Media Kiosk
operation.
November 14, 2013: Alfred Little put out a scathing report concluding that FAB
Universal is a fraud. He found FAB guilty of rampant piracy, back-end deals with
franchisees that offered FU stock and guarantee returns, and of inflating its kiosk count
by as much as 10 times.
November 18, 2013: GeoInvesting reported evidence from three independent sources
confirming that FAB had failed to disclose a 100 million RMB ($16.4 million) Chinese
bond issuance by its VIE subsidiary.
November 19, 2013: Alfred Little announced he had caught FAB management red-
handed covering up piracy following the publication of his original report.


In today's report, we present new evidence that proves FAB's Chinese VIE
subsidiary secretly issued 100 million RMB ($16.4 million) in bonds.


On November 19, 2013, GeoInvesting obtained a final draft of the 113-page 12 FAB Bond
prospectus dated April 2013 from the underwriter, Industrial Securities, detailing the
private offering of 100 million RMB of 11% corporate bonds by FAB Digital (bond ticker
SZ118089, short name: "12 FAB Bond"). Note: Similar to SEC filings, final executed
copies of the privately issued 12 FAB Bond prospectus are not publicly available.


The information in the prospectus reveals:


FAB's Chinese VIE subsidiary, FAB Digital, was in fact the issuer of the bonds.
How risky VIE agreements can be for U.S. shareholders' ownership interest
assumptions.
The 12 FAB Bond prospectus omits any discussion of the VIE agreements and the
U.S. shareholders' interests as portrayed in SEC documents.

Issuing the bonds without the WFOE's approval was a clear violation of the VIE
agreements disclosed in SEC filings.


In order to execute the bond offering, the Chairman may have pledged his FU shares
as collateral.


A Serious undisclosed related party relationship between FAB and Huzhong, the
operator of the kiosks.


FAB's Chinese auditor for its 12 FAB Bond issuance, Zhonglei CPA, had its license to
audit securities issuers revoked by the CSRC after a failed audit of a fraudulent
Chinese company. (Engaging in improper behavior in terms of obtaining audit trails
and forming audit opinions that resulted in the issuance of falsified statements in the
auditor's report).


Further confirmation that this bond offering occurred is through a recorded conversation
we had with Daton Securities, one of the buyers of 12 FAB Bond, that confirmed Daton
Securities knew nothing about FAB Digital being controlled by a US listed company.


The following are the detailed findings in the prospectus:


1. FAB's Chinese VIE "FAB Digital" was the issuer of the bonds.


Page 64 of the prospectus shows that the bond issuer, Beijing FAB Digital Entertainment
Products Co., Ltd ("FAB Digital"), was 100% owned by Beijing FAB Culture Media Co., Ltd
("FAB Media"). This is identical to the organizational structure FAB presents in its 2012 10-
K filed on 3/18/13. The prospectus confirms that the legal representative of FAB Digital is
Jiliang Ma, consistent with FAB's June 1, 2012 proxy. The descriptions of FAB's business,
including wholesale, retail, and network of approximately 15,000 5C kiosks are nearly
identical to those described in FAB's SEC filings. Most importantly, on page 80 of the
prospectus, FAB Chairman Hongcheng Zhang is listed as a director of the issuer (FAB
Digital) and a registered 60% shareholder of the issuer's parent company, FAB Media,
matching FAB's disclosure in the VIE contracts annexed to the proxy.


FAB Digital's prior ownership structure was disclosed in the March 15, 2012 VIE
agreements annexed to the proxy as follows:


"As of the date of this Agreement, Wang Gang and Zhang Hongcheng are the
registered shareholders of FAB Digital, legally holding all equity interests of FAB
Digital, of which Wang Gang holding 35% interest, Zhang Hongcheng holding 65%."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1855271-concrete-evidence-that-fab-universal-issued-chinese-bonds-without-telling-u-s-investors 3/16


The 12 FAB Bond prospectus outlines the series of changes to the ownership structure of
FAB Digital that precisely match up with the ownership disclosures in FAB's proxy filing:


April 15, 2010, …Hongcheng Zhang contributes RMB 650,000, 65%, Gang Wang
contributes 350,000, 35%. Legal representative is changed from Jing Zhang to Gang
Wang.


March 3, 2012, based upon issuer's Shareholders' Meeting decision, the legal
representative is changed from Gang Wang to Jiliang Ma.


July 23, 2012, based upon issuer's Shareholders' Meeting decision and approved by
Dongcheng AIC Branch of Beijing AIC, Hongcheng Zhang transferred his 65% and Gang
Wang transferred his 35% of FAB Digital to FAB Media.


All of the above unquestionably confirms that FAB's consolidated VIE, FAB Digital, was
indeed the issuer of the 12 FAB Bond. FAB's Chinese Chairman, U.S. CEO, and CFO
concealed and then vehemently denied the existence of this bond offering in violation of
multiple securities laws:


Section 17(a) of the Securities Act for making untrue statements of material fact and
engaging in transactions that deceived purchasers of FAB common stock.
Section 13(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act for filing inaccurate quarterly reports and
failing to disclose indebtedness.
Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act for failure to keep accurate books and records.
Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-2 of the Exchange Act for knowingly falsifying books
and records and making materially false and misleading statements.

SOX Section 302 for principal officers falsely certifying the integrity of financial reports.
SOX Section 906 for falsely certifying that financial reports were accurate and reflected
the true financial condition of the issuer.


2. FAB's WFOE's VIE management agreements and US investors' interests are
totally ignored in the 12 FAB Bond prospectus.


The 12 FAB Bond prospectus totally ignores the contractual rights of control that FAB's
VIE's granted to FAB's wholly foreign owned enterprise ("WFOE") via management
agreements (the "VIE agreements"). The complete disregard of U.S. investors is
immediately obvious in the corporate structure presented in the 12 FAB Bond prospectus
as follows:


Missing from the diagram is Beijing Dingtai Guanqun Culture Co., Ltd. (the "WFOE"), that
through VIE agreements should have complete control of FAB Media and FAB Digital. The
US investors' interests (contractually exerted by the WFOE) are totally ignored in the 12
FAB Bond prospectus.


As a result of the lack of disclosure, Chinese purchasers of the 12 FAB Bond are unaware
that FU investors, through the WFOE, control and are entitled to 100% of profits of FAB
Media and FAB Digital through the VIE agreements. Our recorded conversation with
Daton Securities, one of the buyers of 12 FAB Bond, confirmed that Daton Securities
knew nothing about FAB Digital being controlled by a US listed company.


Most importantly, the issuance of the 12 FAB Bond without the approval of the WFOE is a
violation of the VIE agreements. According to Article 2.4 of "The Exclusive Service
Agreement" annexed to the proxy, the WFOE shall be in charge of FAB Digital's and FAB
Media's funds and contract execution, including approval of the issuance of corporate
bonds (among numerous other rights set forth in the agreement to protect investors).


To summarize in plain English: FAB Digital needed to get the WFOE's approval to issue
the bonds, but the prospectus hid this requirement from the Chinese bond buyers.


3. The prospectus reveals an astonishingly undisclosed related party relationship
between FAB and Beijing Huzhong Culture Co., Ltd.

On page 35 of FAB's June 1, 2012 proxy, FAB disclosed the operational management and
revenue sharing arrangement of its 5C kiosks business as follows,


According to FAB, Beijing Huzhong Culture Co Ltd ("Huzhong Culture") is responsible for
operating and maintaining its 5C kiosks network entitling Huzhong Culture to a share of
the kiosks' advertising and membership sales. FAB provides no further details regarding
Huzhong Culture, despite its very central and key role in FAB's kiosk operation.


According to page 32 (shown below) of the 12 FAB Bond prospectus, Huzhong (Beijing)
Culture Development Co. Ltd (互众(北京)文化发展有限公司) pledged its owner's equity as
collateral for the 12 FAB Bond. According to the prospectus, the owners of Huzhong
Culture are Jiang Zhou (80%) and Jianming Cui (20%). Huzhong Culture's business is
described as "focusing on the business operation of 5C entertainment kiosks."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1855271-concrete-evidence-that-fab-universal-issued-chinese-bonds-without-telling-u-s-investors 6/16


Why would Huzhong Culture, a supposedly unrelated company to FAB, pledge its
assets to secure the 12 FAB Bond?


The answer is revealed on page 39 (shown below) of the prospectus:


"Mr. Hongcheng Zhang is the actual controlling person of the Company (FAB
Digital), FAB Media, FAB Group and Huzhong Culture." [emphasis added]


Based on this statement in the prospectus, FAB failed to disclose in its SEC filings
countless related party transactions between its subsidiaries, franchisees, and Huzhong
Culture (the operator of the kiosks). Such widespread hidden related party transactions
call into question the true role of Huzhong Culture, which may be simply to help FAB cook
its books, further calling into question the revenues and profitability of FAB's entire kiosk
operation.


4. FAB Chairman Hongcheng Zhang may have pledged his FU shares to secure the
bonds.


According page 39 (shown above) of the prospectus, Zhang personally guarantees the 12
FAB Bond. The prospectus specifically cites Zhang's 49% ownership in the NYSE listed
FAB Universal as proof of Zhang's ability to pay. We can't tell from the prospectus, but
Zhang may have pledged his FU shares to secure the bonds.


5. FAB's Chinese auditor for its 12 FAB Bond issuance, Zhonglei CPA, had its
license to audit securities issuers revoked

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1855271-concrete-evidence-that-fab-universal-issued-chinese-bonds-without-telling-u-s-investors 7/16


Zhonglei CPA Co., Ltd. (中磊会计师事务所) was the Chinese auditor of FAB Digital's
financials, according to page 15 of the prospectus. After Zhonglei's client, WanFuShengKe
(SZ300268), was determined to be a fraud by the Chinese Securities Regulatory
Commission ("CSRC"), Zhonglei's license to audit securities issuers was revoked after
Zhonglei was found negligent by the CSRC for:


a). Failing to perform proper audit procedures on Wang Fu Sheng Ke's IPO and 2011
financials;


b). Engaging in improper behavior in terms of obtaining audit trails and forming audit
opinions that resulted in the issuance of falsified statements in the auditor's report.


All of Zhonglei's ongoing securities-related audit projects were suspended. Zhonglei
clients were forced to switch to other firms. Kaisong Huang, the CPA who audited the FAB
financials presented in the bond prospectus, moved to DaXin CPA LLP.


6.The Longyuan Building FAB is considering buying appears to have been pledged
as collateral to secure the 12 FAB Bond. Why would the owner of the Longyuan
Building agree to secure the 12 FAB Bond?


FAB stated on page 21 of its 2013 Q2 10-Q that:


"In order to expand our business of media entertainment and copyright transaction,
in June 2013 we made approximately a $13 million dollar refundable deposit to
purchase the Longyuan Building in Miyun, Beijing… The building is 95,000 square
feet…


Should the board approval purchase of the Longyuan Building in Miyum, Beijing, we
will be obligated to make two remaining payment installments prior to transfer of the
building, the first not later than November 2013 in the approximate amount of $13
million and the second not later than March 2014 in the approximate amount of $6.5
million."


As shown in the following screenshot of page 28 of the prospectus, "the entire 3rd to 9th
floor, 2nd floor of the building's west side, underground parking space and storage" of the
Longyuan Building (隆源大厦) totaling 9,499.95 square meters will be formally pledged as
the first collateral for the 12 FAB Bond. (1 square meter = 10.8 square feet.)

The pledged portion of the Longyuan Building was appraised at RMB 90.28 million (USD
$14.8 million). The current owner of Longyuan Building, according to the prospectus, is
Beijing Longyuan Building Housing Development Co., Ltd.


What was FAB really doing by depositing $13 million in June 2013 to acquire the
Longyuan Building that was pledged in April 2013 by its current owner to secure FAB
Digital's $16.4 million 12 FAB Bond offering?


FAB's Bold Response


In response to our report revealing FAB's undisclosed debt, on November 20th, 2013, FAB
issued a press release repeating its vehement denial of the recent allegations. FAB
therefore certainly appears to be denying that FAB Digital ever issued the 12 FAB Bond.


In addition to the numerous Chinese websites that confirm this bond issuance, on
10/25/13 the Daton Tri-Stone #2 asset management fund published its Q3 2013 fund
management report that disclosed that the fund continued to hold 20 million RMB of 12
FAB Bonds.


Investors can download the report direct from Daton's website (the 6th item from the top):


Furthermore, GeoInvesting recorded a call to the Daton fund manager who acknowledged
the fund's holdings of the 12 FAB Bond as of 9/30/2013.


How can FAB possibly continue to deny the existence of these bonds secretly issued by
FAB Digital?

Comments (33)


It's been one week since the allegations of fraud and misrepresentation have first been
reported. FAB management has made breezy blanket statements defending their
innocence rather than even attempting to refute a single allegation with any detail. FAB
has yet to appoint an independent committee to examine our findings. Our question today
is simple and applies to both the US management of FAB as well as the auditor, Friedman
LLP. Do you deny that the 12 FAB Bond is in fact a bond issued by your VIE
subsidiary to investors in China? Answer this simple question. If you deny it then
please explain how all this evidence could possibly be wrong! The most important
question to be answered: Is anyone on FAB's US management team willing to step up
to protect US investors?


Disclosure: I am short FU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I
am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I think most US "investors" believe that foriegn stocks are vetted before they are placed on US markets and this is not
the case. Chinese business people clearly understand the enforcement weakness inherent in allowing them to use
the stock market as a revenue mechanism rather than a funding one, also the extreme weakness in the GAAP
standards, securities oversight, entities, and reverse mergers. There are so many similar frauds happening within US
companies that clearly their tactic is to hide among the normalcy of using the stock of a money losing (often
eventually bankrupt company) to enrich its principals and owners, often completely legally from a criminal point of

view, though not from a derivative or regulatory law standpoint, and then allow the beast to die after the profits have
been taken from the stupid commons.


Stock markets have always been subject to this kind of garbage, but to now have literally hundreds of chinese
companies traded on US markets that have no oversight, accountabilty or transparency is simply a bad idea, and the
only reason they can get away with it is that there are so many other shady, irregular games being played on the
investing public that the chinese company ADR/RVM is simply not the biggest fish to fry.

Late to the put party but my word. You sell kiosk 'businesses' to people and guarantee a buyback in 2 years subject to
performance triggers and you buy back with your own company stock. The movies your kiosk small entrepreneurs sell
are $0.13 USD / movie.


Why is this stock not delisted already?

Thanks. Normally would say yes but 3 of 4 days down and down today even as the market goes up. I'll stay

Institutional investors aren't going to be moving in the save this. They weren't present before and won't be
buying in now. Figure retail might come in for a feeding at $2 though so out then.

FU has been around for a decade trading at these levels. What you've found is trail of how business is done in China.
They state they have over 43.6M cash in the bank...why not just make a concrete statement saying that's fake and FU
can either prove you wrong or not. This long winded stuff is boring and designed to transfer money from investors into
your pockets. Step up or get off the pot!

FAB Universal didn't exist until 2012, until the reverse merger with Wizzard Software. And yes, Wizzard
traded well above these levels on a split adjusted basis (4-5 times higher), but FAB has NOT.


And, if you don't like the "long winded stuff" then why bother reading (or commenting) on it?


21 Nov 2013, 02:41 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Why would anyone challenge FAB's cash, when FAB can easily pay a bank employee in China to print out
whatever balance FAB wants? The truth requires hard work and diligence, which Geo continues to do
remarkably well.

User 5877231
Cash is irrelevant, stop bringing it up.


The question is their business model (selling kiosks and guaranteeing buy back with cash / co stock in 2 yrs is
a red flag). 2nd red flag: selling US movies for $0.13 USD. Those 2 facts alone combined with the stock price
under $5 - no institutional investors are going to drive this stock up.


21 Nov 2013, 04:35 PM


Lucky?
Hey, I made an attempt to follow it, but so convoluted and full of assumptions it's hard to follow. It looks to me like
Zhang wanted the 16M to put a deposit on a bldg and probably pledged his shares in FAB as collateral. Maybe they
needed the cash fast, but whatever, the bondholders don't seem to be upset, and it was their money. Just looks like
more short bashing to me. Just step up and state FAB's 43M cash is fake. Why haven't the shorts stated this? This
would take FAB ten minutes to reply to. All this convoluted crap takes time to reply to. Have to admit, it is making the
shorts money as investors are running scared.


21 Nov 2013, 03:19 PM


User 5877231
Unlike the NQ mobile short thesis, this short thesis is simple. Why are they selling kiosks with buy back
provisions in 2 yrs and how much profit can one make legitimately selling 'legit' movies for $0.13 USD /
movie?

Anyway, this company is making profit. Their business is growing. They may have some problems at this moment in
that environment, like other companies over there, they are improving and they will fix them. There is a big
entertainment market in China and can make big profit, that is a sure fact.

Monday morning Thomson Reuters upgraded FU to Buy. Since then the stock has gone from $5 to $3. As far as I can
see, they have never had a Buy rating on the stock, and you should be aware they have made many mistakes in
stock ratings. So did Jefferson Research and Zach's. I would avoid using these ratings services.

GMI was right on this stock and has only had sell and neutral ratings on this stock, with a Sell rating since 10/10. I
know nothing about this ratings service.

Jaywalk has a buy and The Street has a hold, might be a good time to start looking for a price you can't
refuse.

Way too much conjecture. So Zhang pledged his holdings of FU for the bond money, yet the article implies the
bondholders knew nothing of FU, only FAB digital? How do they know nothing of FU when supposedly Zhang pledged
his shares as collateral for the bond? Then it's stated Zhang pledged all his holding of FAB digital, which he already
traded for FU, as collateral (which the bondholders accepted even though it doesn't exist anymore...boy are they
stupid). Then, because the bondholders needed some more collateral, Zhang gave them part of a building they knew
he didn't even own yet. What the heck? Either these bondholders are brain dead or something else played out here.
Should be interesting when the company responds. NQ is also taking it's time, but the share price is up 100% from
where it bounced. I suspect FU's share price will share a similar fate. Anyone know the bottom please post it.

Some guys at Arthur Douglas & Associates, INC. called me every week trying to convince me to buy in (personally
and with my client's money) on FU. It was pretty easy to disregard. I pity anyone who rode this trainwreck all the way
to the end.

I feel so strongly for every little guy or tiny lady in an English speaking country that got shafted here big time! This
incredible POS is open for trade again this morning. Sell immediately!! Take your losses now, before your shares are
absolutely worthless. Do NOT count on any US law firm to recover any or all of your losses. They will only drink an
extra pint of your blood. They will have to deal with a communist regime in a remote land, where "screw the
American" seems to be a hugely growing trend.  
In the future, DO NOT EVER TOUCH A CHINESE ADR WITH A TEN FOOT POLE!! DO NOT!! 
Remember the line from "where have all the flowers gone": "when will they ever learn?". Don't you ever forget it.
Learn!!!

Been spending a few hours trying to figure this out, as this article simple makes no sense to me. Why would Zhang
get a loan/bond for 16M, advertise it over the internet, and then not expect to get caught? Why would Zhang allow
FAB to even attempt to buy a 40M building when he knows all the cash is fake and it will expose that fact. The piracy
and Kiosks arguments are easy to get around, the bond is not...at least in my mind. So how to explain Zhang running
out and getting a bond (taking SA word for it). After looking through the 10K I read this: "PRC laws provide that a
director or certain member of senior management owes a fiduciary duty to the company he directs or manages.
These individuals must therefore act in good faith and in the best interests of the relevant VIE and must not use their
respective positions for personal gain. These laws DO NOT require them to consider best interests of DEI when
making decisions as a director or member of management of the relevant VIE. Conflicts may arise between these
individuals’ fiduciary duties as directors and officers of the VIE and DEI. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of
interest arise, these individuals will act in the best interests of the Company or DEI or those conflicts of interest will be
resolved in favor of the Company or DEI." 
Simple explanation is Zhang acted in what he thought was the best interest of VIE, even though it may have conflicted
with the DEI (FU). Legally it appears he could do this, as the 10K outlines it. Now when he is required, or even if he is

required to, report it is questionable. Maybe he felt the bond was necessary and he ran with it thinking it was a better
interest rate then they could get from the bank....who knows. It will be interesting to see how US management lets this
play out. Halting it was probably a good call if it was going to take a few weeks to get all the factual docs lined up to
prove there case. If the NYSE pushed this halt then all bets are off. But from a basic look this just doesn't seem like a
straight up fraud....unless Zhang's goal was to get caught.

this is a zero. only question is when. FU symbol is perfect. 
mgmt guided to $1/sh eps for 2013 on ~20mm ave shares, but before reality bit, there was to be 40 mm shs o/s by
12/31/13 and 47 mm o/s by 3/31/14 assuming the company didn't screw up on any nyse governance hurdles. no
chance of that happening now. All 3 tranches aggregating ~27mm shares were to be converted from 290 preferred
shares. the massive 135% dilution over 7 months now looks like the least of mgmt's and shareholder's problems.
