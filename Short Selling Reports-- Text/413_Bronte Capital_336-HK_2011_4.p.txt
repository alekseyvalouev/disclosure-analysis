Huabao: derivative transactions and disclosure
Huabao - a fragrances and flavors company and the subject of attention on this blog - has suffered a
rapid stock-price decline lately. 
 
The company put out a press release related to the unusual activity in the stock. 
 
To quote: 
 


UNUSUAL PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME MOVEMENTS 


We have noted the recent decreases in the price of the shares and the significant
trading volume involved of Huabao International Holdings Limited (the “Company”).
Save as disclosed below, we are not aware of any reasons for such incidence. 


We have been recently notified by Ms. CHU Lam Yiu, the controlling shareholder of the
Company,  of her entering into a derivative transaction on 14 October 2011 relating to a
long position of a monetary value equivalent to 94,736,842 shares of the Company with
a contract period starting from 14 October 2011 to 13 January 2013...


I have a simple question: what is the "derivative transaction" that Ms. CHU Lam Yiu entered into
regarding over 94 million of her shares? 
 
In my world all derivatives can be bifurcated into a series of forwards, put options and call options.
(The bifurcation is alas not unique...) 
 
Unless I am mistaken then she has either 
 
(a) sold her shares using forwards in which case it is effectively a forward sale (she has just cashed
out and used fancy language and derivatives to obscure this fact), 
 
(b) sold the upside of her shares by selling call options or 
 
(c) protected the downside of her shares by buying put options or 
 
(d) some combination of the above. 
 
All of those are bets against her shares in some form or other. Of course I can be mistaken, but it
seems the CEO is betting against her own shares using derivatives. 
 
I am also betting against her shares - so I have something in common with her. 
 
But not much. 
 
You see I am just a guy who reads public filings. She is the controller of the company and the world's
youngest self-made female billionaire. She is a smart cookie too: took her company public via reverse
takeover, sold a chunk of shares in 2008, and again in 2009 and again recently. She is, on some lists,
the eighth richest woman in the world. 
 
And she still seems to be betting against her shares. Mostly she sells at lower prices. 
 
But whatever: I think we are entitled to know precisely the nature of the bet that the CEO has taken
against her shares. 
 
I am happy to disclose my bet: I am short. Ms. CHU Lam Yiu, it is your turn to disclose.

13 January 2013 is not an exchange-traded option expiry date. I wonder who the
counterparty is.

While the press release doesn't exactly inspire confidence, it's not completely clear to me
that "derivative transaction...relating to a long position" necessarily means an offsetting
transaction. Couldn't it mean for example that she purchased call options outright? Or
sold puts? Seems improbable but the language is not as clear as you suggest!

That's a very unclear statement, but doesn't it read as if she'd bought instead of sold via
the derivatives market? Or maybe it reads "all your base are belong to us."

Would it be too surprising if the counterparty of the trade is Huabao itself?

Clearly the derivative involves an exposure to the stock price that is short, not long, as it
is being used to explain a massive sudden *drop* in the stock price - ie, whoever is the
counterparty had to hedge the derivative by selling, not buying. Very interesting, and the
failure to provide details is super dodgy. 
 
The stock has tanked a long way already but I suspect that a substantial part of this
company's supposed business doesn't actually exist! I spoke to a fund manager today
and mentioned this to him, and it turns out that he actually met with Huabao around 3
years ago and asked to inspect their factories, and he said that there was simply nothing
there, nothing going on - they gave some kind of sketchy excuse about the factories just
happening to not be running at the time of his visit. 
 
I can't wait to see how much further this stock drops.

I wonder if you can actually cut down on a huge chunk of your own work, John, and just
short en masse stocks that company's own management is selling (straight or via
derivatives).

J, your implicit assumption is that she is has initiated an effectively short/hedged position,
which is understandable given the not so unambiguous wording used in the filing. 
 
This might help: 
Nomura Comment: We believe that the chairwoman's long position is positive for the
shares. Based on our conversations with  
management, Ms Chu chose to take a long position via derivative transactions rather than
buy shares directly because it could  
leave the chairwoman more flexibility to take a positive position on Huabao's shares in
the next 15 months. According to  
regulations, the controlling shareholder cannot increase their stake by more than 2% in
one year otherwise it would trigger a  
general offer. Note that the chairwoman already increased her stake by 0.7% in Sep
2011. However, through the derivative  
transaction, any shares of Huabao she buys won't be under her name. Based on the
terms of the derivative, Ms Chu can buy  
3% of outstanding shares in the 15 months. If based on today's closing price, she would
use at least HKD414mn. 
We believe that this means the chairwoman remains positive with regards to the
company's fundamentals.

If she things the company is in trouble, wants to retain control, then a monetization is the
best bet; a nice little forward sale, allowing here to keep notional ownership but reducing
her capital commitment. Bet you a fiver that she's done with several countparts...

"In my world all derivatives can be bifurcated into a series of forwards, put options and

Isn't that a "trifurcation"? Sorry...couldn't resist

I have to agree with the last contributor. The price action is a clear indicator of direction.
The only question is whether the transaction is a put option or a short forward. Given the
size of the price movement, I suspect that the deltas are rapidly converging and
(assuming that the put was bought "at the money") there is now effectively little difference

The puzzle for me is the identity of the cowboy who would stand on the other side of such
a transaction. They are probably not very happy at the moment.

John do you have any opinion on MUCH smaller fragrances company, which has recently

wondered about the enormous claimed returns on capital and bizarre capital allocation.
Don't know if it's good/bad/ugly.

My God I laugh at the retards thinking she might be taking long exposure. The move in

Very few.
