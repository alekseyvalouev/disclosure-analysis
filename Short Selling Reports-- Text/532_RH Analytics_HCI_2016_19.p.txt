HCI Group: 4Q15 - A Mix Of Statistical Anomalies And Humor
Mar. 7, 2016 12:11 PM ET6 comments

Summary


HCI's 4Q had several positive surprises, but we believe they are anomalies that will
disappear causing significant earnings deterioration.


Management resurrected flood again, unveiling Typtap, a new insurance company.


Discussion of Typtap focused almost exclusively on the 'coolness' factor of the app,
which in our view, is immaterial.


The business model is eroding and management appears to be attempting to find a
savoir, but we doubt flood is it.


The HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) 4Q15 results and conference call were a mixture of
statistical anomalies and humor. A number of the company's operational metrics, churn
and losses included, appear to be so low as to look like outliers. The discussion around
HCI's new flood insurer was absurd and humorous, in our view. The focus on flood
seemed designed to provide distraction from the eroding business and inject hope of a
rebound. Don't wait for the miracle. We believe financial results are about to get a lot
worse.


4Q15 churn was -1.1% using 162,000 as the ending policy count. We have records going
back to 2012, and this is the lowest churn we have ever seen at the company. It's
particularly odd given that the fourth quarter generally has high churn. As an example,
implied churn in 4Q14 was -4.6% after adjusting for the quarter's assumption.


Expect the churn anomaly to disappear next quarter. Even Mr. Patel noted that the churn
was unusual in the quarter, and stated that retention was so high that it only has one way
to go".


Losses were another positive surprise. Losses declined -$4.8M sequentially. Losses to
gross premiums earned was 21%. This compares to 27% in 3Q15 and 22.5% in 4Q14, a
quarter in which an assumption boosted margins. The figure is very low for the industry.
As a comparison, loss ratio for Heritage Insurance (NYSE:HRTG) in 4Q15 was 27% of
gross premiums earned. As the CFO said, HCI's loss ratio "continues to set the mark in
Florida". We have long considered HCI's loss ratio a mysterious industry outlier.

Despite the lack of churn and low losses, financial results were quite poor. The table
below shows our underwriting model.


HCI: 4Q15 Underwriting Model


Source: Company filings and estimates.


Despite higher gross premiums in 4Q15, underwriting income sank -22.7%. The culprits:
increased reinsurance costs and increased administrative costs. As a result, the total
expense ratio was 84% in 4Q15 versus 78% in 4Q14.


To make matters worse, investment income declined from $4.9M in 2014 to $3.9M in
4Q15. Astonishingly, this decline occurred as the investment portfolio grew from $168.8M
in 4Q14 to $233M in by the end of 2015. So, investment portfolio value increased 38%
due to contributions. Applying the investment strategy to the larger portfolio resulted in a
14% decline in income. In May of 2015, our Jack of All Trades article criticized HCI's
newly formed investment strategy. As the results show, we were right to do so. First year
results were anything but encouraging.


If that's not bad enough, it is about to get worse. South Florida was plagued by tornadoes
in 1Q15, resulting in a significant increase in losses. The table below shows our estimates
for 1Q16.


HCI: 1Q16 Underwriting Estimates

We provided a range of estimates. Those on the left use loss estimates in line with HCI's
guidance. Those on the right use losses we think are more reflective of reality. Note that
Heritage's losses will likely come in around 35% in 1Q16.


Our estimates indicate that the total expense ratio for 1Q16 will come in between 90% and
95%. As a point of comparison, in 1Q15, the total underwriting model expense ratio was
63%. Put another way, underwriting operating margins are going from 37% in 1Q15 to
5%-10% in 1Q16. This is what we call a disaster in the making.


Importantly, despite the immense margin compression, the company has not yet
experienced a hurricane. This was supposed to be a high margin business ex-hurricanes,
no?


Will flood save the day? That is another statistically improbable scenario. Firstly, it appears
as if no one, including the Office of Insurance Regulation, have any idea what they are
doing. Mr. Patel was asked what regulators think about premiums and the capitalization
for flood. He replied that he thinks "regulators are trying to come to grips with what all
these things that are going on, and that some of it is a Brave New World for everyone".


With respect to flood margins, Mr. Patel stated that they could be better than homeowners.
The questioner rightly noted that this was a departure from previous statements, and
asked what accounts for the more optimistic view. Mr. Patel responded that the analyst
should try Typtap's online application.

Lastly, when an analyst prudently enquired as to how the company thinks about,
understands and prices the risk, Mr. Patel dodged the question and said "the thing that
lets us do this is one of our other wonderful divisions, Exzeo". Again with the software.


Mr. Patel appeared to avoid speaking about the substance of the business, but focused
intently on the "cool app". If is as if pricing, underwriting, and reinsuring a peril most
consider ill-understood and improperly priced was immaterial. Really what one needs to
run a successful insurance company is a cool mobile app.


This was not a skit from Saturday Night Live. All humor was the unintended consequence
of avoiding all substantive discussion.


Conclusions


Even the positive anomalies in the quarter could not quite mask what is going on. The
underlying business at HCI is eroding. We will see that next quarter when operating
margins collapse 70% from prior year's level. And we will say it again: there still has not
been a hurricane.


The newly resurrected flood program is unlikely to stem the business decline. Rather, in
addition to providing a distraction from the sad reality of the existing business, flood looks
like another attempt to redefine the business - real estate development, hedge fund
investing, and now we are back to flood. Flood is just another Hail Mary, and not even a
new one.

Note in their conference call HRTG indicated they expected their loss ratio to increase 8-10% in Q1 due to the
tornadoes. You are estimating roughly half that increase. Is their a reason?


One might also research and note who that re-insurance (and increase in compensation) is being paid to.

Great video. What I liked most was the little geeko who briefly appears on the bottom right side looking at
Sally, shakes his head, goes tssk, tssk, then sighs, turns and walks off in disgust.

The same thing that happened for citzien takeouts might just as well happen with the NFIP flood policies (1B$ in
policies). Politicians have been pushing hard for private insurers to come back into this market and now HCI is the
first player with its TypTap platform. Rate increase of 9%+ on flood policies started last week and the consumer will be
looking for an alternative.


Once again, HCI will be able to reap all the best policies before other companies make the move into the flood
market.


State Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, got legislation passed a couple of years ago that eliminated some
regulations and made it easier for private insurers to compete with the NFIP. And U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Lakeland
Republican, has pending legislation in Congress that would make mortgage lenders more amenable to dealing with
private insurers.
