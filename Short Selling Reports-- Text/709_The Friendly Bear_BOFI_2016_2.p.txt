The Walls Are Closing In On The Branchless Bank
Apr. 14, 2016 6:51 AM ET115 comments
by: The Friendly Bear


Summary


A recent securities fraud lawsuit against BOFI in a Federal District Court shows that
many more former BOFI employees have come forward to share stories of fraud at
the company.


Almost one dozen former employees tell a tale of Salvadoran gambling gangs,
felonious executives, opaque Venezuelan trusts, corrupt appraisals, CEO check
forgery, and falsified audits.


Multiple formers claim BOFI regularly and potentially inappropriately used an
appraiser named Brendan Flynn who reportedly has personal ties to the Chief Credit
Officer.


BOFI's CEO already alluded to this lawsuit on the last earnings call - the company
was clearly aware that more formers had stepped forward to expose suspected
wrongdoing.


The smoke from last October is turning into fire and we reiterate our belief that this
companyâ€™s eventual demise will come as a result of government intervention.


A record 70 days have now passed since the last BofI Holding (NASDAQ:BOFI) article
was published on Seeking Alpha, leaving small cap stock prognosticators across the
country baffled. "Are the shorts running out of material?" "Is the Friendly Bear in
hibernation?" "Did Aurelius return to Rome?" "Does Real Talk Investments really wear a
bathrobe while writing his reports?"


Based on our projections, we think that BOFI was on course to see slippage in its industry
leading efficiency ratio as a result of crossing the key "days without a short report"
threshold. Rumor has it that management promised all BOFI employees a company-wide
cupcake celebration if a whole quarter went by without a short report.

After reviewing the recently filed case of Houston Municipal Employees Pension System v
BofI Holding (amended on April 11th, 2016), it is clear that a whole host of new issues
have emerged. A chorus of former BOFI employees have stepped forward and outlined
numerous new fraud allegations against BOFI. It is worth remembering that investigations
take time. The lawyers representing the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System
took months to develop their case and probe their witnesses - and they are backed by
robust resources, financial motivation, and a lack of due process burden (versus the
government that inevitably must move very carefully and deliberately).


We believe in the doctrine of the presumption of innocence until being found guilty, but
note that these new allegations (from former employees, NOT short sellers) continue to
suggest something is horribly wrong at this company and that the company's legal woes
are only just beginning.


So far, bulls have taken comfort in thinking that only one employee has stepped
forward and alleged wrongdoing at BOFI. However, the recent filing in Houston
Municipal Employees Pension System v. BofI Holding suggests that almost one
dozen other former BOFI employees have provided investigators with mounds of
evidence against BOFI.

We take a deep dive into the lawsuit below, but wanted to give readers a quick summary
of the case's contents below:


Source: Case No. 3:15-cv-02324-GPC-KSC, April 11  2016 filing


The case is riveting and we encourage readers to go through it in detail. Allegations from
former employees combine the money laundering sex appeal of the Panama Papers, the
grow at any cost mantra of Enron, a culture of sweeping wrongdoing under the rug, the
appraisal fraud dynamics made famous by Indymac, and a loan book overseen by a
convicted felon whose employment at the bank was hidden from bank examiners.


Some of the loans formers discuss include a loan tied to a Salvadoran gambling gang and
one to a Venezuelan trust where underlying borrower information was (according to the
case) never verified for the purposes of OFAC (which if true is a crime).


Formers also tell stories of being strong-armed by BOFI's Chief Credit Officer to originate
paper of dubious quality - including to unverified foreign nationals and borrowers
who were unable to demonstrate their ability to repay borrowings.


But most noteworthy is the frequent mention of an appraiser named Brendan Flynn who
appears to dominate market share of BOFI loan appraisals. One former claims that
Mr. Flynn is a friend of BOFI Chief Credit Officer Thomas Constantine, and numerous
formers called the relationship between BOFI and this appraiser into question. One also
questioned the merits and veracity of Flynn's appraisals.

If their claims are even remotely accurate, the entire foundation of BOFI's financial
statements may be based on fraud, as the strongest argument bulls have are BOFI's
supposedly low LTVs - which experienced bank investors will know are only as good as
the quality of BOFI's appraisals.


We conducted an AppraiserUSA search on the individual named Brendan Flynn and
found that an individual going by the same name has a record of being registered with
FINRA. We found that the individual corresponding to that FINRA record previously went
by a different name - specifically, according to records, he previously went by the
name Brendan Matthew Gilbert.


We note that the FINRA registered individual named Brendan Matthew Flynn (who lists an
alternate name of Brendan Matthew Gilbert), also lists himself in his FINRA profile as the
President of The Flynn Group (also based in Long Beach, CA) - matching employment
records related to the Brendan Flynn we found on AppraiserUSA and matching the name
of the firm identified in the Houston lawsuit (The Flynn Group):

We leave readers with the opportunity to conduct their own due diligence into Mr. Brendan
Flynn, Mr. Brendan Gilbert, and The Flynn Group. We also encourage investors to ask
BOFI whether or not it is true that the company was providing a disproportionate market
share of its nationwide appraisals to an individual based in Long Beach.


Finally, we decided to take a pause for comic relief and explore one of the most odd yet
talked about themes that surfaced in the lawsuit - the theme of forgery at BOFI:

Conclusion - Not One, Not Two, Not Three...


We take readers back to a cryptic comment made on the most recent BOFI earnings call
that was now (with the benefit of hindsight) apparently an allusion to the recently filed
Houston case against BOFI:


A variety of what appears to be short-seller funded attorneys and short-seller funded
investigators have continued to call and harass our former employees. Although we
have good relationships with the vast majority of our ex-employees, it is possible and
perhaps even anticipated that other baseless lawsuits might be filed by the same or
different attorney in what will be a futile attempt to pressure us. This will not change
the bank's sound policy of terminating poor-performing employees. BofI is not in the
business of settling meritless lawsuits. So we will ride out the temporary storm while
focusing on continuing to grow our business in a safe and sound manner and deliver
positive earnings growth.


As usual, Garrabrants blamed all of his upcoming legal woes on short sellers and
"disgruntled" former employees.


This excerpt straight from the plaintiff securities fraud court document proves that short
sellers had nothing to do with the Houston v. BOFI case.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3965195-walls-closing-branchless-bank 9/34


Our short seller spideysense has been active ever since the cryptic earnings call
commentary by Garrabrants. We wondered - what in the world could he be so concerned
over? We believe that we now know the answer to that question. We also now understand
why the company has gone to such extreme measures over the past few months without
explaining their rationale to investors.


Since late last year, BOFI has undertaken a series of extreme measures, summarized
below:


BOFI assaulted the 1st amendment and unsuccessfully sued Seeking Alpha to
compel the identities of the bloggers writing about the company, putting itself in a
unique class of companies that have sued Seeking Alpha unsuccessfully, including
NanoViricides (NYSEMKT:NNVC) and Chinese RTOs
In an about face and in a move highly uncharacteristic of a "growth" company, BOFI
raised debt with the intention to buy back stock - why in the world would BOFI buy
back stock when the company supposedly has so many exciting growth
avenues in front of it? Why not use the capital to grow loans? We are sure there are
some Panama Papers borrowers who are looking to get easy credit in these trying
times for money launderersâ€¦
BOFI announced that Dentons LLP had given the company the all clear following an
investigation into Erhart's claims. The mysterious thing about this announcement is
that BOFI NEVER ONCE disclosed to the public that it had even hired Dentons
LLP to conduct a third party investigationâ€¦ in fact, the company in multiple

instances denied that it even needed to have a 3  party firm look into Erhart's
claims
It is even more troubling that BOFI never disclosed that Dentons LLP recently acquired
McKenna, Long & Aldridge, the firm that represented BOFI on the H&R Block deal,
throwing into question whether Dentons was an appropriately impartial group to handle
this type of investigation in the first place (hint: we doubt it)
BOFI bought a low quality furniture and fixture leasing business from PacWest while
simultaneously burying negative information relating to the upcoming quarter's results
in the pre-recorded earnings call that was broadcast at a time when no one was paying
attention
BOFI had Craig Hallum (a firm that should be well known to short sellers) initiate on
the stock with a comical price target only days before the Houston lawsuit was filed


Therefore, combined with the CEO's comments from the last earnings call and the recent
fact pattern of odd behavior, it appears that BOFI was preparing for this lawsuit given how
poorly it reads.


Based on the Houston case, it also appears that Erhart is not the only former employee of
BOFI who believes that the company has engaged in fraud.


It's also one thing to say you have one former disgruntled employee. When almost one
dozen were willing to step forward and speak with investigators and recount stories of
fraud, it seems apparent to us that the issues at BOFI are more likely systemic than one-
off. Given the culture described in the lawsuit, just think about how many formers were too
scared to talk to investigators...


In summary, if there is one thing to take away from this report it is simple. Almost one
dozen former employees interviewed by investigators have now made serious
allegations against BOFI.


Not one.


Not two.


Not threeâ€¦

Hmm this just sounds like you are getting burned on your short positions after the huge run up. The lawsuit update
was filled 3 days ago and no serious analyst even thought of it to be of material impact. You are just making
predictions out of thin air (Panama papers? Culture of fraud? Wtf?). It may be the case, but there is definitely little
facts to support your claims at this moment. No regulator has come after the investigation and said anything about it.
In fact they have given the green light several times while short articles are posted as soon as any good news come
out

Are you implying that Craig Hallum is a "serious" (do you mean reputable?) analyst? Or that any of the other
analysts covering this stock have a reputation for "serious" coverage?


Are you also implying that the Friendly Bear isn't "serious/reputable"? Have you looked at his track-record?
It's outstanding...please go confirm.


How do you not find the Brendan Flynn stories deeply troubling? There is at least a probability greater than
zero that a high percentage of the purported LTVs are a complete farce.

I don't own BOFI stock. I have a lot of money there because they pay 1.25% on checking and pay atm fees. I
care if the company is solid or not, not what the stock is doing.


I'd like to know how legit the info. in this article is because I don't have the time to fact check it myself.

Wait, you're legitimately thinking about moving banks because of what a random person on the internet said?


Why don't you use a little bit more....trustworthy source for how secure your money at Bank Of Internet is.
And, this is all the fact checking you need.

The above link takes you to the FDIC website which will calculate your coverage in the event of a bank
collapse. Fwiw, Bank of Internet deposits are FDIC insured....which should tell you all you need to know
regarding how secure BOFI is. SMH, some people get frightened so easily.

How are you going to know the bank is in trouble? All their financials are immaculate. They're insured by the
FDIC. They're paying 1.25% on deposit accounts, as you noted.


There's a mountain of evidence of everything is fine. Then there's this article.


It's your money, by all means, if you don't trust the FDIC or management or whatever it is, move it. I was just
trying to point out that your money is not at risk at bofi and if you chose it, like I did, because it's the best
return on a '6 month nest egg' with no risk, then I don't know why you would now change unless you found a
better place to bank.

I can say this for sure. BOFI is hastily buying back its own shares like mad today in their repurchase program.
Old news the Lawsuit was filed like last November. Not a single action by the Federal Bank Regulators to
date has been issued. Very Odd indeed! That is if this article holds water! The only new thing to report in the
article is "allegations" by a dozen or so more people with accusations. Factual Maybe but not in print
anywhere else but this article. Nothing really here but interesting reading at this point.

Farce is what this article is indeed. The author speaks of the Lawsuit like it was filed yesterday when in fact
it's a Fall 2015 filing near 6 months old. I cannot believe the time and effort it took to put such BS together and

The lawsuit that forms the pretense for this column is quite remarkable. It repeatedly substantiates its factual
claims by footnoting SA "articles" written by "Aurelius"! Needless to say those (for-pay) contributions on SA
have no evidential value in a court. Many of the remaining allegations depend on the interpretation of the law
advanced by two individuals who once worked at the firm.


The lost market cap of the last few days will return as investors who take the time to read the lawsuit confirm
the flimsiness of its supporting evidence for themselves. Of course, no one can predict when that will happen.
And so timing the market will be difficult. Moreover, the stock's past tendency to increase 10% in a day will be
compounded going forward by the fact that its Board recently acquired a $100 million war chest for buy-
backs.


Some (like me) will conclude that it is simpler not to try to time things and just stick with the stock given its
superior relative valuation. If the upcoming earning's report is suspect then that conclusion is also suspect
and I will revisit it.

Since the documents were filed, 3 days ago, BOFI's stock surged with high volume. This is what investors really think
about these meritless claims. Trial didn't even start but short sellers are trying to convince you that all is bad. This is
despite the fact that the bank was thoroughly examined by regulators that didn't find ANY wrongdoings

Anyone can file a lawsuit so it has absolutely credibility at this point in time. My problem with the article is there is
nothing of substance that would even register as worth disclosing by the company. Further the author is grasping at
straws by trying to bring the Panama Papers into the story. There is not on word of evidence presented to make
claims like this.


I think the article really damages the credibility of the writer and clearly demonstrates how desperate one can get
when getting bone crushed in a short.

Short interest is already coming down from it's high. Yes, BOFI had some bad employees who have been fired. This
happens to fast growing companies. Management has proactively reached out to regulators to manage the issue.
BOFI may have to pay a fine, and then they can move on. I have talked to several clients of BOFI who say
outstanding things about the bank. Oh, and Craig Hallum is one of the most honest and credible small cap ibanks in
the US, though they have made their share of bad research calls. I think you should cover your short. Long BOFI.

5/23/2018 The Walls Are Closing In On The Branchless Bank - BofI Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ:BOFI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3965195-walls-closing-branchless-bank 17/34


think your readers are. 
(2) Big money is a stake. The shorts are short 24M shares*$21 = $1/2 Billion dollars. 
They loose $24 million in a single day (like yesterday). Are shorts willing to pay 12 ex-employees $500,000 each
(more than 5 years their prior salary) to put their name on a lawsuit? You bet. $6 Million is peanuts in this game. If the
stock goes to just $31 (the current fair value estimate) they loose 40x that amount. They need to slow this puppy
down - and buy themselves some time to get out. Your commission for this hit piece is money very well spent for
them. 
(3) I read the handpicked "juicy" bits very slowly and carefully. I am not a lawyer, but I have a Ph.D. from Stanford and
decent reading comprehension. I am not particularly impressed with the accusation being leveled or their level of
criminality. No worker or human is 100% happy all the time. I can imagine what the other side of this ("he said - she
said") argument looks like, and I can imagine what I would do as the judge or jury. The worst case possible outcome I
can envisage from those complaints happens only in 3-5 years time, when the company is earning $4 to $6 per share,
and results a hand slap and zero impact on business operations. 
(4) Clearly yet another attempt to manipulate the short term share price - not an unbiased information service for the
general public. These articles have less and less impact every time you guys do it. But I guess you have to make a
living and the shorts have to try and make theirs. Manipulation of retail stock holders - I guess its a living. Even if it is
pretty slimy.

"They loose $24 million in a single day...."


If you were so smart, you'd have learnt to spell the word "lose" in the second grade.

ad (1) I frankly don't care who's funding this. Who sues someone else always has a motive. Disgruntled
employees just like short-sellers. The only thing that matters is what is true about it. 
ad (2) Big money is at stake for shareholders as well. I know shortsellers are unpopular (particularly with
many shareholders). I see them more like scavengers - maybe it's not appetizing, but it's useful. Either they're
wrong - your opportunity to 'back up the truck' and get in below fair value. Or they are right and save you from
losing a lot of money. So rather than taking it as a personal insult to your investing thesis, I'd think it prudent
to vet the allegations. 
ad (3) I'm also not a lawyer, but if only a fraction of the alleged practices are true, then regardless of whether
they are criminal or not, it's not the sort of behaviour that I think ethical, good business behaviour or simply
what I want to be associated with. Least of all with my money.

Maybe I'm too gullible, buying into these allegations. But I've seen and read enough to make me sell my
shares. Not short it - that would take a LOT of conviction. If I had that conviction, I would have no qualms
about shorting either. To me it's ridiculous to think buying low then selling high is somehow more ethical than
doing it in reverse order. Either way you try to be smarter than the market. But I think there are plenty other
companies on the market where there is less to worry about.

Les, 
(1) Motive matters. Especially when judging the veracity of a source. 
(2) The point isn't that big money is at stake (on both sides of course). The point is that short term price
movement might be the result of big money (options contracts) - not because there is actually any truth to
short hit pieces. They are timed together for a reason. 
(3) Your opinions seem to be easily manipulated. Everything (particularly in court cases) has some element of
truth to it. The only real question is how much truth. And if you read one side of a court complaint and take it
at face value that is stunningly poor due diligence. 
(4) I have no problems with shorting. I do it. I have problems with collaborative manipulation. This breaks the
price finding mechanism of markets and makes them useless/unfair. Everyone is correct to be annoyed when
it is allowed to happen. 
(5) There are actually very few companies out there that have the potential to increase their market cap by
10x in 10 years. Reward goes with risk. If you wanted a tame return you should never have ever been in this
stock to begin with. Best for all that you, and your weak convictions, are gone.

Friendly Bear, 
The HOUSTON MUN. EMP. PENSION SYSTEM v. BofI Holdings lawsuit was filed on October 15th, 2015. That is six
months ago. You speak of this as though you just uncovered something.


Would you agree that a simple question deserves a simple answer? If so, here is a simple question which I bet you
choose not to answer:


Do you own any BOFI Puts with an April 15, 2016 expiration?

Considering the large "institutional ownership to shares short ratio" (50%), I surmise the incentives to lend shares by
the institutions are high. I surmise the costs to short are close to 10%. Also considering the ATM May options trade at
around 10% of the strike.

les2005
great article, and I love the reactions of the diehard believers. I don't short companies because it's too risky, plus time
is working against you. But boy, if ever there was a tempting case for a short it is this one.  
So many investors will filter news by whether it fits to their investment thesis - good luck to those. How much more
evidence do you need that something is deeply wrong at this company? Unfortunately, with valuation of loans playing
such a big role and at the same time being impossible to verify for outside investors, BOFI could go on for a long time
pretending everything is fine. So it all comes down to trust. I just fail to understand how anyone can still trust BOFI.


14 Apr 2016, 11:09 AM


Eric Przybylski, Contributor
Les2005, 
There is a big difference between "evidence" and "allegations."


Evidence against BOFI is nonexistent, and strengthened by the OCC go-ahead before the HR Block
transaction.


Allegations, though, are abundant. The law firm behind this case is called "Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann, and
Bernstein." They are an ambulance-chasing firm; they file a class-action suit every three to four days. Google
the firm name, every three/four days. As a practice they always demand a jury trial. The firm announced a
class-action suit against Bank of Internet TWO DAYS after the New York Times article on October 13th, 2015.

You want to know how many jury trials have actually been tried to a jury by this firm....


Two.


(Here's a link to their website: http://bit.ly/1SO7luH)


I'll be writing a rebuttal to this hatchet piece in the next couple days, just as I did with the Erhart lawsuit
(here's my rebuttal: http://seekingalpha.co...)


The only lie here is not of BofI, it's of the author of this article. He says "recently filed," but this was filed last
October.


The real problem is that nobody ever bothers to get all the facts. I do. There's nothing to see here except a
propogation of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.


And yeah, as the author purports, only a fraudulent company would buy back it's own stock---because that
makes sense....

The failure thesis, reiterated above, is becoming ever more strained. In the past, it has turned on the claim (first made
about two years ago) that regulatory intervention is imminent. That was prior to Bofi's acquisition of the H&R Block
unit and the enhance regulatory scrutiny that transaction implied. At present, it seems to be premised on the claim
that the above-mentioned lawsuit will succeed. It must be emphasized that even if that action did succeed it might
invite a fine. A fine will not put the company out of business. Nor will it affect the company's phenomenal rate of
growth.


I remain Bullish on Bofi.


14 Apr 2016, 11:09 AM


Christopher Wallace, Contributor
This article was well written as an entertaining read.


I enjoyed it for its sarcasm and humorous tone. Of course, it completely fails as an investment article because it only
provides the plaintiff's allegations. No due is given to the potential defenses BofI may have. The only substantiated
claim here is that another 12 people did come forward. While not conclusive, it is worrisome. I do not know whether
their allegations will ultimately be proven in court or whether they will become discredited along the lines of Erhart's.
But then neither does the author or anyone else. I have no position and won't take one until I can read a balanced
article on the subject. Not too likely for this battleground stock.

The law firm of Dentons US LLP to conduct an independent investigation to determine whether there is support for the
factual allegations and the conclusions contained in the Complaint. After an extensive investigation, Dentons advised
the Audit Committee that, based on its investigation, it found no support for the conclusions of Mr. Erhart in the
Complaint that the Bank or management engaged in wrongdoing or acts of fraud or impropriety. 
I believed in the independent audits because they are hold accountable by law. Other can make any accusation as

The SEC requires all public corporations to hire audit firms to give out reports. Their reports have to be

I have supervised the hiring of an independent auditor (CPA firm) to audit the financials and the controls at my

Wez, 
This was all voluntary. BOFI could have not hired anyone nor done any internal investigation. Would that be
preferable?


BOFI cannot force the SEC, OCC or CFPB to investigate their company. And, given that this suit (or Erhart's
suit) will never reach the lights of a courtroom, we can safely assume a plaintiff's investigation will never
occur, either.


Let us be very clear. There is no evidence. There are only unsubstantiated claims--the vast majority of which,
even if true, would result in no or limited damages.


BOFI and Garrabrants, at every turn, have done everything to clear the air and cooperate. Filing 8-K's,
holding public address calls, disclosing this suit in their SEC filings, what more can you ask of a company?


The real you should ask yourself is,


"Why do I place a greater faith in the claims of anonymous bloggers and a lawsuit that provides no evidence
than in the company who has, by every account, undergone numerous audits and investigations and passed
consistently with flying colors."


It smacks of paranoia, motivation, delusion, or all of the above.

Maybe it's just my own paranoia creeping up, but the sentence, "So the law firm, hired by the board, came to
that conclusion" sure seems, to me at least, to infer that the law firm's report is not to be relied upon because
the law firm was hired by the board.


I guess I'll leave it at that.

If you had lodged a complaint against a company and that company hired a law firm to investigate that
complaint and the results dismissed your complaint entirely, would you be satisfied?


There are two sides to every story and you seem to think the story is over based on the response from one
side.


15 Apr 2016, 12:20 PM


Eric Przybylski, Contributor
"Would I be satisfied?"


Certainly not. If I felt my complaint valid, and the damages justifiable, I would be forced to enlist counsel to
lodge an investigation on my behalf and my expense. Or, in this case, file a formal complaint with a regulatory
body and ask for their intervention. Sort of like how Matt Erhart contacted the OCC, who did dismiss the
charges. Suggest you read Erhart's lawsuit which says as much.


"You seem to think the story is over based on the response from one side."


Believe me, not a thread of my being thinks this story is over.

You implied it in your statement - "I have supervised the hiring of an independent auditor (CPA firm) to audit
the financials and the controls at my investment firm. Believe me, it was a friendly affair." Implicit in this
statement, is that the auditor would look favorably on a client's maleficence because they needed the work. I
beg to differ, no matter how friendly the negotiations to hire the auditor may be, the money derived from the
client, pales in comparison to the litigation risk in rendering a "friendly" opinion no matter how friendly the
negotiations and what the client might prefer. You may have hired auditors, but doubt is you ever had to
explain problems they discover with financial statement review...trust me they do not ignore bad internal

No, it's not implicit. Of course finding malfeasance would warrant action. It's the finding of malfeasance, that
often takes a very deep dive, partially based on who is hiring them.

If you are curious, these are the guys who are the front for the shorts, and who just destroyed  
wealth worth 1000 times their purported loss (which would not be a loss at all anyway - if they didn't front for the
shorts).


"Class members and movants Houston Municipal Employees Pension System ("HMEPS"), John Marco, and Steven
Golden, assert that HMEPS has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class: HMEPS claims losses of
approximately $215,340.52, Marco claims losses of approximately $105,381.51, Golden claims losses of
approximately $6,529.00, and non-moving class member Multicultural Business Solutions Inc. claims losses of
approximately $46,148.60. Golden v. BofI Holding, Inc., No. 3:15-cv-02324-GPC-KSC, ECF No. 17 at 2. This claim
being undisputed, the Court finds that HMEPS is the class member with the largest financial interest in the relief
sought by the class."


This is from January 29th by the way. NOT April 11th. 
Not new news. And the original case by HMEPS dates from October 15th (when the slimesters were advertising for
idiots to front their case).

I would encourage everybody to buy more shares Monday morning. BOFI! is a great deal. And I hope that somebody
goes to jail for manipulating markets. Because this is so wrong. taking an old case and making it sound like it just
happened to help push prices down? That's shameful. And should be illegal.

I'm holding many shares at 18.53 avg. I can't explain such a massive drop without taking into consideration the timing
of this report, options expirations and the massive short interest.


I'm gonna hold this out because I feel the company will defend itself against these lawsuits successfully. The company
should report decent earnings. I also have a feeling that some manipulation was done in the past two days to take this
to the downside. Was it options or short selling? I don't know for sure. I hope it wasn't a shakeout of institutional
selling.


I'm expecting this to rebound to near term 19. I'll avg down only so much and will look for a price target of 25 for 2016
unless the broader market turns South. This company has the fundamentals to outperform the market.

They beat earnings expectations the last 4 straight quarters. I wouldn't bet against them.

Even if they beat, the stock probably tanks. This is the most manipulated stock on the market. Don't mess
with the market manipulators.

1. BofI Holding short report brings up old issues, says Keefe Bruyette 
Keefe Bruyette analysts led by Julianna Balicka said a Seeking Alpha short report brings up similar issues that have
been around since October, presenting them in new ways. The analyst said the article timing coincides with option
expiration dates and specifically options from October. Balicka's view of the company is unchanged and said
regulators have favorably reviewed the bank, and management has answered questions about its practices. The
analyst rates BofI Holding an Outperform with a $25 price target on shares.

BofI Holding short report mostly a rehash, says Craig-Hallum 
Craig-Hallum analyst Brad Berning said yesterday's Seeking Alpha short report discussing Bofl Holding's recent
amended shareholder lawsuit is mostly a rehash of prior allegations from the Erhart lawsuit. The analyst points out
that Erhart's own lawsuit admits that regulators have not granted merit to his allegations. Berning said the lawsuit is a
near-term overhang and it will take time for the fiscal year-end audit to clear the air. The analyst reiterates his Buy
rating and $35 price target on Bofl Holding.

Dozens of comments on here are being deleted, most for no reason at all. Very shady SA. If a post doesn't break the
rules, stop deleting it.

How much time did the legal team spend on crafting that one? I guess they are a lot of ill-mannered execs
over there LOL.


You think the big guys over in Ohio got an early look at the press release? Stock was certainly driftin' well
before 11:30am ET.


And my favorite song is Allejandro by Lady Gaga. Bonus points if you can 'investig8' why!!!

"...short-seller hit pieces designed to manipulate the market in a veiled effort to benefit themselves at the
expense of BofIâ€™s shareholders..."


http://yhoo.it/1SNWFMm


Wow, that's quite a bit stronger than my Comment about the Original Post a couple of days ago. It was
Deleted, because I didn't include reasons for my opinion. I'm sorry, but, after I had read the original Post (and
ALL the Comments) I thought my conclusion was pretty self evident.


In the piece Linked above the Company repudiates the negatives in the Original Post. I believe this was all
addressed in the Comments to the Original Post. Now the Company confirms it. Great reading!

There is nothing at all wrong with writing negative articles on companies. I have done it myself. What is clearly very
wrong is to write those articles in such a way as to omit or distort facts. This article reflects poorly on SA as it does not
meet an even moderate standard of journalistic rigor. This would not have got past the editors at any mainstream
financial publication. The failure to report the lawsuit was filed several months ago and to create the impression that it
was a recent filing would have spiked the article right there. Errors and omissions are a part of journalism and editing,
but this one goes beyond the norm and both the author and the editors at SA should rightly feel the embarrassment of
having failed their readers in this case.

When they delete my comments, they send me an email saying they want "Seeking Alpha to be the go-to
destination for serious investment discussion" and comments need to adhere to the guidelines.


I wish they scrutinized the articles they publish half as much as the scrutinize my comments. I've really lost
faith in SA for allowing this article.

BofI Investor
On April 15th, I submitted a FOIA request to the SEC for any documents relating to investigations of or criminal or
administrative proceedings against BofI Holding, Inc. Today, April 19th, I received a response, which is quoted below
in pertinent part. Thus, it seems clear that the SEC is not investigating BofI, which should assuage investors concerns
to some extent; I can make no claims about other governmental agencies. The only reason I'm not providing a link to
the actual document is that I have no idea how to do so; I have never used dropbox and do not plan to start now.


------------


Dear [Mr. X]


This letter is in response to your request, dated and 
received in this office on April 15, 2016, for any documents 
relating to investigations of or criminal or administrative 
proceedings against Bofl Holding, Inc.


Based on the information you provided in your letter, we 
conducted a thorough search of the SECâ€™s various systems of 
records, but did not locate or identify any information 
responsive to your request.


If you still have reason to believe that the SEC maintains 
the type of information you seek, please provide us with 
additional information, which could prompt another search. 
Otherwise, we conclude that no responsive information exists and 
we consider this request to be closed.

stockmarketguy2003
did you appeal the foia? it is highly unlikely that a shareholder action is filed without some sort of probe, even
if benign.


not that it matters, this company would never disclose an SEC probe. they've backed themselves too far into
a corner now by claiming nothing is wrong. if they disclose a probe, stock is going down 50%. will be good fun
and games when they finally get pressure to potential probes.


disclosure: short

BofI Investor
The SEC has indicated that they have no responsive documents. Are you accusing them of lying? If not, why
would you suggest that should I doubt their statements? I note that it is irrelevant whether the company would
disclose a probe by the SEC; the FOIA request was for a particular government agency to disclose any
information relating to a probe. Nonetheless, you blindly assert that BOFI would not disclose the existence of
an SEC probe. Can you point to any impartial evidence that supports your view?

Since my last comment got deleted, I'll try again.


BOFI investors may be interested in the situation that has gone on with the most recent article published on SA about
Intrexon (XON). There are interesting similarities in what has occurred the last few days between BOFI & XON and an
author who has published reports on both stocks.


Is this comment public friendly SA?

Bofi reminds me of Questcor. It was constantly under attack by short sellers but eventually they lost their credibility
and stock didn't react to any FUD articles.


Now is time to buy!

Curious how the bottom dweller will justify the ER report. Again not sure why SA is allowing him to use their venue to
carry on a practice of misinformation to line his pocket to the detriment of the less informed. I short sell occasionally,
but this dude leaves a slimy sheen on the practice of short selling.

From the earnings call transcript:


On April 11, 2016, the strike suit lawyers filed an amendment to the existing class action filed against the company on
October 15, 2016. The strike suit lawyersâ€™ revised complaint is riddled with numerous misrepresentations, outright
fabrications, factual inaccuracies, out of context statements and mistake in application of regulatory guidance and law.
We will address the multitudinous deficiencies with this frivolous lawsuit in court.


The amended complaint is unimpressive as legal work, but had some share price impact when incorporated into a
short seller headpiece timed around the [indiscernible] expiration deadline. Despite the capital markets impact, thereâ€™s
been no impact on the performance of the business as todayâ€™s outstanding results and our growth plans demonstrate.
The bank is in a strong regulatory standing, with no enforcement actions, has not been fined a single dollar by any
regulatory agency and has not been required to modify its products or business practices.


Also, see page 14 for clear up of the appraiser issue.

From the Conference call; by:


Gregory Garrabrants


So there was this comment about one of the appraisal management companies we use, so yes, the gentleman that
was mentioned and incorrectly stated as having done the majority of our appraisals or some drivel like that, thatâ€™s not
close to being correct. We use appraisal management companies to perform our appraisals. After those appraisals,
management companies perform the appraisal. The appraisal was subject to a review by another qualified appraiser
who reviews that appraiserâ€™s work.


And in the case of the Flynn Group, the Flynn Group is a group. He does appraisals on his own. He has appraisers
who work for him and he has a software that gives him access to thousands of appraisers. He is well known in the
market as an incredibly conservative appraiser and the appraisals that were mentioned in that frivolous suit are
demonstrative.


Iâ€™m not going to give out confidential information, but it is public information that that property that they were quibbling
about the appraisal value their input in the lawsuit sold for $33 million and you can look that up. So that was I guess
not within 18 months of an appraisal that was 60% lower than that value. And then the other property sold within 18
months for about 40% more than that allegedly high appraisal that was made.


Our appraisal management practices are very strong. Thereâ€™s nothing unusual about our practices. In many cases,
banks have their own appraisal panels, where appraisers actually are employees of the bank. That would be the way
Chase performs their multifamily appraisals using their own employees.


So in this case, itâ€™s just an appraisal management firm. We use a different appraisal management firm for single family
and thatâ€™s just â€“ and I would be cautious in assuming that even if something is in that lawsuit that that is actually what
someone actually said. I just think Iâ€™m not going to say more than that, except to say that when I said the statement

about it being riddled with fabrications and consistencies et cetera that was an understatement of just how inaccurate
that is. Those stories are complete fabrications and leave out so many facts that render them to be complete, render
the reader to have a completely different impression of those transactions than they otherwise would have.


And Iâ€™d also note that if the best youâ€™ve got after harassing our employees for all this time is that youâ€™re picking on a
property thatâ€™s sold for 40% more than what they are arguing was what the value was and then another one that sold
for the $33 million where they gave out the borrowerâ€™s address that isnâ€™t itself demonstrative of the credit quality that
we have if you needed further evidence of that by obviously all the charge off ratios and all that stuff. So no, thereâ€™s
nothing unusual about any of that
