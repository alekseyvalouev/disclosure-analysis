NAII


Patent RE45,947 is a reissue patent that does not meaningfully improve NAII's
patent portfolio.


The press release was announced April 15th, 17 days after the patent approval.


Strangely timed press release could relate to Japanese earthquake where their
beta-alanine (CarnoSyn) supplier(s) are located.

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NAII
On Friday, April 15th after the market close, Natural Alternatives International, Inc.
(NASDAQ:NASDAQ:NAII) issued a press release titled "Natural Alternatives
International Issued New U.S. Beta-alanine Patent." Including the title, the press release
describes patent RE45,947 as a "new patent" three times (to be fair, they do describe it
as "newly reissued" once in the press release). Truly new patents have a term of
between 14-20 years depending on the type of patent (design vs. utility). While
technically new, the RE45,947 patent does not appear to extend the term of NAII's
patent portfolio and therefore we find it misleading to describe it as new. This new patent
simply replaces an old patent, specifically patent 6,426,361 ('361).


What's going on here? The "RE" of patent RE45,947 stands for REISSUED. According
to the USPTO, patents are reissued "whenever any patent is, through error, deemed
wholly or partly inoperative or invalid, by reason of a defective specification or
drawing." The USPTO further states that "no new matter shall be introduced in the
application for reissue," "no reissued patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the
claims of the original patent," and that the reissued patent term is only for "the
unexpired part of the original patent." It appears NAII may have discovered a
problem with patent '361 and decided to have it reissued as a fix. However, the fix
appears to be very short term.


Patent '361 was originally issued on July 30th, 2002. Additionally, patent '361 is a
continuation patent. Continuation patents do not automatically receive a 20-year term. A
continuation patent is a patent that relies on a parent patent. The continuation patent
expires when the parent patent expires. The parent patent in this case appears to be
patent 5,965,596 filed on August 12, 1997. This makes sense because in NAII's recent
10-K, they have stated that 25 of their 34 patents expire in 2017 (20 years after '97).
Therefore, we conclude the reissued patent, patent RE45,947 that NAII describes as
"new" will expire next year, along with most of their other patents.


Additionally, correcting a patent that was assumed by the investment community to be
valid does not improve one's patent portfolio. This is important to recognize. The reissue
corrected the '361 patent, a patent that investors didn't realize needed any correcting to
begin with. NAII then puts out a strangely timed press release lauding the "new" patent
as an improvement of their patent portfolio when in reality, they were simply fixing
something that originally had been screwed up.

The timing of the press release is of note because this wasn't exactly new news. It came
17 days after the initial reissuance of the patent on March 29th. NAII should have known
this news for over two weeks (we were well aware of it before the press release) but
strangely, they release it one day after the 6.4 magnitude earthquake and the day of the
7.0 magnitude "aftershock" that followed.


In 2011, the Sendai earthquake, which caused a devastating tsunami impacted their
ability to secure beta-alanine supply, the key ingredient to CarnoSyn. CarnoSyn is 20%
of sales for NAII and has been a large part of their earnings improvement over the past
year. It is unclear if recent events have impacted their ability to secure beta-alanine
supplies but we take note of the odd timing of this press release.


Perhaps it's all just a big coincidence. We feel the press release was nothing more than
"fluff." This strengthens our conviction that NAII's patent portfolio may actually be much
weaker than they would like it to be.
