China Medical Likely Headed For Bankruptcy
May 31, 2012 9:29 AM ET46 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


We think the end is near for China Medical Technologies (CMEDY), and that the gears are
in motion for bondholders to file the company for an involuntary bankruptcy, in order to
pursue the company's assets in China and try to achieve some sort of limited recovery for
creditors. Given the lack of communications from the company since the missed coupon
payments beginning in December 2011, bondholders have likely seen that negotiations
are unlikely to bear fruit, and are therefore probably preparing a filing. My discussions with
bondholders and research analysts indicate a lack of progress as well.


It has been nearly six months since the company first missed its coupon payment on
December 15, 2011. It then missed another coupon payment on February 15, 2012. To
date, the company has not filed an 6-K explaining why it missed its coupon payments. In
fact, the company has not issued any 6-K filings or other relevant notices since its first
missed payments. It did not inform investors when its independent director, Lawrence
Crum, resigned. It did not inform investors when the stock was halted by NASDAQ, or de-
listed to the pink sheets. It did not even appeal NASDAQ's decision to de-list the stock,
unlike many other U.S.-listed Chinese companies that have seen their stocks halted.


The company has not filed a quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, and has not
provided any explanation for why it has not done so. Naturally, we're highly skeptical that
the company will file a 20-F by its July 31st deadline, or will be able to pass its audit.


Standing ahead of the equity are $413 million face value of convertible notes (see here).
When including accrued interest, the face value of notes is worth more than $420 million.
If a theoretical restructuring were to occur, the bonds would have to be paid out at par plus
accrued and default interest before equity holders would receive a dime. That said, we
don't think an actual financial restructuring or debt-for-equity swap is in the works. Rather,
bondholders will likely file the company for an involuntary bankruptcy in the Cayman
Islands in order to begin attempting to pursue assets in China.


As of yesterday, the company's 6.25% and 4.00% convertible notes traded at 17.2 and
37.2, compared with a face value of 100, according to Bloomberg. These levels imply
severe impairment; to put it another way, bondholders expect to receive no more than 17
and 37 cents for every dollar. If bondholders are that significantly impaired, equity holders

are unlikely to recover anything. Bond prices have not risen since January, indicating that
communications between the company and bondholders have been uneventful and
lacking progress. Below is a price chart of the company's bonds:


As we can see, bonds have traded in the 20 to 40 price range since the company's missed
coupon payments. At this point, the more time bondholders wait before filing an
involuntary bankruptcy, the more difficult it may become to pursue their asset claims in
China. We've previously seen Chinese management attempt to transfer assets to related
parties to put them out of the reach of foreign claim holders, with companies such as
ChinaCast, Puda Coal or Sino-Environment.


When bondholders push China Medical into bankruptcy, we think the stock price will
decline dramatically. We believe there is no value left in the equity, and a bankruptcy filing
will likely provide the catalyst that will help the market recognize that.


The Company's Irrational Stock Price


CMEDY has inexplicably risen to $4.40 over the past few weeks, which ascribes an
absurd market capitalization of $115 million (and an even more absurd $530mm million
total debt + market capitalization valuation) to China Medical Technologies. We strongly
believe this share price increase is merely one of those odd, irrational occurrences that
transpire occasionally in pink sheets-listed equities, and that the fundamentals will soon

catch up with the company's stock price. Specifically, the company will be involuntarily
forced into bankruptcy, in our opinion, and the stock price will decline dramatically from
current levels.


We're not sure whether the recent share price rise is from momentum buyers assigning
undue credibility to the SC 13G disclosures of AER Advisers, short-covering, or some
other fanciful reason. We don't care. CMEDY is likely to be pushed into involuntary
bankruptcy by bondholders, and its stock price is likely to plummet when that happens.
We can't fathom any realistic way equity holders will receive any fundamental value for
their CMEDY shares in the future.

HA! Good luck to bondholders on this one, I've talked to people in the know in China and apparently this company
isn't just going black to investors but operationally seems to be falling apart as well.


You have to wonder about these .pk China RTOs sometimes, AUTC.pk is trading at over $20 and just doesn't want to
crack... You are right though, the equity is this company is worthless, literally worth absolutely nothing.

Author’s reply »  My take is that a 35-40 bond price is pretty dire, so I'd say that those bonds are not holding
up well. But I can see how someone else would look at their consistent trading levels over the past few
months as indications that things haven't deteriorated further.


I think that there's probably only so much we can read into it. I'm not sure how much trading there has been -
I'd imagine it'd be difficult for anyone who's involved in size to get out of the bonds now. So they might be just
sitting on them as the restructuring process plays itself out. But I just don't have much color on the issue.

Sahm, I'm with you, but I hope that you're putting a wall at the ask of $4.50 because it seems that the buyers are not
daunted. I do disagree that it's unimportant to know why AER Advisors is buying. We're lucky in one respect that we
know who the major buyer is (there may be more not reporting), which is typically not the case in these illogical stock
runs. If I had your resources, I would have hired a private investigator to find out. It would also be important to know
what is happening between the bondholder's law firm and CMED. Perhaps they talk to you, but they will not talk to me
unless I'm a client. I couldn't even discover whether the $100K legal retainer that CMED said it would pay was
actually paid. Finally, it would be important to know what's going on at the company. Since no news medium has
released an article, this would require a private investigation as well. One Chinese source has stated on the Yahoo
board that the R&D part of the company has been closed, which I believe. In summary, I think that it's important to
know why AER is buying. As another poster pointed out a while back, once AER bought over 20% of the common
stock, it should have filed a SEC Form 13D instead of the short form 13G. This is per SEC Rule 13d-1(c)(3). The 13D
would have statements about why they're buying, for whom they're buying, where the funds come from, etc. That
would be most helpful. I have asked the SEC repeatedly in the past weeks whether I understand this rule correctly,
but it has not responded reliably (I called and got a guy who denied the 20% threshold and who actually said that
Forms 13D were for individuals while 13G are for entities! Since it was a phone conversation, he could say anything
without accountability.). Anyway, since I'm a little guy following you, I wish that you'd pay $1000 for an investigator to
find out AER's angle.

Author’s reply »  Thanks Vegscott. It's true, there appear to be one or multiple buyers for the stock right now.
In terms of hiring an investigator to find out AER's angle, I think that's a good idea, but in the end, I just don't
think it matters too much. Regardless of who is buying and what their motivations are, my belief is that I can't
imagine any outcome other than the company going dark in this instance, which would virtually necessitate an
involuntary bankruptcy filing.

If I weren't paying high interest to borrow--which I'm sure factors into your decisions as well--maybe I'd be
more patient to wait out CMEDY's eventual plunge to zero. Someone seems intent on keeping the price high,

at least for a while. I wish I knew the game plan--specifically, How high? and How long? Is it a group of
bondholders, trying to get conversion value? Is it buying to cover some obligations like puts sold long ago? Is
it some manipulation scheme designed to make money off short sellers? Is it a scheme to buy some certain
fraction of the common stock, at which buying would stop? If you have any contacts at the SEC, maybe you
could get them to acknowledge the misfiling by AER, and perhaps force AER to file a Form 13D.


Since it seems no one will answer these questions, and the SEC is neglectful, I have to go with what is
known. Back to the bondholders...do you know whether CMED paid the $100K legal retainer? I hope that you
have bondholder contacts. What makes you say that bankruptcy is nigh? Have your contacts told you this, or
are you guessing based on what's publicly known? Aside from the inexplicable heavy buying of the stock,
another part of this crazy scenario is the lack of bankruptcy so far. What are the bondholders waiting for? I've
never seen a company default on a bond before bankruptcy. All those I've seen in which default was imminent
(and there was no last minute restructuring) have all been forced into bankruptcy BEFORE default. So, again,
I don't understand why bondholders have waited unless they've found that they have little to no power over a
Chinese company registered in the Cayman Islands, or there is some plan to gain more value/control via the
common stock, which would explain the stock buying (hmmm....). And, again, I must ask if you have
bondholder info that they're preparing to force bankruptcy. If not, then why is bankruptcy more likely in June
than in February or March?


Finally, when the company doesn't file the annual SEC report or get an audit by August, will that trigger an
event that will drop the stock? At what point does the SEC deregister the ADS?


Thanks, Scott

Please explain why the bond prices are not similar to each other. If the bondholders know so much, it would seem
their prices would be similar rather than one more than double the other. Do these prices at all relate to their
conversion values into stock? If so, please identify the conversion rate on each.

LOL newman. You are questioning the intelligence of the bondholders and not the stockholders?? If the
stockholders are so smart, why would they buy the stock at $4 when the bonds offer an almost 6x return to
par and far more security?? Let me guess, you expect a buyout price of $40.


06 Jun 2012, 11:27 AM


a1newman
LOL Instead of answering the question, you choose to play the game of answering the question with a
question because you don't have an answer. I am not questioning the intelligence of anyone other than you
since you did not answer the question.


The conversion rate for the 4.0% senior note is 17.0068 ADS per $1,000 and the conversion rate for the
6.25% senior note is 68.6189 ADS per $1,000. Therefore the difference in pricing between the senior notes
may be partially supported by the ADS price. If the ADS price was 50% larger than what it is today, the 6.25%
would gain in value while the 4% would not be impacted. However when the stock price was in a range of
$1.75 - $2.50 from mid-April to mid-May, or about half of recent prices and the price from early April, the price
of the 6.25% senior note per the graph above does not appear to have varied with the stock price. If the
dependency is not there, then what is causing the 6.25% to be double the price of the 4% senior note?


Clearly you are not getting it. Nobody on this board really knows what the outcome will be and neither do the
shareholders or the bondholders. The current double of the price by the bondholders shows a much wider
spread than the current weekly move of the stock price. The difference in opinion between the trading
bondholders is much greater currently than the trading shareholders of the stock. Can you explain why that
is?


I am not expecting a buyout this year. The Chinese expect us to think short term which is why they will wait us
out and attempt to buy it out once the price settles in a range they like. They will make their move when they
are good and ready. They do not have to worry about the shorts losing money on the interest they pay.

Answering a question by asking a question does not necessarily yield the conclusion you reach. First, one
may be asking a rhetorical question, whereby the question is actually intended to be making a point. Are you
familiar with rhetorical questions? 
Second, one method of teaching is through asking questions. It is called the Socratic method. The questions
by the teacher can lead the student, who was the original questioner, to properly think through the matter and
came to the appropriate conclusions. 
It appears that the person responding to your questions was utilizing both rhetorical questions and the
Socratic method to assist you. The points made through the questions seem both obvious and correct.

No the 4% senior notes should be sold since the company can pay you with shares of stock at 17.0068 ADS per
$1000 par value rather than cash at expiry.


The 6.25% notes will gain from the appreciation of the shares unless they can be exchanged at their expiry in which
case no premium should be reflected against 68.6189 ADS value.

How high will it get before it collapses? My view is that until the short squeeze specialists see a major drop in
the number of short shares, cmedy will continue upwards.


Why did the 4% bonds which had traded as low as 10 go to 46 on Friday June 22nd? Was the Cayman court
action the catalyst? How quickly can the Cayman courts get money out of China?

If the Grand Court of Cayman Islands which is based on a law favorable to creditors cannot get liquidators in
China, why would a shareholder actually own anything for a company in China? Why the share would be
anything than 0? Why such an issuer would trade its junk paper in the US markets since ownership is defied
by not compliance to a court of law?


To your question, yes, foreign creditors get their money from China: 
* 2009 Case of FerroChina versus Chinese and foreigner creditors in holding of onshore and offshore
holdings.


The closure of FerroChina is unfortunate for bulls. In 2010, they informed the stock market that they are
insolvent and, to quote, "in the absence of a reasonable exit offer for the shareholders" it will be delisted
(namely, 0 value for shares).


* 2010 Case of Taizinai versus US big investors; the Cayman Court declared it bankrupt because of debt to
Citibank a.o.; the holding was completely terminated (i.e. to 0); the lawsuit propagated into China where the
Beijing Higher People's Court ordered Taizinai to pay Citibank the defaulted loans 6 months later.


In case of Taizinai, the liquidator was the one and only Borrelli Walsh, the same as in case of CMED named in
the wind up petition. For Taizinai case the Walshes had balls, they took control of a factory with some mob
made of strong muscle guys. I guess that liquidator in China knows the ways of being nasty and ugly and
telling debtors to never mess with the creditors.


Wu will cry over his idiotic closure of CMED. I forgot to mention that in all other cases, the management board
of the debtors was alive, made public statements, fought for their companies. We will end soon the 7th month
of complete silence: SEC, OTC, CMED US director, US court of law, debt legal counsels for the defaulted
bonds, bond trustee, Cayman lawyer appointed by CMED to gather bondholders names, investors,
Bloomberg, S&P, Moody's, nobody heard anything from CMED board.

Note that much of what I am asking is for education since I sold most of my shares Friday last week. I am
trying to understand why the "smarter" bondholders bought at such a high price then. I am not pushing a
bullish case but wondering how long a bankrupt company's shares can be traded before the OTC eliminates
trading. Note that until the courts determine that the company is bankrupt, I am not stating that CMEDY is
bankrupt. Can something with zero value be traded to a ridiculous price particularly if there are willing buyers?
Clearly some would maintain that it has already happened given it hit a 12 month high on Friday. As I stated,
the short squeeze specialists will continue their approach just like the shorts did in driving the price to under
$1. As long as the shorts can find shares to short and handle margin calls to whatever price, they will win
eventually assuming the courts rule for the bondholders and bankruptcy is the result and the OTC stops the
trading. .However until the courts rule, we don't yet have a bankruptcy.


I asked how quickly can the Cayman courts get money out of China? I didn't ask if they could. Will it be 1
month, 3 months or 6 months or longer to wind this up? That involves first how long for Cayman Court to rule
on petition? and second how long for the bondholders to get some value back? This may be relevant for
anyone thinking to buy the bond and also relevant for anyone with options expiring in September.

I told you to sell your shares because you don't know what a convertible bond is. Not because I thought the
price would go down over the next two weeks. I have no idea where the price will go over two weeks.
However, I am highly confident that the shares are ultimately worth zero unless you find a greater fool (which
is, of course, possible)

Well, now we know who's behind it, but still don't know their angle. Are the Deutsches bondholders, or connected to
bondholders?


After all the statements on the 13-G/As about not buying CMEDY to influence or change control of the company, now
they state that they "may formulate plans or proposals regarding the Issuer," and "expect to engage in discussions
with representatives of the Issuer and others, including dealers, concerning the Reporting Persons 
investment in the Issuer and the Issuers business, strategy, and dealer network. The Reporting Persons may suggest
or take a position with respect to potential changes in the operations or strategy of the Issuer, such as disposing of
one or more businesses or assets, or changing marketing, sales or distribution strategies." Will the SEC call AER and
the Deutsches for this deceit? Will they say the same thing if they buy >50% of the company? Sahm, are you there?


13 Jun 2012, 02:29 AM


Caller Out
I'm not as smart as Sahm, but I believe this is actually great news for the shorts. We now know that the
buyers, a family of wine importers, are wealthy Americans with no background that would make them
turnaround or vulture investors. What this means is that Adam Gefvert's hypothesis is most likely false, as it
was predicated on an illegal form of buyout. It's unlikely that Americans with a lot to lose (Money and
reputation) and within the reach of the DOJ would participate in such a scheme. Had the buyers turned out to
be offshore guys, maybe the longs could make an argument that the buyout was on. Now, the most likely two
explanations are either that these are simply "whales" who got suckered by some broker into buying shares,
or they are somehow acting as intermediaries for insider dumping.


13 Jun 2012, 09:26 AM


Ian Bezek, Marketplace Contributor
I'm not sure, but it seems like you are underestmating the core transformational enterprise synergies that can
be dynamically realized between wine importers and medical device salespeople. The cross-selling platform
could be eminently monetizable.

The family were honored in October for their work with the American Cancer Society. How do we know
whether that meeting led to discussions about this company? Somewhere they became aware of his
company and given their history battling cancer and supporting the ACS, this is as good a place as any given
the timing. I would expect the medical community at that meeting would know and understand more about
this company than you or I.


As far as great news for the shorts, the market has pushed the price up to a new high since trading on the
pink sheets.

Nobody heard of CMED in US, in the medical circles. It was hardly known in China.

I don't see the greatness of this information. Without knowing the reason for the buying, we don't know the
plan for buying, that is, how high, and how long. I find your two possible explanations to be no more plausible
than Adam's theory. I don't know what a "whale" is, but anyone throwing millions of dollars into a deregistered
stock of Chinese company that defaulted on bonds and went "dark" months ago is not doing so just because
a broker told them to without good reason. The Deutsches are apparently now the insiders, and main holders
of the stock. I see no way for them to make money by buying previous insiders' stock at a premium. I break
the reason for buying into two general themes: 1) To increase the stock price for some manipulative scheme,
or 2) To gain influence or control of the company. I lean toward #1, as they could have bought the shares
much cheaper had they waited for the stock to drop near zero (which it would have otherwise done), and then
bought stealthily. In addition, the stock is now much higher than it was before the bond defaults and delisting.
If they had an interest in the company, why not buy <$3/ADS before the stock was delisted? The plan to buy
the stock was apparently hatched after the company was left for dead, yet they didn't wait for the price to fall
to bankrupcty level. Those are signs to me that this is a scheme to raise the stock price, perhaps for the
bondholders to convert. It's taking millions of dollars to do that, and if bondholders convert and sell, the stock
will drop precipitously, so I don't understand how it'd work, but it's the only half-reasonable thing I can guess.
Like you, I discount the possibility that the Deutsches actually want the company, as bondholders would have
to be made whole (~$400 million), and the company's stated business and finances were apparently false.


Do you have an explanation for why the bondholders have not forced bankruptcy?

vegscott, in fact, they bought 15% of the s/o prior to the delisting. It's possible that they made a big mistake
here before the delisting and instead of admitting it to themselves, doubled down. Many people perform crazy
mental gymnastics to avoid admitting they were a sucker. It's possible that management is in contact with
them, and that's why they're comfortable buying more. However, there's no reason to believe that they are
true insiders, but rather just victims of a con. You overestimate the intelligence of the wealthy, who are just as
susceptible to cognitive errors as anyone else. We know from what Khizer Schon told Adam Gefvert that
brokers are targeting high net worth individuals to sell them this stock, so I think the broker explanation
actually makes lots of sense. It's also possible that they are intermediaries in a buying and selling scheme to
manipulate the price, and they have no economic ownership (i.e. someone else paid for the shares).


I have not spoken to any bondholders, so I could only speculate. The most likely explanation is that they
expect a zero recovery in liquidation, and would rather keep their option to convert and possibly dump the
stock.

Which is it? A week prior, Seeking Alpha said this Company was in play to go private, and that mgmt. was secretly
buying up stock.

I tell you what it is. It is playing cards with a worthless piece of paper but with some contractual agreements
tied to it. Shorts covering, longs reducing the pool of the paper. 
Bonds are sold at 10% of their face value and decreasing in value, against the stock which rises. This
divergence tells that everything is gross manipulation. Too bad that Ben's free money ends up in such idiotic
games for a fraudulent company.

a1newman
Latest trade on the 4% bond was at 25% of face just this afternoon. So they aren't clearly decreasing in value.
In fact that 150% increase in 2 days is a lot higher than the increase in the stock price during that time.

Johnny Small Ballz
This squeeze is chewing up significant capital for a few shorts. My remaining long shares vaporized above the bid late
yesterday afternoon. Guess I shoulda' continued to hold. This is like watching the East River on July 4th. How high
can it go?

Looks like you guessed wrong!

Isaac Silbermann, Contributor
Looks like you guessed wrong Guitune, if we are to believe the article reported on Bloomberg, then the day
after you wrote this comment, the bondholders filed to put this company into involuntary bankruptcy.

Author’s reply »  The bondholders filed an involuntary bankruptcy, and below is the Bloomberg article. We'll pass on
the actual filings as they become available.

China Medical Slumps After Bondholders Ask Court for Liquidation 
2012-06-18 19:30:44.469 GMT


By Belinda Cao


June 19 (Bloomberg) -- China Medical Technologies Inc. posted the biggest two-day drop since April in New York
after Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP said bondholders of the Beijing-based medical device company filed a petition
for liquidation.


American depositary receipts of China Medical traded on the U.S. over-the-counter market dropped 6.7 percent to
$4.75 as of 3:09 p.m. in New York, after tumbling 14 percent on June 15.


Debt holders of China Medical directed Wilmington Trust to file a so-called winding-up petition with the Grand Court of
the Cayman Islands on June 15, Jayme Goldstein, a lawyer at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan said by phone today,
adding his firm represents individual bond holders in the case. He declined to name his clients or give further details,
citing the firm's policy.


Eric Schaffer, a New York-based partner at Reed Smith LLP, confirmed that he was the U.S. counselor for Wilmington
Trust, which acts under the direction of bond holders, while declining to provide more information before getting
consent from his client.


E-mailed messages sent after hours to China Medical's investor relations manager and the company's general
information address weren't returned.

China Medical, a Cayman Islands-registered company, raised $110 million in its U.S. initial public offering in August
2005. The Nasdaq stock exchange delisted ADRs of the company on March 14, according to a statement from the
exchange.


The company defaulted on the interest payment due Dec. 15, 2011, for its 6.25 percent convertible bonds which
mature in December 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Kerrisdale, here is the petition. I highly recommend to all reading the petition for winding up of CMED. It is a detailed
history of the bondholders and their actions to contact CMED. Nothing. 
The document can be downloaded from http://scr.bi/LMMWti 
It is the original, stamped from the Grand Court of Cayman Islands.


Enjoy reading it.
