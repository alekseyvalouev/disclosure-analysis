Executive Summary

Short VRNT: Spruce Point Sees 60-70% 
Downside To $17-25 Per Share


• A Poor Business Lagging Peers: Verint’s core business is “customer engagement solutions” – a euphemism for call center software. Industry incumbents 
Verint and NICE were once near-duopolists, but NICE acted on the industry’s shift to the cloud much more effectively, and it continues to grow alongside 
technologically-savvy upstarts at a high-single-digit rate, while Verint suffers from the industry’s rising technological demands and lower barriers to entry.


• Aggressive Spending On Low-Quality M&A Obfuscates Organic Growth And Appears To Create A Cookie Jar For “Beat & Raises”: Since FY15, Verint has 
spent ~$1B on M&A. KANA, its biggest acquisition, failed spectacularly in our view, as sales growth immediately turned negative once the acquisition was 
anniversaried. Verint has continued to pursue smaller tuck-in acquisitions since, but most deals go unannounced, and are not explicitly named in SEC 
filings. We believe that, after taking into account M&A, FX, and the effects of ASC 606, organic growth was in the low single digits in FY18 and negative in 
FY19, far below reported top-line growth in the high single digits. Last quarter, management raised guidance by just $20M upon acquiring ForeSee Results, 
Inc., whereas court filings indicate that ForeSee was generating ~$80M in sales at the time of the bankruptcy of its former parent, Answers Corp. (2016), 
and was projected to grow to $130M by this year. We believe that subsequent sales growth characterized as organic was largely driven by this and other 
acquisitions, and that its underreported inorganic sales contribution created a “cookie jar” which Verint used to beat Q4 and raise FY20 guidance.


• Key Executives With Dubious Pasts: Dan Bodner has been CEO of Verint since its founding in 1994. For much of the 1990s and 2000s, it was a subsidiary of 
Comverse Technology, whose CEO, CFO, and GC orchestrated a massive options backdating scandal during this time. All three sat on Verint’s Board and 
were the sole members (with Bodner) of key Board committees. A later investigation found that Verint had carried out aggressive business practices under 
Bodner to decrease sales volatility and inflate reserves. CFO Douglas Robinson worked for Computer Associates for 17 years through the 1990s and 2000s, 
including stints as a senior member of the finance department. CA was similarly shown to have engaged in aggressive revenue recognition practices to 
inflate sales and earnings. Though Robinson was never implicated, his close association with CA’s finance department at the time of the fraud concerns us.


• Aggressive Accounting Measures And Non-GAAP Add-Backs Inflate Performance: We find it curious that, in FY19, for the first time, management 
announced that it would capitalize commissions. Whereas Adj. EBITDA and Non-GAAP Income were reported to have grown by 16% and 18% in FY19, 
respectively, growth in these metrics would have been just 2% and less than 0% when capitalized commission costs alone are added back to expenses. We 
also estimate that ~11% of Adj. EBITDA and ~45% of Non-GAAP Net Income are attributed to add-backs which we consider unusual or otherwise 
unjustifiable. As is the case with many companies researched by Spruce Point, Verint shows a widening gap between unadjusted and adjusted EBITDA, 
suggesting that management is growing increasingly aggressive to present attractive results as organic sales and earnings continue to underperform.


Verint Systems Inc. (VRNT or “the Company”) is a call center software provider which has fallen far behind the industry’s evolving technological 
standards and which is making up for slow growth with aggressive M&A and dubious accounting. While Verint reported 8% sales growth in FY19, 


we believe that, netting out M&A contributions, FX, and the effects of ASC 606, organic growth – which the Company never discloses – was 
negative. Despite Verint spending ~$1B on M&A since FY15, sales have grown at only a 2% CAGR, and FCF / share has declined at a CAGR of 1%. 
Management nevertheless rewards itself with compensation 3x that of its most comparable (but far healthier) peer, hitting comp targets through 


nonsensical earnings adjustments which appear nowhere in its filings except deep in the appendices of its proxy statements. Management’s 
questionable conduct persists over calls for improved governance and transparency, which have culminated in a proxy battle with long-time 


shareholder Neuberger Berman. Its disregard for shareholders concerns us given its deep connections with other infamous frauds and history of 
engaging in dubious business practices to flatter reported results. Even then, bulls interpret reported growth as a sign that the purported cloud-
oriented strategy is working, leaving VRNT trading at all-time high multiples even as organic growth sputters and ASC 606 benefits anniversary.

Short VRNT: Spruce Point Sees 60-70% 
Downside To $17-25 Per Share


• Questionable ASC 606-Related Accounting Changes Inflate Sales And Earnings Growth: ASC 606 adoption boosted Verint revenue by $47M (5%) and net 
income by a massive $51M (75%) in FY19. This is entirely out of line with peers such as NICE, whose revenue declined due to ASC 606, and whose net 
income went largely unaffected. Management also claims to have made changes to its business practices in anticipation of its adoption of ASC 606 –
something we find oddly suspicious – and, in FY19, to have double-counted revenue which it had recognized as revenue in prior periods. Of course, it 
made all of these changes with far less transparency than peers such as NICE, which was not only far less aggressive in its application of ASC 606, but 
which, unlike Verint, provided clear reconciliations against its financial presentations under ASC 605 standards.


• Non-Transparent Earnings And Cash Flow Adjustments Help Management Achieve Comp Targets: Performance metrics used by Verint to determine 
management compensation are riddled with questionable add-backs which are included in no other financial metrics reported by the Company. 
Management inexplicably adds net interest expense back to operating cash flow to achieve its cash flow targets. Also included in its adjustments are 
phantom “non-recurring payments” which appear nowhere else in Verint’s financial statements. Further, management recognizes material contingent 
consideration write-downs on an annual basis, thereby increasing its performance metrics as these reversals boost Company earnings. In so doing, 
management effectively gives itself credit for its poor acquisitions failing to meet their financial targets. We wonder how Verint’s acquisitions could be 
underachieving their targets when management appears to understate their prospective inorganic sales contributions.


• Proxy Fight With Neuberger Reveals Atrocious Governance: Neuberger Berman sees that Verint is struggling to keep up with industry-wide technological 
change and has pushed it to add new Board members and focus on the cloud. Management has been playing coy with Neuberger for months: it fails to 
respond to requests in a timely manner, has Neuberger-recommended Board members interview with employees who report directly to the CEO, never 
appears to seriously consider recommended Board members in the first place, and offers bizarre compromises to Neuberger in an attempt to settle the 
dispute. While stating publicly that it is focused on the cloud, management tells Neuberger that the cloud is not a primary focus, and that “customers are 
not interested in the cloud.” We see management’s double-speak, evasiveness towards Neuberger, and generally irregular behavior a significant red flags.


• Reported Cloud Revenue An Inappropriate And Non-Transparent Measure Of Cloud-Related Sales: Management recently began to report a number of 
proprietary cloud sales metrics as investors such as Neuberger demand more transparency on cloud-related growth. Company disclosures are inconsistent 
regarding the fact that its reported cloud sales figures include sales from term-based licenses, for which it can now more aggressively recognize revenue 
under ASC 606. Accordingly, its cloud sales metrics present a skewed view of its “recurring” cloud-related sales, which will be lumpier than investors 
currently believe and which could easily disappoint in the near future if the pace of customer adds slows. Industry experts generally do not consider such 
term-based arrangements to accurately represent true cloud / SaaS revenue, which is more typically arranged in subscription-like agreements, and which 
therefore produces a steadier and less volatile stream of revenue than would Verint’s term-based contracts for its “hybrid cloud” services.


• Insiders Bailing As VRNT Is Up 45% YTD And Trading Near All-Time Highs: The Street believes that VRNT trades at a ~35% discount to peers based on an 
improper view of Adj. EBITDA and net debt. Even then, the avg. analyst price target of $66 yields just 8% upside. After restating EBITDA for questionable 
add-backs and newly-capitalized expenses, and after removing non-transparent restricted cash items from liquidity, we find that VRNT trades at almost 
exactly its peer median multiple, despite contracting organic sales and stagnant cash flow. Meanwhile, insiders are dumping the stock just as it approaches 
all-time highs (up 45% YTD). We believe that its current multiples – its highest in recent history, and comparable to high-quality take-outs SAAS and BSFT –
are unsustainable as M&A fails to grow cash flow, as it falls further behind BPO software peers and out-of-favor with SaaS-oriented investors, and as it laps 
FY19 ASC 606 tailwinds. We value the slow-growing Company at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 8-10x for a price target of $17-25, yielding 60-70% downside.

Verint reported GAAP sales growth in the high single digits in both FY18 and FY19. However, Spruce Point estimates that underlying organic

Acquisitions Creating Cookie Jar For
Guidance Raises: ForeSee


Verint acquired ForeSee Results, Inc., a customer experience analytics business, on Dec 13, 2018 for just under $66M in cash. In the subsequent 
8-K, management increased its FY20 non-GAAP revenue guidance by $20M, citing the acquisition. However, in court documents filed in 


conjunction with the 2017 bankruptcy of Answers Corp. – ForeSee’s previous parent – ForeSee was disclosed as having generated $80M in sales 
in 2015 and $85M in sales in 2016, and was projected to see revenue grow to $130M by 2019, driven by multi-year contracts with relatively high 
forward visibility. Even a conservative estimate of ForeSee’s inorganic revenue contribution to Verint would be far greater than the mere $20M 


insinuated by management.


On the subsequent earnings call (Q4 FY19), management raised FY20 sales guidance by another $25M, citing business “momentum.” Was this 
raise really a product of organic momentum, or was it a “draw-down” on expected ForeSee sales which hadn’t yet been baked into guidance?


“As our momentum continues, we are raising guidance once 
again for the current year. Our guidance for the non-GAAP 
revenue is increasing by $25 million to $1.37 billion representing 
10% growth and acceleration from the prior year.”

Q4 Acquisition Timing Creates Year-End 
Revenue Boost


Through the last three fiscal years, Verint has spent at least ~$65M on new acquisitions in fiscal Q4. As management does not break out 
inorganic revenue contributions of acquired businesses, this has created a revenue tailwind for Verint going into Q4 earnings. Is management 


purposely loading up on M&A in Q4 to ensure that it matches or beats Q4 and full-year revenue guidance?


($, Millions) FY17 FY18 FY19


(A) Full-Year Non-GAAP Revenue Guidance As Of Q3 $1,075.0 $1,140.0 $1,240.0


(B) Non-GAAP Revenue Through Q3 773.2 827.7 908.4


(C) Implied Q4 Non-GAAP Revenue Guidance ((A) - (B)) $301.8 $312.3 $331.6

Q4 Non-GAAP Revenue Beat / Miss On Organic Sales, % ((H) / (C) - 1) -2.4% 1.2% -2.9%


Without the assistance of revenue acquired in Q4, we estimate that 
Verint would have missed its Q4 revenue guidance for FY19 (as of Q3) 


by a significant $9.6M (-2.9%)


Instead, it comfortably beat guidance by $5.1M (1.5%)


Though this “beat” appears to be entirely manufactured by Q4 M&A, 
management gave no indication that the beat was aided by acquisitions. 


We believe that this “beat” was entirely superficial.

Firing Over The Bow Of Neuberger?


As the proxy fight has dragged on, management has increasingly highlighted its focus on the cloud, despite continuing to acquire businesses 
with at best limited cloud orientations (per industry experts), and despite privately telling Neuberger that “Verint’s customers do not want to 
transition to the cloud, and that Verint had no intention to pursue a cloud-centric strategy….” This double-speak gives the appearance that 


Verint management is firing shots in the direction of Neuberger during earnings calls, or that it’s hoping to prove them wrong on its commitment 
to the cloud and convince them to end the proxy fight. Whatever the case may be, management’s contradictory statements effectively leave us 
unable to put any faith in its comments regarding its strategy going forward, as it relates to the cloud or otherwise. We believe that investors 


should think long and hard about whether they can feel comfortable investing in such a management team.


Neuberger Berman Proxy Filing


VRNT Q4 FY19 Earnings Call


“As we’ve discussed [on] prior calls, enterprise customers have been interested in a move to the 
cloud and what we’ve seen lately is that they’ve accelerated the cloud adoption and cloud 
purchases. So what we expect this year, $250 million in cloud revenue is predominantly from new 
deployments, so either new customers or deployments to existing customers. But the main is 
conversion, basically has not started yet. We have a handful of customers that converted maintenance 
revenue into cloud. And we expect our maintenance revenue grew last year, we actually expect 
maintenance revenue to grow this year as well, but we think that the conversion is about to begin.”


- Dan Bodner – CEO, Verint


Do you really feel comfortable investing with a management team that tells a major shareholder one thing, and all other investors another?


Why is management saying publicly that 
customers do want to move to the cloud 


when it privately tells Neuberger that 
customers do not want to move to the 


cloud?

Inflating Reported SaaS Revenue With 
Revenue From Term Licenses?


In its presentation to sell-side analysts earlier this week, Verint management defined yet another new cloud revenue metric: SaaS revenue. Per 
the presentation, cloud revenue can be broken into “SaaS” and “Managed Services,” with SaaS including “primarily subscription licenses 


bundled with managed services, as well as, some term licenses with managed services sold separately.” Regardless of whether management 
believes that this term-based revenue properly belongs within “cloud revenue,” we certainly do not believe that term-based revenue should be 


included in “SaaS revenue,” which, to us, now presents a misleading representation of recurring revenue to investors.


Term license revenue is not SaaS revenue, and should not be reported as such

Adoption of ASC 606 Revenue Recognition 
Standards Provide Powerful Revenue Tailwind


When transitioning accounting standards to ASC 606, management chose to use the “modified retrospective method,” under which it did not 
restate prior period results as they would have appeared under ASC 606. This gave Verint a ~$50M revenue tailwind in FY19 on our organic sales 


estimate of $1.1B, thus boosting reported sales by 4%. Earnings, meanwhile, grew by a full 73%! Management claimed that “business practice 
changes” undertaken in advance of adopting new revenue recognition standards – not the accounting change itself – were responsible for the 


large delta, and, therefore, that the FY19 results reported under ASC 606 could be compared to prior periods on an apples-to-apples basis. 
Spruce Point finds this defense extremely suspect, and believes that the impact of ASC 606 should be deducted from sales when calculating 


Verint’s organic growth.

Widening Spread Between GAAP And
Non-GAAP Net Income


As is the case with many companies investigated by Spruce Point, Verint shows an increasingly large spread between GAAP and Non-GAAP 
income. In fact, in FY17 and FY18, Non-GAAP adjustments were responsible for over 100% of Non-GAAP net income. We believe that GAAP 


income is a far better measure of Verint’s economic reality than a Non-GAAP measure of income with ~$150M worth of management add-backs.

As discussed, effectively all growth in Adj. EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income in FY19 can be attributed to management’s decision to capitalize 
commissions starting last year. When capitalized commissions are deducted from both Adj. EBITDA and Non-GAAP Net Income in FY19, growth 


in both metrics is cut from mid-teens levels to close to (or below) zero.

Top Executives With Deep Ties To Accounting 
Scandals, Demonstrated Accounting Misconduct


Both Dan Bodner, Verint’s President, CEO, and Chairman, and Douglas Robinson, Verint’s CFO, served in key roles at companies which were 
shown to have engaged in significant accounting fraud. Bodner was alleged to have profited from Comverse’s options backdating scandal and 
to have participated in the misrepresentation of Comverse’s performance, as was Bodner’s long-time CFO at Verint prior to Robinson’s tenure. 
Robinson, meanwhile, served in a variety of financial roles through the 1990s and 2000s at Computer Associates, whose top executives were 


indicted for engaging in a “35-day month” revenue recognition scheme. Given Verint’s demonstrated financial misconduct under Bodner and his 
business partners, we find the Company’s more recent evasiveness regarding organic growth and cloud-based revenue highly concerning.

Management Falling Back Into The
Same Patterns?


Following the Comverse options backdating scandal, Verint – a Comverse subsidiary at the time – conducted an internal investigation into the 
Company’s accounting practices and associated business behavior. While no similar options backdating issues were identified, the Audit 


Committee found numerous instances of questionable business practices designed to improve Verint’s reported financial results. President and 
CEO Dan Bodner was specifically reprimanded for overseeing these behaviors. Spruce Point is concerned that significant parallels exist between 


the misconduct described by the Audit Committee ten years ago and business practices which we observe at Verint today.


Parallels Between Past And Present Business Practices at Verint


Audit Committee Observations Regarding Prior Business Practices Spruce Point Observations Regarding Current Business Practices


Revenue Recognition And 
Revenue Timing Management


• Structured customer agreements to accelerate or delay timing 
of product delivery to reduce quarter-to-quarter volatility in 
reported sales


• Verint completes (unannounced) acquisitions mid-quarter and 
subsequently announces earnings beats without disclosing 
inorganic revenue contributions


• Reports suggest that management is focused on hitting Wall 
Street expectations over the underlying health of the business. 
Could encourage aggressive business practices to meet investor 
expectations.


Business Practices Fitted To 
Accounting Standards


• “…delivery decisions [were] influenced by revenue recognition 
factors” in order to manage revenue volatility on a quarter-to-
quarter basis


• Management states that it changed its business practices “in 
anticipation, and as a result, of the new accounting guidance”


“Reserve” Management
• Accounting reserves intentionally overstated “to protect 


against unanticipated future expenses and to allow future 
flexibility”


• Management understates the likely inorganic revenue 
contributions of acquired businesses before issuing guidance 
raises in future quarters, likely aided by undisclosed inorganic 
revenue contributions


Questionable Conduct In 
Adoption Of New Accounting 
Standards Flatter Revenue


• “The investigation revealed no contemporaneously prepared 
documentation analyzing the adoption of SOP 97-2 and limited 
documentation analyzing periodic compliance with SOP 97-2.”


• Improper application of new accounting standards could have 
enabled management to continue to recognize revenue which, 
under new standards, should have been deferred “until all 
elements [of an arrangement] have been delivered”


• Relative lack of transparency regarding impact of ASC 606 on
revenue presents potentially false image of organic sales 
growth


• Adoption of ASC 606 permits up-front revenue recognition of 
elements of term-based software contracts. Improper 
allocations of term-based agreements to “Cloud Revenue” may 
have inflated cloud-related sales as reported

VRNT Trading Near All-Time Highs


Despite its technology falling behind competitors, and despite most growth coming from low-quality M&A, VRNT shares are currently trading 
near their all-time highs, and well above its historical valuation range. We believe that the market is incorrectly interpreting reported top-line 
growth as a signal that the underlying business is healthy. The Company is set up to disappoint investors not only as its ASC 606 benefits 


lapse, but as continued M&A fails to support cash flow growth or even longer-term sales growth without further value-destroying M&A. With 
Verint more levered than the market believes, the Company has less capacity for continued acquisitions than investors perceive, and 


aggressive insider selling leaves management with increasingly less incentive to manage the Company in the interest of shareholders.

VRNT Trading Like A High-Flying
Cloud Business


We note that NICE’s transformative acquisition of cloud infrastructure provider inContact (Nasdaq: SAAS) in May 2016 valued the business at 
3.8x sales. At the time, inContact sales were growing at 30% annually, and its acquisition by NICE was largely responsible for its own current 


strength in the cloud infrastructure space – a major reason that NICE’s organic sales are growing at a high-single digit rate despite the 
headwinds facing the broader BPO industry.


Why does slow-growing Verint – a company with demonstrated weaknesses in the cloud and a seeming inability to grow organically through the 
last three years – trade at effectively the same sales multiple?

Note also that inContact’s CEO chose to remain with the business following its acquisition by NICE – a vote of confidence in the future of the 
business and its continued growth as a part of NICE, in Spruce Point’s view. Meanwhile, what was supposed to be Verint’s transformative cloud-


oriented acquisition of KANA had already shown to be a flop just a year after it was completed.


Post-deal organic 
sales growth of ~8%


“This week we're celebrating three years since we announced the 
acquisition of inContact which was pivotal point for NICE and 
represented a seismic shift in the customer engagement market.
The acquisition and the ensuing delivery of CXone gave us the first and 
only true native cloud platform that seriously incorporates the 
marketing and routing, workforce optimization and analytics into a 
single platform for enterprises of all sizes. With all these assets 
combined together with substantial investment in R&D since the 
acquisition CXone has become the most complete platform in the market.


…It is clear that the execution of our strategy is working as reflected 
in our strong results, including in Q1, where we reported year-over-
year double-digit growth in all key metrics. This included a 12% 
increase in revenues to $378 million.”

Verint Insider Ownership


Even as management talks up its anticipated cloud growth to investors, insiders have sold aggressively through the last several years. 
Insider ownership is now near an all-time low. As management grows revenue and earnings through frequent acquisitions while cash flow 


remains effectively flat, hitting ever-larger compensation targets and talking up Verint’s stock price on low-quality guidance raises, it appears 
as though insiders are using Verint as a vehicle for self-enrichment while destroying shareholder value through ill-advised M&A.


Why should investors buy into the cloud growth strategy if insiders won’t? Recent trades by CEO Bodner suggest that he thinks the stock is 
getting frothy…

Summary: Verint Just A Vehicle For
Self-Enrichment For Management?


Even as management has spent nearly $1B on acquisitions since FY15, revenue, Adj. EBITDA, operating cash flow, and free cash flow have 
remained largely flat, while free cash flow per share is down over the same period. Meanwhile, executives have aggressively sold shares 
while inflating non-GAAP metrics to meet their compensation targets. We have little confidence that the business is being run in the best 


interest of shareholders.

Mentions of "Cloud" in NICE 20-F


The Business Process Outsourcing Industry Is 
Undergoing Powerful Technological Change


Through its core Customer Engagement Solutions segment, Verint provides workforce management and other business process solutions to 
customers across various industries. By Verint’s own admission, the world of business process outsourcing (BPO) is becoming increasingly 


complex, favoring players capable of providing more scalable and advanced cloud-based solutions. This industry-wide shift has put pressure on 
BPO companies to keep up with rapidly-advancing technology, and has created opportunities for tech-forward upstarts to threaten incumbents.


Whereas Verint and NICE Ltd., its major competitor, have historically been considered near-duopolists in the BPO software space, recent 
technological developments are forcing both players to invest in new capabilities to earn their respective spots atop the industry. They shared 
as much as ~60% market share between them until recently, but the space will become increasingly fragmented with the ongoing shift to the 


cloud and falling barriers to entry.

Verint Misses The Boat On The Shift To
The Cloud


Over the last five years, both Verint and NICE completed acquisitions which were pitched as transformative deals intended to align each 
Company with customers’ rising technological demands. In Jan 2014, Verint acquired KANA Software, Inc., a CRM software provider which was 
expected to bring a “multichannel customer experience solution” to Verint. It appears that management saw the $514M acquisition as, first and 


foremost, a chance to create cross-selling opportunities among customers of its various services. This approach failed to support lasting growth, 
and Verint sales growth turned negative as soon as the KANA acquisition lapsed in Q4 FY16.


Meanwhile, NICE acquired inContact (Nasdaq: SAAS) in May 2016 for $940M. In inContact, NICE acquired cloud infrastructure which has since 
allowed it to offer “a fully integrated cloud contact center” solution. This has given NICE a leg-up in the industry as customers increasingly shift 


to the cloud, and has allowed it to sustain YoY sales growth of 10-30% on a quarterly basis since 2016.


We believe that NICE’s acquisition of inContact put it in position to increase share as customers demanded broader cloud capabilities. 
Meanwhile, Verint’s acquisition of KANA simply expanded its suite of products without transforming its cloud capabilities. Accordingly, it did 


nothing to support sales growth above industry-wide levels once the acquisition lapsed.

Looking To Advance Technologically On The 
Back Of A Weak Business


It is also worth noting that, when KANA traded publicly in the mid-2000s, the company disclosed a number of material weaknesses related to its 
financial reporting, and was subsequently delisted from the NASDAQ. It was acquired by Accel-KKR in 2009 for just $41M (~0.9x sales) after its 
sales more than halved from $54M in 2006 to $26M in 2008. KKR subsequently acquired a number of other customer service software providers 
and bundled them into KANA before selling the business to Verint for $514M in 2014 (~3.5x sales). KANA itself was little more than a jumble of 


unrelated BPO software applications when it was acquired by Verint, accumulated over the course of ~4 years by a private equity owner. We are 
not surprised that this deal failed to support lasting organic growth for Verint.


Our independent registered public accounting firm has identified material weaknesses in our internal controls that, if not remediated, could 
affect our ability to prepare timely and accurate financial reports, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
and have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.


In the course of the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, our former independent registered public 
accounting firm identified and reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting…. Soon thereafter, our former Chief 
Executive Officer and current Chief Financial Officer performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and found that they were not 
effective. First, we had weaknesses in our general accounting processes related to insufficient documentation and analyses to support our 
consolidated financial statements, failure to properly evaluate estimates of royalties due and insufficient staffing in the accounting and 
reporting function, which was exacerbated by changes in management and accounting personnel and insufficient training of our accounting 
department. Second, there was no independent review of journal entries, and insufficient documentation or support for journal entries and 
consolidation entries. In a number of cases, these required adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 
2004. Furthermore, during the first quarter of 2005, our Audit Committee completed an examination of certain of our internal controls relating 
to travel and entertainment expenses and determined that we had made erroneous expense reimbursements to our former Chief Executive 
Officer and certain other executive officers, primarily as a result of inconsistent travel and entertainment policies, inadequate review of expense 
reimbursement requests and carelessness….


Management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has addressed these material weaknesses and has implemented 
controls to remediate these internal control weaknesses. Management believes that it has corrected the material weakness relating to travel and 
entertainment expense reimbursement by the end of the first quarter of 2005. New processes and internal controls have been approved and 
implemented and management has concluded that as of December 31, 2006, these controls are operating effectively.


During the 2006 year-end close, however, we identified and reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related 
to stock-based compensation. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than 
a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected. This material weakness related to our 
failure to complete a proper analysis of historical stock option vesting data within our system. This resulted in a net overstatement of our 
stock-based compensation during the interim reporting periods of fiscal year 2006. As a result of this material weakness, quarterly results of 
operations have been restated, as provided in Note 14 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prior period pro-forma informational 
disclosure of expenses have also been restated as provided in Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and the Company 
was unable to conclude that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2006.

Verint Is Falling Behind NICE In The Race To 
The Cloud


As strong cloud capabilities become increasingly critical to BPO providers, NICE has developed a material lead over Verint in its cloud 
technologies. With its 2016 acquisition of inContact – a cloud-oriented provider of BPO services – and subsequent launch of NICE inContact 


CXone in 2017, NICE established itself as the clear leader in cloud capabilities in the BPO space. It has been recognized as such by a number of 
market research and intelligence firms, which have rated NICE as a cloud leader not only in the workforce management space, but more broadly 


across contact center service providers. Verint, meanwhile, is not even mentioned as a serious cloud player by the same evaluators.

Competitors, Customers, And Other Industry 
Players Agree: Verint Is Falling Behind


In the course of our research, we spoke with numerous industry participants regarding the state of the industry and Verint’s relative positioning 
within it. The consensus among industry experts is clear: Verint is quickly falling behind as competitors leapfrog ahead in the cloud.


“[Verint] didn’t have a good feel for the rate or pace of change and 
how quickly, in the last 12-18 months, how the cloud has become 
ubiquitous. It’s not an ‘if’ question anymore, it’s how quickly can we 
migrate to the cloud. I think Verint has missed the signals there –
and, to be honest, inexplicably so.”


- Verint Customer


“Two to three years ago, I would have put [Verint] in a clear 
leading position. Now, I do not view them in a lead position, as I 
have them as one of three or one of four. They are going to play 
catch-up over the next two years. They should have had the 
foresight to lead the push into the cloud. And they missed that 
opportunity. Their market share will have declined from previous 
levels because of the fact that they missed the opportunity with 
the cloud.”


- Verint Customer
“Verint, in my opinion…I have worked with them for 18 years…. It’s 
a little bit of ‘shame on them’ that they have missed the cloud 
play.”


- Verint Customer
“There is still growth in the SMB space that I think NICE is better 
poised to take advantage of because of the inContact 
[acquisition] and transition to the cloud that Verint hasn’t been 
fully able to leverage.”


- Former Verint Employee


“I think Verint has dropped the ball completely in terms of cloud.”


- Verint Competitor


“[Verint] is behind the curve.”


- Verint Customer
27


Well-Funded Tech-Forward Competitors Are 
Taking Share


Whereas the workforce engagement management space was once regarded as a near-duopoly between Verint and NICE, growing demand for 
cloud capabilities has created an opportunity for tech-focused upstarts to take share. In particular, Calabrio and Genesys both focus on 


providing cloud-based solutions, and have been recognized for their growing leadership in the space. Genesys, alongside NICE, was recognized 
as one of three leaders in “contact center as a service” by Gartner in 2018. While Calabrio was not recognized in this category, it was recognized 


by Gartner as a “visionary” in workforce engagement management, and our conversations with industry participants suggest that it is well-
regarded among customers. Importantly, both Calabrio (KKR) and Genesys (Hellman & Friedman) have support from deep-pocketed private 
equity shops, and Calabrio recently received a follow-on investment from KKR to “continue its rapid growth and shift to the cloud.” Verint’s 
balance sheet, meanwhile – saddled by $650M of net debt at 3x leverage, by our estimates – will likely restrict it from making similarly-sizable 


investments in cloud capabilities.

Employee Growth Stagnant, Per LinkedIn


Verint typically reports gradual YoY growth in its employee base every year. In FY19, it reported a strong 17% increase in its employee base. 
However, we suspect that much of this growth has come from acquisitions or the Company’s inclusion of “certain contractors” in its employee 


count. LinkedIn data reveals that growth in Verint’s employee base has remained steady at close to 0% for at least two years. While this confirms 
our belief that Verint currently sees little to no organic growth, we openly question management’s presentation of its employee data, and wonder 
why its reported growth in its employee base differs so markedly from LinkedIn data. Even if LinkedIn’s precise employee count is off, shouldn’t 


the growth rates shown by LinkedIn and presented by the Company be somewhat similar?

Employees Recognize Management’s Lack Of 
Focus On New Technology


Management’s lack of focus on developing new technologies – cloud-oriented or otherwise – is not lost on employees. Former employees report 
that “Verint is stalling” and is “stuck in its old ways,” and that management has “no strategic vision or understanding of technology.” They also 
generally describe Verint as a poor place to work, with a “political” management team that tends to neglect lower-level employees. Tech-oriented 


employees reportedly go underappreciated compared to middle managers with stronger connections to upper management.


Is it any surprise that Verint – prioritizing middle and upper management over its tech workforce – is falling behind technologically?

Masking Poor Organic Growth With 
Aggressive M&A?
31


Frequent M&A Masks Poor Organic Growth


Since FY15, Verint has spent ~$970M on acquisitions. Over the same time period, sales have grown by just ~$320M, and cash flow from 
operations by just ~$40M. Any reasonable estimate of Verint’s M&A sales contribution would suggest that the Company is experiencing 


dramatic organic top-line contraction – yet management almost never addresses organic growth on calls, nor is it asked about it by analysts. 
The few times that management has addressed underlying organic growth, it suggests that its “tuck-in acquisitions” are generally of “small 


companies with good products,” but which “typically do not make money,” thus downplaying their sales and earnings contributions. Are we to 
believe that recently-acquired businesses on which Verint has spent up to $30-60M have contributed effectively nothing to revenue or earnings?

“The Contact Solutions was a tuck-in acquisition we did earlier in the year. OpinionLab is 
another company we did in Q4, I believe in November. And you know, our M&A strategy has 
been since we – the last deal, relatively big deal we did was over three years ago with Kana. 
Since then our strategy is to do tuck-in acquisitions, basically buy small companies with 
good products. Those companies typically do not make money and they need to scale, 
and when we bring the product to our large sales force and large customer base, we have an 
opportunity over time to scale the business and make it profitable.”

Where’s The Growth?


Despite spending just under $1B on acquisitions since FY15, sales have grown by just ~$320M for a 6% CAGR, and operating cash flow by 
~$40M for a 4% CAGR. Note that ~$220M of this ~$320 growth in sales occurred in FY15 alone, following Verint’s $605M acquisition of Kana. 


Since then, management has spent an additional $366M on M&A to generate just ~$100M in incremental sales and ~$20M in incremental 
operating cash flow. This strongly suggests that organic growth since FY15 has been flat at best, and severely negative at worst. Management’s 


lack of clarity regarding underlying organic sales growth is suspicious to us in this context.

Tuck-In Acquisition Spend Ramps Up Just As 
Sales Growth Appears To Stall


Beginning in FY17 – just as Verint was experiencing its first revenue contraction since the financial crisis – the Company began to ramp up its 
spending on what management deems “tuck-in acquisitions,” most of which it does not discuss on calls or identify in SEC filings. While some 
of these undisclosed businesses were acquired for very small sums (<$10M), some were acquired for prices comparable to those which Verint 


paid on its disclosed acquisitions ($30M+). Why does management avoid discussing these acquisitions, to say nothing of their possible 
inorganic revenue contributions?


Spending on “tuck-in acquisitions” 
accelerates beginning in Q1 FY17


“One more for Doug, can you tell us the -- what was the 
revenue contribution in the quarter from Contact Solutions 
and Intelligent and what are your expectations for each for 
the year?”


- Kyle Chen – Credit Suisse


“Yeah, well, Intelligent we did last year, it's small more just product oriented and Contact Solutions similar 
small maybe a few in the quarter, but really small contribution. So to just clarify that we see a part of 
our land and expense strategy. We're expanding our portfolio and when we see opportunities for tuck-in 
acquisitions that can provide us capabilities obviously that supports our overall strategy intelligent products 
communities and contact solutions bring to us the contextual self service capabilities. And in terms of 
providing some match mix regarding companies that the tuck-in acquisitions we do, we generally just 
focus on the technology and how to bring this technology into our portfolio and of course when we do a 
larger acquisitions then we provide a complete breakdown of revenue and gross margin and profit, but it’s 
really not applicable in this case.”

Former Employees Confirm: Management Focused 
On The Numbers At The Expense Of Product Quality


Former employees report that Verint management is hyper-focused on meeting Wall Street expectations and satisfying investors over ensuring 
customer and employee satisfaction. They suggest that management has little cohesive vision for the business aside from emphasizing its SaaS 


orientation to attract new investors. In light of this intel, it is little surprise to us that the core business is organically flat or shrinking, and that 
management is so keen on characterizing acquisition-driven growth as organic growth. These employee reviews also come as little surprise to 


us given management’s history of structuring business practices around hitting financial targets.

Stock-Based Comp Allocation Shifting Away From 
R&D, Service & Support To SG&A


SG&A R&D, Net COGS - Service & Support COGS - Product


Declining Equity Alignment With Service & Support 
And R&D Suggests Shift In Management Focus


Spruce Point believes that management’s increasing focus on hitting financial targets over the health of the business is reflected in recent shifts 
in Verint’s bonus structure. While Verint’s total stock-based compensation has generally remained steady through the last three years, it has 


increasingly been allocated to SG&A at the expense of service & support COGS, as well as R&D.

Building A Cohesive Company,
Or Buying Growth?


In light of former employee complaints regarding the disjointed nature of the Company, we wonder just how much effort management puts into 
integrating acquired businesses. In particular, we note that many of the businesses and services acquired by Verint continue to maintain their 
own websites, which look almost unchanged following their acquisition by Verint. Is management trying to build a cohesive business services 


company, or simply conducting M&A to acquire growth? Is the only real “synergy” in these acquisitions a new cross-selling opportunity?


Businesses acquired by Verint continue to maintain separate websites once acquired.


If these “Verint companies” remain largely autonomous, do Verint’s acquisitions really create material shareholder value?

Separate brands


Separate operating silos?

Stock Price Growth Historically Follows Sizable Acquisitions


Quarterly Non-GAAP Sales Growth (YoY) VRNT Price per Share


An Unflattering M&A Track Record


Prior to its most recent round of adding “tuck-in acquisitions,” management’s last large deal involved the acquisition of KANA Software, Inc. 
from Accel-KKR for $514M in Jan 2014 – just four years after Accel-KKR purchased the business for only $41M. Verint sales growth quickly 


turned negative with the lapping of the KANA acquisition in Q1 FY16 as management reported slow uptake of its new services among existing 
customers. We believe that management’s primary goal in acquiring KANA – gaining cross-selling opportunities – is little different from its 


current goal in conducting M&A, and that its acquisitions have few real synergies and create limited shareholder value at best.


“And the strategy was land and expand, we discussed the fact that we have a very broad portfolio of better-breed solutions, and we also 
have a large customer base. We acquired KANA and we got their customer base. So we saw a great opportunity to land and 
expand within the customer base and as well as new customers. And it actually worked very well for us last year where we achieved 
double-digit organic growth as we were executing on this land-and-expand strategy last year….


…What became clear to us now after a couple of quarters of looking at the trends is that while our customers are very interested in working 
with vendors that have a broad portfolio and moving faster towards transformation, the approval cycle does take longer, and when they 
approach management, they need to go back and defend the proposal and go through a long explanation and so forth.”

Transparency Into M&A Declines Just As 
Spending On Acquisitions Accelerates


Since management ramped up its spending on tuck-in acquisitions after FY16, Verint has spent $340M on M&A and close to $80M on 
undisclosed acquisitions alone. Yet, over the same time period, the Company has generated just $100M in incremental sales and $60M in 
incremental cash flow from operations. We are concerned that management’s increasing spending on tuck-in acquisitions and declining 


transparency into its M&A activity may be protecting the company from having to reveal extremely disappointing organic growth.

Quietly Adding Revenue Through Acquiring 
Majority Interest?


In Q4 FY19, Verint quietly acquired a majority interest in NowForce, a business of which it had been a minority stakeholder since FY16. Our 
diligence suggests that this transaction was completed on Dec 26, 2018 – yet management issued no press release disclosing the deal, nor did it 


mention the deal in its subsequent 10-K. We also note that it appears that management did not include this transaction among its unnamed 
“other business contributions” in its 10-K, as this section of its 10-K cites no transactions completed on Dec 26. Accordingly, we find no 


evidence that this transaction was ever disclosed to investors.


In Jun 2018, Velpic Limited – another minority stakeholder of NowForce – valued the business at ~$20M. Accordingly, we believe that NowForce 
could generate $10-20M in annual sales – an inorganic source of revenue of which investors were never informed.

Another Undisclosed Acquisition About To Hit 
The Books


Spruce Point has discovered yet another acquisition completed by Verint in the current quarter which was never announced by management. 
The founder and CEO of Monet Software, Inc. announced on Feb 20 of this year that Monet had been acquired by Verint. Indeed, per Monet’s 
website and LinkedIn page, the business now goes by “Verint Monet.” Crunchbase estimates that Monet does ~$12.5M in sales per year. Why 


does management believe that the acquisition of ~$12.5M in inorganic sales is not sufficiently material to announce to investors? Does 
management plan on disclosing Verint’s organic sales and organic growth ex-Monet through the coming quarters?

Historical Revenue Of Acquired Businesses Far 
Greater Than Total Verint Sales Growth


Based on public data and informed estimates of sales generated by businesses acquired by Verint, Spruce Point estimates that businesses 
acquired or consolidated by Verint since FY17 collectively generated $225-$380M in revenue in the twelve months prior to their acquisition. As 


we show in subsequent slides, we believe that, with the Company having increased sales by just $100M over the same three years, Verint’s 
organic revenue growth was likely materially negative over this time period.

Material Inorganic Revenue Contributions On 
A Quarterly Basis


Spruce Point believes that acquisitions have brought between $10-25M in incremental inorganic sales per quarter to Verint through the last three

Acquisitions Creating Cookie Jar For
Guidance Raises: ForeSee


Verint acquired ForeSee Results, Inc., a customer experience analytics business, on Dec 13, 2018 for just under $66M in cash. In the subsequent 
8-K, management increased its FY20 non-GAAP revenue guidance by $20M, citing the acquisition. However, in court documents filed in 


conjunction with the 2017 bankruptcy of Answers Corp. – ForeSee’s previous parent – ForeSee was disclosed as having generated $80M in sales 
in 2015 and $85M in sales in 2016, and was projected to see revenue grow to $130M by 2019, driven by multi-year contracts with relatively high 
forward visibility. Even a conservative estimate of ForeSee’s inorganic revenue contribution to Verint would be far greater than the mere $20M 


insinuated by management.


On the subsequent earnings call (Q4 FY19), management raised FY20 sales guidance by another $25M, citing business “momentum.” Was this 
raise really a product of organic momentum, or was it a “draw-down” on expected ForeSee sales which hadn’t yet been baked into guidance?


“As our momentum continues, we are raising guidance once 
again for the current year. Our guidance for the non-GAAP 
revenue is increasing by $25 million to $1.37 billion representing 
10% growth and acceleration from the prior year.”

Lack Of Transparency Gives Potentially 
Misleading Signals To Sell Side


When management announced the ForeSee deal, it increased non-GAAP revenue guidance by $20M “subject to closing the acquisition” –
strongly suggesting, but not stating explicitly, that it expected ForeSee to contribute $20M in annual sales. While management may have been 


careful in its choice of words, the sell-side nonetheless takes its insinuations as given, and management gives no clarity into underlying organic 
growth to correct analyst assumptions. Management appears to have no problem leading the sell-side on, even if not explicitly.

Acquisitions Creating Cookie Jar For
Guidance Raises: Next IT


We note that Verint seems to have followed a similar pattern of behavior following its acquisition of Next IT in Dec 2017. Management increased 
FY19 sales guidance by $10M after completing the deal. However, as of Sep 30, 2017, Next IT had trailing twelve-months sales of $18.4M, and 


YoY sales growth of 24% in Q3 CY17. We estimate that Next IT would have generated $18.4-24.6M over the course of a full year at the time of the 
acquisition (on YoY sales growth between 0-24%), implying an inorganic FY19 sales contribution to Verint of $16-22M, taking the mid-December 
timing of the deal into account. Given these assumptions, Verint’s $10M post-acquisition revenue guidance raise was $6-12M short of Next IT’s 


realistic FY19 inorganic sales contribution.


Interestingly, on the following earnings call, management would go on to raise FY19 revenue guidance by $5M – an amount similar to our 
estimated guidance adjustment shortfall. Did this $5M raise simply represent the remainder of the anticipated inorganic Next IT sales 


contribution not included in the initial guidance adjustment?

Actual Q4 Revenue Beat vs. Organic Q4 Revenue Beat (Est.)


Revenue Beat/Miss into Q4, Actual Organic Revenue Beat/Miss Into Q4 (Spruce Point Estimate)


Through the last three fiscal years, Verint has spent at least ~$65M on new acquisitions in fiscal Q4. As management does not break out 
inorganic revenue contributions of acquired businesses, this has created a revenue tailwind for Verint going into Q4 earnings. Is management 


purposely loading up on M&A in Q4 to ensure that it matches or beats Q4 and full-year revenue guidance?


Without the assistance of revenue acquired in Q4, we estimate that 
Verint would have missed its Q4 revenue guidance for FY19 (as of Q3) 


by a significant $9.6M (-2.9%)


Instead, it comfortably beat guidance by $5.1M (1.5%)


Though this “beat” appears to be entirely manufactured by Q4 M&A, 
management gave no indication that the beat was aided by acquisitions. 


We believe that this “beat” was entirely superficial.

Contingent Consideration Reversals Expose 
Acquisition Underperformance (Or Worse)?


Buried in the notes to Verint’s financial statements are details regarding the fair value of contingent considerations related to M&A. Startlingly, we 
note that management has begun to apply increasingly sizeable quarterly write-downs to its outstanding contingent consideration liability. These 
reversals reveal that management is rolling back its earnings projections for its recent acquisitions. At best, this suggests that Verint acquisitions 
consistently underperform management’s expectations. However, we also note – troublingly – that contingent consideration write-downs flatter 


executive performance metrics by boosting earnings, giving management an incentive to acquire even underperforming businesses.

Neuberger Highlights Poor Performance And 
Governance Concerns


Neuberger Berman, a 2.6% owner of Verint stock and a shareholder since 2006, filed proxy materials earlier this year in an attempt to push the 
company to refocus its growth efforts on cloud applications. The filing highlights what Neuberger sees as poor M&A, lack of a detailed cloud 


strategy, a Board of Directors with limited cloud experience, and general long-term underperformance versus NICE. Neuberger’s concerns echo 
many of our own: management has little vision for the future of its business and is carelessly pursuing a strategy of M&A which has burned 


cash while creating little to no shareholder value.

Proxy Fight Reveals Evasiveness And 
Mismanagement


Neuberger’s most recent filings in relation to the proxy fight recount an almost comical back-and-forth with Verint management through which 
management has consistently ignored Neuberger’s requests or treated them with a startling degree of dismissiveness. After repeatedly delaying 
interviews with Neuberger’s Board nominees, and then having them interview with HR (and not with senior management), management rejected 


the nominees and proposed a bizarre set of compromise measures which included “provid[ing] Neuberger Berman with a preview of the 
Company's upcoming guidance….” We find management’s unwillingness to entertain Neuberger’s recommendations in a good-faith manner 
concerning. We have little confidence that Verint executives will change their ineffective growth strategy so long as they can help it, and their 


behavior throughout the proxy fight makes us question their commitment to defending the interests of shareholders.

Firing Over The Bow Of Neuberger?


As the proxy fight has dragged on, management has increasingly highlighted its focus on the cloud, despite continuing to acquire businesses 
with at best limited cloud orientations (per industry experts), and despite privately telling Neuberger that “Verint’s customers do not want to 
transition to the cloud, and that Verint had no intention to pursue a cloud-centric strategy….” This double-speak gives the appearance that 


Verint management is firing shots in the direction of Neuberger during earnings calls, or that it’s hoping to prove them wrong on its commitment 
to the cloud and convince them to end the proxy fight. Whatever the case may be, management’s contradictory statements effectively leave us 
unable to put any faith in its comments regarding its strategy going forward, as it relates to the cloud or otherwise. We believe that investors 


should think long and hard about whether they can feel comfortable investing in such a management team.


Neuberger Berman Proxy Filing


VRNT Q4 FY19 Earnings Call


“As we’ve discussed [on] prior calls, enterprise customers have been interested in a move to the 
cloud and what we’ve seen lately is that they’ve accelerated the cloud adoption and cloud 
purchases. So what we expect this year, $250 million in cloud revenue is predominantly from new 
deployments, so either new customers or deployments to existing customers. But the main is 
conversion, basically has not started yet. We have a handful of customers that converted maintenance 
revenue into cloud. And we expect our maintenance revenue grew last year, we actually expect 
maintenance revenue to grow this year as well, but we think that the conversion is about to begin.”


- Dan Bodner – CEO, Verint


Do you really feel comfortable investing with a management team that tells a major shareholder one thing, and all other investors another?


Why is management saying publicly that 
customers do want to move to the cloud 


when it privately tells Neuberger that 
customers do not want to move to the 


cloud?

Management Implicitly Projecting Zero Or 
Negative Organic Cloud Growth For FY20


Verint states in its recent investor presentations that it anticipates cloud-related revenue to grow by $85M in FY20 to $250M, up from $165M in 
FY19. However, we expect ForeSee alone to contribute ~$90M in inorganic sales in FY20, on top of other (most likely cloud-related) sources of 


inorganic sales of ~$35M from other acquisitions. Is Verint’s “cloud” business growing organically at all?

Revenue Growth Far Below Stated Targets


Verint recently announced a target three-year cloud revenue CAGR of 30-40%. This implies that management is targeting FY22 cloud revenue of 
~$360-450M. However, with recent acquisitions poised to contribute $115-125M in cloud revenue by our estimates, we believe that this leaves 


targeted cloud revenue growth at a three-year CAGR of just 13-27% excluding outstanding sources of inorganic cloud revenue.


Note that this includes contributions of recent acquisitions only through their respective one-year lap dates, ignoring further contributions 
which will continue to support a meaningful share of Verint’s cloud revenue going forward. This also ignores inorganic contributions from future 


M&A, which we fully expect to be material given Verint’s stagnant organic growth and highly optimistic long-term revenue targets.

What Exactly Is “Cloud Revenue”?


In SEC filings and press releases, management has begun to provide a number of proprietary metrics which it uses to measure cloud-related 
revenue – specifically, “cloud revenue,” “recurring revenue,” “cloud annualized recurring revenue (ARR),” and, most recently, “SaaS revenue.” 
We find it concerning that management’s definition of “cloud revenue” is not consistent between its press releases and financial statements, 


with its SEC filings noting that cloud revenue includes “term-based licenses, which are recognized at a point in time.” Why is this not disclosed 
in press releases?


Further, management makes no mention in its SEC filings of the “cloud ARR” metric discussed in press releases. Is this a more liberal or 
aggressive proprietary metric which management wants to keep from closer SEC scrutiny?

Recurring Revenue


“Recurring revenue, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP 
basis, is the portion of our revenue that we believe is likely 
to be renewed in the future, and primarily consists of initial 
and renewal post contract support, SaaS subscription 
licenses, and managed services, which are recognized 
over time.”


“Recurring revenue is the portion of our revenue that we 
believe is likely to be renewed in the future, and primarily 
consists of initial and renewal PCS, SaaS, term-based 
licenses, managed services, sales-and-usage based 
royalties, and subscription licenses recognized over time. 
The recurrence of these revenue streams in future periods 
depends on a number of factors including contractual 
periods and customers' renewal decisions.”


“Cloud revenue, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, 
primarily consists of SaaS subscription licenses and 
managed services, which are recognized over time.”


“Cloud revenue primarily consists of SaaS and managed 
services revenue recognized over time and term-based 
licenses, which are recognized at a point in time.”


“Cloud annualized recurring revenue ("ARR") is 
calculated using GAAP and non-GAAP cloud revenue 
excluding term-based license revenue recognized in our 
most recently completed three-month period on an 
annualized basis, plus term-based license GAAP and 
non-GAAP revenue recognized during the most recent 
trailing 12-month period.”

Refusal To Adopt Industry-Standard Performance 
Metrics Complicates Investor Analysis


As Neuberger notes in its proxy filings, Verint’s relative lack of transparency makes it difficult for investors to evaluate the performance of the 
business. In particular, Neuberger emphasizes that all of Verint’s most comparable cloud-oriented software companies disclose both organic 
sales growth and the gross margin generated by their respective cloud businesses. Why is Verint management reluctant to adopt the same 


performance metrics as its peer group?

Is This Really Even “Cloud” Revenue?


As is the case for most SaaS companies, the tacit benefit of “cloud” revenue for Verint is that it is in some sense recurring. However, we note 
that, per its 10-K, Verint includes in its definition of “cloud revenue” revenue from “term-based licenses” – i.e. revenue from contracts with fixed 
durations (typically three years for Verint). Many industry experts with whom we spoke do not consider such revenue to be “recurring” as it is 
generally understood with respect to cloud revenue, where “recurring” is generally used to describe subscription-type arrangements with no 


fixed life. Even further, many of these same experts do not even regard Verint as a true “cloud” company, as its “hybrid” cloud solutions are not 
truly versionable cloud-based SaaS services, but are better described as “off-premise.”


Is management being aggressive in its accounting definition of “cloud revenue ” to inflate what investors would believe to be true “cloud-based” 
revenue?

Inflating Reported SaaS Revenue With 
Revenue From Term Licenses?


In its presentation to sell-side analysts earlier this week, Verint management defined yet another new cloud revenue metric: SaaS revenue. Per 
the presentation, cloud revenue can be broken into “SaaS” and “Managed Services,” with SaaS including “primarily subscription licenses 


bundled with managed services, as well as, some term licenses with managed services sold separately.” Regardless of whether management 
believes that this term-based revenue properly belongs within “cloud revenue,” we certainly do not believe that term-based revenue should be 


included in “SaaS revenue,” which, to us, now presents a misleading representation of recurring revenue to investors.


Term license revenue is not SaaS revenue, and should not be reported as such

Accounting Implications Of ARR Definition: 
Booking “Cloud” Revenue Up Front?


By including within its definitions of “cloud revenue” and “cloud ARR” a term-based source of revenue, management also exposes these 
metrics to the effects of revenue recognition policy changes imposed by ASC 606. Under ASC 606, software licensees are “recognized at the 
point in time when control transfers.” By including term-based revenue within “cloud revenue,” is management inflating its apparent “cloud-


based” revenue and booking ~3 years’ worth of revenue up-front? Is “cloud ARR” really a meaningful representation of “recurring revenue” if it 
includes revenue “pulled forward” from future years of term-based contracts, perhaps rendering this metric naturally lumpy and creating 


difficult comps in future years?

Management Quietly Admits That ASC 606 
Adoption Accelerates Revenue Recognition


Management did in fact acknowledge in its FY18 10-K that its adoption of ASC 606 could accelerate the recognition of revenue tied to term 
licenses. However, it was ambiguous about the potential magnitude of the revenue impact, stating that it was “still in the process of quantifying 


the impact of the new standard,” but that it “[did] not expect the new standard to materially impact the amount or timing of the majority of 
revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements.” Perhaps its adoption of ASC 606 wouldn’t affect the timing of “the majority” of 
revenue – i.e. more than 50% of revenue – but this still leaves open the possibility that it could affect a very significant share of sales. We find 


management’s word choice interesting given its demonstrated history of picking its words carefully.

Double-Counting Revenue?


With its adoption of new revenue recognition standards in FY19, management stated that, in FY19, it recognized revenue “which had been 
previously recognized under prior revenue recognition accounting standards.” We have never come across such an egregious revenue


recognition maneuver throughout our extensive history of investigating accounting frauds and aggressive accounting methods. This level of 
aggressiveness raises questions regarding not only the validity of Verint’s reported FY19 revenue, but of the entirety of the Company’s results 


as reported.

Changing Business Practices To Accommodate 
Changes To Accounting Guidance?


In its FY19 10-K, management reports that it made “changes…to our business practices” in response to impending changes to revenue 
recognition guidance. Why would a company choose to conduct its business differently in response to new revenue recognition rules? We find 


it suspicious that management would allow accounting standards to dictate its business practices. This confirms our understanding that 
management is hyper-focused on meeting Wall Street estimates, perhaps at the expense of the health of the business itself.

64


Adoption of ASC 606 Revenue Recognition 
Standards Provide Powerful Revenue Tailwind


When transitioning accounting standards to ASC 606, management chose to use the “modified retrospective method,” under which it did not 
restate prior period results as they would have appeared under ASC 606. This gave Verint a ~$50M revenue tailwind in FY19 on our organic sales 


estimate of $1.1B, thus boosting reported sales by 4%. Earnings, meanwhile, grew by a full 73%! Management claimed that “business practice 
changes” undertaken in advance of adopting new revenue recognition standards – not the accounting change itself – were responsible for the 


large delta, and, therefore, that the FY19 results reported under ASC 606 could be compared to prior periods on an apples-to-apples basis. 
Spruce Point finds this defense extremely suspect, and believes that the impact of ASC 606 should be deducted from sales when calculating 


Verint’s organic growth.

ASC 606 Reporting Standards, And Impact On 
Financial Results, Not In Line With Peers


NICE, Verint’s most direct comp and competitor, also suggested that adoption of ASC 606 would not materially impact stated results. However, 
unlike Verint, Nice issued FY18 guidance under ASC 605 standards to provide “better transparency and comparability to 2017 financial data,”


and its FY18 results confirm that its adoption of ASC 606 had little effect on its financials. Furthermore – and importantly – NICE took a revenue 
penalty from the change, and saw earnings grow by just 2% (versus 73% for Verint!). Why did the adoption of ASC 606 have such a significant 


positive impact on Verint, whose accounting should be extremely similar to NICE’s accounting?

NICE Far More Transparent On Effects Of 
Change In Accounting Standards


Since NICE adopted ASC 606 accounting standards at the beginning of its FY18, its management team has been significantly more transparent 
on the impact of the change than Verint. NICE’s press releases, for example, disclosed results under both ASC 605 and ASC 606 standards 


throughout the course of the year. Further, and importantly, NICE provided an apples-to-apples comparison of current and historical financial 
results under ASC 605 standards, thus giving investors a clear view into organic changes in the business. It also provided FY18 guidance under 
ASC 605 standards for the same reason. VRNT’s reported results, meanwhile, did not provide a similar apple-to-apples comparison, as current 


results were reported exclusively under ASC 606 standards, against historical results reported under ASC 605. 


“With regard to the new 606 revenue accounting pronouncement, 
which is effective for us at the beginning of the current year, we 
do not see an overall material impact to our results, and our 
guidance already reflects the changes required under 606.”

Aggressive Accounting And M&A Allow 
Management To Achieve Performance Targets


We note that management beat its one-year and multi-year revenue targets by only 2% each in FY19. As we show on subsequent slides, we do 
not believe that management would have hit its targets after Verint results are adjusted for inorganic sources of revenue, income, and cash flow.


We also note that management uses an adjusted measure of revenue, operating income, and operating cash flow when setting compensation 
targets in its proxy statement, and that management would have failed to meet each of its targets except sales had it been measured against 


GAAP metrics.

Pulling Cash Flow Adjustments Out Of A
Magic Hat


Where is management getting its adjustments from? We can identify two “non-recurring payments” which management could have added back 
to operating cash flow totaling $14.8M, $7M less than the $21.8M of “non-recurring payments” which management added back to operating cash 


flow in its proxy statement. And why on earth are they adding interest expense back to operating cash flow?


Nowhere else in Verint’s SEC filings is this definition of operating cash flow used. Why should management use it to determine whether it met 
its compensation targets?

Management Compensating Itself For
Poor M&A?


As noted earlier, management has been taking large write-downs of contingent consideration liabilities related to M&A. This reveals that 
acquisitions have underperformed against initial expectations, and suggests that the deals were perhaps ill-advised. Yet, because contingent 


consideration write-downs translate to reductions of SG&A on the income statement, these write-downs are a benefit to operating income, and 
therefore increase management’s performance metrics against compensation targets. Why should management get credit for the 


underperformance of its acquisitions? Why are contingent consideration reversals not adjusted out of operating income for compensation 
determination purposes?

acquisitions, while at the same time demonstrably underrepresenting their likely revenue contributions…

Management Incentivized To Grow The Business, 
Not To Create Value For Shareholders


Spruce Point believes that management teams of acquisitive companies should be evaluated on the basis of return on capital deployed: 
measures such as ROIC should be used in place of revenue, EBITDA, and other metrics which incentivize growing the business over creating 


shareholder value. In fact, shareholders have petitioned Verint management to adopt ROI and ROIC as long-term performance measurements in 
place of revenue and TSR in each of the last two years – and, in both years, management refused.


“We recognize that ROIC has a good correlation to share price in many industries, however we do not 
currently use ROIC as an internal performance measurement and we believe that, where possible, 
compensation metrics should match the day to day metrics used to run the business. We also note 
that return on investment metrics like ROIC are not common in the technology industry where it is 
critical to continuously reinvest for growth and to maintain leading edge products. We continue to 
believe that revenue growth is the most significant driver of our business performance and we 
pair revenue metrics with profitability metrics to ensure that management is focused not only 
on growth, but on profitable growth.”


- Management Response, FY19 Proxy


“Consider using return on invested capital (“ROIC”) as a long- term performance 
metric instead of revenue or relative TSR.”


- Shareholder Request, FY19 Proxy


“Consider using return on investment (“ROI”) or return on invested capital (“ROIC”) 
as a long-term performance metric instead of revenue or relative TSR.”


- Shareholder Request, FY19 Proxy


Why is revenue growth “the most significant driver of business performance” when ill-advised M&A could destroy (and has destroyed) 
significant shareholder value?
73


Management Cherry-Picking Flattering Metrics To 
Justify Compensation And Defend Board Members


In response to Neuberger’s proxy filings, Verint submitted filings arguing that its “board-led strategy is delivering strong operational 
performance, financial results and stock price appreciation.” In defense of the latter, management posted returns on VRNT shares through the 


past one, two, and three years, over which VRNT has outperformed the major indices. We note, however, that this outperformance is erased 
when looking back over a longer timespan. Management’s strategy has changed little over the past decade – why should we evaluate


management and the Board on shareholder returns over the last three years alone?


We also believe that VRNT is more appropriately benchmarked against the software sector index, against which it has fared far worse.

Although NICE is larger than Verint on most metrics (revenue, EBITDA, EBIT) and more efficient (revenue per employee, EBIT per employee), 
average compensation per insider at Verint is over 3x that at NICE, and Verint insiders take home a far greater percentage of EBIT in 


compensation than do NICE insiders. This despite the fact that NICE shares have outperformed VRNT shares by a substantial margin through 
the past several years.

EBITDA Growth Driven By Cost Capitalization?


In FY19, Verint began to capitalize costs associated with commissions paid to its internal sales force, which are now recorded under “deferred 
commissions” within “other assets” and discussed as “costs to obtain and fulfill contracts” in Verint’s statements. Concerningly, Verint notes 


that it may amortize deferred commissions “over the expected benefit period,” giving management a great deal of discretion over the speed with 
which commissions are amortized. Spruce Point believes that shifting commissions to the balance sheet understates expenses and overstates 


earnings, and that Verint earnings should be adjusted downward to reflect this cost.

Widening Spread Between GAAP And Non-
GAAP Net Income


As is the case with many companies investigated by Spruce Point, Verint shows an increasingly large spread between GAAP and Non-GAAP 
income. In fact, in FY17 and FY18, Non-GAAP adjustments were responsible for over 100% of Non-GAAP net income. We believe that GAAP 


income is a far better measure of Verint’s economic reality than a Non-GAAP measure of income with ~$150M worth of management add-backs.

GAAP Net Income Non-GAAP Net Income


Net Income: GAAP vs. Non-GAAP


Recall that Verint’s adoption of ASC 606 was a 
$51.5M benefit to net income in FY19. The recent 


increase in Non-GAAP Net Income does not 
reflect organic profit growth.

Acquisition-Related EBITDA Add-Backs
Are Unjustified


On a quarterly basis, management recognizes significant EBITDA add-backs tied to acquisitions – specifically, “revenue adjustments related to 
acquisitions” and “acquisition expenses.” Spruce Point believes that, for a serial acquirer, acquisition expenses are an important cost of 
carrying out the company’s strategy and, as such, should not be added back to EBITDA. Meanwhile, the “revenue adjustments” represent 
prepaid services which an acquired business would be able to recognize over time, but which GAAP standards preclude an acquirer from 


recognizing following a deal. Therefore, not only do these added-back revenue adjustments represent inorganic sales which Verint will never 
see, but they represent added-back sales at an assumed margin of 100%. Spruce Point finds this maneuver particularly aggressive and gives the 


Company no credit for its “revenue adjustments.”

Revenue Adjustment Add-Back Out Of Line 
With Peers


While NICE also recognizes an acquisition-related revenue adjustment add-back in its calculation of Non-GAAP earnings, it offsets this add-back 
with a corresponding adjustment for the value of deferred costs associated with acquisitions. That is to say, NICE does not recognize its 


acquisition-related revenue adjustments at a 100% margin. Why doesn’t Verint do the same?

Even if you were to give management credit for the revenue adjustment for its representation of run-rate sales, it would be entirely inappropriate 
to give it credit for this as an EBITDA or net income add-back, since the revenue adjustment is a non-cash add-back and, at 100% assumed 


margin, is not representative of underlying earnings or cash flow from associated acquisitions.


Any investor using Verint’s Non-GAAP EBITDA or Non-GAAP net income to value the business – probably most of them – are capturing very 
low-quality components of Company-defined earnings.
83


Significant Share Of Non-GAAP Earnings 
Metrics Driven By Unusual Add-Backs


We also take issue with Verint’s restructuring add-back, NCI add-back, and “other adjustment” add-back. These represent add-backs of items 
which are consistent drags on earnings and, in the case of the NCI add-back, which are not available to VRNT shareholders.


In total, we believe that at least 11.4% of Adj. EBITDA are attributable to unusual and unjustified add-backs.

Where Is The Restructuring?


Verint’s restructuring charge add-back appears particularly suspicious to us. We note that management has never announced a formal 
restructuring program; rather, it defines “restructuring costs” as “employee termination costs, facility exit costs, certain professional fees, asset 


impairment charges, and other costs directly associated with resource realignments incurred in reaction to changing strategies or business 
conditions.” If Verint’s “restructuring” charge represents a recurring cost needed to adjust to “changing…business conditions,” why should it 


be added back as though it were a one-time charge? Is management trying to pass off a recurring expense as a one-time charge by naming it as 
such? Why is this item disclosed only in Verint’s press releases and investor presentations, and not in its SEC filings?


And why is the gap between restructuring charges and severance payments (disclosed in SEC filings) so large and inconsistent? Why did it 
suddenly decline just as severance costs jumped (and surpassed it)? Where is the restructuring charge coming from?

SEC Questions Management’s Add-Backs


We aren’t the only ones who find management’s add-backs questionable. In Sep 2016, Verint received a letter from the SEC questioning its large 
“other adjustments” add-back in its reconciliation between GAAP Net Income and Adj. EBITDA. At the time, this item included Verint’s 
acquisition expenses and restructuring expenses, both of which were broken out in documents filed following the inquiry into “other 


adjustments” at the behest of the SEC. Spruce Point believes that these items are no more transparent, explicable, or justifiable than they were 
when bundled under “other adjustments.”

“We note that the “other adjustments” line item is a significant adjustment in your 
reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Results, particularly for the year ended January 31, 
2016 and 2015. Please tell us the nature of the items included within these “other 
adjustments” as well as your consideration for further breaking out these items in more detail 
in your reconciliations. Similar concerns apply to the Form 8-K filed September 7, 2016.”


- SEC


“The “other adjustments” line item within our “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Results” 
includes restructuring expenses, acquisition-related expenses (including integration costs), 
changes in the fair values of contingent consideration obligations associated with business 
acquisitions, asset impairment charges other than those associated with restructuring or 
acquisition activity, rent expenses for redundant facilities, and gains or losses on sales of 
property. Detailed descriptions of these items, as well as the reasons why we believe these 
non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors, appear within the 
“Supplemental Information About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included within our 
quarterly earnings press releases and within presentations that we provide to investors. 
Please note that we reorganized and expanded the descriptions of the measures included 
within "other adjustments" in our most recent earnings press release, for the three and six 
months ended July 31, 2016, which was furnished on Form 8-K on September 7, 2016.


In recent reporting periods, approximately 80% of our total GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments 
have been comprised of amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock-based 
compensation expenses. Therefore, because the “other adjustments” comprise a lesser 
portion of our aggregate GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments, and because of the variety 
of different adjustments included within that line item, we have chosen to present 
those adjustments as a single line item in our reconciliation tables. We believe that 
breaking out the individual items comprising the “other adjustments” line item could 
unnecessarily clutter the reconciliation tables while only providing marginal benefit.
However, it’s important to note that, while we have not had the cause to do so in recent 
reporting periods, to the extent that the amounts presented on the “other adjustments” line 
item show unusual trends or variations between comparable periods, we would provide 
additional details to explain the trends or variations, through either footnote disclosures to 
the reconciliation, or by breaking out additional line items as appropriate.”


- Verint Response


Why didn’t management think investors would be interested 
in seeing acquisition-related expenses broken out for a 


serially-acquisitive company? Aren’t acquisition costs core 
to its business strategy?

86


Amortization Add-Backs To Net Income?


We also question why management chooses to add amortization of operating items – specifically, amortization of acquired technology, backlog, 
and other acquired intangibles – back to net income to arrive at its calculation of Non-GAAP Net Income. Why should these items not be 
reflected in net income just because they are associated with acquisitions? Do they not represent amortization for which the Company is 
responsible, like any other amortization borne by the Company (which is, of course, reflected in both GAAP and Non-GAAP net income)?


And why add back amortization of its convertible note discount when this represents a real cost of financing which the Company will ultimately 
have to bear?


Spruce Point believes that at least 45% of Verint’s Non-GAAP Net Income is attributed to unjustified add-backs.

Deep Ties To Comverse And Convicted 
Fraudster Kobi Alexander


Verint was born in 1994 as “Interactive Information Systems Corporation,” then a subsidiary of Comverse Technology, Inc., and was known as 
“Comverse Infosys, Inc.” from Jan 1999 through Jan 2002. Comverse was infamously involved in an options backdating scandal in which 


founder and CEO Jacob “Kobi” Alexander and other senior executives were convicted with conspiracy and fraud. Alexander promptly fled to 
Namibia, where he remained at large until 2016. Comverse was subsequently delisted from Nasdaq and removed from the S&P 500, and


struggled to recover from the scandal until it was broken up in 2012-13.


Importantly, Dan Bodner has served in his current capacity as President and CEO of Verint since the Company’s inception in 1994, and, 
accordingly, had close ties to Alexander. Alexander served as Verint’s Chairman since it went public in 2002 until he fled the country. Comverse 


CFO David Kreinberg and GC William Sorin also served on Verint’s Board, while Bodner himself served on Comverse’s Board in the period 
during which the scheme was alleged to have taken place.


VRNT S-1 - Feb 7, 2002


VRNT FY03 Proxy


When Verint first went public in 2002, its Executive 
Committee and Compensation Committee consisted of 
Bodner and the three key executives who plead guilty 


to fraud in the Comverse scandal: Alexander, 
Kreinberg, and Sorin.

Verint’s Long-Time CFO: Comverse’s CFO 
During The Backdating Scheme


We also note that Igal Nissim, who served as Bodner’s CFO at Verint beginning in 1999, was previously CFO of Comverse from 1993-98 – the 
same period during which Comverse was found to have engaged in options backdating. Mere days after the SEC formally filed charges against 


Comverse executives for the options backdating scheme, Verint announced a “CFO successor plan” in which it was announced that Nissim 
would be reassigned to an unidentified role – but not terminated. In fact, the press release announcing the change suggested that it was Nissim 


who requested the reassignment. Only after an independent investigation found Nissim culpable of overstating reserves and overseeing 
severely deficient reporting practices was Nissim let go. Why did Bodner go so far out of his way to protect Nissim?

Bodner And Nissim Close To The
Backdating Scheme?


How close were Bodner and Nissim to the backdating scheme? We note that both were named in lawsuits filed against Comverse in the fallout of 
the scandal, alleging that both personally profited from the scheme “while in possession of materially adverse information,” and that Bodner 


“participated in the issuance of false and/or misleading statements, including the approval of the false and/or misleading press releases and SEC 
filings.” These suits were ultimately settled after Alexander, Kreinberg, and Sorin together paid close to $70M (not including another $9.35M paid 


by Comverse itself to cover plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees).
92


Delisting Following SEC Filing Delays


In the fallout of the Comverse scandal, frequent delays in its submission of SEC filings resulted in Verint’s delisting from the Nasdaq exchange.


We remind investors that all of this occurred under President and CEO Dan Bodner, who remains President and CEO (and Chairman) today.

Dubious Business Practices Under Bodner


While an internal investigation conducted from 2006-08 concluded that Verint had not engaged in behavior similar to Comverse’s option 
backdating, the Audit Committee found that management had employed highly questionable business practices in the interest of flattering 


Company results. In particular, management purportedly attempted to structure customer agreements to permit earlier or later receipt of product 
by the customer “to avoid overshooting revenue targets.” It also found that, as did Comverse before it, Verint overstated reserves “to protect 


against unanticipated future expenses and to allow future flexibility,” and misclassified certain fees which should have been in COGS as SG&A or 
R&D – perhaps, as with Comverse, “to ensure that [its] expenses would appear to grow in a measured and consistent manner.” The Committee 


reprimanded Bodner for Verint’s business practices and recommended that Nissim, his long-time CFO, finally be terminated.


VRNT 03/20/08 8-K - Results of Audit Committee Investigation


“Verint learned that former Comverse Chief Financial Officer, David Kreinberg, 
had alleged, among other things, that Comverse reserves were manipulated to 
achieve desired earnings per share. Mr. Kreinberg further alleged that as part of 
the consolidation process, after receiving the reserve numbers from Comverse 
subsidiaries, he would speak with the subsidiaries’ controllers or chief 
financial officers to see if they could come up with increased reserves. Each 
subsidiary would, on occasion, resubmit the numbers to Mr. Kreinberg with 
greater reserves. According to Mr. Kreinberg, this practice was discontinued in 
the 2002 to 2003 time period.
These allegations potentially implicated Verint in three ways. First, because 
Comverse financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis, Verint’s 
operating results and reserves are embedded in those financial statements. 
Second, Mr. Kreinberg alleged that he communicated with pertinent 
personnel at the subsidiaries, including Verint. Finally, Mr. Kreinberg also 
indicated that the practice of manipulating reserves pre-dated his tenure as 
Chief Financial Officer. The Comverse Chief Financial Officer prior to Mr. 
Kreinberg was Igal Nissim, who served as Verint’s Chief Financial Officer 
from 1999- 2006.”


“The Audit Committee concluded that Dan Bodner, Verint’s Chief Executive 
Officer, or any other current executive officer of the Company, did not participate 
in unlawful activities or wrongful conduct. Nevertheless, the Audit Committee did 
note that the product revenue management practices described above, 
while not unlawful or violative of accounting principles, were not best 
business practice and should be remedied.”


“The Audit Committee determined that the Company’s personnel, including sales 
teams and senior executives, were focused on the Company’s budget and the 
need to meet or exceed budgeted revenue projections on a quarterly basis.
In that regard, the Audit Committee found evidence of the practice of seeking 
customer agreement to receive product either earlier or later than scheduled 
delivery dates depending on the Company’s budget needs in a particular 
quarter.
…the Audit Committee concluded that these practices allowed the Company, 
among other things, to avoid overshooting revenue targets, which may have 
signified unwanted volatility. That is, the Audit Committee found that it was not 
best business practice to have delivery decisions influenced by revenue 
recognition factors.”


“The Audit Committee found that, prior to the fiscal year 2002, which ended 
January 31, 2003, the accounting reserves were intentionally overstated 
during the covered period but not for the purpose of managing earnings…. the 
intent in overstating reserves was to build a conservative reserve to protect 
against unanticipated future expenses and to allow future flexibility.”

“Not Best Business Practice” Seems Like An 
Understatement


To us, the Audit Committee’s characterization of Verint’s and Bodner’s actions as “not best business practice” is a gross understatement. Under 
no circumstances would we be comfortable investing in a company and management team which has structured customer agreements to 


manufacture more gradual sales growth and which has purposefully inflated accounting reserves. In the Audit Committee’s judgment, Bodner 
and the Company “did not participate in unlawful activities or wrongful conduct,” but, given the nature of the claims, we wonder just close they 


came to breaking the law.


Is this really a company and CEO with whom you want to invest?

Management Falling Back Into The
Same Patterns?


Spruce Point finds it concerning that much of the behavior outlined in the Audit Committee investigation parallels behaviors which we observe at 
Verint today.


Parallels Between Past And Present Business Practices at Verint


Audit Committee Observations Regarding Prior Business Practices Spruce Point Observations Regarding Current Business Practices


Revenue Recognition And 
Revenue Timing Management


• Structured customer agreements to accelerate or delay timing 
of product delivery to reduce quarter-to-quarter volatility in 
reported sales


• Verint completes (unannounced) acquisitions mid-quarter and 
subsequently announces earnings beats without disclosing 
inorganic revenue contributions


• Reports suggest that management is focused on hitting Wall 
Street expectations over the underlying health of the business. 
Could encourage aggressive business practices to meet investor 
expectations.

• Management states that it changed its business practices “in 
anticipation, and as a result, of the new accounting guidance”


“Reserve” Management
• Accounting reserves intentionally overstated “to protect 


against unanticipated future expenses and to allow future 
flexibility”


• Management understates the likely inorganic revenue 
contributions of acquired businesses before issuing guidance 
raises in future quarters, likely aided by undisclosed inorganic 
revenue contributions


Questionable Conduct In 
Adoption Of New Accounting 
Standards Flatter Revenue


• “The investigation revealed no contemporaneously prepared 
documentation analyzing the adoption of SOP 97-2 and limited 
documentation analyzing periodic compliance with SOP 97-2.”


• Improper application of new accounting standards could have 
enabled management to continue to recognize revenue which, 
under new standards, should have been deferred “until all 
elements [of an arrangement] have been delivered”


• Relative lack of transparency regarding impact of ASC 606 on
revenue presents potentially false image of organic sales 
growth


• Adoption of ASC 606 permits up-front revenue recognition of 
elements of term-based software contracts. Improper 
allocations of term-based agreements to “Cloud Revenue” may 
have inflated cloud-related sales as reported

Current CFO Groomed At Another Legendary
Accounting Fraud


Douglas Robinson – Nissim’s replacement and Verint’s current CFO – came to Verint from Computer Associates (CA), where he had spent 17 
years in various finance-related and other positions. CA was found to have engaged in significant accounting fraud during his tenure at the 


company. In particular, the finance department was found to have participated in the process of “extending quarters,” recognizing revenue in 
periods prior to those in which products were actually delivered. Prematurely-recognized revenue amounted to $2.2B in FY00 and FY01 alone.1
While Robinson was not implicated in this scandal, which resulted in the company paying $225M in restitution to shareholders2 (in addition to 


$800M to be paid by CEO Sanjay Kumar4) and Kumar being sentenced to 12 years in prison,4 we find it concerning that Robinson spent so much 
time in a finance department which was shown to have cultivated a culture of fraud, serving in roles including Senior Vice President of Finance, 


Corporate Controller, CFO of one of CA’s subsidiaries, and Vice President in charge of internal audits (not specified on his Company bio).

Valuation And Downside Case
98


A Valuation On Shaky Foundations


Trading at 15.4x TTM EV/EBITDA, VRNT shares appear to be valued at a ~35% discount to the space on a TTM EV/EBTIDA basis, against the 
peer median of 23.6x. However, we believe that this valuation is misinformed due to the inorganic sources of revenue and aggressive add-


backs supporting management’s reported Adj. EBITDA, in addition to a broad misunderstanding of the Company’s true leverage.

Potentially Misleading Presentation
Of Liquidity


In Company presentations, management deducts four line items from gross debt to arrive at net debt: “Cash and cash equivalents,”
“Restricted cash and cash equivalents, and restricted time deposits,” “Short-term investments,” and “Long-term restricted cash, cash 


equivalents, time deposits and investments.” We believe that its reported liquidity of $445M and reported net debt of $350M as presented on 
its investor presentation are not representative of Verint’s true leverage. Firstly, we note that the two “restricted cash” items included in 


management’s calculation of net debt were explicitly said to be “not available for general operating use” in Verint’s 10-K. Why is management 
including these items in its presentation of Company liquidity?

“Other Assets” Should Not Be Included In 
Calculations Of Liquidity


Management doesn’t even include (B) “Long-Term Restricted Cash, Cash Equivalents, Time Deposits, and Investments” from the previous 
slide under the cash section of its balance sheet, nor in the restricted cash reconciliation section of its cash flow statement. Rather, it 
includes this item under “Other Assets” (see page 99 of the FY19 10-K to confirm). Why should investors include it as a component of 


liquidity when management won’t even represent it as a component of restricted cash, to say nothing of unrestricted cash?

Adjusting Cash Abroad For Repatriation Taxes


We also observe that, per management, $399.4M of its “cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash, cash 
equivalents, and bank time deposits (excluding any long-term portions)” are held outside of the U.S. While the non-restricted portion of this 
cash should be included in liquidity, it should be adjusted by the 15.5% cash repatriation tax enforced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. After 


estimating the amount of non-restricted cash and short-term investments held abroad, and making the above adjustment, Spruce Point 
estimates Verint’s liquidity at $345M, and net debt at just over $650M.

VRNT Trading More In Line With Peers Than 
The Street Believes


The Street believes that VRNT shares trade at a ~35% discount to SaaS peers. However, we estimate that VRNT trades just above the industry 
median, despite its chronically low organic growth, destructive acquisitions, and inability to generate cash flow growth despite frequent M&A 


– a stark contrast to the many fast-growing and highly-profitable true cloud businesses which occupy the space.

VRNT Trading Like A High-Flying
Cloud Business


We note that NICE’s transformative acquisition of cloud infrastructure provider inContact (Nasdaq: SAAS) in May 2016 valued the business at 
3.8x sales. At the time, inContact sales were growing at 30% annually, and its acquisition by NICE was largely responsible for its own current 


strength in the cloud infrastructure space – a major reason that NICE’s organic sales are growing at a high-single digit rate despite the 
headwinds facing the broader BPO industry.


Why does slow-growing Verint – a company with demonstrated weaknesses in the cloud and a seeming inability to grow organically through the 
last three years – trade at effectively the same sales multiple?

Why is slow-growing VRNT trading on par with the transaction multiple of inContact – a business which has fueled NICE’s recent organic sales 
growth of just under 10%?


Note also that inContact’s CEO chose to remain with the business following its acquisition by NICE – a vote of confidence in the future of the 
business and its continued growth as a part of NICE, in Spruce Point’s view. Meanwhile, what was supposed to be Verint’s transformative cloud-


oriented acquisition of KANA had already shown to be a flop just a year after it was completed.


Post-deal organic 
sales growth of ~8%


“This week we're celebrating three years since we announced the 
acquisition of inContact which was pivotal point for NICE and 
represented a seismic shift in the customer engagement market.
The acquisition and the ensuing delivery of CXone gave us the first and 
only true native cloud platform that seriously incorporates the 
marketing and routing, workforce optimization and analytics into a 
single platform for enterprises of all sizes. With all these assets 
combined together with substantial investment in R&D since the 
acquisition CXone has become the most complete platform in the market.


…It is clear that the execution of our strategy is working as reflected 
in our strong results, including in Q1, where we reported year-over-
year double-digit growth in all key metrics. This included a 12% 
increase in revenues to $378 million.”

BroadSoft in 2017-18. At the time, BroadSoft sales had been growing at a rate of 20-30% per year for three years running. Why does Verint –


whose sales, per our estimates, contracted in FY19 – trade at a sales multiple similar to that for which BroadSoft sold?

VRNT Trading Near All-Time Highs


Despite its technology falling behind competitors, and despite most growth coming from low-quality M&A, VRNT shares are currently trading 
near their all-time highs, and well above its historical valuation range. We believe that the market is incorrectly interpreting reported top-line 
growth as a signal that the underlying business is healthy. The Company is set up to disappoint investors not only as its ASC 606 benefits 


lapse, but as continued M&A fails to support cash flow growth or even longer-term sales growth without further value-destroying M&A. With 
Verint more levered than the market believes, the Company has less capacity for continued acquisitions than investors perceive, and 


aggressive insider selling leaves management with increasingly less incentive to manage the Company in the interest of shareholders.

Find Me A “SaaS” Company The Sell Side 
Doesn’t Like


The sell-side can see no evil in Verint: many of the same analysts who rated the stock a “buy” before its FY15 share price collapse from $66 
to $30 continue to cover the Company today – and, of course, they rate it as a “buy,” even with just 8% upside on the average analyst price 
target. This despite the fact that the same playbook is at play: buy poor BPO businesses to cover up slow to negative organic growth, and 
encourage cross-selling if possible (which it rarely is). The market’s ever-sanguine view of SaaS companies offers management a powerful 


incentive to boost reported cloud revenue, whether it’s really “cloud” revenue or not.


The sell side values VRNT on a P/E basis against Non-GAAP EPS. This approach fails to take into account Verint’s poor organic growth, the 
widening disparity between GAAP EPS and (low-quality) Non-GAAP EPS, and the Company’s failure to grow cash flow despite a flood of  M&A.

Verint Insider Ownership


Even as management talks up its anticipated cloud growth to investors, insiders have sold aggressively through the last several years. 
Insider ownership is now near an all-time low. As management grows revenue and earnings through frequent acquisitions while cash flow 


remains effectively flat, hitting ever-larger compensation targets and talking up Verint’s stock price on low-quality guidance raises, it appears 
as though insiders are using Verint as a vehicle for self-enrichment while destroying shareholder value through ill-advised M&A.


Why should investors buy into the cloud growth strategy if insiders won’t? 
Recent trades by CEO Bodner suggest that he thinks the stock is getting frothy…

Spruce Point Sees 60-70% Downside To
$17-25 Per Share


Even if the market simply applies its existing 15.4x EV/EBITDA multiple to our more realistic view of Adj. EBITDA and adopts our calculation of 
net debt, the stock could have 30% downside. However, with Verint not growing organically, we value VRNT on the basis of a forward-year 


EV/EBITDA multiple, but on trailing Adj. EBITDA. With faster-growing and higher-quality industry peers trading at 10-11x forward-year EBITDA 
multiple, we believe that VRNT should trade at 8-10x forward EBITDA, implying a share price of $17-25 for 60-70% downside.
