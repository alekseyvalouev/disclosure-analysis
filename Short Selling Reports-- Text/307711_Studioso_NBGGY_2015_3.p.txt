Summary


In	our	previous	article	we	explained	that	NBGGY	should	fall	below	$0.75,	given	the
issuance	of	4.88	billion	new	shares	at	a	price	of	0.30	EUR.


NBGGY	shares	were	delisted	from	the	NYSE	on	November	27,	and	last	traded	at
$2.41	($0.1609	pre-split).


NBGGY	shares	should	fall	at	least	another	72%,	to	$0.654	or	below,	most	likely
before	December	15.


Our	price	target	of	$0.654	is	calculated	as	2	times	the	capital	raising	price,	and	even
this	is	incredibly	generous.


In	our	article	on	Tuesday	November	24,	we	described	the	actions	taken	by	National	Bank
of	Greece	(OTCPK:NBGGY)	to	raise	capital,	and	explained	why	its	shares	should	fall
below	$0.75	($0.05	pre-split).	We	encourage	readers	to	review	that	article	if	they	have	not
done	so	already.


Recent	corporate	events


On	Friday	November	27,	a	mere	three	days	after	that	article	was	written,	the	NYSE
suspended	trading	of	NBGGY	and	delisted	its	shares	from	the	exchange.


On	December	3,	both	the	Athens-listed	shares	and	the	New	York	ADRs	completed	1	for
15	reverse	splits.


On	December	3,	National	Bank	of	Greece	ADRs	restarted	trading	on	the	Pink	Sheets,	with
the	symbol	NBGGY.


Recent	trading	data	and	updated	price	target


On	December	3,	following	a	3-day	trading	halt,	NBGGY	shares	recommenced	trading	in
Athens	and	closed	at	0.847	EUR,	approximately	equal	to	$0.9233	per	New	York	ADR.

7/19/2019 National Bank Of Greece Shares To Fall Below $0.66 Before December 15 - NATL BK GREECE SP/ADR NEW (OTCMKTS:NBGGY) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3734026-national-bank-greece-shares-fall-0_66-december-15 2/4


At	the	time	of	writing	this	article	on	the	morning	of	Friday	December	4,	NBGGY	shares	are
trading	at	0.673	EUR,	approximately	equal	to	$0.7336	per	New	York	ADR.	Although	a
price	of	$0.7336	represents	a	massive	69.5%	decline	from	the	November	27	price	of
$2.41,	NBGGY	shares	would	still	be	valued	at	well	over	2	times	their	capital	raising	price
of	0.30	EUR.


For	comparison,	let's	look	at	the	two	strongest	Greek	banks	that	did	not	require	state	aid.
Alpha	Bank	(OTCPK:ALBKY)	raised	capital	at	2.00	EUR	per	share,	but	is	now	trading	at
1.93	EUR	per	share.	Eurobank	(OTCPK:EGFEY)	raised	capital	at	1.00	EUR	per	share,
but	is	now	trading	at	0.93	EUR	per	share.


Of	the	big	four	Greek	banks,	both	NBGGY	and	Piraeus	Bank	(OTCPK:BPIRY)	required
state	aid	to	complete	their	capital	raising	requirements.	Piraeus	raised	capital	at	0.30	EUR
per	share,	and	is	now	trading	at	0.60	EUR	per	share.


We	update	our	price	target	for	NBGGY	shares	as	being	no	higher	than	2	times	the	capital
raising	price,	or	2	*	0.30	EUR	=	0.60	EUR	per	share.


For	ADR	investors,	this	is	a	price	target	of	no	higher	than	2	*	0.30	*	1.0900	=	$0.6540
per	share.


ADR	Convertibility


We	note	with	interest	that	on	December	3,	BNY	Mellon	re-opened	the	books	for	issuance
and	cancellation	of	NBGGY	ADRs.	This	should	ensure	that	NBGGY	shares	trade	closely
in	line	with	the	Athens-listed	shares.


Catalyst	for	decline


On	November	24,	NBGGY	published	a	detailed	timetable	describing	its	share	capital
increase.


On	page	3	of	the	SEC	filing,	the	company	announced	that	trading	of	the	new	shares	will
likely	commence	on	14	December	2015.


Once	the	4.88	billion	new	shares	are	issued,	then	it's	almost	certain	that	investors	who
bought	at	0.30	EUR	will	be	dumping	those	shares	en	masse	if	the	price	remains	above
0.60	EUR	a	share.


Even	a	price	of	0.60	EUR	per	share	seems	high,	given	it	represents	2	times	the	capital
raising	price.	It's	entirely	possible	that	shares	could	fall	to	0.30	EUR	or	lower,	in	a	similar
manner	to	Alpha	Bank	and	Eurobank.

It's	difficult	to	imagine	a	scenario	where	Athens-listed	shares	continue	to	trade	above	0.60
EUR	on	December	15.


Assuming	a	EUR/USD	rate	of	1.0900,	it's	difficult	to	imagine	a	scenario	where	NBGGY
shares	continue	to	trade	above	$0.66	a	share	on	December	15.

What's	the	point	of	writing	an	article	on	a	short	that	has	a	188%	borrow	rate	and	no	shares	to	borrow	anyway!?!?

Author’s	reply	» 	First,	it's	a	follow	up	to	our	previous	article	of	November	24,	to	cover	the	various
developments	since	that	date.
Second,	those	who	still	have	a	long	position	in	NBG	may	find	the	article	of	interest.
Third,	it's	a	good	academic	study	in	how	inefficient	the	market	can	be,	and/or	the	pervasiveness	of	the	'buy-
the-dip'	mentality.
