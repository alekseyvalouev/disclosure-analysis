Annie's: Overstuffed And Ready To Drop

by: Infitialis


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in financial markets in an
effort to identify bubbles before they implode. Investors in industries deemed popular or en
vogue by the general public have a propensity to engage in folly often resulting in the
manifestation of valuation bubbles of companies in those industries. As the great Charles
Mackay wrote in 1841: "Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they
go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one." Nearly two
hundred years later, these words are still relevant, as even nowadays men find it difficult
to act against the herd while the herd goes mad.


Infitialis: Track Record of Exposing Fraud or Folly is Unmatched


After our MLNX exposÃ© delivered >40% returns and successfully called the top on what
was becoming a cult stock and hedge fund hotel, readers encouraged us to focus our
considerable resources on identifying similar NASDAQ or NYSE listed equities. As a
result, we have spent the last two months examining thousands of equities in search for a
company that shared the same characteristics as MLNX: overly hyped, mathematically
irreconcilable in its valuation and exhibiting abnormal insider selling demonstrating a clear
misalignment with shareholders.


Introduction


In this report, we will present our short thesis on Annie's, Inc. (NYSE:BNNY). Founded in
1989 by a wife and husband team to produce natural macaroni and cheese dinners for
New England communes, Annie's, Inc. currently sells organic packaged foods, including
macaroni and cheese, snack crackers, and fruit snacks. Annie's balance sheet resembles
that of an OTCBB micro-cap, with less than $15 million in cash and only $42 million in
tangible equity, while its market valuation has been bid up to a shocking $740 million -
reflecting a ridiculous multiple of 123 times 2012 Free Cash Flow of $6 million. In

other words, shareholders purchasing today would have to wait over a century for the
company to earn the equivalent of its current market value. We believe Annie's is
materially overvalued and its stock will shortly trade in the $10-$15 range once investors
realize that everything about the company smells like a nasty bruksch.


Fundamentals


The Bunny Business


Operating in a simple industry and producing less than $7 million in revenue in 1999,
Annie's was acquired in 2002 by Solera Capital LLC ("Solera"), a New York City private
equity buy-out shop, at an effective cost of less than $6.00/share. In preparation for
Solera's exit from the business, Annie's became a public company this spring after Solera
turbocharged its revenue growth in an unsustainable fashion over the last few years.
Solera originally filed to offer 5.0 million shares of the Company with a $14-16/share
range, the road show price-talk was subsequently raised to $16-18/share, and finally
priced the IPO at $19.00/share. BNNY's stock proceeded to rise by 89% its first day of
trading, and is currently up 116% from its IPO pricing, making it one of 2012's hottest
IPOs. BNNY's lead book runner on the IPO was JPMorgan. As documented in this WSJ
article, Solera had a special relationship with JPMorgan with JPM even being a limited
partner investor in the Solera funds that own BNNY! This connection may explain why
BNNY was allowed to go public with such a tiny float and the fawning sell-side equity
research provided by the underwriters after the pricing.


Of the 5.75 million Annie's shares sold in the IPO on 03/29/12, only 0.95 million were
primary shares issued by Annie's; the rest were insiders happily selling out at an
effective price of $17.67/share after the underwriting discounts and commissions.
The IPO transaction was clearly designed as liquidity event for Solera as net of offering
fees and expenses. The Company raised only $11.1 million to pay the $1.3 million
termination fee associated with the existing Solera advisory services agreement and fund
its future growth. Solera sold 4.4 million shares for net proceeds of $78 million, adding to
its previously earned management fees and dividends of approximately $30.0 million from
the Company, which has resulted in the recoupment of more than 100% of its
cumulative investment in Annie's of ~$80.0 million.

Unlike the Annie's IPO pricing and trading experience, on Thursday, 10/25/12, the
WhiteWave Foods Company (NYSE:WWAV), the producer of the branded Silk soymilk
and other organic products, was spun off from Deans Foods (NYSE:DF) at $17/share
after an initial price talk of $14-16/share. However, while WhiteWave shares opened at
$19.00/share on the first day of trading, they quickly slipped below the IPO price, closed
the day at $16.75/share, and have generally traded below the IPO price since; as more
than 28.3 million shares traded on the IPO day, it appears JPMorgan, the IPO stabilization
agent, was quite active in the market attempting to support the share price on the first day
of trading. While WhiteWave's product portfolio has produced a similar growth trajectory
as Annie's due to the same secular trends and the company has a much more robust
corporate infrastructure and management team, WhiteWave is valued at approximately
12.5x forward EBITDA versus Annie's extremely rich 28.7x multiple. As WhiteWave is now
publicly valued by the equity market and provides investors with another pure-play
exposure to the organic and natural food trend, we strongly believe the relative valuation
gap between these two firms will quickly narrow with Annie's trading to the downside.


Insiders Don't Believe in the Bunny, So Why Should You?


Year to date, Solera and other Annie's insiders have dumped in excess of $200 million of
shares into the market, which is more than 1.3x the Company's 2012 revenue! This is
not a business being "built to last" in Jim Collins speak; it is being manipulated for insiders
to blast out of! First, on 07/27/12, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan, the lead book-running
managers in the Company's IPO, waived the original 180 day post-IPO lock-up restriction
for the Company's common stock held by certain Annie's insiders and shortly thereafter
earned an additional $5.9 million in underwriting fees on the secondary share sale. This
premature waiver allowed Solera and selected insiders to deluge an additional 3.2 million
shares on public investors as Solera further reduced their ownership stake in Annie's to
less than 38.3%. Critically, while Solera was prematurely reducing its stake in Annie's
before the expiration of the original lock-up agreement, the private equity firm was
simultaneously attempting to market a new ~$1bn fund, despite the relatively
unspectacular overall return profile of its precedent fund, based on its success with the
Annie's investment. At the current share price, Solera still has approximately $270 million
of unrealized gains waiting to be crystallized through its ownership of 6.5 million Annie's
shares. As we explained, the cost basis of these shares is now zero, as Solera has
already recouped its investment in Annie's.

Next, Ms. Ann E. Withey, the original founder of Annie's and the current "Inspirational
President" of the company, took advantage of the 07/31/12 lock-up waived secondary
offering to sell a whopping 42.8% of her remaining stake in the company for gross
proceeds of $3.3 million, which is a significant payday for a commune-dwelling organic
farmer!


Next, on 11/01/12, Ms. Sarah Bird, "Senior Vice President - Marketing and Chief Mom
Officer," Mr. Mark Mortimer, "Senior Vice President - Sales/Chief Customer Officer," and
Mr. Lawrence Waldman, "Senior Vice President - Supply Chain and Operations" sold
95.8%, 100.0%, and 100.0%, respectively, of their existing equity positions in Annie's at
prices of $40.57-41.09/share.


Finally, just three days ago on 11/06/12, Mr. Lawrence Waldman, exercised his 10,000
options with a strike at $8.88/share and immediately sold the shares for $40.10, netting a
profit of $312,200.


With Ms. Ann E. Withey and other critical members of Annie's management team even
more economically checked-out of the Company's operations and share price success, it
is difficult to believe Annie's will be able to further grow the organizational culture that has
monetized the "green" movement over the last few years.


Numerous Business Risks to Current Market Valuation


There are multiple reasons why Infitialis believes Annie's is highly overvalued. First,
Annie's future product growth is severely limited by the current organic sourcing capacity
constraints as it takes in excess of three years for new organic farming capacity to come
on-line and be certified; this physical supply constraint will likely constrain Annie's future
revenue and margin expansion ability. While the organic food supply chain may eventually
reach equilibrium with current demand, in the near term, this supply imbalance tilts the
competitive advantage to producers as opposed to manufacturers and presents significant
execution risk for the Company's management team.


Second, Annie's is only a couple of steps removed from its roots as a commune start-up
relative to most NYSE-listed businesses. For example, the NYSE recently threatened to
delist the Company for its failure to properly notify the NYSE and investors of its annual
shareholder meeting as required by the exchange regulations. In addition, the Company
has only 85 employees and only recently acquired an Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system to institutionalize the business planning and internal controls. Annie's plans
to hire aggressively (including sales, marketing, operations and finance teams), which
significantly constrains any hopes for meaningful margin expansion due to increasing fixed

costs. Annie's operational growing pains and managerial mistakes will likely continue into
the future based on the limited track record of the management team and operating
history as a public company.


Third, Annie's plans to take full advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements and
regulations for an "Emerging Growth Company" under the recent U.S. Congress JOBS
Act. The reduced disclosure and governance requirements of the JOBS Act legislation is
an unproven and potentially significant risk for public investors as it severely reduces the
securities regulations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, Solera held in excess of
50% of Annie's voting power as of the record date of 2012 annual meeting of stockholders
and then subsequently reduced its economic interest in the company to approximately
38.3% with the secondary offering of shares before the original lock-up expiration. Based
on this track record of trampling upon the rights of public shareholders, it appears there is
a continued possibility for the significant divergence between the interests of Annie's
insiders and public investors.


Fourth, Annie's operates a "capital light" business model and has outsourced ALL of its
product manufacturing and inventory logistics; Annie's clearly discloses "we do not own
any real property" in the footnotes of its SEC filings. While this operations model has
allowed the Company to historically generate impressive ROIC metrics relative to its
publicly-traded packaged food comps, this makes the business extremely susceptible to
third-party shipment delays, excessive price fluctuations for inputs, and potential food
safety issues. For example, in the quarter ended 09/30/12, Annie's purportedly missed out
on approximately $1 million in purported incremental net revenue opportunities because of
production planning shortfalls with its contracted manufacturers. If Annie's is truly
producing a "premium" consumer product worthy of a lofty price-point relative to
competing products, it seems the business should require significant control and
supervision over the production process; Annie's current share price does not allow for
any operational disappointments.


Product Problems


Annie's stated mission is "to cultivate a healthier, happier world by spreading goodness
through nourishing foods, honest words and conduct that is considerate and forever kind
to the planet." However, the stereotypical "upper-income suburban moms" that pay
premium prices for the Company's products are starting to realize the Annie's packaged
foods are really not that nutritionally different from traditional mass-market packaged
foods. For example, please compare the nutritional label information for the food products
(available via hyperlink):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/994821-annies-overstuffed-and-ready-to-drop 6/15


Annie s Mac & Cheese vs. Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Original
Annie s Cheddar Bunnies vs. Pepperidge Farm Cheddar Goldfish


Surprisingly, the products are almost identical in standardized nutritional content, with
Annie's actually slightly worse for consumers by several key metrics. For more than
double the price, "upper-income suburban moms" are paying up for an "organic," but not
necessarily healthy, food option. Before adding butter/milk, the Annie's Mac & Cheese has
24% of the recommended daily sodium (and assuming the average consumer only eats a
single 1-cup "serving," which is less than 40% of a single Annie's Mac & Cheese box). A
single serving of 50 Annie's Cheddar Bunnies have 6g of fat, vs. 5g of fat in a serving of
55 Pepperidge Farm Cheddar Goldfish. As the nutritional information between these
"traditional" and "organic" packaged foods is very similar and suggests to the
ingredients/recipes/formulas of the competing products are very homogenous. Thus,
investors should question if Annie's really has a sustainable competitive advantage in the
packaged foods market by essentially swapping traditional flour and dairy inputs for
organic inputs, placing a whimsical "Rabbit of Approval" bunny graphic on a standard
cardboard box, and marketing it as a significantly differentiated product on grocery
shelves.


Even more problematic for Annie's future growth prospects is the fact its premium product
pricing will limit future market share adoption of its products. In the current economic
environment, how many additional packaged food consumers are willing to pay a premium
of approximately 63% over the cost of comparable options for Annie's packaged food
products?


Annie's Premium Pricing Comparison to Traditional Packaged Foods 


Finally, despite a market perception otherwise, Annie's ability to transfer its premium
pricing strategy to additional products has been less than perfect. In the quarter ended
09/30/12, sales in the condiments and dressings category decreased 8.0% on a quarter-
over-quarter basis due to slowing customer demand and competitor pricing promotions.
Moreover, Annie's breakfast cereals line of products, launched with great fanfare in FY11,
was discontinued in FY12 after struggling to gain sales channel traction and failing to
"meet growth objectives."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/994821-annies-overstuffed-and-ready-to-drop 7/15


Valuation


In our view, Annie's is worth less than $20 per share (an aggressive 2.5x LTM sales, 17x
LTM EBITDA) to an acquirer. This valuation reflects over 1.5x revenue and 9.0x EBITDA
on an aggressive forecast for FY15, assuming uninterrupted high teens revenue growth as
well as 140bps of EBIT operating margin expansion to 15.0% from 13.4% in FY12.


While Annie's is continuing to grow, it is starting to show signs of its core products being
tapped out. After the DMD and GMCR situations, investors should be hyper-vigilant for
momentum-based growth stories as they start to exhibit signs of cracking. Annie's heavily
promoted its mac & cheese segment last year, so the Company's revenue growth has
decelerated this year and the management team seems to be pinning investors' hopes for
future growth more in the newly launched frozen pizza segment. However, the mass
marketing of frozen pizzas via Costco and Target seems even more of a stretch from
Annie's professed core competency of healthy organic food. If consumers truly want to eat
a healthy and sustainable diet, they would be better served sourcing fresh vegetables and
ingredients from their local farmers market, versus eating an Annie's frozen pizza, even if
it supposedly contains organic ingredients.


For a comparable acquisition valuation metric, Smart Balance recently acquired Udi's, a
gluten-free specialist that also produces frozen pizza, for approximately 1.7x revenue
($103.0 million net purchase price for $60.9 million in revenue). Moreover, Udi's doubled
sales in the fiscal year prior to its acquisition, so appears to be at least as juicy of a growth
story relative to Annie's LTM revenue of $141m. In addition, a valuation at 1.7x revenue
implies approximately $14/share for Annie's, which happens to directly correlate with the
initial IPO filing range. Also, Smart Balance (SMBL) recently bought Glutino for 1.2x
revenue, which would imply just a $10 stock price for Annie's. Smart Balance attracted a
13-D filing from Gabelli and has risen considerably, so although it is likely trading at a
"half-in-play" premium, the firm is currently valued at approximately 1.9x revenue (pro
forma for the recent Glutino and Udi's acquisitions). Even if Smart Balance's equity
valuation doubles from the current market price, and one utilizes an implied sales multiple
of 2.8x, a non-dilutive acquisition values Annie's at approximately $22/share.


As per the illustrative discounted cash flow valuation below, even utilizing the aggressive
growth assumptions of continued double-digit revenue extension, operating margin
expansion of ~140bps to 15.0% (significantly higher than its historical results and peers in
a highly competitive industry) and minimal CAPEX spend arrives at an intrinsic equity
value of less than half the current market valuation. Because of the disconnect between a
reasonable DCF valuation for the company and the current share price, sell-side equity

https://seekingalpha.com/article/994821-annies-overstuffed-and-ready-to-drop 8/15


analysts seem to be justify their lofty share price targets based on Annie's being a "a
possible takeout candidate (per CNBC, etc.)" and the purported "scarcity value in the
shares" [whatever that actually means].


Illustrative DCF Valuation - Assuming Continued Double Digit Sales Growth &
Margin Expansion


Moreover, because of the highly competitive nature of the packaged food sector, operating
margins generally remain range-bound in the upper single-digits to low-teens. Packaged
food producers must fight tooth and nail for shelf space at groceries and there are low
barriers to entry to prevent other manufacturers from cloning successful products made by
their peers. It will likely be difficult for Annie's to materially increase its operating margin
due to supply constraints for organic inputs, the Company's outsourced production and
logistics operational model, and the continued entrance of new producers with similar
products.


Conclusion:


Annie's insiders have been willing sellers at $14-16/share (initial IPO filing price-talk),
$17.67/share (IPO price), and $37.39/share (net secondary offering price) reaping over
$200 million while leaving the actual business with only $15 million to operate. Put
differently, the amount sold by insiders in one just year equates to over 50 years worth of
free cash flow. The math is irreconcilable; as such, we strongly recommend Annie's public

investors take advantage of these unsustainable prices before Solera dumps its remaining
6.98 million shares and the Company's overvaluation becomes obvious to the rest of the
market. Speculative investors should consider a short position as we believe BNNY
shares are more fairly valued in the $12-15 range.


***As we rush to print, we note two additional form 144s filed by Sarah Bird to sell 28,506
shares and Mark Mortimer for 38,000 shares. That's another $2.7 million worth of shares
to be dumped in the coming days.

Very nice article Infitialis, I was away when it was first published. However, I find it my job to address people
such as wulite! You know your comment leaves to a simple conclusion that you are a part of APS. How dare
you compare an offshore scam to a research report which is filled with facts and sources to support those
facts? I would bet my life on the fact that you are not American. I say this not to promote discrimination but
simply to highlight the fact that, only one who is not American would compare an alias that has provided 9
sound research reports to an offshore scam. I would like to emphasis what I mean when I say American.
When I say American, I am using this word as a metaphor for honesty, integrity, and hard work. None of these
characteristics apply to APS, yourself, and your comments. This also correlates with why you have only 2
comments in your alias history, both trying to discriminate against research reports which have exploited the
scam you are behind. I am writing this comment for a very simple reason; to get this person who is hiding

Nice Article Infitialis. Yes, this stock is in a huge bubble. I am also short.


I do think that consumers that are concerned with organic would probably look beyond the standard nutritional
information and be more concerned with things like antibiotics in their cheese, etc. That said, something is disclosed
as a risk in Annie's IPO prospectus is that they use bisphenol-A in their packaging! Hardly becoming of a company
with this kind of positioning...

Very nice report, not just on Annie's but some good insight into that entire "healthy foods (?)" sector.


I have long felt that the Annies and similar competing products were vastly overpriced - both in what they sell and in
their stock prices, so perhaps your article is partly a case of reinforcing my beliefs, but even then it looks pretty bleak.


One thing I cannot figure out is who is actually buying those stocks at those prices. Looks to me like it could be a 20-
cent stock in a couple years, yet there seem to be plenty of buyers @ $38

I really would like to buy in, it just seems so richly valued at these levels

Why did this stock tank 4% as soon as this article was published???


09 Nov 2012, 01:28 PM 


Dividend Growth Machine, Contributor
Maybe because some folks read it...

I would certainly hope a small SA article does not carry so much weight. Look at the volume spike! lol. Never
realized so many people jumped head first as soon as they read an article. Good stuff. Nice article by the
way, i eat Annie's products often.

They do, so sometimes you get those daytraders covering and you can short at a premium. Patience is gold.

i hope you are right but this one has to be most difficult stock to short. it just won't stay down for too long.... good
luck..

I just listened to the October 30th conference call, and thought this was strange. In a secondary offering this past
quarter, Solera sold shares ("there were no proceeds received by the company and no change in the share count") at
a cost of about $700,000 to the company.


Why is the company paying the fees for Solera to sell its shares? Is this something that happens in many PE-owned
companies taken public?

Outstanding article. I started shorting about a month ago, but very low volume in puts and calls

Good article. Well researched.

This is a really good article actually. I hadn't realized BNNY was bought up and then sold by private capital. That's
always a bad bad bad sign. Those operators know their businesses very well, and generally take unsuspecting
investors for a ride. Additionally the insider sales make it even more obvious.


I was actually curious about BNNY. I generally like their food, and it seemed to have a chart formation break out. So
this is very very useful

Awesome article! I'll be following you in the future, very good in depth analysis. Thank you:-)

Although BNNY continue to be an overvalued stock I actually closed my short today (20% gain)...I simply think that
what we've seen this week is temporary and that the market is headed up (including BNNY) thus prefer to wait for a
better entry point but the short view is still intact

Great article, thanks for the insight. I just don't see people paying 2x's or even has high as 5x's other products that are
almost the same on a regular basis. I could maybe see people buying a box once every few months because they
want to try something different, but 9 times out of 10 they are picking the cheaper brand or even the store brand. And
most people I know that are really into eating healthy and whatnot are not going to make mac & cheese a regular part
of their diet, no matter how organic it is its still not that good for you.


10 Nov 2012, 05:38 PM 


Barneyiknow
My ex wife used to buy their Mac and cheese at $2 a box because it was "healthy". Fast forward two years and a
divorce later and I'm feeding my kids Kraft m&c at $.50 a box (on sale) and my kids like it better.

This is a good article. Besides the obvious valuation issue the insight that management team and infrastructure to
grow the business just isn't there is the real issue IMO.

Found this article since I have a large short position in SMBL (trading at insane levels by all metrics and run by a
mediocre management team).


Very helpful info here so thanks; likely to get short Annies on any pop in the stock.

Brandon:


I don't know what price you shorted SMBL but hopefully it was in the upper 12 range and you have a profit. If
so, you should take your profit and get out. Steve Hughes and the Management team there are very astute,
experienced, respected and professional. They know what they are doing. The acquisitions of Udi and Glutino
were brilliant and for cheap dollars. The recent reorganization and missing the earnings by .01 cost them the
resultant drop in the stock price. But there are going to be some good things coming out of this company in
the next two years. The new name comes with a reason. Expect a spin off of the SmartBalance operation into
a separate operating Company and a small stock dividend. Udi and Glutino are going to have a major positive
impact on the bottom line. Have you seen these products in Whole Foods and Wal Mart stores? They are
prominent and are in demand across all classes of consumers.


This Company is in the very early stages of growth and they haven't really touched Canada or Europe as yet.
And the next acquisition will be a stunner.


Not a good time to be short.

The authors point is rather spot on in my opinion. Kraft already has launched an organic Mac and Cheese, as have
many other brands.


There really isn't much of a reason to take over annie's since the formulas are all rather straight forward (Pizza, mac
and cheese, etc) and they themselves have no facilities, distribution, etc. They are just a name on a box. The most

expensive name too. My children 4 and 6 eat Annies, but they notice no difference and say nothing eating KRaft
Organic or 365 organic mac and cheese (the whole foods brand instore).


Thats not great news for a company based on perpetual 20% growth and the highest margins in a hyper competitive
industry into which they have already expanded a great deal and are obviously running out of steam in their core
areas.


I am glad they discovered frozen pizza. Its like virgin territory in the supermarket for them to exploit...oh wait....

At one time a while back I was looking at Annie's, but looking over the product line I saw very little that was
unique, better, or had any other compelling reason to buy the products.


What killed it for me was when I ran across a nutrition comparison chart, and gram for gram, Snickers Bars
were better than Annie's Granola Bars. That and a few other things convinced me that the brand was built
more on hype than fact, and was probably not sustainable.

Nice work; good follow-up to Dan's call 2 months back which seemed to mark the top of this overvalued stock for now.
Outside of 50% year over year growth this doesn't pencil.

Thank you for the article. I am going to play it safe and wait for the stock to close below 31 on strong volume. Then
initiate a large bear spread. I checked-- and the Dec, Jan, Mar, and Jun options (both puts and calls) are thinly traded.
Presumably BNNY has been overlooked by the institutions.


The author makes many good points, but this one stands out-- "Annie's operates a "capital light" business model and
has outsourced ALL of its product manufacturing and inventory logistics".


As FYI, Annie's occupies the building at 1610 5th Street in Berkeley, CA- the former HQ of Clif Bar. Another company
that owns none of its manufacturing assets; and has all bars, beverages, and gels co-packed under 3rd party
arrangements. The 1610 location primarily housed marketing, QA/RD, and management. Some of the former Clif
employees are now on the BNNY payroll.


So if I might generalize- its the same crowd developing and peddling overpriced organic/natural/vegan products to a
similar consumer subset. How much organic mac n cheese, vegan snacks, and gluten-free dressings can fly off the
shelves at Whole Foods? These have all been flat to declining segments for Kraft and Unilever for years.


With 10% unemployed in California and a fiscal cliff looming- BNNY doesn't appear to have much upside.

Just read this article. One question: aren't you basing your FCF and net income numbers on 6 months trailing (ending
sept 2012)? I can't find FY numbers yet...


Also, I don't get a FCF of 6M...operating cash flow was 9,26M in first 6 months of 2012 and capex 1,0M. Again, these
are over 6 months...

Looks like metal fragments in pizza dough was enough to kill this stock.

Nah, I always put metal fragments in my "Homegrown pizza crusts" when I make them. :D
