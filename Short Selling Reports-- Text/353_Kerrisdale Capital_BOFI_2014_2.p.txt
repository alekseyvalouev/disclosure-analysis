BofI Holding: After H&R Block Transaction, Still Overpriced At Almost
4x Book Value
Apr. 16, 2014 9:00 AM ET13 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


BOFI is over-earning and overpriced, and the H&R Block deal doesn't change that.


Five other banks looked at the deal and passed or bid less than BOFI, indicating the
low value of the asset.


Prepaid-card issuing banks have much lower valuations and lower returns than
BOFI does today, supporting our view that BOFI's profits are unsustainably high.


Overview


BOFI's recently announced, widely expected acquisition of H&R Block's bank deposits
boosts its earnings but does not address the long-term pressures that will drive down
the company's currently inflated profitability. At almost 4x book value, as we have
previously argued, BOFI's super-premium valuation remains unwarranted.


At least five serious bidders besides BOFI vetted the H&R Block transaction, yet BOFI
emerged as the winner despite a complete lack of cost synergies. We question how
valuable an asset the H&R Block business can be when no one was willing to pay a
single dollar for it.


One of BOFI's responsibilities under the new agreement is to serve as the issuing
bank for H&R Block's prepaid debit card. Looking at the two major issuing banks
already operating in this space supports our concerns about BOFI's high valuation and
unsustainable earnings: they trade at half of BOFI's price-to-tangible-book-value
multiple, generate 35% lower net interest margins, and earn almost 50% lower returns
on equity. In a highly competitive market in which BOFI has little experience, its returns
should be weaker than those of the leading players. This peer comparison again
highlights the fact that BOFI is over-earning and will suffer long-term deterioration in its
NIM and ROE. Said differently, BOFI has taken capital valued by the market at almost
4x book value and invested it into a business valued at less than 2x book value. This
trade only makes sense if the original valuation was faulty and unsustainably high.
Otherwise, management is actually destroying economic value.

Meanwhile, recent earnings announcements confirm the dramatic decline in industry-
wide mortgage originations and profits. Since BOFI generates the vast majority of its
fee income and the bulk of its loan production in the single-family mortgage market,
these trends underscore the near-term risks to BOFI's earnings.


For those seeking to bet on the growth in online-only banking, BOFI is no longer the
only publicly-traded vehicle. In the wake of last week's IPO of Ally Financial, investors
can acquire the leading online bank - posting far more rapid organic customer growth
than BOFI on a >20x larger deposit base - at less than a quarter of BOFI's relative
valuation. BOFI again stands out as highly overvalued.


The H&R Block Transaction: Widely Shopped and Unlikely to Be a Bargain


It was no surprise when BofI Holding (NASDAQ:BOFI) announced that it was assuming
most of the deposits held by H&R Block (NYSE:HRB); the acquisition had been heavily
discussed by buy-side and sell-side analysts like. To be fair, one unexpected positive for
the company was the absence of a capital raise: BOFI management indicated that it
"expects no significant additions to regulatory capital will be required as a result of this
transaction." Rather than sell shares, BOFI is choosing to lever up its balance sheet and
tie up capital that could have supported core business growth instead of M&A.


While the market and the sell side greeted the deal enthusiastically, the history of the
sales process calls into question just how attractive a purchase this could be. HRB
originally agreed to sell its bank deposits to Republic Bancorp (NASDAQ:RBCAA) in July
2013. At that time, it said it had "talked to a lot of counterparties [and] received a lot of
interest." When the deal fell through in October because RBCAA failed to obtain the
necessary regulatory approvals, HRB spoke more expansively about its due-diligence
process and the set of alternative potential buyers (emphasis added):


So we, last fall, when we made the decision to move forward in this direction,
engaged Goldman Sachs and First Annapolis and they've been working with us
every step of the way. We ran a full process. So we talk to lots of interested parties.
They called us; we called them… You then narrow it down to a smaller group of
qualified people, have more detailed conversations. We then narrow that list down
further to about six counterparties and had in-depth detailed diligence two-way
type discussion before we narrow it down further and that sort of the end of that
process, we ended up with Republic.

Later, media coverage in January indicated that HRB had again narrowed the universe of
bidders down to six. Since BOFI has confirmed that it was one of the members of the
original short list, there must have been at least five other serious bidders who examined
the HRB transaction and decided either to pass or to bid lower than BOFI. But BOFI had
no real edge in bidding for this asset: unlike RBCAA, it doesn't have a history of offering
tax-related financial products, and unlike a firm like The Bancorp (NASDAQ:TBBK), it has
little experience serving as the back office for a prepaid debit-card program. Yet BOFI still
managed to win the transaction, suggesting that it was willing to be more aggressive than
its competitors and accept worse economics.


Notwithstanding the competitive and drawn-out sales process, HRB's deposits apparently
never garnered a premium bid. Established deposit franchises typically sell at a premium
to their liabilities - i.e. to obtain $100 million in deposits backed by $100 million in cash, a
buyer must write a check for several million. For example, just last week Huntington
Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) assumed $450 million in branch-based Michigan deposits
from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and paid a 3.5% deposit premium, or almost $16
million, for the privilege.


By contrast, RBCAA wouldn't agree to pay any premium for HRB's deposits, and BOFI
isn't paying a premium either. While the transaction isn't costless - among other things,
BOFI must put up capital to support the assets backing the acquired deposits - it surely
says something about the quality and value of HRB's deposit business that at least six
parties closely examined it and none was willing to pay HRB anything for it. Potential
buyers may have been unimpressed by the growth trajectory: in a rapidly expanding
sector, HRB's prepaid debit-card transaction volume grew only 3% in 2013, far slower than
the 20%+ that BOFI shareholders expect from the company's core business. Buyers may
also have worried about the regulatory and operational risks of dealing with tax refunds
and prepaid cards, both areas rife with fraud and money laundering. Whatever the
reasons for buyers' unwillingness to pay up, we doubt that there is much real value to be
found in a transaction that was widely and repeatedly shopped yet failed to attract a
meaningful bid.


Peer Metrics Point to Lower Returns and a Lower Valuation for BOFI


The key ongoing service that BOFI will provide to HRB is acting as the issuing bank for
HRB's prepaid debit-card program, Emerald Card. While this is a relatively new business
for BOFI, there are two large, established, publicly-traded competitors in the space: The
Bancorp, and Meta Financial Group (NASDAQ:CASH). For example, the prepaid card that
TurboTax offers as a way to receive a tax refund is issued by TBBK, while CASH backs

Western Union (NYSE:WU)'s card. Both companies trade at higher price-to-tangible-book
multiples than one would expect based on their modest returns on equity, indicating the
market's faith in the ongoing growth of the prepaid debit sector. Even so, TBBK and CASH
trade at massive discounts to BOFI, demonstrating just how overvalued BOFI is.


As we argued in our previous report, BOFI's net interest margin is unsustainably high,
temporarily inflated by well-timed securities purchases during the financial crisis along with
an outsized bet on low interest rates. Examining CASH and TBBK, the major incumbents
in BOFI's target expansion market of prepaid-card issuance, supports this view: they earn
substantially lower NIMs and, as a result, substantially lower ROEs than BOFI. Because
prepaid card deposits are fast-moving, CASH and TBBK - unlike BOFI - opt not to expose
themselves to major interest-rate risk and instead invest the deposits primarily in short-
duration assets. The more BOFI seeks to mimic this business model, the more its NIM
and ROE will come to look like these peers', driving profitability down and calling into
question its lofty valuation.


Economically, by investing its existing capital into a business like CASH and TBBK's, BOFI
is taking equity valued by the market at almost 4x its face amount and deploying it into an
activity valued by the market at less than 2x. It strains credulity to suggest that BOFI can
really generate twice as much value as its peers in this space despite these competitors'
strong, longstanding market positions. More likely, BOFI's current valuation is simply too
high and should, based on long-term fundamentals, move downward to be more in line
with its peers'.


The Mortgage Market, a Key Revenue Driver for BOFI, Faces Plummeting Volumes
and Heightened Competition

While BOFI shareholders have been focusing on the HRB transaction, other banks have
begun to report their first-quarter earnings, dramatically confirming what we already
expected: mortgage volumes are plunging, taking gain-on-sale revenue down with them.
For the largest mortgage banks, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase
(NYSE:JPM), volumes have dropped a staggering 67% year-over-year, while revenues,
driven by falling gain-on-sale margins, have deteriorated even more, down 80%.


For BOFI, these numbers are troubling because, on an LTM basis, mortgage gains have
accounted for 60% of the firm's non-interest income. Worse still, jumbo mortgage loans
constitute 64% of BOFI's pipeline of new loans (source: March 2014 investor
presentation). In a dramatically declining market, BOFI will be hard-pressed to sustain the
rapid loan growth that its investors have come to expect.


As other lenders look to replace lost volume, they are increasingly moving into the jumbo
market, putting further pressure on loan yields. Another indication of this trend came last
week when the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that "many lenders and investors
are providing borrowers seeking higher loan amounts with a broader range of financing
options by introducing new jumbo loan programs" (emphasis added). One factor that
has propped up BOFI's unsustainably high net interest margin has been a high yield on its
loan portfolio, including its jumbo mortgage. As more and more players move into this
niche, BOFI will experience narrower spreads and deteriorating profitability.


The Ally IPO Gives Investors a Much Cheaper Way to Play the Growth in Online
Banking


For some BOFI shareholders, owning the stock is less an expression of their view on
BOFI in particular than a bet on the overall growth in online retail banking. Almost every
other publicly-traded bank has some brick-and-mortar presence or material exposure to a

different business line; BOFI was as close to a pure play as there was. We don't doubt the
long-term trend of the declining importance of physical bank branches (though we note
that traditional banks have also benefited from this trend through lower operating costs
and diminishing branch counts).


But in the wake of Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY)'s recent IPO, BOFI is no longer the only
available pure play. Unlike BOFI, ALLY has a nationally recognized brand and, with over
1.5 million retail deposit accounts (source: ALLY IPO prospectus), substantial economies
of scale. Despite its vastly greater size, ALLY is actually increasing its customer base
more rapidly than BOFI: ALLY's accounts increased by 24% in 2013, while, as we pointed
out in our previous report, BOFI's accounts, excluding the benefit of an acquisition,
actually decreased over the same period.


ALLY certainly has its own challenges and undoubtedly a worse financial track record than
BOFI. But this fast-growing, well-regarded online banking franchise (named "Best online
bank" by Money out of a field of 15 competitors) trades for just 0.9x tangible book value -
less than a quarter of BOFI's multiple. While we respect the competence of BOFI's
management team, we find it difficult to believe that they merit quadruple the relative
valuation of their leading competitor. BOFI's stretched valuation creates asymmetric risk
for shareholders: it already prices in flawless execution, high returns, and rapid growth.
Those aiming to invest in the secular theme of online banking can do so dramatically more
cheaply by buying ALLY than by buying BOFI.


Conclusion


By levering up to acquire HRB's bank deposits, BOFI has increased its earnings power,
but it has done little to alter the fundamental dynamic that should compress its valuation
over time: it's over-earning because its NIM is unsustainably high. Close comparables,
including TBBK, CASH, and ALLY, already earn substantially lower margins and trade at
substantially lower multiples. The larger BOFI becomes, the harder it will be for it to find
new niche markets to prop up its profits. Already, the major focus of its expansion efforts in
the past several years - the single-family mortgage market - is coming under severe
pressure, threatening near-term profits and growth. At nearly 4x book value, BOFI's
current valuation incorporates extremely rosy expectations, leaving shareholders at great
risk of disappointment.

Still trying? That's the spirit. Unfortunately for you the eps estimates have gone up 22% as no dilution. That is what
banks do--they acquire banks that are accretive to earnings. Book value will be $33 by calendar year end 2015. It is
$22.80 as of the end of Q1 which is already over. That is 30% compound growth. Yes that is right, they will earn
$10.20/shr in the next 19 months. There is no dividend, so BV grows very fast. At todays price we are selling at 2.4x
that $33 BV. We will be selling at 3.5x that BV at 12/2015 and we will get a 45% ROR (price of $115 at 12/15). The
KRE bank stock fund is selling at 2.2x tangible book value today (and 1.6x stated BV) and grows at 8%. You can do
the math as which one is a better buy. There is execution risk over a diversified fund but the return is worth the risk.


This is a tiny fast growing disruptive bank. It does not even have even .2% market share in an age where branches
are closing because of mobile bill pay and smart phone deposits (Mitek software). Banking is going virtual and it is
unwise to stand in front of that trend. BOFI is the leader in that trend.


Since your last copy cat article did not work for you, I assume you are using this one to cover your short. Don't wait
too long.

BY the way, you neglected to mention that we are selling 14x the 6/2105 estimate which is less then the KRE index
and less than the S&P500. Grow is worth a lot in a 2% GDP economy.

Tesla is 36 x book value and the stock keeps going up. I do not own Tesla and would not consider owning it. However,
BOFI at less than 4 times book value is a steal because it's earning power is not yet defined. Don't be swayed by
short seller arguments. They make their money getting you to sell out prematurely. I do not know where this stock is
going, but I know if you listen to short sellers you will always make a mistake. Listen to what is in your head and heart.

the continual harping on book value makes little sense. US Bancorp has sold for a greater multiple of book value than
Bank of America. It is a more profitable bank.Gary Garabants has shown that he can operate a better bank than the
so-called comparables. An ex Mckinsey partner he also has made very sharp strategic moves.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  US Bancorp is a great company and an interesting example. Back in 2001, it had a valuation
a bit shy of BOFI's: 3.4x book value. And it had a trailing return on equity a bit better than BOFI's: 24%. From
then till now, though, the ROE has compressed 43%, to 14%. And, sure enough, the price-to-book multiple
has also compressed, down to 2x -- a 42% decline.* As a result, the stock has only appreciated 4% a year
over that 13-year period. It's still well-run and still has a premium valuation, but that doesn't mean it was a
fantastic investment. The bank business is very competitive; even with a talented management, BOFI won't
sustain super-normal returns forever, particularly as its asset base grows.

If you think the financial crisis will repeat the same way. Otherwise your comment adds nothing. WE have

industry resistant to change), in the midst of a bull market. If Kerrisdale must go against the market trend and short
something in a bull market, why not pick a failing brand in a failing industry...a JC Penny or something like that? I
hope you have very tight stops. You're late to the BOFI short party anyway. Short interest over 7.5%. You should have
done it when BOFI was short term climax-topping at $105. Where were your articles then?

I thought that book value was one way of valuing a company if for some reason temporarily, they were not making any
money. If you totally liquidated all the company's assets this would be book value.  
A chocolate company like Sees Candy is highly profitable, and their machines are depreciated down to nothing. They
don't need to come up with new products. They don't need to buy new machines. Book Value may be low. If you
liquidated the company, they wouldn't be able to sell the machines for very much. They are old machines. But boy,
Sees Candy is profitable.


However, the company is doing well. BOFI is generating profits. These profits are being plowed back into the
company to compound. A P/E ratio of a regular bank may be 12. But that bank is growing a 10% at best. A bank that
is growing at 30% per year should that have a higher P/E? I want to own that business!


Buffet says the low cost leader wins! 
I don't think that book value is a good metric to value BOFI. It does not fit the problem at hand.


I know this is simplistic but I am simple.

P/B metrics and P/E ratios have always ebbed and flowed in their relevancy to the valuation of banks..especially
smaller institutions.... P/B matters during poor economic times (slowing, contracting).... P/E ratios matter for every
other (recovering,growing). P/B matters for mature/stable companies...P/E ratios matter more for high growth/volatile
companies....


Which one is BOFI? What is the economy doing?
