Summary:  Yangtze River Port & Logistics
(NASDAQ:YRIV)


We are of the strong opinion that Yangtze River Port & Logistics is a scheme run by its


Chairman & controlling shareholder to siphon money away from U.S. public markets.


YRIV’s only operating entity has been declared insolvent in China and is involved in


multiple undisclosed legal proceedings, it has also been ordered to pay back at least $110


million in defaulted loans. YRIV fails to disclose the existence of these lawsuits &


judgements in its SEC �lings.


Based on government-sourced documents and interviews with local o�cials, we believe


that at least 77% of the company’s reported assets are fabricated.


Speci�cally, YRIV claims to lease 1.2 million sq/m of land from a village that is only 610


thousand sq/m in size. Our investigator spoke to the village committee and they denied


that any lease existed. This lease accounted for ~77% of YRIV’s balance sheet assets.


On the ground visits to YRIV’s construction project during business hours on multiple


occasions have shown virtually no signs of business activity aside from a lone gate guard.


Cash from recent capital raises; has been siphoned to the CEO/controlling shareholder via


related-party entities rather than deployed towards the company’s supposed construction

Yangtze River Port & Logistics: Total Zero.
On-the-Ground Research Shows Assets
Appear to be Largely Fabricated

projects. Based on our �ndings we think YRIV is a total zero.


Introduction


We believe that Yangtze River Port & Logistics (NASDAQ:YRIV) is an arti�ce designed to enrich


the company’s Chairman & controlling shareholder. The company currently trades at a market


cap of about $2 billion as of this writing. We are con�dent that it will ultimately be delisted and


that every penny of its market cap will be wiped out.


The company has generated no revenue over the past 3 years


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018002769/f10k2017_yangtzeri


ver.htm#a_013) and its U.S. headquarters is based out of a New York City apartment


(https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2017/06/13/the-2-4-billion-nasdaq-stock-


headquartered-in-apartment-2a/#7d7acae0730c). Site visits to the company’s Chinese


properties, interviews with local o�cials, and a detailed examination of Chinese and U.S. �lings;


lead us to believe that the company’s assets have either been grossly exaggerated or are


largely fabricated.


Our report includes several areas of research that are either completely new or not fully


covered in other reports. These should help investors �nally put the pieces of the puzzle


together to reach the same conclusions we have reached about YRIV:


1. Worthless / Overin�ated Assets


YRIV has essentially one project called the Wuhan Yangtze River New Port Logistics Center:


The constructed part of the project is a cluster of commercial buildings. The company


claims that 4 of the buildings in the complex are completed, ( F-12


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018015241/f10q0918_yan


gtzeriver.htm)) yet they have failed to produce any revenue from them. A site visit to the


properties during working hours found them to be a veritable ghost town; with no signs


of activity aside from a gate guard.


The unconstructed part of the project is a planned “Logistics Center” that YRIV states it will


build on 1.2 million square meters of land leased from a local village. On YRIV’s latest


quarterly balance sheet, the rights to the land are reported as having a value of $299


million, comprising over 77% of the company’s total assets. ( F-13

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
government-sourced maps


(http://www.tcmap.com.cn/hubei/xinzhouqu_yangluojie_chunfengcun.html) show that the


total area of the village is only 610 thousand square meters. Moreover, conversations


with o�cials from the village in question revealed that contrary to the company’s claims,


YRIV has not leased any land from them.


2. Undisclosed Legal Judgements


Despite the company’s SEC �lings, which state that there are no material legal proceedings


against the business, we found Chinese court records showing that the company has at least


11 judgements �led against them totaling RMB 766 million (USD $110 million).


The company reports total assets of $386 million in its SEC �lings (pg. F-1


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018015241/f10q0918_yangtzeri


ver.htm)), but we found local court records showing that creditors were unable to locate assets


to seize in their attempt to satisfy one of YRIV’s multiple legal judgements. The Chinese court


has recently taken the extraordinary step of placing the company on its list of “untrustworthy


debtors” due to its mass of unpaid judgements.


3. Cash from Capital Raises Have Gone Right to the Chairman


The company issued 19 convertible notes this year alone. (pg. F-16


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018015241/f10q0918_yangtzeri


ver.htm)) So where did the money go? Rather than using the proceeds of these notes to


advance the company’s purported real estate projects, money instead has gone directly to


related-party entities a�liated with the company’s Chairman & controlling shareholder,


Liu Xiangyao. Proceeds from past capital raises have similarly ended up being diverted to


Xiangyao.


Background


Yangtze River Port and Logistics Limited, is a Nevada holding corporation that originally


became public via a reverse merger in December 2015 (pg. 6


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018012230/fs32018a4_yangtzer


iver.htm)). YRIV operates through its wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, Wuhan Yangtze River


Newport Logistics Co., Ltd (“Wuhan Newport”).

The company recently attempted to reverse merge into a di�erent entity called Wuhan


Economic Development Port Limited (the “Wuhan Port”). The deal fell apart shortly after a


Barron’s article (https://www.barrons.com/articles/a-troubled-chinese-company-is-seeking-a-


lifeline-from-u-s-investors-1535369739) questioned the deal’s bizarre rationale:


“It’s puzzling that Yangtze’s board and controlling shareholders want to exchange the


Wuhan project for assets worth a mere quarter of company’s total market value. Since


last December, Yangtze has been trying to complete a deal in which it would pay $90


million to swap everything it owns for another riverfront business in Wuhan that the


company’s own �lings appraise at just $454 million. That would appear to leave


Yangtze stockholders with something worth just $3 a share.”


On the ground due diligence regarding YRIV’s business operations was completed in the


summer of 2018 and we concluded that YRIV’s Wuhan Newport is collectively worth nothing.


We waited to see how the deal played out (it eventually collapsed), which leaves Wuhan


Newport as the sole operating entity of the company. (pg. F-5


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018015241/f10q0918_yangtzeri


ver.htm)) We then followed up with another site visit yesterday to re-con�rm our �ndings.


Evidence Shows That YRIV’s Claim to Its Main
Asset Is Likely Fabricated


The unconstructed part of the project is referred to as the Logistics Center, from which YRIV


anticipates their “main source of expected income will be derived.” (pg. 3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018012230/fs32018a4_yangtzer

Under Development.” These assets consist of the Wuhan Centre (the company’s other real


estate project) and “Land lots undeveloped”, which, by inference, is the Logistics Center:


Given that the company reports total assets of $386 million (pg. F-1

The Logistics Center is intended to be built on 1.2 million square meters of land leased from


Chunfeng Village. The most recent 10-K highlights this (pg. 33


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018002769/f10k2017_yangtzeri

On YRIV’s website (http://www.yerr.com.cn/), a promotional video


(http://www.yerr.com.cn/video.html) displays the 1.2 million square meter leased land area at


the 10:51 mark in describing its proposed location of the Logistics Center:


Our �rst clue that something was amiss came from the Hubei Provincial Government


(http://www.tcmap.com.cn/hubei/xinzhouqu_yangluojie_chunfengcun.html) sourced records,


which show that the total area of Chunfeng village is 610,000 square meters; only half the


size of the area YRIV claims to lease from the village:


Our on the ground team visited the village to inquire with local o�cials about the discrepancy.


Here are some photos of the village, and of the Chunfeng Village Committee from the visit of


our due diligence team:

Our team spoke with o�cials in the village committee and asked about their relationship with


YRIV. When asked if they leased any land to the company, they replied that they had not. We


also con�rmed that the village is currently only 0.61 square kilometers.


Given the above, it comes as no surprise that the company has reported that its Logistics


Center has been stalled for at least three years. The company’s last three 10-Ks describe the


anticipated completion of construction on the Logistics Center and show literally zero progress:

Going one level deeper, we found further evidence that the company’s “plan” to build a 1.2


million square meter facility on a plot of land half that size did not comport with geographic


reality.

After consulting with local authorities and villagers, the on the ground team learned that most


of the area YRIV claimed to lease from Chunfeng Village actually belongs to Junming Village (军
民村), Jiangdi Village (江堤村) and/or the Huayou Pipe Base (华油管道基地). Chufeng Village
barely overlaps with the area YRIV claims to lease.


We marked up an area map as shown below taken from Google Maps:


All told, we think the supposed leased land for the Logistics Center is a total fabrication.


YRIV’s Constructed Part of the Project Looks
Abandoned: We Found Virtually No Signs of
Commercial Activity During Our Site Visits


YRIV’s constructed part of the project is a commercial building project formerly called the


Wuhan Centre China Grand Steel Market. The project claims to cover an approximate


construction area of 222,496.6 square meters (pg. 3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018012230/fs32018a4_yangtzer

building space relating to this project.


The company’s latest 10-Q reports an asset value of over $76 million for the completed and in


progress buildings and the land use rights related to the constructed part of the project. (pgs.

After visiting the project site our team found that while some of the buildings do indeed look


completed, the area appears to have been abandoned. Our �rst visit was in June 2018 during


business hours. Our team saw no signs of commercial activity except for a gate guard. The


team saw no other people, saw empty buildings with no movement inside, and heard no


sounds that would indicate activity. Some of the properties were overgrown with shrubbery.


Overall, the site struck us as a small ghost town. For accuracy, we visited again the site within


24 hours of publishing this article. Here are some photos from the recent visit to the site from


24 hours ago:

fact the case: the company’s operating subsidiary, Wuhan Newport, has so many claims and


default judgements against it that it has been declared insolvent in China, according to our


search of Chinese court databases.


In just one example, China Construction Bank is litigating with YRIV’s operating subsidiary,


Wuhan Newport, regarding $44 million in loans to the company. The loan is disclosed in YRIV’s


�lings (pg. F-17

The plainti� (China Construction Bank) disbursed the loan payment RMB 290 million (USD 44


million) to YRIV on May 30, 2014.  However, YRIV did not repay the interest and principal and


the guarantor (Renhe Corp. the former shareholder of YRIV) did not perform its guarantee


obligation. YRIV and Renhe Corp. were already involved in severe litigations.


In addition to the above mentioned China Construction Bank litigation, in 2018 (February 27,


2018 to July 27, 2018), Wuhan Newport was subjected to at least 11 �nal judgements


(https://www.qichacha.com/�rm_55e3d7001606c5773ec7aa76d61b24d5.html#susong) totaling


RMB 767,132,632:


As Wuhan Newport cannot repay its legal obligation under these judgements, it has been


added to the local list of dishonest judgement debtors. This means that in the event that


Wuhan Newport (the operating subsidiary of YRIV) receives any investment money from its


investors, it’s already earmarked to ful�ll its outstanding debt.


Barron’s recently reported (https://www.barrons.com/articles/a-troubled-chinese-company-is-


seeking-a-lifeline-from-u-s-investors-1535369739) on some of the company’s litigation issues


and asked the company why they were not disclosed to investors. The company’s rationale was


that those issues would disappear once it closed the asset swap deal with Wuhan Port:

“Asked about these cases, Yangtze told Barron’s that its SEC �lings don’t mention the


bank’s court award because Yangtze’s proposed asset swap will unburden it of the


Newport unit. ‘[I]f the sale is successful,’ the company said in an email responding to


our questions, ‘the Purchaser will be responsible for repaying the loan to the bank.’”


“…Yangtze’s planned exchange of businesses will cure all these headaches, director


Coleman said in an interview. ‘All the liabilities associated with the old project, bank


loans and what not, transfer completely over to the new owners,’ he told Barron’s.


‘Any and all of these issues are then gone.’”


The latest S-3 registration statement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390018012230/fs32018a4_yangtzer


iver.htm) �led by the company, shows that the contemplated business exchange referenced by


the company in the Barron’s article has been terminated.


Yet, despite the termination of the company’s “excuse” for not disclosing its ongoing material


legal proceedings, the company claims in the very same �ling that they are not involved in any


material litigation:


“We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially


adverse e�ect on our �nancial condition or results of operations.”


In its most recent 10-Q, without the asset swap deal, the quarter re�ected YRIV’s third quarter


business operations. The company continues to claim that YRIV does not have any litigation


and, of course, YRIV did not disclose the RMB 767 million (USD 110 million) in outstanding


judgements against its main operating subsidiary, Wuhan Newport.


We think that the above is the most obvious 10b-5 Securities Exchange Act


(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule10b5.asp) violation since “Funding secured”, and


we believe that it could result in a halt of YRIV shares at any time.

As we stated before, as YRIV’s operating entity, Wuhan Newport, has been labeled as a


dishonest judgement debtor, and money that goes to Wuhan Newport will be used to ful�ll its


outstanding legal judgements. Therefore, we believe it is impossible for Wuhan Newport to


come up with cash to continue its logistics center project.


So where does all the new cash go? YRIV has consistently reported large liability balances “due


to related parties” on its �nancial statements. These in turn seem to accrue large interest rates


which simply get added to the “advances” over time. When capital is raised, cash is then used


to pay back the supposed related-party “advances”, rather than being employed to further the


company’s projects.


In the September 2018 quarter alone, the CEO and controlling shareholder, Liu Xiangyao, was


“repaid” $6.2 million dollars both directly and through an entity he controls called Jasper Lake


Holdings (“Jasper”):

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In the June 2018 quarter, the CEO was “repaid” $1.3 million, along with another $3 million in the


March 2018 quarter.  Based on the disclosure, the total amount of those 19 convertible notes


amounted to $8.5 million, of which $3.39 million is outstanding while $5.15 million has been


redeemed.  We can therefore infer that raised cash from these convertible notes went to the


Chairman, not to the business operations of YRIV.


These supposed repayments are not new for YRIV. In fact, �nancials presented as part of YRIV’s


reverse merger show that the company took out a $47.2 million construction loan from China


Construction Bank in the year ending December 2014 (pg. F-16


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390016010526/f10k2015_yangtzeri


ver.htm)).


The company turned around and paid out all of it as a “repayment to related parties” (pg. F-6


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1487843/000121390016010526/f10k2015_yangtzeri

Based on these observations, we believe that YRIV is largely a shell which exists to raise more


capital for the personal use of its controlling shareholder and chairman.


Conclusion: We Think Yangtze River Port &
Logistics Is Worth Nothing


Over the last decade, numerous China-based companies have been ousted from U.S. markets.


Generally, the most egregious cases occur when companies funnel wealth and value from


shareholders to insiders. Since the implosion of the U.S. listed China-based space between


2010 and 2014, we didn’t think we would ever come across such obvious cases again.


To anyone who thinks the China Hustle (https://www.thechinahustle�lm.com/) has ended:


We encourage you to consult an o�cial map


(http://www.tcmap.com.cn/hubei/xinzhouqu_yangluojie_chunfengcun.html), which clearly


shows that the Chunfeng Village is only 610,000 square meters in size despite the


company claiming to lease 1.2 million square meters of land from them.


We encourage you to review the readily available �lings from Chinese courts showing the


litany of judgements against the company that are undisclosed in their SEC �lings.


We encourage you to simply visit the apparently empty cluster of buildings it claims to be


of great value.


Best of luck to all

Since you are shorts, of course this is manipulated rather than someone without a position.


This article is therefore written in your best interest. Also just the title shows manipulation. “Is


worth NOTHING”. If you know anything about shell companies, they are worth something. They


are shells looking for public companies to reverse merge and trade on NASDAQ at a premium


cost of millions of dollars which is cheaper than having to not reverse merge. These shell


companies can be worth 40-80mil. But of course you deny these facts with one sided


arguments.
