GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On
AmTrust
Jan. 14, 2014 10:15 AM ET28 comments
by: The GeoTeam


In this report we will present new evidence to support our belief that Amtrust's
(NASDAQ:AFSI) reported financial statements are unreliable. AFSI appears to have
understated gross adverse development by over $100 million, and therefore gross
adverse development appears to be 300% larger than reported in the company's 10-K.
We believe that this is yet another telltale sign that the losses ceded to the company's
Luxembourg captives are not reflected in the 10-K, as covered exhaustively in our first
report. Additionally, the 10-K appears to be missing $276.9 million of gross loss reserves
confirming our initial report.


Often times, when a company has reported incorrect financial statements, multiple
accounts are misstated. For example, in many China fraud cases that we have covered,
overstated revenues resulted in false cash balances and uncollectible receivables. In the
case of AFSI, we believe that the underreported losses have resulted in understated gross
loss reserves in financials reported to the SEC.


Additionally, AFSI conducted a conference call to address some of the issues we raised,
and our conviction has not wavered. In this report, we present additional analysis using
the information provided in the conference call which we believe bolsters our claim. A full
transcript of the call is available here.


We are still short shares of AFSI, and based on the additional evidence and information
provided by the company in their conference call, we have revised our fair value estimate
to $2.17 - $6.51 per share. Investors who view our target as extreme and rely on
continued support by sell side analysts should keep in mind that just prior to Tower
Group's (NASDAQ:TWGP) 87% collapse, many of the analysts urging investors to buy
AFSI today were recommending TWGP then. In our view, that supports our view that
many sector analysts are simply unaware of these issues or are willing to accept simple
anecdotal answers from AFSI management as they did with TWGP. Remember, analysts
get paid for helping the AFSIs and TWGPs of the world, not investors.


A prime example is Guggenheim, who deemed our report "not worthy of comment" without
actually providing an argument to support its view. Just three weeks after issuing this
dismissive commentary, AFSI disclosed that Guggenheim advised the company on the

acquisition of TWGP.


In this report, we will discuss:


1. How AFSI's 2012 Gross Adverse Development in US statutory filings is over $100
million more than the amount reported in its 2012 10-K. We believe that this is further
evidence of the company underreporting losses and violating US GAAP. We note that
PricewaterhouseCoopers ("PwC") cited Maiden Holdings (NASDAQ:MHLD) for
deficiencies that included the "failure to give appropriate consideration to US
GAAP" while Ron Pipoly (current CFO of AFSI) was the acting CFO of MHLD.


2. AFSI's "response" regarding Luxembourg's contribution to profits and why it appears to
support our thesis and contradict company disclosures.


3. The company's latest disclosures regarding Phoenix policies now gives investors the
ability to separate Phoenix contracts from the rest and facilitates further analysis,
which we believe further supports our conclusion that the values are overstated. AFSI
appears to value non-Phoenix policies at double the value used by competitors.


Section 1: New Evidence Shows Severe Discrepancies and Supports our Original
Thesis


In the section below, we compare gross adverse development and gross loss reserves
from AFSI's statutory filings to the same information in its 10-K and explain why the data
further increases our suspicion that AFSI is not properly accounting for the losses
ceded to their wholly-owned Luxembourg captives.


A) Gross Adverse Development Discrepancies Between 10-K & Statutory Filings


In the insurance industry, "development" refers to the change in the estimate of claim
payments that will ultimately be paid on policies for which the premiums were earned in
prior years. Positive development results in reserve releases and adverse development
results in reserve charges. Reserve releases (charges) go through the income statement
as an offset to (increase in) loss and loss adjustment expenses.


As discussed in our initial report, AFSI's reported results appeared "too good to be true"
as the company grew rapidly without a misstep along the way. We found this hard to
believe in the context of a long soft market and noticed other fast-growing peers were
struggling with severe adverse development. For example, TWGP announced they would
take an additional $75-105 million charge to increase reserves for workers' compensation
and other lines of business in which AFSI is active -- just two months after announcing it
would take a $365 million charge!

AFSI's statutory filings make it clear that AFSI is not immune to adverse development. In
fact, AFSI's statutory filings show the company is experiencing substantial gross
adverse loss development. This is hardly surprising given the regulated, price-taking
nature of commercial insurance. However, the resulting liability present in the statutory
filings does not appear to show up in the financials filed with the SEC. We would
expect such an anomaly to be very concerning for investors and regulators.


In the next subsection of this report, we show how gross loss and loss adjustment
reserves or "loss reserves" (balance sheet liability) in statutory filings exceed those of the
10-K by the amount of cumulative losses ceded to Luxembourg captives. As such, we
suspect inter-company reinsurance agreements with Luxembourg captives and the failure
to eliminate all inter-company transactions and "give appropriate consideration to US
GAAP" (as Pipoly did at MHLD, see Section 1).


The table below summarizes AFSI's gross adverse development for 2012 by underwriting
group:


Ultimate Claim Payment Estimates by Accident Year as of December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2012, respectively.


The tables below are from Technology Insurance Company & Affiliates' (AFSI's
consolidated US statutory subsidiaries) 2011 and 2012 Schedule P, Part 1. The first
column shows the estimated "ultimate loss pick" by "accident year". The "ultimate loss
pick" is the company's estimate of cumulative payments they will make over time for
claims on policies that it covered in a given "accident year". The "accident year" can be
thought of as a vintage. It refers to the year in which the premium was earned and an
event that resulted in a claim occurred, regardless of when the claim was filed:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 4/24


Below we compare the change in ultimate loss picks for the two years which shows
AFSI's US subsidiaries had gross adverse development of $129.8 million in 2012.


In addition to the total gross adverse development being substantial, it pervaded almost all
accident years (with 2011 still being relatively unseasoned) which indicates systemic
under-reserving. This degree of gross adverse development is consistent with the results
of other aggressive peers like QBE and MIG, but the uniformly negative development
indicates AFSI could have TWGP-like reserve deficiencies.

AFSI's 10-K Shows Meaningfully Less Gross Adverse Development


Despite the $129.8 million of gross adverse development disclosed in statutory filings,
AFSI's 10-K shows only $26.645 million of gross adverse development:


We would have expected to see approximately $130 million of gross adverse
development in the 10-K, subject to the development reported by AFSI's other
underwriting subsidiaries because there are only very minor differences between GAAP
and SAP when it comes to accounting for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.


To demonstrate, we also checked Meadowbrook's (NYSE:MIG) statutory filings, which
showed gross adverse development of $97.5 million - only $1.4 million larger than
disclosed in its 10-K ($96.1 million).


B) Comparison of 10-K & Statutory Filing Gross Loss & LAE Reserves Corroborates
Our View


Our original report identified what we believe to be the under-recognition of $276.9 million
in net loss & loss adjustment expenses. Now we turn our attention to gross loss and loss
adjustment expense ("LAE") reserves (balance sheet items).



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MIG

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 6/24


If AFSI is correctly accounting for its Luxembourg captives by applying US GAAP, then
one would expect the gross loss & LAE reserves of AFSI's direct underwriting subsidiaries
(US Subs, AEL, and AIUL) to very closely approximate the gross loss & LAE reserves
shown in the 10-K. This is not the case. Instead, we see a discrepancy of $276.7
million - which was our estimated ceded losses to Luxembourg captives.


*AII assumes losses from the US Subs, AEL, and AIUL, so including these reserves would
be double-counting.


**ACHL assumes losses from AII, so including its gross reserves would be double-
counting. If AII and/or ACHL assumed losses from any third parties, the difference would
only make the problem worse.


For readers who may not have read our original report, we have reproduced the table
where we summed the net losses ceded to Luxembourg seemingly not reflected in the 10-
K:


The discrepancy between statutory and GAAP loss reserves strongly suggests
AFSI is not appropriately recognizing the gross loss expense incurred (the
provision which goes to build the reserve) by Luxembourg captives under US
GAAP. We suspect that AFSI is offsetting this expense in Luxembourg by reversing
equalization reserve liabilities to smooth losses in Luxembourg captives which, while
acceptable under Luxembourg GAAP, is not compliant with US GAAP.


Interestingly, this appears to be how AFSI presented the "gross" loss expense and "gross"
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses (aka: loss reserves) when preparing its AII-
Bermuda financial statements in 2010, as we explain below.


First, note that unpaid losses ceded (a balance sheet liability) to ACHL-Lux are netted out
BEFORE arriving at the $568.091 million gross loss & loss adjustment reserve number:



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/1/13/360252-1389656495738545-The-GeoTeam_origin.png

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 7/24


Gross Losses and LAE are comprised of direct (issued to ultimate policyholder) and
assumed (acting as a reinsurer) losses and LAE. Net Losses and LAE subtract out the
ceded (reinsured) portion. Notice that the sum of assumed (before netting for any ceded)
unpaid losses and LAE (the second column above) is $662.067 million, not $568.091
million. We believe $662.067 million is the true gross unpaid losses and LAE. However,
AII-Bermuda incorporates the benefit of $93.975 million of reinsurance from ACHL
(Luxembourg) before presenting the "gross" reserve. Below we reconfigure the table
above to show the true gross loss reserves:


However, we note that $568.1 million (instead of $662.067 million) is presented on the
balance sheet as the gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserve:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 8/24


As discussed in our original report, only after excluding the losses ceded to Luxembourg
can we tie out the net loss and loss adjustment expense (income statement expense)
between AFSI's subsidiaries' AM Best reports and 10-K.


The analysis presented above demonstrates two critical points. First, just like other
insurance companies that grew rapidly in the soft market and reported hard-to-believe loss
ratios, statutory filings show AFSI is experiencing severe gross adverse development
meaning the business is less profitable than the company originally projected. Second,
the full extent of AFSI's gross adverse development does not appear to be reported
in AFSI's SEC filings.


Unfortunately, AFSI's other entities do not provide the same level of detail as US statutory
filings. However, we believe there is sufficient data to rule out the possibility of offsetting
positive development. For Amtrust Europe Limited ("AEL"), AFSI's UK insurance
subsidiary, we know net development was negative based on the AEL annual report filed
with the registrar Companies House.


Insurance companies that experience negative net development almost always have
negative gross development as well. Under proportionate reinsurance, net and gross
development is inextricably linked. Under excess of loss reinsurance, the reinsurer does

not step in unless losses exceed a certain level. Negative net development indicates that
more claims are approaching and/or breaching the level where reinsurers start bearing the
risk.


For Amtrust International Underwriters Limited ("AIUL") we can also rule out the possibility
of sufficient positive development to offset the US statutory subsidiaries because AIUL
only had $97.4 million of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of the end
of 2011. In other words, the maximum positive gross development AIUL could have
had was $97.4 million which still would not be enough to offset the discrepancies. It
would require all previously estimated claims to have been zero (and that still wouldn't be
enough!) Further, AIUL's net loss ratio is 90.4% after benefiting from inter-company
reinsurance agreements. Therefore, it's unlikely that AIUL had anything but meaningfully
adverse gross development.

We continue to suspect the difference between loss and loss adjustment expenses and
reserves is the result of AFSI's Luxembourg captives "utilizing" equalization reserves to
the tune of $276.9 million. The additional data from primary sources presented above
serves to further increase our confidence that the company is sending losses to
Luxembourg captives and failing to correctly consolidate the losses when reporting results
to investors.


Section 2: Why AFSI's Conference Call Enhances Our Confidence Regarding
Luxembourg


In our view, the press release announcing the call and the call itself were completely
devoid of facts to support the "positive outlook" headline of the company-issued press
release. In addition, management failed to provide any details to answer the questions we
raised about Luxembourg captives, equalization reserves, and AFSI's apparent failure to
consolidate losses ceded to Luxembourg captives. This is in stark contrast to our report
which relied on public documents, showed specific data from primary sources, and
detailed the methodology so others could verify the approach.


We believe we presented compelling evidence using reports and filings prepared by the
company to raise serious questions about AFSI's accounting for intra-company
reinsurance transactions. In our opinion, AFSI is not offering serious answers. We also
find it notable that management did not take questions on the call. Further, despite
arranging the call specifically to respond, management did not criticize our approach other
than by making general statements about unspecified "inaccuracies".


If our analysis was flawed, why didn't management take that opportunity to correct
the record with specifics? Perhaps it was not as easy to do as they would like to
suggest...


We believe AFSI should present actual data from public sources to explain how it
accounts for these entities, as we did. The fact that we arrive at such alarming conclusions
without having heard a plausible explanation from management is highly disconcerting.
After all, the purpose of the company's financial statements is to present a fair picture of
the operations.


AFSI's disclosure that Luxembourg generated "less than $25 million" of profits
actually supports our view
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 11/24


Turning to the conference call, management was adamant that there were no accounting
problems related to their Luxembourg reinsurance captives, but chose not to provide any
specific details other than saying (emphasis added):


"From January 1, 2009 through the first nine months of 2013, the Company has
earned pre-tax profits of approximately $1.1 billion. Less than $25 million of that pre-
tax profit, or just under 2.5%, resulted from the Company's direct operations in
Luxembourg."


Despite AFSI disclosing very little, this meager data point supports our view in light of
other AFSI disclosures and management comments.


Consider the only reference we could find in AFSI's SEC filings regarding the Luxembourg
reinsurance captives' impact on operations, which was in its 2011 10-K (page F-27):


"As a result of these acquisitions (ACHL purchase of reinsurance captives in
Luxembourg) in 2011 and 2010, the Company reduced its acquisition costs and
other underwriting expenses by approximately $23 million in 2011."


AFSI's 2012 10-K (page 68) provides us with an answer which relates to how the
company accounts for deferred tax liabilities. AFSI appears to treat the reversal of
accrued deferred tax liabilities associated with equalization reserves as a negative
operating expense even though it relates to a tax liability!


"Additionally, the use of deferred tax liabilities related to equalization reserves are
netted against related amortization expense and recorded as a decrease to other
underwriting expense. Otherwise, we include changes in deferred income tax
assets and liabilities as a component of income tax expense."


We were told by readers that SunTrust made comments in a December 18 note defending
the company ("Reiterate Buy Rating Following Travel with Management") that confirm (1)
AFSI is ceding more losses (expenses) than premiums to Luxembourg captives "by
design" and (2) AFSI records a decline in the DTL as a reduction in operating expenses:
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 12/24


"It is important to know that, by design, the Luxembourg captives should be ceded
more losses than premiums in any given period…


AmTrust does benefit from the drop in its deferred tax liability - established as
part of the original Luxembourg captive acquisition - that flows through the
company's P&L in the form of an offset to operating expenses (emphasis
added)..."


In order for a company's deferred tax liability to "drop" (ie: reverse the accrued liability),
the company has to incur a net loss (incur expenses in excess of revenues). Consider the
owner of a stock with unrealized gains. He has a DTL because if he sells the stock, he will
have to pay taxes. If he continues to hold it, he is deferring the tax liability. However, if the
stock declines, his DTL declines (or goes away) because the taxes he would owe upon
selling the stock declined. In other words, for his accrued DTL to reverse without paying
taxes, he had to incur a loss.


As noted in prior reports, AFSI subsidiaries' Schedule Y indicated AFSI's Luxembourg
operations were incurring net losses as a result of inter-company transactions, which is
corroborated by AFSI's disclosed DTL reversals. However, basic accounting tells us
that DTL reversals are the result of pre-tax losses, so how does management
reconcile DTL reversals and profitable Luxembourg operations?


The combination of disclosures above is, in our view, damning evidence of improper
accounting at AFSI.


In summary, management claimed to have reported profits of "less than $25 million" in
Luxembourg. Then management seems to have told SunTrust analysts that they
intentionally lose money in its wholly-owned Luxembourg captives. So which is it AFSI?


Given the problems AFSI appears to have applying US GAAP, perhaps it shouldn't be
surprising that PricewaterhouseCoopers (subsequently replaced by BDO) noted
deficiencies in MHLD's internal controls for the period that Ron Pipoly (AFSI's CFO)
acted as CFO (MHLD 424B3 filed May 2008, page 10, emphasis added):

"…


In particular, these deficiencies include:


failure to give appropriate consideration to U.S. GAAP accounting rules or
to have documentation of the basis for our opinion and conclusion
regarding the application of U.S. GAAP;
lack of an independent preparer and reviewer for various accounting tasks,
including the preparation of the financial statements and disclosures; and
lack of formality regarding certain controls surrounding the control environment.


…"


Section 3: New Disclosure Supports our View that LSCs are mis-marked


We believe the information management provided on the conference call confirms our
view that life settlement contracts ("LSCs") are mismarked. In an apparent attempt to
discredit our analysis and allay concerns over exposure to Phoenix, management
disclosed a new data point on LSCs on the conference call. However, the data actually
strengthens our conviction regarding the mismarking of LSCs.


In our first report, we discussed how we believed AFSI was using "egregiously aggressive
assumptions relative to peers" despite significant exposure to Phoenix, an issuer shunned
by most LSC investors. In other words, we believed AFSI was either A) not reflecting the
severe discount that Phoenix policies receive in the LSC market and/or B) carrying the
non-Phoenix policies at unjustifiable premiums relative to publicly-listed IFT, whose LSCs
have similar LEs to AFSI.


During the call, CFO Ron Pipoly said:


"Additionally, there have been comments made regarding the portion of our policies
in our life settlement portfolio where Phoenix is the carrier. To be clear, Phoenix
policies represent only 15% of the fair value of our portfolio at September 30, 2013.
Therefore, our net carrying value exposure to Phoenix policy is approximately $20
million. Thank you."


The table below shows that AFSI carries the non-Phoenix policies at approximately 2x the
carrying value IFT applies which has similar LEs and does not own any Phoenix policies.
Until now, it was not possible to provide a true apples-to-apples comparison with other
5/23/2018 GeoInvesting Presents Additional Evidence To Support Assertions On AmTrust - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | See…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944341-geoinvesting-presents-additional-evidence-to-support-assertions-on-amtrust 14/24


companies because it was unclear how much value AFSI attributed to the Phoenix
policies. Let's take a look at the implications of this comment:


*Fair Value of $34.1m for Phoenix policies derived from AFSI CFO's comments (15% of
fair value); Net of NCI, AFSI's Phoenix exposure is approximately $19.7 million


**Face Value of $828.5m for Phoenix policies derived from court documents (see next
table)


AFSI LE, Discount rate, Face Value of consolidated LSCs figures from September 30,
2013 10Q


IFT LE, Discount Rate, Fair value, Face value from September 30, 2013 10Q


For the table above, we use the complaint filed by AFSI's subsidiary in the PHL case, its
recent memorandum of law in support of motion for summary judgment (See footnote 1)
and assume the face value per Phoenix policy is the same to estimate that the current
face value of AFSI's Phoenix-issued policies is $828.5 million:


Since ALL companies that invest in LSCs make various adjustments (which are
essentially in-house estimates) prior to discounting, the simplest way to compare them to
each other is by looking at the carrying value versus face value of contracts with similar
life expectancy.


As you can see from the table above, AFSI has a carrying value of 20.4% of face value. In
comparison, Imperial Holdings (IFT) has a carrying value of 9.7% of face value despite the
two companies having similar life expectancies ("LEs"). In our view, this makes it
abundantly clear to us that AFSI uses an inappropriate methodology.


We also question the 4.1% fair value / face value estimate for Phoenix-issued policies.
Based on conversations with market participants, long-duration Phoenix policies like the
ones AFSI owns are likely worthless. The quote below, from the March 5, 2013 issue of
"The Life Settlements Report" demonstrates this well:

"Scott Rose, principal of Tarrytown, N.Y.-based advisory firm Barrett Advisors,
urged legislators to expand the bill to include the disclosures required in last year's
bill. The proposal then would have forced carriers to explain why they planned to
make the increase, but it was watered down and then died on the Senate floor.


He testified that there is no meaningful market for Phoenix policies currently."


Debunking the LSC "Reserve" Myth:


AFSI has put forward an explanation (excerpt below) which we would paraphrase as
adding "reserves" to the company's expected cash flows to adjust for various risks and
then using a lower discount rate than others because the riskiness of the investment is
already reflected in AFSI's "reserves".


Separating the "reserves" from the time value of money would be a reasonable approach,
but that does not appear to be what AFSI is doing. Instead, AFSI appears to be calling
industry-standard adjustments "reserves". Below is CFO Ron Pipoly's comment on the
December 16, 2013 conference call:


"Now turning to life settlements. Our effective discount rate of our life settlement
portfolio for the third quarter 2013 was 14.2%. The future positive cash flows of our
life settlement portfolio are expected to be $779 million. Those cash flows are
reduced by additional reserves that we apply.


Among those reserves is the reserve for life expectancy blending. Life expectancies
are updated every year by two of the most widely recognized life expectancy
providers and are weighted to the more conservative of the two expectancies.


Additionally, we provide a mortality adjustment reserve by reducing the standard
mortality tables based on the assumption that higher net worth individuals will live
longer based on access to better healthcare. We also provide additional reserves for
future expenses, operational risk in reserve for highly impaired lives. We believe that
establishing specific reserves and then applying an overall discount rate provides
the most accurate valuation for our portfolio."


The factors for which AFSI creates so-called "reserves" appear to be adjustments that IFT
merely deems prudent and reflect industry standards. Only AFTER these adjustments
does IFT apply a 19.63% discount rate.

*AFSI's reserve for highly impaired lives would seem to be immaterial since only 15 / 272
policies are expected to mature within five years.


**AFSI's reserve for future expenses is likely quite small because their primary
administrator has a profit share tied to the performance of the investments.


Another qualitative hint that AFSI's explanation is implausible is the lack of detail related to
these "reserves". One would expect a footnote or comment on this $281 million item in
AFSI's SEC filings if it truly was a reserve.


Fair value estimate revised lower: $2.17 - $6.51 per share


Our initial report valued AFSI at $3.87 to $13.00 per share. Given further evidence of
over-marked LSC and hidden losses that do not appear to be reflected in SEC filings, we
have revised our estimate of fair value to $2.17 - $6.51 per share.

HA, keep trying geo"investing" - please take note of the quotation marks around the word 'investing'. They are there
for a reason!


Every time you come out with these convoluted reports that send the retail investor running scared, I'll continue to
back the truck up to the puts depot. I have made so much extra money from your distort and short schemes - lowered
my cost basis in AFSI 12% in December. I should be able to use this "report" to grab another couple of thousand
dollars!


Thank you geo"investing" for the fear you create in the mass of "investors" here that allow me to continually grow my
wealth.

wwt17,


retail investors cannot force AFSI to sell off 30+% in a week...obviously big money was involved here
(including hedge funds). But yes I agree that the drop was a compelling opportunity to open a position, which
I did.

Yes, I should have been less focused on retail investors. There is definitely big money short and distort action
going on here.

Interesting trading around the timing of this article. Yesterday, AFSI was way down, over 7% (+4% more after hours),
on no news. Then today, after this article was published, it is up substantially. 
The issue here is that the author started with a view, "AFSI's reported results appeared "too good to be true" as the
company grew rapidly without a misstep along the way" and then sought to find facts to support that view, rather than
gathering the facts and basing the view on the facts. 
AFSI results aren't "too good to be true" anymore than Warren Buffett's are. Like Buffett, AFSI has done very well by
purchasing companies and assets at very steep discounts (in AFSI's case usually distressed situations). 
The author admittedly is just speculation, as the author continues to use words like "believe", "suspect", and other
similar terms. See the difference when the author affirmatively states as fact problems with Chinese companies,
without any such qualifying language. 
The author does not have a basis to challenge the reserving, and even the author admits they don't have enough
information to reach a definitive conclusion, they just have suspicions or beliefs about it. 
My review indicates that AFSI is not underreserved and that the life settlements are not overstated, particularly
because they were purchased at such dirt cheap prices. Having read through the article, I don't see any basis for the
conclusions reached in it, the logic and reasoning are convoluted, hard to follow, and don't make sense. The author
appears to not understand how the accounting is done, comparing apples to oranges and mixing and matching
figures from different accounts and entities that don't necessarily relate to each other.

The Geo Team has shown that they lack fundamental understanding of several industries.


I guess as long as you create enough fear in your reports, it doesn't matter if you know what you're talking
about


15 Jan 2014, 11:00 AM


ValueinvestorEU
That is exactly my take as well.


Its alot of belief and fussy comparing and then concluding they cant tell if they are underreserved or not.

Very strange. 
Is it so difficult to determine if this is true or just another manipulation exercise to get some easy money? 
The easiest way to make money nowadays is indeed to spread out bad news to frighten small investors. 
However we should keep in mind that the management team answered back buying a huge amount of securities
(taking advantage of the bargain prices).  
What do you think about this move, Geo Team?

I don't think geoinvesting with it's subscribers, markets edge ltd, markets edge frf llc have enough combined assets to
make this short play stick. Everyone who was scared out when the first article came out has realized just what had
happened. Geoinvesting was fortunate that some of the less seasoned media parroted their line as news the first
time. Seems very unlikely that something like that will happen again. Especially since AFSI's ratings were just
reaffirmed by A.M. Best and every analyst representing a legitimate investment organization regarded the drop in
price as a buying opportunity.

In defense of GeoInvesting, it is extremely difficult to understand the risk strategies used by multi-line insurers like
AmTrust, AIG, Zurich, etc. One has to be a expert in international law, accounting, risk management and finance. To
cease further embarrassment GeoInvesting should just admit that they are outside their area of expertise and stop
publishing these rambling analyses. I'm impressed at the effort they've shown, but having spent my entire career in
insurance they're assertions strike me as ridiculous and are starting to borderline on childish.

The life settlements were bought dirt cheap and were well vetted. I don't agree with their whole approach in
analyzing them. First of all, each policy should really be evaluated on its own, rather than the same method to
the whole group. AFSI has used very conservative measures for the whole group in an abundance of caution
in my opinion.

LOL, Looks like Geo is way out of their league on this one. AFSI was up pretty strong today so looks like they are
losing their touch. The above article makes lots of assertions but many are very slim on facts if they provide any facts
at all. The lack of logic and common sense in their guilt by association tactics are also getting pretty weak. With the
insiders having made large purchases as well as the company having instituted a buyback I think they'll move on
sooner rather than later. Till then, I'll be waiting and watching to see if they can drive the price back down below $30.

"Remember, analysts get paid to help the AFSI's..." So who gets paid if their shorts cover?? This is getting boorish
GEO. Stick to what you know, it certainly isn't anything to do with this sector. Cutting losses happens to us all. It may
well be your turn.

ValueinvestorEU
its like GEO investing have understood the nature of the business.


That they got a long term risk on the contracts, that they make loss reserves each year to reflect the expected losses
and record real losses as they incur.


Besides this I dont at all understand what they are trying to say.


First they talked about the contracts from phoenix being discounted with a too low rate. even though they didnt
understand that the average life of the insured was almost 80 years. so of course you cant meassure those
200something insurance policies with the average for the industry.


Geo have stopped talking about this. instead of admitting they were wrong.


Their first comment also clearly showed lack of understanding of accounting between an insurance company and a
reinsurer.


And now I simply get dissy trying to understand what they are saying..


Is it possible that amtrust and other companies in their instry have been making too small reserves based on future
claims from workers compensation?


Very likely. Do we know from any of these numbers that it should be the case? I dont understand it and I usually
understand insurance pretty well.


To me this looks like alot of fussy thinking, but I am not gonna take the time to go over all their numbers and trying to
link it to the 10K.

Hello ValueinvestorEU,


So, with your knowledge about the insurance business you are saying you don't feel comfortable investing in
AFSI, comparing to its peers?

I had a small position in AFSI and considered maiden holdings.


To me the management of AFSI have been great investors using the misfortune of other companies to make
great distressed investments.


(like the 200 high value policies on 80year olds they bought from Phoenix). The Karfunkel family owns a large
portion of AFSI and have been buying more, they have a great trackrecord going back decades.


They have invested well in property which has been the foundation of their wealth.


Furthermore even though some things are more disclosed than others, I find that mostly when I do analysis of
assumptions used for reserves, they have been conservative as opposed to lavish.


I dont like the industry they are in, because its very hard to long term predict reserves, but the low price as
well as the track record of management convinced me to buy up a smaller stake.


But this isnt a stock you can let become your biggest position. its much like a bank, yes you can judge what
they say about their credit policies, but you wouldnt want to fill your portfolio with even just sound banks.


Hope it makes sense.


I wouldnt let AFSI represent more than 10% of my assets at purchase, and I have sold AFSI again personally
because I had other better opportunities.

Thanks a lot. 
I bought some AFSI shares looking for a rebound in their price but I see it as a "be caution" investment. 
Before this event unleashed by GEO Investing, I looked at AFSI as a steadily growing company where one
can look to make some money over time. 
When looking to the company future estimates of grwoth (http://bit.ly/1cACyfs) it actually looks very
promising.


Thanks for your comments.


17 Jan 2014, 10:50 AM


ValueinvestorEU
I believe the reason the company cant be specifically adress the points that GEO investing is making is because the
whole fundamental understanding of the accounting is flawed.


So where do you start? It would take a seminar on the insurance industry and accounting to get them to understand
what is going on.


I like the insurance industry for just this reason.

UVE (universal insurance holdings) is just a good example of the complexity of accounting clouding the real income of
the company.


Insurance companies get tax deduction for reserves unlike alot of other industries, so you might be able to find hidden
gems where the insurance company have been piling up money for years to build a reserve by reserving most of the
profits for future lossess, then when the company decides that it is foolish to save up more for future lossess it will
start to adjust their yearly reserves. This gives a large on paper profit increase going forward!


the comment on UVE was just for the sake of the example, nothing else.


17 Jan 2014, 08:41 AM


recession graduate
I am still short this steaming pile and will be for as long as it takes. On this trajectory, this company will not be long for
this world.


Step back from all of the potential accounting issues and you still have a recklessly aggressive company growing by
expanding into longer-tailed lines, CA worker's comp., and running higher and higher volumes through MGAs. Their
underwriting is getting more aggressive, and their reserve assumptions appear to be less and less conservative. They
are doing more and more dubious acquisitions funded with higher and higher cost capital. They are highly leveraged.
Accounting growth is several multiples of tangible growth. Does this sounds like a business worth paying >4x TBV
for?


The stock price and analyst targets commit them to this growth at all costs strategy. This company will continue to
report spectacular results until it blows itself up, whether or not there is accounting fraud. There may not be
accounting fraud but the accounting is highly aggressive and at a minimum, heavily flatters the operating performance
of the business.


The smartest thing management could do would be do a massive stock issuance to shore up the balance sheet at his
ridiculous valuation. Instead they are buying back shares as a show of strength, levering their balance sheet even
further. Do you really think buying shares at 4x+ TBV is a good use of shareholder value? Only if you are dense
enough to trust these sleazebags. Maybe they should instead be doing more captive reinsurance $0.80 for $1.00
'riskless' deals instead (this is actually how they described the Lux deals on the last Q call - free, zero risk profits
which can be recognized opportunistically - sign me up). Again, step back from the nitty gritty forensic accounting
arguments and this is a fairly stunning disclosure from management, basically admitting they use these as an
earnings management tool.


Also, for those who weren't asleep during the last earnings presentation, the accounting was so aggressive that their
auditors required significant restatements in the last Q, even though they only corrected part of the most egregious
treatments and didn't address the more pressing 'negative opex' and inflated cost capitalization issues... On top of the
extreme policy leverage, balance sheet leverage, aggressive M&A, etc etc I don't know why anyone with half a brain
would want to own this company.


Aggressive growth + extreme financial & policy leverage + opaque accounting = an accident waiting to happen
