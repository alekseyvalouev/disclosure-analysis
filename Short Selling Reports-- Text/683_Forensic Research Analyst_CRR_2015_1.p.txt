Ceramic Proppant Is Going To Zero
Jul. 29, 2015 1:30 PM ET43 comments
by: Spotlight Research


Summary


An analysis of FracFocus indicates that there has been a secular, rather than
cyclical, shift away from ceramic proppant towards sand for oil well completions.


Only three material consumers of ceramic proppant remain in the industry today.
Industry overcapacity is thus overwhelming. Chinese and Brazilian proppant has
flooded the Bakken.


Given the secular shift, we believe that domestic ceramic proppant producers like
Carbo Ceramics no longer have sustainable business models under any oil price
environment.


An analysis of FracFocus, which is a publicly available database in which all E&Ps must
report the composition of each individual oil well completion, indicates that there has been
a secular shift away from ceramic proppant towards sand. Given that Carbo Ceramics's
(NYSE:CRR) business model relies on ceramic proppant for the vast majority of its gross
profit, we believe that CRR is at high risk of going extinct in the near term.


90%+ of ceramic proppant demand comes from the Bakken in North Dakota.


It is well known that Rosetta Resources (NASDAQ:ROSE) publicly stopped using
ceramics in the middle of 2014. Also, the market appreciates that upon acquiring Kodiak,
Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) largely stopped using ceramics on Kodiak's acreage.
ROSE and Kodiak were two of the largest consumers of ceramic proppant in 2014.


We have analyzed the well completions of the largest Bakken producers and arrived at
some shocking conclusions.


After being one of the largest consumers of ceramic proppant in the world in 2014,
Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) completely stopped using ceramic proppant in January
2015.
Statoil (NYSE:STO), another one of the largest producers in the Bakken, completely
stopped using ceramics in early February 2015.
QEP Resources (NYSE:QEP) stopped using ceramics in 2014 and has not drilled a
single ceramic well in 2015.

Newfield Exploration (NYSE:NFX) stopped using ceramics all together in January
2015.
WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) and Oasis Petroleum (NYSE:OAS) have not drilled a
ceramic well since the first quarter of 2015.


There are a handful of smaller producers still drilling the occasional well with ceramics in
the Bakken. These producers include:


Liberty Resources
Emerald Oil (NYSEMKT:EOX)
Zavanna
Triangle Petroleum (NYSEMKT:TPLM)


The only material consumers of ceramic proppant in the Bakken today are the following
three companies:


Whiting Petroleum - Ceramic proppant completions as a % of total completions are
declining significantly as WLL is completing wells with more sand
ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) - the only material producer in Bakken that is actually
increasing ceramic proppant usage as of the second quarter of 2015
Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) - ceramic proppant usage has declined ~50%
quarter over quarter in the second quarter of 2015.


On Carbo Ceramics's earnings call this Thursday, it would be very helpful if management
could explain for investors which companies aside from WLL, COP, and CLR consumed
more than 20 million pounds of ceramics in the second quarter of 2015, and which
companies' management expects to consume at least a similar amount of ceramics in the
third quarter of 2015?


The data is clear. Ceramic proppant demand is not cyclically depressed; rather it is
secularly challenged. Producer data indicates that ceramic well completions are
going extinct.


Including Chinese, Russian, and Brazilian ceramics proppant, which according to our
checks is currently being sourced FOB Bakken at $0.22-0.23 per pound, total industry
capacity is somewhere between 8-10 billion pounds. Our analysis suggests that total
industry nameplate capacity is only 10-20% utilized. The data indicates that the entire
domestic ceramic proppant market could be easily serviced by the Chinese and Brazilian
ceramic producers alone.

Same flawed argument as the earlier articles but to be fair - the article titles are getting more exciting!


Your conclusion on FracFocus data is either insincere or it shows a superficial understanding of the business.


When the automobile was invented, horse-drawn carriages “lost customers”. When the 2008 recession hit, Neiman
Marcus saw customers “trade down” to cheaper retailers. These customers came back to Neiman Marcus once the
economy improved.


This series of negative articles tries to paint the demand for CRR’s ceramic products as being a secular issue, in
reality it is a cyclical issue and this demand will return once the price of oil recovers.


29 Jul 2015, 01:47 PM 


Fracjob
Or, is it both secular and cyclical, Dr. Don't think that it makes much sense to think somebody "traded down"
to sand. Ceramic either improved production, or was necessary to production, or it didn't and wasn't. More
importantly, the shift away from ceramic began long before the recent oil price plunge.

Just a quick note, a lot of premium proppant in the Bakken isn't being correctly reported to Fracfocus. Ingredient
name and CAS number are generally better indicators than purpose or trade name.

You're missing  
Bauxite and associats 
You also don't include resin coated ceramics which are used in some Bakken wells, however there's not a lot.


You shouldn't be searching for ingrediantes only. You need to build a data miner to strip the system of the
operators in the Bakken and bin their proppant since some report brand names. If you get the pdf handle from
the HTML code you can batch download their entire server, convert pdf to excel and then extract the data.
You'd be surprised how many wells you're missing. Also keep in mind to match fluids with proppant, some
could be a result of a test rather than a full fledge switch. Our data shows that more ceramic is better, it
improves your decline and adds a volume to the EUR. Some may disagree that ceramic helps with sand
flowback but our personal experience is, we started pumping ceramic and we no longer had sand flowback
issues. Depends on the operator though.


29 Jul 2015, 04:04 PM 


Spotlight Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We don't need to build a "data miner" as you say. We've manually pulled the filing for each
well, summed up all ceramic proppant ingredients in each filing, and converted the results to pounds of
ceramic proppant per well.


Perhaps we've missed 1-2 ingredients, but that will not be material as we have incorporated the ingredients
that make up the vast majority of ceramic proppant completions.


It is nice that your data shows that more ceramics is better, but we would encourage you to look at what the
actual producers are saying about their Bakken completions. For instance, WLL reported the following today:


"Larger Volume Completions Deliver 40-50% Production Increases. We have been testing larger volume
completions across our acreage in the Williston Basin. These completions incorporated sand volumes of four
to six million pounds with well costs ranging from $6.5 million to $7.5 million. As detailed in our press release
dated July 17, 2015, enhanced completion wells have resulted in production increases relative to offset wells
of 40% at our Polar field, 50% at our Walleye field, and 50% at our Pronghorn field. Results from enhanced
completion wells in all three areas are outperforming our 700 MBOE type curve."

Thought that from Michael Filloon on a recent article on mega-fracs that as much as 20 million pounds of
sand was used recently on a single well. He would also have a very good idea on the subject, as he follows
this closely and was early in talking about EOG style completions, implications, and other companies
employing their techniiques.


29 Jul 2015, 05:28 PM 


HartStreet LLC, Contributor
"manually pulled the filing for each well" 
HOLY HELL lol! How long did that take you?


"It is nice that your data shows that more ceramics is better, but we would encourage you to look at what the
actual producers are saying about their Bakken completions." 
I am long time Completions Engineer for COP in the Bakken, we know what other operators are doing well
before it reaches investors. They also know what we are doing before it reaches investors.


""Larger Volume Completions Deliver 40-50% Production Increases. We have been testing larger volume
completions across our acreage in the Williston Basin."" 
There's a difference between large volumes and no ceramic. For example, our data shows that 4MMlb,
6MMlb, and 8MMlb 30% ceramic wells perform better than 4MMlb, 6MMlb, and 8MMlb 100% sand wells. Our
data also shows that a 8MMlb 100% sand outperforms a 4MMlb and 6MMlb 30% ceramic well. At our last
operator meeting, the general topic was cost cutting vs. well impact; i.e. should you cut ceramic or volume to
save cost? The answer is ALWAYS ceramic, but that doesn't mean your well will perform better, that just
means your economics will look better since you are forecasting a gain in production from the increase in
volume which outweighs the loss of EUR associated with cutting ceramic. So you twist the knobs to find the
optimum economic completions at today's oil prices. This optimum will change at $100/bbl oil price; we chose
to twist other "knobs". Another example, we cut a anti clay swell chemical 2 years ago because our model
said there is no impact to EUR whether you pump the chemical or not. Other operators disagreed with us but
fast forward 2 years and our EUR's remain unaffected by cutting clay web. Same goes for ceramic, our model
says to keep it and other operators disagree.

Author’s reply »  David, it sounds like you are agreeing with our analysis then?


Based on Fracfocus data, we calculated that COP drilled 24 wells in the first quarter of 2015 in the Bakken, of
which 21 had ceramics in them, and used ~40MM pounds of ceramics. In the second quarter, we calculated
that COP drilled 24 wells, of which 23 had ceramics in them, and used~65-70MM pounds of ceramics.


We also calculated that COP was the only large operator (defining "large operator" as an E&P that consumes
more than 20MM pounds of ceramic in any given quarter) that actually consumed more ceramic proppant in
the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter.

As you say, other operators seem to disagree with COP on this completion strategy. Instead of aiming for
higher EURs with ceramics, other operators appear to be interested in reducing cost and switching to sand
based completions.


29 Jul 2015, 07:59 PM 


HartStreet LLC, Contributor
Can't comment much on COP but all our wells have ceramic in them. There was not 1 well that did not have
ceramic. It's standard operating procedure, if fracfocus says otherwise then someone in the regulatory
department goofed.


"that actually consumed more ceramic proppant in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter." 
There's a reason for this but I can't say why lol until tomorrow and that's if they talk about it.


"David, it sounds like you are agreeing with our analysis then?" 
So I agree with the data but I don't agree with your conclusion; we got to a point in the road where I went right
and you went left lol. Ceramics are needed in the bakken, closure pressures are just to high for sand, nothing
is going to change that. Plus, we see it all the time over several years, operators cut ceramic, go back to
ceramic, and then cut it again. We did the same thing (pre-fracfocus) except now we are going to keep it.
What your article and several other articles by different authors seem to imply is that "white sand is better
than ceramic in high stress areas" that is not true. What you are actually seeing from operators is "3x white
sand is better than 1x ceramic" since volume is king. Now that the Bakken is moving to slickwater, you will
begin to see a lot of 50-100% ceramic slickwater wells that are just crushing 100% sand slickwater wells. I
don't think you need 100% ceramic with slickwater but since you have poor proppant transport through the
fractures with slickwater (low viscosity) you end up with a thin proppant pack and low PPA within the fractures
so you will need some ceramic. To think that a slickwater well with small sand proppant packs will resist
formation closure stresses of 8000-10000 psi as you drawdown the well makes zero sense, it literally defies
physics. Also, Chinese proppants suck lol, you can crush Terraprop with a hammer which is why it's selling for
8-14 cents/lb.  
Also, nobody is cutting well costs by getting rid of ceramic. They are cutting ceramic and using the savings to
increase sand volume. The only people who are cutting well costs by cutting ceramic are the ones who kept
the volumes the same after the cut or increased it by an amount less than the ceramic savings. Just look at
CLR they went to 2x-3x jobs but they also went from 30% to 20% then 15% ceramic for there jobs. They also
now direct source some of there ceramic from a different company rather than buy the ceramic through the
frac company.


29 Jul 2015, 08:56 PM 


Spotlight Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Got it. As our article discusses, CLR is the other big producer we still see using a lot of
ceramic proppant in the Bakken in the second quarter of 2015 per FracFocus. A good portion of their wells
are listed as "TerraProp Plus" in FracFocus for what it's worth. We did not realize pricing for Chinese proppant
was as low as $0.08-.14 FOB Bakken, which is pretty shockingly bad.

Out of the entire industry, it sounds like COP may be the only producer using more than 20MM pounds of
ceramics per quarter exclusively using domestic ceramic proppant. Maybe if WTI goes back to $75-80 a few
more E&P will bring back some more ceramic proppant into their well completions, but last time we checked
the forward curve for WTI was only at $60 looking out to the end of 2018.


29 Jul 2015, 09:28 PM 


Todd Bush, Contributor
I think you may be missing some of the ceramic products, but it looks like you captured the majority.


Operators are certainly moving to high-intensity slickwater fracs but many operators are evaluating
completion design & techniques.


Instead of pulling the files manually, we can help you reconcile the fracfocus information to what is reported to
ND O&G commission. You can find more about us here: 
http://tinyurl.com/o95...


We help people find out how much sand operators use, who's pumping, what they're pumping, and how the
information compares to other regulatory filings.


30 Jul 2015, 10:51 AM 


HartStreet LLC, Contributor
NDIC reporting is just as bad lol we verify our Form 6 data with FracFocus and Partner Reports. Oasis used
to be sleeves but they reported it as P&P on the Form 6 for the longest time. Now it doesn't matter because
they are doing P&P. I'd be careful with NDIC well files also, more so than FracFocus files.


I saw your link, you guys charge $650/MO for a data mining service!! I had no idea that they were that in
demand. PacWest was trying to charge us like hundreds of thousands a year and we said no lol but I didn't
know other people/investors were interested in data mining completion data.

The worst has yet to come for CRR. This is a SECULAR short. When a cheaper substitute can get the job done just
as well, what's CRR's value proposition when oil comes back? They'll still be using sand over premium proppant


29 Jul 2015, 01:55 PM 


Orffy
This article totally dismisses physics. Sand crushes and becomes less valuable at deep lateral levels. Ceramic can
withstand this pressure much more effectively. I'd like to see an operator pump a deepwater well with 100% sand...
good luck. Even the most brazen sand users admit it comes with drawbacks. And to totally dismiss CRR's other
products and services seems insincere.

Obviously there's a cost benefit to sand vs proppant. at these oil prices there's a skew towards sand. Difficult and
deep wells are not great either now. However let's not mistake correlation with causality. carbo can and has taken
some market share by surviving a little better in difficult times. I agree that saying there is a true competitive
advantage would be a stretch. It is not even that clear to me if drillers (can) know when proppants are justified.


30 Jul 2015, 04:32 AM 


HartStreet LLC, Contributor
About correlation and causation, we KNOW that ceramic improves well productivity over the life of the well in
the Bakken. It's more of cost v. Benefit analysis; if you have x amount of dollars for a well then what knobs do
you turn to give you the best well for the cheapest cost. Investors do this all the time, so think of a well
completion as your portfolio. With x amount of dollars to invest what stocks are you going to buy that yields
the greatest return? And just like investors, operators will come to different conclusions. Some will tweak fluid
design and use the savings to keep ceramic, others will tweak proppant design and use the savings to pump
larger volumes, and some may tweak operations and use the savings to keep their current design. Then it

Ceramic is stronger than silica. 
CRR ceramic is claimed to be better than ceramic from China, 
The round nature of ceramic makes fluid flow through it easier. 
Many folks are testing fracture filling theories in M$ wells to improve yields.


If the cost of $5 of ceramic yields an additional bbl of Oil as reported in the today's earnings report of CRR then many
shorts might burn.

CRR is better than China and so are other ceramics like Saint Gobain. Also, very few, VERY FEW, Chinese

This sector is in for a shake up, there is a couple of startup companies with patented technologies that are in the
midst of driving an industry wide disruption.


One that is in the process of retrofitting the Hallmark plant in India is LWP. The technology is sound, the company is
progressing quickly and on the cusp of further deals in Europe, China and the US. It is still a smallcap but by years
end, I think this company is in for a massive re-rate.


Using flyash to construct lightweight ceramic proppants is a genius idea and one which I am sure will change this

I think Ceramic will be around for a long time to come, the recoverability and crush resistance are unparalleled.


This said, I think there is a serious risk to traditional ceramic products with startups like LXP based on the ASX -

Watch this space, LWP has just signed a deal in India to convert a plant from full ceramic to the LWP product. There
are deals imminent in China, Europe and the US.

How does this data show the downtrend in Ceramic use to be secular instead of cyclical? Doesn't it show cyclical if all
the operators stopped using it in early 2015 to cut completions costs? It is not necessary to spend extra on proppants
that make wells produce for longer if the price isn't there to justify higher cost completions. Again, cyclical. What am I
missing that shows this is secular and that ceramic use wont return when companies wish to make better wells?

Revenues for CRR are down much more during this current market downtown compared to 2009. I am trying to figure
out if this current revenue drop will recover the way it did in late 2009 and 2010, or is it different this time? If revenues
recover significantly like they did in 2009 and 2010, CRR could be a great company to own. Please share your
thoughts.... From where I am sitting, it appears as though something is different during this downturn. The industry
downturn is similar, but the revenue drop for CRR is 2-5 times worse than 2009 2010, perhaps indicating that CRR's
revenue's may not recover the way they did last time.

and I don't see a reason how revenue will recover the way it did in 09-10. I was considering going long, but I can't
justify it...

Looking for some current pricing on ceramic proppants. If you're still tracking this article would appreciate it.

Gentlemen, today (Jan 2017), the only area for ceramic proppants is Russia. And one of the reasons (among others:
technology, formation structure, etc..) is the lack of developed frac sand deposits. Othertwise, Russia could simply
replace about 40% of its ceramic proppant market with frac sand and resin coated sand.
