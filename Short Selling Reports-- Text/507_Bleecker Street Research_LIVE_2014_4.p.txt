LiveDeal: 75% Downside This Time, The Thesis Is The Same
Feb. 26, 2014 8:24 AM ET41 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


LiveDeal (NASDAQ:LIVE) has continued to put out almost daily press releases, although
it appears that their effectiveness is diminishing. Three weeks ago, a bullish press release
could have sent the stock up 10% in a day, but now the stock might be flat or only up a
little bit. So what have all these press releases had in common? Well they all say nothing
and use big numbers regarding the general industry, yet rarely say anything specific to
LiveDeal. Additionally, the company reported earnings and announced a shelf offering in
mid-February, which I will cover below.


Press Releases


2/19: "Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) Follows LiveDeal's Lead but Without Key Benefits
to Users"


I'm not sure how this is supposed to be bullish. Groupon, which is better capitalized and
already has a national presence, could easily replicate LiveDeal's business model. Also
Groupon has a huge mailing list that it could use to promote its new service, something
LiveDeal doesn't have.


2/20: "LiveDeal Inc. Launches National Media Rollout on the Howard Stern Show"


Interesting, and that will probably get LiveDeal some visibility. Howard Stern does have a
target demographic that advertisers seek.


2/21: LiveDeal Platform to Reach 12 Million Listeners on Popular Howard Stern
Show


Same message as the press release the day before. Except for this quote.


If you're a LiveDeal investor, you should feel pretty good that you're investment is
getting the royal treatment with a media campaign that will begin with more than 12
million listeners from all over the country. There may not be a more powerful start to
a rollout than to reach more than 12 million potential business owners and potential
consumers.


2/24: LiveDeal Mobile Popularity Set to Explode with Addition of Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android Apps

This press release, using the big total industry numbers, said:


Gartner, Inc., the world's leading information technology research and advisory firm,
predicts mobile phone shipments will rise to 1.91 billion units in 2014 while
tablet shipments are expected to rise 42.7% to 263.2 million units this year. In a
recent report from eMarketer, the firm said mobile transactions are on pace to
drive 19% of all e-Commerce sales in 2014 which corresponds to $56.72 billion
in sales. Forecasts also show mobile transactions will represent 26% of digital retail
transactions in 2017, reaching an eye-popping $113.57 billion, an increase of
close to $90 billion in just 5 years.


2/24: LiveDeal Inc. to Unveil Plans for Significant Enhancements to livedeal.com on
March 12 in Light of Excess Demand and User Feedback


Due to excessive demand and enthusiastic feedback from consumers and
restaurants, the Company today announced that it will unveil plans for
enhancements in a forthcoming version of its successful mobile marketing deal
platform on March 12, 2014.


That enthusiastic response from the restaurants must be coming from those 15
restaurants I called where only two of them had heard of LiveDeal.


How Was The Last Quarter?


On Valentine's Day evening, LiveDeal filed its 10-Q and announced a $50 million shelf
registration. First the registration,


This registration statement includes $50,000,000 of securities which may be issued
by the registrant from time to time in indeterminate amounts and at indeterminate
times. Securities registered hereunder may be sold separately, together or as units
with other securities registered hereunder.


This is a pretty large filing for a company with a $113 million market cap, but that's what
happens when a stock goes up 900% and the value of it is much lower. The quarter itself
wasn't much better.Yes, revenues were up 4%, as they said in a press release, but if one
even bothered to look at the filing, then you saw a pretty bad quarter. Here are the
highlights.


Cash on hand declined 32% from $761k to $511k.

Comments (41)


Stockholders' equity decreased 10% to $2,849,470 from $3,169,733.
Revenues increased 4% from $572k to $593k.
Operating expenses were up 14% from $781k to $897k.
Operating loss was up 36% from a loss of $311k to $425k.


So What Is LiveDeal Worth?


I continue to think that LiveDeal is vastly overvalued. I decided to take an average of
scenarios.


For the public multiples, I used GRPN, which is what many bullish articles compare
LiveDeal to. For the stock sales, I used the prices that stock was sold at earlier this year.
And then I looked at the 52-week low. If you take the average of the downside in each
case, you get about 75% downside. I think this is fair, and would have the stock trading
basically where it was when it started the year.


Summary


When I wrote my previous articles (here, here and here), there were no shares of the
stock to short and a press release would drive it up 10%. Now there are shares available
to short (at least at Interactive Brokers) and the press releases are not driving the stock up
as much. In my last article, it was suggested that you should only short the stock when it
was going down, especially with momentum stocks. While I disagree with that sentiment, it
is now down 15% from its high, so this might be those traders' time to short.


Disclosure: I am short LIVE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Revenues increased 4% from $572k to $593k, but revenues per share decreased 23% YOY due to dilution. There
has been further dilution since the 10-Q was released. In order to sustain the same multiples LIVE must increase
revenues far more than 4% per year.

I wouldn't call paid pumps positive articles. There is little to no color or context about their business. It's all
about the stock and creating irrational exuberance about getting rich by owning the stock. For example, they
like to throw around a 60 Billion dollar number for restaurant revenue. That number is irrelevant to LIVE.
People pay for food, not for deals. An analogy is this, I'm going to create a service where movie goers can
login to my website and I will link them to fandango or another place to buy tickets, maybe at a discount. Well,
that business, of linking deals is a $0 business. Nobody is paying for it. It's irrelevant to make comparisons to
the multi-billion dollar movie industry. Until they can come out and say that they have 10,000,000 users and
500,000 merchants and based on their pilot program they can make $0.04 cents per user per month on
ads/premium/pay and $4 a month on merchants, then any other numbers are irrelevant. There's no way they
would ever release anything like that because they probably only have a few hundred merchants and barely
5,000 to 10,000 users consuming deals. This is so obviously a case of microcap stock fraud where the
insiders are looking to build a stock price and could care less about building a business.

I heard about the stock promotion on XM radio a few days before new years day when I was driving and started to
track the stock. Day traded it a few times but could not make it a long term commitment due to less visibility of the
company. Had I held on to it since then, I would have made a fortune, I wish I did though. They did a good job to
pump the price for sure though... I even renewed my XM subscription because of that, I am going to buy whatever
stock promotion it comes on... who knows, maybe I will catch the start of the next stock pump action and make 3 to
400 percent gain in a month...

I think you are being too generous with your target. 75% downside implies that the company still has a market cap of
over $25m. I don't believe that the market cap should be ANYWHERE near that much. They really have NOTHING,
and the company is virtually worthless and will eventually trade into the pennies just like similar pump and dump

Great work, Chris. Is there any evidence that the insiders are selling during their pumps? Going by the most recent
Yahoo! Finance info 72% of the shares are owned by insiders and 3.7% are short. Basically only 24% are long
"outsiders."

Leo - I am certain this is a scam company. Real companies wouldnt be caught dead being associated with the drivel
in the LIVE releases. I shorted and lost money. I wasnt willing to risk my portfolio on the exuberant whims of naive
investors. The fundamental value of the company is perhaps $5 Mil to $10 Mil, not $100 Mil. Eventually reality has to
set into the price. When people like you Leo, realize that the company has a web site no more likely to drive
restaurant dining than than the website of a neighborhood florist. Management sold 2.2 million shares during January
for $10 Mil. (Our author neglected perhaps the biggest news in the 10Q.) They were in danger of not paying the
electiric bill, as of their 12/31/13 statement, but now they sit on $9.7 Mil. These guys can create alot of mischief with
that kind of cash. They certainly wont invest in the business, cause they know its a loser. They will invest their cash in
continued efforts to mislead investors. I still have a small short position, but mostly covered at a loss. You dont know
when your shares are going to be needed, so fundamentals can become meaningless while shorting. The sure thing
is that longs will lose on this scam eventually.

Great work Chris. I have been following this pump for two months and companies that pay to promote fluff deserve to
have a spotlight on them. These guys add initial investors pretending to include big names in their release like
groupon because people know those companies. Well companies like groupon spend their time enhancing and
growing their business, this company is just focused on growing their stock. I shorted a lot at $9.59 and I'm ready to
watch this fall. I'll then focus on investing on companies actually building their business.


27 Feb 2014, 02:33 AM


ultraheady
There deals suck, this company is not even worth a dollar, half of there deals are promoting existing restaurant happy
hour promotions, or some nonimal token like free a game of darts if u spend $15, nothing even close to a Groupon. It
also appears 90% of the promotions they dont take credit cards for, so where's the revenue coming from? This isn't
even a small business just a pure scam.


27 Feb 2014, 08:59 AM


brentced
yah that's my question. Are they trying to be a facebook and advertise on the bottom of there coupons. If they
aren't charging the companies you'll get alot of them and users but at some point you'll need to monetize your
service. I got suckered and bought in at $8.90.

I think you are ok keeping your long position actually. They are going to release their app and probably have a
masterful pump planned around it and will fabricate downloads etc...

So here is one of the deals in Dan Diego:


"Get $10 Off on Purchases Over $20 at Saranya’s Thai Café"


Turns out, this place closed feb 3, as the facebook page confirms:


Saranya's Thai Cafe


February 3


We're sad to announce that this Friday will be the last day for us at this location (3695 University Ave). We tried but it
didn't work for us unfortunately although we're in the process of negotiate with the new location.

I'm ticked. I had short shares and my broker called them back, forcing me to take a loss. That really just gripes me to
no end they they have the legal right to do that. If they have shares to borrow and I agree to pay whatever interest or
fees are stated, then they shouldn't be able to just confiscate the shares from me with one day notice.


I know, I know, it's right there in the broker diclosure that they have that right, but that still doesn't make it right.


27 Feb 2014, 09:12 PM


Rappenco
What happened to you is probably the only thing keeping these shares up. there is a short squeeze occurring
so even if the shorts are right; the shares will climb until there are more shares available to short. 
Sounds like a bogus company to me, I certainly wouldn't short it though ; not until this squeeze is over.


28 Feb 2014, 05:55 AM


JRM Advice
You are not looking at the big picture here. In comparison with Groupon (G) and Living Social (LS), this is a great deal
to both the consumer (NO need to buy a coupon that potentially expires) and the Business Owners (Freedom to post
any deal realtime (VS. G and LS), and they are able to retain full payment instead of the 50% the G and LS take from
every deal purchased. The business owner usually gets the shaft. While this company is quite small at the moment, if
they can continue to meet with the targets they have set for the end of Q2, the potential for this company could be a
enormous and they could also be a great takeover target for Yelp. The revenues may not be quite there yet, but the
revenues will come in time with subscriber growth once the Google and Apple APPs are released in March. I would
be a buyer of this company prior to the release of these applications, as I think growth will start to significantly
accelerate with the release of these APPs. Just look at the 1 year chart on YELP and you can see what the potential
growth for this company could look like. Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin with questions

These guys are just angry shorts underwater and scared- pitching doom and gloom.Using words like scam
fraud blah blah blah.Well I will be Back in at today at the open hopefully on a dip thanks for the article we
should see a nice bounce soon .Website enhancements and app end of march these shorts will get fried
again.Buyins.net thinks so .But you know what maybe the business model fails I have no clue but right now
market believes it can work or has a chance to really succeed thats why Live split and basically doubled.And
as I warned shorts to cover before split I would cover before app realease but what do I know I'm a dumb
bagholder thats made 80% 1st time around on this stock let see how I do 2nd time around.Thanks Drose
..See you at 9.5 soon.GLTA

likely pop on that news but they've made so many announcements about it it could already be priced in.

Thanks again Drose -I sold today in the low 9's didn't want to be greedy.Hey when is your next short article
coming out would love to buy in the 7's again. As I told you before You should have covered before the split
but what do I know I'm a dumbagholder that just made another 1.70 in 2 days on a 7 dollar stock. It didn't
reach my 9.5 today but 9.27 was close enough and the day is still young.Now shorts have to deal with
website enhancements and LIVEDEAL app this month no thank you being short this thing you guys are
crazy.I have no clue what the value on LIVE should be but the street loves the potential .Not to mention the
shorts that will be forced to cover.Maybe I should have held some .GLTA

gut trade
I think the idea they have, allowing restaurants to offer limited time deals in a real time environment, is a good idea.
But they never address the real issue, how are they going to make money on the idea. Also, to me, the daily pumps
discredit any legitimacy they would hope to have. I bought some shares earlier as a momentum trade but dumped
them when it was pulling back a few days prior to the 3 for 1 to protect my profits. Wish I would have held until after
the 3 for 1, but at the time seemed to risky.


28 Feb 2014, 01:42 AM


777dsutter
Chris, its hard to argue with your analysis on this stock. Just a quick look at the financials shows that the company is
yet to really make any money! However I myself was drawn to the stock around $5 per share pre-split simply because
of the price action in the stock. A few years ago it broke a massive multi year downtrend and volume started to
skyrocket on big moves up in price! After a floor around $4/share(pre-split) was established and held, the stocked
started really cooking and hasnt looked back since. For whatever reason the stock is being accumulated and thats all
I care about. Im buying the stock, not the company, and the stock is in demand as of now. I personally would not short
this stock until the price action tells u to. You may end up being right about LIVE while it goes up another 500%. Dont
fight the trend. And ill be the first one trying to sell short the minute the stock tells me to. But that time doesnt appear
to be now. Just seems to be another example of why price action is all that matters! Perhaps that should be a larger
part of your analysis on this stock

Chris is more likely a fundamentalist. Which in general don't like growth stocks because they frequently defy
logic. This is all about liveDeal's future and can they become mainstream, atleast in the big cities. They
essentially take care of most of the marking needs of small start ups and medium size companies. I don't see
Mcdonalds stopping advertising and turning to liveDeal but I do see small companies like the CEO's own side

i was doing research on live today after they announced the app release. 3/4 restaurants i called knew about livedeal,
the one that didnt the guy barely spoke english lol. this company i feel is not being viewed the right way,on their
website they say its free for restaurants so you dont need to be worried about revenues with them. you need to worry
about how many people that use the app or website.


It is clear that the first step the company is taking is to build an audience. In technology, the name of the game is
potential. Instagram, for instance, had 30 million users when it was acquired, but to arrive at a fair value for
acquisition, the technology's future potential had to be included in the evaluation. Instagram has proven that potential
with close to 150 million users.


In technology, since most platforms are so scalable, those looking to acquire these technologies project 2, 3 and 5-
years out in time to see where the product could be, and usually pay a multiple based on future potential, not actual
results at the time. This bodes well for LiveDeal and its online and mobile deal engine, livedeal.com.


LiveDeal seems to understand that the name of the game is potential and that building a technology's popularity by
increasing its number of users could equate to more and more dollars in the company's future. With each major city
that the company has added to its platform, there is the market to add thousands of new restaurants to create
promotions and potentially millions of new consumers to view and use those real-time deals.


I was very skeptical before today but after doing my research and them releasing the app like they said they would i
will be buying shares with my speculation money.

5/18/2018 LiveDeal: 75% Downside This Time, The Thesis Is The Same - Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE) | Seeking Alpha

In technology, since most platforms are so scalable, those looking to acquire these technologies project 2, 3 and 5-
years out in time to see where the product could be, and usually pay a multiple based on future potential, not actual
results at the time. This bodes well for LiveDeal and its online and mobile deal engine, livedeal.com.


LiveDeal seems to understand that the name of the game is potential and that building a technology's popularity by
increasing its number of users could equate to more and more dollars in the company's future. With each major city
that the company has added to its platform, there is the market to add thousands of new restaurants to create
promotions and potentially millions of new consumers to view and use those real-time deals.


If you believe in the future of the company then buy the stock. I was very skeptical before today but with the app out
and 3/4 restaurants knowing who live is i will buy some shares with my speculation money.

I guess there's no more argument about whether or not this self promoting fraud was a good short. My compliments to
the shorts here! Looking at the charts you'd have to favor covering at about 1, no?

Author’s reply »  I would never buy LIVE, ever. Not even at $.1, just out of principle. I think it's worth about
$.50 though.

Oops, all this short talk seems to have gotten the PUMP going. http://bit.ly/1hRHeGb


Maybe I'm naive, but it's really shocking how this company manipulates the stock price through PR releases.

I don't have the info to confirm or refute a lot of the negative comments on LIVE, but I do know some of it is BS:


I collected a small amount of data this weekend from the NYC listings. I got some data on the first 9 listings: Buenos
Aires, Pinche Taqueria, The Ainesworth Park, Pioneers Bar, Dulce Vida, El Mio Cid, Margot Patisserie, Pasha
Restaurant, Taijiyama Sushi & Thai. First, all are legit restaurants. So how can LIVEDEAL be a complete scam if
people are walking into these restaurants and asking for "nonexistent" deals without having the restaurants in an
uproar? The answer to that question that I see posted on seeking alpha is that they are real deals, just not through
LIVEDEAL. In my research, of the 9, 4 did have active Groupon deals. The deals were slightly to moderately different

since, for one, you have to pay for the Groupon deals. Of the 9, 4 did NOT appear to ever have a Groupon deal, and
1 had an inactive deal. Also, I did not see any of the 9 deals listed on the restaurant websites (not all had a website).


One more bit of info, all 9 had a decent number of reviews on YELP (23 to 219 with median 75) with a very
respectable median rating of 4.0.


A lot of the negative comments may be true, but my small amount of research here makes me feel the negative
posters have gone too far with some of their claims.
