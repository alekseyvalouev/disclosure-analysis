China Integrated Energy: Investigators and KPMG Begin Sorting
Through Evidence
Apr. 5, 2011 4:16 AM ET199 comments
by: Alfred Little


Charles J. Landy, of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, contacted me to announce that
he has been engaged as counsel to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of
China Integrated Energy (NASDAQ: CBEH) to investigate my allegations. He stated the
he appreciates my offer to help find the truth and asked that I send him copies of all of the
evidence against CBEH. I referred him first and foremost to the key video evidence
(viewable here) proving CBEH has not produced any meaningful quantity of biodiesel in
the last four months, despite management’s repeated public claims that their plants are
running at 100% of capacity. I plan to spend the next several days walking Mr. Landy
through the documentary evidence, all of which is available by clicking the hyperlinks in
my updated report available (here).


Pillsbury’s investigation appears to be progressing very quickly. I believe Pillsbury can
conclude by next week that the videos and Chinese audit report together conclusively
show there has been no meaningful production and sales of biodiesel proving
management fabricated of $22 million of gross profit from biodiesel sales in 2010 as well
as grossly exaggerated wholesale and retail division profits. CBEH’s historical financials
clearly can no longer be relied upon.


The March 10  Investor Tour video also conclusively shows management staging phony
production at the Tongchuan plant to deceive investors (also viewable at the same link
above). Once Pillsbury confirms the truth of the videos the Independent Board Members
will have to take swift action to terminate Chairman Gao and his management team as the
first step toward preserving shareholder value. Then the Independent Board Members will
have to find new honest management to sort out what remains of CBEH and determine
whether or not there is any viable future for the company.


KPMG Audit and Q1 Preview


International Financial Research & Analysis Group ("IFRA") investigators handed over all
their documented evidence late last week to KPMG, CBEH’s independent auditor. I
encourage institutional investors and analysts to contact KPMG audit manager Ryan Guo

in the Beijing office (main line: +86 10 8508-5000) to share their concerns. Ryan’s
assistant is Pingping Cen (direct line: +86 10 8508-5517, email:
pingping.cen@kpmg.com).


Given the video evidence clearly shows no material production of biodiesel in the first
quarter of 2010, I expect CBEH will be forced to report a loss on it biodiesel operations for
the quarter just ended. The loss could be large if CBEH is forced by KPMG to write down
biodiesel asset values and goodwill attributable to its Chongqing Tianrun biodiesel
acquisition.


More importantly, since KPMG is now aware that CBEH’s historical biodiesel production
was likely all a hoax, it is only a matter of time before KPMG pulls its 2010 audit opinion
resulting in the delisting of CBEH. The former auditor, Sherb & Co., LLP, should likewise
pull its 2008 and 2009 audit opinions. I don’t expect CBEH to trade on NASDAQ much
longer.


More Videos Uploaded


I have now uploaded a total of 64 days of Tongchuan and Chongqing surveillance video to
Vimeo (viewable here). The videos span February 10  to March 24 . In addition to
proving CBEH has no meaningful biodiesel production activity, the highlights of the videos
include:


Tongchuan 3/10/11 – Management hosts a group of 20 Rodman & Renshaw investors
on a tour of the idle Tongchuan plant. During the tour management staged production
activity including the fake filling of five biodiesel tanker trucks from the factory’s storage
tanks. During four months prior to the tour, investigators saw only one other tanker
truck (see below). The Tongchuan plant requires at least 18 large tanker trucks per day
to enable it to run at 100% of capacity as management claims.
Tongchuan 3/24/11 - A sea container load of heavy equipment is delivered to the new
50,000 ton production line. Management previously announced in a January 31, 2011
press release (here) the completion of construction of the new production line stating
that “the facility is expected to be operating at 25% - 30% capacity in the first quarter of
2011”. This is impossible since equipment was still being delivered as recently as
March 24  and the surveillance videos show no meaningful production of biodiesel
throughout the first quarter.
Tongchuan 2/21/11 – CFO Albert Pu hosted a plant tour for Jason Xu of Quantum
Asset Partners. Jason contacted me explaining that he was very unhappy at the lack
of production activity he witnessed. After viewing the IFRA surveillance videos he told

me he is “certain now that CBEH has been faking biodiesel production for a long time”.
Other investors have come forward and shared similar stories. One investor who was
allowed to film a video inside the plant in November 2010 expressed to me his concern
that the operation was a hoax.
Tongchuan 3/2/11 – The first large biodiesel tanker truck the investigators witnessed in
four months entered the Tongchuan factory.
Tongchuan 3/7/11 – The lights are on at night for the first time in four months.
Tongchuan 3/12/11 – After five nights of lights (centered around the March 10
Investor Tour), the factory returns to darkness.
Chongqing 3/9/11 – A large truck containing what may be waste oil barrels entered the
factory. This was the first evidence of any possible production activity in two months of
surveillance.


2010 Surveillance Records


IFRA has agreed to let me release surveillance records (pictures and comments) from its
field agents stationed outside the Tongchuan plant in November and December 2010. I
am formatting the pictures for upload to Vimeo this week. Like the surveillance videos from
2011, these records show no production activity at the Tongchuan plant. The only activity
was the ongoing construction and equipment deliveries to the new 50,000-ton Tongchuan
production line.


Cash Per Share Confusion: $2.29, $1.47 or $0.28?


I noted many investors expressing assurance that CBEH is a “safe” investment at these
low levels due to Yahoo Finance and other sites reporting the company has $2.29 cash
per share. But free sites like Yahoo routinely miscalculate cash per share, ignoring
restricted cash, earmarks and dilution from new funds raised.


As I show in my updated report (here), according to CBEH’s own management
shareholder letter dated 3/23/11 (here or here) the unrestricted cash balance at 12/31/10
was $30.3 million after management deducted working capital and prepayments from
customers. I add to this the total net proceeds of $36.73 million CBEH received from
Rodman & Renshaw investors in January to get $67.03 million. Dividing $67.03 million by
45.65 million fully diluted shares outstanding (following the financing) results in $1.47 cash
per share as of the first week of January.


However, CBEH is aggressively spending its cash on highly questionable acquisitions,
including the previously announced $46 million Hainan Lin Gao biodiesel project as well
as the $8.2 million pending payment for the acquisition of the Chongqing FengDou

This is what I don't get about all of you Longs; you bash the messenger but not the message. If any of you
have ever taken a logic class, you'll know this is just poor argument form. It basically means you have no fact
to support your attacks so you resort to attacking the individual.


Now the point by point rebuttal by management was VERY WEAK, and then them threatening to sue Alfred
just smacked of desperation.


Finally the point of him being an “evil” short with a biased agenda, please go back to Financial Markets 101,
that’s the function of the free market to bring out a variety of views, and bring securities to their fair market
value. It’s not his fault that the fair market value of this security happens to be basically zero; most frauds are

Your level of delusion is quite amusing.  
Do you really think Muddy Waters has gone to any lengths to avoid detection? Almost anyone knowledgeable
who tracks stocks in this sector knows Carson Block is the person who runs Muddy Waters.


Again, like I challenged you to do before, have you actually visited the Muddy Waters Research website? Did
you see what was stated on the home page of the website under "RECENT NEWS"? 
- An article in Barron's; it doesn't seem like Carson Block is trying to avoid being detected. If he is, that is a
very strange way to go about it.


www.muddywatersresearc...//


So obviously you never bothered to go to their website and conduct even the most basic of rudimentary
research/due diligence. Or maybe you did, and found it does not fit your confirmation bias, and chose to
ignore it when making your very uniformed comment. I'm not sure which it is.


So do you actually have any semi-intelligent arguments in rebuttal of what this author has stated about
CBEH? Or are you only able to try and make personal attacks?

There are not any references to Alfred-Little prior to August 2010

05 Apr 2011, 09:40 AM


Zach Mansell, Contributor
The management has put out a point-by-point rebuttle of his original research report that you can view on
their website. There is not much more that we can do except to speculate on what the final outcome might be
as KPMG has yet to pull their audit opinion.


The evidence against the company is compelling but there is no way to know until we have the results of the
investigation. Even if it doesn't turn out to be a fraud, there is growing evidence that China may start doing
something about these reverse-mergers that were created to get through a legal loophole to have such
substantial amounts of foreign investment.


Between the fraud and the uncertainty of the future legality of this business structuring, it would seems as if
the China reverse mergers market is almost completely uninvestable...even for the legitimate promising
companies that all of us were hoping to find amidst the rubble and ruin.

As far as I know there has not been one. To be completely honest, I have done no research at all on the
company that supposedly has taken the videos but, given the unscrupulous nature of many in this "shorting
space", I take everything that shorts say with a grain of salt (that goes for those who are long the stock too).

As far as I'm concerned, videos can be doctored and edited and etc. and since I know nothing about the firm
who posted the video and have not taken the time to research them I put little faith in the video as evidence of
anything. I cannot even certain if it's CBEHs facility in the video as of now.


There is no way for me to be certain, but I hardly care at this point. I'm not long or short the stock, I was
simply answering a question.


I'm becoming increasingly skeptical about these companies but only after it was too late. Neither one of the
companies I followed, or invested in, has been accused of fraud yet but both have suffered from implications
of the related firms. As I mentioned above, even if these companies aren't frauds the newly forming questions
about the legality of the structure of these companies will be what we have to worry about next. Multiples will
likely remain depressed for a long time. It's looking as if longs are fighting a losing battle even if they were
able to find the diamonds in the rough.

China Integrated Energy is one of the only four non-state-owned companies in Shaanxi province licensed to
distribute both finished oil and heavy oil nationwide. Furthermore, to the Company's knowledge, China
Integrated Energy is the only biodiesel manufacturer in China that has a distribution license. It is required by
law that biodiesel, which is defined as a finished oil product, has to be distributed by a vendor that has a
distribution license. The Company's distribution channels and sales network, established over the past 10
years, have contributed significantly to the sales generated in its biodiesel segment. The Company has, and
will continue to leverage this distribution license advantage across the entire 200,000 MT of its production
capacity. This early-mover distribution license advantage is one factor that the Company believes allows its
biodiesel products to realize superior margins.

i think the price getting driven down is more often due to the pumpers dumping, than anything else. It seems
like when a company is pumped up, and the conspirators are dumping, all these frauds come out of the

dumping their shares for dollars after getting them for pennies.

There are reports called 'Threshold' by Nasdaq that list the stocks that have at least 10,000.00 blocks of
shares that were sold but not delivered by the sellers. That's a fact, try during it. Don't lie to make money. If
you can't pick good stocks at low prices, then go with the funds and be happy!!!!

with lot of people, rail and small trucks movements all around into the night. This goes against his statements,

Mr. Little owns China now. His reports carry more weight than any China analyst on Wall Street (and if you disagree,
name one).


IMHO, none of these companies, IPO or RTO, should trade at a PE above 1 until Mr. Little allows them to. If Mr. Little
says shut them down, then they should be shut down immediately.


CBEH + KPMG + Internal Controls = Complete joke. Wish I could listen in on that KPMG auditor try to explain to
investors how he lost about $300MM for them because his team didn't bother to check if they actually produced
anything. That's hilarious.


But does he get fired or thrown in jail? No, he's probably on to his next job by now. Will CBEH's CFO and CEO go to
jail? No.


I LOVE SHORTING CHINA!!! I LOVE what a joke these Big 4 auditors are and love our dysfunctional SEC and
international legal system.

trucks. Phony!!!!

video to lie about a multi- million dollars factory and then spend millions more to built on to that factory without
putting it to work. If you going to do all of this, spend millions to built factories, then you might as well produce
the oil.


If you have the knowledge to put this together and fool Fidelity Management and Research Co., The
Vanguard Group, Blackrock, Wall Street Assoc., Calif. PERS the largest of it kind, and the Pennsylvania
PERS, plus many others. You might as well produce the oil. People will never trust you as alfred little.

Author’s reply »  Think about it: Since they aren't producing any biodiesel they certainly don't want to put it in
writing that they rely exclusively on tanker trucks to ship it out. Smarter for them to be vague and mention the
rail line next door. Leave their options open for explaining away their fraud.


So for the last time, quit debating it and just call IR and hear it for yourself. Susan Zhou will tell you they use
tanker trucks to ship biodiesel and to receive feedstock. I'd appreciate it if you'd cut and paste her email to

There it no doubt that tanker truckers are used to ship oil to users, but, the trucks picks up the oil from one of
four storage depots used by CBEH.  
The answer you are getting is incomplete and its something that you want hear and use for the video. Which
only shows days and nights with lots of movements, where is the video that shows that there is nothing going
on at the plant?


Produce it. Let us see for ourselves, the days and nights of idleness at the plant. Do that plus explain about
what is going on in the left side of the video and point out the rail road tracks on the map that was used to
keep the focus on the so called single entry point.

much lower than the capability(10,0000).


it is meet the truth. in China the material of Biodiesel is short . so

Doubts about IFRA:


IFRA is the company that provided "key video evidence" that AL refers to in his post. In the 3/31 post, he also says:
"Fortunately, large China-based investors appear to be rethinking their due diligence efforts and are more willing to
engage the services of intensive researchers such as Kroll, IFRA, Business Connect China or China Whys."


I know what Kroll does, but have never heard of the other three companies mentioned, so I went to check their
websites. The last two companies have legitimate-looking sites, with office locations, names of principals, etc. IFRA's
site looks strikingly different. It consists of exactly 4 pages, and the only contact info is this:


Hong Kong 
tel: +852 8121-1907 
Contact Person: Andrew Wong 
email: andrew@ifragroup.com


The site says that the company does business across 4 continents (Asia, Australia, U.K. and North America), and
covers 21 industries, including (quoting verbatim):

Yes, the second entry has a typo. For a professional-services firm that claims to employ "expert analysts ... with
decades of experience", things just don't add up.


The top hits returned by a Google search on the company name return the company's website + various references to
AL's reports. No new articles, no press releases, nothing about it being involved in any projects or consulting work.


Applying AL's standard of healthy skepticism to IFRA, one would conclude that it is not a real company. My
impression is that it is a shell used by shorts to make it appear as if the "investigations" that they refer to were carried
out by a qualified and independent third party.


06 Apr 2011, 12:53 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Despite their crummy website and lack of an office or other neat features, IFRA simply does
the best investigative research in China. Has any other firm ever produced a multi-month time-lapse
surveillance of company's factories? Do you have any idea what that costs or the risks involved? If after the
first week there were any reasonable signs of production do you think IFRA (and its client) would continue the
costly effort? There are dozens of fraudulent Chinese RTOs to short. IFRA spent this incredible effort on
CBEH precisely because it was such an easy target and so obviously a fraud. Otherwise they would move on
to an easier target. Anyone who thinks otherwise can just hold onto their long position and wait for it to go to
zero, which it will after KPMG pulls the audit, directors resign, and it becomes apparent that investors aren't
going to recover any money.

This guy is finished!!! It only takes a small or a Little amount of business sense to know that the tanker trucks are
picking up the oil from CBEH Four Storage Depots, but only rail is picking up from factory and taking it to storage
depots. This the way GM, F, Walmart and all companies with business knowledge do it. Rail first and then trucks. Why
would they have giant trucks driving all thru the country from one location. They are in business to save gas not to
waste it. Get another name, you're finished little man.

Alfred,


I wouldn't be so certain that the lawyer contacting you is trusthworthy. He is hired by CBEH. He likely is therefore
engaged to represent them and protect their interests. The lawyer may be an upstanding guy, or he may not be. Even
if he is upstanding, he may not have much power or say in what is done.


06 Apr 2011, 01:42 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Agreed. The scope of the engagement is certainly very restricted to trying to absolve first of all the
board of directors, and secondly the management, of any wrongdoing. It will be a weak investigation.


That said, CBEH is so obviously a scam that even the blindest investigator with his hands tied can realize it.


I am convinced the stock goes much lower.


06 Apr 2011, 04:04 PM

Yes, I certainly don't doubt your work and your conclusions. Seems like a no brainer. My only worry about the
stock price is if they are able to do any stock manipulation or phony trades back and forth to manipulate the

Some questions:


- Do you think that any institutional long-only investor will touch any US-listed Chinese company, especially a reverse
merger company, anytime soon? When faced with the headline risk and potential phone calls resulting from a
scandal, do you think that any mutual fund will want to report owning a single share in any of these US-listed
companies?

- How long do you think the Chinese authorities will tolerate the VIE structure and US listing, given the headlines they
are producing? Even The Economist wrote about this. I am sure they are fine as long as this just undermines the faith
in the US capital markets, but now I think this has become an issue that makes China look bad as well.


- After being embarrassed by Madoff, do you think SEC (and FBI) will allow these Chinese reverse mergers to remain
listed and issue shares via private placements? What do you think they will do to the research firms, underwriters,
hedge funds, stock spammers etc. that form the ecosystem that distributes these shares to public?


- If you were a reputable auditor, how would you price your audit services to these Chinese firms? What's the usual
price, $200k-$400k per audit (a pure guess)? Is there any reason why the big-4 auditors would allow their names to
be used by these US-listed Chinese companies for anything less than say 10x the current prices? The auditors do
have to protect their reputations, so perhaps they'll just refuse to audit these firms.


I think part of being successful in investing is simply understanding which way the wind blows.

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Nice questions:


1) Funds should definitely avoid the RTOs for a few more months until all the frauds are exposed.


2) Chinese authorities don't seem to care. But I suspect one or two bad guys might get severely punished.
Not hard for China to do.


3) SEC never does anything except to insider traders are far as I can tell. Oh, and they restrict short selling
making my job cleaning up this space harder!


4) Auditors don't have a chance against good chinese scams that typically hire professional audit consultants
to help them cook the books. For CBEH I think they paid a total of $700k to KPMG a I recall. What a waste.
Auditors are useless until they stop focusing on phony paper (contracts) and look at operations. Yes, it will
cost 2X.

On chinese reverse mergers, there is nothing magical good or bad - they are either legitimate companies making
profits with growth potential in a booming economy or scams. But just because they are chinese companies on a US
exchange does not make them automatically bad - that's as ignorant of saying someone is bad because of the color
of their skins, their religiion or where they were born.


As for CBEH, this is easy - either KMPG in its extended audit missed everything (physical plant activity, production
reports, cash received for goods, and actual bank accounts showing cash deposited for those goods that are not
prepaid) or the shorts have been using a very tactical attack very well timed (the day the audit was released) to lower
stock value and make money.


As for trucks versus rails - who cares. The real issue is did CBEH get paid by a third party for the delivery of goods
(biodiesel) and did that money go into the bank. That is the test of whether CBEH is producing and making money as

a legitimate company - not whether they transport by rail and/or truck.


I will say if it is a scam CBEH principals are going to jail. On the flip side, if it is a legitimate company then "Arthur
Little" is going to jail and getting sued by investors as well as the international "research" group that appears to be
comprised of and backed by short sellers.


We should know shortly as this is not brain surgery - Pillsbury and KMPG are very good and they have specific things

My reply is to what Little is saying about the secret time-lapse video, this video is the key part of his evidence
against CBEH, but it only show days of heavy activities at the factory.


He writes about idle days at the factory, but, he has no video evidence of such idleness, so he should not
write about something that he has no video proof, his video only proof that the factory is not idle as he states
and I don't know what article you are writing about.


But, what I do know is that CBEH ships its oils from factory to 4 storage depots by rail and that the video
shows rail activites on the left side of screen, until the camera person moves the camera, on the 2nd or 3rd
day, until rails cannot be seen in video.

You don't seem to know what you are talking about. 
Do you know what Pillsbury does? They defend companies against lawsuits, whether the company is guilty or
not. They may know or believe that a company is liable, but they will argue and defend that company and try
to get them off. 
Obvioiusly, you have never litigated against Pillsbury. Otherwise, you wouldn't think they were so respected. 
In other words, I can't stand Pillsbury and I certainly believe that they would do unethical things to defend
companies. In fact, I believe they have - on many occassions.

BTW someone asked why the shorts would have an incentive to be so active in providing information. If the stock
really is a dog, then why not just short it, release the facts, and then let the stock fall as it will?


They probably have an incentive to undercut the stock on the way down because, even if they're right (which I'm not
confident of) the value of CBEH is likely not zero. But if they can clobber it down close to zero, and it has a value of
$2, then they can reverse their position and make a chunk of $ on the upside. Win-win.


Otherwise you are correct, they have no incentive to keep feeding information. No financial professional is going to
spend the time unless they get something out of it. Unless they are altruists (LOL!) they have a reason for going
beyond the release of the original reports to quickly drive the stock down.


And they could also be a complete fraud. The author already noted he lives in China. Does anyone really think the US
could ever prosecute such a person? What if he lives somewhere else with no rule of law? These anonymous
dumpers will never be prosecuted no matter how big the fraud they generate. They just cash out their short position,
disappear and come back later as another anonymous poster.


This is why our society runs on people using their own names. Mr. Little, you are a coward. And if you are lying, mark
my words, you will face the wrath of those you have defrauded.

Press release on SOX 404 compliance dated January 10th, 2011


ir.stockpr.com/chinain...


<< 
China Integrated Energy Completes SOX 404 Compliance Program 
XI'AN, China, Jan. 10, 2011 /PRNewswire-Asia-First... -- China Integrated Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBEH) (the
"Company"), a leading non-state-owned integrated energy company in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), today
announced that the Company has completed the implementation of its internal controls over financial reporting for
fiscal year 2010 with the requirements of Article 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ("SOX 404").


As previously announced, on August 5, 2009, the Company engaged KPMG to review its internal controls and to
provide the corresponding recommendations for gaps/issues noted for fiscal year 2010. The Company has completed
the implementation of SOX 404 based on KPMG's recommendations.


Mr. Albert Pu, CFO of China Integrated Energy said, "We are committed to sound corporate governance, and our
SOX 404 compliance program is an important element in strengthening our internal controls. For our upcoming fourth
quarter and full year 2010 financial results, we look forward to working with KPMG as our new auditor, as well as our
other financial and legal advisors, as we continuously strive to maintain our financial integrity."


Mr. Gao Xincheng, CEO of China Integrated Energy said, "The completion of the Sarbanes Oxley Section 404
implementation is a major achievement for our company. As a healthy and growing public company, we will continue
to invest in new employees and systems to make sure we have the best internal and financial reporting
infrastructure."


Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, U.S.-listed companies are required to file in their Annual Report on
Form 10-K, a report that includes management's assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of the end
of the company's most recent fiscal year, which includes a statement as to whether or not such controls are effective.
China Integrated Energy's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, must also include an
attestation report from KPMG, the Company's new auditor, on its internal control over financial reporting.

Mr. Little, perhaps I have missed it but could you explain the mechanics of how this (alleged) fraud was perpetrated.
Did they purchase a defunct refinery and dress it up to look like a biodiesel plant or build something from scratch?
How much would this have cost and when was it done? And how much do you presume they have netted after
transferring investor inputs into private hands? 
Thanks


20 Apr 2011, 02:54 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  They purchased an old oil/diesel storage facility that they turned into a biodiesel plant that
couldn't turn a profit so they made up phony earnings to raise money from dumb american investors. The
netted between 70-80% of what they raised in the U.S.

Stock Market(R) (Nasdaq:NDAQ - News) announced that trading was halted today in China Integrated Energy, Inc.
(Nasdaq:CBEH - News) at 16:29:00 p.m., Eastern Time, for "additional information requested" from the company at a
last price of $1.84.


Trading will remain halted until China Integrated Energy, Inc. has fully satisfied NASDAQ's request for additional
information.


20 Apr 2011, 10:32 PM

what information was NASDAQ looking for? Was it something like, where is your business and where is the cash?
Why didn't CBEH provide the requested info?

Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Folks it is all over now. Board/CFO/auditor resignations surely come next. The investigation is
pointless now. CBEH could not answer my allegations and they couldn't even answer NASDAQ's undoubtedly softball
questions. This is the first sign CBEH will "go dark" as I've warned. U.S. investors get nothing. Sorry TM and friends. I
am sorry you longs had to learn the hard way. There are many more good trades ahead so hopefully you can make
back your losses. Stay tuned!

Ouch! Sorry tmbiogen. You may have hated us before but now you at least understand us (and will in time forgive us).
This one's going to hurt... not sure which is worse for you- losing all your $ or realizing you were fighting the whole
time for the crooks who were robbing you blind.


So who should you be mad at? It's no longer us. Is it the SEC who knowingly allows these types of companies to be
listed without a sound punishment system for the fraudsters (and yes, the SEC KNOWS they shouldn't have let
companies list in the US w/out punishment controls in place- it's unethical of them)? Is it KPMG for failing to do the
one thing they are paid $$$$ to do- verify a biz exists? Is it the bogus Sarbannes-Oxley internal control bull sh*t which
is supposed to prevent fraud and re-assure investors? Is it the scumbag CEO and CFO who screwed around w/ you
the whole time and now are worth millions? Is it China's gvt- they sure as hell aren't getting involved- it's not their $
that's being stolen? Or the sell-side analysts who put out $15 CBEH price targets and get paid $500k/yr to report on
10 companies and know simple things like if their companies exist?


LMFAO!!!


I'm curious... who are you most angry with?

22 Apr 2011, 11:06 AM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The T12 halt is likely due to management's inability or unwillingness to adequately answer
questions from NASDAQ. "Categorical Denial" didn't convince investors CBEH was real, and it certainly won't
work with NASDAQ. Board/CFO/auditor resignations surely come next.

Alfred,


Even if CBEH is a fraud, are you not worried about your short position with the "halt". Rumor is that CBEH is delaying
responses to NASDAQ and timing the completion of the 3rd party investigation until they are allowed to implement
their stock buy back. So even if you are right and they are a fraud, with the amount of naked short positions out there,
there could still be a huge short squeeze.


That would be an odd development in this drama. Is there anything you can do if that is indeed CBEH's next move?


24 Apr 2011, 10:11 AM


Shindoesca
As of 4/21/2011 11PM, CBEH is on the Regulation SHO Threshold Securities List for violation of Rule 203c.  
That is, for at least 5 consecutive settlement days there were aggregate failures to deliver in short sales of
10,000 or more shares. Could this mean that sufficient real shares are not available for large shorts to cover?  
Could it be that the additional info requested for removing the T12 halt, has been requested not from CBEH
but rather from the brokers handling the large short sales? 
Time will tell, but given the CCP buy-in regulations brokers need to comply with through their CMF this halt in
some ways affects short-side parties much more in the short term, of which the company I assume is also
aware, perhaps dictating the underlying process.


24 Apr 2011, 12:13 PM


ziggy59
Why would they buy their stock back if they are a fraud , come on , don't take to much in what the message boards
are saying, the shorts and longs do not know what is going on . We will just have to wait and see , I'm hoping there is
no fraud , with the letter the company wrote they denied everything , so if they are a fraud they deserve whats coming
to them . This could take a while to settle, I hope we find out what information the Nasdaq is requesting soon. So if
anyone has $$ tied into this stock , we all will just have to wait to see how this pans out , If they are a fraud alot of
people will lose money .(including myself )

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.


On April 28, 2011, the board of directors (the "Board") of China Integrated Energy, Inc. (the "Company") appointed Mr.
Steven Markscheid as a director and a member and Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Board determined that Mr.
Markscheid is an "independent director" as that term is defined in accordance with Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace
Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC and Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended.


Mr. Markscheid, aged 57, has been an independent director of CNinsure, Inc. since August 2007, of JinkoSolar
Holding Co., Ltd since September 2009, and of China Energy Corporation since June, 2010. He also has been chief
executive officer of Synergenz BioScience Inc. since 2007, and member of Emerald Hill Capital Partners' investment
committee since 2006. Mr. Markscheid was previously representative of US China Business Council from 1978 to
1983, vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank from 1984 to 1988, vice president of First Chicago Bank from 1988 to
1993, case leader of Boston Consulting Group from 1994 to 1997, director of business development of GE Capital
(Asia Pacific) from 1998 to 2001, director of business development of GE Capital from 2001 to 2002, senior vice
president of GE Healthcare Financial Services from 2003 to 2006, chief executive officer of HuaMei Capital Company,
Inc. from 2006 to 2007. He received his bachelor's degree in East Asian studies from Princeton University in 1976, his
master's degree in international affairs and economics from Johns Hopkins University in 1980 and an MBA degree
from Columbia University in 1991.


On April 28, 2011, the Company and Mr. Markscheid executed an Independent Director Agreement (the "Agreement")
in connection with Mr. Markscheid's appointment, pursuant to which Mr. Markscheid will be entitled to receive an
annual compensation of $100,000. In addition, the Company granted Mr. Markscheid an option to purchase up to One
Hundred Thousand (100,000) shares of common stock of the Company with an exercise price equal to the fair market
value of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant of the option and vesting annually, in equal
installments for a three year period.


The foregoing description of the material terms of the Independent Director Agreement is qualified in its entirety by a
form of such agreement included with this 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.

Policeman
Why would an honorable respected man like Steven Markscheid want to be on the BOD of a "scam" company? To
help Wang? huh? Then why did Goldman leave and abandon Wang? Wouldn't it be better for Wang to resign? Is
Steven Markscheid supposed to expose the "scam"? Does the "scam" company not know this? Do they want to help
get themselves found out? How is Steven Markscheid going to find out anything more than Goldman? What the heck
is going here? Clearly that there is more to this whole story going on behind the scenes.

Does everyone in China fall for this "honorable" man nonsense, or this "reputable" company garbage. Seems

Author’s reply »  $100k to help his buddy Chris Wang avoid personal liability as a long time director of a scam
company. Markscheid has no liability himself since he was not there when the company cheated investors. He gets
$100k regardless.

Well, the addresses with maps are on their website. Your articles are written like a high school reporter.

investing man
Alfred,


Show me that you do not just make up stuff without any foundation whatsoever. I know how Gao Xincheng and
Steven Markscheid are connected.


But I do not believe that Christopher Wang had any prior connections to Steven Markscheid . So when you say he
joined to protect his buddy. Can you show me any history where they worked together or even know each other?


Or are you just slinging stuff to wall.....


30 Apr 2011, 04:51 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Investing Man, if you are correct then I stand corrected. Everyone, I agree that Steven
Markscheid may be trying to help his buddy Gao Xincheng and not Chris Wang who he may not know
previously. I was wrong. BIG DEAL


02 May 2011, 01:41 AM


investing man
I suppose if "no big deal" means that you do not care about getting the facts and real truth out, then so be it..


If Steve was hired to protect his buddy Wang that is one thing. If he did not, then that is another thing. So I
guess it is clear from your response that getting information right and or saying things that are not factual is
simply "no big deal".


03 May 2011, 05:01 PM


Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
investing man:


perhaps a course in reading comprehension? no big deal clearly meant that the mistake in the facts was not
significant or material. You see, some mistakes are very significant and material, and others are of little
signifance and immaterial. I am sure you can understand the difference.

Deer Consumer Products, Inc. Issues Warning Concerning Evidence of Illegal Short Selling of DEER Stock by "Alfred
Little" and Others, to Seek Sanctions Against The Rosen Law Firm for Filing a Frivolous "Class Action" Complaint


Monday, 02 May 2011 09:11


NEW YORK, May 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Deer Consumer Products, Inc. (Nasdaq: DEER) (website:
www.deerinc.com/), a leading provider of "DEER" branded consumer products to Chinese consumers and a leading
vertically integrated manufacturer of small household and kitchen appliances for global customers, publicly
announces today that the Company has received additional evidence of continuing illegal short selling in DEER stock.


The Company believes its common stock has been manipulated in collusion among "naked" short sellers, which may
include U.S. and off-shore based hedge funds/individuals that distribute false and fabricated information concerning
the Company via various websites and blogs, including through SeekingAlpha.com, a website owned by Seeking
Alpha Ltd., an Israeli company.


In what appears to be a part of this attempted manipulation, a purported class action complaint was filed against the
Company by The Rosen Law Firm. This complaint is expressly based upon the false and defamatory reports
concerning the Company that were authored by a fictitious character - "Alfred Little" and published by Seeking Alpha
Ltd. even though Seeking Alpha Ltd. had deleted certain false reports prior to the filing of the complaint. Litigation
counsel for DEER has notified The Rosen Law Firm that the complaint contains numerous false and inaccurate
allegations and the Company will seek sanctions against the plaintiff and The Rosen Law Firm if the complaint is not
withdrawn in its entirety.


BACKGROUND FACTS:


During the months of March and April 2011, the Company believes that an attempted market manipulation scheme by
illegal short sellers acting in collusion caused DEER's share price to plunge from more than $11 per share on March



https://seekingalpha.com/user/905055

21 to as low as $6.12 on April 4 on heavy daily volume, causing a temporary loss of approximately $165 million in
market capitalization for DEER's shareholders.


To protect DEER's shareholders and as a matter of good corporate governance, DEER has repeatedly confirmed that
its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its latest annual report, 10-K filing with audited
financials are accurate and are in full compliance with SEC disclosure requirements. DEER has also affirmed its 2011
earnings guidance and a dividend policy. In addition, DEER paid initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on
April 14 to shareholders of record on March 31. DEER has hosted numerous visits by independent research analysts,
institutional investors and global investment banks. The Company notes that DEER's share price has recovered
approximately 66% since April 4 to a closing price of $10.14 on April 29.


ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF ILLEGAL SHORT SELLING:


At present, a large number of DEER shares sold short have failed to settle for 30 consecutive settlement days, which
indicates naked short positions that still exist today. The number of such shares has exceeded 700,000 shares on
certain trading days. Also, according to publicly available market data, DEER's common stock has been on the list of
Nasdaq's "Threshold" securities under the SEC REG SHO rules, for at least 30 consecutive settlement days,
indicating failure to settle trades among securities clearing firms for more than 30 consecutive settlement days.


As one part of a broader plan to take steps to protect the Company and its shareholders from this apparent illicit short
selling activity, DEER's litigation counsel has communicated and will continue to communicate with the legal and
compliance departments of various securities clearing and custodian firms to warn them of possible illegal short
selling activities still taking place in DEER's common stock and to discover information concerning share delivery
obligations and compliance with U.S. securities laws. DEER is optimistic about receiving full cooperation from these
registered clearing firms.


DEER intends to discover and take legal actions against all parties that assist and abet in the illegal short selling
activities in DEER.


"ALFRED LITTLE" DOES NOT EXIT, USES FABRICATED BIOGRAPHY TO DEFRAUD THE GENERAL PUBLIC


The Company believes that "Alfred Little" is a fictitious character - a disguise used by one or more illegal short sellers
in the short sale scheme against DEER and other public companies. According to our investigation, "Alfred Little" is
not a real person. His "professional biography" published on his website and on SeekingAlpha.com was fabricated,
with the purpose to mislead and defraud the investing public. "Alfred Little's" published biography includes claims that
he had years of experience as an auditor at Deloitte, worked for large global companies and had years of investment
experience in China, published a book on China, etc. cannot be verified. Further, in the attack on DEER, "Alfred Little"
published a 3 month old prepaid phone card that was never used as his purported contact number for concerned
investors. In addition, "Alfred Little" quoted statements from several Chinese government officials as witnesses to
support his various false allegations against DEER. These Chinese officials in fact do not exist. "Alfred Little" further
made false allegations on his "channel checks" of Chinese retail stores while he failed to disclose his naked short
positions in DEER and ignored DEER's repeated public disclosure about the Company's product distribution process
as well as its corporate structure. "Alfred Little's" various articles, timely published in collusion with short sellers who
immediately sold large blocks of DEER's stock in market orders that intentionally created fear in the general public to
drive down DEER's share price. Short sellers have profited handsomely at the expense of DEER's thousands of

shareholders. DEER will continue its vigorous investigation and discovery of the network of illegal short sellers that
have damaged the reputation and destroyed value in U.S. listed public companies.


DEER TO SEEK SANCTIONS AGAINST PURPORTED "CLASS ACTION" PLAINTIFF'S LAW FIRM


On April 29, 2011, "The Rosen Law Firm" filed a "class action" complaint against the Company on behalf of "James
Rose", an individual who allegedly purchased 2,000 shares of DEER common stock during 2010. The Company
strongly denies the allegations in the complaint and counsel for DEER has already notified The Rosen Law Firm that
the Company intends to seek sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure against The Rosen
Law Firm if the complaint is not withdrawn in its entirety.


The Company also notes the following concerning the purported class action complaint by The Rosen Law Firm:


1. The complaint was filed in total disregard of the Company's prior warnings concerning illegal short selling activities
in DEER.


2. The complaint is explicitly based on the false and defamatory reports authored by an "Alfred Little" and published
by Seeking Alpha Ltd. But the Company believes that "Alfred Little" does not exist and is a fictitious character - a
disguise used by one or more illegal short sellers in the short sale scheme against DEER and other companies
publicly traded on U.S. stock exchanges.


3. The complaint includes false and defamatory allegations that were contained in an article published on
SeekingAlpha.com that Seeking Alpha Ltd. removed from the web-site after receiving true and accurate information
from the Company. The Company believes that The Rosen Law Firm's willingness to include such allegations in the
complaint under such circumstances demonstrates extreme recklessness and an utter disregard of the truth.


DEER IS FOCUSED ON GROWING A STRONG COMPANY

Ah, if this is true, it makes sense as DEER is saying that it didn't sue any real person and so does not have any real
lawsuit. According to them, Alfred Little is a fictitious person. You can't sue a fictitious person. My guess is that the
Rosen Law Firm will have DEER for lunch.

man. I am Robert Davis.

Robert, I'm going to let you in on a little secret. To find Alfred Little,


1) Fly to the Beijing Intl Airport. 
2) Go exactly 247 miles due east 
3) Then go 44 miles due south. You will come to a bridge. 
4) Exit your car. 
5) Follow the river under the bridge for 1.4 miles east. 
6) You will see a small river shack. 
7) Enter the shack and take the stairs down to the basement. 
8) There you will find Alfred Little. Good luck my friend.


No wait.... my bad. That's where Alfred Bittle lives. Sorry. I always get those two mixed up. Alfred Bittle is that other
guy who shorts Cambodian stocks.


Keep your head up Robert. There's no fraud in China. Just evil short sellers who make it all up. The market will revert
to fair value so you'll win in the end anyway. Thanks for setting us straight.

Rdavis2013:


Here's the 'reports' on KPMG's resignation (FYI, filed two days ago):


www.sec.gov/Archives/e...


Which, if you noticed is a SEC filing. 
You'll also note in this same filing they state:


"its previously issued audit reports dated March 16, 2011 related to the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, and the related consolidated statement of income and
comprehensive income, stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for the year then ended and effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 should no longer be relied upon."


Here's the 'report' on director resignation:


www.sec.gov/Archives/e...


Again, this is a SEC filing stating a member of the Audit Committee resigned, along with the CHIEF
FINANCIAL OFFICER resigning.

So a company has its auditing firm - KPMG - resign and state the previous financial statements should no
longer be relied upon.  
This same company has a member of its board of directors, and more importantly is also a member of its
Audit Committee, resign. 
Finally, this same company has its CFO also resign, all within a week's time. 
How can anyone see all this and think it is not a bad thing?!? Really? 
Are you familiar with the phrase "Rats deserting a sinking ship"?


04 May 2011, 01:26 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
The reason I never bother with Rdavis2013's comment was he always makes up imaginary things like these
to waste your time. In the end, I'm sure what he has achieved anyways. CBEH is down a net 20% since he
started commenting on it. Yet, people like him still wouldn't admit this is just another giant fraud. LIke the other
poster here mentioned, answers to all of your "questions" can be found by simply spending 5 minutes reading
public SEC filings.


04 May 2011, 03:49 PM


Rdavis2013
Yeah, yeah. Its not over just yet, its seems like all they have is concealed transactions and related party
transactions, these are harder to prove. But, a big empty factory with no action is easy to prove and shouldn't
take this long to prove.... Paying money under the table is almost a given, to me, in China. I have seen it
before with CHNG. They got over it and kept what they paid for...nothing like this surprises me. So, we'll see
with CBEH. And once again good luck to the longs on this....


10 May 2011, 10:52 PM


Alfred Little, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Enough said on CBEH. Everyone who was anyone resigned there. CBEH has gone dark now. Let's
focus on SCEI, which still has a heartbeat at $3.50 last trade. It is an even more obvious fraud than CBEH and will be
halted soon enough.

Is Global Hunter really so bad? It was my understanding that Global Hunter was only involved with 3 or so of
the 40-45 that have been alleged frauds so far.


Still not an attractive track record but it beats other firms in the space by leaps and bounds. I would HATE to

half.
