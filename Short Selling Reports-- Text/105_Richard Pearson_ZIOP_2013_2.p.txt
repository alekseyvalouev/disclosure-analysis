Why Retail Got Slaughtered On Ziopharm
Mar. 27, 2013 5:42 AM ET15 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Shares of Ziopharm Oncology (NASDAQ:ZIOP) plunged by 65% to $1.82 on Tuesday
when it released news that its only late stage drug candidate failed to meet its primary
endpoint. For now, there isn't much of a play except for those who may wish to bet on
some further downside.


No one can truly predict in advance the outcome of Phase III trials; however, with
Ziopharm there were a steady stream of clues that investors should be skeptical about its
prospects. At $2.00-$3.00, some investors could have been justified in investing in
Ziopharm, but at nearly $6.00 the risk / return profile became downright silly.


Although I am currently working on my next report, I thought it would be useful to weigh in
on how investors can try to avoid the next Ziopharm or at least minimize the damage from
it.


The purpose of this article today is not to say "I told you so." Instead the purpose is to
highlight the areas where investors went wrong and to hopefully allow investors to avoid
similarly large losses in the future.


The lessons to be learned from Ziopharm are as follows:


Lesson 1 - Be wary of low institutional ownership


During its life, Ziopharm was always a stock with low institutional ownership. A few years
ago, famed billionaire and genius biotech investors Randal Kirk began investing in
Ziopharm, which in turn attracted Fidelity to invest. Aside from these two players,
Ziopharm remained a largely retail stock for a long time.


There is nothing wrong with investing in retail dominated stocks, but they should certainly
require a discounted price. Institutional investors deploy armies of well-trained analysts
and vast amount of financial resources for one single purpose: they want to make money.


In most cases, if a certain stock presents a compelling value opportunity, it will certainly
attract institutional attention. The lesson to be learned is that retail stocks which trade at
premium valuations are very dangerous. It is better to wait and buy in at a time when the
share price is weak rather than chase the valuations higher. If no such opportunity
presents itself then it is best to not play at all.

Lesson 2 - "Who wants to be a billionaire"


Investing has always been difficult and there are no easy formulas for making money.
Individual stocks must stand upon their own merits.


Yet with Ziopharm, we can see that droves of retail investors simply took the view that if
they bought what Randal Kirk had bought then they could get rich too.


Anyone who has followed Kirk's investing career knows that Kirk should really be
considered a genius within the world of biotech. However, in the case of Ziopharm, the
prospects of the company simply did not match up to the share price.


This is not a case of 20/20 hindsight just because the drug failed. Prior to its failure,
Ziopharm could have been considered (by some) to present a sensible risk/reward profile
at $2.00-$3.00.


In trying to make themselves mini-billionaires, many investors seemed to ignore the fact
that Kirk has invested on terms which were different than the rest of the market, obtaining
an in-price of just $1.91.


This was true even though he continued to buy lesser amounts of shares even at prices
above $5.00.


Kirk is currently using Ziopharm as a vehicle to advance his Intrexon drug technology. As
a result, with Ziopharm now sitting at multi-year lows below at $1.82, he may even
consider buying the entire company to further that goal. This will be of small comfort to
anyone who was paying over $5.00 last week.


For a billionaire investor, it is largely irrelevant whether he purchases the remainder of the
company at $1.00 or at $6.00. He will still own the entire company and will still have plenty
of money to spare.


The key lesson to be learned is that if you're not a billionaire then don't try to invest like
one.


Lesson 3 - Don't shoot the messenger


I first wrote on Ziopharm back in October of 2012 following several months of research.
The share price dropped by more than 30% to below $3.30. Yet Ziopharm issued an
aggressive response and the share price rebounded to well above where it was prior to
my article.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1303091-why-retail-got-slaughtered-on-ziopharm 3/10


Investors may now want to ask themselves "what sort of response would you expect from
the company?"


Of course, investors would not expect a company whose share price is falling to release a
statement that says "the shorts are right." Nor would we expect the company to say
nothing. Instead, Ziopharm did what was expected and put forth a statement that
assembled as many positive data points as possible without actually refuting a single point
that I had made.


At that time, investors were in a uniquely advantageous position. They were now in
possession of substantial amounts of negative information and yet were able to sell at a
price which was actually higher than when the information was released.


The lesson to be learned is that investors should evaluate all new information based upon
its own merits and not unfairly discount new information because it is negative or because
it contradicts the investor's original opinion. Investors can avoid substantial losses by
giving a fair evaluation of opinions from people who hold drastically opposing views.


Lesson 4 - Retail oriented stocks are wildly market-inefficient


Back in November, Ziopharm announced that results of its upcoming Phase III trial would
be delayed until March. This was the case even though as late as October Ziopharm had
continued to tell investors to expect near-term results. The delay caused Ziopharm to
begin a moderate (rather than speedy) descent to below $4.00 within the coming 8-12
weeks.


Yet as the key March deadline approached (and as risk increased), the share price
skyrocketed to nearly $6.00.


It is quite clear that many investors regarded the rising share price as a market-efficient
vote of confidence that results would be good. Instead, what really happened is that more
and more retail investors simply hopped on to a fast moving train at ever increasing
speeds. It was a classic self fueling and market-inefficient bubble.


Likewise, when the stock rebounded following my initial negative article, many retail
investors simply decided that the conclusions could simply be disregarded because the
"efficient" market had already cast its vote.


The lesson to be learned is that retail-driven stocks are subject to periods of euphoria
where investors are simply looking for any new reason to buy a stock while disregarding
sell signs which become increasingly obvious.

Lesson 5 - The shorts might not be as stupid as you think


Hopefully it will not escape the attention of most readers that Ziopharm did in fact have a
meaningful institutional presence. But rather than being long, these institution were
overwhelmingly short Ziopharm and in sizeable amounts.


When my article was released in October, many retail investors began posting on bulletin
boards that it was just a transparent ploy by which shorts were hoping to exit a
skyrocketing stock in which they were trapped.


Yet when the subsequent short interest numbers were released, it could be seen that short
interest actually increased slightly rather than decreasing.


The conclusion to be had was that rather than scampering to exit a stock in which they
were trapped, the shorts had tremendous conviction. Rather than covering their short
position with a gain of over 40%, they waited until the final results due to their certainty
that fair value was in fact far lower.


The only thing more dangerous than investing in a retail-dominated stock is investing in a
retail-dominated stock with a huge short interest ratio. Short investors tend to
overwhelmingly be institutional rather than retail and have the resources to conduct
research which is far more thorough than what they refer to as "dumb retail."


On the short side, potential losses are unlimited. An investor who was short Ziopharm
could easily have lost 100% or even 300% of his initial investment. Even now that they
have been proven right, short investors are still only making around 65% vs. the recent
prices in the $5.00 range.


This is the exact opposite of long investors who stood to make several hundred percent
gains with no cost of borrowing shares and with a fixed limit to their downside.


As a result, those investors who chose to get short Ziopharm needed to do a tremendous
amount of work to get comfortable with their position. The fact that the short interest was
very large meant that conviction was very large and was backed by sizeable institutions.


In fact, when put up against this, it seems that retail simply didn't stand a chance.


The lesson to be learned here is that shorts are not dumb investors. In fact, by necessity
they need to be significantly smarter than long investors with most of their position. This
applies doubly so to volatile healthcare and biotech stocks. If the short interest is high in a
stock with low institutional (i.e. long) investment - then stay away.

Lesson 6 - Don't get Charlie Browned


Every time Charlie Brown made a full speed run towards the football, Lucy would pull the
ball away and Charlie Brown would land on his head yelling "ugh!" Not long thereafter,
Lucy would again hold up a football and Charlie Brown would once again run full speed,
learning nothing from his previous pain.


The failure of Palifosfamide was not the first disappointment from Ziopharm, instead it was
just the most dramatic. As I noted in a previous article, Ziopharm had for years been
delivering failures and breaking promises. But in each case Ziopharm would come up with
a newer and better reason to hype the stock. In each case, Ziopharm would hold up the
football and say "trust me Charlie Brown, this time it's different." Retail continued to run at
the ball full speed.


Now once again, Ziopharm is attempting to divert the attention of investors away from the
failed Palifosfamide and on to its new and compelling DNA platform in connection with
Randal Kirk's Intrexon. Investors will once again have the opportunity to run full speed
while Ziopharm holds the football for them.


When a company delivers failures, its stock should trade at a discount until it delivers
some form of concrete proof that it can really deliver more than just a new set of promises
and hope.


Lesson 7 - The dangers of group-think


At some point in the life of a stock, it becomes a great time to sell. This is the case even
when one likes both the company and the product. This is just another way of saying "buy
low, sell high" will always beat "buy low, sell never."


Yet retail stocks are prone to both group-think and cheerleading. With Ziopharm, it was
consistently the case that a small number of vocal authors would shout down any hint of
criticism no matter how well founded. As the share price rose, these authors would simply
increase their level of optimism to an ever higher share price target. According to these
authors, the right time to sell Ziopharm was never.


The uber-bullish authors have every right to express their opinions and every right to
invest in line with those opinions. However, it is up to the rest of us to determine if they
have drank too much of their own Kool Aid and if they are indiscriminately shouting down
useful information about when to exit the trade.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1303091-why-retail-got-slaughtered-on-ziopharm 6/10


The lesson to be learned is that when a small number vocal authors continue to pump a
stock at higher and higher prices while disregarding any suggestions to sell, then that is
probably a good time to get out before the stock corrects.


Conclusion


Again, the purpose of this article is not to say "I told you so" and it is not a case of 20/20
hindsight. Instead it is my hope that investors who are tempted to chase the next great
retail lottery ticket may think twice about some very obvious risk factors.


Oftentimes there is a very good reason why institutions have passed on owning a given
stock and have left it overwhelmingly in the hands of retail investors. In many cases, some
institutions may have been early investors, but then exited when retail investors pushed
the price up to irrational levels.


When the only institutions who have interest in a stock are overwhelmingly interested on
the short side, retail investors should start to question whether they are really investing on
a level playing field. They need to ask if they have the information and the resources to
fully understand a complex situation and to accurately monitor any new developments. In
most cases the answer will be no.


In the case of Ziopharm, the company had delivered a stream of disappointments and
broken promises yet it still retained a fanatical following among retail authors and
investors who kept assuring one another that the right time to sell was never.


If investing was as easy as simply riding the coat tails of famous billionaires, then the rest
of us could all become billionaires too. But as we can see from Ziopharm, billionaires
seldom get that way by making open market purchases at all-time-high prices. When
Randal Kirk continued to buy Ziopharm at prices above $5.00, many retail investors
assumed that tremendous further upside was virtually guaranteed. Yet following the recent
65% plunge in the stock, Kirk is now showing a paper loss of only 5%. The lesson here is:
that's why he's a billionaire and the rest of us are not.

positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any

Great points all. We get to a little under $1 for ZIOP, but we'll see. It is probably worth covering at least some here due
to the uncertainly around R.J. Kirk. Your point on RJ was a crucial one: he is a winner (or at least "tier") in all of this.
He did not overpay, on average. He has a reason to own ZIOP utterly unrelated to this week's news. I have invested
with him in the past and am investing alongside him now on an unrelated matter. I am a big fan of his investing, but
also know that his situation has little in common with outside passive minority ZIOP holders. More on shorting

According to Yahoo Finance, institutional ownership is 58%. That doesn't seem all that low to me. I looked at a few
other pharmas (ACT 87% ARNA 46%, BMY 68%, IMGN 83%, MRK 75%, PFE 73%) and while they are on the lower
end, they are not an outlier by any means. What is the threshold below which you consider it to be low institutional
ownership?

Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  In the past the institutional ownership was more like 40% but it rose some over time. It is
always a little difficult to get an exact number because it seems there are always bad or late data included.


The point I was trying to make (which I guess I wasn't clear) is that if we exclude Kirk and Fidelity (who was
likely only in because of Kirk), then inst ownership is almost nil.


With the presence of Kirk and Fido in there then we should have expected to see total institutional ownership
of at least 80-85%, but instead it was the remainder of all retail.


Sorry, I should have been more clear.

richard,


thanks for your article .... it's not easy to write after things happen ... and still remain interesting .... and helpful.


I agree on many of your comments, if not all .... I understand investing in biopharm developers appears sometimes
like joining a Las Vegas table, but, at the end of day, there are always hidden indicators which can help read through
the unknown ....


it's mandatory to step out of the box and look always for them .... I think that's what billionaires do every day .... and
we don't.

Hats off to you sir! My apologies for being critical of your stance and position, and I guess I was a bit aggravated that
you were able to use your position at Forbes to generate your story while making money on the short. But since I
have come to understand that that is perfectly legit. Also, a few things I had read about the stability of Pali and other
points seemed to go against what you said. Still, with the controversy I should have stayed away. But at least I was
not so greedy and did not lose more than 5% of my portfolio. And you see Kirk win again and again, yes, you tend to
think that he would be always smart on his investment and where he places his millions. He did say Pali would be
later seen as a rounding error, so it will be interesting to see if he(Kirk) buys much more of ZIOP, and how they put

more of the story out there for the public to see. I also have interest in ONCS, which appears to have some
similar(slight) IL-12 technology, and is dirt cheap(maybe for a reason) at 21 cents. Thanks!

Rick, I am really appreciative of your efforts on this as well as your public disclosure of your findings. Your article and
posts forced me to look deeper. The more I went back and looked at Dr. Lewis' public comments, certain
inconsistencies in trial accrual timing (announced expectations versus eventual actual accrual announcment), public
statements about how palifosfamide targets stem cells, etc., as well as the lack of disclosure around P2 results, the
lack of disclosure around the short time allowed between mixing the drug and use (stability issues), the more troubled
I became. BioBobby's constant harping on lack of disclosure around ECOG status was also a helpful reminder that
ZIOP was not on the up and up. Clearly ZIOP's all around lack of disclosure showed a lack of conviction in its own
drug. Then A.F.'s last minute hedge fund friend pointing to the chart showing immediate deaths in the control arm that
caused separation, but then almost no additional separation thereafter, as well as very large number of censored
patients. While I pared my holdings down significantly due to these helpful pointers, I just couldn't bring myself to sell
the remaining 25%. So I'm smarting from some losses now but, even worse, incredibly depressed that yet again
there's nothing decent to improve the chances of people with sarcoma. What a waste of time, money and hope. I
wonder how much blame can be placed on how the P2 trial was run, analyzed and reported. In a million years, given
Dr. Lewis' consistent confidence in comparing to the EORTC trial, I never thought that Pali would so significantly
underperform Ifos+Dox that ZIOP would toss the whole program out. Feeling stupid and depressed, but would have
felt worse if I had maintained my original holdings.

"The purpose of this article today is not to say "I told you so." But "I told you so" with your elaborated lessons which
many are well known and some are incorrect.


Honestly your previous "short" hypothesis is correct but your logical reasons and supporting evidences are out of
space.


The only reason to pull me away from Ziop later on is their P2 control arm data not those from your article.


BioBobby had better understanding in terms of skepticism of their Pali clinical trial.


Please review your own articles of shorting stocks in other fields in your record. I don't think that you earned a lot
money on those stocks.

I'm perplexed by your hypothesis. Online accounts of institutional ownership show, for example, that Third Security
owns fifteen million shares and added three and a half million last quarter. That is more than Fidelity and Vanguard,
the next largest institutions, who are slightly ahead of Blackrock and State Street, with Northern, Wells Fargo and
TIAA-CREF also holding positions. That seems most significant for a tiny company.
