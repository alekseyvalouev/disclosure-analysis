The Surprising Truth Behind Herbalife Put Volume
Nov. 30, 2012 10:35 AM ET36 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Earlier in my career, I was a Director in a large Wall Street investment bank focused
exclusively on pricing and structuring equity and equity-linked derivative securities. A short
work week consisted of 80 hours, while longer ones regularly exceeded 100 hours. During
that time I learned quite a bit about how large quant hedge funds make outsized returns
by making smart derivative bets.


As I look at the recent put volume in Herbalife (HLF), it has become clear to me that one
(or more) large funds are likely making a small fortune by doing a trade that is completely
misunderstood by the wider market. In fact, as smaller, less informed speculators attempt
to copycat a trade that they don't even understand, they are actually helping to line the
pockets of the smart money who actually understands the trade.


The large volume in the puts of controversial Herbalife, following not long after a crushing
commentary by notable short investor David Einhorn, has led many smaller investors to
conclude that a "whale" in the pond (presumably Einhorn) is making a monumental short
bet against Herbalife in anticipation of a cataclysmic drop in the share price. Einhorn had
raised several probing questions about Herbalife on its conference call back in May
causing the stock to plunge by 35% from $70.00 to $45.00, where it remains today.


Unfortunately for the smaller speculators who have recently been piling into what they
think are copycat put trades, all indicators suggest there is almost certainly nothing
"coming." A fairly simple technical analysis of what has been going on with the stock and
the puts shows that, whoever he is, the "whale" is almost certainly SELLING puts against
a short position in the stock serving as a hedge. By doing this, the whale is collecting
millions of dollars in option premiums direct from the pockets of smaller speculators, while
taking on virtually no risk.


Proof of this fact is illustrated in detail in several parts below, but can be summarized as
follows:


With well over $50 million of Herbalife puts traded in just a few weeks, only a large
mega fund would ever be able to commit this amount of capital if it were to be a
"naked" put trade
Yet any fund with that amount of capital would quickly realize that the economics of
buying these expensive puts (at a date far before expiration) are massively inferior to

simply shorting a large amount of common stock. This is illustrated clearly below.
A fund with that much capital would simply short large amounts of the stock, rather
than buying puts, which would actually get them "net short" at far lower (less desirable)
prices.
Even with a $4 billion company such as Herbalife, if such massive volumes of puts
were bought "naked," there would be an easily observable decline in the share price
simply due to delta hedging that market makers must do when selling the puts.
Instead, the share price has only declined by a few percent over the past few weeks,
which has been largely due to copycat short traders who are anticipating "something
coming."
The whale is clearly SELLING these puts (which puts upward pressure on the share
price due to market marker delta hedging) while simultaneously shorting common
stock (putting downward pressure on the share price) as a hedge. The result has been
a relatively stable share price considering the volume of puts being traded.
This is nothing complicated and is simply a large "covered put trade" which is just the
inverse of the much more common (and more widely understood) "covered call trade."
The bet is slightly bearish / neutral in terms of what is expected for the share price of
Herbalife going forward. It is definitely not an extreme bearish bet on Herbalife.


Looking at these points in detail requires several different pieces of analysis:


Part I - Evidence of delta hedging


During the month of November (with the exception of Thursday, November 29), average
daily volume in Herbalife shares has been relatively consistent at roughly 1.5 million
shares per day. During this time, the highest volume on the shares was 2.7 million shares
on October 31, while the lowest was 350,000 shares on November 23. November 29,
represents an obvious special case for the share price and will be addressed separately
below.


Anyone watching the options activity (which seems to be quite a few people lately) will
have noticed that on individual days there was often more than 10,000 put contracts
traded on various November and December strikes. This equates to over 1 million shares
per day of shares underlying the options. Open interest on Herbalife put options as of
Thursday, November 29, stood at nearly 50,000 contracts, equivalent to 5 million shares
of Herbalife.

Total: 49,897 48,500


Different strikes and maturities on the options have different "deltas." Delta represents the
sensitivity of the option price to any move in the underlying share price. It also (therefore)
represents the "hedge ratio," which market makers use when selling these options. For
example, when the delta of the option is 0.70, a market maker would be required to sell
0.70 shares for every share underlying the put options that he is selling in order to
maintain an effective theoretical hedge.


The further out-of-the money the options are (i.e. the lower the strike price), the lower the
delta. At the time of the large trades on the $47.50 December puts a few weeks back, the
delta was around 0.70, while the delta on the $40.00 puts was around 0.20. The lower
strike puts have very low deltas and fewer contracts being traded, so these are less
influential.


If we assume that the overall, average delta for the larger put trades was around 0.40,
then a trade of 10,000 naked put contracts (which covers 1 million underlying shares)
would imply that market makers would need to be shorting 400,000 shares that day, or

about 27% of the average daily volume on any given day. And in fact, on the lighter
volume days for the stock this percentage becomes substantially higher.


Yet as shown below, over the past month, the most that the stock has ever moved on a
single day was a 5% decline, which occurred only once on November 2. In more recent
weeks, the stock had typically only moved by no more than about +/- 2% per day, which is
clearly not indicative of a large naked short bet against the stock.


Instead, what we have likely seen is that the whale has been SELLING large amounts of
put options (which actually puts upward pressure on the share price) while hedging this
trade by selling common stock (putting downward pressure on the stock). The net effect
has been that the stock has actually been quite flat during the month of November, trading
down just 8% since November 2, despite the perceived epic short bet against the
company.

Part II - What happened on November 29?


For the first time in a month, Herbalife stock had a notably negative day on Thursday,
November 29. The stock fell as much as 6% intraday and on much higher volume of 7.7
million shares, briefly hitting a new 52-week low.


As the share price started coming off, my phone starting ringing and my inbox starting
filling up. The rumor in the market was that the much anticipated "event" for Herbalife
stock was upon us and that the messenger was going to be Citron Research rather than
David Einhorn. The rumor of the Citron report even showed up on the newswires;
however, a Citron spokesperson declined to comment.

Short sellers certainly have a very clear memory of the effect that a recent Citron report
had on shares of Questcor (QCOR), and were no doubt hoping for a similar play on
Herbalife. On Tuesday, September 18, QCOR shares closed at $50.52. The next day,
Citron published a "smoking gun" report that certainly did not disappoint followers, sending
the shares to a low of $22.26, a drop of 55%. The shares closed the day at $26.36, and
over the subsequent few weeks they fell as low as $17.83, down 64% from the time of
Citron's report. Since that time, the shares have recovered slightly, to around $27.00.


As it pertains to Herbalife, attentive investors will remember that on Tuesday, September
18, (just one day before the Citron report on QCOR), a very large trade on short dated out
of the money puts occurred on QCOR. When I say "large" and "short dated" I mean that
someone placed a bet of $5 million on out of the money puts, which would expire
worthless just 3 days later if there wasn't a massive drop in the stock. When the stock
experienced its epic drop, these options quickly increased in value by 30-50x. The stock
dropped so quickly after the report that there was simply no time to sell these options fast
enough, but even if we assume that sensible limit orders had been put in, it is very safe to
assume that the profit on these options easily exceeded $100 million in a single day, or a
return of about 20x. And obviously this excludes any profit that a short seller would have
likely made on a substantial short position on common stock. It was a profitable day and
no doubt someone will be having a Merry Christmas this year (or perhaps a Happy
Hanukkah as the case may be).


With QCOR, the "smoking gun" underlying the report was actually very public information
available to anyone with the tenacity to find it. In addition to other findings and analysis by
Citron, the key piece of information was news of a reduction in payment coverage for
QCOR's drug Acthar by insurance provider Aetna (NYSE:AET). As it turns out, this
information had been publicly posted on Aetna's website for five days prior to the Citron
report, so it came as a painful after-the-fact realization for many investors that they too
could have placed an identical mega trade and made a small (or large) fortune had they
only shared Citron's persistence in searching for relevant information. The implications of
the Aetna news on the share price of QCOR should have been patently obvious to anyone
who saw it, as evidenced by the massive share price drop, which occurred after Citron
simply brought it to light.


As the rumors of an impending Citron report swirled around Herbalife on Thursday, the
share price began dropping on volume and obvious naked put buying picked up
substantially. As shown above, nearly 50,000 put contracts traded on Thursday alone,
equivalent to 5 million shares.

However, early in the day Citron released a report on Usana Health Services
(NYSE:USNA) instead of the anticipated Herbalife. The misperception that this would be
an Herbalife report is somewhat understandable, given that, similar to Herbalife, Usana is
a "direct selling" multi-level marketing (MLM) company that markets "nutritional and
personal care products." This latest Citron report continues on a trend from Citron in
exposing MLM companies such as Nu Skin (NYSE:NUS) and its operations in China.
China has very strict laws against most MLM marketing practices, however both Nu Skin
and Usana claim to be in compliance.


In any event, once the market realized that Citron was writing about an entirely different
MLM company, shares of Herbalife quickly rebounded as the shorts realized they had
guessed wrong. The upward pressure was further reinforced by the announcement from
Herbalife that its COO had recently purchased over 45,000 shares of the company, worth
over $2 million. So if "something is coming," clearly Herbalife's COO is not aware of it. And
by the end of the day, Herbalife had actually risen by more than 3% in the after market,
more than recovering from its earlier drop of as much as 6%.


Part III - the economics of buying puts is inferior to shorting common stock unless
the buyer buys them close to expiration and has a clear view on timing of a share
price move


Anyone who eyed the massive QCOR put trade witnessed the miracle of massive
leverage that options provide, as well as the ability to make mind-boggling profits in a
short period of time. However, it should be kept in mind that "time is the enemy of the
options buyer and the friend of the options seller." For these trades to work, the options
must be purchased very shortly before expirations (minimizing the price paid) and must be
held for a very short period of time (minimizing the "theta" time decay).


In short, if you don't have certainty on timing, options are typically a very inferior way to
bet on a stock price.


The fact that these Herbalife put trades have been going on for several weeks now
illustrates the fact that someone is more likely selling them in size rather than buying them
in size.


As speculators eyed what they perceived as a mega trade going on, I came across a
number of comments, which observed that "whoever is buying these puts is losing
$100,000 per day just due to theta (time value) decay alone, so they absolutely must know
that something big is coming."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1038001-the-surprising-truth-behind-herbalife-put-volume 8/20


In fact, if we flip our assumptions about the whale upside down, we can see that the whale
was actually making a profit of $100,000 per day in theta by selling these options, most
likely against a large short position in the common stock as a very sensible hedge as a
hedge.


Looking at the economics of a naked put trade vs. shorting common stock essentially
proves this to be the case and shows that anyone with the capital to undertake such a
large put trade would, with 100% certainty, prefer to short a large amount of common
stock rather than buy puts.


I demonstrate this with two cases, using the approximate data from actual put trades that
have occurred over the past two weeks.


When I began watching this activity, the price of Herbalife stock was at $48.00. The prices
of the $47.50 and $45.00 puts were $5.00 and $2.00 respectively, so those are the
numbers I use in this analysis.


Hypothetical trade #1 consists of buying 6,250 naked $47.50 HLF puts at a price of $5.00,
for a cost of $3.1 million. This is compared with shorting an equivalent 625,000 shares of
common stock at a price of $48.00, which is a $30 million trade.

$60.00 25.0% ($7.5m) - ($3.1m) ($3.1m) $4.4 m


As we can see, if a fund were to pay $5.00 for $47.50 puts, they would then be "net short"
at a price of just $42.50, which is 11% below the entry share price of $48.00 for shorting
common stock. So even if the share price declined by 11%, the fund would make precisely
nothing on the put trade, vs. making 3.4 million on the short common trade. By getting
short stock at $48.00, the fund would make 50 cents per share ($313,000) before the
$47.50 puts even became in-the-money based on just a 50 cent decline in the stock.


If the share price were to decline by 37.5% to $30.00, a huge move, the put trade is still
inferior because the fund would be short at a far lower price due to the option premium
paid. The "inferiority" amounts to a consistent $3.4 million in lost profits for any meaningful
downside move.


The only benefit to the put trade is that potential losses on the upside are limited $3.1
million (the price paid for the puts), whereas potential losses on a short common stock
position are (in theory) unlimited. But in reality, the fund could easily start covering the
short common stock position if the share price started rising more than expected, and thus
losses would be cut early.


And in reality, for smaller (more expected) moves in the stock, the short common stock
position is profitable, compared with the put trade, which will experience substantial losses
for moves less than 10%. If the stock drops 10% (to $43.20) the fund would make $3
million by being short common stock vs. losing $437,500 if long the puts after paying
$5.00 for them.


Going further out of the money, hypothetical trade #2 consists of Buying 6,250 naked
$45.00 HLF puts at a price of $2.00, for a cost of $1.3 million. This is compared with
shorting an equivalent 625,000 shares of common stock at a price of $48.00, which again
is a $30 million trade.

Once again, we can see that the only benefit to such a trade is in capping potential upside
losses, which as we know are preventable anyway. Again, if the stock moves down less
than expected, the put trade incurs substantial losses as opposed to decent gains on
being short common stock.


So the conclusion here is obvious: no one with the money to afford such a trade would
ever place such a trade simply due to the inferior economics and risk / reward proposition
that it presents.


Part IV - So what is the whale really doing?


Now that we know what the whale is NOT buying puts, it is useful to evaluate how
attractive the "covered put" trade is. This shows the superior economics of such a trade
under nearly all circumstances.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1038001-the-surprising-truth-behind-herbalife-put-volume 11/20


Here I assume that the whale is short $30 million in HLF common stock, and that he has
been selling the expensive puts to collect the high premiums that they offer as a result of
the heavy bidding by uninformed speculators.


Once again, we assume that the whale got short at a price of $48.00, which is where the
stock was when the options activity started picking up. The analysis below assumes the
whale has been selling $47.50 puts and collecting $5.00 in premiums.

$60.00 25.0% ($7.5) $3.1 m ($4.4) -14.6%


As we can see here, this is a very slightly bearish trade where whale wins nicely under
most expected circumstances.


If the stock falls dramatically for any reason, the whale makes an 11.5% return on $30
million in one month.
If the stock falls just a little, or even stays flat, the whale also makes 11.5% on $30
million in one month.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1038001-the-surprising-truth-behind-herbalife-put-volume 12/20


Even if the stock rises back to $50.00 the whale still makes 6.3% on $30 million (in just
one month) simply due to the high option premiums he collected from punting
speculators who had hoped for an "event" vs. the relatively small losses incurred on
the short stock position.
Only if the stock rises dramatically does the whale lose anything at all, and he always
has the option to cover his short position early to prevent this.


For purposes of this analysis, I have assumed a trade size of $30 million because it
matches up well with the trade sizes for individual strikes. But as we have seen from the
massive options activity, the trade has likely been going on for several weeks and is likely
to be in the size of $200 million or more. Given the demonstrated low risk profile of this
trade, there is no reason why a large fund would not do this, and the capital requirements
of a "covered put" trade are clearly offsetting, and therefore much smaller than a naked
trade on either side, so it is not overly capital intensive.


The conclusion that we can reach from this is that there is likely a whale out there who just
made more than 10% in a single month on at least $200 million, using a very low risk
trade that takes advantage of smaller naked speculators on a controversial name. The
controversy surrounding Herbalife is what allowed the put premiums to be bid up to such
unreasonable levels, and that's what made this trade work.


The other conclusion we can reach is that (similar to QCOR) whoever engineered this
relatively simple covered put trade will be having a very Merry Christmas.


Part V - What do we learn from this ?


Piling in to a crowded short trade often has a habit of ending up quite badly for those who
choose to blindly speculate in such a way. And when the trade is wrongly perceived as a
"sure thing" the results are typically even worse due to the tendency of investors to
increase their size inappropriately.


A good example of this was the "sure thing" short trade, which many speculators piled into
ahead of the much anticipated lock-up expiry for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). With over 800
million shares becoming available for sale, and by insiders with a very low basis, it
seemed like a precipitous drop in the stock was virtually guaranteed. In advance of the
expiration, Facebook was trading below $20.00, but by yesterday (Thursday) the stock
closed at $27.32, up more than 35%. Losing 35% in the course of just 2 weeks is
unpleasant enough on its own, but the simple fact that because a decline in Facebook
was perceived as "guaranteed," persuaded many investors (big and small) to get far too
big into the trade, making the absolute dollar losses all the more substantial.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1038001-the-surprising-truth-behind-herbalife-put-volume 13/20


The short squeeze in Facebook was very notable for a company of its size, indicating that
short bets against it were enormous. Once investors realize that Herbalife is not being bet
against by the whale, the stock could also experience substantial short covering, driving
the stock back up to $50.00 or above.


Chasing Research in Motion (RIMM) down to its inevitable "zero" has recently shown
similar results for shorts focused on a "sure thing."


Shorts are not alone in their over-enthusiasm for the "guaranteed" trade. Long investors in
Apple Computer (NASDAQ:AAPL) were steadily following a mantra of "Apple $1,000"
despite the obvious valuation problems this would pose for such an enormous company
(even despite its spectacular growth and large cash position), and the decline from over
$700 per share has been unpleasant for many who jumped onto the bandwagon too late.


As it pertains to Herbalife, it should be realized that the simple motto of "buy low, sell high"
applies to options just as much as it does to stock prices. When options are cheap, buying
them can be a good idea, but only if one has some clear view on the timing of a share
price move. However when options are overly expensive, and especially when an investor
has no clear idea on the timing of any major move in the share price, then entering
covered option trades can prove to be quite profitable and can be safely done in fairly
large size. However it should always be kept in mind that keeping an effective hedge, as
the whale did, is critical for preventing catastrophic losses when selling options.


For the time being it seems that the smartest move investors can make with Herbalife is to
simply stop lining the pockets of the whale by no longer bidding up the price of the put
options in the absence of a clear catalyst for a significant downward move in the stock.


As for me, I am short shares of Herbalife from a price of $46.96, but recently sold a
number of puts to take in the large premium against this position.

Great article. Thanks.

I agree with a lot of this article but don't think it tells the whole story. My guess is that a lot of these short
sellers of HLF are working together(collusion and totally illegal). The only thing that can be manipulated more
than the share price of HLF is the price of options for HLF. I believe these large short players (large hedge
funds) initially bought and sold options to each other as to create a large outstanding open interest and to
drive up the cost of buying these options.


By quickly placing these transactions through the system, they bought few options from others outside their
illegal network of short sellers. In essence by coordinating sales and purchase of these options at various
prices with each other, they basically had to use very little of their cash to create the appearance of large #'s
of open put interest. While they were buying options at higher prices from their illegal network short partners,
they were selling other put options at higher prices back to those same illegal network short partners.


I agree that when any other investors outside that network stepped in to buy those same options at the higher
prices, they(the illegal network of shorts) were right there to take their money.


So in combination with making money from people stupid enough to follow their lead in to this buying frenzy
of WAY out of the money puts and with ACTUALY very little money out of pocket from this illegal network of
shorts, they were able to create an atmosphere of fear so they could scare HLF's longs into selling their
shares as they drove HLF's share price down on November 29th.(This seems a lot more logical to me than
one whale spending a huge amount of money to initiate these put options- someone had to buy them initially
at the ask price to drive their price up.)

Well now we know that the 'whale" was Ackman who bought, didn't sell puts and made his announcement just
before December 2012 options expiration with that ridiculous so called presentation with 344 pages of crap.


And we also now know that this was a pump and dump tactic by Ackman. The puts cashed out 2 days later.
Nice timing Ack! And just in time to add it to his failing funds prospectus to show a better rate of return.


Of course we also now know that Ackman is now down around $700 million or so and is faced with investor
redemptions. His fund is once again performing badly and this time Ackman is not able to perform a Houdini
act.

Can someone provide a good book on Options trading? Please don't say something with the title Dummies in it
(though I may be one). Something designed for a deep analysis with empirical rationale and findings..basically
whatever the "bible" of options trading would be.

This stock has been some hedge fund's whipping boy for almost 6 months now. I caught on to it a couple months ago,
when I realized it was range bound and the unusual options activity in the name. The powers at be will not let the
stock drop below $42, so it's always safe to buy it below $45 (below $44 is a gift) and it will usually rally to around
$53, and that's where the hedge fund repeats the cycle of shorting the stock and selling the puts. It's clear market
manipulation and if we had a competent SEC there would be a lot more of these Ivy League crooks in jail.

the whale was NOT selling these puts. look at what they did to the level of implied volatility and skew during the
month of November (excluding yesterday and today). It is impossible that anyone with options knowledge would have
come to the conclusion that these were sell to open trades. There was a massive buyer(s) of puts for several weeks.
they continued to jack up vol, and the price of the stock went from low $50s to mid $40's. Yesterday, that huge block
of trades were closing trades. I feel for the dealer or desk who bot them because implied vols have collapsed over the
last 2 days directly following those prints.


i bet the owner(s) of the puts got wind of the large insider buying taking place and called it a trade. they made millions
of $s. in my opinion it was a crazy trade to put on. but not my money...


There's still a good amount of open interest but much less interesting to watch now.

I love it! The retail guys are always trying to figure out what the "smart money" is doing and the market makers are
always trying to avoid getting burned by the "fast money".


I will admit that I only quickly glanced over the article(i don't have that much interest in the underlying or what's been
happening with it), but I will put in my two cents and risk coming off like an idiot since I did not read the closely.


There are a lot of assumptions being made here and one glaringly wrong statement. Something that caught my eye
right away was " By doing this, the whale is collecting millions of dollars in option premiums direct from the pockets of
smaller speculators, while taking on virtually no risk." NO RISK? No way. You are assuming that they can continue to
borrow shares at little to no cost and assuming that they can manage to keep shares from possibly going higher. Also,
the assumption that market makers are only going to hedge delta via the underlying is a poor one. This discussion
only scratches the surface of how market makers hedge especially when you start talking about large one sided
positions in the market.


Personally, as a retail investor, I do not waste too much time worrying about who is driving volume or open interest
and why. But... if I was that interested, I would look at time and sales to see if the large trades were going off at the
bid or the ask and look at the changes in implied volatility and look for skewes that might indicate where the pressure
is leading. I may also scour some of the option newsletters. You may be surprised where some of these flare ups
come from.

News broke on Nov 29th that the COO bought shares to the tune of a cool $2M. I suspect this explains the large
recovery in the shares that day on such high volume. This SHOULD effectively put a bottom in this stock. The true
test of any on-going theories on who is buying puts/shorting this stock comes now. Will bears continue to press their
luck as insiders are loading up on the cheap? If so, they must know something the COO doesn't know...


I noticed that over the last 2-3 days, the open interest on the Dec 42.5 and 45 puts actually increased. I think this
increase supports the thesis here that puts are getting sold to open. Put buyers should have taken advantage of the
big plunge in the stock on Thursday to lock in profits or to finally minimize losses. Instead, even more positions were
opened. I am also noticing very little skew in the Dec near-the-money puts vs calls, implying that there is not giddy
anticipation of some big downside event. This lack of skew is in big contrast to the surge in the put/call ratio and in
short interest. (You can get these data from Schaeffer's Investment Research). Lastly, amazingly enough, of the nine
analysts on this stock, they are all still at strong buys?!?


This is one fascinating setup, and I suddenly find myself extremely interested in watching and learning from the
unfolding drama.


01 Dec 2012, 07:43 PM


phil.mynutz
lack of skew? skew was crazy bid throughout the month of november. as was vol. skew was more than 2
standard deviations more expensive than it's average over the last 6 months in looking at 3 month options (90
/ 110 moneyness)


01 Dec 2012, 08:36 PM


Duru, Contributor
Interesting. I was just looking at a snapshot of he latest skew (implied volatility between near-the-money calls
and puts).


02 Dec 2012, 01:15 PM


Richard Pearson, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I think some people are missing my point entirely. The change in vol (and skew) should have been
much more pronounced given the volume of puts that changed hands during such a short period of time. Smaller
buyers were pushing up the prices (vol) of the puts, but the constant selling by one or more large funds kept it from
going too high.


That was the entire point of this article, that smaller (uninformed) buyers were lining the pockets of the whale by
buying up the puts...the he was continually selling.


so yet, i agree that there was plenty of buying, but it was by smaller copy cats. The big money trade going on here
was in constant selling.


and yes, this was clearly a closing trade.

phil.mynutz
well then you just re-wrote the entire law of supply and demand. considering you're suggesting that a
motivated seller of something could convince others they were actually motivated buyers and, over a full
month's time, drove the price higher as they were in fact selling...


i know it probably doesn't mean much to you but i'm not buying it. i've traded vol for 5 years now and i have
never seen a move in vol as violent and quick as we seen in hlf (absent a move in realized vol, of course).
implied vols move all the time but are usually accompanied with a similar move in realized (close to close)
volatility; especially when a known event is absent.


the only thing i kept telling myself was that, a real piece of info could not be coming because the buyers left
such a foot print that if they were trading on insider info, they would all go to jail.


02 Dec 2012, 07:33 PM


dn480
Richard, you say that the vol "should have been much more pronounced given the volume of puts that
changed hands during such a short period of time." December vol went from 55 to 80--I'd call that
pronounced.


You also ignore the manner in which these trades occurred. Early in the week, these puts were bought
electronically over the day in lots of ~500 or less, which caused this pronounced spike in vol. On Thursday, it
was a market maker committing capital, as these puts traded ~7k at a time. These few block trades are what
pushed down the vol, and since open interest was unchanged the next day, this confirms these were closing
trades. I think it is much more likely that the puts were bought electronically throughout the week, then sold to
close in blocks on Thursday, as the investor puked out his position.


Your entire assumption is that a "whale" with that much capital would never do a trade that stupid. You'd be
surprised...

this is what believe happened as well. bu they bot a lot more than they sold on thursday and friday.


still they prolly made lots of money as vol and spot moved their way.
