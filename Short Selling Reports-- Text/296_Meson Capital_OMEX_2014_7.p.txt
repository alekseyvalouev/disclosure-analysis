No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America, Short Sale Profits
To Go To Charity

Summary


OMEX track record of 17 claimed ships: 14 did not materialize, 1 taken by
government, 2 below expectations.


Thorough research on SS Central America conclusively indicates NO secret army
gold stash and likely uneconomic project for OMEX.


I, Ryan Morris, pledge to donate personal OMEX short sale profits to charity.


There Is No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America


First, let me announce that going forward, I, Ryan Morris will donate all personal profits I
make from my Odyssey Marine (NASDAQ:OMEX) short position to charity. I am
disappointed that the Company has failed to improve its disclosures in light of our in depth
questions.


Rather than be transparent with investors about past promises such as the HMS Victory
and the need for a web of offshore subsidiaries, OMEX has taken their PR-distortion
techniques into overdrive. Facing, we believe, a summer bankruptcy unless they are able
to raise fresh equity to pay for their expensive first-class plane tickets and lavish lifestyles,
OMEX is playing a page out of fugitive Tommy Thompson's playbook.


The morning of March 3rd, Odyssey announced it had obtained salvage rights to the SS
Central America, an 1857 shipwreck. On March 4th Craig Hallum and their #1-client Scott
Vincent reported speculative and unsubstantiated data that the ship may contain a secret
shipment of army gold worth as much as $500 million.


Unraveling the PR technique


There is a powerful PR technique against those who don't have the time or interest to
check references:


1) Plant a "fact" without attribution at some low level 'news' source that does not have the
resources or interest to fact-check

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 2/26


2) Encourage other, incrementally more credible news sources to reference this original
unsubstantiated "fact"


3) Repeat 2 until this "fact" is repeated by credible enough sources to stand on its own.


For example, OMEX has claimed repeatedly that: "UNESCO estimates over 3 million
shipwrecks in the world." Though it is rarely attributed, we were informed that this
attribution to "UNESCO" was actually to a UNESCO panel discussion where OMEX CEO
Greg Stemm himself spoke and threw out the "3 million" "fact" without any evidence.


Why might one be skeptical? OMEX's Track Record of Overpromise and Under-
deliver


In our first report[1] we detailed each of OMEX's 17 previous projects, the claims and
results. Of the 17, just 3 have had ANY recovery - the Republic, Gairsoppa, and "Black
Swan" which was taken away and legal sanctions imposed. The other 14 were quietly
abandoned after extraordinary claims were made such as "a gold bullion value of
approximately $35mm to a potential numismatic and collectors value of well over $100m"
of the "Concepcion" project[2] or their second best project in 20 years: "the cargo's
possible value at US $120 to $180 million" for the SS Republic (estimated $44mm
revenue over the last 10 years and still not fully sold).


Even more remarkably - this is not even the first time OMEX has claimed great value for
salvaging a ship that was already salvaged by someone else. The "Ancona" ship in 2007
had already been salvaged of all treasure and OMEX wasted shareholder funds hyping
yet another project. We have had numerous archaeologists' remark that they can't imagine
OMEX is actually earnestly attempting to find ships but tends to purchase the locations of
other ships from experienced wreck hunters that are less busy promoting and selling stock
certificates.


The Facts about the SS Central America


We understand investors want to believe in miracles but casinos and lotteries give a better
gambling bang for your buck. As Judge Sheeran overseeing the SS Central America
bankruptcy said, "the Down Treasure is more like a person holding a lottery ticket, with
PowerBall type odds against him."


After extensive analysis of the SS Central America and the seeded claims of a secret
Army gold cache, we conclusively know that no secret cache exists.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 3/26


1. We spoke with credible deep sea archaeology experts directly involved with the SS
Central America case for over two decades and they universally dismissed the notion of a
secret Army cache.


2. Tommy Thompson's best friend and expedition ship mate stated without question: there
was never a secret army treasure on board.


3. Multiple Judges and official court documents conclusively dismiss the possibility of a
secret cache.


4. Direct source materials from 1857 we obtained also clearly prove there is no secret
Army cache.


5. SS Central America estate's own internal expert analysts show the SS Central America
has no Army cache.


6. Eyewitness direct quotes from 1857 of Captain Herndon of SS Central America also
clearly demonstrate there is no Army cache.


7. SS Central America tried to both raise their own money to excavate this treasure with
their own crew directly experienced on the site and were not successful. They also
explored selling the project outright with no success as well.


8. Even if there was anything of value left below, it would have been long ago stolen by
other salvors the SS Central America estate knows have been going after the treasure
while their insolvency has left the site defenseless and without oversight for over 5 years.


9. Even if an army gold cache existed, it would lead to a repeat of the "Black Swan" fiasco
as there is no statute of limitations on government property under maritime law and the
shipment would be forfeit like in the "Black Swan" case.


1. Credible Deep Sea Archaeology Experts Working on SS Central America Confirm
There is No Army Treasure


The nice thing about a 30 year old salvage project is that there is no shortage of experts
who are on record expressing views from both camps.


We spoke with several people who helped represent the insurance companies in the initial
legal battles in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These are people who had direct access to
now redacted court files.
5/21/2018 No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America, Short Sale Profits To Go To Charity - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 4/26


Universally - and without reservation - these people strongly asserted that no army cache
was ever present aboard the SS Central America.


When a ship goes down, insurance claims are made based on the ship's manifest. It is
possible in rare cases for special shipments to be undisclosed on the ship's manifest, but
after a shipwreck, all undisclosed shipments would immediately be declared in order to
receive insurance claims. According to those with the best knowledge of the case, no
insurance claims for undisclosed shipments were ever put forth.


Additionally, the experts we spoke with had direct access to Thompson and his records.
We know with certainty that the SS Central America, with its wooden frame, has rotted
down to the mud level - this makes search and recovery fairly easy. Thompson had
several years to search the site and perform a recovery. Records and eyewitness
testimony from the original voyage indicate that the original ROV made extensive surveys
around the entire boat and debris trail (which stretches approximately half a mile from the
wreck site) left during the survey. In short, the entire site was thoroughly surveyed.


If there were 20 tons of gold on the ocean floor, Thompson and his crew would have found
it and extracted it.


Insurance companies, with the official documentation and a large financial interest in the
gold, recognized there wasn't a vast sum of treasure still on the ocean floor.


2. Thompson's First Mate and Best Friend Knows There Was Never A Secret Army
Shipment


We know from discussions with experts that Barry Schatz was glued to the ROV monitor
screens full-time during the initial salvage efforts, which makes it all the more powerful that
Barry denies the existence of Army gold:


Barry Schatz, one-time partner in the salvage and Thompson's boyhood friend, says flatly
"There never was an Army shipment."[3]


What's even more remarkable about this quote is that Schatz disappeared with Thompson
when the jig was up - and we all know that actions speak even louder than words. If there
were an army cache, Schatz would be first in line to get his piece of the pie.


3. Official Court Documents and Multiple Judge's Statements Confirm: No Army
Treasure

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 5/26


As recently as January of this year, Judge Sheeran stated Bob Evans's Down Treasure
estimates are far too high and "without merit." Specifically:


8,500 feet of water, in which case there would of course be no reasonable expectation of a
bumper crop of anything. Likewise, Mr. Evans' valuation of the Down Treasure at $150
million is also without merit.[4]


And impossibly long odds:


the Down Treasure is more like a person holding a lottery ticker, with PowerBall type odds
against him.[5]


Judge Sargus confirmed these thoughts as well:


"At the time, there were rumors that other commercial shipments of gold were aboard, but
these were quickly discounted."[6]


4. SS Central America Investors Themselves Do Not Believe In This "Down
Treasure" Project


The Williamson plaintiffs thought going after the "down treasure" was clearly a bad idea.
They demanded to get their $1.1m before any treasure hunt could occur as they
apparently did not see the value in spending their own money to go after the treasure (we
spoke to representatives from the plaintiff's side who believe there is no major down
treasure left). Presumably these investors also had access to internal documents and still
demanded that their money not be "invested" in this project they had no interest in
participating in. So the people closest to the case, with the best internal information
available, do not think there is any secret cargo worth going after.


(3) At the meeting, Mr. Szolosi communicated their position that the Williamson Plaintiffs
demanded $1,100,000 towards payment of their claim from the money that would be
raised to finance the recovery of the Down Treasure. I told them that under no
circumstances...[7]


5. Recent SS Central America Internal Documents Show No Army Gold Stash


Ira Kane is the court appointed received in charge of the SS Central America assets
currently. Just a few months ago he personally said the following:


"The experts, he wrote, believe the majority of the remaining treasure "will be comprised
of gold coins and ingots."[8]
5/21/2018 No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America, Short Sale Profits To Go To Charity - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 6/26


Do you think if there was an army stash of 15+ tons of gold on board the US government
would be transporting it in unrefined ingot rocks and tiny coins? Of course not. Any multi-
ton army stash would be in gold bars and the court appointed receiver, one of the most
bullish on this Down Treasure project, is personally demonstrating their internal experts do
not believe there is an army stash.


Strikingly, the reimbursement documents for the court appointed receiver indicate clearly -
after detailed financial modeling with inside information - that for the project to have any
hope of potentially being economic, Odyssey needs to reduce its cost structure. These are
not comments someone would make in the face of a vast shipment of gold.


Note above how it says "Review Down Treasure calculation" - the receiver, using internal
documents and factual information based on historical records, has a good idea of how
much treasure is still below water, which makes the following all the more interesting:


Note "Discussed the need to drive down the cost of recovery and how the various
Odyssey strategies would impact the return to current / future investors." The significance
of this language is unmistakable. If the down treasure (which the receivership has a good
estimate of) consisted of hundreds of millions of dollars of gold, the receivership would not
be discussing the "need to drive down the cost of recovery" - this would be an absurd
discussion and the entire focus would be recovering the treasure. The need to drive down
costs only occurs if there is such a small amount of gold that it's not clear if the project will
even be economic.


What's shocking to us is that these documents are all publicly available - and free - just a
few keystrokes away. Odyssey shareholders can and should conduct their own due
diligence on their investment of hard earned savings. Have investors been deliberately
mislead again? Why has Odyssey "cherry picked" documents supporting absurd claims of
5/21/2018 No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America, Short Sale Profits To Go To Charity - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 7/26


unrealistic treasure? Could it be to lure more investors in who have not yet reviewed
Odyssey's track record of literally 100% rate of disappointment to claimed expectations[9],
something we discussed in our original report? Is this similar to what happened in Greg
Stemm's Seahawk debacle where he allegedly "cherry picked" information and left any
contrary information undisclosed while shareholders lost everything?[10]


6. Multiple Historic Documents from 1857 Confirm No Army Gold


Primary source documents from 1857 also prove there was no Army gold on the SS
Central America when she sank. Several newspaper articles from 1857 all show similar
amounts of gold on the SS Central America at the time it sank. The clipping below is from
the New York Herald, published 9-19-1857


A second article published by The Ohio State Journal on 9-23-1857 indicates there was
$2,000,000 total of gold on the SS Central America. From these two articles we know
there was a maximum of $1.9-2.0mm of gold aboard, and that approximately $1.6mm of
this gold was insured. If you run the math it works out to just less than 3 tons of total
treasure on board the SS Central America.


Multiple official court documents state that Tommy Thompson's excavation recovered 2.5-
3 tons of treasure. So there is clearly little to no treasure left aboard based on factual court
documents based on Thompson's internal records along with official historic records
(which squares out with the other official court documents we referenced above that
express concerns about Odyssey's cost structure).


7. Claims of Outrageous "Passenger Gold" Are Also Without Merit
5/21/2018 No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America, Short Sale Profits To Go To Charity - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 8/26


The analysis above shows that clearly either most or all of the potentially recoverable
treasure aboard has been recovered already. We also know that the surviving passengers
carried a considerable amount of gold off the ship with them. Based on our detailed
analysis of the life boats and the 150+ people who were able to evacuate SS Central
America safely, we estimate that a minimum of 26% of any passenger carried gold left the
ship with those people. The first round of women and children were limited to carrying two
$20 (~1oz) gold coins each (although there are eye witness accounts of some women
carrying more). After the women and children were evacuated there were many life boat
trips of men who, while unlikely to be carrying multiple gold bricks each, had no quoted
limit on treasure they could carry. It is reasonable to assume that each men who got off
that boat had their pockets full - even if not their own gold, passengers destined to go
down with the ship were attempting to get their own gold off the ship for the benefit of their
surviving families. We believe that given estimates of 600 people aboard and the ~160
people who safely escaped it is conservative to assume that 26-35% of passenger gold
went with the survivors.


Furthermore, "most of the men were miners"[11] and it was typical in that era for miners to
carry gold in gold dust form in pouches as it was what they mined. The combination of the
ship sinking, the 8,500 foot fall to the floor, the 150 years of currents and then the previous
excavation have made it certain that little or none of the gold dust will be recovered.


Lastly, the claim that passengers on this boat "carried gold equal to the insured amount" is
preposterous. With ~600 passengers and $1.5m in insured gold on the boat that works out
to an average of $2,500 per person. This is without credibility because most of the
passengers on the SS Central America were not rich to begin with. While the general level
of bankruptcy and failure among gold rush miners is well known, this quote from Ship of
Gold discussing their plight is particularly relevant: "Just to stay alive they had to find ½ to
1 oz ($8-16) of gold each day to pay for living but most miners averaged no more than a
few cents to a few dollars after 10 hours a day of work. " To claim that, on average, there
was $2,500 in gold per person on this boat is clearly ridiculous. Furthermore, it is a fact
that a large amount of the gold that was ever on the ship in passenger control left with the
survivors so to claim that much could still be down on the ocean floor is absurd.


At best, the SS Central America has a very small amount of random passenger coinage or
gold dust (a common method for carrying gold back then) that was not initially worth
recovering. More importantly though, let's get back to the cost issue: The Columbus
5/21/2018 No Secret Army Gold On The SS Central America, Short Sale Profits To Go To Charity - Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (NASDAQ:OM…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 9/26


Dispatch, an Ohio newspaper who is owned by an original investor in Thompson's voyage
and is a current and long-time plaintiff, has quoted Greg Stemm estimating the cost of the
recovery at $10-20m recovery cost[12]:


"Greg Stemm, Odyssey's chief executive officer, called the Central America one of the
greatest shipwreck stories of all time. In October, he said that recovering the remaining
treasure and artifacts from the Central America would cost between $10 million and $20
million."


If true, in other words, the official court documents:


1. Contain Odyssey's own estimate of the cost of recovery


2. Contain detailed and credible estimates of the total amount of possible remaining gold


3. Express concerns about lowering Odyssey's cost structure to make this project
economically viable


The only possible conclusion is that there isn't much gold left and everyone knows it
except OMEX shareholders.


Furthermore, the SS Central America group originally estimated they had to raise $40m+
to properly attempt this project. Greg Stemm has estimated it will cost $10-20m. The
"Master Service Agreement" between OMEX and SS Central America is a public
document[13].


8. Even if there was any gold left on site, there is a strong chance it has already
been recovered by another rogue salvage group


We believe the factual, independent and cited evidence we have presented above clearly
demonstrates this project will be mediocre at best, if not an outright failure. However, what
we find most offensive to OMEX shareholders is that even if SS Central America had any
value there, it would have long ago been carried off by famously unscrupulous competing
salvage companies (i.e. pirates). The SS Central America is hardly a secret and its exact
location has been known for many years. Indeed, even in 1987 when Thompson was
initially searching for the wreck, there were already competing salvage companies onsite.
With Thompson's group insolvent and powerless to defend the site for more than 5 years
now, there is little to zero chance it has not been disturbed and explored.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 10/26


Administrators have been trying to keep people off the site but completely unable since
the "company has been inactive for over 5 years and are actively aware of people going to
the site.


[14]


9. Even If There Was a Secret Army Gold Cache OR Passenger Treasure (there is
not) AND a Competing Salvage Group Has Not Excavated It AND Odyssey Found
It…. It STILL Would Not Belong To Odyssey or SS Central America![15]


Lastly, if the Army had 20 tons of gold sitting on the bottom of the ocean and the
government knew about it, why wouldn't the Navy just go get it? The Navy has far more
sophistication and salvage ability than Odyssey - and isn't teetering on the edge of
insolvency. It's an absurd premise to think the government just forgot about 15-20 tons of
gold 130 years ago and has chosen to do nothing for the last 25+ years. And yet, there
has been nary a peep out of the Navy at any point during the entire SS Central America
debacle.


Based On Many Independent Sources With Fact-based Evidence: SS Central
America Project is Not Viable and There Is Little to No Treasure Left


We are biased to prefer facts and math to wild speculation. Above we have outlined facts
from a variety of sources, all of which point to continued future disappointment for
Odyssey shareholders who have high hopes for the SS Central America. For OMEX, with
over a decade of cited failure and literally 100% disappointment[16], we do not find this
surprising and any OMEX shareholders left have nobody to blame but themselves when
they are left holding the bag.


Odyssey Desperately Needs to Raise Equity Capital


We will save a more in-depth financial analysis for after OMEX posts it's 10-K in a week
but based on their recent press release[17] filed March 11 it appears that their cash is
burning away rapidly. In spite of their "deepest and heaviest precious metal cargo
recovery" with the Gairsoppa, the company still lost $28.9 million across 2013 and 2012.
This loss was funded by $27.5 million raised through "back-door" capital raises via
Oceanica that avoid SEC registration requirements although the funds appear to be
comingled with the corporate funds and used to pay executive's compensation for

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 11/26


example. Why is OMEX holding "restricted cash" while simultaneously paying interest to
Fifth Third if not to appear to bolster their cash holdings? How much of this cash is in
offshore accounts now and inaccessible to the corporate parent? We estimated it was
$6mm as of Sept 30, 2013 based on the "minority interest" balance sheet item.


Oceanica's initial assay results further appear to be far worse than even we had imagined
with <20% P2O5 concentrations. The gross tonnage is less important in mining, the
quality of the ore is key to the economics. We understand <20% P2O5 concentrations
would be considered "waste clay" and the standard grade is 32-33% P2O5 for much less
expensive on-shore mining.


Odyssey publicly stated November 5 that they do not need to raise equity and yet are
presenting at the Roth conference today, "Contrary to some recent claims by Meson, we
do not have plans for, nor do we believe that Odyssey will need to conduct any equity
offerings in 2014," but the simple math shows they will either dilute their shareholders or
they will go bankrupt by this summer, when they run out of cash. We will update as we
learn more.


We believe Greg Stemm learned his treasure hunting model of PR and charlatanism from
Tommy Thompson - a treasure hunter who bilked his investors and ran off with the
treasure to South America. In fact, as we continued to read about Thompson's story we
were fascinated by the parallels - a savvy marketing expert discovers treasure, raises
capital on empty promises, gets sued to oblivion (and repeatedly loses in court), and
investors lose everything. There are a few major differences between the two, notably that
Tommy was actually successful in excavating a major treasure salvage at a gross profit.
We'll also give Tommy credit for being original - he didn't need to pick up scraps left at the
dinner table.

It sounds like the author isn't a fan.


Treasure hunting isn't just pulling up to a wreck in a boat and picking up the gold. They have to find the wreck. They
have to investigate it, see if it has any treasure. Those are both expensive enterprises. Then they have to recover it.
It's not particularly easy to pick up a bar of gold 3 miles underneath you. Robots and technology both cost money.

After all that, they still have to battle foreign governments and insurance companies who have abandoned the
treasure at the bottom of the ocean, sometimes for centuries, and suddenly want it back.


Hitting it "rich" on one wreck every few years is a pretty good record. If it's too speculative for you, nobody said OMEX
was an investment grade treasury bond or a Fortune 100 company.


OMEX isn't just about treasure hunting, they are involved in undersea mineral exploration. My opinion (and it's only
opinion) is that they realize the lure of treasure might attract some speculators (as it did me) but to create an
investment grade security, they need a better operational model, not dependent on the whims of insurance companies
and foreign governments. In ten years, OMEX will be an undersea mining company and the sexiness of treasure
hunting will be back in the hands of the Mel Fishers of the 21st century.

Not to beat a dead horse but below is a link to your phosphate primer and the beneficiation process, where "floating"

No rational investor would bet the family farm on Omex, any more than a recreational gambler would on slot
machines in Vegas. But many of us dream of finding treasure and enjoy the gamble. Omex in moderation is a
vicarious way of treasure hunting. I have been trading the company's shares for many years and have made money
and had a lot of fun following its fortunes. Considering it has survived the predations of the Spanish government and
the pusillanimous judgments of the US courts, which cost the company well in excess of half a billion dollars, Omex
has done incredibly well. Even if as some allege Mr Morris is not a self-serving stock manipulator, he sure is a rotten
spoil-sport.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2083453-no-secret-army-gold-on-the-ss-central-america-short-sale-profits-to-go-to-charity 14/26


In this article the author quotes Judge Sheehan's statement


"the Down Treasure is more like a person holding a lottery ticker, with PowerBall type odds against him"


the author is quoting far out of context. Judge Sheehan was referring to the hopes of any further salvage attempt
while the status quo at that time comprised a near bankrupt company.


This is what the says further down in the same judgment...


"But the appointment of a Receiver, even given the limited options available to this Court, is the best course for the
companies at present. It presents the opportunity for genuine hope and growth, the opportunity for the rebirth of a
once very successful enterprise, and the opportunity to see so many shake their heads in awe, as more treasure, both
historical and monetary, makes its way from the depths of the seas to the eyes of an incredulous world."

Generally Government's are self-insured, although the policy of the US Government vacillated over time. The
$8000.00 of Government monies shipped aboard SS Finance to Guantanamo, which sank in the approaches to New
York Harbor as a result of a collision in December, 1908 (and shortly thereafter salvaged - the wreck was in protected,
shallow water) was privately insured. The $800,000 in Government funds aboard RMS Republic, bound for the Great
White Fleet at Gibraltar, lost in a collision just one month later, was Government self-insured. So, the policy of the US
Government to insure/self-insure at the loss of SS Central America, is the issue. If the US Government at the time
had a policy of insuring its money shipments, there's no reason to conceal the loss. If self-insured, then politics come
into play. That seems a relatively easy question to answer through research - the US Government's policy at the time.
If the Government insured its cargoes at the time, then there's no Government cargo on SS Central America. If the
Government self-insured its money shipments at the time, then, maybe, one exists. ... Incidentally, since Government
assets are vast, it is good fiscal policy to self-insure.

If you want to know about Government insurance of money shipments in the early 20th century, I've made my
research on this issue regarding RMS REpublic available for you here.


http://bit.ly/O8MgS4


This focuses on Navy policy. Army policy would similarly vary. I seem to recall at the time that the Army did routinely
insure it's money shipments, but this of course is several decades after CA.


Again, a simple research inquiry: would the Government have insured this cargo? If so, then the loss would have
been publicly acknowledged. If they self-insured, then, if exigent circumstances dictated, they would not have
acknowledged the loss.


If the policy was to insure, then OMEX can save significant money by discontinuing a search for an ignis fatuus; the
research on this single point would cost a lot less than offshore operations.

If there was any Army gold, and I believe there was not, it probably would have been transported aboard a Navy ship.
Shipped on Central America it would be secured 24/7 by an armed guard detail of probably six soldiers. None were
reported aboard.


Notice the slight drop in the stock price when the Morris' article appeared? His credibility is gone. Look for the short
sellers to try something, or someone else. They are trapped, big time.


A nice recovery from Central America should run OMEX stock to $4. When the salvage of HMS Victory begins, we
have the prospect of recovering US$ billions, and a $30 stock price.

I do discuss secret shipments of gold in my book, The Tsar's Treasure - including, of course, the two (2) secret
shipments aboard my shipwreck, RMS Republic. I did run across references to the rumored Government gold aboard
CA - given that it too was a target of mine before it was found, but I did not research it in any great detail; the
newspaper reports of the commercially insured cargoes were more than enough to search for CA. (Read Thompson's
and Evan's shipwreck selection process and why they ultimately settled on CA in Kinder's book, Ship of Gold, where
they talk about RMS Republic also as a possibility - but discounted it then in preference to CA). It's interesting to note,
however, that ALL the great salvages were the recoveries of "secret" and sometimes rumored Government gold -
Laurentic, Edinburgh, Niagara, and soon to be RMS Republic - and each one of them were the recovery of self-

Mr. Morris is indeed correct when he states that a sovereign government maintains its ownership interest in its
sovereign cargoes - and as OMEX shareholders are fully familiar in their loss of the Mercedes cargo. There are,
however, certain exemptions to the sovereign immunity issue - commercial transactions are exempt, and issues of res
judicata and collateral estoppel may be applicable. I haven't been following the case here for the legal status of a
potential Government claim in CA, but I do know the US Government did originally file a claim in OMEX's SS Republic
admiralty action thinking they had a payroll aboard (which was subsequently withdrawn when I believe they realized
they had the wrong Republic) . With regard to RMS Republic, the US Government filed a claim in our action which,
after years, we have had dismissed with prejudice - and we have also had all future claims barred.

Hey Guys,


I have not been following OMEX much recently. I jumped out of my 2.00 position too soon. It seems the consensus
both with Meson and others on the comment section here DO NOT believe there is US Government (Army) gold or
silver to be recovered from the Central America, which I did not know anything about anyway. Is OMEX simply being
paid a fee to do the remaining salvage/exploration work?.....or is their compensation going to be dependent on how
much (if anything) they recover from the site? Anybody have the real scoop?


17 Mar 2014, 12:54 PM


Papaoomowmow
Hiya Ship! Hope you enjoyed your getaway (brutal icy winter here).


My two cents worth.


This particular Meson Opus is, to me anyway, on the bizarre side because Odyssey didn't mention "secret army gold".
From what I have read there may be some there, but not wise to count on it. Also his depiction of the assay results
are simply and wildly incorrect. Results were very good. In this one Morris seems to me to go out of his way to attack
Craig Hallum and Green River...who has a blog post on the subject worth reading. Meson also quotes the judge in an
incredibly out of context manner. Etcetera


Odyssey shoulders the entire risk on getting paid. They catch a day rate and additional fee as first dibs on what they
bring up. I am guessing here, but much of what may come up will be coins....and thus is it reasonable to expect a
delay in monetization? Thus probably another loan using what's on board as collateral. 
They then get I think it was 45% of proceeds beyond that (as always plz double check my "facts")


One GREAT thing about this recovery is possession has already been very thoroughly adjudicated. And while it is
deep it is roughly only half as deep as the G.

As to what may be on board this guy should be able to make the best guess.


http://bit.ly/1g4IZcM


Caught a little of the Odyssey conference call. Hope to get a chance to hear it all down the line sometime. They have
scheduled 5 months for the SS recovery. Estimating around a million a month as expenses (as always figure a little
higher....but nothing like the expense of leasing SBW).


They also said they were advised by JPM to complete the clear environmental impact hurdles before selling their
Oceanica stake. Oceanica does owe them 10 million, so Gordon spoke of Oceanica itself seeking to raise capital and
pay that bill inter business. They have it listed as a receivable.


FWIW my general impression (and I am still long). The one area where the shorts may well be right for awhile is the
cash curve. As you know they have been expanding shares outstanding for a long time now and there may be more.
They started the year with 30+ million in cash but 10+ million is restricted to pay off a loan etc...so they had 20 million.
(which I think all longs understood) Not sure how far that will take them this year or how soon any iron in the fire will
directly supply cash so a larger float may be on the way.


I continue to believe even more now that Oceanica will monetized for quite a bit...but right now I am thinking that's at
least a year away. (may well be wrong)


if Odyssey ever gets well ahead of the cash flow curve, I believe it will be a very dynamic stock from these low levels.
That day appears to be a ways off to me, and they continue to weather a withering short attack.....so as
always....anything can happen in the interim.


Good luck in your decisions, Ship.

Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thoughtful post Papa, I am curious as to your expectations re Oceanica monetization
though. Oceanica was valued at $100mm (sold about 27% stake for 27.5mm in 2013) in total so OMEX's
~50% stake = $50mm vs $200mm market cap at $2.50.


Also they were able to raise only $2.5mm vs the $17.5mm they said they would re: Oceanica so it would
appear that the market value might be less?


Given that, what makes you so optimistic about Oceanica's monetization?

Mr. Morris, I had (and posted) serious doubts about the Mako exercise several months ahead of time.


I had and have no idea how liquid they are, or the degree they wish to diversify. Or, as a wild card, whether
they might choose to buy OMEX stock instead. I agree their 2.5 million exercise was a token.


Dilution of Odyssey's Oceanica stake would seem to be on its way. More cash will likely come from that
intermediate step.

I'd be happy of course to hit the jackpot, but I am actually only counting on 80 million or so from oceanica.
That alone would prime the pump nicely.


There is, in my opinion, more than ample profitable work out there and they have proven their ability to tackle
it but have lacked the liquidity to properly progress.

FWIW my long thesis from these prices.


Oceanica. Agribusiness is a critical component of the Mexican economy. About to become more so with a
slew of Public - Private international joint ventures. Many new trade agreements ranging from South America
to the Asia. 12 % of Mexican land is arable. Much of that is underutilized. Much of that which is utilized -
particularly in the poor tropical southern regions - uses no fertilizer at all right now. Mexico's land sources of
rock phosphate are drying up. They are already a net importer and about to become more so. Shipping costs
VERY high. Therein lies the big economic advantage of propinquity. The assay results speak to a whopper of
a source. Once environmental approval is achieved, it will draw the active interest of large players. It is worth
at least 125 million less dilution and JP Morgan and other costs and fees. At least.


What would that cash mean to OMEX. In my opinion they do have viable commodity contracts and numerous
other opportunities which will expand with each successful salvage. But they need money to pursue them. For
instance they have said they are searching for a multiyear lease on a ship large enough to handle the
commodity recoveries and thus sidestep the very large expense of SBW short term lease. They need to get
ahead of the cost curve to move beyond their molasses pace.


Their business history so far. Some shining moments and some bad breaks but not a good long term
investment thus far for any but adept traders. No argument.

Any short seller can cite a tidal wave of companies that went under (most from the weight of piling on long
term debt).


Any long can cite a tidal wave of companies that had woeful multi year investment returns then turned
around. CAMP is the first example that comes immediately to mind for me.


Until that cash arrives, of course this stock is in intermediate term play and both shorts and longs will likely
have mini victories and defeats along the way....so on any given day both "beta" watch out...and look
elsewhere if the turbulence gets to be too much.


Just my opinion, I think the odds favor the longs in OMEX from these prices. heavily.

Meson Cap,


If I may: you DO realize that Mako was formed solely for the purpose of investing in Oceanica, and thus, ALL
of Mako's shareholders are long at $1 (per Oceanica share) and many invested, i.e. averaged UP (UP!) at
$1.25 a few months after their initial investment. Although I do agree that it would have been a nice bump to
the stock (and Odyssey's coffers) if the rest of Mako's investors paid up AGAIN, but this time at 2.5 times their
initial investment, it really didn't make THAT much sense to do so, especially since the EIA report submission
did not make the 2013 deadline. Nevertheless, these guys (Mako) are LONG at $1. It is rare that anyone
doubles their stake, especially in an illiquid investment, up 250% from their original investment. I thought that
a complete Mako option exercise was a long shot-purely from an investment point of view- but that does not
imply that "the market value might be less." That is just pure amateur and simplistic thinking on your case.
SO, if Mako HAD exercised all their options, you would be out banging the table that a handful of investors
shouldn't make a "market," yet since Mako did not fully exercise the options you are stating that they DO
constitute THE market. 
The NI 43-101 report is out there and will be updated soon. You made the deliberate mistake of comparing
the raw core rock results against beneficiated rock (which are much higher). In a previous post I posted a link
to help you out, and Odyssey explained the difference as well on their CC. 
You should ask someone knowledgeable at Mosaic what they think of these results. I think you will, too, see
that the "market" in the form of OMEX stock is undervaluing the asset.

Cutting through the haze of short desper ation/distortion which we see published (so it must be true?), the cash burn
rate and balance sheet cash of OMEX, if properly understood, will allow the longs to sleep well in 2014. Cash burn
rate of ~$25mm annually includes some 50% in vessel lease and opex, which can be reduced by contracting out if a
long period of non-utilization is anticipated. Luckily the project backlog is better than ever, even excluding potential in
places like the Bahamas that seems to be heating up.As for the balance sheet cash, note that year-end restricted
cash is not a new item, and needs to be understood in the long-standing credit structure. The company has a multi-
year credit history with Fifth Third Bank (hardly a fly by night hard lender) whose loans have consistently been fully
secured by assets (buildings and inventories including recovered but pre-sold work-in-process Gairsoppa silver)
...with a building restircted cash account requirement leading to the annual roll-over of the loans (post filing of 10Ks).
Conservative one-year maturities, reasonable interest rates, and once the loans are reviewed annually, either offset
against the restricted cash or more likely and consistent with history, rolling the loan for another year..."corporate
finance 101." So when considering OMEX (or any company's) liquidity position for 2014, from the 12/31/13 balance
sheet (rear view) perspective, you need to add dry powder borrowing capacity for 2014, especially from a long-
standing relationship bank. If a short expects OMEX to repay 100% of their outstanding loans with a new equity
offering...well I've got a bridge to sell them. 
Don't confuse the ugly convertible deal that OMEX did in 2011 in striking up a relationship with Craig-Hallum to
engender their market maker role, with a return to the equity/convert trough (note those funds pre-funded the
Gairsoppa recovery expenses prior to the 5/3rd work-in-process loan which has now been retired by the sale of
bullion). However, if monetization from projects is delayed into 2015, well then creative bridge financing will be
required. From history, the company has used project based syndicated financings for shipwrecks or equity from
mining projects, that while expensive, doesn't involve issuance of OMEX shares to raise working capital for very real
projects, such as those that currently exist in the pipeline...Central America has moved to the front of the line for the
best (not only) source of liquidity in 2014.The future happens, and so a Long,  I'll sit back and wait to enjoy the
clearing of the haze and inevitable squeeze to come.

I had a chance to do some checking to see what amount of value might still be salvageable from the Central America.
It appears that the court appointed receiver, OMEX, and others familiar with the original recovery, seem to agree that
what might be left for salvage completion on the site could be in the range of $25M to $88M dollars still down there at
todays' value. I still don't know where the issue of Army Gold came from, but most agree there isn't any US
Government owned gold/cargo down there, and that does not play into these current possible salvageable value
figures. Interestingly, the Tommy Thompson fugitive angle seems to be a story still playing itself out......might find that
one in a TV documentary one day if they ever catch up with him......It's got all the makings of a great story. I'm still a
little sqeamish about getting back in on OMEX because another 2M shares were shorted between end of March and
mid April. PPS price action recently seems to suggest that even more shorting is going on. Waiting and watching for
now.

Ship, You might want to re-check your math. The Receiver stated "After conducting an exhaustive review of the
extensive amount of historical research available on the shipwreck, our experts estimate the shipwreck still holds a
commercial shipment of gold that was valued at approximately $93,000 in 1857, as well as a substantial amount of
passenger gold valued in 1857 between $250,000 and $1,280,000." At $20/oz this translates to between 17,150 and
68,650 oz of gold. If that gold were to take the form of coin (as most of it will) and we assume a low-end value of that
coin at $5k/oz, then the total value would fall between $85mn and $343mn. The Receiver's expert pegged the most
likely scenario at $760,000 in 1857 value which translates to $190mn at $5k/oz. Of course this is all speculation - we
won't know until we know.


As far as the Army protected gold, everyone I've spoken with who is close to the story (many who worked with
Thompson) believes there's a good chance it's there. These are people who have seen the letter from the CMH in
1971 and understand the detail of its contents. But I agree that it's best to assume that it's not there and let this be a
$1bn bonus should it be found.

in 3 years of documented voyages down to the site. Not to mention who knows what undocumented trips he
did as a fugitive who knew where the ship was after he got the ~$50mm from selling the gold they did recover
20 years ago?

Thompson struggled to recover most of the commercial gold in his salvage attempts (he could see some but
not get to it). He didn't have the high-powered equipment that's available today, and this slowed his efforts
quite a bit (as did the fact that he painstakingly and manually recorded many details of the salvage). As the
Receiver noted, he was only able to explore 5% of the site in any detail. There was so much gold in one spot,
and it was on the surface, that he spent all of his time there.

The people with whom I've spoken do not believe that Thompson or anyone else went back to salvage the SS
CA. Some have said it would have been impossible for someone to pull this off undetected. None of us know
what the real story is, but we'll begin to find out in a few weeks.

I would not count on "Army Gold". If shipped from San Fran, when it got to Panama, 15 tons would take 100
horses / burros at 300# each to carry it from the Pacific to the Atlantic side. Would the Army send this without
a large guard force? How could it be kept secret? Who would guard it aboard ship? We probably should limit
our expectations to salvaging the commercial shipment and what passengers were carrying.

OMEX RECOVERS ALMOST 1000 OUNCES OF GOLD FROM SS CENTRAL AMERICA DURING TWO HOUR
RECONNAISSANCE DIVE. OTHER GOLD INGOTS VISIBLE ON SURFACE. SITE NOT DISTURBED SINCE 1991.


Gold Recovered During First Reconnaissance Dive Indicates SS Central America Has Not Been Disturbed Since
1991 
9:42a ET May 5, 2014 (GlobeNewswire)  
Odyssey Marine Exploration, Inc. (Nasdaq:OMEX), a pioneer in the field of deep-ocean exploration, recovered nearly
1,000 ounces of gold during the first reconnaissance dive to the SS Central America shipwreck site on April 15,2014.


Recovered gold included five gold ingots and two $20 Double Eagle coins (one 1857 minted in San Francisco and
one 1850 minted in Philadelphia). The gold ingots were stamped with assayer's marks and weights that range from
96.5 to 313.5 troy ounces.


The two-hour reconnaissance dive was conducted during the transit of Odyssey's research vessel, the Odyssey
Explorer, from the United Kingdom to Charleston, South Carolina, to mobilize for the project, which is being conducted
under contract with the receiver of Recovery Limited Partnership (RLP). RLP director of operations Craig Mullen and
RLP chief scientist/historian Bob Evans accompanied the Odyssey team for the dive operation. Mr. Evans previously
served as chief scientist, historian and later as curator for the initial Central America recovery operations conducted
between 1988 and 1991.


During the dive, Odyssey's ROV ZEUS flew over the shipwreck to assess the current condition of the site. Gold ingots
and other artifacts were clearly visible on the surface of the site during the dive and no excavation was required for
their removal. Given the reconnaissance purpose of the dive, only five gold ingots, two gold coins, a bottle, a piece of
pottery, a sample of the shipwreck's wooden structure, and an element of a scientific experiment that was left at the
site more than 20 years ago were recovered. The positions of the recovered artifacts were documented for
archaeological purposes and will be noted in the detailed site plan that is being created. The archaeological
excavation of the site will be undertaken once the pre-disturbance survey provides detailed documentation of the site.


"This dive confirms for me that the site has not been disturbed since 1991, when I was last there," said Bob Evans
chief scientist/historian for RLP.


RLP director of operations Craig Mullen added, "The skill exhibited and results achieved during the initial
reconnaissance dive reinforces our belief that the Odyssey team was the absolute best choice for this project. In
addition to the cargo recovery operation, we plan to collect deep-ocean biological samples for Dr. Timothy Shank, a
deep-ocean biologist and head of the Molecular Ecology and Evolution Laboratory at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution. Our objective is to document and provide Dr. Shank with samples of species that have returned to the site

since previous operations ended. Odyssey's documentation capabilities will contribute significantly to scientific
understanding of deep-ocean biological processes. This continues a history of supporting scientific research at the
site."


Odyssey was selected for the project by Ira Owen Kane, the court-appointed receiver who represents Recovery
Limited Partnership (RLP) and Columbus Exploration LLC (CE). The contract has been approved by the Common
Pleas Court of Franklin County, Ohio, which has given Mr. Kane responsibility with overseeing the recovery project.


The archaeological excavation, valuable cargo recovery and ship-board conservation will be conducted and
underwritten by Odyssey on behalf of RLP. In return, Odyssey will receive 80% of recovery proceeds until a fixed
mobilization fee and a negotiated day rate are paid. Thereafter, Odyssey will receive 45% of the recovery proceeds.


About the SS Central America


The SS Central America was an 85-meter (280-foot) wooden-hulled, copper-sheathed, three-masted side-wheel
steamship launched in 1853 as the SS George Law. Operating during the California Gold Rush era, the ship was in
continuous service on the Atlantic leg of the Panama Route between New York and San Francisco, making 43 round
trips between New York and Panama. The Central America was caught in a hurricane and sank 160 miles off the
coast of South Carolina on September 12, 1857. When she was lost, the SS Central America was carrying a large
consignment of gold for commercial parties, mainly in the form of ingots and freshly minted U.S. $20 Double Eagle
coins. Because of the large quantity of gold lost with the ship, public confidence in the economy was shaken, which
contributed to the Panic of 1857.


The Columbus-America Discovery Group, acting as agent for RLP, confirmed the location of the Central America
shipwreck site in September 1988 at a depth of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet). Recovery operations were conducted over
a four-year period (1988-1991) and a large quantity of commercial gold was recovered from approximately 5% of the
shipwreck site during more than 1,000 hours of bottom time.


Odyssey Marine Exploration has been awarded the exclusive contract to conduct an archaeological excavation and
recover the remaining valuable cargo from the SS Central America shipwreck.

If there is so little of value left on the ship why did CADG start a lawsuit to get control of it? Why would they
waste money on legal fees to recover nothing?

The downward spiral in the stock seems to be primarily related to being removed from one or more of the Russell

The Meson Capital assault has decimated the stock price, but I think it would have stabilized near the 52-week low if
not for this other factor.


Interested in other's thought on this.

Not sure why being listed in the Russell 2000 is important. Are there investment groups which will invest in R2000
stocks, but not R3000 stocks?  
Like Uziel, who just bought 4.6 mil shares, there are other large speculators who see the potential for a short
squeeze. There is no longer a lot of "loose" stock available to borrow. The large specs tell their brokers not to lend
their stock to short sellers. We (I speak for myself) little guys cannot do that, as far as I know. 
A company with a market cap of $116 mil which has earnings of $50 mil this year - something about that does not
compute.
