Chemours is a Bankruptcy Waiting to Happen!   
Chemours was Purposely Designed for Bankruptcy! 





This Stock is a Zero 
 
After 15 years of publishing, Citron can confidently state that Chemours 
(NYSE:CC) is the most morally and financially bankrupt company that we 
have ever witnessed.  
 


Last week 5.2 million Americans learned that their drinking water is 
contaminated with man-made chemicals linked to cancer. 
 


Today, a jury trial started in Columbus, Ohio which adjudicates the first of 
the 260 cancer related lawsuits against DuPont in just the Mid-Ohio Valley. 


http://www.reuters.com/article/us-du-pont-cancer-idUSKCN0V6312 
  
At this very moment, as you read this story, the National Guard is in Vienna 
West Virginia facilitating distribution of 
drinking water to the public, following 
the "Do Not Drink" advisory issued in the 
wake of the recent revision of EPA 
contamination guidelines for C8 -- also 
known as PFOA.  
 


While this might be a new story to some, it is has been daily life for the 
people of the Mid-Ohio Valley for 30 years. Most recently, the same 
problems have been witnessed throughout the United States, and reaching 
as far as DuPont-implicated facilities in The Netherlands and Japan. 
 


Chemours, a spin-off from DuPont, is the latest chapter in a well 
documented 60+ year pattern of wanton and deliberate abuse of humanity, 
the environment, and now the capital markets.

While chemical giant DuPont has spent 60 years dumping waste around its 
facilities, they have spent the past 11 months dumping this “toxic spinoff” 
on Wall Street.  
 


It isn't Citron's purpose to detail the "moral outrage", serve as a community 
activist, or deliver another piece of journalism profiling the victims of this 
60 years contamination and cover up that has become the shining example 
of corporate greed.  
 


That job has been done by award-worthy pieces from : New York Times 
Magazine, Huffington Post, a 3-Part piece by The Intercept, Bloomberg and 
Salon. 
 


Reading the above stories tells readers all they need to know about the role 
of DuPont/Chemours in damaging their own workers and surrounding 
communities, while diabolically using the legal system to avoid liability. If 
not obvious, none of these stories were written by “market participants” or 
“short-sellers”. 
 


Spinning off environmental liabilities is nothing new to Wall Street. DuPont 
has merely taken a play out of the Monsanto and Kerr-McGee playbooks 
with their Solutia and Tronox spinoffs. The gambit:  create a bad entity that 
is designed to fail, so the good entity can be spared the reputational and 
liability damage. 
 


We are witnessing the same game with Chemours. And for those of you 
who have read the first page and said “Wait!  There are some real 
businesses in Chemours …” – that is correct. And just like Solutia and 
Tronox, the businesses will get bought out of bankruptcy once the parent 
company goes bankrupt.

The Dirty Financials 
 


In July of 2015, DuPont spun off its “performance chemical” division and all 
of the associated liabilities to its shareholders as Chemours stock, which 
then indemnified DuPont for the majority of its environmental liabilities. In 
order to guarantee its failure, DuPont threw it into deep water, the weight 
of $4 billion debt on its legs. 
 
Chemours’ debt is only 20% less than that of DuPont, a company with 35x 
the market cap, and 6x more favorable debt to EBITDA ratio.  
 





To put this in perspective, compare this to the two above-referenced 
environmental liability spinoffs that went bankrupt: 
 








Clearly, Chemours is a company that could NEVER have completed an IPO. 
Imagine this income statement in a prospectus with the tacked-on warning 
of potential billions of dollars in contingent liabilities and legal fees … and 
yes, on top of $4 billion in debt:
The Great Scamours June 2, 2016 Page 4 of 17 
 





With net income swinging red, EBITDA has gone in the tank. 
 





DuPont’s Game Plan Backfires 
In order to engage yield chasers for the spinoff stock (more accurately, a 
dump-off), Chemours declared an unsustainable dividend. But like Teflon,
The Great Scamours June 2, 2016 Page 5 of 17 
 


the dividend could not stick in the face of the two disastrous quarters that 
yielded massive losses for Chemours. 
 


Within months, having paid the dividend only once, it was slashed 95% 
from 55c to 3c.  The stock price soon plunged 85% from its opening levels. 
 


Within 3 months of going public, Chemours also had to “rewrite the terms” 
of their adjusted EBITDA, to avoid violating their creditors’ debt covenants.  
 


On September 25, 2015, Chemours filed this: 
 


“The definition of Consolidated EBITDA, which is used solely for the purposes of 
calculating financial maintenance covenants in the Credit Agreement, has been 
modified to include cost savings benefits from restructuring and other 
initiatives announced prior to July 1, 2016 on a pro forma basis”.  
 





NOTE: Given the SEC's increasing focus on made-up non-GAAP financial 
measures used by companies to hide or distort results of operations, 
(http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sec-stepping-up-its-tackling-of-
misleading-disclosure-2016-05-31) we wonder whether Chemours will 
eventually have to answer to the SEC. 
 


Finally, in what is nothing short of giving “corporate CPR”, daddy DuPont  
made a $190 million prepayment for goods while “step daddy “ Dow 
Chemical, bought their aniline business for $140 million. 
 


https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/198868/dow-chemical-to-buy-chemours-beaumont-aniline-facility 
 


While Chemours was set up for bankruptcy, DuPont just could not let it 
happen in its first year, and just prior to its merger with Dow Chemical. If 
that were to happen, a court might have too easy a time transferring the 
environmental liabilities right back to DuPont before the spinoff.

Yet, even after all of this financial maneuvering to keep the company afloat 
… we have not even discussed the herd of elephants in the room:  
 


The Environmental Liability 





It is obvious to Citron, and many other journalistic outlets, that the whole 
purpose of Chemours existence was so DuPont could rid itself of the black 
hole of environmental liabilities that will drag down the company for years 
if not decades to come.  
 


No one has an exact dollar figure yet on the extent of the liabilities of this 
debacle. While Chemours only accounts for $20 million of overhang on its 
balance sheet, most Wall Street analysts estimate the liability to fall more 
inline with the $500 million figure.  
 


But we always hear the value $5 billion being thrown around by social 
activists like the “Keep Your Promises DuPont” campaign, which has pegged 
environmental costs just for Parkersburg WV at $1 billion.  After speaking in 
depth with community activists, Citron believes that even $5 billion may be 
a low number for 
 


 Medical Monitoring 


 Cleanup 


 Compensatory damages to victims 


 Punitive damages to victims 


 Legal Fees 



http://keepyourpromisesdupont.com/
The Great Scamours June 2, 2016 Page 7 of 17 
 


 
These damages will be not limited to West Virginia but rather they will span 
across 171 sites in the U.S, plus worldwide locations.  What we are 
witnessing in the Mid-Ohio Valley is just the tip of the iceberg.  
 


 
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/dupont-spins-off-chemicals-and-cleanup-liabilities- 





Nobody wants to discuss this because it is so alarmingly UGLY. It is even 
uglier than Solutia’s and Tronox’s losses.  
 





Prior to spinoff, DuPont said in regulatory filings that it has already spent 
$295 million on legal and remediation costs at some of the plants 
transferred to Chemours -- and this is prior to any lawsuits or legal fees.

Shareholder Fraud Regarding Liabilities 
 


DuPont appears to have intentionally remained silent for years regarding 
the environmental and health dangers associated with PFOA: 
 


“It [DuPont] has also estimated in regulatory documents the liability 
could exceed $1 billion.” 


-- Delaware Online  May 13, 2016 


"Cleanup of the 171 sites, DuPont says, will cost from $295 million to 
$945 million. “In general, the experience is cleanups cost more than 
anyone ever thinks,” says Ronald Gilson, a professor of law and business 
at Stanford and Columbia law schools. One site alone, in Pompton Lakes, 
N.J., where for 97 years DuPont made explosives that polluted the soil 
with mercury and lead, could cost $116 million, Chemours says.

"Internally, the company discussed the potential liability and reputational 
impact associated [with PFOA] at least as early as 1984," states the report, 
entitled The Shareholder's Right to Know More. "However, it did not 
commence SEC disclosure until it was actually sued over alleged public 
exposures to PFOA." 
 


For example, this report reprints a 1981 DuPont document revealing that 
two of seven women who were pregnant while working in areas exposed to 
C8, had babies with facial birth defects resembling those found in animal 
studies of C8, or C8 was detected in the baby's or umbilical cord blood.  
 


Chemours is the direct consequence of a November 2000 email from John 
Bowman to Thomas Sager and Martha Rees, all DuPont attorneys.  
 





This one, penned by another DuPont in-house attorney in 2000, about the 
farmer (now deceased) whose land DuPont bought, turning into its private 
toxic dumpsite, is about as cold as it gets: 
 





How any analyst can tell this story, ignoring the largest environmental 
abuse and corporate cover – one that makes the Erin Brockovich story look 
like a fairy tale, not to mention the blatant incriminating document trail of 
the company’s own attorneys, estimate the contingent liabilities at only 
$500 million?  BTW, Erin Brockovich is currently campaigning against these 
same toxins that Chemours is responsible for. 
 


http://www.unionleader.com/With-new-EPA-guideline-Brockovich-says-PFOA-is-widespread  


"The shit is about to hit the fan in W.V. The lawyer for the farmer 
finally realizes the surfactant issue. He is threatening to go to the press 
to embarrass us to pressure us to settle for big bucks. Fuck him.” 


-- email from DuPont corporate attorney Bernard Reilly , August 2000 


"We are going to spend millions to defend these lawsuits and have the 
additional threat of punitive damages hanging over our head“…  
"Our story is not a good one. We continued to increase our emissions 
into the river in spite of our internal commitments to the community 
and the environment because of our concern about the biopersistence”   
[of this chemical]. 


-- email from DuPont corporate attorney John R. Bowman to his son, 2000

Creation of the Death Star 
 


DuPont has agreed to merge with Dow Chemical. Anticipated completion is 
this summer.  The subsequent plan is for the new entity to be spun off into 
three separate companies within 18 months. 
 


This merger plan threatens to create a Death Star -- the ultimate super-
weapon that cannot be penetrated.  This means unlike its predecessor 
bankruptcies in which the attorneys could go after a sole surviving party, 
Chemours inevitable bankruptcy won’t have a single responsible party to 
sue for fraudulent conveyance of Chemours.   
 





Plaintiffs already realize that Chemours could not possibly pay the potential 
claims. They are demanding documents to answer the question of which 
surviving entity will pay the C8 claims once Chemours files bankruptcy.   
 


Unfortunately for Chemours victims, “Death Star” is not a term Citron 
penned in this matter, but rather it was the judge’s own words:   
 


 
/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pre-trial-order-MDL-DocNo4381-Death-Star.pdf 








http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/05/13/c8-victims-dupont-fight-over-merger-documents/84286264/ 
 


“Plaintiffs lawyers filed another motion seeking information about who 
would pay the more than $1 billion in potential damages after DuPont 
merges with The Dow Chemical Co. and splits into three companies.”  


“… this is going to be a continuing problem because on the plaintiff’s 
side, they think this could be a death star, and it may turn out to be 
nothing, but – and you can respond to that, couldn’t you?  With some 
corporate representative saying what you just said, that it can’t be 
determined? “

As recently as last month, DuPont still will not identify a responsible party 
post Chemours’ bankruptcy. 
 





Plaintiff’s attorneys obviously find this troubling, noting:  


 
http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/04/28/c8-plaintiffs-demand-dupont-merger-documents/83658150/ 





U.S. District Judge Edmund A. Sargus has ordered DuPont to provide the 
information concerning the spinoff of Chemours; which entity will retain 
the obligations and liabilities under the 2005 class action lawsuit; and the 
financial information including documents “reflecting the entity’s estimated 
net worth, assets, liabilities, revenue, etc.” 


http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/624876/DuPont-must-list-finances--liabilities.html?nav=5061 
 


     http://keepyourpromisesdupont.com/news-and-sentinel-dupont-must-list-finances-liabilities/ 
 


"It failed to supply any meaningful information regarding where the 
liabilities relating to the C8 litigation will end up after the proposed 
DuPont/Dow merger. Most importantly, the declaration failed to 
provide any information regarding whether DuPont will even exist after 
the merger transaction. There is great concern that there might be no 
defendant after both the merger and split and that companies the size 
of DuPont and Dow certainly must have discussed by now where these 
liabilities will go…"  


-- Michael London, attorney of Douglas & London, April 18, 2016 


"Currently, there has been no determination as to how the obligations 
of DuPont to the other parties under the Leach settlement agreement 
[referring to Leach vs DuPont, from 2001] would be allocated as part of 
any post-merger separations … “ 


-- Julie Mazza, acting associate general counsel for DuPont, April 18, 2016 


“DuPont’s shameful attempt to walk away from their 
responsibilities started with the failing Chemours spinoff, and 
now, adding insult to injury, they are trying to do it again with 
the Dow-DuPont merger…”  
The people of the Mid-Ohio Valley have suffered long enough, 
and we deserve clean water, we deserve compensation for 
those who are ill, and we deserve accountability, not Wall 
Street shenanigans.”

So the court knows Chemours is insolvent, the media knows Chemours is 
insolvent … When is Wall Street going to figure it out? 
 


Some are halfway there: 
 





http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/dupont-spins-off-chemicals-and-cleanup-liabilities- 





This is just REMARKABLE -- We will go as far as to 
say complete SECURITIES FRAUD. 
 


Chemours does not mention any of these liabilities in any of their investor 
presentations, even as the as the purpose of the creation and spin-off of 
the Company from DuPont was to absorb these liabilities.  Below are their 
two investor presentations that never mention once the word 
“environmental liability”.

That’s OK, there’s no mention of Chemours’ $4 Billion 
debt either.  
 
Failing to disclose liabilities is nothing new to DuPont. 
Here is a 2005 demand for the same disclosure to 
shareholders:

   Citron Debunks Any Shred of a Bull Case 
 


We have spent exhaustive time trying to find a bull case on Chemours … 
and we come up empty handed. The best the other side on this stock can 
say is:  


“Chemours is not going to go Bankrupt so fast…” 
 


It should be noted that NONE of the arguments presented address any 
realistic way Chemours can overcome the existing debt plus potential 


"Chemours’s business lines are the real dirty part of DuPont … and just 
happens to be where a lot of the liabilities are."

liabilities that face the company. The ONLY way Chemours can absolve 
themselves of these liabilities is through bankruptcy. 
 


1. Bull Case #1 -The Recovery in Pricing in Titanium 
Dioxide. 





Titanium Dioxide is the most commonly used pigment in the world and is 
pretty much the ubiquitous color white used from everything from cars to 
food. This timeline/chart tells you pretty much all you need to know about 
the prospects for Titanium dioxide:  
 





Titanium is the 9
th


 most abundant element on earth and TiO2 is created in a 
factory. Since the 2012 commodities price spike, capacity in China has 
dramatically increased. China now produces 30% of the world’s supply 
which currently exceeds global demand by 20%.    Much of China’s TiO2 
was once considered low grade. But the large exporters like Lomon, 
Pangang and Billions, having invested in product development, now 
produce widely respected general-purpose grades of TiO2.  
 


http://www.pcimag.com/articles/100036-a-review-of-global-supply-and-demand-for-titanium-dioxide 



http://www.pcimag.com/articles/100036-a-review-of-global-supply-and-demand-for-titanium-dioxide
The Great Scamours June 2, 2016 Page 13 of 17 
 


Fears of stagnating TiO2 pricing could never have been more starkly 
expressed than the 2013 settlement in which DuPont paid $72 million for 
its attempt to fix pricing for the next 10 years with other TiO2 suppliers. 


http://www.paintsquare.com/news/?fuseaction=view&id=10078 
 


Excellent industry data and commodity pricing analysis is assembled here:  
 


http://www.tizecloud.com/coatings/563/ 
 


Summary of TiO2 Business Prospects 
Hoping for 2012 industrial commodity pricing is like starting an internet 
company hoping for 1999 valuations. At best TiO2 achieves price 
stabilization and though cost cutting measures and the transfer of 
manufacturing from the US to Mexico. Chemours’ TiO2 business, just like 
Tronox, can be bought out of an eventual bankruptcy and return to typical 
industrial materials ROI. 
 


By no means can the existing business ever bear the weight of the massive 
debt and environmental liabilities that burden Chemours. 
 


2. Bull Case #2 -- Restructuring  
Below is the Chemours’ 5 step “transformation” plan. While these steps 
look like progress, they are merely corporate reshuffling.  
 


 
http://fortune.com/2016/05/18/how-dupont-spinoff-chemours-came-back-from-the-brink/

The Great Scamours June 2, 2016 Page 14 of 17 
 


So this isn’t some brilliant strategic stroke of “transformation”. Careful 
observers of Chemours have noted, “Cost reductions are normal for 
companies, even successful ones. It’s just the playbook for industrial 
suppliers. “ 
 





http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2016/02/23/chemours-lost-86m-fourth-quarter/80819278/ 





Citron’s conclusion is that these 5 initiatives are simply grooming Chemours 
for bankruptcy, and pre-package it up for resale. This is exactly what Solutia 
and Tronox did.   
 


3. Bull Case #3 -- Flouroprodcucts 
Another potential “not so bearish” case on Chemours is that acceptance of 
their new Opteon technology which offers an environmentally more benign 
form of refrigeration material.  
 


Opteon sounds great, until you realize that it’s simply a replacement for R-
134a which is also Chemours product, so it’s simply a cannibalization of 
existing business lines, and existing EBITDA. You can see it for yourself in 
this Honeywell guide document: 


 
https://www.honeywell-refrigerants.com/americas/?document=guide-to-alternative-refrigerants-2&download=1 





Suva is Chemours R-134a brand name. This product line also simply 
replaces existing business lines.  


https://www.chemours.com/Refrigerants/en_US/products/Suva/Suva134a.html 


"The negative trend is really the important thing here, and it is a very 
bad trend they are on. … a last-ditch effort to save something. 
 


If you are trying to put your thumb in the dike before it breaks, the dike 
usually breaks.  
 


If there was more value here, why would DuPont spin it off?"

  Do You Know DuPont and Chemours Better 
Than Nelson Peltz? 
 


Nelson Peltz has spent the past 3 years fighting a proxy battle with DuPont. 
This legendary activist investor was unsuccessful in his attempt to gain 
board seats on the chemical giant, yet remains one of DuPont largest 
shareholders. Of all of the Chemours shares spun off to Peltz, how many 
does he currently own??   0, Just Zero. 
 


Peltz’s firm Trian has sold every share of Chemours that it received 
in the spinoff. And in the timeframe in which he sold, he was getting prices 
of at most $8, and probably with an average far lower.   


http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/02/16/nelson-peltzs-trian-sells-stake-in-chemours/ 
 


It must be noted that Peltz was critical of the burdensome equity /debt 
ratio imposed on Chemours.  His opinion was that it should have been just 
half of its current levels.  


www.stockspinoffs.com/2015/06/11/dupont-stops-sticking-to-teflon-sets-july-1-for-debt-laden-litigation-challenged-chemours-spin/ 
 


  Conclusion 
Before the company even went public a social activist network, with no 
positions in the stock market, knew Chemours was doomed at spinoff.  The 
presentation linked below was created a month before trading of 
Chemours began.

The situation has only gotten worse as here is a Glassdoor review from 
just a few weeks ago: 
 





"May 11, 2016 – “Stagnant Spin-Off” : Doesn’t Recommend, Negative Outlook. 
Current employee (Sales Rep) in Wilmington DE: 


"Still struggling after the spin off...Frequent cuts (bonus, raises, 401k contributions) 
and layoffs have had a significant negative impact on employees. Many quality 
people have resigned due to uncertainty of the company's direction and low morale. 
Executives only seem to focus on key product lines (TiO2, Opteon, cyanides, etc.), 
even when those products are performing poorly. All other business units are being 
considered or already in the process of being sold to bolster positive quarterly results 
in spite of the massive debt load.”

Citron thinks the most likely scenario is that Chemours goes bankrupt 
within 18 months … just long enough for the new Dow/DuPont to split into 
three companies, and create separate entities that will all fight for 
indemnification from this financial toxic dumpsite of liabilities. 
 


If there is any justice in this world, Chemours will go bankrupt before the 
eventual liabilities they have created fall into the Death Star. 
 


You don’t have to be financially sophisticated to see that Chemours, with 
$4 billion in debt, and a mere $20 million reserved for C8 liabilities is 
hanging on by a thread.  
 


Cautious Investing To All.
