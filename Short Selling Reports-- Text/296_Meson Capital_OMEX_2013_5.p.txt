Odyssey Marine's Smoking Gun: SS Gairsoppa Contract Facts From A
U.K. Government FOI

The Smoking Gun? Gairsoppa Contract Facts via UK FOI


Since our original report on Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX) was published
at http://www.omextruth.com on Oct 31, we have been contacted by multiple salvage
industry experts. Every one of these industry veterans have uniformly been adamant that
they see a very different picture of OMEX than what Odyssey presents to shareholders.
We now have public documents that confirm some of the alarming information brought to
our attention by industry expert whistleblowers.


Through a Freedom of Information Request with the UK Government, we have obtained
the actual salvage contract that OMEX has for the SS Gairsoppa recovery with the UK
Department for Transport. This contract appears to contradict Odyssey's repeated public
statements that they are reimbursed for all search and salvage expenses.


The central issue is which expenses are allowable in the determination of "net salvage
value", an industry term representing the value of the salvage net of excluded processing
and selling expenses. Specifically, there is a large difference (roughly analogous to the
difference between gross profits and net profits of a business) between net salvage value
being determined net of total expenses, or net of only certain expenses.


According to contract provided by the UK Government, the list of reimbursable expenses
is very specific and limited to "expenses of realisation*, storage, handling, freight, assay
costs and insurance up to the point of sale." This is NOT the same as the much broader
"search, recovery, and processing expenses" that Odyssey represents to investors. Based
on our discussion with salvage industry experts, we believe the actual allowable expenses
(reimbursed before the 80/20 split of the net salved value) is a small fraction of what
OMEX has claimed it is entitled to; search and recovery expenses are the most significant
and are borne directly by the salvage firm. Based on feedback from industry experts, we
estimate the value of these limited excluded expenses at approximately $3-5mm,
dramatically lower than Odyssey's claimed $27mm of reimbursable expenses.


If true, this would imply materially lower profit margins for the Gairsoppa project
than OMEX has claimed. Given the total silver salvaged from the Gairsoppa is
estimated at $75mm, which nears OMEX's cumulative revenue since the year 2000

of $108mm, we believe this is a highly material issue.


From the Official Contract (emphasis ours):


CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT FOR SALVAGE OF CARGO (NO CURE NO PAY):


5. CALCULATION OF NET SALVED VALUE AND MANNER OF REALISATION


5.1 The parties hereto shall agree as to the time, place and manner of realisation of
all salved Cargo so as to maximise the proceeds of such realisation. The agreed
reasonable and verifiable expenses of the custody of and dealing with the disposal
of the salved Cargo, including the expenses of realisation, storage, handling,
freight, assay costs and insurance up to the point of sale, shall be deductible
from the proceeds of sale in calculating the Net Salved Value on which the
Contractor's remuneration shall be based. Should the parties not be able to agree on
time, place and manner of realisation then the matter is to be referred to Arbitrators,
appointed in accordance with Condition 27, for a decision.


6. RISK


6.1 All operations by the Contractor connected with this Contract shall be conducted
entirely at the Contractor's own risk and on "No Cure No Pay" terms and all risks,
charges and expenses up to and including expenses connected to the sale of
recovered Cargo shall be borne entirely by the Contractor in accordance with
the terms of this Contract.


This language in the contract appears to directly contradict OMEX's repeated public
statements as well as SEC filings:


OMEX's most recent 10-Q filed Nov 12, 2013 (emphasis ours):


Operating and recovery expenses incurred in connection with the Gairsoppa
contract consist of vessel-related expenses (ships' crew, provisions, port fees
and charter expenses), fuel, specialized equipment and administrative
expenses. These expenses are charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income
as incurred and subsequently reimbursed per our contract and recorded as a
benefit (credit to expense) in the period we are assured of recoupment.


We invite readers to read the entire contract language in the links below - we cannot find
language of this type appearing anywhere in any of the actual contracts.

And OMEX's most recent 10-K filed March 12, 2013 (emphasis ours):


"Any monetary proceeds from the salvage will first be applied to reimbursement
of Odyssey's search, recovery and processing expenses. Any remaining
monetary proceeds will next be divided with Odyssey retaining 80% of the net salved
value, and 20% retained by the UKG"

Where is OMEX's Auditor?


Auditors are the watchdogs of financial reporting, especially for public companies. First-
class auditors, who are independent of management, are critical to assuring a robust audit
process, one designed to detect corner cutting as well as outright fraud. Any deficiencies
in the independence and skill of the audit team create an opportunity for a wide range of
evils, as demonstrated by the spectacular incompetence of Friehling & Horowitz, the
auditors for Bernard Madoff's finances. When we ponder the relationship between Ferlita,
Walsh, Gonzalez & Rodriguez, P.A. (the "Ferlita Firm") and OMEX's senior management,
we see disturbing parallels:


1. This auditor is unusually small and appears unsophisticated for a company of
Odyssey's size and complexity of corporate structure, especially in light of Odyssey's
multiple offshore entities. The Ferlita Firm's only other public company clients are
small, one (NASDAQ:VIFL) has a capitalization of approximately $15mm and revenue
of less than $4mm/year and the other (OTCQB:PCYN) trades for approximately $0.12
per share with a nominal market capitalization.

2. The Ferlita Firm has only a few partners, so there is a high likelihood that the same
individuals perform the audit each year, fostering personal ties to management.


3. The Ferlita Firm has been Odyssey's auditor since inception, from what we can
ascertain. These long-term ties between the same individuals are generally prohibited
under Sarbanes-Oxley, although the Ferlita Firm apparently qualifies for exemption
from partner rotation requirements based on its small size. We ask, is this prudent?


4. The same firm was also auditor to Seahawk Deep Ocean Technology, Inc.
(OTCPK:SHWK: $0.0012), run by Odyssey's senior managers, Stemm and Morris.
The ties thus go back twenty years.


The most recent 2012 PCAOB report on the Ferlita Firm found multiple deficiencies,
including a deficiency related to perhaps the largest single issue affecting OMEX's value -
the fair value measurement of financial instruments. Here is a link to the PCAOB report.


The PCAOB reported that it appeared to the inspection team that the Ferlita Firm, at the
time it issued its audit report, had not obtained sufficient competent support for its opinion
on material items in the issuer's financial statements. Those deficiencies were:


"(1) the failure to perform sufficient audit procedures related to a deferred income tax
asset valuation allowance; and


(2) the failure to perform sufficient audit procedures related to fair value measurements of
financial instruments." (emphasis added)


The PCAOB report in 2009 found similar problems. This makes the recent deficiencies all
the more disturbing. Why hasn't the Ferlita Firm cleaned up its act? Portions of both
PCAOB reports are not available to the public. We urge the Audit Committee to obtain the
complete reports to assess further the quality of the Firm's work, and to provide this
information to the public.


No prudent director should reasonably rely on the Ferlita firm in light of these red flags.
We believe that because of these deficiencies and the apparent discrepancy between
OMEX's SEC filed financial statements and the contract we have obtained via FOI, the
Audit Committee must immediately obtain a new auditor for OMEX.


Shareholders Deserve Answers


Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act, we now know Odyssey is being investigated by
the UK Government related to the HMS Victory.

Comments (34)


Likewise, the company has failed to address our publicly expressed concerns about the
four German WWII government (that no longer exists) blockade runner ships we believe
are the ships Odyssey is claiming it will pursue as commodity salvage projects. We
believe an attempt to salvage these ships in nearly 6,000m of water will encounter legal
challenges as to the true ownership, which we outlined in our previous report published
November 15, 2013.


These issues underscore the continued need for complete and accurate auditing of the
fair value of the undersea mining financial instruments. We know that Odyssey has failed
to release information about the value of this supposed "world-class" Oceanica asset and
has only made vague promises of grandeur.


Shareholders deserve more than more vague promises. We believe shareholders should
not rely on statements made about the supposed "fair value" of the Neptune or Oceanica
assets until Odyssey submits all of its records to a competent, nationally recognized
auditor for review.


* "expense of realisation" appears to be a UK accounting term meaning the cost of
converting an asset to cash (e.g. auction fees)

As a long-term investor in OMEX, I too am concerned about the relationship between the company and its public
auditors. For the sake of the company's public reputation, it is imperative that OMEX obtain the services of a
reputable and independent public accountancy to audit it financial statements.

You need to read the documents that you request under FOIA more carefully before issuing a report like this.


Page 21 of the tender. Disposition of Cargo - The ten percent (10%) would be based on the adjusted value of the
cargo after all expenses  
associated with the search and salvage have been incorporated.


That's right - after all expenses associated with the search and salvage have been incorporated. In this tender, OMEX
is offering the UK government 10%, so it seems that the government pushed OMEX to 20% in return for allowing
them the full cost recovery.


The UK government would have also run some kind of check or audit on OMEX's expenses to make sure they were
legitimate under the terms of the tender.


As to your point about Ferlita, are you kidding? I have yet to find an auditor who didn't have a number of deficiencies
in its review. To which "first-class" auditor would you suggest OMEX switch? Perhaps Ernst and Young?
http://bit.ly/18A7zme 
Maybe Grant Thornton? http://bit.ly/18A7xLb 
Yes, these "first-class" auditors have deficiencies a mile long.


You're right that shareholders deserve answers. We deserve to know why you continue to publish selective,
misleading research.


10 Dec 2013, 01:10 PM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  You are quoting from OMEX's initial offer page 21, NOT the contract that was awarded. Was
OMEX awarded a contract that had the number 10% anywhere in it? NO.


As OMEX has even stated itself, it was awarded a STANDARD contract after a competitive process (which it
bumped up from 10% offer to UK up to 20%, which I have heard is the highest cut to the UK ever granted for
one of these).


Re: Auditor - yes many auditors have deficiencies, this is a side note and not even listed in the 4 main points I
brought up about this SPECIFIC auditor related to OMEX that should concern shareholders.

"...which I have heard is the highest cut to the UK ever granted for one of these." 
Really? One of "these?" Is that salvage lingo? When has there ever been a silver recovery of this magnitude
from such depths?


10 Dec 2013, 01:57 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
That's right, but the terms around salvage expense reimbursement weren't changed in the final contract (or at
least we have no reason to believe they were.)

Look at the terms of the contract at 5.1 "The agreed reasonable and verifiable expenses of the custody of and
dealing with the disposal of the salved Cargo, including the expenses of realisation..., shall be deductible from
the proceeds of sale in calculating the Net Salved Value on which the Contractor's remuneration shall be
based."


These are two separate items - custody AND disposal. The document then lists all of the disposal items to be
reimbursed. I'm guessing that OMEX asked that the custody portion be left out for competitive reasons. That
would include all of the expenses reimbursed per the company's 10Q.


You continue to grasp at straws and you're hurting no one but yourself.


10 Dec 2013, 01:58 PM


Meson Capital Partners, Contributor
Author’s reply »  You cannot have expenses of "custody and disposal" of salved Cargo before it has been
salvaged (and thus exists). That's like expensing tuition for your unborn child.


10 Dec 2013, 02:07 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
No, but you can agree to the reasonable and verifiable expenses which can be used in calculating net salved
value. Some of these being classified under custody, orthers under disposal.


10 Dec 2013, 02:17 PM


Green River Asset, Contributor
And why would you include such a vicious condemnation of OMEX's auditor even as a "side note" (which
appears in the main body of your report and warrants its own bolded section) when you readily admit the lack
of materiality in your attack, and when the small auditor of the firm for which you had (until recently) served as
Chairman had numerous deficiencies per Antelope's comment below? Where is your common decency?
Have you no shame?

Based on my read, the documents are not clear on the point - the tender says search expenses are deducted
prior to the 80/20 split, but the Conditions of Contract doc doesn't say this. My guess is that the company will
try to deduct search expenses - whether the govt will accept this in unclear, however (and if they don't they
would go to arbitration, per the Conditions of Contract).

Jaded Consumer, Contributor
I think the concern here is that "expenses of custody ... and ... disposal" are suspected to be much narrower
than the research, exploration, on-site salvage, and other costs that necessarily precede custody or disposal.


To the extent investors believe exploration and recovery costs are reimbursed, rather than being a fully-borne
expense, the article does important work in illuminating the concern.

In your November 15th report, you state: "We believe the cargos on these ships were owned by the WWII German
Nazi 
government. We understand that there is legal complexity with this as the current German government may not
recognize Nazi property and hence it may be impossible to get a salvage contract on these cargos."


Really? What legal authority do you have for the proposition that the current German government would not claim
ownership of these cargos as the successor government of Germany? Do you have any facts showing that the
German government has ever refused to claim ownership of such properties? As you note in your own report,
Odyssey claims “We recently made application for salvage contracts with the government partner for two additional
valuable World War II shipwrecks”. The implication is that Odyssey has either actual contracts or applied for contracts
with a government for two prior shipwrecks.


I seriously doubt any legal conclusions or suggested conclusions offered by Meson in light of its deception in (a)
highlighting litigation between the SEC and Stemm and Morris while failing to mention that they were acquitted at trial
and (b) highlighting an alleged UK investigation into the HMS Victory while failing to mention that Odyssey would be
presumed innocent of all allegations, until proven otherwise, throughout the course of that investigation.


10 Dec 2013, 03:28 PM

Some initial legal research shows the following from the Federal Republic of Germany's Basic Law, which is,
in effect, its constitution, enacted in 1949: " Article 134 [Succession to Reich assets] (1) Reich assets shall
basically become federal assets." Basic Law Article 134(1) (1949).


There seems to be no rational reason why the current government of Germany would not claim title to the
Nazi government assets on sunken blockade runners. After all, the government would receive revenue from
the salvaged cargo under the salvage contract. Why would it refuse that? To let it sit on the bottom of the
ocean another 68 years?

Agreed however, Odyssey has been on reality TV and well compensated for those appearances yet their story is
always about the enormous expenses tied to their business. Contrary, aside from some showmanship, they make
plucking Gold from the depths of the ocean look like child's play on reality TV.


Then, are we to believe that every piece of Gold and Silver they have recovered has gone directly to it's rightful
owners and not one piece has accidentally slipped into Odyssey pockets? I think Odyssey's pockets are full and that
will never produce earnings per share.


Finally, of great concern is the maritime mortuary laws which broken down simply mean that on a case by case basis
every find is subject to laws and arbitration of origin countries.


I own Odyssey and I'm long - but I have my doubts....

Do you know how much he has made on Infusystem since the stock has more than tripled because of
