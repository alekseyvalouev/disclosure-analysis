An Open Letter To Reed Hastings: Do An Equity Offering Now

by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


I am a huge admirer of Reed Hastings, a bold visionary striving to make his
company a market leader in an enormous emerging global market.


To do so, Netflix has been making big up-front investments, resulting in billions of
dollars of negative free cash flow.


To fund this deficit, Netflix has issued billions in debt - carrying so much debt is risky
and makes little sense in light of Netflix’s richly valued stock.


Therefore, the company should do a large equity offering immediately.


The same arguments hold true for Elon Musk and Tesla.


Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings is one of my favorite CEOs. His bold and
visionary leadership of Netflix has led the stock to increase more than 40 times in the last
5½ years. He’s also a great human being – a genuinely nice guy with a heart of gold (as a
young man, he served in the Peace Corps (like my parents), teaching math in Swaziland,
and currently serves on the national board of KIPP charter schools (I’ve been on the board
of KIPP NY for more than 15 years).


I have a long history with Netflix’s stock, starting with my foolish decision to be short it as it
more than doubled from $11 to $26 in 2010 (adjusted for a subsequent 7-for-1 split). In
frustration, I published an 18-page report, Why We’re Short Netflix, in December of that
year, laying out my short thesis.


(If you’re interested in shorting – learning from two dozen of the best short sellers and
hearing their best, actionable ideas – come to the one-day conference I’ve organized in
NYC on Thursday, May 3, The Art, Pain and Opportunity of Short Selling. A list of
speakers, further information, and registration is available at www.kaselearning.com;

To my astonishment, Hastings responded with an open letter only four days later, Netflix
CEO Reed Hastings Responds to Whitney Tilson: Cover Your Short Position. Now., which
began:

A great investor and a wonderful human being, Whitney Tilson recently posted an
article about why he is short Netflix (NFLX). Whitney, who is a major co-donor with
me to charter public schools like KIPP, writes that he has lost money betting against
Netflix, and that he is still short Netflix in a big way.


At Netflix we mostly focus on building our business and letting the numbers do the
talking. But Whitney is such a big-hearted donor to causes that I care about that I am
writing this open letter for him to try to get him to cover his short now. My desire is to
increase his odds of making money next year so he can donate even more to the
charter public schools that we both think are important to our country’s future. For
the record, I think short sellers are a positive force in capitalism, and I acknowledge
that CEOs are generally biased in their bullishness on their respective firms.


He concluded his detailed letter:


To wrap up, I have to agree with my friend Whitney that there are many risks ahead
for Netflix, that our valuation is substantial, and that it is possible that one could
make money shorting Netflix today. But shorting a market leading firm as it is driving
a huge new market is a very gutsy call. On balance, I would rather have my co-
philanthropists on the long side of this particular bet.


Whitney: Short or long, I look forward to dinner and drinks together in the New Year.


Respectfully, your ally and admirer,


-Reed


In all my years of shorting, I’ve never once had a CEO respond to me in such an open,
friendly and thoughtful way. (Note to all short sellers: if you ever get a response like this
from the CEO of a company you’re targeting, cover your short immediately!)


My partner and I accepted Hastings’ offer to meet and we had brunch with him six weeks
later near his home in the Bay Area. He was such a great guy – and such a smart thinker
– that we immediately realized we didn’t want to be short any company he was running –
at any price! – so we covered our position and published another in-depth report a few
days later, Why We Covered Our Netflix Short.


The stock subsequently rose to over $40 and then, amidst the Quickster debacle, fell
more than 80% to a low of just over $7 a year and a half later. I can only think of a handful
of times in my career when I bought a stock I had once been short, but I was so

impressed with Hastings and had developed such deep knowledge of and appreciation for
the company that I did so here.


I didn’t buy it the day it bottomed on October 1, 2012, but I pitched it that very day at my
investing conference (to see my slide presentation, click here) and went on CNBC
immediately afterward to share my view that Netflix looked very similar to Amazon
(NASDAQ:AMZN) 10 years earlier – and had a similar chance to go up 10x (little did I
know that this prediction would prove to be so conservative!).


I made five times my money in less than a year before I (stupidly) exited and have been
following the stock ever since, with a mixture of regret, admiration and amazement. It’s not
often that one sees a company go from a $3 billion to a $137 billion market cap in such a
short period.


An Open Letter To Reed Hastings: Do An Equity Offering Now


I am grateful to Hastings for the public letter he wrote to me in December 2010, which
helped me see the errors in my thinking and spurred me to take action to protect my
business, so I’d like to repay the favor with this open letter:


Dear Reed,


Congratulations on your company’s enormous success – well deserved!


I think you would be well served, however, to read the column that ran in the Financial
Times recently entitled, This is nuts, when does Netflix crash?.


I don’t think your stock is likely to crash – but neither can I rule it out, especially from the
extremely high valuation level it sits at today. It’s happened many times before and could
certainly happen again.


What really caught my eye in the FT article is that Netflix has $6.5 billion of debt ($3.7
billion net of cash), which is primarily the result of an $11.9 billion investment in streaming
content assets over the last five years, as this chart shows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157812-open-letter-reed-hastings-equity-offering-now 4/21


Note: Figures are from the cash flow statement: “Acquisition of streaming content assets”
minus “Amortization of streaming content assets.”


Investing so heavily in content was a bold bet that is paying off big time, as your market
cap has expanded by well over $100 billion during this period. It has, however, led to $4.4
billion of negative free cash flow (operating cash flow minus cap ex) over the last three
years, which has been funded almost entirely with debt, as this chart shows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157812-open-letter-reed-hastings-equity-offering-now 5/21


Raising Debt vs. Equity


Deciding whether to raise cash via debt vs. equity is one of the most important – and,
often, tricky – decisions a company can make. Much value can be created – or destroyed
– with the wrong decision.


In light of your stock’s performance, funding the free cash flow deficit with debt was the
right call over the past few years.


But no longer.


Debt is risky. It’s easy to get lulled into complacency when your market cap is so high, but
that can change – and quickly. You can’t pay interest and principal on debt with your
market cap, only cash – and your company is burning quite a bit of it.


Additionally, your debt level, as measured by a commonly used metric, is now quite high at
7.1x trailing EBITDA (4.1x net debt).


It makes sense for well established businesses with stable free cash flows to take on debt
– sometimes even a lot of debt. Additionally, even lesser companies may correctly choose
debt over equity because their share price is depressed and they don’t want to dilute
shareholders.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157812-open-letter-reed-hastings-equity-offering-now 6/21


But neither of these things is true with Netflix today: it’s not a well-established business
with stable free cash flows, nor is the stock depressed. In fact, just the opposite: it’s
trading 12x revenues, 153x EBITDA, and 251x trailing earnings!


In light of this, I strongly recommend that you do an equity offering to: 1) pay off all of your
debt, and 2) build a substantial cash hoard. I’m thinking something along the lines of $10
billion. This sounds like a lot of money, but with your $137 billion market cap, it would
result in dilution of less than 8%.


The significant strengthening of your balance sheet would not only reduce risk, but also
send a message of strength to every company Netflix does business with and competes
against.


You have one of the most valuable currencies in the world - your stock. The market is
offering you an extraordinary opportunity available to only a few companies - it would be
madness not to take advantage of it!


It would no doubt drop the stock a few percent in the short term, but remove a major risk
that, under certain circumstances, could threaten your company’s future.


The best leaders are the rare people who, when the sun is shining and skies are blue,
prepare for a storm.


Respectfully, your ally and admirer,


Whitney


P.S.: I would give the same advice, but even more emphatically, to Elon Musk right now.
Like you, he is a bold visionary, investing heavily in the future, but piling up even more
debt on Tesla’s (TSLA) balance sheet to fund even deeper negative free cash flows, as
this chart shows:

TSLA should do that offering, and then "SuperSize" it. Might as well go to Debt Free so that they can fund their next
factory or two plus leave them with operating cash to cover future losses.

Just watch the share price tank if they try a major issue of more TSLA. The institutions don't want to buy at
anywhere near the current price which is why Tesla took on more debt last August.

It's not operating cash, if it comes from an equity offering. We've entered a world where GAAP eps and
financial statements are being ignored for the sake of mega-cap growth metrics. One day, accountants might
be respected again.

Now would certainly be a great time to issue stock. NFLX is in somewhat better position than Tesla since they can cut
back on content spend if growth slows.

Whitney that's actually some great advice. I'm very bullish on NFLX and think the business is still underlevered - I am
conscious though that my view is at one end of a spectrum of opinion. I would fill my boots if offered stock at a 10%
discount. My guess is that the issue would be many times subscribed and that the adjusted post-rights price would
rapidly prove to be highly accretive. There are many who do have concerns around NFLX's leverage and FCF and a
large rights issue would put those worries to rest, setting the stock up for another leg higher. Lastly, better to raise
equity when you don't really need to, rather than waiting for the HY market to throw a tantrum, which it does
occasionally. However, as NFLX can raise funds at 5-6% by issuing bonds, it isn't an obvious call - arguably the fact
that they haven't launched a rights issue is the most bullish signal of them all, as it indicates that management are
convinced they can generate enough internal capital to deliver their business plan...

Just thinking out loud but there are plenty of entities that would backstop an issue with a big anchor order and which

Netflix has enormous pricing power. They can be cash flow positive anytime they want by raising price enough, they
just choose not to at this point. Because, once the competitions are left in dust, you'd have even higher pricing power.


20 Mar 2018, 11:57 AM


nerd_rage
"Enormous"? Well they have some. They could boost the fee a couple bucks as they increase their content,
but they need to be careful. They're not going to leave Amazon or Disney in the dust, and Apple could come
on strong if they put resources behind the effort.

It's very easy for people to pause their Netflix account, skip a month, wait for content to build back up, and
then jump back in. People do that now. The only real inhibition for lots more to do it is: continuous stream of
watchable content; and the price is so low that even the effort of clicking a button doesn't seem worth it.

I gave an analogy of Netflix once as a Single Young Lady at a ball. Perhaps she's late on her rent, she doesn't
have a car or even a 2nd outfit to wear. But every eligible bachelor has his eyes on her. And they're all
loaded. Will anyone fault this young lady for being "broke"? ... she knows exactly what's she worth, after all ...
and so does everyone else. Of course her beauty won't last forever ... but by then, she may even own venue
at which the ball was held.


Maybe a screwy analogy ... but you get the idea.

James Sands, Contributor
I don't think so yellowpage, to be cash flow positive, they may need to raise their monthly subscriptions north
of $40. There is a very strong disconnect with their business model and cheap price they are willing to take to
grow.


Netflix cannot exponentially increase its price in five years, but possibly over decades. There-in lies the risk.


20 Mar 2018, 01:29 PM


yellowpage
The revenue of 2017 was $12B and the FCF was -$2B. The average price is about $10. So you are looking at
$2 price increase to be FCF positive.

Hastings is a genius, unless you can read a cash flow statement. My model estimates over -$5 per share of FY18
negative cash flow. This genius is funded by a lot of fools... 
MUSK is also a genius of the same order. Hurry and do those equity offerings while the fools are aching to give you
their money!

WILL happen rather than what HAS happened. Being able to take an educated guess as to what will happen
in the future is the very essence of equity investing. When Zuckerberg founded FB, don't you think he was
taking a view on the future? When Ford invented the concept of mass production, or Ray Kroc bought out the
McDonald brothers? When Vanderbilt raised capital to build the first railroads do you think he had to make
some forward assumptions on projected traffic? When Exxon invests in a new well, does it need to model
projected output? The FIRST THING new analysts are taught is how to build a financial model that attempts
to paint a picture of the future. If you are unwilling to take a view on the future you have no hope...

Am I the only one that sees Netflix’s economic moat as weak? Everyone points to original content. Wake up and smell
the roses. They just had first mover advantage like TSLA. I like Netflix, but I think people are way over their skiis on
valuation


We’re getting flooded with great original content from Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. It’s accelerating. Everyone talked
about the first Netflix originals because it’s all that we had as a society and it was shockingly good. But now the other
players are doing the same thing and ganging up. Fresh original content is springing up everywhere. What value will
Netflix Originals content retain as viewership dilutes? The sheer number of titles being released will cause the age of
pop culture to drift further away from media.


Yet they trade at the same PE as Amazon? Heck no. The only reservation I have on this is their international growth
which is great for short to mid term revenue growth. It’s all just too damn speculative and I disagree with the “story”
stock.

India in US dollars is only around 1k...China 8k....12 us dollars to them is a lot more especially when China
has a cheaper and more subscribed to streaming service. Netflix and their investors are seriously under
estimating the computation especially since the other companies can afford to charge less than Netflix and

can afford to pay for higher quality content. Netflix might have been the first but they definitly aren't going to
win against companies who don't need to borrow money just to create more content.

They can't risk it, an 8% drop from issuing that kind of equity might trigger margin calls and prompt uninformed retail
investors to sell hard, leading to a crash and eventual re-rating to something more appropriate.


Best to pretend you don't need it, raise only when you need to and hope people keep buying.

Obviously the author and Reed Hastings move in the same circles. Might this be a trial balloon on the part of NFLX? 
Whatever the reason for this well written and cogent article (that makes a lot of sense), NFLX still has tremendous
upside and long ways to go. 
Very long NFLX!

If NFLX is using SA to fly this particular kite then we longs are in deep trouble. The company will be receiving
pitches from Wall Street on a potential equity raise on a weekly basis. They will also be receiving direct
approaches from a swathe of hedge funds and private equity funds who want to backstop a deal. The
Softbank Vision fund raised $100bn a couple of years ago for exactly this type of investment, just to name
one. The real question is whether Hastings feels the cost is outweighed by the benefit...

This recommendation makes sense as Netflix is more and more looking like a Ponzi scheme, but there is one 'but".
When they dilute, it may trigger a chain reaction and an ugly sell off. So, it is better for the Netflix management to sell
their stock before the crash - which some of them are already doing (check insider.com for more info).

I worked on a start up digital platform company, and months before we were generating revenues, we were $2M+ in
debt on content contracts alone! Make a long story short, we sold the company 2 years after because revenue
increased slower than content commitments.


In the case of $NFLX, a typical Amazon(where I worked 4 years) growth like company, I would even do a mix of
equity offering and corporate bonds taking advantage interest rates are very low, and lock it.

Perhaps, half bonds and half equity, and that would dilute 1/2 of what you estimate, and still fully strengthen the
balance sheet since LTD is considered as equity.

@author -- Put whatever spin you want on it, but advocating a dilution (new stock offering) is a statement by you that
you think the stock is a sell. After all, what is an offering other than an exchange of part of the ownership of the
company at the current stock price? that's literally the same thing an individual investor does when they sell shares,
except in this case, it's the company itself shedding some ownership share.


I sense you probably know this deep down, but are still so flattered that he responded to you directly before that you
could never bring yourself to state it that way.

"Put whatever spin you want on it, but advocating a dilution (new stock offering) is a statement by you that

Well yea, since the stock price is currently reflecting the next 10 years growth...


20 Mar 2018, 03:44 PM


BVI
puddn theoretically you are completely right but in this instance the rights adjusted price would likely move
higher, on a fully diluted basis. Look at what happened to some of the big bank stocks as they all did their
rights issues during the second stage of the post-Lehman recovery... If the capital is truly being raised to fund
growth and can be levered with internally generated capital as well as external debt, then a rights issue is not
always bad news for existing shareholders.


20 Mar 2018, 04:08 PM


puddnhead
Let me explain it by illustration:


Say for simplicity of calculation the secondary expands the shares outstanding by 10%, and is priced exactly
the same as the current price, and ignore all transaction costs (investment bank advisors, SEC & legal filings,
etc).


What the company is doing is diluting (increasing share count) by 10%, and in return getting back cash equal
to 10% of the current market capitalization. Every existing stockholder has been diluted in their ownership
share by 10%, in exchange for having an equal amount of cash deposits appear on the books (which they
own a proportional slice of as shareholders). Mathematically, from the individual shareholder's ownership slice
perspective, a company doing a 10% dilution is the exact same thing as a shareholder selling 10% of their

position, except the only difference is that in the former case the proceeds are in the corporation's
possession, while in the latter the proceeds are in the individual shareholder's brokerage account.


If you look at it this way, you will realize that the only time it's a good idea for a company to dilute is either if
the share price is unsustainable or, conversely, if there are growth opportunities out there that the company
needs capital to exploit, and debt markets are unwilling or unable to provide the funds. Because if there are
truly strong opportunities it is always in the best interest of shareholders -- who management has a sworn
fiduciary responsibility to look out for -- to finance growth out of debt, when the ROI on the additional
investment is expected to be higher than the interest rate of the debt.


So let's bring this back to NFLX. Hastings is essentially telling us, by taking on debt instead of a new offering,
that he is confident he can grow the cash flow/earnings faster than the interest rate he is paying. Tilson (the
author of this article) is saying the opposite, by suggesting its a good idea to dilute current shareholders, and
not even to expand the business, but to just improve the balance sheet. He can spin it all he wants, but in the
final analysis either he is cautious about the immediate future of the stock or he is not thinking rationally. (note
also that I am thinking only in terms of fundamental valuations, which I believe, per Ben Graham et al, the
stock price will ultimately reflect).


20 Mar 2018, 04:24 PM


BVI
puddn I agree with 99% of what you're saying. the 1% where we diverge is that whilst theoretically it is always
better for the equity to raise debt finance rather than dilute itself, in practical terms there is a limit to how much
leverage is prudent or - arguably more importantly - how much leverage is judged by the market to be
prudent. Having seen a fair number of LBOs fail over the years I am pretty convinced the HY market will
typically give management enough rope to hang themselves. I'm not saying NFLX falls into that category but I
do think that a well-managed equity raise might actually decrease the overall cost of capital here by
increasing the post-rights share price and reducing the cost of future debt issuance - who knows, it might
even lead to an investment grade rating, which would definitely provide a disproportionate boost to the stock
price...


20 Mar 2018, 04:42 PM


puddnhead
I continue to disagree with your 1%, but respect your opinion.


In fact I'm not sure we really disagree -- you are saying the equity offering is more "prudent" because you
don't have strong enough certainty that netflix will not get into trouble later. that is by definition "caution,"
which was my whole point.


There is nothing wrong with "prudence" but please, let's just call a spade a spade? Buying life insurance is
another example of something "prudent" -- it makes sense only in context of a risk being high enough that you
can't ignore it, otherwise actuarial tables say that for most it will be a "bad investment" (this happens to be on
my mind because I recently decided I could discontinue my own life insurance policy, as the financial risks to

my family of my untimely passing have decreased greatly over the last ten years due to my "improved
balance sheet" & other factors).


20 Mar 2018, 04:59 PM


BVI
Yes and fair enough. Would just add that one man's prudence is another man's recklessness and therein can
lie the rub - what matters not is an objective attempt to quantify future levels of risk as that is impossible,
rather what matters is the market's perception of risk and therefore how it prices the securities in question.
Net net though yes I guess you must be even more bullish than I am..!


20 Mar 2018, 05:57 PM


puddnhead
I'm actually not "bullish" though I can understand why you might think I am, because even though I've
commented on NFLX a few times over the last couple months, I don't believe I've ever publically shared (until
just now?) a clear statement of sentiment about the stock.


I'm just pointing out the logical fallacy in the author's argument, which I would believe no matter what my
personal sentiment is.

Re shares being 'part ownership of the company'...no they aren't.

Winston Chu, Contributor
You're taking the academic approach to torturous lengths puddnhead.


Everything you say is "true". I'm also certain Whitney Tilson knows this because he is a fantastic value
investor with a very long-term track record. Yet is there anything wrong with "selling" 10% to completely
remove the risk of defaulting on debt and running into bankruptcy?


Confidence and great business model is one thing. Yet things can ALWAYS go wrong at the market level.
That's why Buffett avoids high leverage - because if you never swim naked you can't get caught when the tide
goes out.


22 Mar 2018, 02:03 AM

Sorry that you found reading my opinion "torturous."


Not sure really where the discussion can go from there. Besides you aren't making any points that I didn't
already respond to in my 2nd reply to BVI four posts above yours. Not sure what the practical point was of
repeating a point he already made & I responded to, two days earlier.

After 20 years of investing this guy has no idea about what capital markets are for. If Netflix sells stock today and
stock goes down, how will the buyers in the offering feel? Screwed over. You want to reward your shareholders, not
make them lose money. If anything, stock should be sold at lower prices to them, so they are in the green right away.
You dont screw over your fellow shareholders, you treat them as family, and give them shares at low prices.
Furthermore, you never want the stock to go down, so that even the ones who paid the highest price make money.

The offering would be done below the current price, no one would be buying the offering at the current market
price. Also as a CEO, the day to day stock price movement is not yourconcern, your concern should be what
is best for the company in the long run. At the current stock price, it is absolutely the best decision to raise
cash from equity rather than increasing debt levels.


21 Mar 2018, 02:27 PM


Sanjay "John"
You still screw over the people who bought the stock above the current price. 
If you do an offering above the market price (at least 5%) I am okay with that.

But why dilute-Netflix can borrow at 5% surely it can beat that return in the years to come. Why sell your stock
if people are okay loaning money to you for cheap?


If trouble hits (market correction, etc.), you can tap the markets. This is what Netflix did in about 2012, they
did a small stock offering to strengthen their balance sheet.


But no sense in diluting at this point.


That's why I said the author has now clue about how capital markets work-he wants to dump stock high and
run away-you don't treat your fellow shareholders like this.


22 Mar 2018, 10:01 AM


vandeley
You should issue equity when your stock is expensive, not during a market correction when the stock will be
cheaper. How can you offer shares above the market price? Why would anyone buy that, that's ridiculous.
Also the more debt you take on, the more expensive it becomes...so new debt won't be 5%.


22 Mar 2018, 10:08 AM

Because the stock is not expensive, period.


22 Mar 2018, 12:36 PM

I as a shareholder do not want dilution. 
I want the company to take on moderate debts if needed. 
If they are in trouble they can dilute-but why dilute when things are going well? 
Sequioa understand this well, see this article about how they avoided dilution for Dropbox, to see how capital
markets work, or should work.
