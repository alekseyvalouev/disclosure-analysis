Texas Regulatory Filings, Mystery
Compensation Call Into Question American
Capital's Internal Controls And
Management's Integrity

Summary
Texas Tax, Texas Secretary of State, and Texas Comptroller documents from 2014
and 2015 call into question one of American Capital's most written-up acquisitions,
Service Experts.


An ACAS subsidiary, ACAM, paid a mystery unnamed employee $140 million over
the course of three years - who is this mystery man?


We believe the $140 million payment was structured in a manner that hid it from
ACAS's shareholders, arranged like a financing and hidden in ACAM's financials
which aren't consolidated into ACAS's.


We believe ACAS management's reputation is beyond repair, and we share Elliot
Management's concerns about director credibility.


We believe well-deserved increased public and potential auditor scrutiny of ACAS's
portfolio could delay or completely derail the company's ongoing strategic review
process.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_articles… 2/21


In this article, we're going to look at some documents that we've obtained from the
Texas Secretary of State and Texas Comptroller that we believe call into question
American Capital's (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:ACAS) ownership of its most marked-up
investment, Service Experts/SEHAC Holding Corporation. Service Experts is a company
that ACAS acquired from Lennox International (LII) in 2013, and since then, it has been
carried in ACAS's investment portfolio at about 10 times its cost. Yet, Texas tax filings
clearly show Lennox signing off on "Service Experts, LLC" tax forms as late as
November 2014 - and Lennox executives are listed as officers and directors of Service
Experts' subsidiaries as late as last week, according to the Texas Secretary of State and
Comptroller.


In 2013, ACAS used shareholder money to buy Service Experts, a company with
declining revenues and a cumulative operating loss of over $60 million for the two years
prior to the acquisition. It then appears to just make a nominal $5 million additional
investment into this business. Just nine months later, ACAS has marked up this asset by
5X. About a year after that, ACAS has listed the company at 10X what it paid for it.


Why is this a surprise? This newly marked-up entity was considered a dog by its
previous owner just a few quarters prior to being bought out.

Additionally, an ACAS subsidiary, ACAM, granted (at zero cost to the employee) an
unnamed employee ownership interest in one of its (ACAM) unnamed subsidiaries,
and repurchased this interest for $140 million, three years later. One would have to
carefully read an exhibit in ACAS's filings to find this tidbit of information, as it is hidden
in ACAM's Consolidated Financial Statements, a separate exhibit from ACAS's annual
filings. We believe ACAM structured this transaction to look far more like a financing
than a compensation expense, and because ACAM was not consolidated through ACAS
at the time, ACAS's shareholders may have had little to no idea what the impact of such
a financial arrangement would be. ACAS's shareholders deserve an explanation. We
believe that both of these examples illustrate just some of the reasons that the
company's integrity, including the valuations of its investments, needs to be called into
question.


We believe that if ACAS's auditor is forced to scrutinize the company's accounting
practices, this may lead to a delay of its 2015 audit and possible restatements.
Furthermore, if a final audit supports our belief that ACAS is using questionable
accounting, then the value of the company to a potential activist will likely be diminished.


We started looking at ACAS when we noticed that Elliott Management had increased its
stake in late November. With the fame that came from "the sovereign debt trial of the
century" between Elliot and Argentina, we wanted to make sure that ACAS was a name
we had on our radar. It was no surprise to us that shortly after getting involved, ACAS
announced that it would be undergoing a strategic review and increasing its buyback in
order to maximize shareholder value. The company's valuation looked conservative, and
this seemed like a great way to unlock value.


Elliot Management disclosed on November 25 that it owned 9.1% of the company and
that it had signed a non-disclosure agreement with the company - generally the type of
agreement used when activists take a larger role within management or plan to
participate in financings.


As we will show, we have found numerous questions related to compensation and
management's integrity at ACAS that we believe need to be explained to investors. Our
investigation is ongoing, but we felt that this was a reasonable time to release our
findings.


Who owns and operates Service Experts, LLC?

In addition, now that Elliott has called into question management integrity, we wonder
how one of ACAS's newest acquisitions, Lennox's Service Experts (listed as "SEHAC
Holding"), can be valued at such an extreme multiple of what was paid for it, just a few
years after being purchased.


In reviewing American Capital's portfolio, Service Experts, listed as SEHAC Holding
Corporation (Service Experts Heating and Air Conditioning), stood out to us because its
current fair value is listed at about ten times the cost that is listed for the Convertible
Preferred Stock and about seven and a half times the cost listed for the common stock.
This is the cost and fair value of SEHAC Holding Corporation as listed in American
Capital's last 10-Q report.


SEHAC Holding Corporation seems to encompass both Service Experts, purchased
from Lennox in 2013, but also several other acquisitions like 2014's acquisition of
Engineering Excellence National Accounts. However, surprisingly, we noticed that the
cost of SEHAC in ACAS's financials has not changed since Q3 2013.


Is it possible that SEHAC made acquisitions that justify such a significant increase in
valuation? Yes, it's possible - but plausible? Not in our opinion. With only a $5 million
increase in capital contributions and no disclosure of any significant debt, which would in
theory lower equity value, we find it incredible that these acquisitions alone would have
created over $100 million in value. So how is the value of SEHAC Holding Corporation
rising so quickly - up almost fifteen-fold in about 12 quarters?

This prompted us to look at the nature of the transaction between Lennox and American
Capital. We found the original press releases from both American Capital and Lennox
disclosing the sale in early 2013. Neither press release discloses the terms of the
agreement, but Lennox's press release does note that this is inclusive of a two-year
equipment supply agreement.


American Capital immediately brought in Scott Boxer, pictured below, a former COO of
Service Experts under Lennox to take on the role of the new CEO.


But this newly marked-up entity was considered a dog by its previous owner just
a few years ago.


Lennox apparently had the goal of divesting of Service Experts because it was an
underperforming business. Here is what Lennox said about the business in late
September 2012 at a Bank of America conference:

Our final segment is Service Experts. We've seen weakness in this business through
second quarter. Our revenue was down 13%. The disconnect between this business
and our Residential Equipment business is Service Experts doesn't participate in
residential new construction in any meaningful way and so they missed that bump.


It's also the dealers that are part of our Service Experts network have traditionally
focused on premium product, the premium segment and that's the segment of the
market that is not growing and they haven't been able to pivot as much as we would
like to the entry-level products. We're taking cost actions and we're repositioning the
business.


In addition, Todd Bluedorn, CEO of Lennox is quoted at the 2015 Wells Fargo Industrial
conference as saying:


Yes. I mean, look other than my family, I think I'd sell anything at the right price or sort
of walk away from problem, right. So, look, I got lots of confidence in our refrigeration
business, but if we end up where it isn't performing. Look, Service Experts wasn't
performing, we got rid of it; [Hearth] wasn't performing it, we got rid of it. So we're not
married anything, we'll do what's best for the shareholder.


To find that the business is now being valued at seven to ten times cost less than three
years later is astonishing. Could it be that just months after American Capital took over
the business, it has supposedly swung back to prominence and is now capable of being
valued at more than 10 times what was paid for it? We ask the auditors to tell us what
the current net income margins and multiples are being used to value the company, that
was bleeding money two years ago, today. What were they when Lennox sold the
business two years ago? These paper gains seem highly questionable, given Service
Experts' disclosed operating history.

Leading to even more confusion for us is that regulatory filings from the Texas Secretary
of State show us that Lennox executives are still listed as officers and directors of
"Service Experts, LLC" and "Service Experts Heating and Air Conditioning, LLC". Since
Boxer is the CEO of Service Experts, we were obviously looking for his name to show
up on all legal documents for the company. Here is a copy of results from the Texas
Secretary of State for "Service Experts, LLC" for 2014 and "Service Experts Heating and
Air Conditioning, LLC" for 2015. They both show Todd Bluedorn (Lennox's CEO) and
David Dorsett (Lennox's VP of Tax) as officers and directors of the company.


In addition, we were also able to locate the below Texas Franchise Tax Form from 2014
that indicates as of the time signed and submitted that Service Experts, LLC is still
100% owned by Lennox Corporation. Further, the names listed on this tax return are all
current officers and directors of Lennox including, once again, none other than Todd
Bluedorn, current CEO of Lennox.

Signed in November of 2014, this Texas franchise tax form indicates to us that Lennox is
still the beneficial owner of Service Experts. Clearly, continuing to sign tax forms for a
divested business seems sloppy on the part of Lennox. For ACAS, however, not
ensuring that it has ownership of an asset that it subsequently marked up 10X is, in our
opinion, grossly negligent, and if taken at face value of this tax document alone could
suggest a fraudulent transaction. We are choosing not to just take this tax document at
face value; however, we feel strongly that having this kind of lack of internal control only
leaves us with these kinds of choices to consider.


We can figure that someone at Lennox may have made an error, but for there to be no
corresponding filing from ACAS for Service Experts, we believe that this is clear
evidence of an internal control failure. Functional internal controls would have meant an
audit of the subsidiary, and any reasonable auditor may have required the filing of a
franchise tax form. As well, any investment with such a substantial revaluation should
receive heightened scrutiny from both auditors and directors, neither of which appears
to have occurred here. When viewed alongside other issues we will talk about, we
believe this should draw serious questions about the integrity of ACAS's disclosures.


We spoke to the Texas State Comptroller's office and inquired as to what the nature of
Lennox filing this form in 2014 may be. It informed us that in the case of a merger,
buyout, or acquisition during the tax year, only one company is required to file this form
and it is the company that is the new owner by the end of the year - and as the date of
the filing.


This leads us to ask several questions:


Is it appropriate for American Capital to list Service Experts at a fair value of seven to
ten times more than what it paid for it just three years after the deal took place?


1.


Why are officers and directors of Lennox Corporation still listed as officers of "Service
Experts, LLC" in 2014 and "Service Experts Heating and Air Conditioning, LLC" in
2015?


2.


Why does it appear that the Texas State Franchise tax filing for "Service Experts,
LLC" was prepared in late 2014 by Lennox Corporation and Lennox's VP of Tax?


3.


Why is Lennox Corporation listed as the parent company of "Service Experts, LLC"
on a form signed by David Dorsett (Lennox VP of Tax) in November 2014?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 10/21


What is the nature of the two-year equipment supply agreement between the two
companies, and what is the current status of Service Experts, Lennox Corporation
and American Capital?


5.


Are we being asked to take a massive leap of faith in believing all of this falls
under the course of "normal" business for a company that's turning around a
losing business?


This is the problem with fair value accounting in public companies - and especially
companies with Board members who all know one another - they basically have carte
blanche to do whatever they want.


No matter what the makeup of the preferred stock, we simply do not trust management
or that this newly acquired company, held under SEHAC Holding alongside a new 2014
acquisition and possible others without any additional cost, could be worth ten times
cost this quickly. This management team has a credibility problem, and we'd love to be
privy to SEHAC Holding's corporate structure and financials, should ACAS want to
disclose them.


ACAM lines a mystery employee's pockets with $140 million


American Capital Asset Management, LLC ("ACAM") is a wholly-owned portfolio
company of American Capital ("ACAS"), as the company writes in its 10-K:


Our asset management business is conducted through our wholly-owned portfolio
company, American Capital Asset Management, LLC ("ACAM"), a registered
investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940.


In this section, we want to look at what appears to be extremely robust compensation for
an unnamed employee that took place at ACAM from 2011 to 2014. An unnamed
employee was granted "membership units" that were entitled to a pro-rata share of any
distributions from the company paid to its members. These units were priced at about
$14 million when they were granted to the unnamed employee, and then at about $140
million when the company bought them back in two installments over the course of three
years.

Who makes this kind of money in just three years? Aaron Rodgers? Kobe Bryant? And
now an employee with no name at a subsidiary of ACAM? Who is receiving this
compensation?


Here is an exact quote from American Capital Asset Management, LLC's (ACAM) 2014
annual financial statements (all numbers in 000s):


Note 14. REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST


In 2011, a subsidiary of the Company (the "Subsidiary Grantor") granted restricted
units (the "Employee Membership Units") of the Subsidiary Grantor (the "Employee
Grant") to one of its employees (the "Employee Member"). Under the terms of the
Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of the
Subsidiary Grantor (the "Subsidiary Grantor LLC Agreement"), holders of the
Employee Membership Units are entitled to a pro-rata share of any distributions paid
by the Subsidiary Grantor to its members, including during the vesting period.
Additionally, the Subsidiary Grantor LLC Agreement allows the Employee Member to
require the Company to redeem vested Employee Membership Units at a value
defined in the Subsidiary Grantor LLC Agreement in certain circumstances that are
under the control of the Employee Member. The Company also has the option to call
the Employee Membership Units upon termination of the Employee Member. The
grant was originally scheduled to vest ratably over 5 years. After fully vesting, the
Employee Membership Units would have represented an 18% equity interest in the
Subsidiary Grantor. The grant was initially valued at $13,709. There have been no
other Employee Grants. In accordance with ASC 718, the Employee Grant is
accounted for as a liability award. As such, the value of the Employee Grant is
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. After the Employee
Member bears the risks and rewards normally associated with equity share
ownership for a reasonable period of time from the date the requisite service is
rendered, which is estimated to be six months after the vesting date, the fair value of
the vested portion of the Employee Grant, as measured six months after the date of
vest, is reclassified to Redeemable Non-controlling Interests (the "Maturation").

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 12/21


In 2012, the Employee Grant was modified (the "2012 Modification") to accelerate
vesting on a portion of the original grant that had not yet vested prior to the 2012
Modification. An expense of $36,929 was recognized in 2012 as a result of the 2012
Modification. At the date of the 2012 Modification, ACAM purchased Employee
Membership Units representing an 8% membership interest in the Subsidiary Grantor
from the employee for $55,898.


In 2014, the Employee Grant was further modified (the "2014 Modification") to
accelerate vesting on a portion of the original grant that had not yet vested prior to
the 2014 Modification. An expense of $19,657 was recognized in 2014 as a result of
the 2014 Modification. At the date of the 2014 Modification, ACAM purchased
Employee Membership Units representing the remaining 10% membership interest in
the Subsidiary Grantor from the employee for $85,000.


During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded compensation expense of
$30,742 attributable to the Employee Grant, including the expense associated with
the 2014 Modification. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded
compensation expense of $15,377 (unaudited) attributable to the Employee Grant.
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded compensation expense of
$63,225 attributable to the Employee Grant, including the expense associated with
the 2012 Modification. We calculated the compensation expense recognized during
the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 (unaudited) and 2012 assuming there
would be no forfeitures. Included in compensation expense were distributions of
earnings to the Employee Member attributable to Employee Membership Units which
had not yet matured on the date of the distribution of $1,781, $6,433 (unaudited) and
$7,172 during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.


Here is our interpretation of these events:


We believe that we are looking at a transaction that has the purpose of compensating
an unnamed employee to the tune of $140 million, but that the transaction may be
comprised in a way so that it doesn't appear as compensation; but rather as a
financing. Additionally, ACAM was not consolidated through ACAS at the time, so the
company's shareholders may have had little to no idea what the impact of such a
financial arrangement would be.

8/9/22, 7:42 AM Texas Regulatory Filings, Mystery Compensation Call Into Question American Capital's Internal Controls And Management's Integri…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 13/21


In 2011, an unnamed subsidiary of ACAM granted one of its unnamed employee
restricted units ("Employee Membership Units"), pursuant to which the employee was
entitled to a pro-rata share of any distributions paid by the Subsidiary Grantor to its
members - the employee also had the right to require ACAM to redeem (i.e. buy
back/repurchase) these vested Employee Membership Units at a value defined in the
Subsidiary Grantor in certain circumstances that are under the control of the
Employee Member. If the Employee Membership Units were fully vested, they would
represent 18% of the total equity interest in the Subsidiary Grantor. This grant was
initially valued at $13.7 million.


2.


In 2012, the Employee Grant was modified and the vesting of the Employee
Membership Units was accelerated. At the date of the 2012 Modification, ACAM
purchased these Employee Membership Units that represented an 8% membership
interest in the Subsidiary Grantor from the employee for $55.8 million.


3.


In 2014, the Employee Grant was further modified and the vesting was accelerated.
At the date of 2014 Modification, ACAM purchased the remaining 10% membership
interest in the Subsidiary Grantor from the employee for $85 million. There was no
redeemable purchase made from ACAM in 2013.


4.


Thus, it appears one subsidiary of ACAM granted one employee of American Capital
Asset Management 18% membership interest of that subsidiary in 2011, valued at
$13.7 million back then (it seems like the holder of Employee Membership Units had
costs of nil for this interest), and during the time period between 2012 and 2014,
ACAM purchased back a total of $140.89 million in Membership Units from that
employee holder.


5.


In other words, it appears the unnamed employee made $140.9 million from this non-
controlling interest redeemable arrangement in three years and, again, that this
transaction was not consolidated into ACAS's financials.


6.
8/9/22, 7:42 AM Texas Regulatory Filings, Mystery Compensation Call Into Question American Capital's Internal Controls And Management's Integri…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 14/21


We are curious not only as to who this unnamed ACAM subsidiary's employee is, but
which subsidiary of ACAM this is; the information doesn't appear to be disclosed in the
company's 10-K. If we compare the two payments of $55.8 million and $85.0 million
made by ACAM in 2012 and 2014 with the public company ACAS's net operating
income for these two years ($397 million and $117 million, respectively), we see this
purchase amount is 14.1% of the entire American Capital's net operating income in
2012 and 72.6% of it in 2014.


Let's face it; we are comparing this excessive compensation to ACAS because ACAM is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. ACAM can obscure the payments in its non-
consolidated financials, but when we pull them out and compare them to the entire
company's net operating income, we can see how big of an impact they'd be if found in
an ACAS filing.


Had this been consolidated into ACAS, we may have seen in the company's last 10-Q
that this sum of $140 million would represent the fifth largest investment for ACAS as a
whole.


In the interim, we have found that ACAM has disclosed its Redeemable Non-Controlling
Interests in its annual financials. For example, in the 2013 Annual Financial Results, it
stated the "Redemption of Employee Membership Units" was $12.57 million, which is
different from the $55.89 million stated in the "Note 13. REDEEMABLE NON-
CONTROLLING INTEREST" in its own annual financials.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 15/21


However, in its 2014 Annual Financials, it stated the "Redemption of Employee
Membership Units" was $85 million, which is the same amount of $85 million stated in
the 2014 annual financials' "Note 14. REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING
INTEREST".


The 2014 numbers appear to reconcile with the disclosed "Redemption of Employee
Membership Units" line item while the 2012 numbers do not appear to match. It's
unclear to us why the "Redemption of Employee Membership Units" number of $12.57
million recorded in the summary for FY 2012 was different from the purchase amount of
$55.89 million in FY 2012 stated under the financial notes in the annual report, yet those
two numbers match with each other for FY 2014.

8/9/22, 7:42 AM Texas Regulatory Filings, Mystery Compensation Call Into Question American Capital's Internal Controls And Management's Integri…

Regardless, the amounts paid for redemption of the non-controlling interests in 2012
and 2014 are substantial when compared to ACAS's reported net operating income.
Further, ACAM is the biggest investment in terms of fair value (based on ACAS's 10-K),
so the company has a nice deal in being able to compensate via ACAM while not having
to show these payments in its financials. Since ACAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
ACAS, this non-controlling interest likely drew cash from the company's shareholders
who appear to have paid this one employee upwards of $140 million over a three-year
period.


Our questions are:


Who is this superstar employee that ACAM delivered a risk free $140 million profit to
over three years - the same three years that ACAS's net operating income went from
$397 million to $117 million?


1.


What did this unnamed employee do over the course of three years to earn about
$140 million? Would the performance of the company been worse without this
employee; net operating income was already down about 75%.


2.


What subsidiary is involved in the issuance of these redemption units?3.


Was this $140 million issuance of ACAS's shareholder money approved by the Board
of Directors?


4.


Loaning employees risk-free cash to buy ACAS's stock?


Moving on, we have cases of two ACAS subsidiaries apparently lending its employees
cash to buy the company's common stock - and in one case indemnifying the
employees financially should their investments turn sour.


European Capital Limited is a fund that is managed by European Capital Asset
Management Limited. European Capital Asset Management Limited is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of ACAM, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ACAS.


From our due diligence, it appears that European Capital made loans to unnamed
employees for the purpose of them buying ACAS's common stock. Here's some
interesting verbiage from European Capital Limited's 2014 Annual Financial Statements:


Note 11. Loans to Investment Manager Employees

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 17/21


European Capital made loans to employees of the Investment Manager in the form of
non-recourse notes to purchase the common stock of American Capital from
December 2005 to February 2007. The Original loans are denominated in US dollars,
bear interest at the Applicable Federal Rate at the date of grant, and were repayable
from April 2014 through March 2016. In 2010, the employees waived their right to
exercise the written put option following which the shares associated with this
arrangement can be sold by European Capital and used to repay the loans.


Following the employees waiving the right to exercise the put option, the fair value of
these loans is determined by reducing the principal of the loans to the fair value of the
shares of American Capital associated with this arrangement. The amount
outstanding on these loans as of 31 December 2014 was €7,088 (2013: €6,006). As
of 31 December 2014, the fair value of the shares of American Capital based on the
closing market quote was €2,823 (2013: €2,645), which is recorded in other assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The revaluation of the shares at the balance
sheet date has resulted in depreciation of €432 (2013: appreciation of €348; 2012:
appreciation of €692), which is included in net unrealised appreciation (depreciation)
of investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


The interest earned on these loans for the year ended 31 December 2014 was €266
(2013: €264; 2012: €259).


In March 2014, after agreement with the employees the loans expiring in 2014 were
extended by four years and the interest rate was reset at 3.5%. Loans with maturity
dates in 2015 through to March 2016 will be extended for a period of four years with
the agreement of the employees.


Another example is the "French Stock Loan Plan", which is fleshed out in ACAM's 2014
Annual Financial Statements:

8/9/22, 7:42 AM Texas Regulatory Filings, Mystery Compensation Call Into Question American Capital's Internal Controls And Management's Integri…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3747076-texas-regulatory-filings-mystery-compensation-call-question-american-capitals-internal?source=all_article… 18/21


In 2005 through 2007, pursuant to a long-term incentive plan (the "FSL Plan"), ECAM
made non-recourse loans (the "French Stock Loans") for the purchase of common
shares in American Capital (the "American Capital Shares") by employees of its
French branch (the "FSL Participants"). The French Stock Loans were collateralized
by the American Capital Shares acquired by the employees and have original
maturity dates of April 2014 through March 2016, which may be extended with the
permission of the FSL participants. Loans that had original maturity dates in 2014
have been extended until 2018. The Company originally accounted for the FSL Plan
as if it was a stock option plan. During 2009, the Plan was modified such that
participants forfeited their rights to the American Capital Shares and transferred
control of them to ECAM in return for the indemnification by ECAM of their future
income tax liabilities, if any, arising from the forgiveness of loans made under the FSL
Plan. The indemnification was made pursuant to indemnification agreements (the
"Indemnification Agreements") entered into with the participants as part of the
modification and was capped at a maximum of $15,309 (the "Original Indemnification
Cap") in the aggregate. Proceeds on the sale of shares of American Capital Shares
controlled by ECAM will be used to offset participant indemnification liabilities. In
conjunction with and as a condition of entering into the Indemnification Agreements,
an escrow account was established and was funded with $15,309 (the
"Indemnification Escrow"), which represents the maximum potential liability as
calculated on the date the Indemnification Agreements were executed.


The French plan differs from the European plan in that it actually indemnifies employees
from losses in the case where loans are forgiven, creating a tax liability.


In the case of European Capital, the loans were initially repayable from April 2014
through March 2016, but it appears that European Capital has extended the dates of the
maturities - perhaps while waiting for ACAS's stock to appreciate?


What type of a company enters into an agreement with its employees wherein it loans
them money and indemnifies them financially against losses in purchasing its parent
corporation's common stock?


Why not structure this compensation as normal stock options? Could it be because this
type of plan creates a significant expense and causes dilution?

Most importantly, we believe investors need to ask: How much loan exposure
does ACAS have to its own stock price?


In Elliott's letter to the company, it raises points about the board's integrity and
management's ineffectiveness. Here's the five concerns that Elliot Management raises
in its letter, with our emphasis in bold:


Ineffective management drives low valuation. Median analyst price targets for
ACAS point to a 10% discount to NAV, compared to a 48% and 7% premium for
comparable internally managed BDCs and externally managed BDCs, respectively.


Poor capital deployment. ACAS has continued to deploy capital into highly
illiquid and risky assets instead of generating riskless accretion through share
repurchases.


Directors lack qualifications to oversee management. With an average Board
tenure of 15 years and limited professional investment experience, the Board
lacks the relevant expertise to govern the behavior of the investment team
and hold management accountable.


Compensation that rewards failure. ACAS has consistently paid excessive
compensation for poor performance, as evidenced by the Company receiving
"F" grades in Glass Lewis' pay-for-performance model for each of the last four
years (and no better than a "D" since 2008).


Excessive overhead. ACAS's compensation expense ratio is one of the highest
compared to publicly-traded alternative asset managers.


The above-mentioned examples of compensation and loans to employees are two
perfect examples of what Elliot is talking about.


Strategic review may be at risk

We have some very real concerns about management's integrity and ACAS directors'
abilities to be independent. We share the same view as Elliot, who comes right out and
says that the company has numerous major problems. The only difference is that we
see these major issues as a reason to be even more cautious, as opposed to taking an
investment in the company and trying to somehow unlock value. Why do we take the
opposite stance as Elliot Management? Because we believe that some of the problems
may lie in the underlying portfolio, and in the event ACAS can't continue to raise money
or has ACAM called under immense scrutiny, it may cause a disaster that cannot be
repaired.


What we have here are a litany of questions that we believe need to be answered in
detail before ACAS can move forward with its strategic review.


Who was the unknown employee that made $140 million over the course of three
years?


1.


Why did a subsidiary of the company issue loans to employees for the purposes of
buying ACAS's common stock versus issuing stock options?


2.


With the company's biggest shareholders admitting management's credibility is shot,
how can we trust SEHAC - or any other portfolio company's - fair value?


3.


We have a significant amount of due diligence that we still would like to undertake, but
we believe that questions raised in our report need to be examined very closely by
potential investors.


We also believe that this new evidence will likely shine a new light on the company's
ongoing strategic review process, as we believe potential acquirers of the company (as
well as Goldman Sachs (GS), which is working with the company) will need to partake in
significantly more due diligence than they already have. Further, we believe this new
evidence will delay any type of acquisition or strategic alternatives for the company well
into 2016, as all parties will need to be very comfortable with all of the facts before
moving forward. We doubt the company will be able to issue a decision on its strategic
review by January as it has planned.
