BAD NEWS FOR WORLD
ACCEPTANCE CORP.: THE
STATE-BY-STATE
LOOPHOLE BUSINESS IS
NOW GOING OUT OF
BUSINESS


In May, Citron research introduced readers to the
curious case of World Acceptance Corp. 
(NASADAQ:WRLD) a sub-prime lender doing
business in approximately 900 locations mostly
located in the South.  Citron has been quiet as of
late because 1.  markets have turned
indiscriminately positive 2. We were waiting to
assess the prospects for regulation of sub-prime
lenders.


Neither a bank nor a payday lender, World has built
its entire business on loopholes — and therefore
its operating region is limited to just 11 states
where its been able to curry the favor of state
legislatures to open the loopholes in state usury
laws so it can make sub-sub-sub-prime loans at
super-high rates.  Any form of federal law, which
has never existed, would supercede the many
loopholes enabling WRLD to operate in their niche
states.


We’re sure World’s shareholders have been sitting
on the edge of their seats as lobbying organizations
such as World’s own NILA (www.nilaonline.org) ,

along with an army of banking industry lobbyists,
are toiling night and day in DC seeking ways to
torpedo the proposed Consumer Financial
Protection Agency (CFPA).  And with good reason: 
uniform Federal regulation by the CFPA would
threaten World’s entire business model.  Refer to
last week’s statement from the CFPA’s architect,
Elizabeth Warren, the chair of the Congressional
Oversight Panel overseeing the US banking
bailout. http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4454
[http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4454]


“But there is an even bigger change in the
wind: regulating the non-banks. Democrats
and Republicans alike agree that the
proliferation of unregulated, non-bank
lenders contributed signi�cantly to the
�nancial crisis by feeding millions of
dangerous �nancial products into the
economic system. Non-bank institutions
were active participants in the race to the
bottom among lenders.


From sub-prime mortgage loans to small
dollar loans, they showed how to wring high
fees and staggering interest rates out of
consumer lending. Their �ne-print contracts,
and new tricks and traps, transformed the
market.”


A Turn of Events


Before today, the question was “Will there or won’t
there be a CFPA? ”


Enter the Fed.  As of today, the only
remaining question is not whether World
will come under uniform Federal
regulation, but only the inevitable:  how
soon, and by whom?

“Lenders that are neither banks nor
owned by holding companies remain
beyond the reach of federal oversight. The
Obama administration has proposed a
single oversight framework for all lenders
as part of its �nancial reform package.”


Everyone now realizes the need for uniform Federal
regulation of consumer lending, and it has become
inevitable.  The Fed, which has resisted the new
CFPA initiative because of the potential overlap of
its jurisdiction, doesn’t need new legislation to �re
up its own operations — it’s given notice that it’s the
new sheri� in town, e�ective today.  That step
aligns all the parties — Congress, the Obama
Administration and the Fed — in their intent : to
protect the sub-prime consumer from predatory
lending practices.


Citron notes that while a federal interest rate cap
would put World completely out of business, it
doesn’t expect this outcome in the near term.  And
it won’t take a �xed interest rate cap to seriously
impair World’s business.  A more likely outcome is
prohibition of the most abusive practices of
“�ipping” and “packing” — which is more than
enough to devastate World’s cash �ow and viability.


So the question for World becomes:  who’s
jurisdiction do you want, the Fed or the CFPA? 
Either way, expect a set of regulations that
eliminate the egregious di�erences between how
states treat “cycle-of-debt” lending practices.  Citron
believes that with its narrow business model (its
entire business is one product:  a portfolio of low-
dollar, paper-based, high-interest, frequently
�ipped consumer installment loans) it is now the
single most vulnerable �nancial company in
America to regulation which could derail its entire
business, regardless of whether a CFPA is ever
voted into law as a standalone agency…..but that is
not where the story ends.


Something in the Books Smells Real Funky


As consumer credit has hit a 26 year low WRLD’s
receivables book might lie in the graveyard with
other non-collateralized sub-prime lenders.

Interest rates for World’s customers, who typically
are not credit-worthy enough to qualify for
conventional bank loans or might not even have a
bank account, start at over 80% APR. However, by
actively marketing the nefarious practice of
“�ipping”, (eg re-writing existing loans every time
the customer is at risk of missing a payment), and
“packing” (selling “credit insurance” of dubious
value bundled as an extra fee with the loan) World
jacks its e�ective yield — the take on its portfolio of
loans outstanding — to over 100%, as reported in
�lings.


World claims it has sailed through the hurricane of
the current �nancial crisis without even getting
wet.  Its loan losses, a �gure the company can
pretty much set to whatever it wants in the short
term, have barely moved from pre-crisis levels. On
the last conference call, analyst after analyst
inquired how this could be. Management’s answer
was essentially that “Our customers are
unique. They are more a�ected by the price of gas
than credit distress, because essentially our
customer is always economically distressed.”


It is the opinion of Citron Research that World’s
story is reaching the breaking point. As detailed in
the linked story below, credit quality is still in
serious decline, and the states most impacted are
World’s breadbasket. In fact World’s operations
are so concentrated in this region, that four of the
�ve most distressed states represent 45% of their
US locations.

Unemployment, which sits at record levels, is hitting
�nancially marginal consumers hardest.  While the
rate of job losses has begun to slow,
unemployment is still rising, and job creation – the
real relief — has not even begun to surface. With
unemployment closely correlated to credit distress,
somehow investors are asked to believe World’s
bottom-tier credit customers are immune to

unemployment and underemployment, as well as
gas prices that have doubled o� their lows.


On their last conference call, World was asked
repeatedly by analysts how in the face of these
adverse conditions, it justi�es lowered loan loss
reserves. When asked about the increase in loans,
and obviously reluctant to discuss its reliance on
loan -�ipping, management cited less competition
from HFC and CitiFinance.


Citron has observed a pattern that small companies
under scrutiny of short-sellers �nd “creative” and
“unique” ways to make their
numbers….temporarily.  In the case of World, we’re
getting into the realm of the ridiculous.


We know that HFC exited the bottom-end
consumer �nance business in March of 2009 after
confessing to a book of mounting losses, and
CitiFinance put its book of bottom-end consumer
�nance business in its “bad bank”.  Yet World asks
investors to believe its nearly $500 million book of
uncollateralized and unsecured loans, at rates
double to triple Citi’s or HFC’s, remains fully
collectable.


Remember, World isn’t a bank – it won’t be
receiving any government �nancial support – and
investors won’t be receiving any warning notices
from regulators about its �nancial vulnerabilities
either.


It is the opinion of Citron Research that by serially
�ipping and re-writing loans 45 days delinquent, (a
“service” which World discloses it “actively markets
to its customers”) the company masks the true low
quality of its receivables. Further, by its own
admission, it also rewrote over $40 million in loans
from its own “delinquent” status (beyond 45 days
overdue).


Even states that aren’t actively rewriting laws to
curb the abusive practices of WRLD and other
installment lenders are actively establishing
alternatives to extend credit to WRLD’s type of
customer. (Note that World has more than twice as
many locations in Texas than any other state.)

World Acceptance’s Dirty Little Secret.   We
expect nothing less…. 


On the conference call, management stated, “if you
look at individual branches, you see a wide disparity
between the best and the worst”. Now Citron o�ers
an explanation.  WRLD operates in the gray area of
“non-payday” lending to the US military.  Just two
years ago, the 2007 Military Authorization Act made
it illegal to issue payday loans, car title loans, and
tax refund anticipation loans with rates exceeding
36% to members of the US military or their families.

[http://www.usmilitary.com/1502/military-�nancial-
protection/]


It is obvious that WRLD has sidestepped the spirit of
the law by marketing and transacting installment
loans at 80% + APR to military personnel (terms
over 91 days get around the law) .


Here’s the face of World’s military lending in Killeen
Texas:

the terms of these loans to our soldiers in Killeen. 
If a soldier borrows only $675, he/she ends up
paying an APR of over 100% and that is only on the
unlikely chance that the borrower pays the loan o�
at maturity … rates will be higher if the loan is
�ipped, like nearly all of WRLD’s loans are (an
average of 3 times each).


According to article 70 of the Warner Act, the
military law applies to both service members
and their dependents. It stipulates that the
APR of a covered extension of credit cannot
exceed 36% APR, and it mandates
disclosures and terms mirroring the Truth in
Lending Act. It also includes a provision
against any state or federal preemption,
unless those laws provide even greater
protections.


Other provisions include the following prohibitions:
(All of which WRLD participates in)


Lenders may not roll over, renew,
re�nance or consolidate credit unless
the new transaction results in more
favorable terms to the borrower.
Borrowers cannot be required or
allowed to waive the right to legal
recourse.
In the case of dispute, lenders cannot
require the borrower to submit to
arbitration or impose onerous legal
notice provisions.

World �nds military lending pro�table because they
can easily get their collection hooks into a soldier’s
pay – by putting the loan on “allotment” (the
military’s direct deposit system), or calling the
soldier’s chain of command — a commonly used
collection tactic.

It is Citron’s opinion that WRLD has
intentionally grown its business of usury-rate
lending to members of the US military. As soon
as this loophole is closed, so go those “best
offices”.  


Conclusion


Citron still believes that WRLD has got one foot on a
banana peel and the other in the corporate
graveyard, in which are buried every other sub-
prime lender that thought they were one step
ahead of the market.  We believe that management
is facing too many potential landmines, including a
new regulatory scheme intent on leveling the
consumer debt �eld across all states.  If just one of
those landmines blows, the true liabilities of its
in�ated portfolio of unsecured, uncollateralized
receivables will be exposed.


World’s business window is narrowing in both time
and geography.  While it waits for Federal
regulation, it can’t meaningfully expand its eleven-
state operations to any new states if it loses one or
two.  It o�ers only one type of transaction — a
paper-based installment loan — and has no
presence in any form of electronic commerce, no
debit cards, no ATM’s, etc.  As a source of growth,
its Mexico initiative is obviously failing to generate
pro�ts or growth.  Citron believes its military
lending business is at heightened risk of being shut
down at any time, regardless of the Fed or CFPA.


As economic distress falls disproportionately on
those at the bottom of the economic pyramid,
Citron Research believes an increasing percentage
of the loans on World’s books are in fact delinquent
and noncollectable, masked by a corporate policy of
serially �ipping them whenever the borrower can’t
pay.  Adding the inevitable federal regulation to
close state-by-state loopholes, Citron concludes
World’s options are dimming, and its entire
business model is at severe risk.
