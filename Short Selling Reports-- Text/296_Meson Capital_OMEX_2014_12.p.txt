Is Oceanica's EIA Deliberately Not Being Filed While Trying To Raise
Capital?
Jul. 8, 2014 11:03 AM ET29 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


OMEX announced June 4th that the Environmental Report (EIA) for Oceanica was
“completed and ready to be filed shortly”: as it is STILL not filed, this is clearly
deliberate.


We believe OMEX has chosen not to file the EIA because they know it will expose
the project as environmentally and economically unviable: most mining projects die
in this phase.


OMEX appears to be desperately attempting to raise capital to cover a current cash
balance under $2mm that is likely to be zero soon, as cash burn remains
$3mm/month.


An Oceanica capital raise would immediately be funneled to OMEX corporate to pay
high compensation and ongoing cash burn, while diluting OMEX shareholders’
upside.


Management statements now backtracking JP Morgan involvement: definitively NOT
assisting OMEX on a capital raise for Oceanica, only potential “strategic” deals,
which we are highly doubtful of.


Update on Cash Balance Estimates at Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. (OMEX):

Our updated estimate of cash balances at Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)
makes us believe that we will be seeing lots more highly promotional, but empty press
releases as desperation for more cash to pay their staggering cash burn increases. Given
that the SS Central America recovered 1,000 oz in the first day and 5,000 ozs after 6
weeks of recovery (based on the $100,000 value @ $20/oz stated at the June 4 AGM), we
believe it is unlikely that OMEX has been able to draw much more than the $4.8mm they
announced on May 15th on their new Fifth Third credit line, which has stringent collateral
requirements beyond the first $5mm. Further - we do not believe there is any prospect for
monetizing this salvage until 2015 at the earliest: The receiver will take time to receive
maximum value and will not care about the time pressure from rapid cash burn that OMEX
is under.


What possibility does OMEX have to survive Q3 without filing for bankruptcy (We initially
predicted an equity filing or bankruptcy raise Oct 31, 2013 within 12 months and continue
to believe this is on track)?

Sources re: Baja Phosphate deposits well known: 1967, 1989, 1980, 2007


QUESTIONS:


Well, maybe…


Q: Does OMEX have proprietary technology to extract phosphate?


Q: Does OMEX have any phosphate mining experience?


Q: Does OMEX have unique political "in's" to get the permits?


Q: Did OMEX put large capital at risk that nobody else was willing to?


A: No evidence we are aware of for any of the above…


What situation makes more sense to you?


A) OMEX was simply the first to put 1+2 together and realize they could make a large
economic project out of mining phosphate off the seafloor (which has never been done
economically before)?


B) Oceanica is merely a recycled project that major strategic players have already
evaluated and passed, where Mexico is happy to receive an est. $3mm+ per year in
permitting fees that would give OMEX a vehicle to use grandiose terms like "Millions of
Tonnes" and "World Class" in promotional press releases while they attempt to raise more
capital from investors to fund their nonstop losses: funding egregious insider
compensation (CEO, Greg Stemm had a record $1.311mm reported compensation in
2013: source) and lavish lifestyles?

Is this even the first time someone has used this technique to raze money from
investors? (…NO)


Here's one example:


Jan 24, 2007: PhosMex Records First Offshore Mineral Mining Concession Ever Granted
by Mexico


This concession, granted for the next fifty years, covers 100 square miles. This new
type of mining claim was made possible due to a recent change in the Mexican coastal
mining law. The concession contains 250,000,000 tons of phosphate ore (P2O5), which
in today's market is worth over 12 billion dollars. The phosphate rock deposit occurs
over a wide area in waters approximately 120 feet deep in continental shelf coastal zones
of the Mexican State of Baja del Sur de California. … Technological improvements
during the past 25 years have made deeper offshore exploration and dredging
commercially attractive. PhosMex Corporation believes, with current technology and the
current price of phosphate, an offshore dredging operation will be very profitable in today's
market, particularly given the location of this project and the markets this deposit can
serve.


(emphasis ours)


WOW - looks familiar doesn't it?


Phosmex: DEAD


But maybe phosphate prices have increased since then?

No, phosphate prices have declined substantially.


OMEX Repeatedly Promises they will File the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) "shortly":


(emphasis ours)


November 7:


Odyssey subsequently traded services and expertise in development of the project
for equity in the holding company (Oceanica) which owns the shares of the company
in Mexico.


...We have retained an independent expert to advise us as to when we can and
should disclose more details on the Oceanica deposit. We anticipate that this could
happen within the next three to six months, but it could happen sooner if
Odyssey's management, using advice from the independent expert, determines that
additional disclosure is necessary or appropriate.


March 17 Conference Call:


-In PR: released preliminary assessment of Oceanica with "millions of tonnes" of ore...


(by UNNAMED "Qualified Person" who would have merely used data provided by OMEX).

"We anticipate Oceanica raising funds in 2014 to cover all or part of its own cash
needs going forward." -OMEX CFO


President: The first part of your question was; do we anticipate potentially
monetizing this investment prior to environmental approval. On that question, for
some time now our advisors have been recommending that we wait for any
significant monetization until environmental approvals are secure and simply
that's because at that point the project will be completely de-risked and you would
expect your evaluations to be higher


...In order to begin extraction you'd have to have an environmental approval from the
government and that process is currently underway, so that should be the next up
to look for; and as I mentioned earlier, as we can, we'll be continuing, I think, in the
coming couple of months to release updates on where that project is.


...we expect another update to this NI43-101 price sometime in the coming quarter
next 60 to 90 days


5-13-2014


We expect the official submission to be filed shortly


President: Over the past few months, Oceanica has been on a proactive outreach
campaign to work with the government and local communities concerned with this
project. To-date, these efforts have been instrumental in building strong supporting
relationships.


...We're hopeful that if they [Oceanica] can get their deal done at the right valuation,
which we think is very possible, then obviously, we have a receivable that's due to
us, so that would actually result in cash coming to Odyssey at some point relatively
soon thereafter.


CFO: Let me start off by making something very clear. We have no plans to do any
equity raise with Odyssey stock. Concerning your question specifically, we believe
that the cash we have on hand from operations and other non-dilutive financing
alternatives will be sufficient to fund our 2014 plans and operations.


*FACT: OMEX share count increased post March 31 by at least 903,000 shares, most
likely by 1.3mm shares as debt was repaid with shares issued at a 15% discount to
market.

6-4-2014 AGM Presentation


Greg Stemm, CEO: The next step in this project will be the submission of the
Environmental Impact Assessment. I am pleased to report that this filing - all 1,200
pages of it - is completed and ready to be filed shortly


...As we have mentioned previously, JP Morgan is representing this project for us
with potential strategic investors and the development of a plan for maximizing
shareholder value on the property. Rodney Miller, a Managing Director in JP
Morgan's Mergers and Acquisitions Group and Jeffrey Price, Managing Director of
their Chemical and Fertilizers Group in New York are representing the project and
have been very helpful in developing our ongoing strategy for Oceanica.


Q: Why has OMEX repeatedly said they are going to file the EIA while they have
not?


We believe they KNOW that they have no chance of receiving environmental approval and
are attempting to raise money for Oceanica right now and are most likely deliberately not
filing the EIA. We believe OMEX knows that if they provided proper transparency by filing
the EIA and NI43-101 publicly, as other mining companies do, this project would rapidly be
exposed as worthless and unviable.


Further, we believe OMEX is misrepresenting JP Morgan's involvement in order to borrow
credibility from their name. Based on our market sources, JP Morgan is NOT helping with
any Oceanica-specific capital raise and OMEX is currently attempting to hire a banker for
this (Where's MAKO?). Rather, it has been now spun that JP Morgan is helping to
negotiate for a potential "strategic deal".


We are highly skeptical of this as we have never heard of a bank like JP Morgan working
on a "success-fee only" condition. Why would a strategic partner buy or partner with
Oceanica when it could easily replicate its assets by simply leasing nearby property (see
Phosmex above) for a nominal expense?


New Due Diligence On Oceanica:


We spoke with two consultants who had worked on the failed Magdalena bay phosphate
project operated by Rofomex just south of Oceanica. Rofomex spent ~20 years and
countless millions of dollars exploring the entire region, including taking offshore core
samples. Instead of pursuing a plant in the current "Oceanica" concession, Rofomex



http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/OMEX/2984585084x0x760456/08d87fff-c1ec-4bc2-8a77-83311d0005de/filing.pdf

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2303945-is-oceanicas-eia-deliberately-not-being-filed-while-trying-to-raise-capital 8/21


chose the Magdalena bay area. Rofomex also (unsuccessfully) attempted to produce
phosphate from the "Santo Domingo" onshore phosphate deposit which is literally the
beach adjacent to Oceanica.


Mining phosphate both onshore and offshore in this area is not some new hidden idea or
concept. It has been tried multiple times over decades and anyone with the internet and
Google can see why it has never been done. This is not something that the bigger
phosphate players have never heard of or don't know about. If you call anyone involved in
this space they all have heard about ocean phosphate dredging projects and the failed
Magdalena bay project.


Based on our discussions with consultants who worked hands-on on the Rofomex deposit,
we believe the following are incrementally new and important points to our initial extensive
report on Oceanica:


1. The cost to get any commercial project done for Oceanica is staggering and not even
close to economic currently even if everything goes exactly as planned and on budget
(which never happens in mining).


a. Consultant #1


i. Said the general rule of thumb for the cost of phosphate production is the facility for
refining it into something commercially useful costs $100-120 per tonne. He said a 2m
tonne plant would be pretty typical, so figure $200-240m for the plant alone. For this
project though, you'd also need the ships, a port of some kind, etc. The total cost would
depend on how much refining is done locally vs. higher shipping costs, but he would
estimate at least $550m or so in startup capital costs but could easily be considerably
more.


ii. For production costs, he estimated average operating expenses for phosphate mines
globally are ~$65 per tonne. Then shipping costs for refined phosphate from "Oceanica" to
the nearest market would cost at least another $15 per tonne. He said the cost just to take
a boat like that through Panama canal is $15 per tonne so shipping to Florida or the gulf
could easily be $20-25 per tonne alone.


iii. He said all of the salt would need to be removed from the raw phosphate slurry and that
is not easy to remove plus it is corrosive in any facility: adding substantial additional
material handling costs.


iv. None of this factors in that Mexico's mining tax is 7.5% of any pre-tax earnings (I
believe before depreciation too).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2303945-is-oceanicas-eia-deliberately-not-being-filed-while-trying-to-raise-capital 9/21


v. All of the above assumes "best case" scenarios.


b. Consultant #2


i. Thinks all-in to go from nothing to fully functioning commercial production there would
cost $750m to $1b


ii. Said IPHS had looked at producing in the area in both 2009 and then again in 2011-
2012 and both times they found it was uneconomic as they didn't move forward.


2. They both state there is essentially no way to do this without serious environmental
impact if for no other reason than just the processing


a. There are several ways of processing phosphate, but all of them have serious
environmental concerns. Neither the fatty reagents typically used or the less
environmentally friendly amine reagents floated with the sand would be without
environmental consequence and virtually impossible to keep this entirely removed from
the environment.


b. If they do any processing on land there, anything 75-100 microns or less would have to
be discarded back into the water and that could cloud the water with unclear
environmental consequences.


c. Even if they produce a semi concentrate offshore and pump the leftover slurry back to
the bottom of the ocean, it may not impact the water quality too much at the surface, but
anything on the seafloor would be dead for at least a few acres, depending on currents,
etc. This assumes no chemicals are used and just simple dewatering.


d. According to one of the consultants, Rofomex spent ~$70m (in ~1975-1980 dollars!)
and had made several attempts to produce phosphate in Magdalena bay, but all failed and
they eventually gave up and sunk their dredge ship.


e. Both consultants seemed to think that some processing would have to occur onsite or
the shipping costs would be far too high for this project to ever be economic. In fact, the
Rofomex plant was a floating barge, which was literally intentionally sunk after the project
completely failed, resulting in a complete loss of capital.


3. Back in 2009, the local Mexicans were already "not happy" with IPHS proposed
phosphate project in the area directly adjacent to Oceanica and was one reason why
IPHS dropped plans to pursue any project in that area.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2303945-is-oceanicas-eia-deliberately-not-being-filed-while-trying-to-raise-capital 10/21


a. If locals were not happy with a previously proposed project in the same area, put forth
by more credible and financially stronger company IPHS, how could the local Mexican
community possibly find Oceanica acceptable?


Potential Oceanica investors need to conduct serious due diligence to verify the
extraordinary claims by OMEX


Any potential investors in Oceanica need to do their own proper due diligence and we
present the above as helpful guides for what questions to ask. Some additional key
questions to ask:


1. In our original Oceanica report, we demonstrated that the "Oceanica" deposit overlaps
and apparently conflicts with other offshore mineral concessions. Has OMEX resolved
these serious conflicts or explained them to investors?


Source - More details at omextruth.com in Oceanica report on Innophos overlapping
concession


2. In addition to the overlapping mineral concessions, our previous report explained there
also seems to be overlapping tourism, fishing and seafloor rights as well. Has OMEX and
Oceanica received written authorization from the owners of these conflicting concessions?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2303945-is-oceanicas-eia-deliberately-not-being-filed-while-trying-to-raise-capital 11/21


Has OMEX received written proof from the 8-10 Mexican regulatory bodies involved? How
about the countless fishing co-operatives who have already indicated they are opposed
and plan to fight this project?


a. Fishing opposition appears to be the key reason a Namibian phosphate project was
shot down.


b. Has OMEX disclosed to Oceanica investors the position of the local SEMARNAT office
that has jurisdiction over this project? If not, why have Oceanica investors not contacted
this SEMARNAT office directly? Baja is an incredible place with great weather and I would
encourage any Oceanica investors to visit the SEMARNAT office in La Paz and check in
with some of the fishing co-ops in Ulloa bay to get an honest view of the insurmountable
opposition this project faces.


c. The local community appears to be aware and vehemently opposed to "Oceanica" (see
signature #219) with plans to strongly fight it, why has this not been openly disclosed by
OMEX to investors?


d. Why has OMEX still not addressed the issue of who the true directors are of DNA, Ltd.,
Oceanica's partner based in Panama? Claims of required local directors for "regulatory
purposes" are easily discredited with a Google search as Panama corporations do not
require local directors as Bermuda does, in contrast for example.


What might a Capital Raise for Oceanica Look like?


Firstly, we do commend OMEX on its cleverness in continuing to avoid the SEC and its
securities registration requirements for capital raises. OMEX has been uniquely clever in
our experience at using controlled or influenced private companies (Neptune: the source
of nearly all 2012 OMEX revenue, and Oceanica more recently) to raise money using
unregistered securities to ultimately pay compensation and expenses at the parent
company.


We believe a raise here would look like a funnel: As MAKO found out, they paid $27.5mm
for pieces of paper that gives them ownership in a company with $400k cash (according to
last CC) and $10mm of liabilities to OMEX, which also controls the company. OMEX has
clearly stated on their last conference call in May that they intend to repay the $10mm
owed to OMEX corporate once Oceanica raises capital. In other words, this transaction
would potentially accomplish nothing more than funneling money to OMEX corporate and
would likely ultimately be completely worthless to Oceanica shareholders despite any
"seniority" the unregistered paper may be labeled with

Comments (29)


With cash balances dwindling towards zero and what we see as virtually zero chance to
survive Q3 without an equity raise, expect increasingly promotional and desperate press
releases from OMEX. Now is the time to truly start asking questions and demanding
transparency from OMEX after months of empty promises to file the EIA and expose the
true details of this Oceanica project: How is it any different than those recycled in the past
that ended in total wipeout for investors?

Tiger,


I see your point,but I don't care to spend the thousands of dollars and extended time to get my own consultants.
Actually, Green River Asset Management has done a pretty good job in his rebuttals of Meson's opinions about
Oceanica and other opinion pieces that Meson has written. At least, he has provided due counterpoints for all to
consider.


Also, Meson has calculatedly dismissed the Army gold shipment that was reported to be on the Central America. That
issue, I HAVE been looking into more thoroughly and it is now my belief that based on information in the national
archives, that odyssey will vet that historical information that has been found in the archives and declassified. I expect
they will find and bring up 600 gold bars, which weigh 50 pounds each with approx dimensions of 12" x 5" x 4" each. I
have researched the declassification letter which Meson has dismissed and also the signer (Robert Fetchman) who
was a government employee at the CMH. Now, Meson discredited everything about the army gold, but at the very
least, their research is no better than mine. It comes down to "do you believe (as Meson" would have believe) that
there was a massive conspiracy to fabricate the information about the secret army gold which is in the national
archives. It is my belief (based on my background as a military contractor) that it is highly unlikely that all this
information was fabricated. But it still all comes down to what you believe, and what OMEX finds (or doesn't find) on
the site.


At this point, Oceanica and the potential phosphate business is not as important right now as the CA recovery effort.
As for raising capital, no I did not mean an equity offering/stock dilution. I mean private or public equity capital
(obviously with terms but nor stock dilution) which can include private investors, other banks (not just fifth third),
capital investment groups, and who knows, maybe a shark or two from shark tank. There is alot of money floating
around out there that OMEX can tap until they work monetization efforts.


Many of us are just retail investors and do not have an extensive amount of time to research every informational
article about a stock that we own. We have to be selective. So short answer to your question is no, I don't have
specific answers to rebut Mesons opinions, but in the end, Oceanica is not a really important asset right now, and
OMEX might simply find a buyer (maybe sponsored by the government of Mexico), rather than try to set it up and run
it themselves.

Well ok, but frankly you are somewhat agreeing with meson.


" As for raising capital, no I did not mean an equity offering/stock dilution. I mean private or public equity
capital (obviously with terms but nor stock dilution) which can include private investors, other banks (not just
fifth third), capital investment groups, and who knows, maybe a shark or two from shark tank."


No matter where the money comes from private investors, capital investment groups, etc that still means
dilution pure and simple. Equity is equity. No other bank is going to "lend" any money to effectively treasure
hunters, if for no other reason the FDIC would have a heart attack. Fifth Third has collateral that can not be
used twice. So the reality is Morris you are really agreeing with Morris they need more cash which really
mans equity at this point and dilution.

I can understand that BUT it does NOT give me any encouragement in terms of going long OMEX. Morris
clearly has put more time and money and research in this and in my book doing the hard work usually pays
off.

"No matter where the money comes from private investors, capital investment groups, etc that still means
dilution pure and simple."


Dilution of future profits for sure but not necessarily equity. Here's just one example

That said, if Odyssey intends, as stated, to perform another commodity salvage this year they will have to
raise funds. If it is the markets, so be it.

Yes everyone has internet now, but how many ship workers in Mexico are going to immediately send off an
email to some short of an American stock? I can see them checking out the world Cup but firing off emails to
Meson Capital is very bizarre I find it strange timing that right after you publish, you receive "emails" from
unpaid workers in Mexico, as if they care about some notifying short about this.


So let me ask again, how many of these emails did you get, 2, 20?


And why are you afraid to not identify your "consultants"?

Can you post redacted versions of the emails? Would definitely support your views re OMEX's (lack of)
liquidity.

I have a few things to add here, with some small experience with Semanart:


First, I submitted plans for move 12 cacti plants from a piece of dirt I was going to build on. That took 8 months to get
approval.


Second, during the end of last year, I had a FC waiting to be issued for another piece of land that took 1.5 years.
Why? Because the government ran out of money and didn't pay anyone. Additionally prior to running out of wage
money, they shut down the AC system, no electricity for a while, etc.


Also during that period, I couldn't get my real estate bill. Here, if you pay your 2014 RE tax in advance they give you a
30% discount. I tried 4 times but the computer system was down and in the interim, I sold the property. Then in May
on one of the pieces of land that I had not paid the RE bill, the sale went through. So no one paid the RE tax since
they wouldn't have allowed the sale to complete with an overdue RE bill. No computers, no RE bills, no Fide
Commissos, wrong billing, etc


Hey, it's Mexico.


I wouldn't put much emotion or credibility in any of it. It means nothing.

By the way court cases down here take 4-5 years so in essence there is no suing to speak of.

" He has a lot of data, you have none" He has unnamed consultant "sources" from a failed project 35 yrs ago. 
Regarding the recovered gold, please see the article by Green River Asset- they have done real, true due diligence
regarding the recovered and potential recovery with the SS CA. 
The author haphazardly mentions SEMARNAT, while deliberately not providing SEMARNAT's stand regarding the
project, nor does he mention with whom he spoke, which is most likely, NOONE.

He mentions the failed PhosMex: they never analyzed cores like Oceanica has with an independent lab, so...apples
vs zebras.


The author throws out scary terms and half truths or outright falsehoods. Most readers don't have the time, bandwith
or energy to analyze every single fallacy in the article.


And regarding sources of capital? No, not equity raise: try credit facilities. Again, please refer to Green River's article
on the SS CA.


And too much more to cover here. And, no, the EIA submission delay has nothing to do with a capital raise, as there
will be no Oceanica capital raise.


Not once, in the author's dozen or so negative articles on OMEX (a little creepy) does he ever mention he has
attempted to contact the company or its management.


Regarding Odyssey CEO's compensation: 66% is stock and options based, so with an after tax salary of $200K +/-,
there is hardly a lavish lifestyle to be had. Should it be less? Perhaps, but management's interests are aligned with
shareholders. Management will start having "lavish lifestyles" when shareholders do.


Etc etc etc

"And regarding sources of capital? No, not equity raise: try credit facilities."


 
There is no "credit facility" available to essentially treasure hunters, that is pure fantasy land, aint gonna
happen. The only way is to have an asset backing it and any asset worth backing either has a mortgage or is
already collateralized to Fifth Third.


As for his "lavish lifestyle", that was a total cheap shot on the part of Meson and frankly totally irrelevant.


I can see both sides to this arguement.

<<The only way is to have an asset backing it and any asset worth backing either has a mortgage or is

Rugby meant Fifth Third. Their credit line is I believe 10 million (they drew 4.8 on it already) and it can be
expanded as more comes up from the Central America. In other words, regardless of when they are
paid...and Meson's probably right about some delay......they can draw more capital using additional recovery
as collateral.


The full extent of the recovery remains a complete unknown right now. We do know the receiver, Ira Kane, is
cost conscious and Odyssey itself has said they will only keep working as long as it seems productive..and

they are still working the site. So the early results + the additional time are promising.


But the recovery inventory reports are sealed by the Norfolk court right now...thus the cone of silence.

I meant Fifth Third. Should have been clearer.

" it can be expanded as more comes up from the Central America"


Yes exactly, and there was not enough to make it economically worthwhile to take it off the ship, hence no
new credit available, period.


If they had recovered $5 million worth of gold they would have taken it off the ship and you would have seen a
big Press Release, nada. Then they could have expanded their credit.


"But the recovery inventory reports are sealed by the Norfolk court right now...thus the cone of silence."


Here is what we do know unless OMEX is lying to a judge, we know it can fit in the trunk of a car and was not
economically worthwhile to take off the ship. Spin it anyway you want, it is a not good at all.


12 Jul 2014, 11:12 AM


Papaoomowmow
You are the one spinning. The most obvious explanation of "economically warranted" is clearly explained
earlier in the letter......it makes no sense to tie up a team of people to unload a few small containers. They
also point out the cargo is both secure and fully insured. In the last CC Q and A session Gordon said
Odyssey was forced to expand their 25 million cargo insurance. They wouldn't have done so unless the value
of the cargo at the time exceeded 25 million.


As for size, as so many (including me) have explained, it means next to nothing.


The particular double eagles they are looking for....due to rarity.... are worth a great deal and take up very little
space. They refer to the present cargo as artifacts...do they count double eagles and nuggets as "artifacts"? I
don't know. If they do, a few small containers could be worth many (insured) millions.


Still they have begun work on a huge amount of timber that has collapsed upon itself. A month without much
arriving on the deck is very possible...these salvages are incredibly tedious "a piece at a time" work. Many
have described it as "lumpy'...nothing one day...bounty the next. Most of the days they spent on the
Gairsoppa brought up very little if anything. Then they finally found the silver....


Do you have any good explanation for the tractor trailer they mentioned or do you simply choose to ignore
that?

My main worry about the stock is not Morris' hilarious prediction of a bankruptcy filing on Wednesday, it's
"what does Odyssey do next?"


You are believing Morris' cash burn numbers when you assume they would expand their borrowing if they
could. As for a press release....maybe so...you might be right......though I expect we'll see something Monday
morning.


What is onboard at the moment remains an unknown to me. What may hit the surface a month from now an
unknown also.


12 Jul 2014, 01:35 PM


tigersfirtwhoe
".it makes no sense to tie up a team of people to unload a few small containers."


Ehh, that is the entire point, yes it WOULD make sense to unload a few small cases IF they were worth
millions, clearly they are not. If they were full of gold, it would make sense to get an armored car and take
them for safe keeping as opposed to keeping them on the boat, ie as they say ECONOMICALLY
WORTHWHILE.


There is NO WAY they are safer on board the ship than they would be taken off in an armored car and put
into safe custody, that cost would be about $5 grand at the most. It would be reckless and irresponsible of
them to keep them on board if in fact they were worth a great deal of money. Anyone that denies that is a fool
or kidding themselves.


AS for the insurance, if I were Meson i might suggest they increased it to further hype the story and naive
retail investors believe it.


So you can say what remain onboard is a mystery to you, fine, so be it. Here are the only two "facts" we know
if the letter is to be believed


1) small enough to fit in the trunk of a car 
2) not "economically worthwhile" to takeoff the ship


Ignore reality all you want.


As for Morris predicting BK July 16th I dont understand where he gets that from, OMEX can stretch this out
for a few weeks if not months but directionally (bankruptcy or serious dilution) he is correct, OMEX needs
some sort of miracle and soon.

All,


I want thank everyone for their comments and insights on OMEX. Whether you're long or short, it doesn't matter. The
long thesis and short thesis are market forces that every stock has to weather. It's how the market works and it keeps
the market honest (hopefully). What is really important is that you do your own due diligence. I have done my own,
and with a great deal of help from Green River, who deserves a lot of credit. But Meson deserves credit too for

showing us the opposite thesis. All this information helps us to determine if we want to invest in OMEX, how we want
to invest in OMEX and what investment strategy we should employ. Ultimately, one camp is going to be right and the
other camp is going to be wrong. At the end of the day, I still find the kind of work that OMEX does exciting,
fascinating and many times, historically significant. At this point in time, Odyssey is going to soon complete the
important CA project. The cards are on the table and they will all be flipped soon. Good luck to all. I plan to go dark for
a while until the success of the CA project becomes more clear. Shipbuilder1 signing off.

Thanks for your objective comments, shipbuilder. Like you, I await the results of the CA project with great anticipation.
And your use of the phrase 'go dark' is classy because of the release last year of the book "Going Dark" by James W.

Well someone asked me to give them more detail on a blurb I posted on one of the OMEX articles, about underwater
mining. I searched the last 3 posts and couldn't come up with the comment so I'm just going to post the info I dug up
again here:


I live in Cabo San Lucas which is a 2 hour car drive from La Paz, the capital of Baja California and the location of
SEMANART. Here's the post I gleaned from the local English newspaper down here (I hope the one asking reads
this).


" Phosphate Mining Approved. Mexico's energy secretary has approved a project for underwater phosphate mining.
Phosphate is a salt....," (here, some educational info on phosphates, their use, etc)...."The underwater mine would be
located in San Juanico, a Pacific coast fishing village in Comondu, better known as Scorpion Bay, north of Loreto and
6 hours from Cabo."


Not sure if this has anything to do with Oceanica but it does show that one can be authorized to dig underwater for
phosphate in Mexico and the government approves it.....at least on this project.
