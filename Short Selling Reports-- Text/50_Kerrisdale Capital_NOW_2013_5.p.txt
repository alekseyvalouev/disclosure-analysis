ServiceNow: Beating Revenues By $4m Does Not Negate
Overvaluation Concerns
Jan. 31, 2013 8:30 AM ET15 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) announced fourth quarter 2012 results yesterday and we'll
readily admit that the headline numbers appeared strong. NOW grew quarterly revenues
by 17% sequentially and the company guided to revenue of $81.5m - $82.5m for Q1 2013
and gave full year revenue guidance of $387m - $389m. Billings, a measure indicative of
sales momentum, grew to $97.6m from $81.2m in Q3 2012. We congratulate the NOW
team on a good quarter (Q4 press release, 2012 Q3).


But even at these growth rates, NOW's stock is absurdly overvalued. Beating revenues by
$4m doesn't justify the company's 19x revenue multiple. The 60% YoY growth implied in
2013 is much lower than the 90% that NOW grew in 2012. And while NOW's Help Desk
product appears to be selling well, investors still have little insight on how much revenue is
generated from the Discovery and Runbook Automation tools. Since the market size of the
Help Desk is only $1.5bn, according to Gartner, NOW must prove to investors that it can
generate real revenue in other product segments. ServiceNow's Platform product, which
many analysts think could provide the largest eventual end-market, is just now launching
as a separately priced product. While this Platform product will be for sale for the vast
majority of this year, NOW doesn't expect Platform sales to be consequential until 2014
onwards.


Without meaningful revenue from Discovery, Runbook Automation, Platform, or other non-
Help Desk products, NOW could quickly saturate its share of the 50% of the $1.5bn Help
Desk market that Gartner expects to convert to SaaS. Future year-over-year revenue
growth will be especially difficult since, due to legacy contracts and the enormous cost of
switching vendors, only a small percentage of the market opportunity can be captured in
any single year. At its current exorbitant price of 12x 2013E revenue, NOW investors are
placing too much trust in unproven revenue streams and too little scrutiny in the challenge
of future growth.

NOW's market capitalization currently approaches $5bn, an absurdly high figure relative to
the $400m of revenue that NOW hopes to collect in 2014. Besides, profitability continues
to be nil. To hit its revenue figures, NOW may have to aggressively expand its headcount,
adding costs to an already unprofitable business. On its fourth quarter call, NOW
remarked that it doesn't expect to be profitable in the first half of 2013 and that it might
reach profitability in the second half of 2013 on a non-GAAP basis (non-GAAP excludes
stock-based compensation expense). While stock-based compensation isn't a cash
expense, it does have an immediately dilutive effect on NOW's current shareholders. We
applaud NOW's CFO, Michael Scarpelli, for taking time during the call to address the
misunderstanding around ServiceNow's share count. Mr. Scarpelli stated that, "At
December 31st, we had approximately 164 million diluted shares outstanding, consisting
of approximately 126.4 shares outstanding, 13.1m vested and 23.0 unvested options
outstanding, and 1.5m RSUs" (NOW Q4 2012 Call). Using the treasury method to net out
the proceeds from future option exercises, this implies a diluted share count of 158.3 at
NOW's current share price. As we've previously pointed out, numerous financial
databases and many Wall Street analysts continue to overlook NOW's highly dilutive
option pool for valuation purposes.


Moving back to NOW's quarterly results, sequential Billings and Revenue growth
increased to 20% and 17%, respectively, for the quarter. While we expect NOW to utilize
an under-promise/over-deliver guidance cadence, the Q1 2013 revenue guidance of only
$82m/9% sequential growth should be uninspiring to most.

Looking more closely at NOW's financials, we noticed that Professional Services revenue
increased by 35% in Q4 versus only 14% sequential growth in Subscription Revenue.
ServiceNow expects 2013 revenue of $387m - $392m composed of $327m - $329m in
Subscription revenue and $60m - $63m in Professional Services. Last year's Professional
Services revenue was only $39.2m, implying 57% YoY growth from the midpoint of
guidance. Since Professional Services revenue is relatively one-time in nature, it deserves
a lower valuation multiple than the recurring Subscription revenue. As the Professional
Services segment becomes a larger percentage of the overall revenue pie, we'd expect
analysts to begin to notice and adjust their valuation techniques accordingly.


NOW's largest competitor in the Help Desk vertical, BMC (NASDAQ:BMC), reported its
own set of financial results on Monday, January 28th. Though BMC printed weak numbers
overall, management commentary indicated that BMC sees increasing strength in its
Remedy (On-premise) and RemedyForce (SAAS) products. BMC's SaaS customer base
grew from 475 on September 31st to 550 at year-end (BMC FQ3 2012 Call). BMC's 16%
sequential SaaS growth in the fourth quarter was higher than the 12% growth in NOW's
customer base over the same period.

Beyond these fundamental headwinds, lock-up expirations unfold over the next few
weeks. This Friday (tomorrow), 42.7m shares will be available for sale by NOW's founders
and venture capital investors. According to Bloomberg, NOW's current float (the shares
traded on the public markets) is only 36.3m, meaning that the float could more than
double as these shares are sold on the public markets. This lock-up expiration will be
compounded by another one on February 13th. On that date, 47.5m shares will be
available for sale, which cumulatively adds 90.2m shares into the potential float.


ServiceNow is a stock where expectations have gotten ahead of reality. In order for any
discounted cash flow or takeover analysis to justify NOW's current share price, NOW
needs to continue its 2012 growth rate even as it saturates the Help Desk market. We just
don't see this happening. Once sequential growth in NOW's Help Desk market begins to
slow, which it invariably must given a limited market size and BMC's increased efforts,
scrutiny of NOW's ancillary product lines will quickly take center stage. We remain
confident that our short thesis will play out over time.

A solid analysis.


I am glad to see the CFO clarify just how enormous the fully diluted market cap of this firm really is.

Excellent, thorough work; many thanks for sharing. What do you make of the following comments by Mr Slootman in
the call:


"Our renewal rate during the quarter was close to 98% continuing a three-year trend of quarterly renewal rates at or
above 95%. We also saw a significant contribution from upsells during the quarter and full-year 2012, representing

How do you reconcile these stats with all the negative reviews from your independent checks and on

Author’s reply »  Because NOW grew so quickly in the past, the renewal numbers can be deceiving. Since
we know that the average contract is 30 months long and NOW's subscription revenues were about
$10m/quarter 30 months ago, we can back into a worst case renewal rate. With $63m of subscription revenue
in Q4, even if all of the $10m of subscription revenue that was for renewal failed to do so, the renewal rate
would still be 84%. NOW's 98% is a strong figure for the quarter but I don't think we can read too much into it
given the time lag involved in the calculation.


Upsells are just part of the business model. A customer will typically add new seats as the technology proves
viability over time, the same as they would for any other SaaS software.

"According to Bloomberg, $NOW's current float (the shares traded on the public markets) is only 36.3M"


According to finviz.com, the current float is 113M (3x Bloomberg's).


Somebody is way wrong here.

The float is only around 40 million.


The float will be bigger soon as within 30 days some 80 million shares will be available for sale.


How many will be sold? I don't know.

17% growth between sequential quarters is outrageous. That is strong growth.


The company may be overvalued but I fail to seee the catalyst which is going to lead to a dramatically lower valuation.


The fact is that investors love growth and that it's darned hard to find to find these days so those companies that can
deliver it and convince analysts they will continue to are very richly valued.

The numbers don't lie - a 98% renewal rating speaks volumes about the solution. With that kind of renewal rate it's
only a matter of time before revenue is in the billions. This stock is a hold at the very least. Also, in the chart you
provided, we can see that BMC's growth percentage of customers is quickly decreasing and ServiceNow's is
increasing - BMC has the bigger sales force too.

Do you have a guess about when sales growth might slow for NOW?


The market tends to give very irrational valuations to any stock that grows its top line, seemingly giving a pass on
earnings or cash flow. Look at CRM, N, or AMZN, all stories that continue to assign completely insane 1990s style
valuations based on unprofitable top line growth.

Author’s reply »  Pone, that's a great question. It's revealing in and of itself that investors/analysts are
beginning to contemplate a time when growth slows, the clock strikes midnight, and NOW's loses its
Cinderella valuation.


Wall Street expects NOW to grow revenue from $244m in 2012 to $390m in 2013, suggesting $145m of
incremental revenue growth this year. Let's assume that the Help Desk market is $2bn in size. Contracts are
up for renewal every 3 years and Gartner data shows that 50% of the market want to move to cloud. That
implies that $2bn * 33% * 50% = $330m of incremental revenue is available each year. BMC has claims it has
a 60% win-rate vs. its largest SaaS competitor (i.e. NOW). If we also assume that Cherwell, SAManage, HP,
and CA each have just a 33% win-rate vs NOW, that leaves NOW with 40% * 66% = 26% of the market. This
implies that NOW can add 26% * $330m = $86m of revenue each year. Compare that to the $145m of growth
expected by that market and you have a substantial gap that can only be filled by ancillary products, each of
which are priced at about 1/10 the cost of the Help desk. Unlike the market, we don't believe this is a large
enough revenue opportunity for NOW to grow into its valuation. The growth hurdle becomes even higher in
2014, when Wall Street predicts $174m of incremental growth ($390m to $564m).


All of this also assumes that NOW can roll-over existing contracts that come up for renewal, which we
estimate is ~$65m this year (est. 2010 revenue). This is almost twice that of the ~$35m of contracts (est.
2009 revenue) that were up for renewal in 2012. As an aside, it is much easier to post a 90% renewal rate
when only $35m of NOW's $240m was up for renewal in 2012. As more and more contracts come due
relative to incremental revenue, NOW's renewal rate should correspondingly fall. We believe this might take
investors by surprise.


This is just one way to think about. We hope it helps.

You have a strong point that they are near saturation of the market opportunity and growth will flatten quickly.
The key is to know when is the quarter that sales growth slowdown will show up in reported numbers. If you
could time that it would be a strong short.

you've gone quiet on this one. can we please get your updated thoughts? the insider selling followed by strong results
is really surprising. it looked like they could have been stretching for numbers in 4q (looking at AR and some other
areas) and was looking for a continuation in 1Q, but instead they crushed it. are you done and out?

Shorting a company growing +60% y/y with < $100M quarterly sales run rate in a rising market because the valuation
is high but no obvious catalyst to derail the beat and raise train has got to be the stupidest trade. Sure, Kerrisdale may
be right eventually but their prime broker probably bought out their short position way before that happens

Author’s reply »  NOW remains one of our highest conviction short ideas. While the sellside interpreted Q2 2013
results as an unmitigated positive, we saw many signs of stress:


- ServiceNow's CEO, Frank Slootman, was again forced to admit that PaaS is not the $20bn+ market opportunity that
many believe it to be. Slootman stated, "The customers have been paying for platform all along, right...Are we trying
to go compete against pure play vendors in that space? Not really." The sellside continues to reference this
"untapped" market opportunity to justify their valuation models. But we think the most honest of the group will be
forced to revise their thesis.  
- The Revenue and Billings 'beat' was driven by $5m of one-time revenue for the Knowledge conference. This was a
significant jump from $2m in Knowledge revenue last year, an increase that the analysts hadn't built into their models.
The Billings 'beat' was also aided by an increase in "multi-year" contracts, which grew to 12% of contract value versus
7% in the quarter prior. These multi-year deals provide worse economics to NOW as customers receive a heavily
discounted price to pay several years upfront. But NOW continues to offer them partly because it makes the Billings
numbers look stronger. 
- Excluding the effect of these two one-off items, NOW may have actually missed the Street's expectations. 
- NOW's CFO, Michael Scarpelli, guided towards flat sequential billings in Q3. If NOW is no longer growing quarter-to-
quarter, how can one justify a 20x+ LTM revenue multiple? 
- Salesforce productivity is quickly deteriorating. It cost NOW $52.3m to acquire just 138 new customers in the

quarter. Excluding $8.3m of one-time costs associated with the Knowledge conference, this translates to $309,000 of
expense per new customer. Compare this to $212,000 per customer in Q2 2013. Based on these numbers, the
business is requiring more bodies, and higher costs, just to maintain its current growth trajectory.


Valuation still matters. At $43/share, ServiceNow has a $7.2bn market capitalization ($6.9m EV) versus a paltry
$405-$410m of expected 2013 revenue. This translates to a 17x revenue multiple, something previously only seen in
Series-A VC rounds for companies like Twitter and Facebook. But unlike some of the other open-ended growth stories
that are punishing short sellers in the current bull market, NOW's end-market is finite. The more levers that NOW pulls
to hit its numbers (multi-year discounts, higher staffing costs, one-time revenue streams), the closer the story is to
unwinding.

Lots of upgrades recently but don't be deterred. The valuations of IPOs done in the last couple of years is simply
astounding. Despite huge valuations for companies of dubious quality, virtually all are rated 'buys' by the major
brokerage houses. Why is this? I suspect there are many, many conversations like this happening these days...


Head of Investment Banking (we'll call him Tim): Fixed income is pretty difficult these days. And capital intensive. We
really need to be doing more in equities. Specifically IPOs.


Head of Equity 'Research' (let's call him Mike): Despite the Chinese wall between us, I hear you.


CEO of company (Ralph): We are all part of a team. And the way bonuses are going to be calculated is based on the
combined performance of the Equity Research and Investment banking team.


Tim: I'm going to need you to go through and rank everything IPO'd in the past three years a 'BUY' or 'STRONG BUY'.
We need to get a piece of the secondaries. We need to get a piece of the billions in management stock sales. We
need to get more M&A business. And most importantly, we need to show prospective IPOs that we are team players.
On that note, be sure to co-ordinate with insiders when you enthusiastic pieces are coming out so they can sell into
strength.


Mike: Gotcha. We will use whatever metrics the companies give us to explain their success. We will use revenue, or
adjusted EBITDA or eyeballs or clicks or whatever they want. We'll send our 'research' your way before we publish.


Ralph: Good work guys. December is coming and I think you both are going to be very, very happy.
