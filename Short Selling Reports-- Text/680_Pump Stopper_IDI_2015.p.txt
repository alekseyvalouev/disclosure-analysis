IDI: Strong Sell On Fraud Lawsuits, Bankruptcy And Technology
Failure, -92.4% Downside

by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


Frost mixed up with “the wrong crowd” as Barry Honig and Michael Brauser have
spun a tiny struggling debt collections business, acquired with $5.7m cash, into
temporarily inflated ~$200m shell.


Chairman Brauser's biography has “interesting” omissions including bankruptcy,
wipeout, and fraud lawsuits, with Equifax suing him alleging “fraudulent
misrepresentations” with Softbank lawsuit alleging "various frauds".


IDI stock temporarily inflated from extensive yahoo message board stock-pumping
scheme, touting IDI across dozens of boards with interconnected aliases, similar to
halted and bankrupt FNRG.


IDI’s Transunion lawsuit could mean instant $0 for stock as IDI future apparently
based on IP they don’t own, which Transunion acquired when IDI CSO Poulsen's
last company went bankrupt.


Confluence of temporary factors above have inflated IDI stock to the obviously
unsustainable valuation of ~$200m or >40x revenue, creating imminent -92.4%
downside in "best case" scenario.


I believe Idi Inc. (IDI) is another worthless Brauser and Honig wipeout. This famous
wipeout team has joined forces to temporarily resuscitate a fraud ridden shell with a tiny
debt collections firm, acquired with $5.7m cash payment, to the unsustainable valuation of
$200m or >40x revenue. In what appears a desperate attempt to salvage his failed fraud
shell, Frost has clearly gotten involved with the "wrong crowd" and regrettably stained his
reputation through association with what I believe is one of the worst penny stock wipeout
teams in America.


Brauser's biography conveniently "forgets" to include a long track record of fraud lawsuits,
bankruptcy and shareholder wipeouts. While touting involvement in Naviant, Brauser
neglects to mention he was apparently sued by data fusion giant Equifax (NYSE:EFX) for

allegations including "fictitious receivables" and by Softbank for "various frauds" with
apparent multimillion dollar payments to Equifax. Shockingly, the Naviant debacle barely
scratches the surface and Barry Honig's background looks even worse.

IDI faces an insurmountable lawsuit while desperate for cash and with a $160m equity
shelf filed IDI stock is now "coincidentally" being pumped with an apparent sketchy online
Yahoo message board stock promotion campaign, similar to halted and bankrupt
Forcefield Energy (OTC:FNRG) where the chairman was arrested for fraud.


IDI is eerily similar to the BVSN, VNRG, USEL, IZEA and DRNE wipeouts these people
oversaw, With a huge amount of IDI shares becoming unlocked soon, a $160m shelf filed
for IDI stock sales and an abusive $31m+ virtually free rsu payment to Brauser and Honig,
IDI is at imminent risk of total wipeout.


It's not often you get to short a cash burning penny stock wipeout team with a declining,
$5.7m cash acquisition trading at >40x revenue for <7% cost to borrow. I recommend you
pour yourself a tall glass of Gilby's vodka and sit down as what you read will be
shocking….


"Interactive Data" A Tiny, Struggling Debt Collections Business With $0 R&D
Spending, Bought With $5.7m Cash


Now that IDI has officially announced they are winding down the China billboard business
with huge write offs, 100% of IDI's ongoing business will be "Interactive Data, LLC". I think
IDI investors are confused and don't understand what this business actually is.


"Interactive Data, LLC" is the business IDI is pinning their "data fusion!" hype-story on,
which IDI just acquired last year with a $5.7m cash payment.


Strip away the hype, we see "Interactive Data, LLC" is a tiny firm with just 9 full time
employees founded in 2001. Based in Georgia, Interactive Data seems focused on
providing contact information verification to the debt collection business. When a debt
collector calls a defaulted creditor, they are not allowed to harass people with similar

names and face severe lawsuits if they make that mistake. Therefore, debt collections
agencies pay tiny amounts for some very basic offerings which allow them to be sure they
are tracking down the correct person.


(picture credit)


The contact verification business is a brutally competitive business where, over the years,
Interactive Data finds itself facing larger, superior competitors with cheaper, better
products and dominant sales teams. Due to this, Interactive Data has struggled and been
apparently forced to hire outside sales consultants and, based on their transactional
pricing model, chase after the smallest and least profitable customers in the industry.
Furthermore, I believe Interactive Data isn't even a real technology company anyway
because this tiny business seems to have been built largely by acquisition with no R&D in
2012, 2013 and apparently 2014 as well.


We can see Interactive Data's financial struggling below in the only clear Interactive Data
financials I could find, available here.


(picture credit IDI inc filings)


We can see Interactive Data's 2014 revenue declined -7% versus last year while gross
profit fell -18.5%. Also interesting: Interactive Data claims to have spent zero on R&D in
most of 2014, 2013 and 2012 and even with this expense at $0 and without public
company expenses or any of the other SG&A Brauser/Honig/etc are layering on this tiny
failure, it only generated a ~$474k in profit, which also declined -34.8% from the previous
year.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3342225-idi-strong-sell-on-fraud-lawsuits-bankruptcy-and-technology-failure-minus-92_4-percent-downside 4/48


Considering IDI has already opened multiple branches in FL and WA with 8+ engineers
and the typical >$400k of annual cash cost just to be a public company, I estimate IDI's
cash burn in the future will be at least -$2m per quarter. Perhaps this is why none of IDI
inc's press releases include the financials of this tiny struggling "business" they just
acquired? Clearly the above "business" is worth nothing vaguely close to IDI's current
~$200m market cap. Recall that there is nothing else here. The only aspect to IDI's
business is this tiny, marginally profitable and extremely competitive company. That's it.


So what are Brauser and Honig doing with a fraud ridden shell and this tiny struggling debt
collection firm? Let us dig deeper to understand what is truly going on here….


Brauser's "Selective" Disclosures = Fraud Lawsuits, Bankruptcy and Wipeout


As a reminder, Michael Brauser, Barry Honig and their investment vehicle Marlin are
clearly the financial architects of IDI to me and I don't see how IDI would even exist
without them.


Michael Brauser: History of Fraud Lawsuits, Bankruptcy and Wipeout


Picture credit IDI inc


Brauser seems to "selectively" tout his background, picking and choosing certain
companies while failing to transparently disclose lawsuits around his involvement with
other companies. A large number of these undisclosed companies wiped out big piles of
retail shareholders.


Naviant = Fraud Allegations

5/22/2018 IDI: Strong Sell On Fraud Lawsuits, Bankruptcy And Technology Failure, -92.4% Downside - Fluent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLNT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3342225-idi-strong-sell-on-fraud-lawsuits-bankruptcy-and-technology-failure-minus-92_4-percent-downside 5/48


For instance, Brauser touts his "Naviant" track record sale with Equifax in his biography.
What seems to have been forgotten though is he was apparently sued by Equifax for fraud
allegations over that transaction and apparently saw millions of dollars go to Equifax as a
result. This amazing lawsuit alleges Brauser "participated in the fraudulent creation of
fictitious receivables and further participated in accounting overstatments that disguised
Naviant's true financial condition" going on to allege further:


"maintained one set of book for Naviant that was more accurate and complete and
another that omitted the low-priced e-mail transaction, which Naviant provided to
Equifax and it's accountants during merger negotiations."


Shareholder Softbank also apparently sued, claiming


"Defendant Michael Brauser had been "intimately involved in carrying out various
frauds at Naviant and covering up their misdeeds through threats and intimidation."
Softbank also claims that Defendant Michael Brauser represented to Softbank that
he was 'judgment proof' as a result of transferring away all of his personal assets,
with the exception of his Bentley automobile and personal computer"


While the Equifax fraud allegations seem to have resulted in big cash payments it's not
clear to me how the Softbank suit ended. Unfortunately though it appears this Naviant
mess is just the tip of the iceberg…


Biozone: "this is not even investment - it is stealing"


Brauser was again sued (with Honig, etc) in a case involving Biozone Pharmaceutical
including (emphasis mine):


"an illegal scheme by a group of predatory investors utilizing facially despicable
methods"


And goes on to explain that, in addition to allegations involving violations of federal
securities laws:

"this group of investors misled Plaintiff Fisher through an investment scheme
designed to divest Plaintiff of all the economic rights and goodwill be had built
through his company over the course of the previous 22 years"


"the defendants (Brauser, Honig, etc) immediate financial motivation in taking a
legitimate economic contributor is to turn it into an investment vehicle in which they
will pump up the stock price, and then proceed to sell off the shares, without regard
to the well being of the business."


"violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act for engaging in a
pattern of similar behavior against other companies."


This lawsuit is remarkable, and I strongly encourage you read it. This case seems to have
also been shuffled around so it's not clear what the ultimate resolution was for poor Daniel
Fisher. However with all the Honig, Brauser, etc lawsuits, I would strongly recommend
everyone read all the legal background documents to make sure you truly understand
what you are getting yourself into with these people.


Unsurprisingly, Biozone seems to have been a wipeout for original investors as the stock
imploded -80.62% over the time frame below and was sued for "breach of fiduciary duty"
after basically all of Biozone's important assets were transferred to another Honig/Brauser
company. I remind you that Frost was also somehow convinced to invest in this mess too.


The List Goes On: Even MOAR Alleged "Misrepresentations" and Bankruptcy


Brauser was allegedly sued again 1/30/2009 for fraud in Kast vs. The Tube Media Corp
(09-06285) a publicly traded company that apparently also failed, was delisted and seems
to have ceased operations. Allegations included "filing materially false and misleading
financial reports, and intentionally making misrepresentations of material facts". Also not
discussed in Brauser's biography was the apparent bankruptcy of FL Telephone Co or that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3342225-idi-strong-sell-on-fraud-lawsuits-bankruptcy-and-technology-failure-minus-92_4-percent-downside 7/48


Brauser was allegedly sued in an adversary proceeding related to that bankruptcy. Murky
situations abound with further allegations of improper side deals and Brauser potentially
plotting to violate FL law through undisclosed $1m commission payments. Despite all
these red flags, retail investors seem to fall for the "Brauser and Honig Show!" over and
over again, as yet another lawsuit here against Brauser (as chairman of Sendtec) alleges
"violations of securities laws". While some of these lawsuits seem to have resulted in cash
payments like Equifax, other lawsuits seem to have eventually been dismissed or possibly
settled, so I recommend you read these legal documents yourself to gain the full picture.
Regardless though, investing with anyone who has repeatedly faced such serious
allegations clearly warrants extreme caution.


Furthermore, just because you invest in a company and own shares of equity does not
make you a "founder" as much as you'd like. If I own Coca Kola (NYSE:KO) stock for
years that doesn't mean I'm a "founder" and even if I sit in on four phone calls per year
with the board that obviously doesn't mean I "built the business!" either. Confused retail
stock investors like to tout "but he sold Interclick!" While ignoring the fact that being on the
board is a passive role merely requiring a few meetings a year, ICLK traded at $12.98
before it was eventually sold for $9. That means many shareholders took a severe loss
and the company was actually sold at a discount to where it had traded previously.


Interclick: "sometimes even when you win….you lose"


Brauser seems to love to tout that he was on the board of InterClick when it was sold to
Yahoo (YHOO).

As you see above though, before Yahoo stepped into salvage this mess, InterClick was
ALSO on its way to being another wipeout. Even with Yahoo buying the company at a
premium (and the deal apparently failing later on), the takeout price was still -30% from
where it had traded previously. So I see that even in the blind chance Brauser accidentally
doesn't wipe a company out or get sued with fraud allegations, in the biggest success of
his whole life, many shareholders STILL lost a substantial part of their investment.


For Brauser's more recent forays into stocks, as well as virtually everything he touches,
bad things seem to happen to retail investors…..


The Honig & Brauser "PlayBook": Frost's Name Thrown Around, Then Shareholders
Get Wiped Out


Unsophisticated retail investors seem to think Frost's name on a filing means an
investment is a sure thing, ignoring the fact that Frost is ~80 years old and has money in
dozens and dozens of investments. Unfortunately, it seems the financial contamination of
Honig and Brauser involvement more than overwhelms any limited positive benefit from a
claimed Frost connection. Best I can tell the end result is shareholder wipeout, lawsuits or
bankruptcy in almost every instance.


It seems to me Frost has gotten mixed up with the wrong guys, and while investing in a
company that only Frost is involved in may be worth considering, the moment Honig or
Brauser pop up I think you should basically just light your wallet on fire and get it over
with.


With so many people involved in the following wipeouts, the time-frames are messy. As a
result the % decline estimates and charts in this report are all my best estimate of the best
time frame to represent the impact of these people on the companies in question.


Aside from IDI inc where Tiger Media was already found to involve fraud, there are
countless examples of this team's wipeouts. Like VPCO where Frost name was again
touted with absurdly promotional articles while Brauser and Honig were also involved and
apparently Scott Frohman, who seems to have some past tie to Brauser's much-touted
Seisant (also with some very questionable stuff going on) was also involved. None of that
mattered though as Vapor Corp (NASDAQ:VPCO), and the 65%+ retail shareholder base,
have experienced a -93.43% disaster (so far).

And uSell.com which seems to have had Honig, Brauser with current IDI board members
Peter T. Benz and IDI director Daniel Brauser (uSell.com's CEO) all involved. Despite
positive SeekingAlpha articles and Frost's public involvement, it essentially went straight
to $0, falling -99.91% and wiping out anyone unfortunate enough to have invested.


Frost's name was again touted with promotional articles from curious authors about IZEA.
Barry Honig and Brauser were also involved it seems, and (with a ~40%+ retail
shareholders base) now sports a $23m market cap as OTC listed Izea, inc
(NASDAQ:IZEA), which has been a disaster for everyone over any time frame with -99.35
wipeout.

Or Vringo (VRNG) which had Frost, Brauser and Honig all involved but apparently
Honig/Brauser again offset even Frost's genius as the ~79% retail shareholder based
"enjoyed" a quick -84.87% decline with no recovery.


I believe these people have done this over and over again. How about Document Security
Systems (NYSEMKT:DSS), which I estimate has ~80% retail shareholders, who have also
"enjoyed" a quick -82.73% wipeout?

Frost to invest in (unfortunately) through MSLP in 2013. This seems to have gone to ~$0

Or perhaps Silver Horn Mining with Brauser, Honig and Frost all involved which then
seems to have become GWSTT and then TRKK but.... basically wiped everyone out on
the way to an $8m market cap with (another) swift -61% decline.


Drone aviation (OTCQB:DRNE) is another good and recent example where Frost's name
was touted, the notorious RedChip was then apparently paid hundreds of thousands of
trading shares and cash for their promotion along with current IDI board member Steven

Michael Brauser Parties With "Nelly", Retail Shareholders Get Wiped Out

As long-term readers of mine know, I am a huge Nelly fan. For those of you who don't click
the links in my articles, you should. That said though, I like oldies too. So n that note, I
would like to dedicate a song to the Honig-Brauser Gang.

Barry Honig: Lawsuits, Even More Wipeouts and "Curious" Promotional Stock
Articles


In case the pages of horrific red flags above are not enough to cause concern,
"coincidently" many Barry Honig names also seem to garner curiously promotional
SeekingAlpha articles before the stock eventually gets wiped out. As outlined in Bleecker
street's impressive piece of research, there are many questionable ties between Barry
Honig and promotional stock report authors.

Similar to Brauser, Honig has been named in lawsuits regarding everything from alleged
violations of securities laws to situations involving "unjust enrichment", alleged forgery and
a "brutal beating" involving professional boxer Briggs and Honig's Empire Sports. While
I'm not sure what confidential settlements, lawsuit losses or wins may have resulted, the
pattern here is clearly startling.


Don't Let This Happen To You


Strangely, Honig's boxing disaster Empire Sports seems to have ultimately became
Sagebrush Gold (NASDAQ:SAGE) on 6/1/2011? And then, after announcing involvement
of Dr. Phillip Frost, the company then changed name to Pershing Gold (NASDAQ:PGLC)
in March 2012 and has been a total disaster for shareholders. Since these guys got
involved, despite Frost involvement and lots of promotional SeekingAlpha articles by
authors who disclose zero PGLC stock ownership, Pershing Gold Declined -72.07%


Or this other Honig wipeout Spherix inc (NASDAQ:SPEX): -96.49% Decline

As you can see, investing in anything with Brauser or Honig involved, even when Frost is
named somewhere in the filings, is typically a total disaster for poor retail
share(bag)holders. It's not just Brauser and Honig though, IDI inc's CSO Ole Poulsen,
COO James Reilly and CEO Derek Dubner all seem to forget to include the fact that their
last company TLO went bankrupt and nearly wiped out shareholders completely.


There are countless other Honig/Brauser disasters and I am getting tired of going through
all their wipeouts. I think you get the point already, so in the interest of time I will pose one
serious question: of all the Brauser/Honig/Marlin stocks in the market today, how many
have market caps >$200m or generate >$2m in profit per year?


Given IDI true market cap is currently >$200m, this is a serious question.


If anyone can find a single current Brauser/Honig/Marlin stock with a $200m+ market cap
or one consistently generating >$2m per year of profit, I will video tape myself personally
singing you a song on YouTube. Not joking.


What's in IDI for Brauser and Honig?! 2.5m FREE IDI Shares Worth Over $31m!?


Now that you may understand what is truly going on here, let's look at how Honig and
Brauser get rich in this scheme and why I believe they are involved.


The most egregious part of this whole IDI debacle to me are the crazy and, what I view as
clearly abusive, contracts Honig and Brauser are mistreating IDI shareholders with via
their Marlin vehicle. For example, regardless of how much dilutive equity it may take, what
business is acquired or at what stock price, it seems to me Brauser/Honig/Marlin basically
get 2m+ IDI shares essentially for free with some offensively low hurdles and loose terms
set for their payday:

5/22/2018 IDI: Strong Sell On Fraud Lawsuits, Bankruptcy And Technology Failure, -92.4% Downside - Fluent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLNT) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3342225-idi-strong-sell-on-fraud-lawsuits-bankruptcy-and-technology-failure-minus-92_4-percent-downside 18/48


"The Marlin Consulting Agreement provides for equity compensation issued to Marlin
in the amount of 10,000,000 Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), of TBO, which shall
vest in four (4) equal, annual increments beginning October 13, 2015 and ending
October 13, 2018, provided that one of the Milestones (as hereinafter defined) has
been achieved on or before such date, and subject to Marlin Capital providing
services on each applicable vesting date. As used in the Marlin Consulting
Agreement, "Milestone" means: ((i)) TBO generating $15 million in revenues over
any 12 month period; or (ii) TBO generating $10 million in revenues over any 12
month period and generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (with all stock based compensation not included as an expense) for
such 12 month period. "


I would note there is a clear lack of any "per share" measurements and, shockingly,
dilutive stock compensation to insiders is specifically excluded from this whole mess. With
such low hurdles set for Honig/Brauser/Marlin to rich how can anyone view this is anything
other than a basically free, huge rsu payday to them?


Even more offensive to me, Michael Brauser has apparently already received 500k shares
of IDI stock rsu for what I view as basically nothing! I estimate this is worth >$1.25m today!


"On October 2, 2014, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 500,000
RSUs to two consultants. One of the consultants to receive 500,000 RSUs is
Michael Brauser,"


Even worse, it seems that part of this plan from the start was to get it all going with a ton
of cheap stock given to their group at what I view as unreasonably favorable terms:


"On December 4, 2014, TBO sold 12,360,000 shares of TBO Common Stock to
various investors at $0.50 per share on a "best efforts" basis for an aggregate of
$6,094,338 in net proceeds after deducting discounts and expenses"


Whatever associates of the Brauser and Honig gang may have participated in this insane
capital raise, they seem to me to have received $6.18m of IDI stock at split adjusted $2.50
per share right before a message board tout campaign started! What a coincidence! Now
with IDI at $12.50 per share they are sitting on HUGE gain in a company that was just
acquired with a $5.76m cash payment but now (temporarily) trades for a ~$200m
valuation!!

So while primarily retail shareholders in IDI get led to what I believe is a likely financial
wipeout, Brauser, Honig and Marlin are set to get a free payday of $30m!?! How is that
possibly seem fair?!


IDI Inc Partnered With "Palladium Capital Advisors, LLC": Named Defendant in
Madoff Lawsuit?!?


You can tell a lot about the quality of a stock or company by the quality of the investors it is
able to attract. "Real" businesses, that honestly have a bright future, have no problem
attracting high quality VC investors or other reputable financial partners while questionable
shells on their way to wipeout often struggle and are forced to take "bottom tier" money at
loan shark terms.


IDI inc lists "Palladium Capital Advisors" as a placement agent for TBO in 11/2014, who
received warrant for 28k shares at $2.50 for their help in addition to $70k in cash. A quick
Google on this curious financial partner apparently turns up a "Palladium Capital Advisors"
as a named defendant in a Madoff Ponzi Lawsuit as recipients of "stolen customer
property and other proceeds of the illegal scheme". Unless this is just a name
coincidence, I am alarmed

It is not clear to me what happened here as the lawsuit is complex and long, so I'll leave
the reading on this to you, but if IDI was actually forced to partner with a named defendant
allegedly involved in the Madoff Ponzi legal debacle, that is very scary stuff indeed.


"But Wait! You Also Get!" MOAR Lawsuits, Spam Email Pump & Dumps, and
Shareholder Wipeouts.


While Honig and Brauser are apparently just the leaders of this crew, there are many
others equally as bad. IDI director Peter T Benz seems to have been previously named in
lawsuit (along with Bi-Coastal Consulting Group and Jonathan Lebed) alleging Fraud,
Market Manipulation (stated halfway throug first paragraph), Unjust enrichment and
Negligent Misrepresentations in the "Warning Management Services" case. Robert N.
Fried was also sued at SearchMedia where he was co-chairman post-merger and CEO of
Ideation. The lawsuit alleges "revenues had been massively overstated due to flagrant
accounting irregularities" involving "fictitious business transactions".


Interestingly IDI is also covered by Gilford Securities. Gilford also has a checkered past,
including Gregg M Berger, former Gilford broker, who pled guilty and was jailed for
involvement in "pump and dump schemes" apparently using spam emails involving thinly
traded stocks to generate more than $30m of illegal proceeds. It also appears Gilford was
fined $125k by FINRA recently for failing to disclose "the research analyst received
compensation".


Furthermore, it appears the SEC fined Gilford Securities $995k for failing to properly
supervise the broker who served Vancouver Spam Promoter "John" Hui and the firm
which allegedly facilitated a $33m pump and dump scheme. The SEC also went on to
allege Gilford allowed employees to improperly execute customer orders without requisite
trading licenses, and violating Regulation S-P by sharing nonpublic customer information
with unauthorized third parties.


IDI Inc's Message Board Stock Promotion Campaign: Similar to Disgraced, Halted
and Bankrupt FNRG


How has IDI stock been temporarily pumped up to this obviously unsustainable valuation?


IDI is currently being supported by one of the most widespread and extensive online
message board tout campaigns I have ever seen. As a reminder, FNRG experienced
something similar (but far less egregious than IDI) before FNRG's chairman was arrested
for fraud and the company went bankrupt.

"The strategy for these posters is to seek out companies whose share price has
risen strongly and which are getting a lot of attention. The posters then seek to draw
readers' attention to ForceField. Some small portion of the readers end up buying
into ForceField, elevating share price and volume. Surprisingly, this strategy can
work if there are thousands of postings to other high performing and high interest
stocks."


Similarly, on the Yahoo message boards for example, we see countless yahoo ID's
recently created which only tout IDI across the message boards in huge volume. Tellingly
though their promotion campaign doesn't take place on IDI's board, presumably since
anyone on the IDI board already knows about IDI stock and is not a useful target. I think
the goal here is obvious: to lure in unsuspecting retail investors into IDI stock and
temporarily inflate the stock price.


For example, we can see username "ermelindarqkabergerc3138" joined yahoo on
6/26/2015 and then immediately began posting comments across unrelated boards, often
times literally within seconds of the last comment.

To be clear, I am not certain exactly who the individuals are by name behind this shady
online tout campaign (although I have my guesses). However, I don't see how anyone
would do this kind of extensive and premeditated work for free and typically stock
promotion is not done without compensation.


IDI Shareholder Base Is Essentially All Retail: Where Are The Credible "Real"
Investors?!?


Given this horrific penny stock wipeout team and yahoo message board tout campaign, it
is not surprising to me IDI's shareholder base is mostly retail. In fact the only institutional
investor involved of note is Frost ( through the original failed Tiger Media Investment). If
you exclude insiders who didn't buy their shares on the open market and Frost (who is
involved through a failed investment in a fraud), IDI inc is held almost entirely by
unsophisticated retail owners. There are no real institutions of any worth involved in IDI
other than a few random ETF/Index followers resulting from IDI's inclusion in the Microcap
ETF.

Why doesn't any "real" investment firm want any part of IDI?

TransUnion Lawsuit Renders IDI a "Zero" Immediately Anyway


What IDI's retail shareholders need to understand is that this lawsuit is devastating to IDI's
desperate technology claims which, in part, support IDI's temporarily inflated stock price. I
think this lawsuit between IDI and Transunion is one of the most clear cut lawsuits I've

ever seen and I believe IDI will obviously lose. The TLO IP in this lawsuit took TLO >4
years and $100m+ to develop with a huge team, when IDI loses this lawsuit (and any
claim to the IP) there is simply no way this tiny fraud ridden shell company has any hope
of recreating it. Therefore once IDI loses this lawsuit, the only "technology" left will be
some tiny debt collections company that has been struggling since 2001 and apparently
spends $0 on R&D. Furthermore, now that TransUnion is embroiled in IDI's technology
and business I think if IDI makes any technology claims in the future: Transunion will
respond with swift and endless litigation claims claiming any new IDI products are based
on "prior art" and Transunion's IP.


Furthermore, Brauser's Federal Fraud litigation with Equifax and egregious lawsuit with
Transunion clearly renders both of those companies "off limits" to IDI. In the data industry I
see no way any company can be successful if they are "black listed" from having any
dealings with those two juggernauts. Let alone the fact that Transunion seems intent on
destroying IDI and if you read the court documents I believe you will see, as I did, the
TransUnion/TLO team feels offended personally by all of this.


Pic credit Transunion's TLO


All the documents from the Transunion litigation against Brauer and IDI are free and
publicly available here and I especially recommend reading the complaint and any
transcripts. In the interest of time I will not go into detail and recommend you read up on
this yourself. I will give you my quick-summary read on it though, which is once
Transunion tried to enforce their noncompete agreements against IDI employees alleged
to have violated them, Brauser allegedly tried to extort Transunion over claimed license
fees due based on IP which TransUnion already purchased in the TLO bankruptcy
auction.


The lawsuit centers around "BOLT code" which is code written in BOLT that scans across
data sets. This is a common code and any multiple data base tool like lexis Nexis or
others have something like this. The other contested IP is the "BParser" code, which
converts the BOLT code to C++ (universal programming language).

sale documents Transunion and TLO participated in. I think there is ~100% chance that
IDI loses this resoundingly. For example, check out the express and direct description of
the assets sold in bankruptcy as cited in doc 61 filed 3/18/15


"[T]o the extent that Ole Poulsen holds or asserts any interests of any kind in the
BParser code converter software used or useful by the Debtor in the conduct of the
Business (the "BParser Code") or any other Business Assets, such BParser Code
and other Business Asset shall be deemed an Acquired Asset and may be
sold to the Buyer free and clear of all such interests…."


Furthermore, Brauser and IDI CEO Derek Dubner were intimately involved in the
bankruptcy auction as Transunion states they served the sales order on both Brauser and
Derek Dubner, as well as Interactive Data. While after the close of the sale, Poulsen and
Brauser both had extensive ongoing involvement with the case concerning division of sale
proceeds. Lastly, all of this IP appears to have been created using TLO hardware, stored
on TLO's servers and used 40+ TLO programmers. Even Poulsen was a full time
employee of TLO at the time working on the IP and was paid by TLO and then by
Transunion for this, and his home was even paid for by TLO, so any claims IP developed
at home are his seems worthless as well.


None of this even matters much anyway, as TransUnion's TLOxp is a dominant competing
product that is cheaper and with more functionality than anything IDI can offer.


If you call TLO, their sales people will be happy to explain all the reasons they are
superior to anyone else, and even if they were in fact inferior (they aren't) Transunion's
enormous global sales force would steamroll anyone stupid enough to confront them. If
TLO wasn't superior then why would Brauser try to buy them before and get sucked into
this impossible lawsuit over the IP?


TLO and Transunion are far cheaper too as they offer in depth reporting tools with "all you
can eat" pricing for <$175 a month. For small, low-volume customers who prefer
transactional pricing, TLO's superior service costs ~$0.30 per search, making IDI's quoted
average price of $0.375 per transaction a full +25% more expensive than TLO This makes
IDI inc's desperate product offerings not just hopelessly behind the curve but
simultaneously too expensive to be competitive. I don't see how Transunion doesn't just
eat them alive over time.

IDI Board of Directors: It Gets Even Worse…..


It's not just Brauser and Honig though, basically everyone involved in this company is tied
to financial disasters. You may think these people are protecting your best interest but, for
example, take board member Steven Rubin, who is apparently involved in:


MabVax Therapeutics Holdings (OTC:MBVX): Swift -79.79% wipeout


And it seems Kidville as well (OTCPK:KVIL): -78.86% Disaster


And one of the "best ones" he is involved in, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems Inc has
been crazy volatile and is "only" down -21.84% at the moment

With everything you've read, are these really people you want to invest with? Are you
honestly unable to find a SINGLE better company in the world run by better people to
invest in?!


IDI Inc Management Response


Since IDI inc has been active in promoting themselves to investors it is not hard to meet
them. I spoke with them not long ago but found their responses to issues raised to be
underwhelming and disappointing. Instead of offering a clear picture of the current
business, I found them to offer excessively promotional claims to TAM size and other
vague claims. In response to questions regarding management quality, they claim IDI to
be founded by the people who started the data fusion industry. However, I believe the real
genius leader of that (Hank Asher) passed away quite some time ago now and the last
company these current people were involved in went bankrupt and nearly wiped out equity
holders completely. I don't see how this is reassuring. Furthermore it seems to me their
sales and technology strategy is just "throw money at it" and I don't see how they can
possibly compete against sales and technology beasts like Transunion. IDI claims the
lawsuit is irrelevant. However, I think the documents point to a different view while claims
of litigation irrelevance ignore the reality I see, which is that Transunion seems intent on
crushing IDI and wiping them out completely. Considering any future for IDI is based on
technology, I don't see how Transunion contesting their IP claims, likely forever, is
anything other than disastrous.


IDI inc Catalyst: Heinous $160m Equity Shelf, Wall of Dilution as Shares Become
Unlocked For Sale


What is rare with IDI is the clear and identifiable catalysts to collapse the share price.
Primarily, IDI just filed an absolutely heinous shelf offering for the sale of $160m worth of
IDI stock, considering IDI's total market cap is ~$200m, this alone could wipeout current
IDI shareholders.


It gets better though, as we have a huge amount of IDI inc shares becoming unlocked
very soon. If you read the lockup agreement, there is no date next to the signature but we
know the shares are locked up for 1 year starting sometime late 2014 or early 2015. This
means that soon a wall of shares become unlocked for sale for a company trading at >40x
revenue and I think they will sell aggressively (if they are smart).


IDI inc = Desperate For Cash, Dilutive Secondary Offering Imminent

IDI also seems desperately low on cash, as we see here in 2014 where IDI claims they
have enough cash to survive 12 months. However, IDI's cash burn has ramped up, and
the shutdown of the Chinese billboard business will cost at least -$1m in cash to shut
down, while we are now nearly 8 months into 2015. This means IDI will have to raise cash
within the next 4 months, and given companies rarely wait until their cash account is
literally $0, I believe investors should expect another dilutive IDI capital raise sometime in
the next 2 months. This seems like a lot of simultaneous wipeout-catalysts occurring very
soon.


IDI inc's Auditor "Deficiencies" and Inability to File SEC Filings On Time


Considering Brauser was sued by Transunion for alleged involvement in falsifying
statements, it makes me horrified to see what I believe are signs of IDI internal accounting
integrity questions.


For example, of the two 10q and 10k filings IDI inc has been required to file since they
became IDI inc, a full 100% of those have been filed late (the 2014 10k and the Q1 10q).
One of these 10q filings seems to have been given to investors accidentally before IDI
inc's auditor was able to properly review it?!


Even more worrisome, IDI inc has curiously changed it's auditor to "RBSM LLP" who in
2013 was just recently found by the PCAOB to apparently have "audit deficiencies" and
"failure to perform sufficient procedures to evaluate the presentation of certain revenue".
This does not appear to have been an isolated incident either as this 2013 inspection
followed up an even worse 2009 PCAOB inspection where RBSM had "audit deficiencies"
including a "deficiency of such significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the
firm did not obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the
issuer's financial statements"


IDI Inc's Stated Market Cap on Yahoo Finance Not Accurate


The first thing you need to know is that I believe the yahoo finance stated market caps are
NOT completely correct as they do not seem to include the crazy "free" 2m IDI rsu shares
that will be issued to Honig and Brauser's through Marlin if/when IDI hits the comically low
hurdle of $15m of sales or $10m of sales and positive EBITDA (excluding stock comp). At
today's price I estimate those rsu shares alone are ~15% dilution to current shareholders
and if you correct for this, I estimate IDI's current "true" market cap is $202m.

Valuing IDI: "Best Case" Fair Value Analysis Shows -92.4% Downside


Even if IDI insiders were geniuses AND had shareholder interests at heart AND we use
the most optimistic estimates possible, IDI inc is STILL overvalued by somewhere
between -83.54% and -98% today.


Thankfully, valuing IDI inc is actually very easy as we have two very direct and recent
comparisons we can use to value IDI. One of them is literally the transaction of the
company IDI just bought that makes up all of IDI's ongoing business. The other recent
comparison is the recent auction of TLO, LLC which I believe is clearly a superior
business to IDI in every way possible but we can use that sale price as the most optimistic
upward bound possible for valuing IDI inc.


With these relevant comparisons we can then use some of the most optimistic
assumptions possible to estimate "Fair value" for IDI inc. Unfortunately, even using the
most optimistic assumptions possible I still come up with per share value for IDI inc stock
with between -98% and -83.5% of downside today. Note this would also be very consistent
with many other Honig/Brauser wipeouts which quickly fall between -70% and -100%.

(estimated chart created by me)


As you can see above, valuing IDI based on the Interactive Data, LLC transaction they
just did shows fair value per share for IDI inc of $0.969 per share for -92.4% downside
from today's stock price. Note that this analysis is using a $5m+ t12m revenue estimate
for IDI inc also which I believe is quite generous considering the <$4m in revenue
Interactive Data LLC was just producing and the nearly $0 in recent R&D spend they
disclosed.


If we use Ole Poulsen and Derek Drubner's latest bankruptcy TLO, LLC we can see that
despite multiple bidders and an extended auction, there was only $19m of
equity/stockholder value left. Note that this purchase price by TransUnion likely assumes
that TLO's products could be pushed through TransUnion's enormous global sales force,
allowing Transunion to pay more than would typically be a fair value. If we use that equity
valuation as a comp for IDI we see that IDI inc stock is worth a maximum of $0.26 per
share, for -98% near term downside for current shareholders.


If we even take the whole analysis to the most optimistic view possible and literally
completely ignore ALL of the $100m+ in debt/liabilities TLO, LLC filed bankruptcy with and
just give that all to equity holders instead, then retain the bullish $5m+ revenue estimate

for IDI inc, we STILL see that IDI inc stock has near term downside of -83.54% from today.


As you can see, IDI inc today trades at what is an impossible "bubblicious" valuation that
would make many dot com stocks blush. Educational tip: if you ever see a promotional
investor presentation with endless rambling about the "Addressable Market!" but ZERO
mention of the company's current financials or earnings, that company is likely to be a
future wipeout.

Frost Himself Seems To Know IDI inc Not Worth Anything Close to Today's Prices


Lastly and most hilariously, we know Frost expressed interest in bidding on TLO in
bankruptcy. We know TLO had 200+ employees, was built by the founding genius of the
industry, had ~$100m of liabilities (presumably a good proxy for cash burned), and took 5+
years to be built with ~$23m of revenue. Clearly I think TLO is a superior company to IDI
inc in every way possible.

We also know that Transunion (NYSE:TRU) initially won the stalking horse with their
~$100m bid (which basically wiped out the equity and covered the debt/liabilities) after
Frost was rumored to have put in a bid worth ~$100m, leaving ~$0 value for TLO
equity/shareholders. From this we can clearly infer that Frost was not interested in paying
$100m+ to own the vastly superior TLO company (otherwise HE would have been the
stalking horse or done the DIP, etc). Yet now we have IDI inc, inferior in every way
imaginable, trading for >$200m implied valuation!


Plungey Makes The Call: IDI Will Be A(nother) Shareholder Wipeout With -92.4%

IDI inc: -98% Near Term Downside with Wipeout Coming = DON'T FALL FOR IT.


I believe the bottom line is that under no reasonably reality is IDI worth anything even
vaguely close to $200m. The people in charge of IDI saw their last company recently go
bankrupt despite leadership from the undisputed king of the modern data era Hank Ahser,
who unfortunately passed away and will be deeply missed. Remember TLO took 5 years,
hundreds of employees and apparently at least $100m of cash, to build and that still went
bankrupt and nearly wiped out the equity investors entirely. Michael Brauser and Barry
Honig seem to me a penny stock wipeout team so toxic that even if Frost invests, their
involvement virtually ensures wipeout or fraud accusations. The wreckage of bankruptcy
and wipeout in their path is truly eye watering in my view. Furthermore, IDI currently trades
at a "bubblicious" valuation relative to obviously superior and much larger companies
while the current Yahoo message board stock promotion campaign is extremely
concerning.


While hyped up "data fusion!" fad claims and yahoo message board stock promotion may
temporarily inflate any stock's valuation, reality and the wave of IDI stock sales coming will
bring this disaster crashing back down, like so many other Honig and Brauser wipeouts.
Ultimately, IDI is made up of a tiny, 14 year old, struggling debt collection service paid for
with $5.6m in cash and no amount of weirdly promotional stock tout articles or confused
"mom & pop" retail stockholders can change that.


This temporarily insane 40x revenue valuation coupled with large $160m shelf offering
filed, and a huge volume of shares becoming unlocked, means insiders could aggressively
dump their shares onto the market until IDI falls all the way to $4 per share. At which point
IDI would STILL have another -85% downside even from there. I believe it is obvious that,

too bad too many people keep falling for frauds in the investment market. Greed is reason why. If a deal is too good to

But the worst are the investments that they sell you that are not frauds but just rip offs. People fall for them are not
greedy but just ignorance. My worst investment was buying 2 whole life insurance policy in 1974.

Pump Stoppers,


What do independent directors Steve Rubin, Robert Fried, Peter Benz and Robert Swayman get out of their
involvement with IDI? Why would they risk harm to their reputations if this is a worthless company? Dr. Frost is
building Opko Health into a legitimate diversified biotech via the purchase of Prolor, CytoChrome, Eirgen and
BioReference Labs. Why is he involved here? He rarely sells stock of the companies where he's a major shareholder
so I doubt he sold during the recent stock price increase. So it seems the risk to his reputation exceeds any possible

Frost got involved with Tiger Media several years ago. Tiger was a well known Chinese RTO fraud. Given that
Tiger is a fraud, its actual operating business is very poor. Just Google "Tiger Media and Fraud."

This sounds personal... the company has been been operating for several years, filing with the SEC on time, and
being as transparent as any public company can be... In addition, none of the management has every been charged
with crime.

Let's all together welcome Ccapri1001! .... WELCOME. Finally IDI's defense joined the discussion. A brand
new alias posting his own comment to support this shady company. I guess the Company is not the only thing
looking shady here.

Thank you for the welcome. ... I read your article several times, and did additional research on my own ...
some of the allegations can be true .. but this is for the legal system to decide ... my concern is that
companies can be publicly traded for several years, then get taken down with an article ... where is the SEC
all those years if those individuals, (con artists) as you portray them, have been been defrauding retail
investors for decades. I respect the effort you've put into this..

Where was the SEC for the two decades Madoff ran a ponzi scheme? Your logic doesn't cut it.

Great article.


I have seen IDI promoters posted on many yahoo msg boards. It will be great if FBI can figure out who posted the
messages and how much money they earned from doing it.


Wow. Eye popping.


22 Jul 2015, 04:35 AM


Pharma Investor, Contributor
Might be eye popping! Before jumping to the conclusion that these were "longs" posting on the Yahoo
message boards, what if we contemplated that they were in fact shorts posing as longs. Who knows after all,
these guys were anonymous. Maybe they were posting knowing an article such as this may one day come
out? Could be a pretty sophisticated scheme, but I doubt I'm the first to think this could be the case. 
Just as many believe there are paid "long" pumpers, I'm sure there are many paid "short" distorters too. 
Fact is, no serious investor should put any stock in what shows up on Yahoo message boards (long or short).

I'm beginning to doubt this article when I noticed Insiders were buying shares on 7/21/2015. No BK dude or Shortie, if
I may! Thanks anyway. I picked up some Cheap shares. :)

IDI CEO responded to Pump Stopper. No comment from the Shorts here. I wonder why.

hi, luckykid:


they always do. check UNXL. Another perfect example the company management makes stories all the time
and took investors money and nothing in return.


22 Jul 2015, 09:09 PM


luckykid
Not as forceful as this CEO of IDI; he and other Insiders added ( bought) more shares they already own. Like
my Pappy use to say: Son, there are many reasons Insiders sell , but there is only one reason Insiders buy.
And that is to make more money when opportunity arises. And don't let others make you think otherwise. 
Anyway, thanks for the cheap shares, Shorties. No bankruptcy, dudes! :)

Thank you for the link. Very interesting rebuttal. Small wonder the stock popped back up 25% today. Wish I
would have bought this a.m. like my gut told me too (no position). 
I find it interesting that the while the author states that the TLO/Transunion lawsuit could take IDI to zero, the
situation is that IDI's current technology/intellectual property is not based on the IP under litigation. Per IDI's
assertions, it's almost exactly opposite to the way the author presents: no significant harm to IDI's operations
if they lose, but huge potential gains if they win (royalty payments). 
Will be watching to see how many form 4's come out in the next few days showing insider buying on this dip
(as the interview asserts occurred).


23 Jul 2015, 02:21 AM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Transunion, a $5b global juggernaut (and my opinion of what the legal docs clearly say)
disagree with you. Instead of blindly following questionable management teams, i believe actually reading the
research is a better way to invest. The court docs are all cited, linked and free for public view anyway so you
can read them all and form your own opinion but I think it is beyond obvious how the lawsuit will play out and
explained how I formed that opinion.


23 Jul 2015, 11:22 AM


Michael Bachmann, Contributor
How can he possibly pretend they're the ones suing? It's in the public court documents that IDI is the
defendant...


23 Jul 2015, 11:50 AM


Pharma Investor, Contributor
I guess investors do have to make a decision:  
Do they trust your "opinion" on the legal matters; an anonymous author who stands to profit the stock
dropping with likely no ill effect if he is found to be wrong in his presentation of the facts or, 
Do they trust management who have a name/face/address/etc. and stand to face severe
penalties/litigation/etc if they are found to be materially misrepresenting the facts of the case (and also have a
conflict of interest on the long side)?


Anyhow, the point was your claim was IDI goes to zero if the TLO/Transunion suit goes against IDI. IDI's claim
appears to be that their current technology/IP is not based on the previous IP litigated in this case, thus they
do not stand to face the situation you describe. Given they employ the very individual who developed the
TLO/Transunion IP, one might believe they have a clue what they are talking about.


Further, I find it interesting you point out that anonymous individuals who spam message boards with multiple
posts are to be considered suspect in their intentions (they must be paid by someone right?). I actually agree

IDI holdings.


My question relating to this part of your article would be how are we to view your recent activities? Did you not
post essentially the same comment this weekend on no less than three articles here on Seeking Alpha about
CRMD? 
Link here: http://bit.ly/1VCsmwX

And a third identical comment posted to my article. That comment was removed specifically due to the fact it
violated SA's abusive comment rules.

Look at the sec filings which are ontheirWebsite he bought at 245 pm all 15300 shares to keep from going to zero!!! If
his motive was to buy low and sell high like most investors..... He missed big time lmao. He would have waited for the
bottom then bought in, but obviously he was trying to prevent the crash. He definitely did with his interview and buying
shares blah blah blah . U have to look at the whole picture and when it was done there was no buy signal at any of
those prices executed plain and simple. There was obviously other motives. However it's gonna crash again tomorrow
bc lawsuit is FILED now just investigation anymore. This was done post market 7/22.


23 Jul 2015, 02:59 AM


Pharma Investor, Contributor
Lawsuits? Based purely on this article. Have you done any due diligence about how these "lawsuits" pan out.
Let's look at CBMG: after months they had one plaintiff who sold 100 shares. These aren't lawsuits, they are
part of a bigger game being played. http://yhoo.it/1HLpbNB 
How about the similar recent attack on CRMD. So far that lawsuit's lead plaintiff sold all of 50 shares. Seeing
a trend here?  
Stock up again this a.m...guess it's not panning out as you predicted. Maybe the market is getting wise to
what is going on here with Rosen, et al and seeing these events as a buying opportunity.

I agree. Given that IDI management indicates they could have significant developments ahead, they are
confident shorts will soon turn out to be their friend. I expect over time the smart money will see these articles
as massive opportunities (as I think this one has been seen as)---particularly when management responds
immediately and forcefully as IDI and CBMG both did. Effect will probably wane with each subsequent article
as many educate themselves on this process and the calls are proven unreliable. Sure a few retail longs will
get scared out of shares, a few retail shorts will try to jump on board shorting at the bottom--both these
groups will lose. But I can just see any number of more sophisticated investors/hedge funds waiting a few
hours, then buying up any dip and more educated longs holding through the fiasco. As this occurs, dips will
likely become less pronounced and the game will have lost its luster.


23 Jul 2015, 02:28 PM

My advice to people is never play the game with fraud or pump and dump. You are in the dark and the one that
control the stock is always the winner. Never try to short them because again you are playing in a game that someone
else controls. 
As far as I know very few fraud or pump and dump ever lost money. It is always the outsider that get hurt. They can
drive the price of the stock up with no fear because they know when to sell.

18 Sep 2015, 01:34 PM


Michael Bachmann, Contributor
All I had to do was skip to the bottom and see this: "We note that IDI estimates its addressable markets at
$13.6 billion. If this estimate is accurate and IDI can succeed and obtain even just 10% of the data fusion
market, then the fair market value of IDI should approach $1 billion."


You are mixing up revenue and market cap. Also if someone was willing to pay up to 180mil why would that
make it worth $1 bil (not addressing that Transunion still ended up with some of the IP so you'd have to split
that value).


Their most recent 10q showed losses of 3.98mil on revenues of 0.98mil. That's a billion dollar business?

Boxman, we are not mixing up revenues and market cap. We are simply implying a 1x revenue multiple would
equal $1B.


21 Sep 2015, 10:23 PM


SkyTides, Contributor
You are implying Transunion received IP that is valuable. Our research indicates otherwise. Additionally,
Transunion does not have the team that developed all of the IP being discussed. That IP is useless if you
can't improve upon it as times passes by. The development team is primarily what makes IDI so valuable. Go
ahead and look at historically top and bottom line results - those are the most meaningless metrics you could
bring forth. IDI has not launched their primary product offering yet. Believe or don't believe, but with a team
that has this track record, we are very willing to bet on them.

It seems as though much of what was alleged in this article has been proven wrong at this point in time. Maybe the
purchase of Fluent or Q-Interactive aided this. Maybe the launch and acceptance of ID-Core helped as well. But one
thing for certain I am sure this article made a lot of investors jump ship contributing to the 40% drop. Now the stock
trades on the Nasdaq under the name COGT as the company owning IDI, Fluent and Q-Interactive with sales over
200 million and gross profits last quarter of 33% and growing their business nicely.
