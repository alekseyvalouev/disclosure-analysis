Geron's Negative Imetelstat Data Has Been Misinterpreted By
Investors

Summary


We believe IMbark may have a healthier patient population which explains the
longer than expected overall survival.


Deeper analysis shows that median overall survival in patients after discontinuation
of Jakafi can be as long as 36 months.


If imetelstat had a positive impact on overall survival, we would expect the 9.4mg/kg
dose arm to have outperformed the ineffective 4.7mg/kg arm.


We are short Geron with a targeted return of 90%.


We believe the recent update from Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) was definitely negative.
Despite Geron's claim that the overall survival seen so far in the IMbark trial is very
promising, we believe the median overall survival (mOS) for the imetelstat group is not
unusual given the baseline health of the IMbark patients. We also believe that Geron
provided evidence that imetelstat has no impact on survival by disclosing that there was
no difference in median survival detected so far in either dosing arm. The update only
served to confirm our view of imetelstat's likely failure and our expectation that partner
Janssen (NYSE:JNJ) will terminate its licensing agreement.


IMbark enrolled a population which benefited survival when
compared to historical literature


The big takeaway that investors seemed to have had from Geron's recent update was that
with a median follow up of 19 months at the time of the January 2018 data cut, median
overall survival had not been reached in either dosing arm in the IMbark trial. Geron
further stated the greater than 19 months of median overall survival looked promising
since published clinical and real-world studies estimate that median overall survival after
discontinuing JAK inhibition therapy is approximately 14-16 months. Analysts such as

from Stifel went further and stated, "As the 19 month follow-up was conducted in January,
this suggests a potential ~22-24 month median overall survival in patients taking
imetelstat." Investors ate up the news, driving the shares up over 50% to 52-week highs.


We think investors are overlooking the fact that the patients in the IMbark trial are
healthier than the trials to which Geron compared them. The IMbark trial's inclusion and
exclusion criteria explicitly state that only ECOG 0-2 patients can be enrolled and that
patients with a peripheral blood blast count of >= 10% are to be excluded. The trial
excluded ECOG 3 patients, who are capable of only limited self-care and are confined to a
bed or chair for more than 50% of their waking hours. We also know that myelofibrosis
(MF) patients with peripheral blood blast count of >=10% have shorter overall survival.
Based on stated trial criteria, we have concluded that the IMbark trial did not include very
sick patients.


Geron provided additional information on the 4Q 2017 conference call when in response
to a question, Geron revealed that IMbark patients "required at least 75,000 platelets" per
microliter. This point is crucial because when stratified by platelet count, the historical MF
trials show that patients with higher platelet counts live substantially longer than the
overall population of patients who discontinue JAK inhibitors.


A well-known trial for MF patients after discontinuation of ruxolitinib (Jakafi) is a recently
published paper in the 130 edition of medical journal Blood by researchers at MD
Anderson. The researchers state that patients after discontinuation of Jakafi had a
"median survival time of 14 months (95% CI, 10-18 months)."


At face value, the IMbark results look very promising versus the MD Anderson results: at
least 19 months mOS in IMbark vs. an expected mOS of 14 months. However, the MD
Anderson trial was actually a chart review on an essentially all-comers basis and followed
patients from the start of Jakafi and after discontinuation. In other words, it included all
patients who discontinued Jakafi regardless of health. This can be seen in Table 1 where it
shows that the median platelet count in the post-Jakafi population was 91,000/ul with a
range of 11,000/ul to 922,000/ul. Because the median platelet count in the paper was so
close to the allowed lower bound in the IMbark trial, a substantial portion of the patients
followed in the MD Anderson paper would have been ineligible for IMbark. For reference,

a normal level of platelets is 150,000-400,000/ul and mild bleeding can occur if platelets
drop below 50,000/ul. We can also see that one of the patients in the MD Anderson paper
had a platelet count of 11,000/ul, which is considered very low.


We can see later in the Blood article in Figure 2B that patients with platelet counts
<100,000/ul did significantly worse in terms of survival. It appears this population had a
median survival closer to 10 months. They accounted for 33 of the 56 total patients, more
than half of the population, which we believe skewed the overall results negatively.
Conversely, for the patients with a platelet count of >100,000/ul, it appears the mOS was
closer to 36 months! We believe the IMbark patient population was more similar to the
>100,000/ul population in the MD Anderson trial than the <100,000/ul population. Keep in
mind that IMbark already excluded patients with ECOG scores greater than 2 and patients
who had peripheral blood blasts of >10%.

If IMbark, which as we showed above had a relatively healthy population, enrolled one-
third of patients that should have an expected mOS of 10 months and two-thirds of
patients that should have an expected mOS of 36 months, then we would expect the
blended average to be around 24 months. As a result, we believe that the median OS of
22-23 months that Stifel estimates Geron is observing currently is neither impressive nor
unprecedented. In fact, it's completely expected.


IMbark high-dose arm is not outperforming the low-dose arm
which was determined to be ineffective


Furthermore, Geron disclosed that neither arm of the IMbark had reached median OS.
The IMbark trial had two arms, a low-dose 4.7mg/kg arm and a high-dose 9.4mg/kg arm.
In September 2016, Geron announced that enrollment in the 4.7mg/kg dosing arm would
be discontinued because the dose was determined to be ineffective and did not "warrant
further investigation."



http://ir.geron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=67323&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2201055

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/3/959452_15216763940184_rId14.png
In addition, because the low-dose arm was essentially shut down, Janssen amended the
trial protocol so that the 4.7mg/kg arm patients were allowed to crossover to the 9.4mg/kg
arm at the investigator's discretion. However, Geron stated on the recent fourth quarter
2017 earnings call that "there were a meaningful number of patients who remained on 4.7
mg/kg." Therefore, we believe the 4.7mg/kg is a good proxy for a placebo or control arm.


Since Geron and Janssen determined the 4.7mg/kg arm was ineffective, then we should
expect the 9.4mg/kg arm to outperform on a survival basis, but we haven't seen that yet,
as indicated in their press release which stated: "the median overall survival has not been
reached in either dosing arm." Since the 4.7mg/kg arm was enrolled on average earlier
than the 9.4mg/kg arm, a best case would be equivalent survival rates between the arms.


This indicates to us that imetelstat has not had a positive impact on survival. This lack of
survival efficacy matches the lack of efficacy in traditional endpoints associated with MF
like spleen volume, which Geron and Janssen announced in April 2017, and we believe it
corroborates our view that imetelstat is not effective in MF.


Janssen is no fool


Lastly, we point out that Janssen has essentially delayed its decision on imetelstat multiple
times. A decision was originally expected in 2016 and then in 2017. If imetelstat truly
offered a 4-6 month or greater survival benefit, we believe Janssen would have opted into
imetelstat by now. Instead, Janssen stopped enrollment in September 2016 and has been
waiting until the last moment to make a decision. To us, this seems like more of a Hail
Mary than a strong indicator of efficacy.


We are short Geron


We are short Geron with a price target of $0.51. We believe imetelstat will be returned by
Janssen and value it at $0.

It would be interesting if JNJ takes note and reiterates the patient selection criteria in its April presentation-- it
would put the fear of God in the ambulance chasers for crossing the line into slander. Novartis and incy should be
reflecting on their potential exposure to litigation as well.


I re-read the clinical trial criteria for IMbark and it clearly states documentation of disease progression after taking
a JAK inhiitor is required for patients to be enrolled in the study.

I've done business with Charles Schwab for 30 years. But today, first time EVER, they offer me money to lend
shares of my stocks for shorts. I own LOTS of Geron so I can only assume that the shorts are out there trying to
free up shares to save their arses.


NFW I'm lending ANY of my shares for shorts. Rot in Hell you bastardos ! 
This should be an indication that many are still severely trapped. Let's all pay them back in spades for all the years
of grief they've given Geron investors, All the patients lives and misery they have cost, for causing the FDA Holds,
and for every single time we have good news, interfering with the PPS and the stocks success. Without their
criminality, this stock would be at $20.

Great post.


Q: Did you do anything special to prevent them from being loaned in the first place?


I recently placed GTC limit sell orders ($35/share) on my shares at TDAmeritrade in hopes of preventing
them from being loaned-out for shorting. Anybody know for sure if this is effective method, or have specific
experience with TDAmeritrade on this topic?


Nice to hear there's some stress on the short side of Geron.


31 Mar 2018, 09:07 AM


Bridge to sell
Hoosier, I've been trying to get a definitive answer on this as well. Now having read up extensively, it
appears that the only guaranteed way to prevent lending is to switch to a cash account.


About 2 years ago I contacted TD and asked to mark my account as non-hypothecating but they told me
they could not do that for a margin account. GTC orders do not earmark your SPECIFIC shares, only
shares held in your broker's general share pool.


Conceivably, those shares could be allocated elsewhere before your sell price is reached. So essentially
they could be lent out if the math suggests there will be plenty of time to recover them before your sell
price triggers a sale.

Thanks for the timely & helpful info....much appreciated.


When establishing the account, I wanted to allow for future option trades which resulted in a margin
account. I've never felt confident or savvy enough to engage in options or margin trading, so I only use the
account to buy/hold/sell common shares based on available cash balances. I will call them next week to
see if I can switch the account to a non-margin cash account in hopes of preventing my shares from being
loaned out.


Thanks again for the detailed feedback.

Well, that was an easy change to make. I called the TDA 24/7 client services line, and they made the
change to 'cash account' for me. They also informed me that I could've made the change online as well.
The change should be effective within a couple of business days.


I'm not in the same ballpark as PTCA, Wiz, Ed, and Ed's clients with regard to share count, but I'll sure
sleep better knowing I've done my part to prevent my shares from being used against us by those wishing
failure upon the drug & company. I erroneously though my GTC limit order would do the trick, so I'm very
appreciative of Wiz and Secret-third-Arm's (Mike?) feedback on the topic.

NO Question whatsoever in my mind who caused the FDA HOLDS right after the Tefferi Abstract release.
You all know the pattern don't you ? As soon as there is ANY good Geron news, they attack almost
immediately. There are those that live under rose colored glasses that never believed the FDA HOLDS
were caused by special interests but I think we've all seen enough evidence now to see the truth.

Let me add to the confusion. I have A Schwab account and hold alot of GERN. GERN stock is not
margineable per Schwab and has a 100% requirement (risk factors). So although I've been on margin in
my account for over a decade (I wouldn't have it any other way and I maximize my leverage), I have to pay
for GERN dollar for dollar. Has nothing to do with it being under or over $3.00 pps.


I could not go off margin completely very easily or strategically. However, Schwab is asking me permission
to sign up and allow borrowing my shares for income and I would never allow it.

I wouldn't want to throw gasoline on a fire, but note that, based on the numbers of Fails-to-Deliver events
registered by the SEC, GERN is subject to heavy NAKED short selling anyway.

Just for the 2nd half of January + 1st half of February (a period of time when the share price first
attempted to rally to $3), a grand total of 1956056 shares were not delivered in time to their owner.
This is more than happened for INTC during the same period of time! (only 1742367 FTD)
We really have shorters of the worst kind here, and I don't think they have taken their losses yet :-(

The Bottomline: If no one sold at cheap prices, if nobody was forced to sell, if everybody ignored their
fraudulent negative propaganda, Then the games the shorts play are only on themselves and they are
destroyed. I will do my utmost part in destroying them and I will continue to buy more shares if they lower
the prices. This time, the corrupt short organization needs to pay up magnaminously. They have put their
greed above medical science, above patients lives, above the law, and any class action cannot be more
bogus than with Geron that has made no claims to aid investors or the pps and revelation of data has
been more than scarce. Threats of class actions having no basis whatsoever are merely part of the Shorts
smear campaign to drive the pps lower. I'm going to enjoy what's coming to these criminals.


More than ever, I respect Geron/JNJ keeping a lid on data and the competition. We can clearly see why it
had to be done. The end result will be unstoppable. The value of having JNJ as our Partner is

For those that can, please make sure you are holding your GERN shares in a cash account and not
margin. That will dry up the float and help propel the stock higher. We CAN do something about these
shorts if we act in concert.

Hoosier, how exactly can shorts bring "failure upon the drug & company"? They can't affect the trials, only
the share price.


We investors may become homeless, but the drug isn't affected at all... and if the drug is approved and
starts producing income, then how are the tiny shorts (what, about $150 million in short interest, spread
among hundreds of HFTs?) going to affect $344 billion JNJ and a buyout?

User13etc.: If the short interest is mostly HFT, then they're constantly trading. Most of the current interest
may well have shorted before the AF article, during the highs.


If shorts made a business of shorting stocks in the $1.80s and then covering in the $6s, there wouldn't be
any shorts ;)

I don't know about other accounts but Schwab even with a margin account does not allow Geron to be
bought other than @ 100% value therefore not margineable in a margin account. I would think for GERN,
it doesn't matter if it is a cash account or not if the requirement is 100% ownership anyway. Now if your
broker allows you to margin GERN @ less than 100% (therefore you are leveraging), then yes they can
probably lend out some portion of your shares. The fact that Schwab needs me to sign up for allowing
lending of my GERN shares tells me this as well.

This article is trash. If you want real results, go to investigator discussions from GERON. Go to pubmed literature,
look at real data and not trashy biased articles. Can't wait, my bonus is coming on Friday, so I am definitely buying
GERON. and fools will loose twice. First time around I bought GERN at 2.3 and sold to early at 4.5. I hope people
will keep pushing GERON down all the way until Friday. So I can buy it on the cheap.

User, let me explain. And excuse my English, I am not highly skilled in my writing. 
Some years ago, I had opportunity to work with a product, that was very good, and when read out of the
study was coming, I with number of other investors, bought in completely, guess what, read out of the
study, did not produce any significant Survival benefit. (from what I can remember, only thing that could
have been considered as improvement, that in triple combination with this drug, subject seemed to
complain less of their hair falling out). Before market open, and I could sell my stocks, I lost more than half
of my money, and I was deeply in negative territory.
Then I interviewed with opthotech technology, (read up on them if you really trying to understand my logic)
and their compound fovista. Which had a great result from phase 2 studies, but failed terrible in phase 3.
Stock that was once a darling, and went up all the way to 73 dollars per stock, dropped below 3 dollars. 
I do not invest my nest egg with biotech, I do not know enough to do that. I am not even trained oncologist,
even those I do have a medical background. What I read up on Geron, just did not made sense, if their
progression free so good, then about 3-4 weeks ago when I fist bought some shares at 2.3 dollars, it
seemed ridiculously cheap. 
Then I saw shares basically double in two weeks after I bought them. I was very excited, then I saw that
some news came out with INCY, that leads me to believe they will be around 100 dollars per stock maybe
even more sometimes late April or May. Geron could be part of buyout, and maybe if I never sold my
shares, and ride them all the way, I could make 20X of what I put in originally, but I believe in locking in my
profits. From companies that I have followed for at least 4-5 years, INCY, is my favorite. I love their
pipeline, I think that company ran by very bright people. I honestly do believe, that if all market and political
unrest that going on in US will stop, INCY could be part of bidding war over IDO compound that will go into
read out soon. If major players will have a bidding war....... late fall INCY could be even 200 dollars per
stock, and unlike geron they have many shots on goal, many collaborations, and their are definitely not
one trick ponny.


If you like one trick ponny, here is a tip, read up on verastem. I would argue, they are much more ready to
incredible growth, and make someone a huge amount of money than Geron. I have no idea why their
stock right now is barely over 3.05-3.10 range if I rember stock price from last night.

So I hope I clarified my point. I believe in hedging, especially against companies which have not done their
phase 3 studies, and have not meet all their study end points. Look at PGNX, they meet all the study end
points, and just because their approval process moved by 3 months, they lost 20 percent of their value. 3
months in most biotech companies, is absolutely nothing. I think most people who invest in biotech have
very poor understanding how that world works.


So here is my response to you. I hope it makes sense.

There more drugs coming down the pipeline that are far more promising. If Geron was going to take off it would
have already. There are very few patients on the drug today because its not as effective as other options. If you
look at INFN with early phase MF patients its far more effective for patients and patients are living longer when
INFN works.

Robespierre,


Have you read the report? I haven't. I have no idea what is in it, and I bet that Scarlett hasn't either. Why
would he? It's not his job to respond to every hit piece that suggests IMET won't end up being approved,
etc.


At the end of the day, GERN's price per share will not be affected by any article, bullish or bearish. I
suggest you look at days like today as buying opportunities if you believe in IMET. There are multiple
upcoming catalysts in the next 6 months to a year, so we won't have to wait too long for something big to
happen, one way or another.


27 Mar 2018, 10:03 AM


Robespierre
If I was an analyst attending today's call I would ask Scarlett how significant is the data collected so far.
You say that "It's not his job to respond to every hit piece that suggests IMET won't end up being
approved, etc." What do you think the analyst conferences are for? They are exactly to debunk indirectly
the hit pieces and inform the institutional investors of the positives. Part of the job of the CEO is to protect
the pps (stock is currency in case you are not aware). So yes I would hope the CEO to address this in
today's meeting without answering directly the hit piece.

I can assure you that they are NOT for debunking short articles. But believe whatever you want to believe.


I agree with you that a CEO needs to focus on maximizing share price, but I do not agree that a CEO
should "protect" anything. The market has a mind of its own and virtually every CEO not named Elon Musk
understands this and doesn't get bogged down in the day to day BS that bears will sling at his or her
company from time to time.


Hey, if Scarlett feels the need to address the content of the article, that's great. But again, we don't even
know what it says (unless you paid for it), so if it's just some opinion piece largely based on the fact that
the share price ran up too high, too fast, given the perceived risks of approval, what's to defend? Different
opinions are what makes a market and what allow us to achieve out-sized gains from time to time.

well, in the venue of consumer discretionaries, like smartphones, sure. in pharma, opinions are like
sphincters: everybody has one. in the drug world, it's facts that matter. sponsors tend to obfuscate the
truth, good and bad; they even try that with regulators (on the bad side of things, of course). in the end, it's
not opinion or the CxO class that matters. what matters is efficacy. and not killing folks.

Taz, right you are. The 14 mo OS data from the MD Anderson article also includes some patients whose
disease was stable. It is really worth trying to parse out what the differences in patient population are
between the "real world" Janssen study and and the other smaller studies referenced by Scarlett that
showed "better" OS of 14 and 16 months. If the R/R patients are clearly closer to the real world patients in
the course of their disease the results to date are even more spectacular. The acknowledgment of the
other studies with better OS is a bid to be open and also say that even if the best case OS were 16
months, Imetelstat will still blow those results away regardless of what AF has to say. The data should be
able to speak for itself. Who to believe...AF or Drs. Raza/Tefferi Hmmm... let me think. bp

Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) had set its goals too high this past May during Phase 3 testing of a drug, called
Sustol, designed to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Test results, however, turned out positive—
good news for chemo patients, but not so much for Mangrove. It covered at a loss.”

So let me ask you, Nathaniel August, a few questions. I would appreciate an answer. This is in regards to your
three profound articles on Geron which all call basically for Geron's demise:


Do you, Mr. August, really believe what you are writing? What short positions do you put on "prior" to writing these
articles? Aside from profit motive, what reason do you have to post these articles? Anyone who understands the
basics about Geron would know how to undermine everything accomplished in articles by skewing statistics,
making up one's own statistics, and basically lying. Is the ability to work the system is your MO?


Why have you decided to post on Twitter statements against myself and MTB? I can only imagine the wealth
you've generated by your system, wealth gained at the expense of others.


At first I thought you were short a massive amount of Geron after your first article and needed to bail out of the
short. I now question that. Do you put on shorts prior to all hit articles, never being in a stock for longer then a few
hours? Do you buy very close expiration puts just outside the strike price so they would have maximum leverage
and volatility?


Rather than having my posts deleted why don't you try and answer my questions. These are valid questions
regarding your three articles and would like some answers. Why don't you and I have a dialogue on this article
about your three Geron articles, back-to-back-to-back.

Remember you have according to many sites just over 164 mill total shares outstanding --
current float of about 159 mill shares -- , so with about 38% insider and institutional ownership you still have a float
of 98 million shares +. Also the brokerage firms automatically put your shares into a margin acct which means they
can loan them, so.unless you specify different they are available to loan as for shorts. Does not matter if small
investors or large, the total shares being held by a firm are in a pool the firms work from. Brokerage firms make
good money doing this, so glad to loan shares. If using 35+ mill shares short+ there are still 65 mill shares
available to loan. Will be so interesting to see both the next report of shorts, but especially the 4-1 report if GERN
holds in or betters this current price.

accuracy. Yahoo has had so many reorgs over recent years, greatly reduced their staffing, and it has really shown
up in a negative way on their finance site. It is sad because some years ago they were much better and reliable.
Main thing I have found is NASDAQ info is correct, just wish they would or could publish the short data a little
quicker but know they are dependent on others reporting. As to short interest on GERN if you look at the daily
report the short interest is growing. Will be very interested to see the March 15 figure, but so much of the jump
came after that the 4-1 number will show the main pop and short results. All you folks have a great weekend.

On Yahoo Finance, type GERN, search - then click on Statistics, it will show everything:
Shares oustanding : 160.65M
Float 159.78M
Average vol (3 months) 4.89M
Shares short 28.44M
Shares short (prior month) 27.77M


Happy weekend to everyone. Cheers up

Black, will you stop pretending that you don't know that no one (outside of NASDAQ employees) has real-
time short numbers? It's one of the few bizarre 1800s leftovers in the modern investment world.


We find out the short interest two weeks late, and that's how it is in 2018 AD.

Black, if there were such a thing as real-time short information, don't you think that would matter? Don't
you think that NASDAQ would know about it... instead of the current situation, where they constantly have
to defend themselves for hoarding the info?


And stop pretending that you believe that the short interest was 28 million at the last report... you know full
well it was 35 million.

telo: where are you seeing a recent post of mine where I say that the short interest is 28 million?


I am currently wondering if what we saw last week was a "short squeeze" of some sort???


We had some huge volume and significant PPS increase which I opine can NOT be explained by the
"news" that we received!!!


And, I further opine that if the shorts did not cover, they're currently in a world of $$$ hurt.


I guess my "real" bottom line is Where Would 35 Million Actual Shares Come From?


I believe that the huge volume came from the same shares being sold over and over and over again by
traders, hedges and HFT.

short - that is totally wrong. The number they quote is from 11-15-17. To get latest numbers and they are
about 2 weeks behind, but go to NASDAQ and you will find out the latest short interest and they update
short interest in 2 week periods. Obviously there is a time delay to get the info, so currently last report is 2-
28-18 and this coming Thursday they will update to 3-15-18. Below I have posted the link to Geron short
interest on NASDAQ. Do yourself a big favor and question Yahoo Finance reports by using other sites.

Wow this is an invaluable link, thanks!
So basically, there's been about 30M shares exchanged in short activity over the last 5 trading days. If we
surmise this was 95% short covering and not short selling, short have mostly covered their positions in
GERN entirely by now.. amazing volume.

On second thought, I don't know how to read those graphs. Would red bars only reflect short SALES as
the page title seems to imply?!
So actually, short selling would still have happened in droves during the latest rally, and there would be
even more shorts by now?
That sounds impossible.

One other item that deserves clarification is the "success" of GERN management.


I have opined, for years, that chippy has acted like a blind squirrel who just so happened to nest in an oak tree
AND simply did not know what to do when multiple acorns hit him in the head until his nest was full!


The blind squirrel had enough acorns fall in his nest so he could feast through the winter and all the other squirrels
proclaimed his prowess. Great Job they proclaimed!


But, what if the blind squirrel had nested in a sweet gum tree?


Food for thought?!?!?!


And what about the notion of new acquisitions (large money sinks!). No acorns on them!!!


Of course, IMO.

wow BM, you have a way with words. yes, what if that squirrel had nested in a sweet gum tree. (what is a

Anyhow, it's a tree that produces hundreds of golf ball size seed packets that have prickly barbs all over

But even one real acorn is worth ten billion in an oncology field full of sweet gum.

unfortunate fact is that these days all financial writers, commentators, analysts, everyone large and small, are
utterly without credibility. All do what they do to deliberately, manipulate investors with an eye to exploiting
uninformed money. Markets have become nothing but smoke, mirrors, and deception.


Even the most skeptical, cynical generally are naive optimists and end up shocked by how bad things are when
they initially start following todays markets and financial media.


23 Mar 2018, 02:37 PM


User 27367083
Thanks AE for a well-reasoned analysis. Patient demographics are a critical piece to interpreting the efficacy of
any clinical trial, and particularly uncontrolled studies.


The truth is we don't know yet the demographics of the patient population, or what the actual median OS will turn
out to be. A short position now is a bet that when those come to light, they will (1) show that IMBark is no better
than truly comparable historical controls, and (2) the market will actually understand this (or JNJ will walk away)
and react accordingly.


Given how willing the bulls are to ignore your assessment, I'd bet they'll ignore your analysis even if the facts come
out in your favor. And large companies have all kinds of (bad) reasons for not walking away from products when
they should. So the patient approach will be to wait for (1) to occur (significant derisking), and take a short position

when (2) does not follow immediately. Or if it's clear that GERN will continue on to a Phase 3 study, you could
short after this has built even more excitement for the stock.


In the meantime, though, no reason to fight the current excitement. If anything, waiting will let you get a better
price when you place your short bet.

dwarfing Micorosoft and IBM combined. I love seeing these old opinions again and that's what tells me I'm

That is the problem with incorrect Geron perceptions. Many uniformed purveyors extrapolate the old
Geron to the NEW Geron which has clearly demonstrated solid progression towards commercializing a
platform oncology drug. It takes about 10 years to get a successful drug to market and if you check the
timeline and the progress of the pre-clinicals and clinicals, this is likely a huge home run taking the market
unexpectedly like it has already started to do. The die hard Longs here are very happy even at these low
pps prices.

Bridge to sell
One of the reasons that I have been in Geron for all these many years is the high level of analysis and research
brought to bear by my 'friends' here in the SA comments section. To that end, and having done some digging of my
own, I'm happy to provide a link to the transcript from the lawsuit against Alpha Exposure for stock manipulation.
This is publicly available information.


The ultimate irony is that AE and his partners' defense is their First Amendment right to free speech and yet he is
the person threatening defamation of character here for anyone claiming he is a manipulator. You can't have it
both ways AE. You can't say things about people and companies and claim you are covered by freedom of speech
but then disregard that same right of others when they say something YOU disagree with.


I suggest we keep it safe and say that he is an 'accused manipulator' which is factually true. If you'd like to see the
exact extent with which AE and his partners are accused of lying I suggest you scroll down through the transcript
to page 40 and start off by reading the plaintiff's complaints. They are VERY elucidating. The attorney for the
plaintiff is Mr. Bowe and he does a good job of summarizing their position in just a few paragraphs.

Give the author a break and pay attention to what he has to say.


I was lucky enough to buy below 2 and sold my entire position Monday pre-market as I thought the run-up I saw
right then was not warranted .


I back a smaller size position at a price 15% less than my sale.


I thought the price would be some what range bound and sold a short term out of the money calls against the
entire position. If I get taken out (which seems likely at this point) I'll take the profit and be happy, otherwise over
the short term I will sell more short term calls at least through July expiration. I am guessing a decision by JNJ on
continuation will be in early to mid August..

Now this that said, I am trying to see if there is a good chance to .make money with options.


If the author is correct, this is going down to around $1 if JNJ does not exercise their option. {I am figuring that at
least for the short term the asset may still have some value and they might be able to partner it again for much
less generous terms with a midcap biotech company that might be hopeful of approval on one indication as JNJ
may not want it if they dont think it will get to annual sales of over 100 Million.

From the chart we can see that there are too many "censored" patients in patients with 100000 platelets, who
disappear from the trial, so they were kicked off the curve as a straight horizontal line. This has caused the other
surviving patients who are health and live longer to replace those censored patients. In other words the
Anderson's chart is not very high confidence in statistics term. It should not be compared with other less censored
trials.

Janssen maybe delayed the decision to watch the stunning MDS data play out. At first it wasn't much part of the

With the protocol specified primary analysis for IMbark expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018, we expect
Janssen to make its continuation decision by the end of the third quarter of 2018. Although the completion of the
protocol specified primary analysis for IMbark is the trigger for the continuation decision by Janssen, we expect
data from MDS - MDS from IMerge to contribute important information about imetelstat.

The study by Kate Newberry, Srdan Verstovsek and their MD Anderson colleagues revealed about one-third of the
patients who discontinued Jakafi for one reason or another had acquired High Molecular Risk mutations in other
genes. And over 60% of those mutations were in the dreaded ASLX-1 gene. Overall life expectancy for this group
was under 14 months.

Abe Raxas
"The evidence is circumstantial and far from decisive but compelling. These high molecular risk mutations
may indeed eventually appear in the MPN patient population but the relatively short time span in which
they arose in this patient population and the acquisition of these mutations by a large percentage of the
cohort — with nearly two-thirds of those mutations in ASXL-1 — argues for the possibility of clonal
evolution acceleration due to the drug."

I have a question about the Anderson's chart that shows No. at risk = 4 for the patients>= 100,000 platelet/ul , that
is 4/23 and supposed to be 0.17 median OS, not 0.5 median OS at 36 month time. It seems the chart commits a
mistake?


22 Mar 2018, 10:15 PM

I suspect that the median OS for patients >= 100000 platelet/ul is close to 16 months from the Anderson's
chart.

The author also conveniently excluded any consideration of the IMerge study results when determining
Imetelstat's value. In my opinion, the significance of Imetelstat's MDS opportunity in the EU alone will be enough to
justify JNJ's continuation decision and/or outright acquisition of Geron. It's hard to imagine such an astute investor
simply overlooked the very promising MDS data when determining Imetelstat's true value.

Alex Babel
A user on the GERN message board over at Yahoo Finances posted something in regards to this article. Thought
I’d share.


I had a good chuckle reading the Alpha Exposure’s short apologetics.


I hope he reads this. He asks why pts in the trial are limited to 10% blasts and 75,000/ul platelet count. Here’s why.
Blasts greater than 10% is an artifact pointing towards AML, as is also severely low platelet count. We already
know Imet doesn’t work as a single agent in AML, so why on Earth would you select for pts presenting AML-like
conditions? Also, cytopenias are one of the adverse effects of Imet, and they occur b/c Imet is destroying the

https://seekingalpha.com/user/23437493

https://seekingalpha.com/author/hoosier-investor

https://seekingalpha.com/user/49303397
proliferating cancer cells. So why would you put pts with very low platelet counts on a drug that could press
thrombocytopenia even further? By the way, all adverse events on Imet are reversible by simple dose and
schedule modification.


Either Alpha Exposure has no idea what he’s talking about, or he’s a short seller standing on the edge of a very tall
cliff.


Here’s another knee-slapper of Alpha Exposure’s. He asks why very sickly pts with ECOG over 2 are excluded.
Well, let me explain. ECOG 2 doesn’t mean those pts are healthy. ECOG 2 patients can be extremely sick, but still
capable of walking. We are talking about R/R pts, after all. In fact, ECOG isn’t an actual metric of health at all. It’s a
GENERALIZED system of categorizing the state of the diseased patient, with ANY disease. How far does a
generalized system go towards relevance in SPECIFIC diseases? THAT’S Alpha Exposure’s red flag? Seriously?
ECOG? Laughable.


Imbark is geared towards MF pts R/R to Rux, inter alia. The trial is designed to help THOSE people, not all “ECOG
3” pts, not AML pts, not hepatitis pts, not people with sinus infections.


And the lower dose arm pts having OS benefit doesn’t detract from Imet’s efficacy. I laughed out loud at that one.
Also, the 4.7 group isn’t a good placebo b/c obviously placebos should be an inert oligo... not the actual
experimental drug.


Lastly, Alpha Exposure doesn’t seem to understand what a median means. He wrote, “Because the median
platelet count in the paper was so close to the allowed lower bound in the IMbark trial, a substantial portion of the
patients followed in the MD Anderson paper would have been ineligible for Imbark.” In other words, a substantial
portion of pts WOULD be eligible. This is getting long, so I’ll let Alpha Exposure figure that one out.


So... Alpha Exposure, looks like you’ll have to dig up something else besides ECOG. And you did realize this was
a trial for R/R MF pts? Maybe you can look for what brand latex gloves they’re using at the clinical sites? Could
that be the fatal flaw in Imbark’s design?


The OS signal is real. It’s unprecedented. It’s significant. Deal with it. Presenting a weak argument against Imet,
despite the overwhelming strength of the data to date, across the total program, only makes Alpha Exposure look
even more desperate. If there’s a legitimate problem with Imbark, you should have found something more
significant than ECOG.


22 Mar 2018, 07:30 PM


jxiao8423
Alex -- This is probably the best rebuttal so far. Majority of others are just attacks. (You could lose your
attacks as well. It doesn't help.) Now the question to you, Alex, given the trial population (>75K/ul, excl.
ECOG >2), what should be the right benchmark for OS? 7 months? 14-15 months? Was the company
correct in their presentation on this?

Alex Babel
Competitors to Geron have an OS of anywhere from 7-9 months. In my opinion, the competitor’s
benchmark should be the correct benchmark for a drug that’s marketed as unprecedented.


In an incomplete clinical trial, I think it’s difficult to determine what the final OS would be, but they can still
ballpark it based on how many patients are still alive. However, according to their earnings call earlier in
the week, median OS hasn’t been reached yet after 19 months. That, to me, is extremely noteworthy.


Was the company correct in their presentation on this? I think that’ll become evident at the upcoming world
health conference that Geron is officially scheduled to present at. After that presentation, not only will
investors have GERN under a microscope, but so will scientists around the world as well.

In ~5 minutes of time, I was able to determine only 11% (12 of 107) of the patients in the above cited "well known
study" discontinued their JAK inhibitor treatment due to 'Progressive Disease'.


This seems a very important data point since other well known studies (JAKARTA-2) have concluded the
'Progressive Disease' myelofibrosis patients are the least likely to respond to further treatment. Thus, the
percentage of 'Progressive Disease' patients seems a very important statistic when attempting to compare trial
populations, patient 'sickness' levels, and median OS.


This leads us to an important question regarding the IMbark trial:


Q: What percentage patients experienced 'Progressive Disease' prior to their enrollment in the IMbark trial?
A: 100%. Documented progressive disease during or after JAK inhibitor therapy was part of the IMbark enrollment
criteria.

Most new investors are somewhat incredulous that this kind of sophisticated MO exists, distorting bio-
technical data analysis; consequently they are caught unawares. It makes investors gunshy, lose
conviction and question legitimate, authoritative professional assessment. Sounds like a good SEC case
for prosecuting stock manipulation for obvious reasons.


I seem to recall there was also a time interval required after discontinuation of the jak inhibitor, prior to
beginning patient dosing in the Imbark trial.

Curiosity Killed The Cat, Contributor
True story.


Back on Oct 21, 2014, Nathaniel August, founder of Mangrove Partners, goes live on CNBC with his top short
pick, WWE. http://cnb.cx/2FZQ5UT


At the time, WWE had recently launched its live streaming Over-The-Top network and Mr. August’s explained to
the CNBC host that WWE would need to at least double its subscriber base from the then existing 700k to even
justify its current market cap and that it was “never” going to happen. In response to that short call, WWE dropped
4% to close the day $12.51. The stock price then proceeded to rise straight up over the next few years to its
current price of $38 as Over-The-Top became one of the largest live streaming networks in the USA with more
than 1.5 million paid subscribers. http://bit.ly/2IHk0D8


At the time, Vince McMahon, founder, and CEO of WWE, was asked by a business reporter from local Stamford
newspaper The Advocate, what he thought about Mr. August, Mangrove Partners, and Mr. August’s claim that
WWE would “never” be able to double its Over-The-Top subscriber base. Mr. McMahon replied (link unavailable –
subscribers only), “Show me a picture of this August guy.” The reporter obliged and brought up Mangrove Partners
website and showed Mr. McMahon a picture of Mr. August, whereupon Mr. McMahon exclaimed, “F*** this pencil
neck geek!.”


BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!...


The moral: Mangrove Partners, like all of us, is entitled to voice its opinions. But those opinions are not always
correct.

Geron Corporation Stock Still a Strong Buy?
What happened


Geron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN), a small-cap clinical-stage biotech, saw its shares rise by as much as
33.8% in early-morning trading today. Although its stock has cooled off somewhat in the interim, Geron's shares
are still up by a healthy 14.8% as of 1:48 p.m. EDT Thursday.


The apparent reason for this continued surge is an all-out exodus by short-sellers. As proof, Geron's stock is up on
a monstrous 15 times the average daily volume today.

So what


This purported short squeeze is likely being driven by two factors:


Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Geron's blood cancer collaboration for the telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, is
potentially producing unprecedented clinical benefits for patients with both advanced myelofibrosis and
myelodyspastic syndromes. 
Geron's stock crossed over the pivotal $5 mark today. By doing so, the biotech's stock is now marginable, and a
larger swath of institutional investors can buy its shares. 
Taken together, these two factors should be enough to make short-sellers rethink their position.


Now what


Previously, J&J has suggested that it may apply for a regulatory approval for imetelstat in advanced myelofibrosis
before year's end. The good news is that imetelstat's overall survival curve for this unmet medical need seems to
warrant an accelerated approval -- even without an active comparator arm or a placebo-controlled trial.


The fact of the matter is that myelofibrosis patients have no viable treatment options, and imetelstat appears to be
extending their lifespans in a clinically meaningful way.


What does this all mean? My guess is that Geron's stock will continue to tick higher in the months ahead until
imetelstat's top-line data are released. If positive -- and the trend is favorable -- I think Geron can easily reach $20
a share. However, this stock remains a high-risk growth play, and investors shouldn't risk more than they are
willing to lose.

Who is Mangrove Partners:


"Cutting-edge treatments for diseases affecting millions of Americans are threatened by Wall Street’s latest
moneymaking scheme. The ploy: Hedge funds bet against a drug company’s stock price, launch attacks against
the firm’s patents on its best-selling medicines and then reap windfall profits when investors panic and the stock
price plummets....The Mangrove Partners Master Fund acquired a 270,000-share “short” position in VirnetX, which
owns patents for a Internet-privacy technology. Within weeks of filing two reviews against VirnetX patents,
Mangrove unwound its short position, profiting from an 8 percent drop in the stock price.


Although these reviews can be filed against any patent, they’re particularly threatening to medicine patents and the
companies that own them. David Winwood, an executive at Louisiana State University’s Biomedical Research
Center, explains that “most often, a startup company’s sole asset is a patent application or issued patent, upon
which the company’s fortune lays.”

The timing of the article seems to suggest SA is complicit in supporting the shorts as another poster has
suggested. Generally authors of articles can’t determine when their articles are published. This one
appeared right at the time GERN was trading up with great momentum toward $7 and the article appeared
and stopped the upward momentum right on its track. This timing couldn’t be accidental. Still the fact
GERN traded the rest of the day in positive territory in a terrible stock market meltdown day speaks a lot to
its strength since data was released. These concerted efforts by shorts could only temporarily slow down
GERN upward movement yesterday. It will resume in days to come.

to compare since you are not comparing apples to apples. These are different patients populations and different
adjunct medications. Another point to address within your write up is the quote that the 4.7 mg/kg arm was
essentially placebo. That those patients who achieved a response must not have been as sick since they
responded to what you consider a placebo or "placebo effect. What you fail to include in your analysis is
information on patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency which would in fact cause the therapy to remain in
circulation longer and have a higher therapeutic impact. Any therapy that extends the life a terminally ill patients is
most likely to get approved. Janssen is king of mining data to support an approval.

TMFBudwell is being very conservative. The potential is easily triple digits. There is a reason why JNJ has
delayed the milestone payments. It would immediately spike GERN's revenues which in turn would cause
the share price to spike much more rapidly. Many investors don't even look at a stock until it's not only
making money, but the quarterly increases have been significant and sustained for several quarters.
GERN may not be a free agent long enough for that to happen. The potential is in the hundreds of billions
of dollars and yet the entire market cap is sitting at just over $1 Billion right now. GERN has more like
AMGN or CELG potential at minimum, it's many times more valuable than INCY and that is around 20
Billion. If you fear a drop in price, consider to buy OTM PUT options. If you think the price will wildly swing,
consider setting up an options spread to catch it both ways, while protecting your principal.

Incorrect. The FDA only approves drugs and devices. It does not approve clinical trials. There are no
winks, there are no nods.

"It does not approve clinical trials."


on the whole, they do. all trials have to pass muster with regard to endangering patients; that's been true
from the beginning of the FDA. with the 1962 amendments, FDA is responsible for judging efficacy as well.
some sponsors, some times, submit a SPA, and there FDA makes a specific assessment of the trial's
outcome and offers a **non-binding** agreement of approval if the outcomes are met. there are further
niches in the process, but FDA is involved, more or less, in the structure of trials. they publish many
documents on the subject.

BuyersStrikeWP
The FDA can reject an IND, the FDA can halt a trial (for safety) but the FDA in no way APPROVES trials.


An SPA can be granted based on the proposed study DESIGN. But that does not mean the trial is
APPROVED in any way by the FDA. That is not their job, it is not what they do.


Once a company has an "accepted" (not APPROVED) IND, the company can run any trial it wants, no
matter how silly. The government only steps in at that point due to safety issues that might pop up.


Efficacy is judged by the FDA during the approval process, not during the trials.


23 Mar 2018, 03:55 PM


cucumberbatch
"But that does not mean the trial is APPROVED in any way by the FDA. "


well, if the design is what is approved, what else is there?


23 Mar 2018, 04:18 PM


BuyersStrikeWP
An SPA is not an APPROVAL. The FDA might agree to an SPA, but that is not an approval. Approval has a
very specific meaning with regards to drugs and devices.


At its most basic an SPA is a non-binding agreement that says, "If your study proves X, and adheres to
design Y, then we will do Z" nothing more.


It does not mean the FDA "likes" your drug or device. It means that the study you proposed, if successful
and if run according to the submitted plan, will provide enough data to make an approval decision. It does
not guarantee an APPROVAL. It is non-binding.


24 Mar 2018, 08:29 PM


cucumberbatch
"An SPA is not an APPROVAL."


oh my sainted aunt. I never said it was an approval of, or even predilection towards, a drug. the issue is
whether FDA has *any* input into trial design and execution. they do. they publish copious documents on
clinical trial requirements; they aren't just whistling. an SPA is a stronger approval of design, but still non-
binding, as I said. the issuance of CRL ("we need further data", and the like) is proof that FDA doesn't like
your design.

What The Stock
"Since Geron and Janssen determined the 4.7mg/kg arm was ineffective, then we should expect the 9.4mg/kg arm
to outperform on a survival basis, but we haven't seen that yet, as indicated in their press release which stated:
"the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm." Since the 4.7mg/kg arm was enrolled on
average earlier than the 9.4mg/kg arm, a best case would be equivalent survival rates between the arms."


Can't wrap my head around this comparison as justification of the short. You cannot statistically compare two
numbers that don't exist. To conclude that that means the doses perform the same is erroneous.


22 Mar 2018, 03:00 PM


Anonymous Wizard
AE has to assume that the trial close date is the very best median OS of Both Arms and that cannot be
assumed at all at this point and seems incongruent to what Geron IR told us and is not supported by the
protocol amendment to follow safety and OS as long as it takes.

Mangrove make up your mind first you want the hospice patient included in the trial then you want those who are
not intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis to be used as the bar for OS. You are comparing apples to oranges.
The only study that you use is the MD Anderson study of 58 post rux patients and included patients that are not
Intermediate 2 or high-risk. The other study which fits tis population better had an OS of 14 months we are at 19
month OS and counting.

time mutational events were also being discovered and evaluated.


That JNJ applied for a recent patent to treat lymphcytic malignancies with an Imet/Venetoclax combo, as well as

Plunge back down into your hole gopher. You have no credibility here.


1) Geron Janssen filed to extending the trial so patients can stay on Imetelstat.


What do your short pants tell you about that?


2) They took patients who failed Jakafi!
3) Median OS not met!!!!!
4) Those In 4.7 arm who chose to stay on that dose surprised Janssen because they are STILL on that
dose. They HAVE to be getting a benefit ... otherwise why stay on it?
5) 4.7 arm not a placebo ... OS HAS been extended, as per the call.
6) Large unmet need in MDS (go listen to Dr Raza’a presentation). Not even mentioned.


Just to name a few.

The IMbark study obviously does not meet efficacy, but may or may not prolong survival. The IMerge study during
the ASH conference, P2, 54% of Lenalidomide naive patients no longer needs transfusion. MDS have a much
bigger population. GERN will be adding 20 patients first to the 32, and my calculation should provide results in Q3
2018 for the expanded results. 
With their continuous disclosure, the drug seems to work in MDS patients, who doesnt have a lot of options (since
Len only works with 5q deletion patients, which is 10% of MDS patients), side effects disclosed were more
manageable than Lenalidomide. It is reasonable to assume it's going to P3 in Q3.

When did complete and partial remissions mean no efficacy? Mayo pilot patients are now likely in a

Delmar Price, Contributor
Prolonging survival is efficacious don't you think?


22 Mar 2018, 01:51 PM


Homedicare
There is a reason IMbark Primary efficacy is spleen response rate and symptoms control, while the
Secondary efficacy is overall survival. (please refer to their website on IMbark) In MF patients, surviving
longer is not as important, especially if they are too weak to even care for themselves. Imagine you are too
weak to type on a keyboard but survive longer.


Which was why last year J was considering termination. Of cos the good IMerge results make all these
moot. All these discussions about overall survival miss the point by both longs and shorts.

I appreciate the arguments in this short article. I've been pondering these myself (as noted in some of my prior
posts). I like to read both the potential pros and cons of an investment.....just to make sure I am not blinded one
way or the other.


Related to this.....if ultimately the FDA finds the imetelstat data actually has a high likelihood of extending
life....which dose should the FDA approve? At this point, what compelling reason is there to go with 9.4? 4.7 would,
it seems, be safer. No evidence of a different median OS yet between doses.....


So this would lead one to believe JNJ/GERN picked the wrong primary endpoint(s) and closed a dose because it
"does not warrant further investigation" that we are now arguing is efficacious? We should be mad at JNJ/GERN
more than anyone for these errors!

AE. You do make some interesting points that I do not see refuted in the above comments. However, if results thus
far have been as negative as you claim here, please explain why the FDA would give Imetelstate Fast Track
Designation. Also explain why J&J recently listed it as one of its top drug candidates.


22 Mar 2018, 12:07 PM


NJLorelei
More to the point, the FDA was recently given data on IMET's efficacy in MF. BOTTOM LINE: This trial
would not be continuing if efficacy had not been demonstrated to FDA's satisfaction. Despite all the bio
research skills Phil (the author) acquired at Wharton, he has not picked up on something that the FDA
missed. As demonstrated by his last three articles, Phil is indeed grasping at proverbial straws. I am
always interested in a good short thesis to challenge my long thesis, but this ain't it.


22 Mar 2018, 12:50 PM


Curion
7 month median OS is most likely for the patients with ASXL1 mutation. For the rest it appears to be 16 months
after discontinuation from Jakafi. Since the trial is not actively excluding the ASXL1 patients, the numbers from
IMBARK look impressive. In addition I don't believe Janssen would waste time extending the trial in 2016 & 2017 if
it didn't clearly demonstrate some meaningful survival benefit.


22 Mar 2018, 12:06 PM

No. Here is where the 7 months come from: "7 months median OS after discontinuation from ruxolitinib

Price target for buyout $16. price target for royalties $12

Sounds good for the royalties part, not so excited for the buyout part, they are potentially worth much
much more. Where did you get those numbers?

INCY currently trading around $18 billion dollars. Believe a low buyout price would be around $5 billion or
about $31 per share. A $16 billion buyout of GERN will have a stock price of $100 per share. Good luck to
all longs.

In just MF alone, Geron can assume at 45% Profit, most of the MF market eventually. MDS fronline for
IMET is 3 to 4 times the market for MF. Then add in AML and that's not even beginning to address all the
potential of IMET as a platform ingredient. Why in the world would anyone want a buyout at $16. If
handled correctly by investors and Geron, this stock has a very huge upside potential but not overnight.
We want a long run on this stock to build value before any buyout.

1) Why do you believe that the trial population in the BLOOD article is comparable or sicker than the population in
IMbark?

OK. I'll bite:


JnJ just recently sent the FDA data on efficacy. If, as is your thesis, IMET is not demonstrating efficacy,
why has the FDA allowed the trial to continue? Or did the FDA miss your red flags? If you know something
the FDA doesn't, don't post it to SA send a letter to the FDA and get the trial shut down. I guarantee to you
that would achieve your desired result.

The premise of your entire article is that OS isn't as profound as holders of Geron stock anticipate. And the
fulcrum upon which your article rests, is an "estimation" from an analyst at Stifel -- not an oncologist, not
even a scientist, but an investment firm, and one with no greater information than any of the rest of us
have and one you portray it as fact. Only JnJ/Janssen and Geron have any clue what the OS might be.
Only JnJ/Janssen and Geron know how well each individual arm of the study is doing, yet you present
your opinions as fact. Finally, only JnJ/Janssen know what the overall make up of population is. The take
away from Imbark is that patients who are R/R to Jakafi AND HAVE NO OTHER OPTION will find overall
survival longer by taking Imetelstat. That point you didn't disprove, only obfuscated. The reading between
the lines on Imbark, is that were Imetelstat to be a frontline treatment, rather than secondary, a lot more
patients who are easier to treat would live considerably longer without having had their lives shortened by
taking Jakafi (three recent studies have come out showing Jakafi actually reduces a patient's OS while
only offering pallative results). The entirety of your article is an speculation supporting an opinion.
Numbers dressed up as facts. You even suggest the 4.7 arm IS OUTLIVING the 9.4 without any sort of
citation. Geron is notoriously tight-lipped to the irritation of shareholder yet you seem to have more
information than the conference call gave. You asked one vague question at the conference call and
crafted an argument around it. The opinion OS isnt as great as shareholders think is fine, but you have
made zero arguments based on information released from Geron. We'll find out soon enough whether the
OS is 19, 25, or even indeterminate (my guess) and whether the patients were very sick, kind of sick, or

How many times have we heard that these R/R jak patients are very sick with a typical 7 month lifespan
once they entered the trial per JNJ ? Now to sell OS clearly as very significant, JNJ has gone to greeat
lengths to search all possible databases and academia to obtain worst case OS figures for R/R MF for
historical comparisons. JNJ/Geron have no problem it seems whatso ever allowing the worst case of 14 to
16 months. Now that's something to really pay attention to IMO. Not to some how try to say there is no OS
benefit just because the low-dose ARM enrolled sooner then the 9.4 ARM completed enrollment and that
AE is assuming the median OS is reached in 2nd quarter based on nothing. I think as usual, Scarlett will
clear up these deliberate attempts to deceive at the Needham Investor Conference. One of the problems
is that besides Geron/Janssen keeping the details close to their chest, is that Scarlett often speaks in a
confusing way where shorts can play with what he says in the abscence of openess of data. As always,
these false rumors melt away once he clarifies everything with some help from the conference host.


23 Mar 2018, 04:10 AM


Volumelogic
Your arguments are without merit.


- "If imetelstat had a positive impact on overall survival, we would expect the 9.4mg/kg dose arm to have
outperformed the ineffective 4.7mg/kg arm." Since neither arm has reached median overall survival, your
statement makes no sense. At this point we can not say which arm produced superior results. What we see is both
doses producing a positive survival benefit which is what we would hope to see at this point with an effective drug.


- "We believe the IMbark patient population was more similar to the >100,000/ul population in the MD Anderson
trial than the <100,000/ul population." As platelet count data hasn't been released by Geron, you should be honest
and admit you hold this opinion with no basis in fact. You have plucked numbers out of the air that support your
short thesis and give the impression of a reasoned analysis, but there is no foundation - it is a guess.


- "We are short Geron with a targeted return of 90%." How much money have you lost so far on this very poorly
timed trade? Do you have a stop in place or have you bet the house?

75k platlet count was the allowable. The idea of the patients being healthier after failing on jakafi is pretty
ridiculous when you look at the allowable platelet count. This guy killed the rally but this investment is still
solid gold.


22 Mar 2018, 11:49 AM


Alpha Exposure, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Your arguments here fail. We know that the company expects to reach median OS in the
9.4 arm in Q2 and this means there's (at best) no difference between the 4.7 and 9.4 arms and it's
possible that 4.7 will underperform


From Blood, we know that about half of patients have a platelet count above 100k and it was seen as low
as 11k in the article for the cutoff to be a minimum of 75k means that the vast majority of patients probably
came with 100k+ and it means that the sickest portion of the patients in the < 100k group were excluded.

On your second point, why did you say he pulled it out of air? Allowable was 75K (minimum). It's not far
stretched to say the average for the trial is above 100K/ul (unless everyone in the trial is close to 75K and
not many above 100K -- what are the odds), right? Just math.

their study population. As person who has real familiarity and knowledge how that process goes, I know
that is a lie. If you have such an intimate knowledge of what selection criteria's used, you would be either
trading on insider information, or you really would like to go to jail. So what is it?
You misinforming your readers who unfortunately do not understand realities of clinical studies, and early
small biotech word, by knowingly feeding them misleading information. You completely dismissing the
facts, facts shared by MD Anderson Cancer center, in relatively recent article about Jak inhibitors,
interferons, and other potential targets. You avoid addressing facts, such as their follow up survival data
already better then anything out there on the market. 
You make judgments, on JNJ decision, which is clearly our own highly subjective opinion, because again
you can't speak for JNJ. Otherwise you would be sharing insider trade like information, or which is likely a
case, you again lying here.
There is also another thing, I know how much time it takes relatively small project to be approved by all big
bosses in the global company. JNJ is much bigger than my current company, so I could even venture to
state, that maybe buyout already in the discussion, but it just did not received Mr. Gorsky approval. I am
sure none of his subordinates would want to loose their fancy job, because they spend company money
without his approval.
I despise liars, and it makes me laugh, when people here who clearly can't read and interpret medical
data, invest in small biotech company, which has not even done with its phase 3 study. 
It is inherently dangerous to invest this way. Do not believe me, look up story and read up on opthotech
technology and fovista and how their phase 3 studies destroyed a great product. Product that would
dominate its field.

"You are choosing to focus on a single outdated trial...


And you are choosing to focus on a single follow-up study, even though you mention there are now
multiple studies, to support your thesis that IMbark patients, because of minimum platelet and ECOG
requirements, are less sick.


Regarding platelets, there has to be some baseline cutoff. Even INCY, in its frontline COMFORT I and II
studies, had a cutoff of a minimum 100,000/microliter (IMbark accepted sicker patients with a minimum of
75,000/microliter).


COMFORT I: http://bit.ly/2FUEE4W
COMFORT 2: http://bit.ly/2ugbZBM


Regarding ECOG scores, COMFORT I and II allowed patients with ECOG's up to 3, while IMBARK up to 2
– but for a simple reason. If you are level 3 and homebound, you would still be able to participate in the
ruxolitinib trials because you are simply taking a pill administered at home. With imetelstat, you need to be

JNJ felt that the 7 months was more applicable to their CT. However, they need to provide evidence to the
FDA so they then took a worst case convoluted anderson study. As their search for any kind of
comparisons they turned up the three academia papers and are more than willing to raise the bar to a
worst case scenario of 14 to 16 months. So what does that tell ya ? It tells you that they are confident of
blowing median OS away and that is the plan to show there is no question about OS and trying to apply
ECOG got you laughed at by Scarlett in the Conference. Do you enjoy looking like THE FOOL ?

You try to twist it but not flying. They are searching high and low so no surprises and they turned up these
three addition papers so they are including them as an OS comparison for R/R MF and they have no
issues using them as a worst case rather than pushing 7 months. It should tell all investors that
JNJ/Janssen is not concerned at all about the 14 to 16 months as they are already beyond 19 months and
they can see the rate of deaths and have openly stated that they amended the protocol so they can
continue to treat and follow remaining patients for safety and median OS. If median OS goes on for years,
they still need to close the trial sometime. The 24 month mark for OS coincides with final reports being
done in Both IMBARK and IMERGE so that JNJ can make a descision. All very very encouraging and no
bad news in sight at all.

Even if your analysis was correct, it would be too early to determine if your conclusions are correct. Until
the median survival is determined, you can't say if it is effective or not.

I can tell you why 4.7 isn't a good proxy for placebo. The treatment format allows dose reduction for
tolerability. So those levels are strictly nominal, Read them as "up to 4.7" and "up to 9.4." Without a lot
more data than has been publicly releases, we can't even be sure that the ongoing dosage at the two
nominal levels was different.

Author’s reply »  4.7 arm was discontinued for lack of efficacy. Something that is not effective is either (1)
proxy for placebo or (2) hurting people. Either way, the fact that the 4.7 arm is not at its median OS (and its
median OS should be greater than the 9.4 arms because it stopped enrolling sooner) means that there is

The fact that it was determined that the 4.7mg was not effective tells me that the patients in the 4.7 mg

That conclusion was made more than one year ago. It is possible that the effects of 4.7mg had not kicked
in back then yet. Apparently many patients/physicians saw that it is working and decided to stay put. As
time goes on, the drug started to having an effect and result in longer survival after Sept. 2016. As a result,
the mOS for the 4.7mg arm has not reached yet.


Maybe both doses work just fine, or it is possible that the 9.4mg dose does better eventually.


I am still not sure if there are actually three arms by now: 9.4mg all along; 4.7mg all along; and 4.7mg first,
then 9.4mg.

I agree with your point about the 4.7 dose cohort. The company announced earlier they were discontinuing
it due to ineffectiveness but if true why are some patients still on it and why is that groups OS median yet

consistent with Imetelstat progressively shortening Telomeres and at lower doses just taking longer for

@Alpha Exposure


The 4.7 arm was discontinued for lack of efficacy vis-a-vis the primary endpoint of spleen reduction. For
that matter, the 9.7 arm was also discontinued for the same lack of efficacy based on predetermined trial
parameters. However, neither was discontinued for lack of efficacy vis-a-vis OS. Which is where we stand
now. Waiting. So it's incorrect to consider the 4.7 to be a proxy for placebo for OS. And we know it's not
hurting people or the trial would have been stopped.

Thanks cktc -- spleen size is not the important measure, keeping very ill patients alive and allowing

No position on the stock. But the "ineffective" conclusion is based on spleen volume et al, NOT on OS. so
call the arm "ineffective" is irrelevent on OS. So you are misleading here.

You're focused on Overall Survival -- which is good, but remember back then they were focused on spleen
size reduction and the primary endpoint. It is highly likely that 4.7mg wasn't as effective in reducing the
spleen size. After 12 weeks survival differences were likely not visible -- or on top of mind for the
investigators.

In addition to what others have mentioned regarding spleen size endpoints vs overall survival...


We must remember the importance of “intention to treat” (ITT) analysis vs “per protocol” analysis. 
If a number of patients from the 4.7 dosing arm did indeed cross over to the 9.4 dosing arm, then the
relative differences in outcomes between the two groups would certainly be reduced. Those that had
started in the 4.7 dosing arm would now be mirroring the therapy of the 9.4 dosing arm, but their data
would still be recorded in the 4.7 cohort for “ITT” statistical analysis. Why? Because the initial groups were
randomized to reduce bias. Switching them to per protocol analysis and including them instead in the 9.4

https://seekingalpha.com/user/15618432
cohort could introduce unexpected bias into the results. Most studies stick to intention to treat analysis for
this reason.
Nobody knows what a “meaningful number” of the 4.7 cohort remaining in that dose is. Did 20% stay on
4.7? Is that meaningful? How about 40%? He certainly didn’t say the ‘majority’ of patients remained in the
4.7 arm.


In my eyes, the fact that both groups are surviving beyond 19 months does not discredit either study arm
and may in fact be a result of a migration of the initial 4.7 arm onto the treatment track of the 9.4 arm. If
nothing else it remains a very good outcome for the drug.


Taken together with others’ comments on the prior emphasis on spleen size vs the current emphasis on
OS, I think the negatives you have brought up are overblown. Just my two cents. Always good to have a
critical mind and ask questions though. 
Good luck to all.

Because you are not privy to any real details about the 4.7 ARM other than a generalization at the 12-
week interim period and that Neither ARM has reached median OS as of the 19 month mark in Jan. 2018.
You haven't a clue of what CI's and to what degree have been achieved thus far and because I do believe
we can get a better control arm by going head-to-head against jakafi, the palliative bag of blood spleen
drug, that only helps some patients for a small window of time. The control arm should be the leading
treatment (only well practiced treatment) of jakafi and then your nonsense stops (you and your obvious
little minion).
We won't know until we see the details if the 4.7 dose can possibly be any kind of control. Maybe it cold be
another ARM has IMET has alot of apparent properties for allowing a stepped-down doseage and as a
maintenance drug.

How do you imagine "up to the dosage". The protocol calls for flexibility in dosages bertween 4.7 and 9.4
as needed but the ARMS were designed with 4.7 and 9.4 doseages and could at discretion be adjusted
within the range but not outside the range. 4.7 was declared as the minimal dose or as I call it a zero
reference point. Normally, you wouldn't want to use this ARM anyway if it getting long-term good CIs and
exended OS. The fact that Neither ARM has reach median OS yet is a good thing ONLY !

Wrong ! We are hearing that the 4.7 ARM is quite possibly showing a longer term benefit and we always
suspected that a 12-week peek was not long enough. It makes sense it could take longer at a half dose as
well. The 9.4 dose ARM is likely going to extend OS far out beyond the closing of the IMBARK CT and the
4.7 dose ARM we can't be sure of how far it would go but the fact that Both ARMS are seeing survfivalk
benefit beyond the worst cases that JNJ can dig up tells us alot. Scarlett remarked that they are digging
deep and that's how they dug up the the three academia papers. They are being conservative and
applying the worst case OS to beat.


23 Mar 2018, 12:01 AM


Anonymous Wizard
Distortion: Both ARMS halted enrollment and they simply had 10 patients in the queue for the 9.4 group
that still had not been infused and moved into the 9.4 ARM so they felt they had enough patients in totality
with moving to the separately tracked converted group and the 9.4 ARM.


However, what we heard now is that a "meaningful number" of 4.7 patients did not covert to 9.4 for
whatever reason so the 4.7 ARM apparently became meaningful again and tracked and over a long time
period beyond that first 12-week peek, they apparently are seeing something meaningful. That was a good
surprise that the 4.7 ARM had not reached median OS yet and by logical extrapolation and past
experience from the Mayo Pilot, we can expect the 9.4 ARM to have a longer median OS and we received
some feedback from IR that is the case. Furthermore, although we and You cannot be sure at all, the low-
dose 4.7 ARM seems to indicate that quite possibly based on the rate of deaths, that they may be
projecting a 24 month median survival I suspect for the 4.7 ARM. We can all play guessing games but
clearly, we are only hearing good information and your falsifications and misleading the public won't fly.
You are not going to stop this stock now. There are many good catalysts potentially and likely in the next 6
months tic-tock. The 9.4 ARM is likely going to extend substantially beyond the closing of the CT and that
we also had hints from IR. Rather than falsly distorting and misleading for you own self interest, we are
very likely going to see a shorter median OS than the 9.4 ARM and we are likely going to see better CIs
for the 9.4 ARM which pattern follows thew Mayo Pilot where doses were stepped up and stepped down
and intervals lengthened. However, I think we see some CIs and decent OS extension for the 4.7 ARM
now and that will come in handy for stepping down doseages, improving drug costs and applying likely in a
frontline MF application. There is not much question that IMET will knock jakafi out of the way and I can't
wait to see it. Now that doesn't even include the IMERGE MDS trial with also never before seen results
that we are waiting to reaffirm before going into the Part 2/Phase 3 and that market is 3 to 4 times larger
than MF not to mention that JNJ is likely to go in to an AML p2/PS3 combo trial once they continue. there
is no way JNJ backs out of this Agreement and gives up exclusive rights.

Clearly you are trying to distort with only what they new far back in time at a 12 week peek just like then
they had to admit they picked the wrong "spleen primary endpoint" and set the bar too high relative to
anyone else. Times have changed and they have learned alot and now they are clearly seeing clinical
benefits by going far beyond just 12 weeks due to thew fact that a meaningful number of 4.7 patients did
not switch over to the full dose. So in hindsight, those statements were premature and now they are
seeing surprisingly the longer term effects of IMET which we have seen before in the mayo Pilot.

The whole spleen endpoint has distorted the field because it is really just a symptom specific to jakafi
because that's its main effect which is palliative or more significant than anything else it could do in a world
have no competition at the time. So it flew at the time through the FDA. In today's environment, Incyte
would never get spleen size as a dominant MF endpoint. Fast forward to modern times, and meaningful
endpoints like OS benefit is much more relevant to patients for curing solutuions versus only mostly a
palliative drug like jakafi.

to SA, I copied/saved what I just tried to post. First as a wireless tech founder/owner and later as an investor in a
biotech company, I have had motivation and occasion to work closely with the SEC and others, (FBI, US Attry), in
high profile cases of 'behind the curtain' manipulation. I was directly responsible for building a case against some
heavy players who ended up in the Fed Pen.
The worst offenders/most arrogant got 20 years with no parole. Doubt me? You can read about it.

I've done business with Charles Schwab for 30 years. But today, first time EVER, they offer me money to lend
shares of my stocks for shorts. I own LOTS of Geron so I can only assume that the shorts are out there trying to
free up shares to save their arses.


NFW I'm lending ANY of my shares for shorts. Rot in Hell you bastardos ! 
This should be an indication that many are still severely trapped. Let's all pay them back in spades for all the years
of grief they've given Geron investors, All the patients lives and misery they have cost, for causing the FDA Holds,
and for every single time we have good news, interfering with the PPS and the stocks success. Without their
criminality, this stock would be at $20.

Great post.


Q: Did you do anything special to prevent them from being loaned in the first place?


I recently placed GTC limit sell orders ($35/share) on my shares at TDAmeritrade in hopes of preventing
them from being loaned-out for shorting. Anybody know for sure if this is effective method, or have specific
experience with TDAmeritrade on this topic?


Nice to hear there's some stress on the short side of Geron.


31 Mar 2018, 09:07 AM


Bridge to sell
Hoosier, I've been trying to get a definitive answer on this as well. Now having read up extensively, it
appears that the only guaranteed way to prevent lending is to switch to a cash account.


About 2 years ago I contacted TD and asked to mark my account as non-hypothecating but they told me
they could not do that for a margin account. GTC orders do not earmark your SPECIFIC shares, only
shares held in your broker's general share pool.


Conceivably, those shares could be allocated elsewhere before your sell price is reached. So essentially
they could be lent out if the math suggests there will be plenty of time to recover them before your sell
price triggers a sale.

account. I've never felt confident or savvy enough to engage in options or margin trading, so I only use the
account to buy/hold/sell common shares based on available cash balances. I will call them next week to
see if I can switch the account to a non-margin cash account in hopes of preventing my shares from being
loaned out.


Thanks again for the detailed feedback.

Well, that was an easy change to make. I called the TDA 24/7 client services line, and they made the
change to 'cash account' for me. They also informed me that I could've made the change online as well.
The change should be effective within a couple of business days.


I'm not in the same ballpark as PTCA, Wiz, Ed, and Ed's clients with regard to share count, but I'll sure
sleep better knowing I've done my part to prevent my shares from being used against us by those wishing
failure upon the drug & company. I erroneously though my GTC limit order would do the trick, so I'm very
appreciative of Wiz and Secret-third-Arm's (Mike?) feedback on the topic.

STA, your comment rings true with what I researched a few years ago. At the end of the day, the only way
to keep your shares from being lended out is to have them in a non margin account.

NO Question whatsoever in my mind who caused the FDA HOLDS right after the Tefferi Abstract release.
You all know the pattern don't you ? As soon as there is ANY good Geron news, they attack almost
immediately. There are those that live under rose colored glasses that never believed the FDA HOLDS
were caused by special interests but I think we've all seen enough evidence now to see the truth.

Let me add to the confusion. I have A Schwab account and hold alot of GERN. GERN stock is not
margineable per Schwab and has a 100% requirement (risk factors). So although I've been on margin in
my account for over a decade (I wouldn't have it any other way and I maximize my leverage), I have to pay
for GERN dollar for dollar. Has nothing to do with it being under or over $3.00 pps.


I could not go off margin completely very easily or strategically. However, Schwab is asking me permission
to sign up and allow borrowing my shares for income and I would never allow it.


31 Mar 2018, 05:39 PM

I wouldn't want to throw gasoline on a fire, but note that, based on the numbers of Fails-to-Deliver events
registered by the SEC, GERN is subject to heavy NAKED short selling anyway.
http://tinyurl.com/y8c...
Just for the 2nd half of January + 1st half of February (a period of time when the share price first
attempted to rally to $3), a grand total of 1956056 shares were not delivered in time to their owner.
This is more than happened for INTC during the same period of time! (only 1742367 FTD)
We really have shorters of the worst kind here, and I don't think they have taken their losses yet :-(

The Bottomline: If no one sold at cheap prices, if nobody was forced to sell, if everybody ignored their
fraudulent negative propaganda, Then the games the shorts play are only on themselves and they are
destroyed. I will do my utmost part in destroying them and I will continue to buy more shares if they lower
the prices. This time, the corrupt short organization needs to pay up magnaminously. They have put their
greed above medical science, above patients lives, above the law, and any class action cannot be more
bogus than with Geron that has made no claims to aid investors or the pps and revelation of data has
been more than scarce. Threats of class actions having no basis whatsoever are merely part of the Shorts
smear campaign to drive the pps lower. I'm going to enjoy what's coming to these criminals.


More than ever, I respect Geron/JNJ keeping a lid on data and the competition. We can clearly see why it
had to be done. The end result will be unstoppable. The value of having JNJ as our Partner is
unmeasureable, Scarlett seems to have done an outstanding job.

According to the last short interest update, there were 37M shares shorted below $3.50. If those shares
haven't covered on the spike, they are still 50-100% underwater and running out of time to cover.

For those that can, please make sure you are holding your GERN shares in a cash account and not
margin. That will dry up the float and help propel the stock higher. We CAN do something about these
shorts if we act in concert.

Hoosier, how exactly can shorts bring "failure upon the drug & company"? They can't affect the trials, only
the share price.


We investors may become homeless, but the drug isn't affected at all... and if the drug is approved and
starts producing income, then how are the tiny shorts (what, about $150 million in short interest, spread
among hundreds of HFTs?) going to affect $344 billion JNJ and a buyout?


Order of magnitude, it's a thing ;)

telomerase
User13etc.: If the short interest is mostly HFT, then they're constantly trading. Most of the current interest
may well have shorted before the AF article, during the highs.


If shorts made a business of shorting stocks in the $1.80s and then covering in the $6s, there wouldn't be
any shorts ;)

I don't know about other accounts but Schwab even with a margin account does not allow Geron to be
bought other than @ 100% value therefore not margineable in a margin account. I would think for GERN,
it doesn't matter if it is a cash account or not if the requirement is 100% ownership anyway. Now if your
broker allows you to margin GERN @ less than 100% (therefore you are leveraging), then yes they can
probably lend out some portion of your shares. The fact that Schwab needs me to sign up for allowing
lending of my GERN shares tells me this as well.

This article is trash. If you want real results, go to investigator discussions from GERON. Go to pubmed literature,
look at real data and not trashy biased articles. Can't wait, my bonus is coming on Friday, so I am definitely buying
GERON. and fools will loose twice. First time around I bought GERN at 2.3 and sold to early at 4.5. I hope people
will keep pushing GERON down all the way until Friday. So I can buy it on the cheap.
If you can't read and understand articles from pubmed. If you can't trust clinicians and doctors from MD Anderson
center, then you should not invest in small biotech. Fools trusting is short biased article, not realizing how dumb
they will look just few short months later.

28 Mar 2018, 07:34 PM

User, let me explain. And excuse my English, I am not highly skilled in my writing. 
Some years ago, I had opportunity to work with a product, that was very good, and when read out of the
study was coming, I with number of other investors, bought in completely, guess what, read out of the
study, did not produce any significant Survival benefit. (from what I can remember, only thing that could
have been considered as improvement, that in triple combination with this drug, subject seemed to
complain less of their hair falling out). Before market open, and I could sell my stocks, I lost more than half
of my money, and I was deeply in negative territory.
Then I interviewed with opthotech technology, (read up on them if you really trying to understand my logic)
and their compound fovista. Which had a great result from phase 2 studies, but failed terrible in phase 3.
Stock that was once a darling, and went up all the way to 73 dollars per stock, dropped below 3 dollars. 
I do not invest my nest egg with biotech, I do not know enough to do that. I am not even trained oncologist,
even those I do have a medical background. What I read up on Geron, just did not made sense, if their
progression free so good, then about 3-4 weeks ago when I fist bought some shares at 2.3 dollars, it
seemed ridiculously cheap. 
Then I saw shares basically double in two weeks after I bought them. I was very excited, then I saw that
some news came out with INCY, that leads me to believe they will be around 100 dollars per stock maybe
even more sometimes late April or May. Geron could be part of buyout, and maybe if I never sold my
shares, and ride them all the way, I could make 20X of what I put in originally, but I believe in locking in my
profits. From companies that I have followed for at least 4-5 years, INCY, is my favorite. I love their
pipeline, I think that company ran by very bright people. I honestly do believe, that if all market and political
unrest that going on in US will stop, INCY could be part of bidding war over IDO compound that will go into
read out soon. If major players will have a bidding war....... late fall INCY could be even 200 dollars per
stock, and unlike geron they have many shots on goal, many collaborations, and their are definitely not
one trick ponny.


If you like one trick ponny, here is a tip, read up on verastem. I would argue, they are much more ready to
incredible growth, and make someone a huge amount of money than Geron. I have no idea why their
stock right now is barely over 3.05-3.10 range if I rember stock price from last night.


So I hope I clarified my point. I believe in hedging, especially against companies which have not done their
phase 3 studies, and have not meet all their study end points. Look at PGNX, they meet all the study end
points, and just because their approval process moved by 3 months, they lost 20 percent of their value. 3
months in most biotech companies, is absolutely nothing. I think most people who invest in biotech have



https://seekingalpha.com/user/7649441

https://seekingalpha.com/user/35215015
very poor understanding how that world works.


So here is my response to you. I hope it makes sense.

How much did I got, more than I got last year. and I receive equity in company stock, almost as much as
my bonus. According to my boss, my bonus will be in my bank account this Friday, and equity......I will

I can tell you this, on days like yesterday when all of it was shared with me, it makes me feel good, it
makes me feel proud that I spend so many years studying, and educating myself.

This stock is worth very little because of the company has zero to know traction in the hematology community.
There more drugs coming down the pipeline that are far more promising. If Geron was going to take off it would
have already. There are very few patients on the drug today because its not as effective as other options. If you
look at INFN with early phase MF patients its far more effective for patients and patients are living longer when
INFN works.

Have you read the report? I haven't. I have no idea what is in it, and I bet that Scarlett hasn't either. Why
would he? It's not his job to respond to every hit piece that suggests IMET won't end up being approved,
etc.


At the end of the day, GERN's price per share will not be affected by any article, bullish or bearish. I
suggest you look at days like today as buying opportunities if you believe in IMET. There are multiple
upcoming catalysts in the next 6 months to a year, so we won't have to wait too long for something big to
happen, one way or another.


27 Mar 2018, 10:03 AM

If I was an analyst attending today's call I would ask Scarlett how significant is the data collected so far.
You say that "It's not his job to respond to every hit piece that suggests IMET won't end up being
approved, etc." What do you think the analyst conferences are for? They are exactly to debunk indirectly
the hit pieces and inform the institutional investors of the positives. Part of the job of the CEO is to protect
the pps (stock is currency in case you are not aware). So yes I would hope the CEO to address this in
today's meeting without answering directly the hit piece.

The analyst conferences are mostly for shaking hands, having a couple drinks, and walking a very, very

I agree with you that a CEO needs to focus on maximizing share price, but I do not agree that a CEO
should "protect" anything. The market has a mind of its own and virtually every CEO not named Elon Musk

company from time to time.


Hey, if Scarlett feels the need to address the content of the article, that's great. But again, we don't even
know what it says (unless you paid for it), so if it's just some opinion piece largely based on the fact that
the share price ran up too high, too fast, given the perceived risks of approval, what's to defend? Different
opinions are what makes a market and what allow us to achieve out-sized gains from time to time.

"Different opinions are what makes a market "


well, in the venue of consumer discretionaries, like smartphones, sure. in pharma, opinions are like
sphincters: everybody has one. in the drug world, it's facts that matter. sponsors tend to obfuscate the
truth, good and bad; they even try that with regulators (on the bad side of things, of course). in the end, it's
not opinion or the CxO class that matters. what matters is efficacy. and not killing folks.

One of the most stupid analysis I have read thus far. Geron should have enrolled ECOg 3 pts? You must be aware
that these pts are bed /couch ridden for the most part.
Maybe they should have enrolled dead pts to satisfy your foolishness.
Overall survival has not been reached which might tell you that it is still too early to separate dosage specific
survival.
This is not provenge. There are other measurable objective criteria for improvement of disease.

1 MF has now reached about 19 months and still has not reached median OS when the estimated

27 Mar 2018, 05:38 AM


biopearl
Taz, right you are. The 14 mo OS data from the MD Anderson article also includes some patients whose
disease was stable. It is really worth trying to parse out what the differences in patient population are
between the "real world" Janssen study and and the other smaller studies referenced by Scarlett that
showed "better" OS of 14 and 16 months. If the R/R patients are clearly closer to the real world patients in
the course of their disease the results to date are even more spectacular. The acknowledgment of the
other studies with better OS is a bid to be open and also say that even if the best case OS were 16
months, Imetelstat will still blow those results away regardless of what AF has to say. The data should be
able to speak for itself. Who to believe...AF or Drs. Raza/Tefferi Hmmm... let me think. bp

NASDAQ released 3-15 18 short interest figures and GERN shows just over 37 mill shares short up from the 2-28

From a recent piece on this fellow:


“Mangrove has had a successful record of shorting biotech shares, though it doesn’t always win. August believed
Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) had set its goals too high this past May during Phase 3 testing of a drug, called
Sustol, designed to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Test results, however, turned out positive—
good news for chemo patients, but not so much for Mangrove. It covered at a loss.”

So let me ask you, Nathaniel August, a few questions. I would appreciate an answer. This is in regards to your
three profound articles on Geron which all call basically for Geron's demise:


Do you, Mr. August, really believe what you are writing? What short positions do you put on "prior" to writing these
articles? Aside from profit motive, what reason do you have to post these articles? Anyone who understands the
basics about Geron would know how to undermine everything accomplished in articles by skewing statistics,
making up one's own statistics, and basically lying. Is the ability to work the system is your MO?

https://seekingalpha.com/user/691651
Why have you decided to post on Twitter statements against myself and MTB? I can only imagine the wealth
you've generated by your system, wealth gained at the expense of others.


At first I thought you were short a massive amount of Geron after your first article and needed to bail out of the
short. I now question that. Do you put on shorts prior to all hit articles, never being in a stock for longer then a few
hours? Do you buy very close expiration puts just outside the strike price so they would have maximum leverage
and volatility?


Rather than having my posts deleted why don't you try and answer my questions. These are valid questions
regarding your three articles and would like some answers. Why don't you and I have a dialogue on this article
about your three Geron articles, back-to-back-to-back.

blackmarango - GERN
Remember you have according to many sites just over 164 mill total shares outstanding --
current float of about 159 mill shares -- , so with about 38% insider and institutional ownership you still have a float
of 98 million shares +. Also the brokerage firms automatically put your shares into a margin acct which means they
can loan them, so.unless you specify different they are available to loan as for shorts. Does not matter if small
investors or large, the total shares being held by a firm are in a pool the firms work from. Brokerage firms make
good money doing this, so glad to loan shares. If using 35+ mill shares short+ there are still 65 mill shares
available to loan. Will be so interesting to see both the next report of shorts, but especially the 4-1 report if GERN
holds in or betters this current price.


25 Mar 2018, 10:21 AM


blackmarango
po: I certainly appreciate that games can and will be played with investors shares.


But, the shares that were shorted in the $2 must be accounted for sooner or later to balance the books.


If the GERN PPS stays about where it currently is or goes higher, the shorts are in a world of $$$ hurt.


Wait'n and Watch'n!!!!


25 Mar 2018, 10:16 PM


blackmarango
po: as you mentioned, we won't see what the shorts did during the actual PPS run up and high volume days until
later.


But, a little bit of me is still wondering where 35.5 million actual shares would come from IF the Big Boys did NOT
sell??? Even with about 23 days to cover, that's a lot of shares to come up with especially with many of the "little"
investors sitting on the side waiting on the sidelines for post Q3 results.


So, could we reach $10, $20 or higher in the next 23 days?


Wait'n and Watch'n!

Glad this info was helpful. Not to pick on Yahoo Finance but they have really declined as to their info quality and
accuracy. Yahoo has had so many reorgs over recent years, greatly reduced their staffing, and it has really shown
up in a negative way on their finance site. It is sad because some years ago they were much better and reliable.
Main thing I have found is NASDAQ info is correct, just wish they would or could publish the short data a little
quicker but know they are dependent on others reporting. As to short interest on GERN if you look at the daily
report the short interest is growing. Will be very interested to see the March 15 figure, but so much of the jump
came after that the 4-1 number will show the main pop and short results. All you folks have a great weekend.

lehung --- Yahoo finance used to be a good source -- notice I said used to be a good source -- which
means they are not very good anymore. Why would I say this-- use your comment of 28.44 million shares
short - that is totally wrong. The number they quote is from 11-15-17. To get latest numbers and they are
about 2 weeks behind, but go to NASDAQ and you will find out the latest short interest and they update
short interest in 2 week periods. Obviously there is a time delay to get the info, so currently last report is 2-
28-18 and this coming Thursday they will update to 3-15-18. Below I have posted the link to Geron short
interest on NASDAQ. Do yourself a big favor and question Yahoo Finance reports by using other sites.

One other item that deserves clarification is the "success" of GERN management.


I have opined, for years, that chippy has acted like a blind squirrel who just so happened to nest in an oak tree
AND simply did not know what to do when multiple acorns hit him in the head until his nest was full!


The blind squirrel had enough acorns fall in his nest so he could feast through the winter and all the other squirrels
proclaimed his prowess. Great Job they proclaimed!


But, what if the blind squirrel had nested in a sweet gum tree?


Food for thought?!?!?!


And what about the notion of new acquisitions (large money sinks!). No acorns on them!!!


Of course, IMO.

one thing I haven't seen mentioned in the last couple of days is how unlucky we are. we face a market that loses
1150 points on the dow in 2 days when this stock has wanted to skyrocket. I think we close at 7.50 today if we
didn't face those kind of headwinds.

unfortunate fact is that these days all financial writers, commentators, analysts, everyone large and small, are
utterly without credibility. All do what they do to deliberately, manipulate investors with an eye to exploiting
uninformed money. Markets have become nothing but smoke, mirrors, and deception.


Even the most skeptical, cynical generally are naive optimists and end up shocked by how bad things are when
they initially start following todays markets and financial media.

Thanks AE for a well-reasoned analysis. Patient demographics are a critical piece to interpreting the efficacy of
any clinical trial, and particularly uncontrolled studies.


The truth is we don't know yet the demographics of the patient population, or what the actual median OS will turn
out to be. A short position now is a bet that when those come to light, they will (1) show that IMBark is no better
than truly comparable historical controls, and (2) the market will actually understand this (or JNJ will walk away)
and react accordingly.


Given how willing the bulls are to ignore your assessment, I'd bet they'll ignore your analysis even if the facts come
out in your favor. And large companies have all kinds of (bad) reasons for not walking away from products when
they should. So the patient approach will be to wait for (1) to occur (significant derisking), and take a short position
when (2) does not follow immediately. Or if it's clear that GERN will continue on to a Phase 3 study, you could
short after this has built even more excitement for the stock.


In the meantime, though, no reason to fight the current excitement. If anything, waiting will let you get a better
price when you place your short bet.

That same line of thinking came from the idiots that extrapolated the 1980's Microsoft/IBM partnership with
an open system that Apple would crash and burn with their closed system. They mistakenly applied old
non-applicable history to Apple and they all went bankrupt and Apple is heading to a trillion capitalization
dwarfing Micorosoft and IBM combined. I love seeing these old opinions again and that's what tells me I'm

That is the problem with incorrect Geron perceptions. Many uniformed purveyors extrapolate the old
Geron to the NEW Geron which has clearly demonstrated solid progression towards commercializing a
platform oncology drug. It takes about 10 years to get a successful drug to market and if you check the
timeline and the progress of the pre-clinicals and clinicals, this is likely a huge home run taking the market
unexpectedly like it has already started to do. The die hard Longs here are very happy even at these low
pps prices.

One of the reasons that I have been in Geron for all these many years is the high level of analysis and research
brought to bear by my 'friends' here in the SA comments section. To that end, and having done some digging of my
own, I'm happy to provide a link to the transcript from the lawsuit against Alpha Exposure for stock manipulation.
This is publicly available information.


The ultimate irony is that AE and his partners' defense is their First Amendment right to free speech and yet he is
the person threatening defamation of character here for anyone claiming he is a manipulator. You can't have it
both ways AE. You can't say things about people and companies and claim you are covered by freedom of speech
but then disregard that same right of others when they say something YOU disagree with.


I suggest we keep it safe and say that he is an 'accused manipulator' which is factually true. If you'd like to see the
exact extent with which AE and his partners are accused of lying I suggest you scroll down through the transcript
to page 40 and start off by reading the plaintiff's complaints. They are VERY elucidating. The attorney for the
plaintiff is Mr. Bowe and he does a good job of summarizing their position in just a few paragraphs.

Give the author a break and pay attention to what he has to say.


I was lucky enough to buy below 2 and sold my entire position Monday pre-market as I thought the run-up I saw
right then was not warranted .


I back a smaller size position at a price 15% less than my sale.


I thought the price would be some what range bound and sold a short term out of the money calls against the
entire position. If I get taken out (which seems likely at this point) I'll take the profit and be happy, otherwise over
the short term I will sell more short term calls at least through July expiration. I am guessing a decision by JNJ on
continuation will be in early to mid August..


Now this that said, I am trying to see if there is a good chance to .make money with options.


If the author is correct, this is going down to around $1 if JNJ does not exercise their option. {I am figuring that at
least for the short term the asset may still have some value and they might be able to partner it again for much
less generous terms with a midcap biotech company that might be hopeful of approval on one indication as JNJ

From the chart we can see that there are too many "censored" patients in patients with 100000 platelets, who
disappear from the trial, so they were kicked off the curve as a straight horizontal line. This has caused the other
surviving patients who are health and live longer to replace those censored patients. In other words the
Anderson's chart is not very high confidence in statistics term. It should not be compared with other less censored
trials.

Janssen maybe delayed the decision to watch the stunning MDS data play out. At first it wasn't much part of the
equation...now it's a big part. Nathaniel...please do what Chip suggested and go listen to Dr Raza.


With the protocol specified primary analysis for IMbark expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018, we expect
Janssen to make its continuation decision by the end of the third quarter of 2018. Although the completion of the
protocol specified primary analysis for IMbark is the trigger for the continuation decision by Janssen, we expect
data from MDS - MDS from IMerge to contribute important information about imetelstat.

"The evidence is circumstantial and far from decisive but compelling. These high molecular risk mutations
may indeed eventually appear in the MPN patient population but the relatively short time span in which
they arose in this patient population and the acquisition of these mutations by a large percentage of the
cohort — with nearly two-thirds of those mutations in ASXL-1 — argues for the possibility of clonal

The author also conveniently excluded any consideration of the IMerge study results when determining
Imetelstat's value. In my opinion, the significance of Imetelstat's MDS opportunity in the EU alone will be enough to
justify JNJ's continuation decision and/or outright acquisition of Geron. It's hard to imagine such an astute investor
simply overlooked the very promising MDS data when determining Imetelstat's true value.


22 Mar 2018, 07:42 PM


Alex Babel
A user on the GERN message board over at Yahoo Finances posted something in regards to this article. Thought
I’d share.


I had a good chuckle reading the Alpha Exposure’s short apologetics.


I hope he reads this. He asks why pts in the trial are limited to 10% blasts and 75,000/ul platelet count. Here’s why.
Blasts greater than 10% is an artifact pointing towards AML, as is also severely low platelet count. We already
know Imet doesn’t work as a single agent in AML, so why on Earth would you select for pts presenting AML-like
conditions? Also, cytopenias are one of the adverse effects of Imet, and they occur b/c Imet is destroying the
proliferating cancer cells. So why would you put pts with very low platelet counts on a drug that could press
thrombocytopenia even further? By the way, all adverse events on Imet are reversible by simple dose and
schedule modification.


Either Alpha Exposure has no idea what he’s talking about, or he’s a short seller standing on the edge of a very tall
cliff.



https://seekingalpha.com/user/23704163

https://seekingalpha.com/user/23704163

https://seekingalpha.com/user/23437493

https://seekingalpha.com/author/hoosier-investor

https://seekingalpha.com/user/49303397
Here’s another knee-slapper of Alpha Exposure’s. He asks why very sickly pts with ECOG over 2 are excluded.
Well, let me explain. ECOG 2 doesn’t mean those pts are healthy. ECOG 2 patients can be extremely sick, but still
capable of walking. We are talking about R/R pts, after all. In fact, ECOG isn’t an actual metric of health at all. It’s a
GENERALIZED system of categorizing the state of the diseased patient, with ANY disease. How far does a
generalized system go towards relevance in SPECIFIC diseases? THAT’S Alpha Exposure’s red flag? Seriously?
ECOG? Laughable.


Imbark is geared towards MF pts R/R to Rux, inter alia. The trial is designed to help THOSE people, not all “ECOG
3” pts, not AML pts, not hepatitis pts, not people with sinus infections.


And the lower dose arm pts having OS benefit doesn’t detract from Imet’s efficacy. I laughed out loud at that one.
Also, the 4.7 group isn’t a good placebo b/c obviously placebos should be an inert oligo... not the actual
experimental drug.


Lastly, Alpha Exposure doesn’t seem to understand what a median means. He wrote, “Because the median
platelet count in the paper was so close to the allowed lower bound in the IMbark trial, a substantial portion of the
patients followed in the MD Anderson paper would have been ineligible for Imbark.” In other words, a substantial
portion of pts WOULD be eligible. This is getting long, so I’ll let Alpha Exposure figure that one out.


So... Alpha Exposure, looks like you’ll have to dig up something else besides ECOG. And you did realize this was
a trial for R/R MF pts? Maybe you can look for what brand latex gloves they’re using at the clinical sites? Could
that be the fatal flaw in Imbark’s design?


The OS signal is real. It’s unprecedented. It’s significant. Deal with it. Presenting a weak argument against Imet,
despite the overwhelming strength of the data to date, across the total program, only makes Alpha Exposure look
even more desperate. If there’s a legitimate problem with Imbark, you should have found something more
significant than ECOG.

Alex -- This is probably the best rebuttal so far. Majority of others are just attacks. (You could lose your
attacks as well. It doesn't help.) Now the question to you, Alex, given the trial population (>75K/ul, excl.
ECOG >2), what should be the right benchmark for OS? 7 months? 14-15 months? Was the company
correct in their presentation on this?

Competitors to Geron have an OS of anywhere from 7-9 months. In my opinion, the competitor’s



https://seekingalpha.com/user/6016291

https://seekingalpha.com/user/280271

https://seekingalpha.com/user/49303397
benchmark should be the correct benchmark for a drug that’s marketed as unprecedented.


In an incomplete clinical trial, I think it’s difficult to determine what the final OS would be, but they can still
ballpark it based on how many patients are still alive. However, according to their earnings call earlier in
the week, median OS hasn’t been reached yet after 19 months. That, to me, is extremely noteworthy.


Was the company correct in their presentation on this? I think that’ll become evident at the upcoming world
health conference that Geron is officially scheduled to present at. After that presentation, not only will
investors have GERN under a microscope, but so will scientists around the world as well.

In ~5 minutes of time, I was able to determine only 11% (12 of 107) of the patients in the above cited "well known
study" discontinued their JAK inhibitor treatment due to 'Progressive Disease'.


This seems a very important data point since other well known studies (JAKARTA-2) have concluded the
'Progressive Disease' myelofibrosis patients are the least likely to respond to further treatment. Thus, the
percentage of 'Progressive Disease' patients seems a very important statistic when attempting to compare trial
populations, patient 'sickness' levels, and median OS.


This leads us to an important question regarding the IMbark trial:


Q: What percentage patients experienced 'Progressive Disease' prior to their enrollment in the IMbark trial?
A: 100%. Documented progressive disease during or after JAK inhibitor therapy was part of the IMbark enrollment
criteria.

Curiosity Killed The Cat, Contributor
True story.


Back on Oct 21, 2014, Nathaniel August, founder of Mangrove Partners, goes live on CNBC with his top short
pick, WWE. http://cnb.cx/2FZQ5UT


At the time, WWE had recently launched its live streaming Over-The-Top network and Mr. August’s explained to
the CNBC host that WWE would need to at least double its subscriber base from the then existing 700k to even
justify its current market cap and that it was “never” going to happen. In response to that short call, WWE dropped
4% to close the day $12.51. The stock price then proceeded to rise straight up over the next few years to its
current price of $38 as Over-The-Top became one of the largest live streaming networks in the USA with more
than 1.5 million paid subscribers. http://bit.ly/2IHk0D8


At the time, Vince McMahon, founder, and CEO of WWE, was asked by a business reporter from local Stamford
newspaper The Advocate, what he thought about Mr. August, Mangrove Partners, and Mr. August’s claim that
WWE would “never” be able to double its Over-The-Top subscriber base. Mr. McMahon replied (link unavailable –
subscribers only), “Show me a picture of this August guy.” The reporter obliged and brought up Mangrove Partners
website and showed Mr. McMahon a picture of Mr. August, whereupon Mr. McMahon exclaimed, “F*** this pencil
neck geek!.”


BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!...


The moral: Mangrove Partners, like all of us, is entitled to voice its opinions. But those opinions are not always
correct.

Geron Corporation Stock Still a Strong Buy?
What happened


Geron Corporation (NASDAQ: GERN), a small-cap clinical-stage biotech, saw its shares rise by as much as
33.8% in early-morning trading today. Although its stock has cooled off somewhat in the interim, Geron's shares
are still up by a healthy 14.8% as of 1:48 p.m. EDT Thursday.


The apparent reason for this continued surge is an all-out exodus by short-sellers. As proof, Geron's stock is up on
a monstrous 15 times the average daily volume today.

So what


This purported short squeeze is likely being driven by two factors:


Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Geron's blood cancer collaboration for the telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, is

potentially producing unprecedented clinical benefits for patients with both advanced myelofibrosis and
myelodyspastic syndromes. 
Geron's stock crossed over the pivotal $5 mark today. By doing so, the biotech's stock is now marginable, and a
larger swath of institutional investors can buy its shares. 
Taken together, these two factors should be enough to make short-sellers rethink their position.


Now what


Previously, J&J has suggested that it may apply for a regulatory approval for imetelstat in advanced myelofibrosis
before year's end. The good news is that imetelstat's overall survival curve for this unmet medical need seems to
warrant an accelerated approval -- even without an active comparator arm or a placebo-controlled trial.


The fact of the matter is that myelofibrosis patients have no viable treatment options, and imetelstat appears to be
extending their lifespans in a clinically meaningful way.


What does this all mean? My guess is that Geron's stock will continue to tick higher in the months ahead until
imetelstat's top-line data are released. If positive -- and the trend is favorable -- I think Geron can easily reach $20
a share. However, this stock remains a high-risk growth play, and investors shouldn't risk more than they are
willing to lose.

Who is Mangrove Partners:


"Cutting-edge treatments for diseases affecting millions of Americans are threatened by Wall Street’s latest
moneymaking scheme. The ploy: Hedge funds bet against a drug company’s stock price, launch attacks against
the firm’s patents on its best-selling medicines and then reap windfall profits when investors panic and the stock
price plummets....The Mangrove Partners Master Fund acquired a 270,000-share “short” position in VirnetX, which
owns patents for a Internet-privacy technology. Within weeks of filing two reviews against VirnetX patents,
Mangrove unwound its short position, profiting from an 8 percent drop in the stock price.


Although these reviews can be filed against any patent, they’re particularly threatening to medicine patents and the
companies that own them. David Winwood, an executive at Louisiana State University’s Biomedical Research
Center, explains that “most often, a startup company’s sole asset is a patent application or issued patent, upon
which the company’s fortune lays.”

The timing of the article seems to suggest SA is complicit in supporting the shorts as another poster has
suggested. Generally authors of articles can’t determine when their articles are published. This one
appeared right at the time GERN was trading up with great momentum toward $7 and the article appeared
and stopped the upward momentum right on its track. This timing couldn’t be accidental. Still the fact
GERN traded the rest of the day in positive territory in a terrible stock market meltdown day speaks a lot to
its strength since data was released. These concerted efforts by shorts could only temporarily slow down
GERN upward movement yesterday. It will resume in days to come.

Imetlestat looked at patients how were high risk MF and whose disease is relapsed or refractory to JAK inhibitor
treatment. This is far different then the patients population of Celgene's product. You have to also consider the
patients on Lenalidomide where also given 30mg/d of oral pnednisone which makes the two products impossible
to compare since you are not comparing apples to apples. These are different patients populations and different
adjunct medications. Another point to address within your write up is the quote that the 4.7 mg/kg arm was
essentially placebo. That those patients who achieved a response must not have been as sick since they
responded to what you consider a placebo or "placebo effect. What you fail to include in your analysis is

re-post sdrawkcabeman


I had a good chuckle reading the Alpha Exposure’s short apologetics.


I hope he reads this. He asks why pts in the trial are limited to 10% blasts and 75,000/ul platelet count.
Here’s why. Blasts greater than 10% is an artifact pointing towards AML, as is also severely low platelet
count. We already know Imet doesn’t work as a single agent in AML, so why on Earth would you select for
pts presenting AML-like conditions? Also, cytopenias are one of the adverse effects of Imet, and they
occur b/c Imet is destroying the proliferating cancer cells. So why would you put pts with very low platelet
counts on a drug that could press thrombocytopenia even further? By the way, all adverse events on Imet
are reversible by simple dose and schedule modification.


Either Alpha Exposure has no idea what he’s talking about, or he’s a short seller standing on the edge of a
very tall cliff.


Here’s another knee-slapper of Alpha Exposure’s. He asks why very sickly pts with ECOG over 2 are
excluded. Well, let me explain. ECOG 2 doesn’t mean those pts are healthy. ECOG 2 patients can be
extremely sick, but still capable of walking. We are talking about R/R pts, after all. In fact, ECOG isn’t an
actual metric of health at all. It’s a GENERALIZED system of categorizing the state of the diseased patient,
with ANY disease. How far does a generalized system go towards relevance in SPECIFIC diseases?
THAT’S Alpha Exposure’s red flag? Seriously? ECOG? Laughable.

Imbark is geared towards MF pts R/R to Rux, inter alia. The trial is designed to help THOSE people, not all
“ECOG 3” pts, not AML pts, not hepatitis pts, not people with sinus infections.


And the lower dose arm pts having OS benefit doesn’t detract from Imet’s efficacy. I laughed out loud at
that one. Also, the 4.7 group isn’t a good placebo b/c obviously placebos should be an inert oligo... not the
actual experimental drug.


Lastly, Alpha Exposure doesn’t seem to understand what a median means. He wrote, “Because the
median platelet count in the paper was so close to the allowed lower bound in the IMbark trial, a
substantial portion of the patients followed in the MD Anderson paper would have been ineligible for
Imbark.” In other words, a substantial portion of pts WOULD be eligible. This is getting long, so I’ll let
Alpha Exposure figure that one out.


So... Alpha Exposure, looks like you’ll have to dig up something else besides ECOG. And you did realize
this was a trial for R/R MF pts? Maybe you can look for what brand latex gloves they’re using at the clinical
sites? Could that be the fatal flaw in Imbark’s design?


The OS signal is real. It’s unprecedented. It’s significant. Deal with it. Presenting a weak argument against
Imet, despite the overwhelming strength of the data to date, across the total program, only makes Alpha
Exposure look even more desperate. If there’s a legitimate problem with Imbark, you should have found
something more significant than ECOG.

TMFBudwell is being very conservative. The potential is easily triple digits. There is a reason why JNJ has
delayed the milestone payments. It would immediately spike GERN's revenues which in turn would cause
the share price to spike much more rapidly. Many investors don't even look at a stock until it's not only
making money, but the quarterly increases have been significant and sustained for several quarters.
GERN may not be a free agent long enough for that to happen. The potential is in the hundreds of billions
of dollars and yet the entire market cap is sitting at just over $1 Billion right now. GERN has more like
AMGN or CELG potential at minimum, it's many times more valuable than INCY and that is around 20
Billion. If you fear a drop in price, consider to buy OTM PUT options. If you think the price will wildly swing,
consider setting up an options spread to catch it both ways, while protecting your principal.

"It does not approve clinical trials."


on the whole, they do. all trials have to pass muster with regard to endangering patients; that's been true
from the beginning of the FDA. with the 1962 amendments, FDA is responsible for judging efficacy as well.
some sponsors, some times, submit a SPA, and there FDA makes a specific assessment of the trial's
outcome and offers a **non-binding** agreement of approval if the outcomes are met. there are further
niches in the process, but FDA is involved, more or less, in the structure of trials. they publish many
documents on the subject.

The FDA can reject an IND, the FDA can halt a trial (for safety) but the FDA in no way APPROVES trials.


An SPA can be granted based on the proposed study DESIGN. But that does not mean the trial is
APPROVED in any way by the FDA. That is not their job, it is not what they do.


Once a company has an "accepted" (not APPROVED) IND, the company can run any trial it wants, no
matter how silly. The government only steps in at that point due to safety issues that might pop up.


Efficacy is judged by the FDA during the approval process, not during the trials.

"But that does not mean the trial is APPROVED in any way by the FDA. "


well, if the design is what is approved, what else is there?


23 Mar 2018, 04:18 PM


BuyersStrikeWP
An SPA is not an APPROVAL. The FDA might agree to an SPA, but that is not an approval. Approval has a
very specific meaning with regards to drugs and devices.


At its most basic an SPA is a non-binding agreement that says, "If your study proves X, and adheres to
design Y, then we will do Z" nothing more.


It does not mean the FDA "likes" your drug or device. It means that the study you proposed, if successful
and if run according to the submitted plan, will provide enough data to make an approval decision. It does
not guarantee an APPROVAL. It is non-binding.


24 Mar 2018, 08:29 PM


cucumberbatch
"An SPA is not an APPROVAL."


oh my sainted aunt. I never said it was an approval of, or even predilection towards, a drug. the issue is
whether FDA has *any* input into trial design and execution. they do. they publish copious documents on
clinical trial requirements; they aren't just whistling. an SPA is a stronger approval of design, but still non-
binding, as I said. the issuance of CRL ("we need further data", and the like) is proof that FDA doesn't like
your design.

What The Stock
"Since Geron and Janssen determined the 4.7mg/kg arm was ineffective, then we should expect the 9.4mg/kg arm
to outperform on a survival basis, but we haven't seen that yet, as indicated in their press release which stated:
"the median overall survival has not been reached in either dosing arm." Since the 4.7mg/kg arm was enrolled on
average earlier than the 9.4mg/kg arm, a best case would be equivalent survival rates between the arms."


Can't wrap my head around this comparison as justification of the short. You cannot statistically compare two
numbers that don't exist. To conclude that that means the doses perform the same is erroneous.

AE has to assume that the trial close date is the very best median OS of Both Arms and that cannot be
assumed at all at this point and seems incongruent to what Geron IR told us and is not supported by the

Mangrove make up your mind first you want the hospice patient included in the trial then you want those who are
not intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis to be used as the bar for OS. You are comparing apples to oranges.
The only study that you use is the MD Anderson study of 58 post rux patients and included patients that are not
Intermediate 2 or high-risk. The other study which fits tis population better had an OS of 14 months we are at 19

Disease progression in MF was one of the risks for the trial design; it was unknown how these patients in an
advanced state of disease progression would respond with respect to spleen size or other heme factors--any
malignancy established in the spleen could take on characteristics more difficult to treat without a combo. At the
time mutational events were also being discovered and evaluated.


That JNJ applied for a recent patent to treat lymphcytic malignancies with an Imet/Venetoclax combo, as well as
for a host of other heme disorders, is an interesting development.

1) Geron Janssen filed to extending the trial so patients can stay on Imetelstat.


What do your short pants tell you about that?


2) They took patients who failed Jakafi!
3) Median OS not met!!!!!
4) Those In 4.7 arm who chose to stay on that dose surprised Janssen because they are STILL on that
dose. They HAVE to be getting a benefit ... otherwise why stay on it?
5) 4.7 arm not a placebo ... OS HAS been extended, as per the call.
6) Large unmet need in MDS (go listen to Dr Raza’a presentation). Not even mentioned.


Just to name a few.

With their continuous disclosure, the drug seems to work in MDS patients, who doesnt have a lot of options (since
Len only works with 5q deletion patients, which is 10% of MDS patients), side effects disclosed were more
manageable than Lenalidomide. It is reasonable to assume it's going to P3 in Q3.

22 Mar 2018, 01:51 PM

There is a reason IMbark Primary efficacy is spleen response rate and symptoms control, while the
Secondary efficacy is overall survival. (please refer to their website on IMbark) In MF patients, surviving
longer is not as important, especially if they are too weak to even care for themselves. Imagine you are too
weak to type on a keyboard but survive longer.


Which was why last year J was considering termination. Of cos the good IMerge results make all these
moot. All these discussions about overall survival miss the point by both longs and shorts.

I appreciate the arguments in this short article. I've been pondering these myself (as noted in some of my prior
posts). I like to read both the potential pros and cons of an investment.....just to make sure I am not blinded one
way or the other.


Related to this.....if ultimately the FDA finds the imetelstat data actually has a high likelihood of extending
life....which dose should the FDA approve? At this point, what compelling reason is there to go with 9.4? 4.7 would,
it seems, be safer. No evidence of a different median OS yet between doses.....


So this would lead one to believe JNJ/GERN picked the wrong primary endpoint(s) and closed a dose because it
"does not warrant further investigation" that we are now arguing is efficacious? We should be mad at JNJ/GERN
more than anyone for these errors!

More to the point, the FDA was recently given data on IMET's efficacy in MF. BOTTOM LINE: This trial
would not be continuing if efficacy had not been demonstrated to FDA's satisfaction. Despite all the bio
research skills Phil (the author) acquired at Wharton, he has not picked up on something that the FDA
missed. As demonstrated by his last three articles, Phil is indeed grasping at proverbial straws. I am
always interested in a good short thesis to challenge my long thesis, but this ain't it.

7 month median OS is most likely for the patients with ASXL1 mutation. For the rest it appears to be 16 months
after discontinuation from Jakafi. Since the trial is not actively excluding the ASXL1 patients, the numbers from
IMBARK look impressive. In addition I don't believe Janssen would waste time extending the trial in 2016 & 2017 if
it didn't clearly demonstrate some meaningful survival benefit.

IMET is 3 to 4 times the market for MF. Then add in AML and that's not even beginning to address all the
potential of IMET as a platform ingredient. Why in the world would anyone want a buyout at $16. If
handled correctly by investors and Geron, this stock has a very huge upside potential but not overnight.

The premise of your entire article is that OS isn't as profound as holders of Geron stock anticipate. And the
fulcrum upon which your article rests, is an "estimation" from an analyst at Stifel -- not an oncologist, not
even a scientist, but an investment firm, and one with no greater information than any of the rest of us
have and one you portray it as fact. Only JnJ/Janssen and Geron have any clue what the OS might be.
Only JnJ/Janssen and Geron know how well each individual arm of the study is doing, yet you present
your opinions as fact. Finally, only JnJ/Janssen know what the overall make up of population is. The take
away from Imbark is that patients who are R/R to Jakafi AND HAVE NO OTHER OPTION will find overall
survival longer by taking Imetelstat. That point you didn't disprove, only obfuscated. The reading between
the lines on Imbark, is that were Imetelstat to be a frontline treatment, rather than secondary, a lot more
patients who are easier to treat would live considerably longer without having had their lives shortened by
taking Jakafi (three recent studies have come out showing Jakafi actually reduces a patient's OS while
only offering pallative results). The entirety of your article is an speculation supporting an opinion.
Numbers dressed up as facts. You even suggest the 4.7 arm IS OUTLIVING the 9.4 without any sort of
citation. Geron is notoriously tight-lipped to the irritation of shareholder yet you seem to have more
information than the conference call gave. You asked one vague question at the conference call and
crafted an argument around it. The opinion OS isnt as great as shareholders think is fine, but you have
made zero arguments based on information released from Geron. We'll find out soon enough whether the
OS is 19, 25, or even indeterminate (my guess) and whether the patients were very sick, kind of sick, or
just faking it...but right now, we only have the information released -- the same as you -- and I didn't hear
the half of what you made up.

How many times have we heard that these R/R jak patients are very sick with a typical 7 month lifespan
once they entered the trial per JNJ ? Now to sell OS clearly as very significant, JNJ has gone to greeat
lengths to search all possible databases and academia to obtain worst case OS figures for R/R MF for
historical comparisons. JNJ/Geron have no problem it seems whatso ever allowing the worst case of 14 to
16 months. Now that's something to really pay attention to IMO. Not to some how try to say there is no OS
benefit just because the low-dose ARM enrolled sooner then the 9.4 ARM completed enrollment and that
AE is assuming the median OS is reached in 2nd quarter based on nothing. I think as usual, Scarlett will
clear up these deliberate attempts to deceive at the Needham Investor Conference. One of the problems
is that besides Geron/Janssen keeping the details close to their chest, is that Scarlett often speaks in a
confusing way where shorts can play with what he says in the abscence of openess of data. As always,
these false rumors melt away once he clarifies everything with some help from the conference host.


23 Mar 2018, 04:10 AM


Volumelogic
Your arguments are without merit.


- "If imetelstat had a positive impact on overall survival, we would expect the 9.4mg/kg dose arm to have
outperformed the ineffective 4.7mg/kg arm." Since neither arm has reached median overall survival, your
statement makes no sense. At this point we can not say which arm produced superior results. What we see is both
doses producing a positive survival benefit which is what we would hope to see at this point with an effective drug.


- "We believe the IMbark patient population was more similar to the >100,000/ul population in the MD Anderson
trial than the <100,000/ul population." As platelet count data hasn't been released by Geron, you should be honest
and admit you hold this opinion with no basis in fact. You have plucked numbers out of the air that support your
short thesis and give the impression of a reasoned analysis, but there is no foundation - it is a guess.


- "We are short Geron with a targeted return of 90%." How much money have you lost so far on this very poorly
timed trade? Do you have a stop in place or have you bet the house?

75k platlet count was the allowable. The idea of the patients being healthier after failing on jakafi is pretty

Author’s reply »  Your arguments here fail. We know that the company expects to reach median OS in the
9.4 arm in Q2 and this means there's (at best) no difference between the 4.7 and 9.4 arms and it's
possible that 4.7 will underperform


From Blood, we know that about half of patients have a platelet count above 100k and it was seen as low
as 11k in the article for the cutoff to be a minimum of 75k means that the vast majority of patients probably
came with 100k+ and it means that the sickest portion of the patients in the < 100k group were excluded.

On your second point, why did you say he pulled it out of air? Allowable was 75K (minimum). It's not far
stretched to say the average for the trial is above 100K/ul (unless everyone in the trial is close to 75K and
not many above 100K -- what are the odds), right? Just math.

How about basic math, alpha. They say 90% of clinical trials fail. So if you just stayed away from reasonably
successful phase 3 companies you have a 90% chance when you short. But instead look who you choose. Did

Alpha,
Here is a feeler for you, in your article you state, that you know what selection criteria GERON used for
their study population. As person who has real familiarity and knowledge how that process goes, I know
that is a lie. If you have such an intimate knowledge of what selection criteria's used, you would be either
trading on insider information, or you really would like to go to jail. So what is it?
You misinforming your readers who unfortunately do not understand realities of clinical studies, and early
small biotech word, by knowingly feeding them misleading information. You completely dismissing the
facts, facts shared by MD Anderson Cancer center, in relatively recent article about Jak inhibitors,
interferons, and other potential targets. You avoid addressing facts, such as their follow up survival data

You make judgments, on JNJ decision, which is clearly our own highly subjective opinion, because again
you can't speak for JNJ. Otherwise you would be sharing insider trade like information, or which is likely a
case, you again lying here.
There is also another thing, I know how much time it takes relatively small project to be approved by all big
bosses in the global company. JNJ is much bigger than my current company, so I could even venture to
state, that maybe buyout already in the discussion, but it just did not received Mr. Gorsky approval. I am
sure none of his subordinates would want to loose their fancy job, because they spend company money
without his approval.
I despise liars, and it makes me laugh, when people here who clearly can't read and interpret medical
data, invest in small biotech company, which has not even done with its phase 3 study. 
It is inherently dangerous to invest this way. Do not believe me, look up story and read up on opthotech
technology and fovista and how their phase 3 studies destroyed a great product. Product that would
dominate its field.

@Alpha Exposure


"You are choosing to focus on a single outdated trial...


And you are choosing to focus on a single follow-up study, even though you mention there are now
multiple studies, to support your thesis that IMbark patients, because of minimum platelet and ECOG
requirements, are less sick.


Regarding platelets, there has to be some baseline cutoff. Even INCY, in its frontline COMFORT I and II
studies, had a cutoff of a minimum 100,000/microliter (IMbark accepted sicker patients with a minimum of
75,000/microliter).


COMFORT I: http://bit.ly/2FUEE4W
COMFORT 2: http://bit.ly/2ugbZBM


Regarding ECOG scores, COMFORT I and II allowed patients with ECOG's up to 3, while IMBARK up to 2
– but for a simple reason. If you are level 3 and homebound, you would still be able to participate in the
ruxolitinib trials because you are simply taking a pill administered at home. With imetelstat, you need to be

You try to twist it but not flying. They are searching high and low so no surprises and they turned up these
three addition papers so they are including them as an OS comparison for R/R MF and they have no
issues using them as a worst case rather than pushing 7 months. It should tell all investors that
JNJ/Janssen is not concerned at all about the 14 to 16 months as they are already beyond 19 months and
they can see the rate of deaths and have openly stated that they amended the protocol so they can
continue to treat and follow remaining patients for safety and median OS. If median OS goes on for years,
they still need to close the trial sometime. The 24 month mark for OS coincides with final reports being
done in Both IMBARK and IMERGE so that JNJ can make a descision. All very very encouraging and no
bad news in sight at all.

I can tell you why 4.7 isn't a good proxy for placebo. The treatment format allows dose reduction for
tolerability. So those levels are strictly nominal, Read them as "up to 4.7" and "up to 9.4." Without a lot
more data than has been publicly releases, we can't even be sure that the ongoing dosage at the two
nominal levels was different.

"The IMbark trial had two arms, a low-dose 4.7mg/kg arm and a high-dose 9.4mg/kg arm. In September
2016, Geron announced that enrollment in the 4.7mg/kg dosing arm would be discontinued because the
dose was determined to be ineffective...”


The fact that it was determined that the 4.7mg was not effective tells me that the patients in the 4.7 mg
group had similar % of deaths as historical data or data from literature as of Sept. 2016. It also means that
the survival for the 4.7 mg arm before Sept. 2016 was worse than that arm's overall average for which we
do not know yet.


That conclusion was made more than one year ago. It is possible that the effects of 4.7mg had not kicked
in back then yet. Apparently many patients/physicians saw that it is working and decided to stay put. As
time goes on, the drug started to having an effect and result in longer survival after Sept. 2016. As a result,
the mOS for the 4.7mg arm has not reached yet.


Maybe both doses work just fine, or it is possible that the 9.4mg dose does better eventually.


I am still not sure if there are actually three arms by now: 9.4mg all along; 4.7mg all along; and 4.7mg first,
then 9.4mg.

I agree with your point about the 4.7 dose cohort. The company announced earlier they were discontinuing
it due to ineffectiveness but if true why are some patients still on it and why is that groups OS median yet
to be reached? This reads to me there is a clinical benefit that just took longer to kick in. Which is
consistent with Imetelstat progressively shortening Telomeres and at lower doses just taking longer for
apoptosis to result.

@Alpha Exposure


The 4.7 arm was discontinued for lack of efficacy vis-a-vis the primary endpoint of spleen reduction. For
that matter, the 9.7 arm was also discontinued for the same lack of efficacy based on predetermined trial
parameters. However, neither was discontinued for lack of efficacy vis-a-vis OS. Which is where we stand
now. Waiting. So it's incorrect to consider the 4.7 to be a proxy for placebo for OS. And we know it's not
hurting people or the trial would have been stopped.

Thanks cktc -- spleen size is not the important measure, keeping very ill patients alive and allowing

jessielucky
No position on the stock. But the "ineffective" conclusion is based on spleen volume et al, NOT on OS. so
call the arm "ineffective" is irrelevent on OS. So you are misleading here.


22 Mar 2018, 02:55 PM


Rodney Watson, Contributor
You're focused on Overall Survival -- which is good, but remember back then they were focused on spleen
size reduction and the primary endpoint. It is highly likely that 4.7mg wasn't as effective in reducing the
spleen size. After 12 weeks survival differences were likely not visible -- or on top of mind for the
investigators.

Thank you for the entertaining read and even more entertaining comments as a result of the article. I'm
enjoying the wave around 3.04 (cb). Plan on taking my profits around double digits. Must be frustrating to
see this stock top around 6.3 today. Apparently a lot of people disagree with you. I'm not here to argue.
Just thanking you for the entertainment value.

In addition to what others have mentioned regarding spleen size endpoints vs overall survival...


We must remember the importance of “intention to treat” (ITT) analysis vs “per protocol” analysis. 
If a number of patients from the 4.7 dosing arm did indeed cross over to the 9.4 dosing arm, then the
relative differences in outcomes between the two groups would certainly be reduced. Those that had
started in the 4.7 dosing arm would now be mirroring the therapy of the 9.4 dosing arm, but their data
would still be recorded in the 4.7 cohort for “ITT” statistical analysis. Why? Because the initial groups were
randomized to reduce bias. Switching them to per protocol analysis and including them instead in the 9.4
cohort could introduce unexpected bias into the results. Most studies stick to intention to treat analysis for
this reason.
Nobody knows what a “meaningful number” of the 4.7 cohort remaining in that dose is. Did 20% stay on
4.7? Is that meaningful? How about 40%? He certainly didn’t say the ‘majority’ of patients remained in the
4.7 arm.


In my eyes, the fact that both groups are surviving beyond 19 months does not discredit either study arm
and may in fact be a result of a migration of the initial 4.7 arm onto the treatment track of the 9.4 arm. If
nothing else it remains a very good outcome for the drug.


Taken together with others’ comments on the prior emphasis on spleen size vs the current emphasis on
OS, I think the negatives you have brought up are overblown. Just my two cents. Always good to have a

That was back when they were interested in spleen volume reduction. Ancient history. at 12 weeks likely
no significant OS signal --

Because you are not privy to any real details about the 4.7 ARM other than a generalization at the 12-
week interim period and that Neither ARM has reached median OS as of the 19 month mark in Jan. 2018.
You haven't a clue of what CI's and to what degree have been achieved thus far and because I do believe
we can get a better control arm by going head-to-head against jakafi, the palliative bag of blood spleen
drug, that only helps some patients for a small window of time. The control arm should be the leading
treatment (only well practiced treatment) of jakafi and then your nonsense stops (you and your obvious
little minion).
We won't know until we see the details if the 4.7 dose can possibly be any kind of control. Maybe it cold be
another ARM has IMET has alot of apparent properties for allowing a stepped-down doseage and as a
maintenance drug.

How do you imagine "up to the dosage". The protocol calls for flexibility in dosages bertween 4.7 and 9.4
as needed but the ARMS were designed with 4.7 and 9.4 doseages and could at discretion be adjusted
within the range but not outside the range. 4.7 was declared as the minimal dose or as I call it a zero
reference point. Normally, you wouldn't want to use this ARM anyway if it getting long-term good CIs and
exended OS. The fact that Neither ARM has reach median OS yet is a good thing ONLY !

Wrong ! We are hearing that the 4.7 ARM is quite possibly showing a longer term benefit and we always
suspected that a 12-week peek was not long enough. It makes sense it could take longer at a half dose as
well. The 9.4 dose ARM is likely going to extend OS far out beyond the closing of the IMBARK CT and the
4.7 dose ARM we can't be sure of how far it would go but the fact that Both ARMS are seeing survfivalk
benefit beyond the worst cases that JNJ can dig up tells us alot. Scarlett remarked that they are digging
deep and that's how they dug up the the three academia papers. They are being conservative and
applying the worst case OS to beat.

Distortion: Both ARMS halted enrollment and they simply had 10 patients in the queue for the 9.4 group
that still had not been infused and moved into the 9.4 ARM so they felt they had enough patients in totality
with moving to the separately tracked converted group and the 9.4 ARM.


However, what we heard now is that a "meaningful number" of 4.7 patients did not covert to 9.4 for
whatever reason so the 4.7 ARM apparently became meaningful again and tracked and over a long time
period beyond that first 12-week peek, they apparently are seeing something meaningful. That was a good
surprise that the 4.7 ARM had not reached median OS yet and by logical extrapolation and past
experience from the Mayo Pilot, we can expect the 9.4 ARM to have a longer median OS and we received
some feedback from IR that is the case. Furthermore, although we and You cannot be sure at all, the low-
dose 4.7 ARM seems to indicate that quite possibly based on the rate of deaths, that they may be
projecting a 24 month median survival I suspect for the 4.7 ARM. We can all play guessing games but
clearly, we are only hearing good information and your falsifications and misleading the public won't fly.
You are not going to stop this stock now. There are many good catalysts potentially and likely in the next 6
months tic-tock. The 9.4 ARM is likely going to extend substantially beyond the closing of the CT and that
we also had hints from IR. Rather than falsly distorting and misleading for you own self interest, we are
very likely going to see a shorter median OS than the 9.4 ARM and we are likely going to see better CIs
for the 9.4 ARM which pattern follows thew Mayo Pilot where doses were stepped up and stepped down
and intervals lengthened. However, I think we see some CIs and decent OS extension for the 4.7 ARM
now and that will come in handy for stepping down doseages, improving drug costs and applying likely in a
frontline MF application. There is not much question that IMET will knock jakafi out of the way and I can't
wait to see it. Now that doesn't even include the IMERGE MDS trial with also never before seen results
that we are waiting to reaffirm before going into the Part 2/Phase 3 and that market is 3 to 4 times larger
than MF not to mention that JNJ is likely to go in to an AML p2/PS3 combo trial once they continue. there
is no way JNJ backs out of this Agreement and gives up exclusive rights.

Clearly you are trying to distort with only what they new far back in time at a 12 week peek just like then
they had to admit they picked the wrong "spleen primary endpoint" and set the bar too high relative to
anyone else. Times have changed and they have learned alot and now they are clearly seeing clinical
benefits by going far beyond just 12 weeks due to thew fact that a meaningful number of 4.7 patients did
not switch over to the full dose. So in hindsight, those statements were premature and now they are
seeing surprisingly the longer term effects of IMET which we have seen before in the mayo Pilot.

The whole spleen endpoint has distorted the field because it is really just a symptom specific to jakafi
because that's its main effect which is palliative or more significant than anything else it could do in a world
have no competition at the time. So it flew at the time through the FDA. In today's environment, Incyte
would never get spleen size as a dominant MF endpoint. Fast forward to modern times, and meaningful
endpoints like OS benefit is much more relevant to patients for curing solutuions versus only mostly a
palliative drug like jakafi.

Alpha Exposure: 4.7 is NOT the same as 0.0, and simply cannot be used as a proxy for a placebo. A
statement like that damages your credibility.

would you take half an advil if you have a headache? or how about only taking half of the recommended
antibiotics needed when you have an infection?


4.7 was a starting point where the minimum is predicted, but was not effective because it's too low of a
dose.


Data support 9.4 mg/kg as an appropriate starting dose for the relapsed/refractory MF patient population


Objectives:
- Define proper dosing by evaluating potential therapeutic range of the drug
4.7 mg/kg q3w: lowest dose where telomerase inhibition is predicted
9.4 mg/kg q3w: max dosing regimen derived from the Mayo Pilot Study
- Confirm efficacy in high unmet need population using current established regulatory endpoints

Hello Alpha Exposure, I sent you a private message on SA about an upcoming discussion on GERN
where I would like you to participate and defend your position, along with one or two other Geron authors. I
haven’t heard back from you yet. Could you maybe respond to my message please? Thanks

So can you all see now how it is not far-fetched how the FDA holds came about by surprise out of the blue
back in time over a closed ET defunct trial that resulted in kicking almost all the patients off Dr. Tefferi's
Mayo Trial or we'd have more patients alive and alot more valuable data. These corrupt people stir the pot
and there substantial numbers of conflicts of interest over at the FDA as reported by an investigative
underground research team years ago at CBS.

at least their best thing to do is to delete your comment. Imelstate can receive a total of 600 million upfront
cash payment from Jassen. I don't agree with the author saying this stock is literally worth 0.50 target
price. The stock is now margin-able and many institutional investors are buying in. A strong bullish
strength is building up and good luck on losing more money.
