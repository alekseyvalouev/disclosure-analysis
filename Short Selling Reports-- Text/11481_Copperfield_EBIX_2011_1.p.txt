EBIX


Winston Churchill's famous quote, "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,"
might as well have been targeting Ebix Inc. (NASDAQ:EBIX). EBIX has been an
aggressive acquirer of a variety of companies over the years, many of which focus on
the insurance industry. The company's offering mix is a confusing amalgamation of
niche products that all have a "roll-up" stench. Robin Raina, EBIX's CEO, has liberally
described his business with the buzz words du jour, such as "exchanges," "CRM," "The
Cloud," and "SaaS."


The stock has performed well, fueled by retail investor interest, momentum publications
like Investors' Business Daily and minimal scrutiny from analysts. We believe that EBIX
is nothing more than a roll-up that has materially misrepresented its business (relative to
the CEO's buzz words) as well as its organic growth. Its business model is predicated
on two principals: tax arbitrage and dramatic cost cuts (headcount reductions and
offshoring), neither of which is sustainable. Further, the company's tax arbitrage may be
more than "just" unsustainable, it may actually be illegal.

EBIX's problems run deeper than unusual accounting. The EBIX story also comes with
multiple auditor resignations, governance abuses, misrepresented organic growth,
questionable cash flow and a contentious CEO. Below we address these concerns in
great detail. Given the gravity of these issues, we have notified the IRS and the SEC of
the material abuses at EBIX. We hope the warranted scrutiny saves investors from
significant losses as the true EBIX story gets told.


EBIX shares are worth no more than $9.00, a level that would represent a 65% decline
from current prices. We arrive at our target by adjusting current consensus estimates for
a 35% tax rate (where it will likely go), and applying a generous market multiple of 12x
normalized earnings (consensus estimates include assumptions that are unattainable
and adjust for oddities such as amortization, while failing to contemplate massive
underinvestment in sales and R&D). We estimate that the company has less than $0.75
of de novo earnings power.


Part I of this his report will detail:


1) The History of a Roll-up & Its "Slash & Burn" Strategy. The $970 million of "value
creation" imbedded in EBIX's valuation is likely to collapse given the myriad of issues
the company currently faces.


2) EBIX's Atrocious Organic Growth and Manipulative Metrics. Investors have a
distorted view of the company's growth profile. We estimate organic growth was
negative in 2009 and was less than 4% in 2010. Management's definition of organic
growth is highly manipulative and demonstrates the deceptive nature of the CEO.


3) Growth Crippled by Suspiciously Low Sales and R&D Expense. EBIX's extremely
low sales and marketing and product development expenses are not consistent with a
technology company. EBIX's company-wide sales and marketing expense was $2
million less than the stand alone run-rate of a recent acquisition. This acquired company
that outspent EBIX was 1/20th of EBIX's size. EBIX's margins are overstated and will be
crippled by massive reinvestment to avoid larger declines in organic growth. The only
segment of EBIX's business that has not benefited from a recent acquisition declined
27% in the fourth quarter.

4) ADAM Assumptions are Incomprehensible and Will Drive Disappointment in
2011. EBIX recently closed its largest acquisition to date. EBIX must improve ADAM's
margins by 2,500 basis points on day one, grow faster than ADAM did in the previous 3
years, recognize no D&A expenses and recognize a zero percent tax rate to generate
the $0.15 of accretion that the company has guided to. This overly aggressive guidance
will result in negative earnings revisions relative to analyst's elevated expectations.


Part II of this his report will detail: 
5) Potentially Illegal Tax Strategy and Impact on Earnings and Valuation.


EBIX utilizes two strategies to reduce taxes to nearly zero. The first strategy suggests a
lack of oversight from auditors and earnings manipulation. The second is more sinister
and potentially illegal. Through a series of superficial transactions that pose no business
purpose other than to avoid U.S. taxes, EBIX was able to turn each dollar of foreign
revenue into $1.40 of profits in 2010. This tax strategy is not sustainable in the near, or
intermediate, term. A higher tax rate in the future will dramatically change the economics
of EBIX's business, significantly impair its earnings expectations, and could subject the
company to significant fines, penalties and back taxes.


6) Free Cash Flow Myth. Many investors use free cash flow to justify EBIX's valuation.
We believe EBIX's free cash flow is a highly distorted metric given limited cash R&D
expense and its questionable tax strategy. In fact, if investors simply adjust for a
normalized tax rate, then EBIX trades at 37x free cash flow. Taken a step further, and
adjusting for R&D expense for acquired technology costs (acquisitions in the cash flow
from investing segment), then EBIX trades at nearly 50x free cash.


7) Significant Quality of Earnings Issues. EBIX appears to manage earnings through
accounting shenanigans, including accounts receivable and its allowance for doubtful
accounts. The very low level of acquisition price allocated to non-indefinite intangibles is
highly suspicious for a technology company and points to a lack of auditor oversight and
a desire to overstate earnings through lower amortization. In 2010, EBIX generated
almost $0.20 of earnings that are unlikely to repeat in 2011, which could drive
incremental earnings disappointment.


Part III of this his report will detail:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/259998-ebix-not-a-chinese-fraud-but-a-house-of-cards-nonetheless-part-i?source=all_articles_title 4/14


8) History of Auditor Turnover, Shockingly Low Audit Fees and Accounting Red
Flags. Investors should view EBIX's stated financials with extreme skepticism given the
myriad accounting and oversight issues. EBIX has had four different auditors over the
past seven years. Management's explanation for the high auditor turnover does not
reconcile with the company's filings. EBIX pays its tiny regional auditing firm less than
$350,000 a year in audit fees, a tiny fraction of the audit fees that are paid by companies
EBIX's size.


9) Controversial CEO Appears to Demonstrate a History of Misrepresentation.
EBIX's CEO does not allow analysts or investors access to other members of his
management team. This alone is cause for concern about what Robin is hiding. The
CEO makes 1,250% more than any other employee. The company's lack of bench
strength will again be on full display at their second ever analyst day on April 1st. The
CEO's charity appears to make outlandish claims relative to its size and scope.


10) SaaS Provider? We Think Not. EBIX's management and analysts claim EBIX is
the next great SaaS provider. This is a gross misrepresentation. SaaS companies
measure their deferred revenue in quarters and years due to the subscription nature of
the business. EBIX's deferred revenue can barely be measured in days and weeks. As a
result, EBIX has minimal visibility relative to real SaaS providers. Also, management
misrepresents its products by classifying the majority of its business as "exchanges."
These misrepresentations are consistent with management's historical actions.


1) The EBIX Roll-up & Its "Slash & Burn" Strategy


EBIX current business has been cobbled together from 18 acquisitions, spanning the
past seven years. Prior to this acquisition spree, EBIX had no growth, less than $15
million in revenue, and at times in 2003 traded with a NEGATIVE enterprise value ($6.2
million market cap with $6.8 million of cash). Today, the company's controversial CEO
has pulled off one of the most unique acquisition arbitrages in history. He has turned
$276 million of acquisitions (Table 1) and very little starting enterprise value into a
company with $1.2 billion of enterprise value. The $970 million of "value creation"
imbedded in EBIX's valuation is likely to collapse given the myriad of issues the
company currently faces.

The economics of the company's acquisition strategy is relatively simple: tax arbitrage
(described later) and dramatic cost cuts (headcount reductions and offshoring to India).
An example of this is the acquisition of E-Z Data in October 2009. A San Gabriel Valley
Tribune story highlighted how EBIX fired 49 of the company's roughly 100 employees
within a week of that acquisition. One former E-Z Data employee remarked: "it was a
wonderful family organization, but this is just a slash and burn."


Synergies are okay. Calling inorganic growth organic is not. This strategy has avoided
criticism and scrutiny by Wall Street analysts, a fact that will likely change when EBIX
begins missing numbers.


2) EBIX's Phantom Organic Growth and Mysterious Metrics


Investors have a distorted view of the company's organic growth profile (historically roll-
ups trade at low earnings multiples). This confusion exists because the company
stopped disclosing revenue from acquisitions in the fourth quarter 2008. EBIX previously
provided revenue contributions from each acquisition. The following was the disclosure
from the BPO segment in the 2008 10-K :


BPO division revenues increased $7.1 million which includes revenue increases of
approximately $5.5 million from EbixBPO’s-Hemet, CA operations (formerly IDS;
acquired in November 2007), $596 thousand from the EbixBPO’s-Portland, MI
operations (formerly Periculum; acquired in April 2008), and $1.1 million from
EbixBPO’s-San Diego, CA operations (formerly ConfirmNet; acquired in November
2008).


This disclosure allowed investors to calculate organic growth, a critical disclosure for a
roll-up strategy. With the collapse in organic growth in 2009, the company has ceased
providing these disclosures.


EBIX has also stopped disclosing the impact of foreign exchange on revenue in the
fourth quarter of 2009. This happened to be the same quarter that foreign exchange
became a tailwind to growth. The pattern of selective disclosures does not stop there.

Management set its organic growth goal of 10% to 15% for 2010. On its fourth quarter
2010 conference call, management stated that the company's organic growth was 11%
in 2010. We believe the company lied. EBIX had organic growth that was significantly
below this figure. Instead of confessing, management appears to have "redefined"
organic growth to include acquisitions. If management is willing to manipulate the
metrics around growth, what else might management be manipulating?


Our analysis suggests that EBIX management is actually recognizing the benefit of a
target's growth BEFORE they were acquired by EBIX. Below is the company's
calculation of organic growth from the 2010 10-k .


Table 2 - EBIX's Calculation of Organic Growth


As Reported Pro Forma As Reported Pro

2010 2010 2009 2009

Basis EPS 1.69 1.71 1.24 1.69


Diluted EPS 1.51 1.52 1.03 1.01


Source: company filings


Below we diagram a hypothetical example of a company growing at 1%, acquires a
company that, previous to the acquisition, was growing at 50%. According to EBIX's
math, this 1% grower had a 24% "organic" growth rate in 2010. Conversely, if the same
target's revenue declined 50% year over year, this 1% grower would have had a -27%
organic growth rate under EBIX's distorted metric. It is clear from this example how
irrelevant EBIX's "definition" of growth has become and that management is trying to
hide a collapsing organic growth profile.

Acquired Rev $ 12.0 $ 6.0

The REAL organic growth over the past two years appears to be relatively minimal. We
caution that this is only an estimate as the company no longer provides enough
disclosure, but estimating the contributions of acquired businesses leads to the
conclusion that EBIX has no growth. Additionally, foreign exchange was a large benefit
to growth given the weakness in the dollar over the past two years. As stated above,
management stopped disclosing this impact. As a result, our organic growth estimates
are likely too high. Table 4 suggests organic growth that was negative in 2009 and only
4% in 2010, FAR BELOW management's goal and insinuations.

3) Growth Crippled by Suspiciously Low Sales and R&D Expense


The atrocious growth profile is not surprising given the cost cutting strategy. EBIX spent
$6.4 million on sales and marketing in 2010, or less than 5% of revenue. As we discuss
below, this absolute spend was less than ADAM's stand-alone sales and marketing
expense. ADAM was 1/20th the size of EBIX. We believe this level of sales and
marketing expense is SEVEN to TEN times lower than many of EBIX's comps as a
percent of revenue (Table 19 below).


In addition, the company only spent $13.6 million on product development (10% of
sales) and less than $2 million on capex in 2010. Product development costs of 10% are
more consistent with companies in mature industries like industrials, not in fast growth
markets as EBIX would have investors believe. As a result, EBIX's margins are
overstated and will be crippled by massive reinvestment to avoid larger declines in
organic growth.


4) ADAM Assumptions are Incomprehensible and Will Drive Disappointment in
2011


In August 2010, EBIX announced the acquisition of ADAM Inc, its largest acquisition to
date. This acquisition closed in February 2011. Like most roll-ups, the music stops as
the acquisitions become too large. It appears this may be the case with ADAM.


Management outlined aggressive assumptions to justify the ADAM acquisition.
Management expects ADAM to be $0.15 accretive in its first year. It is our
understanding that this assumption requires minimal growth of ADAM's revenues.
ADAM represents the first public company that EBIX has acquired, which allows us to
scrutinize the company's assumptions for the first time. According to ADAM's SEC
filings, it generated $27.8 million of revenue (down year-over-year) and a 15.1%
operating margin during the trailing twelve months ending September 30, 2010 (last
data available).

In reviewing two earnings models for EBIX from November 2010 (before ADAM
assumptions were added), we estimate that to generate $0.15 of accretion, ADAM must
generate around $11.5 million in net income to offset 3.6 million shares issued to ADAM
shareholders (see Table 6).

To generate that type of income, ADAM must grow revenues by roughly 4% (the fastest
growth in over three years), improve its operating margin by 2,500 basis points on day
one to 40%, have no D&A costs (more of this later), and recognize a zero percent tax
rate. These assumptions appear outlandish and make us wonder what is really driving
the financial expectations. ADAM already had a 24% operating margin in the last
reported quarter before the acquisition. This overly aggressive guidance will result in
negative earnings revisions relative to analyst's elevated expectations.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

It will be very difficult for EBIX to "slash and burn" ADAM's expenses and still maintain
franchise value and current revenue levels. ADAM was an efficiently run business that
generated a 16.5% median operating margin over the previous five years. The Bynergy
sales cycle was lengthy and required an educated and dedicated sales force. ADAM
employed 36 sales people and spent nearly $8 million a year in sales and marketing
expense. EBIX, on the other hand, employs only 72 sales people across the entire
company and only spent $6 million in sales and marketing in 2010.


It is worth noting that EBIX had over 20x the enterprise value of ADAM prior to the
acquisition (and $2 million less in sales and marketing). We believe ADAM's Bynergy
business could collapse without the support of a dedicated sales force. As management
discussed in the past, its 3rd party indirect channel of insurance brokers had been
largely ineffective - a fact EBIX will not be able to change. We believe the company's
sell side analysts have provided minimal scrutiny on these assumptions (unfortunately a
recurring theme).
