Executive Summary
Spruce Point Is Short Caesarstone 
(CSTE) For the Following Reasons:


4


Our Independent Lab Tests Show CSTE’s Samples May Contain Less Quartz Than Advertised : We ordered 


product samples directly from CSTE (along with samples from 7 competitors) and sent them to a material testing lab. 


Our tests suggests that CSTE’s quartz countertops contain approximately 88-89% quartz vs. the 93% advertised 
industry benchmark. CSTE’s samples contained among the lowest % of quartz among all of the samples tested. In light 


of CSTE’s rising quartz costs, it is possible that it is mitigating price increases by including less quartz. Numerous 


product quality complaints about chipping / staining may also support our conclusions


SEC FOIA Request For CSTE’s Quartz Contracts Show Substantial Cost Pressure: CSTE’s confidentiality period 


for its key quartz supply contracts lapsed on Dec 31, 2014. A FOIA was quickly filed and found that quartz, its key raw 


material cost for its quartz countertops, rose substantially by ~20% in 2014, yet they told investors in its SEC filings the 
impact was just 4%. Before acquiring these documents, CSTE used to request a 1yr confidential period, now they have 


requested 5yr confidential period coverage (what are they hiding?). CSTE just invested $115m to open its new U.S. 


production facility and has indicated it still does not have long-term quartz supply agreements, exposing them to 


increased margin pressure


Dependent on Positioning itself as “Premium,” Competition Rising Fast:  CSTE prominently touts its quartz 


product as “premium” and lists it as the #1 key investment highlight in its investor presentation. In light of our lab testing 


results, and commoditized nature of its products, we believe this positioning may be misleading. With little more than 
style being the main product differentiator, we find it difficult to believe CSTE can maintain its prices while new 


competitors from China and Europe enter the U.S. market at lower price points up to 25% less. The recent Chinese 


Yuan devaluation will add further price pressure. We obtained dealer price quotes to support our claim of price 


pressures. Further, we note that CSTE’s R&D headcount and margin have been shrinking every year and its largest 
competitor, Cosentino has launched a new super premium material called Dekton. Early indications show it is gaining 


rapid traction

Questionable Market Share Gains: CSTE's story to investors is that its North American market is growing, and it is 


gaining market share. It cites a custom, paid-for, research provider paid for by CSTE called Freedonia Market Research. 


Since 2010, the report indicates its market share in Australia has declined, Canadian market share has been flat (2012-
2014), but that it is gaining significant market share in the U.S. - up from 14% in 2010, to 19% in 2014. Ascertaining true 


market shares are difficult given all are private companies (ex: CSTE), so we sourced proprietary U.S. import shipping 


data collected from port documents. Since CSTE is Israeli-based and dependent on importing to the U.S. market, we 


believe our data is highly reliable, and it indicates that its market share may not be growing
Spruce Point Sees 40% – 75% 
Downside In CSTE Shares

Auditor Concerns, Signs of Financial Strain: CSTE is audited in Israel by Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer. Two 


recent inspection reports revealed audit deficiencies including failure to perform sufficient procedures to test 


revenue and test the existence of inventory. Upon closer inspection, we find CSTE has abnormal days sales 


outstanding, payables, and inventory turnover ratios relative to peers


Cracks in the Story, Massive Overvaluation, Majority Owner Liquidating: CSTE’s price recently corrected after 


Q2’15 earnings beat Wall St. estimates, but it cut its sales range from $515-$525m to $495-$505m, while 


maintaining its EBITDA guidance. We believe this is the canary in the coal mine, and CSTE’s EBITDA margins 


appear overstated. CSTE is at risk of missing its goals in light of flat import tonnage growth and rising competition.


CSTE trades at 3.4x and 13.5x 2015 Sales and EBITDA, respectively, a huge premium to building products peers at 


1.3x and 12.0x on the premise it can maintain share and grow sales 15% p.a. We believe CSTE should trade at a 


discount to peers of 8x - 10x EBITDA given our concerns about product + earnings quality (sales growth slowing + 


margin pressures), its shares would be worth $11 - $29 (40% – 75% downside) on a normalized EBITDA margin 


range. Since its 2012 IPO, its shareholder has reduced ownership from 79.0% to 32.6%; we expect continued sales


Unquantifiable Product Liability for Silicosis-Related Deaths: CSTE is a party to a growing number of lawsuits 


related to death and injury as it relates to injuries suffered by workers and fabricators of its products in Israel (from 


14 in 2012, to 60 today). A single plaintiff and motion for class action certification alleges a $56m damage. CSTE’s 


insurer said it would only be partially covered, thus exposing CSTE to a material risk. CSTE is also in the process of 


opening its new facility in the U.S. and OSHA has recently warned about the dangers of silicosis, specifically 


highlighting issues in Israel. Increasing regulatory scrutiny could drive up its cost of doing business

Margins May Be Significantly Overstated:  CSTE’s gross margins of 42% are substantially higher than its peers in 


the building products sector which average 22%. Because it is the only publicly traded quartz countertop company, it 


is difficult to disprove its margins. However, we’ve pulled private financials for Cosentino S.A. (largest Spanish 


competitor) along with other private financials for Italian stone and countertop makers and find that CSTE’s margins 


appear vastly superior. We’ve also obtained CSTE's Australian and Singapore subsidiary filings which indicate gross 


margins of 24.7% and 31.6%, respectively. We believe currency effects are masking up to 7% gross margin erosion. 


We also find its raw material costs to revenues to be abnormally low. There are also many related party transactions 


with its largest shareholder that could enable operating margin overstatement. We also question CSTE’s distribution 


deal through IKEA, which is inconsistent with its premium brand image and carries lower margins

Samples Obtained Directly From Caesarstone Samples We Tested


We obtained samples directly from Caesarstone to test the 93% quartz content claims
Lab Testing Results Suggest CSTE’s 
Countertops May Not Contain 
The Advertised Quartz Content


9


• A majority of quartz countertops in the marketplace, including Caesarstone, advertise their products as 93% quartz


• We collected quartz countertop samples from a 8 different manufacturers and engaged the Rutgers University Department of Mate rials 
Science & Engineering to conduct a Thermogravimatric Analysis (TGA). Two runs were conducted on each sample 


• In order not to bias the researcher, we did not inform the lab which brand we were investigating 
• Simply stated, a TGA analysis involves putting the samples in a furnace and raising the temperature to 600


o
C where the inorganic 


materials such as resins would burn off at high temperatures, and reveal the indicative quartz content 
• A countertop with 93% quartz would experience a weight loss of approximately 7% (greater weight loss = less quartz content). As can 


be seen from the table, two Caesarstone samples ranked among the highest average weight loss at 10.5% and 11.3%, indicating 
that its quartz content was 3.5 – 4.5% less than advertised. The only sample that performed worse was one of the Chinese import 


samples from Element Quartz!

Thermogravimatric Analysis (TGA)

Caesarstone samples test poorly against competitor samples:


• The graphs below presents the graphical results of the TGA Analysis for Run 1 and Run 2, respectively.  As can be seen the samples all 


achieve a baseline Wt. % Loss at about 500oC meaning the majority of all the organic content has been completely evolved,  hence 
comparison of the values at 600oC to add an additional level of confidence  


• One notable event occurs for the Cambria sample in Run 1 at about 750oC, this is likely some form of phase transformation present in one 
of the inorganic Quartz materials, sometimes known as calcination when a carbonate group is evolved from an inorganic mineral .  It is not 


present in Run 2 and irrelevant for this analysis
• Ultimately, it is the expert opinion of the Testing Lab that there are statistically different values between the average binder content in these 


samples.  It is outside the realm of their expertise to understand how the amount of resin binder improves the overall quality of a Quartz 
synthetic countertop.  However, one can speculate that the true engineered quality component of the countertop structure is l ikely the resin 


material and the more that is used the more the overall properties can be tailored to achieve a final result beyond aesthetic qualities

Warning: CSTE Offers Conflicting 
Explanations For Margin Contraction


14(1) Disclosed or implied from SEC 20-F Filings


2014 Annual Report (page 43):  “In 2014, gross profit 


margins decreased mainly due to unfavorable exchange 
rates, increased IKEA business related to fabrication and 


installation activities, which comes with lower gross margin 
and a non-recurring $3.5 million credit to cost of revenues 


from 2013.” 


And later a slightly different story (page 49): “..cost of 
revenues increased primarily due to volume increases and, 


to a lesser extent, due to the IKEA installation and fabrication 
component. Also contributing to the increased cost of 


revenues were the elevated production levels of our 
differentiated super natural collection, which, despite 


incurring a premium in price from consumers, carries higher 
manufacturing costs, and an increase in quartz raw material 


prices” (1)


Annual Report (page 35): “The price of quartz was relatively 


stable until 2013. However, given increasing global demand 
for quartz, quartzite prices increased by approximately 4%


in 2014 and have increased at approximately the same 
rate in 2015. Any future increases in quartz prices may 


adversely impact our margins and net income.”


CFO on the Q4 Conf Call: “Quartz prices went up and that 
caused around less than 60 basis points impact on gross 


margin for Q4. In 2015, we expect some additional pressure 
from quartz pricing, again, not much less than 60 basis points.”

What is really driving margins; FX, dilutive IKEA deals, Quartz; can CSTE precisely explain? Or is this another potential red flag of 
further margin contraction?

Stone Fabricators (CSTE’s Main Customers) Are 
Worried About Margin Contraction


15


• CSTE supplies its products primarily to fabricators, who in turn resell them to contractors, developers, builders and consume rs. CSTE 


says in its 20-F, “Direct sales accounted for 86.6% of revenues and are mostly to fabricators.” 


• It is critically important to understand what fabricators are saying about the state of the market, and not just take what the 


company says at face value


• According to Stone World’s 2015 Fabricator Survey:


• The percentage of fabrication shops processing both natural stone and quartz surfacing has remained consistent for the last three 
years at 78% in 2014, 79% in 2013 and 76% in 2012


• The percentage of fabricators indicating that small margins are their greatest challenge increased from 26% to 37% (2014 – 2015) 
• When asked about the level of competition in the stone market, 41% said it increased vs. 2013 while 42% say it stayed the same


• If CSTE’s largest customer base is worried about smaller margins, what do you think CSTE is also worried about?

“I have had the black Caesarstone 


installed 6 years ago. It has chipped in 3 
places no impact either. It has one scratch 


in it. It has dulled out. I would never buy 
this product again”


“I work at a marble shop. Caesar stone 


have problems on slabs from time to time. 
I say 10-20% of the time. Their customer 


service is non-exist”


“Can’t say anything good about my brown 
Caeserstone countertops. I have white 


pitting marks that range from a pin head 
size to a pea size all over two of my 


counters”


“My whole experience with the installers and the 
Caeserstone reps has been a joke but I am not 


laughing.


“In my previous apartment, where I lived for 6 
years, I had granite countertops, and I didn’t 


have any problems. I so much regret that I 
choose this Caesar stone. I am trying to get it 


replaced, but I am not sure I will be successful. I 
am telling all my friends and people I know 


never to choose Caesar stone and I want to 
warn anybody who comes across this post to be 


aware of sub par quality of Caesar stone”


“I think Caestarstone is a beautiful product. It 


looks great and the warranty sounds 
great. But I would NOT recommend this 


product at all. I truly regret my decision to 
install this product in my kitchen”


“The countertop looks fabulous WHEN it is 


clean. However, cleaning it is quite a process. The 
countertop shows watermarks, streaks from the 


"method" cleaner they recommend and scratches are 
very visible. The countertops also chip VERY easily”


“Be wary of using this product for two reasons. It 


stains and scratches easily and they will not sell to 
licensed contractors, only certified fabricators”


“I had the Caesarstone rep come to our home 


twice. Both times he worked on several spots with 
his bag of tricks. So I learned how to eliminate 


spots, but they just keep coming day after day. AND 
THESE ARE WATER SPOTS!!!” 


Bottom line, don't believe the CS hype - if a 


cellphone leaves an imprint, that tell's it all! I would 
never purchase this product again. If anyone thinks 


that the CS warranty covers everything - guess 
again.

Outrageously High Gross Margin Relative to 
Leading U.S. Building Products Peers


Suspiciously Low Raw Materials / Revenues vs. 
Foreign Stone and Countertop Makers

• As a producer of a commoditized building products, CSTE’s gross margins are outrageously higher, with no clearly 


identifiable reason, than any publicly traded U.S. company tied to housing products including doors, pools, windows, 


decking, flooring and ceilings, and cabinets


• CSTE competes directly with foreign private companies, so we pulled financials for leading stone manufacturing and 


countertop makers in both Spain and Italy. Due to differences in financial reporting standards, we compared CSTE’s 


disclosures of raw materials usage to total revenues, and found they reported a materially lower margin

Significant Margin Erosion Appears To 
Be Masked by FX Benefit


22


Note: As provided by company SEC correspondence, Australian sales take place in US$ and as such there is no impact of currency 
exposure to Australian and USA sales.  Currency depreciation assumptions from Q2 -14 to Q2-15: Shekel 0.2886 to 0.2583, C$ 0.9170 to 


0.8132, EUR 1.1372 to 1.1063.  This analysis is for illustrative purposes.


Real margins would be
Approximately 3.7% – 5.0% 


lower than reported
and although


Caesarstone will
continue to realize a
currency benefit over


2015, we believe that
margins will continue


to face headwinds
going forward


• In the recent quarter, CSTE provided commentary about revenues on a constant currency basis. For example. Its headline boasted, 


“Revenue Up 9.9% to a Record $127.5 million, up 20.2% on a Constant Currency Basis” 
• However the Company does not indicate the precise effect foreign currencies had on gross margins or EBITDA


• Our pro forma analysis attempts to adjust CSTE’s gross margins to illustrate what they would look like if there were no change in currency 
year-over-year. We make some assumptions about the percentage of Cost of Goods Sold incurred in the Israeli Shekel, where a majo rity of 


its manufacturing took place
• By removing the FX effects, we estimate that CSTE is facing significant margin erosion in its core business. We will detail why we 


believe this is the case in the coming slides
• It is worth noting that CSTE recently cut its sales guidance range to $495m to $505m (from $515m to $525m) while holding its 2015 EBITDA 


forecast unchanged and cited “slightly lower-than-expected U.S. growth and the further negative impact of foreign exchange rates” as the 
reason for the guidance reduction. However, a closer look suggests that the FX effect masked underlying margin erosion in itsbusiness

We sourced quotes from dealers for some basic Caesarstone Classico designs (originally introduced in 1987). Since 


then, the company has introduced three additional product collections, Concetto, Motivo and Supremo, which are 


marketed as specialty high-end product collections. Our basic price quotes came in around $1,600 - $1,700 (pre-tax) for 


a basic countertop with sink cut out.

Pental Quartz Q From MSI


We sourced quotes from dealers of three competing brands and found substantially lower price estimates, upwards of 


25% less than Caesarstone’s prices. Prices ranged from $1,287 to $1,427 for the exact same project and dimensions. 


What was more perplexing, some dealers indicated to us that Caesarstone had recently raised prices by a couple 


percent even in the face of lower priced entrants.

order to inflate its margins and ultimately its stock price. We observe that the Kibbutz has sold its stock through secondary issuances 


since coming public twice already, netting it approximately $260m

Israel Society of Pulmonology Israel Ministry of Health 


• Silicosis is an occupational lung disease that is progressive and sometimes fatal, and is characterized by scarring of the lungs and 


damage to the breathing function
• CSTE is party to 60 pending (up from 41 a year ago and 14 in 2012) bodily injury lawsuits that have been filed against it directly 


since 2008 in Israel or that have named it as third-party defendants by fabricators or their employees in Israel, by the injured successors, 
by the State of Israel or by others. It has also received ten letters (up from 9 a year ago) threatening to file claims against it on behalf of 


certain fabricators and their employees in Israel.
• Most of the claims do not specify a total amount of damages sought, as the plaintiff’s future damages will be determined at t rial; 


however, damages totaling approximately $22.3m are specified in 55 of the claims currently pending against us in Israel (excluding the 
claim that is seeking class action recognition)

• CSTE has an unusual and significant spread between its DSO and DPO. The spread of 30 at year end 2014 was 


the widest in the past 4 years. This suggests that CSTE is trying to stretch out its payables as far as it can to generate 


temporary cash from operations and may be having trouble collecting from its customers 


• Analysis of U.S. Building Products Peers:  Suggest a normalized DSO and DPO is around 33 – 35 with minimal

• Caesarstone often touts its “World Class Manufacturing and R&D Capabilities” to “maintain innovative and leading

In November 2013, CSTE announced it would accelerate its initial investment of its US manufacturing facility, which 


was originally planned to cost $100m. As of its latest 20-F filing, the expected costs have risen to $115m. However, 


our greater concern is that CSTE is expanding its manufacturing into a rapidly saturated market where there are 


already 4 major producers in North America, and more than a dozen imports.

CSTE Announces IKEA Partnership


Our Take On This Deal


• Highly inconsistent with CSTE’s “premium” branding strategy 
to sell through a low cost retailer such as IKEA


• CSTE gets limited/no brand exposure with this deal. Our visits 
to IKEA revealed no in-store exposure that CSTE’s brands 


were being sold; similar to catalogue exposure (left)
• Sales through IKEA lower CSTE’s gross margins because 


CSTE has to bear the cost of fabrication and installation
• We believe the IKEA deal may support our case that CSTE’s 


gross margins are too high, and the deal could be used to 
explain away CSTE’s margin deterioration

“Premium brand with superior customer value proposition”


Analysts’ and CSTE’s Investment Highlights


Difficult to define what is a “premium” quartz countertop, 


customer decisions come down mostly to style preference. 


Cosentino has introduced a Dekton, a super premium offering


CSTE’s quartz supply contract from our SEC FOIA request 


indicates that a sharp rise in quartz is a significant 


headwind. The plant expansion is over-budget and comes 


at a time when the market is getting more competitive. 


CSTE’s Ikea deal appears brand and margin dilutive and 


provides a nice cover for bigger margin issues


Spruce Point’s Rebuttal


R&D margin has been declining. Majority of quartz countertop 


manufacturers all use the same Breton equipment. CSTE has 


introduced only a few new collections in the past few yrs


Competitors already up to 25% lower in price. Our checks 


indicate CSTE has raised prices by low single digits, with 


some dealers telling us “they don’t understand why”


“World class R&D and manufacturing capabilities, 


capable of product innovations”


“Ability to raise prices to offset FX pressures and 


other short-term margin issues”


“Quartz countertops currently have just 8% of the global 


countertop market, but we expect significant market 


share gains as the surface becomes better known 


among consumers.”


“CSTE remains the same story today as it was when the 


company IPO‘ed in March 2012.”


“Margins have been and will continue to be buffeted by 


currency headwinds and the U.S. Plant expansion 


scheduled for 2015, but excluding these factors, margins 


are growing”


CSTE cites a paid-for research firm to source its market 


research figures. Import shipping data suggests US market 


share gains may not be growing


Simply not true. The quartz countertop market has become 


more competitive and consumer have more lower priced 


options and greater style varieties to choose from


“Well positioned to benefit from housing recovery as 


repair and remodeling spending continues”
No exposure to multi family housing. DIY remodeling retailers 


Lowes and Home Depot sell Silestone, LG Viatera and other 


brands, not CSTE’s products
Sales and Margins To Remain Challenged, 
First Signs of a Cracked Growth Story


51


Sales Growth Unlikely to Accelerate Margins Remain Questionable


• CSTE’s sales growth rate has declined markedly and we 


believe it will continue to decline:


• 2012-2013: sales growth: 20%


• 2013-2014: sales growth: 25%


• 2015E: sales growth (per guidance): 12%


• CSTE’s Q2’15 sales guidance reduction from 


$515-$525m to $495-$505m is the canary in the coal mine 


signaling further disappointments


• Disappointment comes despite the added Ikea distribution 


deals from 2013 and access to the DIY market


• 2016E (consensus estimate) of 18% sales growth is wildly 


optimistic considering that:


• The Chinese Yuan devaluation just made Chinese 


imports even cheaper


• CSTE is not levered to the multifamily housing which 


is a big driver of the U.S. housing cycle


• Import data of CSTE’s slabs has been stagnant


• New “super premium” category led by Dekton is 


being created and being marketed through the DIY 


channels like Home Depot


• Questions about product quality and customer 


complaints remain


• Despite cutting its sales guidance, CSTE maintained its EBITDA 


range of $123 – 129m (25.2% margin at the midpoint)


• Maintaining its EBITDA margin seems remarkable in light of the 


following:


• In its SEC filing, CSTE indicated it expected quartz prices to go 


up in 2015 by a similar amount from 2014. Based on our public 


access of its key quartz supply agreement, this would imply 


another 20% increase in 2015. (CSTE has not indicated it has 


long-term supply agreements for its new U.S. facility)


• There is rampant evidence of increased price competition in the 


quartz countertop market from new entrants at price points of 


25% less. Dealer quotes support our claim of pricing pressures


• R&D expense and margins are already razor thin. Any further 


cuts to R&D could sacrifice further product innovation and 


future competitiveness


• On the Q2’15 call CSTE explains it will get an EBITDA benefit by 


lowering U.S. plant start up expense from $11m to just $1.5m as a 


result of “less pressure to ramp up.” We interpret this to mean they 


see weak customer demand


• As illustrated, if margins are evaluated on a constant currency basis, 


CSTE margins could be up to 7% less


• CSTE’s Sales and Marketing margins have fallen sharply. If they 


don’t spend more on marketing, sales growth will decline, and if they 


do market more, EBITDA margins will be impacted lower


• Open question remains about the degree of benefit from the 


related-party deals with the Kibbutz

Analysts have pinned Caesarstone’s entire earnings growth story on 2016 in the hopes that its U.S. Facility expansion will en able 


massive earnings growth. However, we believe the expansion is too little too late as many new cheaper imports have come to th e 
North American market. Furthermore, the Company has yet to address its quartz supply issues and as of its May 6 th conference call, 


stated that it is still looking for quartz sources in the United States. In the mean time, we believe CSTE will have to continue sourcing 
quartz from Turkey. Its EBITDA margins dwarf any public company in the building product sector.

CSTE Should Trade At A Discount Peers Suggest 10 – 20% EBITDA Margin Range


We believe CSTE’s 26% EBITDA margins appear to be overstated due to: 1) Underutilization of quartz in its product as suggeste d by our 


independent lab test and 2) Related party transactions that could enable below market operating expenses 3) FX issues masking core 
margin weakness. A peer analysis of foreign stone and countertop producers along with a broad set of U.S. building product peers suggest 


a normalized  10 – 20% EBITDA margin range. If we applied this range to CSTE’s 2015E Sales of $500m, normalized EBITDA would be 
$50m - $100m. Applying a below market multiple of 8 – 10x EBITDA implies a share price between $11 and $29.

TGA Results 


Thermogravimatric analysis was selected as an appropriate means to determine the mass percentage of 


organic binder matrix used in cementing aggregate Quartz particles together to form the supplied  


countertop material samples.  This was based upon the commonly accepted fact that the majority of 


organic materials burn and decompose when heated in air at atmospheric pressure to temperatures of 


600oC, and completely evolved by 1000oC. For comparative purposes it is typical to compare values at 


600oC.   There are no known organic materials that will not burn in air at these temperatures.  Where as 


the inorganic natural quartz material is primarily inert in air at these temperatures.  This makes for very 


effective analysis.  Table1 summarizes the results of the TGA analysis.  TGA analysis is accomplished 


through the utilization of an extremely accurate apparatus that consists of a specially designed analytical 


balance suspended within a ceramic heating element furnace, along with computer controlled software 


that allows data collection and analysis of results.

Table 1 TGA Analysis of Countertop Materials
From the analysis of the data presented in Table 1 two conclusions can be drawn.  Firstly, there is a 


statistically significant difference in the Wt. % loss during heating between the various subjects due to 


the thermal evolution of the binder materials.  With the maximum loss being reported for Element  


Quartz EQS101 of 13.08 Wt. % loss and a minimum Wt. % loss of 7.06 for the Element Quartz EQS118 


Toasted Almond sample.  Secondly, there is a statistically significant difference in the standard deviation 


of the test samples with a range of values from 0.07 to 1.45.  This makes the data only slightly more 


difficult to interpret.  It is thought that this range of STDEV is a result of the relatively small size of the 


TGA sample with respect to the countertop block and more importantly the particle size distribution 


within the individual samples.  It is as well understood principle that the amount of polymeric resin 


bonding material used to cement aggregate particles together is related on an exponential function to 


the particle size and particle size distribution of a composite matrix.  More simply stated, very small 


particles have a very high surface area and naturally will require more polymer resin to completely cover 


the surface.  Concurrently a large range of particle size, i.e. small and large will effect the grinding and 


sampling for TGA analysis.  That being said one must take the large variability on some samples into 


consideration when drawing conclusions.  This could be rectified with additional samples, and more 


extensive evaluation.     





Ultimately, it is our expert opinion that there is statistically different values between the average binder 


content in these samples.  It is outside the realm of our expertise to understand how the amount of 


resin binder improves the overall quality of a Quartz synthetic countertop.  However, one can speculate 


that the true engineered quality component of the countertop structure is likely the resin material and 


the more that is used the more the overall properties can be tailored to achieve a final result beyond 


aesthetic qualities.  





Figure 1a and b presents the graphical results of the TGA Analysis for Run1 and Run2, respectively.  As 


can be seen the samples all achieve a baseline Wt. % Loss at about 500oC meaning the majority of all the 


organic content has been completely evolved, hence comparison of the values at 600oC to add an 


additional level of confidence.  One notable event occurs for the Cambria sample in Run 1 at about 


750oC, this is likely some form of phase transformation present in one of the inorganic Quartz materials, 


sometimes known as calcination when a carbonate group is evolved from an inorganic mineral.  It is not 


present in Run 2 and irrelevant for this analysis.

X-Ray Diffraction analysis 


Figure 2 below presents the XRD spectra for Viatera.  The spectra  aligns well with the ICSD International 


Crystalline Solids Database for Silica, SiO2. More commonly known as quartz, when obtained from 


naturally occurring sources.  In Figure 2, the large window represents the 2theta vs. intensity spectra for 


the Viatera sample with a smaller window representing the peak positions below for the Quartz 


standard.  The precise alignment of the peak positions in both windows indicate a compositional match.

In Figure 3 the remaining samples are overlaid upon each other for comparison to determine similarity 


in chemical composition. It can be seen there is little difference between the samples.  This is evidenced  


by the similarity between the position and intensity ratio of the overlays.  Compositional differences are 


apparent but are minor and a result of what is typically realized from various mining locations and raw 


material sources. It is unlikely that the minor compositional differences have a significant impact on the 


physical or chemical properties of the finished countertop.  However the inclusion and distribution of 


various quantities of fine grains and aggregates are used to produce aesthetic effects like color and 


appearance. It is valuable to note that the primary peak for Quartz at 2theta = 27o is present in all 


samples giving the definitive compositional identification.   








Figure 4 a through I are the remaining counter top samples compared against the Quartz ICSD standard.  


Obvious differences in the relative intensity (left axis) are due to x-ray beam samples interactions and 


are not indicative of compositional differences.  As can be seen for each spectra the position of the 


peaks are consistent with the Quartz ICSD standard.

Density Analysis 





The 10 countertop materials were evaluated for their density using the Archimedes principle of water 


displacement.  The values were measured to 3 significant digits and found to be highly repeatable.

Table 2 Density (gm/cc) of Countertop Materials
Vickers Hardness Measurements 


Vickers hardness is well suited for the evaluation of brittle ceramic (Quartz) materials due to the nature 


of the diamond indenter tip.  This diamond tip shown at the left is precisely loaded with a known force 


and driven into the sample surface causing permanent deformation, also shown.  This permanent 


deformation is then measured precisely at the micrometer level using a high power microscope and 


commercially available software.  From the size of the indent and the force applied it is a simple 


calculation to derive the Vickers Indentation hardness (Hv).  Prior to testing the system is calibrated 


using a hardness standard. 


The measured values of Vickers Hardness (HV) are given in Table 3 


for each of the countertop material samples.  As a point of 


comparison pure fused SiO2, silca, commercial quartz have Hv 


values of about 1000 and pure diamond the hardest substance 


known is about 10000.  It is not surprising and as expected that the 


hardness of these resin bonded quartz composites reflect the 


weaker of the matrix, namely the resin.  During the application of 


the force to the countertop composite it was decided that an area 


representative of the overall composite structure would be 


sampled.  More specifically the hardness was not measured 


directly upon a large aggregate of quartz for the comparison of 


these materials.   The diamond indenter was applied to an area 


with approximate equal fractions of both materials.  As far as 


materials in general are concerned, the countertop materials are 


very rigid and stiff but not extremely hard which is likely beneficial 


to the home owner, exhibiting forgiveness when handling glass 


and other impact sensitive housewares.

From the comparison of the analytical data one can draw some general conclusions that are supported 


by well established Material Science and Engineering Principles.  When a soft (resin) and hard (Quartz) 


material are combined in a composite structure the engineered structure has properties that result from 


the combination of the material properties.   


It is apparent from the data, although not completely linear that as the binder content increases the 


density is reduced, due to an increase in the mass of the lower density phase, namely the resin.  This 


also results in a reduction in the overall Vickers hardness. 


For example the Element Quartz EQS101 Fantasy has the highest resin content, (13.08%) and the lowest 


density (2.140 gm/cc), and lowest measured hardness (Hv 61.5). 


Additionally, the Element Quartz EQS118 Toasted Almond has the lowest resin content (7.06%), the 


highest density (2.451 gm/cc), and near highest hardness (Hv 127). 


As stated early this is a general trend but well supported by engineering principles and not completely 


consistent throughout the sample data.  


It is beyond the scope of this analysis at this stage to consider how these measured parameters effect 


other countertop material properties like water absorption, and stain resistance to name a few,  But 


well within the capabilities of additional analysis.

Independent Auditor’s Report
For the financial year ended 31 December 2013


Independent Auditor’s Report to the Member of Caesarstone South East Asia Pte. Ltd.


Report on the Financial Statements


We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Caesarstone South East Asia Pte. Ltd
(the “Company”), which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2013, and the statement of
comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the financial
year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
information.


Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements


Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view
in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and
Singapore Financial Reporting Standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that
they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair profit and loss accounts and
balance sheets and to maintain accountability of assets.


Auditor’s Responsibility


Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing. Those standards require
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.


An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.


We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.

1. Corporate information


Caesarstone South East Asia Pte. Ltd. (the “Company”) is a limited liability company
incorporated and domiciled in Singapore. The immediate and ultimate holding company is
Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd, a company incorporated in Israel.


The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is located at 10 Bukit
Batok Crescent, #08-06 The Spire, Singapore 658079.


The principal activity of the Company is that of the distribution of building materials. There
has been no significant change in the nature of this activity during the financial year.


2. Summary of significant accounting policies


2.1 Basis of preparation


The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial
Reporting Standards (“FRS”). 


The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as
disclosed in the accounting policies below.


The financial statements are presented in Euro (“€”).


Going concern assumption


The Company incurred a net loss of €388,227 (2012: €499,565) during the financial year
ended 31 December 2013 and as at that date the Company’s total liabilities exceeded its
total assets by €1,684,257 (2012: €1,296,030). These factors indicate the existence of a
material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends the
holding company undertaking to provide continuing financial support to enable the Company
to continue as a going concern.


If the Company is unable to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, the
Company may be unable to discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business and
adjustments may have to be made to reflect the situation that assets may need to be
realised other than in the normal course of business and at amounts which could differ
significantly from the amounts at which they are currently recorded in the balance sheet. In
addition, the Company may have to reclassify non-current assets and liabilities as current
assets and liabilities. No such adjustments have been made to these financial statements.


2.2 Changes in accounting policies


The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year
except in the current financial year, the Company has adopted all the new and revised
standards and Interpretations of FRS (“INT FRS”) that are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2013. The adoption of these standards and interpretations
did not have any effect on the financial performance or position of the Company.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     16

The directors expect that the adoption of the standards and interpretations above will have
no material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application.


2.4 Foreign currency


The Company’s financial statements are presented in Euro, which is also the Company’s
functional currency.


Transactions and balances


Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the functional currency of the Company
and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currency at exchange rates
approximating those ruling at the transaction dates.  Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of
the reporting period.  Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a
foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial
transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated
using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.


Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating
monetary items at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     17


2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.5 Property, plant and equipment


All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to
recognition, property, plant and equipment other than freehold land and buildings are
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset, if, and only
if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.


Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
as follows:


Renovation - 3 to 5 years
Furniture and fittings - 3 to 5 years
Office equipment - 3 to 5 years
Warehouse equipment - 3 years
Computer equipment - 3 years
Computer software - 3 years


The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.


The residual values, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial
year-end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.


An items of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future
economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.  Any gain or loss arising on
derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.


2.6 Impairment of non-financial assets


The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset
may be impaired.  If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset
is required, the Company makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.


An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other
assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are
taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate
valuation model is used.


The Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast
calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Company’s cash-generating units
to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are
generally covering a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is
calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.


Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss, except for assets that are previously
revalued where the revaluation was taken to other comprehensive income. In this case, the
impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any
previous revaluation.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     18


2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.6 Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)


An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that
previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If
such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s
recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has
been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the
last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is
increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that
would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised
previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is measured at
revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.


2.7 Financial instruments


(a) Financial assets


Initial recognition and measurement


Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Company becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Company
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.


When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus,
in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly
attributable transaction costs.


Subsequent measurement - Loans and receivables


Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables. Subsequent to
initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit
or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, and through
the amortisation process.


Derecognition


A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows
from the asset has expired. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the
difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received
and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive
income is recognised in profit and loss.


Regular way purchase or sale of a financial asset


All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised or
derecognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to
purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales
of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally
established by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     19


2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.7 Financial instruments (continued)


(b) Financial liabilities


Initial recognition and measurement


Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Company becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Company
determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.


All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of other
financial liabilities, plus directly attributable transaction costs.


Subsequent measurement - Financial liabilities at amortised cost


After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through
profit or loss are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities
are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.


Derecognition


A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is
discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by
another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is
treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability,
and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.


(c) Offsetting of financial instruments


Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in
the balance sheets, when and only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right
to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis,
or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.


2.8 Impairment of financial assets


The Company assesses at each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence
that a financial asset is impaired.


Financial assets carried at amortised cost


For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Company first assesses whether objective
evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant,
or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If the Company
determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed
financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets
with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets
that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or
continues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     20


2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.8 Impairment of financial assets (continued)


Financial assets carried at amortised cost (continued)


If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised
cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at
the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the
discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. The
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. The
impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.


When the asset becomes uncollectible, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is
reduced directly or if an amount was charged to the allowance account, the amounts
charged to the allowance account are written off against the carrying value of the financial
asset.


To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets
has been incurred, the Company considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or
significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments.


If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of
the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The amount of reversal is
recognised in profit or loss.


2.9 Cash and cash equivalents


 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits that are readily
convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in value.


2.10 Inventories


Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.


Cost is determined on the weighted average basis and includes all costs of purchase, costs
of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
and condition.


Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to
adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.


Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     21


2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.11 Provisions


Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or
constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the
obligation can be estimated reliably.


Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the
current best estimate.  If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will
be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.  If the effect of the time value of
money is material, provisions are discounted using the current pre tax rate that reflects,
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.  When discounting is used, the increase
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as finance cost.


Warranty provisions


Provisions for warranty-related costs are recognised when the product is sold or service
provided. Initial recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of
warranty-related costs is revised annually.


2.12 Employee benefits


(a) Defined contribution plan


The Company makes contributions to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) scheme in
Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions defined
contribution to pension scheme are recognised as an expense in the period in which
the related service is performed.


(b) Employee leave entitlement


Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they
accrue to employees. The estimated liability for leave is recognised for services
rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.


2.13 Leases


The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement at inception date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is
dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement conveys a right to
use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.


For arrangements entered into prior to 1 January 2005, the date of inception is deemed to be
1 January 2005 in accordance with the transitional requirements of INT FRS 104.


As lessee


Finance leases which transfer to the Company substantially all the risks and rewards
incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the
fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised. Lease payments
are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges
are charged to profit or loss. Contingent rents, if any, are charged as expenses in the
periods in which they are incurred.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.13 Leases (continued)


As lessee (continued)


Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the
asset and the lease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company will obtain
ownership by the end of the lease term.


Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives provided by the lessor is
recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.


2.14 Revenue recognition


Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to
the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is
made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, taking
into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding sales taxes or duty. The
Company assesses its revenue arrangements to determine if it is acting as principal or
agent. The Company has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenue
arrangements. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is
recognised:


Sale of goods


Revenue from sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of significant risk and rewards
of ownership of the goods to the customer usually on delivery of goods.  Revenue is not
recognised to the extent where there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the
consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods.


2.15 Taxes


(a) Current income tax


Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that
are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.


Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the
tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in
the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

2.15 Taxes (continued)


(b) Deferred tax


Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the
end of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.


Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except where the
deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction affects neither
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.


Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable
that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary
differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can
be utilised except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary
difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction
that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither
the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.


The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable
profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting
period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future
taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.


Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to
apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax
rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of
each reporting period.


Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside
profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying
transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred
tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.


Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable
right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities
and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation
authority.


Tax benefits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the
criteria for separate recognition at that date, would be recognised subsequently if
new information about facts and circumstances changed. The adjustment would
either be treated as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if
it incurred during the measurement period or in profit or loss.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     24


2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)


2.15 Taxes (continued)


(c) Sales tax


Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax
except:


 Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not
recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is
recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the
expense item as applicable; and


 Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax
included.


The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is
included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.


2.16 Contingencies


 A contingent liability is:


(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be
confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the Company; or


(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:


(i)  It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation; or


(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.


A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not wholly within the control of the Company.


Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Company,
except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present
obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.

person:


(i) Has control or joint control over the Company;


(ii) Has significant influence over the Company; or


(iii) Is a member of the key management personnel of the Company or of a

member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of
the entity).
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     26


3. Significant accounting judgements and estimates


The preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue,
expenses, assets, and liabilities, and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the end of each
reporting period. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result
in outcomes that could require material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or
liability affected in the future periods.


3.1 Judgement made in applying accounting policies


 There are no significant judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements.


3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty


The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty
at the end of each reporting period are discussed below. The Company based its
assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statement was
prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however,
may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the
company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.


 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment


The cost of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over property, plant and equipment estimated useful lives.  Management estimates
the useful lives of these property, plant and equipment to be within 3 to 5 years.
These are common life expectancies applied to similar categories of property, plant
and equipment. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological
developments could impact the economic useful lives of these assets, therefore,
future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of the
Company’s property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period is
disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements.


 Impairment of loans and receivables


The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any
objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.  To determine whether there is
objective evidence of impairment, the Company considers factors such as the
probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or
significant delay in payments. 


Where there is objective evidence of impairment, the amount and timing of future
cash flows are estimated based on historical loss experience for assets with similar
credit risk characteristics. The carrying amount of the Company’s loans and
receivables at the end of each reporting period is disclosed in Note 6 to the financial
statements.

16. Fair value of financial instruments


Fair value of financial instruments by classes that are not carried at fair value and
whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value


The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and
other payables (including balances with intercompanies), are reasonably approximation of
fair values, due to their short-term to nature. 


The loan from holding company has no repayment terms and is repayable only when the
cash flows of the borrower permits. Accordingly, the fair value of the amount is not
determinable as the timing of the future cash flows cannot be estimated reliably.


17. Financial risk management policies and objectives


The Company is exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of
financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign
currency risk. The board of directors reviews and agrees policies and procedures for the
management of these risks. 


The following sections provide details regarding the Company’s exposure to the
above-mentioned financial risks and the objectives, policies and processes for the
management of these risks.


There has been no change to the Company’s exposure to these financial risks or the
manner in which it manages and measures the risks.


(a) Credit risk


Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments
should a counterparty default on its obligations. The Company’s exposure to credit
risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables.  For other financial assets
(mainly cash and cash equivalents), the Company minimise credit risk by dealing
exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.


The Company’s objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising
losses incurred due to increased credit risk exposure.  The Company trades only
with recognised and creditworthy third parties.  It is the Company’s policy that all
customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification
procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with
the result that the Company’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. 


Exposure to credit risk


At the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk
is represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in
the balance sheets.
CAESARSTONE SOUTH EAST ASIA PTE. LTD.     39


17. Financial risk management policies and objectives (continued)


(a) Credit risk (continued)


Credit risk concentration profile


The Company determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the country
profile of its trade receivables on an ongoing basis.  The credit risk concentration
profile of the Company’s trade receivables at the end of the reporting period is as
follows:


2013 2012

Japan 41 6 − −
Thailand − − 27 4


746 100 665 100


Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired


Trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are with
creditworthy debtors with good payment record with the Company. Cash and cash
equivalents, are placed with reputable financial institutions.


Financial assets that are either past due or impaired


Information regarding financial assets that are either past due or impaired is
disclosed in Note 6.


(b) Liquidity risk


Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial
obligations due to shortage of funds.  The Company’s exposure to liquidity risk
arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities.
The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and
flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities.
