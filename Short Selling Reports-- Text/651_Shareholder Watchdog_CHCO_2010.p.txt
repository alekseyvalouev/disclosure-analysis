Glorified Payday Lender City Holdings: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing

We take pride in our track record of identifying threats and business model risks that other
investors may be missing. A handful of stocks that we have analyzed on Seeking Alpha
have experienced significant declines (PCBC down 82%, HUSA down 36%, and JTX
down 70%). We have chosen our profiles carefully, focusing on companies that are
severely mispriced and possess risks that have gone unnoticed. We believe we have
identified another stock that is not what it seems.


City Holding Company (NASDAQ: CHCO) of West Virginia is a bank that is perhaps the
most egregious perpetrator of a nasty trick being played on US retail depositors. We do
not believe it is an exaggeration to describe CHCO as a glorified payday lender operating
under the umbrella of a bank charter. We believe the stock will face significant earnings
and multiple compression, and believe current investors face greater than 40% downside
from current levels. It is our hope that by highlighting our concerns, other investors can
make better informed decisions as it relates to an investment or short position in CHCO. 


Overdraft Background 
Bank overdraft and insufficient fund fees (which we will refer to as “overdraft”) penalize
customers for taking a greater amount of money out of their account than their account
balance. It is not uncommon for a single overdraft to have annual percentage rates [APR]
that exceeds 1,500%. Unsavory overdraft practices are currently in the cross hairs of
regulators and politicians. We expect a new Federal Reserve rule that becomes effective
in July to be the first step in reducing and eliminating these fees. Overdraft is practically a
100% margin revenue item for banks, and the banks that earn a disproportionate amount
of income from these fees are going to face significant headwinds.


It is our opinion that allowing customers to overdraft their account until their next paycheck
is deposited, and then charging them a very steep fee for this privilege, is no different than
controversial payday loans. While payday lenders have long been attacked for their APRs,
banks typically charge dramatically higher interest rates than payday lenders. Payday
lenders typically charge 300-350% APRs for a relatively high-risk loan. A bank that
charges a $32 fee to a customer that overdrafts his account by $100 for one week earns a
1664% APR for a very low-risk loan. If the $100 in overdraft was generated by more than
one transaction, the fees and implied interest rate multiply.

The policies of most banks are even more insidious than what we just described. Many
banks have set up their software so that if multiple checks, debit card, or ATM transactions
occur in a single day, the transactions are processed in the order of the highest dollar
amount to the lowest. Management teams have argued that they process the largest
transactions first because they assume these are the most important transactions for their
customers. This argument is completely specious because banks are not actually denying
any transactions. They are clearing all of the transactions so that they can charge multiple
overdraft fees to a single customer on a single day. The fact is that the order in which most
banks process transactions is in place for one purpose… to maximize fees charged to
their customers. 


City Holding Company (CHCO)
To determine which banks are most reliant on these fees, and who is the most aggressive
with overdraft, we screened deposit fees as a percentage of revenues and deposit fees as
a percentage of non-CD deposits (transaction accounts). Most banks do not disclose
specific overdraft fees, but it is reasonable to assume that in the era of “free checking,” the
majority of deposit fees represent overdraft charges.  
CHCO not only tops the lists of overdraft fee generators, but does so by a wide margin. By
our estimate, City Holdings generates 60% to 70% of earnings from overdraft (see table 2
below). Shockingly, CHCO is currently generating a 6% yield on its retail deposits and a
4% yield on its transaction accounts (see table below). Said another way, CHCO is
currently generating a higher yield on their deposits (a liability!) than their assets. We
researched 140 banks and discovered that the service fee to average transaction account
balance was less than 1%. We found two other banks that generated roughly 3% of fees,
while no other bank was over 2%. CHCO was a startling outlier and appears much more
reliant on deposit fees than any other bank in the country.

CHCO service fees $44,416 $45,995 $45,013


Average checking accounts 727,852 715,413 752,409

Given the huge amount of fees relative to other banks, we can only assume that CHCO is
using the most aggressive and potentially deceptive tactics in the industry to promote
overdraft. Our industry research suggests such unsavory practices could include: high per
incidence fees, an unlimited number of fees per day or month, ordering of transactions
from highest to lowest, and overstating account balances due to bounce or overdraft
“protection.” CHCO’s depositor base also plays a significant factor (a point that seems to
be front and center with new regulations). Banks located in lower income geographies
typically have a higher than average proportion of low balance checking accounts that
have a much higher propensity to overdraft.  


In the Crosshairs of Regulators and Legislatures
So why will these abuses change? First, starting on July 1,2010, a new Federal Reserve
regulation (known as Reg E) goes into effect that significantly alters overdraft fees. The
new rules require customers to positively opt-in to an overdraft program in order for banks
to charge them fees. We believe banks will have little success convincing the right
customers to opt-in. The type of bank customer that regularly racks up multiple overdraft
and insufficient funds fees is not the type of customer that religiously opens and balances
their bank statement. The prospect of these customers proactively reading and signing a
piece of paper “opting-in” before dutifully mailing the signed form back to the bank so that
they can continue to charge the high fees is very low.


The new Fed rules are likely to have a material effect on this high margin revenue item,
but we believe the new rules are just the tip of the iceberg. The sweeping financial
regulatory reform currently being debated in Congress could be signed into law within the
next month. Following the creation of a consumer finance protection agency [CFPA], we
believe the curbs in overdraft will become even more severe. Overdraft and order
checking is the type of behavior that the CFPA will likely target. Regulators and legislators
have aggressively targeted payday loans, and we believe overdraft fees are significantly
more usurious. While overdraft could be banned entirely, at the very least we believe
restrictions on the number of charges a customer can incur, a cap in per incident charges,
and a change in transaction process ordering policies are very likely. It is hard to imagine
this area of future policy receiving much opposition.

Some banks are proactively changing their overdraft policies. In March 2010, Bank of
America (NYSE:BAC) announced it was eliminating overdraft fees. On a conference call in
mid April, Bank of America implied that changes in their overdraft policy and Reg E will
cost the bank $3 billion in fees annually. JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) has also adjusted their
overdraft policies and expects to lose $500 million “after-tax” in fees. While these lost
revenue sums are massive, they do not represent material sums for each bank’s overall
income statement. The same cannot be said for CHCO. 


Impact on CHCO 
We believe CHCO’s overvalued stock could unravel for two reasons. These two risks,
lower earnings [E] and multiple contraction (P/E), could occur in tandem, which would lead
to a much lower “P”. First, we see significant earnings risk that investors have ignored, so
far. Analysts and investors appear to be assuming that future monthly maintenance fees
will offset the gaping hole that would be created from the reduced overdraft fees. We
believe this will be very difficult for CHCO to implement because overdraft fees are
primarily generated by a very small percentage of depositors (14% according the FED).
Complicating any plans for deposit fees is the fact that CHCO operates in a very
competitive environment for deposits. In West Virginia, BB&T (NYSE:BBT) has the highest
deposit share, while CHCO is a distant fifth. Competing banks, including JP Morgan and
BB&T, would aggressively market to CHCO’s disgruntled customers should they start
charging their “good” depositors to try and offset the loss of revenue from serial
overdrafters. If we are correct and new regulations change the rules on overdraft, the hit to
CHCO’s earnings could be dramatic.
Under the draconian scenario, we assume that overdraft is banned and CHCO’s earnings
from overdraft fall to zero. Under this scenario, CHCO’s earnings power falls below $1.00
per share, a level that may only support an $11 to $13 stock price. In the second scenario,
we assume CHCO is able to generate service fee revenues of 1% of transaction accounts.
This level is inline with the average bank today (although regulations should pressure this
level going forward) and assumes maintenance fees without deposit share loss (so a
conservative estimate). Under this scenario, earnings would have been 40% to 85% lower
the past three years (see Table 2). On a go forward basis, earnings power at the bank falls
below $1.50 per share.
Surprisingly, current analyst estimates expect earnings to accelerate in the second half of
2010 and continue higher in 2011. While deposit fees are not the only component of
earnings, they are certainly one of the most important drivers for CHCO. With upcoming

The second driver for the lower stock price will be multiple contraction. As investors begin
to understand the risk to CHCO’s primary income driver, the multiple on these
destabilizing earnings stream will also contract. CHCO trades at 200% of its tangible book
value of $16.11, which is one of the highest multiples of all US banks. A better comp group
for CHCO’s multiple would be the payday lenders, given their similarities. There is a
reason that payday lenders trade at 4-5x earnings. While payday is a highly profitable

business, it operates under the constant threat of regulatory and legislative changes that
could severely alter the profit model with little notice.
We know for a fact that Reg E will go into effect on July 1st for banks and can only
assume that Congress and the CFPA will follow-up with additional restrictions. It seems
logical that CHCO should trade at a multiple that better reflects the looming threat to its
profit model. However, investors appear to lack an understanding of the true drivers of
their profit model – a fact that we hope to clarify. Even if CHCO maintains its current
earnings multiple, at 12 times our scenario two earnings estimate of $1.50, the stock could
fall 45% from current levels. CHCO should be commended for maintaining solid capital
and credit through a difficult banking cycle. However, we believe it is a business model
that faces future impairment and uncertainty. As a result of future earnings revisions and
multiple contraction, we believe shares could face at least 45% downside from current
levels. And as we have seen in financial services stocks over the last two years, it is better
to be out early before earnings risks materialize and stocks face massive selling pressure.

Banks are like chicago politicas they are always looking for a way to stick it to the customer.They are run by the
goverment i guess obama is running the show just like his housing loans were.All you had to do was be late with one
payment and they were out to throw you out.And some made a payment and still was thrown out they are keeping the
lawyers in bussiness trying to show where thier clients made the payment.If we let these people in office today get
away with this thuggery our country is done

What I cannot understand is how a bank can allow you to access your money by atm, or any ach transation,that has
been direct deposited, but charge a fee for a check that goes through that very same day because the direct deposit
is there a day before the live check would have been cashed. They pay the check, but they charge an ISF fee. If I can
withdraw my cash that day, why can't a check be paid that day? What is the difference?

"SJ is 71 year old woman who lives alone and whose sole source of income is Social Security benefits of $565 a
month. She has a checking account with City National Bank. Her account has a bounce protection plan with
something called a sustained overdraft fee, in which the bank imposes a $5 per calendar day fee for every day an
account is in overdraft. SJ forgot to record a check in her check register. The next check she wrote was for $124, but
she had a balance of only $88.21. For an overdraft of $35.79, the bank charged a $30 NSF fee and, the next day,
started charging her $5 a day for each day the account remained in negative balance. SJ did not find out about the
overdraft until 11 days later when a letter arrived from the bank. SJ immediately deposited enough cash to cover the
overdraft and fees. For a $35.79 loan of less than 2 weeks, the bank assessed bounce protection charges for $75,
which was one-eight of SJ’s monthly income. SJ does not even recall receiving the notice that the bank allegedly sent
stating it would begin imposing a $5 per day overdraft fee"

Author’s reply »  Second, Tom Brown at bankstocks.com is a very vocal bull on bank stocks. Even he is “skeptical”
about banks ability to offset the reduction of overdraft fees. He stated that banks “aren’t sure how to respond to
changes to Regulation E” and “most banks will experience a meaningful revenue reduction as a result…They
expressed a surprisingly high (to me, anyway) level of confidence that they’ll be able to offset the negative impact with
still-undreamt-up changes and new products. I’m skeptical.”

Oh my….where does one start? Ok…first of all, be weary of tidbits such as, “It is not uncommon for a single overdraft
to have annual percentage rates [APR] that exceeds 1,500%.” You are annualizing a fee that is paid in less than 30
days (often less than 1 week). Also, I wouldn’t be quite so quick to decry these practices. Obviously you have never
spent time in LMI or inner-city markets where the problem many people have is cash flow. They are more than happy
to pay extra to have access to cash sooner – and it benefits them because it allows them to be timely in paying bills
such as rent and expenses such as groceries. In addition, since many of these people have variable income it’s not
as though they get stuck on a treadmill, sometimes they use it and sometimes they don’t. Indeed, talk to some –
payday loans are their lifeline, they welcome it, they appreciate it.


Next up is your comment, “Many banks have set up their software so that if multiple checks, debit card, or ATM
transactions occur in a single day, the transactions are processed in the order of the highest dollar amount to the
lowest.” This is a no-win scenario for banks because the payment order of items will always tick off at least 1/3 of the
customer base. In a high-low scenario, people get mad because more fees are assessed (although the recent
legislation and proactive changes by banks to their policies have significantly limited maximums). In a low-high
scenario, customers get angry because major items (rent, mortgage, car and insurance payment) may be
returned/declined in favor of the smaller transactions. In an ambiguous scenario you tick of elements of both.


In addition, you assert that, “We believe banks will have little success convincing the right customers to opt-in. The
type of bank customer that regularly racks up multiple overdraft and insufficient funds fees is not the type of customer

that religiously opens and balances their bank statement.” I’m not certain that this is a foregone conclusion. Chronic
overdrafters who opt-out (or become automatically opted-out after the August deadline because they did not make an
election) will miss what they had and may choose to opt-in. Besides, your statement is somewhat contradictory
because people who “religiously” open their statements and balances their checkbooks, whether opt-in or opt-out,
probably didn’t overdraft in the “old days” so their election is somewhat irrelevant.


Finally, you assert that overdraft fees are almost 100% margin and the practice is relatively low-risk. You are just flat-
out incorrect here. There is significant risk (albeit less than there was pre-regulation) as customers get too far
underwater and charge-off. While I won’t be silly enough to claim that the margin isn’t pretty high, it’s far, far short of
100%.


Now, you are correct that the new legislation will result in a severe hit to the bottom line of many financial institutions
that, historically, have relied heavily on this income. The ones you mention are just a tip of the iceberg. That said,
institutions that have not been as reliant or have been early-adopters in proactively weaning themselves off this
income stream will likely do well. The final result of all the legislation however will increase costs to banks which will
be passed on to the consumer in some combination of new/higher fees or increased spreads on both the deposit side
and the credit side. Banks that hold fast from a revenue perspective or even grow will be your long-term bulls. Likely
candidates are probably USB, BB&T, WFC, a few larger regionals and quite a few small regionals.

CHCO's investment securities portfolio also warrants concern. TRUPs and non agency MBS' constitute about 4% of
their total assets. The first quarter 10Q claimed that their TRUPs had a cost of $95M and unrealized losses of only
$2.8M - this seems like a really lowball estimate of the unrealized losses.

Author’s reply »  Greedcanbgood, thanks for your feedback. A couple of comments: 1) APRs are relevant because
they have been successfully used by consumer advocates, regulators and legislatures to drive awareness of abusive
practices. In addition, CHCO will most likely always have a balance of overdraft, so the APR should approximate the
yield on these “loans” 2) Order checking is irrelevant if a bank approves ALL transactions. In this case “high-low”
drives significantly higher fees with no benefit to the consumer. 3) CHCO does disclose losses on overdraft.
According to their 10-k, their net charge-offs for overdraft in 2009 were less than 3% of service revenues. Payday loss
rates are 5 to 10 times this amount. In Table 2, a 92% margin assumption is used for service fees. With only 3% going
to losses, that margin assumption seems very reasonable.

Author’s reply »  It recently came to our attention that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CHCO for their
“unfair” assessment of overdraft fees. The lawsuit highlights some of the aggressive practices that we profiled in this
article. We believe this adds additional near-term risk to CHCO’s stock price.
