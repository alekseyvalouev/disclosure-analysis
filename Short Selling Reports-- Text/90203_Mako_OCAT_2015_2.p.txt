Summary


Short Ideas Healthcare


Ocata continues its pattern of science by press release & destroying shareholder
value; recent SEC filing shows that massive dilution is imminent.


Past Ocata Therapeutics insiders have been accused of serious securities
violations and fraud. A recent FOIA request indicates the company is being
investigated by the SEC and/or law enforcement agencies.


A visit to Ocata’s office revealed an apparently empty office during business hours.
Many calls to the company went unanswered. Is anyone home?


OCAT issued meaningless press releases that successfully increased its market
cap by $60 million - the grants appear to be for a mere “up to $100,000” and “up to
$750,000”.


More Negative Catalysts for OCAT


I previously fully debunked all aspects of the Ocata story here. Additional negative
catalysts have since developed for the company, and I believe these developments
have been completely overlooked by the investment community.

More Dilutive Financings: "At-The-Market" Offering Coming to a Share Price Near
You!


First, a quick refresher on how much shareholder capital (NASDAQ:OCAT) has lost with
essentially nothing to show for it except substantial enrichment of insiders.

The insider compensation at OCAT is breathtaking:

Last month, OCAT detailed their plans to further dilute existing shareholders in a loan
agreement filed with the SEC.

In the loan document, OCAT disclosed that it will pursue a type of financing known as an
"at the market" offering, is primarily used by companies that can't or won't go through
the normal equity raising process of selling stock to qualified institutional investors.
Instead, an "at the market" offering entails selling stock directly into the market, which
typically hammers the stock price.


There have been several biotech companies that have completed "at the market" equity
offerings recently that illustrate the suffering investors endure after one of these
agreements is in place. I highly doubt many OCAT longs even bothered to read OCAT's
loan documents, so I will cover the details below.


From Wikipedia on at the market offerings:


"[B]ecause of the 'dribble out' nature of ATM offerings, they are a poor choice for a
company in dire need of financing or for a company without an actively traded ticker
symbol or imminent news releases."


Both of these are likely accurate - OCAT is perpetually in dire need of financings to fund
its seemingly endless cash burn, and in my view, OCAT is nothing more than a "stock"
with no underlying business of substance.


At the Market Offerings Punish Stock Prices - OCAT Longs, Prepare to be
"Dribbled" on…


Before reviewing OCAT's loan documents, let's review the charts of several other
biotechs that have pursued ATM offerings (similar to what OCAT is about to pursue):


Oncothyreon (ONTY) - shares hammered


On February 3, 2012, ONTY enters into an agreement for a $50 million "at the market"
equity offering. Just months later, ONTY's stock price declined 50% without warning and
investors who held on to their shares ultimately ended up losing over 75% of their
investment over the following 12 months.

Organovo (ONVO) - shares hammered


On December 30, 2014, ONVO entered into an "at-the-market" agreement. Over the
next few months, investors saw the value of their shares decline over 50%.


PharmaCyte (PMCB) - shares hammered


On May 28, 2014 PharmaCyte entered into an at the market equity offering agreement
of up to $50 million. Since announcing this agreement, the stock has declined over 70%.


All of these stocks shared other characteristics as well:


Large retail ownership1.


No smart institutional shareholders2.

History of large losses and consistent dilution3.


In other words, OCAT fits the profile to a T.


OCAT's At the Market Loan Agreement: The Devil is in the Details


The loan agreement can be found here. The relevant parts are summarized below:


Term B Loan Advance is for an additional $4 million but there are certain milestones
OCAT will need to meet in order to receive the money. Here is the relevant milestone:


"Receive unrestricted and unencumbered net cash proceeds of $50 million from the
issuance and sale by [OCAT] of its equity securities." These shares must be sold by
August 1, 2016. Additionally, in order to be eligible for the full amount of the loan, OCAT
must:


"On or prior to December 31, 2015 entered into an agreement with one or more
licensed broker-dealers providing for "at the market" purchases of the Borrower's
securities from time to time by such broker-dealers or their customers"


1.


"[Have] an effective registration statement on Form S-3 for the offering by the
Borrower, on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of its securities in connection with the ATM
Facility"


2.


"[Obtain] all consents and approvals of its stockholders, regulatory authorities
(including, without limitation, NASDAQ) and other third parties necessary for the
Borrower to offer and sell its securities pursuant to the ATM Facility"


3.


Per the loan documents, OCAT will have to achieve these milestones in order to receive
the Term B Loan Advance for $4 million. At current prices, the dilution would be
approximately 25% ($50 million on $200 million market cap). No wonder the company is
desperately issuing so many iffy press releases - clearly any professional investor who
simply skimmed the filings would avoid and / or short this stock based on of the supply /
demand dynamics alone.

An "at the money" financing arrangement would certainly put a lot of selling pressure on
OCAT's stock so it's not surprising that OCAT has issued a flurry of hollow press
releases in recent weeks. The logic behind this "science by press release" tactic is that
the higher OCAT can get its stock price, the less dilutive the financing agreement will be.
The table below illustrates this dynamic:


Source: Chart built by me using data from SEC filings


The key point is that OCAT would certainly want to limit dilution by having a higher price
for the ATM to "dribble on" - and one way to accomplish that is to get day traders excited
about press releases, even if the substance of those releases is questionable (see
below).


Let's take a look at the press releases issued by OCAT that were responsible for the
nearly 40% increase in the share price in just a few weeks. In my view, there is
absolutely nothing here that fundamentally changes the long term outlook or intrinsic
value of Ocata.

The NIH Grants Appear To Be For Small Dollar Amounts & Are Largely Irrelevant


For some reason, Ocata's recent PRs failed to mention how small these grants are.
Upon reviewing the NIH grant website, we can see that these grants appear to be for
very small dollar amounts and should not translate into any upward move in the stock
price:


Phase I awards are normally made for a six-month period for up to $100,000 total
cost.


1.


Phase II awards provide two years of support for up to $750,000 total costs for the
entire period.


2.


We know the first press release was for a Phase I grant, so this was up to $100,000.


The press release for the second grant doesn't disclose how much this was for or for
which phase, so let's give OCAT credit and assume it was for the larger $750,000
amount.


So the total may be $850,000. No wonder Ocata didn't disclose the amount, it's largely
irrelevant to the stock price. It's not 100% clear that $850,000 is the total amount, but it
seems obvious that if the number were meaningful, Ocata would have disclosed it. So
the market witnessed a $60 million market cap increase in large part based on $850,000
of grants, which is clearly irrational.

Not the first rodeo for OCAT


I don't think it's that hard to see why OCAT is frantically issuing these vague press
releases - it's clear that the dilutive financing is coming and without a large institutional
shareholder base the stock price will get decimated. Anyone buying at the current level
is likely to get hosed once the offering begins to "dribble out" all over the stock price.
Actually, if we look back to the last time OCAT entered into a similar financing
arrangement at the beginning of 2015, we can see just how devastating the losses were
for OCAT shareholders.


On June 27, 2014 OCAT entered into a highly dilutive financing agreement to sell up to
$30,000,000 of common stock. Below is a textbook example of how these events play
out.


Source: Capital IQ


It's clear from the chart above that OCAT isn't immune to the dilutive financing dynamics
caused by these agreements but I would caution OCAT longs to remember that the "at
the money" agreement that OCAT is currently pursuing is $50 million this time around,
much larger than the $30 million they did in 2014. Common sense and this historical
pattern suggest that the price action this time around will likely include much more
dramatic losses for OCAT investors regardless of near-term price noise.


FOIA Indicates Ocata is Being Investigated by the SEC & Potentially Law
Enforcement Agencies

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/9/40228756_14430197465610_rId39.png
Further complicating OCAT's attempt to raise capital is that the company appears to be
in hot water. A recently submitted FOIA indicates Ocata is the subject of an ongoing
SEC investigation. This is not surprising to me given the company's and insiders' long
history of securities violations and fraudulent allegations, which I detailed in a prior
report. A call to the SEC confirmed that very few public companies are the subject of
SEC investigations, and that the agency only withholds records when they contain
sensitive information about a company (known as a 7(A) Exemption - see below).


We don't know what the nature of the investigation is, but given Ocata's history, it could
be anything. Is the SEC investigating OCAT for the suspicious timing and dissemination
of several press releases within a few short weeks to increase the stock price? OCAT
has certainly been accused of similar activities in the past. Only time will tell, but for now
this will remain a significant overhang on the stock until all of this gets sorted out.

A Visit to Ocata's Office: No Answer at the Door during Business Hours, Calls Go
Unanswered


I have tried to get in touch with OCAT management many times and the company has
never answered the phone or returned my calls. For this reason, a visit by a colleague
was made to OCAT's corporate offices in Marlboro, MA. Shockingly, the office was
apparently empty during normal business hours on a week day as no one answered the
door and there was apparently no secretary present. The hallway looks cluttered and
inconsistent with a real office environment.


Given the ongoing SEC investigation per the FOIA and highly dilutive financing, I believe
current and prospective shareholders should be extremely cautious with OCAT stock.


Why Did No One Answer the Door at OCAT? Is this a real office? Where is
everyone?

It's not exactly clear what this last office space is being used for but it appears to be
vacant office space that is now being used for storage. Again, in my view, these images
are not consistent with what I typically see in $200 million companies that are
supposedly "leaders" in their industries.


How is it that OCAT insiders have made $55 million in compensation but
apparently can't afford a real office or anyone to answer the phone or the door?


More importantly, why would shareholders continue to fund this mess?


Conclusion


In addition to the unviable science, history of heavy dilution, and legacy of disastrous
shareholder returns, OCAT stock is set to continue its decline. There are multiple
serious overhangs on the shares. Despite the cash on the balance sheet, I am reducing
my price target for OCAT shares to zero as I believe OCAT will continue to burn cash
and enrich insiders, while continuing to substantially dilute the equity as OCAT. When
the biotech bubble ends, as it may be doing now, the shares have a high probability of
ending up worthless and/or declining another 99% through continued dilution.

Short the rips and definitely never, ever buy the dips in OCAT! If you want to buy a
biotech stock, I would recommend looking at real biotechs like BIIB, AMGN, IBB, etc. If
you are long OCAT shares the main thing you have to look forward to is another 25%
dilution in less than a year and a price that "dribbles" as the company sells shares into
the market.
