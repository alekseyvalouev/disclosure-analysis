China Sky’s Colorful Cast of Characters.


Posted on June 29, 2009 by Asensio.com


There is a colorful cast of characters behind the conversion of a


bunch of small, private, unknown Chinese companies into the


NASDAQ-listed company China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:


CSKI).


A report from asensio.com issued on June 17th described China


Sky’s investor relations representative Crocker Coulson and his


firm, CCG Investor Relations, frequent promoters of US-listed


Chinese penny stocks. We do not yet know whether Coulson and


CCG received stock as part of their compensation. It seems that CCG


did receive stock in at least one other Chinese reverse merger,


Zhongpin Inc. (NASDAQ: HOGS). Peter Siris, a vocal CSKI


shareholder, who runs Guerrilla Capital, is also a HOGS


shareholder.


Mr. Siris is fond of making promotional statements on China Sky’s


conference calls, always emphasizing the buzz words “stem cells.”


Guerrilla owned 130,000 CSKI shares as of April 2008 (see CSKI’s S-1


filing). While managing money, Siris also comments on stocks for


New York Daily News.


Siris and Coulson’s firms both appear in Zhongpin’s Form 424B3


filed June 16, 2009. CCG Investor Relations is listed owning 105,000


HOGS shares, and Guerrilla is listed with 200,109 shares, at the time


worth $1,114,050 and $2,123,156 respectively.


Another report issued by asensio.com discussed the firm that


arranged China Sky’s first PIPE offering, American Eastern, and its


principal, Trang Chong “Charles” Hung. As part of CSKI’s first PIPE,


American Eastern, Charles Hung and his son, Charles Hung, Jr.


together received more than 875,000 CSKI shares. Both American


Eastern and Charles Hung have been censured by FINRA. A


previous asensio.com report explores the possibility that Hung Sr. is

associated with Takasima, the Malaysian company that is one of


China Sky’s major distributors. Click here to see report.


Yan-Qing Liu, China Sky’s CEO is a reporter turned traditional


Chinese medicine superstar, having led CSKI while sales supposedly


increased 86% to 158% each year since 2005. Prior to joining China


Sky’s operating company, Liu served as a reporter for “Family


Health Newspaper.” He owns more than 4 million shares of CSKI


stock.


China Sky’s current CFO, Yu-Bo “Stanley” Hao’s credentials are not


standard for a CFO. Hao earned an MBA from the University of


Phoenix, a controversial online university, and worked in a non-


financial role in another industry – marketing for MGM Mirage, a


casino operator – prior to joining China Sky.


China Sky’s board also features a 26-year-old, Jiang Qi Feng, who


serves on the audit committee with two other directors. Jiang Qi


Feng is the “audit committee financial expert.” His previous work


experience was as a university teaching assistant in “biology


statistics, biology research and probability.”


Pope Asset Management is China Sky’s largest outside shareholder,


having more than 1.3 million shares. Pope is based in Memphis,


Tennessee, and invests in stocks such as Guangdong Nan Yue (Pink


Sheets: GUDNF $0.20) and Benda Pharmaceutical, Inc. (OTC: BPMA


$0.03). The founder of Pope Asset Management, Bill Wells, called the


firm Pope for the last name of one of his grandfathers. According to


the firm’s website, grandfather Pope had “a very successful career


on Wall Street” in the 1920’s until “his untimely death at the age of


32.”
