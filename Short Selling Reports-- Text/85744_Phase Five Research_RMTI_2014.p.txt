Rockwell Medical is awaiting a November 6th FDA Advisory Committee for its lead
candidate Triferic – an iron replacement therapy for CKD patients receiving dialysis.


The protocols of the Triferic clinical trials conducted by Rockwell, as well as the
results of those trials, lack any clinical meaning or relevance.


In the pivotal CRUISE studies, the effect of Triferic on hemoglobin levels wasn’t
clinically different from placebo, and the Triferic arm exhibited very high dropout
rates.


In the PRIME study, not only did Triferic treatment fail to lower ESA dose
requirement, but 24% of Triferic-treated patients required rescue i.v. iron
administration.

Given the above, we expect very harsh and critical briefing documents, followed by
a negative AdCom recommendation.


Introduction


Rockwell Medical (NASDAQ:RMTI) is currently awaiting an FDA Advisory Committee
hearing on its lead candidate Triferic (Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate, or SFP) intended
for delivering iron to patients who are receiving dialysis treatments via dialysate, rather
than intravenously or orally. Since presenting the results of several Triferic studies at the
2013 ASN Conference, Rockwell has been generating hype amongst investors, having
gained nearly 50% on its share price since the release.


On the surface, Triferic's FDA approval appears to be a walk in the park. The drug's
studies to date met all clinical endpoints with statistical significance, while demonstrating
a sound safety profile. In reality, however, Triferic results may be deluding investors.
Whilst the trial protocols devised by Rockwell may have yielded statistically strong
results, they have no clinical relevance. The scenario in which Triferic was shown to be
effective is neither realistic for a real-world clinical context nor did it adhere to any
procedures which are commonly used in dialysis clinically. In fact, the questionable trial
protocols set up by Rockwell have never been used before in studies involving any
equivalent-indication iron supplement which has reached the market. It is uncertain how
and indeed if the FDA was ever in agreement with the drug's study design.


In addition, the company's dubious and shareholder-unfriendly conduct casts a shadow
over the general credibility of information the company supplies to investors. The full
results of the two pivotal CRUISE studies have still never been made publicly available,
an open-label extension safety study completely lacks results, and the company's CEO
has consistently made claims of Triferic's superiority to existing treatments when in fact
Rockwell has provided almost zero proof to back such claims.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2612215-rockwells-triferic-has-zero-clinical-relevance-sell-ahead-of-the-upcoming-adcom?source=all_articles_title 3/15


We believe that, whether or not Triferic is an effective iron treatment, Rockwell has not
provided sufficient proof of its efficacy, safety, equivalence to current standard of care,
and most importantly - clinical relevance. We are confident that many of these issues
will be raised in the FDA briefing documents that will be released on November 4th in
advance of Triferic's November 6th FDA Advisory Committee hearing, and that the FDA
will be unable to approve the drug based on the current information Rockwell has
supplied.


Rockwell Medical and Triferic: Background


Rockwell Medical has been operating as a dialysis concentrate manufacturer and
supplier since 1996 and has recently joined the specialty pharma niche. The company's
first and only innovative candidate is Triferic, intended to be delivered to hemodialysis
patients via dialysate, replacing iron that is lost during a dialysis treatment. Triferic was
invented and patented by Dr. Ajay Gupta, and was subsequently licensed by Rockwell in
2002. Gupta is now Rockwell's Chief Scientific Officer and is in charge of developing
Triferic.


Triferic is a salt form of soluble iron which is strongly complexed by pyrophosphate and
theoretically does not cause toxicity during systemic administration due to the fact that it
lacks carbohydrate and is not treated as a foreign particle in the body. According to
RMTI, Triferic also never reaches the liver, binding to apotransferrin directly in the blood,
subsequently directly reaching the bone marrow.


Triferic is indicated for the treatment of iron loss or iron deficiency to maintain
hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent stage 5 chronic kidney
disease (CKD 5HD) and to reduce the prescribed dose of erythropoiesis stimulating
agents (ESAs) required to maintain desired hemoglobin levels.


Rockwell filed a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA on May 28 '14 and is
awaiting an FDA Advisory Committee hearing on November 6th. The AdCom's briefing
documents should become available on November 4th. Triferic's PDUFA is booked for
January 24th, 2015.


Chronic Kidney Disease Standard of Care

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2612215-rockwells-triferic-has-zero-clinical-relevance-sell-ahead-of-the-upcoming-adcom?source=all_articles_title 4/15


Over 2.5 million of CKD patients globally undergo regular kidney dialysis. These patients
often suffer from iron deficiency anemia caused by "leakage" of 5-7mg of iron during the
dialysis treatment and are commonly supplemented with iron to bring hemoglobin levels
to the standard recommended range of 10 - 11 g/dl (previously 10 - 12 g/dl). Such
supplementation requires co-administration of ESAs - kidney hormones which induce
the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. This co-administrative treatment has
limitations in that a compound called hepcidin traps the foreign iron in the liver,
eventually causing toxicity and the need for higher doses of ESAs, which are pricey.


Dialysis Procedures and Current Iron Treatments


Currently, iron is delivered to dialysis patients orally or, most commonly via injection or
infusion. The frequency of dosing will vary on individual blood parameters and is
commonly re-adjusted in response to amounts of markers, such as ferritin or
transferritin. A common clinical-setting dialysis ESA/iron adjustment procedure is
outlined here.


In theory, Triferic appears to be an ideal iron supplement for dialysis patients because
iron delivery via dialysis seems convenient, direct, real-time and supposedly cheaper
and safer than other forms of iron. Dialysate iron would eliminate the need for extra
intravenous/oral administration and potential unwanted GI and hepatic toxicity side
effects.


PART 1: TRIFERIC STUDIES PROVIDED CLINICALLY MEANINGLESS DATA


To date, Rockwell ran a Phase IIa and a IIb dose-escalating studies, two identical Phase
III efficacy studies called CRUISE-1 and CRUISE-2 and a Phase II PRIME study aimed
to demonstrate Triferic's effect on diminishing the necessary dose of ESAs in
maintaining hemoglobin levels. The company also ran a Phase III safety study on 718
HD-CKD patients for which Rockwell never released full results. None of the studies
paint a convincing picture about Triferic's efficacy or clinical relevance:


1. The Phase III CRUISE Studies were conducted according to a Clinically Irrelevant
Protocol


The two CRUISE studies are likely to form the focus of the FDA AdCom hearing. Their
protocol is outlined in table 1.

CRUISE-1 CRUISE-2


Description A randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III study to confirm the safety and efficacy of
TRIFERIC dialysate solution in maintaining iron delivery for erythropoiesis in anemic
adult patients with CKD receiving hemodialysis.


Initiation date March 2011 April 2011


Duration 48 weeks unless withdrawn/removed prematurely


No. of patients 305 294


Active drug arm TRIFERIC - 11 micrograms of iron / deciliter ((dl)) of dialysate 3-4 times a week


Placebo arm drug Zero-iron standard dialysate 3-4 times a week


Run-in period 1-4 weeks of no oral/IV iron, no changes in dose/route of ESA allowed


Primary endpoint Mean change from baseline in hemoglobin (Hgb)


Secondary
Endpoints

Removal Criteria Patients were removed from the study if: 1. There was a need to change ESA dose for
low or high (< 90 or > 120 g/l) hemoglobin values; 2. There was a rapidly rising
hemoglobin defined as > 115 g/L and an increase of 10 g/l over 4 weeks; or 3. serum
ferritin was < 100 µg/l


The CRUISE Protocol raises red flags which are not likely to slip past the FDA:

1. Placebo patients were given absolutely no iron for up to 48 weeks, and were removed
from the study as soon as their hemoglobin levels reached dangerously low levels.
Aside from the potential risks to the placebo patients, it is also extremely uncommon,
unnecessary and not clinically relevant, as no patient would be receiving zero iron in a
realistic clinical setting.


Such a study protocol, whereby placebo patients receive no iron at all, has never been
run by any of Rockwell's competitors (Amag, Sanofi, Vifor). All of the FDA-approved iron
supplements were tested alongside another form of iron supplementation (most
commonly oral iron). It is likely that Rockwell was well aware of this, but chose to utilize
a controversial study protocol because Triferic would not reach any endpoint with
statistical significance alongside another form of iron due to its weak effect (described
below).


2. In addition, despite lowered ESA/hemoglobin levels recommendations released by
the FDA in June of 2011, Rockwell did not make the recommended changes to the "high
hemoglobin" threshold value of 12g/dl which was part of the CRUISE protocol, and
which should have become 11g/dl. Throughout the 48-week study, many patients were
potentially put at risk by receiving ESA treatments when they reached what was now
considered dangerously high levels of hemoglobin. The failure to change the protocol in
line with FDA recommendations also renders the results of Triferic studies not relevant
to a modern clinical setting.


2. The CRUISE trials' results raise questions about Triferic's clinical relevance


The results from the CRUISE-1 and 2 studies were announced on July 11, 2013 and
Sept 4, 2013, respectively. The company presented the studies' results as positive,
stating that both studies "Met Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints…as a Treatment
for Iron Replacement in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients on Dialysis."


However, when going over the available data, clear and pressing issues emerge that
suggest lack of activity by Triferic:


Rockwell may have deliberately tried to conceal a weak clinical effect by converting
standard hemoglobin units


1. The effect of Triferic on Hemoglobin level is too small to have any clinical meaning

2. Surprisingly high dropout/withdrawal rate in the Triferic arm


Triferic showed no clinical effect beyond standard Hemoglobin cycling


Rockwell never made the full results of CRUISE 1 and 2 available to the public, instead
releasing excerpts of the findings in press announcements. The results of the two
CRUISE studies are shown in Table 2.


Despite the fact that every single trial protocol registered by Rockwell featured the
standard hemoglobin measurement units of g/dl, the CRUISE results were suddenly and
without warning released to the press in g/l units. The sole purpose of such a change
would be to deliberately make each result measurement appear 10-fold higher (a 0.6g/dl
measurement is equivalent to 6g/l).


The results in table 2 have been converted back to g/dl units (in parentheses) in order to
demonstrate the actual minimal changes achieved in the studies.

Total 89 (59%) 112 (73%) 87 (61%) 117 (81%)


What the results are showing is in fact that there is no clinically relevant
difference between placebo and Triferic readings (see figure 1 for graphic
illustration):


1. The mean difference in change from baseline between placebo and Triferic was
0.36g/dl out of a range of 3g/dl (the allowed hemoglobin range of 9-12 g/dl for patients
throughout the study).


2. Moreover, the end of treatment hemoglobin readings achieved in both the placebo
arm and drug arm fall perfectly within the normal hemoglobin range guidelines, with the
placebo reading well above the lower limit.


3. Another emphasis to the irrelevance of the 0.36g/dl difference between the placebo
and Triferic arms is provided by the fact that the laboratory variation of hemoglobin
measurement amounts to 0.5 g/dl within a given blood sample. This 0.5 gr/dl
measurement error finding is based on samples collected from over 65,000 dialysis
patients, which and also revealed that hemoglobin levels fluctuate by >1 g/dl within 6-
month periods (source). 90% of patients undergo such frequent hemoglobin fluctuations
when receiving ESA treatment.


Unfortunately, Rockwell never released full weekly data which could have demonstrated
a hemoglobin cycling pattern in the placebo group. Based on the fact that according to
end of treatment readings alone, study groups can't be clinically differentiated, the
results of the CRUISE trials lack clinical meaning.

High dropout/withdrawal rate in the Triferic group


Another major issue with the under-performance of the Triferic arm is related to
unimpressive discontinuation rate: the CRUISE trials were planned as withdrawal
studies, with a set of pre-specified removal criteria based on hemoglobin/iron levels (see
in table 1). Since only patients in the Triferic arm were receiving iron (placebo arm did
not receive any iron), it was expected that the dropout rate from the Triferic arm would
be minimal.


Surprisingly, that was not the case, as 59%-61% of patients in the Triferic arms were not
able to complete the study, in contrast with 73%-81% of placebo patients (CRIUSE 1
and 2, respectively; Table 2). Most commonly, the patients dropped out because they
needed ESA adjustments (due to unsafe hemoglobin levels), which were not permitted
per study protocol.

What the termination rates show is that in ~60% of patients receiving Triferic,
hemoglobin levels were not balanced and that patients required either lower or higher
ESA doses than they were receiving. In a conference call discussing the issue,
Rockwell's CSO, Ajay Gupta, has produced contradictory (see below) claims that this
was due to Triferic's strong efficacy in raising hemoglobin levels: "You would expect that
in the Triferic group, the patients' hemoglobin would rise. And once the hemoglobin rises
above 12 [g/dl], we cannot keep the patient in the study because the ESA dose is
clamped. And for safety reasons, the ESA has to be reduced, and therefore, these
patients are not dropped out. They are actually removed from the study because of high
hemoglobin so that the ESA dose can be titrated."


This claim was never supported by data published by the company. Importantly, this
claim seems to directly contradict the results of the PRIME study described below.


3. The PRIME study showed that Triferic requires higher ESA dosing


The PRIME study was a Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study
that enrolled 108 patients. A total of 103 patients received Triferic treatment or placebo
(Triferic = 51, placebo = 52). Treatment was dialysate containing Triferic, and placebo
was conventional dialysate without additional iron over a 36-week period. The patients
in the Triferic group received iron via dialysate during each of the 3-4 weekly dialysis
sessions, placebo patients received ESA treatment in order to stay within a 9.5-11.5 g/dl
hemoglobin range. Rescue IV iron was administered if a patient's ferritin levels fell to
<200 μg/L and/or TSAT fell to <15%.


The PRIME study was seemingly meant to be the most impressive Triferic study, and
showed that patients receiving placebo required 35-37% higher doses of ESAs than did
the Triferic arm. However, as in the CRUISE studies, the PRIME study's results yet
again demonstrated serious issues with the design and results.


The results of the PRIME study, which are presented in table 3 indicated that:


1. Triferic treatment did not result in lower necessary doses of ESA treatment, as
Rockwell's CSO suggested. In fact, it required an additional 1000 unit/week at end of
treatment compared to baseline dose.

2. The difference in end of treatment ESA doses between the study arms was driven
almost purely by the expected increased ESA requirement in the placebo arm (which
was deprived of any iron supplementation).


3. A substantial number of Triferic patients (24%) also required rescue IV iron
administration.

The results of the PRIME study demonstrated a clear lack of Triferic efficacy


The study protocol utilized in the PRIME study, while conforming to clinical
recommendations, did not follow a common clinical protocol and was not clinically
relevant. In essence, the protocol was tweaked to create an imbalance between iron
and ESA dosing, which ultimately led to a marked increase in ESA administration to
those patients whose iron levels were not maintained regularly.


In fact, if iron is properly maintained during dialysis, ESA dosing should also follow a
stable path. Patients receiving placebo in the study were administered iron only when
their ferritin levels fell to <200 μg/L and/or their TSAT fell to <15%. In the clinical setting,
such patients' ferritin levels should have been maintained at 500 - 1000 μg/L, and TSAT
values maintained at 22 - 50%.

If Triferic was an effective iron replacement treatment, the active-arm patients should not
have reached the low-end ferritin and TSAT readings, and in fact should not have
required higher dosing of ESA. Instead, 24% of patients who were regularly
administered Triferic eventually needed iron rescue. The whole Triferic patient arm also
needed increased dosing of ESA, which does not commonly happen in the clinical
setting when iron levels are sufficiently maintained. In fact, treatment guidelines suggest
that the initial ESA level should be gradually decreased to ~75% of the starting dose
over the maintenance period.


What the PRIME study actually demonstrated is that Triferic did not provide enough iron
to maintain a stable iron-ESA relationship, and that the company's claim (following the
CRUISE studies) that the use of Triferic leads to lowered ESA dosing is factually
incorrect.


All in all, it would appear that regular administration of Triferic via dialysate is
simply not a good enough iron replacement drug.


PART 2: ROCKWELL'S MANAGEMENT IS NOT ACTING IN SHAREHOLDERS'
INTERESTS


In our view, Rockwell's management has consistently exhibited shareholder-unfriendly
conduct. In addition to the fact that the timeline for Triferic's clinical development has
been consistently pushed back (it is now >1.5 years behind schedule), several lingering
issues with the company's management seriously undermine Rockwell's overall
credibility:


1. Rockwell Continues to Imply Unfounded Efficacy Superiority Claims


In a 2002 press release, Rockwell's CEO Robert Chioini released the following
statement: "ferric pyrophosphate administered via dialysate is a safer, more effective
and less costly method to deliver the needed iron to the dialysis patient." This was once
again reiterated in 2005, "Rockwell's iron-delivery product provides a safer, more
effective and less costly delivery of iron to the dialysis patient." The company continues
to attest that Triferic "significantly reduces ESA dose."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2612215-rockwells-triferic-has-zero-clinical-relevance-sell-ahead-of-the-upcoming-adcom?source=all_articles_title 13/15


To date, the company has done absolutely nothing to prove beyond sheer theoretical
speculation that Triferic is indeed a more effective or safer method of iron delivery to
dialysis patients than available treatments on the market. Despite this, the company
continues to release factually incorrect information to investors under the continued
pretense that Triferic has somehow demonstrated superiority to existing treatments.


2. Rockwell has consistently withheld detailed clinical data from investors


It is common practice, conducted by most reputable pharmaceutical companies, to
publish the full data set of their clinical studies in medical conferences or scientific
journals. For all but two dose-ranging studies, the detailed information for Triferic is
missing. The most detailed information the company has ever released was contained in
the posters, presentations and abstracts made available to attendees of the ASN
Conference in 2013.


Results of one study, TRIFERIC-6, which was a Phase III 718 CKD-HD-patient-
extension study of the CRUISE trials, were never made available even in top-line form.
The most information investors received on the study was a very general press release
containing a mere "We continue to be impressed with Triferic and its safety profile," by
Rockwell's CMO.


The lack of detailed trial information is not only suspicious but also constitutes poor
conduct towards investors.


Conclusion


All in all, we predict harsh and negative FDA briefing documents will be posted in light of
the following:


None of Triferic's major studies had a clinically realistic or relevant protocol:


1. The Phase III CRUISE studies were designed to "drain" placebo patients of iron


2. The PRIME study did not follow proper ESA dosing and did not utilize standard
clinical blood marker parameters


Triferic has not demonstrated any clinically meaningful efficacy:

1. Results of the CRUISE studies were nothing more than standard and expected
fluctuations in hemoglobin levels in response to ESA treatment


2. No clinically significant difference between the Triferic and placebo arms was
apparent in the CRUISE studies


3. The PRIME study has not demonstrated that Triferic lowers the required ESA dosing.
It only showed that dialysis-dependent CKD patients, put on an improper clinical
protocol (withheld iron replacement), required elevated ESA dosing.


Rockwell has other issues outside the direct scope of clinical trials which create
added risk and undermine the credibility of the company's management


We are confident that the FDA Advisory Committee will not vote in favor of Triferic's
approval, and that Triferic's chances of reaching the market without additional FDA-
requested studies are extremely low. Such additional studies would cause an 18-24
months setback for the company towards resubmission of the Triferic NDA. Given the
company's low revenues and very small profit margin, such a scenario should send
RMTI's stock price to the $3-4 range.
