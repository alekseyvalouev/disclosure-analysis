David Einhorn Speaks At Value Investing Congress 2012
[LIVE]


October 2, 2012 10:30 am  by VW Sta�


avid Einhorn, CEO of Greenlight Capital, is starting to speak now. Greenlight Capital is a value


oriented hedge fund, with a long bias. The fund has total assets under management of $9


billion. Einhorn is famous for his short picks. Even the mention of a negative aspect about a


stock could send it down double digits. At the Value Investing Conference last year, Einhorn discussed


his short thesis for Green Mountain Co�ee Roasters Inc.  (NASDAQ:GMCR). The stock is down


approximately 75% since the presentation.

Below are live notes:


(See our full coverage of the Value Investing Congress here).


10:24 EST:


Einhorn is only a few minutes away, and the crowd is really �lling out. The buzz so far for potential


short ideas revolves around: Lumber Liquidators, Herbalife, Dick’s Sporting Goods, or Martin


Marietta. At this point its all speculation


10:26 EST:


The media section, nearly vacant this morning, is now full of reporters with laptops up


10:33 EST:

https://www.valuewalk.com/2012/10/david-einhorn-speaks-at-value-investing-congress-2012-live/ 3/10


Einhorn takes the stage to a packed house. The presentation is “quite rigorous” and called “Kicking


the Tires”


4 ideas in 120 slides for today


Einhorn begins talking about an anonymous “In�uential Investor” from 1996 who purchased shares


in Cityscape stock and touted it at the Barron’s Roundtable. The stock tanked, and the investor


admitted the mistake. The lesson he preached to those who followed him into the name is: “do your


own homework”. Einhorn reiterates: never blindly follow an investor into a stock.


Now he is going through the market’s reaction to his GMCR pitch last year


Einhorn thinks the public debate is healthy, which is why he continues to pitch at these conference


Einhorn thinks a lot of people owned HLF stock into the earnings call because they believed


management sand bagged the earnings. Once he showed up on the call, a lot of investors were looking


to sell. He won’t be pitching HLF today.


He thinks its crazy analysts are forecasting what he will pitch and basing decisions o� that. He


compares these analysts to replacement refs


The �rst part of his slide deck is all about: don’t invest in the rumors or what I invest in without doing


your own work


Greenlight’s policy is to not comment on any rumors. The vast majority of the time the rumors are


completely wrong, but sometimes they are right


Doing his own homework, Einhorn does pay attention to what other investors do but would never


blindly follow anyone into an idea.


10:40 EST:


First Idea: GAAP-auchino II the sequel


Hitting GMCR again


GMCR said the audit committee reviewed Einhorn’s allegations and concluded no misconduct. But the


maximum time they could have possibly looked at the �nancials is 23 days. He thinks they just tried to


shove Greenlight’s critique away as fast as possible


Einhorn is going to update the thesis, �rst discussing Starbucks entering the segment. GMCR tries to


portray the Verismo as an espresso machine, not a co�ee machine.


Howard Schultz came out and explained that the Verismo is a co�ee machine, and they have a


partnership with GMCR “for the time being”. Einhorn thinks they will remain committed for at least


23 days, a little jab at the GMCR audit committee.

https://www.valuewalk.com/2012/10/david-einhorn-speaks-at-value-investing-congress-2012-live/ 4/10


GMCR has plans to reduce CapEx spending, but it remains aggressive  Normal capital spending in the


food industry is around 3.3% of sales. At over 9% GMCR’s capex spends is well ahead of just about


anyone. GMCR spends about $.15 per K cup produced in capex. Based on Greenlight’s market research,


he thinks lower cost competitors will give them problems going forward.


With no patents, and most key relationships through license  agreements   Einhorn thinks many


contracts will be renegotiated at terms less favorable to GMCR. He sees Kraft entering the market


through Maxwell House, and according to Greenlight research K-cup prices are already down 14%


from $.62 per cup to $.51 per cup. Considering the EBIT per cup is roughly $.08, he thinks this discount


is very material to margins.


10:52 EST:


Idea #2: long General Motors


Einhorn thinks GM is an “ugly duckling” at the moment for investors, but is a much healthier


company today after reducing work force and dealerships across the country. The bankruptcy cut out


over $83 billion in liabilities, including $25 billion of healthcare costs. The pension expenses remain at


$81 billion, but with current pension assets of $69 billion. Greenlight sees pension liabilities


continuing to shrink, and they don’ t view it ultimately as too much of a concern.


At ~$23 the brand is improving, and the company will not have to pay cash taxes for about a decade.


Considering all the cash on the balance sheet, they project enterprise value at just over $6 billion. The


product refresh cycle in 2013 and 2014 will drive growth, and GM is doing very well in China. Europe


remains a concern, but its a concern for everyone.


Greenlight estimates that the average vehicle is over 11 years old, because customers keep cars longer


during periods of recessions. They expect an upcoming vehicle turnover for customers who held on to


cars during the last few years, getting back to normalized demand of 16 million units per year. For GM


this mean a~$1.10 EPS tailwind.


Einhorn likes the recent releases from Cadillac, but thinks the 2013/2014 truck and SUV releases are


even more important. GM has the #1 position in China and the #3 position in Brazil. Investors are


pessimistic on the international operations currently due to struggles in Europe. He thinks investors


are projecting sluggish European growth out inde�nitely, which he views as inaccurate.


Einhorn thinks Obama will not sell the government owned shares below $53 (at a loss) before the


election, but Romney is in favor of immediately selling shares.


Based on the Greenlight model, Einhorn is projecting 2014 cash earnings of $8.00 and after tax EPS of


$6.00. This compares to consensus forecast of $5.00, and Greenlight views those earnings as mid-


cycle warranting a solid multiple.


11:04 EST:


Idea #3: long CIGNA (CI)
5/20/2018 David Einhorn Speaks At Value Investing Congress 2012 [LIVE]


https://www.valuewalk.com/2012/10/david-einhorn-speaks-at-value-investing-congress-2012-live/ 5/10


Its a boring homework exercise, but they love those situations. He thinks the added complexity


discourages investors, but with e�orts the HMO’s can be pulled apart and estimations can be made.


Healthcare is a growing part of the economy, but starting an HMO is very di�cult. The current HMO’s


have scale, and the regulatory hurdle add in another moat for this attractive business model. Cigna is


the best performer in the group.


HMOs re-price every year, so while they may have a bad quarter or year the business model makes


money over the long term. He views ObamaCare as just another homework problem, one Greenlight


doesn’t mind tackling and can be �gured out.


Einhorn likes the ASO business, which continues to grow for Cigna. He believes this capital light


business warrants a premium multiple in the markets. Most of Cigna’s covered lives are in large


enterprises or middle-market companies, not in the ultra-small businesses where its easier to steal


share. He thinks conservative 2015 EBITDA for the ASO segment is $200mm, and this business could


be divested.


Einhorn thinks CI overall is higher quality, earns a higher return on capital, and has growth potential


internationally that is trading for a discount compared to peers.


11:14 EST:


Idea #4: Short Chipotle (CMG)


Short pitch on a “nose bleed valuation”. CMG is generating a lot of  enthusiasm on Wall Street, but


restaurants are a competitive business and numerous emerging  competitors  will put pressure on


them. The summer drought  will put pressure on CMG, and ObamaCare will hurt CMG who does not


provide healthcare for the vast majority of its employees.


The biggest near term threat for CMG is….a resurgent Taco Bell. The market focuses on other high


multiple fast-casual as competitors, and relegates Taco Bell to QSR or Quick Service Restaurant. Based


on a Greenlight survey of 4,000 consumers, they found that the CMG consumer is also an avid Taco


Bell consumer. Taco Bell has the edge with more locatons, lower prices, and quicker service. Einhorn


views the Cantina Bell menu in 1,500 stores as a real threat to CMG. The menu is similar, but the


pricing is about 80% of the typical Chipotle o�ering.


Greenlight spoke with many Taco Bell franchisees and operators in researching the pitch. The see the


Cantina Bell menu as a big success so far, and think they are gaining many new customers directly


from CMG. The launch is going so well they are now planning to add new menu items. Einhorn thinks


that CMG is at serious risk of losing loyal customers to Taco Bell’s Cantina Bell menu. The ongoing


threat at lower price points inhibits CMG’s ability to raise price. With upcoming commodity cost


increases and added healthcare expense, this is a huge issue for CMG in the next year. In the past when


CMG falls short of expectation, the market crushes them. Einhorn reiterates that he loves eating at


Chipotle, but the stock’s expectations are too high and headwinds are approaching.


11:23 EST: Q&A
5/20/2018 David Einhorn Speaks At Value Investing Congress 2012 [LIVE]


https://www.valuewalk.com/2012/10/david-einhorn-speaks-at-value-investing-congress-2012-live/ 6/10


Greenlight is up in the “low-teens” so far this year after being up in the “low-single digits” last year


Do you think YUM is a long? Its interesting because of the resurgence of Taco Bell, but the KFC


business in China is slowing down and Pizza Hut has some issues. Overall Greenlight is on the


sidelines, but taking a look and its de�nitely and interesting investment.


Greenlight looks at the risk/reward of various investments, and right now they feel the pro�le for CMG


looks much better for the shares going down. He doesn’t have a multiple in mind for a fair value, just


like the risk/return pro�le on the short side.


Any thoughts on Moody’s after it has run up recently? Einhorn thinks they still face enormous


regulatory risk, and it has run up because it beats expectations. He thinks the really strong lawsuits


will take a while to get through, and the Abu Dhabi case in NYC is very important to keep an eye on. The


limit for fraud cases are 6 years, and those who lost money on the worst of the CDO’s now have a clear


roadmap on how to sue Moody’s and get to a trial. Its a long tailed thesis for them, it will take a while


to play out, but for a longer term investor the company faces tremendous liabilities without great


assets to satisfy them. If you are looking for a long for the next quarter, Moody’s could work for you.


For a long term investor he would avoid it.


His position and thesis on AAPL remain “largely unchanged”. Einhorn also mentioned that they do not


do pair trades at Greenlight, but being short a steel company (United Steel) while being long GM works


well for the fund.


Any thoughts on Care Fusion? Einhorn doesn’t have anything to add to it, but he has owned it in the


past


11:36 EST:


Einhorn still at the podium taking questions, cutting into the next presentation which was scheduled


to begin at 11:20am


Question about his short position in Japan? They were never short JGBs, instead took a currency


position. He think the trade continues to confound, but they are sticking with it.


Question on St. Joe: he highly recommends investors listen to the most recent earnings call.


Apparently the rest of the management team was too busy, so it was just the CFO. The only analyst


allowed to ask questions brought up many of Greenlight’s old concerns, to which the CFO avoided


answering many and instead said: “we are just going to focus on Florida”. Einhorn said nothing is


really going on with the business, they aren’t really generating revenue, and there is no plan in place.


All JOE is doing is cutting expenses all over the place to remain in business.


Asked about Dicks Sporting Goods from Ira Sohn for the last question. Einhorn said he has nothing to


add there and then walks o� the stage to a large applause.
