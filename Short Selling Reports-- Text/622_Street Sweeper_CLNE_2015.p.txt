Clean Energy Fuels: The Dirty Truth
May 5, 2015 2:42 PM ET47 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


CLNE’s expired tax credits and a one-time gain added artificial value to revenue and
EBITDA, according to analysis of recent earnings. The upcoming financial report will
likely disappoint, too.


Cheaper diesel makes natural gas less attractive, particularly to big fuel-guzzlers
such as long-haul trucks.


CLNE bets long-haul diesel trucks will switch to LNG. But planned LNG engines are
on hold, LNG plants have been shut down, and 5% NG adoption predictions now
appear overblown.


CLNE is over half-a-billion dollars in debt, even as it feels pressured to continue
building out fueling stations to honor commitments to customers.


That horrifying noise assaulting investors' ears is the sound of Clean Energy Fuels
(NASDAQ:CLNE) braking and swerving in the middle of the highway.


TheStreetSweeper is convinced it's time to get out of Clean's path while we still can.


Enamored with clean energy, investors found it easy to buy into Clean on fourth quarter
results showing a bump in revenue. At first we, too, were almost charmed by the provider
of natural gas - compressed (CNG), renewable natural gas (RNG) and liquefied (LNG) -
for long-haul trucks, buses, taxis, etc.


But when we broke out our toolbox, we discovered a wreck that will remain too banged up
to make the long haul. Company executives have not gotten back to TheStreetSweeper
for an interview.


But investors may find various viewpoints here, as we highlight the top risks poised to run
down Clean Energy shareholders.


1. Look under the hood: financials

First, the bump in revenue to $132 million wasn't really the outperformance many thought.
Check page 16 of its federal filing and note where $28.4 million of revenue came from:
"federal fuel tax credits" which "expired on December 31, 2014." Plus, another $12 million
came from another one-time gain - the sale of Clean's interest in a Dallas biomethane
plant.


Second, gross profit per gallon declined to $0.26. That's 2 cents less than the quarter
before and 5 cents less than the prior year.


Gross profit was expected to be $0.29, according to Piper Jaffray's Alexander Potter and
Winnie Dong - who called a $3.25 price target on Sunday, March 1, 2015. Clean had just
closed at $6.01.


"We are growing increasingly skeptical that this key metric can/will eventually rise,"
analysts wrote of the gross profit.


Third, Clean's adjusted EBITDA was not positive. It was actually negative at -$3.2 million.


Clean actually had a loss of $0.01, while firms like Raymond James were looking for
positive earnings of $0.05.


Today, UPS announced it signed a deal to buy RNG from Clean from three stations,
servicing 400 trucks at about 1.5 million gallons. RNG uses landfill gas, something big
truck operator Waste Management has done since 2011.


"UPS is already a Clean customer and this announcement is not strategic stuff for Clean,"
a long-time analyst told TheStreetSweeper.


He estimated the deal will mean only about $1.5 million a year to Clean.


The bull case accounts for a relatively strong balance sheet and that Clean should be able
to reach positive cash flow.


But we strongly believe Clean's financials should have sent investors racing …. For the
exits.


2. LNG bet goes up in smoke. Clean Energy has placed a bet that long-haul trucking
would easily switch from diesel to liquefied natural gas. But that has not happened.


Truckers are particularly hard pressed to justify paying an additional ~$8,000 per vehicle
for modified tanks and engines.

And Volvo Trucks and Cummins Westport have recently put their LNG engine plans on
hold.


But the troubles with the liquefied natural gas plan become even more evident when we
look at companies working alongside Clean. For example, Chart Industries
(NASDAQ:GTLS), the liquefied natural gas or LNG storage tank maker for big trucks just
turned in its first quarter financials, highlighted by missing estimates and falling net
income.


According to Chart executives, liquefied natural gas prospects are declining:


"We do face deteriorating near-term business prospects in the D&S LNG business for
applications based on diesel fuel replacement …"


The LNG storage tank maker has shut down its liquefied natural gas equipment plant:


"We also announced the shutdown of our D&S LNG equipment manufacturing facility
in Owatonna, Minnesota ..."


More on declining demand:


"Orders were down primarily due to lower LNG equipment demand for diesel
replacement applications in light of the narrow spread between natural gas and diesel."


Bluntly, prospects for diesel fuel replacement remain at death's doorway:


"And also, the near term, and I'll say through 2015, prospects for equipment to the
heavy-duty diesel fuel replacement market, particularly for oil and gas production looked
moribund."


Here is Chart Industries' stock chart:

Clean Energy also works hand-in-glove with Westport (NASDAQ:WPRT). Clean Energy
builds and operates a network of liquefied natural gas filling stations. Those stations have
to have something to fill up; they service big LNG-powered trucks that run on engines sold
by Westport. So Westport's stock chart also gives us a view of the state of the business.


(Source: Yahoo Finance)


But still more depressing news for Clean Energy hits both its CNG and LNG business.
Truck drivers and fleets aren't turning to tractors fueled by natural gas at anything near the
extent projected just two years ago.

"Fleets Braking Hard When it Comes to Natural Gas Truck Buys," is the succinct headline
in Trucking News online.


While Clean has had some wins, the future doesn't look too inviting. Experts say a 5
percent penetration of natural gas heavy-duty trucks anticipated in 2015 is too optimistic.


The publication referred to a trade news report that "attributes the rapidly declining cost of
diesel with making the return on investment for the adoption of natural gas less lucrative -
and less attractive to trucking industry players."


Here's the 1-year price chart for diesel:


(Source: Mundi Index)


Here's the 1-year price chart for natural gas:


(Source: Mundi Index)


Diesel is down around $1.90; at about $2.80, so is the appeal of natural gas.


3. Pricey bet, killer consequences. It took a mountain of debt to finance Clean Energy's
LNG bet, driving Clean's total debt to over half a billion dollars. This will crush investors.

The company has racked up $570 million in debt and has many of its assets tied up in
LNG. In fact, Clean is facing up to $200 million in debt just for two new LNG plants. And
it's burning through an average of $40 million per quarter.


But Clean has only $215 million in cash and short-term investments.


So Clean appears to be on the verge of crushing investors. The company will likely need a
capital raise that would dilute current investors' shares. Either that or sell assets, stop all
expansion plus cut expenses even more.


Noting that Clean has a $145 million convertible note to repay in August 2016, plus
another $300 million convertible debt in 2018, Piper Jaffray analysts wrote that their model
suggests Clean "will not have enough cash to pay off its convertible debt in 2016."


4. Brake, swerve, overcorrect: Watch the competition. Clean Energy is trying to make
up for LNG's disappointment by becoming a generic natural gas distributor/reseller.
Margins are already low for Clean Energy, bumped up last quarter by strict expense-
cutting, but this lower margin segment is inhabited by fierce competitors unburdened by
the kind of debt Clean Energy is hauling around. But even they seem to be having second
thoughts about natural gas at this time.


Piper Jaffray analysts wrote that, though gas volume is growing well at 20-30 percent, it
won't do Clean Energy any good without higher margins.


See the chart below to find actual margins and Piper Jaffray's estimated margins for 2015
and 2016.


(Sources: YCharts; Piper Jaffray)


Meanwhile, Clean Energy competitors have been busy but low oil prices have slowed
efforts to build natural gas filling stations.


Shell, which had planned to build 200 LNG pumps on 100 stations across the nation,
announced in March that it had opened two LNG lanes for trucks in Baytown, Texas and in
Lafayette, La.

But Shell told Reuters that only 15 to 20 percent of LNG projects already approved by the
Canadian government will materialize by 2025.


Also, Amp Trillium announced plans in 2012 to build a network of CNG filling stations
across the nation. It took about two years before Amp Trillium opened the first of five CNG
stations for Frito-Lay trucks.


Finally, Chinese-backed Blu LNG had planned a network of natural gas fueling stations for
trucks along US highways. But now, Blu LNG has canned execs and slowed down the
entire plan.


At the same time, Clean Energy must remember that installing LNG fueling stations can
reach $4 million. CNG ranges from $10,000 to $1.8 million.


All considered, Clean Energy's ~$200-million-worth of LNG plants is looking more and
more expensive as the company feels it must continue building to honor commitments to
their big fleet customers.


5. Top five remaining officers receive over $8 million compensation …


For their part in running a business at a $90 million loss last year alone, total
compensation of the remaining top five executives, excluding that of the suddenly
departed CFO reached $8.1 million:

Comments (47)


Even normally optimistic analysts are expecting Clean Energy to continue running over
investors and their hard-earned money:


(Source: Yahoo Finance)


Sadly, even in the best of times, when the price of diesel was significantly higher than
natural gas from January to August 2009, Clean recorded a net loss approaching ~$31
million. Likewise, when diesel was up compared with natural gas from October 2011 to
March 2012, Clean recorded a net loss here and here of ~$53 million.


But these are not the best of times for Clean Energy. And we believe oil prices, disinterest
in LNG, the company's financials, gross margins and massive debt spiral have turned
Clean Energy Fuels into a wreck. TheStreetSweeper believes investors should brace for
impact - shares could drop to somewhere in the $3 - $4 range.

Interesting... When UPS signs with CLNE to gas its truck fleet, and Ford announces a new F150 that runs on LNG,
someone who's short on the stock writes a negative article full of "facts?"! Boone T Pickens has invested a whole lot
of money in CLNE and I'll continue to believe Mr. Pickens knows what he's doing. So... you go right ahead and add to
short position, I wish you lots of luck!

I think you mean "CNG" for the Ford F150. Compressed gas is much cheaper and easier to use and store
than "LNG." LNG users have to drive alot and soon after fueling up because the LNG warms up and
evaporates.

Listener2307
mmkkgg illustrates a good point: 
Most investors in CLNE simply do not understand enough about the natural-gas-for-fuel concept. Reading
through the comments, it sounds almost like a religion where facts are discounted and "non-Bleevers" are
excoriated.

There is a lag time between contract execution and sales showing on the balance. This is primarily due to the timing
of truck delivery. All of CLNE's contracts from last year and 2013 are starting to materialize as fleets take ownership of
trucks with 12L WPRT engines. Sales going forward are going to continue to expand. Even if sales aren't 5% of the
trucking business, 1-3% would be adequate for substantial financial improvement. Chicago O'hare airport is going to
convert operations (CLNE), DART bus fleet 100% (CLNE), etc., etc.


Plus, demand for oil will quickly outstrip supply as production decreases and demand grows. Oil and diesel will be
higher next year.


05 May 2015, 03:33 PM


mikey2006
The house and senate are both considering new bills to equalize the tax on LNG so that is on equal footing with
diesel.

I guess the strategy of this article is to throw anything and everything at the wall to see if anything sticks. I wouldn't
say this article is completely wrong, but it's wrong about a whole lot of things. Just to name a few:


* The tax credits and gain on the sale of assets were clearly disclosed in the last quarterly report. Any investor could
plainly see this information and take it into account in analyzing CLNE's performance.


* CLNE's gallons delivered have been increasing at about a 20% rate. While it's true that LNG adoption for long haul
trucking has not occurred as fast as originally expected, it is continuing to occur. Meanwhile, other aspects of CLNE's
business, most notably CNG, RNG and LNG to fixed locations are continuing to grow at strong rates.


* Stating that CLNE won't be able to pay off their convertible debt next year is the equivalent of saying I'm not going to
be able to pay off my mortgage next year: yeah, so what? CLNE is on track to be adjusted EBITDA positive this year,
which means that one of two things will happen next year: either the convertible debt will be converted to shares --
resulting in all shareholders owning somewhat diluted shares in a suddenly profitable company -- or the convertible
debt will be refinanced -- resulting in lower interest rates and being that much closer to positive cash flow.


* Senior employees are well compensated, but contrary to the hyperbolic rhetoric of this article, they were
compensated at far lower rates in 2014 than they had been at 2012 -- just look at the charts in the article!


I could go on, but hopefully the readers will get the point. As the author's disclosure states, they're short CLNE, so my
sympathies are certainly with them. Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for me, I expect CLNE will be approaching
$15 per share by year end.

..."Meanwhile, other aspects of CLNE's business, most notably CNG, RNG and LNG to fixed locations are

Well, not really. RNG and LNG are going exactly nowhere.


RNG sales for the past 4 quarters: 
3.2M.....2.9M..... 3M.....3.1M


LNG sales for the last 4 quarters: 
16.7M; 18.3M; 18M; 17.3M


And as the article points out, switching UPS from being a CNG customer to an RNG customer results in very
little. Same station, same trucks; different pump, higher price.

Natural Gas and renewable NG {Redeem} is the only , let me repeat. ONLY, fossil fuel that can seriously be
considered a bridge fuel to the future for less use of oil and coal...and America being the largest producer, imo,... puts
it in the driver's seat for fantastic gains in the not too distant future...and CLNE is right there, ready to go!

I agree on most written here 
But I do not understand the margin call 
I guess their new business is less of a % than I think 
Their gross margin on bulk got to be a lot less than others 
Maybe its high because or near because its a long distance

Almost all paper mills get delivery by train 
So if its long term ,not piped ,they will put in delivery by train

I noted this article headline immediately as the stock is playing at the highest level in a long time...


Like a skunk in a rose bush I smell a short squeeze in play.


A few reasons why the "go long" types may have a different opinion that the Streetsweeper:


o the price of diesel came down and so did the price of NG. Net profit is down everywhere in the energy sector


o CLNE pumps more fuel everyday, CNG, LNG, whatever. More fuel everyday


o Westport's HDMI 2.0 is misunderstood. Even less understood is the effect it had on sales last fall. Sort of like coitus
interruptus.


o CLNE is far ahead of the competition, facilitates its own purpose with technology assistance to users


o WPRT rose 10% and just less than that yesterday. I believe it's a longer play as there are big players in North
America, Asia and India but the technology is solid.


o diesel prices are not determined by costs in the US. They are a global play and a global demand. Truckers are
conservative by nature in a low tech slim margin business that's slow to change. But low margin is due to
competitiveness, they will succumb as the technology has improved.


o NG in the US is a 1% use in transportation, the lowest in the world. While the US has a big portion of the world's
NG. Truckers


o there's a lot of politics in oil. As there is in natural gas. Tax credit expiries are not the end of the world.

Tee Hee, I love these doom and gloom articles. The shorts got 'em down by their ankles the last couple weeks, don't
they?

I usually judge the character of the author by if he/she responds to comments. There are some wonderful authors who
will enter into discussions with those who read their work and comment.


I wonder if The Street Sweeper will chime in?

Wait till you see how NG Advantage takes off in the Northeast by end of year. The deal with IP may be only the
beginning.

Street Sweeper is dead on. 
CLNE's mission was to convert the enormous diesel over-the-road fleet to LNG, and they built America's Natural Gas
Highway to accomplish it.


Now, the manufacturers of the engines and the tanks have either given up or fallen on hard times because the
trucking industry never bought the concept. I expect that one day in the future we will see the wrecking ball arrive on
site to remove what today the balance sheet lists as an "asset".

There is a huge short float on this stock-you can almost smell the he short squeeze that will hit this stock -maybe after
earnings release on May 11th?


06 May 2015, 08:54 AM


Listener2307
Looks like the short squeeze already hit the stock.


But does that mean the stock price will continue an upward trend? Perhaps not. Some times the short
squeeze is just sort of a spontaneous combustion - happens by itself and means very little. 
Then the downward trend continues.

Haven't seen one of these articles in a while. Share price must be getting too high.

Once again, the short sellers attack Clean Energy through Seeking Alpha (where I always see short sellers publish -
why is that?).


Possibly StreetSweepers is in need of covering their short position and is "re-interpreting" the facts so that they can
close their short?


Did anybody really invest in Clean Energy with an expectation of a short term major profit? They are doing their thing
and like all companies, there are bumps in the road. Doesn't seem that Clean Energy has been damaged by the down
turn in the price of energy, in fact it seems that they absorbed it, accommodated it in their business strategy and
continue to move forward.

Publication of this article seems to indicate that there are still many millions of shares that need to be covered. Expect
further volatility as they try to drive the stock down only to cover many of thousands of shares at a lower price and
drive the stock back up.

So as of this morning, the stock is down ~30% from its high @ $11.79. Earnings release is Monday. Are you
saying that this drop in the price over the last 5 days is due to short sellers covering what will possibly be a
successful quarter?  
I was in around $4.30, buying more until i got out around $7.30. I was kicking myself 2 weeks ago when it
quickly shot up to $11.79, but now the price seems more reasonable. 
If the earnings go well, is this a situation where there will be another pop?

You think Boone know what he's doing but you wrong. If he did, he would of fired his long time CEO but no instead he
fired CFO because he butt hurt about his margins call then rehired a fired VP of Finance to be current CFO. Do
yourself a favor and thank the author for saving you money on Long where you should of been in short like me.
Money can be made on both side so don't bash and hate. Go back to basic fundamentals and that should prove you
that CLNE is a short stock for now.

how manuclne positivre investor posted any facts? 
How many talked about margins 
how many showed how or when it will be profitable by showing the projections for this? 
none  
What does that tell you?

Whatever. All I know is that I just finished a drive from Williams, AZ to Chicago, along the Natural Gas Highway. I
stopped in at Pilot and Flying J for fuel. EVERY CLNE terminal I saw had a truck filling and at least one more waiting.
Last year terminals I observed had concrete barriers blocking access, and I observed no trucks using the terminals.
Try Google Earth to see for yourself.

Listener2307
Very nice.


But the question I have is, "Why have LNG sales stood still for the past 5 quarters? And they have stood still.
Here are the figures: 
16M; 16.7M; 18.3M; 18M: 17.3M


Last year CLNE sold 265M gallons of all products. 70.3M was LNG. 
As the article points out, the largest part of their investment was in LNG. They are positioned to manufacturer,
transport and sell.


And there is this: 
The locator at Alternative Fuels Data Center shows 4 - FOUR - Lng stations open between Williams, AZ and
Chicago, and NONE between Oklahoma City and Chicago which is 795 miles. So our well intended erstwhile
trucker would have run out of fuel, and would have been working at the Arby's at the Flying J/Pilot.

Westport beat...a rising tide perhaps. Should give CLNE a bump.

Volumes are continuing to grow and a Westport beat is very bullish. All info needs verification but stations are
being opened and that requires demand! A short squeeze is sweet.

wow what passion I love it. I am still long just 100 shares I had 1250 shares until this huge run got me all my money
back and nice profits. I feel like a sucker when I buy this stock and it tanks because of a macro sector collapse and oil
declining so much to make alternative fuels less necessary. I stuck with the company because I believe in cheap
clean natural gas and diesels demise. We need a better balance sheet so that is what we need to follow to determine
weather to stay in the stock.

I really like the NG Advantage deal to supply International Paper’s with 32,000 DGE per day equivalent to 11.7 million
gallon per year for one factory. Hopefully deals like this along with NG in the refuse market will sustain CLNE until NG
for long haul gain traction. If recent collaboration between industry players such as CLNE and Agility, Agility and
Cummins, and Agility opening a new production facility are indicators, I believe incremental cost for NG vehicles will
come down. The NG vs Diesel price widening, and LNG tax equalization will further accelerate the transition to NG.
Long CLNE.

Well put! The real advantage of NG Advantage will emerge as it blossoms in New England. It is a region
crying for any chance to lower energy costs. A positive report today could easily set the stage for test of 12.

To buy into a stock is investing, to short a stock praying on ones misfortune and inflated analysts is a ((vulture)), but
prefers to call them self an investor. Like a wolve dressed as a sheep

buffalo its a lot of shenaniganans going on but I assume some shorts are honest hard workers but I personally never
have and never will short a stock. Earnings out not very good missed by six cents. glad I am only long a houses
money 100 shares as I have made a few thousand on stock. Who likes this my fellow Americans

InvestRite#1
Sonya, I'd suggest you re-listen to the conference call on 1st qtr earnings. There's quite a lot of positive future
earnings coming into the 2nd, 3rd and 4th qtr results. Prick up your ears after the first 2 or 3 minutes. This company
will make below average revenue a thing of the past very soon. I agree their debt appears high, but in the industry it is
not. CNG and LNG as well as their waste fuel is a building momentum that is catching fire. Seriously considering
taking a decent position prior to the next earnings call.


12 May 2015, 11:26 AM

Q1 was another solid quarter that built out on a very solid business plan that is now working well. The future is very
bright!

balance sheet much improved since this article was published. Fuel sales are up nicely I say BUY BUY BUY
