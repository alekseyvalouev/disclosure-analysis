NQ Mobile: China Fraud 2.0 
 
NQ is a massive fraud.  We believe it is a “Zero”.  At least 72% of NQ’s purported China 
security revenue is fictitious.  NQ’s largest customer by far is really NQ.  Its real business with 
carriers and SPs is a fraction of what NQ purports.  NQ’s online payment portal does not work – 
it is cosmetic only, designed to make investors think that NQ is a real company.  NQ’s prepaid 
card channel is a bad joke.  We estimate that NQ’s real market share in China is about 1.5%, 
versus the approximately 55% it purports.  We estimate that NQ’s paying China user base is less 
than 250,000, versus the approximately six million it purports.  This fraud and the undisclosed 
related party transactions amount to securities fraud.  We have already provided the SEC with 
information concerning NQ. 
 
NQ’s Antivirus 7.0 is unsafe for sale to consumers, and we consider it to be spyware.  We 
engaged a group of top-tier specialized software engineers to dive deeply into the application’s 
code.  The engineers found that the application creates serious vulnerabilities, making users’ 
phones prone to data compromise and cyber attack by hackers or the Chinese government.  In 
other words, users phones are much more susceptible to compromise or attack with AV 7.0 than 
with nothing at all.  NQ’s applications send far more data than necessary to its server in China.  
This data includes information on all URLs a user visits and location information (among other 
sensitive items).  The uploaded data is not sent securely (let alone in accordance with industry 
standards), despite passing through the Chinese government’s firewall, which is believed to view 
and store all passing data.  NQ sends this data to a third party analytics firm in China.  
Downloads are even less secure.  The application does not require signature, making the phone 
highly vulnerable to third parties uploading malware.  Our engineers successfully staged such an 
attack.  After their analysis, the engineers speculated that these vulnerabilities could be deliberate 
because the techniques vary so widely from industry standards. 
 
NQ’s purported international revenue is even more questionable than its PRC revenue.  A 
leading Android analytics provider estimates that NQ’s global annual app revenue is well under 
$1.0 million.  NQ generates de minimis revenue in the United States.  The agreements NQ has 
announced with various US partners seem to have resulted in attachment rates of only 2% to 3%.  
NQ’s purported days sales outstanding (“DSO”) from are 198 days– much of which supposedly 
comes international revenue.  Even in the most emerging of markets, NQ should be getting paid 
in 30 to 45 days.  NQ’s involvement with Telefónica is massively exaggerated.  It is one of 3,000 
developers on Telefonica’s Blue Via platform.  No developer has ever been expelled from the 
platform. 
 
NQ’s future is as bleak as its past.  Its expansion into gaming and advertising is merely an 
attempt to prolong the fraud.  NQ’s lies about its security app market share have worn very thin, 
and the Company is trying to hide the ball by switching emphases.  Co-CEO Omar Khan offers 
the clearest explanation of why NQ’s expansion will fail.  If NQ were really a “platform” that 
had the lowest user acquisition costs in the world, as Mr. Khan claims, then there could be a 
strategic basis for the expansion.  In reality, NQ’s acquisition costs are closer to being the highest 
in the world, and it should not be called a “platform” with a straight face.  This is merely a way 
to claim to be in a business in which NQ hopes its fraud will be less obvious. 
 


Page 3 of 81
With one exception, NQ’s real management (i.e., those perpetrating the fraud) are sloppy – to the 
point of being comical – fraudsters.  They broke – with flying colors – the cardinal China fraud 
rule of not getting into trouble in China.  NQ was caught red handed by China’s largest television 
news organization, CCTV, installing malware on phones in order to sell them the cure.  In 
addition to that incident, and the subsequent lies NQ tells about it, are illustrative of the type of 
people behind NQ.  In addition to being greedy and willing to engage in illegal behavior, they 
are clearly undisciplined.  That lack of discipline and desperation for real revenue leads them to 
do bizarre things, such as developing a knockoff Segway (we call it the “Family Guardian 
Emergency Response Vehicle”); selling anonymous phone cards in China to phone spammers 
(again, making the cure and the disease); trying to sell a “NQ for Men” app that enables 
philandering; engaging in black hat SEO by likely infringing trademarks of companies such as 
Samsung, Vodafone, and Apple; fabricating virus discovery announcements; and, claiming to 
have paid an outrageous amount ($1.55 million) for its domain.  
 
The one intelligent move NQ made to further its fraud is putting in place the veneer of US 
management – particularly “Co-CEO” Omar Khan.  Were Mr. Khan not fronting for NQ, we do 
not think that investors would have been so willing to overlook so many red flags.  It is unclear 
what Mr. Khan does and does not know; however, he is not a member of the boards or 
management of any of NQ’s China entities.  It is clear that his stock package is worth close to 
$100 million, which is likely far more than he would have earned as a non-C level manager at 
Citigroup.   
 
NQ’s auditor has clearly done a sloppy job.  The auditor failed to ensure that disclosures about 
cash balances by entity are correct.  It classified all cash as a Level 2 asset, which we have never 
seen before.  The auditor failed to ensure that share-based compensation is recorded at the 
correct entity.  It permitted NQ to reclassify significant costs from Cost of Sales to R&D, 
substantially boosting NQ’s gross margin.  The auditor failed to notice that receivables from 
NQ’s largest purported trade debtor, Yidatong, are aged well beyond what the contract permits. 
Having noticed this might have clued in the auditor that Yidatong is really NQ. 
 
NQ’s acquisitions are highly likely to be corrupt.  Analysis of SAIC files of certain of NQ’s 
acquisitions shows inconsequential businesses with very little capitalization.  In some cases, we 
see shareholders of these purported technology companies who appear to be highly unlikely – 
villagers from remote parts of China who do not even have high school education.  In some 
cases, the companies were operating at ghost addresses at the time NQ acquired them.  “Ghost 
addresses” are a major theme in our due diligence on NQ.  A ghost address is not only one where 
the subject company cannot be found, it is one where no business can physically be found –
usually because the address does not exist. 
 
NQ’s cash balances are highly likely to not exist.  Certain purported movements of IPO funds to 
one of NQ’s onshore entities almost certainly could not have, and therefore did not, occur.  The 
classification of all of NQ’s cash and equivalents as Level 2 assets (meaning assets that are 
somewhat difficult to value) raises massive red flags about what evidence of cash balances NQ 
has given its auditor.

The	
  Vast	
  Majority	
  of	
  NQ’s	
  China	
  Revenue	
  is	
  Fraudulent	
  
 
We conclude that at least 72% of NQ’s reported $32.2 million in 2012 China security software is 
fraudulent.1   SAIC financials for Yidatong, its largest customer, NQ’s enterprise and gaming 
companies, NationSky and FL Mobile, show indicia of fraud.  It is therefore likely that very little 
of NQ’s reported China revenue is real. 
 
NQ reported $32.2 million in security software revenue in 2012 from China. We believe that 
NQ’s real security revenue was $2.5 million to $7.7 million (7.8% to 23.9% of reported 
revenue).  NQ purports to generate security revenue in China from three sources: carrier billing, 
which consists of receiving payments directly from mobile carriers and through “Service 
Providers” (“SPs”), direct payment through third party payment services, such as its purported 
partner Alipay; and prepaid cards (which encompass scratch off cards and purportedly also 
activation codes provided to retailers).  (NQ might be preparing to fraudulently claim that 
carriers’ prepaid cards are another payment channel.) 
 
NQ’s carrier billing channel revenue is inflated by at least 362% after eliminating NQ’s 
fraudulent sales to the shell company it secretly controls, Yidatong. 
 
NQ’s largest customer is really NQ.  NQ secretly controls a shell company called Yidatong 
(“YDT”).  NQ claims that YDT is an independent company, and accounted for $20.2 million in 
2012 revenue.  In 2012, NQ’s China carrier billing channel revenue totaled $27.9 million, 
meaning that without YDT’s revenue, the carrier billing channel generated at most revenue of 
only $7.7 million, 72.1% lower than NQ purports.  (This is generous, as we believe that China 
carrier billing was likely no more than $2.5 million.)  After conducting extensive due diligence 
on YDT, we conclude that YDT is an empty shell with no discernable operation whatsoever.  
Further, YDT is really NQ.  Our due diligence process included visiting 10 sites purportedly 
occupied by YDT, all of which were empty or did not exist; studying YDT’s SAIC files and 
financial statements; searching for current and former employees; and reviewing various other 
records.  
 
YDT’s financial statements show that it generated a fraction of the business NQ claims YDT 
does.  YDT’s purported role is a SP (i.e., transaction processor), facilitating NQ’s billing of 
mobile carriers in China.2  For NQ to have generated $20.2 million in revenue from YDT, YDT 
would have to have generated at least that much itself because NQ receives its revenue from 
YDT net of YDT’s margin.  PRC accounting standards mandate that YDT book all funds it 
receives from the carriers as its revenue, and then book the payments to NQ and other clients as 
costs of sales.3

According to SAIC financials, YDT only generated $2.9 million in 2012 revenue, which is 14% 
of what NQ purports to have generated in revenue from YDT.  YDT would have had to generate 
at least the $20.2 million NQ purports to have generated from YDT…to say nothing of the 40% 
of YDT revenue purportedly attributable to other clients.4  YDT’s Cost of Sales account would 
include any amounts YDT paid to NQ and its other customers.  Instead, YDT generated only 
$2.9 million in revenue, and had Cost of Sales of only $1.8 million.  NQ reported accounts 
receivable from YDT of $9.3 million as of FY 2012,5 but YDT’s financials show total accounts 
payable of $3.7 million, once again showing the fraudulent nature of NQ’s financials. 
 
PRC GAAP requires that YDT’s financial statements book revenue gross of payments to NQ and 
other customers.6  The Business Tax (sales tax) of $97,000 YDT paid was a fraction of the more 
than $4.0 million it would have paid if it were generating the volumes NQ claims.  The lack of 
Business Tax payments confirms that YDT’s revenue is shown in its SAIC file on a gross basis.  
Under the PRC tax regime, YDT pays Business Tax on the gross amount of revenue it collects 
from carriers.7  If NQ tries to argue that YDT is just your upstanding tax cheat,8 the argument 
would not hold water.  The parties that purportedly pay YDT – China Mobile, China Telecom, 
and China Unicom – would require Business Tax invoices in order to avoid being taxed on 
monies paid out.  For YDT to generate a Business Tax invoice, it would need to pay the tax to 
the Tax Bureau, which would cause it to show up in YDT’s financials. 
 
YDT’s income statement is below.  It generated far less revenue, and paid far less in Business 
Tax than it would have were NQ’s claims not fraudulent. 
 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
4 NQ claims that YDT derives roughly 60% of its revenues from NQ.  Assuming YDT only has a 10% gross margin 
on NQ business, YDT would generate about $35 million.  See NQ “Response to J Capital Report, NQ: Not at Any 
Price,” August, 2013.

8 “Upstanding tax cheat” is meant to illustrate the cognitive dissonance many investors in China companies exhibit 
when they argue that a given company is not a fraud – it merely cheats on taxes, resulting in understated revenues on 
SAIC financials.

YDT’s balance sheet below shows total payables that are a fraction of what NQ claims its AR 
from YDT were at the end of 2012.  NQ purports that its AR from YDT was $9.3 million. 
 


 
 
YDT is a ghost company (because it is really NQ).  We tried extremely hard to find its 
operations, but were unsuccessful, despite visiting ten different office addresses throughout 
China.  We obtained these addresses from YDT’s SAIC filings, its website, NQ’s SEC filings, 
and other sources.  Five of the addresses were ghost addresses – i.e., it would have been 


Page 8 of 81
impossible for YDT to ever be there because the addresses did not exist.  (Ghost addresses are a 
theme that runs throughout our due diligence on NQ.)  YDT’s offices are either non-existent or 
completely empty.  NQ claims that YDT accounted for roughly 15% of NQ’s Q1 2013 revenue;9 
yet, YDT is clearly incapable of processing meaningful amounts of payments on behalf of NQ 
because it does not have even one employee regularly present to: 
 


• turn on the lights,  
• answer phones,  
• reconcile billing issues with carriers,  
• order office supplies,  
• pay vendors,  
• develop and implement marketing programs,  
• sell services to new and existing customers,  
• handle inquiries from existing customers, and 
• (duties from NQ’s purported contract with YDT): maintain the value-added technology 


platform, technology platform interface; provide verification codes for related products 
and technology support to customers; coordinate with telecom operators to ensure the 
testing and activation of client business; negotiate and communicate with telecom 
operators; maintain the revenue and flow search pages for customers; delete non-existent 
or discontinued users; review customers’ marketing methods; oversee customers’ 
compliance; develop, maintain, ensure stability and responsiveness of the information 
platform. 


(On the positive side, it appears as though YDT’s business model does not call for any human 
resource employees, which is an innovative approach to cost saving.) 
 
We explored several permutations of the address for YDT’s headquarters in Tianjin, before 
finding it in the Tianjin Haosheng Building. Because the lobby directory still had the prior 
tenant’s name plate posted for room 502-2, and the office door located off a narrow, dingy 
hallway was unmarked, we thought it was another dead end.  However, when queried, the 
building’s management office confirmed that YDT did indeed rent room 502-2. 
 
The manager of the building in which YDT has its headquarters said “this is just the registered 
address, but nobody works here…They all work in Beijing it seems, all of them, this is just the 
registered address, this is not their workplace, it’s in Beijing”.  However, the YDT employees do 
not work in Beijing…or Shanghai…or Xi’an…or any of the nine purported YDT addresses we 
found.  YDT is clearly a company trying not to be found.  Below is a summary of our site visit 
attempts and findings.  Actually, it is not really a company – we suspect that the meager revenue 
and expenses it did show were run through its books for reasons unconnected to its purported 
operations.

Previously the address for No. 41 was 
No. 3. No. 41 is now a kindergarten; 
prior to that it was a technical school 
and a middle school.  The office of 
the Community Residents’ 
Committee located nearby never 
heard of the company Yidatong and 
one member became borderline irate 
by the suggestion that Yidatong could 
be located at the same address as the 
school.    
 


 
We subscribed to NQ’s paid mobile apps via carrier billing on 17 different prepaid SIMs in order 
to see whether YDT shows up as the SP.  Unsurprisingly, it did not.  The results of our attempts 
are below. 
 


 
 
We understand that the same SP generally handles billing for both prepaid and postpaid accounts 
for a given carrier and city or province. 
 
The days sales outstanding from YDT stood at 167 days at December 31, 2012, despite the 
purported contract between NQ and YDT requiring settlement within 30 days.17  This 
contradiction affirms our conclusion that YDT is a sham counterparty.

45 days. NQ 2012 20-F, Exhibit 10.13, p. 8. 


Page 12 of 81
the contractual requirement is one of several data points we identified evidencing that NQ’s audit 
is materially deficient.  (See NQ’s Filings Make Clear that PwC’s Audits Were Sloppy for the 
discussion of the myriad audit failures.)   
 
The high DSO from YDT does not relate to international (i.e., non-PRC) business, and therefore 
is not subject to payment terms greater than 30 days.  NQ executed an agreement with YDT for 
international business in April 1, 2010 “that provides for up to one calendar month” to pay; 
however, that agreement expired on March 31, 2012.18  Aside from the issue of YDT not having 
an international department, NQ investor relations informs investors that all of YDT’s purported 
revenue is from PRC revenues. 
 
The contracts between NQ and YDT are sham contracts. NQ has executed two contracts for 
domestic business with YDT – one on April 1, 2010 and the other on June 1, 2012.  In addition 
to YDT’s failure to remotely adhere to the payment terms of the contract or provide a staff to 
carry out its purported duties, the following sloppy errors in the contracts exist because the 
contracts were never intended to govern a real business relationship. 
 


• China Telecom was not included in the original contract, it was included in the second 
• In the first contract, there was no mention of who owned the registered users. In the 


second contract, the registered users information and database were owned by both 
parties. 


• The arbitration clause was drafted in a way that could make any arbitration award 
unenforceable because it lacked necessary (and standard) language regarding the 
execution of awards. 


 
YDT’s purported application lineup shows that even if someone were trying to operate it as a 
business, it would fall far short of generating the approximately $35 million total revenue NQ 
claims YDT generates as a SP.  YDT does not appear to represent any remotely in-demand 
products or provide any service of economic substance. A review of YDT’s website shows an 
unimpressive portfolio of 12 products: three e-book readers, two video game simulators, two 
products from NQ, Microsoft’s Mobile MSN, and the ever essential “Network Clock” 
application.  
 
NQ and YDT have a history of suspect financial dealings.  YDT received “advances” from NQ 
each year between and including 2007 to 2011 in amounts totaling approximately $5.0 million.19  
It is stunning that NQ’s auditor has not looked closely at YDT. 
 
The claim that NQ would have needed to work with YDT does not hold water.  YDT is supposed 
to be a “Service Provider” (“SP”), which is a company that the Ministry of Industry and 
Information Technology (“MIIT”) licenses to provide “value added telecommunication services” 
through mobile phone carrier billing.  In the past, SPs aggregated content from mobile “Content 
Providers” (“CP”), and provided it to carriers.  The content was 2G content, such as ringtones 
and SMS alerts.  At the time, CPs had no way beside carrier billing to charge users, and carriers 
did not yet have their own app stores.  Around 2006, China’s SPs began to die out as content

Page 13 of 81
costs went up because the content was more data-rich, and carriers launched their own content 
platforms.  The late 2000s became even tougher for SPs because of the proliferation of direct-to-
CP payment options, such as Alipay.  Alipay generally allows CPs to keep about 95% of the 
revenue, versus 60% to 80% for carrier billing through SPs.  In order to determine how relevant 
the SP model is, we called approximately 300 SPs from a list of 1,800 SPs provided by MIIT.  
Approximately 50% of the SPs are out of business.   
 
All of these facts beg the question “Why would NQ rely on SPs when SPs are dying businesses, 
and NQ could keep more money billing users directly?”  Two more facts make this question 
even more important.  NQ received its own SP license from MIIT in 2007, and thus would have 
no reason to deal through a tiny SP that is in perpetual need of interest-free loans from NQ.20,21  
NQ’s investee company, and as of 2012, wholly-owned subsidiary, FL Mobile, received its 
Beijing SP license in 2010.22 The answer to the question posed is that YDT is not a real 
company.  Its purpose is to assist NQ in defrauding investors. 
 


YDT	
  is	
  really	
  NQ.	
  
 
In August, 2013, NQ blatantly lied to investors about the nature of its relationship to YDT.  NQ 
was responding to a limited circulation research report that raised a number of questions about 
the Company, including its relationship with YDT.23  YDT is one of the worst disguised related 
parties we have encountered in our years of trawling the sewers of US-listed China companies.  
The key is YDT’s 75% owner, Ms. Rong Xu.  Ms. Xu also previously worked at NQ. 
 
YDT is clearly not a separate business from NQ.  Undisclosed related parties are essential 
elements of China fraud. 
 


• As of December 2011, the Guangdong branch of China Mobile showed YDT and NQ 
both as being based at NQ’s Beijing office, with the same phone numbers, and the same 
contact person (Chen An An). 24  
 


• A list of service providers that China Mobile publishes for Fujian province listing of 
Service Providers show that YDT’s telephone and fax numbers are (tel) 010-8565-5555 
and (fax) 010-8565-5518.  NQ’s Chinese webpage lists those very same numbers as it 
main numbers on its Contact page.25,26 
 


• YDT’s email server is the exact same server as NQ’s.

• The landline customer service number YDT provided to the Ministry of Information 
Industry and Telecommunications (“MIIT”) is NQ’s customer service number – NQ 
customer service representatives answer this phone when dialed.27 


 
l Yidatong and NQ gave a Zhejiang government registry the same employee, Wang Qiu, 


as the official contact person.  Wang Qiu must be a NQ employee, as both entities once 
again used NQ’s phone number as the contact number.28  
 


• The company information sheet in YDT’s Shanghai SAIC files gives a NQ email address 
as the email contact: xuying@netqin.com.  (Net Qin is NQ’s former name, and 
netqin.com is one of NQ’s domains.)   
 


• NQ has repeatedly provided interest free loans to YDT totaling approximately $5.0 
million, despite YDT purportedly collecting money from carriers before sending a 
portion onward to NQ. 


 
NQ also blatantly lied about the extent of YDT’s majority owner, Ms. Rong Xu’s, involvement 
with NQ, including the dates on which she became involved with NQ, and when she left.  NQ’s 
response stated the following: 29 
 


• Ms. Xu worked at NQ for less than six months, as marketing director, and then left NQ in 
2007 in order to buy her stake in YDT; 


• YDT is a separate and completely independent business from NQ; and 
• NQ accounts for only 60% of YDT’s revenue. 


 
NQ has taken pains to convince investors that there was no overlap between Ms. Xu’s time at 
NQ and YDT.  In reality, Ms. Xu’s involvement with NQ is not just overlap – it is entanglement.

• Ms. Xu became involved with YDT far earlier than when NQ claims she left.  In 


February 2006, Ms. Xu is shown as YDT’s Executive Director – over one year before 
NQ claims she left in order to join YDT.30    (Executive Director is the title commonly 
used when a company is small and only has one director.) 
 


• Ms. Xu was director of a company that came to own 25% of NQ in 2006.  In November 
2006, a company of which Ms. Xu was (and still is) a director, Yiteng Beijing 
Technology Co. Ltd. came to own 25% of NQ.31  One of the other Yiteng directors and 
shareholders is Ma Jun.  Ma Jun is Ms. Xu’s co-shareholder at YDT.   


 
It is important to note that one of the present Yiteng shareholders is NQ co-founder Mr. 
Xu Zhou.32  Mr. Zhou and Ms. Xu appear to have an exceptionally close relationship, 
which is essential to understanding her ongoing entanglement with NQ.  Strangely, the 
month after Yiteng became a shareholder, Yiteng transferred its ownership to Mr. Zhou 
and three other individuals.  We do not know how to interpret these actions, but it is clear 
that Ms. Xu is part of the inner circle of NQ, and not just the marketing advisor NQ 
claimed.  One theory we have is that these people were figuring out how to structure the 
NQ fraud, and had a number of fits and starts. 
 


• Ms. Xu became YDT’s Legal Representative in February 2007; however, NQ awarded 
her stock options for her “services” in a company that was not established until March 14, 
2007.33,34 


 
• Ms. Xu was still a Senior Vice President at NQ well into 2008, approximately one year 


after NQ claims she left.  A May 20, 2008 Sina.com news article about Red Cross benefit 
for earthquake victims shows a picture of NQ Senior Vice President Ms. Rong Xu.  She 
was holding up a NQ sign as presented a donation.

As shown in the graph above, Ms. Xu is involved in three companies with NQ co-founder and 
director Zhou Xu.  It appears that Mr. Zhou and Ms. Xu presently share office space – we found 
an employment ad 9H placed in August 2013 in which the workplace address is the same as Mr. 
Zhou’s office at Jingxiu.  The two had an endearing microblog exchange just prior to NQ’s IPO: 
 


Mr. Xu Zhou, 5/3/2011:   
 
Dear brothers and sisters, after sharpening our blade for ten years, today we entered 
NYC, my heart is pounding, awash in emotion, the great dream in my heart, friends 
fighting together shoulder by shoulder, there glorious future is before us, and in ‘13  you 
will see 9H. 
 


Ms. Rong Xu reply, 5/4/2010:  
 
5/5, IPO day in New York, overflowing with excitement, the red five-starred 
banner waving in the wind, and the traders are grinning. Family and dear friends 
lend support, keep the price up throughout the night, keep the numbers across 
screen continuously flashing green.  We are rejoicing.  We are moving down the 
path to success, a brilliant future is dawning - -- 9H is next, go go go! 


 
In reality, NQ’s carrier billing channel generated $2.5 million to $7.7 million in 2012, versus the 
$27.9 NQ purports. 
 


NQ’s	
  Third	
  Party	
  Payment	
  Channel	
  is	
  Non-­‐Existent.	
  
 
NQ’s third party payment channel is non-existent and its China payment portal is purely 
cosmetic.  We therefore extrapolate that this channel provides no revenue to NQ.  We tried 59 
times to make payments to NQ through third party payment services via NQ’s payment portal 
(http://pay.nq.com), such as Alipay, TenPay, and banks between September 26th and October 
18th.  We were unsuccessful each time.  (Note that Alipay and Tenpay are China’s two largest 
third party payment services.) 
 
We called Alipay and TenPay customer service twice for assistance, and none of them were able 
to make NQ’s payment portal work.  They all confirmed that the problem is with NQ, not their 


Page 17 of 81
service.  Alipay customer service stated that NQ is not a partnering merchant, which contradicts 
NQ’s claim that it partners with Alipay.35 NQ also claims that Yeepay, which is not shown on 
NQ’s site, is a payment partner.  Yeepay confirmed that NQ is not a partner either.  It is easy for 
businesses in China to open accounts with Alipay and Yeepay, and we are left to conclude that 
NQ deliberately avoids doing so.   
 
The NQ payment portal’s lack of functionality is clear affirmation that NQ is a fraud.  The 
cosmetic portal calls to mind John Hempton of Bronte Capital’s exposé of Universal Travel 
Group (de-listed, formerly UTA).  UTA had claimed to be one of the largest online travel 
booking sites in China.  In reality, it was a Zero.  Hempton attempted to use the slick-looking 
website to book travel, but was unable to complete his purchase because the website had no 
functionality.  It was also purely cosmetic, and designed to fool US investors into thinking the 
business was real.  NQ’s portal appears to serve the same purpose – to provide legitimacy at a 
glance to investors and to its auditor.  It does not process payments, and NQ’s customers have 
not noticed because, by and large, they do not exist. 
 
In committing fraud, it can be almost as important to avoid legitimate transactions as to record 
fake ones.  We theorize that the reason NQ’s payment portal does not work is that it would make 
it more difficult to fool its auditor if NQ were receiving legitimate payments from these payment 
processors, but in the trifling amounts that NQ would generate.  If NQ is showing its auditor 
forged transaction documents from these payment processors, tiny monthly payments from the 
same payers hitting NQ’s account might get the auditor’s attention.  Bernard Madoff claims to 
have executed no real trades in his fraud – likely for this reason.36 
 
Alexa data evidencing minimal traffic to the payment portal shows that nobody besides short 
sellers noticed the problem, despite NQ claiming to have approximately six million paying 
customers in China.  We did not find any versions of NQ apps that allow for payment through 
third party payment processors.  It is extremely unlikely that NQ has partnered directly with 
banks for payments because that would put NQ further ahead of most of China’s third party 
payment processors. 
 
We therefore extrapolate that the third party payment channel generates an immaterial amount of 
revenue for NQ. 
 
NQ’s claims that its security apps are on approximately 55% of smart phones in China is patently 
false.37  Two independent market research firms have pegged NQ’s market share as less than 
35% - often much less.38  Our own surveys conducted in three Tier 1 cities, one Tier 3 city, and 
one Tier 4 city, yield market share of only 1%.  We estimate that NQ has no more than 250,000 
(300 million smart phones times 1.4% times 50% active user ratio times 10% paying user ratio 
paying users in China, versus the approximately six million it purports to have.

The purported combined amount of third party processor and prepaid card revenue in 2012 was 
somewhere between US$4 million to $10 million.39  NQ does not break out how much was 
attributable to cards, versus third party channels.  (Transparency is the enemy of fraud.)  We 
concluded that third party payment channels contribute immaterial amounts of revenue.  We 
conclude the same for NQ’s prepaid card channel. 
 
Prepaid cards consisted of scratch off cards and activation codes.  Based on NQ customer 
service’s difficulty in directing us to prepaid vendors in major cities, and our pre-installation 
channel checks, which show minimal penetration for NQ, we are skeptical that many (if any) 
retailers in China have access to NQ’s access codes via automated systems or DVDs.  Moreover, 
after we found the cards, we discovered that NQ only allows an account holder to use a prepaid 
card one time before being converted to carrier billing.  That fact alone ensures that prepaid card 
revenue is insignificant.

We made four calls to customer service to inquire about where to buy prepaid cards in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Shijiazhuang (a large city near Beijing), and Guangzhou.  In every case, including for 
Beijing (NQ’s headquarters), customer service was unaware of whether there were sellers in 
those cities, and if so, who they are or where they were located.  Prior to October 14, 2013, 
customer service was willing to go the extra mile to help find them, in two instances we received 
follow up calls/texts from customer service with more information.   On October 10th, we 
received a text back from NQ customer service advising us of the location where we could buy 
the cards in Guangzhou.  We received a separate call back from NQ’s customer service regarding 
the Beijing distributor’s retail location.  We were told that the Beijing vendor is the only seller in 
the city, and that no distributors were operating in Shanghai or Suzhou.  Additionally, their text 
message informed us that the Company was just in discussions with a distributor in Shijiazhuang 
(Hebei province) but that they were not able to sell cards at this time. 


Despite apparently being NQ’s exclusive vendor in Beijing, the seller is located in a spartan 
kiosk (B 1088) in the basement of a computer mall in the Zhongguancun section of Haidian 


Page 20 of 81
District, Beijing.  (Of note, NQ’s registered addresses for the WFOE and VIE are also in 
Zhongguancun.)  This seller sells no products or services except for NQ cards, although the stand 
appears to be under common ownership with the kiosk on its right, which sells HTC, Android, 
Samsung, Sony, and Apple products.  
 
Whereas the Beijing seller’s kiosk embraced a minimalist aesthetic, the Guangzhou seller looks 
like a Costco, featuring a virtual cornucopia of products available for sale.  The Guangzhou 
seller occupies a roughly 100 square foot stall in a computer mall on the first floor of the Haiyin 
Center in Guangzhou’s Dongshan district, but every square inch is packed with merchandise, 
most of which is jewelry, scarves and cell phone accessories staffed by a father/daughter team.

We interviewed both vendors about the prepaid cards and learned that neither sells very many 
cards, and neither thought there were other vendors nearby.40  The Guangzhou seller said she 
was not sure whether there were other distributors nearby, but did not think that many other 
retailers would be interested in selling these cards because the profit margin is low. 
 
The Beijing seller echoed the Guangzhou seller, stating that while there were some sales, they do 
not sell a lot, and not for much profit.  Mr. Zhang, the vendor, indicated people who do buy tend 
to be customers who already knew the product. Potential customers look and leave, apparently 
because they do not seem to understand the product. When asked how they came to sell NQ’s 
prepaid cards, Mr. Zhang explained that they are old friends of the family, and they do it to “help 
them out”.

throughout a marketplace and to other similar markets as well.

The one-year prepaid NQ card (above, left) is a dead giveaway that hardly anybody ever buys 
these cards.  The sell thru rate of these cards appears to be very low as the cards on the left still 
bear the old logo.  NQ announced its new logo on June 11, 2011; therefore, these cards are well 
over two years old.41 
 
The RMB 13 cards contain an interesting clue.  The bottom left corner (difficult to see in the 
photo) contains the logo for the company that owns the kiosk, Beijing Huahui Yunzhen.  Huahui 
appears to be a tiny company, yet NQ printed up numerous cards with that logo.  That indicates 
that as insignificant as Huahui is, it occupies a rarified place in the pantheon of NQ’s business 
partners. 
 
While conducting this research we learned that NQ produces prepaid phone cards for China 
Mobile that enable anonymous calling – these are most likely to be used by telephone spammers.  
(See The Farcical Side.)  On the right of Mr. Zhang’s display case are branded prepaid NQ app 
cards, and in the middle are the unbranded anonymous calling cards.  
 
NQ’s lack of physical presence and virtually non-existent effort to update its merchandise, or 
build out its retail distribution are a clear sign their fraud is not focused on Chinese consumers, 
but rather US investors. 
 
We proverbially poked NQ with a stick in the prepaid card area in order to observe how it reacts.  
As we expected, the reaction was interesting.  An investor recently asked NQ investor relations 
(on our behalf) for names and addresses of some card and code resellers to secretly shop.  At the 
same time, we were regularly calling customer service asking for card vendor information.

impression is that customer service gets few calls overall, and that calls about prepaid cards are 
far rarer.  Investor relations had seemed willing to arrange appointments with purported vendors, 
but as any investor who was burned in companies such as China Biotics and China 
MediaExpress will attest, such prearranged meetings can easily be frauds as well.  The investor 
responded by asking for names and contact information so that we could secretly shop the 
vendors.  Investor relations has not responded. 
 
After asking investor relations for information on China prepaid card sales and sellers, customer 
service began refusing to discuss prepaid cards.  October 14, 2013, we called customer service 
again to inquire about card sellers in other cities.  The service representative said to us that they 
only provide technical support for the products and do not engage in sales, instead kept referring 
the customer to other sales channels.  While on the surface this response appears relatively 
benign, their prior willingness to help check, identify, and contact us through follow-up 
communication was noticeably absent.  We believe this was a result of a corporate directive to 
forbid further disclosure of details on the Company’s prepaid card distribution (or lack thereof). 
This lasted for a few days.  Then customer service changed its tune again, urging callers to buy 
prepaid cards for China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom to pay for NQ apps.  We 
believe that NQ was preparing for being exposed as having no real prepaid card sales by being 
able to retort “You do not understand our business; prepaid cards also include carriers’ cards”.  
To the extent this is true, it is a payment method only a few days old.

Taobao Marketplace is owned by Alibaba, and is a very large, reputable website in China similar 
to both Ebay and Amazon.42  It dominates China’s online B2C and C2C markets. We found only 
three sellers of NQ prepaid cards listed on Taobao Marketplace, and we believe two of these 
sites belong to the Beijing NQ Card Distributor.  All three sites show meager sales at best.   
(Consistent with our view that the anonymous phone cards are not a Kosher business in China, 
there seem to be no NQ anonymous card sellers on Taobao.)  One of the sellers, “NQ Card 
Agent” prominently displays a card with the old logo. 
 
Taobao also provides seller data analytics.   Below is the sales data for the three sellers.  Beijing 
Huahui Yunzhen is the kiosk we visited in Beijing. The Beijing NQ card distributor sells not just 
NQ products but also cell phone recharge cards.  Of the prior six months’ 48 reported sales, only 
11 sales were for NQ cards. NQ Card Agent’s Taobao year-to-date sales are only 348.5 RMB, 
approximately $57.13 (fifty seven dollars and thirteen cents).  Performance at their sister 
company was equally dismal. The Guangzhou kiosk has not made a single sale on Taobao since 
April of this year.

A review of rough comparables on Taobao further suggests that the online market for premium 
or even moderately priced mobile phone software for Chinese consumers is very small, and 
pricing is competitive.  (Free-ware remains by far and away the most popular choice.)  Over the 
past month, the number one and number two leading sellers were retailing their paid software for 
just RMB 5 (US$0.82).  Kasperski’s RMB 1.3 (US$0.21) security software managed only three 
sales.  All others posted numbers in low single digits or sold nothing at all.  
 
NQ’s physical and online presence in China is at best anemic. NQ’s inability to cultivate a sales 
ecosystem suggests that neither retailers nor consumers are interested in selling or buying NQ 
products.

Muddy Waters’s survey-based market research estimates that NQ’s actual share of the China 
security app market is 1.4%, versus NQ’s purported approximate share of approximately 55%.  
Based on our research, we estimate that NQ has fewer than 250,000 paying customers in China, 
versus its claim of six million.  (This yields revenue of approximately $2.5 million, versus the 
$32.2 million NQ purports to generate.)  NQ, its competitor QIHU, and some market research 
firms have cited various market share studies that have very different results.  NQ’s latest claims 
are that its share of the China security app market is approximately 55%.  On the other hand, 
QIHU claims that its market share is 70%.43  We came across research by iiMedia that shows 
NQ’s market share is only 7.2%.44  We set out to settle the question of which research (if any) is 
likely to be accurate by conducting surveys of smart phone owners.   
 
Our research shows that NQ’s China market share claims of approximately 55% are ludicrous, as 
are its claims of having approximately six million paying users.  Our surveys of over 800 
respondents from five cities show that NQ’s share of the China mobile security app market is 
only 1.4%.  In contrast, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (NASDAQ: QIHU) has 73.5% market 
share in our survey, followed by Tencent Holding Ltd. (HK: 700) at 15.7%, Kingsoft Corp. Ltd. 
(HK: 3888) at 4.9%, and “other” at 3.8%.   
 
As we show in the pie charts on the next page, NQ’s (lack of) market share was remarkably 
consistent across the Tier 1, Tier 3, and Tier 4 cities.  QIHU is dominant across all cities we 
surveyed, but has given more ground to Tencent in Tier 1 cities than in the Tier 3 and 4 cities we 
surveyed.  Overall, 58.8% of respondents had some form of security, antivirus, or data protection 
software on their phones.  
 
NQ might criticize our survey sample as being too small to be significant; however, this sample 
size is large enough to reject with 95% confidence a null hypothesis of NQ’s market share being 
far, far lower than NQ claims.  The key is the massive delta between what NQ claims and what 
we found.  There is no way to bridge that gap.   
 
NQ might criticize our survey sample as being geographically flawed – in other words, we did 
not conduct surveys in the markets in which NQ is strongest.  This criticism would not hold 
water though.  The product at issue is distributed over the mobile Internet.  There are likely some 
variations in NQ’s market share from city to city, but given the roughly 60 percentage point 
delta, rejecting our findings for geographical reasons would be a de facto argument that there are 
special places in China that are connected to a very different mobile internet.  Moreover, NQ has 
refused to disclose any information on where in China it actually has market share.  A long-
oriented recently investor asked NQ investor relations director Matt Mathison for some – any – 
detail on where NQ’s market presence is strongest.  Mr. Mathison replied that NQ does not 
disclose this information.  (Transparency is the enemy of fraud.)

With NQ refusing to provide any detail on its China markets, we chose three of the four Tier 1 
cities: Beijing (NQ’s hometown), Shanghai, and Shenzhen.  We then chose two cities in 
Zhejiang province as the respective representative Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities: Ningbo and Huzhou. 
We chose Zhejiang because it was the most pro-NQ means we could think of doing the survey. 
NQ previously announced its first major nationwide sales promotion and established an 
agreement with the Zhejiang-branch of China National Postal and Telecommunications (PTAC) 
to pair up NQ software with 3G cell phones PTAC was distributing.45  Ningbo (about 2.5 hours 
drive from Shanghai) has a population of 7.6 million, 3.5 million of whom reside in the urban 
areas.46  Ningbo’s 2011 per capita GDP was RMB 79,500 (Shanghai’s was RMB 82,600).47  
Huzhou (about one hour drive from Shanghai) population is 2.6 million, with an urban 
population of 1.1 million.48  Huzhou’s 2011 per capita GDP was RMB 58,500.49   
 
If NQ wants to dispute our conclusion that it has laughably low penetration rates in China, 
actions speak louder than words.  Investor relations should refrain from hemming and hawing 
about the samples we have taken, and tell us exactly where in China NQ has high penetration 
rates.  Anything else NQ says to try to refute this point is a waste of toner.

permitted.)

Note that pre-installations account for only 6.5% of the apps on phones.  On one hand, this 
suggests that pre-installations are irrelevant to market share.  Another interpretation is that NQ’s 
claims about its pre-installations are exaggerated.  Based on our retail channel checks (infra), NQ 
is just as obscure at retail as on users’ smartphones. 
 
NQ’s massively exaggerated claims about its market share started with a Frost & Sullivan report 
from late 2010 or early 2011 (the period during which NQ was in late stage preparations for its 
IPO).50  The Frost report estimated that NQ had 67.7% market share in 2010.  We believe that 
NQ paid for this report, and that the research methodology did not involve collecting data from 
users.  We believe that the methodology instead was a combination of accepting NQ’s data at 
face value, and speaking with industry parties friendly to NQ.  Since then, NQ has primarily 
relied on research from a firm called Sino MR to support its market share claims.  We do not 
believe the Sino MR research is remotely credible, as we are skeptical of Sino MR’s ability to 
manage the conflict of interest – let alone keep a straight face when discussing conflict 
management.

Our examination of 113 phones at various stores across five cities in China concluded that NQ’s 
pre-installation or bundled software channel is close to being non-existent as of Q3 2013 in 
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang (Hebei province).  This does not 
mean that this channel did not exist before, but it is actually the behavior of software providers 
such as NQ (the 315 incident) that has resulted in less software being bundled because handset 
manufacturers and operators have realized bundling can damage their businesses. It is also easier 
than ever before to download apps, and some handset manufacturers have their own branded 
apps.  
 
54.0% of the phones we checked had no anti-virus software on them, and only four out of 113 
phones had NQ installed. Two of the phones (Samsung) were bought in Beijing and had 
originally been display phones.  All other phones of the same model in that store had no NQ 
software bundled with it.  All of the NQ bundled phones with the exception of one had also had 
additional antivirus software on it from Tencent.  We therefore theorize that NQ employees paid 
store employees to install the software.

The below download numbers come from two of China’s largest independent app stores, 
Wandoujia and 91 Zhu Shou, and show that NQ has miniscule market share.  NQ’s “Likes” as a 
percentage of comments (29.66%) is among the lowest on the list, and compares unfavorably to 
QIHU’s 360 Mobile Phone Guard at 92.84%.

We estimate that about 80% of the comments on Wandoujia regarding NQ are negative.  Some 
of the more commonly used adjectives are “gangster (流氓)”, “brute (禽兽)”, “garbage (垃圾)”.51  A 
number of commenters wondered how NQ has been able to survive.  Here are some of the ones 
that we found more pertinent to show users’ opinion of the product. 
 
Note that 91 Zhu Shou is owned by BIDU, which has an acrimonious relationship with QIHU, 
which is likely the reason that QIHU is not offered in the store.

NQ recently addressed the paucity of downloads in these stores with a non sequitur:  
 


“For example, if an analyst tried to verify market share data for handsets in China and 
surveyed 1000’s of people in the streets of Beijing or Shanghai, they might find results 
that would show 65% of users have Samsung-branded phones while 35% have Apple’s 
iPhone.  One might conclude from this faulty sampling methodology that there is no way 
that Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, or Xiaomi would have the kind of market share that actually 
exists.” 52 


 
These two stores represent over 200 million downloads of security apps, including significant 
downloads of apps produced by the clear market leaders, QIHU and Tencent.  Again, it seems 
NQ wants investors to accept that there are places in China with their own very special mobile 
internet, and users who are super motivated to seek out NQ.

  SEC	
  
Financials	
  
 
NQ’s SAIC financial statements largely match those in its SEC filings; however, NQ’s SAIC 
financials are fraudulent.  This means that NQ’s SEC filing financials are also fraudulent.  A 
company prepares its GAAP and tax financials from the same set of books.  In the PRC, 
companies are required to file PRC GAAP financial statements to SAIC.  If the SAIC financials 
are fraudulent, then the books from which they are drawn are as well.  In the case of a US-listed 
public company, the fraudulent books form the basis for the SEC financials.  Therefore, 
fraudulent SAIC financials tell us that SEC financials are also fraudulent. 
 
Of course we know that NQ’s financials are fraudulent from having observed the Yidatong 
fraud, customers’ inability to pay through NQ’s payment portal, NQ’s miniscule prepaid card 
sales, and the barely-existent position NQ occupies in the China market.  Putting those elements 
aside and assuming no pre-existing knowledge of NQ’s fraud, NQ’s SAIC financials contain 
significant indicia of fraud. 
 
Chinese media called NQ’s SAIC financials into question the day before NQ’s IPO.  The 21st 
Century Business Herald (often referred to as “The Wall Street Journal of China”) published an 
article titled “Netqin investigation, the night prior to public listing - inflated sales proceeds”.53  
The article noted that while NQ’s 2009 SAIC financials matched its prospectus, its 2008 SAIC 
financials showed revenue that was only a fraction of what the prospectus claimed.  (We 
presume that in the chaotic pre-IPO environment, the parties responsible for executing the fraud 
overlooked 2008 SAICs.)   
 
Certain of NQ’s tax disclosures and accounting are significant indicia of fraud and fraudulent 
SAIC financials.  (These misses also evidence a sloppy audit – see NQ’s Filings Make Clear that 
PwC’s Audits Were Sloppy.)   
 
Bungled tax treatment is common in China frauds.  Accounting for a fraud is much harder than 
accounting for a legitimate business.54  Business accounting is a largely rote exercise – 
accountants are merely documenting historical facts.  On the other hand, fraud accounting 
requires imagination and the ability to organize a complex web of lies, on top of business 
accounting skills.  Few book cookers are perfect, and one of the most common areas in which 
they make mistakes is in accounting for taxes on revenue and income.  China’s tax laws and 
regulations are complex and rapidly changing.  There is a constant stream of national, provincial, 
and local preferences coming into effect and expiring.  We noted significant tax accounting 
problems in frauds perpetrated by CCME, DGW, RINO, and TRE.   
 
China frauds tend to claim tax preferences for which they are not eligible.  One staple of audits 
in China is tax payment documentation.  Frauds can forge payment documentation, but 
motivated auditors can spot forged tax payment docs if they diligently seek to confirm their

authenticity.  (Many China auditors are neither motivated nor diligent.)  Another option frauds 
have is to actually pay taxes commensurate with their fraudulent financials.  This method is 
obviously costly, and is often not worthwhile.  The best method we have observed so far is to 
claim tax treatment that precludes the need to pay much in the way of tax.  Many China auditors 
seem either to miss that the claimed preferences do not apply to their clients, or believe in a 
Guanxi Fairy that bestows extralegal tax treatment on the company from the local tax bureau.   
 
After analyzing NQ’s SEC filings and SAIC files, we believe that NQ made a number of tax 
errors in the filings for its Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise (“WFOE”) NQ Beijing, FL 
Mobile, and NationSky because NQ’s internal and SAIC financials are fraudulent.  We explain 
those errors in Appendix B.

MW engaged a team of top-flight specialized software engineers to analyze potential 
vulnerabilities in NQ’s Antivirus 7.0.  Both they and we were shocked a) at the amount of 
sensitive data (including location data) the app collects, b) by the fact that it sends much of this 
sensitive data to its server in China, c) by the fact that it also sends this data onward to a Chinese 
analytics company, d) that the uploaded data is extremely poorly protected (the engineers opined 
that the lack of protection could be deliberate), and e) that due to the lack of basic safeguards on 
downloaded data, users’ phones can easily be loaded with malware by third parties.  The 
elephant in this room of course is the Chinese government and “The Great Firewall of China” 
that reads and records all data going into and out of the country.  The encryption AV 7.0 uses is 
pointless because it includes the key with the data it is encrypting, which is akin to leaving the 
key hanging out of a safe. 
 
All mobile apps need to secure the transmission of information and the information being 
transmitted in order to provide basic protection to the user. This is typically accomplished by 
using standard technologies and techniques, some of which include HTTPS, SSL/TLS, and 
digitally signing the payload being transmitted. These techniques authenticate the server and the 
payload to the user, and prevent hackers from inserting themselves between the company and the 
users by using Man in The Middle attacks (MITM). 
 
NQ Antivirus 7.0 does not adhere to these technologies, techniques or any other best practices. 
For some uploads, NQ “Gzips” the data and relies on an encoding technique using XOR (0x6e) 
instead of encryption. Without encryption, all of the data NQ admits to gathering in their privacy 
policy is uploaded to servers in China as near plain text.  Other data is encrypted; however, it 
includes the key used to encrypt the data as a simple encoded string broadcast along with the 
payload, making the encryption nearly worthless.  The data so “protected” includes: 
 


“SMS, MMS, Email, Contacts, call log, call conversation, location information, phone 
number, the IMSI, the IMEI, the ICCID, the ESN and the model of the phone, the 


Page 33 of 81
software that is installed and apps that are running in the phone, and information about 
analytics on your operation, your favorites, network connection and downloading.”55 
 


This means that all of the above user details are vulnerable to hackers sniffing the network 
between the user and NQ’s Chinese servers, and the Chinese government.  NQ sends the data as 
well to TalkingData.net, which is a Chinese data analytics service. 
 
When downloading data from the server, NQ does not use HTTPS or SSL. The result is that NQ 
users are vulnerable to Man in the Middle (“MITM”) attack, a technique wherein a hacker 
impersonates the NQ server and intercepts all of the above listed data the app broadcasts. NQ 
does encrypt the data transmission from server to app, however it includes the key used to 
encrypt the data as a simple encoded string broadcast along with the payload, making the 
encryption nearly worthless. 
 
By modifying their host file, our engineers were able to perform a MITM attack against 
themselves and discovered an additional special command that directs the application to 
download and execute any file from any server on the device. 
 
Rounding out our analysis of the app / server communication protocol failures, we note that NQ 
does not sign its downloads. Without a digital signature, the user app has no way of 
authenticating the download or ensuring that it came from anyone other than NQ.  
 
The engineers’ report with details on the app, server and payload failures of NQ Antivirus 7.0 are 
available in Appendix C.

NQ’s	
  International	
  Revenue

  Overstated	
  
 
NQ’s purported $36.5 million on 2012 international revenue is absurd, and to be almost entirely 
fabricated.  Our conclusion is based on analyses of app downloads, retail site visits, calls with an 
international carrier, discussions with NQ management, and discussions with industry 
consultants and NQ competitors.   
 
NQ claims that its ex-China revenue in 2012 was $36.5 million.  However, Distimo analytics 
estimates NQ’s year-to-day worldwide revenue at less than $800,000.  Distimo is a web analytics 
company that tracks over 3.2 billion downloads per quarter, and is widely used by web and 
mobile companies.  Distimo tracks downloads from Google Play, the world’s largest Android 
app store; and, Distimo develops estimates for app and developer revenue.  The year-to-date 
chart below shows daily revenue on Google Play for 35 countries.  Distimo tracks the following 
NQ products: Android Booster, Easy Battery Saver, Family Guardian, Easy Finder, Mobile 
Security, Mobile Security for Retail, Mobile Security 6.0 and Antivirus 7.0, Security Multi-
Language, Vulnerability Killer, Super Task Killer and Vault (the Dataset):

The Year-To-Date chart below shows daily downloads on Google Play for the Dataset above: 


 
 
NQ tells investors that its strongest markets are in Southeast Asia and the Middle East – 
particularly Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Dubai.  It claims an annual ARPU in these 
markets of $15.  The monthly blended ARPU in Thailand is $7.13, with 60% of Thais using a 
mobile device to access the Internet.56 
 
NQ has its co-headquarters in the US, spends significant sums of money on PR, and yet does not 
generate meaningful revenue in this market.  (It is not a coincidence that revenue from the US 
would be much easier to audit than that from developing countries.)  Our site visits to 84 retail 
locations in the US that are supposed to sell NQ products, and conversations with management 
of some of NQ’s US distribution partners yields attachment rates generally of only 2% to 3%.  
The average ARPU in the US is $46.50.57   
 
The graph below from Distimo data compares the average daily revenue of Lookout, Kaspersky, 
and NQ, across all mobile security products.  We understand that Lookout’s worldwide mobile 
security app revenue is less than $10 million annually.

Our conversations with former mobile security employees of NQ competitors, such as Lookout, 
Kaspersky, and AVG makes clear that the best markets for mobile security are North America 
and Western Europe.  Developed world consumers are far less price sensitive than developing 
world consumers, and are more willing to spend money on mobile security, despite not facing as 
many malware threats as in the developing world.  Developed world conversion rates from 
download to paying user are around 2%.  Developing world conversion rates are lower. 
 
The primary reason malware is so much more prevalent in the developing world is precisely 
because people are unwilling to pay for apps – they often download pirated versions of apps for 
free, and these apps often are malware. 
 
At the end of Q2 2013, NQ’s DSOs were 198 days.  The Company states that much of the high 
AR balance is due to its international revenue, and that its processors often have 180 days to 
settle.  The industry people with whom we spoke all said that in their experience, their 
companies received payment in 30 to 45 days – even in emerging markets.  The companies for 
which they worked utilize carrier billing, direct payment, and Google and app store payment 
mechanisms.  Direct carrier billing is the most costly and time consuming of these methods.  
None of these industry experts could understand why NQ takes so long to receive payment. 
 
NQ reveals nothing about its partners in its key overseas markets.  Yet, it seems that every time a 
US-based executive signs up for a new loyalty program, NQ issues a press release about a 
“partnership”.   
 
It seems that most of NQ’s high revenue international partners are not carriers, but rather are 
some type of intermediary.  However, NQ claims to have the lowest user acquisition costs in the 
world, at approximately $0.07.  Given that NQ is dealing through multiple layers to get to 
customers, it is highly unlikely its acquisition costs would be the lowest in the world.  Given that 
NQ has a fraction of the user base it claims to, its user acquisition costs are probably in reality 
close to being the highest in the world. 
 
We previously noted NQ’s penchant for turning the most mundane event into a headline.  It is 
somewhat ironic that it did so with Telefonica.  NQ signed an agreement with Telefonica in 
connection with their Blue Via platform on February 27, 2012.  Blue Via is a payment service 
created to foster development of new apps by facilitating payment integration.  Telefonica offers 


Page 39 of 81
this service free to any developer willing to adhere to its ethical policy.  There are approximately 
3,000 developers using Blue Via, and we understand that Telefonica has never terminated any 
relationship.  There is no minimum sales requirement to be on the platform.  Telefonica provides 
no marketing support, other than the Blue Via portal.  In short, being an app developer on the 
Blue Via platform is as special as having the last name Smith.  The irony though is that one of 
Blue Via’s nicest features is that it processes payments quickly – developers generally receive 
payment within 15 days of the end of the month.   
 
One of our consultants with knowledge of Blue Via said, “There have not been many downloads 
of NQ software. Just a few.  It’s not a big business.”  Telefonica’s mobile security vendor of 
choice in Brazil is F-Secure, not NQ.  Consumers download F-Secure from the Vivo app store.  
The attach rate for F-Secure was 6% after a two week trial period in June 2011, and was 
considered a success by Vivo.  Vivo pays F-Secure within 30-45 days after the customer is 
billed, as is customary for mobile app payments. 
 
The mobile security app market is much harder than NQ makes it appear 
 
The mobile antivirus and security revenue constitutes a negligible segment of the overall 
antivirus software market.  Desktop antivirus companies offer a mobile product for competitive 
reasons, often at a loss, to lock their customers into a multi-device solution and reduce the 
opportunity for competitors to poach their customers.  Because it does not have a desktop app 
with which to create a bundle, this opportunity is not present for NQ. 
 
The US retail channel is not well-suited to mobile security app developers.  Android smartphone 
industry has grown and created opportunities for antivirus and security companies that can 
demonstrate their value and have strong brand recognition. However, retail is a difficult sales 
channel to penetrate considering stores want 30% to 40% of gross revenue.  Stores require 
collateral and sales person training in order to effectively pitch the product.  
 
Retail salespeople are seldom motivated to sell security apps.  Selling mobile antivirus at the 
retail level is a lot of work for a little money, and without a catalyst to drive mobile antivirus 
sales such as the CodeRed and Nimda viruses consumers do not feel the pain enough to motivate 
the purchase an antivirus solution. The goal of antivirus companies is to get consumers to accept 
desktop pricing for mobile solutions, however that has not yet occurred. 
 
NQ’s lack of a desktop product creates a disadvantage when it comes to retail sales and the sales 
person upon whom they must rely has a store full of products to sell, most of which can be sold 
quickly, require little sales training, are more popular and provide a greater economic incentive 
to sell than NQ products. After selling the NQ product the salesperson must physically install it 
on the consumer handset and register the consumer with NQ, a time consuming process with 
little upside for the salesperson. Salespeople tend to view NQ as a product to sell as a last resort 
if they can’t upsell any of the other easier products they traditionally sell.

The farcical facts we uncovered about NQ sometimes made it easy to forget that the Company is 
committing a very serious fraud.  Such chicanery is not unusual in the China fraud context – it 
usually seems to result from a fraudulent company desperately trying to find ways to generate 
real revenue in order to relieve some of the pressure of having to constantly cook books.  Some 
of the stranger things we came across when looking at NQ were its knockoff Segway (MW 
internally dubbed it the “Family Guardian Emergency Response Vehicle”); the anonymous 
calling cards; black hat SEO that is likely infringing trademarks belonging to Samsung, Apple, 
and other large companies; claiming to pay $1.55 million to a middleman for a 10-year lease on 
its URL; having a “NQ for Men” philandering tool app, and falsely claiming to have just 
discovered viruses. 
 
Below are pictures of NQ’s knockoff Segway (http://inmotion.nq.com).
 








 
NQ should produce Breakin’ 3 Don’t Crash 
Into a Tree and do product placement. 
 


 
NQ’s anonymous calling card business is silly.  China now requires an ID to buy prepaid cards.  
Anonymous calling cards are relatively rare in China, and are not condoned by the authorities.  
(This is why we believe NQ’s brand is not on the card.)  The main market for anonymous cards 
is likely telephone / SMS spammers and scammers.  Investors might find it ironic that a company 
that makes anti-spam software also enables spam.  However, as we explain in NQ’s 3-15 DNA, 
NQ was exposed by China’s state television news for infecting phones with malware in order to 
sell users the cure.   
 
Card buyers need to download software to operate the anonymous card.  The two vendors told us 
that the URL on the anonymous card, http.KD.tl (.tl is an East Timor domain.), is the site from 


Page 41 of 81
which to download the software.  (NQ has an affinity for two-letter domains – as we highlight 
infra, it claims to have paid $1.55 million to an anonymous party for 10-year rights to 
www.nq.com.)  Similar to how NQ has responded to our prepaid card inquiries, it suddenly 
removed all content from the website on October 18th.  The Beijing vendor also changed his 
story about the cards on October 18th – as we discussed supra, we rattled NQ’s cage with our 
prepaid card queries.   
 
NQ is behind the anonymous calling cards.  The software used references NQ, and a website 
through which the software operates http://secretclothes.com, lists NQ’s webmaster, Zhang 
Guobao, as the contact. 
 
NQ’s is likely infringing the trademarks of Samsung, Nokia, HTC, NTT, Vodaphone, and Apple.  
NQ is engaged in “black hat SEO” by registering URLs with these trademarks in them, and 
pointing them toward NQ’s US website.  On October 21, 2013 we ran a Reverse IP lookup on 
NQ’s website, www.netqin.com, located at 211.151.59.30.  These servers host domains that 
include expected regional variations of the NQ brand such as NQ.fr, NQ.jp.  However, these 
servers also host domains with the following trademarks in the URL: 
 


1. NOKIAsecure.com 
2.  NTTsecurity.com 
3.  SAMSUNGsecure.com 
4.  securityHTC.com 
5.  securityIPHONE.com 
6.  VODAFONEsecurity.com 


All of these domains redirect to en.NQ.com.   
 
We would be surprised if these companies licensed their trademarks to NQ for this purpose – 
particularly in the case of Samsung, which has a similar URL for its security equipment division 
(www.samsungsecurity.com).  We have already sent letters to the general counsel for each of 
these companies.  This black hat stunt would be far less likely to happen at a real company. 
 
Pimpin’ sure gets a lot easier with NQ for Men.58  NQ for Men appears to be a mobile phone app 
that keeps significant others from being able to see the “black book” part of the contacts, call / 
SMS history to black book contacts, and blocks calls and SMSes from these contacts during 
inconvenient times.  MW acknowledges that there is likely a niche market for this product, but 
we are not sure it is something with which a global leader in mobile security would be involved.  
Note to Anthony Weiner: read the section titled NQ’s Antivirus Makes it Easy for the PRC 
Government and Hackers…  before using.

NQ’s claim to have paid $1.55 million for the domain www.nq.com is outrageous.  NQ claims to 
have paid the money in July 2011, but the curious thing is that the domain was transferred to an 
anonymous registrant in 2011, and then subsequently transferred to NQ in October 2011.  The 
seller of the domain in July 2011 was a company called Conexus Software.  It appears to have 
been very small – there was no physical address or phone number on the website as of June 
2011.  Google searches reveal little online information about it.  Two possibilities strongly 
suggest themselves: a) NQ had a related party purchase the domain from Conexus for far less 
than $1.55 million, and then sell it to NQ for an inflated price, or b) NQ had a related party 
purchase the domain from Conexus for far less than $1.55 million, and then claimed to buy it for 
$1.55 million when in fact the price was much lower – this would have helped NQ burn off some 
“fake cash”.  Of course it is always possible that Conexus was able to command such a windfall 


Page 43 of 81
price for the domain, but we would bet against it. Another interesting fact is that we called the 
original seller and he told us he was not at liberty to discuss the transaction without speaking to 
counsel first – it sounds as though he had a NDA. What is so secretive about selling your domain 
unless there is more to it than just “www.nq.com was sold for $1.55 million”? 
 
NQ is “scare ware” – NQ Antivirus 7.0 is hardcoded to tell the user the NQ discovered two 
viruses the same day the user installs the app.  Upon installing NQ antivirus 7.0 and running an 
initial scan, the user receives a scare-ware message indicating that certain viruses have been 
recently discovered. This message is presented to all users, and the discovery date is always the 
same as the date the app was installed. 
 





When we examine the code, we can see that these virus alerts are actually hardcoded into the 
application, and are presented to the user by default: 
 





We searched the Internet hoping to find an actual user who has been infected with these viruses. 
We scoured user support groups, competing antivirus company websites, carrier websites, etc.

We did not find anyone who has been infected. What we did find were multiple websites that 
mindlessly regurgitate NQ press releases put out through PR Newswire service:

NQ broke the cardinal rule of China fraud: Do not get into trouble in China.  State-owned 
CCTV, the most influential television news network in China, exposed some of NQ’s dishonest 
practices in what is known as the “3-15 incident”.  Every March 15th in China is Consumer Day, 
and CCTV airs investigative reports on companies that are among the more egregious in their 
business practices.  NQ was exposed during the March 15, 2011 program. 
 
CCTV revealed that NQ and its subsidiary, FL Mobile, were paying phone refurbishers in China 
to install both NQ and FL software.  However, the FL software was really a trojan, and about six 
hours after the user put a new SIM in, the phone would go haywire.  The performance would 
slow down, and users would see their phones uploading and downloading data without being 
commanded.  Non-NQ security apps were suddenly deleted.  However, users could obtain 
salvation by running NQ, which informed them that they would need to become paying 
subscribers in order to eradicate the virus. 
 
The exposure was a massive problem, and threatened to derail NQ’s fraud dreams.  Its IPO was 
postponed by a few months while it tried to paper over the bad publicity.  We spoke with a 


Page 45 of 81
former NQ employee who joined the Company after the 3-15 incident.  She informed us that NQ 
tells employees that CCTV the following year aired a retraction.  We viewed the 2012 program, 
and there was no retraction of any sort.  This appears to be a lie. 
 
NQ tells investors that CCTV privately retracted its reporting.  We see no evidence of the sort.  
We did come across an interview with the director of that episode in which the director reiterated 
that NQ and FL were culpable: 
 


China Times: The day after the report exposing NetQin and Feiliu Jiu Tian of jointly 
harming consumers, they declared there were serious discrepancies with your facts. 


Yin Wen: the content of Feiliu JiuTian’s statement really has no substance, they did not 
state what specific points were mistaken.  


The issue addressed in their statement was primarily that of the “version problem” 
followed by the “key” problems, and even went so far as to claim that they were framed 
by their competitors.  All so-called "great" companies claim they were framed by 
competitors when they are exposed.  Would CCTV’s 3-15 Gala show do such a thing?  
Now the two companies have removed their statements, both having already admitted 
their mistakes. 


In fact, the purpose of this program is to provide consumers with a clue. Although the 
program was only a few minutes long, in fact, we started the investigation of these two 
companies in October of last year and spent a total of four months of time investigating. 
In total we spent four months tracking them, determining how they did the downloads, 
assessing how they control users, all of this have been investigated very clearly. 


NQ tried to paper over its wrongdoing by submitting code to be certified as clean.  Obviously 
NQ submitted the OTHER code – i.e., the code without the malware.   
 
We have posted the 3-15 video on our website with subtitles.  We believe that investors will find 
it illuminating.  The video is at: https://vimeo.com/77704496. 
 
3-15 is important for investors to understand NQ’s management.  First, they obviously lack an 
ethical compass – that is the obvious.  More subtly though, this is evidence that they just cannot 
help themselves.  Scamming consumers for RMB 2 a pop was clearly a stupid risk given the 
hundreds of millions of dollars they could pocket through a successful stock fraud.  These are 
people who will steal the shirts off investors’ backs – without hesitating.

NQ would have viewed Omar Khan as the perfect front for its fraud.  That is why it offered him 
a pay package worth over approximately $20 million during the first three years, even though 
Mr. Khan had never been a C-level executive or a business operator.  This is by far the smartest 
thing the perpetrators of the fraud have done – everything else we have seen from NQ is average 
to poor tradecraft.  
 
By the second half of 2011, NQ was public, but it had barely pulled it off.  The originally 
planned March 2011 IPO date was scuttled because of the CCTV exposure of its malware 
installation operation.  (See NQ’s 3-15 DNA.)  Shortly after NQ went public, several high profile 
China fraud blowups caused investors to flee US-listed China stocks.  Because NQ was among 
the more poorly disguised frauds, its stock price lingered in the gutter. 
 
NQ’s true management had a previously successful blueprint upon which they called for 
inspiration.  China Fraud 1.0 generally involved having a smooth “CFO” who was usually based 
in the US.  The CFOs usually had enough professional background to talk numbers intelligently, 
but they were not involved in any real management, budgeting, or CFO-ing.  Their job was to 
market the stock.  This model worked extremely well for several years.   
 
NQ thus conceived China Fraud 2.0.  China Fraud 2.0 is about making the US “management” 
presence appear more substantive than it did with 1.0, i.e. have a Co-CEO, rather than just a 
CFO.  In addition, make the Co-CEO someone who really understands promotion and buzz – 
ideally, someone who would see opportunities to generate legitimacy for the Company by 
signing deals with US companies that lead to press releases.  Lots and lots of press releases.  
Give the Co-CEO a staff and latitude to make as many arrangements – no matter how small or 
unprofitable – with US companies as possible.  Finally, pair him with a former hedge fund 
manager to relentlessly market the stock.   
 
Omar Khan is a top-flight pitchman.  He had been the face of many of Samsung Mobile’s biggest 
product launches in the US, and for good reason.  He is smart, knows mobile, and connects 
extremely well with his audience.  Because he had never been an operator though, he would be 
much less likely to figure out NQ is a fraud.  In Mr. Khan, NQ got exactly what it needed – 
credibility, charisma, and naivete.   
 
For Mr. Khan, the approximately $20 million stock package NQ offered him was likely far more 
money than he had ever seen, given his career trajectory as a sub-C level executive at large 
corporations, such as Motorola, Samsung, and then Citibank.  NQ hired Mr. Khan out of 
Citibank in Dallas, TX.   
 
Mr. Khan is not a board member or executive of any of NQ’s China entities.59  
 
So far, this has seemed to work out extremely well for Mr. Khan.  His stock package is now 
worth approximately $100 million. 
 
It is possible that Mr. Khan has been defrauded every bit as much as NQ’s investors.  This 
certainly is not without precedent though.  When Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd.

LFT) was confirmed as a fraud, numerous very China savvy investors were stunned.  We recall 
conversations with some of these investors, and their shock was due to their faith in LFT CFO 
Derek Palaschuk.  Mr. Palaschuk was not the typical China Fraud 1.0 CFO – he knew his way 
around China companies, had long been based in China, and believed he had a substantive role in 
managing LFT.  Apparently LFT built a fake online banking environment just in order to defraud 
Mr. Palaschuk, all the while causing him to unwittingly defraud thousands of investors.  LFT and 
Mr. Palaschuk offer two lessons for NQ investors.  First, the only people whose integrity matters 
are China-side management and their cabal of advisors and enablers.  In NQ’s case, no such 
integrity exists.  Second, even the most sophisticated and deeply embedded executives are no 
match for the unfathomably large amount of tools and willingness to commit fraud available in 
China. 
 
NQ’s current and former CFO are old hands in the China Fraud world.  We do not suspect that 
they were ever culpable in the frauds with which they have been involved, and we are not 
suggesting that either knows that NQ is a fraud or is culpable; but, once somebody is tainted with 
a public company fraud, it is hard to get work at a non-fraud.  Prior to NQ, Suhai Ji, the recently 
departed CFO, headed business development for the New York Stock Exchange’s Beijing office.  
During his tenure, the NYSE listed several frauds, including Ambow Education Holding Ltd. 
(AMBO), China Intelligent Lighting and Electronics Inc. (formerly CILE), alleged fraud China 
New Borun (BORN), Duoyuan Printing (formerly DYP), Duoyuan Global Water (formerly 
DGW), and Universal Travel Group (formerly UTA).  NQ’s current CFO comes was a managing 
director for Asia investment banking at Piper Jaffrey.  During his time at Piper, Piper helped to 
underwrite BORN, DYP, DGW, and Gushan Environmental Energy (formerly GU).

We strongly suspect that the vast majority of the $127.9 million cash and investments NQ 
reported having as of December 31, 2012 is not actually in the Company’s accounts; rather, that 
some to all of NQ’s IPO proceeds have been diverted in order to further the accounting fraud.  
NQ’s disclosures about its cash and term deposits being Level 2 assets raise significant red 
flags.60  Its claim to have transferred approximately $47 million in IPO proceeds directly to its 
VIE contravenes China’s capital controls, and in our view, never really happened – we believe 
that the money was instead diverted. 
 
Forging cash balances in China is shockingly common and easy.  Unfortunately, cash balance 
confirmation is the only anti-fraud procedure most public company audits incorporate.  In other 
words, if a company can fake its cash balance, its auditor will generally conduct the audit with 
little to no skepticism.  China’s banks have very poor controls at the branch level, and branch 
employees have been co-opted in frauds countless times.  The auditor resignation letter for 
Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd. makes clear that branch level employees were complicit in 
the fraud.61  (The auditor only resigned after Bronte Capital and Citron Research scathingly 
exposed it as a fraud.)  China Auditors now sometimes take steps to improve the quality of cash

confirmations, including depositing a small amount of money in the client’s account and 
immediately requesting the client’s bank account statement to ensure the deposit shows up.   
 
The first warning sign about NQ’s purported cash balance being fraudulent is that in the 2012 
20-F, NQ classified all cash and equivalents, and term deposits, as Level 2 assets for 2011 and 
2012.  This raises questions about how NQ is claiming to hold its cash, and how NQ’s auditor 
confirmed the balances.  We cannot recall having ever seen cash classified as a Level 2 asset.  
Even more troublesome, the 2011 20-F classified all of NQ’s cash and term deposits as Level 1 
assets, but in the 2012 20-F, the 2011 balances were reclassified as Level 2 without any 
explanation.  The Level 2 reclassification raises worrying issues because the default assumption 
is that cash and term deposits of less than 12 months in safe banks are not Level 2 assets – that is, 
you should be able to derive their fair value without having to look at other assets for pricing.  
This default assumption was obviously the basis for the original 2011 classifications.  
 
NQ’s 2012 20-F makes the below disclosure about its cash and term deposits for 2011 and 2012.  
The 2012 20-F retroactively reclassified them as Level 2, but without explanation. 62

One therefore wonders what NQ is showing its auditors as evidence of the existence of the cash 
and the term deposits, and why the auditor deemed it necessary to reclassify 2011 cash and term 
deposits.  These facts raise real concerns about whether NQ’s purported cash is really there, and 
if it were, whether NQ is holding any of China’s infamous “wealth management products”.   
 
NQ’s purported implausible movement of funds makes it easier to divert funds without detection.  
When analyzing NQ’s SEC filings alongside its (fraudulent) SAIC financials, it becomes clear 
that NQ purports to have moved about $47 million of IPO proceeds to its VIE in a way that 
almost certainly would not have been permitted, and would therefore not have been possible.  
This claim is reminiscent of Sino-Forest, which also purported to have moved cash in ways that 
contravened China’s exchange controls.  Sino-Forest’s similar claims were essential to its having 
obtained unqualified audit opinions for 16 years, most recently from Ernst & Young.   
 
About $47 million of IPO proceeds purportedly ended up as a “term deposit” in the PRC 
belonging to the VIE.  This purported movement represents worst practices for managing risks of 
theft and other misconduct inherent in VIE structures.  Our view is that most to all of the cash 
transfer never happened, and that by purporting to have somehow circumvented China’s capital 
controls in order to transfer the money directly to the VIE, it makes it easier for NQ to carry out 
its fraud by forging its cash balances.  In order to understand these points, it is necessary to 
consider NQ’s corporate structure.  Below is a diagram of the relevant entities. 
 


 
 
The proper way to move money into the PRC is by downstreaming cash from NQ Hong Kong to 
NQ Beijing.  This may be in either the form of registered capital increase (i.e., equity 
subscription) or a loan from the parent (i.e., NQ Hong Kong).  This is neither a complicated nor 
lengthy process, and in fact, NQ did this with $20 million in January 2012 that it injected into

C. Organizational Structure


The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the March 31, 2013:
 


 
(1) Beijing NQ Technology Co., Ltd., or Beijing Technology, is our consolidated affiliated entity established in China and is 52.00%


owned by our chairman and co-chief executive officer, Dr. Henry Yu Lin, 33.25% owned by one of our directors, Xu Zhou and
14.75% owned by Dr. Vincent Wenyong Shi, our chief operating officer. The three shareholders of Beijing Technology are the
three founders of our company. We effectively control Beijing Technology through contractual arrangements.





(2) Beijing NationSky Network Technology Co., Ltd., or Beijing NationSky, is 55% owned by us through Beijing Technology and
45% beneficially owned by an individual previously not affiliated with us.





(3) Beijing Fanyue Information Technology Co., Ltd., or Beijing Fanyue, is 51% owned by us through Beijing Feiliu and the
remaining equity interests are beneficially owned by two other individuals previously not affiliated with us.

NQ Beijing via a registered capital increase. 64  NQ Beijing may then lend money without 
interest to the VIE, or to shareholders of the VIE.  In May 2012, NQ Beijing did just that – it 
loaned the VIE shareholders RMB 40 million,65 which was used to increase the registered capital 
of the VIE.  The problem for NQ is that moving money into NQ Beijing is easily tracked and 
verified because it is a WFOE – there are records in the SAIC files of registered capital 
increases.  In other words, there is a real paper trail when NQ moves money into NQ Beijing.  By 
claiming to have moved money in a way the auditor likely has rarely (or never) seen, NQ would 
have a much greater ability to commit fraud. 
 
NQ’s SEC disclosures and SAIC financials make clear that it is purporting to have loaned IPO 
dollars directly to the VIE, at some point the funds were somehow converted into RMB, and then 
the VIE placed the money in a (Level 2) term deposit.  
 
As you can see below, the VIE entities lost $3.8 million in 2011. Yet, cash at the VIE increased 
by $66 million.  Because the Company only generated roughly $12 million in free cash flow, the 
only source for such an increase in VIE cash is from the parent Company IPO proceeds. At the 
end of 2010, the Company had cash of $18 million and term deposits of $11.2 million. By the 
end of 2011, cash was $69.5 million and term deposits were $58.5 million largely as a result of 
the 2011 IPO that raised $82.9 million.  Much of the cash was therefore downstreamed as an 
intercompany transaction to the VIE from the parent.  SAIC financials confirm that NQ purports 
to have moved money directly to the VIE because they show the VIE as having Other Payables 
of $78 million as of December 31, 2011; however, the WFOE has no matching receivable.   
 


 
 
It is almost inconceivable that NQ would have been able to execute the purported transaction.  
Because the VIE is owned by PRC nationals, it is considered a “domestically-funded enterprise”.  
It is extremely difficult and rare for a domestic company to get approval to borrow money from 
offshore.  The VIE would have to apply to the National Development and Reform Commission 
(“NDRC”) to borrow from offshore for one year or more.  Such approvals are given only to fund 
loan projects that “are in line with national industrial policies and economic development 
planning”.66  Loans up to one year would have to be approved by the State Administration of 
Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”).67  An attorney from a leading PRC law firm that is highly 
experienced in working with VIEs said that he and his partners had never seen any private

Transferring cash directly to the VIE would represent worst practices for managing risks of theft 
and other misconduct inherent in VIE structures, and would make no legitimate business sense.  
Note that in the corporate structure supra, NQ shareholders do not own the VIE – rather, 
Chairman Lin and two associates do.  In practice, the various agreements constituting the VIE 
package give public company shareholders little protection against thieving VIE owners.  One of 
the basic tenants of VIE best practices is that as much of the company’s value (cash, operating 
assets, customer agreements, and employees) as possible be kept in the WFOEs (i.e., the entities 
the public company shareholders own via offshore entities.)  The notion that NQ successfully 
went through the complicated and uncertain offshore borrowing approval procedure in order to 
manage its cash in a way that contravenes acceptable practices, with no upside (i.e., just to dump 
into a purported term deposit), does not hold water. 
 
We believe that the onshore cash is far less than what NQ claims, and that it uses a portion of the 
excess to commit its fraud.  We believe that most of the IPO proceeds were diverted, and that 
portion was funneled into fake counterparties (such as Yidatong) to pay in as revenue.  We 
believe that NQ then uses some of its acquisitions to spit this cash back out to other fake 
counterparties who will send it back in for more fraudulent sales. 


NQ’s	
  Likely	
  Corrupt	
  Acquisitions	
  
 
There are reasons to believe (apart from the fact that NQ is involved) that NQ’s recent 
acquisitions are likely corrupt transactions.  NQ has completed or announced acquisitions 
totaling $25 million of cash and 15 million ADSes (worth about $350 million at the present stock 
price).68   
 


• NQ’s acquisition of the remaining 73.4% of Feiliu (aka FL Mobile) for a total of $62.7 
million is likely corrupt.  Feiliu was of course exposed by CCTV as a co-conspirator in

ratio.

installing malware onto mobile phones so that NQ could charge users to fix their phones.  
Just before NQ acquired the remainder of Feiliu, Feiliu added six new shareholders.  
These shareholders were literally given their equity – NQ decreased its ownership 
percentage by 4.2% when it handed its shares over to these individuals.   
 
The two new shareholders for whom we have been able to obtain background records are 
unlikely recipients of shares in the rapidly-growing, dynamic Feiliu.  One of the new 
shareholders, Xie Yuteng, is from a small city in Guangxi province, and is a middle 
school graduate.  Zhong Liang lives in a small city in Jiangxi province, which is not 
normally considered to be a technology center.  In other words, both appear to be 
villagers.  It is a common tactic in China Fraud to use villagers as fake shareholders – 
sometimes they are paid small sums for their cooperation, other times their identities are 
used without their knowledge or consent. 
 


• Feiliu’s November 2012 acquisition of Beijing Red Infinity Technology Co. Ltd. (“Red”) 
is likely corrupt, as there is a strong chance Red was a tiny company.  Red’s four 
shareholders became Feiliu shareholders at the same time as the two (likely) villagers 
discussed supra.  When NQ acquired their Feiliu shares one year late, they received 
compensation of up to $25.2 million.  According to Red’s SAIC files, Red was founded 
in January 2011, and when Feiliu acquired it, Red had received equity capital 
subscriptions totaling only $16,000 (RMB 100,000).  The below are Red’s summary 
financial statements from its SAIC files.   
 





• NQ’s acquisition, via Feiliu, in January 2013 of 51% of Beijing Fanyue Information 
Technology Co. Ltd. (“Fanyue) for $0.089 million and 10.5 million shares, is likely 
corrupt because Fanyue appeared to have been on its way out of business at the time of 
the acquisition.  It was “operating” at a ghost address.  According to SAIC files, Fanyue 
changed its office three months before NQ acquired it.  It moved from a real office 
building to room 1313 of the Jingshui hotel.69  When our investigator went to the hotel, 
he found that there is no room 1313.  The hotel staff had never heard of Fanyue, but 
speculated that the room to which 1313 refers is a conference room.  A mining company 
presently rents it.  Even at present, Fanyue’s website lists no contact phone number or

that does not want to be found.   
 


• NQ’s acquisition of 31.71% of Hesine for $0.5 million and 3.5 million shares is likely 
corrupt, because Hesine moved into a 160 square foot office one year after NQ acquired 
it, and Hesine’s business fell off a cliff. 


 
• NQ’s 30% acquisition of Pansi for up to $2.9 million is likely corrupt because Pansi 


appears to have been on its way out of business at the time of the acquisition.  Pansi was 
“operating” at a ghost address 


 
• NQ’s $38 million of acquisition of NationSky could be a corrupt acquisition because its 


SAIC financial statements, which show 2012 revenue of $15.2 million, appear to be 
fraudulent.  For analysis of the fraud indicia in its financial statements, see Appendix B. 


 
We theorize that the real purposes of these acquisitions are 1) to generate cash that will be 
recycled into NQ as fake revenue, and 2) line the pockets of the perpetrators.  NQ is paying 
substantial amounts of shares for these companies, and because the monetization occurs outside 
of China, it would be quite easy to book this cash as international revenue.   
 


NQ’s	
  Future	
  is	
  as	
  Bleak	
  as	
  its	
  Past	
  
 
NQ is attempting to pivot to a fraud that it hopes will be less obvious – gaming and advertising 
revenue.  NQ’s focus on gaming and advertising will not allow it to “grow into the fraud” by 
generating real numbers approaching its fraudulent ones.  NQ’s new purported strategy is 
predicated on NQ having the lowest user acquisition costs in the world – otherwise one would 
not expect to see a mobile security company go into gaming and advertising.  Because NQ has a 
fraction of the users it claims, and in reality possibly the highest user acquisition cost in the 
world, this strategy will inevitably fail to produce real profits.  Before Chairman Lin realized that 
there was a good fraud reason to push the myth of generating advertising revenue, he explained 
why advertising is incompatible with being a mobile security company, which is a logical 
argument (for a real company).   
 
NQ’s gaming strategy is being executed through its now wholly-owned subsidiary Feiliu.  (Feiliu 
was responsible for the malware installs exposed by CCTV.)  NQ has likely fraudulently inflated 
the value of Feiliu by many times (see NQ’s SAIC Financials are Fraudulent, Leading to 
Fraudulent SEC Financials).  In speaking with a recently departed NQ gaming employee, we 
learned that the revenue of NQ’s top games is a fraction of what NQ leads investors to believe.  
We also learned that many of the managers and employees responsible for leading NQ’s 
overseas gaming charge have also recently left.   
 


Page 55 of 81
NQ’s purported pivot into gaming is predicated on the fraudulent assertion that its user 
acquisition costs are the lowest in the world.  Co-CEO Omar Khan made this clear during a May, 
2013 interview:70 
 


Q: So how did you get from mobile to security to in app advertising and mobile gaming?  
I’m not necessarily seeing a direct correlation between the IP there. 
 
A: “It’s really about the platform.  The fact that we built a platform where we can acquire 
users in over 150 countries, or have billing integrated in local currencies in over 60 
countries, our ability to do that in an economical fashion.  Today we can acquire users in 
between, at about seven cents per registered user on a blended basis.  That’s a very 
advantageous economic scenario.  So the question we then asked ourselves is ‘What 
additional content types can we then run through that engine?’  I think it’s a similar 
evolution if you 12 years ago, or whenever it was, you had Jeff onstage at any of your 
conferences at Amazon and said ‘Ok, how are you going to run your business?’ 
 


NQ’s consumer monetization platform is a myth, and that reality voids any legitimate rationale 
for focusing on gaming.  NQ has far fewer users than it claims, and generates a fraction of its 
purported revenue – its user acquisition costs are therefore far higher than seven cents per 
registered user.   
 
Chairman Yu Lin explained in January 2013 why NQ would not look to advertising to monetize 
users: 
 


“Why don’t we take ads? I think the format of ads on mobile phones is not mature yet. 
Furthermore, there is a fundamental conflict between our safety service, by its very 
nature, and the advertising model. If you want to target ads accurately, there will be 
privacy issues.”71 


Yet, here is Chairman Lin discussing NQ’s exciting progress in generating advertising revenue in 
August 2013: 


 
“I am pleased to report that we again achieved record revenues in the second quarter of 
2013," commented Dr. Henry Lin, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of NQ 
Mobile.  "We are excited about the progress of our expanded monetization efforts across 
our platform.  As a leading mobile Internet platform, we will continue to grow our user 
base around the world and broaden our monetization capabilities.  We are now not only 
generating security subscription revenues but significant gaming and advertising 
revenues as well.  This is only the beginning of our exciting journey forward.”72 


 
We learned from a recently departed gaming division employee that NQ’s three best selling 
games are: Dragon Summons, War Fire, and Fight of the Three Kingdoms.  According to the

former employee, Dragon Summons generated about $1.6 million in gross revenue in its first six 
months; and, that the gross margin is only about 40%.  (The former employee said the gross 
margin is low in part because of payment processing costs.)  NQ tells investors that Feiliu’s 
gross margin is similar to that of NQ’s (ex-NationSky), which is about 75%.73  The former 
employee also believes that Fight of the Three Kingdoms is generating about $1,650 per day 
($600,000 annually); and, War Fire is generating about $1,300 per day ($500,000 annually).  If 
the former employee is correct, it is likely that Feiliu’s real revenue, profit margin, and profit are 
far lower than NQ claims.  (NQ recently advised that Feiliu is at a run rate of $40 million.74  
Considering that Feiliu only started to generate mobile gaming revenue in 2012,75 the purported 
run rate would be truly amazing if true.) 
 
NQ has stopped putting resources into international gaming and a number of the China side 
employees hired for international gaming have left, according to the former employee.  If true, 
this would contradict NQ’s Q2 2013 statement that Feiliu would expand into North America in 
September 2013.76  NQ changed Feiliu’s name to “FL Mobile” in Q1 2013 in anticipation of 
taking the rest of the world by storm.77 


NQ’s	
  Filings	
  Make	
  Clear	
  that	
  PwC’s	
  Audits	
  Were	
  Sloppy	
  
 
There are clear signs that PwC’s audits of NQ were sloppy.  It is very difficult to know from the 
outside how diligently an auditor performed its audit of a given company.  Knowing that an 
auditor is Big Four means little because the quality of the work within the same firm can range 
widely.  The experience of a former junior auditor with a Big Four firm in the UK is instructive 
in this regard.  At one of the UK offices to which he was assigned, junior auditors received 
bonuses for finding issues during the audit.  Yet at a different UK office at which he worked, 
juniors were evaluated in large part based on how quickly they worked.  Fraudulent companies 
often force their auditors to do sloppy jobs by creating delays during the audit process.  (To learn 
how important the audit slowdown tactic is to furthering fraud, see: www.whitecollarfraud.com.)  
 
The tells that NQ’s audits were sloppy are: 
 


• Failure to ensure that disclosures about cash balances by entity are correct.  (As we 
explain in NQ’s Cash Balance (a Level 2 Asset) is Highly Likely to be Fraudulent, we 
suspect that much of the cash on NQ’s balance sheet is not really there.) 


• Classifying Cash and Equivalents as a Level 2 asset in 2012, and reclassifying 2011 Cash 
and Equivalents as Level 2.  We cannot conceive of a circumstance under which Cash 
and Equivalents could be Level 2 assets.  If this was not a sloppy mistake, then PwC 
should require NQ to disclose the special circumstances surrounding its Cash balance. 


• Not booking restricted share issuance related to performance issuance. 
• Failure to ensure that share-based compensation is recorded at the correct entity.

• Failure to validate that receivables from NQ’s largest purported trade debtor, Yidatong 
(“YDT”), are aged over four months beyond what the contracts permits.   


• Permitting NQ to reclassify significant costs from Cost of Sales to R&D, which 
substantially boosted NQ’s gross margin.   





Cash	
  
 
At December 31, 2011, the Company reported consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $69 
million and parent company cash of $49 million.  That means that $20 million of cash was at the 
VIE and/or subsidiaries of the Parent.  However, the VIE reported a net increase/(decrease) in 
cash and cash equivalents of $66 million.  With the amount of consolidated cash and cash held at 
the parent, and since the VIE lost money and the WFOE did not generate much cash, it is not 
possible for the VIE cash to increase by $66 million.  Therefore, the auditor failed to properly 
audit the change in cash and cash equivalents. 
 
The consolidated term deposit balance was $58.5 million and the parent co term deposit was $0.  
Our view is that for the numbers to balance, the VIE would have to have invested in term 
deposits and that the increase in cash and cash equivalents would be lower by such amount.  Our 
view is also that only source of cash to the VIE was from the IPO proceeds at the parent.  Recall, 
our view is that the cash probably is no there at all and this is just a book keeping/balancing 
exercise. 
 
Our analysis of the SAIC filings for 2011 confirm that the Company booked everything as cash 
and cash equivalents.  However, this accounting is not correct under Chinese GAAP.  Term 
deposits should be accounted for as an investment and not treated as cash and cash equivalents.  
Therefore, we can reasonably assume that the auditors did not check the bank account statements 
and have relied on the Company’s internal reports for cash and cash equivalent disclosures.  We 
question the audit procedures and if PWC has qualified accounting staff working on this audit.  
A basic back of the envelope calculation would show that it was not possible for cash and cash 
equivalents to have increased by the amount disclosed given the amount of cash and cash 
equivalents on a consolidated basis and at the parent level.   
 


Level	
  2	
  Cash	
  
 
It’s hard to imagine a scenario where cash and cash equivalents would be a level 2 asset.  But, 
surprisingly, the auditor classified 2012 cash and cash equivalents as a level 2 asset and also 
reclassified 2011 cash and cash equivalents to level 2 from level 1.  According to a PwC FAS 
157 information memorandum 
 
Level 1 inputs – observable, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active 
markets. Examples include US government and agency securities, foreign government debt, 
listed equities and money market securities.  
  
Level 2 inputs – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for 
identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices e.g. 


Page 58 of 81
interest rates and yield curves. Examples include corporate bonds (investment grade, high yield), 
mortgage-backed securities, bank loans, loan commitments, less liquid listed equities, municipal 
bonds and certain OTC derivatives.  
 
Based on the definition of cash and cash equivalents, our view is that the auditor was either not 
able to verify the cash or it’s just another sign of a sloppy audit.  The reclassification of the 2011 
cash is a concern since that would imply that the auditor did see something since none of the 
cash and cash equivalents was put into level 1 assets as one would expect. 
 
As you can see from the level 2 definition, level 2 assets are much more risky and more difficult 
to value (compared to level 1 assets).  The combination of cash at the VIE and the 
reclassification to Level 2 from Level 1 is a red flag.  Especially, since we believe it was not 
transferred to the VIE in accordance with Chinese regulations. 
 


Share	
  Based	
  Compensation	
  
 
The Company is underreporting and misallocating share based compensation at the parent 
company.  For 2012, the Company expensed $24.5 million in share based compensation and 
disclosed $1.84 million cash compensation to executive officers and directors.  Over the same 
timeframe, the Company booked $5.6mm of total G&A expenses (or 9% of total operating 
expenses) at the parent of which we believe no share based compensation was allocated.  We 
believe that share based compensation was also not allocated to the parent operations in 2011 
and 2010.  First, the Company footnotes that share based compensation was included in the 
consolidated financial statements while no such footnote was included in the parent company 
footnotes.  Second, our analysis of the VIE and WFOE 2011 financial data shows that a nominal 
amount, if any, share based compensation was accounted for at these operating entities.  With the 
parent generating $20 million in sales (approximately 22% of total sales) and the VIE and 
WFOE generating the majority of the remaining revenues, the accounting and allocation of share 
based compensation appears to be another sign of a sloppy audit.  A substantial amount of the 
share based compensation was from US management and therefore should have been allocated to 
the parent in a much higher amount than shown.

terms and consistent with the contract between NQ and China Mobile which also call for one 
month settlement with payment being done on the 15th of each month78.  One month settlement is 
what other carriers have told us as well as retailers that sell NQ apps, including Telefónica and 
Verizon resellers.

Yidatong has DSO of more than 4 months.  The actual realized payment terms are far beyond 
industry norms.  This combined with the annual advances that NQ makes to Yidatong, and SAIC 
files that show much lower sales and amounts due to NQ, is a clear sign that something is wrong 
with this picture.  What are the auditors looking at (or are they doing more listening that 
looking)? 
 


Reallocation	
  of	
  Costs	
  to	
  Boost	
  Gross	
  Margin.	
  
 
In order to give the appearance of high gross margins, the Company has reclassified a material 
amount of expenses from cost of goods sold to R&D.  Based on our analysis of 2011 SAIC files, 
R&D expenses increased by 10x (or $4.5mm) during consolidation as a result of a shift in costs.

The Company discloses that most of the R&D is done in China.  Therefore, it is surprising to see 
such a large increase in R&D and a related decrease in cost of goods sold.  Also, there are 
incentives for Chinese companies to book as much to R&D as possible as a result of tax 
incentives.

  Fraud	
  Indicia	
  
 
NQ’s book cookers made the following tax-related errors in producing fraudulent financials for 
its various entities. 
 


• Claiming that in 2011, NQ Beijing paid a sales tax called “Business Tax”, rather than 
VAT.  NQ claims that NQ Beijing began paying VAT in lieu of Business Tax in 2012 
due to the expansion of a VAT pilot program to Beijing.79  Software sales have been 
subject to VAT since 2001. 80  The VIE and WFOE obtained their software developer 
VAT certificates in 2006 and 2008, respectively.  In order to maintain the VAT 
certificates, the companies would have needed to pay VAT on prior years software sales. 
The expansion of the pilot program to Beijing applied to industries other than software 
sales, 81 and thus would not have necessitated a sudden shift to VAT in 2012.  The likely 
explanation is that the book cooker realized that because VAT is administered more 
closely than Business Tax, it was advantageous to claim NQ is a Business Tax payer; 
however, the 2012 VAT reform gave NQ less room to maneuver with its auditor. 
 


• NQ Beijing’s 2011 SAIC financials show that the company essentially paid no Business 
Tax, despite claiming that NQ Beijing was subject at the time to Business Tax of 3% to 
5%.82  NQ Beijing’s 2011 income statement shows NQ Beijing’s purported 2011 
domestic revenue as being RMB 113.6 million.  (Business Tax only applies to domestic 
revenue.)  However, the income statement shows that NQ Beijing paid only RMB 8,000 
(eight thousand) in Business Tax and surcharges in 2011.  NQ Beijing should have paid 
at least RMB 3.4 million (340K, or 0.3% of revenue) in 2011 Business Tax. 83   


 
• In 2012, NQ Beijing’s book cooker had the opposite problem.  While the SEC filings 


claim that NQ Beijing began paying VAT in 2012, the SAIC income statement shows 
that NQ Beijing paid RMB 6.3 million in business tax on RMB 154.7 million in domestic 
sales.  NQ Beijing should have paid far less in Business Tax and surcharges because at 
least 35% of the revenue should be taxed with VAT, in addition to the revenue being 
taxed with VAT under the pilot reform.  Under PRC GAAP, VAT payments are not 
recorded in income statement accounts – they are only shown only as taxes payable on 
the balance sheet.  Therefore, the RMB 6.3 million is not mislabeled VAT.  It is just 
another mistake NQ made because its financials are fraudulent. 


 
• NQ Beijing’s SAIC financials fail to recognize as Non-Operating Income any VAT 


credits or refunds received.  Once again, NQ’s book cooker struggled with the taxes 
relevant to revenues.  To understand the VAT problem, one first needs to understand 
NQ’s claim about NQ Beijing’s income tax treatment.  NQ claims that NQ Beijing 
receives a corporate income tax preference for qualified software companies.  In order to

83 VAT for qualified software companies would be 3% of sales after refund. If all sales are VAT sales, the business 
tax and surcharge will be at least sales*3%*10% (10% surcharge rate) 


Page 67 of 81
qualify for this income tax preference, at least 35% of NQ Beijing’s revenue would have 
to come from software sales.  At least half of the software sold must be developed in-
house.   
 
The effective VAT for in-house developed software is 3% of sales, which consists of the 
17% statutory VAT NQ pays on its software sales, netted against a) VAT it paid on its 
inputs, which are generally very low for software companies, and b) a credit or refund 
from the tax bureau sufficient to ensure the effective VAT is 3%.  Again, NQ Beijing’s 
SAIC financials show that its domestic revenue was RMB 113.6 million and RMB 154.7 
million in 2011 and 2012, respectively.   
 
PRC GAAP mandates that the VAT credit or refund be recognized as Non-Operating 
Income. 84  However, NQ Beijing had no such income in either 2011 or 2012.  If NQ 
Beijing’s SAIC financials were not fraudulent, they would show at least a few million 
RMB in Non-Operating Income in each year.  Per a newsletter posted by the Haidian Tax 
Bureau (the tax bureau that receives taxes from NQ Beijing), cumulative VAT refunds to 
approximately 2,000 Haidian software companies in 2011 exceeded RMB 380 million 
(an average of about RMB 200,000 per company). 85   
 


• Omitting from NQ’s 2011 prospectus a purported income tax preference for NQ Beijing.  
In the prospectus, NQ stated that NQ Beijing “was subject to the prevailing income tax 
rate of 25% on taxable income for the years ended 2008, 2009, and 2010.” 86  However, 
in the 2011 20-F filed only 10 months later, NQ stated that NQ Beijing “was qualified as 
a software enterprise under the New CIT Law, which was entitled to enjoy preferential 
income tax treatment of income tax exemption for the first two years when it became 
profitable, followed by three years of preferential income tax rate of 12.5% up to 
2015…Therefore, NetQin Beijing was not required pay any income tax for the years 
ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011.” 87  Omitting a tax preference from the 
prospectus is much less likely when the company’s financials are genuine. 
 


• NQ’s SEC disclosures and SAIC financials show that NQ is shifting impermissibly high 
amounts of income from NQ’s variable interest entity (“VIE”) to NQ Beijing in order to 
avoid paying income tax.  NQ claims that NQ Beijing was exempt from corporate income 
tax in 2011, while the VIE paid corporate income tax at 15%.88  Under NQ’s onshore 
corporate structure, the vast majority of NQ Beijing’s 2011 revenue consisted of sales to 
the VIE.  The year before (2010), NQ Beijing only booked RMB 1.5 million in revenue, 
so the VIE would not have been shifting revenue to it until 2011.   


 
By purporting to shift about two-thirds of the VIE’s revenue to NQ Beijing in 2011, NQ 
lowered the VIE’s gross margin from 62% in 2010 to 17% in 2011.  Purportedly as a 
result of this shift, the VIE paid only RMB 106,000 in income taxes in 2011, which was

Page 68 of 81
only 27.7% of the VIE’s 2010 income taxes, while the VIE’s purported revenue grew 
193.2% in 2011.   
 
NQ Beijing and the VIE are located in the same building and pay taxes to the same 
district tax office.  PRC tax law requires business between related entities to be 
conducted at prices equivalent to those for arms length transactions.89  It is implausible 
that the VIE would be permitted to shift this much profit from an entity that pays income 
taxes to one that does not.   
 
The reason NQ’s SAIC financials show this revenue shift is because the Company pays 
minimal PRC taxes because it has far less profit than it claims.  The Company’s SAIC 
and SEC financials are fraudulent. 


 
• NQ claims that Beijing Feiliu (“FL Mobile” or “FL”) pays no income tax in 2012 and 


2013, and a reduced rate thereafter because it was approved for a software enterprise tax 
preference under the new tax law.90  This is not true.  The preference is only available for 
newly-established software companies.  FL was established in 2009, but obtained 
qualified software company status only in 2011.91  (FL would have gone through the 
qualification process after establishment in order to be eligible for VAT refunds.)  In 
order to enjoy the tax holiday, FL would need to have obtained its qualification in 2010.   
 
FL’s tax preference (forgetting the qualification timing issue) would only be valid for two 
years from and including its first profitable year.  NQ reported in its 20-F a US GAAP 
profit of $119,000 in 2011 on sales of $2.1 million (from SAIC). 92  It is unlikely that FL 
was unprofitable in 2011 for PRC tax accounting purposes.  The claim that FL would not 
have to pay tax in 2013 seems to be another example of bungled tax treatment resulting 
from fraudulent accounting.  


 
• NationSky’s balance sheet shows too few taxes due as of December 31, 2012.  NQ 


purports that Nation Sky generated $12.6 million of revenue in 2012, although 
NationSky’s SAIC financials actually show $15.2 million of revenue.  (The profit 
numbers are essentially the same though.)  Chinese companies file monthly tax returns 
for VAT and Business Tax, while they file income tax returns on a quarterly basis.  The 
yearend taxes payable balance should be at least approximately RMB 600,000.  The 
balance sheet shows only RMB 38,000 payable.   


 
Another suspicious element of NationSky’s income statement is that its 2012 sales and 
marketing expenses of only $479,000 seem too low to support a sales, presales, and 
marketing staff of over 80 people in 10 offices.

Data is sent from the App to NQ servers located in China 
 
During our investigation we discovered that that app is communicates with remote servers. 
We extracted the domains and IP that the app reaches and researched the IP using open source tools and 
services such as "WhoIs". We were able to show that the sites are located and hosted in china, and are 
owned by NQ. 
 
http://us.nqsrv.com - 211.151.59.8

We have also encountered requests to servers, which were not owned by NQ, but rather a 3rd party 
company named TalkingData, especially to: 
 
http://tdcv3.talkingdata.net - 211.151.121.41 
 
TalkingData is a company providing mobile data collection and statistical analysis platform, located in 
China.

TalkingData.net – 3rd party Chinese service provider 
 
Communication with Talking-Data's Servers is made throughout their app.  
 
The sent data is delivered to their servers at - tdcv3.talkingdata.net (211.151.121.41) 
 
The Request is an HTTP POST request to '/g/d'. 
 
All packets are sent compressed with GZIP. 
 
The packet that we have decoded contained potentially private information such as: 
 


• Device Model 
• Carrier 
• GSM Cell information 
• Wi-Fi SSIDs + percentage of reception 


This information packet is sent periodically, and upon app loading. 
 
Such information shouldn't be shared with NQ or any other 3rd party.  
 
The leaked information could lead to targeted attacks and reveal sensitive details about the user\device 
such as current location using Wi-Fi signals triangulation, device model\version for targeting specific 
exploitation methods etc. 
 
Software Update 
 
On the main screen of the application, there is a menu button on the top right corner. Clicking the "More" 
button of that menu, opened a new screen with a 'Check for updates' button. Clicking this button, the app 


Page 74 of 81
sends a plain-text request which contains among other things the IMSI and IMEI inside a readable XML 
format. 
 
This communication is delivered to NQ's servers - us.nqserv.com (211.151.59.8)  
 


 
 
App leaks all the web browsing activities of the user: 
 
It was discovered that the app sends every URL that is browsed in the device to a remote server located in 
China (211.151.74.173). The connection through which the data is sent is not encrypted, but rather 
obfuscated with an easily reversible method of XOR the URL with 0x6e. It means that the provider, and 
anyone that is "sniffing" the network has the ability to track the users and obtain all browsing habits of the 
user, and even in some cases get information that is much more critical such as usernames and password 
and session ids if they are transferred in the URL. 
 
We have tested the effectiveness of the URL tester and it indeed detects malicious pages, and blocks it. 
 





Page 75 of 81
Update virus database 
 
The most visible part of the app is the ‘Update virus database’ button, this button is in charge of asking 
the user for a payment. When clicked it makes the application communicate with a server owned by NQ 
at ms-cm.nqsecurity.com (211.151.59.57) and sends encrypted data. 
 
The request is an HTTP POST request to ‘boss-cs-av-v4/app.htm.’ 
 
The data sent from the App to server: 
 


• 10 bytes ‘newversion’ XORed with 0x6e. 
• 16 bytes of encryption key XORed with 0x6e. 
•   Data encrypted with AES using the key just before it. 


The data sent from the server to App: 
 


• 16  bytes of encryption key XORed with 0x6e. 
•    AES data following. 


The content of the encrypted data is in XML format. It contains commands that look similar to the 
previously described XML in the plain-text communications. The command is an integer value that 
indicates the indicator "type" of command rather than a "exec-command". 


Page 76 of 81
Page 77 of 81
In response to this request, the server returns a response indicating the applications payment state. It 
indicates whether the user paid already for enabling some features. 
 
It also specifies with which payment provider it should request payment from, and the amount of money. 
We saw Boku and Google wallet as providers. 
 


 
 
Remote Code Execution 
 
Goal: Determine if app allows remote code execution. 
 
Process:  Research the software update, request update from the server, and get a response. 
In this response, we saw there’s a command value. We looked in the code and saw that there’s another 
special command that is being processed which directs the application to download a file from the server 
or any address! 
 
At that point of the research we set up an experiment where we did man-in-the-middle attack on the 
device, technically we edited the hosts file so the NQ server so that they will point to our HTTP server 
instead of NQ’s one. The idea is to show that we got code execution on the device and so does NQ. 


Page 78 of 81
On our HTTP server we set up a response according to what we saw that the application expects. The 
response contains a different command value, which indicates to the client that it should download a file, 
and the URL of the file to download. Basically the file the protocol describes is supposed to be an .APK 
file. This file is later chmod’ed to become r+x so it could be executed later. 
 
The application was properly installed but requires approval by user intervention. 
 


Page 79 of 81
Page 80 of 81
Later on, we decided to go further and see whether we could override existing files and bypass the user 
intervention to get rid of the message box. We found out that if we change the returned XML without the 
message related fields, then no message box is displayed for the user. 
 
This technically leads to remote code execution on the device. We have to emphasis that this is not a 
vulnerability in the code, in contrary, this is part of a normal flow control of the code and can be easily 
exploited to push files to the device which are controlled by the server and could be malicious! 
 
The fact that the app is not using standard encryption is very odd especially when dealing with a company 
that is providing security products. Using standard SSL encryption could have prevented (or at least make 
it fairly impractical) this risk and others.
