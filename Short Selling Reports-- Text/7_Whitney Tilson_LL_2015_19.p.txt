Lumber Liquidators Has Failed To Disclose That Its Chief Compliance
Officer Has Left The Company
Jun. 2, 2015 2:24 PM ET50 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Ray Cotton has, according to his own LinkedIn page, left the company, but the
company has failed to disclose this.


Given that Lumber Liquidators is under investigation by numerous state and federal
agencies and is facing more than 100 lawsuits, Cotton’s departure is highly material
information.


The company’s failure to disclose this information strikes me as a serious breach of
disclosure rules.


At best, this is further evidence of a company in chaos and, at worst, one that is
trying to hide something.


Yesterday an acquaintance emailed me the link to the LinkedIn page of Ray Cotton,
Lumber Liquidators’ Senior Vice President, Chief Compliance and Sustainability Officer, in
which he makes it abundantly clear, for four reasons I outline below, that he no longer
works for Lumber Liquidators.


I was stunned to see this, not because of his departure – I saw the writing on the wall long
ago – but rather because the company hasn’t yet disclosed his departure to investors,
analysts, the media and regulators. (Editor's Note: Following a discussion with a former
senior executive at Lumber Liquidators, the author has updated this section, based on
information provided to him that changed his view of Mr. Cotton's role.)


Given that Lumber Liquidators is under investigation by numerous state and federal
agencies and is facing more than 100 lawsuits, all related to compliance issues (namely,
sourcing illegally harvested hardwoods and toxic, formaldehyde-drenched laminate from
China), Cotton’s departure is highly material information and the failure to disclose it
strikes me as a serious breach of disclosure rules.


Comparing Cotton’s LinkedIn Page Today With His Prior One


Here are screenshots of Cotton’s current LinkedIn page and his LinkedIn page on March
10 :th

When you compare these two pages, it’s clear that Cotton has left Lumber Liquidators, for
the following four reasons:


1. In March, he listed Lumber Liquidators as his “Current” employer vs. a “Previous”
employer now.


2. In the second line under his name, it used to say “SVP and Chief Compliance Officer at
Lumber Liquidators” whereas now it simply says “SVP and CCO”.

Comments (50)


3. His location has changed from “Richmond, Virginia” to the “San Francisco Bay Area”.


4. Under the most recent job in the “Experience” section, “SVP and Chief Compliance
Officer” of Lumber Liquidators, the dates in March were “September 2014 – Present”
whereas today there’s an end date: “September 2014 – May 2015”.


Conclusion


I cannot imagine why Lumber Liquidators has so far failed to disclose Cotton’s departure.
At best, this is further evidence of a company in chaos and, at worst, one that is trying to
hide something.

Hawkman, the issue is that LL has not disclosed this. Did you create an SA account simply for a personal attack? Are
you affiliated with LL?

Sensible Investor
Ironic how the liquidator part of the name has become prophetic. I agree with the author. If there's material news that
shareholders need to know, the company has the obligation to release it. It's a...compliance issue? The train left the
station on this one already, so the CCO's departure just raises more red flags and gives the legal side more reason to
pursue redress.

Good investigative work, but it appears that LL is not required to disclose Cotton's departure via an SEC filing.


http://bit.ly/1dcKdbN


8-K's appear required for departures or appointments of directors, the CEO, CFO, COO or President. Ray Cotton
does not appear to fall into any of those categories, and although his promotion to SVP was publicized via a press
release, there doesn't appear to have been an 8-K filed. Thus it would appear consistent to not have an 8-K filed for
his departure.


Perhaps LL could have mentioned his departure as part of a news release given the controversy, but there appears to
be no regulatory requirement to do so.

02 Jun 2015, 07:57 PM


JeffLassle
After following this issue for some time and watching Whitney Tilson quite honestly make a fool of himself on
false accusations I have to ask this question. Does anyone believe that someone or some group, an
environmental group to be exact, is behind Tilson on these accusations? I say this because Tilson has no
idea what he is spewing and I say this as a 25 year commodity trader in this sector out of China and
elsewhere who was the chief lobbyist on the CARB rules way back in 2006. As a former scientist with the EPA
involved in these issues I know a little bit more than Tilson does and find his comments somewhat laughable.


But people will believe a guy like Tilson but won't believe a scientist and veteran of the industry that he is
attacking. What I can tell you is that the vast majority of the trading activities do not center around the quality
control issue in China on the CARB rules. Furthermore, some of LL's competitors were not even certifying
their Chinese mills until about a year ago meaning that this is a witch hunt entirely focused on LL.


BTW, the industry for over 5 decades had brought in composite panels with 1.2 - 3.0 ppmv formaldehyde
emissions and not until the FEMA trailer issue had it ever been a problem; not until lawyers found a way to
make some extra cash.

Would be glad to talk about the toxicology of this simple aldehyde with anyone. By the way, California also
regulates potato chips and the compound acrylamides which is also considered a "known" carcinogen by the
EPA using the "precautionary principle". Anyone care to ask the question of what that means?

"As a former scientist with the EPA involved in these issues I know a little bit more than Tilson does and find

Dr Lassle, if Mr Tilson comments are laughable, them of the EPA's 
work is economically laughable.


And yes, what does precautionary principle mean? Is it a subset of 
the Peter Principle?

Mr Handley, funny post of the day! (Too bad post was removed)


Mr Tillson, this is indeed significant..The more of senior officers  
leaving the firm, the bigger the blowup.


I had considered a position ten bucks ago but now this stock 
is a 4 quarter dead issue.


Perhaps they need a new line of products...The Shaq's All Star Hardwood Collection, where all impurities have been
dribbled out.


Whom is next to walk the plank?

Unbelievable. This scam will be coming to an end fairly soon. Yes, LL will go through many changes and they do not
have disclose any of them.


FarFromGuru, I almost fell off of my chair, laughing. Thank you for the humor.

Glad to brighten your day! It was deleted by the moderator. Apparently Whitney Tilson can trot out whatever
baseless accusations he wants the instant he gets the smallest shred of information, but I can't point out the
absurdity of it all by making up my own humorous parallel.

Whatelseisnew
EA is correct. Though I'm no friend of LL, this news is not specifically required by SEC to be disclosed. Is the
departure a "material event" in view of the ongoing compliance issues? Probably not, since a company, other than
financial, is not even required to have a chief compliance officer.


02 Jun 2015, 03:49 PM


EnerSavr, Contributor
Tilson,


"9. Ray Cotton, Lumber Liquidators' Senior Vice President, Chief Compliance and Sustainability Officer is "totally
unqualified for the job" and is a person that a company would hire if it was "knowingly sourcing tainted products and
didn't want the head of compliance to know about," Tilson said."


Your own words in another article, and you have the audacity to write about an article about him leaving.

HeadyChick
Mr. Tilson seems fixated on Ray Cotton. A previous article he wrote contained numerous pics of Cotton at the
Academy Awards. This is all rather stalkerish.


LL is entitled to make corporate changes as they see fit. No SEC violation has occurred. Mr. Tilson's motivations are
questionable, his allegations are false.

Elephant is right again. No 8k obligation to disclose the departure. Now maybe a press release is in order . But no
violation occurred. They may also have a new hire for the position that hasn't signed on yet. And wanted to make a
simultaneous announcement. They may feel no need to make any release on the position at all. I think they should
make a release but I don't think this event is the end of the world or lumber.

certain that Google's stock will be highly disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped

I come back to this article because, honestly, it's really something that the author didn't even pick up Form 8-K before
making the assertion that disclosure was legally required. I mean, seriously.


03 Jun 2015, 12:00 PM


metalhead
The fact that he's gone is interesting, but could be interpreted either as a positive or negative, depending on the
circumstances which we don't really know.


My cynical take is that Cotton was hired specifically to cover up compliance issues, and when he failed miserably he
got canned.


Either way I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10 foot pole and a Hazmat suit.

As a very senior officer of a subsidary of a publically traded company I think I remember my lawyers saying something
about let's ask for "XXX" resnigation or at least demote him/her so we can move forward with the insurance

I think a famous baseplayer said "It ain't over till it's over!"


There are some serious assets just laying around that might be worth more than the author of this article is willing to
