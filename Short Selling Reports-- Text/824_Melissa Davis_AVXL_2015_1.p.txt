Anavex: A Regulatory Target Damaged By Incriminating Evidence
Dec. 30, 2015 8:08 AM ET350 comments
by: Melissa Davis


Summary


Following a powerful rally fueled by overblown hype, Anavex just disclosed that the
SEC has launched a formal investigation of the company to search for evidence of
possible stock manipulation.


Suspicious from the start, Anavex looks almost like a reincarnated version of a
worthless biotechnology firm with disturbing ties to a pair of notorious con artists.


Over the years, Anavex has recruited a number of insiders linked to dubious
microcap companies and shady stock promoters.


Since its early days as a young penny-stock company, Anavex has outsourced its
investor relations duties to a tarnished publicity firm connected to a number of
suspected “pump-and-dump” schemes.


Anavex owes some of its current popularity to the glowing reviews published by a
so-called “doctor” who served as the chairman of a firm that charges for its favorable
coverage.


Anavex (NASDAQ: AVXL) should have known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission would eventually crack down on the company. A virtual magnet for stock
promoters from the very beginning, Anavex started tempting fate long before the SEC
decided to intervene.


Just wait until those regulators get a chance to conduct a thorough background check on
the company and its disturbing history. They might wonder how Anavex ever managed to
transform itself from an obscure penny stock into an overhyped Nasdaq highflier without
first attracting some pretty intense government scrutiny.


At this point, Anavex has literally spent years asking for trouble.

Anavex Co-Founder/Director Tom Skarpelos must have felt pretty impressed with
Acrongenomics (OTC: OTC:AGNM) when he oversaw investor relations for the young
microcap company - regardless ofthe crook who initially presided over its executive suite -
since he practically used that dubious (and now worthless) biotechnology firm as a role
model when he decided to create one of his own.


Retracing the steps taken by those who had launched Acrongenomics a few years earlier,
Skarpelos gained control of a Nevada-based shell with a handy listing on the OTC Bulletin
Board and then used it in a reverse merger that allowed Anavex to debut as a brand-new
biotechnology firm trading on the penny-stock exchange. Like Acrongenomics itself,
Anavex entered the world armed with little more than a handful of discarded European
patents- conveniently supplied, in this case, by a French doctor that Acgrongenomics had
recruited to its board - and farfetched plans to show up Big Pharma by delivering a
medical breakthrough.


Eager to take full advantage of the former Acrongenomics director who had provided the
company with its "new" patents - including the one issued for its lead drug candidate way
back in 1997 and now set to expire the year after next - Anavex also named Dr. Alexandre
Vamvakides as its chief scientific officer and copied Agrongenics (yet again) by welcoming
him as a member of its board.


Anavex quickly snatched up a technology specialist with a very interesting connection to
Acrongenomics, too. Officially hired by Anavex as its original I.T. manager, Stelios
Xeroudakis also happened to manage the website for the mysterious laboratory that
supposedly housed the groundbreaking research conducted by Acrongenomics and
(years later) its dependable copycat. When Anavex negotiated its own contract with Euro
Genet Labs in 2010, more than a full year before it even secured approval to begin any
clinical trials, the company must have felt awfully generous. Under the terms of that three-
year deal, Anavex agreed to shell out a whopping $125,000 a month - or the equivalent of
$1.5 million annually - for access to research facilities located inside some obscure
laboratory with the same Greek address that both Acrongenomics and the company itself
have claimed as their own.


At least Anavex spared itself from the embarrassment of welcoming former
Acrongenomics CEO Rick Walchuk to the party, too, byreserving that invitation for another
longtime player in the microcap arena instead. The year after Anavex surfaced as a new
biotech stock, Walchuk finally managed to push his luck just a little bit too far. Together

with Caroline Winsor - an indicted fugitive long regarded as a serial penny-stock
manipulator - Walchuk attempted to pull off a new pump-and-dump scheme and fell right
into a government trap.


Later indicted on multiple charges of wire and securities fraud, Walchuk responded by
fleeing to his native Greece (the same country that the founder of Anavex happens to call
home), where a financial crime squad arrested him a couple of years ago and - after
locking him up in a filthy Greek prison for a few months - shipped him back to the U.S. for
another year behind bars.


Anavex did not respond to questions for this story.


Bad News


While Anavex may have avoided a direct connection to that particular mess, the company
has taken plenty of other chances that it could easily live to regret. Since its early days as
a young penny-stock company, for example, Anavex has relied on The Primoris Group for
publicity in spite of the firm's crowded roster of dubious microcap companies and its
suspected involvement in pump-and-dump schemes.


By the time that Anavex hired the firm almost a decade ago - using 50,000 stock options
to help cover the bill - Primoris had already developed a reputation for touting the very sort
of sleazy microcap stocks responsible for giving the industry such a horrible name. Just a
few years earlier, records show, Primoris had actually joined forces with a group of shady
promoters to trumpet worthless HiEnergy, a heavily manipulated penny stock secretly
controlled by a convicted felon best known for his role in "The Mob on Wall Street."


Still pumping HiEnergy even with its suspected ties to the Mob already exposed, the head
of StockHouse - a promotional website that had named Primoris President Joseph
Carusone as its executive vice president of operations and Primoris Director Christos
Livadasas the president of its U.S. division - boldly predicted that the worthless stock
could explode into a triple-digit highflier with Primoris in charge of its publicity.


"I would expect HiEnergy to get a fair share of media attention,"StockHouse Founding
CEO Jeff Berwick declared after the company hired Primoris to orchastrate a major
publicity campaign. "I am familiar with the group they're using for their PR, and they are
very, very good at getting attention for companies like HiEnergy."


A total fraud in this particular case, HiEnergy soon attracted plenty of attention, all right --
from government authorities who cracked down on the company and those suspected of
using its stock as a vehicle for a blatant pump-and-dump scheme.

Bitter Pill


With Primoris in charge of its publicity, Anavex has managed to generate some rather
powerful hype of its own.


Anavex owes at least some of its newfound popularity to THE GLOWING REVIEWS
published by Kanak Kanti De, a so-called "doctor" who has developed a strong following
on financial websites like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool (where he ranks as a senior
healthcare contributor) by portraying himself as "a retired medical practitioner" with an
impressive "M.D." behind his name. Unless De rushed to pursue a second career in
medicine after serving as the chairman of IndoGenic Consultancy - a paid content provider
that caters to clients seeking favorable stock coverage - however, his credentials look
somewhat inflated, to say the very least. In the official bio that appeared on its website
less than five years ago, IndoGenic described De as "a veteran college principal (retired)
with a Ph.D. in English" - not a medical doctor - when the firm openly showcased his role
as the chairman of its board. [Editor's note: Kanak Kanti De's response can be seen
here.]


Not that Anavex has ever seemed overly worried about hanging out with the wrong sort of
crowd. If Anavex cared about its image, the company should have never even hired an
investor relations firm like Primoris - especially after it chose to appoint a director with
such a terrible track record -- in the first place.


Already blamed for some pretty major stock blowups before Primoris and StockWatch
eagerly welcomed him aboard, Livadas had originally "made a name for himself" by
publishing an Internet-based tout sheet that pumped all sorts of horrible penny stocks
headed for ruin.


Former Anavex CEO Harvey Lalach ought to know. By the time that he officially took over
as head of corporate communications for heavily promoted Goldtex Resources - just one
of many dubious microcap firms where he served as an officer and/or director before co-
founding Anavex and running the company for most of its life - Livadas had already spent
months relentlessly touting that worthless mining company in a campaign that would
ultimately leave bag-holders with some pretty deep scars.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3782676-anavex-regulatory-target-damaged-incriminating-evidence 5/75


"Mr. Livadas is best known for blowing up dozens of investors via his now-defunct
Internet newsletter known as the 'Central Investment Agency,'" one investor warned
years after Goldtex collapsed. "Dozens of mostly mining and oil/gas juniors were
highly touted, and prices were driven to high levels as a result of manipulation and
very thin public floats. In every case, they ended up in the recycle bin or trading for a
few pennies.


"Among the more high-profile names were Goldtex Resources (GXR.Alberta),
promoted to $14 in '96 - even though it had no producing properties - now renamed
Cantex Mining and trading at $0.16; Erin Ventures (EV.Alberta), $5 in '97 to a current
$0.12; and Everest Mining, which peaked at $3.50 and now trades on the VSE
(Vancouver Stock Exchange) at $0.04" a share.


Two of those stocks have continued to sink even lower - including the recycled version of
Goldtex, currently hovering around 5 cents a share - and the other one no longer appears
to trade any more at all.


Unhealthy Choices


Free to sail away from that painful mess, Livadas has since gone on to launch a new
yacht company with the help of the former Anavex executive (Xeroudakis) who previously
worked at Acrongenomics and oversaw the website for the obscure laboratory that both of
those companies just happened to choose. Good luck even trying to find that mysterious
lab these days. With the exception of its neglected website - stripped down to nothing
more than a canned image and a leftover logo - Euro Genet Labs has apparently
managed to vanish without a trace.


Anavex has employed a couple of other executives who must like to hang out with big-
name promoters, too. Before they vacated their positions to pursue new opportunities,
regulatory filings show, former Anavex Executive Chairman Cameron Durant and former
CFO David Tousley agreed to double as high-ranking officers at Oncbiomune
Pharmaceutical (OTC: OTCQB:OBMP) when their friend Mr. Carusone - the promoter who
founded Primoris after spending a couple of years in the StockHouse executive suite -
took over as vice president of investor relations at the obscure biotech company.


Even with that pair now gone, Anavex still needs to clean house if it wants the public to
forget about its dirty microcap roots. While Anavex may deserve some credit for replacing
Lalach with current CEO Christopher Missling - even if it hired him away from an
investment banking firm (Brimberg & Co.) that FINRA had just expelled - the company has

since followed up by selecting a CFO saddled with baggage that it conveniently (and
perhaps understandably) forgot to disclose. Prior to assuming her current post a couple of
months ago, her more forthcoming LinkedIn bio shows, Anavex CFO Sandra Boenish
spent two-and-a-half years serving as the vice president of finance at Naked Brand Group
(NASDAQ: OTCQB:NAKD), some obscure underwear company that alsorelied on a
reverse merger with a Nevada-based shell to go public on the penny-stock exchange.


Toxic Financing


Both hyped by paid stock promoters in orchestrated publicity campaigns, Anavex and
Naked Brand share another trait in common, too. Despite the painful consequences
suffered by so many other cash-strapped microcap companies, they elected to sign toxic
financing deals with Lincoln Park Capital shortly after Boenish arrived on the scene.


To be fair, Anavex had already inked a previous deal with LPC that - given the miserable
performance of its stock the following year (not to mention the collapse that Naked illness
had also suffered) - should have taught the company a lesson. Nevertheless, Anavex
decided to strike a new deal with LPC - and throw in a fresh pile of free stock as a
generous reward - even though the firm had apparently rushed to unload most of the
cheap and/or free stock that it had previously received from the bleeding company.


All told, figures in its regulatory filings indicate, Anavex had issued almost 5 million shares
of stock to LPC - with all but 70,000 of those shares already gone - when the company
rewarded the firm with a sweetheart deal that replenished its dwindling stock supply.
Anavex had just sold a big chunk of that stock to LPC over the summer, with the shares
rapidly doubling in price during the brief period when that stock could have changed
hands, so the firm must have already rushed to claim a pretty nice jackpot by the time that
it returned to the company for a fresh handout and a welcome opportunity to strike it rich
all over again.


Desperate Company


Unless Anavex felt awfully desperate, the company should have known better than to
even conduct business with a vulture financing firm that others tend to regard as a last
resort.


Take a typical LPC client like Galena Biopharma (NASDAQ: GALE), for example. Another
biotech stock that seemed to burst out of nowhere to take the market by storm, Galena
sparked so much Internet hype a couple of years ago that it rapidly tripled in price on that

bullish chatter alone. With paid stock promoters allegedly behind much of the so-called
"spam chatter" fueling that rally, however, Galena inevitably tanked once that powerful
hype faded away and stripped the stock of its artificial support.


Faced with a regulatory probe and limited financing options the following year, Galena
turned to LPC for help and - like Anavex itself - settled for the same kind of toxic funding
deal that had already left so many other desperate companies in even worse shape.


"Lincoln Park … has a reputation for financing troubled biotech companies - but at great
cost," veteran biotech reporter Adam Feuerstain cautioned his readers at the time. "What
does Lincoln Park do with the Galena stock it buys from the company at a discount? The
firm resells the stock right back into the market, making a profit on the difference in price
… Over time, existing shareholders of troubled biotech companies tend to be the biggest
losers when Lincoln Park gets involved."


Second Opinion


Around the same time that Anavex sold that mountain of cheap stock to LPC over the
summer, the company happened to win the loyal support of a popular new fan. One of the
most vocal promoters of Anavex by far, the infamous "Dr." De published his first article on
the company back in late July and has continued to trumpet the tiny biotechnology firm in
more than a dozen follow-up reports - including widely read interviews with a couple of
insiders - since that time.


While he released those particular articles on Seeking Alpha, where they reached a broad
audience of investors and attracted hundreds of comments, De also operates a website of
his own. Currently named after the doctor himself, drkkd.com features an IP address(listed
as 108.61.158.138 on IP Tracker) that (according to the Reverse IP Lookup feature)
previously belonged to a site called ContentCruise.com, which listed
indogeniclagal@gmail.com as its email address.


A subsidiary of Indogenic, the paid content provider that appointed De to serve as the
chairman of its board, StockRiters.com offers to develop far more elaborate stock publicity
campaigns. An imaginary figure packaged by the website as a prolific stock expert, "Ed
Liston" actually prepared an article about Anavex for SmallCapNetwork (yet another
promotional site) a few years before the stock started to attract any real attention.


The fictional Liston also shows up as a senior contributing editor at
TheStockMarketWatch.com, a website connected to one of the most recognized names in
the world of penny-stock promotion. The owner of that website (identified as its most

popular), Patriot Publishingrelies on some of the very same promoters that the Beacon
Equity group has claimed as members of its own team.


Stockguru.com, a promotional website founded by former Beacon Director John Pentony,
has touted Anavex so many times that itopenly brags about its "extensive coverage" of the
bleeding biotech company. When questioned by curious/suspicious investors about his
potential motives, Pentony insisted that Stockguru had provided all of that valuable
publicity about Anavex without collecting any sort of fee. He must have felt awfully
generous then, since his other firm (PennyIR.com) normally charges companies seeking
that sort of exposure.


Despite his more reputable appearance, De stopped well short of making the same kind of
reassuring claim. In fact, he has apparently decided to just keep his mouth shut. Asked to
disclose whether he has received any sort of compensation for his bullish coverage of
Anavex, De has so far responded to that simple request (emailed by this reporter more
than a full week ago) with deafening silence.


Believe it or not, after relentlessly gushing about Anavex for months, De may have just
delivered his most convincing message yet without even bothering to utter a word.


Painful Truth


Anavex never managed to fool legitimate biotech experts with more demanding standards.
When Anavex tried to brag about the "impressive" results of its dinky clinical trials, one of
the most seasoned reporters in the biotech arena immediately blasted the company for
trumpeting pointless results in a blatant effort to pump up its stock price.


"Anavex has already demonstrated a commitment to issuing press releases meaningless
to anyone but people day-trading their volatile stock," Adam Feuerstein warned his
followers on TheStreet.com a few weeks ago. "It will take a while, but the Anavex story is
likely to end just as badly as past small-cap Alzheimer stock blow-ups …


"This promotion has nothing to do with science."

Ain't AVXL grand? This is the short gift that keeps on giving. It was a longer deadcat bounce than I expected
but it looks like we're finally heading back to the 3's.


AVXL reminds me so much of ONVO; same promotional campaign of an OTC reverse-merger leading up to a
move onto a major exchange followed by a runup to 13 and then a long crash. Likewise it was sold to retail
punters because institutions were having none of it.

Karin,


She doesn't care. People who write tripe like this are shills, and they know full well what they are doing. I think
it gets them off. You know, gives them a little spotlight in their otherwise meaningless and trivial lives. They
could care less about truth and character. It's a personal deficiency of some sort.

I'm reminded of Warren Buffett's saying that when the tide goes out you can see who's been bathing without a
suit on. Overhyped over-inflated momentum stocks like AVXL can only thrive in a ZIRF environment of Fed
asset inflation. But as quickly as they zipped up under a massively expansive monetary policy they are going
to zip back down as liquidity is reduced. The smart(er) longs are waking up to this and taking their chips off
the table while those who live in the SA echo chamber of longs will find assurance they're in good company
even as accumulate more and more losses.


It's feel-good therapy inasmuch as it makes one feel better to be part of a like-minded group of investors but
it's really sucky therapy inasmuch as it keeps you complacent in the face of mounting losses.


06 Jan 2016, 05:22 PM


Mukticat
Looks like longs are going to need a lot more 'feel-good' therapy tomorrow. The Chinese stock market was
halted again tonight and current futures are pointing to another selloff in US markets tomorrow. Although
markets opened low today and stayed low AVXL only descended gradually into a rout meaning there was
ample opportunity to get out with minimal losses for those who acted early in the day.


Of course here in the echo chamber we don't need to sweat it cuz we all go down together. Kumbaya.

Today we find out that the biggest SA bull on AVXL, the 'Dr' Kanak Kante De has submitted a forged diploma
from the University of Calcutta as proof he's actually a doctor. This just gets curioser and curioser. Add that to
the well-known Agora stock promotion and the assorted OTC-swamp personnel associated with the company.


AVXL is well on its way to becoming a business school model for the textbook stock scam.


http://seekingalpha.co...

Mukticat
And today the fake Dr. KKD is terminated by SeekingAlpha-


http://bit.ly/1n8bx09


Another fraudster bites the dust! Who's next?


The laughable part has always been that the longs twist themselves into pretzels trying to deflect charges of
misrepresentations, lies, and hoaxes away from AVXL and their promoters, and onto vetted writers like AF
and genuine contributors like DrADKline.


No wonder the SEC and class-action lawyers are looking into AVXL.


Who knows maybe they'll get you some money back.

Agamemnus, Contributor
Personally, I find it curious that KKD decided to forge a diploma. What kind of (redacted) hospital would can
an oncology doctor (which is a very critical profession and in high demand) for simply writing articles of
companies that said doctor is interested in?


10 Jan 2016, 07:20 PM

agamemnus,


Hospitals and medical schools are very strict about conflicts of interest in their appointed staff.


A potential conflict-of-interest report has to be filed every year, and is very detailed about any remunerated
activities, and even includes investments in equities that are medical in nature.


I believe a doctor in the US appointed to a hospital or medical school would invite considerable scrutiny for a
paid blog, paid subscription, and ownership of stocks that they were writing about that fall in the
biotech/pharma area.


I don't know for sure that they would be terminated--they might just be asked to stop. Or a committee could
say it was OK. Someone who had concealed such conflicts of interest, though, might find themselves in more
trouble.


Hospitals/medical schools are so strict because the opportunities for conflicts of interest are so great and the
problem certainly does occur.


Hope this helps.


10 Jan 2016, 07:34 PM


Agamemnus, Contributor
If KKD is really an oncology dr., writing about Alzheimer's doesn't sound like a conflict of interest to me,
though.


11 Jan 2016, 01:54 AM


an10
Writing about alzheimer's certainly would not be a conflict of interest for an oncology physician, or any
physician.


Writing about stocks in the medical arena for pay probably would be a conflict of interest for an oncology
physician, or any physician. Profiting from his writing on pharma/biotech stocks probably would be a conflict
of interest.


I am not sure that some people on this thread realize that physicians are held to a high standard of
ethics/conduct. That's true in the US, and I would think it is true in India also.

Just keeping the record straight,I have no position in Anavex,but their AD drug in trials has not been proven
effective yet or if ever since it has not completed p1/2 or even close to beginning a p3 that would take several
years to enroll,record data and report to FDA...at least 4-5 years to be proven effective or not...just saying. 
All this other disheartening information regarding possible underhanded business practices and pump and
dump advertising campaigns by shady business people won't help prove if Anavex has a real AD drug or not. 
GL to all.

red herring is something that misleads or distracts from a relevant or important issue.[1] It may be either a
logical fallacy or a literary device that leads readers or audiences towards a false conclusion." I could not
agree more.

Nothing in your article relates to when Missling took over to the present date. Also LPC deal was in Anavex's favor
and mitigated dilution. See below straight from the 10K. This gives me confidence in the new deal.


On July 5, 2013, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “$10 Million Purchase Agreement”) with
Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”). Pursuant to the $10 Million Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park
initially purchased 250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for $100,000 and the Company had the right, in
its sole discretion over a 25-month period, to sell to Lincoln Park up to the additional aggregate commitment of $9.9
Million of shares of common stock. There were no upper limits on the per share price that Lincoln Park could be
required to pay to purchase such common stock. Furthermore, the Company controlled the timing and amount of
sales of shares of common stock to Lincoln Park except that, pursuant to the terms of the $10 Million Purchase
Agreement, we were unable to sell shares to Lincoln Park if and when the closing sale price of our common stock was
below $2 per share, subject to adjustment as set forth in the $10 Million Purchase Agreement. Lincoln Park had no
right to require any sales and was obligated to purchase common stock as directed by the Company.


During the year ended September 30, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 1,852,144 shares of common stock under the
$10 Million Purchase Agreement, including 1,825,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$8,127,265 and 27,144 commitment shares. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, we issued to Lincoln Park an
aggregate of 296,104 shares of common stock under the $10 Million Purchase Agreement, including 290,523 shares
of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,684,565 and 5,581 commitment shares, representing all
remaining purchase amounts due under the $10 Million Purchase Agreement.

price is calculated. I don't have it in front of me but the price LP pays is something like the lower of today's
price or the average of the last 10 trading days, or something like that. Just so you know. Of course the
company can pick that period to its best advantage, but its not quite as good as it sounds. I think if some
shares had been sold to Lincoln park recently they'd have gotten better than $6 for them (by the formula) and
that would be the most favorable financing the company has done. The fact that the company has not tapped
any of this after 3 months confirms to me it's to be used as leverage that the company could go it on their own
when negotiating a partnering deal, to get a better deal. Also may indicate that the 12 week results to be
reported in January may drive the shares higher so why finance at current prices when they could be higher
by the end of January. I am long and a big supporter, but don't want to see people misinformed.

30 Dec 2015, 10:08 AM


Bman49ers
The first paragraph is mine and the second two paragraphs come straight from the 10k. This was the first
LPC deal executed in the middle of 2013. This deal is currently closed as AVXL used up the $10M in funding
at an average of $4.56 a share. They used this Purchase agreement fairly strategically as this avg. share
price is 1.14 pre-split. That is great considering they hit a low of .15.


30 Dec 2015, 10:11 AM

It means they have sold no shares to Lincoln park since 9/30. And at their discretion they might but they don't
need the cash right now.

Scrying Biotech, Contributor
Actually, Doug, I'm interested in many stocks that suffer from questionable past practices. As you know, I've
made a good deal of money on equities that others have abandoned in favor of greener pastures - Amarin,
CytRx and Ocata to name a few.


The reasons for this are quite simple really. Humans are fallible. And because developmental biotech is a
sector predicated upon promise and not substance, I find people walking away from equities that I'm happy to
walk towards when the timing is right.


I've traded in and out of the 3 companies I mentioned above and have a published track record to prove my
timing is mostly right. I follow a stock Karin covered closely - Cellceutix (CTIX) which suffered from the same
ideational short attack but have yet to take out a position. Still, the story captivates me.


I'll follow this equity now if only to see how things turn out. Are biotechs that engage in stock promotion
always bad eggs? Are biotechs that engage in insider selling, repetitive public offerings, and stock purchase
and sales agreements not worthy of our investment dollars? We'll find out. And that's why I'm interested.


Take care...

CTIX is also interesting to me. Have you had a look at Tigenix Sa (TGXSF) covered here on SA? Also

I don't know how I could miss TiGenix when that one SA contributor deluged our Ocata articles with info on
the company. That said, I don't place it in the category of maligned stocks in any way other than the usual
political, economic and religious prejudice imposed upon stem cell therapies and the companies that sponsor
them.

DWD Investing, Contributor
Micheal,


You mean Zac, the PhD?


"TiGenix (OTC:TGXSF) -- listed on Euronext Brussels -- is a leading but little known Belgian cell therapy
biotech with an advanced adipose-derived allogeneic stem cell product. . ."


Yeah that got my attention some time ago, but I didn't act on it. Even with success, it's multiple isn't huge. I
mean possible 150% upside if all goes well. If I had extra cash, I might toss in 4-5K shares of it. They are
going to up-list soon to NASDAQ and will probably see a pop. At 150% upside, I think our NAVB pick is a
better risk to reward ratio. But both would be better if one could cover them both.


What do you think? PM me if you want.

You are assigning too much importance to the grant. Foundation grants are nice but really have no bearing for
future success. The grants are reviewed by MD and PhD reviewers so total BS is not funded but they don't
have a crystal ball. The government still sponsors far more research through the NIH.


Michael J Fox foundation is a great and ethical organization. They spend a large percent of their donations on
research. Over the past 15 years, they have sponsored many projects, currently sponsoring about 90 a year.
Getting a grant is great for the company as it is 'free money'....no dilution of equity and no future claims.
However, getting a grant has no correlation with success. The majority (vast majority) of their sponsored
research will not lead to a successful drug but will still hopefully advance the PD world. MJFF goal is to
sponsor a variety of research. Sigma receptors is one of dozens of mechanisms. Most of their grants are to
academic researchers but they also sponsor private company research. I found their summary in the
database but not the amount of $$$. Given typical awards, likely 300-500,000.


So, for a 6.00 dollar company with a market cap of 160 MM, this is worth 0.02 to 0.06 depending on size of
grant.

Peer reviewed independent research to be published:


NEW YORK, NY – November 30, 2015 – Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (“Anavex” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: AVXL),
a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing drug candidates to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD), other
central nervous system (CNS) diseases, pain and various types of cancer, announced today the publication of further
data for ANAVEX 3-71 (formerly AF710B) in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Neurodegenerative Diseases. The
ANAVEX 3-71 data provides evidence for a positive, more upstream effect on reducing synaptic loss, amyloid and tau
pathologies, and neuroinflammation, which is potentially beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer’s and other
neurological diseases. ANAVEX 3-71 is part of the Company’s pipeline including ANAVEX 2-73 targeting sigma-1 and
muscarinic receptors.

I'm a little confused here. I don't understand how the editors allowed you to malign the character Kanak Kanti De
through inference and innuendo. Though no fan of his, and lesser fan still of assigning the term "premium contributor"
to authors only by virtue of their participation in the Marketplace, I nonetheless find this indefensible. Because
someone chooses not to respond to your inquiry does not then prove them to be guilty of your accusation just as
noting compliance with an SEC investigation does not automatically infer that the admitting party is the subject of that
inquiry or guilty in any way.


If, in fact, this investigation is about short manipulation of the stock by outside sources, you Miss Davis, may have
unwittingly fallen into a trap. I hope this isn't so.

"If, in fact, this investigation is about short manipulation of the stock by outside sources, you Miss Davis, may
have unwittingly fallen into a trap. I hope this isn't so."


from the Wiki: 
"A subpoena /səˈpiːnə/ (also subpœna) is a writ issued by a government agency, most often a court, to
compel testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure. "


so. in order for this subpoena, compelling "testimony" from AVXL, to be about AVXL's assault by shorts would
have to mean: 
1) AVXL didn't ask for the inquiry for some reason

cucumberbatch, I'm relieved to not be the only amateur biotech investor/do-it-yourself investor and lawyer that
relies on wikipedia to understand the nomenclature of medicine and law but your conclusions drawn from
source are a bit simplistic, aren't they?


Have you heard the expression "hostile witness"?


from the wiki: 
"A hostile witness, otherwise known as an adverse witness or an unfavorable witness, is a witness at trial
whose testimony on direct examination is either openly antagonistic or appears to be contrary to the legal
position of the party who called the witness."


In other words, the government might conclude in advance of formal proceedings that AVXL executives might
be reticent to testify openly about all concerned parties and thereby issue a subpoena compelling them to do
so.


I could think of many other possible motivations for the utility of that tool but the fog of waking hasn't yet lifted.


And finally, to all others, this, yet again, reminds me of the latitude given to short writers to be one-sided. I
was asked recently not to compare my focused strategy of small to nano-cap investing with Bret Jensen's
"shotgun" approach because it sounded critical of Bret (it wasn't) and yet, this depiction of Kanak isn't critical
and is allowed?


I don't think I want to be involved in stock analysis on this platform anymore as I truly don't understand the
methods to measure not only issues of collegiality, but of balance, or the complete absence thereof.


30 Dec 2015, 03:04 PM

If AVXL or it's officers or directors were under investigation by the SEC it would not have been a subpoena
but rather a search warrant. It being a subpoena means that the SEC wants to use the information in the
investigation of another person or entity. By connecting the dots one could surmise with high-probability that it
is about an expanding investigation of a criminal enterprise that Martin Shkreli is involved with. So the
investigation is most likely the short selling activities of Martin Shkreli and co-conspirators in AVXL stock.
Subpoenas are very routine and mostly used in cases like this to obtain records. This subpoena was close in

The Securities & Exchange Commission temporarily halted trading in shares of GrowLife, which trade under

been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of information in the marketplace and potentially manipulative
transactions in PHOT’s common stock.”

As the current editor in chief of a scientific journal and the former editor in chief of the leading journal in my
field, I can tell you that editorial board members' manuscript submissions are always welcomed and are peer
reviewed anonymously and accepted or rejected without any influence by the authors. There is no conflict of
interest here, and CoI's are avoided by policy and long-established practice. Editorial board members who are
authors are treated the same as any other author. To suggest otherwise is to fail to understanding scientific
publishing and to impugn the integrity of a prominent scientist and the publisher of a solid journal. Prominent
scientists serve on multiple editorial boards and it is an indication of their high value to the scientific
community. Write to the editor-in-chief of the journal if you have a concern and wish to file a complaint.


May I ask who peer reviews and accepts or rejects your articles prior to publication and do they have conflicts
of interest?

DrADKline
General activation of muscarinic receptors causes classical "cholinergic" side effects (sweating, salivation,
gastrointestinal distress). These are unacceptable for long-term use in an Alzheimer's patient population.


Originally it was thought that the side effects were due to targeting the M2 or M3 subtypes of the receptor.
Hence companies began looking for M1 subtype specific drugs. In particular, specific drugs which improve M1
activation rather than directly causing it (modulators). Anavex 3-71 is such a drug.


Bristol-Myers Squibb have, however, now reported data (http://bit.ly/1NipfUc) which whilst perhaps known
within the field, has not to my knowledge previously been made public. These indicate that even M1 specific
drugs of the same type as Anavex 3-71 cause cholinergic side effects. This is a very significant, possibly
insurmountable, problem for the future development of the drug.


With regards to the additional sigma receptor agonism activity of Anavex 3-71, this is unrelated to, and does
not in any way protect against, side effects due to muscarinic receptor activation.

The old all cars are the same phenomenon. Which as a responsible scientist you know full well does not
apply to receptors as we are in our infancy in understanding and mapping them out.

How do you know if this is 3-71? They don't give you the chemical composition at anavex and they don't
name it in the study. All it discusses is isolated M1 activation in animal models leads to toxicity. Since these
molecules have multiple effects at multiple receptor sites in combination, including calcium channels, all
muscarinic receptors and have been shown to be well tolerated in humans, what are you talking about? I read
the study and have the background to do so.


30 Dec 2015, 05:52 PM


DrADKline
The effects BMS discuss in their paper (http://bit.ly/1NipfUc) are mechanistic, class effects - applicable to ALL
molecules with that mechanism of action.


Anavex 3-71 ( a potent, selective M1 allosteric modulator) has not entered human clinical trials and has NOT
been shown to be well tolerated in humans. I very much doubt it will be.


Anavex 2-73 is a classical muscarinic agonist, but is so weak that it is very unlikely that it is active in the brain
against muscarinic receptors at the doses given. If it was, it would cause the side effects stated.


Muscarinic agonists are the most obvious alternative to donepezil. This is why they have been so actively
pursued. The entire field knows that general muscarinic agonism is not tolerable in an Alzheimer's patient
population. Hence the search for M1 specific drugs. It may surprise you to know that pharma have been
working on this for well over a decade pre-clinically. BMS are the first to publish the reasons why this has not
been a successful strategy.


I can't put it any simpler. Maybe that's my failing.

Muscarinic receptors are damaged in Alzheimer's disease by oxidation.


http://tinyurl.com/zxf...


This is likely why none of the side effects associated or potentially associated with activation of various
muscarinic receptors were seen in the clinical trial with Anavex 2-73.


To the extent that Anavex 2-73 reverses the oxidation of muscarinic receptors, it could contribute to
improvements in short-term memory in people with Alzheimer's disease.


30 Dec 2015, 06:25 PM

So you are saying that 2-73 fits the bill for success because weak M1, well tolerated, and so far excellent
clinical effects. Actually because those receptors are damaged by oxidation in ALZ, and 2-73 mitigates
oxidation and inflammatory cascades, maybe it is normalizing those very receptors as its mechanism of
action therefore restoring receptors and "reversing" disease because that is sure what it looks like it is doing
clinically.

DrADKline
I'm saying that 2-73 doesn't meaningfully engage muscarinic receptors in the brain at the doses given. If it
did, it would cause the relevant side effects - which haven't been seen in either healthy volunteers or the
Ph2a cohort.


Many companies have tried, and failed, to separate the pro-cognitive effects of muscarinic agonists from
toxicity through dosing regimens (or using weaker agonists like 2-73). It doesn't work, the effects aren't
separable. This is why so much highly costly effort has been expended on trying to develop M1-specific
drugs.


As for the Anavex P2a clinical data to date, they support conclusions either way. It is equally valid to
hypothesise that the drug does nothing (http://bit.ly/20Gu8zN), as it is to take the Anavex view. You may
disagree, but the fact that I can state, and support such an opinion, indicates that we are still way too early in
this process for the data to be definitive. A controlled efficacy trial is required. Until data is available from that,
the jury is out.

Wow you wasted so much of your time researching the company's ancient history and desperately trying to find every
unsavory link possible, no matter how distant, which you then research to an incredible degree as if this reflects the
company today under Dr. Missling's leadership, which I believe represents a legitimate break from that history (which
clearly was not working for the company) and a fresh start.


(By the way, Anavex has not tapped the second Lincoln Park Financing which is there as leverage in negotiations with
pharma partners who might otherwise think the Company has no other choice then to take a partnering deal they are
offering because the Company can get a better partnering deal with a financing option for up to $50 million dollars
behind them to potentially, alternatively go it alone.


You totally skip/ignore the science, encouraging results to date and the world class people that Dr. Missling and its
pipeline have attracted to its Scientific Advisory Board. Shame on you. What an embarrassingly one-sided hatchet
job. Wow the hedge funds must have paid you a bundle for all that (useless) research (into ancient irrelevant history).
I must congratulate you though on being the winner of this year's Greatest Manipulator of Ancient History and also

do u not see the other side of ur argument? Shouldnt pumping a company with basically ZERO experience,
no products, no cash flow, just an empty promise years away if the miracle does happen, be just as bad??? 
its called healthy skepticism...


If ur knew to biotech this should be a good lesson for u...


LISTEN to both sides of the story. Longs keep pointing to the 'science'..THERE IS NO SCIENCE YET!!!! If
there is something there it will take millions upon millions--stock offerings, more deals with LP--and years to
get it through even with a fast track fda designation..


You have history to look through... Just take a couple of hours and sift through the graveyard of failed
biotechs. BIG time m, multi billion dollar corps have not been able to do much for alzheimers for the last
decade. Yet longs beleive a company with so many shady coincidences will revolutionize the industry...


When u go out and buy something or eat somewhere, dont u pay attention to people who have been there
and are giving u advice since they have been there already? Dont u look up reliability of a new car and its
manufacturer?? If u like chipotle, do u not listen to the ecoli stories or do u juust blindly believe in it because
ur money is involved???


Its an emotional attention u guys have and ur brains cannot allow u to admit to urselves tht maybe just maybe
u are being scammed. So u guys argue with people who have covered 100s if not 1000s of these biotechs
and tout a basic Phase 1 pre trial with no control arm???


The patent was sold to the company by the same people tht are involved in it.. It initially was sold off by a big
time pharma to the guy tht then brought it to avl... Why would a big time pharma sell a potential life saver for
100 million seniors for pennies after investing millions???


I mean come on, this is the stock market, wall street... How can u be so reckless and firm on ur position in the
face of legitimate concerns..??


Then again, if ur new to trading i totallt understand,, ive been there, ive been a bag holder, i believed hype
and promotions... Ask anyone who is succesful in the long term at trading and they will tell u the same thing---
be skeptical!

s4b - What are your scientific credentials upon which you claim "there is no science"? Why are you hiding
behind a veil of anonymity?


I've read the pre-clinical literature on these receptors and these compounds. I have a PhD in Biochemistry
and have been a research molecular geneticist for 37 years post-PhD, retired as Professor with an Endowed
Chair in Excellence in Agriculture and Life Sciences form Univ of Arizona. My assessment is that the pre-
clinical results are very intriguing and the science is solid.


This is a speculative risky stock, no question about it; I bought many of my shares a year ago and again last
spring and summer, based on my reading of the published research. The clinical results are preliminary but
seem encouraging. Disclaimer: I'm not an MD nor do I have experience in pharma or clinical trials.

At this point, what really matters is the phase II/III results. Speculating about those results is just that,
speculation. Everyone can form their own informed opinion of what they might be, but no one knows what the
outcome will be.


If you want to criticize the pre-clinical science, then tell us specifically what your concerns are. Otherwise, you
have no credibility - you're just spouting ignorance. Prove otherwise by stating your credentials.


I won't address the charges against management other than to say that nearly all of what the author writes
about is rather old news. I care about the upcoming clinical trial results. Everything else looks like the shorts
are trying to manipulate the stock, exactly what they accuse the company of. The SEC will determine which it
is, or neither, or both. I look forward to the results of the investigation.

Jean Fonteneau, Contributor
Since you are asking people for evidence of this and evidence of that, what evidence do you have that there
was "huge naked shorting" and "coordinated hit piece"?


Given the preceding price action and the release of data on 11/09 seems obvious that Anavex would receive
more coverage. 
I started researching Anavex the prior week and started posting and recommending people sell Anavex on
November 4 when it was at $13+ http://bit.ly/1Opgegh 
After researching it further I decided to put together all the findings in one article over the next weekend that I
would have published regardless of the data release or not. 
Adam Feuerstein published an article on Anavex on 11/09 following the data release that weekend, if it wasn't
for the trial data I am going to assume he would not have written an article.


And as for "hit" pieces and the "same people each time" , all the facts I have put forward in my article I have
thorougly researched and made sure to back them by evidence, and it's the first time I write a bearish article
on a controversial biotech company.


Once again if you have evidence of "huge naked shorting" and coordinated attacks, please bring them
forward.

"This is not the place to question his credentials "


it certainly is. De only claims "medical practitioner" on the many other profiles he has out there, not "medical
**doctor**". it's his obligation to support that statement. he could be a nurse, herbalist, homeopath, and so on
and be a "medical practitioner" for some definition of "practitioner". all authors who make claims of
background/training/ex... have the obligation of prior proof. most do, from my readings. even the hated AF.

You are speculating. Provide the evidence. Otherwise, you are unethical.

1. lacking moral principles; unwilling to adhere to proper rules of conduct. 
2. not in accord with the standards of a profession

It is also interesting that his Linkedin page lists only his PhD under "education": http://tinyurl.com/zr4...


Also, the MBBS and MD degrees are essentially equivalent...not sure why he'd have/list both.

Dr. De's MBBS degree is from an excellent university, but it is a bachelor's degree and in no way equivalent to
an MD, which is a doctorate. He states that he does also have an MD degree and will supply confirmation on
his return from travels. Whatever his credentials, I have appreciated his biotech insights and his writing style,
and I hope the controversy over his credentials can be laid to rest.

I trust you read the last sentence? In the US the equivalent is called an MD, meaning Doctorate. This is a

I assume you mean to question whether or not he has completed his medical residency training program and,
if applicable, fellowship residency and any specialty training programs that would result in his applying for a
Medical License, during some of that training he must have the license beforehand, which then assures he is
a Medical Doctor?

The claim--or strong innuendo (reading carefully I'm not sure which it is)--by the author that KKD does not have an
MD seems to me to be a potentially serious one (and I feel it also might impugn SA, since he is a premium
contributor.) (If KKD also has a PhD in English, I think that is a strength, not a cause for concern!)


I wonder if SA or KKD would provide the name of the medical school where KKD received his MD, and his year of
graduation. That would go a long way toward setting these allegations to rest.


Does SA need to issue some sort of editorial comment, given the extreme nature of the allegations in this article?

Let's see a copy of the SEC text that addresses allegations of misconduct against market manipulators who
are not associated with the company. When investigating such concerns, the SEC is obliged to look at all
questionable trades, including by persons associated with the company, but not only persons associated with
the company. Please quote the _complete_ relevant SEC text, not merely the self-serving portion.

DWD Investing, Contributor
Well, supporting Adam Feuerstein as a source was funny.


"CREW’s letter to the SEC also notes similar suspicious timing related to Mr. Feuerstein’s reporting on drug
companies GTx and Mannkind. As GTx’s stock reached near-record levels in July 2013, Mr. Feuerstein published an
article predicting the failure of a critical drug trial, citing an unnamed short seller as a source. Mr. Feuerstein refused
to correct the multiple errors in his article despite a point-by-point refutation by a GTx investor posted on
seekingalpha.com. Similarly, in March 2014, Mr. Feuerstein published an article predicting a 60-percent chance the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would reject the company’s new drug, Afrezza. By the end of the day,
Mannkind’s shares were trading at a 10-month low. Contrary to Mr. Feurstein’s prognostication, on April 1, an FDA
advisory committee granted marketing approval for Afreeza by a vote of 13 to 1." http://exposeadam.com


That said, it is interesting to see the relationship between De and others.


"Anavex owes at least some of its newfound popularity to the glowing reviews published by Kanak Kanti De, a so-
called "doctor" who has developed a strong following on financial websites like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool
(where he ranks as a senior healthcare contributor) by portraying himself as "a retired medical practitioner" with an
impressive "M.D." behind his name. Unless De rushed to pursue a second career in medicine after serving as the
chairman of IndoGenic Consultancy - a paid content provider that caters to clients seeking favorable stock coverage -
however, his credentials look somewhat inflated, to say the very least. In the official bio that appeared on its website
less than five years ago, IndoGenic described De as "a veteran college principal (retired) with a Ph.D. in English" - not
a medical doctor - when the firm openly showcased his role as the chairman of its board."


Unless Kanti De can clarify this, he is off my follow list.


I have no positions in the stock here mentioned.


30 Dec 2015, 02:46 PM


DWD Investing, Contributor
I think I found clarification on this above, as a commenters said he posted a picture of his MD, which is called

Regarding 10-K annual report published yesterday, interestingly what caught the eye of most was not the continuous
hemorrage of shareholders dollars, but the fact that the company was forced to disclose that it is under formal
investigation by the SEC(so apparently some people at the SEC seem to also think that there are quite a few red flags
surrounding Anavex).


An SEC investigation that the company decided not to disclose when it became aware of it but decided to bury it in a
note at the bottom of the 10-K report...


But aside from the SEC investigation what the latest 10-K report reinforced is a company with virtually no assets (after
9 years as a public company and having spent $64 million of shareholders money!), expensing more money on SG&A
expenses than R&D, which is shocking for a development stage biotechnology upstart, and also more on CEO
compensation than on R&D... I don't think I have ever seen either in development stage biotechnology companies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3782676-anavex-regulatory-target-damaged-incriminating-evidence 50/75


Almost $5 million in SG&A expenses for 2015 is a surprisingly high level of spending by any standard for a company
that for most of the year had no more than 4 employees and a small office...


Now to come back to the SEC investigation, Anavex states that: 
"The Company believes(!?) the subpoena and investigation relate to the recent unusual activity in the market for the
Company’s shares."


While no insider has filed share sales, as indicated in the 10-K filing on p. 22, Anavex has sold roughly $10 million
worth of stocks to retail investors via Lincoln Park Capital arrangement in 2015, most of these stock sales took place
during the Summer and Fall while the stock was heavily promoted via PR, various articles mentioning Anavex and a
"cure for Alzheimer", and "third-party" paid promotions.


From 10-K:  
"During the year ended September 30, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 1,852,144 shares of common stock under
the $10 Million Purchase Agreement, including 1,825,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$8,127,265 and 27,144 commitment shares. Subsequent to September 30, 2015, we issued to Lincoln Park an
aggregate of 296,104 shares of common stock under the $10 Million Purchase Agreement, including 290,523 shares
of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,684,565 and 5,581 commitment shares, representing all
remaining purchase amounts due under the $10 Million Purchase Agreement."


It is likely that it is in the circumstances of these transactions and how the share price was inflated during that period
that the SEC has an interest in. 
(Anyone trying to portray an SEC investigation as a non-event is either delusional or intentionally misleading)


30 Dec 2015, 08:56 PM


Jean Fonteneau, Contributor
Now the simple reality of Anavex remains:


- AVXL acquired some patents for a small sum and has had the same Anavex 2-73 (supposedly "the most
promising Alzheimer drug candidate out there"...) in its hands since at least 2007. 
- Since that time AVXL has taken $74 million of investors money(if one look at latest balance sheet filed) and
spent 80% of it.


- Yet all we have in almost 9 years is:


- 1 small Ph1 safety trials run by a contract research organization in Germany in 2011 with 16 patients.


- 1 small Ph2 trial with 32 patients entitled "Exploratory Efficacy Study" (that now everybody claims was only
to evaluate safety?...)  
http://1.usa.gov/1ISsfVy


- But we have had in the meantime 177 promotional Press Releases put out by the company touting great
progress.


(Here http://prn.to/1ISsdwP it is posited that Phase1 trials cost an average of $15,700 per patient and Phase2
$19,300 per patient. 
16 p x $16K + 32 p x $20K = $896,000)

What is this company really doing aside from releasing promotional PRs and filing shares to sell?


Where is the money going? Where did the money go?


I understand that there are a lot of administrative and other expenses but $74 million is a very large amount of
money especially for a company that never had more than a handful of employees.

Another reminder of the number of troubling facts surrounding Anavex and the people that have been
involved with the company.


Thank you to the author for expounding further a number of the points that I also raised in my article in
November notably the previous association with questionnable ventures of people involved with Anavex. For
the up todate version of that article: http://tinyurl.com/nh3...


Once again regardless of one's opinion on the "science" behind Anavex drug candidates all these facts are
troubling to put it mildly, and claiming that one should disregard, in the name of the prospects of the "science",
the manner in which Anavex is and has been conducting its affairs while evaluating the value of an
investment in Anavex is preposterous.


Also while the "science" is evidently crucial, it takes a lot more than just the science to push a drug through all
phases of trial/approval and get it to market. And as for the science it appears "controversial" at best.  
(Just in case, controversy: a number of people seem to think it holds some promises and a number of people
thinks it has very little chances of showing efficacy and is bound to fail.) 
Even if I were to put aside all the "red flags", when I look at Anavex track record and assets(tangible,
intangible, financial & human) I see very little chance of Anavex ever bringing anything to market.


I have seen people commenting on Dr Fischer's work I recommend they look up his involvement in another
venture in 2006, Torreypine Therapeutics, making similar claims as Anavex of promising result in reversing
AZH, disease modification etc... http://tinyurl.com/zz6...  
Problem is it doesn't look like that worked(except for rats) because TPTX Torreypines Therapeutics went to
$0, zero.  
And even though billions are spent every year by Biogen, Lilly and others on AD doesn't look like anybody
else was interested in pursuing the matter.. 
.  
I have also seen some pointing out the "Buy" recommendation reiterated by Maxim with a $15 PT, regarding
that it's useful to keep in mind that Maxim: makes a market in AVXL shares, has been paid by Anavex and
OWNS Anavex shares and warrants. As can be seen in their disclaimer here: http://tinyurl.com/omh... 
So I don't think anyone should rely on them for objective and unbiased advice (leaving aside the fact that
Maxim analyst has a horrendous track record and is ranked in the bottom 0.5% of all analysts.)


Concerning Mr KKD I am not going to comment on his credentials as I tend to take people at face value and
don't think the title and tags they carry or not should necessarily credit or discredit the analysis they put
forward.  
On the other hand it is a bit troubling to see the potential association with a stock analysis for hire outfit given

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3782676-anavex-regulatory-target-damaged-incriminating-evidence 52/75


the history of paid promotions around AVXL and the zeal with which De has covered Anavex, publishing no
less than 12 articles on Anavex in a few months, a microcap with a checkered track record and questionable
science receiving more coverage than any other biotechnology stock out there?...


PS:  
One fun fact concerning OncBioMune OBMP mentionned in the article, a preposterous venture being
prepped for a new promo campaign.  
Until this Fall when it decided to all of a sudden become a breakthrough biotechnology company and change
their name, OBMP was a digital media company named "Quint Media". And if one looks at this client roster of
the Canadian IR firm Primoris Group that handles Anavex IR look who you can find there...:
http://tinyurl.com/z72...


(By the way if things have changed at Anavex I can't figure out why they would still retain the services of
Primoris Group...)

Agamemnus, Contributor
I did write to you earlier about that sum. A large part of the expense was due to cheap warrants iirc. When
they are exercised and strike is under market price, Anavex counted it as a cost.


31 Dec 2015, 01:46 PM

I certainly agree with the primoris association. But the reason this is receiving more coverage than anything
else out there is the science. Although ridiculously early, the timing is what it is. Phase 2A is where they are.
Not sure I agree with you on the idea that science doesn't trump. It does and is the lifeblood of all baby
biotechs. if the science works, this will be the investment of a lifetime, and if not it will go to zero. but that is all
baby biotechs. Not just anavex. Sometimes in the moment of greatest fear, one must have faith. If the
mechanism holds and it decreases inflammatory cascades, decreases oxidative damage, much like advil or
statins. All of a sudden the body can repair M1 which is damaged in alzheimers. Everybody is trying to
develop a M1 agonist but that causes cholinergic toxicity as has been proven. So how about a weak M1
affinity but that filters the proteins and free radicals that likely cause Alz. Maybe patients are waking up
because the M1 receptor is being "unclogged" now appropriately upregulated and repaired, not because it is
being artificially stimulated. The simplicity and transformative nature of the mechanism and science is why as
a physician scientist I believe. Because quite simply it makes perfect sense.

Alientrader -  
You have a frightening perspective of scientific research to say the least.  
And I quote you below: 
" What is wrong with you people? Really think this company is going to find something of value that has
eluded yes of research by many hundreds of quality well funded companies? You have no way to know if
there is anything real here, it is a pure speculation."


Your comment reminds of the archaic belief that the world was flat so why bother sailing. That same
ignorance thought Galileo was a crazy heretic. Maybe Vivien Thomas' (Johns Hopkins University)
intelligence, dream and passion to become a doctor would have not impressed Dr. Blalock so much that "Blue
Babies" would still be dying today! I doubt Jonas Salk sat around looking to others for a way to stop polio but
instead dared to find a cure himself! Dr. Philip Emeagwali would have never thought to invent the worlds
fastest computer and what we now know to be the "internet". If true intelligence were measured by statements
like and the lack of trying why not just sit on a couch and watch TV all day? Maybe people should not go to
hospitals when they are sick because it's just "pure speculation" on what they may have or the medicine that
can treat it. Any by the way, just because "companies" have been well funded does not mean anything. You
don't need tons of money to have an idea that something else can be tried. We need
people/doctors/researc... who will think "out of the box" and the current Anavex researchers and scientists
have and are doing just that. With my 20+ years of educating minds to the wonders of chemistry and
biology...I believe in the science as I understand it as well as the dedicated and masterful scientists
associated with Anavex.

Over 85-90% of biotechs therapies (drugs) fail. I don't know what the rate is for individual startup IPO
companies, but the point is, HIGHLY likely to fail--no matter where their money comes from.


I think a more accurate theory would be that statistically speaking, the instant a biotech company files it's IPO,
its a sign of future failure.


You feel me?

"Over 85-90% of biotechs therapies (drugs) fail."


of more concern for folks looking at LPC funded companies, and teeny cap bio generally: does the company
manage itself to fail fast, or fail late? does the company try to weed out loosers with rigorous PI and PII trials?
does the company always manage to find "strong indications of efficacy" in sub-groups and the like when PI
and PII tank? is there always some reason to pursue PIII when the PII results aren't exceptionally good? and
so forth.

DWD you know that there are countless companies out there that have seen their stock crushed after deals
with LP, GALE AMBS just 2 examples off the top of my head.


But more importantly, especially with the staggering amount of money that has flowed into the biotechnology
sector the last 5 years truly promising science has no problem finding funding or backing and maybe the
ventures whose only recourse is dilutive toxic deals with LPC are the ventures that should not survive in the
first place because they DON'T have promising science or potential to bring anything to market.  
Institutional investors in the public and private market in the biotechnology sector have currently more money
than places to put it.

not exactly a homerun or what I would call a successful investment...)

Jean Fonteneau,


Where in the world have you been in the past year? It's been increasingly difficult for small-cap biotechs to
access funds due, in part, to falling capitalizations in a torrid political climate. Several stocks that I've followed,
and profited from, have turned to stock purchase and sales agreements to fund their operations. Novavax had
a renewable and revolving agreement with MLV (considered one of the worst operators in equity banking) and
this while it had the RSV vaccine (considered a potential blockbuster) in Phase-2 development.


Trevena, a now successful late-stage company that no one believed in (but me), had a stock purchase and
sales agreement with Cowen and Co. for $50M that has since been renewed despite a successful readout of
their Oliceridine Phase-2b abdominoplasty trial and the concomitant execution of a public offering which has
the company's coffers bulging through 2017. They've done this as an insurance policy against likely
downward pressure on the sector due to bad players and vulture pricing of therapeutics.


Ocata Therapeutics had a stock purchase and sales agreement with Lincoln Park because the larger
investment community is still tilted by religious prejudice and political pressures against cell therapy
development. Thank heaven LP was there to help them limp towards a recent buyout at an 80% premium to
the previous day's closing price.

NVAX, OCAT/ACTC interesting choices.


NVAX originated as a production platform to revolutionize vaccine production: its Virus Like Particle. I had
some for a nonce years ago. it got nowhere, just because vaccine companies were content with egg process.
and they were content because the only advantage to vaccine makers would be, if it all worked out, that VLP
production would be faster. vaccine production is rarely time sensitive. no one cared. so NVAX morphed into a
vaccine maker. I don't get the justification for the MC.


OCAT has, to be kind, a checkered history. the "premium" is only so if one looks at the share with very short-
term glasses. for those who bought more than a few months ago, it's a net loss. check the class action parade
behind the company.

How about some examples where tiny biotechs got upfront funding from great lenders with good terms? The
failures are easy. Where is the proving of your thesis. You know funding is often like this for biotechs with no
revenue, people with lousy credit or no income. Terms are dictated by capital needs and ability to pay back.
What start up biotechs have money or revenue. The terms always suck. But the new one with LPC had very
favorable terms considering. Why would a vulture like LPC give favorable terms the 3rd time around? HMMM

Michael Webb,


I am not trying to "bully others with long-winded nonsense", if you think it's "nonsense" anyway I have no idea
why you care at all and why it matters?  
I am just sharing what I see. You are not interested, ok.


Talking about "bullying" that's mostly what the supporters of Anavex have been throwing the last 2 months,
personal attacks and insults, they seem to think that anyone offering an opposing view to theirs or raising
legitimate concerns should be the target of insults, virulent personal attacks and threats, "taken to the
woodshed", but when it come to refuting facts and arguments in a civil and adult manner they come very
short, I guess that's the Donald Trump strategy you seem to be fond of.


Now I am sorry to insist but 2015 was an all time record for biotechnology funding in the private and public
markets, that is a fact, not "long winded nonsense". There is more money out there available for funding
biotechnology ventures than there ever was.


I am just going to paste a few articles here but you could find a lot of data out there attesting to that fact.

Once again F, you are like a scratched piece of vinyl painfully skipping over well thought out counter-
arguments in favor of replaying the same old tired song. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say "thank you"
for providing a long reading list that can't possibly disguise either your agenda or inability to think for yourself.


Since I prefer the company of those who listen as well as they speak - especially the Sunday Night Football
crew, I'll leave you alone now to skip along to that worn out tune you so eagerly suffer us all to hear.


Scrying Biotech - out!

Jean,


I would agree that the science is the most important thing, but good science and an LP deal don't spell doom,
or success. Many other things add in. Take Ocata for example.

Mike,


Good argument. It's really hard for a stem cell company to get funding in the US, even with all positives. We
know that :)


03 Jan 2016, 07:26 PM


DWD Investing, Contributor
What is checkered about Ocata's science and trials? the only thing checkered is they could not get funds in
spite of positive data and successes.

As for the specific "well thought out counter-arguments" on the way Anavex is conducting its business, I am
still waiting.

I've never been a believer of Anavex's drug. It may have some validity for managing AD, but the data is still too
preliminary and NO WAY I would invest at this early stage. With that said, this article is the most disgusting hit piece I
have ever seen. The author claims to be a "journalist" but this was nothing more than a way for her to make a profit
from shorting this company. Sick! SA has turned into a dumping ground for this sort of sh_t!

Be careful not being a believer. With high risk comes great reward. If the mechanism bears out a little further,
this thing will be worth billions. This is like advil for the brain, decreasing inflammatory cascades allowing the
M1 receptor to be repaired. It is a weak M1 agonist which is a GOOD thing, because it avoids M1 toxicity.
What wakes people up is the anti-inflammatory qualities like statins or advil, and then the body can work and
heal.

Stating not run with an FDA protocol is a lie. It has been specifically stated that it was and that now "formal"
contact with moving forward with Phase 2B/3


01 Jan 2016, 08:56 AM

Obviously you don't follow biotechs. Their last trial with the "great" data was run like a high school science
class. The data is irrelevant because there was no placebo run and it wasn't blinded


01 Jan 2016, 11:46 AM

I actually graduated from college. So tell us...What do you know about Phase 2A results? What do you know
about the 2B trials? Anything you can tell us about the M1 receptors?

Igraduatedcollegealready!
Absolutely nothing as my guess is nor do you except what you read but if you know what that means, you
would know they didn't run a detailed well thought out trial with meaningful data. They don't even have 5 year
data let alone 12 month data.


if the data was that impressive for a cure or to even slow down a disease in a billion dollar industry, a
company would have stepped up to run the trials for them. When the stock is at $2.00 you will understand

Interesting...I am on the fence with respect to AVXL,nothing is proven about their AD drug candidate and will
be years before we know if it is going to help patients. All the rest of this controversy is noise for a bear or a
bull to use in their trading schedule and WAY to dangerous for me to risk a position long or short at this
time.GL 
If you could post a link re the editors/authors connections to The Street it would be appreciated and maybe

"Anavex owes at least some of its newfound popularity to the glowing reviews published by Kanak Kanti De, a so-
called "doctor" who has developed a strong following on financial websites like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool
(where he ranks as a senior healthcare contributor) by portraying himself as "a retired medical practitioner" with an
impressive "M.D." behind his name. "


Interesting that KK, "a senior healthcare contributor with a strong following at Motley Fool" should be defending AVXL
while Motley Fool vehemently, vociferously and viciously attacks AVXL's pre-Missling history.

Somewhere in here, SA, there was reference to a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.


The lawsuit is captioned Cortina et al. v. Avanex et al. in the southern district of NY. Case was filed 12/30/15, the
same day as Melissa's article appeared in SA. 
Complaint easily available online.


Because it takes quite some time to prepare a complaint, it is fair to ask whether the law firm, Pomerantz, that filed
this case, knew about her story in advance, as her article and quotes therefrom are in the complaint?


All concerned will have the unique pleasure of testifying at deposition.


To be sure, there will be interesting counterclaims, and Dr. Kanak Kanti De will have an opportunity to file his own
lawsuit, if he choses.


The Pomerantz law firm will be open to being sanctioned if any of its allegations are found to have been frivolous. Did
this law firm properly investigate the allegations in Melissa's paper? What responsibility, if any, does SA have for
publishing it.


The allegations and charactierizations re Kanak Kanti De - - if untrue - - would seem to adversely affect his reputation
given his associations with SA, Motley Fool etc.

It should also be noted that a prestigious med journal, Neurodegenerative Diseases, published an article by A. Fisher
et al, - - cited in SA by AJBaker, thank you very much - - re AVXL's Alzheimer's med that Fisher invented. Doubt this
is junk science.


Would be good if all deposition videotapes were uploaded to the internet with links available in posts to SA.


Happy New Year, and let the games begin!

you don't.

I think the bear view says it all, the data is too preliminary, the trial is a quote: farce, the company is small, and it is a
BILLION dollar industry (yes it was said many times). It is why it is at the current valuation: $5-14. If it works already, it
will be trading at $200+. And remember, just November there is Positive FDA guidance for Anavex 2-73 double blind,
randomized controlled phase 2/3 trial. I dont think FDA is a scam institution.

Anyone can run a trial....yes if they run a new trial under FDA protocol and positive results come out then yes,
you are on to something but at this point, it has all been smoke and mirrors.


04 Jan 2016, 10:21 PM


Agamemnus, Contributor
As Igraduatedcollegealready! says, Anavex's PR about receiving "FDA guidance" might mean nothing more
than FDA customer service telling them how to proceed in a P2 trial, or even as simple as Anavex reading the
FDA documentation for such steps. Even if the FDA was sent Anavex's proposed P2 design and agreed with
it, this does not mean that "it works" or that the FDA validated Anavex's science in any way.

With my healthy dose of skepticism of AVXL, I'm still willing to see if their drug has any place in treating AD. I doubt it,

@paullyballz  
Ignorant? I would say you're comment is naive. Short sellers will say they exist to ostensibly expose
malfeasance within a company or sector and claim it as "journalism", but of course that's not the whole story.
I'm seeing many (and growing) short seller websites simply spreading ugly rumors and gossip to take quick
profits on the backs of the vast majority of investors and companies left at a loss of their hard-earned money.
That's counterproductive to capitalism. It reduces confidence in markets. It's thievery really.

talking about manipulation......people who manipulate through fraud are criminal...but to say all "short sellers"

Terapin, it's really funny that people keep reposting that article, because: 1 it shows a complete lack of
understanding for how financial markets work and price is formed in the market, and 2 given what has

"SOCIALIST Behaviour"


that's pretty extreme. "SOCIALIST" implies that the community/government pays directly, rather than citizens
individually and directly. who is the government/community supporting, directly? how do you get there from
the absence of short selling?


a bad company will find its share price fall as folks figure out it's bad, and sell off their shares. a bad company
will fall in share price. shorts, esp. naked shorts (and they do exist), force the price down beyond intrinsic
supply and demand price for the shares. the argument that such behavior is inherently market manipulation is
true. it may not be conspiratorial manipulation, but it does result in prices that are not intrinsic.


05 Jan 2016, 02:39 PM


terapin
@paullyballz 
Hello! I never said short selling should be banned! And don't long investors sell when they feel a stock is not
living up to their expectations? Of course they do.


Why not let the drug play out? If the drug fails, then too bad for the investor. If the drug succeeds then good
for the investor and the patient who needs it. I seem to keep repeating this, but I'm very skeptical of Anavex's
drug. The reasons are many and my previous posts will bear this out. The investor must do their own DD and
take the risks. Let the trials prove or disprove it.


If you were in a job, wouldn't you like to be hired or dismissed on your performance rather than based on
someone completely unrelated maligning your character or spreading rumors about you?


"why would you not want someone to have the reciprocal arrangement if he thought otherwise" - Okay then.
Go for it! But why do it by forcing SP down by spreading half-truths, ad hominem attacks or outright
falsehoods?


And "socialist"? Really? Wow! You seem to like throwing charged epithets around. As an investor in stocks
and one who wants to make profits by investing in new American companies, I'm hardly what you refer to as
socialist.

As long as AVXL is trading above zero there are 'discounts' to be had. While this article is definitely not one of

AVXL has had a complete and utter lack of institutional investors, and that alone gives the lie to this fraud, err
enterprise, which is currently centered on endless rounds of capital raising on the backs of easily gulled RETAIL
investors. Naturally the longs reject this and claim that new serious investors are coming on board (with no proof at
all). But now the deadline for filing quarterly changes in institutional positions (as of 12-31-15) has arrived and we can
see how this has actually been working out . . .


So what's happened? There's one, and only one, new SC filing and it's a doozy from DAFNA Capital Mgmt (part of
DAFNA LifeSciences)-


http://1.usa.gov/247Y49z


It shows that DAFNA now owns a big fat ZERO shares of AVXL. This of course begs the question what did they
previously own? To that we look back to the end of 2014 when they owned 4,800,000 shares. What does it mean? . . .
. . THEY DUMPED THE ENTIRE LOT!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3782676-anavex-regulatory-target-damaged-incriminating-evidence 73/75


Given the basis of this article and the conclusions drawn from it, I'm curious if the author is ready to retract any of the
nonsense now that the "SEC investigation" has been cleared and the predatory class action lawsuit has been
dismissed with prejudice.


If not, what does Ms. Davis know that the SEC and presiding judge do not?

There were and are still plenty of red flags without carrying this thing too far. Whenever a company releases
partial data, when much more can be provided, I call that a red flag.

...and Anavex is still 2 long p3's from any FDA approval,placebo controlled,double-blin... a lot of $$$...nothing
is certain anything the co has will ever reach market,but for those that suffer AD I hope what they have works.

Anavex is only weeks away from BTD and/or Fast Track designation by the FDA. Within 6 months of a Phase
3 trial, which will begin by no later than June, the trial will be halted and FDA approval granted soon after.
They can't keep this drug from suffers for much longer. $Billions to be saved in Medicare/Medicaid and other
health care costs.

It's mind-boggling how those idiot biotech funds and Big Pharma can't see that the world's most valuable drug
is being developed right under their noses. Only the Anavax punters can see this (they wear special glasses
that allow that). Pity the shorts and nay-sayers when this stock shoots to 40,000.

spark, 
Your comment that their initial p3 will be halted and FDA approval granted soon after is wishful thinking and
totally devoid of any scientific basis.AVXL must prove in several large,highly regulated,placebo driven p3's
that their drug works on a long term basis w/o negative SE.Then they will have to prove those results warrant
FDA approval.I hope it works for AD sufferers,however it will 100%,imo, not be approved w/o totally
completed p3 data.If I'm wrong then AVXL will be the leader in AD research and a goldmine for investors.If
patients plateau and then results go down long term,or suffer neg SE, then it will be another loser in a long list
of losers.Any potential approval is years away...4-5 years at the earliest,imo.GL

The Donepezil P3 trial was halted after 6 months and then approved. A2-73, with its continual great results
after one year, will not go any longer than 6 months. It has demonstrated efficacy far beyond what donepezil
has ever shown.

Based on the above commentators coming to the defense, I take it we will see no retractions. Both Agamemnus and
crichardt have entirely missed the point here. The author of this article clearly had tried to implicate Anavex Life
Sciences in orchestrated fraud via a series of innuendo, false assumptions, and red herrings. So unless the SEC and
the judge are both in on this "scam", then the entire basis of this article is nonsense and should be retracted. At the
very least, the author's reputation should be down the drain.


Sure - there may be other red flags for investors regarding the actual data but we're speaking to the wildly inaccurate,
libelous, and purposefully misleading claims that the company is a scam.

Agreed. Why SeekingAlpha chose to publish this is beyond belief.


04 Jan 2017, 12:05 PM


Agamemnus, Contributor
I see the point. I think the article is very heavy-handed and over-the-top, but imaginations run wild when there
is no data to support a conclusion one way or the other.

Won't be long before Ms Davis will have to hire a defense atty for the forthcoming libel suit that she deserves.

PhillyJoe
the whole point of the article, as outlined in the summary highlight bullets at the beginning, is to paint AVXL as a scam
pump-n-dump that is getting what it deserves by the SEC and lawsuits. That premise has been proven patently false,
so the article should be retracted. As far as comments about P2, P3, lot of road to go before a product hits market, bla
bla bla, duh, that's true of every investigational drug so why bring that up here? It's irrelevant to the debunking of this
article. Just give AVXL the fair shot at doing those things and stop looking for reasons to hate.

The author's bio states "After spending a dozen years making a big name for herself as a highly respected
investigative reporter in the financial arena, Melissa Davis took a chance on her longtime dream in 2015 by becoming
her own boss so that she could pour even more time and energy into uncovering the truth about suspicious public
companies by conducting the deepest research of her award-winning career.". Considering how wrong she was about
AVXL, she is not very good at what she does. That said, now that the truth has been uncovered by the courts, the
author owes AVXL an apology.

I want to join the lawsuit against Anavex, is it too late? Who Do I call? Messlissa? Jeanette? AF? I need a number,
can someone please spare a number, I vant to sue!!

BostonRedSox67
This is why I stay until the end of the credits at the movies, you never know how it will truly end. I cannot wait to see
the sequel, Messlissa rats on cabal to save hide, begs investors for forgiveness.


04 Jan 2017, 08:13 PM


fly_belgium
So Ms Davis, time to update your research with the latest developments such as 52 week data, judge dismissing
claim as baseless or SEC clearing Anavex of any wrongdoing. Looking foward.


05 Jan 2017, 09:38 AM


BostonRedSox67
Lets not hold our collective breath. Messlissa knew what she wrote was fraudulent, so this is not new news to
her.
