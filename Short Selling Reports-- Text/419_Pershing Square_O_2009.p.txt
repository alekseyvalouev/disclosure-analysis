Bill Ackman's Latest Short Position (Hedge Fund
Pershing Square)





Pershing Square hedge fund manager Bill Ackman


presented his latest short idea at the Great Investors Best


Ideas conference in Dallas, TX where he spoke with other


prominent hedge fund players such as David Einhorn of


Greenlight Capital. At the conference, Ackman laid out a short thesis for Realty


Income (NYSE: O). 





The rationale behind his play is as such: He thinks Realty Income (O) will suffer


because they have tenants with poor credit quality, many with junk ratings.


Additionally, he cites the fact that many of their tenants are in the dreaded


consumer discretionary segment. This sector has been notably hit due to the


recession and many stores have closed down over the past 12+ months. He also


mentioned that Realty Income also trades at a 7.5% cap rate or so, whereas the


private market value is a 10-11% cap rate, a 40% premium. 





Ackman's presentation also touched on the $26 share price level, as the stock can


never seem to go all that much higher recently given the fact that they keep issuing


shares around that level. They are essentially 'serial equity raisers' and their stock


vesting program is a bit odd in that the older you are, the quicker your stock vests.


We've certainly seen a massive wave of REIT equity dilutions over the past year,


and Realty Income seems to be no different. If anything, they're even more


aggressive in this regard. 





Ackman also noted that the REIT is very levered to occupancy as they essentially


doubled their asset base at the peak of the market during the years of 2005, 2006,


and 2007. So, they certainly have their share of fundamental problems, as many


other REITs in the space do. In the end, Ackman basically said that this company is


appealing to your everyday retail investor due to the monthly dividend stream that


they tout. He thinks this dividend will have to be cut and this would play out

5/22/2018 Bill Ackman's Latest Short Position (Hedge Fund Pershing Square) ~ market folly


https://www.marketfolly.com/2009/10/bill-ackmans-latest-short-idea-hedge.html 2/4


similarly to what we saw earlier in the year with many other major REIT players


cutting dividends or paying dividends in the form of stock. And, he feels that once


the dividend starts fading, so will all the retail investors. This is all the more


interesting to note given that Realty Income just raised their monthly dividend to


$0.1426875 per share, up from $0.142375 per share (hey Realty Income, can you


guys squeeze anymore decimal places into that amount? Geez). They've now boosted


their quarterly dividend each year for the past 15 years as the name currently


yields 6.2%. 





Pershing Square was already short in the REIT space to some degree in an effort to


hedge their long position in General Growth Properties (GGWPQ). Their largest


short position is a valuation hedge on this investment and they had also previously


mentioned in their letter to investors that they were short a REIT that has weak


assets, trades at a higher valuation, and has poor business prospects. So the


question now becomes, was Realty Income the company he was talking about in his


letter? It definitely appears as though it was. Once word of his presentation got out,


shares were down over 7% at one point on Wednesday. We found this interesting


given that Ackman typically doesn't short equities on the short side of his portfolio,


preferring instead to use derivatives as a means to maximize the reward of their


play, as we noted in our profile & biography on Ackman. 





In the WSJ the other day, Analyst Andrew DiZio from firm Janney Montgomery


Scott cited both the long and short cases for Realty Income, noting that shorts are


centering in on a potential bankruptcy by some of their tenants. He says, "shorts


believe large-scale vacancy from bankruptcies will reduce cash flow, necessitating a


dividend cut and resulting in the exodus of [Realty Income's] large retail


shareholder base." On the long side, he notes that "In the event of a Chapter 11


filing, a tenant will likely affirm the leases of profitable stores, closing those that


are cash flow negative. Realty Income's due diligence process results in the REIT


purchasing only those units that are cash flow positive, increasing the likelihood of


lease affirmation in the event of a bankruptcy." He currently has a 'neutral' rating


on the company, but has interestingly enough said that dips provide an


opportunity. 





Ackman has been pretty actively involved in real estate plays with his portfolio,


most notably with his position in General Growth Properties debt and equity


(GGWPQ). So far that position has done extremely well for him as he's up more


than 12-fold on the equity since their buy at $0.34 per share and the unsecured debt


they own has tripled in value over the same timeframe as noted in their latest


investor letter. Additionally, he also has a large stake in Target (TGT), whom he


proposed a REIT spin-off for earlier on that never panned out. Not to mention, his


experience stems back to his former hedge fund Gotham Partners who closed two of


their funds back in 2003 after a merger was blocked between one of his top holdings

and a real estate player. Ackman certainly has ties to the sector though, as his


father Lawrence D. Ackman is chairman of the Ackman-Ziff real estate advisory


firm. 





Overall, an interesting set of thoughts from Ackman and we'll be sure to cover more


developments regarding his thoughts as we obtain them. Don't forget that you can


hear more investment ideas from both Ackman and David Einhorn at the upcoming


Value Investing Congress on October 19th and 20th and we highly recommend


attending. We also wanted to mention that at the same Dallas conference, Einhorn


mentioned that he was buying interest-rate options that he will make money on if


yields head higher. This is likely a very similar to Julian Robertson's curve caps


play, as we now see yet another prominent hedge fund player enter this trade.


These plays are definitely inflationary in nature and Einhorn has set his sights on


this outcome, as he also holds a lot of physical gold. We'll also watch developments


in this regard and will post up further information as we obtain it. 





You can view our coverage of Bill Ackman's Pershing Square portfolio here and


David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital portfolio here. Lastly, make sure you check out


our profile/biography on Ackman & Pershing Square. 





Taken from Google Finance, "Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend


Company, is organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust (REIT).


The primary business objective of the REIT is to generate dependable monthly cash


distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations (FFO)


per share. The Company’s monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow


from the portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains."
