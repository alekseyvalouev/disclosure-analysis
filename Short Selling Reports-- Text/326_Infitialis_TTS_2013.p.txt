The Tile Shop: Poisoned Tile, Bad Actors, Unsustainable Margins, And
A Stock Ready To Crack
Oct. 21, 2013 10:15 AM ET56 comments
by: Infitialis


Acting on a whistleblower tip, the Infitialis Research Collective has invested several
months' time investigating The Tile Shop's (NASDAQ:TTS) business operations and
miraculous stock market rise. Frankly, we were shocked at the extent of management
malfeasance uncovered and the clear and present danger this company represents to the
public at large.


1. After listing via a SPAC a little over a year ago at $10.00/share, Tile Shop's share price
has increased more than 2.5x to all-time highs on the back of the Company's suspiciously
high EBITDA margins, aggressive growth plan to more than triple its store count, and
heavy cheerleading from sell-side analysts


2. However, independent laboratory testing results indicate a significant number of The
Tile Shop products have DANGEROUS lead contaminations, up to 13,900% greater than
the United States' Consumer Product Safety Commission limits for products that come in
contact with children


3. The Tile Shop's lead contaminated products represent a clear and present danger to
consumer safety as the tiles are recommended for kitchen and bath installation in close
proximity to food prep and shower areas, significantly increasing the probability of lead
transmission to children


4. In addition to consumers abandoning The Tile Shop due to significant concerns about
product safety, the liabilities associated with any potential product recalls, regulatory
investigations, and class action litigation could swamp the company's very limited liquidity
and less than $3.8mm in available cash


5. The company's current management team is wholly unfit for public company
stewardship with a Founder/CEO convicted of FRAUD and the SVP of Operations is
presently out on PROBATION.


6. The Tile Shop's LTM EBITDA margins of 27.0% is more than 2x its peer comparables
and will compress due to its reliance on mickey-mouse Chinese suppliers and increasing
overhead costs

7. The Tile Shop's plan to more than double the historical store expansion rate appears
nothing more than a scheme to jack the share price based on the false mirage of growth
as opposed to creating long-term value for all public shareholders


8. The Chan Brothers, with their dubious and notorious lineage in Hong Kong real estate,
have been selling down their ~30% ownership stake in The Tile Shop acquired for $12mm
at $10.00/15.00/24.25 per share and will likely dump more on the market when their
current 150 day lock-up agreement expires at the end of the month


Long investors in The Tile Shop should consider immediately reducing the position as
public dissemination of these dangerous lead concerns will likely lead to a massive
correction in the company's stock price. Speculative investors should consider a short
position in The Tile Shop as it appears overvalued on a fundamental basis at 23.9x
FV/EBITDA and 55.8x P/E consensus FY13 sell-side estimates and the issues uncovered
in this report will likely accelerate a pricing correction.


The Tile Shop Business Introduction


Founded in 1985 by current CEO Mr. Robert Rucker with a single store in Rochester,
Minnesota, The Tile Shop ("Tile Shop" or the "company") is currently one of the largest
specialty retailers of manufactured and natural stone tiles, setting and maintenance
materials, and related accessories in the United States. As of June 30, 2013, the
Company had 75 stores in 25 states with an average footprint of 23,000 square feet.


After going public via a SPAC on only 08/22/12 at $10.00/share (it never would have
passed a convention IPO due diligence process), Tile Shop's share price has increased
more than 2.5x to all time highs on the back of the company's aggressive growth plan to
more than triple its store count, shockingly high EBITDA margins relative to its
comparables, and heavy cheerleading from sell-side analysts, including Credit Suisse
adding the company to its "Top U.S. Investment Ideas List" on 09/05/13 with $31 PT. With
equity investors blindly bidding up all stocks related to the United States residential

housing "recovery," The Tile Shop shareholders have ignored critical questions about the
history of the business operation and the safety of the products that have allowed the
Company to earn shockingly fat margins.


Currently trading at 23.9x FV/EBITDA, and 55.8x P/E consensus FY13 sell-side
estimates, The Tile Shop's market valuation is egregiously rich before even considering
the significant business issues discussed in this report. Moreover, the current consensus
sell-side financial estimates will become unreliable once consumers abandon The Tile
Shop in droves due to very serious health and safety concerns about the company's core
tile products.


DANGEROUS Levels of Lead Contamination in The Tile Shop Products - Significant
Recall, Remediation, and Class Action Risks


The Tile Shop claims to be able to earn sustainable EBITDA margins of >25%, more than
2x its similar big-box home improvement competitors, because its "Vertically Integrated
Value Chain" allows it to "minimize cost, maintain quality, and reduce risk." Specifically,
approximately 58% of The Tile Shop's purchased products are sourced from Asia, and
primarily from three Chinese suppliers of dubious lineage based on PIERS U.S. customs
import data.

Moreover, as part of its consumer advertising campaigns, The Tile Shop repeatedly
stresses that its unique sourcing process allows it to guarantee "the finished product is
inspected to ensure quality control" and "always made to our high standards, at every
stage of production." However, the Company's boisterous claims appear to be nothing
more than a dangerous form of unsubstantiated puffery because independent laboratory
testing of The Tile Shop products raises serious concerns about significant lead
contamination of the tiles sold in its stores throughout the United States.


Independent Lab Tests Indicate DANGEROUS Lead Contamination In Tiles

We recently acquired a variety of tile samples from the company's retail locations in the
critical East Coast, Midwest, and Western regions of The Tile Shop's geographic footprint.
After the tiles were individually logged/ tagged, split-sampled, , and bagged, the samples
were dispatched to a United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and
ISO/IEC 17025 accredited independent laboratory for lead concentration testing utilizing
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved methodologies. The independent
laboratory testing results are simply shocking and indicate a significant number of The Tile
Shop tile products currently being sold to consumers and installed in homes have
dangerous lead concentrations significantly higher than the CPSC total lead content limit
as of 08/14/11 of 100 parts per million (ppm) for products that come in contact with
children.


Selected Independent Laboratory Lead Testing Results


Significance of Lead Contamination in Tiles


The Tile Shop's products appear to present a significant health risk for multiple reasons.
First, as a reminder of basic high school chemistry, lead is a heavy metal that is toxic for
humans, and is associated with lowered levels of learning, impaired hearing, brain
damage and, at high levels, fatalities in children. Second, The Tile Shop specifically
advertises its products for kitchen and bath applications, dramatically increasing the
probability of lead transmission to humans, and specifically children, once the tile is
installed because of the direct contact with food preparation areas in kitchens and with
bare skin in bathrooms via floors, shower-stalls, etc. Finally, as The Tile Shop encourages
DIY installations, there is a significantly greater probability the homeowner will create
excessive amounts of lead-contaminated dust and spread these dangerous lead
contaminations throughout their home as part of the tile fitting, cutting and installation
process due to a lack of hazardous materials handling training and experience.

Business and Liability Implications of The Tile Shop's Lead Contamination


As DIY customers become aware of the significant potential health and safety risks of
installing lead contaminated tiles from The Tile Shop in their homes, the economic
consequences for The Tile Shop will be catastrophic. Customers will simply purchase tiles,
a fungible commodity product, at other established retailers, such as Home Depot and
Lowe's, which utilize robust sourcing processes and procedures to ensure the safety of
products on their shelves, which will kill The Tile Shop's future revenue, cash flow, and
store expansion plans.


In addition to the catastrophic effect on The Tile Shop's future earnings potential, the
company will face a potentially paralyzing drain on its liquidity as it resolves the effects of
the lead-contaminated tiles already in its inventory and installed in customers' homes. As
of 06/30/13, The Tile Shop reported $58.7mm of inventories, or more than 25% of its total
assets, all of which should be tested for lead contaminants, and the contaminated product
will have to be responsibly disposed. More significantly, as of 06/30/13, The Tile Shop had
only $3.8mm in cash and equivalents available, yet is burdened by $98.6mm in debt,
capital leases, and deferred rent obligations. A product recall and replacement inventory
expenses could quickly swamp The Tile Shop's already stretched liquidity and put it in
violation of its debt covenants, quickly precipitating a bankruptcy filing.

Even more serious than the lead-contaminated inventory issue, The Tile Shop faces
potentially crippling liabilities from regulatory actions and class-action lawsuits regarding
damages associated with its sale of lead contaminated products. For example, The Tile
Shop may be liable for the removal, remediation, and replacement of lead-contaminated
tiles sold during its 28 years of sourcing tile from China. Previous class-action cases for
China sourced and other lead-contaminated products have been for tens to hundreds of
millions of dollars, including Mattel's lead contaminated toys, $80mm for sulfurous drywall
installed in homes in Florida, and the $200mm suit against WASA for lead contamination
in drinking water.


Bad Actors - Founder/CEO Convicted of FRAUD, SVP Currently on PROBATION


The Tile Shop currently has a very thin management bench as it is still undergoing the
painful transition to overcome its prior "material weaknesses" on internal controls as a
family operated business to a publicly-traded corporation. Moreover, the prior history of
the current management team should raise significant concerns for investors based on
their track record of fraud, criminal behavior, and business failures.

CEO/Founder Convicted of FRAUD


On 09/26/05, Mr. Robert Rucker, Founder/CEO, was convicted of fraud in a civil case with
his ex-wife for misrepresenting and failing to disclose information relating to the financial
condition of The Tile Shop to a neutral business appraiser retained to value the Company

as part of their divorce proceedings. In the fiery post-trial ruling, Judge Kaman of the
Minnesota Civil Court awarded Katherine Rucker pre-judgment interest, costs, and
disbursements of an additional $4.2mm (vs. the original $2.4mm divorce settlement) in
light of Robert Rucker's fraudulent behavior and disingenuous scheming in a ham-fisted
scheme attempting to minimize the compensation paid to the mother of his child.


To fully understand the fraud conviction against Mr. Robert Rucker, Founder/CEO, it is
useful to review the dramatic saga of The Tile Shop business. Founded in 1985 with a
single store in Rochester, Minnesota, Mr. Robert Rucker had a 50% equity interest along
with his partner and CFO, Mr. Rodney Sill, who owned the other 50% equity interest. On
04/06/00, Mr. Robert Rucker filed for divorce from his wife of 24 years, Ms. Katherine
Rucker, and a neutral business appraiser was jointly retained to value their marital assets,
including the 50% equity ownership of The Tile Shop, as of 12/31/00, when the Company
had 14 stores in the upper Midwest.


As part of purportedly neutral business appraisal process, Mr. Robert Rucker "provided
false and misleading information as well as financial records that were intentionally and
fraudulently altered to cause The Tile Shop's appraised value to be grossly understated
for the purpose of the divorce." Mr. Robert Rucker supervised his attorney and employees
as they created a "doom and gloom" financial forecast that in his own words was the
"worst possible damn scenario" to be shared with the neutral business appraiser.
Specifically, The Tile Shop financial forecast Mr. Robert Rucker represented as accurate
for FY01-FY03 had the store count remaining static at 14, annual revenue barely growing
from $46.9mm to only $49.6mm, gross margins shrinking a dreadful 710bps from 61.2% in
FY01 to 54.0% in FY03, and net income before tax dropping from $2.9mm in FY01 to
$2.3mm in 2003. Based on the financial forecast Mr. Robert Rucker represented as being
truthful and accurate, the 50% equity interest in The Tile Shop was valued at $7.125mm,
or $1.02mm per store on an enterprise value basis.


As the neutral business appraisal process was being completed for the divorce, Mr.
Robert Rucker was simultaneously utilizing for business planning a second set of
significantly more bullish financial forecast that were not shared with his wife, which
forecast $6.9 mm of net income in FY01 while also engaging in lease discussions to open
as many as 6 new stores the instant the divorce was finalized. According to The Tile
Shop's FY01 audited financial statements, the company generated $51.8mm in revenue
and $6.7mm in net income before taxes. In other words, the internal financial forecast that
Mr. Robert Rucker possessed and utilized, but fraudulently withheld from the neutral
business appraiser, were almost perfectly accurate.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1757132-the-tile-shop-poisoned-tile-bad-actors-unsustainable-margins-and-a-stock-ready-to-crack 8/31


Almost two years after the divorce was finalized, Ms. Katherine Rucker became aware of
her ex-husband's skullduggery regarding The Tile Shop's financial forecast and filed a
fraud upon the court civil action in the Hennepin County District Court in Minnesota. After
a bench trial in March 2005, Judge Kaman found Mr. Robert Rucker guilty of fraud by
misrepresenting or failing to disclose information relating to the financial condition of The
Tile Shop to the neutral business appraiser as part of the state court supervised the
divorce proceedings. Judge Kaman thereafter redistributed the value of The Tile Shop as
a marital asset and awarded Ms. Katherine Rucker an additional $4.2mm in pre-judgment
interest, costs, and penalties based on the revised appraisal utilizing the correct financial
forecast, for $30.7mm enterprise valuation or an implied $2.2mm per store (including
penalties and interest due).


In summary, it is shocking to see the CEO of a $1.5bn Nasdaq company was convicted of
fraud just a few years ago for intentionally mis-marking The Tile Shop financials in a ham-
fisted scheme attempting to minimize the lawful compensation paid to the mother of his
child. Moreover, even under the revised valuation of The Tile Shop imposed by the court
after the fraud conviction of Mr. Robert Rucker, each store was valued at only
approximately $2.2mm including penalties and interest due, versus the $19.1mm valuation
the equity market currently ascribes to each of the Company's stores and the $1.4mm new
store opening cost described by the current Tile Shop management team.


Senior VP of Operations Currently on PROBATION


After Founder & CEO Mr. Robert Rucker, the second-highest compensated executive in
FY12 was Mr. Joseph Andrew Kinder, the Senior Vice President - Operations, who took
home $1.96mm in total compensation, including base salary, bonus, and options awards.
Starting as a Sales Associate in one of the original Tile Shop locations in 1993, Mr. Kinder
rose through the ranks to become Mr. Robert Rucker's right-hand man, overseeing all
distribution/manufacturing and managing the international purchasing reportedly critical to
The Tile Shop's outsized margins. However, Mr. Kinder's failure in oversight to prevent the
significant lead contamination in The Tile Shop's products sold to consumers is not
exceedingly shocking considering he is currently out on PROBATION until next year after
getting involved in a domestic dispute and altercation with responding police officers. After
screaming "F*CK YOU, I can't believe you called the cops" at his wife in front of their two
young children upon the arrival of the police, Mr. Kinder was arrested and charged with
two gross misdemeanors (a felony charge, for Domestic Assault - By Strangulation, was

eventually dropped). In addition, Mr. Kinder appears to have been previously indicted for a
DUI in Minnesota in 1993, which provides further evidence of his criminal behavior, poor
decision making, and general lack of self-control.


If Mr. Kinder has a similar behavioral outburst over the next few months and gets his
probation revoked, he will be returned to Culver County Jail (where he has already served
three days as part of his conviction) to complete the remainder of his sentence, making it
nearly impossible for The Tile Shop's "vertically integrated value chain" to continue to
operate after losing this key-man.


Finally, although on 10/01/13 The Tile Shop announced it had hired Mr. Chris Homeister,
age 44, as Chief Operating Officer for an annual base salary of $300k, his previous
experience at the failing retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) does not inspire much confidence
in his ability to effectively manage a retail growth strategy or effectively supervise Mr.
Joseph Kinder. Moreover, the hiring of Mr. Chris Homeister appears to have effectively
demoted Mr. Carl Randazzo, the current Senior Vice President - Retail, who has been with
the company for more than 20 years and previously reported directly to Founder/CEO Mr.
Robert Rucker. While at Best Buy, Mr. Chris Homesiter spearheaded their disastrous
venture into the pawnshop industry to buy/sell used video games like GameStop
(NYSE:GME) and attempted restructuring of the Rhapsody RealNetworks Best Buy Digital
Music Store (a purported iTunes competitor). Neither of these unsuccessful ventures
appears remotely applicable to a DIY tile retailer. Moreover, this announcement may be
indicative the Company's Founder/CEO, Mr. Robert Rucker, is looking to spend more time
at his Hawaii beach-house with his new wife, Ms. Lee Shoon, and less time continuing to
nurture growth at the Company as a hands-on manager.

Unsustainable Margins for a Commodity Product: Significant Near Term Pricing and
Cost Pressures


Tile is a classic fungible commodity product (assuming it is not contaminated with
dangerous amounts of lead). Once purchased or installed, it is virtually impossible to
determine if a tile was sourced from a commercial flooring supplier, big-box home
improvement supplier, or a DIY consumer retailer like The Tile Shop. The Home Depot
(NYSE:HD) continues to roll out its "Expo" format stores and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) is
making significant investments in store refurbishments, both of which features full room
vignettes similar to The Tile Shop. More importantly, The Home Depot and Lowe's, despite
their significantly larger economies of scale in sourcing and existing nation-wide
geographic footprint, are happy to earn 13.2% and 10.6% EBITDA margins, respectively,
versus The Tile Shop's 27.0% LTM EBITDA margins. The consumer tile sector is
becoming more price-competitive as more price discovery occurs on-line and the

Company's margins will dramatically compress if they continue to attempt to gain market
share. In summary, The Tile Shop is not selling stretchy yoga pants or iPads à la $LULU
or $AAPL; it's colored tile.  


In addition to revenue pricing pressure from larger-scale and better capitalized nation-wide
incumbent home improvement retailers, The Tile Shop is also facing significant margin
pressure on the cost side. In the last quarter alone, it hired an additional 22 people as
corporate staff (which is expected to adversely affect margins by 200bps going forward) to
help complete its corporate infrastructure after the prior "material weakness" issues with
financial reporting. In addition, The Tile Shop recently announced a $1.0mm advertising
venture (~17% of FY12A net cash flow) with Pocket Hercules. Shareholders should review
the sample "Naked Guy in Shower Advertisements" developed by The Tile Shop
management team to determine if they believe this venture to be the best use of the
Company's limited funds and if it will be accretive to net margins.


Finally, in an apparent attempt to pull forward sales to hit its 3q13 revenue and same-store
sales growth numbers for sell-side expectations, The Tile Shop ran, in quick succession,
several heavily promoted discount sales at the end of last month. On September 22-23, all
floor and wall tiles were 15% off in all stores for a "Fall is Beautiful Sale" and on
September 26, an flash sale offered 25% off on all online purchases. This margin dilutive
cannibalization of future quarters sales is extremely toxic to the business prospects of the
Tile Shop and should give current shareholders significant concern about the long-term
earnings potential of the business.

Unsustainable and Unachievable Store Expansion Plans


Much of the current investor excitement regarding The Tile Shop revolves around Wall
Street expectations of the Company rapidly increasing its store count. Since its founding in
1985, The Tile Shop has generally funded its annual single-digit store expansion to
adjacent geographic areas by utilizing organically generated internal cash flow. This
historical rate of expansion has allowed it to optimize the capacity of its regional
distribution centers (critical for the significant transportation costs of heavy tile) and
perform adequate site diligence on potential retail locations demographics and potential
tile demand to ensure the long-term business success of the store.

However, since going public, The Tile Shop management team has turbocharged Wall
Street expectations to expanding to 140-150 stores as a "near term opportunity" over the
next few years and reaching >400 stores thereafter. Rapidly increasing the rate of its
geographic footprint expansion will likely be dilutive to the Company's business operations
as it 1) expands into marginal locations with lower annual earnings potential, 2) in-fill
stores will cannibalize existing store sales (for example, the new stores opening this fall in
Norwalk and Danbury CT, respectively, are less than 30 miles apart and are also very
close to the existing store in Scarsdale, NY, and 3) the dramatic increase in store
openings is outstripping the supply of its experienced Assistant & Head Store Managers
ready to move to a new location and handle the start-up a new store, which will
dramatically decrease customer satisfaction and critical repeat and referral sales.


After reviewing The Tile Shop saga and management's turbo-charged store expansion
plans, investors would be wise to review the trajectory of a similar SPAC-funded disaster:
American Apparel. After completing a SPAC listing in December 2006 with Endeavor
Acquisition Corp (which ironically utilized the same IR firm as The Tile Shop: ICR Inc.),
shares initially popped on investors excitement of management's promise to open >800
stores worldwide , but slowing SSS growth and management issues precipitated a
dramatic decline in the share price and multiple near-bankruptcy rescue financings.
Moreover, store count has actually declined over the last few years and is now below 250.


Moreover, prudent investors should not rely upon The Tile Shop's store expansion plans at
face value based on the prior history of broken promises and fraudulent
misrepresentations by CEO/Founder Mr. Robert Rucker. For example, on 03/06/01 and

04/07/01, despite operating only 20 stores at the time, The Tile Shop indicated, in order to
increase its working capital facility, with Wells Fargo, the Company's primary bank, it
planned to operate 50 stores by no later than January 1, 2005. In actuality, it took The Tile
Shop until the end 2011, nearly 6 years after its original bank forecast, and despite
purportedly robust financial results between 2005 and 2011, to open its 50th store. Based
on The Tile Shop's management team's prior track of providing fraudulent and misleading
financial forecasts in an attempt maliciously achieve its internal goals, it seems prudent for
investors to heavily discount The Tile Shop's purported store expansion plans currently
built into the share price.


Landmines Abound: Dubious SPAC History with $450mm Valuation, Material
Weaknesses, and Chan Brothers'/Nabron Lock-Up Expiration


First, because The Tile Shop elected to access the public equity markets via a SPAC
transaction on 08/22/12 at $10.00/share as opposed to a traditional IPO listing process, it
is important for current investors to contemplate the structural considerations of this
alternative financial product. Because of the relatively short and defined time period
available for a SPAC to source and execute a transaction or face liquidation, the
management teams are often rushed to complete any potential acquisition by a drop-dead
date, despite whatever last minute due diligence concerns arise during closing. As a result
of this adverse selection bias for acquisitions, the average return for the 111 SPACs
between 2004 and 2013 which successfully acquired a company was -14.4%, according
to SPAC Analytics. By contrast, the Russell 3000-stock index returned +5.9% in that same
period. It's not just that SPAC returns are terrible. There have been some spectacular
failures and frauds, which have completely wiped out equity holders, as SPACs have
rushed into market fads like energy, water, and China.


For The Tile Shop, the SPAC due diligence process appears extremely rushed and the
sellers valuation range is extremely concerning relative to the current market price.
Between 05/08/12 and 06/27/12, less than 50 calendar days, the entire transaction
structure was negotiated, due diligence was purportedly completed, and the merger
agreement was executed. More concerning for current Tile Shop stockholders, the sellers
of the company, including Mr. Robert Rucker, were willing to entertain merger discussions
as low as $450mm in enterprise valuation (9.0x expected EBITDA for 2012) versus the
current $1,431.8mm market enterprise price (23.9x street EBITDA expectations for 2013).
Moreover, The Tile Shop was adequately capitalized at the time of the merger to allow Mr.
Robert Rucker to continue the historical organic store expansion rate of 5-8 new stores

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1757132-the-tile-shop-poisoned-tile-bad-actors-unsustainable-margins-and-a-stock-ready-to-crack 16/31


per year and no other stockholders had an apparent rushing need to monetize their
investment in the company. What does Mr. Robert Rucker know that the market is
currently not considering?


Next, during 2012, The Tile Shop's auditors identified several material weaknesses in their
financial reporting, including, but not limited to, a lack of sufficiently competent personnel,
a lack of financial close processes, and deficient financial reporting systems to ensure the
accurate and timely reporting of the Company's financial results. While The Tile Shop has
supposedly remediated these issues after hiring Mr. Tim Clayton as CFO, investors would
still be prudent to review the Company's reported financials with appropriate skepticism in
light of the management team's limited public company experience, rapid business
expansion, and historical issues. For example, since The Tile Shop allows unlimited
product returns without any restocking fees (unlike any of its peers and potentially allows
the Company to pull forward phantom revenue and SSS growth metrics), can investors
really have robust confidence that the $58.7mm in purported inventories (~25% of total
assets and growing faster than sales) as of 06/30/13 is ready to be sold to customers,
instead of being contaminated with lead and/or consisting of boxes of broken, chipped, or
discolored returned tiles from previous failed renovation projects?


Lastly, the Ronnie and Gerald Chan brothers of Hong Kong currently control ~22.5% of
The Tile Shop's equity via their Bahamian shell company Nabron International, Inc. After
acquiring an original 30% equity interest in The Tile Shop for only $12.0mm in total
consideration in October 2002 (for an approximately $2.2mm per store enterprise
valuation versus the current market valuation of $19.1mm per store), they have been
highly motivated sellers at $15.00/share and $24.25/share of the Company since going
public via the SPAC at $10.00/share. As their 150-day lockup from the most recent
secondary share sell-down expires at the end of this month, it would not be surprising if
they dumped a significant portion of their remaining $360mm equity value ownership stake
on the market (~60 days trading volume) at these current stratospheric valuation levels. In
addition to the share overhang, the Chan Brothers' intertwined involvement in the situation
raises further questions about the Company's lead contaminated tile product sourcing
relationships in China in light of the numerous accusations of their involvement in
significant corruption and fraud throughout Asia. Overall, this situation appears
disturbingly similar to Enron Corporation, where Mr. Ronnie Chan served as a Board of
Directors and Audit Committee member leading up to its infamous Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing and was selling shares for his personal account up to the firm's sordid collapse.

Valuation: The Tile Shop Trades at an Unsustainable Premium to its Comparables
and Intrinsic Value


Currently trading at 23.9x FV/EBITDA and 55.8x P/E consensus FY13 sell-side estimates,
The Tile Shop's market valuation appears egregiously rich relative to its public
comparables in the home improvement retailer, "best-in-class" consumer product retailers,
and high-growth retailer sectors, which trade at a median of 11.0x FV EBITDA and 20.5x
P/E consensus FY13 estimates. In light of all the serious business issues identified earlier
in this report, The Tile Shop's current premium valuation appears completely
unsustainable.


The Tile Shop Trading Comparables


In addition to the significant trading multiple premium to comparable peers, The Tile Shop
is also trading at a significant premium to its DCF intrinsic value. For example, even under
exceedingly bullish scenarios of continued double-digit annual revenue growth with

Interesting analysis. I have a few questions:


Do you know what the margin is that HD and LOW earn on tiles? I get that their overall margin is lower than TTS, but
maybe that is because the margins on other products they sell is real low which offsets the high margin on tiles. If you
don't know it for HD and LOW do you have figures for privately operated tile makes?


As a follow-up to the above, if TTS has higher margins than what others get for their tile business, why do you think
this is? I have been told that TTS has better margins because they do such a good job sourcing, but when pressed on
this explanation, those who have asserted it become wishy washy. Maybe the answer is in the part about the lead
content and the quality is just not as high so they can obtain a higher margin. Just curious to get your thoughts.


21 Oct 2013, 01:02 PM


anotherday14
I did not do a good job of expressing the second part. What I should of said is that it seems to are saying that
the higher margins are a result of sourcing low quality product from Asia. Is this correct? As a follow-up I
should have asked, have you looked into what % of tile is generally sourced from Asia at other places such as
HD and LOW? I wonder if 58% is high or not.

I can't say I'm impressed with some of the details of the private lives you share here - they're pretty depressing. I
sincerely hope they've put their lives back together. I suspect that there might be similar troubles I don't know about in
the lives of many of those in executive suites in other companies I hold. I've sold a couple when the very ethics of
their business practices have proved to be questionable. But I don't think I'll sell this one. Who knows, the same
personal problems may hold with, say, my plumber or local chain store manager.


If they have products that fail to meet safety standards, then they better clean that up! But they have hundreds of
products, so I'm not inclined to judge them too harshly on that score - yet.


I became aware of TTS when we were remodeling our bathroom. Simply from the point of view of a customer, I was
extremely impressed with them. The majority of their product line seems to be natural stone and, there, I was not able

outstanding, and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. The return policy you note, given the cost and some of the
complexity of stone installation, was a big draw. Anyway, it was a bit after this that I found out that their shares were
listed.


Their business plan seemed very aggressive. Their valuation when I purchased was fairly reasonable. I've wondered
since whether that valuation has become a bit too steep.


Yep, I think I'll hold and see how this all plays out.

You have some fairly serious allegations. I do find it interesting that neither TTS's IPO Registration Statement on
Form S-1, nor TTS's Annual Report on Form 10-K, disclose anything about a fraud conviction. Item 401(f)(2) of
Regulation S-K, public companies are required to disclose whether any of their officers/directors "was convicted in a
criminal proceeding or is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
minor offenses)" within the last ten years. Although two very good law firms, McDermott Will & Emery LLP and
Fredrikson & Byron, P.A., reviewed the Registration Statement, there is absolutely no disclosure about a 2005 "fraud
conviction." Are you using the term "conviction" to describe a civil proceeding?


With regard to the hiring of the ex-Best Buy manager as the new COO, isn't it logical that a good CEO would want to
hire a seasoned manager to oversee rapid expansion and bring economies of scale to the business? In addition, I
thought that Best Buy's stock was doing quite well in the past 12 months. I thought that BBY had risen from
approximately $11 per share to over $40 per share in the past year. Is that correct? Are you overstating your case
here?


I note your statement that "We recently acquired a variety of tile samples from the company's retail locations in the
critical East Coast, Midwest, and Western regions of The Tile Shop's geographic footprint." Who is "We"? Who
acquired the samples? You have some very interesting points, but I'd really like to have more details.

Good point Navydog11. The article says "was convicted of fraud in a civil case." People don't get convicted in
civil cases.


Yeah, I just looked at that attachment. I sure wouldn't call it a fraud conviction. Not that it shows good
character, obviously not, but it's not a conviction either.

This article makes far too much use of adjectives and surmise, glancing blows and strained associations.


It seems more likely that this diabtribe is fraudulent than the divorce proceedings.

I'm pretty fanatical about ensuring safe products. In fact, I really don't see much point in using lead in much of
anything, and I certainly see no need for it in tile.


In spite of that, I'm not sure I regard the information you provided here as credible evidence there is a problem. For
starters, it would appear that the CPSC uses a different standard than the testing you have done for making
determinations concerning the accessibility of lead in children's products. (I am not sure tile would fit under the ambit
of "children's product" anyway, particularly since they make a point of discussing furniture, but not tile.)


In any event, one issue for the CSPC appears to be whether the lead was accessible. For example, see "§ 1500.87
Children's products containing lead: inaccessible component parts." In tile it might be that a glaze would cover
pigments, inks, or whatever else might contain heavy metals. Hence they might not be considered accessible. (I don't
know, but I would certainly address that question before asserting that there was a problem.)


There are approved test methods for damn near everything. The fact that an "approved method" was used doesn't
mean that the method was appropriate for the type of analysis needed. The test you appear to have used would be
the California equivalent of the federal Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure test. That test involves pulverizing
the solid material until it fits through a very small mesh, then soaking the material in an acid and testing the extracted
liquid. I'm not certain that the CSPC would use that same test; their focus might well be on the glaze rather than the
tile as a whole. I don't know, but I would sure want to find out before making allegations.


You also mentioned the independent lab's results without describing the CPSC's results? Why is that? I for sure would
want to see what they said. In fact, I would be real curious about their guidance regarding tile.


I've worked on cases where tile was considered a hazardous waste, but that was when it was discarded. Different
standards apply in the case where it is used as a product, although I would personally prefer not to have products with
heavy metals routinely used for consumer products when they don't need to be.


While the honesty and integrity of corporate officers is a legitimate issue, I find what you did to be over-the-top; it is
not the kind of thing I think appropriate.

Answer: “Not in the tiles, no” 
Question: Is that tile [Egeum Azure 4x4 (SKU: 682800)] appropriate for a kitchen back-splash?” [Up to 1,100ppm lead
in Infitialis' sample tests] 
Answer: “Yeah, absolutely”


Infitialis continues to have serious concerns about The Tile Shop and remains short the shares.

I don't see any evidence that Tile's product does contain an high level of lead. 
The link provided by Infitialis (abridged or not) is completely useless, as it is only referred to the methodology
and regulation, not to the independent laboratory test on Tile's product.


22 Oct 2013, 01:41 AM


No Mean Sum, Contributor
My concern is that you tested how many tiles? If it's as small a sample size as I think it is there are bound to
be outliers. Have you looked into any regulatory action against other lead contamination offenders, and
determined in such cases what kind of statistical tests were used to determine that the products were in fact
offensive? Did you test any tiles from competitors?

I looked at the link that you provided. It doesn't address my more fundamental question: How would the CPSC go
about testing tile? One well known method of eliminating the hazard from inorganic compounds like lead and arsenic

is to vitrify them -- essentially encapsulate them. If the tiles are well glazed with a glaze that doesn't have those
compounds in it, that might make a difference to the CPSC.


Also, I'm not sure they would consider tile a children's product, regardless of whether it was in a child's bathroom or
not.


I would note that the CPSC has a procedure where they will test and make determinations on products. See 16 CFR
§ 1500.91 "Determinations regarding lead content for certain materials or products under section 101 of the
Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act." 
Have you considered submitting the tile to them with your data and requesting a determination under this provision ?


I have no interest in this company, neither long nor short. I just think everyone deserves fair play. And I say that
despite the fact that I personally wouldn't touch the tile if it has those concentrations of lead in it. That is different than
essentially saying that it doesn't meet the CPSC's standards, which I cannot tell based on the information you
provided.

Ape2Adam
Interesting article. I have a few questions:


1) Did you also have tile from other tile shops/big box home improvement retailers tested? If so, you didn't mention it.
That would give the reader an idea of whether or not your charges of lead contamination are localized to this one
retailer, or endemic to glazed tile in general. For example, HealthyStuff.org tested over 3,300 home improvement
products in 2010. The test data "represents the largest publicly available database of toxic chemicals in home
improvement products." Of the ceramic tile they sampled, 74% contained detectable lead--with levels as high as
1,900 ppm. And FYI, The Tile Shop wasn't one of the retailers they targeted for samples. Do you think this information
might have been important to share with your readers?


2) You say, "The Tile Shop tile products... have dangerous lead concentrations significantly higher than the CPSC
total lead content limit as of 08/14/11 of 100 parts per million (ppm) for products that come in contact with children."
Might you also have mentioned that no federal standards exist for lead in home improvement products? This, from
Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).


3) You say, "As DIY customers become aware of the significant potential health and safety risks of installing lead
contaminated tiles from The Tile Shop in their homes, the economic consequences for The Tile Shop will be
catastrophic." Really? With no federal standards in place? With the apparent ubiquitous nature of lead in tile? And if
you're right, wouldn't the consequences for The Home Depot, Lowes, et. al. be equally catastrophic? Are you shorting
those retailers as well?


4) You say, "Customers will simply purchase tiles, a fungible commodity product, at other established retailers, such
as Home Depot and Lowe's, which utilize robust sourcing processes and procedures to ensure the safety of products
on their shelves, which will kill The Tile Shop's future revenue, cash flow, and store expansion plans." Robust
sourcing processes? If by that you mean the lowest priced suppliers from China and elsewhere, then maybe you're
right. But those customers will have to ignore the same date that you ignored: 74% (29 out of 39) of all the ceramic
tiles sampled contained detectable lead, with levels as high as 1,900 ppm. And none came from The Tile Shop.

Ape2Adam:


That is an interesting comment. I was thinking more about this last night and concluded that if I wanted to test
tile myself, I would have tile tested from HD and LOW to see how they stack up versus the tile from TTS. The
comment you reference from Scott Wolfson, is from 2010. Is no standard still in place? If a standard is now in
place, do you know where I could find it because I was having no luck searching for it? Also I was looking at
the study results that you noted and was there any differences between the tile tested in that study and the
tile tested by the author? It would actually seem that the lead content of the tile tested by the author is much
lower than the lead content in the tile that was tested by healthystuff.org. Is that statement true or am I
misinterpreting the results of the two studies? I have read a few short write-ups on this name in the past and
the only new part to me was the tile testing. However, it seems right now that the standard to which the author
was making a comparison would not be a good standard. It would be interesting to see results of testing of 10
randomly chosen samples that are comparable from TTS, HD, and LOW.

Your allegations of fraud re Mr. Rucker are overstated because it's civil fraud, not criminal fraud. This is a very
common occurrence in divorce proceedings. Any misrepresentation, concealment, etc. of any material information
(almost always a financial asset) is considered fraud in a civil case. Any time there is a "War of the Roses" there will
be disputes over the ownership and value of assets. A messy divorce, while potentially embarrassing when certain
details are disclosed, does not necessarily reflect poorly on a person's business leadership skills or ethics. You
provide no evidence that Mr. Rucker's business integrity is in question, merely that he and his former wife parted ways
in an acrimonious fashion. This happens all the time all over world.

free...


Also it comes into question that your sample size is only 2 tiles per line. Aside from the fact that sampling is very
minute to compare to a nation wide chain's inventory, what scientific body would claim a conclusive result based on 3
lines of tile and only 2 samples per line?

Being that this company sells samples and takes returns on those samples as well as being home to contractors who
traffic the stores daily to and from jobsites, could the possible contamination come from other environmental
conditions BEFORE they were acquired for this test?

this company will not want to evoke any sort of discussion of the word LEAD.


23 Oct 2013, 09:14 AM


No Mean Sum, Contributor
Here's my take away.


1. The lead claims are interesting but not substantiated, and I find it unlikely that any action will be forthcoming as a
result of the authors findings.


2. Management is obviously not of the highest caliber and this should be a concern for investors. I find especially
troubling the involvement of the individual who was a board member at Enron.


3. The firm seems, at least to me, to be inadequately capitalized and should take immediate action to increase cash
levels.

4. I would rank margin contraction as a real concern given the mediocre quality of the management, comparatively
short track record of the business, the focus on expansion and the competitive nature of the industry.


In sum, it's not a mouth watering short but I wouldn't sleep well parking my own or anyone else's money with this
company.

what do you think we should do, take a 13 pc loss and sell out? I believe this is perhaps a good entry point.


Lead? As already pointed out, the same story persists with HD, LOEWS etc... tiles are vitrified and encapsulated.


23 Oct 2013, 01:25 PM

looks like we have bottomed out with $TTS ... will hold till we reach equitable valuation.


There is no justification in panicking and selling when everyone else is - not in the face of 0 facts ... it is common
knowledge since forever as far as dubious records on part of the officers, likewise, the whole industry has lead
content in tiles (though one can single a particular company)...


No justification in punishing for high EBITDA or growth prone-ness, not unless there is a FORMAL investigation ...

The company has answered - though not directly, by scheduling the 3Q call. Thats good - because as they say, when

Anyways at the call, thats when all this is going to be answered threadbare fashion. It appears ATM that the stock will
see up side till the 30th Oct, atleast when I believe the call is scheduled for ... then on, it will be dependent on what
comes out.

FWIW, I read the Q2 Earnings Call transcript yesterday and the company stated that Q3 (historically)has been their
weakest quarter, I also went to glassdoor.com & indeed.com to read the 'employee reviews' of TTS. Salary is
commission based. One unhappy employee (from Aug. 27, 2013 review on glassdoor) claims that in Scarsdale, NY

The real problem with the company is a flawed business model supporting a PE of near 50. See my comments on
Yahoo message board including August 9th post. Store count in 2012 increased 28% from 53 to 68 , however income
from operations increased a mere 5.5%. (2012 10-K). Insider sales since March 31 totaled 5,587,996 valued at
$126,942,000. During the past year the President and CEO has reduced his ownership from 21.6% to 11.8% (SEC
Schedule 13D) by selling 2,060,252 shares valued at $46,276,086. I'm short for these and other reasons. I want my
trade to be on the same side of what the insiders and management are doing and not what they are saying. Be sure
to focus on the actual numbers and not management "adjusted" EBITDA. Management promoting a stock while they
are personally selling their shares is an all too familiar story that usually has a sad ending.

I beg to differ. Today's Gotham report. as this article has, also contained some of the lead research, noted the
Chan connection, the management issues, and the unsustainable margins. Gotham really got to the bottom of
the margins, but Infitialis was rightfully skeptical. The bottom line is that few contributors or commentators on
Seeking Alpha dig this deep, let alone study the public filings. Those that do deserve a high five and I just
hope they stick around because articles that say sell or short are generally lambasted by the masses here.

The Gotham report is clear: TTS uses an undisclosed related party to overstate earnings. This is what made the stock

I was a buyer in the ceramic tile business for almost 30 yrs. Lead is not an issue. You could use a piece of ceramic tile
as a plate for your baby to eat off of. Everyone selling tile is looking to buy from the cheapest source that has reliable
availability, which is usually in China. Tile Shop finds a successful tile from, say, Italy or Spain, and they get a Chinese
factory to copy it so they can buy it for less. Their margins are not inflated. My company bought many of the same
products, so I know what the cost is. Home Depot and Lowe's are used as comparables only because there are no
other comparable TILE stores. Those two are total home improvement stores with a history of taking a category and
selling for much less than local stores in order to eliminate the competition. They have small tile departments--they
are not tile stores. The only similarity they have with Tile Shop is the multiple stores. Individual tile stores work on
margins between 30-50%, like the one I ran. The Tile Shop's margins average 67%. I know because like I said, I
imported many of the same tiles, and I also later worked at a Tile Shop for two years. Their prices are much higher
than their competitors, but because the sales staff is on commission, they will always discount to a more reasonable
price rather than lose a sale. Tile Shop is selling not just tile, but tile as fashion. They spend a TON of money on their
displays to get customers to fall in love with what they see, and envision it in their own house. While some
competitors might have a dozen full room vignettes, Tile Shop has about 40. Their sample boards are all grouted
boards, giving a much better idea of the finished product than looking at one loose piece of tile. The return policy is
actually a sales feature, and stores like Kohls have easy return policies for the same reason: the customer feels more
comfortable making a purchase if they know there won't be a hassle if they change their mind. Also, 60-70% of Tile
Shop's sales are from their natural stone, and there is no retailer with a comparable array of styles, sizes and trim

pieces, and the margins on natural stone are much better than ceramic tile. Their margins are sustainable, and even if
they move downward a little, they are still better than their real comparables--other tile stores. Do the math: if the
margin at retail price is 72%, you can give a 25% discount and still end up with a 63% margin--a margin any tile
retailer would kill to average. 
In my opinion this whole article was written in hopes of driving the stock price down, which is what you want if you are
selling the stock short. Oh, and that stupid remark about Robert Rucker shortchanging the mother of his son--give me
a break! It sounds like a typical divorce when there's big money involved. And by the way, that son he was
