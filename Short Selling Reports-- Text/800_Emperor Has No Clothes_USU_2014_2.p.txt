USEC Inc. - Still Disconnected From Reality

Summary


USU’s stock continues to ignore fundamentals and retains an over 80% likely
decline in value within the next day, or week if not.


Post reorganization, with convertible note holders taking the lion share of value,
equity holders will be left with less than 5% of the reorganized equity.


With the confirmation hearing set for today, USU’s chapter 11 bankruptcy should be
completed in short order.


There has been no news to change the story or fundamentals in recent months.


Revisiting my thesis


USEC Inc. (USU) continues to trade well above intrinsic value. I started to follow the name
and laid out my thesis in early July here. At the time, the stock was up 250% on no news
and not much has changed since then. With this bankruptcy process all but tied up with
the confirmation hearing set for today, the majority of the share value will fall to
noteholders. In this case, noteholders are set to receive 79% of the new equity, previous
preferred equity holders will receive 16% and the remaining minor component of 5% will
fall to current equity (as announced in the definitive agreement in March 2014).


Based on the August 18, 2014 press release, with support from 99% of noteholders and
both preferred equity holders, the confirmation hearing should be a mere formality.


It is my view that the stock continues to trade significantly above fundamental valuation
and that USU's stock will fall over 80%. This checks out based on simple math that I
provide below.

This effectively says if the current bond pricing is an indication of the value of the
company, which implies that the new enterprise value will be $196 million ($530 million x
37 cents on the dollar). If the new bonds trade at 60 cents on the dollar, which I deem to
be low, that would leave $96 million of value for the entire amount of the new equity ($196
million less 60 cents multiplied by $200 million new bonds grossed up by 79% which is
what noteholders are scheduled to receive). If current equity holders will receive 5% of
this, that will leave them with an 81% loss on their current investment (they will receive 5%
of the $96 million divided by 4.9 million shares). Current equity holders will receive $0.97
per share.


Timeline | Bankruptcy completed in the next two weeks


The confirmation hearing is set for today at 1pm in Delaware. Confirmation is often
imminent after this point but can take up to a week or two. This is all aligned with
management guidance of a bankruptcy by the end of summer or by September 18, 2014.


Conclusion | Irrational


With bankruptcy expected to be all but sewn up by the time the $530 million bonds are
due on October 1, 2014, the drop in equity value is expected in short order. Please review
my first article on USU for additional details on the company and the situation.


USU's stock is set to fall over 80%.

Confirmation is always, not often, immediate. What's not immediate is the effective date which takes one day to some
weeks.

"USEC Inc. - Still Disconnected From Reality" Bingo, spot-on, and you nailed 'er! 
I'd tried telling management that years ago before the reverse split! Its never a good idea in my "IN MY HO" to invest
in an underlying that gets its funding solely from the government (DOE) or other programs!

Why would usu be bankrupt? From the 6.30 #'s http://1.usa.gov/1rPWB7F they had current assets of 745.0m and
current liabilities of 329.1m.


Also article states that 530m of bonds are due 10.01. Not per the 6.30 financials (ie. it should be reflected in current
liabilities)

(USU) continues to revert to making sense, down another 5% or so after hours. With several bucks short, I'm going to
use some of my profits to treat the kids to $0.11 ice cream scoops offered until 10PM tonight at the New Canaan

REALITY: The author has missed key facts about uranium tails valuation and (USU) subsidiaries.


That said, in addition to the brewing debate in other arenas about proper valuation of uranium tails, here is today's
GOOD NEWS: The sky did not fall.


* Court Confirms USEC Inc. Plan of Reorganization *


Company Will Emerge in September as Centrus Energy Corp.


BETHESDA, Md. - USEC Inc. (NYSE: USU) today announced that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware has confirmed the Company’s Plan of Reorganization and that it will emerge from Chapter 11 restructuring
under the name Centrus Energy Corp. when the Plan becomes effective later in September. 
The confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization is the last major court step in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process that
USEC began March 5, 2014. The Plan received overwhelming support from investors who hold the Company’s
convertible notes and preferred equity. The Company anticipates that the Plan will become effective later in
September, subject to satisfying all conditions for emergence from bankruptcy established under the Plan. The new
common stock to be issued under the Plan is also expected to begin trading on the effective date. The new common
stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “LEU”.


“We are completing the final steps of a restructuring process that will strengthen our balance sheet and will enable the
company to build on its decades of reliability and technical innovation,” said John Welch, president and chief
executive officer of USEC Inc. “Since our voluntary filing in March, we have moved to accomplish the objectives of
this process. We are now in a stronger position to continue serving the nuclear fuel needs of our utility customers
around the world and the national and energy security needs of the United States.


“I want to thank our customers, suppliers, business partners and our employees for their support throughout this
process. With their backing, we have taken a major step forward and are prepared to move ahead as Centrus Energy
Corp.,” Welch said.


The reorganization addresses the October 2014 maturity of the Company’s convertible notes and strengthens the
company’s balance sheet. On the effective date, USEC will replace its $530 million debt and its preferred stock with a
new debt issue totaling $240.4 million and new common stock. The new debt issue would mature in five years and
can be extended for an additional five years subject to certain conditions. The noteholders would receive $200 million
of the new debt and approximately 79 percent of the common stock. Preferred investors would each receive $20.19
million of the new debt and approximately 8 percent of the new common stock. Current common stockholders would
receive approximately 5 percent of the new common stock in exchange for the existing common stock. Distribution of
the new common stock is subject to dilution on account of a new management incentive plan.

Furthermore, you assume present bond prices are rationally priced, therefore, you are implicitly relying upon the
efficient market hypothesis, citing the difference in prices at P-zero of financial instruments (--of a company
EMERGING from bankruptcy--) all as a predictor of future equity performance. However, you then equivocate and
cherry pick (USU) equities as bad.


"What if" you're wrong and certain information has been restricted in the interest of NATIONAL SECURITY (yes, this
happens) and, consequently, you might have no idea what this company is worth and how much a shareholder will
lose or gain? You fail to address the positives of emerging from bankruptcy and the great timing to invest in uranium
and uranium operations since 2011.


Very truly yours,

Those buying the bond at these prices are the same people who are going to get the shares. So it doesn't
matter whether you think the bonds are rationally priced. They can sell profitably all the way to $1.

I saw nothing in the analysis relating to a valuation analysis, this is completely a view on market pricing which long
term any fool knows is irrelevant. What is the valuation of the stock if you add up all the assets and in parallel the
earning power of the firm....then compare that to the prices...until you do that you are just speculating as a short
seller.


12 Sep 2014, 10:34 AM


Anastasios Dimopoulos, Contributor
The situation is even worse if you do such analysis. That's why the bankruptcy judge on the first day of the
hearings said about the following: "Why even bother with a restructuring? You will have problems again down
the road. why not just close shop?"

It is respectful to properly write the Judge's name, and citation of their exact words, so as not to make a
mistake in what appears is your speaking on behalf of a Federal Judge. With respect to financial analysis,
and despite the efforts of the shorts to drag USEC through the mud, common shares are still being bought
and held.


Almost 25% of the holdings are institutional investors.


I am not going to hold one's hand and give them all the answers by turning over my research.


I look forward to October, the 5%, and future share performance.


I expect a buy rating on the new ticker.


Also, remember, it's all relative. Where's the author's analysis of the industry and peers? Does the author
know anything about tails?


Sincerely,


E.A.
