Hyliion Holdings Corp. (NYSE: HYLN) (“Hyliion” or the “Company”) is a US$ 4.5 billion market cap company 


that claims its current hybrid technology can be retrofitted to any Class 8 diesel truck for an immediate 30% fuel 


efficiency savings.   





There is not one scientific paper or submission that would back up Founder & CEO Thomas Healy’s 30% fuel 


efficiency claim.  





Evidence revealed that Hyliion’s proprietary battery management system technology was purchased for under US$ 1 


million, equal to less than US$ 0.01 per Hyliion share! 





On October 15, Jim Cramer’s Mad Money cautioned investors to be patient and that Hyliion is not a buy at these 


levels.  If the bobblehead pundit doesn’t think your stock is a buy, who does?

HYLIION’S KEY TECH PURCHASED FOR LESS THAN US$ 1 MILLION 





Electric vehicles are heavily reliant on batteries and battery management systems (“BMS”) to store captured kinetic 


energy when going downhill or decelerating and deploy the energy effectively when required.  





Hyliion’s June 2020 PPT presentation disclosed that its primary BMS tech was purchased from a public company in 


2018.  Desktop research revealed that Hyliion’s BMS system was acquired from Gentherm Inc. (Nasdaq: THRM, 


“Gentherm”) for less than US$ 1 million. 





 
Source: Hyliion Investor Presentation https://s25.q4cdn.com/501989927/files/doc_downloads/Hyliion-Tortoise-Overview-Presentation.pdf 





We spoke to a former manager with almost 2 decades of experience in BMS who was in charge of both Gentherm & 


Hyliion’s Battery Tech Center (“BMS Manager”).  The BMS Manager told us that Gentherm supplied the complete 


battery solution for Hyliion’s Hybrid 6x4HE (“Hybrid-X”) system.  





“Hyliion was our only customer for a certain battery that we made called a ‘Slick’”.    





The BMS Manager also revealed that Healy grossly exaggerated demand for Hyliion’s Hybrid-X system which 


strained relationships between Gentherm and Healy: 





“Hyliion ran this financial stuff, they were extremely optimistic about revenue projections, and they overdid that so 


they had to retract so they pulled.” 





“Hyliion was saying we need all these batteries, these huge numbers the forecast, and then it gets smaller and smaller, 


and we at Gentherm were trying to figure out … because it keeps changing” 





When asked directly about the 30% fuel efficiency claim, the BMS Manager simply said: 





“They are touting 30% or 30%+. I think it might be that same exaggeration because I just don’t see that as being 


even possible, you know, just on a pure Physics level.” 





After two years in operation, Gentherm’s total tech R&D investment in the BMS system was US$ 1.8 million.1  


Gentherm sold its BMS division in 2018 to Hyliion for US$ 698,000 in cash and recorded a loss of US$1.1 million. 





If Gentherm’s BMS technology was revolutionary, Gentherm wouldn’t have sold the two year old division to Hyliion 


at a 60%+ loss.

DANA NOT INTERESTED IN USING HYLIION SOLUTION THEMSELVES 





“Since Day 1 of the inception of Hyliion it’s been on Dana axles” – Thomas Healy, March 20192  





In 2019, Dana Inc. (NYSE: DAN, “Dana”) invested in Hyliion, had a Hyliion board seat pre-SPAC reverse merger, 


and was a key supplier offering Hyliion full drivetrain solutions including e-axles, motors, inverters, thermal 


management solutions, driveshafts, etc.3  This put Dana in the best possible position to understand the commercial 


viability of Hyliion’s hybrid powertrain. 





In 2018, Dana highlighted that besides Hyliion, Dana partnered with Nordresa and Spicer to customize and convert 


fleet trucks into hybrid electric solutions. Since then, Dana had acquired Nordresa, the SME Group, Rational Motion 


(both in Europe), TM4 (in Canada) and a few others to boost its electric truck capability with a complete in-house 


solution. Rational Motion’s client list and partnerships include Toyota, Borg Warner and John Deere, to name a few.4

In its 2Q’20 earnings release, Dana disclosed its 3rd significant electric truck program which uses Dana’s own 


proprietary powertrain solution, not Hyliion’s product.  


 
Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/26780/000119312520203346/d948072dex991.htm 





A Dana technical manager familiar with the matter concurred with the BMS Manager on Hyliion’s 30% fuel effiency 


claim and stated “30%? Not sure that’s really going to be attainable.” 





He also confirmed that Dana is not using any of Hyliion’s technology. 


Dana continues to implement strategic developments to create an in-house electric solution of their own without 


Hyliion. What does that say about Hyliion’s technology?

HISTORY OF FAILED PILOT PROGRAMS  





Hyliion’s Hybrid-X failed to generate follow-on orders.  





In May 2019, after two years of testing Hyliion’s Hybrid-X product, P.A.M. Transportation Services Inc. (Nasdaq: 


PTSI, “PAM”) abandoned Hyliion’s Hybrid-X because savings were “only a small %”.5   





Paul Pettit, vice president of maintenance for PAM was quoted: 





“We’re one of the original fleets to prototype this unit with the folks we’re testing it with.”  





“So we’ve been going through repairs, upgrades from their beta test all the way through their production unit, with 


this unit. Just helping them get it out on the road, get testing data back and make adjustments and do it as they work 


through them.” 





“The goal is for a 30% improvement in fuel economy, and so far, the savings has only been a small percentage.” 





Healy claimed Hyliion had partnered with 50+ companies/organizations to test and roll out its hybrid technology in 


the last 5 years.  Similar to PAM, most disclosed “customers” have not placed follow-on orders. A review of Hyliion’s 


publicly disclosed customers from historical presentations is summarized below:

As of June 2020, Hyliion claimed it had its Hybrid-X truck deployed with at least 7 customers.

Only 3 of the 7 “customers” listed in Hyliion’s PPT appear to have purchased any Hybrid-X systems.  We identified 


a total of 7 systems sold to the above list of “customers today”, specifically 2 to Wegmans, 3 to Penske, and 2 to Eagle 


Transport.6   





Ryder System Inc. (NYSE: R, “Ryder”), another fleet operator, was “testing” Hyliion’s product but appears to have 


little interest in placing follow-on orders. 





 
Source: https://www.trucks.com/2018/11/08/hyliion-pitches-e-axles-eyes-international-growth/  





Ryder’s website listed Chanje and Workhorse as their strategic partners under “Advanced Vehicle Technology” 


towards “fuel efficiency and innovation”.  Hyliion is not listed here or anywhere else on Ryder’s website.  





 
Source: https://ryder.com/solutions/fleet-leasing/advanced-vehicle-technology  





Hyliion listed Idealease, Inc. (“Idealease”) as a customer in its June 2020 PPT presenation.  However, Idealease did 


not buy a single Hyliion Hybrid-X system.  Instead, Hyliion gave one demo truck to Idealease to showcase at their 


dealerships in North America.  Since when does a company call the recipient of a free sample a “customer”? 





 
Source: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200819005438/en/Hyliion-Dana-Join-Forces-Idealease-Demonstrate-Hybrid 





We believe Hyliion failed to get follow-on orders for its Hybrid-X retrofit because its fuel efficiency claim is a lie.

30% FUEL SAVING CLAIM DESPITE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TECH AND DESIGN  





Regardless of Hyliion’s product developments, Healy stuck to his claim of 30% fuel efficiency savings for Class 8 


diesel trucks.  





We think Healy adopted a “lie ‘til you die” approach to his first foray into the public markets by applying the same 


efficiency statistics from his college trailer dorm room project to every Hyliion product iteration since.  





In 2015 and 2016, Healy’s design was trailer-based and claimed 30% fuel reduction. 





 
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q_bgiwFbBI ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyu0FSXJypg  





In a 2016 investor presentation to European investors, Healy is seen multiple times over-embellishing Hyliion’s 


product capabilities, partnerships, accolades, and fleet pilot programs for Hyliion’s trailer product. Healy claimed: 





“30+ fleets in pilot program including McDonalds” 





“30%  fuel reduction” 





“1 month payback” 





“We already have multiple demos out in the US that are proving out this fuel savings.”  





“Retrofit Product. Takes only 1 to 2 hours to install and can fit on all trailers on the road”.  





 
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q_bgiwFbBI 





In an August 2017 interview Healy claimed to work with 50+ fleets and that installation time was down to 15 minutes: 





“In the US here we are working with about 50 fleets. Just a couple weeks ago we signed on the largest seller of foods 


who is going to be bringing the technology over to Europe.”  





“5 Fleets in the US that will start deploying at the end of this summer”

In November 2017, Hyliion’s design switched from the trailer to the tractor (front part of the truck).  Despite the 


product location change from trailer to tractor, Healy maintained his 30% fuel efficiency claim for the Hyliion’s 


Hybrid-X.

In a July 2018 article Healy explicitly stated that its Hybrid-X delivers fuel savings up to 30%.

In 2018 – 2019, Hyliion’s design underwent further changes after it acquired Gentherm’s BMS division and partnered 


with Dana.  Regardless of these developments, Healy stuck to the 30% fuel efficiency savings claim.7 





Repeating the same lies does not turn the lie into a truth.  





The BMS Manager, who had intricate knowledge of Hyliion’s Hybrid-X system, said that Healy’s 30% fuel efficiency 


savings claim was “not even possible on a pure Physics level.” 





As of October 2020, neither Hyliion or any of its customers, partners, or test pilot programs have presented evidence 


of 30% fuel efficiency savings.   





Agility Public Warehousing Company K.S.C.P. (DFM: AGLTY, “Agility”)’s 1,000 Hypertruck ERX pre-order gave 


investors confidence that fleet operators have interest in Hyliion’s powertrain systems, but unless Hyliion can 


magically deliver on its 30% fuel efficiency claim, Agility appears no more than an opportunistic PIPE investor around 


a hyped SPAC deal.  





In our opinion, Healy’s claims are filled with over-embellishment, lies and false promises.  We think that Hyliion 


would be better off with a truthful honest leadership that already has longstanding stellar reputation for engineering 


safety, product warranties, and a higher level of integrity regarding economic benefits to fleets and truck drivers.

FAKE NASA CREDENTIAL 





Healy’s exaggerations extended to his list of accomplishments.  





We confirmed that Hyliion won the 2015 Rice University Business Plan Competition whereby Hyliion received US$ 


150,000+ in prize money.8  The U.S. Department of Energy and Shell were sponsors of the 2015 Rice Business Plan 


competition and Autodesk was a sponsor of the 2015 Mass Challenge, yet Healy claimed the competition sponsors 


were “partners” on its website.9  





 
Source: Wayback Machine 





Healy was not truthful with other tech challenges.  Healy claimed Hyliion won the “Nasa Create the Future Award”.   


Turns out the supposed “NASA” award was run by a techology magazine publisher, Tech Briefs Media Group, not 


NASA.

HYPERTRUCK ERX TECH SUPPORTED BY ZERO HYLIION PATENTS 





A search for Hyliion’s patents on the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) website revealed that all 


of Hyliion’s 12 patents refer to a trailer or tractor based system that captures downhill and/or deceleration kinetic 


energy.

Hyliion’s latest Hypertruck ERX is an electric & natural gas-powered truck. Hyliion holds no patent on renewable 


natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquified natural gas (LNG) or any other form of natural gas.  


Hyliion appears years behind competing technology for natural gas-powered trucks. 





For example, in October 2016 Volvo unveiled its Euro 6-compliant 4×2 FE-320 CNG (Compressed Natural Gas)-


fuelled rigid.10   





A search for Volvo in the USPTO database revealed 2,930 assigned patents, including numerous examples of system 


and device technology patents directly related to manufacturing a natural gas-powered truck.   





Specifically, a search of Volvo’s patents relating to “gaseous fuel” generated 15 results with many focused on crucial 


safety arrangements.

WARRANTY CLAIM UNTRUE 





Since Hyliion’s Hybrid-X product is a retrofit, does Hyliion take on the risk of system failure?  Who is liable if 


something breaks after a truck has been modified from the factory?   





Hyliion’s Hybrid-X is not an authorized retrofit, so what happens if a truck driver retrofits a new Peterbilt with a 


Hyliion powertrain system and the truck loses power brakes or steering?   Who is liable if a truck carrying 80,000 


pound payloads going 70 miles per hour gets out of control and kills someone?  





US and European highway safety requirements are strict for a reason.  We think this is why Dana (and others) decided 


to lauch a complete in-house soultion so that Freightliner or Peterbilt can be comfortable working with a proven 


counterparty with product accredation.  





In a July 2020 interview, Healy clearly stated that its Hybrid-X retrofit “does not affect the warranty of the truck”.   





 
Source:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oarWCCH5AIU 





Healy told the Gentherm management the same lie.  When asked about warranty, the BMS Manager told us that:  





“Hyliion was saying … apparently they had the buy-in from Peterbilt specifically on what they were doing. And not 


only that, they were working on a deal where somebody that wants to buy a new truck from Peterbilt could click a box 


on the order form and get the Hyliion system installed when it was delivered to the customer.” 





However, the BMS Manager revealed that when Gentherm management questioned PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ: PCAR, 


“PACCAR”), the parent company of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, about Hyliion’s warranty claim, PACCAR said 


that “there is no way in hell [PACCAR] would allow that.” 





We understand why OEM’s do not want their trucks retrofitted with an unauthorized third party electrical systems.  


There is too much risk.  





Since its SPAC reverse-merger, Hyliion is cash rich and can potenitally buy their way into a viable commercial 


product.  However, with Healy at the helm lying to investors and partners about key developments and economic 


efficiencies, time will tell what happens next.   





We are short Hyliion and believe its stock is going lower.
