HSTM


HealthStream reported a dismal Q1 which confirms my assessment that the
underlying business segments are slow growth, low-margin businesses not worthy
of the lofty valuation.


HealthStream is not a High-Growth SaaS company, but it is valued like one.
HealthStream's valuation is downright crazy. Forward P/E of 55, PEG 4.5, and
EV/EBITDA of 19.4.


HealthStream has pursued multiple value-destroying acquisitions in order to keep
revenue growth high and investors excited about its future prospects.


We believe a fair value for HSTM is around $13-$13.5 a share or 40% downside.

HealthStream (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:HSTM) is a perfect example of a company that gets
an unrealistic valuation based on analysts incorrectly believing the company is
something that it is not. The company provides Training, Surveys, and Credentialing
software for the Healthcare industry. HealthStream technically uses a Software as a
Service (SAAS) model, but it lacks the same economics of most other SaaS companies
namely high gross margins and high revenue growth.


It is an HR software company, not a Healthcare software company. It provides low-value
services highlighted by its comparatively low gross margins to other HR SaaS
companies like Paycom (PAYC), Workday (NYSE:WDAY) and Ultimate Software
(NASDAQ:ULTI). Please see my article, 'Software Ate The World And It's About To
Come Out The Other End', for a summary of how the SaaS business model works.


ICD-10 Explanation & Underlying Business Segments


HealthStream had a big one-time increase in revenues in 2013, 2014, and 2015 related
to their ICD-10 preparedness training software. ICD-10 is a medical naming convention
industry standard that is updated periodically by the medical industry. ICD-10 was
implemented in October of 2015 and all relevant medical employees had to complete
training on it prior to that time.


HealthStream's ICD-10 revenues and profits are going away in 2016 (the company
projects $7m in 2016 and $0m in 2017). ICD-10 revenues were $28.4m in 2014 and
$27m in 2015. On the back of this one-time growth, the company posted revenue
growth rates of 27.5%, 25.6% and 22.9% in 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively. Why is
this important to the short thesis if the ICD-10 business is already gone? Because when
you remove the ICD-10 business and view the underlying business segments, you
realize they are a slow growth, low-margin businesses.


HealthStream operates three segments: Workforce Solutions (Training), Patient
Experience (Surveys), and Provider Solutions (Credentialing). ICD-10 Revenues are
included in the Workforce Solutions business segment, but for my analysis, I will break
ICD-10 out separately into its own line item to highlight Revenue Growth. Here is the
Historical Revenue, Revenue Growth and Operating Profit by segment.

Thoughts on each segment:


While Workforce Solutions is both fast growing and profitable, it is in part due to the
acquisitions that HealthStream has made in recent years (see below acquisition
discussion). Workforce Solutions Operating Margins have been declining for the last
4 years and now sit below 25% from above 30% a few years ago. The decline may
be due to ICD-10 revenues which have a lower margin, but that might be only a
partial explanation to cover up a declining pricing environment for training software.


1.


Patient Experiences is essentially a profitless and slow-growing segment. The
surveys product is offered to existing clients more to retain business than to be
profitable.


2.


Provider Solutions is a combination of two previous acquisitions, Healthline Systems
and Sy.Med. Currently, the segment is unprofitable but will likely contribute to most of
the revenue growth in 2016. The company projected 80 to 84% growth in the
Provider Solutions segment for 2016.


3.
ICD-10 - Still $7m in revenues projected in 2016 that is going away for sure by 2017.4.


HealthStream's fast growing Provider Solutions segment is its most unprofitable
segment that currently runs at an operating loss. Its Patient Experience segment (which
is 16% of revenues) is essentially run at close to cost. Workforce Solutions is the bread
and butter of the company but its growth rate has fluctuated between the high teens and
low 20s (partially due to acquisition revenues). I believe a go forward rate for the
Workforce Solutions business as best case 20%, but may well be lower. Based on the
company's current guidance for 2016 revenue growth for Workforce Solutions excluding
ICD-10 is about 18-20%. Here are my go forward projections of the business.


Acquisitions: Chasing Revenue not Value Creating



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/5/9/602510-14628519444847045_origin.jpg
Revenue Growth has not been all organic, as it has been augmented by acquisitions.
HealthStream is a serial acquirer, having made four acquisitions since 2012 (Sy.Med
[Oct 2012], Baptist Leadership Group [Sept 2013], Health Care Compliance Strategies
[March 2014], and Healthline Systems [March 2016]). Most if not all of these
acquisitions were made in order to keep the revenue growth rate high and have not
been value added for shareholders. Between 2012 and 2015, their operating margins
have declined from 12.9% to 6.5%, ROIC has declined from 19.9% to 9.6%, and ROE
has declined from 6.04% to 3.9%. Q1 2016 results showed further deterioration in all
three metrics, hitting lows of 4.6%, 4.5%, and 2.1% respectively.


HealthStream wants investors to believe that it is a high growth, technology-driven SaaS
company. In order to keep investors buying that story, they need to keep revenues
growing at a fast pace above 25%. Acquisitions have been used to accomplish that,
while they have driven down every single profitability metric in the process. They have
sacrificed profitability to keep revenue growth high to keep investors interested and
paying a huge valuation multiple. The company currently has a TTM P/E of 91 and a
consensus forward P/E of 54 (which I don't believe at all; Forward P/E is likely around
75). The valuation of HealthStream is very high even for an actual high growth SaaS
company with a high value product.


Valuation



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/5/9/602510-14628492177853582_origin.jpg
HealthStream as I highlighted above is actually three separate and distinct businesses
with wildly different growth rates, operating margins, and future prospects. To properly
value the company, I used both a Sum of the Parts (SOTP) analysis and a basic DCF
analysis to gauge the breadth of the valuation. The Workforce Solutions business is by
far the most attractive business between the three due to the high growth rate and
higher margins.


The least desirable business is the slow-growing, low-margin Patient Solutions
business, which in turn should yield a much low valuation. The Provider Solutions
business currently operates at a loss, so in order to value it, I assumed it would have
long-term operating margins of 20% that they would achieve by 2018 (very optimistic).
In my SOTP calculation, I used 2018 as the first "clean" year in which target margins for
each segment were achieved and applied a conservative valuation to each segment. I
then backed out taxes and discounted that value back to 2016 using the Cost of Capital
of 10%, as they have no debt.

My DCF Analysis yielded a base case valuation of $11.11, while my SOTP analysis
yielded a base cash valuation of $15. No surprise that both were well below the current
sky-high valuation. To error on the side of being conservative, I suggest that $13-13.5 is
likely a fair valuation of HealthStream.


Conclusion


HealthStream has enjoyed a premium valuation for far too long. Viewing the company's
current three business segments, you can see that the currently sky-high valuation does
not make sense in light of low sustained profitability in the Patient Experience Solutions
segment, the current negative operating margins at the Provider Solutions business,
and the uncertainty around future revenue growth rates.

HealthStream returns metrics including ROIC and ROE have been in constant decline
since they set out on a series of acquisitions that have helped sustain high revenue
growth rates that the underlying business segments could not provide. Management has
shown no ability to acquire and integrate profitable businesses over the last four years.
Acquisitions are core to the company's growth strategy, which is troubling based on the
recent financial trends. I believe that HealthStream is a great short candidate and I
believe a fair value for the company is $13-13.5 per share.
