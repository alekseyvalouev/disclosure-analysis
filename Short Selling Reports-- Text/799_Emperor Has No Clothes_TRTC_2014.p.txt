Terra Tech: A Natural-Born Capital Killer
Jun. 6, 2014 2:50 PM ET657 comments
by: The Emperor Has No Clothes


Summary


Thomas Puzzo (attorney) has a long history of providing shells to scam companies.
TRTC was built to be a promotion.


It is unlikely that TRTC will receive any license from Clark County; Derek Peterson,
CEO, and Michael Nahass, Director, have both individually filed for bankruptcy in the
past four years.


Derek Peterson and his wife (Amy Almsteier, Treasurer) have been charged with
accepting illegally issued securities and selling these shares.


What is the CEO’s legal name and why did he change it?; Insiders have sold $1.1
million worth of stock.


Any fundamental valuation approach indicates the company has a downside of at
least 90%.


Introduction


Each stock appreciates in value for a variety of reasons, some of which include strong
management, a growing industry or fundamental valuation. In this report, I will get to the
bottom of each of these themes and how Terra Tech (OTCQX:TRTC) has none of them. In
addition, a tell-tale sign of dubious management is when a company's share price is being
driven by paid promotion and nothing else.


A promotion from cradle (and inevitably) to grave


Some stocks have an ever lasting impact from the circumstances that create it. In the
case of Terra Tech, it crawled out of the great stock promotion primordial ooze. It all
started with attorney Thomas Puzzo, who has set up shells for promotions over and over
(see his public company involvement). A few of his most successful pump and dump
creations include:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 2/163


All of these promotions resulted in shareholder losses of at least 90%. Puzzo followed a
similar pattern to set up the shell that eventually became TRTC (with his involvement
beginning in as early as 2008). It was originally a company called Private Secretary with
the symbol PVST. And the pattern was so clear that it would be a future promotion, an
internet researcher using the alias 'nodummy' identified it in December of 2011 with these
comments: "Here is another shell to keep an eye on in the future because it follows some
similar patterns with NSRS and RAYS: Private Secretary, Inc (PVST). If you see a change
in CEO and a name change/acquisition done by the PVST shell then the paid promotion
shouldn't be too far behind."


A few things made PVST an obvious choice for a future promotion shell. The first is that it
never made any real attempt at forming an actual business. In its original S-1, PVST
claimed to be entering the Voice Over IP business. Yet, it only had one employee at the
time, Maureen Frances Cotton. Maureen was 66 years old and the only experience she
had with telecommunications was a stint from 1959 - 1962 as a switchboard operator /
receptionist. Considering IP was not even invented at that time, the relevance of her
experience was highly questionable. Even worse, according to the S-1, "Mrs. Cotton is
employed elsewhere and has the flexibility to work on Private Secretary up to 10 hours per
week. She is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required. She is
not being paid at present."


The second big clue is despite the fact the only employee had no background in IP, was
only working part time and was not even being paid, is that PVST actually found investors.
In the last quarterly report (10-Q) before becoming TRTC, PVST reported having 48
million shares in the hands of anonymous 'investors'. These investors received these
shares for a fraction of a penny per share with no restriction on the trading of these shares
(making them completely free trading). As would be expected, PVST turned around and
did not make much use of investor money. In fact, it looks like Private Secretary just did
enough to keep the SEC filings current, but they ultimately walked away with lots of stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 3/163


And just as 'nodummy' had predicted, PVST acquired a private company called GrowOp
Technology Ltd. Its first step was to change Private Secretary to Terra Tech Corp and the
stock symbol PVST to TRTC. Next, the management of GrowOp assumed control and
management over the public company (see link). Derek Peterson took over the role of
CEO, while his wife Amy Almsteier became the Secretary, Treasurer, and Director. The
GrowOp owners got 34 million shares of common stock, as well as some convertible
preferred stock. Maureen Cotton had been the only employee of PVST for five years and
never received any compensation. As a reward for her service, all her shares were
cancelled. On the other hand, the anonymous investors with a de minimis cost base
retained all 48 million of their shares. With these shares spread across various
anonymous investors, they retained the ability to sell their holdings at their leisure -
meaning at any time and at any price.


This brings us to the third clue that TRTC was going to be a stock promotion. A typical
reverse takeover of this nature (with the public entity having negligible assets) will result in
existing shareholders retaining a minor stake in the new or merged entity (ie. 5% or less).
PVST had no assets, yet its anonymous shareholders retained 60% of the common stock
after the merger.


For what possible business reason and in exchange for what assets would GrowOp agree
to a deal like that? Why would Derek Peterson, a former investment banker, agree to a
deal with such unfavorable economics? The only value in the PVST shell was that it was a
public company. Remember that while Maureen Cotton cancelled her shares, the
anonymous PVST shareholders who contributed nothing to the business had a huge block
of freely trading shares. The obvious conclusion is two fold: Maureen Cotton was just a
figurehead; the real parties controlling the shell and now TRTC were the ones holding on
to those 48 million shares.


Refer to Appendix B for more information on Terra Tech and Derek Peterson's use of buzz
words outside of regulatory filings.


A very serious, repetitive and dedicated history with stock promotion


Putting aside all the issues that existed when the company was created, not much
changed with the acquisition of GrowOp, as it was never much of a business. At the time
of the merger, it had produced $630,000 of revenue over the previous 9 months, with a net
loss of $605,000 (see financial statements). However, at least there was some business
there that sold hydroponics equipment. This business was the key as it afforded
management the ability to use various buzz words to hype up the business like

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 4/163


'sustainable', 'renewable' and most importantly 'medical marijuana'. Fortunately for TRTC,
a few buzz words were all that it needed to fulfill its destiny to use promotion to advance
its stock price.


In August 2012, the emails went out from such sites as Phd-Trading.com,
StockParlay.com, PennyStockCheatSheets.com and PennyStockParlay.com touting TRTC
as their new 'Monster Pick' and that it was "poised to become one of the biggest names in
the agricultural industry". There was one common denominator, which was buried at the
bottom of each promotion email. A disclaimer that Red Brick Media had paid them to send
out the emails and that Red Brick Media "may have shares and may liquidate it". This
continued for a few weeks before a new group of promoters started sending out similar
emails - this time, interVCap LLC had paid for the marketing and the disclaimer noted that
interVCap "will sell shares of common stock of TRTC in the open market at any time
without notice". Not long thereafter, the promoters (Crème Dellatex Inc.) changed but the
game did not. One month after another, the promoters and the parties paying the
promoters changed, but the result was the same, an unidentified party paying for
promotion. Now why would unidentified parties pay for TRTC to be promoted?


Then the story finally changed a little. Perhaps TRTC got tired of operating through other
parties or perhaps they got lazy, but essentially they started to pay SmallCapVoice,
another prominent stock promoter, directly. Over the next 15 months, TRTC compensated
SmallCapVoice over $90,000 in cash and 450,000 shares of restricted stock. Not to be out
done, Red Brick Media shows up again in February of 2013, by spending a whopping
$550,000 on a promotion campaign managed by Capital Financial Media.


TRTC has been the subject of one of the broadest and most relentless promotional
campaigns I have ever seen. This is not surprising given how much effort is needed to
generate enough demand to dump 48 million shares of stock into the market. What is very
surprising is that Derek Peterson (CEO) continues to blatantly lie about the company's
involvement in any promotion throughout the campaign. In a December 2013 audio
interview with 420 Investor (Audio track beginning at 48:50), Peterson responds to a direct
question on the subject: "I have seen those things come through, we have an IR team…
there are what they call email lists out there, again I come from white shoe firms, me
learning how the penny stock world works was an eye opening experience, so there are
email lists out there that put out you know promotion on companies, and you know
generally those promotions result in sell offs and that type of thing down the line, so our
company does not engage in that type of activity…". Obviously Peterson was not aware
that his hired promoter had to disclose their compensation and SmallCapVoice makes it

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 5/163


perfectly clear that the company does engage in that type of activity (see link of
SmallCapVoice's current disclaimer): "TRTC: Small Cap Voice received five thousand
dollars from the company on 1-18-13 for 30 days of service. On 3-1-13 Small Cap Voice
signed a 180 day agreement for $2500 per month and 100,000 restricted shares subject
to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 for the six month term. On 3/26/13
SmallCapVoice.com received an additional $30,000 from the Company to manage an
investor awareness campaign on behalf of TRTC. SmallCapVoice.com, Inc. received cash
payment of $14,000 from the Company on 5/29/13 from the Company to manage an
investor awareness campaign on behalf of TRTC. On 9-1-13 Small Cap Voice signed a
180 day agreement for $2500 per month and 200,000 restricted shares subject to Rule
144 of the Securities Act of 1933 for the six month term. On 12-10-13 Small Cap Voice
received an additional cash budget of $10,000 to hire additional groups for awareness
campaign. On 4-1-14 Small Cap Voice signed a one year agreement for 150,000
restricted shares subject to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933". Never a good thing
when your CEO is caught lying.


If this was not enough, refer to Appendix I for more information on TRTC's history with
promotion.


A management team with skeletons in their closet


To hear him talk, you would think Derek Peterson was pure as the driven snow and just
shocked by all the things that happen with penny stocks. Now, we have already shown
that his comments were factually challenged, but there is more. Exactly who is Derek
Peterson? In October of 2010, The Telegraph UK, wrote an article and posted a video on
Derek and Amy Almsteier's hydroponics business and their slogan, 'The First Honest
Hydro Store'. As part of that 'honesty' Derek's last name was reported to be Oppedisano,
not Peterson. Derek Oppedisano - what is the CEO's legal name and why did he change
it? Terra Tech plays up the fact that Peterson was once an investment banker; however, if
he's so good with financials, why in 2012 did he personally file for bankruptcy "On
February 22, 2012, Mr. Peterson filed a petition for bankruptcy in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California". Peterson (or Oppedisano) did not
leave the world of 'white shoe firms' voluntarily. It turns out he was fired for not disclosing
his marijuana equipment side business.


Amy Almsteier, like her husband, has no business background of her own that would
qualify her to hold her current position as Treasurer. She maintains previous experience
as an interior designer. Rounding out the TRTC board, Michael Nahass, Director, filed for
bankruptcy likely due to casino debt in 2012.

As would be expected of a group of individuals, the controlling management of TRTC
were defendants in a lawsuit. In this lawsuit, Amy and her husband Derek, were
defendants in a case for wrongfully accepting over $300k through illegally traded
securities in 2009. They "accepted illegally-issued, unrestricted IEAM securities to which
they were not entitled, and which, upon information and belief, they resold for full market
value to the detriment of IEAM and its shareholders". Sounds like a group of people that
Thomas Puzzo would be delighted to involve in his quest for stock promotions. Refer to
appendix D for additional details.


Refer to Appendix C for a detailed account of Derek Peterson's questionable recent past.
See appendix E for additional details on Derek Peterson, Amy Almsteier, Michael Nahass
and the rest of management. Appendix F outlines players surrounding TRTC that have
similar issues. Appendix G highlights errors that the company has made in their filings.
Given Terra Tech has had various accounting and filing issues, it is not surprising that
management continues to deal with internal control issues noted in a recent filing,
Appendix H provides a summary of these control issues, going concern details and
shareholder dilution which seems imminent (more on this below).


A bad business as well


Penny stock investors are a forgiving lot. Even if the management of a company is
suspect… even if we do not even know what their real names are… even if they are
spending lots of money to promote the stock… and even if an unknown group controls a
huge block of free trading shares with a tiny cost basis… it could all be forgiven if the
business was actually decent. With marijuana in so many headlines, how could a business
in this hot industry be bad? Well, let me show you.


As previously described, GrowOp was not a big business and it was losing money when it
was merged with TRTC. Fast forward one year and realize that being a public company
had done nothing to help matters. GrowOp, at this time, was instead facing the reality of
shrinking operations. Sales in 2012 had fallen to $553,000 from $817,000 in 2011, a drop
of 32% (see source). Losses had increased as well.


Faced with this reign of incompetence, any business owner would be intently focused on
what to do to save the company. In the case of TRTC, the majority of the ownership was
held by the mysterious holders of stock left over from the PVST shell. Their solution was
obvious, do what they do best - another massive stock promotion. As the officers of TRTC
had stock that was not as easy to sell, they had to come up with another solution.

Apparently fixing the business or replacing management was out of the question, so in
order to stop the bleeding they decided to copy PVST and try to acquire another 'real'
business.


In January 2013, TRTC announced it was acquiring GroRite. GroRite was described as
one of New Jersey's largest gardening super centers with 10 acres of retail gardening
center, hydroponic cultivation facility and plant nursery. Derek Peterson stated: "GroRite's
facility is amazing, they carry everything a home gardener would need". And hopefully
they could provide exactly what TRTC desperately needed which was a viable business.
The press release stated that GroRite had "annual revenue in excess of $4 million with
positive net income" (source). This would have been a great addition, but TRTC did not
actually buy GroRite. The letter of intent to buy GroRite must have fallen through and they
ended up with the scraps, a cultivation business called Edible Garden.


At this stage, however, any addition of revenue would be helpful as the existing GrowOp
business was in free fall. Revenues for the first quarter of 2013 had plummeted to only
$66,000. With the Edible Garden's merger complete at the end of Q1 2013, revenue
seemed to have bounced back to $665,000 due to the Edible Garden integration in Q2
2013 (source). Although revenues were higher, cost of goods sold were as high as ever
$660,000. The remaining gross margin of $6,000 was nowhere near enough to cover
overhead, let alone make it a viable business.


However, the hype from this acquisition was not meant to last. By Q1 of 2014, sales were
plunging once again. Revenues were only $560,000, with cost of sales of $558,000 (latest
10-Q). That left only $2,000 of gross profit to cover a staggering $2.2 million of Selling,
General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses. At this level of gross margins, TRTC would
have to do over $500 million in sales per quarter just to cover their overhead. Appendix K
provides additional details on how the increase SG&A is another sign of promotion.


TRTC got lucky to be swept up in the marijuana craze


Terra Tech has had a going concern note attached to its financial statements for as long
as I can see. As early as March 31, 2012, the company continued to operate under this
red flag. During this same quarter, the company had a $16.7 million operating loss driven
primarily by $16.3 million of compensation expense. This expense did not show on the
financials subsequent to this 10-Q. Another unmistakable sign of a promotion story is
when management is being paid handsomely at the cost of shareholders. So why is this
company in the stock market?


TRTC stock chart has been a benefactor of following the marijuana index:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 8/163


As marijuana has been legalized in a couple of states and discussion of broader de-
criminalization efforts have hit the headlines, any company able to spell marijuana in a
press release has generated investor interest. Even though TRTC cannot seem to run an
actual business they have proven their ability to spell marijuana and put out press
releases. Combine that with the constant promotion resulting in various pumpers
spreading the word and all of a sudden TRTC has some hype. This hype has generated a
market capitalization of in excess of $200 million.


TRTC remains desperate to build more than a house of cards. However, it was never
meant to be anything more than just that. The stock has run over 100% in recent days on
more hopeless hype. In the past few months, management has started a new initiative in
Nevada, perhaps after realization that they have next to no marijuana operations.
Medifarm, a Terra Tech subsidiary has filed for four separate medical marijuana licenses in
Clark County, Nevada. Terra Tech's current hopes weigh on an application to become a
dispensary in Nevada. However, we believe regulators in Nevada are working diligently to
weed out (no pun intended) the poor applicants and just in case they miss this publicly
available diligence regarding Terra Tech and its dubious management team, a copy of
this diligence has been made available to them. As such, it is highly unlikely that the
company will receive the nod to dispense. The information laid out in this report implies a
low likelihood of a successful application in Nevada.


After all the hype, TRTC remains a glorified lettuce producer


Prior to the acquisition of Edible Gardens, TRTC's hydroponics business had faded away
to less than $100,000 of revenue per quarter. After the inclusion of Edible Gardens in Q2
of 2013, management discussed the increase in revenue and admitted that "The primary
reason was due the revenue generated from Edible Gardens." Certainly some people
have bought hydroponic equipment from TRTC to grow marijuana for either legal or illegal
purposes. But the reality is that almost all the business now is growing produce (source).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 9/163


But hold on, perhaps the company has intellectual property in hydroponics it can leverage
for fast growth? Unfortunately, it does not. Per the 2013 10-K, the business "ceased our
prior operations and we are now a holding company and our wholly owned subsidiary
engages in the design, marketing and sale of hydroponic equipment with proprietary
technology to create sustainable solutions for the cultivation of indoor agriculture.", and
the company also states "We do not own patents." The net result is a company that is
overvalued on all fundamentals with no real intellectual property.


So it begs the question, where is the value in the company? Perhaps the 2013 acquisition
of Edible Garden should help. On April 24, 2013, Terra Tech purchased Edible Garden
and its 5 acres of greenhouse structures through a share exchange. The company in its
own disclosure lays out the potential of the land "The facility, at maximum production, can
produce up to 25,000 plants per week, per acre, operating 52 weeks a year at an average
sale price of $1.55 per plant. The Company believes that at full production, the facility is
capable of producing up to $10 million in annual sales." With $2 million of revenue in
2013, Terra Tech is far from its prior promises.


Refer to Appendix J for details on valuation.


The business is so bad, TRTC is forced to raise capital on egregious terms


The company on March 23, 2013, raised $504,500 through a senior secured promissory
note bearing interest at 60% per annum. It raised another $250,000, $153,000 and
$229,000 for another 60% annual interest rate in Apr-13, May-13 and Jul-13.


In Feb-14, Terra Tech entered another significantly dilutive agreement with Dominion
Capital to receive up to $6.6 million for 18 months of liquidity. All notes are convertible at
$0.307 a share which represented a 46% discount to the close price on February 5, 2014.
I note that this does not even include the warrants.


Terra Tech has also done toxic financings with Hanover Holdings. Hanover Holdings and
Magna Group have a history of destroying shareholder value for their own benefit.


"As of October 28, 2013, there were 123,577,646 shares of common stock". Shortly
thereafter: "As of December 31, 2013, the Registrant had a total of 233,802,141 shares of
common stock issued and outstanding". There have been minimal changes in operations
or the company during this three month period. The only change was Terra Tech being
forced to report their real share count (inclusive of converted preferred shares).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 10/163


As at 31-Mar-14, the company has 246 million shares outstanding in addition to 19.5
million warrants outstanding (at an average price of $0.21 per share). Couple that with the
21 million shares and 11 million warrants granted to Dominion Capital for convertible notes
held and to be issued. Total shares outstanding are approximately 298 million. The market
cap is thus just shy of $224 million for a company that has $2 million in revenue. This 112x
revenue multiple yells 'overvalued'.


With only $3 million of cash on its books as at March 31, 2014 (per latest 10-Q) and $1.5
million cash burn (aka cash used in operations per cash flow statement), the company is
on pace to be out of cash in one or two more quarters. I guess it makes sense that they
filed an S-3 on April 17, 2014 for a proposed raise of up to $50 million which
basically sets the current shareholders up for massive dilution.


To top it off, insiders are cashing out


Insiders have sold $1.1 million of the company in the last few months. In addition to that,
take a look at the circled disposition from Amy Almsteier (treasurer/decorator) to Michael
Nahass. Why would one director transfer 2.5 million shares to another for no
consideration?


Additionally, it looks like Amy Almsteier purchased 100k of shares at $0.58, but do not be
fooled - she was really paying a penalty as a result of yet another violation of Section
16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Derek and Amy, CEO and treasurer, have
cashed out a little under $400,000 recently and like other areas of their lives are unable to
follow rules.

5/19/2018 Terra Tech: A Natural-Born Capital Killer - Terra Tech Corp. (OTCMKTS:TRTC) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 11/163


Terra Tech is another story whereby a faulty management team is touting a lot more than
they will ever achieve. Eight companies that operate in the marijuana have had their
trading suspended this year, I would not be surprised if TRTC is next (refer to Appendix A
for details). Management's history is quite the opposite of the pristine quality that they
proclaim. TRTC has a downside of 90% to equity holders with insiders selling out and an
imminent financing.


APPENDICES


Appendix A - Don't get caught in the weeds


Eight companies have been suspended in the marijuana space this year due to lack of
current and accurate information - Is TRTC next? Please note that two are still halted.


It is my view that TRTC may not be far behind. TRTC has a similar story to Advanced
Cannabis Solutions (OTCQB:CANN) and Growlife (OTCQB:PHOT). CANN was halted
"due to a lack of current and accurate information concerning the securities of Advanced
Cannabis". PHOT was halted for "questions that have been raised about the accuracy and
adequacy of information in the marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions in
PHOT's common stock".


Appendix B - Terra Tech days in the spotlight are numbered as it has little to no real
exposure to the cannabis industry


Since its inception, Terra Tech played up its potential as a marijuana company even
though it had little involvement in the space. In early press (prior to Terra Tech assuming
the PVST shell) during 2011, "GrowOp Tech doesn't actually sell medical marijuana, just
the equipment that can be used in its cultivation". This is further confirmed by its initial
filing document months later where 'cannabis' or 'marijuana' are not even mentioned once.
However, this did not stop Terra Tech and its principal agent Derek Peterson in spreading

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 12/163


buzz words like wildfire. Derek Peterson has been talking up its potential as a Marijuana
play since at least 2012. Sadly, two years later, after spending millions of shareholder
dollars, the company has barely got its foot in the marijuana door.


The excitement around TRTC revolves around its exposure to the cannabis space. It's
most recent 10-K clearly states that the company operates in two distinct markets:
Commercial AG and Retail AG. The commercial vertical assists in the transition to
controlled indoor environments whereas the Retail AG conducts business through
GrowOp Technology which develops horticulture equipment - neither of these has any
relation to the cannabis space. Marijuana or cannabis are mentioned just eleven times in
its most recent 10-K, yet all the company press releases in the news section of its website
are in relation to marijuana. TRTC being in the cannabis space would be similar to Plug
Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) being an automobile manufacturer.


Appendix C - Naturally the whole team will be led by a guy who I would not trust as
far as I could throw him, Derek Oppedisano or Derek Peterson


As recent as 2010, open market information has his name as Derek Oppedisano: "Amy
Almsteier and husband Derek Oppedisano founded WeGrow after Derek broke his neck
surfing".


Everywhere else he is currently known as Derek Peterson. As per the Terra Tech website,
the CEO is named Derek Peterson. Is a CEO with two last names (and no explanation)
really one that you want to invest your money with?


Derek's bright idea after leaving Morgan Stanley was to create a pot version of the truck
Mr White and Jesse use in Breaking Bad, see video at the bottom of this link "he founded
a company called GrowOp Technology that sells hydroponic trailers intended for the
growing of medical marijuana (even though their website never clearly states that fact)". If
a picture is worth a thousand words, see Derek climbing this makeshift step ladder on to
his flagship product, a cannabis truck on wheels.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 13/163


Derek later contradicts his previous business endeavour citing risks with smaller growers
"'Who do you want growing your weed?' he [Derek] asks. 'Some guy in his garage, or
people that cultivate food grade quality products and operate large scale facilities under
GFSI certifications."


Derek has spent most of his career working in finance, from being an independent broker
to working on the investment banking side of things. The latest 10-K specifically states
that "Mr. Peterson's background in investment banking led to our conclusion that he
should serve as a director in light of our business and structure". But if he's so good with
financials, why in 2012 did he personally file for bankruptcy. Further, why is a former
financial services guy who cannot personally manage his own money responsible for a
hydroponics company? Of course, he has jumped on the band wagon and wants to play
the marijuana hype. Although… his company really does not have much involvement in
cannabis.


Derek is often praised for his successful business history. "Morgan Stanley fired him
seven months later for his pot side business" - this goes to show that Derek cannot follow
the rules and that he was not pardoned for mistakes made at Morgan Stanley. On Derek's
Linkedin, he states that he is the current owner of ThePuffingtonHost.com, however this
site yields this: "The Website Ahead Contains Malware!". See the result here:


Either Derek has once again made a clerical error or he is trying to spread malware.


If that was not enough, just listen to Derek on a call with 420 investors, at 10:14 "umm,

love questions and answers. I have ADD so…running through a formal presentation is just
torture for me, so I don't want to torture everybody else with that" - has any CEO in history
ever said that they hate presentations. Feel free to listen to the rest of the call but to be
honest, for being a CEO of a public company, Derek seldomly mentions any business
initiative that the company is actually involved with. I am also a little confused; this call
took place at the end of 2013 and Derek is quoted as saying "[13:48] So I want to make
sure I clarify our model going into 2015…[22:24] pot.com is something that is going to be
a heavy focus rolling into 2012…[26:36] we are in the throws of determining how we
handle that going into 2014" I would not trust management as a steward of my capital.


Appendix D - I did not have to look too far to find that the Petersons' have been
charged for wrongful acts before


In the lawsuit referenced in the body of my report, Amy and her husband Derek, were
defendants in a case for wrongfully accepting over $300k through illegally traded
securities in 2009. They "accepted illegally-issued, unrestricted IEAM securities to which
they were not entitled, and which, upon information and belief, they resold for full market
value to the detriment of IEAM and its shareholders". It is said that they were involved in a
"large-scale scheme to loot the IEAM". If they acted to the disbenefit of shareholders
before for their own gain, what is to stop them this time? All of this was done with Derek's
old chum Eric Krogius at Crowell Weedon & Co (where he first worked). Industrial
Enterprises of America (OTC:IEAM) subsequently collapsed, filing for bankruptcy on May
1, 2009:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 15/163


Appendix E - Next, I will outline issues surrounding the rest of management and
discuss corporate governance issues that are plenty


First and foremost, the company's CEO, Derek Peterson is married to Amy Almsteier. Amy
has a meaningful role in the company, being its largest shareholder, has responsibility for
accounts and maintaining the position of Treasurer on the board. Amy and her husband
are the company's largest shareholders, holding just shy of 40% of total shares
outstanding and also control a majority of the voting rights. Before you get excited, most
shares were granted to the couple that have a zero cost basis.


Like her husband, Amy Almsteier has little to no experience in the marijuana space. At
0:47 into this video, Amy explains that "You give them 18 hours of light and 6 hours off,
this tricks them into thinking it is spring and summer" - is tricking plants really the IP
needed to grow quality bud? Amy is currently responsible for the company's accounts on
the management side and is Treasurer on the board. Given her previous experience as an

interior designer, she could not be a more ill-advised candidate for the job. Her Linkedin
profile is not what you would expect of a person who is treasurer of a $224 million
company.


Rounding out the team, with the acquisition of Edible Gardens, the VandeVrede family
was brought on and also has various members working at Terra Tech. With most of the
immediate family working for Terra Tech, it would make sense to keep business within the
family, I guess? For example, the company continues to lease land in Belvidere, New
Jersey from the parents of director Ken VandeVrede's parents David and Gerda
VandeVrede. This sounds like a related party transaction.


Michael Nahass became a director in early 2012. Michael has also previously filed for
bankruptcy "On May 13, 2009, Mr. Nahass filed a petition for bankruptcy in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, Case No. 8:09-bk 14465-TA.
The discharge date was August 17, 2011". Michael was indebted to Las Vegas Casinos,
Mandalay Corp and Bellagio LLC, for what would appear to be gambling debt…seems like
a great choice for a board member.


Appendix F - Terra Tech is surrounded with players of similar stature


A questionable company and leadership team is not without the partners. Derek was once
partners with Dhar Mann. Dhar was charged in 2012 for defrauding the city of Oakland
and "sentenced to five years probation for pocketing city grant money meant for building
improvements". While partners, they endeavoured to become kingpins in the marijuana
world with reality TV shows and grow ops: "It's a hedge,' Peterson explains. 'If we screw
everything up in our personal lives and our businesses go down the drain, they're gonna
love that in TV land'". After all this excitement, Derek and Dhar had a falling out. Dhar now
has a claim against Terra Tech of $2.2 million for wrongful share sales of 37.5% in
WeGrow.


TRTC's auditor also has fleas. Tarvaran Askelson & Company, LLP was inspected in
August 2011 by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. TRTC's auditor had "a
departure from GAAP that related to a potentially material misstatement in the audited
financial statements concerning the balance sheet presentation of advances to an
affiliate".


Appendix G - With poor leadership and partners, can any statement that Terra Tech
makes be trusted?

Using an accounting firm that does not know how to do its job is just one part of the
problem. In relation to their filings, the SEC also had issues with the company's filings in
November 2013, December 2013 and January 2014. It appears that TRTC cannot get its
share count or addition right "[November 22, 2013 SEC comment] The number of shares
you show as outstanding before the offering, and the number of shares you used for the
calculation in footnote 1 to the table on page 24, and the number of shares you show on

should shareholders believe anything in the company's filings?


Management competence is questionable:

Appendix H - Adding fuel to the fire, the players around the company add to the
bone of contention


In my experience, going concern issues, lack of internal controls and management
concern over dilution are red flags that raise many burning questions about broader issues
at companies. During a recent filing, the company provided its results of a review of
internal controls "Based on that evaluation, completed only by Derek Peterson, our
President and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael James, our Chief Financial Officer,
Messrs. Peterson and James concluded that, during the period covered by this report,
such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate
application of US GAAP rules". It is specifically outlined that control weaknesses included:
"lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members
and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors", inadequate

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 19/163


segregation of duties and ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure. This
again is concerning given the board claims to have a robust management team. These
alone form a compelling reason to get out now.


Its auditors have little faith in the company "Our auditors have expressed uncertainty as to
our ability to continue as a going concern as of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2012".
During its most recent 10-K, the company continued to have a going concern issue.


Internal controls are sub-par "Our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of our most recent quarterly period ended June 30, 2013, which means that
we may not timely be able to make our disclosures in our filings with the SEC."


The company itself is concerned about diluting shareholder equity "We anticipate that our
existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our longer term business
needs and we will need to generate revenue or receive additional investment in the
Company to continue operations. Such financing may not be available in sufficient
amounts, or on terms acceptable to us and may dilute existing stockholders".


Terra Tech filed an S-3 on April 17, 2014 for a proposed raise of up to $50 million which
basically sets current shareholders up for massive dilution, as the company has indicated.


Appendix I - A very serious, repetitive and dedicated history with stock promotion


Is it a coincidence that there have been multiple instances of potential wrongful stock
promotion of the company? Just recently, the stock was being promoted:


As previously mentioned, a key player was SmallCapVoice who not only promoted TRTC
directly, but that they acted as a conduit to enable further promotion. In April 2013, another
round of promotions hit, and this time paid by SCV Inc. (more likely than not to be an

abbreviation for SmallCapVoice) and discloses that it is assumed they "may have shares
and may choose to liquidate them at or about the same time these services are
performed". In May 2013, a new round hit with payments from Odd Marketing LLC.


SmallCapVoice then paid other promoters such as PennyDoctor.com on April 2, 2013.
Stock Appeal got $10,000 from SCV Inc. OTPicks.com got $2,000 from SmallCapVoice for
June 2013 email. Other promoters such as TheGreenBaron (see TRTC promotion by
TheGreen Baron here), who often works with SmallCapVoice, were likely also
beneficiaries, but they did not disclose exactly who was paying them. In February 2014,
there was more blatant promotion by the Green Baron. In the company's disclaimers, they
state "We have received (U.S.) $7,000 for the distribution and coverage of Terra Tech
Corp. as a Green Baron "Stock Alert" beginning in January 2013".


On June 5, 2014, see an example of stock promotion by SmallCapVoice:


In October 2012, Goldman Small Cap Research posted a report on TRTC. Timothy Sykes,
a penny stock guru, suggests "Very similar to how Goldman Smallcap Research tricks the
financially ignorant into believing they are associated with Goldman Sachs while in fact
they too are compensated and conflicted penny stock promoters whose picks I've
successfully shorted several times before…almost uniformly for solid profits since the
promotions inevitably fail and their "picks" inevitably crash". This was posted as a
"Goldman Opportunity Research" report, and on Goldman Small Cap's website, they state
"Opportunity Research reports, updates and Microcap Hot Topics articles reflect
sponsored (paid) research".


And yet another. Microcap Millionaires has no problems suggesting TRTC as its first pick.

Appendix J - The initial combined business was not particularly good, but if that
was not enough, the last straw is that the company has little underlying
fundamental value


GrowOp Technolgy Ltd was acquired by the shell as previously stated. Its financials at the
time paint the picture of a company in need for constant capital infusion required to avoid
bankruptcy. As per nine months ended September 30, 2011, the company was able to
squeeze out a 30% gross margin, yet had a $587,166 operating loss on revenues of
$630,329 - this would imply a (93%) operating loss as a percent of revenue. Over this
same period, just under $900k of cash were used in operations.


Breaking down the 2013 10-K, with a 285% increase in revenue, one would picture
expanding margins and greater cash flows. On the contrary, gross margins contracted
from $101k to $89k with gross margin percent moving from 18% to 4%. Meanwhile,
selling, general and admin expenses (SG&A) increased 233% to $3.6 million. Revenues
are not only small, they are 68% less than SG&A. The only reason that net loss from
operations improved is because there was no goodwill impairment in the 2013 fiscal year.
Cash used in operations was $3.9 million compared to $248k in 2012, a ~1400% increase
in cash burn during 2013. Most of the revenue to date has been generated as the result of
growing farmable crop, specifically lettuce.


Valuing such a business is fraught with issues, but perhaps we can be generous and
apply a 10x revenue multiple on last twelve months revenue. Even so, the company would
only be worth $21 million implying that the current market capitalization of $224 million is
10x greater than fundamental value. Terra Tech is could fall over 90%.


Derek Peterson and his wife Amy Almsteier, completed a Reverse Takeover (RTO) to
create Terra Tech. The deal was valued at $4.8 million on the balance sheet with over
99% of value allocated to goodwill:


This goodwill was then completely written off in 2012, which was less than ten months
later:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 22/163


This implies that their shares should not be worth anything given this is the consideration
for which they acquired the shares in the RTO.


Not to mention that the company spends 35% of its current revenues, equivalent to $738k
in consulting expenses. Given this is a very significant portion of total revenues; you would
think the company would provide some details on who these consultants are and the
nature of their work? There are none! Are these expenses in relation to the third party
promoters?


Appendix K - SG&A through the roof


SG&A expenses have been outpacing revenues for years. This often happens in
promotions where insiders are compensated even if the result has a negative impact on
shareholder value. With deteriorating gross and operating margins and increasing SG&A
expenses, it is evident that TRTC's business has and always will be terrible.


Disclosure: I am short TRTC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Can't read this yet, watching Clark County license proceedings and thinking TRTC's chances are looking good.

In any case, I believe the author has a great ability to turn a good start-up with strong potential into a crappy-looking
project and SURE failure. Same ability to twist facts and make a good science-fiction article.

behavior when their is money to steal from other investors to line his pockets?

The fact that investors are selling because of a Seeking Alpha article leads me to believe that many investors
were either just momentum traders like I suspected or they didn't do their own due diligence. If the company
has very good prospects and you personally believe it'll grow, then why aren't you excited to buy shares at a
deep discount? Isn't the objective to buy low and sell high? If you've done your due diligence then you'd be
thankful to buy shares at a deep discount. By your reaction, it sounds like you don't believe in the company
and was anxious to sell once the price when back up towards your entry point.

You have no clue as to what really occurred here. A stock PPS manipulator has deceived you.


If I intentionally and willfully manipulate the PPS of the stocks you own in order to profit from shorting them
you will have no objections - correct? 
After all, as a admitted short like the author, isn't the objective to make money by any means possible?


The author is Norman Gates, who is on both Facebook and linked in. Below in the comments, he also
admitted to influencing the county commissioners, and bragging about how he profited from it by shorting
TRTC positions.


His comments where he admitted manipulation for profit as well as his contact info has been sent to the SEC
and TRTC. He uses other pseudonyms below, easily determined. He is also on twitter as laughingpaulryan.


He will be easy to find for the multiple subpoenas. County Commissioners will be contacted to see what he
said of TRTC to them to influence a no vote. Any proof of malfeasance will enrage the 16,000 holders of stock
in TRTC. Look for a class action law suit if this man caused the commissioners to vote no for a dispensary
permit in Clark County by using deception, lies, and libel.


He best sell his shares of the competitor MJNA to hire a lawyer - he is going to need help for the libel and
stock manipulation for profit he has engaged in. Will SA be part of the lawsuit as well?

Again, you are saying something that I believe is incorrect. Norman Gates is likely not the author of this
article, though he may have contributed information to the author.


08 Jun 2014, 11:35 AM


tmorr55
Alan...could you comment on this laughingpaulryan post? I want to know if there are really any SEC violations
here. There is always this cloud suspicion surrounding this company and their business practice, yet I've
always been very impressed with Derek in interviews. I listened to your interview with Derek and saw him
twice on television. He seems to be a very sharp and impressive individual. From your perspective, is
everything cool with TRTC from an ethics and legal standpoint?


"As the Treasurer of Terra Tech Corp. you'd think she would would know such a basic SEC rule to prevent
insiders from crashing the stock and covering on the short side and then flipping yet again because Amy
Almsteier is awarded millions of free unrestricted bonus shares. Certainly Derek Peterson, Michael James or
Michael Nahass should have known about this SEC rule and immediately demanded Amy Almsteier to return
more than 10% of the unethical gains instead of awarding the unqualified Treasurer more free unrestricted
bonus shares to resume dumping into the market. If Amy Almsteier was able to trigger an 80% crash by
dumping just 1% of her free unrestricted bonus shares imagine what she could do with the remaining 99% of
her free unrestricted bonus shares. It appears her only buy was a SEC violation according to penny stock
professional CFA analyst."

Derek/Amy goofed and bought stock too soon after having sold some. It was an honest mistake in my view.
The "swing trade" rule seems a bit odd and is quite esoteric in my view, but it is the law: You have to wait a
certain amount of time after selling before you buy. The Petersons took care of it properly, and there are zero
repercussions. The decline in TRTC was not at all related to these small sales that appear to have been
related to federal income taxes as alleged, at least in my opinion. The decline in TRTC was market-related -
all of these stocks corrected by 80% or so on average.

So if it's ancient history then you should be praising the SA author for helping drive the stock price lower at a
discount, isn't it better to buy a company @ .53 then @ .90 or $1.00. I personally agree with the author that
TRTC is a terribly run company that will provide very little shareholder value in the long-term; but if you
believe in the growth prospects in the company then you should be so grateful to buy it at a discount.

Your assertion indicates to me that you don't believe in the growth prospects regarding TRTC. If you were a
true believer in a company then you would be thanking the SA author for driving down the stock price so you
can buy it at a discount. Isn't the objective of the game to buy low and sell high? I know if I did my homework
on a company and knew it had great prospects for the future I'd be excited to buy at a deep discount.

It's quite apparent that you don't understand the concept of fundamental investing. How does an apartment
complex have anything to do with stock speculation or TRTC? If TRTC has great management and growth
prospects, then the true stock valuation will win in the end over any "false rumors". But if you want we can
compare TRTC stock to fat obese lesbians, since you feel the need to make random comparisons.

Maybe if people did their due diligence, this stock wouldn't have been so high in the first place. There will be
no law suit because the author has the right to express his opinion and he disclosed that he was short. What
should concern you if you're long TRTC, is the fact that nobody came out with a positive TRTC article to
refute this short-bias article. I personally think it's quite obvious why, it's because there's nothing positive to
say about this company that can refute this article.

An even greater FOOL doesn't read the SEC filings. The SEC filings determine that the current stock is
greatly over-valued relative to the reality of future growth prospects and projections. If investors are basing
their investment decisions on Seeking Alpha alone, then they should question their financial and investing
literacy. Even though I believe that this article was well done, investors should still perform their own due
diligence. If you're so outraged with the validity regarding the accuracy of the content presented in this article,
then why don't you write an article on why you believe TRTC is a buy? Nobody is stopping you. If this
company has great prospects and a bright future, then you should create a counter article.

SA isn't stopping you from writing a bullish article regarding TRTC. If you believe TRTC is so great, then
present factual numbers to back up the undervaluation in the stock and why it's a buy. Come up with some
educated assertions rather then spewing out mumbo jumbo like a revenue increase of 700% year over year,
when it was clearly an unfair comparison. If you can make a case, then the stock will go back up.

They didn't get the dispensary license for Winchester Township. They tied on votes for Paradise Township
and will move on to the second round of the selection process now. There is still a chance they will get the
cultivation license. If they do, the stock should get a very nice bump. If not... well, you can probably guess

There were only 18 dispensary permits available and 90 applications. TRTC made it to the final round, but
just missed with 3 of 4 votes positive for one of the 2 locations. 3 of 4 Commissioners voted for TRTC so the

Rory Reid supported TRTCs application. Rory is the son of Harry Reid the US Senate Majority Leader. Rory
has deep connections in Las Vegas, Clark County, and Nevada. Rory will likely also be at the cultivation and
production hearings.


June 17 and 18, cultivation permits hearing take place. 70 applications for 64 cultivation permits. Sounds like
good odds to me. AND 45 applications for 42 production permits. Again, good odds.


I bet this "author" gets out of his short position by 17 June after he scams winnings by intentionally depressing

Another pie in the sky assertion just like every other TRTC shareholder. I don't care what some company in a
completely different sector that is completely unrelated to TRTC is doing. By the way Enron went bankrupt
because it cooked the books, so your point is, well, pointless.

Fact: TRTC up 30% today and your manipulation is beyond obvious


17 Jun 2014, 10:55 PM


cshanahn12
Fact: TRTC management is incompetent and the stock is still at .50. FACT!


28 Jun 2014, 08:25 PM


ac7880
And your point is? Is .50 beneath you? If so why do you keep posting? Move on moron.


29 Jun 2014, 10:13 AM


cshanahn12
I'm not moving on because this is a perfect company to short into the spikes. Case and point when it spiked to
.80 I kept adding to my short from the mid .60's all through the .70's. So I was spot on with my short position
and my thesis regarding TRTC and its hype spikes. There will be another spike and you TRTC longs will
come out and gloat for about 5 minutes and then I'll open up a short position and watch it collapse along with
TRTC investor's hopes and dreams. There will be a great bubble in marijuana stocks some day, but it'll
probably be another 3-5 years before it takes off. I don't expect TRTC to be around for when it does, NOT at
the current rate of net accumulated losses it continues to incur.


29 Jun 2014, 01:49 PM


ac7880
And that explains why you bash, exagerate and lie. To manipulate the stock price for personal profit. You have
zero integrity you low life.

TRTC finished @ .10C July 02, 2013, today it closed @ .505c June 30, 2014 
what is that + 500 %, your pay check should do so good.

"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) reported a surprise net loss as the world’s largest online retailer continued to
pump money into warehouses and digital content, fueling sales growth at the expense of profits." now @
$324.78 a share there sounds like a company you could short and make more money on, food for thought ?


30 Jun 2014, 09:43 PM


cshanahn12
So you believe that I bash because I'm short the stock, and not short because I believe that management is
terrible? You think that I bash to help manipulate the stock down? What would most likely influence a stock, a
solid company with good management and a well thought out business strategy? Or some guy in a random
chatroom "bashing" a stock? You have it backwards, I short the companies I think are bad and then bring up
the evidence to backup my short position. I don't take random short positions and then bash companies,
that's a sure way to end up in the poor house. If TRTC is such a great company, then "bashers" shouldn't
have any influence in the stock.


13 Jul 2014, 12:20 PM


cshanahn12
AMZN is a multi-billion dollar company with a lot of influence and a wide moat as Warren Buffet would say.
Why would anybody short a company with a proven track record and a house hold name such as Amazon,
when they can short a terrible company with terrible management such as TRTC.


13 Jul 2014, 12:28 PM


trabob
Do whatever you want, bashes of any stock have a temporary impact, and I am in it for the long run, and IMO
the investors will be there, and my money goes were other investors money is likely to go in the long haul


14 Jul 2014, 09:07 PM


trabob
I have no interest in short sellers, but realize they are there, Amazon is an over priced stock that do some
very shady things, if that is good management then we have very different ideas on what good means. 
I expect to see them on American Greed some day, and who I would short, if I was a short seller, but do what
you like


14 Jul 2014, 09:17 PM

TRTC scored a 3 on one of its applications. This is a long process that doesn't end today. Las Vegas would be very
nice, but so would Reno. I am just glad to see that they didn't get skunked on both apps. Zeroes were quite common
among the applicants. Listening to this whole thing is really cool but also scary. Relying on govt. bureaucrats is never
fun.

Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
The timing of this article was interesting. The lengths people will go to to support their position:


"However, we believe regulators in Nevada are working diligently to weed out (no pun intended) the poor
applicants and just in case they miss this publicly available diligence regarding Terra Tech and its dubious
management team, a copy of this diligence has been made available to them."


06 Jun 2014, 04:26 PM


mr.investor
Alan, would you mind elaborating more on the scoring system? Did they score a 3/5 or 3/10?


06 Jun 2014, 04:37 PM


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
This was a most interesting deliberation, all totally open to the public. To advance to the final 18 of 81
awarded spots, one had to get 4 votes. If one got zero, then one dropped out. Those whom received 1-3
moved to the next round. In the initial voting, which is on a township by township basis, TRTC got skunked on
their "Vegas Godspeed", but they got 3 votes on their "Decatur Twain" application. When it was all said and
done, they were in the final 7 slots competing for the 18th award.


The State must approve in the coming weeks. What most people probably don't realize, this was for
dispensaries. TRTC will be competing in 10 days or so for cultivation licenses. Further, there are other
geographies in the state.


This was dissappointing, but not critical. For anyone who thinks that TRTC isn't a marijuana company, today's
showing represents stark evidence that the view is unfounded.


06 Jun 2014, 07:00 PM


mschwi3430
Yes, Alan, can you please explain the "3", and your opinion on the arguments stated in the "no clothes"
piece?


06 Jun 2014, 11:25 PM


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
3 is three votes, as I explained above. My opinion is that most of the article rehashed issues that are well
known. I shared some other thoughts here regarding an inaccuracy. The one issue that I found potentially
disturbing is the payment to Small Cap Voice. I am curious about the nature of those services. Over the past
10 months, I haven't seen any promotions, so I am not sure what was bought.

There were only 18 dispensary permits available and 90 applications. TRTC made it to the final round, but
just missed with 3 of 4 votes positive for one of the 2 locations. 3 of 4 Commissioners voted for TRTC so the
authors hit piece here rings hollow.


Rory Reid supported TRTCs application. Rory is the son of Harry Reid the US Senate Majority Leader. Rory
has deep connections in Las Vegas, Clark County, and Nevada. Rory will likely also be at the cultivation and
production hearings.


June 17 and 18, cultivation permits hearing take place. 70 applications for 64 cultivation permits. Sounds like
good odds to me. AND 45 applications for 42 production permits. Again, good odds.


I bet this "author" gets out of his short position by 17 June after he scams winnings by intentionally depressing
the stock. SA should be ashamed at the damage they just inflicted not only on the company, but in particular
all the shareholders

If you're excited about TRTC, then be thankful that you can buy it at a discount. It makes no sense to bash
this article if you're a long-term investor who does their due diligence. I know there can't be many because
those who do their due diligence would never invest in this company. But none the less, appreciate the

James.Bond
The Emperor Has No Clothes


Your article is mostly half-truths. I will not engage into and analyse all of them so I choose two: 
Dhar Mann lawsuit ex- partner. Peterson dissolved the partnership years ago stating that Mann was a thief and not to
be trusted. Fast forward to last year when the city of Oakland filed criminal charges for? you guess it: thievery of
Oakland's tax payer money that Mann was to use to upgrade apartment complexes for lower income people. Mann
was charged and convicted as well in a court of law. You deliberately missed that out. Source: just go to Dhar_Mann
wikipedia.


About Peterson leaving Morgan Stanley to venture full time to MJ. He indicated many times that he was given the
choice to resign after somebody rat on him that he was "moonlighting". This is a known fact. You blatantly lied.


BTW, I forwarded your article to his company, in the even that this article is deleted. I hope his solicitors will sue you
for any ill-gotten gains you will be unable to benefit and hopefully more in Punitive damages that will leave you in the
poor house. Discussing only one side of the story and then spooking naive investors with these half-truths has to stop.
I hope TRTC management puts an end to this and you.

If you're so excited about TRTC then you should be thankful that you can buy it at a discount. If TRTC is an
emerging company then the truth will come out and the stock will spike, conversely if this is all true which I
believe most of it is, then this stock will be trading near grey sheet territory a year from now. Successful
companies don't tout about a 700% revenue increase when they posted a $4.9 million loss in QTR 1 which
was a 300% increase in losses.

So you assume since we don't like TRTC and know it's a fraud, you assume that we are all one person.
Multiple people couldn't possibly point out facts about a terrible fraudulent company. Why can't you present
any solid facts to back up why people should actually buy this piece of crap company? I haven't heard any
logical argument from a TRTC investor besides hopes and dreams. Why hasn't there been a Seeking Alpha
article to refute this article if the facts presented in this article are false? I think you're just in denial as you
watch your TRTC investment slowly bleed away your account. When you're wrong you HAVE TO SELL, that's
how you grow your account and become rich. Cut losses early and let your winners run, it's not rocket
science. TRTC is a loser and should be cut!

TRTC wins a few permits.....Who cares! The company has terrible management, I'll buy TRTC the day
Peterson fires himself and his incompetent wife. Until that happens, TRTC will only spike up on hype and then
crash towards $0. Hype will send a stock up temporarily but terrible management will bleed out a company
over time, just look at TRTC's chart since the initial spike. It doesn't bother you that Peterson boasted a 700%
increase in revenue from Q1 2013 to Q1 2014 when clearly the increase was due to the Edible Gardens
acquisition? All TRTC did was take the revenue that Edible Gardens had been making and then placed it on
their own balance sheet, but Peterson failed to boast about the significant increase in losses they incurred
since the acquisition.

drifter 
why wait, TRTC will make you money with or without the license, pot is not a make or break for them,


a year ago it was .10c / share, today it is .50c / share and they did not have a license, legalizing pot medically
and recreational will continue, and more and more states are getting into it, and because of that more and
more investors will get into it


you have more to worry about what the SEC does then any of these companies do, and they have no control
over the SEC, but "conservatives and short sellers do", so there is were you need to worry about on the
dramaIMO the SEC will not stop with the insane stops in trading untill they either scare people away from this
industry or the people raise up against them to force them to justify themselves and their actions.as more
investors are losing money due to the tatics of the SEC then any (unknown) illegal actions by companies.I
have not lost one cent due to any illegal actions of companies I owned stock in, but I have lost money due to
actions by the SEC (to protect me) from myself no doubt.

That's what happens when people like you get burned for not doing your homework. TRTC is fire and when
you play with fire you get burned. Consider this a lesson.

yep, when you play with fire your investment usually goes up (that;s why they call a stock doing well $$ a
stock on fire) and I am 4 to 5 times hotter then I was a year ago, and I do very little home work, except
reading people, 
and if I am reading you right you are not one of the people I would bet my money on.

This is an extremely well-researched article. for the company or not, you have to appreciate the sheer time and effort
it took for this author to compile this information.


I have seen authors a lot more callous in their criticisms of a company: this isn't it. I am extremely impressed.

The article is completely subjective though if the author has an agenda and announces they are short TRTC
right off the top then there is no objectivity at all. Anyone who uses any traditional financial metrics on any pot
stocks is completely clueless and missing the whole forest for the trees. Shorts wait for rapid increase in a
stock price and then post a hit piece on SA. It's not rocket science, so the financial experts here are usually
the last to know anything like always.


07 Jun 2014, 10:02 AM

But what was the authors intent? Holding a short position makes that VERY clear!


There were only 18 dispensary permits available and 90 applications. TRTC made it to the final round, but
just missed with 3 of 4 votes positive for one of the 2 locations. 3 of 4 Commissioners voted for TRTC so the
authors hit piece here rings hollow.


Rory Reid supported TRTCs application and presented the first 2 minutes of the first locations discussion
panel. Rory is the son of Harry Reid the US Senate Majority Leader. Rory has deep connections in Las
Vegas, Clark County, and Nevada. Rory will likely also be at the cultivation and production hearings.


June 17 and 18, cultivation permits hearing take place. 70 applications for 64 cultivation permits. Sounds like
good odds to me. AND 45 applications for 42 production permits. Again, good odds.


I bet this "author" gets out of his short position by 17 June after he scams winnings by intentionally depressing
the stock.


SA should be ashamed at the damage they just inflicted not only on the company, but in particular all the
shareholders. SEC should be "halting" hit pieces for profit like this one.


07 Jun 2014, 10:18 AM


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
The SEC allowed two S-1s to go effective within the past year, and the company is in the middle of an S-3 process.
Most of the issues discussed in this article have been vetted publicly. There is a material mistake here too, probably
several, but one that sticks out is that Peterson's wife was required to buy back the stock. This is not true. What is
true is that the purchase came to close to a previous sale. It seems like a silly law, but it's a fact that she should not
have made that purchase. The consequence was that she was required by the SEC to rebate the profits as a penalty.

Terra Tech Corp. is drowning in debt, recently violated SEC trading rules, husband and wife who are the CEO
and Treasurer of $TRTC have been involved with a previous stock scam operation not long ago. They
currently are applying for cultivation and processing licenses, but if granted they will likely defraud your state
and patients before funneling all of the funds into their private dispensary in California. According to my
research Derek and Amy use shareholder money to either daytrade or buy equipment that they want for their
Blüm dispensary and pocket all the profits essentially robbing folks in broad daylight with a smile. Any
questions feel free to email me at cannabidial@gmail.com.

I will defend the author. This is not too different than someone buying a stock, saying he or she is long and
then writing a very bullish article. Some have told me that if such an article were fraudulent, it would expose
the author to securities laws violations, while a bearish article that were fraudulent then that would not be the
case. I am not sure about that, but I do believe that if someone published a fraudulent article in a negative
manner, then that person could face civil action.


Let me make a suggestion or two. If you really object to this article, respond to the points or provide some
balance by sharing some of the many positives of the story. I plan to re-read this, but as one who has followed
the story closely, none of this is particularly new to me.

If Norman Gates did what he said he did, then that could be tortious interference and may even be criminal
with respect to securities laws. If that is the case, then I don't think it would be a waste of time. I am really
against companies stifling the views of people who don't agree with them, but I think that there is a limit. It's
one thing to post your views, but quite another to conspire with other market participants try to destroy a
company potentially, if that is what happened. In any event, it's not for me to decide, but I certainly can
understand why the company would pursue legal claims.

TRTC comments on SA Article 
Terra Tech has recently become aware of libelous statements made through multiple online sources.? In
particular a Seeking Alpha article written by an anonymous author, who admits to being short the company's
stock.? The article makes numerous misrepresentations with respect to the company, its directors and
officers. ?Terra Tech has already identified at least one individual responsible for the false statements made to
the Clark County commissioners regarding Terra Tech as Norman Gates aka "@LaughinPaulRyan", and has
retained counsel to pursue him and anyone affiliated with, encouraging, or directing, his activities to the fullest
extent permitted by law. These individuals or groups emailed county officials what the Company believes is
false and misleading information in an attempt to affect the outcome at the Clark County hearings

I bet this articles author will also be buying at the low point now that he can cash out his short position first.
How about that author, are you buying at the low so you can take profits twice, once from your short and
again for the next rise???? Unethical behavior!


Hold your shares and wait for the run-up to 17 June, or wait to see if the odds play out for a cultivation permit.
Just like the author will likely do now that he cashed out his short and will likely buy at the low so he can profit
twice.

I have known Derek Peterson since 2006. I was a wholesaler with a large insurance/investment company. Derek
managed a large, productive branch of investment advisors. I called Derek to schedule meetings, discuss financial
risk management(I sold a VA's), or regarding his large producing advisors. Derek successfully grew his personal and
team revenues with Crowell Weedon, Wachovia and Morgan Stanley. Derek was "fired" in the brokerage industry,
LMAO. All financial firms automatically fire advisors if they move to a competitor, or leave the industry. I do not know
of any specific facts, nor does this author, regarding Derek's severing business with Morgan. It does not matter. Derek
saw the market opportunities, weighed the risk of leaving a lucrative career, and went for it. Derek is smart, perceptive
and HONEST. In 2007, Derek mentioned he was "going in a new direction" in business. My large insurance company
received sales and production numbers from the brokers, Derek and his team managed over half a billion AUM. I can
vouch for Derek's passion, knowledge, successful past, integrity and visionary ideas. Take a look at TRTC here.

So you've actually met Derek personally and have audited all of his finances? Many if not most people
especially in the financial industry appear to be legitimate but are completely different behind closed doors.
The fact that they touted about a 700% increase in revenue was just another red flag demonstrating to me
that they're trying to mislead naïve investors. You can't tout a 700% revenue increase when your losses

increased by 300%. When a company is successful, their losses should be falling when revenues increase,
not increasing losses. I'm just pointing out that overall losses accelerated when their "700%" increase in
revenue was reported. It's like buying a stock for a high yield dividend purpose such as 9%, then watching the
stock fall 50% while still justifying the long position because of it's high yielding dividend.

I have mixed feelings on above post,


I am noticing this in penny stocks, that they seem to be doing so good (gross) and then their net goes deeper
in debt (net) talk about misleading,


The other part I am not sure, but if a stock is $100 and the dividend is 9% I would think if it fell to $50 it would
be a 18% return?

I knew a hit piece was coming. I did not know from where. TRTC has a short of 4 plus million. This short, 4.2
million, reported on Jan 15th, Dec 31st short a few thousand. TRTC price per share on Jan. 2nd was .16,
sixteen cents. On Jan 15th, TRTC traded at .31. The short of 4.2 million TRTC averaged .20 cost as a guess.
The shorts are stuck. I bought more TRTC at .489. My first TRTC shares purchased @ .115. The drama will
ratchet up as TRTC rises. Bashers and sur grape types will get vocal about old, often irrelevant news.
Thomas Edison failed 1000 times before the lightbulb. TRTC shareholders will reap huge long term gains in
Terra Tech. Derek and team are establishing an Amazonian MegaStore. Urban Agriculture growth,(ex-
cannabis),is in the double digits and ramping up at exponential rates. One Reason: Economics. Local food
production becomes NECESSARY as cost of energy reduces competitive offerings. Who needs, or wants,
canned vegetables? growing is cheaper, infinitely superior in taste, color and NUTRIENTS. If your short
TRTC, good luck as it sounds like an awful idea. Invest in TRTC, the tip of a significant spear.

Sorry to ask this, but I am completely new to the stock market. What does it mean, that the author was "short Terra
Tech stock"? Please someone explain this to me, for it will determine what I do with my TRTC stock first thing in the
morning.

Market is closed tomorrow, but short is the opposite of buy to open and sell to close. First you sell the stock
and the proceeds are added to your account (can't use proceeds for purchases or withdraw), then you buy to
close the position hopefully at a lower price. The same basic principle of sell high buy low apply, just in
reverse order of the normal buy then sell, you sell then buy to close the position. Sounds confusing, but very
basic.

Sounds confusing the way you "explain" it...Kep basically the "writer" is betting the stock will go down and it is
a bet not an investment. I would suggest you just google shorting and see what it is in it's entirety. GL and one
more thing..I would NOT do anything with your investment based on this "article" Do you see the writer come
back even once to defend himself? NOPE as it's just a "hit piece" with an agenda which is quite common
unfortunately.

Here is Norman Gates who apparently manipulated the stock price with a Seeking Alpha hit piece and
seemingly attempted to influence the County Commissioners by providing information with exaggerations and
distortions so he could profit from shorting this stock and enhancing his stock holds in MJNA.

the SEC and TRTC lawyers to find him. Just walk up to his bar and serve him a subpoena.

Main point the author misses is the Federal Law is about to change to allow States rights without government
interference. He points at businesses not yet producing marijuana as if that is some sort of red flag. Breaking Federal
Law would be more of a red flag, there is no denying there is significant infrastructure owned and operated by TRTC
and the produce they are growing is incredible. The very fact the GOP controlled House passed legislation blocking
the DEA from interfering with State Medical Marijuana Laws, proves change will be here in short order. You will be
ruined if you are holding any cannabis companies SHORT the day that bill is signed to law or voted through the
Senate for that matter. It's going to be a run of epic proportions and to short it is unbelievably naive. The past is
irrelevant to the changes this industry is about to see. We soon will witness the birth of an industry and States that
have not yet passed medical marijuana laws will after a Federal Law change, people are leaving their States for
medical marijuana States, this is a recurring news story all over the country.

The way the Clark County commissioner was talking about a company that has not even produced any MJ, it is
unlikely TRTC will obtain any licenses. Then again if TRTC did grow MJ, they would be in bigger trouble with the
Federal government. Between a rock and a hard place. Federal vs state rights has to be resolved.


07 Jun 2014, 01:11 AM

70 applications for 64 cultivation permits. Sounds like good odds to me. AND 45 applications for 42
production permits. Again, good odds.


TRTC made it to the last round on dispensary permits, with only 18 available. Hardly a total failure.

AC the macro is always an important and smart way to look at an industry.


07 Jun 2014, 11:51 AM


James.Bond
The only chance left for TRTC will be If they obtain a license to produce the MJ, they can partner with one or some of
the dispensaries that already have the license in Clark County to push their products since each license to produce,
cultivate, dispense are separate. These small dispensaries most likely do not have the infrastructure of a TerraTech
for mass production of MJ. However, like I mentioned prior, listening to the applications yesterday, if the other counties
in Nevada have the same conclusions about publically traded companies and companies that have not even
produced and MJ, TRTC will not obtain even one license.


Former principal lobbyist for the ACLU at the Nevada state legislature Rebecca Gasca, who lobbied for TRTC must
be very disappointed right now that she could not convince the commissioners in Clark County. Well 0 /4 so far, but it
is not over yet. Still 3 more applications to go.


At the very worse, Terratech can still grow produce for the restaurants in Clark county until one day, more licenses are
opened and TRTC can reapply (IF the House of representative bill becomes law by then)


07 Jun 2014, 07:38 AM

17/18 June. 70 applications for 64 cultivation permits. Sounds like good odds to me. AND 45 applications for

My bet is the author with no clothes is going to buy back TRTC in the low .30's to ride the wave back up. He's just
mad he missed it as he even mentions that the stock ran up 100% in a matter of days, primarily because people like
him got out of his short position. TRTC is the most transparent in the sector and the strongest because they are in the
best position to stay long by having more than just weed to grow. Many other reasons. Plus, the title is that TRTC kills
$. I have made $ many times with TRTC.

That is exactly what the author is likely doing. He profited on the short position with his hit piece, now he will

Seeking Alpha = A Natural Born Share holder destroyer,by allowing such one sided,short interest ended trash to be
published. "I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is
mentioned in this article" << The author is only thinking of the compensation from his short interest in TRTC from
which he seeks to benefit. Who the hell does this clown think he`s kidding with this article? All longs can simply burn
his sorry bum by simply holding strong moving forward,rather than giving in and selling off in a panic. This article is
simply pure and blatant market manipulation. Don`t fall for his hype,TRTC is a real and tangible company with real
products,currently producing organic,hydroponic vegetables and herbs in quality markets and TRTC hopes to segue
into the MJ space at any given time when all legal issues are in proper order. Seeking Alpha really seems to subject
itself to endless ridicule and lowers its credibility through pieces such as this one published here. They really need to
get it together.

Yes, he is trying to hide his identity because he knows that if he was found out he would be under heavy
scrutiny. Forget what Matt Finston said about being impressed about how much research was put into this. I
would hedge my bets that this was a concerted effort by multiple people to pull this information together, wait
for a crucial moment (as in right when the stock was at a very high point in anticipation of the Clark County
hearings and possible license issued to TRTC), short the stock, and then take huge profits after the inevitable
drop. Then buy low next week and wait for the price to shoot up again in two weeks when the next round of
permits in Clark County are issued for cultivation and production- licenses TRTC is much, much more likely to
get and that WILL drive the PPS up significantly.


There is a scam here alright, and it's not perpetrated by Derek Peterson. Who stands to gain the most here?
The "author", which is most likely a team of people who put this together. The author admits he has taken a
short position and then (quite unethically) tells half truths to scare everyone into selling. He also claims this
information was sent to the Clark County Commission. I would not be surprised if that was an outright lie,
seeing as how he is willing to use the old political tricks.


You see it in political races all the time. An attack add is put out and takes a fact without additional context
and twists it into a negative. Take DP changing his name, for example. If you say that someone changed their
name and then ask a question like "why did he do it? what does he have to hide?", you can scare and dupe
dim-witted people quite easily. A smarter person would ask more questions to get to the bottom of it, but we
all know many investors don't really care to dig deeper because their emotion trumps critical thinking and the
thought of losing money is all they need to sell. Many people have already pointed out the half truths here that
attempt to make DP look bad, but show how ethical he is when you dig deeper and find out the truth.


I very much hope the SEC takes a hard look at this "author", who we know nothing about. My question is
"who is this author and what does he have to hide?"

TRTC has multiple businesses going on. I think if they were to get 3 or 4 it would blow up in there face.


Right now they are in over 700 Markets across the USA with Edible Garden.


They have 5 growing operations in 3 states across the country.

One more thing you have to remember if that governments do not like to have companies having a monopoly of any
kind. I doubt any company will have all licenses. terratech has a better chance with the cultivation and production,
partly due to the large overhead needed and as a result, the small amount of applicants. We will see what happens in
2 weeks but again, TerraTch could be shut out due to the "you are a publically traded company who never even

they were growing MJ, they would of had maybe one of the licenses if the Commisioners did not care for a
monopoly, I watched the hearing and the commissioner was concerned about a MJ company that has never
grown any MJ. They wanted a company that was growing it NOW, not later due to being a publically traded
company.


I can not make it any clearer to you fidelissemper. This could follow to other states as well as potentially deny
Terratech ANY licenses until the Federal government gives it a green light. By then, it will be too little, too late
because TerraTech would not have the licenses needed to operate in those states. And so far you need a
license to grow MJ in these states since it will a controlled substance.


Just hope that this same scenario does not happen next week.

Grave? LOL...give it a rest with the fear JB...how many applicants were their for the # of Lic available? They

and in the next rounds the odds are exponentially better...the numbers don't lie...look at the # of applicants for
the # of Lic available...it would of been a small miracle if they got one in this first round...sell and get out if you
have any and you don't trust your investment. I'm holding and no 1/2 assed silly drivel of an "article" by a

individuals involved. Alan, I'd love to believe in your evaluation of the owners, but you were so wrong on PHOT and
that is in the basement now. How do you think TRTC is any different?

Forget what Matt Finston said about being impressed about how much research was put into this. I would hedge my
bets that this was a concerted effort by multiple people to pull this information together, wait for a crucial moment (as
in right when the stock was at a very high point in anticipation of the Clark County hearings and possible license
issued to TRTC), short the stock, and then take huge profits after the inevitable drop. Then buy low next week and
wait for the price to shoot up again in two weeks when the next round of permits in Clark County are issued for
cultivation and production- licenses TRTC is much, much more likely to get and that WILL drive the PPS up
significantly.


There is a scam here alright, and it's not perpetrated by Derek Peterson. Who stands to gain the most here? The
"author", which is most likely a team of people who put this together. The author admits he has taken a short position
and then (quite unethically) tells half truths to scare everyone into selling. He also claims this information was sent to

the Clark County Commission. I would not be surprised if that was an outright lie, seeing as how he is willing to use
the old political tricks.


You see it in political races all the time. An attack add is put out and takes a fact without additional context and twists
it into a negative. Take DP changing his name, for example. If you say that someone changed their name and then
ask a question like "why did he do it? what does he have to hide?", you can scare and dupe dim-witted people quite
easily. A smarter person would ask more questions to get to the bottom of it, but we all know many investors don't
really care to dig deeper because their emotion trumps critical thinking and the thought of losing money is all they
need to sell. Many people have already pointed out the half truths here that attempt to make DP look bad, but show
how ethical he is when you dig deeper and find out the truth.


I very much hope the SEC takes a hard look at this "author", who we know nothing about. My question is "who is this
author and what does he have to hide?"

Matt finston? LOL look at his article on the Canadian Co's and see how well they are doing...no volume...little
interest...and really it seems unless it's a Canadian Co he doesn't seem to think they have a shot. The fact
that he says he's "impressed" with this article should tell you all you need to know about his opinion. That said
I do like some Canadian Co's and have invested accordingly. GL

Actually, these criminals did exactly what they mentioned. TerraTech is currently taking legal action. TRTC
was informed by the Nevada Commissioners that they received negative emails begging them to deny TRTC
licenses because TRTC is a fake company and a criminal enterprise. TRTC claims a barrage of negative
emails such as informing the Commissioners that TRTC is a sham company, with no revenues, no products
and two "criminals" Derek and Amy who will steal from your city and provide nothing.


Now I do not know if that is true or not, I am not a corporate officer BUT my concern was it was engaged
during the hearings.

It's a fact that Seeking Alpha has had major issues recently about their pump pieces, where they had to do some
house cleaning in the past couple of months with older posts by deleting them from the site, due to pending lawsuits,
but what's surprising is the 'short' pieces continue to be published. I do believe TRTC will legally challenge this piece,
which will hopefully in addition to exposing pump pieces, shine a light on the short side of these posts. While we're at
it, can we stop calling these 'articles'. These are blog posts at best by mostly anonymous basement dwellers, with
zero journalistic or analytical credentials or any integrity to speak of, which use Seeking Alpha, a glorified pump &
dump apparatus disguised as a news source. I'm pleased to read in financial medias (real articles) that the savvy
investor is catching on to this sham, and taking these posts on Seeking Alpha for what they are, an instrument to
pump or short a stock.

I get that SA deals with a lot of penny crap stocks and i get its high reward/risk. TRTC could be gold or could go under
but I am surprised how easy it is used to go after a company with no repercussions. Don't they have a say on when
and how articles are posted? I have 2 predictions 1) trtc wont sell off too hard Monday, maybe early on them slowly
climbs up. 2) it is going to have a bounce coming up due to licenses. Question is do I hold on or add more and take
the risk? I have no idea if they get any licenses and this author was right about clark county.

I'm still trying to figure out why TRTC believers are upset with the validity of this article. If the statements are false
then this article has presented a great buying opportunity for you but if you believe in the facts presented in this article
then shame on you for wanting to dump your worthless shares onto another naïve investor, just cut your losses and
look for other opportunities; TRTC isn't the entire market. But as I stated, if you truly believe in this company, then
you've been presented with a great buying opportunity. I've researched TRTC and don't believe in this company
because they have too much debt and management doesn't appear to be competent, but that's for the market to
decide.

The biggest clue, as to what TRTC is, is how much this CEO spends in stock chat rooms, posting stuff. He is
managing a stock, not a business. Its really obvious, at this point. Certain people are just manipulating people who
don't get the markets and how a real CEO behaves and what this guy has been doing.


The comments in this thread, are just dumb, and ignorant, for the most part. This is why Derek loves these guys of
investors. They are dumb and easily manipulated. A CEO holding your hand, is a bad CEO, no debating that.


Agendas long and short, too much drama, no way, it really works out. Derek, if he had any chance, has ruined his rep,
with these stunts.

"We take these claims very seriously and are currently exploring all of our options for relief. In addition we
believe this to be part of a larger orchestrated effort to short Terra Tech's stock so individuals can illegally
profit from the company's decline. We are in the process of alerting the authorities and regulatory bodies

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 70/163


Terra Tech has recently become aware of libelous statements made through multiple online sources. In particular a
Seeking Alpha article written by an anonymous author, who admits to being short the company's stock. The article
makes numerous misrepresentations with respect to the company, its directors and officers. Terra Tech has already
identified at least one individual responsible for the false statements made to the Clark County commissioners
regarding Terra Tech as Norman Gates aka "@LaughinPaulRyan", and has retained counsel to pursue him and
anyone affiliated with, encouraging, or directing, his activities to the fullest extent permitted by law. These individuals
or groups emailed county officials what the Company believes is false and misleading information in an attempt to
affect the outcome at the Clark County hearings.

kappaguy99
After reading all of this, I have to say, I think certain people's zeal will prove to get the better of them. Legally
speaking, it's totally OK to write this "article" (I like the person who suggests calling it a blog posting) and to admit you
are shorting the stock. That is legal. 
You know what's not legal? Tortious Interference. By sending these things to the Clark County commissioners, certain
people will have sealed their fate. Now, a concerned citizen of Clark County would be able to argue that they have a
vested interest in the outcome of the dispensary hearings. But someone who doesn't even live in Nevada, they have
no interest outside of a business interest. That means they are a third party, intending to induce damage to a business
relationship, which constitutes "tortious interference with prospective business relations." 
Legally speaking, I'd say they're F'd. Had they just limited their attack to Twitter, Facebook, and SA, they'd be legally
OK. When they got in touch with the Clark County commissioners office, they crossed the line. The content of the
article is basically irrelevant in the eyes of the law in deciding tortious interference. All that needs to be proved is that
the conduct in question was intentional, which we know based on the communications to the commissioners. 
The legal system is not an overnight kind of thing, but these people don't stand a chance. 
And from a personal point of view, I couldn't agree more. It really gets me upset to see the short attack, but there are
no words to describe my outrage when I learned that they sent these materials to Clark County. And that, my friends,
will be their undoing. Emperor, you're gonna be needing more clothes soon.

for almost a full year. I have read everything on TRTC, all the filings and even talked to management. I have also read
a lot of material on other related stocks in the sector on the pot side and always felt way more comfortable with
TRTC's transparency and lack of dilution comparatively. Then it hit me, this is the best time to get back in HEAVY.

Matt published a hit piece by an acknowledged short, and the resulting damage to PPS was easily foreseen.
The acknowledged short took profit from it, and thus is a stock manipulator.


Did Matt verify the information in the hit piece with TRTC prior to publishing it? Did he give them opportunity
for a rebuttal prior to publishing? Did he realize that the author who admitted up front to shorting the stock
would profit by manipulation?


Is the timing of the article while Clark County was awarding permits suspect?


Did Matt own any shares or was he shorting TRTC at the time? Or did he own no shares and had no financial
interest?


Was there damage to the PPS and to 16,000 share holders as a result of the hit piece? Was all information
vetted before publishing it?


I do not know the answers to those questions. However, I suspect Matt will be asked those or similar
questions as the legal investigation proceeds.


I would like to see Matt respond. TRTC is responding with 2 interviews thus far. Do you have a link where
Matt is answering concerns?

5/19/2018 Terra Tech: A Natural-Born Capital Killer - Terra Tech Corp. (OTCMKTS:TRTC) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 75/163


This is what SA has become, a compilation of mostly dubious characters, whom operate in the shadows and possess
zero credibility and/or ethics, with the sole purpose of targeting companies that are trending either up or down. They
use SA to dupe the less than savvy investor to either pump or short a stock. How is this any different than any other
questionable pump and dump site?


Since my earlier post, and as I mentioned as a probability, Terra Tech is in fact pursuing legal action with the aid of the
FBI & SEC against those individuals that orchestrated the timing of this post with the licensing procedures on that
Friday.


With any SA post it's only logical to first look for the writers disclosure; if there happens to be a short interest, I give
those the same credibility as I would a 5 year old giving legal advice.

It just bothers me, that if I do not subscribe to these articles in SA, I will have no way of knowing why a stock went up
or down as this place is the only public place that seems to move a stock so much as SA does and that is scary to
me, as the writers seem to be aware of it also IMO,

Another reason why Seeking Alpha needs to be terminated as a venue for analysis. They cannot be biased
supporting "long" and "short" authors. They have to offer balanced opinion with the author not invested in any
outcome at the start.


Otherwise, they are doomed.

I agree, but how to accomplish that?


13 Jun 2014, 06:13 PM

I think lawsuits for potential libel, potential slander, and damage to the financial status of the companies and
the shareholders is the only way to end it.


Seeking Alpha and the author of this article may have finally managed to do so with this article. We shall see
as the legal system plods along. Civil lawsuits only need a preponderance of proof, not proof beyond a
reasonable doubt. Since the author was an admitted short and therefore profited by manipulating the PPS
with the article, a civil lawsuit "should" be fairly easy to accomplish.

Couldn't finish this article...didn't need to...this stock is a pig and it if I owned shares I'd get out ASAP. How can
anyone refute this kind of detailed information? This isn't the authors opinions, but rather a horrible list of facts
regarding the history of this company and the players involved. People are sadly like sheep when it comes to hype
and crazy speculation...let alone outright smoke and mirrors.

Anyone can take any information and twist it to reflect any position. Our political system is a prime example of this so
all of you should know better then to believe verbatim anything written by someone who states up front his short
position in a company and then proceeds to write a hit piece about them. How many of you have actually bothered to
verify any of the information presented in this article for yourselves? How many of you bothered to listen to TRTC
CEO Derek Peterson's recent interview rebutting everything in this article? How many of you know this author tried to
privately invest in TRTC and was turned down BEFORE he wrote this article? How many know he is from Canada
and has a long history of shorting stocks and then attacking them for private gain? My guess is very few if any, yet
you trust this author implicitly just like you trust your politicians and are led like lambs to the slaughter.


Idiots!


Oh yes, if TRTC is such a scam, how many of you know that this company is on track to report over $8M in revenues
this year from cultivation and sales of vegetables and herbs to many of the major supermarket chains in the US and
NONE of the revenue comes from the MJ market YET.

Zoning permits. Actual licenses are handed out by State. And those hearings start Aug 18th.


TRTC is still in the running for dispensary licenses, the process by State is merit based. If they get picked
over the 18 candidates with a zoning permit, they will have to go back to County for that location or relocate
the dispensary for a zoning permit.


17 Jun 2014, 07:54 PM

July 8th is the start for the next County's hearings, TRTC is also applying there. Those are also zoning
permits. State will give out the actual licenses.

Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
Why should SA be part of the lawsuit? SA is a platform. I wouldn't ordinarily think that this contributor should
be subject to litigation, but he basically admited to tortious interference in the article. That opens him up to
litigation in my view (I am not a lawyer).

Alan, how do you explain the lack of a "pop" with the approval of a grow license, other than it has to be
approved by the state of Nevada which I believe will be done in July. With their legal team this seems like a
good bet? 
What do you think?


19 Jun 2014, 12:30 PM


Alan Brochstein, CFA, Contributor
There isn't an approval of a grow license - it's a zoning permit. The Nevada decisions are due 11/3.

Description: 
I would like to know how you protect investors by stopping trading in any particular stock (mostly marijuana related
stocks)for some unknown reason known only by your agency and after the halt allow them to resume trading on the
grey market which is an even more risky market thereby causing the price of those stocks to tumble 60 - 90% of their
previous pps value and the national loss to investors is as bad or worse then if they were charged with a crime, and
then do not pursue or prosecute anyone for anything, thereby causing millions or maybe even billions in lost value for
what purpose besides intimidating investors from investing in any company that you may abuse your authority to do
so calls for some kind of authority to investigate your true reasons as you do not seem to prosecute anyone in any of
these companies you stop trading in, so I am bewildered as to how your actions and lack of actions after the fact have
any resembles to protecting the investors as I understand is supposed to be the reason for your agencies existence,

I hope they get that license once and for all. TRTC is an iconic company in this sector and seeing it succeed will
attract a lot of attention from the investment community. What I want to see is, if they get a license, how will they
report this in their books and how the SEC reacts/not reacts in the face of that. It will be one of the first if not the first
publicly traded companies to directly touch the plant.

Not entirely correct, they got State approval for all 8 :-)


But receiving the licenses is just a formality now, so in a way, you are right.


03 Nov 2014, 03:08 PM


James.Bond
Yes I know the final step is a review in the area for the licenses Belgium, but those areas already gave them
the permits (MOST of them) so it should be a formality now.


Also according to the website, the State contacts the areas to inform them. If the area (like Las Vegas) denies
the certification, that company does not obtain a certification for that area, and the State moves down to the
next area and contact them with the same data until that area says yes.

Newport Beach, Nov. 16, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Terra Tech Corp (TRTC) is pleased to announce the filing of
its financial results for the quarter ending September 30, 2014. The full report can be found at http://www.sec.gov. For
the quarter, the company generated revenues of $1,314,973 compared to $773,140 for the quarter ended September
30, 2013, an increase of $541,834.

This is IMO the most important part :


"To compete successfully in the state it was important for us to align ourselves with locals who have some
ownership of the MediFarm LLC's. We did not, however, want to give up the revenue and profit potential over
the long run, so we swapped an initial equity distribution for Terra Tech to have the right to the majority of the
revenue and net profits of the operations."

Thanks bond 
I was just wanting to see one of these companies make a profit, and TRTC seems like the best of the lot, and if the
best can not make a profit, it just puzzles me that the drug cartel seems to make billions, ( my reference to growing
my own)

A profit? These are start ups, what did you expect?


17 Nov 2014, 11:53 AM


trabob
All I know is I have started a number of business  
(without all the money raised from stocks)  
and made them profitable, and if I had sold stock in them, they would have made a lot more profit money.  
(or maybe free money is an excuse to not solve profit problems?)  
so does that mean these start up stock companies are just a piggy bank for the management?


17 Nov 2014, 08:12 PM


belgium
These companies went public because they couldn't get regular financing at the time.


But do tell me, did you start businesses in a climate that's trying to make a move from illegal to legal? Where
you can't go to banks for money (not even deposits) ? Where the approach changes from state to state?
Where even lawmakers are figuring things out as they go? Where you have to pay a hefty admission fee to
even start an application for a license? Where it's a merit based system with a large number of applicants for
a limited number of licenses?


Would it have been easier if they just legalized it already? Sure! But that's not the case.


If you think management is ripping you off and using shareholder money as their personal piggy bank, just
sell your shares and walk away. I know I would.


I seriously doubt you have the stomach to be investing in this industry. You ask some strange questions or
make some strange comments from time to time, and yesterday you were panicking over a little tree shaking
in the first market hours.

I did do what I had to do to make it profitable.


I bought into TRTC because they were legal in their other crops 
which as a businessman I would have used the profits to get this "illegal" business off the ground with, but now I am
not sure they are making a profit on tomatoes and lettuce, or whatever they are growing. which is a concern on
managements ability. and as far as I know vegetable farmers can have bank accounts.


I did sell when they were high, and recently bought back in, as now they can go back up, if they apply themselves,
and I am just frustrated with their pace on what is profitable.


I do not have stomach for non performance concerns, and I have the right to voice my concerns about my
investments, and I think more stockholders should also, even though they probably own or have access to the
majority of shares,


what you call panic, I call frustration,

Do you really think they should be profitable by now? With all the build-outs? And associated costs with
licensing, etc?

Trader Bob:


Think of Growlife and cash flow: since their operations were negative (expenses more than revenues), they
could not even pay basic bills such as payroll, account payable, general administrative fees. their core
business is losing money. They could pay these bills only with merchandise that they were selling or
securities. they chose securities and as a result, their outstanding shares is 850 million and authourised
shares 2 billion. GrowBlox had it even worse, since they have 0.00 revenues. Their outstanding shares went
from 850 thousand in March to 13 million in June. Right now, they are around 33 million shares.


If your cash flow is negative AND if your debtors refuse to honour your merchandise or securities, they can go
to a Judge and ask for a chapter 7 Bankruptcy


+ Cash Flow is vital to the health of any company

thanks, it is also the average time a new business goes out of business,

<<thanks, it is also the average time a new business goes out of business>>


Actually trader Bob, 90% of all businesses that will fail, fail within the first year. TRTC, if they obtain the
licenses (6 for certain as those were approved by local and state jurisdiction) will be cash flow and net income
positive sometime next year. They are going to buy NB plants by end of year, that company is net income and
cash flow positive. The Oakland extraction CBD solutions which is Marijuana based has higher margins than
the Edible Gardens and according to Peterson @ 4 million. I believe the company will turn cash flow positive
around the second or third quarter of 2015 and never look back.


IF TRTC plans to enter any other markets apart from California, they will have large amount of expenses like
Nevada. They have to "grease" the palms of the established players in order to operate in those states. The
PR they submitted helped calm the investors earlier this week as those charges are a non recurring charge.

"TRTC, if they obtain the licenses (6 for certain as those were approved by local and state jurisdiction) will be
cash flow and net income positive sometime next year."


Would be nice, but I don't think so. Late 2016 the earliest IMO, and that would be great. Some individual parts
will be net positive, but TRTC as a whole won't be for as long as they are in aggressive growth mode. And
that would be completely normal.


IMO, they will get Nevada going ASAP. And they will use incoming revs from 2015 and 2016 to enlarge the
footprint in California with 2016 in mind.


2016 will be a very interesting year for them with both California and Nevada potentially going recreational.


"They are going to buy NB plants by end of year, that company is net income and cash flow positive."


I don't know the details of such deal, but if they can postpone that deal and use the cash for something else
and better in the short term, I wouldn't mind them waiting with the NB deal. All IMO, and like I said, I don't
know the details of that deal. I just see a lot of parts moving in the MJ industry at the moment, and the VV's
are on board anyways :-)

That link from Alan Brochstein interview with DP, he indicated that NB is owned by the Vande's father and that
it should be completed before the end of the year. fair price is the last obstacle His sons excused themselves
from the purchasing and evaluation since they are owners of TRTC and that is a conflict of business. They
cannot represent their father on NB plants and themselves on TRTC.

I am 100% certain TRTC will be cash flow positive somewhere next year. The margins for Marijuana is not the
same as for "edible garden's produce" They are significantly higher. Net Income positive, if they continue to
expand or if California comes to play, may take a lot longer. California is the largest market in this country and
the expenses will dwarf Nevada. However, in Northern California, TRTC has connections with other
dispensaries and politics so this will not be as bad as Nevada and according to the Alan Brochstein interview,
Blum dispensaries is already approved at the State level. 
Plus according to the audio, Peterson mentioned that other dispensaries in Nevada have requested to buy

I knew those things about the NB deal, but it's the details, the specifics, that we don't know.


All I was saying is that IMO, the NB deal can wait because the VV's are already on board (tied into the
company in various ways), and that money (and probably some shares) might be better spent in the MJ field
(acquisitions and such) seeing all the rapid changes in the industry at the moment.


But like I said, I don't know the specifics of the deal and how much it will improve the bottom line. So this is
just for the sake of discussion.


"I am 100% certain TRTC will be cash flow positive somewhere next year."


I can agree on that, but profits not until late 2016 or 2017, depending on their growth strategy.

I somehow missed reading about who or what "NB plants" is, so if that is true, then that would be a move I
would support, and IMO would help support the PPS value, as IMO the biggest mistake that PHOT made,
was to issue those multibillion shares or warranties, in order to obtain a number of companies with negative
income, and diluted shareholder value in the process, (with an 80% voter approval) and we all know were that
led to, and IMO would have led to even if the SEC did not act.

Clark County has an emergency meeting Monday, the 29th of December 2014, 09:00 am PST to determine if they will
go with 10 dispensaries or add more to equal 18. NOTE this meeting was three (3) days prior to Judge Kathleen
Dalaney's ruling form Clark County. I assume Judge Jerome Tao also ruled in the Las Vegas case because two that
were denied by county but had State licenses were given county permits from the City several days ago.

expire but CC will just give permits to their favourites and deny all others, it seems like they were paid off by
the powers to be to deny those 8, something Las Vegas city did not engage in. They will be lawsuits in this
denial, NOT from TRTC but from other applicants, however, as far as I am concerned this whole episode is
over and I will not be reading any other reports on Nevada except for the progress of TRTC's 6 pending
business licenses (pending since they do not actually have them yet).


Only good news about the 1921 Western Avenue location for TRTC is that it borders the Strip in Clark County.
I thought it was deep downtown Las Vegas, but it is not. Peterson made sure it was as close as possible to
Clark County but politically located in Las Vegas. Less than a kilometer is the Strip (S Las Vegas Blvd), The
Hilton Hotel, Sunrise Hospital, Las Vegas resorts, the Stratosphere Casino, Hotel and Tower and the Sky
Jump Peterson mentioned in a prior interview, all about 1 minute drive (with no traffic). 
Also IF Peterson succeeds in branding his company, it will matter as much because people will drive to obtain
their products.


Right now, California is the most important market for any MME establishment and Blum already has a
license to operate in California and he stated he already has multiple joint ventures and partnerships
throughout the San Francisco Bay area with other dispensaries. If you think Nevada was competitive, wait
until California comes online, it will make Nevada look like an Ant next to an Elephant.


The restrictions with Florida and New York, I am less enthusiastic about those two States, however, more with
Florida because they could legalise MJ several years down the line.

Oh I'm sure this wont be the end of it...


No need to worry about the restrictions in other States at this point, because the rules and politics around this

Odd that the county is telling the State what to do else we will reject your rulings. If the State wants to it could
punish the County for trying to control all aspects of the applications and basically telling the State, whatever
you are declared, it does not matter, we will reject it. Las Vegas, thankfully did not engage in this and took two

if one is able to find the winners and hold. Remember, back in 1999 a $1,000 investment in EBAY would be worth
$7,000,000 today. It will happen to the lucky few who are holding winners today. Those gains with the small cost basis
will never happen with day trading in my opinion.


TraBob: 
Today's news is actually old news, TRTC made an agreement with several capital venture firms (Dominion and
Magna) in December of 2014 to have an equity line of credit for 5% discount. By having these shares registered with
the SEC, the two above mentioned do not have to wait six (6) months to sell its shares, with acceleration, it can sell
them immediately. The SEC however only granted them without acceleration which means they can sell them in 20
days. The most important fact , apart from the SEC's blessing is that TRTC can finance themselves at a significantly
reduced overhead, 5% instead of 60% dilution to the share count. 
Why the market moved? My opinion is that the majourity of these investors have no idea what was going on such as
when last year when TRTC announced the line of credit with a dilution of 5%, investors dumped the shares not
knowing that a line of credit is not a loan, it is what it states, a line of credit to be used when needed, which could be
some, or or none (unlikely). It was just news which TRTC had not produced any in about a month.

not see any of these companies reporting consistent green for at least three (3) quarters. I only invested in

Trader Bob:


I can wait indefinitely. I have a day job that pays more than enough for me to live comfortably, however, it will
not make me a multi-millionaire, this Mary Jane sector can. Furthermore, the funds I parked in this company
is not my discretionary income, hence it does not affect my day to day financial operation.


I am certain that if what Peterson's stated is true, he can be the world first legitimate Billionaire. Mentioned I
stated that word "IF". It seems that by May, this company would be way ahead of the pack (a lot of these
companies are finally falling apart- the fraud ones at least) with at least 6 entities running in Nevada, and a
CDB component, hopefully his Blum Oakland merged with his other dispensary cooperatives in California
under one umbrella and if Magna and Dominion purchase a significant amount of floating shares, It will
stabilise the security and prevent swing trading we are experiencing today. 
From May onwards could be the beginning of a permanent change with this security Trader Bob, however, we
have to see

Trader bob: 
FYI - Peterson IS suing the Clark County for reinstatement of the two dispensaries that were NOT denied but
held in pending status and would be considered if the State's pick did not match the County. Problem is the
County changed its mind and denied those pending with out any reason. They mentioned they would deny
them in December of 2014 and did engage in that in January of 2015. And the State license gives them 180
days to obtain a Special Use Permit, so the County will have to re open the process within a year and 4
months from November of 2014.


Like the 8 that sued the State and everybody else delaying the process, Peterson is just suing the County, he
is not delaying the other 10 from opening their business. The 5 that are suing have 3 distinct lawsuits unlike
one large one that the 8 County approved did in December, to increase their chances that one group may
succeed.

The Nevada Legislature, as I type this are amending the Marijuana to permit more dispensaries in Washoe and Clark
County by 50%. Not that it really matters at this point though but I assume Clark County filed a complaint with the
state that they needed at least 50% more dispensaries, Washoe County's issue is that 3 of the 5 approved are 8
kilometres (8 miles) out of the zoning area and by law are unable to transport MJ into Washoe County.


These amendments should pass the Legislature and I assume every one of the companies that were denied one way
or the other will eventually obtain something.

TRTC seems more and more like it's THE stock in this sector that it's going to make it. Having said that, all investors
should understand that TRTC is currently not profitable and DOES NOT nearly have enough capital in its coffers to
support it's intended growth plans. That means that they will have to continue diluting themselves to raise cash, year
after year [until their operation is not only self-sustainable but it's profitable enough to leave them with a big war
chest]. Dilution, with a constant value, means lower price per share. Something to consider before spending money

25 Feb 2015, 11:06 AM


James.Bond
Long PennyStocks:


on the surface, it appears that way, so far what Peterson stated years ago he has delivered.


About not having enough cash to support its growth, I disagree. TRTC already has $6.+ million from last year and
about $15. million already committed. If the IVXX does indeed generate the $4.0 million Peterson stated and if the
Nevada businesses are successful, they will not need the entire amount of the Magna and Dominion funds which like
the Nevada's bills are slated for 24 months expense. \


The amount TRTC acquired is not for this year only per 10Q quarter 3. TRTC borrowed capital for funding (in case
they need it in an Equity Line of Credit - they borrow what they need only, this is not a loan) 2 years of operations and
do not need all of the funds today. I would assume by 2 years, TRTC's California and Nevada net incomes would
negate them from using the remainder of its lender's capital. Only time will tell.


Line of credit is like a credit card or that of an equity line of credit for your house, If your equity in your house is
$200,000 or your credit card is $50,000 that is your line of credit, you borrow what you need up to the maximum
amount and that amount you borrowed is paid off. In TRTC's case, the line of credit is for 2 years because the lenders
do not want to potentially hold up that amount of capital not knowing if TRTC will use all of the funds or not. TRTC has

I find it interesting that so many comments were indignant that the author said he was short and then told you why.
These comments used words like hit piece, stock manipulation, threatened to sue the author and encouraged others
to do so, etc.


When an author tells you they are short a stock and why, it is no different than some other author telling you they are
long a stock and why. It is up to you to do your own due diligence and make up your own mind. If the author is wrong,
and the piece moved the stock in that wrong direction, it just gives you a better entry point or place to add more.
Eventually, the stock market is a weighing process, the truth comes out. Shorts no more are betting against longs,
than someone going long is betting against those who are short. The reality is neither knows the other much less
wishes ill will upon them. They both just have differing opinions on the value of the shares and the potential business.


In this particular case for instance the stock was trading at about 70¢ when the piece came out (Disclosure, I was long
TRTC at the time). It is now trading below 20¢. The author was essentially correct and those who paid attention
instead of immediately dismissing the article, did their own due diligence, and decided to sell could have saved
themselves over 70% in losses. Where are all the people coming out and thanking the author for helping to keep them
real and from losing more money? Where are all the accusers coming back with revised comments of I'm sorry, you
were right, I was wrong, I should have listened to you?

Authors with the guts to write a short piece are doing the world a favor and should be encouraged. Writing a short
piece is much harder and shows more character than writing a long piece because you pretty much know it is going to
both be unpopular and result in some people attacking you personally.


BRAVO AUTHOR AND THANK YOU!

Bravo?


Everybody knew the stock was overvalued, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.


The arguments brought up were laughable and nothing more than a smear campaign at the time. Or did you
forget?


The sector was in hype mode and the fundamentals failed at playing catch up. Nearly all stocks in the sector
lost at least an equal amount.


"Writing a short piece is much harder and shows more character than writing a long piece because you pretty
much know it is going to both be unpopular and result in some people attacking you personally. "


Much harder? It seems all you need is a bunch of accusations, some heavy wording and to put a cherry on
top you throw in a ticker or two of some clear disasters and you're all good. It's easier to scare people out of
shares.


Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against short articles/pieces in general, because they usually create
opportunities for people who did their DD. But the specific timing/intent of this one was , let's say "peculiar".


14 May 2015, 02:58 PM


Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
Belgium,


I have been so personally attacked by people when making negative comments about a stocks merits (SDRL,
DDD, etc.) that I've pretty much decided not to write short articles. Instead I relegate them to the backwaters
of comments and blog posts. Even there I wonder, should I keep doing this? I'm certainly not gaining any
popularity from it.


I imagine that many other writers have made similar choices, only publishing negative articles in pro-mode,
behind firewalls or via other more opaque means. One can see that negative articles are a small fraction of
positive one's here on seeking alpha. A more balanced approach would be preferable and thus I feel one
should err to the side of defending and applauding short articles.


This particular article was absolutely correct in the direction and negative slant on TRTC as an investment at
the time, if not on each particular. It was one of the few. While I realize other entities did interfere with the Las
Vegas city council decision to TRTC's detriment, my understanding is this author was not that person.

"While I realize other entities did interfere with the Las Vegas city council decision to TRTC's detriment, my
understanding is this author was not that person."


Huh? Directly from his article:


"However, we believe regulators in Nevada are working diligently to weed out (no pun intended) the poor
applicants and just in case they miss this publicly available diligence regarding Terra Tech and its dubious
management team, A COPY OF THIS DILIGENCE HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM. As such, it is
highly unlikely that the company will receive the nod to dispense. The information laid out in this report implies
a low likelihood of a successful application in Nevada."


I would say more: his end conclusion says it all about his own article. Something is flawed with his
"information" since TRTC went 8/8.


I agree with this part: "•Any fundamental valuation approach indicates the company has a downside of at least
90%. " And that's because the sector ran on hype and the fundamentals failed to play catch up fast enough
(political climate?).

this author's right to express a negative view (above), though I surely don't support tortious interference. You are right,

Read the article again and then search engine what he stated, all of the "issues" which are NOT related to
TRTC's performance are easily discovered.


He changed his last name (his father did), No relations to TRTC.


PUZZO is a scam promoter? He is based upon other companies he brought into the OTC but that has nothing
to do with TRTC because his other companies have no revenues, no business model and all sell shares. Not
the case with TRTC.


Amy and Derek were sued for accepting shares @ 2005. Read the complaint carefully, they were paid for
services rendered, the plaintiff sued all that worked or received compensation for the defendant which
numbered about 15 if I am correct, Amy and Derek were just two of them.


Nahuss being a possible gambler? As long as he does his fiduciary duties and does not embezzle any funds
from TRTC's treasury, his private life is none of my business. Peterson filing for bankruptcy? Was in response
to the lawsuit @ 2005 has nothing to do with his public duties at TRTC.


I can go on and on but you get the point, hopefully.


And with the latest news from Nevada State legislature reallocating the unused MM permits to other areas
including 8 for Clark County, The authour lied, however, his only objective was to short the security at that
time by having people sell. TRTC and the remainder of the State 8 should obtain what was righteously theirs
later this year.


Let see if he does another short hit piece for the New York State licenses after the 29th of May on TRTC

Nevada State Legislature just reallocated 11 dispensary licenses that were unclaimed to Clark County (8), Reno (1)
and Washoe (1). I think the lawsuit is over now since the state 8 and county 8 should all have permits from the State
and County with this move. Hopefully TRTC can move on since should be are 8 for 8 county and state.

Clark County is VITAL if Nevada goes recreational, I cannot stress this point, not so much Medicinal but recreational
is a must and the more dispensaries, the better.


On another note, Q1 ended last day of March, the IVXX was lauched 12 March which leaves 18 days or IXVV
revenues to appear on Q1 10K, they had a gross revenue of $304,025 which is 66% of the Edible Gardens Revenue
for that Quarter which is very impressive. They did have some pre orders from December onwards but the IVXX was
not really advertised until the launch in March, so I assume those were added. Also, I believe the reason why
Peterson is selecting specific dispensaries in California to carry his product is two fold:


1 - to protect his brand with reputable dispensaries 
2 - more importantly, I believe he has a relationship with these dispensaries and If or when California legalises
Cannabis, these owners will merge their operations with Blum under the TRTC holding company. Some of these
dispensaries are clearing sales of 20 million plus but they know they could clear substantially more if they had access
to capital in a publicly traded company, that is what I think Peterson mentioned about acquiring other Cannabis
business. NB Plant is technically NOT a cannabis company though he mentioned that is in his radar as well.

Talking about adding other dispensaries while Blum isn't even folded in yet? Distant future music, they don't
have the money to do acquisitions. Especially not while Nevada isn't completed.


IVXX is the way to go because it has all the opportunities for rapid expansion with little overhead.


The hanging sword here is their financing, and how Peterson will manage it.


17 May 2015, 01:26 PM


James.Bond
Belgium:


I did not mention that it was going to happen this year, California is not recreational and it is still Federally ILLEGAL
(hence why Blum is not part of TRTC yet). Blum would be the first dispensary to be folded under TRTC if Cannabis is
federally rescheduled, a majour MUST. If or when Cannabis is rescheduled, Peterson would already have his ducks in
a row and can move to acquire those dispensaries that wants to be merged (not all would want to)


As long as it is federally illegal as a schedule 1, Peterson is not going to take that chance, not even with Blum.
Peterson could easily have as many dispensaries in California carry his products, He said himself he has a majour
supply issue due to the amount of dispensaries that demand his product, if he can generate $300k + in 18 days, he
must be doing something right, however, he is not. He is very careful to what dispensary is authourised to carry his
products and to me I believe he, Slawa and Blum have a relationship with dispensaries years ago (he has been in this

business since 2010, five years) which if Cannabis is rescheduled will have some of them merge into TRTC pending
rescheduling of the Cannabis and the other criteria I mentioned.


Concerning IVXX, Peterson mentioned several times that due to the excessive demand in Los Angeles County (the
county is so large one could not drive through in in a day to give a perspective of the size), he will open another IVXX
laboratory in Los Angeles this year. Each lab, according to Peterson carries a gross income of $3.5 to $4 million. I
personally believe that the IVXX brand will easily out revenue the Edible Gardens revenue due to the margins it
produces and the demand. Peterson did mention he will have the IVXX in Nevada, but since Cannabis is federally
illegal, he has to have another IVXX laboratory in Nevada to serve that state


17 May 2015, 04:39 PM


belgium
If legality was the issue there would be no IVXX. IMO if they had the money, they would be in full on M&A
mode already. But with EG still slurping money (almost cash positive) and Nevada build-out starting this
summer they don't have any money (not to mention possible positive news out of NY).


17 May 2015, 05:09 PM


James.Bond
IVXX is a holding subsidiary of TRTC, holding stakes in other companies they can do that because it acts as an
"independent" company. Other companies such as GE, Loews, most banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan engages in
this.


The problem with Blum and the dispensaries are that unlike IVXX which is 100% wholly owned by TRTC with no other
owners, the dispensaries are owned by multiple owners (Blum is owned by Peterson, Salwa and other owners). They
would not want to take that chance the DEA shut them down stating that they are engaging in a criminal enterprise
with a publicly traded company (The DEA on occasion do shut down dispensaries in California anyway, this would be
very different because they would be tied to a publicly "cannabis company).


IF they acquire a NYS license, it may be worth more trouble than they think. NYS wants the 5 up by the end of the
year and Peterson mentioned it will be $11 million to build out NYS, more capital he does not have. I understand that
NYS should generate $260 million next year in MM revenues even with the restrictions they have, but Peterson may
be obtaining too many licenses and building out too fast at almost the same time. Nevada has not started and now a
possible New York State buildup if they obtain a license there?


EG should, according to Peterson be cash flow positive by second quarter (June) however, that cash flow will not be
enough to fund any other operations unless, Peterson can finance loans based upon EG paying back that loan.


IVXX could have that cash flow but since it is a not for profit state, they have to put any profits back into the business
which will not help Peterson funding any other operations outside of IVXX or California operations. I do not know if he
could fund a loan using IVXX's cash flow as a source of repayment due to its non profit status in California.

Not following your Blum logic at all. And remember that other tickers have dispensaries already. Legality is not

No other publicly traded company has dispensaries that I am aware of Belgium, two applied but was denied: PNTV
(Players Network) and GBLX (GlowBlox). From another State? Private companies, yes but never heard of any
publicly traded company. Both of them has Cultivation and / or productions permits however from county and state.
GBLX may obtain a dispensary since Clark County can add 8 more dispensaries in its county, however, the State of
Nevada stated they will grant licenses to the next 8 ranked at the State level. If GBLX is not ranked from 19 to 26, it
will not obtain a State license (and more lawsuits could arrive because I am not certain if ALL of the County's 8
ranked from 19 to 26 on the State list), some of them are however but all of them? Not sure.

Could you name me some of these publicly traded companies Belgium? It was big news when Players

Network never engaged in. Some companies like MDBX applied for dispensaries in Nevada, Illinois on their
client's behalf (MDBX did also attempt to apply to Clark County for a dispensary for themselves but it was
denied by State and County) and actually won dispensaries in Chicago, Illinois but that does not count as
MDBX actually owning a dispensary, Med Box was in a consultant role.

Peterson, during the 420 Conference in Denver, Colorado, mentioned he believes he is the first publicly
traded company to actually touched the plant and making revenues from Cannabis. I hope he does what
ECIG failed and successfully becomes the first Cannabis publicly traded company to relocate off this awful
Quotation system (OTC) and onto an exchange board when his operations in Nevada, California and the
production license in New Jersey, if they plan on obtaining that this year propels them with enough revenues
and shareholders equity for that to happen somewhere in late 2017. TRTC's only issue will be its share price
which must be $3.00 or $4.00 bid (AMEX and NASDAQ) . The share price could still be pennies even though
they may have over $50 million in revenues, OTC "traders" are a funny bunch of people and not investors in
my opinion.


If the people on OTC invested like that on the exchange boards by valuing companies based upon its future
earnings, TRTC would not be trading in the pennies based upon the 8 / 8 business licenses they received in
Nevada alone (pending resolution of the Clark County Judiciary review which should be ending now after the
State increased the amount of dispensaries by 8). Right now, until the law changes, these are monopolies
insuring that a select amount of companies will reap insane profits for the time being. New York State with its
restrictions based upon the New York Cannabis Alliance indicated that the 2016 revenues will be 260 million
which is not that much money,however, since only 5 at this time will have exclusive rights, each company,
depending on where they service the dispensaries could make @ 52 million a piece. Add the power of IVXX
and I know that will increase.


The "market" does not seem to understand these potentials at all and is valuing TRTC like any other down on
your luck Cannabis company with no business plan, no futures and no licenses.

"I hope he does what ECIG failed and successfully becomes the first Cannabis publicly traded "


What made you think ECIG was a MJ company? I never saw one mention by the company of even the
slightest intent in that direction.


"The "market" does not seem to understand these potentials at all and is valuing TRTC like any other down

The biggest reason at the moment why TRTC is at current PPS is because there is uncertainty over the
funding of these operations. They are burning through cash and their past/current financing choices are toxic,
which suppresses PPS.


The moment TRTC announces they are fully funded (meaning money in the bank) for let's stay humble and
start with two dispensaries, WITHOUT toxic sources, the market will start to look at TRTC more positive
again. If they keep using toxic financers, things will get worse.


I've seen private companies with A LOT less going for them raise more money on better terms than what
TRTC seems to be able to find. That's just pathetic, or maybe just lazy.

<<What made you think ECIG was a MJ company? I never saw one mention by the company of even the

ECIG is an OTC security that attempted to up-list to the exchange board and failed, they also make Marijuana
peripheral devices such as vape pens for consuming Cannabis among other Cannabis and non Cannabis
related devices.


<The biggest reason at the moment why TRTC is at current PPS is because there is uncertainty over the
funding of these operations. They are burning through cash and their past/current financing choices are toxic,
which suppresses PPS.>


You give these penny Stock "investors" too much credit Belgium, they are not the same as Berkshire
Hathaway or IBM investors who read financial statements, listen to quarterly conferences, analyses Press
releases and so forth. My co worker and people on message boards mentioned that they have no time to
read all of that, they are just in to flip the security, it goes up, they sell, it drops they re-buy. On the TRTC
Facebook, people there are just asking when Nevada is going to go live, they do not read financial statement
and corporate deals such as Financing never do they care. They do not care about the potential of IVXX
(which as i mentioned is HUGE) or Edible Garden they for the most part talk about when Nevada is going live.
If any of these OTC "investors" managed to purchase based upon forward earnings and realise the potential
of Nevada, and California, or the ancillary products IVXX's potential they would realise when they have those
systems online, within a year or two it would completely negate the 39 million loss they have since inception,
However, they do not think like that, I do and that is why I purchased this security.


The reason, in my opinion why TRTC's share price is at an all time low is:


"Traders" are bailing out of the entire sector on the OTC quotation system, every one of them are down (I do
not include GW Pharm. or INSYS since they are on a national exchange board and a different class of
investors are there Investors, not intraday day traders). GW Pharm. has minimal revenues to date and if it
was on the OTC, it would also be like all the other securities at all time low. 
Secondly the vast majourity of these "investors" are not saavy enough to read the securities they are buying
for future earnings potential, they are just intraday trading and purchase and sell on buzzword. I normally do
not invest in OTC securities but saw the potential of this sector for the few that are legitimate. So far it is the
worse investment I had ever made (expected since it is on the OTC with OTC "investors"), however, it could
be the best investment I had ever made down the line, a chance I am willing to take.


<The moment TRTC announces they are fully funded (meaning money in the bank) for let's stay humble and
start with two dispensaries, WITHOUT toxic sources, the market will start to look at TRTC more positive
again. If they keep using toxic financers, things will get worse>


TRTC's previous financing were decent, 5% of VWAP within 20 trading days and a 8% annual interest. I do
have an issue with the last one with several unknown investors at 25% VWAP for 20 trading days and 12%
annual interest. That appeared from nowhere and was most likely done in a hurry due to the toxicity (I have
seen mush much worse, up to 80% VWAP for 1 year and 18% interest). Of course being Wall Street

investment bankers, Peterson and Nahuss could do a lot better. I expect them too solely on that. I hope they
can hedge their cash flow from EG and IVXX (I believe that will be cash flow positive a lot sooner than it took
EG too due to its minimal overhead) in lieu of payments instead of share going forward.


At this point apart from going to an exchange board which is not happening, this company will move if or
when they are building Nevada system and when they are finally online, anything else will most likely not
move the company, IVXX's revenues (they could have 2.5 millions next quarter it will do nothing for the
company's share price), EG, not even if they obtain New York State license, only Nevada build-out at this
time. From My co workers and other people they are only concerned with Nevada. Sad thinking but that is the
way it is for now

ECIG is not an MJ company and doesn't pretend to be in the sector. Did you look at their brands/portfolio?


"You give these penny Stock "investors" too much credit Belgium"


For people to hold a penny stock for a longer time they need to feel relatively "safe", and we all know when
that feeling went away. The constant fear mongering across the various boards of the entire sector keeps
people anxious and reluctant to dip in again/add/hold. Especially with the fundamentals of these companies
still in shambles.


For TRTC first it was the SEC will halt, didn't happen. Then it was they will never get licensed in Nevada.
They got 6 or 8. Then it was, those licenses are only provisional licenses. Well, that's how the process in
Nevada works, so there is nothing abnormal about that, they will get fully licensed after they've jumped
through all the hoops and the fully operational sites are inspected. Then it was they will not touch the plant,
they did with IVXX. Then it was SEC will halt and FBI will raid because of IVXX and being federally illegal,
didn't happen because they are fully compliant. Then it was IVXX is in California which is not for profit, that's
not a problem for the first years anyway and there are ways around that if needed. By the time they are
running on full steam the legal situation in California will most likely have changed (drawing them right now).


But yesterday I read the best one yet on a board: The filing said IVXX had a 189K loss!!! Disaster!!! Well of
course, clown, IVXX is 5 months old, and that was their first operational quarter with what, 18 days of sales?
What did this poster expect? Profitable from the go? Hilarious...


For investors to feel "safe" or "comfortable" holding, these companies need to build investor confidence by
improving fundamentals, delivering on promises, making shareholder friendly decisions and communicating
clearly.


Not by being greedy, lining pockets and signing toxic deals.


"TRTC's previous financing were decent"


Everything with VWAP is toxic. And those "one up" shares or whatever you want to call them are the spiral
part.


"Peterson and Nahuss could do a lot better"

I agree, they are using the easy way. They need to get real investors on board that see and understand the
vision, and that also means they have to clean up their act.


"IVXX (I believe that will be cash flow positive a lot sooner than it took EG too due to its minimal overhead)"


EG would have been cash flow positive sooner with NB I believe, but luckily they choose to go full throttle on
MJ.


IVXX is going to be a monster. This is just the start. And there are other things that can come out of the lab as
well. IP, patents? Vape pen cartridges? Other products, delivery methods? Edibles? All in due time perhaps...


The issue here is funding, money in the bank.

"this company will move if or when they are building Nevada system and when they are finally online,
anything else will most likely not move the company,"


IMO it will depend on their funding sources. If they choose the toxic route, the only move the stock will make
is south or sideways, with or without Nevada in progress. Because every time they use the credit line, the
lenders will sell, suppressing the share price (while getting more shares to sell). It's as simple as that.

out of the county 8, three will not obtain a State license (the ones that did not CONSENT TO RELEASE NOT
PROVIDED) 
Nevada Medical Marijuana Dispensary - ranked 33 
med men of Nevada - ranked 27 
global harmony ranked 32


Three of the county 8 that did consent to release that will obtain State licenses are: 
Just Quality (ranked 19 and 20) for two dispensaries 
Polaris Dispensary - ranked 23


This leaves ranking 21, 22, 24, 25 and 26 open and the other 8 county that CONSENT TO RELEASE NOT
PROVIDED are: 
GB Sciences Nevada,  
Nevada Holistic Medicine  
Fidelis Holdings  
Desert Inn Enterprises.


I assume some of these but not all are within the State rankings of 19 -27. I expect more lawsuits from some
of the county 8 that are outside of the 27 ranked. I do not know what happened with the 19th of May

<< Because every time they use the credit line, the lenders will sell, suppressing the share price (while getting

Actually, the enhanced equity line with Magna, TRTC themselves sells the securities when they need the
cash, it is totally under their control. Of course, the more valuable the share price, the less shares TRTC have
to sell which equates to less dilution. The S-1 they filed with the SEC I believe permits 57,416,667 shares to
be sold. At 0.10 cents that would raise about 5.7 million excising all shares, however, if the share price was
0.70 cents, the full amount would be 40.1 million. I doubt if the credit line has a 40.1 million ceiling, however,
TRTC would only need to liquidate a much smaller amount of shares due to the share price which will benefit
everybody. Edible Gardens and IVXX should be net income positive sooner than later and will be self
sufficient, I reason the S-1 registration was for Nevada's 11 million built out. Peterson has his work cut out for
him.

I am long like him, but TRTC has other things to take care such as getting production / cultivation / its own
dispensaries in California, where 50% of all the market will originate (IVXX is fine for now, but they really need
to have the above I mentioned), Edible Gardens and IVXX needs to be net income positive, Nevada needs to
be operational with more than 1 dispensary, they need Clark County and the 33 million convertible shares per
the 10Q needs to be executed. They did drop their long term debt from 4 million plus to 2.2 million in one year

He also stated that he is a physician. if so, why is he constantly on IHUB or Facebook posting every day
seemingly every several hours. He should be at work. Why is this physician investing in "Penny stocks" He is
a physician after all making a substantial amount of cash. And why did he posted that he will cash out at
$1.00, $2.50 and $3.00 if he has such grandier vision about this company?


Some of what he says is true, but he is still an annoying gnat that should keep his "enthusiasm" to himself.


And there is NO guarantee TRTC will obtain the remaining two licenses in coveted Clark County on the 2nd of
September. This lawsuit has been going on since November of 2014. Only issue is that the 11 unused
licenses the State will give to other counties, CC cannot obtain any of them until they resolve the state 8
issues and if they deny them again, they will never get those other licenses. Even if they did, I doubt the
market will react anyway. The market may react once Los Vegas is open and making money, not before that

I believe they are several thousands SB compliance dispensaries currently in California. 237 is close to 250

TRTC is moving forward, no matter what the naysayers claim, or what the "sleekalikes" claim. The truth is obviously
somewhere in the middle. Does TRTC have issues? No denying that, but at least they are making progress.


IMO management is slowly starting to realize the potential they have in their hands, but I believe some hard decisions
will need to be made asap.

Management always knew the potential they have, why do you think Peterson "resigned" as a Wall Street
Investment Banker back in 2010 and ventured into the Cannabis business? Executing his vision is a complete
different ball park. Peterson said it best when he decided not to venture into Alaska, Oregon, Colorado or
Washington State "they are saturated" and "the Bay area in California makes more in Medical Marijuana than
the entire State of Colorado did for Recreational and Medical Marijuana in 2014. He knows California is a
must of any state.

Belgium: 
Colorado is about the size of Western Sahara in Africa or half the size of France and has a population of 3
million people, however, Colorado have over 700 dispensaries in that state, that is not to mention any
production / cultivation. California, has a lot more but has about 55 million people the size of Cameroon. It is
also the 5th largest economy on the planet. Colorado is saturated, too many players in a small state with a
small population.


Nevada, on the other hand has slightly less that 3 million, is a lot larger in size ( slightly larger than Ecuador)
and due to the Las Vegas strip, has over 40 million visitors. Add to the fact that only 10 at this point can take
the advantage of 8 million people per square mile and you have to agree Colorado as well as the other states

are saturated. The profits from Nevada will be like nothing seen before due to the "significantly" less players.
And as other states around Colorado legalises Cannabis, the revenues of that state will drop like a hot poke
stick causing many of the Cannabis business severe contraction in revenues. Right now, Colorado is the
ONLY game in town in that area and people from other states are will to travel, that will change. I researched
in this very carefully, it seems Peterson did also, hence why he decided not to get involved in Colorado,
Washington, Alaska (I do not know his views on Washington Dc)


Peterson was given the honour to resign or to get the boot, he was moonlighting (working a core job and
having another job on the side). many companies do not like that. If he did not give up his side job, he would
be terminated.


Peterson mentioned that nobody in management has ever ran a publicly traded company before, your issue
and others of the team obtaining a huge (subjective) salary at the expense of the shareholders when the PPS
does not reflect their achievement is immaterial when if you look at the 10Ks and other progressions, you
know this company is doing better and better every quarter. What other company in this sector has
accomplished what TRTC has done since inception? None. As Peterson mentioned during the first Earnings
back in May "If investors do not like what I am doing or the company, do not invest in my company". It is that
simple. Am I upset the share price is where it is? Do I feel the company is undervalued? Yes. Is this totally
Peterson's fault? Not 100%. I suggest people get over it or sell their shares and never look back. They will,
according to Peterson, have an Audit and Compensation committee and another committee by end of year.
As long as these people are independent individuals, with no ties to any corporate people with the
shareholders interest as first priority I have no issues with this.


In my opinion management always knew the potential, they could had been a commodity, like the nameless
other companies out there, instead they created a brand. Peterson knows that the Cannabis prices will
contract and brands will only survive. Starbucks is a perfect example, people could purchase pre-made
Coffee like Maxwell House for cheaper or pay $4.50 for a small cup. The branded coffee Starbucks He had
mentioned this many times. He could had opened the Las Vegas dispensary in the summer if he just mended
the existing infrastructure, he chose to gut the place to an empty shell and design according to his vision (in
Oakland Blum which according to Yelp has 4 of 5 stars).


Belgium, you used to to positive on Peterson, I notice lately you have been very critical on him and his
decisions. I am not in favour of all his decisions but the bottom line is speaking for itself

What will happen when or If Arizona (very likely), Utah (unlikely), Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas (likely and over 22 million people) and New Mexico legalises Cannabis. You think Colorado will sustain
the now over 1 billion in revenues per year? Of course not. People from those states will no longer have any
reason to engage in what they are doing now: Driving to Colorado. There are few States that will be
somewhat immune to it due to sheer size or some form of entertainment destination: Florida, New York,
California, Nevada, and Washington DC. Colorado will contract and the revenues will drop significantly, trust
me on this, it will happen.

As of now, like I mention, Colorado is the only State in that area that legalised it, try to follow those companies
if most of the above States that borders Colorado legalises Cannabis as well and you will agree that it is
saturated. Right now Colorado, is taking not just its 3 million people, BUT other millions from border states.
The amount of players Colorado has is too much just for Colorado's 3 million people but more than enough
for Colorado PLUS the millions of the border States citizens which is the case. If they had a population like
Florida, New York, Texas or California, I would agree with you, however, they do not. They have 3 million plus
people.


<<They could have done this sooner, avoiding a lot the BS from the past year.It's not just the
bonuses/salaries , there is/was a lot more going on>>


Based upon what I am reading and the investor questions for the past two quarter, the vast majourity of the
issues with Peterson is related to excessive bonuses to corporate while the company "is not doing well" which
is primarily the PPS. The second most question was the PIPE financing which is killing the stock price. Now
with this enhanced equity line of credit, Peterson has a good reason to get the share price high enough that
he does not have to dilute as many shares when he cashes out. We see what happens.


<<Does this mean TRTC is great? Or just that the rest is complete shhhh? I don't compare them to the rest, I
look at TRTC on it's own. But yes, at least they are following trough.>>


No other Cannabis OTC is engaging in this and Peterson could have said "stuff it" and follow the normal
routine of any OTC security but he chose a different route. Like I mentioned he and his team, this is their First
time ever running a publicly traded company (he himself mentioned this), and they will and have made
mistakes, it goes with learning. You expect him to be like the Monaco Football team or the Tahiti Football
team (all but one were people like you and I, non professional players) beating Real Madrid in the Champions
League final or Spain during the last Confederation Cup in Brasil? Peterson has made mistakes, no doubt but
he is new at this, he is not a seasoned pro. At the very least, his numbers per quarter is getting better and
better and that is something we can agree upon. If that was not the case, there would be a big problem
(incompetence). He is hungry and is learning from his mistakes.

Right now the whole company isn't set up to benefit shareholders, but insiders. I'm not saying that that's the
way it will play out, but right now, that's what it looks like. Peterson can/could have taken certain steps to
ensure shareholders that they will be rewarded, instead of just footing the bills. And he hasn't so far, that's
why the salaries and bonuses are/were so hard to swallow.


"He is hungry and is learning from his mistakes."


They are making improvements, hence the reason I said they are slowly starting to realize the potential if they
do things right.

It does not work like that. States that legalises Cannabis will want their own citizens to be the producers /
dispensary owners not some other group from other states that are monopolising the industry. Florida is a
perfect example, you need to be in that state for 30 years. So far New York and Nevada (those the companies
had to be part owned by Nevada corporation or entity to be admitted) did not have that issue (not familiar with
the other states) Yes they are WAYS / LOOPHOLES around it but most of those 700 companies in Colorado
are small time players, not the Privateers, Harbourside of California, the largest dispensary by revenue that is
going to expand or Terra Techs that want to expand However, if a company BRANDS a commodity, like what
Privateer plans to do with Marley's Natural internationally or Terra Tech's IVXX, they do not need o have
physical control in those states. That would be a different ball game completely and one that will be profitable.
That part I will agree with you...

I do not see them deviating from that plan, that is why he purchased Edible Gardens in the first place, to have
a national grow house using Dutch style hydroponics, according to Peterson, the first in this country. You
know something different that I am unaware off Belgium? If he does a "Mcig" or "ERBB", i would be very
disappointed.

That's the part I was talking about, who cares about owning a couple retail locations if you can have your

I know the Van Vrandes has land in Washington State and Indiana. Indiana is a no no for any form of
Cannabis and Peterson mentioned Washington State's policies are countre productive so he decided at this
time not to engage in it. As of now, he has Nevada and New Jersey for Greenhouses even though Nevada
does not permit them in the same format as New Jersey. It is a start.


At several million dollars per greenhouse, Peterson just does not have the funds to have his vision come true
at this point. Maybe in the future, he will. As I mentioned many times, he needs to get California up and
running with more than just IVXX since about 50% of all Cannabis revenues in the USA originate from that
State alone. He can effectively kill 25 States with one. Luckily he is headquartered in California and has a

Have you spoken to him via investor relations or direct email about this proposal Belgium? I know when too
many investors complained to him about attempting to obtain licenses in New York, when he did not even
have his house in order in Nevada or California, Peterson backed off and decided not to pursue a license
there (also the fact that New York State wanted every single name of the owners of Terra Tech, which also
means the investors which at over 25,000, is a daunting task). I do know there is a regular greenhouse in the
Sunshine farms (TRTC has two partnerships in Florida currently).

Because New York was too expensive to even try to obtain a license, not to mention the very restrictive
program once you may have gotten a license (limited products, set prices). It was simply not justifiable at this
time.

Bond, James.Bond. The only reasonable explanation for someone suggesting that cannabis is "likely" to be
legalized in "Kansas" any time in the near future is that the person making such a claim must be under the
influence of "cannabis" at the time. I say this because the legislature and Governor Brownback are holier-
than-thou tea-publicans who suffer no pangs of ambivalence about foisting their particular version of what
constitutes morality upon their state's victims, I mean, citizens.


All kidding aside, I would gladly wager about any amount of $ that this will never, ever happen under the
current regime. And this, despite the potential tax benefits legalization might bring to the state especially in
light of the disastrous failure of their "trickle down economic experiment" of drastically lowering taxes which
has not only wiped out the state's budgetary surplus of hundreds of millions of dollars, but created a budget
deficit amounting to more than half a billion dollars, with no perceptible relief in sight.


That being said, I really wish you were right.

Those Bible States that borders Colorado, most of them will not legalise Cannabis for recreational, however, I
am sure they will for either CBD or medicinal. I indicated only Arizona has most likely, Utah as most unlikely
and the other States, I had no position on them, hence why they were blank. Some of those States have dry
towns and cities where Alcohol is illegal (that is a State's right).

<<By the way still holding my shares, I think TRTC is one of the very few penny MJ stocks that will break

I used to think TRTC and MCIG only back in March 2014. The other companies are not worth my time and will
be out of business in the long term, in my opinion, too much scams and mis-management for the rest 99.5%.
Not sure about MCIG anymore since it "abandoned" its core business and has diversified into so many other
businesses it looks like ERBB, which is never a good sign unless you saturated your prior business and was
successful.


My bet is that TRTC has the best chance of breaking away from the remainder of the OTC / Pink Sheet
companies probably by May of 2016 IF they have all their ducks in a row. The last 10Q was an improvement
but they still have a long way to go. Thankfully their net loss for Edible Gardens was reported to be I believe
200,000 + so that should be net income positive sooner than later. IVXX if the operating expenses are
contained will join EG since the margins are so much higher.

How about a higher amount of actual analysis on TRTC on this thread. Analysis is not, I think TRTC will be at ....... by

Analysis does have to do with calling and going to dispensaries and accurately telling what you find (e.g. does IVXX
have premium position near the register or on an endcap? How well is it selling through?) Where is TRTC with cash
on hand vs. what is needed to build out in Nevada? Is their GM improving? Are they earning anything? How much
operating cash flow are they burning each quarter and how many more quarters do they have until another raise will
become necessary?

You do not seem to have any faith in any of these OTC companies anymore based upon what you have been stating
for the past several months.

It wasn't close, it was just because of the confusion. They cleared it for the record immediately. They only had
one vote opposing.

He did mention back in 2014, January (at that time, I was not into MJ securities until March), he would expand
Edible Gardens in Nevada. Makes sense since he has that amount of land and over 30 million people would
be a cash cow. Maybe this is why he acquired so much land for one of his dispensary.

3.9 acre or 15,782.7 sq metres for a parking lot? He plans to have Based upon the PR I linked, he specifically
stated he would have Edible Gardens in Las Vegas to feed the restaurant and Casinos. A football field in
Europe is between 6400 sq m and 8250 sq m You know how many cars can fit into that? Hundreds. This is
not Manhattan, NYC, I do not believe this is for cars.

This one, 3650 South Decatur Blvd. (3.9 acres), not the 1130 East Desert Inn Road in which those pictures

This location on 3650 South Decatur Blvd looks like a strip mall, I do not see 3.9 acres of land attached to it,

It seems that I was mistaken and the zoned area is included in the 3.9 acres of land which like you mentioned

Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
Some silly financial details I thought others might be interested in:


Based on the latest 10Q TRTC has about $2 million in cash and another $1.3 million in other current assets (accounts
payable, inventory, etc.) for a total of $3.3 million. Against that they have $5.3 million in current liabilities (amounts
they owe over the next year). This is a current ratio well below 1. To be fair however, $1.4 million of those liabilities are
derivative liabilities which will likely not be paid in cash (instead they will be paid via share conversions but more on
that later). So TRTC has $3.9 in net cash current liabilities vs. $3.3 million in current assets ($2 million of which is
previous underwater convertible debt coming due) or a shortfall of .6 million in additional cash needed.


Unfortunately, that is not the whole story. They also need to build out Nevada at an cost which they estimate of $11
million. This did not include the 2 new dispensaries they will certainly want to build out as soon as possible, so lets
assume $12 million total for NV buildout. Additionally, TRTC is burning about $1 million per quarter of cash in existing
operations, assuming startup of operations in NV breaks even for it's first year, that's $4 million in operating cash flow
burn for the year. So TRTC is going to need to raise approximately $16-$17 million in additional funds over the next
year ($16.6 million = .6 million + 12 million + 4 million). The best guess on what terms they will likely get would be the
terms from the last raise.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 131/163


Lets talk a little about those raises, existing debt, dilution, etc. The last raise was $3 million in tranches (12% interest)
convertible into common at 75% of the LOWEST VWAP over the previous month (20 trading days). If I were that
lender, I certainly would have done what selling I could. Lowest VWAP was about 8¢ which means conversion would
have been about 6¢. The stock traded at 14¢ - 20¢, with that big chunk of 12 million shares sold at 17¢ in the last two
days of July, so about a 180% gain. Yep, I would have been all over that. Additionally, there are holders of warrants
for 7 million common shares at 6¢, 4 million in the teens, and another 15 million at 21¢.


My point is there is some serious overhang of shares in the teens. Any move by TRTC into the teens (like now) will be
met by selling. In my opinion TerraTechs business opportunities are wonderful but there is effectively a cap on TRTC
shares in the teens for the next year.


Disclosure - no position long or short in TRTC nor any intention of initiating one of the next 72 hours

You have some catching up to do Darren...


03 Sep 2015, 12:58 PM


James.Bond
I do not know if you listen to the Quarterly earnings Peterson now have but your analysis is wrong. I will name several
of your mistakes.


< They also need to build out Nevada at an cost which they estimate of $11 million. This did not include the 2 new
dispensaries they will certainly want to build out as soon as possible>


The 11 million is included ALL 8 locations if they obtained it PLUS 4-5 years of operations. The 11 million is not 100%
for the buildup. Peterson discussed this many times in PRs and his quarterly earnings conference. You are not paying
attention to what he is saying at all. For example, the Dispensaries are 500,000 for the built out WITH 4-5 years of
operational expenses. Obviously, they will start to acquire income, so that number will be significantly lower. This was
explained by Peterson when he received 6 of 8 license. He did indicate if they receive all 8, this would be the amount
needed.


Peterson stated he will NOT build out Washoe County's production / Cultivation because Clark County production /
cultivation at this point is sufficient. He stated he will USE existing profits from the Nevada operations to build out the
Washoe County later, that will be -4.5 million TRTC do not need.


Edible Gardens per 10Q had a net income lost of @ -230,000 and IVXX about the same amount. It is safe to say that
both will be self sufficient in no time and will not be a burden of the rest of TRTC.


My only concern about the financing per the 10Q is that they have over 33 million shares to be converted by lenders,
that is a lot and could stall the share price if they decide to sell one after another. A lot of these were priced at 0.75,
0.60, 0.40 last year which indicates that those lenders are not going to convert any time soon, else they would had
back last year when it was over 1.00.


When I find all of these sources for proof since I am currently at work, I will link them here. But Darren, you are so
wrong, I am surprised. All of this from Peterson is readily available for several months now.

Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
I appreciate the feedback James and Belgium and will certainly look further at anything you care to link.
Thanks.


You two are both correct that I may have much more to learn. My conclusions were based on a 1-2 hour
perusal of the last 10Q. At that point I thought I knew enough to say no thanks but maybe there is more to it.
Again, I really do appreciate you telling me specifically why I got it all wrong and providing backup links.


One thing on what you said however, if Peterson is saying the amount is net of buildout and operations over
the next 5 years, and operations are expected to be profitable, then wouldn't the buildout number be even
higher?


03 Sep 2015, 01:37 PM


James.Bond
<< then wouldn't the buildout number be even higher?>>


Why would it be higher? Nevada is not New York City, Metropolitan Washington DC or Los Angeles in which
real estate is always on the move, higher. Nevada is a relatively poor state (had the most foreclosed homes
during the housing boom-bust of 2008) and cheap real estate. if this was NYC, then Peterson's projection
would last him a year and a half. I doubt the real estate will jump like it does in the above mentioned cities /
areas.


During one of his quarterly conferences, he indicated that the dispensaries will run 500,000 for each (again
the build out and 4-5 years of operations), that is 2 million right there. The cultivations are 3 million each and
productions 1.5 million each. Right now, he just has 2 million to worry about, he mentioned the Clark County
production / cultivation will be online by Q4 2016 which is plenty of time to use some cash from his operations
if any. IF he gets all four dispensaries up (Las Vegas scheduled for @5th of October of this year, Reno,
January of 2016 are facts) and IF he get the two Clark County dispensaries by end of this year or 1Q 2016,
due to the high margins, he can use the profits (something he can also do with Edible Gardens which is
already cash flow positive and almost net income positive) to continue to build out the remainder of the
cultivation/ productions in Nevada instead of issuing shares. IVXX, being non profit, cannot use profits out of
the state and cannot be used for Nevada.


03 Sep 2015, 02:52 PM


Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
James.Bond,


I don't know what to say to clarify except to re-word and give an example I guess. It has absolutely nothing to do with
whether I think real estate prices are going up or down, or what they are in Vegas vs. New York, Los Angeles or
Atherton, CA. I really don't know why that was brought into it. The company estimates buildout of NV at $11 million in
the 10Q. That's not my estimate it's there's.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 133/163


An example (this is an example for clarification purpose only, because apparently I was not clear enough, not
something I expect): Net buildout and operations over next 5 years -$11 million (given by management in 10Q).
Expected operating profit 2016 $0, 2017 $1m, 2018 $2m, 2019 $4m for a total expected operating profit of +$7m (no
basis in reality just an example of a positive operating profit in order to clarify). Over the next 5 years, if net of buildout
and operations is -$11m and operations is +$7m then buildout cost is expected to be -$18m. If he says $11 million is
net of buildout and operations over the next 5 years, and operations is expected to be a net positive, then the buildout
is higher than $11 million. Furthermore, buildout expense by definition has to happen prior to any operating earnings
so I would expect most of the cost to be front loaded. Yes, he could and probably needs to only build Vegas first. So
cut it in half if you want. That's still at least $6 million that has to be raised, plus covering the current working capital
shortfall, plus covering 4 quarters of operating cash flow burn.


I welcome you to make your own estimate of how much they will have to raise over the next year provided it has an
explanation of how you got to that number (otherwise it just useless rah, rah, baloney). My main point is they will have
to raise more money and there is already huge overhang of shares in the teens, so their is effectively a cap in the
teens until they work through the overhang. Any increase over 20¢ (or really even over 15¢) is likely to be almost
immediately met with large sales from debt holder conversions.


As for Edible Gardens. Edible Gardens is not even close to being almost net income positive. One only has to look at
the last quarters loss from operations of $3.1 million on the income statement to see that is baloney. Saying stuff like
that just makes you less credible and worse over time you might actually start to believe it. You are hurting yourself.
Edible Gardens did just turned gross margin positive (woohoo a whole 5% GM%). It is not even close to paying for
their Opex. Here's the 10Q, please check it out for yourself: http://1.usa.gov/1N62MfT Edible Gardens is great
because it allows them to build greenhouses, distribution networks and expense it all now. Edible Gardens however is
and will remain a low margin business. It is all about the marijuana; Edible Gardens is only valuable as a precursor to
marijuana.


I don't mean to be negative but common let's not make this another rah, rah, high on hype, low on analysis site. We
can do better.


03 Sep 2015, 04:36 PM

It's not 11m but around 9(,5)m that the company has to come up with, spread out over 5 years. How much of
that is actual building/remodeling or payroll/etc , or how much is already put into a/some locations
(architects/contractors, etc) isn't clarified.


Those 5 years start once they start at that location. We can start to debate what exactly the start is. But there
is no debate that the company already made a plan to spread out the 8 locations in time anyways (no doubt
with funds in mind).


Balancing the build out and the company's cash burn will be a daunting task. There are a couple of things that
need to fall into place, and Derek has options. We will need to wait and see how it plays out.


I agree Darren, a lot of people seem to think that those locations will be instant cash cows once build. But it
just doesn't work that way.

Your scenario above. it appears that you are moving operating expenses (loss) from the balance sheet to that
of CAPEX (Capital Expenses, the amount of buildout), You CANNOT do that, it is illegal. CAPEX is CAPEX,
operating expenses is operating expenses, By engaging in that trickery it appears the company is more
healthier than it really is by expensing the lost as a CapEx .


This accountant http://bit.ly/1Ohv0mM engaged in that and went to prison for four years. Any operating loss is
independent of the amount it took for the build-out, in accounting they are under two different areas of the
financial statement. Thank goodness you are not TRTC's CFO.


About Edible Gardens, per their 10Q "an operating loss of $3,099,232 was realized for the quarter." This
LOST is for ALL DIVISIONS COMBINED of the company, the entire company. I specifically mentioned Edible
Garden. Edible Garden was NOT 3.1M lost as you claimed, it was about - 250,000 as I stated many times
before and will be net income positive with IVXX sooner than later, the Blum / Medifarm division is what is
holding up the entire company with massive losses.


And about Vegetables being a low margin entity, it is, however, the market is tens of billions per year. EG just
needs a fraction of that to be very profitable.


Not only do you have a lot of catching up per Belgium, you also need to know how to read financial
statements. Based upon these, I will not furnace proof of links to my above discussion, you have to engage in
Due Diligence yourself, I wish you the very best Darren.


04 Sep 2015, 12:05 PM


Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
James,


I was referring to cash needs. Rereading what I wrote, that was pretty darn clear. It was all about them having
to continue to borrow more money (whether for funding operations losses, or capital buildouts) and the
likelihood of ongoing selling by debt holders in the mid teens. That you chose not to see that is your
perogative.


As for my abilility to read financial statements. My qualifications include a bachelors in Economics, an MBA
with concentration in Finance, a certificate in personal financial planning, and over 15 years of successively
more responsible experience in the corporate financial planning and analysis field. This experience has
included numerous M&A transactions, ROI/NPV/budget/forecast modeling for new plants, projects, products
lines, etc. I therefore feel reasonably well qualified to both read and provide forecasts of the income
statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement.


This will be my last contribution here on this subject, as I am starting to feel like I'm just getting the typical
non-productive attacks and accusations people tend to get on websites when they say something that can be
seen as negative about an equity. I truly welcome contrary information as it helps me become a better
investor however I have received little information I find useful in return (Belgium and I can converse offline)
and you have clearly indicated you don't wish to bother.

Come on guys, let's keep this civilized. You spend to much time on iHub James :-)


Darren is right that TRTC has a long way to go, funding these endeavors will be the pickle. I've been yelling
for a almost a year that they didn't seem to realize their own potential and needed to get their act together. 
The books are slowly starting to improve/make a turn for the better.


The last PP was a better way of financing (should have worked on this a lot sooner), but we'll have to see if
they can get more of those. Even if all the future financing is in form of PP, they still have some overhang from
the previous financing rounds. And that's exactly what Darren is saying.


However, there are a couple options. One of them is already in place: spreading the build out of the various
locations in time. Another option becomes available October 1st, when the licenses become marketable. Give
up 1 dispensary license to finance (part of) the other locations? Not saying they should or will, but it'll become
an option.

Good catch Belgium!! It was only $500,000 loan before, I did not even read the amended updated from the
10Q. They gotten an additional $750,000 from the same partner, Forever Green NV, LLC, hopefully, they will
take the profit out from the gross profits and not converted shares.


The $1.2M is good for virtually all of the dispensaries in Nevada (if you include the 5 years operating
expenses) I know Peterson said Reno dispensary will open by January, so I hope this is for Las Vegas and
Clark County. Who knows Belgium, this partner may continue to engage in this which as long as it is not
dilutive to the shareholders, will be very welcoming as they have cash now to build out. Especially now since
they just gotten two (2) SUP from Clark County, I hope Forever Green agrees to fund them more build out
money :)


<<Forever Green NV, LLC, a member of both MediFarm I and MediFarm II, has agreed to contribute
approximately $500,000 in the form of debt to MediFarm I and approximately $750,000 in the form of debt to
MediFarm II. We will be obligated to contribute the remaining amount, or approximately $9.75 million in the
aggregate, for all three subsidiaries. >>

I like the straight "Bank loan" from one of their partners Forever Green a LOT better than with complete
strangers, as long as Peterson does not have to pay back with shares of common stock and can have a
payment arrangement with them.


I myself stated many times that TRTC has a long way to go, Peterson during the earnings conference
admitted that himself, that is not in dispute. They are getting there.

It's always dilutive , because they get shares for their money.

That is not an option Belgium, that is corporate suicide. If Nevada votes recreational, the amount of funds
they received for that license would be terrible to its potential. Like I mentioned just a while ago, they need to
hedge their IVXX's future profits or their Blum's future profits and use those as collateral to obtain a straight
non-dillutive loan like the $750,000 loan they received from their Medifarm partner, Forever Green (I hope it is

Based upon what I read about companies that cannot fund their dispensaries in Nevada and are selling them
to other companies, the going price is 2 million for cultivation and 4 million for a dispensary. And one
Canadian firm is actually buying several of these at those price, stating that in the long term, they would had
gotten a bargain. Brian Sandoval, governor of Nevada earlier this year signed into law the ability to transfer
and sell licenses to other entities.


Do not know if Peterson will add these as assets to the balance sheet in November (he has four dispensaries,
those alone would be about 16 Million). That does not even include the 2 production / cultivation and the
extraction lab. And this is what the market is currently supporting prior to October.

For the entire company, not the subsidiary Edible Gardens which I was referring to. Otcmarket.com / TRTC, I checked
out the subsidiary Edible Gardens net income lost for the quarter and it was around -250,000, NOT 3.1 million, the
company lost about that amount the last quarter, not a single subsidiary (PRODUCE / CANNABIS). in that case, I still
stand EG is close to being net income positive as a subsidiary not the other column that had a -3. million plus lost,
that is not what i was referring.


I have to respond to this properly when I am not at work, but your analogy is flawed (especially about the build up
needing more funds as time goes on which is simple accounting which is not true) and I can poke many holes into it. I
have no idea where you made my analogy, it boggles me because in the accounting world, it does not happen like
that in running a business. I generally know what I am talking about and I am sorry, on this one you are wrong, but I
will respond and disprove that off work.


And what do you have against 420 investor website? I personally engage in my own Due Diligence. I NEVER rely on
anybody to make financial decisions for me, I will read what they say and make my own mind.


<<Furthermore, buildout expense by definition has to happen prior to any operating earnings so I would expect most
of the cost to be front loaded>>


Not true, they can build what they need to operate, and with the cash they produce ( the term is called skeleton or
bare bones operations), employ that and continue the build out on NON - essential things. They do not need to build
out 100% prior to operating a business. I wish I could make this clearer to you.

converted yet over a year. That is the kind of analogy I have seen from you that makes zero sense. If I am a

My guess would be about May of 2016, by that time all of Nevada would be operational except that cultivation
/ production (unless hey build out one instead of two), IVXX and Edible Gardens should have enough time to
be net income positive, New Jersey, if they obtain the MME license, should be online and hopefully California
has more than just IVXX (dispensaries, MME licenses in Southern California, production and cultivation).
Beyond that, it may be be sideways from now until then

If This new distributor company can get IVXX into more dispensaries (IVXX in house managed about 70 in 5 months

Nobilis had to act, because there were class actions against them being thrown together after the hit piece.


But at least they acted, still nothing from TRTC...

James.Bond
Yes, I read all of those solicitors filing lawsuits on Nobilis after the PPS dropped 300 million, if they can prove what the
Emperor has no clothes wrote is false information (similar to Lennar Home builders short scam several years ago,
that short fund was found guilty and fined putting them out of business), Anson will be out of business. Unlike TRTC
which they actually called the "employer in Nevada" and told them facts such as the FBI raided TRTC's office, the
only event that happened with Nobilis was the hit piece.


Peterson, during the Q2 in August conference stated he was several weeks from filing a suit in New Jersey against
Anson Fund. It is most likely not a priority for TRTC to disclose what is transpiring unlike Nobilis, who had massive
class action suits that affected them more severely. I am certain that Peterson will update what happened on Monday
unless Anson fund already settled privately without court's intervention, just a guess on my part.


Nobilus is a Canadian company, so it is very easy for them to file a suit with Anson which is also a Canadian company
as opposed to TRTC which is an American company.


The Nobilus shareholders are also filing a class action suit against the Anson Fund as well from what I read, they are
suing both companies.

Interesting, apparently Derek Peterson and the board of TRTC felt that the $14 million in revenue Bloom is expected
to deliver plus it's long term prospects was worth increasing share count by 60%. The bloom shareholders would hold
about 37% of the combined entity: http://yhoo.it/1mVQOwQ


By my calculation if the preferred's issued in the transaction were fully converted to common, this would be about
235.2 million shares worth about $21.2 million at yesterday's closing price of 9¢ per share. The press release seems
accurate when they stated they paid about 1.5x expected revenue for Bloom. The market apparently liked the deal
however so if fully converted to common Derek and other Bloom shareholders would get shares worth about $25.9
million at today's closing price of 11¢. Fair enough, apparently the market thinks there are enough synergies that the
deal warrants the higher valuation.


I still wonder what is the new combined company is being valued at now that the shares are trading at 11¢? One
could extrapolate $25.9 million / 37% = $70 million however I'm not sure this is counting all shares including all debt
conversions, warrants, etc. How many potential shares are out there anyway, I have lost track? All these series B, Z,
Q, preferred's, various debt convertible at different VWAP's, etc. make it rather difficult to know what one might really
be buying.


The 8k on the deal is available here: http://1.usa.gov/1mVRyC7


TRTC did about $2 million last quarter in revenue. So $8 million revenue run rate + $14 million from Bloom = $22
million. But that's not really fair as I'd be surprised if the Nevada operations didn't do at least another $20 million in
revenue in 2016. So I'm going to say I very roughly expect $42 million in revenue in 2016. What is a company with a
rough expectation of $42 million in revenue next year and strong growth prospects but no net profit worth? If you say
they can eventually bring 10% to the bottom line and deserve a multiple of 15x earnings maybe $63 million? Put
another way, $63 million brings us back to 1.5x times expected sales.

And on the strength of the Blum purchase we are getting another round trip into the teens. I think this purchase is
beneficial for TRTC too; however, like I said before, there should be a lot of overhang / sellers in the teens that needs
to be churned through. Last few rallies were met with people probably converting and the resulting selling pressure at
25¢, then 20¢, then 18¢, then 15¢, then 14¢. Not lower lows, just lower highs, so it's not really a downward trend.
People with convertible debt at prices as low as 6¢ are probably converting and selling some every-time it gets into
the teens. It's what I would do in their situation.

TRTC came out with a 2016 revenue estimate of $20 - $22 million today. Blum did $14 million last year ($3.5 million
per quarter) and is expected to close end of March so figure 3 quarters or $10.5 million of that is existing Blum
business (not including growth). TRTC revenue was $2.1 million last quarter (essentiallly all Edible Gardens) so figure
$8.4 million run rate. Taking the midpoint, $21 million, less $10.5 Blum run rate and $8.4 million Edible Gardens run
rate, and you get $2.1 million (11%) expected growth. Rather underwhelming if you ask me. They also said, "The
predicted increase in year-over-year revenue is expected to be driven largely by sales from the Company's latest
acquisition, Blum Oakland, an established, retail medical cannabis dispensary in Oakland, CA, as well as continued
growth of the IVXX brand throughout the California and Nevada markets." So between the two it appears to me they
are expecting little to no revenue from the dispensaries or grows in Nevada this year other than maybe a little from
IVXX distribution.


Also doing a little more math, Edible Gardens was able to produce a 20% gross margin last quarter. 20% gross
margin on $8.4 million is $1.7 million. Corporate SG&A last quarter was $2.1 million or $8.4 million run rate assuming
zero growth in SG&A (very generous considering they bought Blum and will be building out Nevada). That means
there's $8.4 - $1.7 = $6.7 million in SG&A left to be covered in order to break even. To do that the non-edible garden
side of the business would need to do a 50% gross margin 2016, very unlikely. I therefore conclude TRTC is unlikely
to produce any net income in 2016.

My conclusions are their will likely be insignificant Nevada idspenciary and grow revenue contribution in 2016, no
overall company net income in 2016, a need to raise cash to build-out Nevada and fund continuing SG&A burn, and
there is heavy overhang of shares in the teens. This is why I do not own and am not buying TRTC at this time.

Darren:


I respect your opinion but only one thing I'd say. It ultimately comes down to the customer. If they like IVXX
they will succeed.


In my eyes, TRTC has done everything right to come into a shaky sector both legally and competitively (it's
cut throat) to lay down a position in this sector. They have Edible Gardens to back them up with revenue, they
are using Blum Oakland as a stepping stone and they have a medical marijuana product people like and even
love.


Everyone is particular on a fast food or certain soda or coffee, ect. The consumer will approach cannabis no
differently.


I believe IVXX is one of those just based on the chatter online about it on here, iHub, ect.


Respectfully and tentatively I think this is the next Pepsi and GLHD with the partnership with Dixie is the next
Coca Cola.


The fight will soon commence.

Your numbers makes sense but slightly flawed. One cannot average revenue from the EG side as they have
high and low quarters. They already have over 9 million in revenue for 2015 IMHO so your 8.4 is a tad too
conservative since they only started in May this year with a new extended contract with Walmart. IVXX last
quarter brought in over 400,000 from 180 stores in California. DP states they will be able to market IVXX in
early 2016 to 62 dispensaries in NEvada so add 150,000 for Q2 3 and 4. I agree dispensary revenue from
Nevada will be slight for 2016. Total liabilities should be zero by Q3 of 2016 based on reduction rate so far. 
TRTC is still venture capital in nature and a spec play. They are the only publicly traded company in California
and California and NEvada could go legal by end of 2016/2017 so entry now would be advantagious. They
have a plan to distribute IVXX nationwide (23 states so far) . One could loose all their investment in this stock
but the rewards should be substantial if they succeed. Everyone is in a different level.

Thebioengi,


Successful branding (unique and popular formula and taste, packaging, advertising to establish a presence
and association in people's minds, etc.) is very important but it is not all that is necessary and requires money
not just skill. Scalability of these things from the design of packaging to the font used for the name is key.
Furthermore, Coca-cola became ubiquitous not just because of successful branding and standardization but
actually pioneering a new form of distribution was probably even more important. It was one of the first
companies (if not the first) to establish a franchise partnership with bottlers that allowed it to gain regional,
country and eventually worldwide distribution. This was extremely important, as important as the branding.
Moreover, it all takes successful strategy and money to make happen. TRTC could get there but is currently
financially strapped with the toxic convertible debt limiting it. Also there are many others: ebbu, Dixie, and the
DeAngelo companies or three to keep an eye on who have a similar vision. But vision isn't enough, frankly
following the path Coca-cola pioneered isn't really vision anyway, it's knowledge, strategy and money.


Regardless, I'm not here to pick the winner or take part in an exciting new industry, I'm here to make money.
Their was a time when Medbox, Advanced Cannabis Solutions, and Growlife were thought likely winners,
until that changed. So the inherent risk needs to be reflected in what I pay compared to what I get. Paying
more than 4x forward sales (or more?) for a company with no profit and lots of risks is unwise. You don't know
Terra Tech will be the eventual winner anymore than you knew Medbox, Advanced Cannabis or Growlife was
going to be the winner a couple years back.

February, 3 months later. Since the valuation is holding up since the Oakland: Blum merger for the past two
weeks, I can state that most of the $614,000 Convertible notes are gone, or the remaining is not enough to

A scam?


It's not like a Martin Shkreli type thing, their CEO came from being a Morgan Stanley Exec to founding TRTC.


So he was not a scientist before being a CEO, does the morgan stanley thing bother you?


Their markup on their product is very minimal compared to Valeant, albeit they do not spend as much as
R&D.

Well I invested in them a little while ago. It just doesn't make sense to me how they seem to be Acquiring so
many companies with such little cash on hand and such little revenue/profitability. To me it seems to me like
they're making very small purchases with very little actual growth prospects. I feel like their press releases are
ploys to goad people into buying their stock and believing in their growth potential like so many other penny
stocks. Why do you think this company's stock price has plummeted? Because Wall Street is not confident in
its growth potential. Does trtc have any intellectual property of its own? Not to my knowledge. Feel free to
prove me wrong.

TRTC seems to be getting strong support around .14, maybe we finally bottomed out. Hopefully we will start seeing
higher lows.

TRTC is not listening to me. I did not say lower lows. But I'm getting a little to far ahead of myself. Still to much
delusion, although we need the money for the build outs. When delusion finally stops, then we should head north.

I believe this merge is going to benefit them immensely with Dixie Elixirs still in Colorado; this may prove a critical
merge to TRTC's success in this future sector.

What are you talking about?


1. Dixie is not just in Colorado  
2. You can't compare the two because dixie is not vertically integrated. Different business model.


12 Feb 2016, 02:50 PM


AFKScene
Noted on Dixie being in California (I didn't realize they had expanded out of State). Respectfully, I disagree
that you can't compare Dixie Elixirs to Terra Tech Corp. Reason being is they (out the door) sell products that
compete either directly or indirectly with Terra Tech's products. Overall, Dixie Elixirs in the United States is
their greatest threat because they are expanding their  
product line more aggressively than TRTC (IMO).

Dixie is not selling flowers, pre-rolleds, waxes, shatters, etc.


Dixie being their greatest threat? you must be joking, right?

Sure alan, but stil not the same products as trtc for now.


Maybe they'll start with edibles , and i certainly hope they'll come up with Vape cartridges. But they seem to
have trouble keeping up with IVXX demand already, so we'll have to wait and see.

There are a lot of companies in the exact same product category as trtc. (IVXX )


And others that are aiming at a retail chain. ( blum )


So claiming that dixie is their greatest competition is imo very far stretched.

Again I disagree,


You yourself said that Dixie is planning on expanding to Oregon (while already being located in California and
Colorado). Tell me of one other company as aggressive as Dixie in regards to expansion (private or public)
that is comparable aside from Terra Tech (and yes I know there are larger companies outside the U.S. but lets
keep it to the U.S. market for sake of the argument)?


I'm not asking to be condescending. I've yet to find any other company as aggressive as the two stated
above.


What would make all my concerns go away would be if they merged; but now that's dreaming I'd have to say.

In no way do I see a vape company that doesn't provided edibles as being comparable to TRTC or Dixie E

Thank you though for the company DD on this sector though gents.


15 Feb 2016, 12:13 PM

Dixie and Terra aren't comparable. What makes you think they are? Dixie is mainly drinks and edibles, they
added vape cartridges, animal treats, etc. None of which TRTC is doing for now.


You asked for companies, I gave you some examples, Alan did, and believe me, the list is very long, so take
your pick. Yet you say you have trouble finding even one.


If you want an edible company, look at Bhang. I just gave openvape as an example of aggressive growth (and
because Dixie has vape cartridges as well).


15 Feb 2016, 12:26 PM

I say that they are because of Terra Tech corp recently merging with Blum Okland.

My argument is that TRTC and Dixie E (despite their business model differences are due to collide once full
legalization occurs).


This is just my opinion of course but I've yet to find any other company expanding with edibles against TRTC

Blum is a dispensary, the lab was already trtc's , thats where IVXX is extracted.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2256753-terra-tech-a-natural-born-capital-killer 151/163


So now we know why you thought dixie and terra were comparable.


Glad we cleared that up.


Let me stress that terra has a lot of options with their lab in cali and their two production licenses in nevada.
Currently the lab is only producing IVXX ( and can't keep up with demand) , but the lab can also be used to
make oils for vape cartridges and edibles.


I'm expecting them to broaden their product line or maybe even come up with a new brand or a licensing
agreement to produce for another upcoming brand. But since they can't keep up with the high IVXX demand,
i'm guessing it won't be anytime soon. Hope i'm wrong on that guesstimate.


15 Feb 2016, 03:04 PM


AFKScene
Thank you for clearing that up.


I still need to go back to the drawing board on this one though because as it stands TRTC won't be able to
provide enough output to take care of IVXX (as you stated) much less to manufacture their own edibles.


I've seen the pictures for their lab, they really do need to expand, get another CO2 extractor and at least
another lab hood (one is seriously not enough).


Just my 2 cents.


15 Feb 2016, 11:50 PM

The extractor isn't running at full capacity yet IMO.


16 Feb 2016, 04:15 AM


AFKScene
Yeah I've heard that it will be maxed out by May (don't quote me on that though). The good news is they have
two extraction labs (which I was not aware of until now).


Good news, in the sense that they're showing expansion.


It's safe to say (I think) that TRTC is a company that continues to plan on expanding aggressively (which is
what we want).


I rather be where the action is over where people "think" it will be as I've been there before (ETSY, Silver &
Gold, ect.).


This company is going to be impressive by end of year (IMHO).

2 more coming in nevada. They are planned in the cultivation buildings, on which construction hasn't started

Thebioengi is partially correct. Peterson already is leasing space with an established cultivator in Las Vegas
and according to his prior speech late last year already and have an extractor there for lauching IVXX in the
63 dispensaries there (so far still only 14 are open currently). He stated this is the lease space, he {I assume
Martin Kaufman, since he is considered a Cannabis grow genius in California} Where do you think this IVXX
products in Nevada is originating from? Federal law states you cannot move Cannabis products intra-state,
you have to duplicate every machinery in every state. products from California to Nevada is a no no.


You need an extractor to extract the components out of Cannabis, IVXX is in Nevada, the 2nd extractor is
there [again, not the laboratory since he is leasing another cultivator's space, part of it according to Peterson],
to grow his Cannabis to Kaufmann's specifications and to extract the IVXX's products


Why would he announce he has a 2nd extractor? That is not really big news Belgium, especially since he
already mentioned he will purchase a 2nd extractor to get IVXX operational in Nevada last year. Did he
mentioned the first one exclusively ? No, he mentioned that they had an extraction laboratory and were
making products from it. he does not have his own laboratory in Nevada yet. He also does not mention how
many dispensaries sells IVXX anymore in California because he gets too many per week.


I listen to all of his speeches and analyse them, and I know that was what he stated as part of his plan. he
stated last year he will wait until the last possible moment to purchase one because technology could change
and he can get a more advance model if he waits until he needs one.


18 Feb 2016, 03:29 AM

they are not operating an extraction lab in nevada at this moment.


There aren't any IVXX concentrates in nevada yet.

"Peterson already is leasing space with an established cultivator in Las Vegas and according to his prior

False statement. This is straight from the 8K filing:


"Derek Peterson , President and CEO of Terra Tech Corp.: So, one of the things that we're doing right now
and I've spoken about this on some past calls, while we're waiting for our cultivation facilities to be finished,
we are working with existing cultivators and we're actually looking at operating within some other people's
permitted space where we can actually cultivate in their facilities under our own standards while we're waiting
for our production facilities to step up and that was one of our reasons for saying that we're going to be able
to get the IVXX brand off the ground in 2016 for wholesale distribution because although we're waiting for our
own facilities there is the opportunity to make sure -- to use the footprint that other people have to make sure

that we get the product out there as early as possible, so that's a couple of things that we're negotiating right
now is not only you know wholesale flower contracts that we can produce from, but at the same time making
sure that we can use our own people and operate under our own standards in somebody's else's footprint
from a lease standpoint. So we're working on all three strategies right now. "


I'll stress "we're actually looking" "we're negotiating" "we're working on"


Forward looking statements.


"the 2nd extractor is there [again, not the laboratory since he is leasing another cultivator's space, part of it
according to Peterson], to grow his Cannabis to Kaufmann's specifications and to extract the IVXX's products"


No it's not, there is no 2nd extractor yet.


"Why would he announce he has a 2nd extractor?"


They are a public company, all material events have to be reported to the public.


"Did he mentioned the first one exclusively ? "


Yes, they even mentioned the order placement already in march 2014: 
http://bit.ly/1oM9EqN


That's order placement, delivery was later.


"I listen to all of his speeches and analyse them"


There are a lot of forward looking statements in them, things they plan or are looking at at a certain moment.
Not all of those plans come to fruition for a lot of reasons (better opportunities, change of direction, priorities
changed, etc etc.)


I will say this again: it's not because someone on a message board repeats something he believes is true a
1000 times, that it actually becomes truth.


Forward looking statements didn't happen yet, I'm not saying that they won't, not at all, I'm saying it like it is.

This was not a forward looking statement Belgium, late last year, Peterson had an open forum with the
shareholders and he mentioned this as fact that he will purchase an extraction machine in Las Vegas, lease
space with a cultivator and produce IXVV in that state. It was after the last 10-Q after November when he
attend some small cap conference. This is a fact.


About material facts being public record [of a new extraction machine], Peterson will release that news within
the SEC guideline [this is named Quiet Period], he is not obligated to release it as it happens, if he has the
Western Avenue completed [pending State inspection], the Desert Inn and Decatur and Virginia Avenue
[incidentally, he did not disclosed that he brought the Reno building until it was announced in the 10-Q,
however, I discovered that months before in the Reno Gazette], then I believe he already have the leased
space and the extractor in that space ready to go. He stated that IVXX will available in Nevada during the
beginning of the year via the last 10-Q and the shareholder forum he had late last year [which is not a forward
looking statement].


18 Feb 2016, 05:35 PM


James.Bond
"I agree, but first they need the second lab before the second extractor. ;)"


Not in Nevada, unless he plans to use space at his dispensary for a laboratory like he has in Blum: Oakland,
else it will be at the leased space from the existing Cultivator until his own is up and running. he just needs a
room for the extractor, not any kind of a fancy laboratory like he has in California at this time, he just needs to
push the product out

You are not allowed to produce where you dispense according to nevada regs. There were applications
denied for that.


And he does need more then an extractor , all the 'fancy' lab tools as you call them have their specific
Role/function in the production processes of the different variations of concentrates. Or did you think it just
comes out of the extractor as a finished product? Better do some homework.

IMHO, You will see IVXX on the shelves on the opening day of the nevada dispensary, because they will
source product from others, make sure the quality is on par with what they are looking for and wrap it in the
IVXX packaging. Maybe not concentrates just yet, but flowers highly likely. My 2 cents.

It was not the smallcap voice transcript which follows his 10-Q conference calls, this was when he attended
some small company [not Cannabis exclusively just small companies] investor meeting in California and after
that meeting, he would chat with investors in a chat room. It was when somebody asked him, he replied with
the answer I had indicated. Technically it was not a PR or a statement that he had to have an 8-K since he
was in a chat room answering investor questions after a small cap meeting.

Hey belgium! Good to see ya around again, hope all is well.


Couple of questions for you. Do you think sourcing product from whomever the cultivator is that they are
setting up with will be good for the branding? Consistency, quality, familiar strains and all... Are they bringing
in their own growers as consultants? Who is the Nevada cultivator, haven't found that info...


18 Feb 2016, 10:36 PM


James.Bond
TRTC is NOT sourcing any products from any cultivator, they leased or sub-lease space with an current
cultivator and will produce their IVXX and other Cannabis products to Martin Kaufmann's specifications [he
works for Blum: Oakland + is a partner and is responsible for the strains and consistency of the Cannabis
there]. They are not buying any cannabis from any cultivator, Peterson had made this very clear in many
statements. He emphasised consistency in his products, buying other people's products when you do not
know the consistency is not what Peterson envisions

Just fyi guys there is an extractor at the 1921 but that location is only licensed as a dispensary. Obviously
extraction needs a production license (i.e. they would be able to do that in there just like the other facility that

Where does it say they have another extractor at 1921? That's just an old PR, nothing new for me.

You do realize everyone can setup a website and post whatever right? Doesn't make it so. That website has
nothing to do with the company.

But I agree, not the most credible website.

Great, so you admit that you pass fake info as truth... it's the same as reposting message board BS.

Vertically integrated is their grow equipment and IVXX?


I know we could draw some others but to say their equipment is their tech, is kinda like slapping stickers on any
vanilla white chinese electronic?


They need to ditch their grow equipment line unless they can make alot of money slapping on stickers?!

Vertically integrated as in covering every aspect from seed to sale. Dixie is only a producer, kinda like IVXX
(not the same product). Trtc covers cultivation and retail operations as well.

We had a couple of states vote to legalize marijuana.


FACT: The following day after those SUCCESSFUL elections, the pot stocks like TRTC still went way down in value.

(they went down the day after the election. There was no election bounce what-so-ever.)...........

I now also have a very small position but I'm afraid it's short at 39.5¢. I couldn't get any borrow at all at Etrade and
only a very small amount at Interactive Brokers. FYI, I really do mean congratulations to those of you long. Their is no

The pump building into 4/20 continues. The "Record Revenue's" press release (no mention of profits), the "Blum
purchase closing" press release (again no mention of profits and no new news), the "New Cartridge Product Line"
press release (no, oh never mind), the "Super Lettuce Rights" press release (with no mention of costs or terms,
probably a VWAP funded purchase), the Nevada store opening well timed, the small cap voice interview, OTC Expert
and Daily Stock Reporter (EGM Firm Inc), both paid pumpers, out with various "news" items. This is what TRTC
excels at, where their limited assets and efforts are being spent, super lettuce, paid "research", and "news" articles to
help build hype. I assume they are out on the boards pumping away also. They need to not only unload their own

shares but provide a situation for the convertibles to unload theirs or those convertibles won't keep playing. TRTC has
went from the teens a month ago to 59¢ today so its working.


All those smart investors figuring they are going to trade the momentum and news run-up to 4/20. Congratulations if
you are one of them. TRTC is delivering the "news" and momentum you asked for. However, I suggest you be careful
you don't get caught holding so long that you end up being the greater fool everyone else sells to. But if you do get
caught holding the bag, don't whine and blame TRTC/Derek, they are simply playing the same game you are.


Insider sales so far just this month (April 1st - April 12th, 2016):


Almsteler (Director, Secretary & Treasurer, Derek's wife) 578k shares 
Nahass (Director) 700K shares 
Vandevrede(s) (Director, COO) 677K shares


Disclosure - I am short TRTC

Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
Belgium pointed out that while Amy Almsteier reported selling 578K shares on a form 4, she actually turned in
a form 144 (proposed sale) of 878K shares, so there's potentially another 300k shares coming down the pike.
Good catch Belgium.

Surprised you didn't mention the reverse split that would potentially allow insiders to substantially boost their stake at
the expense of outside shareholders, given that the Preferred B won't be reverse split and the conversion ratios won't
change, apparently. Hopefully they fix this, as it's not consistent with the governance improvements the company has
made thus far.


19 Apr 2016, 08:46 AM


Darren McCammon, Marketplace Contributor
Thanks Alan,


I didn't know the Preferred conversion ratio was an issue (never heard of such a thing not being adjusted). I'm
going to assume the conversion ratio's on Preferred would be adjusted if the company did a reverse split.
Maybe I am naive but I would think if they did not, there would be lawsuits up the ying yang.


While I understand that from an investor emotion point of view a reverse split is generally a negative, and I
fully understand that this reverse split has more to do with creating room for more convertibles than up-listing,
it also doesn't actually change the underlying business any. I tend to invest more on weight and fundamental
valuation than momentum or technicals (hence I'm short, if I was more a technical guy I would have tried to
ride the wave going into 4/20 both up and down). Anyway, I tend to not place a whole lot of value in dividend
cuts or raises, splits and reverse splits, and other things that effect investor opinions but not the business

prospects themselves. Given that TRTC trades primarily on emotion, I admit that's probably a mistake.
Thanks for pointing out something I wasn't aware of (a potential Preferred conversion issue).

It didn't drop much because it was expected. You cant fit a fully diluted 463M o/s in a 350M a/s. And the r/s
has been mentioned by the company several times before.


The sneaky stuff was the series b are exempt from r/s, but we knew that already from the merger filings. So
again, nothing new.


The stock is riding on momentum and technicals, not on fundamentals.

Hi Alan , 
you are talking of fixing - that suggests it`s not beeing installed in full intention. I think we can be sure it is. Do
you know about the legal consistence?  
I mean that it`s not consistent with the governance improvements is for sure. I mean it simply doesn`t make
any sence.  
So my only conclusion is all the governance improvements are shabby tries to screw shareholders making
them believe there are improvements to attract institutionals. I contacted them weeks ago on ir but there
hasn't been any answer at all.

Not a lawyer, but I see a lot of companies out there take actions similar to this that don't seem fair to
shareholders.

"not fair" ----that`s slightly unterstated depending on the resplit ratio and the number of replits they can easily
ruin all common shareholders to their enrichment. I mean if that`s their decission they are able to make one`s
investment worthless from one second to the other. But actually I´m a little astonished you say you`re not a

I guess you have read something into my comment that's not there. I have been pretty disappointed about
this and have discussed at length loudly and frequently with my subscribers. I don't in any way endorse it or
defend it, I am simply pointing out that this kind of crap is all too frequent.


You asked a question about legality. I am NOT A LAWYER. I feel the need to qualify, because I believe it is
legal, but I don't know. As I said, I see this frequently.

Thank you for your clarifying words - I didn`t want to imply anything. I just felt and feel quite uncomfortable
with "not fair". If it`s legal, and I can`t imagine it`s not, it stays a malicious theft and is worthy to be
condemned to the core.

TRTC is up about 25% the last couple days. News includes that: they signed Katie Burnett, a womens golfer to
promote their vitamin line, they will be presenting at a cannabis tradeshow in Oakland, and they put out a press
release on Blum store sales today: http://tinyurl.com/hs3...


Not really sure which of these is driving the stock as none seem significant or meaningful to me. Katie Burnett
appears to be an up and coming womens top 20 golf pro. Everyone would expect them to have a booth in a
tradeshow held in what is essentially their home town. The Blum store release is pretty meaningless as in it they
neglect to disclose same store sales. Rather they focus on specific product lines which are showing increases. It's like
Macy's putting out a PR saying womens shoes were up 40% at their main store. Nice to know but not terribly
meaningful without overall store sales data.

The good: 
Revenue up 93% compared to last year 
Gross Margin increased from 5% to 17% (this is a big deal) 
Plenty of great growth stories (more store fronts; more products: IVXX, super lettuce, vitamin line; states going
recreational, etc. Lots to get excited about.)


The bad: 
Expenses almost doubled (from $3.1M to $6M; = SG&A +/- other income and expense) 
Earnings 75% worse (from -2.8M to -4.9M; the more they sell, the more they lose)


The ugly: 
62% dilution in one year (216M shares vs. 350M shares)


Disclosure - short TRTC
