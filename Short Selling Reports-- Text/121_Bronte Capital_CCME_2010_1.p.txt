China Media Express: A Wall Street drama
Sorry I have not been blogging for a while.  There are a few reasons.  Firstly I have been
travelling to raise money for my funds management business (now in NYC).  Also I have
been working on shorts - and whenever I talk shorts I get hate mail and sometimes threats
of litigation.  My experience is that the bigger the slime-bag the faster they are to call
lawyers... but being on the receiving end of threats from sleazy lawyers makes blogging
less fun.
 
Further - writing about shorts is surprisingly unprofitable.  My experience is that shorts
that are widely discussed become riskier (they get crowded) and sometimes go up -
whatever - they stop falling in response to bad news.  Universal Travel Group for instance
is now trading above when I first blogged about it and the only substantial news has been
that their fourth auditor resigned and their fifth auditor accepted the appointment.  They
also got a new shareholder - an elderly retired car dealer from California’s Central Valley -
who I suppose is also an expert on dot-com travel companies in China.
 
And so that brings me to the subject of short squeezes and one stock - China Media
Express Holdings (CCME).  This is not a stock in which we have a meaningful position but
which for a small-cap company seems to get more-than-its-share of attention.  When I
wrote the Universal Travel post I got more than ten inquiries about this stock - another
China stock listed in New York.  Why this one?  Well it is sort of attractive - indeed
outrageously attractive - and unlike all the other US listed China stocks it has a reputable
auditor (Deloittes) and a major shareholder with some credibility (Starr International of
AIG/Hank Greenberg fame).   
 
CCME has a simple business model.  It places TV screens on buses in China and bombard
captive passengers with adverts.  There are a lot of buses in China because China has the
largest internal migration in the world.  Chinese consumers are bombarded with adverts but
the really captive bus passengers are a good market. 
 
The company is - at least according to its accounts - frightfully profitable.  In the last
quarter the company had $57 million in revenue and only $13 million cost of goods sold.
 Selling and administrative expenses were less than $3 million. Head office is obviously
tiny.  After tax it is making $31 million per quarter.  This is the fattest margin and fastest
growth media company I have ever seen.  It is pretty darn attractive.  And plenty of my
smart readers own it despite rumors that it is fraudulent.  One of my smartest
correspondents was long. 
 
And a very few of my readers argued to me that it must be a fraud and were short.  Some
of them were short six or more percentage points of the funds they manage.  And all
wanted my opinion. 
 
Whatever - this was a dangerous stock.  Any stock that normal non-stock-market people
have never heard of but which garners this much passion is dangerous.  And at the time it
was trading at a low single-digit price earnings ratio - it was either a flat fraud or the stock
was going to trade up a very long way.  Indeed it was possible that it was both a fraud and

going to trade up a very long way.  I had - as I stated - no opinion.   
 
But at least a dozen people asked me for one.  So I had a look and was left with the
ambivalence which says “don’t touch this stock - long or short”.  There were only two
negatives that stood out.  One was that the company once used a stock promoter that has
previously been associated with some frauds.  They don’t use them any more.  The second
was that the CFO was under 30 years of age, operated from a serviced office in Hong Kong
and his only qualifications were a degree from a distinctly second tier Australian
university.  [See correction below.  This description does not apply to the CFO but does
apply to one external director.  The facts of the serviced office are however correct - the
company's registered office is that serviced office in Hong Kong.] 
 
Against this there were real positives.  Many Chinese companies listed in the US have
auditors even relatively sophisticated investors have never heard of.  These guys used
Deloittes.  And the major shareholder (Starr) supposedly did several weeks due diligence
before they invested.  And who am I to question that?  Again I decided to leave it alone. 
 
But the stock went up - and up - and up.  In the last three months the stock has traded
between $7.58 and $22.30.  When I looked it was about $8.   
 
If you were six percent short at $8 - which some were - it was diabolical.  At $20 you were
down 9 percent of your fund.  Moreover your position had increased by 2.5 times and your
fund had reduced - so now the position would be over 16 percent of your fund.  At that
point the position is threatening the existence of your funds management business.  After
all it is now possible to lose 20 plus percent of your fund on a single obscure short.   This
is a major drama for someone...
 
The big short has to cover.  At the same time the stock is attracting momentum (mo-mo)
investors.  To add fuel to the fire the company throws out yet another series of perfect
looking financial results.  This is deeply ugly and you are forced to buy the stock back to
save your business.  If you don’t eventually your prime broker will buy it back for you -
because they will protect their own.  That buying fuels the upward rise - putting more
pressure on shorts and attracting more mo-mo investors.   
 
If you are a small holder you should - of course - sell some stock into short squeezes.  After
all the buying is often artificial (forced covering, mo-mo guys) and when the squeeze ends
the buying pressure ends.  The mo-mo investors often become sellers.  We have a guideline
at Bronte that we will short 10-15bps of the fund into short squeezes where possible.  You
shouldn’t do any more than that because you run the risk of becoming a victim of the
squeeze yourself.  And it may not be possible because a borrow is not always possible.  (In
the case of CCME borrow is possible but the stock rents for a double-digit percent per
year.)  So we are short a little CCME - but way less than half a percent of the fund - and we
are hardly committed.  For those that are interested - we are losing money. 
 
Some of my readers however can talk about little else.  It is either the best or the worst
stock in their portfolio.  Short squeezes are one of many dramas of Wall Street.  This one -
repeated in a few other Chinese stocks like China New Borun - is particularly dramatic for
those that are involved - and totally irrelevant for everyone else. 
 
Thinking aloud about CCME’s business 
 
Outdoor advertising is much bigger business in Europe than in America.  Europeans watch
much less TV than Americans.  Americans drive home from work (and get bombarded by
radio).  Europeans take public transport.  And that is one of the best times to advertise to
them.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: China Media Express: A Wall Street drama


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/11/china-media-express-wall-street-drama.html 3/11


Jean-Claude Decaux was the pioneer of street furniture for advertising - and you can guess
how the negotiation went.  He goes to a local government (I remember when it was done in
Sydney) and tells them that they will install, maintain and clean bus stops and other street
furniture and they will pay the local government (or bus authority or whatever) millions of
dollars for the privilege.  The cash-strapped local government swoons at the sales pitch.
 And JCDecaux gets a few thousand more bus stops to display their adverts at.   
 
You can imagine this deal was amazingly profitable for Monsieur JCDecaux. It was a naive
cash-strapped local government versus sophisticated advertising executives.  And lets face
it - TV advertising requires huge numbers of people including some very highly paid
creative people.  Street furniture (even if you have to scrub off graffiti) looks like a
relatively cheap platform to display adverts on.  Of course it is fat margin. 
 
Fat margins do not last forever.  People - even people that run bus companies - don’t
remain stupid forever.  Every time a contract renews the bus company gets a little wiser
and the margin goes down.  The long dated contracts are all eventually renew - and they
renew at lower spreads for JCDecaux.  And looking at the expiry of the old fat margin
contracts you can guess what Mr JCDecaux did.  He listed his company.   
 
Ok - China Media Express is more profitable than JCDecaux ever was.  The little upstart
China Media Express is now as profitable in aggregate as the global leader.  At this rate of
growth they will be far more profitable than the global leader.  But what has me really
perplexed is that CCME is growing fast at increasing margins.  Last year gross profits for
the third quarter were 17 million on 26 million in revenue.  This year they are 44 million
on 57 million of revenue.  Margin is exploding... 
 
JC Decaux do street furniture in Chicago (as pictured in their 2002 annual report) - and
even in places like Chicago the bus companies and the local governments get smarter over
time.  In China they seem to get more stupid or more corrupt.  After all the Chicago local
authorities are doing better at extracting the margin from advertisers than Chinese bus
operators.  Unusual. 
 
But who am I to question this?  Delloites is the auditor and there is 170 million on the
balance sheet (representing past-profits) and that is a pretty easy thing for an auditor to
check.  So I am just going to conclude that the people who run Chinese bus companies are
stupid. 
 
Really stupid.  Or really corrupt.
 
 
 
 
 
 
John 
 
 
Post script:  For the avoidance of doubt the fund I know that was heavily short CCME was
covering the whole way up.  They are no longer heavily short CCME.  They did however
lose meaningful money.   
 
 
They would have been only a small part of the volume.  There are probably more than one
party caught in this squeeze.  Whether the squeeze is over?  Who knows.
 
 
Correction:  Several people have observed that the CFO is not sub 30 and not educated at an
Australian university.  I stand corrected.  There is a young director of CCME who is also the financial

my directors.  The registered office of the company however is a serviced office in Hong Kong - the
same serviced office as that young director operates out of.

Question is whether they can stay corrupt longer than you can stay solvent.

Hi John, 
Two points about the persistence of strong margins: 
1. Scale is very important in advertising, both on the supply and demand side. CCME has
it, the bus operators don't. None of the operators are large enough to possess significant
negotiating leverage unlike other out of home ad markets like public buildings, subway, or
airline. On the demand side CCME is the only company with significant scale in the inter
city bus segment and obviously that is very important to advertisers. 
2. CCME has aggressively gone into the airport shuttle bus market over the past year.
This segment has even higher margins than the inter city buses due to more upper class
passengers.

what you fail to take into consideration is price, which is a direct function of margin.
CCME cpms continue to remain far below the competition and well-well below avg cpms
in developed markets. ccme has the potential to continue to grow price, just announcing a
15% increase. the big multinational brands that are buying including the CCMEs Fortune
500 customers, aren't blinking an eye, they want the chinese consumer. what you also fail
to take into consideration is the level of contracts driving expansion into new regions and
airports, including governmental agreements with the ministry of transportation. what
these "stupid" bus operators are doing is literally installing new equipment with CCME
and new revenue and content programming into their often long bus ride experiences-
1hr+. i am happy to see such named shorts are so short-sighted, cause i am taking it very
easy here.

John, your article reads more like a warning to shorts than to longs --a refreshing change
of tone. 
 
One of the first things to be pointed out about CCME is that they have been thoroughly
vetted by not one but several sources:  
 
First, the original SPAC co. TMI, which was looking for a superior company with which to
merge.

Starr Int'l further engaged THREE outside investigators of CCME in different avenues
of research.  
 
CCME was more recently vetted by independent analyst firm Global Hunter --analyst
Ping Luo and the firm went on record on Oct. 15 to specially note that they had done
wide-ranging extra d.d. to obviate any possibility of fraud with CCME. GH and Luo are
putting their reputations on the line with their staunch defense of CCME against fraud
charges. 
 
We could add all the d.d. and vetting that has been done by at least 3 major investors
(Fernando / "Drexion2004" at InvestorsHub.com and his colleagues) who also attended
CCME's Investor Day --and who own between them about 7% of CCME's share-float.  
 
You mention the CFO's background... CCME's CFO Jacky Lam is a former auditor
with PWC (Price Waterhouse Coopers). He is very responsive to shareholders, unlike
many or even most CFO's you will ever try to contact. You can email him at jackylam (at)
mediaexpress.com.hk if you have further Qs. 
 
Now John, though you won't recommend going either long or short, I WILL, having
studied CCME for nearly a year and dialogued with major shareholders on CCME's pros
and cons. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND CCME as a major "BUY" investment here (and
i've backed up my recommendation with a lot of my own money).  
 
CCME's numbers are quite real-- you've got amazing and improving profit margins, an
EPS for 2011 that will likely be greater than all its major peers combined (FMCN, AMCN,
VISN), and ongoing growth with the expanding # of inter-city buses and much more
profitable airport shuttle buses. (Not to mention new and looming revenue streams with
tourist buses and likely also high-speed trains, "Skymall" type direct selling to
passengers, etc.) 
 
The co. is also overtly talking to shareholders and analysts about instituting a regular,
substantial quarterly dividend starting next year.  
 
Finally, it's no small matter that CCME's CEO Zheng Cheng is evidently a devout
Buddhist, and the co.'s mission statement (see www.ccme.tv/en/culture.aspx?id=1) is all
about hard work, integrity, virtue, service and deep empathy and loving-kindness for
fellow workers, clients, contractors and for the public who see the ads run on their set-up.
The Buddhist texts that Zheng reads for himself and to his employees speak very often
and very clearly about the LAW OF KARMA.  
 
So I'll trust him with my investment money far more than i will trust the CEOs of many
American and European companies who have no such understanding of "big picture"
karmic dynamics concerning right and wrong. 
 
One very last point: the reason that China's Ministry of Transport has given CCME a
virtual monopoly with the high-margin inter-city bus contracts and likely more and more
bargaining power with other segments of this overall new media advertising space (airport
buses, high speed trains, etc) is that they TRUST China Media Express to only allow
wholesome TV programming and advertising and not be culturally "subversive" with
unwholesome content. That's a primary factor in CCME's amazing and continuing
success story.

There was a comment which I accidentally deleted which noted that I was posting a
warning to short sellers. 
 
I was. The risk in short selling in any quantity is very high. 
 
Our short position is FAR less than half a percent of the fund. If the stock quadruples it
will cause us a bad day - but not in any way threaten us. There is no issue about us
staying solvent. 
 
But I was observing that this was a short squeeze par excellence. And they are exicting to
watch.

I short trivial amounts of short squeezes. This is a trivial short. I will do this without any
strong opinion on the stock. I express no strong opinions here. Someone is corrupt - but it
may well be the bus companies not the management on CCME. Do not know enough to
express an opinion. 
 
Understand it that way.

John, it's really very easy to figure out why the margins exploded this year for CCME.
Just look at their 2 new big business segment. Embedded ads and even more important
the new airport shuttle bus business segment.  
 
It's well known that the demographics for the airport buses are much better and therefore
the rates are much higher. Also the embedded ads have huge margins and the company
explained why.  
 
So it's not that CCME did grow their sales and their margins in their usual business only,
they have expanded their business into very profitable additional segments and therefore
grew their margins so fast.  
 
It makes perfectly sense. Ping Luo from Global Hunters was in China checking all the
bank statements like she acknowledged in her last report and everything was accurate.
I'm sure we can safely say she wouldn't lie about such thing openly.

John, there are a couple of inaccuracies in your article. The CFO is not under 30 years
old, he has multiple degrees and has 8 years at Price Waterhouse prior to CCME. Re the
'stock promoter', this never happened. If you are referring to otcjournal.com, they were
not compensated for their coverage and purchased their 1k long shares on the market
(see the web site's disclosure section). 
 
I fail to understand why you feel someone must be corrupt here. The only corruption I've
seen is from endless lies posted on the interweb re this company. Yet no one has ever
backed up these anonymous assertions with facts. As you stated - the business model is
simple and the company is fully vetted.

the worst short ever imo has been Volkswagen. at some point, it had the largest
marketcap in the world (past Exxon) 
in the end it netted us (equity options traders) a small amount, despite huge margins and
enormous losses once in a while.  
remember, one billionaire killed himself over it.


November 15, 2010 at 9:16 PM


John Hempton said...


Ah - Volkswagon/Porsche... 
 
That was a strange arb... 
 
The Volksagon borrow never became impossible and the Volkswagon short worked in the
end. 
 
IF you were 1 percent in the short - you probably lost money (forced covering). We might
have lost a little. 
 
If you were 5 percent in the short (as many were) you had a VERY BAD TIME. 
 
We short MANY stocks in SMALL QUANTITY. This is the reason.

I find it hard to compare CCME's accounts to any banks accounts. CCME has an
incredibly simple business model, income is essentially all cash, minimal debt, minimal
accounts receivable, very few physical assets... If there is something amiss and Deloitte
is not catching it I would be shocked. A bank on the other hand has an incredibly complex
balance sheet. 
 
I guess the conclusive evidence that CCME is indeed legit will be next March when their
annual 10-k is filed and Deloitte has announced that the cash flow we are seeing is in fact
real. I am on the side betting that Deloitte is not being tricked by the simplest business
model of all time and that CCME is just starting its ascent towards a fair valuation. 
 
 
Side note: it does appear that there is a lot of riff raff that has somehow come to market
via these reverse ipos. I find it rather amusing how often fraud! is screamed. On the other
hand how can one lump CCME in with these shadier companies. CCME has a legitimate
auditor (Deloitte), experienced CFO (Jacky Lam formerly of PWC, and a rather serious
amount of cash flow (I think this is one of the keys here that isn't thrown out there often
enough, the cash is the key). I think in the next year a variety of fraud will be uncovered in
the market but CCME will definitely not be one. 
 
Second Side Note: Any talk of margin compression seems absurd. Right now the cost per
minute charged by CCME is incredibly low compared to any other form of media. If the
bus operators do decide to increase their rate then CCME should have no problem
increasing cpm and maintaining, if not improving!, their current margins.

John, good to see you back at the blogging, after over a month without a post I was
starting to worry! 
 
An unrelated question for you: Ontario (Canada) has just announced that it intends to
regulate derivatives. Any tips for me to pass along to my MPP on how to make
regulations that are actually fair, easy to enforce, and actually effective at preventing
future systematic risk? (To my thinking, a central clearinghouse and transparency are just
the first step, a needed infrastructure for there to be any hope of enforcement of other
regulations).

Hello my fellow Canadian! 
Any tips for me to pass along to my MPP on how to make regulations that are actually

Here is a tip from Alberta.. 
We do not even have a national regulator. 
Canada has over a dozen and they speak 2 different languages French and English. 
Regulating derivatives is impossible as our present structure is flawed to the core.

Hi John, I was gathering information about CCME and the "net" brought me here. I am
interested in this company and i am looking for a long position entry point at 14$ or lower. 
 
You said you're short on the stock but your arguments didn't convice me. In sum you
wrote: 
 
1- The managment have little experience. (But they are delivering results) 
 
2- Fat margin don't last forever. (Sure, but you can check the margin quarter after quarter
and get out of the stock in time) 
 
3- There might be fraud (but you reminded us that the auditor is reputable) 
 
Are there more reason to short the stock?? I'm sure there got to be more reasons for you
to short CCME. 
 
I hope you'll forgive my poor english but i am only a young student from Europe.

Over the past few months, the topic of financial filings with China’s State Administration
for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has made frequent appearances within the U.S.-listed
Chinese RTO (“reverse takeover”) sector. I and other critics have advocated that AIC
filings are important data points in determining whether certain Chinese RTOs are
falsifying their SEC financial statements. In cases where AIC-reported revenue, profit and
assets are substantially lower than SEC-reported financial figures, we’ve claimed that this
provides material evidence that the companies in question are fabricating their SEC

financials. 
 
Our arguments have made sense to many investors, but some remain unconvinced.
Misleading responses by certain of the alleged frauds that AIC filings don’t matter have
muddled the debate. These companies, such as CMFO, LIWA or CSKI, have claimed that
AIC filings are unimportant and are not taken seriously in China, and that investors should
not use these filings as data points when analyzing U.S.-listed RTOs. I strongly disagree. 
 
The point of this article is that AIC filings do matter.

CCME has a network of 34,000 displays and revenue of US$96 million. This implies a
revenue of US$2,800 per screen per year. 
 
VISN has a network of 66,000 displays and revenue of US$106 million. This implies a
revenue of US$1,600 per screen per year. 
 
FMCN's has a network of 131,000 displays and revenue of US$229 million (LCD display
network only). This implies a revenue of US$1,750 per screen per year.

1) The official pricing for 15 seconds on 1000 buses per 15 sec is currently at about 200K
RMB at a coastal province. 
 
2) CFO quoted utilization rate at 90% in March. VISN and FMCN are far lower. You may
wonder if 90% is too high, but the fact that they are migrating to direct sales means that
they don't care about the ad agency that much, which they probably won't do if the
utilization rate is low. 
 
3) The company pricing, as far as I could see, is at par with VisionChina. The company's
claim of lower CPM than Vision and Focus is probably due to means of measure.

Explain this to me: How does Deloitte get fooled by the cash accounts at CME? And why
does a company that's supposedly trying to fool their auditors hire - at great expense - a
top-notch auditor that will scrutinize the books 10 times more closely than some low-brow
auditor that would cost them less money. A giant auditor like Deloitte sends a team into a
company's offices and scrutinizes every aspect of the firm's business. They will verify
customers, revenues, expenses, cash balance, taxes owed, taxes paid, operating
agreements, you name it. And they charge a lot of money to do that, they are the best at
what they do and it takes a lot of time and expertise to perform an audit on that level. And
if the company is unusually profitable or performing better than other companies in the
sector, then a world-class auditor asks questions and finds out why. Basically, hiring
Deloitte is the most expensive and most intrusive choice a company can make. 
 
CCME is therefore legitimate.

SAIC - here is the reality, minus the spin: 
 
http://www.nyggroup.com/library/NYGG-SAIC.pdf 
 
SAIC is a moot point anyway, this year CCME will submit matching audited numbers to
PRC-SAIC and US-SEC (to the extent possible within respective accounting
requirements). 
 
Hint: the SAIC numbers will be adjusted to match the SEC numbers, not the other way
around. 
 
No one in China has accused CCME of tax evasion. SAIC was not an issue until it was
raised by the investment community, and the company is rectifying the situation shortly -
the new SAIC is filed in March/April.
