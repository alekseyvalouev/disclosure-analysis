Heightened Risks Could See Baidu At $70
Dec. 13, 2012 7:06 AM ET37 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Over the past few years, I have been a consistent bull on Baidu.com (NASDAQ:BIDU),
which has served me quite well on a number of occasions. However, as a number of new
risks have emerged at the worst possible time, I am now turning very bearish on the share
price going forward. Over the medium term (6 months to 1 year), I am moderately bearish,
but in the near term, I am significantly more bearish and see the share price potentially
breaking through the $70.00 level.


As for the positives, Baidu continues to occupy a dominant place in the Chinese internet
space, and at any price below $100, it appears to be exceedingly cheap for a number of
good reasons. The company has a formidable ROI of over 40% and net margins which
are still roughly 50%. The only criticisms that analysts can find with Baidu are that revenue
is not growing at the scotching clip that it had in the past as well as the potential for further
slowdowns as Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) continues to make progress in the market for
online search at a surprisingly rapid pace.


However, there are several macro and micro risks to the share price which could send the
share price sharply lower, and at a minimum these concerns will almost certainly put a cap
on the share price at current levels. In the vast majority of articles, authors speak
extensively about all of the strong fundamentals that can be found in Baidu, and I agree
with their sentiments in this area entirely. The problem is that in overly focusing on the
easy to analyze (and positive) quantitative elements, these authors make little to no
mention of the harder to analyze (and negative) qualitative risks that clearly dominate
the equation in a massive way. In short, they are completely ignoring the factors that are
by far the most important in determining where Baidu will trade in the near future. Recent
examples include:


"The Best Stock for 2013"


"Is It Time for You to Buy Baidu? (Hint: Yes.)"


The key concerns with Baidu are as follows:


Concerns over SEC / audit risk
Concerns over the VIE structure
Concerns over an expected acquisition

Concerns over growing Qihoo threat
Concerns over significant tax-loss selling in December


Each of these concerns would not be nearly as significant if they occurred in isolation. The
problem for Baidu is that all of these problems are coming to a head at the same time.
And with the stock now brushing on multi-year lows, the temptation to harvest significant
tax losses to offset taxable gains on better performing stocks will be very strong during the
next 2 weeks.


The SEC and VIE issues obviously apply very broadly to many Chinese stocks. However,
the last 3 issues are very specific to Baidu. Given the rise in Baidu's share price over the
past few days, it appears that many investors are demonstrating very short memories with
regards to concerns in the past and are likely being distracted by micro news which could
easily be overshadowed. Each of these concerns is discussed below.


Concerns over SEC / audit risk


The SEC and VIE risks are equally applicable to all of the Chinese internet stocks,
including Sina (NASDAQ:SINA), Yoku.com (NYSE:YOKU), RenRen (NYSE:RENN) and
Qihoo 360 . Selected other non-internet stocks can also be included in this group such as
New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU). With the SEC issue and the VIE issue, investors
are again showing how quickly they forget about significant problems as soon as some
small, positive piece of new information arrives. In both cases, the SEC and VIE issues
have not dissipated in any way.


News of the SEC's interest in inspecting the audit files of the China-based arms of
auditors hit during the week of November 26th and there was minimal reaction. But then
the SEC released its administrative order against Ernst & Young, KPMG, Deloitte, PWC
and BDO on December 3rd. This group of "Big 4" plus one audit the majority of Chinese
stocks that trade in the US. Baidu had already traded as low as $91 in the previous week,
which many viewed as a compelling buy opportunity. The stock rose as high as $99, but
when the SEC's order came out, Baidu quickly dropped to a multi-year low of $85.96.


Some investors have come to the conclusion that if Baidu does not have any accounting
problems itself, then there should be little risk of a closer eventual look by the SEC into the
audit papers of its auditor E&Y. This is not the case.


As most China focused investors have become aware, there is a significant contagion
problem when investing in Chinese stocks. In 2011, a large number of smaller cap
Chinese stocks failed their audits and were delisted. This fact alone took down many other

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1061931-heightened-risks-could-see-baidu-at-70 3/16


stocks which had no audit issues of their own.


More recently, in July when New Oriental announced that the SEC was inquiring into
details of its VIE structure, all other VIE stocks took an immediate and substantial dive. At
the time, BIDU had been trading at around $110 before suddenly dipping below $100 for
the first time in years.


The point is that even if Baidu has no accounting issues of its own, if a closer look by the
SEC reveals any problems at any other US listed Chinese internet company, then we can
be sure that Baidu's share price will be significantly affected.


Of equal concern is the fact that the stalemate between auditors and the SEC is in no way
resolved and looks like it will escalate into a significant confrontation.


In response to the SEC administrative order, PWC issued the following statement:


Today's action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is the result of
conflicting laws between the U.S. and China. The fact that the action is being taken
collectively against all of the four largest audit firms and one other firm demonstrates
that this is a profession-wide issue, not unique to one firm. For its part, PwC China
has cooperated with the SEC at every opportunity.


However, PwC China will, and must, comply with its legal obligations under China
law. This action involves an issue that needs to be resolved between the US and
China regulators as it impacts all audit firms in China serving clients who are
registered with the SEC. PwC China hopes for continuing dialogue between those
two parties to resolve the matter.


That statement was included in an article entitled "Chinese ADRs, Accounting Fraud, and
Delisting Risk," which is well worth reading for anyone who invests in the China space.


So clearly resolution of this issue is going nowhere fast. However, in the US capital
markets, the auditors are not on equal footing with the SEC. The SEC makes the rules
and the auditors are supposed to play by them. The clear risk here is that the SEC may
choose to implement a temporary solution to the problem as it waits for cooperation from
the Chinese government which may never come. Investors will have no idea what this
temporary solution may be or when it will come until the SEC announces it, and the effect
will once again be significantly detrimental to Baidu and other US listed Chinese stocks.


Concerns over the VIE structure

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1061931-heightened-risks-could-see-baidu-at-70 4/16


The problems associated with VIE structures have been discussed off and on for a few
years, but received the most attention back in July when New Oriental revealed that the
SEC was looking into the details of its VIE structure. It continues to surprise me how many
investors, including large institutional fund managers, have no idea what the implications
are when owning a VIE stock.


VIE stands for "variable interest entity" and it means that the shareholders of the company
have no claim on the underlying assets of the company, which is entirely contrary to the
very concept of owning stock in the first place. The reason for this odd structure is that
certain industries in China (such as internet and education) are considered to be protected
and sensitive industries and foreigners are not allowed to own them. To work around this,
US bankers developed a structure whereby investors own shares in an offshore (usually
Cayman) company whose sole asset is a contract with the underlying company which
gives them a contractual right to the earnings of the company. The ability to enforce this
contract has not really been tested and remains unclear.


What this means for investors is that if anything goes wrong and the company spirals
downward in value, there is no real floor to the stock because no white the likes of Warren
Buffett will come in and acquire the entire company to gain access to its assets. Buying
the whole company is useless because what you would really be buying is just the shares
in a Cayman Islands company whose sole asset is an unenforceable contract.


As investors woke up to this reality in July, Baidu fell below $100 for the first time in years.
Yet within a few months the stock rose to as high as $135. Investors simply forgot about
the fact that they owned nothing due to impressive earnings from Baidu in August. It is
quite literally the case that Baidu could discover oil beneath their headquarters in Beijing
and it would deliver no legal value to Baidu shareholders, so it is notably odd that better
than expected earnings would cause some investors to temporarily forget their previous
concerns over the VIE structure. That doesn't mean Baidu should be sitting at zero, it just
means that the valuation should be discounted accordingly. At a price of $135, there was
clearly no discounting taking place, nor is there at a price of $95.


Concerns over an expected acquisition


In August, Baidu raised $1.5 billion in a bond deal directed at US investors. Baidu already
has over $3 billion of cash on its books and that cash balance has been growing at a rate
of around $500 million per quarter. Clearly, Baidu doesn't need money for continuing

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1061931-heightened-risks-could-see-baidu-at-70 5/16


operations so most investors are expecting an acquisition. The most obvious target would
be a company which can help Baidu ward off the invasion by Qihoo into the internet
search space.


A good acquisition could help to allay investors' concerns over Baidu's slowing revenue
growth due to Qihoo. However, any acquisition that is perceived as being only marginally
beneficial or even over payment for a better acquisition could also hit the shares hard.


Baidu has the technical and financial resources to embark on a variety of business
improving projects, so the perception that Baidu must go out of house to rejuvenate its
business has raised concerns over management's ability to identify and implement
solutions on its own.


In addition, large internet companies have a less than impressive track record of
integrating their target companies as planned and overpayment for acquisitions is very
common.


This issue would clearly be less of a concern absent the other issues, but with Baidu
facing a number of headwinds from multiple directions, a less than optimal acquisition will
be very poorly received by investors.


Concerns over growing Qihoo threat


In April, I had voiced a number of concerns regarding Qihoo 360 and I felt that there was
even some risk that Qihoo might face problems in its upcoming audit by Deloitte. Three
weeks later, Qihoo passed its audit without issue and it was back to business as usual. In
June I sat down with Qihoo CEO Zhou Hong Yi in his office in Beijing for a 2 hour chat.
Our chat was extremely interesting, and contrary to his public persona as the "mad dog" of
the Chinese internet, he was exceedingly personable. We spent very little time discussing
past issues as Mr. Zhou was primarily focused on telling me about Qihoo's future. I had
been asking a number of questions about mobile applications, which is where I expected
him to tell me that Qihoo's future revenue growth was going to come from. Instead, all Mr.
Zhou wanted to talk about was Qihoo's future in search. At the time, I largely dismissed
his ambitions in this area due to my perception that Baidu's dominance was unassailable.
He did talk a very good game though and I left his office with the distinct impression that
Mr. Zhou was an individual who can clearly "talk the talk."


Just 8 week later, Mr. Zhou demonstrated that he can also "walk the walk" when Qihoo
announced that it had already captured 5-10% of the search market, which we all know
had to come at the direct expense of Baidu. Baidu's shares took an immediate tumble in

August, and then tumbled again in November when Qihoo announced even more
progress and search and a new initiative to launch a music service in competition with
Baidu.


A year ago Qihoo was notably overvalued. Now, the share price has risen slightly but
Qihoo has quickly grown into its valuation. Qihoo now has nearly $400 million in cash and
is profitable in a meaningful way. With a presence built into the computers of a few
hundred million Chinese internet users, Qihoo has a notable advantage over Baidu in
aggregating information from users as well as their preferences for a wide variety of
applications.


Baidu is still in the dominant position by a very wide margin when it comes to search. It is
not the level of threat from Qihoo that is concerning, but instead it is the very rapid rate
with which Qihoo is making progress that is concerning. In addition, Qihoo has already
demonstrated that it is willing to take the fight to Baidu in multiple arenas, including
search, mobile and music.


So far these inroads have been large relative to Qihoo's history, but small relative to
Baidu's dominance. I am currently expecting that Qihoo will hit a major tipping point in
tacking Baidu either in Q4 2012 or in Q1 2013. As soon as Qihoo hits the 20% mark,
concern among Baidu shareholders will become far more noticeable.


China's internet space is certainly big enough for two large players and at the current
share prices both Baidu and Qihoo would be considered a strong buy. However, both of
these stocks share the same risk factors with respect to the SEC / audit issue and the VIE
issue. As a result, at a minimum, the share prices are likely to see their movements
capped in the near term. The problem for Baidu is that it is falling from a position of
strength while Qihoo is rising from (formerly) of no position at all.


Concerns over significant tax-loss selling in December


Once again, comparing Baidu to Qihoo is instructive. Qihoo is currently trading at around
$25.00, which is near its 52-week high of $28.16, reached just last week. Qihoo is up from
a 2012 low of $13.95 which means that anyone who bought Qihoo during the course of
2012 is likely up on their investment and has no tax motivation for selling.


By contrast, Baidu has a very ugly chart which is likely to incentivize substantial tax loss
selling in December. Baidu began the year at $125 and reached a high of over $150 in
April. Prior to November, the stock only briefly traded below $100 following the New
Oriental fallout. However, it has now been over 1 month since Baidu closed above $100

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1061931-heightened-risks-could-see-baidu-at-70 7/16


and it looks unlikely to be able to break this key barrier in the near future. As a result, and
unlike Qihoo, virtually 100% of investors who bought into Baidu before November are now
sitting on losses of as much as 30-40%. The only reason to not sell Baidu in December for
the tax benefit would be if Baidu was expected to soar in Q1 2013. Given the number of
other concerns and the magnitude of these concerns this is highly unlikely, so tax selling
makes the most sense for investors who are underwater on Baidu.


Conclusions


After seeing the stock trade north of $130 for much of its recent life, predicting a stock
price at or below $70 may seem aggressive. However, looking at the fate of Sina shows
that this is an entirely realistic scenario. For a long time, Sina was an internet darling in
China. Sina peaked out at $140 in 2011 before hitting a rough patch and quickly trading
down to around $70-80 per share. At that time Sina's twitter-like Weibo service was just
hitting a positive tipping point, as were the prospects for its profitability. Unlike Baidu, Sina
has struggled with profitability, although revenues continue to grow sharply each quarter.
Despite this, Sina continued downward to below $50 by the end of 2012 before
rebounding to a 2012 high of $80 again. Last week Sina looked set to now break below
the $40 range, and only a reported relaxing of government controls on Weibo has pushed
it up this week. Over the past few days Baidu has risen on the back of the rise in Sina
simply due to the fact that China internet stocks trade as a sector and not on the back of
any significant positive developments for Baidu. In fact, both Sina and Baidu share the
same big picture risks. However, it is simply the case that Sina has already fallen so much
further than Baidu that some bottom fishing may be perceived as understandable. In fact,
both stocks still face substantial downside risk as well a strong headwinds against
meaningful appreciation before year end.


Personally, I have developed a bit of a negative bias against Baidu following the work I did
while looking into Qihoo some months back. I was trying to find a comparison point to
evaluate Qihoo's advertising revenues on its web portal hao.360.cn. The most obvious
point of comparison would be Baidu's hao123.com which is nearly identical in all respects.
Despite a widespread rumor that Baidu's hao123 would account for over 20% of Baidu's
profit, Baidu consistently refused to break out this segment of its business and I saw no
reason to not simply disclose it. I made numerous attempts to speak with Baidu's CFO, all
of which were rebuffed for the simple reason that she was "too busy" to speak with a
shareholder who writes extensively on Chinese stocks and who has been consistently
positive on Baidu. I have had in person meetings with senior management at over 100
public Chinese companies, yet with Baidu by the end I found myself begging for just 10

minutes of time on the phone and I couldn't even get that. I was able to speak with Baidu's
investor relations department, but as is often the case with many companies, IR's answers
typically consisted of "I don't know" or "we don't disclose that," making for several very
unproductive conversations. Even over the past year when my views on most Chinese
stocks have been negative and short focused, I have still been able to get meetings with
senior management at every company in which I have had an interest, with the exception
of only Baidu. Also, ultimately I was able to go through various other means and sources
to find out that the 20% rumor was dead wrong and that hao123 contributes well under 5%
to Baidu's bottom line.


I found this experience with Baidu to be particularly troubling in comparison to my
experience with Qihoo. With Qihoo I had been a constant skeptic and critic for nearly a
year and I had often been short the stock and been vocal about my negative views. Yet I
was able to have more than 5 conversations with Qihoo's CFO Alex Xu who even gave
me his cell phone number and took my calls on the weekend. If he bore any grudge
against my negative views, it certainly was not evident from my discussion with him and I
felt I was treated the same as would be any long shareholder. One of my articles on Qihoo
received considerable attention before their audit, enough for them to issue a written
response. Yet a few weeks later I was able to sit down with Qihoo CEO Zhou Hong Yi in
his office in Beijing and spend 2 hours talking about Qihoo's future. For reference, Zhou
Hong Yi is the CEO of a $3 billion NYSE listed company and he is roughly a billionaire
himself, so I had not expected to get this much of his time, especially on short notice.


Initially, I had concluded that Baidu was simply guilty of some (perhaps semi-deserved)
arrogance due to their dominant position in the China internet space and the size of their
company, which was as the time over $40 billion in market cap.


That might very well be the case, however as I discussed my disappointment in Baidu with
a number of institutional investors in Beijing, I found that the response was quite
consistent regardless of who I spoke to. Investors describe Baidu as a "black box"
because the company achieves spectacular results without always breaking out the key
information which would better explain those results. This is something that always makes
me uncomfortable and I have gotten the impression that many other investors have not
been successful in having a dialogue with Baidu either. As with all investments, investors
have a choice with Baidu as to whether to hit "buy" or "sell" on any given day, and as we
can see from the stock price, more investors are hitting sell than buy, pushing the stock to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1061931-heightened-risks-could-see-baidu-at-70 9/16


multi year lows. Regardless of whether it is corporate arrogance or a resistance to
disclose information, Baidu is now no longer in a position to be practicing either given that
its share price has fallen precipitously and it is under attack by a competitor.


Based on all of these points, I am now short Baidu. The short thesis is pretty easy for
Baidu, even given its omnipresence in the Chinese internet world, its dominance in search
and its strong fundamentals. The short thesis is simply that there are many factors which
could send Baidu sharply lower, but basically none which could send it sharply higher. The
only risk in the near term is that the stock does nothing and stays flat or only declines by a
moderate 5-10%.


The SEC risk, the VIE concerns and the uncertainties over Baidu's ability to sustain its
wide lead in the space may or may not cause a more meaningful drop in the stock in the
next 2 weeks. But in any event, these concerns are almost certain to prevent a substantial
rise in the stock. Over the longer term, Baidu's much suspected acquisition will be very
important. If they get it right, it could help the stock to some extent. But if they get it even
slightly wrong or overpay for it, then the share price will certainly suffer.


The only real catalyst for Baidu to rise would obviously be some clarity out of the SEC
regarding its issues with audits and VIE structures. However given that this process
involves cooperation between the SEC, the auditors and the Chinese government, any
progress will undoubtedly take a minimum of a few months. By that time, we start entering
audit season for 20F filers, which comprises all of the Chinese internet names. Many
investors (myself included) simply refuse to hold any Chinese stocks during audit season.
This is simply due to the contagion problem which has shown that even if any given
company has no accounting issues itself, a problem in any other related company will
have a significant impact on the share prices of their entire peer group.


The point of this last observation is simply that Baidu shares have the risk of significant
downside in the near term, but no real catalyst for upside until the audit season ends in
May.

good points, though Baidu's CFO should not be wasting her time doing random interviews so I wouldn't let that sway
your opinion... I doubt you'd be upset if Google's CFO didn't have time for you. Plus, Q360 needs all the free press
they can get so not surprising they roll out the red carpet...

Is the SEC focusing on China-based companies exclusively? What about the audits done on the chinese susidiaries
of American and other forein companies? Is the SEC asking for audit documentation on these subsidiaries also?


Or is there some reason why chinese companies specifically are not trusted? Does the SEC have a logical thought
process for its decision or can the SEC make any arbitrary decision without any worry about oversight?

points you mention and I am sure gave it a much more objective and extensive review. Also, you continue the fallacy
of mentioning Qihoo 360 taking market share from Baidu without mentioning any recent or current study to back up
your claim. The SEC is trying to get out specific information regarding the accounting problems that plagued some
Chinese reverse merger companies. This did not involve Baidu or other legitimate Chinese Companies. It seems you
are working and writing a lot to spread fear.

was there anything new in your article?? NO!!!! 
You simply want to use your article for people to sell their BIDU stock in order for you to recuperate your loss. 
Just sell your (short) stock and take a loss buddy! 
If your are smart you would just buy (bullish) some BIDU and wait for a bit, that would help you earn back some of
your loss! That's my story and I am sticking to it !!!! :)))

All of the mentioned concerns are already clearly known at this point and have been discussed at length in many
"other" articles. And although the SEC threat of de-listing is a huge potential unknown, are not all of these concerns
already priced into the current stock price?

Thank you for your well researched conclusions. One point that needs to be addresses, though, is the recent news
that the SEC position affects Caterpillar, YUM, and Qualcomm. Once these companies have something to lose in the
event there is no speedy resolution of auditing law conflicts, there is considerable domestic political pressure on the
SEC and the US government to come to terms with Chinese law.

I don't buy the pump and dump accusations. I've reviewed most of his articles and most of the time he has
nailed the stock movement, and most of the time it has taken several days/weeks/months to get around to
complying with his thesis. You're saying over a million shares traded based on his article about Sinoclean.
Maybe that many people listen to him, I don't know... it's an unusually high volume for an SA article.


His short theses have worked out a lot less often than his longs, which is typical for SA short articles.

1 - Regarding the SEC, there will be resolution with the audit files issue. It'll probably happen selectively, as specific
Chinese firms negotiate with auditors to provide information that's to the SEC's liking. Baidu specifically is under little
risk of de-listing, and while yes, there would be a short-term impact to all Chinese firms if any new de-listing occurs, it
will be short-lived. Bottom line: no one wants de-listing to happen, and if such a thing gains real traction, there'll be
alot of Congressional pressure put on the SEC to turn the other cheek.


2 - Regarding your concerns about Baidu's lack of interest in your interview -- the fact they are this way with most
every outside investor, as you mention, indicates that it's an overall corporate policy, rather than anything shady.
Further, Qihoo's eagerness to talk with you points to their desire to gain publicity, which is understandable, given their
position.


3 - Regarding year-end tax-selling pressures -- most of this has already occurred at this point, i would suspect. I don't
think this is much of an issue now.


4 - Regarding the "VIE" issue -- this hasn't stopped U.S. investors up to now. Why would it suddenly be an issue now?


5 - Regarding your $70/share "target" -- where in the heck do you get THAT? For a giant like Baidu to see that share
price, multiple sh_t storms would have to hit the fan at once. Certainly, one should never say never with the markets
..... but, really, that price is pretty lame, especially when you don't back it up with anything material.


Kudo's, though, for a better-than-usual literate article, which we retail investors are not treated to enough.

"Bottom line: no one wants de-listing to happen, and if such a thing gains real traction, there'll be alot of
Congressional pressure put on the SEC to turn the other cheek."


Is there any evidence that Congress is even aware of this situation, let alone against SEC action? Note that
an exchange listing is nice, but being delisted isn't the end of the world. Deutsche Telekom trades on the pink
sheets, and it was Congress that made this necessary by passing Sarbannes-Oxley in 2002. Ultimately,
Chinese listings on US exchanges allow Chinese companies to raise money from American investors.
Imagine the political implications if a Congressman objected to an SEC enforcement action and his
constituents lost billions of dollars to some Chinese fraud. I don't think Congress will object. What's more
likely is another statutory clampdown a la Sarbannes-Oxley.

Really you are just a finance student ? Quite good comment. 
There are many interests pushing for a solution and I hope it will be found, but some political intervention is
required by both side.

Mr. Pearson - your concerns are valid, but given the apparent growth rate, if the SEC/VIE concerns don't become
reality this is a $130+ stock. To be short isn't reasonable from a risk/reward standpoint.


Frankly I never thought I'd own bidu. Everytime I looked at this stock in the past it was way too expensive for me. The
last time - last week - I was surprised to see how much it had sold off and how relatively cheap given its growth. My
guess this was largely due to tax reasons.


I didn't buy much stock, but was able to put on some options trades cheaply (mostly in March options) which limits my
risk to the premium paid. I'm willing to take that gamble due to the stocks upside potential. So far, so good.

Obviously tried to keep a lid on Baidu with a lot of re-hashed FUD and failed. Probably covered and went long in the
first 2 minutes. Please let us know if you are still short?

to the SEC/PCAOB. I fear any agreement reached will favor China.

Good article. Baidu's dominance was really just a result of no competition. They are often criticized for their excessive
amount of "Sponsor" links and false information, especially related to area of medical/pharmaceutical. I'm not a big
fan of Qihu buy any means but with stronger government regulation and Qihu, Sohu and Tencent's growing market
presence, Bidu's future is definitely cloudy.


Not sure where you come up with the $70 figure, but shorting Bidu always poses a big risk.


13 Dec 2012, 11:29 AM

Ultimately, the problem with companies like BIDU is that they are listed only abroad. They're not subject to home
country securities regulation, and the SEC isn't really able to reach into China to regulate them. Regulation-wise,
they're in a twilight zone. Deutsche Telekom is listed on the Frankfurt Exchange, meaning that pink sheet stock
investors know that, at minimum, German regulators are keeping them on the straight and narrow (quite apart from
the fact that it's THE German phone company, of course). If BIDU and brethren join the pink sheets, investors will
probably flee, due to the vaporization of any regulatory oversight.

Dont believe this guy, no way BIDU will get to $70. This number is pulled from the air. It is clearly because Pearson is
short and wanted to talk the market down. Evil brokers. He probably shorted this at $90. 
Take everything you read with a grain of salt. On Nov 9, Infitialis wrote about BNNY being overstuffed and ready to
drop to $20 but it is holding nicely at $35+ to $37.

BIDU is a large cap, not a penny stock. There's no way a single unaffiliated analyst can have this kind of
impact on BIDU. I'd say his motivation is to put it on record, if BIDU plunges, that he saw it coming before
anyone else did. He's putting his credibility before future employers on the line, which I think is pretty gutsy of
him, considering that BIDU remains a favorite on Wall Street.

I recall when Baidu was near 300. I bought into it this year but quickly sold that position when I saw it tank. I plan to
leave it alone. It WAS a big deal but why should anyone buy it at 70? It is one of the few dogs I picked this year.

That was before its 10 for 1 stock split. It's tripled since it was at $300.
