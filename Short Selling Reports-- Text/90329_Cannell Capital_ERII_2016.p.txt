ERII


Energy Recovery, Inc. has a history of losing money but a Schlumberger
announcement has led to a rally in the price of the stock.


A lawsuit from Energy Recovery's former Chief Sales Officer raises disturbing
claims about management's internal practices and external forecasts.


With the stock priced to perfection and a history of downward revenue revisions by
analysts, buyers should be wary of Energy Recovery, Inc.


Shares of Energy Recovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:ERII, "ERI" or the "Company") have traded
up approximately 340% since October 19, 2015 when it announced an agreement to
license its Vorteq system to Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB) on October 19, 2015.

The Company received a $75 million upfront licensing fee from SLB in Q4 2015 and
could receive two additional $25 million payments contingent upon the completion of two
milestones.


On the Q4 2015 conference call ERII CEO Joel Gay said that the Company is expecting
to ramp Vorteq "up to a steady state range of two times to four times our base
desalinization business or roughly $80 million to $200 million in annual royalty income
by 2022."


Using the midpoint of this guidance (which presumes the Company will successfully
meet its development milestones), ERII trades at an enterprise value to 2022 sales ratio
of 2.3x. For comparison, world class energy equipment manufacturers such as National
Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV) trade around half of this enterprise value to sales ratio on a
trailing basis. Using the Bloomberg consensus 2017 EBITDA estimate and assuming
ERII receives $50 million for the two milestone payments, the Company is trading at an
enterprise value to EBITDA multiple of 18.6x.


ERII's valuation is excessive even if Vorteq rolls out exactly as planned. But the
Company has a rich history of over-promising and under-delivering. Before accounting
for the SLB deal, ERII has lost money every year since 2010.


This chart illustrates the regularity with which forecast 2015 revenues have been
steadily tapped down by analysts up to the Vorteq announcement. Does history repeat
itself?

Our experience is that history does often repeat itself. A lawsuit filed in January 2016 by
ERII's former Chief Sales Officer, David Barnes suggests that such a repeat could be
expected here. The case is captioned David Barnes v. Energy Recovery Inc., Thomas
Rooney, and Joel Gay, United States District Court Northern District of California 3:16-
cv-00477-EMC and we obtained a copy from public court records.


Barnes' complaint states that he was compelled by certain ERII executives to provide
"false information to Board members and the public."


The lawsuit argues that "defendants [ERI] made false statements to induce Plaintiff
[Barnes] to leave his job at Honeywell, move from Texas to California and work for ERI."
Some of the numerous representations Barnes alleges ERI made include:


1) "That ERI was a 'qualified vendor' of Saudi Aramco, Sinopec, Pemex, and
ConocoPhillips (COP) with respect to ERI's IsoBoost and IsoGen products - meaning
ERI had passed all the technical and commercial requirements necessary to sell
products to these companies."


2) "That ERI had more than $100 million in its sales pipeline and that ERI would be
closing one order per month."


3) "That ERI's Vorteq product would be ready for commercialization within six months."


According to lawsuit however, "after starting his job at ERI, Barnes discovered that many
of the representations upon which he relied in agreeing to accept the job at ERI were
false." For example, Barnes notes:


1) "ERI was not a qualified vendor of ConocoPhillips, Pemex, Sinopec, or Saudi
Aramco."


2) "ERI did not have a '$100 million' sales pipeline for its products. In fact, the true value
of the pipeline was in the seven figures."


3) "The Vorteq product was far from commercialization."


The most troubling of Barnes' allegations is that certain ERII executives, including
current CEO Joel Gay, were on several occasions involved in the misrepresentation of
information to the investing public and to the Company's Board of Directors:

1) "In addition, shortly after starting work, Defendants Rooney and Gay instructed
Barnes to obtain an order for the IsoBoost product from ConocoPhillips because it was
essential that they tell the market that ERI was making progress in oil and gas at the
December 2014 analysts' meeting. At the time that Barnes received this instruction, ERI
was not a qualified vendor of ConocoPhillips, and ERI had not included installation costs
in its presentations to ConocoPhillips with respect to its return on investment on the
IsoBoost. That said, Barnes was able to obtain a purchase order for the IsoBoost
product. However, it was subject to cancellation. Indeed, Defendants knew that it was
unlikely ConocoPhillips would actually purchase or install the product given its issues,
including the cost of installation and the fact that ERI was not yet a qualified vendor…
Nevertheless, Rooney and Gay duly announced to the market in December that 'We're
also very proud to announce that ConocoPhillips has formally signed a contract to put
this exact device [the IsoBoost] up in Canada.' Rooney made this announcement even
though he was aware of the information that it was unlikely ConocoPhillips would
actually purchase the product… Unsurprisingly, ConocoPhillips canceled the IsoBoost
purchase order approximately two months later."


2) "Also in February 2015, there was a Board meeting scheduled. At this meeting,
Barnes intended to inform the Board of Directors of several significant obstacles to
making sales in the oil and gas sector. Among other things, ERI was not a qualified
vendor. Also, ERI did not fully understand how to execute on the project requirements
for installing the products. Gay instructed Barnes to not inform the Board of these facts.
Instead, Gay instructed Barnes to overstate ERI's likely sales performance to the Board
members. Barnes objected. Gay became so concerned that Barnes would be candid
with the Board about ERI's performance and the true state of the company, that he
required Barnes to meet with him and another employee to completely script his
remarks to the Board."

3) "Similarly, in April 2015, Barnes stated his intent to inform the Board of the true state
of ERI's sales pipeline. Gay insisted that Barnes inform the Board that ERI was on track
to earn fifteen million dollars in revenue in 2015 from its oil and gas products. Barnes
objected, and informed Gay that this revenue number was unrealistic. Gay nevertheless
created a script containing false and/or inaccurate information, and he required Barnes
to follow this script in his presentation to the Board. Barnes again objected, but fearful
for his job, he conveyed the false and/or misleading information to the Board misleading
information to the Board."


ERII replied to Barnes' complaint in a response filed with the court system. In this
response, ERII denies the allegations made by Barnes about misrepresentations made
by the Company's management. This response is attached to the article. We encourage
readers to consider both Barnes' complaint and ERII's response. Barnes' lawsuit
remains pending before the US District Court for the Northern District of California.


Before you buy the inflated shares of ERII while relying on management's promises,
consider the cautionary tale of David Barnes and previous promotional forecasts by
management.
