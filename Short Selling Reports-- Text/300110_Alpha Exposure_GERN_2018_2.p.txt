Imetelstat Might Be Brought Down By Hy's Law

Summary


We believe imetelstat may have a patient that meets Hy’s Law, a concept that the
FDA uses to judge liver toxicity.


We believe having a patient meet Hy’s Law significantly increases the risk of another
clinical hold for imetelstat.


Geron's acknowledgement of patient deaths, the FDA's recent information request
on safety, and a center's suspension in the imetelstat trial, in our opinion, are too
much to ignore.


We believe imetelstat's safety profile may be too dangerous for the FDA.


We are short Geron.


In our previous article, we highlighted the numerous safety issues that have plagued
imetelstat and made investors aware of the risks that Geron's (GERN) imetelstat may
face, specifically the danger that the FDA implements another clinical hold.

In this article, we are highlighting a risk that we perceive: imetelstat may have a patient
that meets Hy's Law, which is a concept that the FDA uses to judge liver toxicity for drugs.
If this is true, it only serves to heighten the risk of the FDA issuing another clinical hold on
imetelstat. If this were to happen, we believe it would severely hinder imetelstat's future
prospects.


What is Hy's Law?



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/15/959452-15187366260807676_origin.jpg
According to Wikipedia, Hy's Law is a "rule of thumb that a patient is at high risk of a fatal
drug-induced liver injury (DILI) if given a medication that causes hepatocellular injury (not
cholestatic injury) with jaundice."


Also described on Wikipedia, there are three components to Hy's Law:


1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally defined as an elevated alanine
aminotransaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) by 3-fold or greater
above the upper limit of normal. Often with aminotransferases much greater (5-10x)
the upper limit of normal.


2. Among subjects showing such aminotransferase elevations, they also have elevation
of their serum total bilirubin of greater than 2× the upper limit of normal, without
findings of cholestasis (defined as serum alkaline phosphatase activity less than 2×
the upper limit of normal).


3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased
aminotransferase and serum total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse,
ischemia, preexisting liver disease, or another drug capable of causing the observed
injury.


A patient must meet all three components to fall under Hy's Law. The FDA states in this
guidance document (page 5), "Finding one Hy's Law case in the clinical trial database is
worrisome; finding two is considered highly predictive that the drug has the potential to
cause severe DILI when given to a larger population."



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy

https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Guidances/UCM174090.pdf
We believe the FDA is especially sensitive to DILI because DILI is the "most frequent
single cause of safety-related drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years," (see
page 2, "BACKGROUND: DILI"). It's also a "major cause of drug failure in clinical trials,"
and "the leading cause of acute liver failure in the US." We believe it is clear that this is a
risk factor that the FDA does not take lightly.


Why we believe imetelstat may have at least one patient that meets
Hy's Law


In December 2017, Geron held an analyst event after the American Society of
Hematology (ASH) conference and published a presentation that included information
from the IMerge and IMbark trials that are being conducted by Janssen. On slide 47 of the
presentation, Geron released, what we thought was startling safety data from the IMerge
trial. We added the red underline to emphasize what we thought was most important.


We believe this slide indicates that imetelstat has at least one patient that meets two of
the three components of Hy's Law.


The first component states "the drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally defined as an
elevated ALT or AST by 3-fold or greater above the upper limit of normal." We can see
that in the second bullet point, GERN states that the IMerge trial had four patients with
grade 3 worsening of AST and/or ALT.


According to slide 107 in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program of the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (also known as Common Toxicity Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0: CTCAEv4), a grade 3 ALT/AST is characterized by levels
5x to 20x the upper limit of normal.


These four patients clearly meet the first component of Hy's Law, which is a 3-fold
increase in ALT or AST above the upper limit of normal.



https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Guidances/UCM174090.pdf

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827815002998

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/959452_15187327918612_rId14.png
The second bullet point in the Geron slide acknowledges that one of these four patients
with grade 3 AST/ALT also had grade 3 worsening of bilirubin. According to the CTCAEv4,
a grade 3 level of bilirubin is a 3x-10x level above the upper limit of normal. Again, this is
well above the 2 fold (or 2x) cutoff point for the second component of Hy's Law.


We also want to point out that Geron did not release the number of patients who had
grade 2 worsening of bilirubin. If these patients were in the upper end of the grade 2 range
of 1.5x-3.0x, they would still meet the second component of Hy's Law. As a result of the
information on slide 47, we have concluded that at least one of the IMerge patients
satisfied the first two components of Hy's Law.


Geron was quick to add that the adverse events for the four patients referenced in slide 47
were reversible. We acknowledge that this was a positive, but we believe this may just be
a silver lining in an overall gloomy situation. In our opinion, the main issue is the severe
toxicity of imetelstat. We also question how reversible these adverse events are since
GERN has indicated that the IMerge and IMbark trials have had patient deaths, which we
highlighted in our previous article.


As indicated above, the third component of Hy's Law is, "No other reason can be found to
explain the combination of increased aminotransferase and serum total bilirubin, such as
viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, ischemia, preexisting liver disease, or another drug capable
of causing the observed injury."


This is the component that's most subjective. We believe that viral hepatitis can be ruled
out because hepatitis is typically screened for at study entry. We also believe this is true
for bilirubin elevations caused by alcohol abuse, which typically occurs in patients with
alcoholic cirrhosis. We believe it is unlikely that Janssen would enroll cirrhotic patients in
their studies. As for other drugs, we believe that the patients in IMerge were likely on other



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4145052-geron-imetelstats-history-deaths-safety-issues

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/2/959452_15187327918612_rId16.png
drugs, but if these drugs are commonly prescribed by doctors, then the drugs likely won't
have issues with Hy's Law. Therefore, we can deduce that imetelstat, the new agent and a
known hepatotoxic drug, likely is behind the combination of elevated aminotransferase
and serum total bilirubin seen in the IMerge trial.


We believe imetelstat is at risk of receiving another clinical hold


If our analysis is correct, then imetelstat has at least one patient that meets Hy's Law,
which the FDA views as "worrisome." There may be additional Hy's Law cases if any of
the patients that experienced a grade 3 worsening of AST and/or ALT also had grade 2
levels of bilirubin. As previously described, slide 47 indicated that an elevation of bilirubin
greater than 2x the upper limit of normal is above the level that would trigger the second
component of Hy's Law. Furthermore, if our observations are correct, even more, patients
may be found to meet Hy's Law as the two imetelstat trials continue. We believe this
increases the risk of another clinical hold.


While Geron investors may not be as concerned about imetelstat's safety profile as we
are, we believe it's clear that the FDA is taking this seriously. As we pointed out in our
previous article, Geron has admitted that "safety issues, including deaths, have also been
observed by Janssen in IMbark and IMerge," and Geron acknowledged that the FDA has
sent Geron and Janssen an "information request" for "additional efficacy and safety data,
including deaths, justifying continued treatment of patients enrolled in IMbark." We believe
investors should not take this disclosure lightly.



https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/fda-places-geron-s-imetelstat-on-clinical-hold-due-to-hepatotoxicity-0001

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4145052-geron-imetelstats-history-deaths-safety-issues
We also know that one of the centers in the IMerge study (the Levine Cancer Institute in
North Caroline) has suspended its participation in the IMerge trial. While it may simply be
coincidental, we think it may have to do with imetelstat's safety profile.


We are short Geron with a price target of $0.47


Putting this altogether, we believe imetelstat's safety profile is too dangerous for the FDA
to ignore. We believe imetelstat has at least one patient that meets Hy's Law and that it is
possible that more may be found as the imetelstat trials conducted by Janssen continue.
We believe the risks of another clinical hold by the FDA are high.


We are short Geron with a price target of $0.47 per share.

This article is a disgraceful obfuscation of sparse clinical trial data. By citing the rate of withdrawal of drugs, the
author fails to consider that cancer medications are subject to different standards of acceptable liver tox than heart
medications that must be taken forever.

good technical work, but not very relevant clinically... it's only focused on telomere extension, not the pro-

And it's in HeLa cells, so it may not even be relevant to normal human cells.

In my opinion, the advance notice & timing of the press release suggests Geron will be having their Joint Steering
Committee meeting with Janssen in the day(s) just prior to the press release. The location of the meeting is most
likely at Janssen's facility in Raritan, NJ. Geron will publicly release the outcome of the meeting ASAP via the
Friday press release, and they'll get themselves home & ready to discuss the press release on Monday morning.

Hoosier Investor,


“In my opinion, the advance notice & timing of the press release suggests Geron will be having their Joint
Steering Committee meeting with Janssen in the day(s) just prior to the press release.”


That is an interesting observation. I wonder if you might elaborate. At this stage in the development of Imet
what might the Joint Steering Committee be considering, and what sort of advice or options might they be
giving with regard to the two ongoing clinical trials? I’m trying to understand the role of the Joint Steering
Committee at a time that appears crucial to GERN. Thanks. - Sargasso

Geron's announcement of the upcoming march 19th event states "to discuss the company’s fourth quarter
and annual results as well as recent events."


I assumed the "recent events" part would pertain to the IMbark Interim Data review that Dr. Scarlett has
stated would be complete by the end of Q1. The timing of this interim data review is shown as mid-March
in the January'18 Corporate Presentation that is prominent on Geron's home page (link below; slide 19).
http://bit.ly/2qKlK9A


However, as reported on one of the other GERN threads, the March 16th earnings release date may
simply be a function of the SEC's 75-day reporting requirement (link below). March 16th is in fact the 75th
day of 2018.

With regard to your Steering Committee question, the Nov'14 collaboration agreement calls for the
formation & periodic meeting of a joint (Janssen/Geron) steering committee. This steering committee
reviews available date, and sets the course for ongoing and/or future Imetelstat development efforts. After
review of the Q1 interim review data, the steering committee will decide if the current IMbark trial proceeds
as-is, proceeds with modifications, terminates, etc.

Wouldn't a steering committee usually meet right after the end of the quarter, especially in a case where

Option expiry is on 3/16 - interesting coincidence - mucho open call option interest @ $2 and $3 - a lot of
the trading between now and 3/16 will be targeting one of these numbers - if shorts are more nervous than
longs $3 otherwise - $2.


The two recent AE 'hit' job articles may have been written to protect the $3 Calls. A little good news
beforehand could go a 'Long' way but unlikely under the circumstances. Looks like a Mexican standoff until
3/16.


On 3/19, If shorts were able to keep pps at ~ $2 on 3/16 - downside risk for longs (if news is not overtly
positive) is perhaps a 50 to 60 cent slide with a probable bounce back once info is digested and negative
spin dealt with.


OTH, if good news, as many longs anticipate, shorts forcing the pps to $2 on 3/16 could be a Short Trap

It's really impossible to discern what is going to be said but the idea of a Friday press release and a Monday
conference is disconcerting, to say the least.


Recent events could well be more than an update on OS. Could we have reached median survival? Didn't Scarlett
say they will notify us? I mean, would they wait three weeks to tell us they've reached median survival, in a prior
time?


What possible reason could they have for waiting, unless the conference is ONLY about earning's and an update
on ImBark that talks about waiting for maturing data in the 3rd quarter?


I really don't like the idea of a Friday press release but it is what it is.

Couldn't it just be two different focuses ? Friday is the Earning call which is really not very interesting at all
since no real action.


Monday is probably focused on updating from the internal review one way or another but the fact that it is
an Analyst Conference inclines me to think there is something interestingly good. I mean, do you call
analysts together to announce that you are closing trials and going out of business ?

Geron's large short position is rational but not necessarily based on better information. Geron certainly conforms to
the profile biotech shorts find attractive (one product in clinical trials which has already been placed on hold by the
FDA etc. etc.). In fact, the current size of the short position is largely attributable to the FDA's Hold (millions of
shares were shorted at below 2 when the FDA placed Imetelstat on Hold).


We Geron shareholders who have held for many years are not happy about the pps but understand why it is
where it is. We've held because we believe the drug will ultimately be approved and that it will be very successful.


I'm sure most of us think the time frame to confirmation is in months, perhaps weeks, maybe even days, not years.
Shorts have yet to come to that conclusion and probably won't until it is irrefutable.


Unfortunately for Geron's shorts, if there is irrefutable evidence of Imetelstat's future success, it will probably come
after a steady climb in the pps similar to the recent pattern, i.e. a steady rise without news. AE is clearly a clever
short and has followed the stock closely enough to read the Tea Leaves. His two shamefully manipulative articles
may have served his purpose and provided him an opportunity to exit more gracefully than his short brethren.


None of us know how this will eventually play out - especially if the past is prologue. 
OTH, even if the only info shared via the Trial Review, due by the end of this quarter, is that medium survival has

not been reached and that those patients participating in the trial will continue to receive Imetelstat, the probability
of success will become extremely difficult to refute. If the news is favorable - shorts will start covering, institutions
will increase their holdings and the pps will respond accordingly. The rise may come in fits and starts or it may be
sudden and sustained, regardless I'm sure it will eventuate in a pps that will reward our patience. The odds I
believe have subtly turned significantly in our favor.

That all makes sense (sic: it's "median" survival). I would go farther and say that 99% of "the shorts" are
just HFT programs working off historical statistics. That's why there has never been a negative article
about GERN in the real financial media... or ANY articles since 2014.


To keep things in perspective, the total short interest is only ~70 million. So while it's true that high short
interest is statistically a bad sign, Geron's short interest is not large enough in an absolute sense to
indicate deep research... if there were one fund with a billion short, that might mean that they had actually
put an intern onto researching the position. Hundreds of short HFTs with a few hundred thousand short
each may well not be doing anything more than looking at GERN's price history.

Sangamo going from $3 to $27 in a year is what We all should hope for Geron also. I used to have bunch of
Sangamo stocks. I sold it out of frustration. Subsequently They kicked out their founder CEO and now they are
doing fine.


The reason Geron shareholders are so bothered by a clown sitting in his pajama in his Mom basement writing
these hit pieces is because that they have not had a sniff of winning for so long. Company always has an excuse
for failing, but excuses after a long while become old.


Lets hope that We see some of the Sangamo type of reversal here soon. Of course I am very long but always
worried about yet another excuse and another bad news. That is what you become accustomed to as Geron
shareholder. Lets hope We see a change soon.

All indications and data lately point to efficacy, safety, and an unmet need. That is, of course, why imetelstat has
been given Fast Track Status by the FDA. In my opinion, given the latest data, approval seems very likely. When I
buy a stock, in this sector, I am looking for undervaluation against its future likely value and potential. Geron has it
all going for it currently.IMO Those short or negative are not only wrong, IMO, but looking back in the rear view
mirror. If that were not enough, there is a big short position: 30 Million plus shares as of the latest release. Simply
a fact. If the longs currently have this right, imagine trying to cover all those shares on good news. I do not buy
stocks because of short positions, but I do not ignore the reality of them either. If I like this stock, the short position
is just an additional great fact, and will need to be covered at some point. Try buying 30 million shares here, even
now, and see what happens!! We shall see how it works out, but I would not part with a single share and will hold
till the story unfolds fully, regardless of any volatility. But I do think this is going up multiples of its current price over
the next couple of years, or maybe sooner! EOS IMO

In today's money, investors have put billions into GERN over the past three decades... not "$2".

All that needs to happen right now is a continuation of both trials and a continuation of the results we've
seen. We don't need anything new to happen, just a continuation of what was seen recently in both
ImBark and IMerge.

You just may get your wish if JNJ or Geron takes IMET frontline MF against jakafi as a control. Then we will see
the truth and nothing but the truth. I would expect IMET to work faster and with real curing results and be able to
back down dosages for improved safety and longer infusion times. Then you'll see likely a better safety profile than
jakafi but with CRs/PRs and many CIs.

Bring it. But in the pooled Comfort studies (which reflect an earlier era of Jakafi use, and include control
subjects who were only given Jakafi after a delay) there were 50% long-term survivors (5+ years). That is
more than the fraction of patients in the Mayo series who responded at all to imetelstat. The other guy in
the race you propose is running too.

I hope JNJ/Geron do "bring it" and then jakafi can be judged under the latest standards apples to apples
and we will watch jakafi shrink a bag of blood which IMET would do as well and clear the marrow fibrosis
on some patients.


Remember, jakafi "fails" many MF patients (R/R) where IMET gets at least some CIs yet to be deciphered.
If IMET brings it first line ( a much easier road to travel ) with appropriate doseages that can be quickly
reduced and frequencies lessened, IMET would more than bring it. Those Comfort trials where not
overseen well and under old rating standards. I'd love to see it and that's really JNJ's goal. There is a very
good reason Dr. Tefferi hates jakafi and prefers IMET as well as Dr. Raza for MDS patients.

Tefferi found that it was not worth the risk to dose every week because of myelosuppression. It was
increased frequency of dosing that caused the issue. When patients are reliant on the mutated clone then
destroying those clones would show up as myelosuppression and that is why one must respect Imetelstat
according to Tefferi. He also said that the myelosuppression can be managed very easily.

So true Jorge..... If one drinks too much water the odds of becoming sodium deficient is very high.
It can be dangerous.


20 Feb 2018, 04:13 PM


User 7649441
unfortunately not a good comparison at all! The human body has checks and balances to insure that no
body 'drinks too much water' to the level of danger. Furthermore the amount of sodium most 'average'
americans consume is way too high.


On the other hand, any pharmaceutical component introduced into the human body has no natural
defenses against "danger"


20 Feb 2018, 04:25 PM

Do you want to bet 441....Too much water can be a danger.


It happened twice to my dad. Too much water can flush out the sodium in your body. It can be especially
dangerous for older people.

wow, was i so wrong to get back into Geron so early! This has nothing to do with longs, shorts, but more to do with
no results from Geron!


1. buying too early in the day means you're buying from shorts
2. Geron achieved $1.75 or so not to long ago, this is where we're headed as the market corrects
3. Geron has showed it holds no water, so $1.75 is where it stabilizes at
4. Management has produced nothing of concrete value but delays, so the market is pricing that in.
5. No amount of optimism can check a market slide, which simply did a short covering bounce last week, and
continuing the correction, and Geron along with it.


6. Geron needs to pull a magic rabbit out of the hat, but there is none as management goes by the book and
typically announces delays rather than any 'surprise'.


20 Feb 2018, 04:07 PM


User 7649441
hmm, look at all that "buying" or short covering. After all is said and done, Geron price goes back down again to
trade at a lower level. Shares just changing hands lower and lower like a balloon deflating.


Something needs to come from geron, otherwise, we'll be re-valued lower.

I don't understand this business about 'not enough shares' to cover. Just about anyone can buy shares or
buy to cover shares. I bought some today and it appears that if he markets indexes weaken, someone else
can buy tomorrow, or next week for even cheaper.


As long as shares are being sold for pennies higher, someone can buy shares to "treasure" or to cover
short positions.

In other words, AE probably believes in what he writes, with elements of misinformation. He knows that the
market indexes weakening is on his side for as low as Geron will go, then he will probably get out and
secretly flip to the long side, if and when that happens.

This second hit article is proof positive that AE didn't, and wasn't able, to cover as many of his (or his group's)
shorts after the first article. This is proof positive that he waited too long, and was expecting a greater downside, or
was simply greedy.


You guys are outstanding in answer to this garbage. I will buy the first round of drinks on Turtle.


What a great rebuttal to all this nonsense! It, once again, goes to show that the years of productivity, and
knowledge gained, by our group, is second to none on Seeking Alpha.


This is purely a case of diminishing returns for the "SHORT GUY". Any further articles by him would likely make
the stock rise. Today's minor decline must be such a drag on his ability to cover, LOL!

I have a feeling MTB is about to write another article, even though this AE article may have caught him off guard
for a minute, or two.


This is an exciting time for all of us and today's hit piece proves what we've known all along. Aside from the
original AE article, which caught the markets in a surprise, this latest attempt is desperation. What a great day!!

of Hy's Law.
- we BELIEVE this MAY just be a silver lining in an overall gloomy situation
- We BELIEVE that viral hepatitis can be ruled out 
- We BELIEVE it is unlikely that Janssen would enroll cirrhotic patients 
- we BELIEVE that the patients in IMerge were likely on other drugs
- the drugs LIKELY won't have issues with Hy's Law
- we can deduce that imetelstat ../.. LIKELEY is behind the combination of elevated aminotransferase and serum
total bilirubin
- IF our analysis is correct
- There MAY be additional Hy's Law cases IF any of the patients that experienced a grade 3 worsening of AST
and/or ALT 
- IF our observations are correct
- patients MAY be found to meet Hy's Law 
- We BELIEVE this increases the risk of another clinical hold
- we BELIEVE it's clear that the FDA is taking this seriously
- We BELIEVE investors should not take this disclosure lightly
- Imetelstat MIGHT Be Brought Down By Hy's Law
- we THINK it MAY have to do with imetelstat's safety profile
- we BELIEVE imetelstat's safety profile is too dangerous 
- We BELIEVE imetelstat has at least one patient that meets Hy's 
- it is POSSIBLE that more MAY be found
- We BELIEVE the risks of another clinical hold by the FDA are high


You believe and suggest a lot, but where are the FACTS?
You claim that LFT are not reversible, while the past 5 years all official sources are saying it is? Do you want us to

A more specific signal of such potential is a higher rate of more marked peak AT elevations (10x-, 15xULN), with
cases of increases to >1,000 U/L causing increased concern. The single clearest (most specific) predictor found to
date of a drug’s potential for severe hepatotoxicity, however, is the occurrence of a small number of cases of
hepatocellular injury (aminotransferase elevation) accompanied by increased serum total bilirubin (TBL), not
explained by any other cause, such as viral hepatitis or exposure to other hepatotoxins, and without evidence of
cholestasis, together with an increased incidence of AT elevations in the overall trial population compared to
control. Increased plasma prothrombin time, or its international normalized ratio (INR), a consequence of reduced
hepatic production of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, is another potentially useful measure of liver function
that might suggest the potential for severe liver injury.

If there is one message we DO KEEPING HEARING over and over is that Geron's IMET safety profile is
as expected and the FDA has had years and many cross experiments to see IMET's safety profile. Also,
that patients do recover to baseline going off the drug. As to any patient deaths, there are not many we
know of and all these patients being so severe and terminal should or would be dead already and they of
course are not. As to the FDA requesting more data/information about IMBARK trial, of course they would
and should like any other trial making OS improvements beyond any drug that ever existed because jakafi
FAILS these patients. IMET is providing added benefit beyond only death. We just need to determine how
much benefit but the trial still continuing this long demonstrates safety and efficiacy.

thing, but deliberately trying to down a stock is especially one seeking a cure or treatment should be criminal.

After requesting information from GERN, FDA didn’t follow up with any action for a few months already, so that
means information received has satisfied FDA concerns. In cases of possible patient death, FDA always acts
promptly without hesitation. They are rather in error than risking patient lives. So I believe your posted concern is
simply FUD without merit at this point. Your short position continues to be in danger.

"After requesting information from GERN, FDA didn’t follow up with any action for a few months already, so

take more time to review the case of imetelstat. I found that the FDA tends to be fairly unpredictable

'This is an assumption'
No, it is LOGIC. If the drug would have been so dangerous FDA would have never given FTD.


What is also NOT a assumption, is that Dr. Raza said that imetelstat is probably safer than SoC,
lenalidomide and HMA's. Do you really think that I prefer the assumptions of these shorts above the
opinion of a famous doctor, who is on top of all the data?


Come on!


This article, on the contrary, is full of assumptions.

telomerase
Still like CDXC.


Now, why I hate your article ;)


You are fully aware that the potential of imetelstat comes in combinations, e.g. the recent preclinical with
venetoclax against AML. Imet's toxicity will be far less when it is used in combination, as it won't be
necessary to use it as often.


Also, GERN has patents on other oligos which can now be delivered by cell-penetrating peptides. These
second-generation telomerase inhibitors won't have the liver toxicity problems.


It's pretty clear that not only will imet be approved, but it will quickly be used off-label on multiple
applications, and quickly followed by better TI drugs. The only reason imet took this long to get anywhere
is that it had been stuck under the GERN bushel basket instead of being championed by a real pharma
company.

I really think you need to do much better research and not post such one sided material. Fda only places
holds on trials for deaths. A data safety monitoring board put holds on trials for safety concerns. Opdivo
one of the hottest IO drugs has 11% ALT grade 3/4 AND 18% AST. Also 7% Bili elevation. All hitting your
HY law. Opdivo is here to stay. Geron is a gamble and I am biased having a strong position. What you fail
to ever mention is that a small percentage of patients with myelofibrosis have complete remission. This is
unheard of and in my opinion, if it holds up it will result in approval and overcome any Hy issues.

In my opinion, the advance notice & timing of the press release suggests Geron will be having their Joint Steering
Committee meeting with Janssen in the day(s) just prior to the press release. The location of the meeting is most
likely at Janssen's facility in Raritan, NJ. Geron will publicly release the outcome of the meeting ASAP via the
Friday press release, and they'll get themselves home & ready to discuss the press release on Monday morning.

“In my opinion, the advance notice & timing of the press release suggests Geron will be having their Joint

That is an interesting observation. I wonder if you might elaborate. At this stage in the development of Imet
what might the Joint Steering Committee be considering, and what sort of advice or options might they be
giving with regard to the two ongoing clinical trials? I’m trying to understand the role of the Joint Steering
Committee at a time that appears crucial to GERN. Thanks. - Sargasso

Geron's announcement of the upcoming march 19th event states "to discuss the company’s fourth quarter
and annual results as well as recent events."

I assumed the "recent events" part would pertain to the IMbark Interim Data review that Dr. Scarlett has
stated would be complete by the end of Q1. The timing of this interim data review is shown as mid-March
in the January'18 Corporate Presentation that is prominent on Geron's home page (link below; slide 19).
http://bit.ly/2qKlK9A


However, as reported on one of the other GERN threads, the March 16th earnings release date may
simply be a function of the SEC's 75-day reporting requirement (link below). March 16th is in fact the 75th
day of 2018.
http://bit.ly/2t5woJB


With regard to your Steering Committee question, the Nov'14 collaboration agreement calls for the
formation & periodic meeting of a joint (Janssen/Geron) steering committee. This steering committee
reviews available date, and sets the course for ongoing and/or future Imetelstat development efforts. After
review of the Q1 interim review data, the steering committee will decide if the current IMbark trial proceeds
as-is, proceeds with modifications, terminates, etc.

The two recent AE 'hit' job articles may have been written to protect the $3 Calls. A little good news
beforehand could go a 'Long' way but unlikely under the circumstances. Looks like a Mexican standoff until
3/16.


On 3/19, If shorts were able to keep pps at ~ $2 on 3/16 - downside risk for longs (if news is not overtly
positive) is perhaps a 50 to 60 cent slide with a probable bounce back once info is digested and negative
spin dealt with.


OTH, if good news, as many longs anticipate, shorts forcing the pps to $2 on 3/16 could be a Short Trap
with shorts scrambling on 3/19 to cover before good news gets legs.


Smart move may be to buy at $2 on or before 3/16 if possible. Just conjecture - will be interesting.

It's really impossible to discern what is going to be said but the idea of a Friday press release and a Monday
conference is disconcerting, to say the least.


Recent events could well be more than an update on OS. Could we have reached median survival? Didn't Scarlett
say they will notify us? I mean, would they wait three weeks to tell us they've reached median survival, in a prior
time?


What possible reason could they have for waiting, unless the conference is ONLY about earning's and an update
on ImBark that talks about waiting for maturing data in the 3rd quarter?


I really don't like the idea of a Friday press release but it is what it is.

Couldn't it just be two different focuses ? Friday is the Earning call which is really not very interesting at all
since no real action.


Monday is probably focused on updating from the internal review one way or another but the fact that it is
an Analyst Conference inclines me to think there is something interestingly good. I mean, do you call
analysts together to announce that you are closing trials and going out of business ?

Geron's large short position is rational but not necessarily based on better information. Geron certainly conforms to
the profile biotech shorts find attractive (one product in clinical trials which has already been placed on hold by the
FDA etc. etc.). In fact, the current size of the short position is largely attributable to the FDA's Hold (millions of
shares were shorted at below 2 when the FDA placed Imetelstat on Hold).


We Geron shareholders who have held for many years are not happy about the pps but understand why it is
where it is. We've held because we believe the drug will ultimately be approved and that it will be very successful.

I'm sure most of us think the time frame to confirmation is in months, perhaps weeks, maybe even days, not years.
Shorts have yet to come to that conclusion and probably won't until it is irrefutable.


Unfortunately for Geron's shorts, if there is irrefutable evidence of Imetelstat's future success, it will probably come
after a steady climb in the pps similar to the recent pattern, i.e. a steady rise without news. AE is clearly a clever
short and has followed the stock closely enough to read the Tea Leaves. His two shamefully manipulative articles
may have served his purpose and provided him an opportunity to exit more gracefully than his short brethren.


None of us know how this will eventually play out - especially if the past is prologue. 
OTH, even if the only info shared via the Trial Review, due by the end of this quarter, is that medium survival has
not been reached and that those patients participating in the trial will continue to receive Imetelstat, the probability
of success will become extremely difficult to refute. If the news is favorable - shorts will start covering, institutions
will increase their holdings and the pps will respond accordingly. The rise may come in fits and starts or it may be
sudden and sustained, regardless I'm sure it will eventuate in a pps that will reward our patience. The odds I
believe have subtly turned significantly in our favor.

That all makes sense (sic: it's "median" survival). I would go farther and say that 99% of "the shorts" are
just HFT programs working off historical statistics. That's why there has never been a negative article
about GERN in the real financial media... or ANY articles since 2014.


To keep things in perspective, the total short interest is only ~70 million. So while it's true that high short
interest is statistically a bad sign, Geron's short interest is not large enough in an absolute sense to
indicate deep research... if there were one fund with a billion short, that might mean that they had actually
put an intern onto researching the position. Hundreds of short HFTs with a few hundred thousand short
each may well not be doing anything more than looking at GERN's price history.

Sangamo going from $3 to $27 in a year is what We all should hope for Geron also. I used to have bunch of
Sangamo stocks. I sold it out of frustration. Subsequently They kicked out their founder CEO and now they are
doing fine.


The reason Geron shareholders are so bothered by a clown sitting in his pajama in his Mom basement writing
these hit pieces is because that they have not had a sniff of winning for so long. Company always has an excuse
for failing, but excuses after a long while become old.

All indications and data lately point to efficacy, safety, and an unmet need. That is, of course, why imetelstat has
been given Fast Track Status by the FDA. In my opinion, given the latest data, approval seems very likely. When I
buy a stock, in this sector, I am looking for undervaluation against its future likely value and potential. Geron has it
all going for it currently.IMO Those short or negative are not only wrong, IMO, but looking back in the rear view
mirror. If that were not enough, there is a big short position: 30 Million plus shares as of the latest release. Simply
a fact. If the longs currently have this right, imagine trying to cover all those shares on good news. I do not buy
stocks because of short positions, but I do not ignore the reality of them either. If I like this stock, the short position
is just an additional great fact, and will need to be covered at some point. Try buying 30 million shares here, even
now, and see what happens!! We shall see how it works out, but I would not part with a single share and will hold
till the story unfolds fully, regardless of any volatility. But I do think this is going up multiples of its current price over
the next couple of years, or maybe sooner! EOS IMO

If, if, if, lot's of if's. Anyone in Geron who doesn't know he can lose big is just not aware. On the other

All that needs to happen right now is a continuation of both trials and a continuation of the results we've
seen. We don't need anything new to happen, just a continuation of what was seen recently in both
ImBark and IMerge.

You just may get your wish if JNJ or Geron takes IMET frontline MF against jakafi as a control. Then we will see
the truth and nothing but the truth. I would expect IMET to work faster and with real curing results and be able to
back down dosages for improved safety and longer infusion times. Then you'll see likely a better safety profile than
jakafi but with CRs/PRs and many CIs.

Bring it. But in the pooled Comfort studies (which reflect an earlier era of Jakafi use, and include control
subjects who were only given Jakafi after a delay) there were 50% long-term survivors (5+ years). That is
more than the fraction of patients in the Mayo series who responded at all to imetelstat. The other guy in
the race you propose is running too.

I hope JNJ/Geron do "bring it" and then jakafi can be judged under the latest standards apples to apples

Remember, jakafi "fails" many MF patients (R/R) where IMET gets at least some CIs yet to be deciphered.
If IMET brings it first line ( a much easier road to travel ) with appropriate doseages that can be quickly
reduced and frequencies lessened, IMET would more than bring it. Those Comfort trials where not
overseen well and under old rating standards. I'd love to see it and that's really JNJ's goal. There is a very

Ok, invoking Hy's Law is going a bit far. Evidence of recovery after the drug is discontinued pretty much cancels
the alarm (well, partly depending on speed of recovery...I was once almost a Hy's law case, but recovered in a
week...the drug is still used).


But imetelstat IS still a very toxic drug. We've been told repeatedly that the Janssen results fit the safety/tolerability
profile of the NEJM puplications...that is pretty poor. It has also never been compared in public against either
simultaneous controls or MATCHED historical controls.

I don't write articles and I didn't write this one--partly because I'd prefer to write about Incyte, which is too
complicated for an amateur to analyze, and partly because of my limited tolerance for geroniacs. As an
honest person would acknowledge, I've been positive on the prospects for imetelstat in MDSs for as long
as anyone, so it wouldn't make sense for me to be short.


In the only detailed reports we have of imetelstat trials, the ones in the infamous NEJM issue, both trials
showed more serious adverse events than patients treated. That's pretty gul-durned Scotchtic! And
increasing the dose caused bone marrow failure. And Janssen found that decreasing the dose decreased
effectiveness...there's Murphy's Law for you.


My other favorite long prospect, by the way, is Portola, a company managed as badly as Geron, maybe
even worse...but they somehow developed a couple of superb drugs which are reaching market this year.

Tefferi found that it was not worth the risk to dose every week because of myelosuppression. It was
increased frequency of dosing that caused the issue. When patients are reliant on the mutated clone then
destroying those clones would show up as myelosuppression and that is why one must respect Imetelstat
according to Tefferi. He also said that the myelosuppression can be managed very easily.

So true Jorge..... If one drinks too much water the odds of becoming sodium deficient is very high.
It can be dangerous.


20 Feb 2018, 04:13 PM


User 7649441
unfortunately not a good comparison at all! The human body has checks and balances to insure that no
body 'drinks too much water' to the level of danger. Furthermore the amount of sodium most 'average'
americans consume is way too high.


On the other hand, any pharmaceutical component introduced into the human body has no natural
defenses against "danger"


20 Feb 2018, 04:25 PM

Do you want to bet 441....Too much water can be a danger.


It happened twice to my dad. Too much water can flush out the sodium in your body. It can be especially
dangerous for older people.

wow, was i so wrong to get back into Geron so early! This has nothing to do with longs, shorts, but more to do with
no results from Geron!


1. buying too early in the day means you're buying from shorts
2. Geron achieved $1.75 or so not to long ago, this is where we're headed as the market corrects
3. Geron has showed it holds no water, so $1.75 is where it stabilizes at
4. Management has produced nothing of concrete value but delays, so the market is pricing that in.
5. No amount of optimism can check a market slide, which simply did a short covering bounce last week, and
continuing the correction, and Geron along with it.


6. Geron needs to pull a magic rabbit out of the hat, but there is none as management goes by the book and
typically announces delays rather than any 'surprise'.


20 Feb 2018, 04:07 PM


User 7649441
hmm, look at all that "buying" or short covering. After all is said and done, Geron price goes back down again to
trade at a lower level. Shares just changing hands lower and lower like a balloon deflating.


Something needs to come from geron, otherwise, we'll be re-valued lower.

Alpha Exposure just doesn't understand. Fidelity is selling, JNJ won't buy GERN, GERN's CEO won't buy GERN.
And of course the short interest is very high.


But WE, the long-underwater GERNiacs, are RIGHT and everyone else is wrong ;)

Now would be a great time for the GERN price to stop falling. It's also a great time to remember about

It's obvious Seeking Alpha does not vet articles, or their writers, as they should. By coming up with this second hit
piece all Geron stockholders should be comfortable in the knowledge that only the real news is important going
forward.


AE has not been able to cover as much as he had hoped, of that we can be fairly certain.

I don't understand this business about 'not enough shares' to cover. Just about anyone can buy shares or
buy to cover shares. I bought some today and it appears that if he markets indexes weaken, someone else
can buy tomorrow, or next week for even cheaper.


As long as shares are being sold for pennies higher, someone can buy shares to "treasure" or to cover
short positions.


20 Feb 2018, 01:32 PM


User 7649441
In other words, AE probably believes in what he writes, with elements of misinformation. He knows that the
market indexes weakening is on his side for as low as Geron will go, then he will probably get out and
secretly flip to the long side, if and when that happens.

What a great rebuttal to all this nonsense! It, once again, goes to show that the years of productivity, and
knowledge gained, by our group, is second to none on Seeking Alpha.


This is purely a case of diminishing returns for the "SHORT GUY". Any further articles by him would likely make
the stock rise. Today's minor decline must be such a drag on his ability to cover, LOL!


We've finally come full circle guy's and ladies. The news becomes everything and the news will be forthcoming.
We'll let Alpha Exposure wallow in his "stow high" and move forward.


I have a feeling MTB is about to write another article, even though this AE article may have caught him off guard
for a minute, or two.


This is an exciting time for all of us and today's hit piece proves what we've known all along. Aside from the
original AE article, which caught the markets in a surprise, this latest attempt is desperation. What a great day!!

These are the words they use to mislead readers and to keep lawyers away:


- MAY have a patient that meets Hy's Law
- We BELIEVE the FDA is especially sensitive to DILI 
- We BELIEVE it is clear that this is a risk factor
- Why imetelstat MAY have at least one patient that meets Hy's Law
- We BELIEVE this slide indicates that imetelstat has at least one patient that meets two of the three components
of Hy's Law.
- we BELIEVE this MAY just be a silver lining in an overall gloomy situation
- We BELIEVE that viral hepatitis can be ruled out 
- We BELIEVE it is unlikely that Janssen would enroll cirrhotic patients 
- we BELIEVE that the patients in IMerge were likely on other drugs
- the drugs LIKELY won't have issues with Hy's Law
- we can deduce that imetelstat ../.. LIKELEY is behind the combination of elevated aminotransferase and serum
total bilirubin
- IF our analysis is correct
- There MAY be additional Hy's Law cases IF any of the patients that experienced a grade 3 worsening of AST
and/or ALT 
- IF our observations are correct
- patients MAY be found to meet Hy's Law 
- We BELIEVE this increases the risk of another clinical hold
- we BELIEVE it's clear that the FDA is taking this seriously
- We BELIEVE investors should not take this disclosure lightly
- Imetelstat MIGHT Be Brought Down By Hy's Law
- we THINK it MAY have to do with imetelstat's safety profile
- we BELIEVE imetelstat's safety profile is too dangerous 
- We BELIEVE imetelstat has at least one patient that meets Hy's 
- it is POSSIBLE that more MAY be found
- We BELIEVE the risks of another clinical hold by the FDA are high


You believe and suggest a lot, but where are the FACTS?
You claim that LFT are not reversible, while the past 5 years all official sources are saying it is? Do you want us to
believe that everybody is lying and you are not?

A more specific signal of such potential is a higher rate of more marked peak AT elevations (10x-, 15xULN), with
cases of increases to >1,000 U/L causing increased concern. The single clearest (most specific) predictor found to
date of a drug’s potential for severe hepatotoxicity, however, is the occurrence of a small number of cases of
hepatocellular injury (aminotransferase elevation) accompanied by increased serum total bilirubin (TBL), not
explained by any other cause, such as viral hepatitis or exposure to other hepatotoxins, and without evidence of
cholestasis, together with an increased incidence of AT elevations in the overall trial population compared to
control. Increased plasma prothrombin time, or its international normalized ratio (INR), a consequence of reduced
hepatic production of Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, is another potentially useful measure of liver function
that might suggest the potential for severe liver injury.

Geron needs a re-evaluation of market value. Apparently nothing yet comeing from Geron or Jansen will

I am a former student of Dr. Hy Zimmerman and yes that was a long time ago, Hy was a fine fine gentleman and a
brilliant man. I think it is clear that the FDA has addressed the HY's law concerns years ago and sternly so with the
temporary clinical hold. It is also apparent and true that preeminent physicians such as Dr. Tefferi and Dr. Raza
have experience with use of the drug as well as physicians at all of the institutions involved in both the MF and the
MDS studies. These total over 100 well regarded institutions around the world with the blessing and supervision of
the FDA and Janssen. I am laughing that anyone is taking this poorly informed drivel as worth discussing and will

If there is one message we DO KEEPING HEARING over and over is that Geron's IMET safety profile is
as expected and the FDA has had years and many cross experiments to see IMET's safety profile. Also,
that patients do recover to baseline going off the drug. As to any patient deaths, there are not many we
know of and all these patients being so severe and terminal should or would be dead already and they of
course are not. As to the FDA requesting more data/information about IMBARK trial, of course they would
and should like any other trial making OS improvements beyond any drug that ever existed because jakafi
FAILS these patients. IMET is providing added benefit beyond only death. We just need to determine how
much benefit but the trial still continuing this long demonstrates safety and efficiacy.

And we may also believe they don't have a patient that meets Hy's Law. Unless the study is completely flawed no
one should know either way.

Whenever a headline or line in an article says "may" or "might" it also means "may not" or "might not", so it
always pays to read them as "may or may not" and that gives you the real value of the headline.

that actually do research, anyway. Wouldn't it have been nice if more shorts had published about Enron?
Or VRX? Or TEVA?

It’s easier to manipulate when it hovers around and through the moving averages, especially in a period of
consolidation

FDA handed out a clincal hold in the past but lifted that. Now they handed out a fast track for MDS..please stop

Courtesy to what your short “blog” as it’s not a news article Conjecture. You are close to being libel or maybe you
are. Good luck on your short. I just unsusciebed to seeking alpha

After requesting information from GERN, FDA didn’t follow up with any action for a few months already, so that
means information received has satisfied FDA concerns. In cases of possible patient death, FDA always acts
promptly without hesitation. They are rather in error than risking patient lives. So I believe your posted concern is
simply FUD without merit at this point. Your short position continues to be in danger.

"After requesting information from GERN, FDA didn’t follow up with any action for a few months already, so
that means information received has satisfied FDA concerns". This is an assumption. The FDA might just
take more time to review the case of imetelstat. I found that the FDA tends to be fairly unpredictable

CNAT,SRPT.NWBO as a long shot.You are short.I think you are in the same position General Custer found
himself.

'This is an assumption'
No, it is LOGIC. If the drug would have been so dangerous FDA would have never given FTD.


What is also NOT a assumption, is that Dr. Raza said that imetelstat is probably safer than SoC,
lenalidomide and HMA's. Do you really think that I prefer the assumptions of these shorts above the
opinion of a famous doctor, who is on top of all the data?


Come on!

As Geron succeeds, Incy should make a good short.

I don’t necessarily agree with this article but man do I love this comment. Hilarious.

We do not have to do anything to justify why we do not like the crap article. We just have to point out it is
crap.


20 Feb 2018, 09:28 AM


telomerase
Still like CDXC.


Now, why I hate your article ;)


You are fully aware that the potential of imetelstat comes in combinations, e.g. the recent preclinical with
venetoclax against AML. Imet's toxicity will be far less when it is used in combination, as it won't be
necessary to use it as often.


Also, GERN has patents on other oligos which can now be delivered by cell-penetrating peptides. These
second-generation telomerase inhibitors won't have the liver toxicity problems.


It's pretty clear that not only will imet be approved, but it will quickly be used off-label on multiple
applications, and quickly followed by better TI drugs. The only reason imet took this long to get anywhere
is that it had been stuck under the GERN bushel basket instead of being championed by a real pharma

There have been 0 deaths due to Hy's Law and the FDA had them show reversibility in order to lift the hold
taking Hy's Law off the table.


20 Feb 2018, 10:14 AM


telemorase
For a change, i agree with telomerase


20 Feb 2018, 10:23 AM


tjmdsm
I really think you need to do much better research and not post such one sided material. Fda only places
holds on trials for deaths. A data safety monitoring board put holds on trials for safety concerns. Opdivo
one of the hottest IO drugs has 11% ALT grade 3/4 AND 18% AST. Also 7% Bili elevation. All hitting your
HY law. Opdivo is here to stay. Geron is a gamble and I am biased having a strong position. What you fail
to ever mention is that a small percentage of patients with myelofibrosis have complete remission. This is
unheard of and in my opinion, if it holds up it will result in approval and overcome any Hy issues.

Every single article you've ever posted was in support of your own short sell-why would you be interested
in long positions?

Hawk,


Most likely in order to find out what biotechs are widely held by SA readers, so he can write more hit
pieces on them.
