Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Services


We thoroughly evaluated 4 primary selling points for CorPath and conclude none of
them are compelling reasons for healthcare providers to purchase the system.


CorPath simply can't perform many complex procedures on its own, and these
represent around 80% of PCI procedures.


CorPath lacks reimbursement and compelling clinical data showing improvements
in patient outcomes vs. traditional procedures.


Far cheaper alternative solutions exist to protect the IC from radiation exposure,
orthopedic injury and fatigue.


With cash burn of nearly $30mil per year, the company is on pace to raise
additional capital by mid-2018.  We see downside of over 60% for shares.

Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc. (NYSEMKT:CVRS) was originally an Israeli company,
founded in 2002, and currently resides in Waltham, Mass. The company achieved FDA
approval for its CorPath 200 robotic Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) system
in 2012. PCI, formerly known as coronary angioplasty, is a nonsurgical procedure that
improves blood flow to the heart by opening stenotic (narrowed or blocked) coronary
arteries. Since gaining FDA approval, the company has only installed 51 CorPath
systems in the past 5 years.


Recently the stock has significantly outperformed the market based on expectations for
increased adoption of the next-gen system, CorPath GRX. Based on our analysis, we
believe analyst estimates remain wildly optimistic and will ultimately have to be revised
downward. In addition, because the company continues to burn a substantial amount of
cash, we believe the company will be forced to tap the equity market around Q3 of next
year and will substantially dilute the shareholder base again. In the following article, we
thoroughly examine the company and analysts' overly optimistic assumptions, and
provide evidence that strongly suggests shares of CVRS are overvalued by more than
60%.

The CorPath vascular robotic system consists of an arm loaded with a disposable
cassette that holds instruments (guidewire, balloon/stent) used in PCI procedures and a
station where the interventional cardiologist, or IC, can view and control the instruments.
The CorPath robotic system costs $350,000 to $650,000 per unit, and each procedure
requires a cassette that costs $550 to $650. According to CVRS, one of the primary
advantages to the CorPath system is the ability to perform the procedure at a station
that reduces radiation exposure to the IC by over 95% without wearing heavy protective
gear.

The company and analysts have been making an extremely bullish case for CVRS. On
the surface, there appears to be a lot of positive aspects to the CorPath system that
should drive adoption, but it’s been approved since 2012, and installs have fallen
woefully below original forecasts. The question investors should be asking themselves is
obvious: If CorPath provides the vast improvement to the procedure that management
and analysts claim, why isn’t it selling?
Exaggerated Radiation Results:


Over the next several pages we will address what we believe to be the key investor
selling points the company uses to promote CorPath and explain why these arguments
just aren’t working. We will also review the overtly bullish claims of those who have a
vested interest to make them, and explain why we believe estimates will continue to fall
far short of expectations. As expectations fall short, the company will likely burn its cash
balance faster than anticipated, leading to further dilutive equity raises that force the
stock lower.


We see 4 primary arguments for investing in CVRS. We will evaluate each leg of the
stool to see if CVRS can hold up under the weight of scrutiny.

As we mentioned above, the primary advantage to the CorPath system is the improved
work environment for the interventional cardiologist. CVRS was able to show in the
PRECISE study in 2013 that by remotely operating behind a lead-lined cockpit, the IC is
subjected to radiation levels 95.2% below those recorded at the typical operating
location next to the patient. Seated in CorPath’s interventional cockpit, the IC does not
have to wear a heavy lead apron and is able to avoid associated orthopedic injury in the
back, knees and ankles.


These are valid points, and on the surface they make sense. Those in the bull camp are
quick to highlight them as huge advantages over the current procedure and the primary
reason CorPath is the future of vascular surgery. However, there is a strong counter-
argument to these advantages that many investors are likely unaware of.


The PRECISE study compared the radiation level for an IC behind CorPath’s lead-lined
interventional cockpit to the radiation level at the traditional location at the procedure
table.

We contacted the company to clarify how radiation was measured at the procedure
table. A dosimeter was placed at the bedside to measure radiation levels. During a
procedure, the IC wears a protective lead apron and uses other shielding techniques to
block radiation exposure. The study did not take these factors into account.


The study did not compare CorPath radiation levels to an IC wearing a protective lead
apron at the traditional procedure table location.


Since wearing lead aprons and employing other shielding techniques is standard
operating procedure during PCI, the study appears to overstate the improved reduction
in radiation to the IC by stating that radiation levels are reduced by 95.2%. Technically
this statement is true, but the methodology exaggerates the benefit to the IC. Investors
should realize that the study results as presented don't actually represent a meaningful
advantage for CorPath. For example, they also could have compared the radiation
levels at the procedure table to the levels experienced by the operator while eating
lunch in the hospital cafeteria and they should have similar, if not better, results.


The question that the PRECISE study should have asked is: How much does CorPath
reduce radiation dosage to the IC in comparison to manual procedures using lead
aprons and protective shielding techniques?”


Remember, this is one of the biggest selling points for CorPath.


In our opinion, the answer to that question is basically 0%. The two methods block
roughly an equivalent amount of radiation.

Another study that compared protective aprons at different radiation levels showed very
similar results with a 95% reduction in radiation transmission with a 0.508mm lead
apron. We will concede that it is likely marginally safer for the IC to be behind the
CorPath interventional cockpit than at the procedure table, but is a marginal safety
improvement worthy of a $350,000 to $650,000 capital outlay - not including
unreimbursed cassette costs? We don’t think so. While the 95.2% radiation reduction
stat might fool analysts and investors, it’s highly likely that physicians and cath lab
administrators see right through it. Don’t take our word for it; 51 units sold since 2012
speaks for itself.


What About Unprotected Areas?


For arguments sake, let’s consider the remaining advantages to the IC using CorPath.
Although lead aprons cover the majority of the body, and we have established that they
reduce radiation nearly as well as CorPath, certain areas remain exposed, including the
hands, arms, head, neck, and legs. The head and neck (thyroid), including the eyes, are
of particular concern. Seated behind the CorPath cockpit, these areas are protected.
Does that mean ICs conducting a traditional procedure have no options to protect these
areas? The answer is an emphatic no.


According to the Radiation Protection Tools portion of this study, there are several steps
that can be taken to protect areas of the body that are not covered by a lead apron. In
addition to lead aprons, typical personal protective devices include thyroid shields,
eyewear, and gloves. Equipment-mounted shields, suspended drapes, ceiling-
suspended screens, mobile shields, and disposable drapes offer further protection that
results in “dramatic dose reduction for the operator.” Notably, "Ceiling suspended shields
can provide significant additional dose reduction, especially to unprotected areas of your
head and neck.” Disposable drapes have been shown to reduce radiation exposure
substantially “with reported reductions of 12-fold for the eyes, 26-fold for the thyroid, and
29-fold for the hands.”

X-Ray Equipment Improvements


There’s also a product for head protection called the No Brainer. The No Brainer is a
light, lead-free cap made of radiation-blocking bismuth and barium that blocks up to
95% of radiation exposure to the brain. The cap weighs 100 grams, approximately one-
tenth the weight of a lead cap. In a study that utilized a lead drape over the patient and a
No Brainer cap for patients undergoing PCI, radiation exposure to the IC was reduced
by over 70% compared to usual care. The study's lead investigator, Sanjit S. Jolly, MD,
MSc, noted that the cost of the lead drape and No Brainer “is actually quite small.” He
noted that most ICs use each cap for months at a time before throwing them away.
“Wearing a lead cap that weighs a kilogram is very cumbersome, whereas you barely
notice a cap that weighs 100 grams,” he said. There are plenty of protective devices and
gear that offer substantial protection to the IC and staff at a fraction of the cost of a
CorPath.

It is also important to understand PCI is only one way in which ICs are exposed to
radiation. They still need this additional protective equipment for diagnostic angiograms
and other, more complex procedures, or in the event of a CorPath failure that forces
them to complete the procedure manually. Even when everything goes as planned with
CorPath, the IC must place the catheter into the patient manually at the beginning of the
procedure, exposing them to typical procedure radiation.


CorPath does not eliminate the need to purchase protective gear for the IC and staff,
which means the cost of CorPath and the cassettes is entirely incremental.

Lighter Equipment:


At the same time radiation protection equipment is improving, the x-ray equipment that
is the source of the radiation is also being improved to reduce the amount of radiation
required for interventional procedures. Philips (OTCPK:PHPPY), a market leader in
interventional cardiology imagery, claims its new AlluraClarity x-ray equipment reduces
radiation by up to 50% for therapeutic interventions. The FDA approved AlluraClarity in
2013. This also happens to be the last year Philips was the exclusive worldwide
distributor of CorPath. Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF), and GE
(GE) are also keenly focused on radiation dose reduction as procedure complexity is
leading to increased fluoroscopy time. In many cases, these are the same complex
procedures CorPath cannot conduct.


If a hospital is looking to reduce radiation exposure, we believe administrators are far
more likely to consider capital outlays for new, low dose x-ray equipment. After all, it is
the x-ray equipment that is the very source of the radiation, and the equipment can be
used across a broad range of procedures, including complex procedures that CorPath
cannot perform.


The other primary advantage to CorPath is that the IC doesn’t have to wear a heavy
lead apron. Again, from this study in the Personal Protective Devices section, we find
that, “because of the ergonomic hazards of personal protective devices (particularly lead
aprons), attempts to reduce the fatigue and injury associated with wearing heavy
protective apparel have been made.” We found several alternatives to pure lead aprons,
including lead hybrids and lead-free options that offer near-equivalent protection at up to
a 40% reduction to the weight of traditional lead aprons. Although CorPath does relieve
the IC from the weight of a heavy lead apron, that advantage is substantially diminished
with lighter equipment.

Perhaps this is why, in Q1, CVRS announced a new strategic “partnership” with BLOXR.
This new three-year non-exclusive agreement makes CVRS a distributor of BLOXR
products (there was no mention of BLOXR having any interest in becoming a CorPath
distributor). BLOXR is a provider of radiation protection equipment and apparel. They
sell lightweight, lead-free aprons, caps, eyewear, thyroid collars and even a cream to
protect hands from radiation. This is the same equipment and apparel CVRS says you
won’t need to wear if you conduct PCI with a CorPath. Is this really the business
investors are hoping CVRS will expand into? If the biggest selling point of CorPath is
that ICs won’t have to wear this stuff, why are they teaming up with a competitor to sell
it?


If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em!

There’s even a weightless option. The Zero-Gravity (CFI Medical/Biotronik) is a
suspended radiation protection system that cuts radiation exposure by 87% to 100% vs.
standard equipment. Without the weight of a lead apron, the IC can avoid orthopedic
injuries, reduce fatigue, and increase freedom of movement at the preferred location —
next to the patient.


The ZGrav essentially removes nearly all the advantages of the CorPath system to the
IC.

This is Bananas!


With the weight of the unit suspended by an overhead arm, the lead protection can be
increased from the standard 0.5mm to 1.25mm. Unlike the CorPath, it can be wheeled
from room to room to be used for any procedure.

A study conducted in 2016 showed the Zero-Gravity cut radiation exposure to the head
by 97% when compared to traditional protection. As we mentioned earlier, this is
important because lead aprons alone don’t protect sensitive areas like the head, neck,
and eyes. Interestingly, this same study evaluated the radiation reduction when CorPath
is used in conjunction with the Zero-Gravity for PCI. The study found CorPath cut
radiation exposure to the head by an additional 80%. This is seemingly great news for
CVRS, so we were surprised by the lack of promotional material from CVRS highlighting
the study, since they are typically big promoters of positive studies involving CorPath.
Once we reviewed the material, it became apparent why.

Radiation dose is measured in sieverts (Sv). One sievert is considered a massive dose.
If you were exposed to 10 sieverts all at once, you would almost certainly die. When
measuring radiation exposure, sieverts are more commonly measured in microsieverts
(uSv = one millionth of a sievert). The average person is exposed to 0.26 uSv/hr (one
quarter of one millionth of a sievert). When you eat a banana, you are exposed to 0.1
uSv.


The study found that manual PCI with traditional lead protection exposes the head to
14.9 uSv per procedure. Radiation exposure to the head of an IC using the Zero-Gravity
system was 0.5 uSv per PCI procedure. Radiation exposure to the head of an IC using
the Zero-Gravity in conjunction with CorPath was reduced by an additional 80% — to
0.1 uSv.


Another way of saying this is that CorPath reduced radiation exposure to the head by 4
bananas.

Reduced Fatigue:


CorPath’s radiation reduction to the chest, which is typically covered by lead aprons,
was also evaluated, and the improvements were even smaller. What we have here is a
case of diminishing returns where the incremental radiation reduction benefit of CorPath
cannot be justified by its price tag. Lead investigator of the study, Andrew LaCombe,
summed it up best by stating that “given the large reductions in cranial radiation
exposure with the suspended lead curtain (Zero-Gravity), some might question why the
robotic system would even be needed, especially given the cost and learning curve.” A
Zero-Gravity costs about $75,000 to $85,000, or approximately 80% less than the cost
of the CorPath. Now that’s a lot of bananas!

Simple vs. Complex PCI:


Again, while technically true, the benefits don’t seem to justify the cost. Although the IC
is positioned safely behind the cockpit during the procedure, he or she is not stationed
there the entire time. Prior to balloon/stent deployment, the catheter needs to be placed
into the artery manually. This portion of the procedure is performed next to the patient,
where the IC is subject to typical ionizing scatter radiation. This requires wearing
protective gear. Also, during the procedure, the rest of the staff is still positioned near
the patient, so they continue to be subjected to scatter radiation and fatigue.


Still, at least the IC is seated during part of the PCI procedure. Unfortunately, PCI is not
the only procedure ICs perform that subjects them to radiation and fatigue. A significant
portion of an IC’s time is spent conducting diagnostic angiograms. The CorPath system
is not used for diagnostic angiograms.


Diagnostic angiograms represent a significant portion of the work performed by many
interventional cardiologists. Because robotic PCI does not currently offer the
operators a means to decrease radiation exposure during diagnostic catheterizations,
scattered radiation risks will remain a problem, even at centers where robotic PCI is
available. [Source: Journal of the American Heart Association]


ICs also perform other procedures, like atherectomy and percutaneous mitral valve
repair, that also subject the physician to radiation and fatigue. The CorPath is not
approved to perform these procedures either.

http://www.cathlabdigest.com/articles/Percutaneous-Mitral-Valve-Repair
CVRS lacks compelling clinical study evidence of improvement in CorPath patient
outcomes versus traditional manual PCI patient outcomes. No randomized trials have
been completed for either CorPath 200 or GRX. Most of the data that has been
presented showing equivalent outcomes to manual PCI has been from highly selected
patients with fairly simple coronary lesions. CVRS has not been able to show improved
efficacy based on enhanced guidewire dexterity or stent placement. While there is some
evidence that CorPath enhances stent selection over visual methods, in our view, this
alone is not compelling enough to justify the system cost and additional disposable
costs.


Growth in PCI procedures is primarily in the form of complex (type C) lesions, due to an
aging population, equipment and technique improvements, and a decrease in
inappropriate PCI. Inappropriate PCI associated with stable coronary artery disease is
increasingly managed with medication, as studies have shown many patients with stable
disease do not benefit from PCI. Complex PCI is the type CorPath has difficulty with or
is incapable of performing. Complex PCI represents about 80% of PCI procedures.


In 2014, a small study on CorPath robotic PCI of complex lesions was conducted and
was not widely circulated. The study evaluated 19 patients, including 10 (52%) that had
complex “Type C” lesions. Fifty percent of complex type C procedures and 42% of all
procedures had to resort to manual PCI for at least a portion of the procedure. Three out
of 19 robotic procedures had to be aborted, including 2 less complex type B procedures.
In our opinion, administrators and physicians are unlikely to find these results
compelling. Perhaps this is why CVRS doesn’t highlight them.

In the CORA PCI study, the largest study to date for complex lesions, CorPath was
found to be comparable to manual PCI in number of stents per procedure and
fluoroscopy time (radiation), but procedure time was longer in the robotic group. Oddly,
the increased time was found in less complex cases. We suspect this is linked to the
CorPath learning curve. According to study lead investigator Ehtisham Mahmud, MD, it
takes 20 to 25 procedures to “get comfortable” with complex cases. CVRS claims it
takes only 3 procedures for ICs to get comfortable with CorPath. It seems likely that only
the simplest procedures, which don’t represent the bulk of an interventionalist's practice,
can be learned in as few as 3 procedures. The learning curve represents another hurdle
slowing adoption. Overall, clinical results are lacking, and at best show equivalency to
manual PCI. CVRS has not conducted any studies yet on complex lesions using
CorPath GRX.


Looking at the bulk of the evidence, it appears the benefits of robotic PCI are mostly
for the physician, with some spill over to the rest of the cath lab staff and hints, but
not waves, of benefit for patients themselves. [Source: American College of

CorPath does not provide haptic feedback. Haptic feedback is a combination of force
and tactile feedback that ICs rely on particularly in more complex PCI procedures like
chronic total occlusion (CTO). With CorPath, when a guidewire meets resistance, the IC
has no tactile sense to guide him. Without haptic feedback, the IC risks complications
like vessel perforation. According to a review of robotic PCI by the Journal of the
American Heart Association, haptic feedback is important to ICs during PCI:


Although the PRECISE registry reported procedural success of 98%, many
interventionalists feel that tactile sensation of wires and catheters is important for
procedural success in challenging cases. [Source: American Heart Association]


In addition to lack of haptic feedback, the Journal of the American Heart Association
review highlights several other shortcomings that will be difficult for CorPath GRX to
overcome. CorPath does not support over-the-wire coronary interventions, like
microcatheters for CTO and aspiration devices used during heart attacks. CorPath
cannot complete rotational atherectomy for calcified lesions or bifurcation stenting with a
two-stent approach without resorting to traditional manual techniques. In these cases,
ICs must revert to the manual approach to complete a major portion of complex PCI
cases that are becoming more common.


CorPath has only been validated using a 0.014-inch guidewire and rapid balloon and
stent systems. CorPath’s incompatibility with 0.018 and 0.035 guidewires, over-the-wire
balloon catheters, drug-coated balloons, and intravascular imaging catheters represent
other hurdles to increased adoption. In the end, CorPath’s limited utility simply doesn’t
justify the additional cost, in our opinion.

A CorPath robotic system costs between $350,000 and $650,000, and the cassettes
cost around $550 to $650 per procedure. This may not seem like a massive burden, but
in an era where the top priority is cost containment, any unnecessary expense is
excluded. This has likely been a major factor slowing adoption of CorPath. In addition to
the capital cost, the cassettes lack reimbursement, and there’s good reason to believe it
may never be reimbursed, according to Lloyd W. Klein, MD, professor of medicine at
Rush Medical College in Chicago:


I don’t think [the cassettes] will ever be reimbursed. Third-party payors are trying not
to pay for what we are doing now, let alone for additional costs. I don’t see it
happening. They would demand proof of better efficacy and more safety, and that’s
not very likely, at least not right away. You’re talking about a procedure that is keeping
a number of hospitals afloat. So administrators are watching profit margin of these
procedures and the idea that you are going to cut into profit margin for disposables
and you need a large capital outlay would be a very tough sell for most hospitals in
the country right now. —Lloyd W. Klein, MD

ICs Aren’t Using It:


Under the fee-for-service model that dominates reimbursement today, physicians are
reimbursed based on a fee schedule for any identifiable procedure. But third-party
payors (Medicare/Medicaid/insurers) are moving away from the fee-for-service model,
because it increases unnecessary testing and procedures leading to spiraling healthcare
costs. Today, payors and regulators are pushing providers (hospitals, etc.) to increase
value-based (fee-for-value) service where reimbursement is based on the quality of
patient outcomes as an alternative to fee-for-service. In a value-based system,
reimbursement payment risk is pushed to the provider (cath lab) and cost containment
becomes paramount.


Administrators, not physicians, decide where to allocate capital. In an era that is
increasingly focused on cutting costs and improving patient outcomes, administrators
are highly sensitive to unnecessary capital expense. In our view, since healthcare costs
and the pressure to move to a value-based reimbursement model will only increase,
hospital administrators will continue to look to contain unnecessary costs like CorPath.


Since 2012, CVRS has only installed 51 units, including the new CorPath GRX. Each
time an IC conducts a PCI procedure, they must use a new cassette. The more
procedures completed, the more cassettes are required. As the install base grows, and
more physicians are trained to use the device with increasing confidence, we would
expect the number of procedures per unit to grow meaningfully. But that’s not what is
happening. As you can see below, despite the (slow) growth of the install base, the
utilization of CorPath is declining.


In the most recent quarter, cassette revenue per installed unit was only $3,431. If we
annualize the recent quarter’s results, this equates to only $13,724 per year. With cash
burn of just over $28 million for the past two years, it will be a very long time before
CVRS is able to break even, without massive adoption of the CorPath system and
increased utilization.

Cassettes typically cost $550 to $650 per procedure. To be conservative, we’ll assume
the cost per procedure is $500 per cassette. Based on that assumption, we calculated
the number of CorPath PCI procedures per installed units per quarter. The data again
reveals that utilization is on the decline, and in the most recent quarter ICs conducted
fewer than 7 procedures per unit per quarter, or roughly two procedures per month per
unit. If we assumed a higher price per cassette, the results would have been even
worse. According to Stifel, the typical US cath lab conducts 24.1 PCI procedures per
month. If even the hospitals that install the device aren’t using them, how can new
customers justify paying upwards of a half a million dollars for one?


ICs are only conducting roughly two procedures per month using CorPath:
Hard Times For Robotics:


Source: Cliffside Research, SEC filings


CVRS isn’t the only robotic vascular company that has fallen on hard times. Another
area CVRS is looking to enter is peripheral vascular procedures. Hansen Medical and
Stereotaxis (STXS) both already have FDA approval for robotic peripheral vascular
procedures. Hansen got lucky and was bailed out with an acquisition by Auris Surgical.
At the time of the acquisition, Hansen’s financials were similar to CVRS. Hansen had
$16 million in revenue and was burning tens of millions of dollars per year. In July of
2016, Auris paid $80 million for Hansen, or roughly one-third of the current valuation of
CVRS. Stereotaxis hasn’t been so lucky. Despite generating revenue of over $32 million
last year, or over 10x CVRS 2016 revenue, the company has a $17 million market cap
and trades OTC since its Nasdaq delisting last August.


The point is these aren’t easy markets to tap. Hansen already displayed the feasibility of
robotic peripheral vascular intervention, but the system never gained traction in clinical
use. Anyone who has spent time in this industry knows that convincing doctors to
change habits is an extremely difficult endeavor. According to Tom Watson of MD
Buyline:

PCI In The Sky:


Until there are definitive and measurable metrics that can justify the cost or until the
cost of both capital and consumable expense decreases substantially, these solutions
will remain of interest mostly to high-end university and teaching institutions rather
than a mainstream solution for all healthcare providers. —Tom Watson, MD Buyline


In our opinion, the four “legs” supporting CVRS do not stand up under the weight of
scrutiny.

Now let’s take a look at the wildly optimistic analyst estimates supporting the stock.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/10/47406777_15081989121886_rId72.png
Despite the company’s shortfall on CorPath unit sales since coming public, analyst
estimates remain highly aggressive, particularly on the out years. Currently the company
is guiding to $13 million to $15 million in 2017 revenue, which assumes a pretty steep
ramp of $10 million to $12 million in the back half. They also expect to implement at
least 25 new cardiovascular programs in 2017. With the recent introduction of CorPath
GRX at the beginning of the year, those expectations may be achievable as they satisfy
initial demand that may have been waiting on the new system. There are also 35
CorPath 200 legacy units that could upgrade to GRX. Revenue should benefit from paid
upgrades from CorPath 200 to CorPath GRX, although it is highly feasible that many of
those units will not pay to upgrade. But at these levels guidance is largely in the stock.
Following an initial spurt in revenue growth this year we expect demand to again reduce
to a simmer for the reasons we discussed earlier.


First, let’s explore analyst estimates in a little more detail to shed light on how
aggressive estimates remain. CVRS has installed 51 total CorPath units since FDA
approval in 2012. That’s roughly 10 per year for the past five years. Cowen estimates
32, 51 and 105 CorPath unit installs for 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. That’s 188
units over the next three years. Over this same time period, Cowen expects total
revenue including cassettes and service revenue of $13 million, $25 million, and $50
million. For the past three years, CVRS revenue has been under $3 million. To achieve
these estimates, CVRS will need to see a massive ramp in adoption of CorPath GRX.


Incredibly, these aggressive estimates are actually a huge reduction to Cowen’s
initiation estimates. When Cowen provided initial estimates way back in June of 2015,
they assumed CorPath unit installs of 94, 190, and 247 units and total revenue of $38.5
million, $85 million, and $135 million for 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively!


Not to be outdone, when Stifel initiated on CVRS in June 2015, Stifel originally
estimated 130 unit installs for 2017 growing to 518 by 2020, for a total CorPath install
base of 1,379 units and $295 million in revenue. Like Cowen, Stifel has been forced to
take a massive reduction to estimates since 2015 as CVRS has failed to deliver on
these extreme expectations. Currently Stifel is still making very aggressive revenue
assumptions of $14 million, $28.7 million, $51.5 million, and $82.6 million for 2017,
2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Not surprisingly, Cowen and Stifel were also the
bankers for the CVRS IPO in May 2015.
So What’s So Great About GRX Anyway?

The extremely aggressive assumptions for CorPath 200 never materialized. For the
bullish case currently being laid out by analysts to come true, you have to believe the
new upgrades to CorPath GRX are going to massively accelerate adoption. Based on a
review of the upgrades, we do not believe they are enough to overcome the significant
headwinds that foiled CorPath 200’s market entry. The headwinds that foiled CorPath
200’s market adoption are still in place, and we feel are highly likely to continue
hampering the company’s attempt to gain meaningful market share.


So what are the massive improvements that are going to drive huge adoption of
CorPath GRX?
What To Believe


Ability to control the catheter for more complex cases (not clinically validated)


New extended reach arm allows for positioning of radial or femoral access


New touchscreen display on the arm streamlines workflow


Bigger screen in the cockpit


We believe the improvements are primarily marginal in nature, and more significant
developments in the past have not led to increased CorPath adoption. For example,
historically, most PCI procedures have been performed via femoral (leg) access.
Increasingly, PCI procedures are being conducted via radial (arm) access. Prior to
October 2015, CorPath was only approved for femoral access. According to CVRS,
radial access represents approximately 40% of all PCI procedures in the U.S., and is the
predominant approach abroad. That means that prior to approval, CorPath couldn’t
market the radial approach, representing more than 40% of the PCI market.


In October 2015, CVRS received CorPath FDA approval for radial access. At the time
the company stated that “the FDA’s clearance for radial access PCI with the CorPath
System is a significant step in the adoption of robotic PCI." Following radial access
approval, CVRS only installed 11 units over the five quarters preceding GRX approval.
This was very much in line with the install pace prior to radial access approval. If
increasing the addressable market by over 40% didn’t spur increased adoption, why
would the marginal improvements of GRX do so?


CVRS is currently claiming that CorPath 200 (GEN 1) could only perform 25% to 50% of
cases, but that CorPath GRX (GEN 2) can perform 80% to 90% of cases, including
more complex cases.

Conclusion:


Source: Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.


But prior to the approval of GRX, the company conducted the CORA PCI trial
specifically to show CorPath 200’s ability to perform complex cases. Leading the
investigation was Ehtisham Mahmud, MD. He noted that approximately 80% of lesions
treated in the CORA-PCI trial were complex, which is more reflective of contemporary
interventional cardiology practice. All the procedures conducted in that trial used the
CorPath 200 system. So prior to approval of GRX, they were claiming CorPath 200
could complete even the complex procedures that represent 80% of a typical IC’s
practice. Now that they are no longer selling CorPath 200 systems, they claim the
CorPath 200 could only really perform half the procedures, at most. So which is it? This
seems like a convenient way to promote the capabilities of the new system at the
expense of the old system. GRX may marginally increase the addressable market, but
we find the figures above highly promotional.

http://citoday.com/2016/05/04/cora-pci-study-supports-robotically-assisted-pci-in-complex-coronary-lesions
CVRS consistently burns substantial amounts of cash, has never been profitable, and
has an accumulated deficit of $165 million. For the past two years, the company has
burned over $28 million in cash per year and is on pace to burn at least as much this
year. It will likely be several years before the company is cash-flow-positive, if ever. After
the most recent raise in February, the company had $35.2 million in cash on the balance
sheet. At the current burn rate, the company will be out of cash around Q3 of next year.


Prior to that, we suspect it will once again go back to the equity well for another highly
dilutive raise. Since 2015, shares outstanding have nearly doubled, from 105 million to
197 million shares. Since they are burning around $30 million per year, it seems
reasonable to assume they will raise at least this amount on a future round. Using the
past two equity raises of $46 million and $45 million, respectively, as a proxy, we feel it’s
safe to say they’ll likely raise at least $45 million some time next year.


This is a scenario the company’s bankers are likely well aware of. The bankers also
understand that the lower the stock is, the more dilutive the deal will be. Goosing the
stock higher, to a less dilutive price, would help the company. Thus there is substantial
incentive for analysts to put forward highly aggressive estimates and expectations in
hopes of securing a banking deal.


Based on our analysis of the company and the difficulties CorPath GRX faces, we
believe analyst estimates are highly speculative and should not be relied upon. While it
is possible GRX will result in an initial short-term boost to unit sales for the reasons we
explained, we do not believe a temporary increase in activity will lead to a sustainable
increase in adoption.


Growth in PCI is primarily from complex cases. GRX still lacks certain capabilities for
complex cases and has not been clinically validated for complex PCI. We argue that
GRX’s incompatibility with larger guidewires, over-the-wire interventions, and lack of
support for bifurcation stenting with a 2-stent approach represent significant hurdles to
increased adoption.


We evaluated the company’s pitch to investors and found several issues we feel explain
the extremely limited adoption of CorPath to date. Going forward, the company will face
most of these concerns for GRX as well. The pitch to investors essentially boils down to
four main topics:
Reduced radiation


We started with radiation reduction because we believe this is the selling point CVRS
has emphasized as the largest benefit to the IC. We were able to show CorPath does
not reduce radiation exposure as much as the company claims vs. conventional
protective gear. In one clinical trial, the radiation exposure between CorPath and
protective gear was so little it equated to the difference in radiation exposure between
someone eating 5 bananas versus someone eating 1 banana. Based on the lack of
demand, it appears hospitals are not convinced the additional radiation protection from
CorPath justifies the cost. Conventional protective gear can be used for any procedure,
and costs a fraction of a $350,000 to $650,000 CorPath, which has only been validated
primarily for less complex procedures.


Reduced orthopedic strain and fatigue


Historically, ICs have worn heavy lead aprons that cause orthopedic strain and fatigue.
Today ICs have several lead-hybrid and lead-free options that can reduce the weight of
protective gear by up to 40%. There is even a weightless curtain called the Zero-Gravity.
Importantly, the curtain also protects the IC’s head, eyes, and thyroid with a transparent
lead shield. Zero-Gravity essentially eliminates the lead- weight-related orthopedic and
fatigue advantages to CorPath at a fraction of the cost. This also allows the IC to
operate in the preferred position, next to the patient.


Improved procedural control and stent selection


CorPath lacks clinical data demonstrating improved efficacy. At best, CorPath has
shown equivalence to traditional manual PCI. CorPath lacks haptic feedback that ICs
find important, especially in complex cases. According to the American College of
Cardiology, most of the benefits to CorPath appear to be for the physician, not the
patient.


Large Market
If the market were truly as large as the company believes, it would be selling more units.
The disposable cassettes lack reimbursement, and without compelling evidence
showing improved efficacy for robotic PCI over manual PCI, that is not likely to change.
The $550 to $650 cassette cost per procedure is entirely incremental and cuts into
procedure profits. Increasingly, hospitals are being pressured to reduce costs and
improve patient outcomes to justify reimbursement. CorPath does not meet these
objectives. Even in cases where administrators have been able to justify the expense,
ICs aren’t utilizing CorPath as much as expected, with installed units averaging only two
procedures per month. The company will have to show they can meaningfully penetrate
PCI before they can seriously consider other indications, like peripheral vascular,
neurovascular, and structural heart.


CVRS remains a “show me” stock. Until the company can demonstrate the type of
monstrous growth analysts are forecasting, we have no faith in the ability of the
company to succeed. Even with a strong revenue ramp, it will be years before
profitability could be reached, if ever. As we’ve laid out in explicit detail above, we
believe there are several hurdles that will continue to trip up the company. It appears
inevitable CVRS will be back to the equity market next year for another dilutive raise.


Ultimately, we believe CVRS will follow the lead of other vascular robotic companies that
have tried and failed to gain traction in the space, racking up massive losses for
investors in the process. The $165 million in accumulated losses for CVRS pales in
comparison to the $470 million accumulated loss for Stereotaxis. Prior to Hansen
Medical’s buyout at one-third the current valuation of CVRS, they had accumulated
losses of $463 million. We believe CVRS will continue to burn cash and add to their
accumulated losses for the foreseeable future.


Ultimately, companies that can’t turn a profit are worth zero. We can’t see a path to
profitability for CVRS. A year from now, the cash will be gone again. Given this
backdrop, we do not believe the current valuation is justified.

We feel the closest proxies to CVRS are Stereotaxis (STXS) and Hansen Medical.
Inclusive of preferred shares, the enterprise value of STXS is about $39 million. Prior to
Hansen’s acquisition, its enterprise value was about $75 million as a standalone
company. CVRS continues to face significant barriers to increased CorPath adoption.
Therefore, we feel a valuation somewhere in the middle of this range, around $57 million
for CVRS is entirely justified.


Including net cash of $33.7 million, we arrive at a $90.7 million market cap, or 46 cents
per share, representing over 60% downside for CVRS.


Longer-term, if CorPath is unable to gain traction, the company may be worthless.
