A Response To Lumber Liquidators
Mar. 12, 2015 1:46 PM ET138 comments

Summary


In its slide presentation and conference call this morning, Lumber Liquidators said all
the right things - but don't be fooled.


It's telling that management simply read a prepared statement and didn't take any
questions, despite the fact that they have had weeks to prepare.


It's little wonder why Lumber Liquidators is trying to understate its customers' actual
exposure to formaldehyde.


I believe it's a better short today than it was before the 60 Minutes story aired.


Going forward, I'm going to lower my public profile and allocate my time elsewhere.


In its slide presentation and conference call this morning, Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL),
as I expected, said all the right things - but don't be fooled: in reality, it was just a
continuation of the company's campaign of distraction and deception in what I think will
prove to be a vain attempt to mislead customers, investors and regulators.


The accusation against Lumber Liquidators is simple: that in order to save approximately
10% on its sourcing costs, the company has over an extended period purchased in China
and sold to its American customers hundreds of millions of square feet of laminate flooring
that has levels of formaldehyde, a dangerous chemical and known carcinogen, many
times the limit set by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) that the company claims
to adhere to - and that the company knew, or should have known, this.


Yesterday, I was 98% confident that Lumber Liquidators was guilty of this charge. After
hearing the company's defense, I'm now 99% confident.


It's telling that, on its conference call, management simply read a prepared statement and
didn't take any questions, despite the fact that they have had weeks to prepare. This is
highly unusual and an insult to investors and analysts. Other companies hosting a
conference call to address criticism typically take a handful of pre-seeded questions from
friendly sell side analysts, so the fact that Lumber Liquidators wouldn't even do this
speaks volumes. As one analyst said: "If you are 100% clean....you shouldn't be afraid to
talk."

It really boils down to a simple question of credibility: whom are you going to believe? 60
Minutes, one of the most long-standing and respected news programs in the world, whose
lawyers no doubt went through every word of the segment with a fine-toothed comb before
it aired, or a company with every reason to lie, a terrible reputation (see here, here, here,
here and here), and Chinese sourcing questions hanging over it that are so credible that
Federal agents raided its headquarters in September 2013, which (as the company
recently disclosed in its 10-K) could result in criminal charges?


Broadly speaking, Lumber Liquidators is making two defenses:


First, the company on its web site claims that "60 Minutes used an improper test method
in its reporting that is not included in California's regulations and does not measure a
product according to how it is actually used by consumers." In reality, it is Lumber
Liquidators that is using improper test methods.


Those interested in the details of this "debate" can read my articles, Lumber Liquidators'
Campaign Of Distraction And Deception and Why Lumber Liquidators' Wood Testing
Doesn't Comply With CARB, and this one: GeoInvesting Concurs With Tilson And 60
Minutes: Our Take On Testing Methods Used For Lumber Liquidators Study.


But for those who don't have the time or interest, just apply common sense and ask
yourself this simple question: if 60 Minutes' testing (all of which is posted here) was
improper, why did the tests show that 30 out of 31 samples of Lumber Liquidators'
Chinese-made laminate had formaldehyde levels averaging 6-7 times the CARB 2 limit,
yet every sample of laminate flooring from Home Depot, Lowe's and even Lumber
Liquidators' own flooring sourced from U.S. mills was below the limit? The answer is
obvious: because 60 Minutes' testing was accurate and valid.


Kip Howlett, the President of HPVA, which operates HPVA Laboratories, a CARB-certified
lab that I hired to test samples of Lumber Liquidators' laminate, commented:


When you have five labs all doing it the same way and getting the same results, it
isn't about the test method. The company either didn't understand the SOP [CARB's
Standard Operating Procedure for labs], or did understand it and did a work-around.
They're either stupid or they're lying - which is it?


Lumber Liquidators' second line of defense (implied by the company and made explicit by
its defenders) is that, even if its laminate has levels of formaldehyde above the CARB
limit, where's the harm?

5/23/2018 A Response To Lumber Liquidators - Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LL) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2996156-a-response-to-lumber-liquidators 3/34


For starters, read what the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention have to say about formaldehyde: it can cause "watery eyes; burning
sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat; coughing; wheezing; nausea; and skin irritation,"
"upper respiratory tract irritation [that] can potentially exacerbate asthma symptoms and
other respiratory illnesses," "chronic runny nose, chronic bronchitis, and obstructive lung
disease," and is a "known human carcinogen" associated with "several cancers, including
nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia."


But at low levels, serious symptoms are unlikely - so the real question is, what is the
actual, real-world level of formaldehyde Lumber Liquidators is exposing its customers to
via its laminate and what harm might result from this?


The company, not surprisingly, says the level is very low, as shown in slide 16 of its
presentation:


Lumber Liquidators claims that "The emissions from our laminate floors will typically only
add approximately 5 ppb to a home when first installed." If true, this would be good news
since regulators have set 7 ppb as the limit to protect everyone, including children.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2996156-a-response-to-lumber-liquidators 4/34


But the company's claim flies in the face of the evidence. 60 Minutes (which, again, posted
all of its test results here) hired a lab to test three samples of Lumber Liquidators'
laminate, using the California Department of Public Health home model, which tests how
much formaldehyde a typical homeowner would actually be exposed to. In sharp contrast
to the company's claims, these tests showed the following levels:


Sample 1: ~268 ppb/ .292 ppm OR 329.3 μg/m3
Sample 2: ~93 ppb/.101 ppm OR 113.6 μg/m3
Sample 3: ~57 ppb/0.057ppm OR 69.96 μg/m3


In other words, the actual levels of formaldehyde were 11-54 times the levels claimed by
Lumber Liquidators. Whose tests are you going to believe?


When 60 Minutes showed these results to Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the world's leading
experts on this subject (see his bio here and here), he said (according to the transcript):


Dr. Philip Landrigan: It's not a safe level, it's a level that the US EPA calls polluted
indoor conditions.


Anderson Cooper: Would you want that in your home?


Dr. Philip Landrigan: No.


Dr. Philip Landrigan of N.Y.'s Mt. Sinai Hospital, specializes in environmental
pediatrics and exposure to toxic chemicals. He's talking about the results of another
kind of test Drury and Larson conducted measuring the concentration of
formaldehyde emissions coming off the laminates into the air of a typical home.


Dr. Philip Landrigan: I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky
because it would increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a
person's lung function, increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce symptoms
in everyone but children will be the people most likely to show symptoms at that sort
of level.


In light of these frightening risks, especially to children, it's little wonder why Lumber
Liquidators is trying to understate its customers' actual exposure to formaldehyde.


Conclusion


It's been quite a battle royal - the bears have had their day/week/month/year and now the
bulls are having their day/week.

Comments (138)


I more than doubled my position last week (at a price slightly below today's levels) for
reasons I outlined in the article I published at the time, Why I Significantly Increased My
Lumber Liquidators Short Position In The Last Two Days, and haven't traded the stock
since then.


I believe it's a better short today than it was before the 60 Minutes story aired. I'm
confident that the stock has much more downside ahead as the facts emerge and the
company reports earnings over time, especially in light of the high valuation (currently
more than 13x pre-crisis 2015 estimates).


Going forward, I'm going to lower my public profile and allocate my time elsewhere as: 1)
I've now shared publicly my facts and resulting conclusions; and 2) It's not about me (or
60 Minutes or anyone else) vs. the company. It's about the company's actions, what harm
might have resulted, and what the consequences will be.


With numerous state and federal authorities as well as various law firms pursuing this
vigorously, I'm confident that the truth will be out, so I'm going to go back to my regular job
of trying to buy the occasional cheap stock of a good company.

I agreed with your short position when you publicized it in your first article, but, after seeing the momentum swing
since this conference call, I believe that this stock will continue to rise in the coming week/weeks. The bulls appear to
be firmly in control now, and I don't see this stock falling back down for the near future. Just my $0.02. As always,
thank you for your great articles and contributions! =)

I think the momentum will probably start to swing back down once the earnings estimates get reduced. Nomura had
previously reduced their 2015 estimates by $0.30, but from Lumber Liquidators's guidance, it appears that earnings
could fall as much as $0.28 below current expectations due to March alone.

They explained themselves adequately for the market to think the stock is a buy. Apparently the market disagrees
with you. Why lay a low profile now? You need to do more work if you think its still a short.


12 Mar 2015, 03:07 PM


Duane Bair, Contributor
Mr. Tilson nailed it again. The stock is up today and will probably continue to bounce, especially given how dramatic
the fall has been.


Long term, however, liabilities are skyrocketing and revenue will obviously be down in the next few quarters. Plus
there are still the DOJ issues/fines that are likely to come up. As regulators pile onto this, I expect the stock to inch
back down.


12 Mar 2015, 03:09 PM


Advill
It seems that "problem" is affecting 2% of total volume.


In addition to that most states are non CARB complaint so no legal actions there,


And is clear that no legal action will prosper because formaldehyde is a common chemical product used in
thousand of products,


Today short squeeze clear the field for further stability.


12 Mar 2015, 04:33 PM


Duane Bair, Contributor
The DOJ issue is entirely separate from CARB. According to last cc, criminal charges are expected, so a fine
is likely.


Laminate from China is about 11% of rev.. Presumably that would all dry up.


12 Mar 2015, 05:11 PM

Actually, when LL sells a product that says it is CARB compliant and it is not, that is an illegal trade practice in
every state and presently the subject of investigations by multiple state Attorney Generals. You are drinking

You don't get the big picture. The main home builders are all coming out and making statements they don't
use this stuff. Nobody wants to buy a home with this in it. LL said a typical flooring sale cycle is 100 days. 60
Minutes has no choice but to do follow up stories. US Senators and Congressmen have written letters to
government agencies demanding investigations. If a product says it was made to certain specifications and it
is cheaper because it wasn't that is a crime in every state under unfair trade practices and multiple state
attorney generals have initiated investigations and expect more states to join them. The Consumer Product
Safety Commission was about to make a statement but it looks like they are making the statement on 60
minutes now. This problem has not reached it's height so the stock has not reached it's bottom. It is
indisputable that formaldehyde in high enough concentrations is toxic and can cause solid tumors and blood
cancer and other diseases like asthma. Some drugs that are life saving at a therapeutic dose (like coumadin)
are toxic (can kill) at a dose only 10% out of the therapeutic dose. At low doses formaldehyde is harmless so
the government has set a daily allowable dose of 750 parts per million (PPM) and set limits on the many
different products so they cumulatively add up to less than 750 PPM. The laminate floor is allowed to contain
7 PPM and some of the flooring tested at 2000 PPM. Did you see the 60 minute report? They dotted every i
and crossed every t. The entire industry uses a test where the laminate floor is deconstructed and 60 minutes
sent samples to 3 of the 5 companies that test for amaldehyde in lament floors. There is no other test used by
the industry. LL's management read from a printed statement designed to spread misinformation because
they know some people are dumb enough to even buy stock after it files bankruptcy. This stock will get there
soon enough.

"And is clear that no legal action will prosper because formaldehyde is a common chemical product used in

Formaldehyde might be a common chemical product but that doesn't make it any less dangerous in high
concentrations. Would you be willing to take this carcinogenic LL product gamble with your family? I wouldn't.
The brand damage has been done. It wouldn't be smart to overlook this fact.

Hi Advill,


Not sure I agree with your statement ...."In addition to that most states are non CARB complaint so no legal
actions there..."


I think you underestimate the force of aggressive lawyers and sympathetic juries.


If there was mislabeling (and I don't know --- though I have my suspicions) a case can be made that
consumers relied upon it.


Furthermore, it is likely to be a class action suit so the lawyers can shake down LL. If there's mislabeling LL
will most likely settle ... of course with any class action, the lawyers make a ton and the plaintiffs get pennies.

So, I ask you ... do you trust the lawyers to stay away from this if LL has been found to have mislabeled

about it).


As I've said many times, it's not about the formaldehyde ... its about the labeling

LL has already disclosed the reduction in customer traffic, after the 60 minutes aired. This trend will continue for a
while. Earnings and Revenues will diminish in the next earning report(s). Stock can still make holders and shorter
money if proper steps are taken.


12 Mar 2015, 03:09 PM


QNB
If LL is going to address the accusations then take questions! Reasons for not taking questions besides potential
lawsuits? They don't have the answers! It's called back peddling! Put out there what everyone wants to hear! Tom
Sullivan in the 60 Minutes piece lost me when Anderson Cooper asked (regarding the formaldehyde levels) "nobody
has ever reported this to you?" and he completely over rid the question. Of course this was reported to him in 2013
with LL's Carbonized Strand Bamboo! This coupled with their illegal sourcing, thousands of customer complaints even
before the 60 Minutes piece, poor customer service, not standing by their warranties, false reports made by "their"
inspectors....of course the stock was doing well...they made tons of money screwing their customers. Now that people
are seeing them for what they are and being educated the tides will turn. I don't own their stock but I know several
people who have had problems with their business practises and lost thousands of dollars to their sub-standard
products.

I am confused on what everyone is fighting about. This appears to be a VERY black and white issue. Why doesn’t the
California department responsible for testing these mandatory guidelines just go and test the products being sold in its
stores and confirm one side or the other?


To me this whole thing doesn’t require on-going back and forth and people auguring about a fact that should be easily
proven one way or another.


Whose testing method is right? The State of California who issued the requirement should test it according to how
they wrote the statute and settle these claims once and for all. Why is this not happening already?

LL's argument is only the core layer in its virgin state (while still in the China factory and prior to mating with
the other layers to make a finished laminate floor) pertains to CARB compliance related to the formaldehyde
PPM restriction of 7PPM. Because the adhesive to mate the other layers also contains formaldehyde which
can leach into the core layer then tests of the core in the US that involve deconstructing the laminate floor are
invalid. Under that logic, why would an air test performed after installation be legally valid? Certainly there are
far more variables that could make the air test less valid that an deconstructed core test. An air test would
also measure emissions from other construction materials in the house that contain formaldehyde. An air
tests can easily be gamed by placing formaldehyde on the floor or near the testing kit: Instant free floor.


12 Mar 2015, 07:08 PM


biffster7199
@ Searing: I would suggest that is what they are in the process of doing right now- no need for them to go off
"half -cocked". If this is the case, wait until CARB issues an order requiring LL to remove all their affected
products from their shelves in Cali.


One final thought: If you have been caught "red-handed" some might suggest that it would be better to appear
to be stupid/incompetent (oops "our bad" we were doing the testing wrong -but were acting in good faith)
rather than outright crooked .


JUST SPECULATION BY ME! I'm not accusing anyone or anything of wrong doing or incompetence


13 Mar 2015, 01:13 AM

BTW: Hopefully LL's attorneys won't be using the argument/defense that CARB's testing procedures are
"vague" and subject to interpretation - kinda like arguing what the definition of "is" is IMO.

Whitney: I hope that's not a glass of wine in front of you in the following photo from Business Insider:


http://read.bi/1b1rHSZ


Alcohol is a known carcinogen while the EPA classifies formaldehyde as a probable carcinogen. The EPA's definition
of "probable carcinogen" means that there is limited evidence that it can cause cancer in humans, but at present it is
not conclusive. Note also that alcoholic beverages may contain formaldehyde.


12 Mar 2015, 03:35 PM

I think the difference is that Whitney didn't sell wine while telling his customers that it didn't have alcohol in it.

I'd like to see your references for this. Based on the IRIS system, formaldehyde is a B1: probable carcinogen
but is under review. http://1.usa.gov/18EABUJ


According to the HHS, formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and there is an OSHA requirement limiting
exposure to 0.75ppm. http://1.usa.gov/18EAEja


Ethanol is a probable carcinogen via its metabolite, Acetaldehyde http://1.usa.gov/18EAEjb but I couldn't
readily find a specific finding for ethanol.

Actually formaldehyde is converted into formalin in the liquid state. When formalin enters the air from wine,
only then does it becomeformaldehyde and there isa permissible level for that too. Formalin consumed in
liquid formis water soluble and excreted completely in the urine. Formaldehyde that isbreathed into the lungs
unfortunately stays in the lungs. Factory workersexposed to high levels of formaldehyde have a higher
incidence of solid tumorand blood cancers and other health problems including asthma and COPD. If
yourinfant crawled all over a laminate floor made in China and developed asthma, itwould be too late to use
LL's air test. The damage has already been done andlawyers will be litigating this years after LL's files for
bankruptcy.

Tilson has a long history of hyperbole to get headlines and attention. He seems to be more comfortable being a writer
than an investor. He sells newsletters and conferences but his fund has languished over the decade. Do you
remember his mutual funds? What happened to them?


Do you remember when he said CALL was the next netflix? Probably lost a lot of mom and pops some money, then
low and behold a yr later it's a very small position. Never talks about it much. Same for SODA, that was supposed to
be a double, instead it went down over 50%, again not even a top 12 position a year later.


Do your own work, stick to good companies and stay away from the hyperbole and quick buck artists.


I just don't get why he still gets so much attention from the media and investors. Very strange.

What's worse 'LL formaldehyde problem or millions of Americans still alive above age 112 according to Social
Security records and many over age 112 still active in labor force. 
Millions over age 112 have Social Security numbers 
Thousands of workers over the age of 100 applied to verify their employment eligibility through the U.S. government
in recent years. 
It’s not a trend toward an older workforce, but a sign of identity fraud, according to federal auditors. 
A recent watchdog review found that at least 6.5 million active Social Security numbers belong to people who are at
least 112 years old and likely deceased. 
But only 35 known living individuals worldwide had reached that age as of October 2013, according to the
Gerontology Research Group.

While formaldehyde may be a less serious carcinogen, given that it is classified as only a "probable carcinogen" by
the EPA and it is found in many household products. The CARB law in relation to formaldehyde is still in existence. As
ridiculous as it may be, companies must still follow it. In addition, you can not market your product as being CARB
complaint if it is not actually so. Even though there haven't been reports of homeowners getting sick from their
flooring, lumber liquidators still used deceptive marketing by stamping their boxes as being CARB compliant when in
fact they were not. CONCLUSION: while homeowners may not be at a serious health risk from their flooring, Lumber
Liquidators did engage in deceptive marketing. They probably won't be liable to rip up installed flooring, but they may
be fined significant punitive damages for deceptive marketing.

It is sad that one will not give up even though he has proven to wrong. Formaldehyde although is huge doses and
continuous exposure might be a carcinogen it is not a problem in the LL or any other laminate floor manufacturer. If
formaldehyde was such a problem in the factories in China, then we would have seen them cough, and choke and
sneeze, and we did not see that. I wonder if anyone noticed that the people on the manufacturing floor in China were
able to breath and speak normal. It is a miracle.


The only liability LL has IMO is to be able to bring the customers that were scared off with no reason, back. All these
lawsuits and investigations are nothing more than grandstanding. OSHA and EPA already do not agree with CARB
and OSHA has limit over 13 times CARB's number.  
CARB issued a bulletin 3 days after the story ran not to endorse it but rather to put it into perspective and tell people
that they should not be removing their flooring as the first step.


There should be a law against people that cause mass hysteria specially when they profit from it.

"In 1987, OSHA established a Federal standard that reduced the amount of formaldehyde to which workers
can be exposed over an 8-hour workday from 3 ppm to 1 ppm. In May 1992, the standard was amended, and
the formaldehyde exposure limit was further reduced to 0.75 ppm." - http://1.usa.gov/18EAEja

balert2
You don't understand what the government has done concerning formaldehyde. The government is aware
many products contain formaldehyde, a chemical on the list of proven carcinogens and also an etiology for
other health problems like asthma. Because many products contain formaldehyde (like other construction
materials) the government has set a total permissible amount and then broke it down by all the products so
the number stays below the permissible level of 750 PPM. The Laminate floors are allowed to contain 7 PPM.
Some of the flooring from China contained 2,000 PPM according to the 60 min broadcast. That would clearly
be hazardous to the health of an adult and even more hazardous to a infant crawling on the floor. There
should be mass hysteria my friend.


12 Mar 2015, 07:41 PM

One correction to the above posting. Formaldehyde is immediately dangerous to life and health at 20 ppm.
When you say "750 ppm" you are referring to ppb.


12 Mar 2015, 09:40 PM


DenaliOcean
From your perspective, how do you know the formaldehyde emission from the Chinese floorboards is not a
problem? Have you been to a Chinese factory that uses formaldehyde? I have not personally, but someone I
told my experience with Chinese floorboards to, says they have, and their eyes were watering from the
formaldehyde levels. They saw women working in there and they were appalled at the poor working
environment which is being allowed. Do you know that China has the fastest growing rate of cancer in the
world? Do know that Chinese hospitals are full of cancer cases?


60 minutes provided very little footage of what goes on within those Chinese factories and those specific
spots were spacious and probably had good ventilation rates. 60 Minutes also did not show you the actual
physical suffering, me and others have/are going through with exposure to these Chinese floorboards. They
did not show that so they can focus in on the science and the regulations so not to scare people.


Proof of the harm the formaldehyde causes from Chinese MDF/HDF floorboards: 
http://bit.ly/1EEuGNt


California Air Resources Board being a government agency is going to be very cautious with what they say to
the public. They understand whether or not there will be a problem from Chinese floorboards being sold by
Lumber Liquidators, depends upon the age of the boards, the ventilation rate of the home, the quantity of the
floorboards, how high above the CARB phase 2 level they are, and other factors. There is a very good reason
why they have established the formaldehyde standard that they have. It is not too tight of a standard.

OSHA only sets a short-term exposure level for a work environment. If you had .75 ppm in your house, you
would not be able to tolerate it. To see what a .22 ppm level does, watch this video: 
http://bit.ly/1AhWjUW


In this video video: 
http://bit.ly/1AhWjV4


Notice how they mentioned floorboards as being the source of formaldehyde! Probably from China.


And also when it comes to the age of the boards, my floorboards were manufactured August 2013 and
installed in my home August 2014 and were removed in September 2014 because of the serious respiratory
and neurologic effects they had on me. So they were a year old but still offgassing severely. I had no idea
they were from China and I had no idea they contained formaldehyde. If I knew one of these, they would
never have been bought.


My research has shown, the risk of someone getting cancer is relatively low, but that is not the main issue
here. When formaldehyde levels are elevated and with ongoing exposure, it causes respiratory and
neurologic effects. And can permanently harm babies and children.


The floorboards I got were not supplied by Lumber Liquidators but did come from China. So they had the
same origin. And they most definitely are not compliant with any formaldehyde regulation.

"LL used deceptive marketing by stamping their boxes as being CARB compliant when in fact they were not."


Deceptive marketing? Until 60 Minutes sensationalized the story, the rare consumers who even saw the CARB stamp
on the boxes probably thought it was a puzzling reference to Carbohydrates. How many consumers install their own
laminate floors? In California, the only place where the CARB regulations are law, most of the installers speak English
as a second language.


The only people who ever notice regulatory stamps like that are the occasional hypochondriac, tort lawyer, and
government bureaucrat.


Can you cite several of the many regulatory warnings on the documentation that was provided in your last television
purchase?


I didn't think so.


12 Mar 2015, 05:12 PM


Mile_High_Profits
Yeah, try the Energy Star rating that is on thousands of appliances. Or just about half the other electronic and
building products that have a UL listing or stamp. And generally, the consumer doesn't have a clue, but it's up
to the distribution networks, wholesaler's and importing companies to have checks and balances in place to
prevent this.

"Formaldehyde is used to preserve dead things........not living things!"


Sigh....Another person who doesn't understand biochemistry:


Formaldehyde is produced naturally in the human body. It is essential for the production of some basic
biological materials, such as certain amino acids. Amino acids are necessary for important life processes as
they are the building blocks of proteins in the body.

There are many acceptable methods. Just because someone prefers one over the other doesn't disqualify it.


The industry is trying to get CARB to use tests that will allow more product to pass. Understandable, but that

Great "catch" Reel Ken! No doubt this news release was a MAJOR contributing factor to Friday's 15%+

BTW piggysun's comment: "With years of training,I believe I know better how to meet regulations...." is, no
doubt, a product liability attorney's wet dream with the sheer arrogance it displays. I can only imagine if such
a comment was made by a witness for the defense, as to the jury's reaction (hint: Not good) ;)


14 Mar 2015, 09:28 PM

You're right that the CARB regulations are only law in California. However, from what I understand all boxes were
being sold with the CARB stamp, even in other states. If you say it is California CARB compliant on your boxes it must
be, even if those boxes are sold in other states than California. You're also right that most consumers probably didn't
know what CARB certification stand for, but there's no way to quantify how many did or didn't. However, lawyers could
argue that those regulatory stamps provide a way for concerned and cautious consumers to research a product
before they decide to make a purchase. When companies like LL abuse and fraudulently depict a regulatory safety
stamp that they did not earn or qualify for it destroys consumers ability to identify safe products. Essentially it
devalues or discredits the CARB stamp. Thus because they included a regulatory stamp that is associated with
products that meet a certain standard, they attempted to convince consumers their product also met those standards
(when they didn't). This is known as deceptive marketing.

No deceptive marketing is marketing a product under false circumstances. Marketing is defined as promotional
efforts; no promotional efforts made hence no marketing

If a product made in China displays a stamp that it is made to a certain standard (CARB) and it is cheaper to
make and sold cheaper than American made products that meet that standard, that is unfair trade practices
and illegal in every state and has nothing to do with marketing.

12 Mar 2015, 08:14 PM

I don't mean to keep repeating my opinion here, but in response to WIIFM. Someone could make the argument that
LL did market their product under false circumstances, because they sold their product as having been compliant with
CARB standards when it wasn't (this is a false circumstance). Also, the CARB stamp on the box is considered a
promotional effort. I admit it is a somewhat discrete promotional effort, but the CARB stamp still acted as a promotion.


12 Mar 2015, 08:00 PM

What everyone is missing here is that the products are CARB compliant. So, there is no false marketing claim. The
tests by Tilson are not a part of CARB compliance. Mr. Tilson side-steps this issue, but the CARB compliance
requirements in no way include deconstructive testing.


Here is a link to the final regulations. Deconstructive test will not be found anywhere here because it is used as a
"rough" measure to investigate further. Not conclusive. Arb, the CA agency in charge of CARB, has know about this
issue for over two years now--and no statements on non-compliance....


Tilson is just wrong--instead of getting a lab to test the results, he should have hired a law firm to actually read the
statute....

It seems even Whitney can be trapped by the Red Herring.


It doesn't matter for this issue whether or nor formaldehyde is harmful or to what extent or if other things are or should
be harmful. As I said, it is just a Red Herring ... a cleverly crafted diversionary tactic to get off the real issue.


The issue is, very simply ....


1) Have products been mislabeled to feign compliance, 
2) If so, was LL aware of mislabeling, 
3) If so, was LL complicit in the mislabeling 
4) If not, were they aware and failed to act*


Having watched the Watergate investigation when it was conducted, I'm reminded of the often repeated interrogatory
...... "what did you know and when did you know it"?


If LL is involved in deliberate mislabeling of product or trying to cover it up, nothing else matters.


Now, the longs and shorts can plead their respective case and some will lose and some will win ... maybe different
sides at different times. But until subpoenas are issued and testimony is taken under oath, everything is just a guess.


* It is documented that LL first knew about this at least as early as June 2013. It seems that they just swept it under
the rug (or floor, if you like puns) until now, when they could no longer ignore it.

Who is Whitney Tilson anyway? Take a look at his past posts on Seeking Alpha. He famously shorted Netflix
asserting an outdated business model and the stock rose to $300. He shorted Green Mountain Coffee and is long
SODA, both big losers. Yes he has a few good shorts that he has written about but it appears to be one in three and
yet he writes some emphatically about the demise of each being so certain. Just look what he wrote about Google per

When Google had its IPO in 2004, Tilson famously said in 2004 Motley Fool article, "Google with the same market
cap of McDonald's (a stock I own)?! HA! I believe that it is virtually certain that Google's stock will be highly
disappointing to investors foolish enough to participate in its overhyped offering -- you can hold me to that."[7] Note:

This really has nothing to do with Whitney Tilson for that matter going forward. If he closed his position, the situation

Bottom line is, HD and LOW both passed, why did LL not pass?


How do you test for this? I think enough experts have already come out and verified. Its a pretty basic question and a
simple answer was given.

Frank--please read the 60 minutes piece again. 60 Minutes did not test Home Depot and Lowe's products.
Those tests were done by the class action attorneys. It is almost journalistic stupidity that 60 Minutes did not
test HD and Lowe's products, but they didn't. So, there you have it.


Why didn't test those products. My assumption is that if they did (and maybe they did, but didn't include those
results), they would have found the same issues--which would have pointed to an issue with the
"deconstructive test" not with legal compliance. And, that my friend, is not a very good story...


12 Mar 2015, 09:41 PM


FrankArabia
You're indeed correct in that 60mins didn't test all three. However, the question remains? why didn't those
other companies fail the test when lawyers did it? perhaps they were bribed and paid off?


Today management could have came out and conducted the test and showed the results and countered by
saying either, we all failed or we all passed. But they didn't.


What would a guilty company do?

purposes, and we know of no further action that has been taken by CARB with respect to our products or the
suppliers and manufacturers that provided these products to us. Deconstructive testing is controversial for many
reasons. Several industry groups have outlined specific problems with the testing process and you can find links to
their statements on our Web site."

I think it is pretty sad that they "lawyered up" by not taking questions. Lumber Liquidators seems to be going the
Nixon route of stonewalling. Why not announce an immediate end to sourcing Chinese made laminate?


Probably because they know that would kill their margins. Profits over people!

60 Minutes didn't take questions either. 
Tilson doesn't answer to anyone comments on SA, so he don't take questions. 
Whereas mgt had good reason not to answer questions, bc questions can be asked in a way to create even more
fear, like simply using words in the question like asbest0s, rad0n, etc....


The promotashorts didn't read the SOP for finished goods testing, this continues to go unrecognized by themselves,
and the market. When this is understood, the market will take it out of the hides of those who promoted incorrect
information.


There is no substance to this article, it's strictly fear-mongering. The company presented its method of testing and
compliance, and it has obeyed the laws to the strictest sense. When they say "we will never intentionally harm our
customers" this should be enough. If there is a suggestion on how better to inspect their products for safety, the
company seems to be open to hearing about it. They have stated flatly they have complied with all the regulations,
and gone further in testing to ensure their product is safe.


There are no casualties of this fear-mongering campaign by promotashorts and mediamongers, except the innocent.
This seems to be typical, good guys lose, bad guys win.

Hi tmick,

It seems like a lot of people want to believe in the "under dog" (LL), and believe they are innocent based on this merit
alone. If you look at the facts though it's pretty clear they failed to meet regulatory standards, whether you believe in
the legitimacy of these standards or not is irrelevant. All that matters is they didn't meet CARB standards. While this
may prove to be an excellent buying opportunity, it may also be equivalent to buying an asbestos or tobacco company
on their way down. In conclusion, do not believe this company is innocent only by bringing into question the legitimacy
of 60 minutes based upon their past reports. They did their jobs in reporting the facts, it's up to the individual investor
to apply them to this case.

...but they do comply with current CARB standards. Current CARB standards are not based on deconstructive
tests, which is the only way to get a high reading of formaldehyde. Current CARB compliance testing is core
sampling. Same with the EPA. So LL has done nothing wrong. Until CARB adopts deconstructive testing as
the standard for their regulatory testing LL is in the clear and this is where 60 minutes and the lawyers
mislead everyone by not making this point perfectly clear.

of the outer laminates and finishes by planers or sanders to expose the substrate. This type of testing is not
required by CARB to demonstrate compliance. CARB has used this approach as a “rough” screening method,
but the procedure is not part of the regulation nor has it been adopted by ASTM or other consensus
standards bodies. The deconstructive method is “rough” because the process can fundamentally change the
emission properties of the panel substrate. It should only be used by professionals who understand its use
and limitations.


CARB now has under consideration a proposal that would test laminated panels without removing the
laminate, using well-established and vetted test methods. We support the use of this technique."

Statement on Deconstructive Testing: 
"When Does CARB Use Deconstructive Testing? 
In their Frequently Asked Questions, CARB states that the SOP is used as part of its enforcement evaluation
as a tool ‘to determine’ if further investigation may be required. It is critical that CARB only use deconstructive
testing as a potential ‘screening tool’ and rely on the established chain of custody regulatory requirements to
verify compliance.

jakurtz,


I think I'm still unclear on this. When CARB tests a floor, how do they test it?


14 Mar 2015, 06:44 AM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi Nube,


I hope you don't mind if I jump in.


There are many different methods to test flooring.


Here's CARBs "approved list" of methods http://bit.ly/1x3dM8Q


Deconstrucive testing is one of the methods that can be employed.


Now, there is some controversy as to what method is the one that should be primarily instituted. Deconstructive
testing seems to have a higher fail rate than the "industry" wants. They claim "variable results" ... which, when you get
down to it, means that they prefer to use tests that show less emissions.


Some of these alternate tests are based upon average emissions over the expected life of the product. So, if it is too
high now, using, say, deconstructive testing, in 10 years it will have bled so much emissions that it will be below limits

and if one averages the expected results it is a pass NOW. You be the judge.


So, as one would expect with any industry and any gov't regulatory body, the industry has been pushing to do away
with testing that will fail more product. The same game goes on with every industry that is polluting our environment
as they try to get away with more and more.


I don't know what the best method is and wouldn't hazard a guess.


What CARB does now, having found a failure rate using deconstructing is to conduct other tests. They will then weigh
whatever tests in whatever way they deem appropriate and make any recommendations that they think are
warranted.


Meanwhile, what is abundantly clear is that Tilson, et al, were within accepted methodology in reaching their
conclusion and may be effectively insulated from legal attack.

"Meanwhile, what is abundantly clear is that Tilson, et al, were within accepted methodology in reaching their

Im not so sure but I will say LL has a pretty decent case for defamation and libel here. CARB admits deconstructive
testing is a "screening method" for further testing and that they do NOT require passing deconstructive testing to be
CARB compliant. 60 Minutes, Tilson et al have clearly and purposefully misled the public into believing LL wrongly
labeled their product CARB compliant. Tilson might want to go ahead and lawyer up.


It is abundantly clear the accepted testing method is being debated by the industry for future specifications, as is
always the case. It is also abundantly clear current and past ACCEPTED testing methods for CARB compliance
DOES NOT include deconstructive testing.


14 Mar 2015, 07:14 AM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi jakurz,


You're off base on your defamation.


Tilson accurately reported his test results. He accurately reported what the factory confirmed.

Regardless of the level of the health hazard, which can be debated, the company got caught with its pants down.
Sourcing inferior Chinese junk to boost margins at the expense of their customers health is shameful. Any good CEO
would see the existential threat here and immediately announce a plan to "cease and desist" with their deals with
Chinese factories, and bring production either back onshore or at least to a country with a better reputation.


The CEO's refusal to do this is a huge gamble with the company's continued existence as a going concern now on the
table.


This is potentially a "short to zero" scenario.

Monster drinks were giving people heart attacks...for real. MNST price went from 76-45 now at 125. LL's floors might
emit a little more formaldehyde than california likes when destroyed in an non-industry accepted testing method. The
chemical is found everywhere in the air we breath naturally. Stock has gone from 108-28... go ahead, increase your
short position.


14 Mar 2015, 08:58 AM


Nubevestor
While I'm not convinced this wouldn't be a good place to pick up some LL, I'm also not sure MNST is an
accurate analogy.


Monster, at least to my knowledge, didn't have effectively different ingredients than other brand energy drinks
whereas it looks like LL's private label laminate did have more formaldehyde than it's competitors.


14 Mar 2015, 09:04 AM


jakurtz
So people getting heart attacks from misusing a drink is not so bad because that drink is the same as
everyone else's drink. But a product to have no known adverse health effects is much worse because it is
made with cheaper glue.


Both on the outset faced major reputational damages (I would argue heart attacks is worse) one has
completely recovered and then some and the other lost 50% more market value. Short-side reward at this
point is a stock price of $20 maybe six months to a year from now, long side reward is $50 over the next
month. If LL manages to spin this into a marketing boom through customer awareness and a new message it
could be a lot more. A small spec bet on the upside could become rather large.

14 Mar 2015, 09:41 AM

You were unsure of the analogy based on the ingredients used. I am stating the analogy works more in LLs
favor based on the much more dire consequences from mis-using monster's product. Heart attacks dragged
MNST down reputationally but people/investors/media are treating LL as far worse than a company that sold
a product that knowingly gave teenagers heart attacks. I will ask more directly, which company and by
association, stock price, should have had more "reputational" damage?


14 Mar 2015, 10:46 AM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi jakurtz,


Reputational damage is most largely attributed to the how the situation is handled than the severity of the
problem.


Why don't you do some research on Tylenol and Audi?


Throw in Andy Petit and A-Rod, for some contrast.


Don't forget Lance Armstrong and Magic Johnson.


14 Mar 2015, 10:56 AM

I agree with you Ken. So, lets cut to the chase. The largest reputational damage comes to those companies
that deal in Chinese made products. That is the real reason LL is being annihilated. Throw in a strong,
soaring dollar and any company that buys from China and sells domestically is going to rock. Well, Tilson and
big box store competitors can not have that, so start digging for a reason why LL should never again buy from
China and try to their market against them through the media that will happily pick up the story line "Chinese
Made Product Toxic" (if you light it on fire and sand it and snort up the dust like coke) its an oldy but goody
and often times true, so no doubt it will work.

Hi jakurtz,


People need to see a connection between the accused and the crime.


A scapegoat, in this case China, furthers that end.


But what they want to see most, is someone taking responsibility for their actions.

perceived as the bigger crime.


15 Mar 2015, 08:09 AM


Reel Ken, Contributor
Hi jakurtz,


Eventually LLs stock price will reflect its earnings. Everything else is just temporary noise and positioning.


Problem for LL is several-fold...


1) They face numerous lawsuits which will be a drain on earnings. They are mostly class action suits which are
designed to exert a defense expense toll.


2) Compliance with government inquisitions can be very costly, further draining earnings


3) There has been some migration of customers. If competitors continue to seize this opportunity there will be a
further drain on earnings.


4) If there was deliberate factory mislabeling, well, multiple all the above by a significant factor


5) As the end of 1Q approaches, fund managers like to "prune" holdings and own winners and dump losers to make
them look good. I can't imagine a manager too happy about showing a holding in LL, when they often are most
interested in CYA ownership. The stock will be under pressure for the next few weeks.


For all these reasons, and more, LL is not an investable stock. That doesn't mean it's not a "betting" stock ... sure is ...
plenty of people will be placing bets.


So if it makes you feel better to crow and dare shorts, by all means .. go ahead. You may have your day, but so will
they.

If LL wants to do the right thing, they should acknowledge the problem, remove the tainted product and take

The test kits are a joke. Testing for formaldehyde requires a controlled environment and trained technicians. It is not a
DIY project.


Anyway, at least five CERTIFIED labs have tested positive. So LL discounts that result and opts for DIY on a "kit" that
no one has approved.

Tilson, et al, conducted approved CARB tests and, based upon those tests opined that the product was not

Hi D-Struction,


I believe in shorting, but indexes, not stocks, and as a hedge, not an investment.


I don't like profiteer shorts ... it's just that I think it's easy to make money on either side and healthier to put one's
money in something worthwhile.


I grew up when one rooted for their team, and it was considered crass to root against the opposition. Today people
are glad when the opposition loses its best player to an injury. Rooting for someone's failure is not how I think
someone should live.


I just can't understand why someone looks to profit from another's bad fortune. It's the reverse of charity. Worse yet, is
that the profiteer shorts play an active role in accelerating or causing the failure. Guess I'm old fashioned.
