7/7/2019 Cool Holdings (AWSM): The $16 Million Question – Street


thestreetsweeper.org/cool-holdings-awsm-the-16-million-question/ 2/6


Um, Cool Holdings (AWSM), we’ve got a question. 
Why in the world did you pay $16 million for some cellphones and a mountain of debt?? 
Flash back to October 1, 2017, and we see a key rollup that formed the foundation of Miami, Flori
computer retail business: Cool rolled up two OneClick companies, ultimately paying $16 million 
What did Cool get out of the deal? 
Cellphones and other inventory totaled … wait for it … 
Wait for it … $2 million. That’s right. Only $2 million in inventory. 
“Hey folks,” Cool essentially said to investors, “we plunked down EIGHT times our acquisitions’ inv
in us!” 
Let’s look more closely at the acquired companies’ overall assets. Most assets fell into the categ
parties”… a whopping $7 million. 
If we were buying “Have I Gotta Deal For You, Inc.,” would we really want to see the majority of a
not pay us, plus anticipated money from buddies of Have I Gotta Deal? 
In our chart below, we break down the financials. 
Top Costs To Cool 
lowest to highest 


(Sources: Company SEC filings, TheStreetSweeper (By the numbers: Combined notes totaled $3
$.8m); $12.8m + $3.3m = $16m) 
(Inventory totaled $1.7m + $0.3m = $2 m); (Receivables & due from related parties $6.36 m + $.27
Consider the second biggest cost: the pulled-out-of-the-air figure of “goodwill.” Goodwill is com
relations, employee relations and other stuff, used to justify the acquisition when they’ve paid a
“goodwill.” 
Meanwhile, Cool’s own filings say they bought just $4.1 million in assets. 
If you subtract goodwill, we see the assets add up to a negative … $-1.77 million. 
So, Cool paid $16 million for worthless, debt-ridden companies?

thestreetsweeper.org/cool-holdings-awsm-the-16-million-question/ 3/6


Why, oh, why would Cool pay so much for so little? 
The secret’s in their boring filings … 
*COOL’S SECRET: THEY’RE US! 
Cool paid dearly to acquire companies owned by whom??? 
Cool management owned both acquisitions, filings show…

At the end of 2016, the company’s consolidated losses had hit $-4.4 million. 
Today, Cool continues to lose money. Last quarter alone, the company’s nine stores lost $3.6 m

They cleaned up a mess. 
Then Cool paid $415,000 for a promotional campaign – actually claiming expansion and great

Sure, these folks cleaned up their mess. 
But they threw it onto the backs of today’s stockholders. 
Now, Cool has a $25 million stock registration looming with the potential to water down the sh

We’ve asked Cool to explain, among other issues: How do you justify these actions? How do you
justify the coming decimation of the little guys? 
*MASSIVE PROBLEM 
Cool stock has rocketed on bought-and-paid-for promotions implying the company will expan
years and become wildly successful and profitable. 
But there’s a glaring problem with Cool’s implication. 
If you lose money on nine stores, how do you make money on 200 stores? 
You don’t.


*CONCLUSION
