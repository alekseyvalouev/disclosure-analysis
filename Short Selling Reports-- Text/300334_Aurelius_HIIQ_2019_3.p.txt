We terminated that business [Dorfman] and we still have
record third party sales. That should be very reassuring
to everybody.

7/10/2019 HIIQ: New FTC Revelations Contradict Management’s Assertions - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/hiiq-new-ftc-revelations-contradict-managements-assertions/ 2/5


You should assume that as of the publication date of his reports and
research, Aurelius and possibly any companies a�liated with him
and their members, partners, employees, consultants, clients and/or
investors (the “Aurelius A�liates”) have a short position in the stock
(and/or options, swaps, and other derivatives related to the stock)
and bonds of Health Insurance Innovations. They therefore stand to
realize signi�cant gains in the event that the prices of either equity or
debt securities of Health Insurance Innovations decline.  Aurelius
and the Aurelius A�liates intend to continue transactions in the
securities of Health Insurance Innovations for an inde�nite period
after his �rst report on a subject company at any time hereafter
regardless of initial position and the views stated in Aurelius’
research.  Aurelius will not update any report or information on this
website to re�ect such positions or changes in such positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius
A�liates” are not in any way associated with Aurelius Capital
Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and
any a�liates of or funds managed by the latter company.


We are short Health Insurance Innovations (NASDAQ: HIIQ).


A recent court �ling made by the Federal Trade Commission reveals
that HIIQ has continued to charge consumers millions of dollars for
thousands of “virtually worthless insurance products” issued by HIIQ
to families who the FTC says were defrauded by boiler rooms run by
Steve Dorfman’s Simple Health companies. We believe these new
documents contradict management’s assertions and suggest the
company is still harvesting cash from the victims of a giant alleged
fraud. We therefore believe that HIIQ may have juiced its recently
released �nancials by booking millions in revenue from policies
fraudulently sold by Dorfman, even after HIIQ management told
investors that the company had terminated this relationship.


In documents �led on March 18 , the FTC states that “thousands of
Dorfman’s victims continue to be charged each month by the third-
party administrator that issued Defendants’ virtually worthless
insurance products”. The FTC now speci�cally names Health
Insurance Innovations as the administrator and states that “HII
continues to charge consumers despite the TRO [Temporary

Restraining Order]. From December 2018 through February 2019, HII
has charged consumers 165,798 times, totaling approximately $14.6
million”.


Source: Selections from FTC court �ling. A declaration by an FTC investigator


(here) states that this total is based on spreadsheets HIIQ’s counsel turned


over to the receiver and includes additional commissions owed to Dorfman. It


is unclear to us if the spreadsheets includes collections on policies sold by


Dorfman’s downline of brokers and a�liates.


In a press release issued on November 2 , HIIQ claimed it “had
immediately suspended our relationship with Simple Health” and
declared that “HIIQ does not expect a negative �nancial impact
relative to the company’s recently issued guidance”. As explained in
our initial report last year, we found this statement puzzling because
documents clearly show that Dorfman was a major distributor of
HIIQ policies, with HIIQ making more than $145 million in cash
payments to Dorfman’s companies since 2015. But HIIQ apparently
mitigated the �nancial impact of Dorfman’s termination by
continuing to charge thousands of consumers who the FTC says
were defrauded and “likely do not even know they are essentially
uninsured and thus are at risk for incurring crippling medical debt
due to serious illness or hospitalization”.


This all strikes us as highly problematic. Why would HIIQ continue to
bill customers who the government says were defrauded, even after

management told investors it had terminated the relationship with
Dorfman? How could it be appropriate for HIIQ to continue to book
revenues on policies the government says were fraudulently sold and
“virtually worthless”, especially without any corresponding reserve or
disclosure? Could the company have met Wall Street �nancial
targets without continuing to charge these victims?


We note that the FTC’s stated goal is to “stop the fraud and to return
as much money as possible to Dorfman’s victims”. The court
documents suggest the receiver may soon be seeking to address
“the situation with HII’s continued billing of consumers who were
victims”. The FTC also states that “these consumers need to be
noti�ed and given the opportunity to cancel” noting that “it is di�cult
to overstate the devastating and irreparable impact Dorfman’s scam
has had and continues to have on its victims”. It would therefore not
surprise us if the receiver or the FTC move to claw back the entirety
of the monies paid to HIIQ by these consumers. Because HIIQ has
paid more than $145 million in cash to Dorfman since 2015, we
estimate it may have collected more than $240 million dollars from
consumers on policies sold by Dorfman and his a�liates (assuming
a 60% commission rate).


Furthermore, are investors really supposed to believe that Dorfman
is a mere anomaly? How many other brokers have made similar
misrepresentations to consumers when selling HIIQ policies? How
much has HIIQ charged these families?


Because we are not aware of HIIQ disclosing any reserve, provision,
or loss contingency related to policies fraudulently sold by any of its
brokers, we also wonder if the company’s auditors, Grant Thornton,
were fully aware of these details when they signed off on the
company’s audit last week. Importantly, PCAOB Audit Standard 2805

requires the auditor to obtain written representations from
management including:


We note that Grant Thornton expressed an adverse audit opinion of
internal controls in the 10-K �ling, which disclosed a material
weakness related to revenue accounting. Irregularities included “one
customer contract with unique terms that was canceled” and various
errors that “resulted in post-closing adjustments”.


In our opinion, Dorfman is only one player inside a vast ecosystem of
unscrupulous actors who have fueled HIIQ’s sales. We continue to
believe it is now only a matter of when, not if, HIIQ’s business will
implode. We therefore see enormous downside potential.
