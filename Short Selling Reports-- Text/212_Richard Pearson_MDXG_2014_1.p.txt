MiMedx Set For A Continued Plunge
Feb. 7, 2014 9:30 AM ET45 comments
by: Richard Pearson


It appears as if short-biased trades are starting to pay off once again.


My last short article discussed Farmer Brothers Coffee (NASDAQ:FARM) and since that
time, the stock has come off by nearly 20% without much of a bounce. Prior to that, I
discussed Unilife (NASDAQ:UNIS), which is now down by 15-20% for largely the reasons
I predicted. Before that, I highlighted unacknowledged and low-priced product competition
for Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO). At the time, the stock had been trading around
$13.00, and now it has fallen to $9.00. Prior to that, my earnings call on Ignite Restaurant
Group (NASDAQ:IRG) correctly predicted a fall of around 30% in that stock.


But for today, I am focused on an even better near-term short opportunity in MiMedx
Group (NASDAQ:MDXG).


MiMedx - Investment thesis


Shares of MiMedx are likely to see a decline of 30-40% in the near term. The stock
represents an ideal short candidate due to its tremendous free float of nearly 100 million
shares combined with a negligible short interest of just 5.8 million shares. There are also
liquid options which trade on the stock. Institutional ownership is negligible and the CEO is
the only insider with any meaningful ownership of stock.


Yet, these are not the real problems. The real reasons for the sell thesis are as follows:


1. A deeply flawed FDA clinical "study" which was irreparably skewed, providing stellar
(but arguably misleading) results for the EpiFix product


2. Heavy marketing of that same study (by MiMedx and its banker/analysts) despite
superior trials by competing products


3. A complete mis-presentation of the implications of recent Medicare reimbursement
changes


4. Substantial changes in the competitive landscape for skin substitute products


5. Heavy selling by CEO Pete Petit (the largest shareholder) of over $1.2 million

current levels


This report is divided into three sections.


SECTION ONE - Background information provides detailed background information on
the evolving situation at MiMedx, along with several reasons NOT to sell the stock.
Presenting this information first will allow readers to better evaluate the real risks and the
reasons why MiMedx is likely to be facing steep declines in the near future.


SECTION TWO - the red flags illustrates that there are more than ample warning signs
which should presage the upcoming declines. The upcoming declines should come as no
surprise to anyone.


SECTION THREE - the black swans details the much deeper negative catalyst events -
which the mostly retail investor base has almost entirely ignored. Section three is clearly
the most important part of this article. So for those who wish to "skip to the point" -
section three contains the most price-relevant details.


SECTION ONE: Background information


With over 100 million shares outstanding, MiMedx currently has a market cap of nearly
$800 million. Yet, with nearly 20 million additional (deep in the money) warrants and
options outstanding, this market cap swells to over $1 billion. Many of these options have
strike prices well below $1.00 and are set to expire in 2014, implying substantial near-term
dilution.


MiMedx generated $40 million in sales over the first 9 months of 2013, resulting in a net
loss of $2.7 million. The company has never generated a profit. The share price has
recently been trading in the $7-8 range and the company currently has just 40 cents per
share in cash (following a $39 million capital raise in December).


MiMedx Products


MiMedx Group describes itself as "an integrated developer, manufacturer and marketer of
regenerative biomaterial products processed from human amniotic membrane." What the
company does is to collect donated human placentas from hospitals via C-Section births.

These placentas would otherwise be discarded as medical waste. MiMedx then
uses/processes these placentas into a type of healing application for burns and wounds.


The company's two main products are EpiFix and AmnioFix. EpiFix can basically be
viewed as an enhanced skin patch for use on external burns, wounds and ulcers.
AmnioFix serves a similar function but is for internal use in sports medicine and surgeries,
including spinals and tennis elbow.


On October 1st, the company announced that it had signed a distribution agreement with
Medtronic to provide its allografts for distribution via Medtronic's SpinalGraft Technologies
("SGT") subsidiary. Terms were not disclosed.


These products are not FDA-approved via clinical trials, but instead have been governed
under HCT/P regulations ("Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based
Products") which allow marketing of products which have been minimally manipulated
(among other criteria). These products are regulated under Section 361 of the PHS Act.


MiMedx Share Price Performance


Over the past two years, share price performance at MiMedx has been stellar. At their
recent peak, the shares had risen from just over a $1.00 to just shy of $9.00. However,
there is a very high likelihood of a 30-40% decline in MiMedx in the near future, to a
price of around $4-5. Yet, the market has almost entirely missed the real reasons
why.

Two possible "red herrings" - NOT the reasons to sell


Again, for clarity, the following two issues are quite well-known and have been absorbed
by the market. They are just presented for completeness.


During the end of 2013, a number of headline concerns caused the stock to exhibit
substantial volatility. In September, panic over an FDA "untitled letter" following an
inspection at the company's Marietta, Georgia plant sent the stock plunging to as low as
$1.81 in intra-day trading and the stock was halted several times during the day. The FDA
letter stated the MiMedx had violated the Public Health Service Act by improperly
manufacturing and marketing drugs that are also a biological product, but without a valid
biologics license. The good news is that the products (currently) in question only comprise
15% of MiMedx's revenues. The bad news is twofold: First, the company will now likely
have to pursue an expensive FDA approval process and obtain a BLA. Second, even a
minor hit to the financials may have a disproportionate impact on the share price due to
the extremely high price-to-sales multiple and the historical lack of profitability.


So far, MiMedx has said that it does not agree with the FDA and is currently in discussions
on how to proceed. For the time being, this issue has been digested by the market and
does not appear to be a primary concern for investors.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 5/26


A separate issue is the SEC investigation of potential insider trading violations by CEO
Pete Petit in connection with information allegedly shared regarding his company Matria
Healthcare prior to the sale of that company. The headline in the Atlanta Business
Chronicle was short and scary, noting that "SEC Sues Pete Petit, Alleges Fraud".


But the reality is that despite any previous violations, this investigation is unlikely to impact
the specific financials at MiMedx. The downside scenario would be limited to the potential
loss of Mr. Petit's management involvement if he were forced to step down, and some
possible pressure on the share price simply due to more negative headlines. As with the
FDA impact above, this issue is not a primary reason to sell the stock, but the impact
could be disproportionately large simply due to the very lofty multiple upon which MiMedx
trades.


SECTION TWO: The red flags and warnings


One major problem at MiMedx is that as these (mostly retail) investors have gotten
comfortable (desensitized) with the scary headlines, they have also overlooked a number
of very real problems.


In November and December, MiMedx released a series of very bullish press releases
which helped to bolster the stock. These items were then amplified by sell-side analysts
(who happen to be the investment bankers for MiMedx).

The share price continued to skyrocket on the back of their analysis and steep price
upgrades. Within the space of a few weeks, Canaccord repeatedly boosted their target on
the stock. In early November, when the stock was in the $5s, Canaccord told us it was a
$6.50 stock. But as the much anticipated equity offering drew nearer, Canaccord nearly
doubled the target to $12.00 in December. The basis for such a dramatic hike seems
unclear. This increase implies an increase in market cap of nearly $600 million for MiMedx
even though Canaccord only increased its 2014 revenue estimates for MiMedx by a mere
$27 million. But as would be expected, the share price soared as shown above.


Not surprisingly, Canaccord was appointed bookrunner on MiMedx's $39 million equity
offering in December. Canaccord reaped millions in fees. Small cap investment bank
Craig Hallum only had a $9 target on the stock, so they were only awarded joint lead
status on the offering, making perhaps under $1 million in fees. But certainly, their $9.00
target did imply a 50% rise in the share price vs. its then prevailing level of around $6.00.


But wait. It gets better.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 7/26


Shortly after the company sold $39 million in stock, CEO Pete Petit sold over $1.2 million
in stock from his personal holdings. MiMedx's largest shareholder (ADEC Private Equity)
then reduced its holding to just below 4.99% of the company - allowing further sales
(including a complete liquidation) to go without any need to report the sales. This is a very
standard "stealth liquidation" technique.


And just as all of this was happening, we started to get the first analyst downgrades on the
stock from Northland Securities with a $6.00 target. It should come as no surprise to
anyone that the only bank to have the guts to downgrade the stock is the one who wasn't
being paid investment banking fees.


Despite the lofty targets from the research analysts (a.k.a. bankers), the company, the
management and the largest holder were all suddenly eager to sell. But why?


From the Northland report:


Key Points


Our downgrade is a valuation call. Irrespective of how Q4 numbers shape up or how
aggressive fiscal 2014 guidance is provided, we cannot reconcile current valuation
with the ground fundamentals.
In our opinion, we are entering a vicious cycle of CMS constantly squeezing out the
marginal dollar from skin substitute reimbursement. For Mimedx, the current payment
levels for Q-code reimbursement for EpiFix are "temporary" in nature. Once bundled
rates come into effect, the playing field will be leveled. While EpiFix has favorable
MAC coverage policies, that seems to be baked into the stock.
… However, our general impression of the tissue space has always been that most
products are undifferentiated and suffer from a lack of rigorous randomized trials.
Hence, aggressive marketing plays a stronger role than true clinical advantages
or disadvantages….


At the bottom of this report, I will illustrate the transparent flaws in the research reports
provided by the other (and far more bullish) sell side analysts who have provided
investment banking services to MiMedx.


SECTION THREE: The black swans


Clearly, there are several issues which at one time spooked the investors in MiMedx,
quickly sending the stock to as low as $1.81 in intraday trading. But even with the various
warning signs that have been presented above, investors are continuing to award MiMedx
a market cap of nearly $800 million to $1 billion.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 8/26


The issues presented here in Section Three are the real issues which could well see the
stock decline by 30-40%. It appears that very few investors are aware of these issues.
Again, MiMedx is a stock which has minimal institutional holdings. The largest institution
reduced its stake below 4.99% in January, such that we do not know if they still are even
holding any shares.


A deeply flawed clinical "study"


The details behind MiMedx's recently published "clinical study" are far more dangerous to
the company's near-term future than are the FDA letter or the insider trading investigation.


In 2013, the International Wound Journal published a study entitled "A prospective
randomised comparative parallel study of amniotic membrane wound graft in the
management of diabetic foot ulcers". This study had been initiated on the FDA's
ClinicalTrials.gov in 2012 and was sponsored by MiMedx.


The purpose of the sponsored study was to see how EpiFix (an amniotic membrane
wound graft) compared to "standard of care" in treating Diabetic Foot Ulcers. These ulcers
often affect the feet of obese diabetic patients. Healing can be impacted by factors such
as age, weight (i.e. pressure on the wound) as well as the size of the wound.


The study concluded that


Patients treated with EpiFix achieved superior healing rates over standard treatment
alone. These results show that using EpiFix in addition to standard care is
efficacious for wound healing.


It also cited an overall healing rate of 92% at 6 weeks.


Not surprisingly, the truly spectacular results from this sponsored study have been widely
repeated and quoted by sell-side analysts/bankers (to investors) and by management
(presumably to doctors and prospective patients).


For example, Lake Street Capital quotes this study and management saying (almost
verbatim)


EpiFix, the company's lead product, heals diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) twice as fast
and three times better than competing alternatives at a lower cost,



http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/iwj.12097/pdf

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 9/26


Clearly, Lake Street didn't bother to read the fine print contained within the study, or they
may have expressed less of such unbridled optimism.


As part of the journal article, there was included a table which illustrated the demographic
details of the clinical study for EpiFix. This table is reproduced in identical form as follows:


Anyone who understands clinical trial design (or even just plain statistics) is likely
now hitting the "sell" button on MiMedx before reading any further.


The implications of this table should be quite obvious.


On average, patients in the EpiFix trial group were 5 years younger. Their wounds were
25% smaller. Their body mass (i.e. obesity) was around 15% less.


In fact, as shown in the table above, the deviations from the mean are even more
significant than the means. With EpiFix, the youngest patient was 15 years younger than
in the SOC group. The lowest body mass was 20% lower. The SOC group had a
maximum wound size that was 20% larger than for the EpiFix group.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 10/26


With such a skewed patient population, it would have been truly stunning if the EpiFix trial
did not produce a spectacular improvement vs. "standard of care" in the older and fatter
people with larger wounds.


It should also be noted that much more reliable results could have been obtained with a
proper trial. The original trial was slated to encompass 80 patients. This is already quite
small, but ultimately the study only included 25 patients, with a mere 13 patients treated
with EpiFix grafts. They then compared the results to a mere 12 patients who happened to
be older, fatter and had larger wounds.


The point is that as studies go, this one should not be viewed as being even remotely
conclusive. It delivered results that should have been 100% expected - and in a population
size that was too small to even matter.


What investors need to understand is this:


As noted above, these amnio products are treated as HCT/P products and as such do not
require clinical trials. So what was the point of this study if it was not to pursue a clinical
trial? The trial design was so faulty that it clearly would not have passed muster if it were
to eventually be used for legitimate clinical trials.


Clearly, it served more of a marketing purpose than a regulatory purpose. The study and a
follow-up has been published and has then been subsequently publicized by MiMedx. In
November, MiMedx stated that


A competitor recently announced that the clinical study of their products showed that
only 52% of their patients both healed in 12 weeks and remained healed at the
subsequent 12 week follow-up. An optimal treatment for DFU would be one that
supports both rapid and long-term healing. With 94.4% of DFUs remaining healed
approximately one year after treatment, we believe our EpiFix® allograft is a
clinically effective and economic solution to these needs.


In January, skin substitute competitor Organogenesis (maker of Alpigraf) announced that it
had acquired the other major competing product (Dermagraft) from Shire
Pharmaceuticals. Together, these two products dominate the market for skin substitutes.


So how do their products compare in terms of clinical data ?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 11/26


For Dermagraft, we can see the that the pivotal study was far larger and more rigorous. It
involved 314 patients in multiple centers (as opposed to the 25 patients in one center for
EpiFix).


The study also noted that


If the study ulcer had not decreased in size by more than 50% during the next 2
weeks and the patient met all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient was
randomized into the study.


In other words, this competing study took the approach of only attempting to test on
patients who had very persistent and resistant diabetic foot ulcers. They deliberately
selected the most challenging patients in an attempt to genuinely see if the treatment
would provide a meaningful benefit. This is as opposed to trying to find the patients who
would quite obviously be healed as quickly as possible. The result is that the blatant
"marketing benefit" is naturally less spectacular.


Likewise, the study for Apligraf included 208 patients, and it is noted that it deliberately
"excluded patients who exhibited rapid healing".


MiMedx management has repeatedly made reference to the "published studies" which
tout its product. Yet, it should be clear from the demographics of the 13 patients who were
treated in a single site that these studies possess predictable marketing value to a much
greater extent than they do scientific rigor.


One might wonder what sort of doctor/scientist would put his name on such a tiny and
skewed study. The name of the lead author was Charles Zelen, and it turns out that he
was the lead author on three of the six "clinical publications" that are listed on MiMedx's
website. The other three were co-authored by Donald E. Fetterolf, who happens to be
chief medical officer at MiMedx. These six studies are the only "clinical publications" listed
on the MiMedx website.


The point is that it is very easy to write a "study" and submit it to a specialized journal such
as the "International Wound Journal" or the "Journal of Wound Care". The study will, of
course, be published. And then companies such as MiMedx get to make simple
statements touting their publication in these journals. It is easy and guaranteed marketing
material, even when it lacks the scientific rigor of legitimate FDA trials.


Why should investors care?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 12/26


The reason to care is that the FDA has already demonstrated that it is cracking down
substantially on inappropriate marketing and other practices by those in the skin substitute
market. We saw this with the FDA untitled letter for MiMedx in September. But (not by
coincidence) we saw the same thing at Osiris (NASDAQ:OSIR) for its own skin substitute.
An FDA untitled letter was issued to Osiris in October, just one month after MiMedx.


Investors can decide for themselves if the claims being made by MiMedx are well-
substantiated given the tiny trial size and the skewed demographics of the participants.
They can also decide for themselves what will be the impact of any decision by the FDA to
require more rigorous and perhaps fully formal trials.


Understanding the new world of Medicare reimbursement


On November 29th, MiMedx put out a press release to announce that "the Company
applauds the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) new methodology for
the reimbursement of skin substitutes" which had been released two days earlier.


There are really only two components of the CMS announcement that need to be
understood.


The first component is the fact that for the remainder of 2014, EpiFix will retain its Pass
Through Status for its third and final year. In effect, the new reimbursement policies will
not affect reimbursement at all for the duration of 2014. EpiFix already had Pass Through
Status for the past two years, and three years is the maximum allowable. This
continuation is indeed moderately favorable for EpiFix, but the duration of only 1 year
means that its impact will naturally be limited. But the market has basically priced in the
scenario that MiMedx is going to have a permanent cost and reimbursement advantage
over its competitors. This has led to inflated expectations for revenues.


In addition, MiMedx was not the only one to receive Pass Through Status. The market
seems to have ignored this as well. Osiris was actually granted an additional two years of
Pass Through Status, even though its product is widely regarded as among the most
inferior of the products on the market. (One key takeaway from this observation is that
Pass Through Status is basically being awarded to products that are simply "new" as
opposed to being actually "better".)


The second component is more complicated - and more important. CMS will now be
introducing a two-tiered reimbursement system, which will dramatically alter the
competitive landscape.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 13/26


Anyone who is contemplating a long or short investment in MiMedx needs to understand
the full details of this new policy adjustment. The text of the November 27th
announcement can be found here at the CMS.gov newsroom and the fuller versions here.


Under the "old" system, reimbursement was calculated as average selling price ("ASP")
+6%. Under the "new" system, reimbursement will be split among two types: high cost and
low cost.


The old system of ASP+6% basically incentivized the market leaders (such as Shire and
Organogenesis) to manufacture one-size-fits-all sheets of skin substitute. As a result, they
produced sheets in standardized sizes (ie. cheaper to manufacture) and in sizes that were
too big (i.e. reimbursed at cost plus, so maximizing revenues). The predictable result was
massive amounts of waste when 40 sq cm of standardized substitute had to be purchased
just to treat a wound that was 2-3 sq cm in size.


Many may find it galling to know that such a system of perverse incentives was in place
and running. These manufacturers were clearly incentivized to only produce their products
in a size that guaranteed substantial overcharging and waste. But we should also be
happy that the once-flawed system has been analyzed and tweaked to reduce product
waste and economic waste. At least the supervisory feedback function has had the
desired effect.


Under the new system, "high-cost products" are those with an ASP of $32/sq cm or
higher. These will be reimbursed at $1,371.19 for up to 100 sq cm of product. Wounds
over 100 sq cm will be reimbursed at a maximum rate of $2,260.


"Low-cost products" are those with an ASP below $32 per sq cm. They will be reimbursed
at a rate of up to a maximum of $409.41 per 100 sq cm of product.


Understanding the competitive response to the CMS changes


Just after the CMS announcement (and - of course - just prior to the equity offering), small
cap investment bank Craig Hallum put out a "quick note" to explain the implications of
these massive changes on MiMedx. The note was just one-page long and noted the
following:



http://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-Sheets/2013-Fact-Sheets-Items/2013-11-27-3.html

https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/HospitalOutpatientPPS/Hospital-Outpatient-Regulations-and-Notices-Items/CMS-1601-FC-.html

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 14/26


The two market leading products, Apligraf® and Dermagraft®, are not offered in a
size-appropriate graft which is the chief reason for $100M in annual wastage
prompting this decision by CMS. Prior to this new regulation, all reimbursement was
set at ASP +6% which is why the competition was able to establish market share in
the first place.


While the final rule paints a slightly better picture for MDXG's competitors, they
will still have to cut prices substantially or file PMA supplements in order to remain a
competitive force in the years ahead. With this new rule, we believe MDXG could
garner an incremental $50M in revenues over the next several years as the
Company establishes a dominant position in the wound care marketplace.


This justification was used to state a $9.00 target (50% above the prevailing price at the
time).


Basically, what Hallum is saying is that the competitors will simply to continue to offer
wrong-sized products at non-competitive prices despite new and different incentives to
offer smaller products at rational prices. Ergo: the Craig Hallum banking client should be
expected to rise by 50% (just in time for the company to raise $39 million in an equity
offering).


This assumption is pure and unadulterated nonsense, and we will soon see that it will not
play out in reality. It was nothing more than an excuse to justify a high share price target
ahead of an equity offering in which Hallum hoped to be well-paid. The competitors will
certainly change their product offerings in order to provide an economically rational (i.e.
size-appropriate) product which will be reimbursed at proper rates accordingly.


Craig Hallum does include a minor mention of these competitors who would enjoy a
"slightly better picture" in its one-page report. But it notes that "Dermagraft" by Shire and
"Apligraft" by Organogenesis are nearly 2-3x as expensive as EpiFix, while they are to be
reimbursed at the same rate.


Craig Hallum ultimately was selected as a lead manager on the equity offering alongside
bookrunner Canacord and pulled in substantial fees a few weeks later, just as the share
price was soaring on the back of upgrades like this.


Looking at past examples - history is repeating itself
5/22/2018 MiMedx Set For A Continued Plunge - MiMedx Group Inc. (NASDAQ:MDXG) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 15/26


Readers who have followed my articles over the past year may remember that I have
repeatedly called out similar research nonsense from Craig Hallum during 2013. Each of
my articles said the same exact thing: over-bullish research calls were preceding
investment banking deals by Hallum clients. The stocks soared, the equity was issued.
Craig Hallum got paid their fees. Then the stocks tumbled.


Past Hallum examples (which I wrote about) included TearLab (NASDAQ:TEAR),
Neonode (NASDAQ:NEON) and Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL). Readers will also remember
that I was proven right about each one of these stocks within either a few days or a few
weeks at most.


From the time I wrote about each of these Hallum stocks, each is now down by at least
20-30% - despite predictions of double-triple digit gains by Craig Hallum.


In each case, these Hallum bull calls came just in time for Hallum to help them issue
stock. Hallum made millions in total fees. In each case, the bullish predictions came
unraveled not long after the equity offering was completed.


Following the equity offerings, these banks tend to provide a few weeks of bullish support
for their banking clients, helping to support the stock. If they did not do so, they would
certainly aggravate their hedge fund clients who bought into the deals.


But we can see that reality is typically quick to set in, and the share price cannot sustain
itself forever once real revenues fail to materialize as predicted in the bullish (pre-
financing) research reports.


Perhaps a few examples would help to illustrate.


Prior to recent earnings, Hallum had an $18 target on TearLab. As with MiMedx, this
was apparently based on the supposedly stellar growth prospects. What about
Canaccord? Canaccord had a $19 target. Even though the growth prospects were
challenged and the valuation was already excessive, TearLab's investment bankers, by
coincidence Hallum and Canaccord, raised $35 million for TearLab, making several million
in fees. The offering price was $13.50. Since that time, insiders have been steady sellers
of shares at prices around 40-50% below the banker targets.


On November 8th, I published an article entitled "Earnings Miss Will Send TearLab
Sharply Lower", which showed that my own research (including phone calls to dozens of
eye doctors who were supposedly TearLab customers) indicated a very high likelihood of


a share price decline of at least 25% to around $8.50 or below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 16/26


The share price had been sitting at around $11.00 at the time and the earnings were (as
expected) the catalyst for a quick and sustained sell-off. Shares of TearLab now trade for
around $6-7 - down by around 40% since my report, but around 66% below the targets
put forth by Hallum and Cannacord, which still sit at $18-19.


On Uni-Pixel, I also called out the Craig Hallum client as being the subject of irrational and
unsubstantiated promotion. At the time, the share price was around $15. As with MiMedx
(and TearLab), Hallum repeatedly raised their share price targets on Uni-Pixel (ultimately
to $58, up from a share price of $10). This caused the share price to trade to over $40. Of
course, this was just in time for Uni-Pixel to complete an equity offering of over $30 million
with Craig Hallum an investment banker. Then, of course, the company failed to live up to
the sky-high projections put forth in the (pre-financing) Hallum research. After the equity
offering was complete, the stock quickly began to plunge and now sits at around $9.00.
Hallum has since (i.e. after collecting its investment banking fees) reduced its price target
on Uni-Pixel to just $9.00 from $58.00 - certainly a significant (post-investment banking)
target revision.


But wait… I'm not done.


In September, I published a warning about Hallum client Neonode . Despite losing the
majority of its revenues and its largest client, Hallum saw fit to upgrade $5.00 Neonode to
a $10.00 target price. The stock soared (even though Neonode had just delivered a
painful earnings miss). What followed was quite predictable. A Craig Hallum-led equity
offering in which management were the largest sellers. As with MiMedx, Neonode
management was very eager to sell their personal holdings at current prices even though
Craig Hallum was telling outside investors that the stock will continue to soar by double-
digit percentages. When I wrote about Neonode, the stock had been sitting at around
$7.50. The stock since fallen to around $5.50-5.70 (a decline of around 25% - and a
shortfall of 50% vs. the latest Craig Hallum target.)


But let's not forget about Canaccord's involvement here.


As we look at the ratings on MiMedx by Canaccord and Hallum, we can see that
Canaccord started at $6.00 in October but doubled this to $12 by December, the month of
the equity offering. Hallum started in March at $7.00 and then raised to $9.00.


The charts tell the story best. Here are the charts of the research-driven run-ups before
the predictable equity offerings. The charts also show the predictable plunges once the
hyper-optimism for these high-priced "growth stocks" fails to result in concrete results.

The pattern, for those who might have missed it, is that a money-losing company (who
happens to need to raise money) is bestowed with a series of sky-high share price targets.
When the share price rises, the target is simply raised higher.


Then the company issues a large amount of stock (paying its banker/research provider
millions in fees).


The stock is typically strong for a while, which is clearly good for the hedge fund clients
who bought the deal.


But then when the excessive optimism fails to translate into reality, the hedge funds
disappear and the stock inevitably falls back to where it began.


Readers should please keep in mind that the examples above were not cherry-
picked for the convenience of this article. These examples were given because they
were all stocks which I wrote about in 2013 and where I warned about this exact
sequence of events well before they materialized.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2003401-mimedx-set-for-a-continued-plunge 18/26


MiMedx is the exact same example. There are overly bullish forecasts being put
forth despite commonsense evidence to the contrary which is patently obvious.
Now that MiMedx has already raised its $39 million in proceeds, and now that the
CEO and the largest outside shareholder have begun selling stock, there is every
reason to expect substantially more downside to come in the next few weeks.


Conclusion - what is MiMedx worth?


As with TearLab, Neonode and Uni-Pixel (among others), MiMedx has achieved a
spectacular valuation of 10-20x sales based on hyper-bullish projections for future growth
which will supposedly be driven by some tremendous recent catalysts.


But the analysts providing these numbers also happen to be the investment bankers to the
company and stand to make millions in fees if the company selects them to underwrite the
offerings.


By contrast, investment banks (as well as research analysts) have no method of
monetizing any level of accuracy in their stock picks.


These analysts have blatantly ignored the flaws in MiMedx's "clinical study" and have
turned a blind eye toward the very obvious competitive reaction that will occur following
CMS reimbursement changes.


These same banks were among the ones who made identical leaps of faith in projecting
triple-digit rises in the shares of TearLab, Neonode and Uni-Pixel (among many others).


Best-case scenario is that MiMedx continues to execute and that the valuation finds a
sustainable level. This probably puts MiMedx at around $4-5.


But worst-case scenario is that there is fallout from the FDA in terms of regulating one or
more products and that the competitive response from the well-funded competitors is in
line with what should be expected.


If this is the case, then MiMedx will not be profitable at any time in the near future and the
share price is more likely to stabilize at around $3.00.

Funny stuff Richard. Do you realize that Mr. Petit has INCREASED his holdings of stock?


07 Feb 2014, 09:49 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
I would like to increase stock holding in the same way (without paying anything).


08 Feb 2014, 10:53 AM


bcctex@gmail.com
I am a long term holder with a large position. I can't believe the distortions of this Pearson guy. He put out his first
short this past summer, and anyone that followed his advice lost a lot of money. So here he goes again! ADEC is not
liquidating its position. Period. Pete sold a very small amount of shares and still owns over 11% of the company. The
test results he comments on are simply not true. I could go on, but you get the picture.


07 Feb 2014, 09:50 AM


homebuilder_watcher
Incredible. Let me try to explain this to you Richard as simply as I can. Petit's 13D filed for the period ended
12/31/2012 showed voting power over 11,322,522 shares. His 13D filed 12/17/2013 shows shares of 11,952,678. In
January of 2014, Petit sold 150,000 shares and used the cash to exercise warrants to BUY 975,000 shares. So, he
has increased the number of shares he owns in the company by 825,000 in the last month. Yet, you publish an article
distorting the facts. Knowing Pete Petit, it would not surprise me at all if a lawsuit is being drafted already. Good luck
with that.

I think it's brilliant to focus only on a CEO's selling and conveniently not mention that he's a net buyer.
Factually correct and thus the author can't successfully be sued. Bravo! Trouble is, it only works one time.


08 Feb 2014, 10:32 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
The CEO Petit is not a buyer.  
Option exercise is quite different than buying in the open market.

Options have an exercise price. When the CEO, Petit, exercised his options, he had to pay that price to
obtain the shares.


Some would say that the act of paying money in exchange for receiving something in return is called "buying".
Some would also say that people who engage in this act of "buying" are called "buyers".


The CEO, Petit, exchanged money and received shares of stock. It could be said the CEO, Petit, is a "buyer"
of that stock since he engaged in the act of "buying".


13 Feb 2014, 01:33 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
Of course, in order to sell he must exercise the option. The point is that the options gave him the right to buy
975,000 shares at $ 0.73 before to sell at $6.90. 
That is not buying, that is very negative for shareholders because of dilution. 
Stating the contrary is wrong and equivalent of stock manipulation.


13 Feb 2014, 02:42 AM


kylesch
He did not sell the shares obtained by exercising the warrant. He sold some stock at 8.26 and and used that
cash to buy an equal dollar amount by exercising the warrants at .75 cents.


This resulted in a position increase of about 250,000 shares.


That is buying. Stating the contrary is wrong, and equivalent to stock manipulation.


14 Feb 2014, 08:01 PM

Didn't you just say he sold some and use cash to buy by exercising warrant?? Doesn't it increase the shares

homebuilder_watcher
Two more points that will eliminate any credibility this 'article has". Richard, you state above that the largest
shareholder Alternative Energy Development (OTC:ADEC) is liquidating. Really? 
ADEC is a private investment co owned by Burk Ross, and is not Alternative Energy! You can't even get the
shareholders right! Alternative Energy has nothing to do with MDXG. But you expect people to put any value in your
article? Second, you mention Dermagraft as the leader in the space. I think you forgot to mention how much money
Shire got for selling Dermagraft. Um, that would be ZERO. They get a royalty on future sales. Dermagraft is so highly
thought of in the market that Shire could not find a buyer that would pay them $100 up front for it! Shire was getting its
lunch eaten by Epifix which is why they dumped it. There are too many holes and blatant inaccuracies in your article
but these two should let everyone know that the only thing they need to know is that you are short and have an
agenda. Good luck with your short.


07 Feb 2014, 10:40 AM


MAM823
Exactly...great point homebuilder_watcher! If anything Apligraf is the leader, not Dermagraft, and
Organogenesis just bought Dermagraft so they could shelf what is clinically the worst product on the market.
All of these stem cell companies are going to be sky rocketing this year eating the lunch that was once owned
by the only 2 players in the market.


I wish I had a job where I could publish the complete opposite of the truth and make more moeny.


07 Feb 2014, 05:15 PM


redstater
I know Burke Ross and he's not liquidating.


12 Feb 2014, 03:57 PM


MAM823
It's funny how someone could be so wrong about a company. Being a sales rep that competes with MiMedx's Epifix, I
can tell you first hand that MiMedx is raking it in because of the changes in reimbursement for advanced skin
substitutes. Most wound centers have switched from using Apligraf and Dermagraft to 100% Epifix and more
importantly, this product works really well. I have no idea where this guy comes up with the notion that there are
superior studies to Epifix when Dermagraft which once was a $250 million product, only had to show it worked 30% of
the time. Epifix closes wounds around 80% of the time.


I would get your facts straight before you put out a biased article just to help your buddies short a stock.


07 Feb 2014, 10:41 AM


PSalerno, Contributor
I don't see any distortion. If the data provided are true, the study was managed in a misleading way. It is not
uncommon.

6. Indications that the largest outside shareholder, Alternative Energy Development Corp. (OTC:ADEC) is liquidating
(just sold below the stealth non-disclosure point of 4.99%)


that is totally false and inconsistent with his later statement


MiMedx's largest shareholder (ADEC Private Equity) then reduced its holding to just below 4.99% of the company -
allowing further sales (including a complete liquidation) to go without any need to report the sales. This is a very
standard "stealth liquidation" technique.

Mr. Pearson, You failed to mention that in your 9/11 Neonode article, you predicted that Neonode would fall "40-60%
in the next few weeks" and that "This would place Neonode back at around $3.50". Your article influenced shorts to
jump on, but could only drive the price down to the 5's. It seems to be doing well despite your inaccurate article and is
poised to move higher.

Renmycat, Richard brought up Neonode. I am merely pointing out that he is deceptive by saying that he was

You had better re-think your short position especially in the face of a secondary that was 5x over subscribed. I think

I would like to say why I have shares and when I am no longer leveraged 100% (have more cash), I will be buying
more.


The product works phenomenally well. AmnioFix has worked amazingly well for many of my pain patients. The
technology is pretty amazing. The EpiFix seems to work just as well.


I don't use the product because I own stock, I bought stock after seeing how well the product worked.

I made the same arguement for PCRX many times on the comment boards when it was trading around $16-18.
Although there were PLENTY of nay-sayer articles here on SA about it, my point was simple: it worked amazingly well
and use would expand tremendously once this point was discovered by more clinicians. This is currently happening. 2
years ago, no one knew about Exparel. Today, at the meetings I teach at, people frequently ask me if use the product.
The stock is now above $60.


I feel the same applies for MDXG. The use of micronized dehydrated Amniotic/Chorionic membrane allograft, either
injectable or in sheets, has an unbelievable amount of application FAR BEYOND just wound care. It works great for
wound care, but once the product is used and expanded to other uses, it's market share will become significant.
However, ask a pain physician about AmnioFix. You will get blank stares. Ask a urologist, spine surgeon,
dermatologist, opthomologist, or general surgeon about EpiFix. You will get blank stares. Perhaps a burn or wound
care specialist MAY have heard of it. No competing product will have applicability to all those areas I mentioned, but
MDXG does - and in a way that can greatly impact care for the better.


MDXG is certainly a buy. I don't mind articles like this however. It keeps my covered call premiums coming without
having to get the stock called away from me. It keeps my sold put premiums high. But the negative articles and this
sentiment can't hold this dam back forever.
