A wound healing revolution?


PolarityTE (NASDAQ:PTE) is a Salt Lake City-based biotech company founded in 1998
by surgeons from Johns Hopkins University. It has found itself embroiled in controversy
at times, but that is not the topic of this piece. We prefer instead to focus on the
underlying fundamentals of the company’s technology, business plan, and financials.


PolarityTE executives, as well as analysts covering the company, have long speculated
that the company will revolutionize regenerative medicine, continually citing that SkinTE
grafts are capable of regenerating full thickness skin with full function, including
sensation, hair follicle morphology, gland production, and pigmentation. However, the
entirety of evidence for these claims stems from a single peer-reviewed paper published
in a mid-tier academic journal. PolarityTE and analysts continue to hype the company's
research abstracts being presented at conferences. However, any graduate student
could tell you that it doesn't take much (or anything) to get an abstract accepted by a
conference. Conferences are, first and foremost, a revenue-generator and rarely turn
away abstract submissions.


In reality, it appears that the majority of their claims come from unpublished animal
studies. Meanwhile, other products are achieving similar (if not superior) results for
many applications. For mild-to-moderate wound cases, Alloderm (Allergan (AGN)) and
DermaCell (Stryker (SYK)) have a long track-record of effectiveness in closing wounds,
especially following plastic and reconstructive surgeries.


Additionally, Alloderm, DermaCell, and a number of similar products have a well-
documented history of successful application in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers
(DFUs), another key patient population for PTE’s grafts. These products have a key
advantage over SkinTE in these applications, in that they are allogeneic (they are
produced by donor tissue). This means that these products can be manufactured in bulk
and sold to surgeons as an off-the-shelf solution, not requiring sourcing from a donor
site on the patient.

Intellectual Property


To fully appreciate weaknesses to PTE graft technology, one must consider that it is
especially undesirable to harvest full thickness skin graft from diabetic donors.
Moreover, these competitive products have an established and well-organized sales
network and a long history of reimbursement. In short, it may be difficult for SkinTE to
compete on less complex cases, where allogeneic, off-the-shelf solutions dominate
market share and enjoy a strong track-record of effectiveness.


In the area of larger, more complex wound cases, Epicel (currently marketed by Vericel
(VCEL)) is an autologous culture expanded tissue graft that has been approved by the
FDA for decades. This product has a remarkable success rate, and has helped patients
regain full (or nearly full) function after even extremely severe burn wounds covering
large portions of the body. Epicel is the dominant product in this space and shows no
signs of being displaced. Again, this is a product with a decades long clinical track-
record in addition to dozens of peer-reviewed publications demonstrating its efficacy.
This leaves a very narrow patient population with wounds of intermediate complexity,
where SkinTE may be able to capture market share from already established products.


Even if we assume that PolarityTE is able to compete effectively in this space (which
they have yet to demonstrate), they will have to be able to protect their technology and
approach from new entrants. To safeguard their business, most biotech companies
would seek to employ a robust intellectual property (IP) strategy.


Currently, PolarityTE has no meaningful IP and they seem unlikely to obtain any. This is
attributable to the fundamental strategic flaw in PTE’s technology. Since the beginning,
they have maintained that their process is patentable, and that they are regulated by
HCT/P pathway for human cell and tissue-based products. This regulatory mechanism
is meant for tissue grafts. Naturally-occurring products are not patentable. Based on
professional experience patenting cell-derived products by members of our team
specializing in the early stage development of biomaterial products, we have doubts as
to whether any claims granted in their Canadian patent or subsequent applications will
offer meaningful protection if their end product is indeed naturally-occurring.

Where are the Margins?


In general, since the Myriad Genetics case in 2013, it has been clear that compositions
of matter found in nature are not patentable. Therefore, in order to obtain patents on
naturally occurring products, one has to demonstrate differences between the product in
the application and naturally occurring products.


In the case of PolarityTE, this means that the patentability of claims in their patent
applications will rest on differences between their product and natural skin rather than
similarities. This means that the IP that will be easiest for them to protect is likely the
least useful aspects of their product. Meanwhile, if the end-product is not naturally-
occurring, they would have to do an IND, clinical trials, and a BLA to continue selling
their product, amounting to a complex, lengthy and financially intensive challenge.


Essentially, PTE’s grafts cannot be regulated by the HCT/P pathway (as naturally-
occurring) and afford sufficient IP-protection as a unique composition of matter or
process - PTE can’t have its cake and eat it too.


If PolarityTE is able to overcome the obstacles to succeeding in the grafts market, they
face an even bigger issue. Competition in this space has resulted in strong negative
price pressures and margins are low and continuing to slide. The latest PolarityTE 10-Q
filing shows that through the first half of the year, their profit margin on SkinTE was
approximately 25%. This may be prohibitively low. During their August 8th earnings
report, they described a large hospital system in the northeast, with more than 12
hospitals purchasing their product. They estimate that “a hospital network of this size
spends greater than $15 million per year on various skin substitutes and wound-healing
products." Even if we assume that PolarityTE acquired 100% of this market, the gross
profit would be under $4M ($15M x 25%). This would not just barely offset the golden
parachute given to former CEO Denver Lough last month, but would be nowhere near
the amount needed to plug the growing deficit in losses from operations, which
amounted to $28.5 million in 2018 and $47.5 million for the trailing twelve months as of
mid-2019.

Risk to Upside


Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market
by 47%. 


Now you can gain access to stock picks and analysis with his newsletter for just
$99/year. 


In order for PolarityTE to break even or even remain viable at their current spending
rate, the company would need to capture 100% of skin substitute/wound healing market
share from dozens of similarly-sized hospital systems. Furthermore, as of mid-2019, the
company’s cash & equivalents stood at $58.2 million. Given an annualized negative free
cash flow of approximately $70 million, the company likely has under a year’s run rate
before they have to do another equity or debt raise. Lastly, there is cause for caution
regarding their financial accounting as comparing their year-over-year Q2 reports, their
accounts payable and accruals have doubled from $3 million to $6 million while their
accounts and notes receivable have increased from $0 to $1.3 million.


To our own surprise, PolarityTE has continued to do business and raise capital despite
major hurdles and without substantial revenue, intellectual property, or peer-reviewed
data. PolarityTE recently posted their best quarter ever for product sales, they obtained
their first granted patent, and they published a paper in a mid-tier academic journal. It is
undeniable that these developments represent positive changes.


Additionally, the company has recently had major changes to their board and executive
management. It is unclear what effect those changes will have on their day-to-day
operations and their ability to raise capital for continued investment in operations. If
PolarityTE is able to make significant progress toward profitability in the near term, this
battered stock may be able to rebound substantially. Additionally, it is possible that a
competitor will view their recent patent as having some significant value and it could limit
the downside to the stock value.

In short, PolarityTE does not appear to have a viable product or business strategy going
forward. Additionally, there is no reason to think that their IP is of any substantial value,
lowering the floor on this stock. Given the intense competition, lack of evidence for
efficacy of SkinTE, low profit margins, and growing losses, we believe that this battered
stock has room to fall much further.
