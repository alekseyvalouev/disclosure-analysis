Globalstar: A Review Of The Experimental Licenses For TLPS
Oct. 28, 2014 9:00 AM ET43 comments
by: Kerrisdale Capital Management


Summary


A review of the history of Globalstar's experimental license activity indicates that
GSAT itself doesn't know how TLPS could ever be monetizeable.


Cisco is not a logical partner, and has publicly belittled TLPS. In the most recent
experimental license, GSAT has merely committed to using Cisco access points.


There is no unifying theme behind all of the TLPS experimental testing
environments, which vary from rural roads to single-family homes to university
campuses to Madison Square Gardens.


Recently, Globalstar Inc. (NYSEMKT:GSAT) applied to the FCC for a new experimental
license to test its Terrestrial Low Power Service (TLPS) concept in California. Though the
initial irrational enthusiasm over this relatively unimportant piece of news has already
started to die down, the history of Globalstar's experimental license activity illustrates the
many shortcomings of TLPS and provides further evidence that TLPS will never be
commercially viable.


Background


On October 20th, Globalstar applied to the FCC for an experimental license to use the
Channel 14/TLPS frequencies in San Carlos, California, using two Cisco access-point
(AP) models, the Aironet 1570 and 3700. The 1570 is specially designed for outdoor
usage; the 3700 is high-end and indoor-oriented; and both are capable of 802.11ac, the
latest Wi-Fi standard, which is defined only for 5GHz, and which TLPS will therefore never
be able to offer. An exhibit attached to the application described the "Research and
Experiment Objectives Specific to this License Application" as follows:


"Determine the efficacy of TLPS for outdoor small cell use in diverse semi-urban
environments."
"Determine the efficacy of TLPS for latency intolerant/high priority applications."


If granted, this TLPS-related experimental license would not be the first, as the table
below shows:

Globalstar's partner, Jarvinian has had at least one experimental license covering Channel
14 for more than 18 months. Yet, not only is Globalstar still seeking to make sense of "the
efficacy of TLPS" for different use cases, but Globalstar has never seen fit to release
detailed results from any of these prior tests, with the arguable exception of the thin and
misleading publicly disclosed "results" (obtained under the initial Cambridge license) that
we criticized in a prior report, and two (1, 2) ex parte letters to the FCC.


Since Globalstar has no new technology to keep secret - just a single channel of its own -
we find no good reason for withholding test results. But Globalstar may not want to
acknowledge certain basic facts about TLPS. For example, in a scenario in which TLPS's
primary user devices are smartphones, its maximum throughput - shared across all
devices that are in range of each other - will be at best ~35 Mbps, equivalent to roughly
seven concurrent high-definition Netflix streams.  This is the same as any other 20MHz
802.11n channel. The higher effective range of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, touted by Globalstar and
Jarvinian as a great advantage, is in fact a disadvantage when the goal is to offer high
capacity and support many users. But if TLPS can't support large numbers of users or
high-value applications, let alone outdo existing public Wi-Fi and cellular coverage, how
can it possibly warrant a multi-billion dollar valuation? As we'll discuss later in this
discussion, Globalstar's aimless testing efforts provides further evidence that the company
itself has no clear vision of how TLPS would generate meaningful value.


Cisco Is Not a Logical Partner, and Has Publicly Belittled TLPS


Some of the excitement over the experimental license application stemmed from the
notion that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was somehow involved. However, all that the
application itself says is that Globalstar will use Cisco APs. (By that standard, Kerrisdale

has partnered with Cisco to test TLPS: we used the Cisco Aironet 1262 in one of our lab
tests.) The attached exhibit includes the phrase "Cisco Test Area" in small letters on
Figure 5, but is otherwise silent on the topic.


Cisco does operate a small public Wi-Fi network in San Carlos, a pleasant but modest
suburb with a population of 28,000 that serves as a test case for Cisco's
"Smart+Connected Communities" concept. Though Globalstar grandiosely declares that "
[t]he city of San Carlos is used by industry as a test bed for advanced 802.11 network and
application testing," that characterization came as a surprise to our Wi-Fi and technology
contacts, including one who works directly on what he characterized as the only unusual
Wi-Fi application in the city: a "smart parking" system. This system operates across a few
hundred parking spaces. Buried sensors detect when a car is present, and communicate
this information (not via Wi-Fi) to "gateway" units that relay it to a central management
system; in some cases, drivers can view this data in real time to determine where to find
an open space. In other cities, these gateways use cellular connections from the likes of
AT&T and Verizon; in San Carlos, because the municipal Wi-Fi network already existed,
they use Wi-Fi. (Note that Wi-Fi is not a necessary component of a smart parking system,
since other cities utilize LTE).


Smart parking is interesting and potentially valuable, but it has nothing to do with TLPS.
Indeed, the existing San Carlos operation already demonstrates that notwithstanding
Globalstar's fear-mongering about "Wi-Fi congestion" and the unsuitability of unlicensed
spectrum for any latency-sensitive application, Wi-Fi works just fine.


We don't know the true extent of Cisco's involvement in Globalstar's proposed tests.
Perhaps Globalstar has won Cisco's cooperation, for instance by committing to buy its
APs. In any event, though, Cisco will never be a logical "terrestrial partner" for a TLPS
buildout. Cisco is not Boingo. It is in the business of selling Wi-Fi hardware and
management software (among other things), not setting up networks and attempting to
monetize them. Moreover, Globalstar advocates seem to forget that Cisco does not truly
support TLPS. Indeed, its May comments in the TLPS rulemaking proceeding are among
the most biting (and substantive) on the record. We include a few quotations below to jog
bulls' memories:


"[W]hatever the Commission does in this proceeding, it should not retreat from its
commitment to expanding use of the 5 GHz band for IEEE 802.11 devices. The
benefits promised by Globalstar's latest business plan pale in comparison to the public
benefits that will be achieved as the Commission opens [additional 5GHz spectrum]...
for Wi-Fi use and allows the potential of IEEE 802.11ac to be fully realized."

"While Globalstar has claimed TLPS will offer higher data rates than traditional Wi-Fi at
2.4 GHz, the Commission should note that Globalstar is not proposing here any
technological advancement. To the contrary, Globalstar's plan is built around use of the
legacy IEEE 802.11b/g/n amendments. To the extent that Globalstar's TLPS may offer
higher speeds, it will simply be because fewer users will be willing to pay Globalstar for
the privilege of using its spectrum and thus fewer users will be sharing Channel 14
compared to other 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi channels."
"Behind Globalstar's new moniker, TLPS will be nothing more than a paid Wi-Fi
offering using the legacy IEEE 802.11b/g/n amendments."


Has Cisco really gone from downplaying TLPS's significance and value in May to signing
on as a full-fledged partner in October, when nothing has changed? We doubt it.


Globalstar Itself Doesn't Know What TLPS Is For


When we discuss TLPS with Globalstar equityholders, they often tell us that we've missed
the real use case for TLPS. It's for residential areas in the suburbs; no, it's for lower
Manhattan; no, it's for reaching greater distances in large spaces. It's for cable companies;
no, it's for phone companies; no, it's for Google; no, it's for Amazon. We've also been told
it's obviously not for managed environments like universities or stadiums, supposedly
rendering our analysis of those environments irrelevant; it's also obviously not for indoor
networks. But we can't blame the market for failing to have a consistent vision of what
TLPS would really be, given that Globalstar itself seems deeply uncertain.


Just consider what Globalstar and Jarvinian say they're investigating. In New Orleans -
specifically, at the University of New Orleans - their stated goal was to "[d]etermine the
efficacy of TLPS relative to public 802.11 channels in a university environment." We have
never heard any investor tout the higher education market as a great opportunity for
TLPS, but that was what Globalstar and Jarvinian focused on last summer. Of course, this
makes no sense. As we have previously documented, universities are quite advanced in
their usage of 5GHz: at one large school, 60% of the data that moved over the campus
Wi-Fi network in the last two months used the 5GHz band, flying in the face of the bizarre
claim from Globalstar's October 9th conference call that 5GHz is "simply not an effective
option" for "a service that has to be designed to be reliable." Indeed, 5GHz is the only way
universities can hope to build the high-capacity networks their users demand. TLPS has
nothing to offer them. (Matt Williams, the former assistant director of networking at
Bucknell University, provided a good overview at the recent Interop New York conference
of the historical transition from coverage-oriented, 2.4GHz-focused Wi-Fi designs

developed years ago to the capacity-oriented, 5GHz-focused networks of today. His
practical advice was that network administrators should "design for 5GHz at -65 [dBm] on
the device with the crappiest antenna you can find.")


Next, Globalstar and Jarvinian sought to test TLPS in a range of different environments in
the New York area and now in San Carlos. Even though Globalstar has always pitched
TLPS as a solution to the "congestion" allegedly afflicting high-density areas, it has
primarily examined low-density areas where, by its own admission, the TLPS value
proposition is hard to fathom:


"A rural transit environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 5-7): TLPS would presumably be
used to offer internet access to drivers on Route 48 in a rural part of Long Island -
likely using 802.11b, a 15-year-old protocol. This simply cannot be taken seriously as a
business plan or even the kernel of one. (Note that companies like GM that have
started to offer in-car Wi-Fi are actually using LTE cellular service for backhaul and
merely distributing the data within the car via Wi-Fi.)
"A low-density enterprise environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 7-9): TLPS in a small
office park in Long Island. We find this use case particularly interesting because, in
response to our prior criticisms of its purported test results from Cambridge, Globalstar
insisted that what it presented - an image of a single AP serving a large office space -
"was used to demonstrate the field test environment and not an intended deployment
scheme." In February, however, Globalstar and Jarvinian grandly stated that "[t]he
enterprise environment represents one of the most critical and challenging applications
of 802.11 technology" and noted that "[t]his testing will build upon that [conducted in]...
Cambridge, Massachusetts (experimental license: WG2XNK)." Nowhere did they
mention that evidently this testing merely aimed to "demonstrate the field test
environment," whatever that means, as opposed to showing anything more realistic or
useful.
"A moderate-density suburban single-family home environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p.
7-9): a house in Long Island. Here Jarvinian asserted that 2.4GHz interference
"threatens a broad diversity of applications, particularly those that are bit intensive and
latency intolerant (e.g. live video, gaming, etc.)." Yet, on Globalstar's October 9th
conference call, Jarvinian's John Dooley, in an attempted show of fair-mindedness,
said, "I highly recommend people use 5 gigahertz to connect to all of their audio/video
equipment." In that case, how could TLPS possibly help for "live video, gaming, etc." in
a suburban residence?
"A moderate-density suburban single-family home environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p.
9-10): Smithtown, NY. Here is the face of the multi-billion dollar TLPS network that

("[D]espite the relatively low level of foot traffic," Jarvinian insists, "local 2.4 GHz ISM Band
interference is severe." Really?)


A "moderate-density outdoor suburban environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 10-14):
Trying to serve an entire school, in this case the J.M. Rapport School for Career
Development in South Bronx, with a single strand-mount AP across the street is
beyond ludicrous. While the "one AP per classroom" rule of thumb for K-12 Wi-Fi
design is widely lampooned by the most skilled practitioners, it at least speaks to the
scale of the problem: one AP, and thus one channel, certainly isn't going to cut it. And
with many APs and high user counts, the small number of channels in 2.4GHz simply
can't deliver a good experience, TLPS or no TLPS; 5GHz is the centerpiece of all
modern Wi-Fi in schools.
"A high-density urban environment" (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 16-17): Madison Square
Garden. Recall that several people dismissed our past use of examples of successful
large-scale Wi-Fi networks drawn from football stadiums and similar locations, arguing

that such environments were clearly not the intended home of TLPS. Yet, here we find
Globalstar and Jarvinian trying to get one 2.4GHz channel to serve a massive, packed
arena. We wish them luck. Fortunately for data-hungry stadium-goers, real Wi-Fi can
use two dozen free, unlicensed channels, which, coupled with smart designs, makes
possible the following photo from Game 5 of the World Series ("#WiFiLikeaBoss"):

"Diverse semi-urban environments": The San Carlos outdoor test already discussed.
San Carlos features a small, suburban network that already serves its intended
purpose. How would TLPS help?
"Latency intolerant/high priority applications": This final stated use case is vague, but
still misguided. Globalstar bemoans that, "[f]or all the convenience of public 802.11
connectivity, the efficacy of real-time functions like IP telephony... are impossible to
guarantee on unlicensed spectrum." But this is simply false on any reasonable
interpretation. Voice over Wi-Fi is so common in enterprises that we used Cisco's
Design Principles for Voice over WLAN to guide the predictive survey work we
commissioned in our previous report. T-Mobile is supporting voice over Wi-Fi today
and giving its customer free 5GHz-capable 802.11ac routers to encourage it. At the
recent Certified Wireless Network Professional conference, Jon Linton gave a detailed

and nuanced presentation about voice over Wi-Fi, including the advantages and
disadvantage of the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. What he didn't do was throw his hands in
the air and declare that the efficacy of real-time telephony was impossible to guarantee
on unlicensed spectrum. Globalstar has declared the impossibility of something that
Wi-Fi professionals successfully manage all the time.


What is the unifying theme behind all of these proposed and tested TLPS use cases, from
rural roads to Madison Square Garden? There isn't one. Globalstar is searching in vain for
a problem TLPS can solve - a problem that matters, with real money to be made - and
finding nothing. The tests are indoor and outdoor, in managed multi-AP environments and
in one-off locations, in offices and in homes, in the city and in the country. There is no
determinate TLPS vision, just an amorphous set of buzzwords. Investors have ascribed
billions of dollars of value to TLPS in the hope that there's some secret plan behind it all,
but there isn't.


Globalstar's Testing Continues to Mislead


Globalstar has thoroughly doubled down on its overblown claims about Wi-Fi congestion,
even the claim that the 2.4GHz band is already "exhausted" today and "has come to an
end effectively as a public resource" (yet, somehow, 2.4GHz simultaneously remains "the
primary band for Wi-Fi"). But one of the images it submitted to the FCC in its most recent
experimental license application, stripped of its spin, undermines those claims. Globalstar
and Jarvinian like to toss around colorful spectrograms, giving the appearance of rich
technical content - yet, they usually lack important information like z-axis labels, making it
impossible to interpret them quantitatively. (For example, what power level does "red"
correspond to? Rarely is there a legend, let alone a readable one.) The point of these
images isn't to inform: it's to be superficially impressive.


Below, we show a spectrogram included in the latest license application; the same image
appeared in Jarvinian's previous application (WH2XBC exhibit, p. 14, Figure 13). It depicts
the observed power levels across the range of frequencies from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz in a
specified location in Smithtown, NY. We have modified the image to include the red
vertical lines, which indicate the center frequencies of Wi-Fi Channels 1, 6, 11, and 14.

Source: Kerrisdale modification of image from Globalstar's 10/20/14 experimental license
application, technical exhibit


Globalstar's gloss on this image is that it depicts "severe 2.4 GHz ISM interference." But
how severe is it, really? One clue comes from the largely blue rectangle at the top, which
charts emissions over time (going down), with redder hues indicating more power in a
given small frequency band. But the overall pattern is clearly more blue than red, and the
"red" value - if we squint - appears to be set at ~-74 dBm, which is not especially high (a
strong indoor Wi-Fi signal a few feet from an AP might be -35 dBm). Moreover, within the
lower portion of the chart, while Globalstar wants to focus on the upper "max" line, the
middle "average" line tells a more important story - and one that makes much more sense
in the low-traffic Smithtown, NY location in question. While the TLPS band is largely
unused, its average power level is not dramatically lower than that of Channels 1, 6, or 11.
At their peaks, those frequencies do spike to much higher than average power levels, but
there simply aren't enough bursts of activity to drive the average level very high - hence,
all the blue in the "waterfall" view at the top. This is not an image of severe interference.
It's an image of modest, transient Wi-Fi activity in just one of the unlicensed bands where
it exists. But it's difficult to see that, because it's not the story Globalstar and its partners
are interested in telling.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2603155-globalstar-a-review-of-the-experimental-licenses-for-tlps 10/26


On a different but related note, we again find that Globalstar is not being forthright about
the kind of "testing" it has conducted and is seeking to conduct. When reasonable,
passably tech-savvy people hear about Wi-Fi testing, they assume it means connecting
user devices to a network and assessing things like throughput. Tests like that are what
Wi-Fi testing firms do for a living. But it's interesting to note that Jarvinian and Globalstar
have never sought permission in their experimental license applications to use any phone,
tablet, or laptop on TLPS. They have only requested the permission to use APs. As a
result, there appears to be no legal way (outside of an anechoic chamber) they could have
done the genuine real-world tests that investors have come to believe they have. Indeed,
even if one weren't interested in device-to-AP throughput, Wi-Fi generally requires clients
to send acknowledgement (ACK) frames back to their APs in order to confirm the receipt
of data, so clients will necessarily transmit as well as receive. Whatever Globalstar and
Jarvinian have been doing, it's hard to see how even something as simple as running the
SpeedTest.net app would be permitted under the authority they've obtained. At a
minimum, they have never openly discussed these problems.


Cisco, however, did raise this point in its May comments (emphasis added):


Globalstar contends that "[m]ost 802.11-enabled consumer devices have the
hardware needed to operate at 2473-2495 MHz, but they lack the physical capability
to operate above 2483.5 MHz in the United States because of restrictions in their
radiofrequency ("RF") software." Globalstar Petition at 17. It is not clear to Cisco
that this is necessarily the case, and Cisco looks forward to reviewing the
responses from manufacturers of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi consumer devices that will inform
the record on whether Channel 14 actually can be activated in client devices by a
simple software upgrade.


One wonders if Globalstar and Jarvinian are shying away from testing user devices simply
because they can't.


Conclusion


In isolation, Globalstar's latest experimental license application doesn't mean much; for
TLPS, it's not the first and likely won't be the last. This does nothing to change our
fundamental thesis that TLPS is a non-solution to a non-problem. But the materials
supporting the application and its predecessors serve as a useful reminder that there is no
well-defined business case for TLPS, just an array of vague hopes and dreams supported
by inadequate data. The Globalstar bubble still has billions of dollars left before it fully
deflates.

72.2 Mbps, depending on the length of the guard interval; application-layer throughput is
roughly half of the data rate. See here. For Netflix's recommended throughputs by stream

GLOBALSTAR SETS THE RECORD STRAIGHT IN NEW PRESENTATION


Highlights Kerrisdale Capital's Flawed Assertions and Mischaracterizations 
Company to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. EDT


COVINGTON, LA , October 09 2014- Globalstar, Inc. (NYSE MKT: GSAT) announced that it will make
available a new investor presentation that outlines the Company’s value proposition, long-term prospects and
the industry landscape, as well as directly refutes Kerrisdale Capital’s (“Kerrisdale”) flawed assertions
regarding the Company. The presentation will be made available on the Company's website at the
commencement of the Globalstar conference call today, October 9, 2014 at 4:30 p.m. EDT. 
“We remain as confident as ever in the strength of Globalstar’s value proposition and competitive advantage,
now and in the future,” said Jay Monroe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Globalstar. “This is a critical
juncture in the communications industry, and Globalstar is well positioned with unique capabilities and assets
to capture the opportunities of the constantly evolving landscape. We continue to benefit from a completed
second-generation constellation, a strengthened balance sheet and liquidity position, substantial operating
growth and achievement of significant milestones on the proceeding for our Terrestrial Low Power Service
(“TLPS”) with the Federal Communications Commission.” 
Highlights of Globalstar’s presentation will include: 
Regulators and industry players agree: Wi-Fi congestion is real, intensifying and must be addressed now; 
The solution to Wi-Fi congestion includes 2.4 GHz, the primary band for Wi-Fi; 
The capabilities of 2.4 GHz cannot be replicated or mitigated by alternatives such as 5 GHz; 
Globalstar’s TLPS is the only spectrum of its kind – a premium service, premium offering and premium
experience; 
TLPS is a superior solution that can be efficiently and immediately deployed post Federal Communications
Commission-approval; and 
TLPS has significant opportunities for partner engagement 
Mr. Monroe continued, “Today’s presentation reiterates what we at Globalstar have always known – that the
facts are indisputably on our side. Kerrisdale’s analysis lacks credibility and any real understanding of the
fundamentals and current state of our industry. What is clear is that Kerrisdale stands alone in its views, which
staunchly contradict the prevailing perspectives of regulators and major industry players. We stand united in
our commitment to supporting our assets, strategy and ability to capitalize on significant future growth
opportunities.” 
The Company's management team will discuss its presentation on a public conference call today, Thursday,
October 9, 2014 at 4:30 p.m. EDT. The call will include prepared remarks followed by a question and answer
session. Investors and the media are encouraged to listen to the call through the Investor Relations section of

The company’s attempted rebuttal was underwhelming, to say the least. Its continued insistence on the
primacy of 2.4GHz is particularly strange. Just yesterday we spoke to another wireless networking
professional and asked him about the prevalence of 5GHz. In stadiums he oversees, he’s seeing 75-80% of
users on 5GHz today. (He also called TLPS “the worst idea I’ve heard in forever.”)

Hedge funds that write opinion pieces in this forum are trying to sway retail investors, and this says volumes more
than their words. In the end, this is a political question, as regards how Globalstar is allowed to utilize the frequencies,
and it is not coincidence that a hedge fund has hit them so close to such political decision. The only way this makes
business sense for Globalstar is if they are allowed to eventually increase power and offer backhaul and access on a
wholesale basis or directly with well financed partners, think Google, Apple, Softbank, Alibaba, etc.. We have a few
oligopolistic players in this space that will not want this competition and I am sure they are not beyond working with a
hedge fund or two. I know most hedge funds under a billion would take their money.

Author’s reply »  kruk, we aren’t addressing our analysis to retail investors specifically; we are addressing it to
everyone. Certainly we have spoken directly with many institutional holders of GSAT as well. This is just
another way to distribute our research.


We disagree with the notion that this is just a “political question.” While the country would be better off if TLPS
didn’t move forward, we have always premised our investment thesis on the assumption that it would be
approved. But approval in no way guarantees commercial viability. And TLPS is not commercially viable.
Google, Apple, Softbank, and Alibaba would not benefit from laying claim to a single licensed Wi-Fi channel
when so many free channels are already available.


The conspiracy theory that some large tech or telecom firm is behind our research is, of course, false. Most
tech firms we’ve spoken to don’t know or don’t care about TLPS.

My Opinion: More eye wash from low life wall streeters. They undermine confidence in the market. Kerrisdale should
be sued for stock manipulation. In fact some of the Kerriddale phonies should face criminal charges.


GSAT has great technologies/capabilit... All the garbage about technology shortcoming completely omits the
possibilities. Shows Kerrisdale and other leaches don't know squat.


GSAT needs to start turning a profit to truly move ahead though!


28 Oct 2014, 11:25 AM


Laltrman
And there kramertj lies the problem; turning a profit. Each earnings report shows losses double the growing
revenues. I sell five different SatCom technologies and despite the fact that GSAT has the best architecture,
they do not have buyer confidence (or global coverage). People are not calling to buy GSAT phones and
service. If FCC grants TPLS and GSAT figures out how t monetize it (despite the blackouts of thier satellite
coverage in TPLS areas), then they win. I've been in this business 16 years and do not see it happening. But
jay is clearly smarter than i am so he'll figure it out. Hopefully before he has to prop up the company again.

My thoughts on GSAT.


First: Because of the the complexity of what was written it sounds correct, is it I do not know it could be totally wrong. I
do however beleive that WIFI will be very big in the future as OTT and voip take off we may not need cell towers.


Second: The internet of things and M2M will need lots of connection points from all parts of the globe including
antartica, deserts and the oceans all where there are no towers as well as deep rural areas.


Third and my final thought. James Monroe is a very smart man and has surrounded himself with even smarter people
in the area of sat and wifi and considering he has spent years on this and lots of money to spend I am sure he has a
plan unlike what the article states. As a billionaire and owner of 69.9% of the stock he should just but the remainder of
the co and take it private guess that would put a lot of short sellers into immediate bk because they have to cover at
any price maybe 5,000 per share???


28 Oct 2014, 11:31 AM

Globalstar can never cover antarctica and remote deserts and sch because of the network architecture.
Coverage is within abut 2,800 miles of a gateway. The only truly global satellite network is Iridium

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We agree that Wi-Fi will be very big in the future, as it is today. But that really has nothing to
do with TLPS. Look at the World Series (http://bit.ly/1tDnUBa). Wi-Fi usage at AT&T Park was massive and
broke several records. But it didn’t require any special, private channel or new spectrum. All it required was a
good design with heavy usage of the 5GHz band. TLPS would not have helped.


The internet of things is also not going to benefit from TLPS. Many Wi-Fi professionals believe that as human
users move to 5GHz, Wi-Fi enabled “things” will end up as the primary inhabitants of the unlicensed 2.4GHz
band. Or perhaps they could use unlicensed spectrum in the 900MHz band, or TV white spaces in the
600MHz band, or something else entirely. The point is that “things” don’t need a lot of bandwidth, and there is
plenty of unlicensed spectrum to go around. When the concept is to deploy large numbers of cheap sensors,
you don’t want to pay a big tax to GSAT when you don’t gain anything from it.

steblawar
It won't work they say, yet they've actively opposed allowing them to use it -- so the logical conclussion is since
they've already sold a lot of shares that they will have to replace later, they're frightened it'll work out and they'll lose
on another big bet if they can't drive the price of the stock down. They're trying to get people to hose themselves by
selling, so they can make a buck when they have to buy, IMO anyway.

They say it's free yet everybody is paying. They say don't need a lot of bandwidth yet the digital highway is
congested and slow. 2.4 GHz is here and working hard yet they say perhaps 900 MHz could be used
(imaginary). They say Wi-Fi will be very big in the future yet TLPS 30% growth on Wi-Fi is nothing and
worthless. TLPS is here and is ready to carry the load yet they say some others nonexistence technologies
could do a better job. I am starting to see that this Karrisdale creature really has no brain.

I find these numbers interesting.


On Sept 30 there were 36.86 million short at a price of $ 3.66


On Oct 15 there were 47.73 million short at a price of $ 1.91. The price since this closing date has never gone lower.


I would have thought that the short play was over and short interest would have dropped substantially.


From comments here and elsewhere, shorts are delusional thinking the share price will go below $ 1.00.


Unless there are day traders playing the short thesis, watching Level II, it clearly is showing shorts are still piling on.


This is now a 50/50 bet for them, with a lot at stake.


Unfortunately, we won't know institutional holdings for 10-1 to 10-15 to see how many shares were sold till 1st quarter
2015. I'll bet Jay knows.

Author’s reply »  We don’t see the connection between TLPS and the Internet of Things. The idea behind the
Internet of Things is that sensors and radios are cheap enough to stick into many sorts of formerly “dumb”
products and enable them to communicate. But this only makes sense using low-cost equipment and
unlicensed spectrum. There are many different unlicensed bands available, from the TV white spaces to
900MHz to 2.4GHz to 5GHz and beyond. What’s the point of paying up for licensed spectrum? A smart
refrigerator doesn’t need a high signal-to-noise ratio to transmit a simple message.


As for cars, consider what the new “connected cars” are actually doing. They’re using LTE cellular signals
from the likes of AT&T to connect to the internet. Then they’re redistributing that connection within the car via

Drive out of town and your AT&T connection will be lost, worst with Sprint and T-Mobil. Why Karrisdale used

not disconnect wherever I go.

"Just consider what Globalstar and Jarvinian say they're investigating. In New Orleans - specifically, at the University
of New Orleans - their stated goal was to "[d]etermine the efficacy of TLPS relative to public 802.11 channels in a
university environment.""


This was a SECONDARY objective of an EXPERIMENTAL LICENSE APPLICATION:


"Secondary Research and Experiment Objectives"


(a)Determine the efficacy of TLPS relative to public 802.11 channels in a university environment characterized by
sustained high traffic loading."


Funny that Kerrisdale omits the "Primary Research and Experiment Objectives."

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The “general research and experiment objective” language is the same throughout the
different experimental-license applications. It’s very generic and – shareholders should fervently hope – not
up to date, since it refers to testing very basic aspects of TLPS like “basic methods for control of TLPS
operation” and “the efficacy of the TLPS application.” If it takes five licenses over 18 months to figure out the
basics, then something has gone wrong. Instead, we give GSAT the benefit of the doubt and focus on the
new elements of each additional license application, which primarily relate to the locations and types of
environments. But we encourage everyone to read all of the license documents. That’s why provided the
links.

The evolution of the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band from what was once thought of as a 
“garbage” band to the home of Wi-Fi and other popular communications technologies has been an extraordinary
Commission success story. Indeed, as the record recently developed in connection with the Commission’s 5 GHz
proceeding (ET Docket No. 13-49) established, the remarkable growth of consumer demand for Wi-Fi has caused the
2.4 GHz band to be saturated 
in many locations. The Commission’s actions last month to facilitate greater unlicensed use of the 5 GHz band
should, over time, slow the rate at which the 2.4 GHz band is becoming congested. As the Commission has
recognized, the recently-adopted 5 GHz-only IEEE 802.11ac MAC/PHY can deliver much faster speeds to
consumers, in large part because it takes advantage 
of the much wider maximum channel bandwidths available at 5 GHz as compared to those available at 2.4 GHz and
because the wealth of spectrum at 5 GHz promises to reduce the congestion that can slow the 2.4 GHz band to a
crawl. Thus, as more IEEE 802.11ac-compliant equipment is deployed, an increasing percentage of Wi-Fi traffic will
be driven to the 5 GHz band 
to take advantage of the benefits of higher speeds and reduced congestion. However, the 2.4 GHz band will continue
to be an important source of unlicensed spectrum for the foreseeable future because of the continued use of legacy
IEEE 
802.11b/g/n devices, because the demand for Wi-Fi is projected to outpace the Commission’s ability to allocate
additional spectrum resources, and 
because the 2.4 GHz band is the only globally harmonized unlicensed band suitable for Wi-Fi.

Kerrisdale Capital Management, Contributor
Author’s reply »  We don’t see how this passage from Cisco’s comments is inconsistent with our views. (We
do think it underestimates the pace of the ongoing increase in device support for 5GHz, but in this context
that’s a minor point.) But what is Cisco actually saying here? It’s saying that it wants to make sure the existing
unlicensed 2.4GHz band is not harmed by TLPS. We have demonstrated with our lab testing
(kerr.co/testingreport and kerr.co/allionreport) that TLPS would harm the unlicensed 2.4GHz band. So Cisco
is right to raise this concern. And the backdrop to Cisco’s remarks is that 5GHz is becoming more and more
important. This completely undermines GSAT’s minimization of this importance of this band.


The notion that the 2.4GHz band is “saturated” in some locations does not imply that Wi-Fi is dysfunctional in
those locations. The free, unlicensed 5GHz band is perfectly capable of handling the load in these places as
long as the network is properly set up. That’s exactly how AT&T Park, Levi’s Stadium, etc. handle their tens of
thousands of users today.

Your work consistently shows a pattern of stating supposedly supporting evidence for your short directly next to an
omission of important factss that directly contradict your view.


For example you state the fact that 802.11ac is a 5 Ghz Wifi standard. and the Aironet 3700 series is a ... drumroll
802.11 ac access point. WOW. why would Globalstar ever test their 2.4 ghz spectrum on this device?? Maybe its
because of the following FACT that you are purposefully omitting for you analysis.


The Aironet 3700 Series delivers: 
• The industry's first wireless access point with integrated 802.11ac Wave 1 radio to support a 4x4 MIMO with three
spatial streams


• Dual Band 2.4/5 GHz integrated radios to address the growing needs of BYOD and bandwidth demands


• A modular design that supports Cisco Wireless Security, Cisco 3G Small Cells, or future 802.11ac Wave 2

for rulemaking. Kerrisdale remained silent throughout the 2014 pleading cycle on the 1 Terrestrial Use of the 2473-
2495 MHz Band for Low-Power Mobile Broadband Networks; Amendments to Rules for the Ancillary Terrestrial
Commission’s proposed TLPS rules. While interested parties met the May 2014 deadline for comments and the June
2014 deadline for reply comments, Kerrisdale had no interest yet in Globalstar stock and was indifferent to this
proceeding.3 Then months after the close of the pleading cycle, after admitting that its interest was driven by
“financial positions that would increase in value if the price of Globalstar’s stock declines,”4 Kerrisdale lodged
pseudoscience ex parte filings transparently designed to depress Globalstar’s stock price. The Commission should
reject Kerrisdale’s self-serving effort to advance its own private interest over the public interest.


Kerrisdale’s financially motivated filings are severely flawed and do not contain 
any material relevant to the Commission’s decisions in this proceeding. Its supposed criticisms of the TLPS field study
conducted by Globalstar and Jarvinian in 2013 are meritless and irrelevant. Kerrisdale claims that Jarvinian
conducted a computer simulation of TLPS coverage rather than actual field tests, and argues that Globalstar
overstated the coverage and capacity advantages of TLPS over public Wi-Fi. In fact, Jarvinian’s conclusions
regarding signal propagation and capacity were based on realworld measurements of access point transmissions on
Channel 14 (TLPS) and Channel 6 (public Wi-Fi). Jarvinian collected more than 3,000 such data points to
demonstrate substantial differences in coverage between a TLPS access point and an access point using
conventional Wi-Fi channels, and Globalstar’s assessment of coverage and capacity was well founded and based on
real-world testing.5 In fact, in order to be conservative, these tests compared coverage and capacity at a time when
public Wi-Fi usage was well 
below peak levels, which made the performance disparity between TLPS and Wi-Fi 
Channel 6 comparatively moderate and anything but overstated.


Kerrisdale’s claims are based on computer simulations and a survey purporting to 
project the range of a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signal. These simulated results from a source 
unwilling to go on the record should be given no weight. Kerrisdale fails to account for the distinction between physical
propagation range and effective range due to 
interference limitation, and makes no attempt to compare the performance of TLPS with public Wi-Fi in an
environment that already includes substantial Wi-Fi operations. Such a comparison – showing the superior
characteristics of TLPS transmissions on unencumbered 802.11 Channel 14 – was the very purpose of the Jarvinian
field testing, and the conclusions of that testing remain uncontested. While the physical propagation ranges of TLPS
and public 2.4 GHz 802.11 channels are identical in a vacuum, the lack of significant interference on Channel 14
means that the usable range for equivalent throughput is much greater in TLPS spectrum. Significantly, the more
interference limited the environment is (e.g., a dense urban area), the greater the effective differential in performance
between TLPS and unlicensed 2.4 GHz spectrum.


Kerrisdale’s analysis also ignores the carrier-controlled nature of TLPS. For both 
regulatory and market-based reasons, a TLPS operator will manage operations on 
Channel 14 through a network operating system. Centralized coordination of TLPS

coverage boundaries and frequency re-use through control of power and radiation 
patterns will limit interference and enable a high, carrier-grade quality of service that is unobtainable on public Wi-Fi
channels.6 In contrast, uncoordinated co-channel usage constrains the use of these network management techniques
in public Wi-Fi spectrum. 
Like its simulated coverage from a single access point, Kerrisdale’s anonymous 
simulation of a Wi-Fi network architecture using a large number of 5 GHz and dual-mode (5 GHz/2.4 GHz) access
points is irrelevant to the Jarvinian test results comparing TLPS and public Wi-Fi propagation and capacity.7
Globalstar actively supported the Commission’s proceeding to free up additional Wi-Fi channels at 5 GHz, and it
believes that the Commission should put the 5 GHz band and other bands to greater use to meet the public’s
accelerating demand for wireless broadband. At the same time, Kerrisdale’s network design merely highlights the
inferior propagation characteristics of the 5 GHz band and the need for a large number of access points for this
deployment. Kerrisdale continues to treat the 5 GHz band as a direct alternative to 2.4 GHz, but 5 GHz transmissions
decay at roughly 4.5 times the rate of 2.4 GHz signals in free space and meaningfully faster when transiting common
building materials. Thus, while it is an important complement, the 5 GHz band because of its limited propagation will
never 
achieve the same functionality as the 2.4 GHz band, regardless of future technological developments. 
8 Kerrisdale misleadingly portrays 2.4 GHz as a dead band that is soon to be 
abandoned for the 5 GHz band and the 802.11ac standard, which was developed to accommodate the larger channel
widths at 5 GHz. Development of the 2.4 GHz band continues at a robust pace and will likely accelerate after the
Commission adopts TLPS rules. The industry remains focused on dual-band devices where 2.4 GHz will continue to
be essential to device operations. 
The Commission should also disregard Kerrisdale’s grossly manipulated test of 
the effect of TLPS operations on 802.11 Channel 14 at 2473-2495 MHz on nearby public Wi-Fi networks operating on
Channel 11 at 2451-2473 MHz.9 Kerrisdale’s test parameters bear no resemblance to real-world operating conditions.
In a sealed, anechoic test chamber, Kerrisdale’s contractor placed a single access point operating on Channel 11
directly next to access points and client devices operating on Channel 14. This diversity of transmitting sources and
the density and close physical proximity of this equipment are entirely unrealistic and would never exist in practice. In
addition, for the Wi-Fi traffic on Channel 11, four “parallel” traffic streams were utilized, implying that the access point
was transmitting four parallel spatial streams. This mode of operation appears purposely selected since it is known to
be particularly vulnerable to interference. 
Also, the traffic generator for all four of the tightly spaced Channel 14 transmissions was set on bi-directional mode.
As a result, both the Channel 14 access points and client devices were transmitting and therefore presumably
interfering with one another. This mode further increases the probability of interference to adjacent-channel
operations. 
Finally, the Channel 14 access points and client devices in the Kerrisdale tests 
were set to operate in the now fifteen-year old and virtually obsolete 802.11b mode, a mode that would never be
deployed in TLPS, while the Channel 11 devices were set to operate in 802.11n mode (the most widely deployed
version of the technology today). It is well known that the operation of Wi-Fi devices using 802.11n is severely
degraded by nearby devices using 802.11b.10 This detrimental impact on throughput occurs not only if the proximate
802.11b and 802.11n operations are on the same channel, but also if these operations occur on adjacent channels
(such as Channels 6 and 11 or Channels 11 and 14), since the longer packet transmission times for 802.11b
disproportionately defer

White_Paper.pdf. more interference compatible 802.11n mode. With its choice of test parameters, Kerrisdale attempts
to cause controversy for its own financial benefit. 
In any case, mutual effects among Wi-Fi channels were obviously understood and 
anticipated by IEEE when it designed the 802.11 standard. The standard provides for the use of Channel 14 at 2473-
2495 MHz and thirteen other 22 megahertz channels across the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Any party is free today to deploy
Wi-Fi systems on Channels 2, 5, 7, or 10, despite the effects on non-overlapping Channels 1, 6, and 11. With respect
to Channel 14, IEEE itself urged the Commission in 2003 to permit 802.11 operations above 2483.5 MHz without any
concern about the effect of those operations on preexisting Wi-Fi or other unlicensed systems at 2.4 GHz.11
Compliance with Part 15 of the Commission’s rules is all that should be required for unlicensed operations below
2483.5 MHz, including TLPS in the 2473-2483.5 MHz band segment. As it has described in this proceeding,
Globalstar’s TLPS operations will comply not only with already existing Part 15 rules, but also with the Commission’s
proposal in the NPRM to limit out-of-band emissions below 2473 MHz.12 
While Kerrisdale claims concern over the possibility of increased interference to 
Wi-Fi from Channel 14, it incongruously calls for the Commission to open up Channel 13 in the United States. It even
suggests a nationwide shift to a “Channel 1/5/9/13 template” for Wi-Fi operations.13 It is elemental that this Channel
1/5/9/13 structure would result in greater Wi-Fi interference than Channel 1/6/11/14 usage. A more tightly packed
Channel 1/5/9/13 configuration would spread Wi-Fi transmissions over only 83 megahertz of spectrum, compared to
95 megahertz for the Channel 1/6/11/14 arrangement. Because of the greater potential for interference – plus the
need to comply with emissions limits at the 2483.5 MHz band edge – the Channel 1/5/9/13 alignment is almost never
used. Network engineers in the United States use the Channel 1/6/11 Wi-Fi 
configuration primarily, and engineers in other countries typically follow this protocol.

Commission’s new rules and Globalstar’s launch of TLPS will yield additional public 
interest benefits by creating nearly 90,000 jobs and $11 billion of GDP annually.21 
The Commission’s innovative rules for low power wireless broadband in the Big 
LEO band, proposed almost a year ago, represent the logical next step as the Commission advances the nation’s
spectrum policy goals. For more than a decade, the Commission has worked toward more flexible terrestrial use of
MSS spectrum. In 2003, the Commission adopted rules for MSS ATC operations in the Big LEO band and other MSS
bands.22 In 2010, the National Broadband Plan noted that the restrictive nature of these MSS ATC rules had “made it
difficult for MSS providers to deploy ancillary terrestrial networks, as well as to establish partnerships with wireless
providers or other well-capitalized potential entrants,”23 and urged the Commission to take “actions that will 
optimize license flexibility sufficient to increase terrestrial broadband use of MSS 
spectrum” while preserving the MSS industry’s unique services.24 In response, the Commission issued a Notice of
Inquiry on the regulatory barriers to terrestrial use of existing MSS spectrum and specifically asked how it “can best
increase the value, utilization, innovation and investment in the spectrum for terrestrial services throughout the 2 GHz,
Big LEO and L-bands.” 25 In December 2012, the Commission reformed the 
2 GHz MSS-terrestrial framework by eliminating the ATC requirements in that band and establishing flexible technical
rules for future terrestrial operations.26 The Commission’s proposed rules for low-power terrestrial mobile broadband
service in the Big LEO band would accelerate this shift toward efficient and innovative use of MSS spectrum. 
Globalstar urges the Commission to adopt its proposed rules for TLPS as expeditiously as possible.
