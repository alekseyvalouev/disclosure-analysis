China Central Television Coverage Of Longwei Petroleum Reinforces
GeoInvesting's Findings Of Fraud

by: The GeoTeam


On Monday, January 28, 2013, China Central Television Channel One (CCTV-1), the
largest national Chinese government-run news network, aired a special investigative
report titled "Investigation of the Truth Behind Longwei Petrochemical" verifying our
findings on the Longwei Petroleum (LPH) fraud.


See the CCTV video here.


To our knowledge this is the first time that China's state-run CCTV has come down so
strongly against a China-based company accused of fraud. CCTV cites our report several
times, makes several similar observations, and arrives at the same conclusion.


Highlights of the CCTV special report include:


Overgrown vegetation still covering the rail spur to the Gujiao facility.
No employee or tanker truck traffic for the five hours (between 12 and 5pm) that the
reporter filmed the Gujiao facility.

No fueling attendant and rusty equipment at the Taiyuan facility.
Local residents and businessmen convey the fact that LPH has not had much
business for years.
Most interesting was the CCTV reporter's visit to the Taiyuan City State Administration
of Taxation office (the "SAT" is China's version of the IRS). According to the SAT
officer, LPH's reported revenue for 2012 was only RMB 2.64 million or
approximately $426,000 dollars!


Given that even the Chinese government run television has sided against LPH and its
Chairman Cai Yongjun, what now remains is for CFO Michael Toups, the independent
directors and auditor Russell Anderson to explain their seemingly negligent performance
in preventing Chairman Cai's fraud and more importantly why until now they have not
done anything since January 3, 2013 to protect shareholders by bringing clarity to the
situation. We here at GeoInvesting continue to watch with much interest for any
statements from LPH's fee collectors who in our opinion have so far neglected their
fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.


Disclosure: I am short LPH. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company
whose stock is mentioned in this article.

I think it's good sign that the Chinese themselves also pay more attention to fraudulent companies in China.

I think its pretty amazing that the Chinese have ignored every fraud in china, including the much larger and more
publicly embarrassing recent issues with CAT which has generated international hue and cry and have decided to
replay something highly similar to the GEO article on a tiny out of the way microcap that almost nobody in the US or
China has ever heard of.


But that's just my opinion....

Michael Toups should claim that he was a victim of the unscrupulous Chairman Cai Yongjun, then apply to be
Obama's treasury secretary.

It's said that those things (fraud) still happen. When there is money involved people can do strange things.


Sad for many of us. I didn't have a position in LPH anymore, but I still have worthless shares of Sancon Resources
Recovery, China Intelligent Lighting, NIVS Intellimedia, China Nutrifruit and some other low life fraudulent companies.


Despite that I think there is value out there. One thing is for sure allocate just a small percentage of your portfolio in
these kind of stocks.

Incredible. The Chinese Government finally cracks the whip. Reading between the lines the newscaster's comment
that the LPH fraud should be an "alarm" (warning) to other Chinese U.S. listed companies is a strong indication that
the Chinese Government might target more frauds.

They crack, but do they compensate shareholders?


It has to be much easier for shareholders to claim money from these frauds.

Unfortunately, I would say it will be virtually impossible for you to get your money back. stock will be delisted,
maybe trade for a penny or 2 and that will be that.

I dont understand, I thought access to SAIC got more limited, but reporter can just get the SAT? Makes no sense. I
think the reporter is a step away from re-education camp.

Breaking news... two directors of LPH have resigned. One director stated she had no differences with the board, but
one (the chair of the audit committee) resigned because the board refused to hire forensic auditors to examine the
books, as recommended by the audit committee. Game over boys...
