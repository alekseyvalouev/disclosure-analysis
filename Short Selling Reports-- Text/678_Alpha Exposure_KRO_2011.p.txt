Is Kronos Enriching Its Chairman at the Expense of Minority
Shareholders?

Over the last few months, Kronos (NYSE:KRO) has purchased millions of dollars worth of
stock in a company called Valhi (NYSE:VHI). This is a very odd transaction since Valhi is
the parent company of Kronos. These transactions are even more suspicious since
according to Bloomberg, the Chairman of Kronos, Harold Simmons, owns 93% of Valhi
directly and through wholly owned holding companies. I believe Kronos may be making
these stock purchases to enrich its Chairman, Harold Simmons, who is the Chairman of
both Kronos and Valhi, at the expense of Kronos’ minority shareholders.


In November 2010, Kronos completed a secondary offering of its stock in which it raised
almost $360 million. It seems Kronos is using the money it raised during this offering to
purchase Valhi stock and the stock of other companies controlled by Harold Simmons
such as Timet. Valhi is a holding company comprised primarily of public stakes in other
companies controlled by Harold Simmons. Valhi currently trades at a significant premium
to its NAV, which makes me wonder why Kronos would see buying Valhi as a good use of
capital. Kronos’ shareholders aren’t getting value, but Harold Simmons is since Kronos’
purchases of Valhi have been driving up Valhi’s stock. Ultimately, the question must be
asked: are Kronos minority shareholders being treated fairly when the company
purchases stock in Valhi?


Let’s take a quick look at the value of Valhi to better understand why I feel it is overvalued.
Valhi is comprised of stakes in 3 public companies and 2 private investments.


VHI controls 83% of NL. There are 48.7 million shares of NL currently trading at
$16.75 which gives it a market cap of $815.7 million. This makes VHI’s stake in NL
worth $677.1 million.
Valhi also owns 50% of Kronos. Kronos has 115.9 million shares outstanding and
trades at $25.04. This makes VHI’s stake in KRO worth $1.451 billion.
Valhi also owns shares of TIMET. However, NL and Kronos also own shares in TIMET,
which are consolidated in the footnotes of Valhi’s financials. When you strip away the
TIMET shares controlled by NL and Kronos, it appears that Valhi owns a little over 1
million shares of Titanium Metals Corp (TIE) which currently trades at $16.75 per share
giving this stake a value of $16.9 million.

When you add up the value of these publicly traded entities, you get a little over $2.145
billion which equates to $18.97 per share. Along with these publicly traded companies,
VHI has a stake in or controls two private entities:


Valhi owns 32% of Basic Management and Landwell. Valhi’s share of Basic
Management and Landwell’s net sales in 2010 was 6.9 million. If I put a 5 multiple on
that, it gives this stake a value of 34.5 million.
Valhi also controls a company called Waste Control Specialists, a West Texas facility
for the processing, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous, toxic and certain
types of low-level radioactive waste that is still under construction. WCS believes they
can reach $160 to $180 million in EBITDA in 4-5 years. That is based on $80-90
million in EBITDA from compact and non-compact states, as well as another $80-$90
million in EBITDA from the federal government, which is far from certain as the federal
government portion is still in the competitive bidding stage. Taking the projections at
face value, 8x fully operational EBITDA of $170 million (mid-point between $160 and
$180) gets me $1.360 billion of value. (I have some reservations about the feasibility of
this revenue and EBITDA projection given the amount of B&C waste generated in the
entire country, storage prices for B&C waste, as well as the potential for down
blending, but that is beyond the scope of today’s discussion.) This number should be
discounted back because we are years away from the operation being fully ramped to
include the federal government if that business comes to fruition, but I will skip
discounting it to show the greater overvaluation of VHI.


Adding up the value of the public stake in Kronos, NL, and TIMET and the value of Basic
Management and Landwell and Waste Control Specialists, I get an asset value of $3.539
billion. The company has no debt and their share of cash on the balance sheet is $22.2
million in cash (use page 43 of 10Q by allocating “all of Valhi exclusive of its subsidiaries”,
plus 32% of “Tremont” cash plus all of “WCS” cash). If I deduct corporate expenses of
around 6 million at a 7 multiple, that means the equity value of Valhi is $31.12 compared
to the current price of $42.75. This means VHI stock is trading at 37% above fair value.


Even though Valhi appears to be overvalued, Kronos has been purchasing shares of Valhi
hand over fist. According the Form-4 filings on the SEC website from 4/19/11 through
6/13/11, Kronos has purchased a little over 110,000 shares of VHI at a cost of a little over
$4.2 million. It seems that Kronos would be the best vehicle for Harold Simmons to do this
transaction because he controls less of Kronos than he does TIE or NL; he can personally
enrich himself at minimal direct cost.

According to Bloomberg, Harold Simmons owns only 0.5% of Kronos directly compared to
49% of TIE and 3% of NL. It becomes even more interesting when you consider that
according to Form 4’s, Harold Simmons was making direct purchases of VHI himself
earlier in the year when the stock was cheaper. From 2/15/11 through 3/14/11, he directly
purchased little over 36,500 shares at a total cost of a little over $819,000. I have never
encountered this sort of inside dealing, and can only conclude Kronos is wasting
shareholders' money to enrich its Chairman, who is already a billionaire.


Disclosure: I am long KRO.

I own, NL, KR, TIE, and VHI. I am a minority stock holder and at present am going along for a very profitable ride. I do
not understand how he is hurting the minority stockholder according to your article.

So, what happens to you when these stocks return to earth as they will when Simmons' artificial prop up is
removed?

I own NL, VHI, kR and TIE. Tell me how the minority stock holder is being hurt. 
Frankly I am enjoying the upward ride.

Uh, give the guy a break. After all, it's his very first article. The fact that stockholders may be getting the shaft
as cited may be argumentative, but that's quite an aroma in the air.


Perhaps the author's aim would be better served had he suggested the stockholders "ride" would be even
steeper had it not been for the "inside trading", yes?

Not all KRO shareholders hold KRO as well as VHI stocks. The author clearly is talking about the effect of the
transaction, on tthe KRO shareholders. You hold both. So, he was not referring to you. So, please do not try
to confuse the picture. The article is very valid.

Thanks for the article. I had owned TIE in the past; not sure whether i made or lost on that transaction. Had looked at
KRO, but never purchased it. It is interesting how insiders seem never content with just running a business fairly, but
have to distort and contort things. 
Keep up the good work.

Simmons has committed his fortune to be selectively donated to charity upon his demise. From his lifelong business
behavior, I find that deed an odd bedfellow, as Simmons is a cutthroat entreprenour who has not shown great charity
or sensitivity to others in his business dealings.


Knowing that, his family must be getting some super tax advantages from it that overshadow all other reasons for this
"deed of great charity".
