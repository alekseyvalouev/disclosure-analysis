Challenge to Life Partners' Auditor: Address Red Flags
Apr. 28, 2009 4:22 AM ET8 comments
by: Shareholder Watchdog


In February 2009 Citron Research and Jim Cramer provided a critical assessment of Life
Partners’ (NASDAQ:LPHI) business and management. The Citron report focused on
LPHI's "egregious fees", the unlikely sustainability of those fees, the CEO’s past
accounting indiscretions, and LPHI's tiny auditor and equally-small audit fees. A few days
after the critical report from Citron, LPHI's management posted a response on its website.
Oddly, management has since removed the response, but a copy can be found under the
comments sections here.


The reports peaked my interest and as a result, I conducted additional research on LPHI’s
business practices and management. I believe many of Citron’s red flags have merit, and
found additional red flags that suggest a business model that revolves around exorbitant
fees charged to retail investors and possible forensic accounting issues.


Challenge to Eide Bailly
There is one entity in the position to address many of LPHI's red flags, their new auditor
Eide Bailly. Eide Bailly acquired LPHI’s tiny auditor Murrell, Hall, McIntosh in August 2008.
Eide Bailly is expected to provide its first audited financial statements on LPHI in mid-May
2009. I believe investors should demand more oversight than what was provided in
Murrell's 2008 audit (fees of only $85,881). Eide Bailly has a significant opportunity to
standout among the smaller audit firms. IF LPHI is taking advantage of its retail customers
in a potentially illegal manner (something I suspect but CANNOT verify), then Eide Bailly
is in the best position to expose these issues and protect public investors and clients.
They are also in the best position to address potential forensic accounting issues
highlighted below.


1) Are LPHI’s Fees the Highest in the World for Any Asset Class?


In management’s response to the Citron report, management stated that their fees are
“only” 7% of face and that there is no company with which these fees can be compared. I
believe the way management characterizes its fees is highly misleading. In LPHI’s 3Q (the
last quarter with a 10q or 10k), LPHI had $28.1 million of “gross” revenue and $14.2
million of “net” revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/133531-challenge-to-life-partners-auditor-address-red-flags 2/9


The difference in gross and net is the fees LPHI pays to its licensees, agents and brokers.
While management discloses their fees as a percentage of face value (14.4% gross and
7.3% net of policy face value transacted), they do not disclose the purchase price of the
policies. Policies are acquired at a large discount to face value.


According to R. Scott Peden, LPI’s President, on LPHI’s second quarter earnings
conference call, “it’s not so much the precision of the life expectancy as it is the discount
at which we purchase.” The fees as a percentage of the amount invested are much more
relevant to LPHI’s investors than as a percentage of face value.


Based on assumptions laid out in the table below (price paid to policyholder between 15%
to 45% of face value), LPHI’s fees would equate to 16% to 49% to the gross price paid to
the policyholder. In addition, LPHI’s clients must bear the cost of LPHI’s net fees AND the
fees paid to LPHI’s licensees, agents and brokers. This is why “gross” revenue / fees is
much more relevant to LPHI’s clients than net fees.


As the table below illustrates, if LPHI acquired a $1 million face policy for 30% or
$300,000, LPHI would collect close to $73,000 of fees and LPHI’s brokers and agents
would collect close to $71,000. So for a policy that someone was willing to sell for
$300,000 (I assume this would be a “market price”), LPHI’s investor would have to pay
almost $444,000 for it after accounting for all those fees.


Imagine buying Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock for $125 because your financial advisor
told you it was going to $250, and having to write a check upfront for $185 ($125 for the
stock plus 48% fee or $60). Not only would investors avoid that proposition if they had the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/133531-challenge-to-life-partners-auditor-address-red-flags 3/9


appropriate disclosures, but regulators would be outraged.


This appears to be the reality for LPHI clients. Based on the table above, 32% to 96% of
the amount invested will be paid in fees assuming a 15% to 45% discount. Said another
way, for every $100 invested, $24 to $49 would go to LPHI and LPHI's licensees. At that
fee level, I cannot find another example of an asset class or asset management firm that
charges fees anywhere close to the levels LPHI charges its clients.


LPHI often mentions that there are no public competitors to measure their fees against.
However, Peachtree, a direct competitor to LPHI, was a publicly traded company on
London’s AIM market prior to their acquisition by DLJ Merchant Banking. Peachtree’s last
earnings release is somewhat dated (6/30/06), but does provide some color on their fees.


In the first half of 2006, Peachtree purchased policies with a face value of US$400
million generating gross revenue of US$24 million.


Peachtree’s “gross revenue” of 6.0% was less than half of LPHI’s gross revenue to face
(14.4%). Surely, this cannot go unnoticed forever.


I believe LPHI’s exorbitant fees are susceptible to regulation and competition, along with
greater awareness including more disclosure to LPHI’s clients. According to Colorado’s
complaint, Life Partners


failed to disclose to investors the method by which life expectancy was determined;
the high frequency rate in which viators outlived the life expectancies predicted by
Life Partners; and that if the viator outlived the life expectancies, the investor was
liable to make the premium payments. It is further alleged that Life Partners failed to
disclose the original purchase price of the policy and commissions paid to the sales
agents, making it impossible for an investor to determine the true market value of the
policy.

State and federal regulators are expected to continue to drive transparency of the life
settlements market, which should standardize and collapse fees. For example, New York
recently proposed legislation that aims to increase disclosures of the

value of offers and counter-offers, the fees paid to life settlement brokers and the
contractual arrangements among the parties involved in a transaction” as a means
to regulated an industry that “can be ripe for abuse.


2) Audit and Accounting Issues – How is LPHI Accounting for Repuchases?


The challenge to Edie Bailly LLC as they conduct their first annual audit is, can they
answer and address the following questions:


1. Are 100% of LPHI's policy acquisitions legitimate?
2. How does LPHI generate fees at more than two times the industry averages?
3. Has LPHI's historical return figures included in their marketing materials been audited


and verified?
4. Does LPHI apply consistent treatment to accounts receivable and revenue recognition


with "closed transactions," especially at quarter end?
5. Does LPHI's GAAP income statement include all expenses associated with its


operations, including the costs associated with its ongoing legal battles?
6. Does LPHI’s revenue recognition (gross revenue) conform to GAAP?
7. Does LPHI properly account for policy repurchases?


There seems to a major GAAP violation as it related to question #7. As part of its
agreement with the State of Colorado, LPHI


offered to repurchase the viatical settlement policy interest from all Colorado
residents who purchased viatical settlement since January 1, 2006…The rescission
offer will be made by letter by or before January 31, 2009, and will require the
purchasers’ acceptance of the offer by or before March 3, 2009…Payment to all
Colorado purchasers accepting the rescission offer will occur by or before April 30,
2009. With regard to those individuals who have previously accepted Life Partners,
Inc.’s prior repurchase offer, they will receive an additional sum consistent with
statutory requirements, in addition to the amounts already received by them.

According to LPHI’s 3Q08 10Q,


during the First Nine Months of this year, we recorded $4,951,832 for purchases of
policies for investment purposes.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/133531-challenge-to-life-partners-auditor-address-red-flags 5/9


According to LPHI’s conference call on 1/13/09, the $5 million of purchases relate to
Colorado repurchases:


<Q - John Nobile>: Yes, I know that at least on November 30, you had about $7.5
million in investments in policies. When I looked at the Q, I noticed that I think it's
about $5 million in the first nine months of the year was used to purchase policies to
settle claims, I was hoping you could shed some light on that $5 million?


<A - Brian Pardo>: That was Colorado, I believe and what Colorado want to do is
they claimed that this a security which we just agree with, but to settle the issue we
just had to look if anybody wants to sell their policies back to us, at their statutory
rate of interest, we'll just – we'll buy it.


<Q - John Nobile>: All right. So that's more or less a one-time item or there still could
be a few more policies that might trickle in?


<A - Brian Pardo>: Yes, there could be, but we are buying in anyway.


Back to LPHI’s 10Q:


LPI has made repurchase offers to certain Colorado purchasers, some of whom
have accepted the offer. Under the terms of the settlement, the purchasers that
accepted the repurchase offer will receive statutory interest on the repurchase
amount. We estimate the interest will be approximately $1,549,000, which will
increase our basis in Investments in Policies.


Serious questions remain surrounding the method LPHI uses to account for repurchased
policies. If LPHI recognized revenue and earnings when they sold the policies to their
clients, they should have taken a charge for these earnings related to the $5 million
repurchased (in addition to future repurchases and interest payments).


Assuming LPHI charged their investors 40% gross sale amount (or around 15% of face),
LPHI would have recognized $2 million of revenue on these transactions. Assuming an
operating margin consistent with the 3Q08 of 39%, LPHI recognized $750,000 of pretax or
$0.03 per share related to these transactions. If LPHI had to buy the policies back, how
are these profits not reversed?


According the Colorado lawsuit, LPHI
5/22/2018 Challenge to Life Partners' Auditor: Address Red Flags - Life Partners Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LPHI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/133531-challenge-to-life-partners-auditor-address-red-flags 6/9


collectively have obtained more than $11,500,000 from approximately 114 Colorado
investors to purchase viatical settlements.


The same assumptions as above, if LPHI repurchased all $11.5 million, this would equate
to $4.6 million of revenue, $1.8 mm of pretax profits or $0.08 per share (16% of 3Q08
earnings). Using a 39% operating margin assumes LPHI would be able to recollect fees
paid out to licensees and recollect sunk costs. Assuming that they could not recapture
these costs, a 100% of gross revenue charge equals $0.20 per share or 41% of 3Q
earnings.


While the charges above are not massive sums, the treatment of LPHI’s repurchases does
create another startling red flag regarding LPHI’s accounting and creates additional
questions. For example, are there other occasions where management sold policies to
clients, recognized revenue and profits, and later repurchased the policies?


3) More Questions Regarding CEO


In LPHI’s “Citron Response”, management stated that Brian Pardo entered into a consent
decree relating to the sanctioning by the SEC for revenue recognition reporting issues “in
order to resolve the issue amicably.” The South Florida Business Journal suggests that he
agreed because the company was already in bankruptcy:


The SEC filed a complaint against Pardo and his company Ask Corp. of Waco,
charging him with falsifying financial reports to shareholders. Prado consented to the
SEC's charges. By then, Ask Corp., a heating and air-conditioning company, already
had filed for bankruptcy.


Another oddity about LPHI's CEO Brian Pardo is the address and location of Pardo's trust.


According to SEC filings, the Pardo Family Trust is located in Gibraltar. A simple google
address search shows that the Pardo Family trust shares an address with online gambling
websites (allpro.com, eBets.com, allhorseracing.com, etc.). The implications of having his
trust in a protected offshore location is unclear. However, it does provide another potential
red flag for investors.


In another strange turn of events for Brian Pardo and Life Partners. On April 8  2009,
Pardo and Life Partners filed a $50 million lawsuit against a Yahoo! Message Board
poster. While I do not agree with the statements Mr. Kane made on the message board, I

Public Notice to Eide Bailly
In recent accounting scandals and frauds, the accounting firms have shared significant
blame in perpetrating and extending dubious actions by corporate managers. I want this to
serve as a Public Notice to Eide Bally. There are significant red flags associated with
LPHI’s management and business practices. The auditors at Eide Bally are in a position to
verify or refute these concerns. Let this also serve as a Public Record, Eide Bailly is in a
position to protect current and future LPHI customers and investors. If some of these
concerns and red flags turn out to be verified at a later date, and Eide Bailly missed them,
let this provide a record so that customers and investors can hold Eide Bailly accountable.
A lot of people were exposed to Madoff after Harry Markopolos first raised his concerns to
people in position to protect investors; I hope the same does not occur now that the red
flags have been raised for Eide Bailly to observe.


Disclosure: Short LPHI with a borrow

Many industry participants do not disclose their fees. If the policy owner knew how much the broker and provider were
making in the transaction, they would most likely not sign the contract. Milestone Providers LLC, a life settlement
provider out of PA, was the first firm to require full disclosure of all fees to the consumer.


Milestone is a firm believer that open and transparent transactions are an important way to bring credibility to this
industry. The firm implies a maximum commission structure on each transaction for brokers, reducing their
commission to the lesser of 6% of the face value of the policy or 33% of the net value added in the transaction.


While the firm is privately held, Milestone's set commission structure in the transaction is typically 1-2% of the face
value. For more information on life settlements or our firm visit www.milestonesett lements... or call 1-888-877-5686.

Another potential red flag for the auditors would be LPHI's partnership with German bank WestLB. According to Life
Settlements Wire, WestLB has purchased policies with an aggregate face value of $425M since Sept 07 through
LPHI.


lifesettlements.dealfl... (4th story down)


If this is true, then 50% of LPHI's business since Sept 07 has been with one customer, WestLB. Since WestLB was
not disclosed as a 10% or greater customer in last year's 10-K then we can assume that WestLB accounted for a
minimum of 68% of LPHI's business in the first 9 mos of this fiscal year. Importantly, WestLB has been struggling for
some time with toxic assets and is currently attempting to sell off pieces of itself in an auction.


dealbook.blogs.nytimes.../


If LPHI does actually have such large exposure to an institution whose viability is in question, then the company's
auditors should certainly require a disclosure.

West LB didn't purchase policies from LifePartners, they hired LPHI as a consultant so they could purchase
policies for themselves. Your calculations are way off.

is it possible that you work for the federal government and have the opinion that 'what the market bears' is illegal or
improper. The life settlements business is arguably a puzzling business, but upon study of it's core industry, one
would find that there are statutes in place to protect sellers of their polices. Also, LPHI doesn't have to be a public
company, but has chosen to do so. Yes, the way you have presented the material, it appears there are some issues,
but anyone could do this about just about any company and find similar results. I personally believe you are jealous of
a company that has found a nitch in putting buyers and sellers together, acting as a broker. I'm not saying nothing is
suspect, but I wonder how your comments would be affected if you, in fact, visited the company and its officers
personally, or interviewed many of the policyholders that have rec'd needed funds over the years, because a
company has found a legitimate way to put buyers and sellers together to get funds to someone in need. God bless
the accounting firm and LPHI, as I hope they both prove your comments very biased and just plane jealous of a
company making a good profit....for everyone involved in the process.

I think the insurance companies are somehow involved in the bashing of LPHI ; certainly it is in their best interests to
do so because, according to my insurance agent, many policies are allowed to expire because of the very high
premiums at this stage of life. Now, the insurance companies will have to pay off instead of getting the windfall from
lapsed policies and you can bet they don' like that.
