Lumber Liquidators, Formaldehyde And Asbestos
Apr. 9, 2015 2:25 PM ET102 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


Summary


Some are claiming that Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate "just doesn’t
emit harmful levels (of formaldehyde) in the home" and thus "there won’t be any sick
people."


But the evidence – both from tests and anecdotally – contradicts this assertion.


It is highly likely, I believe, that Lumber Liquidators’ Chinese-made laminate has
been (and still is) emitting harmful levels in many customers' homes and is causing
serious adverse health effects.


Exposure to formaldehyde, however, is not as serious as exposure to asbestos.


But unlike most companies associated with asbestos, who had no idea that it was
dangerous, I think it’s highly likely that the senior managers of Lumber Liquidators
knew that they were buying toxic, formaldehyde-drenched, non-CARB compliant
laminate from their Chinese suppliers, knowingly putting untold numbers of
American families at risk.


I recently received an email from a friend in the flooring industry who "hates" Lumber
Liquidators (NYSE:LL), but disagrees with my view that the stock is a compelling short
today. I think he makes some good points, which echo what I've heard from other bulls on
the stock, so in the spirit of stimulating a healthy debate, I'm sharing his email (with
permission) and my reply. He wrote:

On the liability side there won't be any sick people. This stuff just doesn't emit
harmful levels in the home. If 60 Minutes had aired "little Johnny" with no hair, a
respirator and a missing limb, Lumber Liquidators would be out of business before
Memorial Day; but that scenario won't occur. Ergo, there aren't any real damages.


So, if the regulators won't force Lumber Liquidators to shut down (I think we are both
in agreement about this) and the liability on the civil side is reasonably limited
because nobody has really been harmed, then why are you short the stock? Yes,
you may be right about a $15-20 valuation on $1.25-1.50 of earnings per share this
year, but once some of the legal risk is quantified, don't you think there's likely to be
multiple expansion?


The average Lumber Liquidators customer isn't very bright because a quick Google
search reveals endless terrible reviews and complaints. So this company is
accustomed to navigating a jungle of negative headwinds every single day.
Eventually people will forget this and these guys will survive.


Listen, I hate these guys... (but) the risk/reward seems to be on the side of reward...


I replied:


If you are right that Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate "just doesn't emit
harmful levels (of formaldehyde) in the home" and thus "there won't be any sick
people," then I might agree that Lumber Liquidators' stock is not a good short. But, I
don't think you are.


Adverse Health Effects Associated With Formaldehyde Exposure


Let's start with a general overview of the adverse health effects associated with exposure
to high levels of formaldehyde. Here's what I wrote in my article, A Response to Lumber
Liquidators:


For starters, read what the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have to say about formaldehyde: it can cause "watery eyes;
burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat; coughing; wheezing; nausea; and
skin irritation," "upper respiratory tract irritation (that) can potentially exacerbate
asthma symptoms and other respiratory illnesses," "chronic runny nose, chronic
bronchitis, and obstructive lung disease," and is a "known human carcinogen"
associated with "several cancers, including nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3059966-lumber-liquidators-formaldehyde-and-asbestos 3/34


This chart, in a report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, summarizes it nicely:


To be clear however: my friend isn't disputing the adverse health effects associated with
exposure to high levels of formaldehyde (nor, I suspect, the results of the deconstructive
tests that I, 60 Minutes and others have commissioned). Rather, he's saying "This stuff
(Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate) just doesn't emit harmful levels in the
home."


Does Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-Made Laminate Emit Harmful Levels of
Formaldehyde in the Home?


His assertion, however, isn't supported by the only evidence we have: the three emissions
tests 60 Minutes commissioned, evaluating the formaldehyde level in a typical home with
Lumber Liquidators' Chinese-made laminate flooring, which revealed formaldehyde levels
of 57, 93 and 268 ppb - all of which are "massively higher than the limits regulators have
set to protect everyone, including children," as I documented in my article, Answering
Questions About Lumber Liquidators.


When 60 Minutes showed the results of these tests to Dr. Philip Landrigan, one of the
world's leading experts on exposure to toxic chemicals, here's what he said:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3059966-lumber-liquidators-formaldehyde-and-asbestos 4/34


I would say long-term exposure at that level would be risky because it would
increase the risk for chronic respiratory irritation, change in a person's lung function,
increased risk of asthma. It's not going to produce symptoms in everyone but
children will be the people most likely to show symptoms at that sort of level.


Moving from the theoretical to the actual, while this is anecdotal, here are some of the
awful symptoms that have been reported on a single web site by Lumber Liquidators'
customers (as I first reported in my article, Lumber Liquidators is Evil):


…our dogs have developed allergies and my youngest daughter who will be 4 in
August has been running a fever like an off and on switch every few weeks... she runs
a high fever for a couple of days then she's OK until the next episode. I'm not sure if
this has to do with the flooring. I'm almost speechless on one hand. I want to rip the
floor out on the other hand we don't have the money to put flooring back in... So at this
point I'm not sure what to do.
I had head and chest congestion the whole time we were installing the floor. My friends
teased me that maybe I was allergic to the floor. I was at the doctors so many times
that he sent me to an allergist. Severe symptoms subsided when we finished putting
down the floor. But I still use an inhaler when I exercise.
My symptoms are burning eyes and nose and coughing up phlem at night. Also have
itchy skin. My two dogs also cough. I thought they had kennel cough, but now think it is
the flooring… Open your windows and air the place out frequently, especially before
bed. Then pray this gets settled soon as I read that the off gassing can last 10 years.
I was doing some reading of scientific papers on this formaldehyde effects, wondering
two things. 1. Could my tremors that I have had for the past few months be related to
this? Sadly, yes. It also causes neurological damage. 2. How long does outgasing go
on with a product like laminate flooring. Bad news again. It was estimated to be in the
10-year range.
…we have had boughts of sore throats, burning eyes and my son and I always have
stuffy, runny noses.
…the itching was so severe I literally had scratches all over my body - it was insane…
…my husband…has had MAJOR skin issues…
…our children and dogs and I have had multiple issues…
My husband has had major skin issues since installation (he installed it).
We both have runny noses and burning eyes.
Has anyone else had a 24/7 headache that started soon after installing their floors?
Yes and runny nose cough. Very nasty.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3059966-lumber-liquidators-formaldehyde-and-asbestos 5/34


Thus, I think the evidence - both from tests and anecdotally - contradicts my friend's
assertion that "This stuff just doesn't emit harmful levels in the home" and thus "there
won't be any sick people."


Dr. Philip Landrigan's Comments


I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Landrigan last week and he answered many of my
questions. First, I showed him the symptoms described by the 12 Lumber Liquidators
customers above, and asked if they were consistent with exposure to elevated levels of
formaldehyde. He replied:


Yes, they are consistent, but causation can't be proved when an individual person
reports a symptom in relation to an exposure. Usually the only way to determine
causality in those cases is to put the case before a jury.


I also asked him how long it might take for laminate with formaldehyde at the levels shown
by the 60 Minutes' testing to "off-gas" down to safe levels. He estimated "three to six
months." (The Consumer Product Safety Commission is in the same ballpark, noting that
"Emissions (from pressed wood and wood-based products) decrease 6-10 months after
initial testing").


Finally, I asked him: "Even after the exposure ends and the symptoms go away, can there
be long-lasting effects from formaldehyde exposure at the levels shown by 60 Minutes'
testing?" His answer:


It's unclear. One study showed that children exposed to highly polluted air in Los
Angeles, even after the air quality improved, had permanently smaller lung capacity
and greater likelihood of certain diseases later in life, so I would say that there's
certainly the possibility of long-term effects, but this won't be known for sure for
decades.


In summary, if the testing that I, 60 Minutes and others have done is correct, then Lumber
Liquidators is poisoning its customers and installers with a dangerous chemical and
known carcinogen that's likely causing many of them a range of adverse health effects,
some even debilitating and requiring medical attention, with possible long-lasting effects.


Partially offsetting this, however, are three mitigating factors: a) formaldehyde, at the
levels and length of exposure at issue here, is unlikely to cause cancer; b) the most
common symptoms can be caused by many things, not just formaldehyde, so in court the



http://bit.ly/1apZg0r

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3059966-lumber-liquidators-formaldehyde-and-asbestos 6/34


company will surely claim other causes for its customers' ailments; and c) formaldehyde
dissipates ("off-gasses") in 3-10 months.


Similarities and Differences with Asbestos


Thus, for these three reasons, Lumber Liquidators' problem, while serious, isn't as serious
as asbestos because: a) exposure to asbestos can cause a much more serious illness:
mesothelioma, an often-deadly form of cancer; b) asbestos exposure is pretty much the
only way to get mesothelioma; and, c) asbestos doesn't off-gas in the environment, nor
does it dissipate in the body.


This is all great news for Lumber Liquidators and its customers and installers, but it
doesn't mean the company is off the hook. Many, many people - perhaps tens of
thousands, maybe more - have likely been harmed and suffered many of the symptoms
outlined above, which range from unpleasant to debilitating.


But in one critical way, things may be much worse for Lumber Liquidators than for the
companies associated with asbestos. Asbestos wasn't known to be a dangerous product
when most of these companies were mining, using and/or installing it, so they could
honestly claim that they had no idea they were endangering their employees and
customers.


In contrast, as I wrote in my latest article, Did Lumber Liquidators Know It Was Selling
Toxic Laminate?, I think it's highly likely that the senior managers of Lumber Liquidators
knew that they were buying toxic, formaldehyde-drenched, non-CARB compliant laminate
from their Chinese suppliers, knowingly putting untold numbers of American families at
risk.


If they knew - and this information becomes public - the result could be not only an
implosion of the company but also big financial penalties and even criminal charges
against the company and its executives.


PS - I no longer read the message boards for the articles I publish. I do, however, want to
hear thoughtful comments and questions so I invite my readers to communicate with me
via Seeking Alpha messaging and I will post my answers on the message board.

Whitney, my advice: relax and find a different target for a little while. Re-evaluate when there is more news. You've
beaten this horse enough, consider how nice variety will feel. Maybe if you are truly concerned about product quality,
try looking for other companies besides LL that are committing similar errors. People know about the LL issue, so it's
not worth stressing out about anymore.

Unfortunately I don think this has anything to do with LL anymore. Tilson is fighting for his reputation now. I
think he realizes me messed up and overplayed his hand. But now he can't back track without losing face. So
he has to press on no matter what facts comes out.

Tilson got in front of a brilliant short and made a ton of money. As a fund manager that isn't a bad thing at all. I
think there is little risk of the stock soaring back north of $100 so why not hold on? The fireworks may have
only just started.

north of $100? on margins of 7%? That seems ridiculous. Double in price to $60? That seems realistic and
probable.

Did U Think The Ponzi Scheme Would Last?
This could easily double if a short squeeze takes hold. EASILY. The only question is whether it takes one
more big step down first. But nothing goes straight up or down and this has been going down for a long time
now. If there were people coming out of the woodwork (pun intended) talking about how sick they were then it
would be one thing but we all know that California CARB standards are very strict, probably overly so, in
order to give the state control over society's producers all in the false name of helping the people. California
has warning signs above drinking fountains in some places telling people that the water might contain cancer
causing agents. California is a ridiculous liberal mess of corruption and their laws should all be taken with a
grain of salt relative to the real world.

nakedjaybird
Whitney - what you have not done is determine what the regulated product standards and qualified and
controlled process limits are for US manufacturers levels for formaldehyde laminates nor what they do in their
processing to allow for formaldehyde off-gassing prior to shipping product and the level of product off-gassing
permitted at that time for a particular set of conditions to be a safe consumer product meeting permissible
limits at and/or from the source. Knowing how and where etc., such product is finally installed and the
ventilation available, room temperatures, or the volume and tightness of the enclosure brings variables which
real engineers don't bother with. They look and the product as it leaves the factory where things are
CONTROLLED. At most, some statistics may be used to establish shippable product standards, but the
actual off-gassing will be known and permissible standards met. When you are armed with that data then you
can backtrack the product LL peddles all the way to the manufacturer and report some meaningful facts,
should you be so fortunate. Or, the regulators can measure and compare the LL product to standards already
known at the regulated shippers factory conditions. The violators will be visible. If the LL product was shipped
too soon, etc., their numbers may be high. This is a scientifically measured condition. Go get the meaningful
or real facts. Beings "as installed" conditions could be all over the map go measure at the source.

Oh sheez...another article. I noticed how you didn't respond to my response to your attacks on Ray Cotton from your
last article. Smart man.


For those who didn't read his diatribe....basically Ray is supposedly in cahoots with LL to purposely unleash the
cancer on children and dogs. But Ray's profile shows he a supporter of ASPCA, was a Big Brother, St. Jude's
hospital, etc. So I'm trying to figure out why a guy, who is LL's compliance officer, with the interest of the safety, curing
of disease and welfare of children and animals would unleash the cancer monster upon them?


Mr. Tilson has declined to respond.


Onto this article:


The symptoms you're describing define almost anyone who has ever had an allergy to anything in the air (ie pollen). If
there is mold or mildew in the house they'd experience these same physical symptoms. Finally, you're going to have
to prove the source of this comes from the flooring and not everything else on the planet that produces formaldehyde
(from the EPA):


Where formaldehyde is found 
Formaldehyde is found in:


Resins used in the manufacture of composite wood products (i.e., hardwood plywood, particleboard and medium-
density fiberboard) 
Building materials and insulation 
Household products such as glues, permanent press fabrics, paints and coatings, lacquers and finishes, and paper
products 
Preservatives used in some medicines, cosmetics and other consumer products such as dishwashing liquids and
fabric softeners 
Fertilizers and pesticides 
It is a byproduct of combustion and certain other natural processes, and so is also found in: 
Emissions from un-vented, fuel burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. 
Cigarette smoke. 
-----------------------


That's a heck of a lot of sources. LL has 600,000 customers per year. I think 19% of those sales are laminate.
Wouldn't there be an epidemic of monstrous proportions by now? Yet from all those past years...only 10K people want
free tests? That doesn't sound to dire. That sounds like the average hypochondriac population of the USA:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3059966-lumber-liquidators-formaldehyde-and-asbestos 10/34


"A person who suffers from hypochondriasis believes that his or her physical symptoms, either real or imagined, are
signs of a much more serious illness, despite medical reassurance that they are not. According to experts, the
prevalence of hypochondria ranges from 4 percent to 7 percent in the general population, affecting both men and
women equally."


Shall we wager that Mr. Tilson and the 10K tests fall into this 4-7% range.


I believe so.

LL stock has now gained twice in two days after he publishes on SA.


Even his fellow shorts are asking.."Wait...THIS is the guy that's supposedly helping us pave the way to new

From 1:32 - 1:42PM LL spiked from $33.82 to $34.40. I don't know why exactly. Does anyone know?

allergy facts and figures indicate that one in five Americans has an "allergy" of some sort.


were any of the individuals in the examples cited in your article treated prior to their flooring installation for allergies /
asthma? is it possible that the individual was allergic to formaldehyde (in any form) but unaware until the flooring
installation?


Aside from the flooring, were there any other formaldehyde based products in their homes? Have they suffered from
the flu in the past year? Do they get regular flu shots? Does their doggy visit a kennel, dog park or doggy daycare?


will plaintiffs undergo allergy testing? will plaintiffs turn over medical records? if a child is experiencing symptoms,
does either parent suffer from an allergy?


were containers of flooring opened prior to installation (outside the home) in order to gass-off? after installing floors,
were proper ventilation procedures followed?


questions, questions. so many questions.

I have a BS and MS degree in Chemistry. I used to make the formaldehyde resins (UF, MF and PF used to bond
wood particles together for various wood composite boards (HDF, MDF, particle board, plywood, etc). I also worked in
R&D for a major, world wide laminate supplier that made the print sheets for flooring, furniture, etc. I have personally
made


Mr. Tilson is bordering on lying with his assertions about the risk posed to customers. Tilson leaves out the fact that all
of the testing done by LL had to be done by 3rd parties. For his thesis to hold up not only would LL have to be
complicit in the mislabeling, but the independent lab would also have to be in collusion (this refutes his claims that all
of LL own data is doctored or otherwise untrustworthy). This would potentially risk the accrediation of the lab, so I give
that scenario a HIGHLY unlikely probablility.


As mentioned by other persons on this website, the testing that 60 Minutes and Tilson performed is NOT the test used
to determine if product is CARB 2 compliant. The test method that LL, Raymond James and ALL OF THE ENTIRE
INDUSTRY USES will be the final say, which just so happens to be the test the CPSC is going to use to evaluate LL's
product.


Mr. Tilson continues to claim that he won't be "wasting" any more time on this topic. He has since "published"
numerous articles/posts since he has made this assertion, which would lead one to believe that something is wrong
with him or he is indeed becoming desparate (might be one in the same).

According to this document: 
http://bit.ly/1KZ6A3S


CARB requires all finished goods, such as flooring, to be made using complying composite wood products.


The fundamental flaw with the testing being done by Lumber Liquidators, Torlys and others is they are only
testing the top surface layer and sealing off all other 5 surfaces with a stainless steel plate and foil tape.


There is no HDF laminate floor board installed in anyone's home that has foil tape around all edges, and a
stainless steel plate at the bottom. So this clearly is not a real-world test.


And who knows what has been done to the floor board before the testing. Possibly they heated it up, causing
it off gas significantly and they washed off the top surface. I have no proof of this last point, but it would not be
surprising if that is done in order to take down the formaldehyde level.


These documents make it very clear that that a deconstructive process is absolutely required to determine if
the finished good is CARB 2 compliant: 
http://bit.ly/1DlHCr5


http://bit.ly/1DlHCr5


Testing the top surface only and disregarding the rest of the board is simply not a real-world test. The
California Air Resources Board agrees with this as the documents state.

The testing done by CBS news and others has shown the core boards being used by LL Chinese made
laminates to have formaldehyde levels up to 20 times over the CARB Phase 2 formaldehyde emission
standard for composite wood products. Despite what you may think, this is a real problem!


The fact that people are being affected by these high formaldehyde floorboards, overwhelmingly proves this.
The basis of many of these lawsuits against LL are the symptoms encountered by the occupants of the home
where the LL floorboards exist.


In my case, the floorboards did not come from Lumber Liquidators, but Torlys instead and they did cause me
numerous serious symptoms:

If someone wants to advance the science and knowledge with respect to exposure in the home, do testing of
formaldehyde gas in the homes where it is installed. Especially where the inhabitants are getting symptoms, only
testing of the interior air can determine if there is exposure to toxic dosages. Until there are factual data, the
anecdotes are just so much speculation without any basis.


09 Apr 2015, 04:05 PM


Jon45150
Tilson is being repetitive, so I will too:


At this point the only facts that matter are the following: 
1) The formaldehyde levels are only high if the flooring is ripped down to the core. 
2) Destroying the floors is not normal use nor exposure. 
3) CARB does not require destructive testing and have already explained this on their web site.


I could go on to argue that CARB only has jurisdiction in California and the EPA does not regulate formaldehyde
levels in flooring, but given the above three facts that point is moot.


The analogy that doduhdew makes regarding gasoline could be tweaked to better fit this situation:


CARB requires that automakers not allow the fuel vapors outside of the vehicle to exceed a certain level, so Tilson
removes the gas cap, dunks the vapor sensor into the tank and screams, "SHORT GM! THEIR VEHICLES EXCEED
EMISSION LEVELS!!"

IMO Lumber Liquidators has standing to sue Tilson for libel, especially when he makes such hyperbolic statements in
his conclusion.


DISCLOSURES: 
- I do NOT work for LL. 
- I have never bought any flooring from LL, although I would have no problem doing so if we needed new flooring. 
- I am bullish on the stock given the three simple facts stated above.

I think we all need to cut Whit some slack here. For many months he has been doing due diligence on engineered

From what I saw on 60 Minutes, Whit works out of a very small space that seemed to have few opportunities for off-
gassing. So, doesn't it seem likely that his cubicle-with-four-wall... has filled with formaldehype -- I mean
formaldehyde (sorry for typo)? Is Whitney a Wall Street version of Bruce Banner, injecting himself with the flooring

Just some points of clarification:


1. In addition to the health effects you listed, formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen. It has been classified as
such by the pre-eminent agencies that evaluate cancer - the US National Toxicology Program and the International
Agency for Research on Cancer.


2. The asbestos producers knew that asbestos caused mesothelioma and continued to distribute it.


3. A somewhat closer analogy for the lumber liquidator problem is the chinese drywall debacle that happened about
10 years ago. Knauf imported poorly made drywall that was subsequently sold in retail stores, and emitted hydrogen
sulfide and a few other offensive chemicals. The company quickly got on top of the issue, and worked to replace
drywall in affected homes.


4. A lot of stuff in our homes emits formaldehyde into the air - basically anything made with pressed wood products
might release formaldehyde. Since homes tend to be somewhat more airtight than in the past, it is important to limit
the combined sources of formaldehyde - which is why there are standards for consumer products.


5. Anecdotal reports from consumers are notoriously unreliable. If a consumer learns that LL products might be a
problem, often they will exhibit psychosomatic symptoms. Nevertheless, about 5% of all people become sensitized to
chemicals like formaldehyde.


6. Criminal charges don't seem like a real possibility, although if LL knew that their product was contaminated,
consumer tort litigation is likely.

I have no positions in LL and don't plan on ever having any. Having said that, I've seen these articles over the last few
weeks and haven't commented until today, where it seems the author now wishes to begin discussing scientific
matters.


The first thing I noticed is the rather high variability in the formaldehyde levels and the limited sample size. Three
samples? And they range from 57 to 268 ppb. Before declaring that it's time to panic, I would hope someone would
take more than three samples and really determine what level is most frequently encountered.


Regarding the levels found in those three samples, I have taken toxicology courses and decided to look into my,
"bible", Casarett and Doull's. Apparently, the no observed effect level is 50 ppb. Following a dose-response curve
related to lung function, readily observable effects that the author mentions don't begin to take place until 2 to 3 ppm,
which is beyond what was found in those three samples. Apparently, some can detect the odor of the compound as
low as 500 ppb.


Now, I do see a description in the text of reports in the industry of irritation occurring as low as 50 ppb. Perhaps some
become sensitized due to large and frequent exposure, but I'm merely speculating. And in addition, children in homes
with 60 ppb had mildly lower scores on a certain measure of lung function compared to those exposed to 50 ppb or
less.


It seems there is some risk, especially for children, with respect to irritation of the lungs and perhaps allergenic
responses in the range as that found in the LL products. Certainly, this is concerning, but keep in mind that the reason
for the study of formaldehyde in the home is because of its near ubiquitous presence in building materials.


Certainly, the increased risk for allergies and alterations in lung function after chronic or long-term exposure to those
levels of formaldehyde in the home is something to avoid. I personally wouldn't want a product with over 50 ppb in a
home with children. But, I wish the author would stop with the hyperbole. I find it to be irritating, but it seems this is
always the case with stories like this. The risk is greatly exaggerated to cause fear and panic. Journalists, dare I call
them that, do this with just about all forms of media today.

It's clear from the IARC monograph, as I suspected, the issue of cancer is related to high levels of
occupational exposure. I hope the author, or anyone else for that matter, isn't seriously implying that the levels
of exposure seen with the LL products (even the 3 limited samples) are going to increase the risk for cancer.

Far from Mr Tilson's comparison to asbestos, the Report on Carcinogens for formaldehyde finds occupational
exposure only to be statistically significant with mainly nasal cancer, which is very rare. However, it is hard to
believe that there have not been asbestos comparable class action lawsuits for formaldehyde exposure
based upon the levels shown in the last paragraph of the article referred above by Zheeeem; "In the late
1980s, OSHA estimated that over 2 million U.S. workers were exposed to formaldehyde, about 45% of whom
worked in the garment industry (USDL 2009). OSHA estimated that about 1.9 million workers were exposed
to formaldehyde at concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 ppm, 123,000 at 0.5 to 0.75 ppm, and 84,000 at 0.75
to 1 ppm (WHO 2002). No current data were found for occupational exposure to formaldehyde in the United
States."

Wow. This is what scares me about people googling their way around without having a clue what they're
looking at.


First, this is not a study. It's a guideline from Health Canada based upon a review of the literature. And it's a
guideline for children indicating that they believe an exposure limit below 40 ppb should be followed. I also
noticed that this hasn't been updated since 2006. And it doesn't comport with recent reviews by larger, global
organizations.


The study they use to rely upon that exposure limit for children is the Rumchev et al. paper from 2002. The
Rumchev et al study (I indirectly mentioned this paper in other posts) found that children exposed to
formaldehyde concentrations at 50 ppb or greater were at an increased risk of asthma. However, in 2004,
Rumchev et al also found a strong association in these same children and their exposure to benzene and
VOC concentrations in general. Due to these confounders, it's not possible to tease out which compound or
whether an additive or synergistic effect between all of these chemicals was responsible for the increased
risk. It's not possible to determine a causal role in such a case and therein lies the danger of assuming that an
association is causal.


And again, this was in children, not adults.

Just FYI, formaldehyde has been classified by the US government as a known human carcinogen. You might have

My reply:


In my article I noted that formaldehyde is a "known human carcinogen” associated with “several cancers, including
nasopharyngeal cancer and leukemia,” and cancer is also listed in the CPSC table I included.


But, according to Dr. Landrigan, formaldehyde only causes cancer at much higher levels, over much longer periods of
time (for example, in a chemical factory) than any Lumber Liquidators customer would ever be exposed to.


It's possible that some of Lumber Liquidators’ installers might have had much higher exposure because they are
working with toxic laminate regularly (probably every week, maybe more) and, worse yet, are cutting it with electric
saws in an enclosed area (like a home or apartment), creating and breathing in fine powder from the core of the
laminate, which is where the formaldehyde is.


But until I have some facts about how many installers were exposed to how much formaldehyde, or I hear of installers
getting the types of cancer associated with formaldehyde, I think it's safest to assume that cancer is NOT one of the
many contingent liabilities Lumber Liquidators faces.


But I’m for sure looking for more information here, especially as it relates to installers.

Ok, yes, thank you Mr. Tilson. I was left scratching my head before I read this comment. And regarding
installers, that would be where the best chance would lie for increased risk of cancer. But, it would require a
great deal of epidemiological work to look for such an association. The IARC data generally show much
higher exposure levels that what the LL product emits, so I suspect even that is a stretch, but perhaps if there
is a perfect storm of sorts, exposure levels could rise to a level sufficient to increase the rate of cancer.

Actually the science says the causal relationship between dose and cancer is not time dependent. Long term
exposure did not result in a significant increase over short term. Meta data analysis revealed that people who
worked in factories that had dangerous levels of formaldehyde in the air had a dramatically increased cancer
rate but not much different if they worked 2 years or 20 years. People that are susceptible will develop
disease but most will not develop disease. LL should give a free set of dice with every purchase.

it's every human being's responsibility to question or substantiate what might constitute a health threat. 
To assume that the complaints are sourced from Hypochondriacs is lame. LL could have nipped this in the bud

Obviously people who don't like the message want to shoot the messenger. Not until Ralph Nadir wrote the book.
"Unsafe at any speed" did GM discontinue production of the Corvair. Whitney Tilson like Ralph Nadir were never
popular for their public service. A landmark formaldehyde study (found on Pub Med.gov and published in May 2010)
on formaldehyde levels in rats and humans concluded the rate of nasal cancer was highly non linear. In English that
means that exposure to higher doses or even longer term exposure to lower levels did not result in an expected dose
dependent HIGHER incidences of nasal cancer but otherwise had a causal relationship based on exposure. Genetics
has proven to be the reason why drugs like plavix is therapeutic for one person at a certain dose, nontherapeutic to
another person at the same dose and harmful for another at that same dose. Receptors are different in different
people. Now that pricing has dropped, more doctors are doing genetic testing before prescribing some medications
that are activated by certain receptors subject to genetic variants called polymorphisms.


A friend of mine remembered playing outside in Arizona as a child and being drenched by a cloud they later
discovered was the result of above ground radioactive testing. Her family owned a dairy and 33 members of her
family and workers have died from cancer forms commonly linked to radiation exposure. The first nuclear tests in the
50's involved air balloons so the radioactive clouds traveled significant distances. Only after she died in the hospital
40 years later did they discover her thyroid cancer had eaten through into the spine and she suffocated to death from
leaking cerebral spinal fluid at age 45. But the fact is not every child or person that drank the cow milk or was exposed

But back to the study, epidemiological studies reported no incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer in humans below a
mean level of 1 PPM and peak level of 4 PPM. Rat studies indicate that cytotoxicity-induced cell proliferation at 1 ppm
is a key mechanism in development of nasal cancer. CARB compliant is 7 PPM or lower. The European guidelines of
the World Health Organization is 0.08 PPM, well below CARB compliance standards. Installing a floor in the home is
similar to deconstructing a piece of laminate wood. 60 minutes reported some of the deconstructed samples emitted

2000 PPM. If you go to the Lumber Liquidators website and look at laminate flooring (and I don't recommend this
because every web page I open now has LL adds and popups) on the bottom lists suggested items to purchase with
the floor and includes tools, gloves etc but does not even hint a DIY homeowner should buy any kind of mask.
California recommends a complete respirator mask for installation. Based on the 60 Minute data, installing a LL floor
made in China is "unsafe at any speed." I pray the Consumer Product Safety Commission does the right thing now to
prevent health problems that will occur years later, cost lives and unknown health care dollars.

"Not until Ralph Nadir wrote the book Unsafe At Any Speed did GM discontinue production of the Corvair.
Whitney Tilson, like Ralph Nadir, were never popular for their public service."


Perfect example, but not for the reason you think. In 1972, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
exonerated the Corvair of Nader's trumped up safety allegations. After careful study of the data, the
Administration found that the Corvair was no more unsafe than similar car models of that era.


Tilson and Nader share common attributes: both are experts at using the media to promote their agenda, and
both exhibit ignorance of the nuances of science and statistics.

Are you sure you have your 'part per' correct? In the above article, Mr. Tilson asked a doctor what exposure to
268 parts per billion would do to people.


Your study on cancers indicate parts per million. I do believe there is some irritation and harm above 1 ppm.
However, that orders of magnitude above the CARB regulation.

I'll attempt to clean up what you wrote:


A non-linear relationship simply means that the compound doesn't fit a typical dose-response curve. This
makes risk assessment more difficult and is the reason for debate and modifications over the years.


As for SNP's, you are correct that they can account for inter-individual differences in humans when it comes
to how a compound is metabolized in the body and the effects upon the body. But, you appear to be
attempting to create a bridge between the two (formaldehyde and established concentrations known to be
safe) with such a blanket statement. Not all SNP's will have an effect. In fact, differences in FDH made no
difference in mutagenic potential. That's not to say that differences in sensitivity don't exist, but I think you
should be careful before implying what it may be due to. That's not scientific.

And to correct your comment, no, receptors themselves are generally not different between people.
Polymorphisms that you speak of are concerning drug-metabolizing enzymes. Although, it is possible that the
expression of receptors in a given tissue can differ between individuals causing differences in sensitivity.
Functionality of a given receptor, might also be different, but the receptors themselves are not different. An
adrenergic receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, etc., in my body is the same as in yours. We
may have different tissue concentrations and their functionality might differ downstream after binding and
initiation, but that's not what you were saying.


After reviewing two papers (links below), it's clear formaldehyde in the range of 80-100 ppb is considered the
level at which it is unlikely that humans will experience any sensory irritation and certainly, unequivocally, this
level is agreed upon to be below any level which could increase the risk of cancer. In fact, as you correctly
noted, increased cancer risk in humans doesn't take place until you get into single digit ppm concentrations. I
also found that the original paper I had read regarding children's risk for decreased lung function above 50
ppb may have had various confounders that weren't taken into account (e.g. VOC's). It's difficult to tease out
individual chemicals in such observational studies. I'd still try to keep the formaldehyde levels as low as
possible in my home, however.


And finally, for those that don't know, formaldehyde is present in all living things, including humans. It's
naturally produced in humans and present in our exhaled breath in very low ppb's. I say this not to imply that
because it's present naturally in our environment and produced by humans (endogenously) and exhaled, it is
safe. That's of course not true. But, I fear some might believe it's some foreign compound that humans aren't
exposed to otherwise.


As far as the LL products, based upon the WHO and other authorities, exposure in the home to
concentrations beyond the 80-100 ppb range could cause sensory irritation in some. But, no risk for cancer at
that range and no evidence of risk at least several orders of magnitude higher than that. The sample reported
by the media coverage that exceeded this range is something I most definitely wouldn't want in my home. But,
again, therein lies the problem of only having a sample size of 3 and such a large variance.

Once damage to human tissues start, they are often irreversible. This is the problem with short term use or exposure
to toxic substances. Ten years worth of outgassing is a significant fraction of one's lifespan. Very short term exposure
may be repairable by the body's immune defense, but constant levels beyond a few weeks will in time become so
overpowering that the body cannot heal the damage as rapidly as it is occurring, consequently you get chronic lifetime
illness even after the source has been removed.

Much of the blame can go directly to the editors at SA who continue to publish article after article by Mr. Tilson as he
attacks Lumber Liquidators.


"Going forward, I'm going to lower my public profile and allocate my time elsewhere as: 1) I've now shared publicly my
facts and resulting conclusions; and 2) It's not about me (or 60 Minutes or anyone else) vs. the company. It's about
the company's actions, what harm might have resulted, and what the consequences will be.


With numerous state and federal authorities as well as various law firms pursuing this vigorously, I'm confident that
the truth will be out, so I'm going to go back to my regular job of trying to buy the occasional cheap stock of a good
company."


A quote from Whitney Tilson.

Notice that Tilson never mentions that Dr. Philip Landrigan has been described by some as an environmental activist
and alarmist with controversial opinions on trace chemicals.


Self-reported symptoms are notoriously unreliable because of the prevalence of hypochondria. Here's an example of
self-reported symptoms from people who believe that they've been poisoned by mercury in their amalgam tooth
fillings: (Mercury poisoning from amalgam fillings is a scam perpetrated by some greedy dentists.)

"About 17 years ago I had a severe case of shakes, shivers, tremors, and numbness. The three doctors at Cleveland
Clinic could not find a cause. One neurologist said I did not have Parkinsons and the family doctor said I had a 'viral
whiplash.' My holistic doctor determined, after several tests, that I was mercury toxic. After removal of all my
amalgams and replaced with composites along with DMSA treatments I felt like a human being again."

Sorry denali deconstructive tests are not required and Not what the safety board says should be the testing method.
Short thesis is dead


10 Apr 2015, 02:15 AM


DenaliOcean
A deconstructive test absolutely is required if a supplier of finished goods containing a composite wood
product is labeling the goods as CARB phase 2 compliant and there is a question as to whether they are
compliant.


This is indisputable. And they can be subject to prosecution for this. This document makes it 100% clear: 
http://bit.ly/1wJZEBi


This is also confirmed by Kip Howlett, the president of HPVA (CBS News as well as myself used their
laboratory for the testing): 
http://bit.ly/1NNcp5M


This is not up for debate. It does not matter what the Consumer Product Safety Commission says on this
matter as their jurisdiction is different. They are not going to be enforcing California laws or product
mislabeling. Do you think it is OK to say that a product complies with a particular government regulation when
it blatantly does not and think that carries no consequence? Lumber Liquidators and others will pay the price
for this.


The new US law is also very clear about this:


"‘‘TITLE VI—FORMALDEHYDE STANDARDS FOR COMPOSITE WOOD PRODUCTS


‘‘(4) APPLICABILITY.—The formaldehyde emission standard  
referred to in paragraph (1) shall apply regardless of whether  
an applicable hardwood plywood, medium-density fiberboard,  
or particleboard is—  
‘‘(A) in the form of an unfinished panel; or  
‘‘(B) incorporated into a finished good. "


What this means is that the core MDF board must comply with the law if it is going to be incorporated into a
finished good. The Lumber Liquidators and Torlys Chinese MDF/HDF core boards do not comply.

DenaliOcean
It is not surprising the Consumer Product Safety Commission would use a different test method other than a
deconstructive test of the core HDF board and instead test the board as a whole which is even more close to
real world.


Probably they would be using this test method:


"ASTM E1333 - 14 Standard Test Method for Determining Formaldehyde Concentrations in Air and Emission
Rates from Wood Products Using a Large Chamber


Considered the gold standard of formaldehyde emissions testing, the large chamber acts as a large room in
which a composite wood product has been installed. When testing flooring in the large chamber, the planks
are laid down on the floor of the chamber, mimicking the installation process. "


When using this method they would definitely get a failure if the floorboards contain high levels of
formaldehyde.

Here is what I got out of the article.


- $LL flooring hasn't been found to be in violation by any regulatory agency 
- When you expose the core board, the levels can get higher levels than the regulations allow. But that is not what
customers are being exposed to. 
- Exposure at the deconstructed level can cause issues for people who are sensitive to formaldehyde. Not cancer or
death, but respiratory issues. Some which may be pretty bad. But again, the flooring isn't exposing anyone to those
levels. 
- LL may have known about it.


Known about what exactly? That it was not exposing people to toxic levels of formaldehyde or breaking the law? We
are over a month since the 60 minutes story. Where are the regulators on this? Surely they demanded some of the
suspected laminate and ran tests by now.

what I've read, it sounds highly unlikely. IMO it's irrelevant if they mislabeled. There's a reason for rules and
regulations and if you deliberately disobey the rules and lie to the your customers, you lose. You lose customers, you
get fined and in the end you lose profits. The truth will come out eventually. For all of you piling on Whitney and
accusing him of making false allegations for profit, I would think twice about going long on LL until all the facts come

had to deal with it myself and have wondered how they get away with it. Some people say this story is slowly dying in
the media but I will tell you it is not. Just visit the complaint boards or go on their very own Facebook page which I
have been following for some time. Go on the left side of the site where you will see "post to page" and click on it.
When a person posts a derogatory comment or asks for help, you get a reply saying they will help you and to
message them in a personal email with the order number and then they never get back to you or even worse, they will
block you if you make any additional comments. These comments aren't bashing the company, they are just stating
the facts and need help. I've also read many comments as with "Stephen Breezy" where they are denying people
"test kits" because they don't have the receipt........this can clearly be looked up on their system to verify the

Let's also look at how they mislead and misrepresent the product to the consumer. They post pictures of kids riding a
scooter over their floors and dogs running and playing to boast how scratch resistant these floors are, and yet people
that don't have animals or children and have complained about these floors scratching and denting within weeks of
installation they find some way to blame it on the consumer! They won't even send out an inspector to look at it....that
is if you can get through to their customer service! There have been people waiting months for them to get back to
them. Let's also look at LL's website where they only post the "good" reviews! You'll be lucky to find any complaints
regarding their flooring and I find that very strange! These things I'am posting are facts and not the way to run a
reputable company! And yes, then we have all the other accusations! Illegal resourcing, off gassing, mislabeling! I'm
not going to get into the issues of illegal resourcing or the mislabeling that will be for the regulators and the courts to
decide, but as far as the off gassing IMOP there are people who are chemically sensitive and children who are
effected....especially in the closed environment of a home where there are several items that contain formaldehyde.
Will someone get cancer? I don't think we know enough about formaldehyde to make that statement. Will someone
have respiratory problems or several of the other risks associated with formaldehyde? I will say yes. I have read
several complaints that these conditions occurred .....not before but after the flooring was installed. I have 2 friends
that were perfectly healthy and both had respiratory problems after their flooring was installed. And this people, is why
we have regulations! Not to just protect you or me, but everyone! When you have flooring installed that off gasses
throughout your home along with all the other things in it that contain formaldehyde in a closed environment as a
home there are people who will be effected!
