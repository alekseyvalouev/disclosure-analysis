Chanticleer Holdings: Could Fall 60% After Stock Promotion Becomes
Clear
Jun. 8, 2015 9:45 AM ET31 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


Chanticleer Holdings has risen over 100% on the back of articles written on Seeking
Alpha.


The author of this article has been linked to undisclosed paid promotion in the past.


Chanticleer Holdings has been involved with paid stock promotion in the past.


Chanticleer Holdings is a money losing roll-up that it almost out of cash and a much
needed offering will cause shares to fall.


Back in April, shares of Chanticleer Holdings (HOTR) were trading at around $2.00 on
very low volume. Since that time, several bullish articles on Seeking Alpha caused the
stock to rise to as high as $4.00 on surging volume of millions of shares.


Author John Ford wrote an article entitled "Chanticleer: This $2 Stock Would Be Cheap At
$6", predicting that this $2.00 stock could rise as high as $10 due to its rising revenues
and its similarities to Shake Shack (NYSE:SHAK) which has risen by 70% this year.

In reality, Chanticleer bears no resemblance to Shake Shack. The analogy was simply a
convenient way to compare Chanticleer to a sharply rising stock. Shake Shack is a high
growth operator of fast-casual restaurants in trendy areas with high foot traffic such as
Central Park in New York. Chanticleer, by contrast, is a low margin operator of several
disparate restaurants, including Hooter's chains in a variety of countries such as South
Africa, Australia, Hungary, Poland, and several other European countries. Unlike Shake
Shack, Chanticleer consistently loses money and the losses are recently accelerating
substantially. Unlike Shake Shack, any revenue growth from Chanticleer is coming simply
by buying more restaurants. There is no organic growth. In its most recent quarter,
Chanticleer was unable to file its 10Q on time. The company reported two material
weaknesses in its accounting controls and revealed that it was basically out of cash. The
company quickly filed a registration statement to sell stock to raise much needed cash.


In short, there were a great many reasons why Chanticleer was trading at just $2.00 and
on no real volume. If anything, investors should have been expecting a decline in the
stock due to its precarious financial position and its imminent need to raise money via a
stock sale.


Yet for some reason, author John Ford was absolutely certain that there was tremendous
near term upside to the stock. Why?


An analysis of Ford's past articles is revealing. Ford has written 41 articles covering 23
stocks. Of these 23 stocks,17 happen to be names which are backed by "serial stock
promoter" Barry Honig. In fact the only recent article that Mr. Ford has written that wasn't
on a name related to Honig was his article on Apple. (More details on Honig are provided
below).


The timing of these hyper bullish Ford/Honig articles is also notable in that they always
seem to come just as the Honig company needs to raise money via a stock sale. Ford
then appears with an uber bullish hype article predicting multi bagger returns just ahead of
the key financing.


The modus operandi is always the same. The stocks are small cap Honig names which
are very illiquid and underfollowed. Ford uses convenient (but faulty) analogies,
comparing his target to recently high flying mainstream stocks. The implication is always
that his target stock will be the next to soar.


Ford has been very effective and each of these stocks quickly soared, often by more than
100%. But in each case, the underlying company (just like Chanticleer) was struggling
financially. The subsequent equity offering typically caused the stock to drop substantially.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3242636-chanticleer-holdings-could-fall-60-percent-after-stock-promotion-becomes-clear 3/15


Then, after the company had their money and the promotion ended, the stock fell much
further, typically well below the levels from where it began. If history is any guide, then
investors should expect a sharp drop in Chanticleer when it conducts a (much needed)
near term equity offering. They should then expect a continued drop to well below $2.00.


Numerous examples can illustrate this.


Finjan Holdings (OTCQB:FNJN) - Mr. Ford wrote about this stock on January 23, 2014.
The stock popped about 20%, since then it has fallen 88%. Two days before the article
was published FNJN registered 21,500,000 shares to be sold, allowing them to potentially
sell the shares at an elevated price.


Vringo (VRNG) - Mr. Ford SUBMITTED THREE ARTICLES on VRNG between the weeks
of July 23, 2012 and August 6, 2012, including one where he gave the stock a $30 price
target based on a potential patent settlement with Google. Three days after his third article
on VRNG in the span of two weeks VRNG registered 9.6 million shares at $3.25 raising
$31 million. Since those articles VRNG has fallen 86%


Oculus (OCLS) - Perhaps the most startling example. Mr. Ford has written five times on
OCLS going back to September 21, 2011. Additional articles were published on February
9, 2012, March 27, 2012, April 1, 2013, and March 17, 2014. The articles suggested that
OCLS could triple and had a $10 billion market opportunity. Three months after his first
article on September 21, 2011, OCLS raised $2 million in an offering. One month after the
second series of articles on OCLS, the company raised another $3.1 million. Mr. Ford
wrote his final article on OCLS one month after the company had registered stock to be
sold.


(Editors' Note: Seeking Alpha has removed the OCLS articles due to information received
independent of this report).


Senseco (OTCQB:SVON) - Mr. Ford wrote about SVON on December 27, 2013,
suggesting that a near term catalyst could cause the shares to double. That day was the
peak and the stock has declined 85% since then.


ChromaDex (OTCQX:CDXC) - On December 4th, 2013 Mr. Ford wrote about CDXC,
suggesting that the recent investment by Dr. Frost could double the company's valuation.
The stock rose 100% in the next month, before quickly plunging 60%.


22nd Century (OTC:XXII) - On November 19, 2013, Mr. Ford wrote about XXII,
suggesting that the stock could double. The stock quickly soared 400%. The stock has
since fallen over 80% to levels below where Mr. Ford originally wrote about it.

Pershing Gold (OTCQB:PGLC) - On September 19th, 2013 Mr. Ford wrote about PGLC.
Mr. Honig is actually a Director of Pershing Gold, suggesting there was 50% upside. The
stock then grinded 30% lower, after which it has recovered somewhat.


The trend goes on.

Chanticleer - a history of illicit promotion


In reality, investors should have already been on alert regarding inappropriate promotion
at Chanticleer. Last year, Seeking Alpha author Richard Pearson wrote a detailed expose
article highlighting undisclosed paid stock promotion and small cap stocks.


In that article, Pearson exposed a small firm called Red Fish Creative which, for a fee,
would hire authors using either real or fake identities to write bullish articles on a their
clients, using a variety of financial news websites. The firm was run by John Eastman.


The article included a table that showed that nearly every article written on Chanticleer at
the time had ties to Redfish. In addition, nearly every author with ties to Redfish (including
Eastman himself) had written on Chanticleer.


We can even see the pricing sheet for Redfish, which shows the difference levels of
pricing for different levels of articles.


Source: Richard Pearson article


Here is the list of articles, a skull and cross bones denoting ties Redfish authors, from Mr.
Pearson's article.

The point is that Chanticleer has long been associated with under the table promotions.
Now that the company is desperately in need of an equity financing, this latest round of
promotion should come as no surprise.


Barry Honig - a "serial stock promoter"


A 2013 report from Lakewood Capital on Opko Health (NYSEMKT:OPK). Honig has been
involved in numerous micro-cap stock promotions. Here are some of the highlights from
Lakewood's report on OPK:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3242636-chanticleer-holdings-could-fall-60-percent-after-stock-promotion-becomes-clear 8/15


"Dr. Frost has a disturbingly large number of connections to what we believe are two
serial stock promoters that have each been the subject of multiple lawsuits, Barry
Honig and Michael Brauser (who together run an entity called Marlin Capital)."


"We have found 38 different stocks connected to Barry Honig and 15 connected to
Michael Brauser (there are likely many more, but this is what we could track down).
Only three of these companies have a market capitalization above $150 million, only
one of these companies generates a profit… (Pyramid Oil), which only makes
around $1 million per year. 85 Many of these companies have cost investors a
significant amount of money and both individuals have been the subject of extensive
litigation."


"Barry Honig was also sued in January 2011 in relation to Empire Sports &
Entertainment (EXCX) by former two-time winning heavyweight champion Shannon
Briggs. According to one article, "…Briggs filed a major lawsuit in New York State
Supreme Court, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment and
breach of contract against Gregory D. Cohen, Shelly Finkel and Barry Honig, and
their boxing and entertainment promotional company, Empire Sports &
Entertainment." Briggs claimed he was the "victim of a 'ripoff' on two fronts by his
former promoters and business partners, part and parcel of which includes
documents in which his signature was 'forged.'" Financially, Briggs alleged that he
had agreed to fight then world champion Vitali Klitschko for a purse of $750,000, "…
but that he wound up with a mere $25,000, after he returned to the United States
after the prolonged hospital stay in Hamburg. … 'To add insult to injury,' the lawsuit
alleges, 'the defendants deducted the cost of Briggs' hospitalization from the
understated purse of the bout.'" However, the story doesn't end there. Empire Sports
& Entertainment ultimately became Sagebrush Gold (NASDAQ:SAGE) on June 1,
2011, with Barry Honig serving as Chairman. In October 2011, Honig announced to
Sagebrush shareholders that "Legendary investor Dr. Phillip Frost (Chairman of Teva
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Opko Health, Inc.) has invested
$5 million in our subordinated debt and convertible preferred stock." The company
changed names once again and became Pershing Gold in March 2012. Today,
Pershing Gold is 19.4% owned by Frost and 10.1% owned by Honig. Brauser had
also previously been a shareholder but appears to have sold all of his shares in April
2013."


A simple search of SEC filings shows the shocking number of promotional micro cap
companies that Mr. Honig is involved with.

Conclusion


HOTR has used paid stock promotion in the past and has been the subject of promotional
articles again. This has caused the stock to run up. As we have seen in the past, the
companies that are covered by Mr. Ford quickly fall back to much lower level after the
company completes a secondary. HOTR will be no different. It's not a $10 stock or even
close to being the next Shake Shack. It's an unprofitable franchiser of disparate restaurant
chains that will quickly see its stock back around $2/ share, representing downside of
65%, around where it was trading before the stock rose because of the stock promotion.


Notes:


I have contacted both Mr. Ford and Chanticleer Holdings with questions. I contacted Mr.
Ford on June 1 and Chanticleer IR on June 5th.

thanks for article. Frankly this article is just as idiotic as there are inaccuracies. Firstly HOTR has $3mm of cash post
the last offering and is not in "desperate need" of financing for this reason. Additionally, the shelf offering has been
filed for opportunistic acquisitions in the future and as management has stated could also be used to pay down debt if
the stock was closer to $5. You have also conveniently omitted the very important point that they own 3% of Hooters
Corporate which is currently officially on sale and may generate a $5-6mm non dilutive gain for the company. You are
now on my black list as a pumper of stocks on childish analysis. Thanks to your article I have just bought stock
cheaply at 3.18.

1967 only has 2 comments - obviosly a profile created by one of the HOTR pumpers.


Credit to the author of the article - he did a pretty good takedown of the company and the stock.

This article commits atrocious fallacies.


1. First and foremost, for anyone interested in the full story of Mr. Ford, consider this summary on Seeking Alpha. 
Performance in 2014: +41% 
Performance in 2013: +154% 
http://seekingalpha.co... 
This article is just riding the coattails of Mr. Ford's popularity and proven investing success. Again, +41% and +154%
annual performance. That's the reason it was written in the first place. Mr. Ford is popular because he is a good
investor. It is a common tactic to write negative articles about popular individuals to gain exposure.


2. The article opens with the bullet point that Mr. Ford has been "linked to undisclosed paid compensation in the past,"
yet it fails to ever substantiate this claim- not even once.


3. Instead, this article discusses the infamous story of Richard Pearson -- a totally unrelated person -- and tries to
"link" Mr. Ford to his story by merely discussing his unrelated history. This is a popular rhetorical technique to mislead
people.


4. The author cherry picked stocks from Mr. Ford's column that have declined while ignoring the winners- winners that
outnumber the losers by a substantial majority.


5. For example, Mr. Ford wrote about... 
OPK: Mr. Ford wrote about it around $4.25; it's is now $17.11 (and several billion dollars higher in market
capitalization). 
MSLP: Mr. Ford wrote about it around $4; it's now $6.30 (and had previously rallied as high as $14). 
CUR: Mr. Ford first wrote about it around $0.60; it's now $1.79. 
COCP: Mr. Ford first wrote about it around $0.60; it's now $1.20. 
MARA: Split-adjusted, MARA has doubled since Mr. Ford first wrote about it. 
doubled 
I have followed Mr. Ford and track his performance in realtime, because he is a well-known influencer of stocks, just
as I track other market-moving writers like Sahm Adrangi or Andrew Left. That Mr. Ford publishes an annual review
every year on his Seeking Alpha instablog only makes verification easier for any interested reader. 
http://bit.ly/1Iyj1SG


6. Notice that the author never mentions the long-term performance of all of Mr. Ford's selections. Had he done so, he
would see that a portfolio containing only Mr. Ford's predictions would be up substantially, not "down" as the cherry
picked list would have you believe. This is the textbook fallacy Confirmation Bias.


So many more fallacies, I haven't even gotten into HOTR, but this comment is getting lengthy already. I'll revisit this if
I find more time, but I'm trying to make money in the market like everyone else, and I'll continue following Mr. Ford for
as long as he shares money-making ideas... as he has done for over two years now.

nothing about the CEO and management and their integrity. As Palestra1967 has almost accurately stated the
company as of end of Q1 had $3.2mm of cash and not $3mm. You have also made no attempt (maybe because
you're not capable) of noticing how cheap this stock is compared to many other stocks in this group. Lastly, today I
received an e-mail alert from Taglich who have upped their target to $5.80 on old fashioned financial and fundamental
analysis. If your thesis is exclusively to target one of your colleagues at SeekingAlpha then you have done a great job.
If on the other hand you think we are going to listen to the above trash which has no fundamental analysis then I can
only think you are short the stock and therefore as Palestra said you are a pumper. Because you have a following on
this website does not actually mean you are qualified to have an opinion although obviously you are entitled to one.


08 Jun 2015, 11:38 AM


Evans Capital, Contributor
Careful -- Taglich is indeed a paid promoter. Check their disclosure at the end of their report. (Chanticleer
pays them $1500 a month). And I'm long the stock. but wanted to let you know.


08 Jun 2015, 12:22 PM


Ben Rabizadeh, Contributor
Just because research is paid doesn't mean the research is invalid. There are generally only two reasons an
entity would release positive research on a company. They own the stock or they get some sort of cash
compensation. 99% of all research you will ever read falls under one of these two categories so summarily
dismissing the research because proper disclosure was followed; is not an iota of a reason to dismiss the
stock.


I'm ready to back up the truck at $3 if retail is fooled into selling on this very weak bear attack today.

c'mon digginsj49, in your first ever comment, the charade is over. at least for HOTR. Time to create a new
profile, find a new no-name stock willing to pay for your promotions. Unfortunately there is so much greed out
there I am sure you will have tons of job security.

digginsj49
Barry Robbins, feel free to e-mail directly or if you prefer let's have a discussion on this board on factual
fundamentals. You are the contributor on seeking alpha so why do you think I am the person promoting?!
Wrong way round maybe. With regards to the "job security" you allude to I have not worked for anyone since
1970 when I was 21 years old. Since then I have met thousands of people like you who pontificate about
superficial opinions on the internet and manipulate stocks in the hope of making a few hundred dollars here
and there. I have real money in HOTR and happen to know management. Feel free to "contribute" with some
fundamentals and add to the 175 comments you have already made versus my 2!

Seems like someone is trying to get HOTR stock to drop and buy. Mark Roberson the new CEO is a great manager
and will lead HOTR in the right direction. Besides the company is revamping its business and has great processes. It
has huge upside potential. I don't know about the $10.00/share claim but this is definitely going to be in the $7 range
after next earnings report or sooner. Companies are not built in a day or made/broke based on less than factual
rhetoric

If I was a talented writer I would ride Barry honigs investments as well. There is a reason why when john ford writes
an article volume comes in. No one is perfect but if you look Honig/ford have more winners than losers. Also they fail
to mention all the social media gurus that picked he stock up.

Great work. Buyer beware. These guys can't even mint a coin with Hooters. That's a part of the human anatomy that
financed most of the internet infra-structure. Move over NCSA. In any case, the stock does not look too good right
now. Careful of falling knives.
