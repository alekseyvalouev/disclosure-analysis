Keyw Corp.: Looming Covenant Violations And High Probability
Bankruptcy: -65% To -100% Downside
May 14, 2014 11:02 AM ET20 comments
by: The Pump Stopper


Summary


KEYW faces looming covenant violations and a high probability of bankruptcy. I walk
you through the unforgiving math below.


KEYW’s backlog accounting presents a headline number that appears massively
overstated.


KEYW is NOT a high-margin cyber-security software company. Investors have been
misled by promotional research from underwriters who earn huge investment
banking fees from KEYW.


KEYW’s true business is low-margin government contracting and, based on true
peer comparable valuations, KEYW’s fair value is $3.80 -- if the company can avoid
bankruptcy.


I hate seeing innocent investors lose money on disastrous investments, so I've made it my
mission to unclog America's stock markets - I am, if you will, the plunger for blockages in
the stock market. Keyw Corp. (NASDAQ:KEYW) is a particularly large blockage as the
company has destroyed a huge amount of capital and put itself into an impossible corner
which investors clearly don't understand. KEYW's only options now appear to be
bankruptcy or attempt to immediately dilute shareholders by 35-40%+[1].


This Part 1 of my 3 part series, uncovers the following reality about KEYW:


1. KEYW's looming covenant violations and high probability of bankruptcy. I walk you
through the unforgiving math below.


2. KEYW's backlog accounting presents a headline number that appears massively
overstated.


3. KEYW is NOT a high-margin cyber-security software company[2]: investors have been
misled by promotional research from underwriters who earn huge investment banking fees
from KEYW.

4. KEYW's true business is low-margin government contracting and based on true peer
comparable valuations, KEYW's fair value is $3.80 -- if the company can avoid bankruptcy.


5. How KEYW got itself into this impossible mess.


1. KEYW Bankruptcy and Covenant Violations:


On a quarterly basis, KEYW has already violated its recently relaxed debt covenants and
is teetering on the edge of a trailing 12-month covenant violation. Without an immediate,
massively dilutive equity raise, KEYW faces imminent bankruptcy risk.


How did KEYW get here? KEYW is a failing rollup of disparate, apparently unintegrated
assets, acquired at very high valuations that used a lot of debt. The vast majority of KEYW
revenue is contract based, with the US government, and now faces formidable revenue
and cash flow headwinds as the government curtails spending and contracts roll off.


KEYW's business is now in rapid decline and appears to be getting worse. In Q4 2013
KEYW total revenue declined -7% yoy. Then, even though he was nearly halfway through
Q1 already, KEYW CEO Len Moodispaw forecasted a "robust year" though it should have
been obvious by then that the government business was rolling over. Just weeks later, Len
announced horrendous Q1 2014 results, with KEYW's government business rapidly
deteriorating as revenue declined -19% year-over-year (yoy).


On the recent Q1 2014 call, KEYW said the business should stabilize sequentially (quarter
over quarter) - let's put aside management's history of repeated disappointment on
winning contracts and rolling out new products and assume the business stabilizes. Even
if revenue stabilizes qoq, I estimate KEYW revenue would still decline approximately -20%
yoy again in Q2 (see below) and I expect more of the same in Q3.


The single most important issue for KEYW now is its debt covenant structure and
leverage. This is despite the fact KEYW just very recently in 3/2014 amended and relaxed
some of the terms on their debt.


Let's look at my estimates and the unforgiving math of what happens when a roll-up
unravels: There is a lot going on in the chart below but I want to call your attention to the
yellow highlighted row where you can see that EBITDA has been declining and is
estimated to continue that trend. In the last quarter KEYW's EBITDA declined -64%
relative to the same quarter last year.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


The simple math is KEYW has too much debt and not enough cash flow (EBITDA).
With EBITDA now imploding, there is a very real chance KEYW's lenders foreclose
on the company soon, leaving the equity worthless. You can see below, in the yellow
highlighted row and red numbers, that based on the numbers above KEYW will violate the
recently amended terms of their debt next quarter.


You can also see below in the yellow row with red numbers that KEYW appears to be on
the verge of violating the debt terms about earning enough cash flow to service the debt.
My estimates also show KEYW appears to be unable to even make their debt payments
next year, unless revenue turns around dramatically.


As you can see, KEYW's hands are tied because if they try to draw down on their revolver
or take on more debt, these covenant metrics and the excessive leverage immediately
gets much worse. As far as I can tell, KEYW's only hope is to immediately sell an
enormous amount of dilutive equity at whatever terms they can get (I expect a huge
discount from the current price, if it is possible at all).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


"Related to the balance sheet, we've always had a strong balance sheet. It's getting
better." - KEYW CEO Len Moodispaw 2/6/2014


On 3/13/2014 KEYW had to amend the terms of its debt and relax the covenants. This 8k
included backward looking terms to January of 2014.


Was CEO Len Moodispaw in conversations with nervous lenders while he told the public
his balance sheet was strong and getting better?


2. Math of Potentially Imminent Equity Raise: KEYW's Only Way Out


The unfortunate bottom line is that KEYW only has three options at this point that I can
see, and all of them could crush the stock:


1. Continue on their current path, default on their debt, and go bankrupt.


2. Immediately raise at least $100m of equity, according to my estimate. Either they can
pay down debt to a more reasonable ~2X EBITDA level or attempt to buy more growth. By
my calculations, KEYW needs to purchase (minimum) $5m in EBITDA per quarter or
$20m of annual EBITDA to avoid default. If they buy another government contracting
business, this will cost at least 5-6x EBITDA or $100-120m and will have to be funded with
equity (I don't believe any lender would lend more debt to a company violating its current
debt covenants and KEYW has virtually no hard assets to borrow against anyway). That
equity is nearly certain to be sold at a large discount to the current share price, likely with
dilutive warrant coverage. This works out to at least 35%+ dilution to current
shareholders[3]. This $100-120m in estimated equity KEYW needs aligns "coincidentally"
with the $150m shelf offering KEYW recently filed. This doesn't solve the structural issues
KEYW faces but it would help the company avoid near-term bankruptcy.


Also note, when KEYW's financials looked much better with less leverage and some
growth back in 2012, KEYW seems to have struggled to raise equity and had to go to
Europe to generate investor interest. With their business now rapidly deteriorating I doubt
they will be able to convince anyone to give them $100m in cash with their awful track
record of capital destruction. (See KEYW option 1 above: bankruptcy).


3. If KEYW can't raise equity, their only viable option that I see is to shut down the failing
commercial and cyber business completely and immediately[4]. KEYW would then be a
pure play government contractor with declining revenue, with a valuation re-rated to peers
at ~0.8x EV/ forward revenue (likely in the $250m ballpark by my estimate). Putting
KEYW's market cap at ~$120m or ~$3-3.50 per share, for -65% downside to the stock.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


Government revenue would likely still be declining so it may trade at a discount, and
without organic revenue growth KEYW's balance sheet could just eventually become
strained again anyway.


3. Won't KEYW's Backlog save them? KEYW Backlog Massively Overstated


As of January 1st, KEYW states their total backlog is $509 million. This sounds impressive
until you read the fine print and realize only $132 million is actually funded - the remaining
balance is unfunded, or basically just a placeholder.


For reference, this $132 million funded backlog is a mere 46% of KEYW's LTM revenue of
$285mm. KEYW needs to fill the other 54% of revenue in an increasingly difficult
government spending environment while its cyber-security products are failing to get
traction and appears to actually be declining (much more detail on that in report Part 3).
Given KEYW government contracts are already rolling off or re-pricing at lower levels of
profitability (described explicitly on recent earnings calls), plus KEYW's large aircraft
contract facing headwinds next year and some analysts estimate that contract alone could
be approximately half of KEYW's government EBITDA, KEYW's business has no
stabilization in sight that I can see.


4. KEYW is a Sell Side Promote, KEYW is NOT a-Cyber Security Technology
Business!

5/22/2018 Keyw Corp.: Looming Covenant Violations And High Probability Bankruptcy: -65% To -100% Downside - KEYW Holding (NASDAQ:KEY…


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


Given the ugly reality of KEYW's current financial situation, why are investors valuing
KEYW stock incorrectly?


I believe the primary reason for KEYW's absurd overvaluation is directly due to the conflict
of interest from KEYW's relationships with Wall Street. As seen below, since KEYW has
been addicted to capital to fuel its failed acquisition strategy, KEYW is an extremely
profitable client of some of Wall Street's lower tier banks. These banks derived substantial
income from KEYW's IPO and 2012 secondary offering.


Note the coverage initiation, upgrade and price target increase right before the equity
offering. You can see similar behavior above with multiple price target boosts early this
year too. Particularly interesting are the price target increases right after KEYW CFO
Korbath's departure when the stock declined rapidly. I think KEYW has likely known for a
long time (all the way back to the Chardan initiation in August, 2013) that it would need to
raise equity.


This sell side promote cycle began anew on March 24th when the sell side stepped up to
defend the stock in the wake of CFO John Korbath's awkward departure and the
unforgiving math of imminent covenant breach and debt default.


Before you dismiss short sellers as being financially biased, think about how much
research coverage $10.9 million buys on Wall Street!

Source: CapIQ


Note the average underwriting fee on Wall Street is between 5-7% of the capital raised. If
KEYW fills its entire $150 million shelf, that would be roughly another $7.5 to 10.5 million
of fees for these or similar investment banks. No wonder the sell side is so supportive!


"Holy smokes Batman! This is a huge conflict of interest!"


(source for picture above)


The Wall Street sell-side bank machine explained


As conflicted underwriters seeking multi-million dollar fees, the incentive is to issue the
most favorable coverage possible to KEYW, sending the stock price higher and allowing
KEYW to issues new shares at a high price.


The promotion effort for KEYW occurred by comparing KEYW to companies that are
completely unrelated, with the most common comparison drawn to FireEye's
(NASDAQ:FEYE) acquisition of Mandiant. Some sell side analysts have erroneously

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


valued KEYW as high as $3 billion of market cap (10x sales for the entire KEYW business
even though only 3% is cyber revenue[8]).


Just how different is Mandiant?


Mandiant was founded in 2004 and backed by Kleiner Perkins, one of the world's premier
Venture Capital firms. Mandiant organically grew to over $100 million of revenue before
being acquired. Unlike KEYW, it was not a patchwork of disparate, unrelated assets, one
of which was sold by a consortium of VC firms at a loss (Sensage). Also unlike KEYW,
Mandiant was founded and managed by a team with deep cyber-security experience - it
was not a "me too" cyber-security company.


FACT: KEYW's cyber-security revenue accounts for only 3% of the KEYW's total revenue.
Clearly, KEYW is not a cyber-security company no matter what anyone says. It is a zero
probability event that any strategic acquirer would buy a declining government
subcontracting business (what KEYW actually is) for 10x revenue. Using CapIQ data, I
looked at literally hundreds of Aerospace & Defense acquisitions going back to 1997 and I
couldn't even find one example of a government contractor getting bought out at 10x
sales.


This is so obvious that I can only conclude the sell side authors writing about KEYW don't
even know what KEYW actually does! If this is how management is pitching KEYW to
investors, I'm also not sure management knows what KEYW does!


I could clear up all of this confusion with one simple question to KEYW management:


(source for picture above)


Let's look at the timeline of KEYW's current tailspin:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


2/6/2014: KEYW CEO says their balance sheet is strong and getting better.


3/13/2014: KEYW amends their credit facility. I believe math makes it obvious KEYW
realizes they could need equity at this point.


3/20/2014: KEYW announces the surprising departure of John Korbath, CFO - clearly
related, I believe, to the debt covenant amendment and brutally dilutive shelf offering
KEYW is about to file. Note KEYW and the CFO are at the end of Q1 2014 already so
they know what earnings are going to look like (i.e., a train wreck).


3/24-26/2014: KEYW's underwriter-analysts promote the stock aggressively by comparing
KEYW to unrelated businesses that trade at premium valuations.


4/23/2014: KEYW files a $150mm shelf equity offering.


5/1/2014: KEYW announces and awful quarter with revenue imploding -18% YOY, the
stock declines rapidly, KEYW's solvency called into question. I highly recommend you
read the Q1 2014 call as it is one of the worst examples of management floundering I
have ever seen.


Why does KEYW and the sell side seem so confused? Maybe because KEYW is
desperate for equity capital?


The company finished Q1 2014 with a shocking $64,000 of cash on the books - that is
sixty-four thousand dollars of cash for a company with net losses of >$11mm LTM,
revenue that was down 18% in the most recent quarter, and $85mm of debt.


As a public company, KEYW has lifetime free cash flow of roughly $5 million. This is not a
typo. Since 2010, the company has generated a mere $5mm of free cash flow. Even after
its recent brutal price decline, KEYW stock is still valued at 99x lifetime FCF on an
enterprise value basis. That is somewhere between "horrific" and "unbelievably terrible."


I believe the numbers show, KEYW needs to sell equity NOW if it is to remain a going
concern. This is why they filed a massively dilutive shelf registration on April 23rd.


4. KEYW Fair Valuation: <1x Sales and a $4 stock


Let's look at some facts to value KEYW appropriately:


Fact 1: KEYW mentions "Direct Peers" in its own SEC filed proxy statement: both
Mandiant and FireEye are absent


This is a direct quote from the 2013 KEYW proxy statement (emphasis mine):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


Compensation Consultant's benchmarking analysis was based on two distinct peer
groups (Direct and Indirect Peers) which it developed jointly with executive
management [who presumably should know what KEYW does, but I am not sure
anymore]. We believe Direct Peers should serve as the primary reference point for
evaluating the reasonableness of pay levels while practices should be shaped by a
broader index including Indirect Peers.


Who are these direct peers exactly?


The Direct Peer Group was as follows:





• AeroVironment, Inc.  • ICF International, Inc.


• American Science & Engineering, Inc.  • Mercury Computer Systems, Inc.


• Dynamics Research Corporation  • NCI, Inc.


• GeoEye, Inc.  • Sourcefire, Inc.


• Globecomm Systems, Inc.   


FireEye and Mandiant are nowhere on KEYW's own list of their peers!


Fact 2: KEYW's closest peers in its 10-K competitor section trade at a fraction of
KEYW's valuation


In the competitors section of KEYW's 10-K:


"We also face competition from a number of large, well-established government
contractors such as Science Applications International Corporation (NYSE:SAIC),
CACI International, Inc. (NYSE:CACI) and others."


Here you have KEYW directly comparing itself to government contractors that trade at
0.8x and 0.5x, EV / 2014 sales estimates, respectively. This is a very fair comparison
because 97% of KEYW's revenue is government contracting and both SAIC and CACI are
in similar if not identical contracting businesses.

Here is KEYW's true comparable public company peer group:


You can see above that peers to KEYW are valued at 0.79x sales and 14x EBITDA. If you
exclude the MRCY outlier, that declines to ~8x EBITDA. Amazingly, KEYW still trades at
roughly double the peer valuation despite near-term risk of bankruptcy with declining
revenue and EBITDA - a rerating to peer valuation on estimated 2014 revenue of $250mm
would value KEYW stock at ~$3.00 per share.


More importantly, KEYW trades at 2.5x SAIC's valuation and 1.5x CACI's valuation, which
are the closest peers per KEYW's own SEC documents. I think $319mm consensus
revenue for 2014 is obviously too high after Q1, with similar declines likely coming in Q2
and Q3 by my estimates, so let's be generous and value it on $285mm of LTM revenue
with a similar multiple to CACI.


Valuing KEYW appropriately, as a government subcontractor (per KEYW's own
filings) with the same valuation as CACI, produces a fair value of $3.80 for the
stock, assuming KEYW doesn't go bankrupt or massively dilute current shareholders.
This is a shocking ~65% downside from the current price.


KEYW's valuation premium is very likely to compress in coming quarters - for starters
because sell side estimates are still too high. Most of the analysts covering the stock have
not yet revised their estimates down after KEYW's Q1 huge miss (is this another indication
a conflict of interest exists?).


5. How Did KEYW Get Itself Into This Impossible Mess? KEYW is a failed rollup:
This is the home of capital destruction

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


Even though KEYW has only been public since 2010, (per CapIQ) it ranks as the 20th
most aggressive rollup out of 285 (top 9%), and the #1 out of the Aerospace & Defense
index of 5 companies.


KEYW has been a forced buyer - the company went public on the premise of winning a
large prime contract. That failed and the stock tanked. Management then embarked on an
aggressive purchasing campaign, buying 13 businesses, with the hope of one day
"finding" a sustainable business model- this day has yet to occur, in my opinion. Why?
There is a seller to KEYW for a reason and aggressive buyers make expensive
acquisitions.


KEYW Has Generated -3.1% Return on the $393m of Asset growth since inception:
This is terrible performance


These numbers are staggeringly bad. Even worse, KEYW has experienced
ACCELERATING LOSSES (EBIT declined by $12mm) as a result of the acquisitions the
company has made. Basically, KEYW could have made more money by purchasing 0.1%
T-Bills.


In my opinion, anyone investing in KEYW through an upcoming secondary offering is
signing up for continued capital destruction. The bigger KEYW gets, the worse it does.
Given the over leveraged balance sheet and history of terrible performance, this next
secondary (if they can even do it) is likely to be KEYW's last, in my opinion.


A quick look at the valuation multiples the company has paid makes it clear why the
results are so bad

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2217303-keyw-corp-looming-covenant-violations-and-high-probability-bankruptcy-minus-65-percent-to-minus-100-percent-downside


These are overpriced acquisitions, many paid for with debt, and many of the acquired
companies have subsequently performed poorly. I am particularly shocked at the Sensage
acquisition, which was acquired for 7.1x EV/Revenue and with a tiny revenue base. My
channel check revealed Sensage was "the last girl without a date to the dance" and had
been shopped extensively in the consolidating cyber-security industry prior to its sale. The
VC investors who sold Sensage were so desperate to find a buyer that they were willing to
sell Sensage at a loss just to get out of the asset.


An extremely detailed report on KEYW's impossible battle to penetrate the "cyber" market
will be coming very soon.


Token Insider buying


Apparently, in a desperate attempt to put a floor on KEYW's imploding stock price before a
potential equity raise, Len Moodispaw recently purchased 10,000 shares of KEYW in the
open market at ~$11.00 a share.


The market is not so easily fooled by such tomfoolery, Len! I checked KEYW's historic
open market acquisitions vs. open market dispositions, per CapIQ data, in the $10-12
price range. As they say, "the numbers don't lie" - KEYW insiders, including Moodispaw,
have purchased a total 35,000 shares in this price range and sold 195,400 shares. This is
a staggering divide in dollar terms: I estimate, based on CapIQ data, that KEYW execs

have purchased $396,823 and sold $2,233,622 in a similar price range over time, a
startling 5.6-fold difference. Clearly, insiders would rather take profits at this level,
historically speaking.


Len, let's see an immediate $1,000,000+ open market buy by you and the new CFO with
your own money and then we'll talk. Until then, you're not fooling anyone.


Contacting Management


I have attempted to contact management several times over the last 2+ months and have
been unable to reach anyone through the standard investor relations channels. Given the
embarrassing investor Q&A from the last earnings call, I believe KEYW is in "circle the
wagons" mode and avoiding public communication.


Conclusion:


Ultimately I see no easy way out for KEYW. I've outlined the three options KEYW has at
this point and all of them point to enormous downside for the stock. With this in mind, my
"bull case" scenario for KEYW involves 35-40%+ dilution (depending on warrants) to
KEYW shareholders and my downside case involves near-term bankruptcy and -100%
downside. My personal view, based on KEYW's rampant capital destruction and repeated
failure, is that the market should decline a capital raise until KEYW flushes its failed
strategy down the drain - this would be a positive event for the capital markets so that
future capital can be redirected towards companies that are creating value. The simple
math is unforgiving here and I wish there were a better outcome.


See Website for Full Disclaimer


[1] My estimate of required dilution, presented below in more detail


[2] Only 3% of KEYW revenue is cyber-security


[3] At $8, a $100mm equity raise would create $12.5mm new shares, not including
warrants. This would be ~33% more dilution, a number that is likely too low given the likely
need for warrants to sweeten the deal.


[4] I consider the lack of growth in this business to be a failure and my checks reveals
KEYW is unlikely to successfully ramp this business. More details in a future report.

This is a huge amount of analysis for a company that's trading at $10 (and therefore represents limited downside if
the analysis follows through). Right analysis, wrong focus perhaps?


14 May 2014, 11:54 AM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  why do you say there is limited downside based on price per share? if a $1 stock goes to $0
that is the same -100% downside that occurs to a $50 stock that goes to $0. The simple stock price does not
impact the analysis.


My price target if they avoid bankruptcy is ~$4 which is -60% downside from here based on ~$10 per share
trading price.


KEYW has $390m market cap too so this is a pretty big company

Great analysis. Two additional and somewhat related things that should concern investors 1) the questionable timing
of the departure of the CFO along with the pay package he received as outlined in the 10Q exhibits and 2) something
buried in his amended employment agreement called project "bullseye". This is not the pay package of someone who
is leaving to pursue other interests. While it could be they fired him- it does not look that way. It looks like they are
paying someone to go away quietly. Perhaps Krobath came to his senses, saw the impending doom and said I am out

of here. Second what is project BullsEye? Are they trying to sell of part of the business to raise cash. Perhaps I
missed this in one of their mis-direction rants in the conference call.

An interesting read. Clearly, a purposely VERY biased report. One that uses rhetoric more extreme than anything I've
seen from "pumpers". That's not to say the conclusions will turn out to be grossly overstated or false but rather that I
found them to be more intended to scare the reader than to inform – that is a big red flag.


In my opinion the thesis of the author hinges greatly on one particular comment: "If KEYW can't raise equity, their only
viable option that I see is to shut down the failing commercial and cyber business completely and immediately"


My research indicates it is FAR TO EARLY to declare KEYW's commercial and cyber business to be "failing". In my
opinion that's nearly comparable to calling Apple's streaming music business a failure that should be shut down.
CLEARLY, these are businesses that are just getting started. The first demos were only several weeks ago.


Apparently, investors believe KEYW has the expertise to build and deliver a successful cyber security product. If it
does the current valuation is not unreasonable in my opinion. If on the other hand the commercial/cyber business
never develops then the author's conclusions about valuation may be accurate.

Camden, I don't think the point is that KEYW can't be successful, it is that they can no longer fund Hexis
without a large equity raise. If they don't raise money by selling stock the only way to remain within their debt
covenants is to cut spending on Hexis. The covenant breach is very likely in the June quarter. They may get a
waiver from the bank but how long will the bank be patient? Remember, creditors don't participate in the
upside of Hexis so they only look at the downside protection. KEYW has net working capital of $12.9 million
and will likely burn $5 million this quarter. That will leave $8 million! That is crazy for this size of a business.


As for whether they're successful, I did watch every small government contractor and their brother try to
develop commercial products around 1999-2000 when tech was white hot. I can't name a single company
that was successful. You must truly believe best of breed technology is developed by the government. I know
it sounds cool when Len mentions super secret stuff they are doing. You may find this interesting

Author’s reply »  thanks for the comment Camden and apologies if the tone put you off,


regardless of KEYW equity raise or cyber working or not, I believe KEYW is clearly on a path to breaching
their debt covenants again and the whole thing looks to me to be coming apart at the seems. Even if KEYW
cyber business is worthwhile, KEYW can't afford to fund it.

My own research shows that the companies KEYW acquired for their cycber/commerical business were pretty
much failures before KEYW and given sales declined a lot qoq recently I think it looks to me like they are still
failing. I plan to put out a post shortly that goes over the history of Sensage and the cyber/commercial
companies KEYW acquired to get into this space and I'll give you a preview... it's not pretty :(


Can you explain how the current valuation is reasonable? 96%+ of KEYW revenue is governemtn contractor
and those trade at much lower valuations than KEYW.


I'm honestly just trying to create transparency and don't like companies or sell side analysts that do not tell
the whole story. If you see some hole in the analysis above or disagree with me and can refute my points with
math I would very much appreciate the feedback as I'm short KEYW and if I am wrong I would rather know
sooner than later!

Author’s reply »  thanks STFUDonnie,


I think anyone betting on KEYW ramping their cyber business really really needs to call any of the other big
and established players already doing this and ask them what they think of Hexis, Hawkeye G, KEYW, etc.
Just go online and call one of the sales guys at a competitor to KEYW. Most of the people I talked to had
literally not even heard anything about KEYW and there are some big guns already in this space already
doing this. Furthermore, who wants to partner with a company on the edge of bankruptcy with a legal history
like KEYW's?


15 May 2014, 11:27 AM


Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos
I agree on all points. Gartner has heard of Sensage but not Hexis. Their comments on the Sensage product
are not good. It is a struggle to find anyone that is trying out Hawkeye G. I'm comfortable that the commercial
ramp will take much longer than expected if it happens at all. The decline in government services has been
surprising and is really becoming the story hear. All the people that bought KEYW thinking it was an
undiscovered cyber jewel appear to be gone given the small number of comments here.


BTW, in your table above you list the purchase price of Sensage as $88M. It was $24M. You can find the
number in the latest 10-K.

Author’s reply »  thanks for the comment STFUDonnie, my numbers came straight out of Capiq and show a
large amount of assumed liabilities per Capiq, I'm double checking the numbers directly off the filings now and
if I find any discrepancy I will update the writeup

Thanks for using more math than rhetoric, opposite what Camden commented. The probability they breach their debt
covenants looks rather high, and you are correct that a precarious balance sheet can quickly unravel any company.
Anyone interested in their "products" can pick them up after liquidation.


15 May 2014, 03:13 PM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  thanks Buddha. I obviously have my view but I tried to lay out my case with supporting documents,
facts and math. It seems hard to argue with the math here.


If there is a bull case here that can be supported with math I would love to see it. Not trying to be biased, but I just
don't see how this works out well for the equity here.


Wait until you see my report on KEYW's cyber/commercial businesses too. In my opinion, virtually zero chance that
works out.


I think KEYW could get caught in a balance sheet "death spiral" here too in regards to the potential equity raise. The
problem is that any hedge fund or large investor considering buying a large slug of equity in this disaster can always
just wait or stall and KEYW's financial situation is only likely to get more precarious in my view. I've seen it before,
especially in oil/gas E&P, where the perverse incentives can create a negative feedback loop where the necessary
equity infusion just keeps getting delayed and stalled and the company goes and meets other potential investors who
also see this and stall, etc. the whole time the company's finances are deteriorating, until it gets right to the end and
the funds either get equity at an absurd discount with a huge pile or warrants on an already imploding stock price or
they are now providing a DIP loan...


This will be a very interesting stock to watch over the next few months.

Re: "Wait until you see my report on KEYW's cyber/commercial businesses too. In my opinion, virtually zero

These people are investing there livelihood on something with zero chance of success. Yeah, right. You really
are a piece of work.

Author’s reply »  No need to be offensive or mean here Camden. If you have spoken to anyone in the Cyber
security industry who believes KEYW is going to dominate I would love to hear it. I'm still waiting for a
factually supported, math based writeup that quotes people with cyber industry experience to refute the points
I've made. Unsupported speculation is not productive.


I can come up with dozens, perhaps hundreds or thousands, of examples of people investing 'their livelihood"
into companies and ideas that didn't work out. This happens constantly. Just because someone is investing

shareholder money into an idea I don't see how that guarantees or even implies a high probability of success.

Breaching covenants is far from the same thing as going bankrupt. If the business is viable it will be funded with a
decent equity valuation. We shall see.


16 May 2014, 11:13 PM


The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I think the math implies KEYW will need a pretty big equity raise. If this is even possible, I
don't see how that will be good for the stock, so either way it seems like the short position makes sense.

What do u make of insider buying? They've bought since this article


19 May 2014, 08:33 PM


ikarus
I think the report debunked that pretty well. They have bought some more since the report but not $1 million
yet. It feels like they are painting the tape before the equity raise -- this is clearly what Chardan's non-sensical
upgrade was about today.


Report:


The market is not so easily fooled by such tomfoolery, Len! I checked KEYW's historic open market
acquisitions vs. open market dispositions, per CapIQ data, in the $10-12 price range. As they say, "the
numbers don't lie" - KEYW insiders, including Moodispaw, have purchased a total 35,000 shares in this price
range and sold 195,400 shares. This is a staggering divide in dollar terms: I estimate, based on CapIQ data,
that KEYW execs have purchased $396,823 and sold $2,233,622 in a similar price range over time, a
startling 5.6-fold difference. Clearly, insiders would rather take profits at this level, historically speaking.


Len, let's see an immediate $1,000,000+ open market buy by you and the new CFO with your own money
and then we'll talk. Until then, you're not fooling anyone.

Author’s reply »  Hi Chan,  
Tried to address it in the article. Seems like a desperate token buy to try and put a floor on their imploding stock price
ahead of an attempt at an equity raise, but that is just my speculation. Working on a background, history and
summary of KEYW's "cyber" business to so keep an eye out. I love the glamorous portrait!
