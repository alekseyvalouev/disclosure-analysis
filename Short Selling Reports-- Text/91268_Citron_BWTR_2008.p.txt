Red Flags at Basin Water

Over the past year Basin Water (NASDAQ:BWTR) seemed to have been operating their
business out of a black box. It was not until they posted their most recent annual report
on March 17 that we now see a company that is destined to go to 0, just like the
previous water company with the same management team — Western Water (see
below).


Basin Water 10-K


With negative cash flows accelerating and cash
running dry, management of Basin Water decided it
had to either report poor earnings to Wall St. and
show they do not have a business, or commit fraud
… well, you be the judge on that one. The company
admitted themselves they could not make money
due to “poorly priced contracts.”


Basin Water Q3 press release


In 2005, before its IPO Basin appeared to have a legitimate business in treating
contaminated groundwater. This doesn’t mean that they made any money doing this but
they had a legitimate list of customers. However in 2007, after a terrible operating
performance, something changed and the company decided to cross over to the dark
side of corporate negligence.

Client Number 1: VL Capital LLC


Client Number 2: Water Services Solutions, LLC.


The 10-K filed on March 17, 2008 shows us some alarming details that detail how
BWTR has crossed the line and is committing fraud on the public. It is the opinion of
Citron that Basin Water is fabricating their own customers with the intention of
committing fraud on the marketplace and enabling insiders to dump millions of dollars
worth of stock. Lets examine Basin Water’s customer list.


BWTR’s biggest customer for 2007 was VL Capital, from which they generated $4.88
million in revenue. VL purchased Basin Water’s receivables and bailed them out of bad
contracts in the June Q. Yet, most of this transaction is financed with a $3.35 note
receivable. Shareholders of Basin knew nothing about VL Capital until their 10-K was
released; there wasn’t even even a press release announcing the transaction. And why
would BWTR want to sell some A/R? Because their DSOs were a whopping 470 days
on a trailing twelve month basis! This is how the company explains the transaction in
their filings.


“In June 2007, the Company sold 10 of its existing systems with various treatment
capacities which had previously been placed with customers to a third party
affiliate of a bank. As part of this transaction, the Company assigned all of its
future standby fees from these 10 systems to the third party. Net proceeds to the
Company consisted of $500 in cash, plus a non-interest bearing note receivable
due in 72 monthly installments of $56 each, commencing April 2008. The
aggregate present value of the notes is $3,353, which has been recorded by the
Company as notes receivable as of June 30, 2007. The present value of the notes
receivable, together with the cash paid by the third party, have been recorded as
$3,853 of system sales revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.”


So who is this “third party affiliate”? Citron searched the internet and all public
documents and we only found one VL Capital. This was a company that was
incorporated on the last business day of the second quarter in the State of Delaware …
just in the nick of time. No proof of any operating history, not even a D&B credit rating.

Client Number 3: Empire Water


Another customer that seemed to have appeared from nowhere is Water Services
Solutions. Approximately 48% of BWTR’s revenue for Q4 and 26% of the revenue for
the year came from this company. Basin Water never announced any agreement or
contract with Water Services Solutions; they just mysteriously appeared in the 10-K.


Citron did a thorough search on the internet and in public records including Dunn &
Bradstreet and we could not find a company named Water Services Solutions. What we
did find, similar to VL Cap, is that a company was registered in the state of Delaware on
Sep 27, 2007 in the name of Water Services Solutions … just in the nick of time to save
the fourth quarter. Needless to say, BWTR never actually received any money from
Water Services Solutions but rather it was just a receivable. Not even a receivable but
rather an “unbilled receivable”


Citron calls upon Basin Water to identify Water Services Solutions and its principals and
operations.


Now this one is a real doozy. In May of 2007, BWTR bought some water assets for cash
and then turned around and sold them to an OTC shell company which was renamed
Empire Water on December 28, 2007, the last week of the 4th quarter.


Gross margin for Q4 of 07 was $1MM. In the 10-K, $287k of this was generated by a
$653k sale to Empire Water. Given that Basin water’s gross margin has been negative
for the last TWO YEARS, it sure is nice to get someone to pay you a 43% gross margin,
even if it is yourself.


In addition, a $2.5MM gain on sale was recorded in the 4th quarter for a sale of assets
to Empire Water. And who is the CEO of Empire? None other than the former CEO of
Basin Water, Peter Jensen. And did BWTR get any cash for that sale or the $653K
system sale? No. Just stock in Empire Water, a worthless company.


On top of that, without ever mentioning it in a filing or a press release, the VP of
business development Larry Rowe has now mysteriously become the president of
Empire Water.


If Basin Water’s business really had a future, then how can you lose your CEO and
head of Business Development to a start up OTC listed company?

Insider Dumping


Conclusion


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy and these new Tech Kings are leading the way


The obvious question is what type of management would pull a stunt like this?


The former CEO of Basin Peter Jensen, along with current Chairman Scott Katzman
and aforementioned Larry Rowe all used to be employed with Western Water. Mr.
Jensen used to be the Chairman and CEO of Western Water Company. For those of you
who don’t remember, Western Water Company was that high flyer in the 1990s that was
riddled with problems of money laundering, organized crime, and undercover FBI
agents. Needless to say Western Water went bankrupt in 2005.


New York Times Western Water article, 1994


What is most disturbing about the Jenson/Katzman connection is that both men have
had massive insider sales since Q2 of 2007. Mr. Katzman has sold over $1 million worth
of stock and Mr. Jenson has sold close to $2 million. These gentlemen have sold more
in stock than their company has received in real revenues from selling their products
during the same period of time.


To make matters even worse, the dumping of the stock commenced one month after the
company announced a purported “share buyback” on May 14, after announcing a
disastrous quarter. The buyback news allowed the stock to get propped up just in time
for selling.


BWTR Insider Transactions, Last Two Years


There is nothing else to be said except in the opinion of Citron, this stock is a 0. All hope
for a future jumped ship with management. Once you cross the line that Basin Water
has crossed, there is no coming back.


Cautious investing to all.

the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
