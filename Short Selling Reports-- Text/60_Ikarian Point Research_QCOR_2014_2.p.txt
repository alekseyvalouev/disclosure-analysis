Acthar's Future Could Be An Adverse Event For Mallinckrodt

by: Ikarian Point Research


Summary


Recent revelations demonstrate that QCOR's drug Acthar was administered to
patients who suffered hundreds of adverse events and several deaths.


Adverse events related to Acthar occur predominately in NS patients. A real safety
study is needed as no large-scale study on NS patients has ever been performed.


QCOR's clinical trial results to-date leave much to be desired. Efficacy and safety
are questionable. This may become a serious issue for MNK post-merger.


In a Seeking Alpha blog post last October we brought to light shady practices of the
Chronic Disease Fund (CDF) as well as Questcor Pharmaceuticals' (NASDAQ:QCOR) all-
too-cozy relationship with the charity. Since then, the CDF has turned over its entire board
of directors, and the founder and chairman at the center of those activities has severed
ties with the charity. The CDF has stopped the egregious activities, cleaned up its image,
and rededicated itself to helping patients in need. In addition, the CDF is no longer
conducting business with QCOR. Even more impactful, since our whistle-blowing article,
the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has
started taking steps to change the way the entire Patient Assistance Program industry
operates -- specifically around the points we revealed in our post.


Now, we see evidence that we believe is grounds for another government agency, the
FDA, to intervene, this time to safeguard patient health simply by holding QCOR and its
H.P. Acthar Gel to the same standard as modern drugs. We have found that a large
number of the recently reported Acthar-related deaths are people who were taking the
drug for nephrotic syndrome (NS), a vulnerable population for which the drug's safety was
never tested in clinical trials or even established by prior usage.


The New York Times last month broke the news that Acthar is suspected of causing the
deaths of an alarming number of people -- nearly one per month reported to the FDA
since marketing for 'new' indications nephrotic syndrome and rheumatology ramped up,
and possibly dozens more that have not been reported. With that information having been
revealed publicly, QCOR decided that the risks were relevant enough that it had to re-file
portions of its 10-K to include drug safety and other important information. After the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320535-acthars-future-could-be-an-adverse-event-for-mallinckrodt 2/16


company failed to reveal these material facts to investors for quite some time we question
whether QCOR was forced to do so by some outside party. There are several aspects to
this recent filing we find interesting:


1) We take exception to QCOR's statement that, "the types of adverse events that have
occurred are consistent with the current safety profile of Acthar as presented in its
prescribing information." Nowhere in Acthar's prescribing information does it mention
death or disability. As for specific reactions that could lead to death, there is no mention of
some of the common ones being reported in connection with these deaths, such as
respiratory failure and sepsis (blood poisoning).


2) We also disagree that "there is no new safety signal." The New York Times' story on
QCOR's disclosure of the problems quotes an FDA spokeswoman who declined to
comment on actions the agency might take, "Because this is an open compliance matter."
We have to ask, if there is no new safety signal (pharmaco-vigilance-speak for a
previously unknown safety problem), then why is it "an open compliance matter"?


The Wall Street Journal's take on the disclosure quotes pharmacology expert and former
FDA medical officer Dr. David Gortler, PharmD, FCCP, of Georgetown University as
saying there appears to be a safety signal. We reached out to Dr. Gortler who explained,
"Whether or not as a result of increased prescriptions for legacy uses for which the drug
might not be appropriate and has not been clinically tested, the increase in adverse events
... represents a safety signal worthy of attention from both Questcor Pharmaceuticals and
the FDA ... With the FDA-documented under-reporting of spontaneous adverse events,
even the increased numbers seen here are likely a very small percentage of the adverse
events that actually have occurred. "


With many of the deaths occurring in patients being treated for nephrotic syndrome, an
indication for which Acthar's safety has not been assessed in a clinical trial, these deaths
alone strikes us as a new safety signal. QCOR's explanation for the increase in adverse
events as a percentage of prescriptions -- that the drug is being used more extensively in
nephrology and rheumatology patients, who are more susceptible to certain adverse
events -- pretty much makes the point that Acthar is more dangerous in these settings and
should be tested rigorously so that prescribing doctors and patients know the true health
risks.


3) To those who say the dustup is much ado about nothing, we refer you to the words of
an expert on such matters, Brian Overstreet, president of AdverseEvents. "Clearly,
someone over at Questcor made the realization that these safety issues were, in fact, a

big problem. In order to: a) salvage any possible deal with their pending acquirer; and b)
not run afoul of federal securities laws, Questcor needed to get out in front of this story
and publicly disclose what has been reported," wrote Overstreet, whose firm provides
healthcare decision makers 'with important insight on drug safety concerns that were not
revealed during clinical trials, and are not being communicated by the manufacturer.'


4) We also are skeptical of QCOR's statement to the New York Times that the reason the
information was not disclosed previously was because the safety profile of Acthar was
"well known." Maybe to company insiders. Maybe even to the handful of neurologists who
have been prescribing a vial or two to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses for the past
couple decades. But how about the nephrologists who have been putting patients on
Acthar regimens of nearly 11 vials (bi-weekly injections for 6 months)? How many of the
7,400 patients who received the drug during 2013 were aware of the risk of death? We are
assuming not many. In QCOR's words, "Ultimately, each physician must decide for himself
or herself whether the patient's medical condition warrants the use of Acthar. In making
that decision, the physician considers various forms of evidence as to the safety and
efficacy of Acthar for each specific patient." Regardless of whether any failure to
disclosure the drug's risks to doctors is a focus of the previously disclosed Department of
Justice (DOJ) investigation, sound medical practice dictates that those doctors should be
fully informed of the potential negative outcomes as they weigh Acthar's risks against its
potential benefits.


FAERS Data Analysis


According to data published by the New York Times, starting in August 2012 - about the
time QCOR doubled its nephrology sales force and also started actively selling Acthar in
rheumatology settings - adverse reactions to Acthar were a suspected cause for 17
deaths over a 21-month period. Because reporting such incidents to the FDA Adverse
Event Reporting System (FAERS) is voluntary (and time-consuming), drug-safety experts
have estimated that only between 1% and 13% of serious events are actually reported,
with an average of 6%. This analysis implies that the actual occurrences of deaths and
other serious outcomes could be 16 times larger than the figures reported by QCOR or
contained in the FAERS database.


The New York Times data, which it obtained from the FDA, show that since 2012 Acthar
also has been named as a suspected cause for more than 75 hospitalizations, 7 life-
threatening situations, 4 disabilities, and dozens of other complications. The numbers
QCOR reported in its July 10 8-K filing were more inclusive -- 1,022 patients reporting
3,100 adverse events from Jan. 1, 2011, to Dec. 31, 2013, with no details on the number

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320535-acthars-future-could-be-an-adverse-event-for-mallinckrodt 4/16


of deaths, disabilities, or other serious AEs. Adverse event reports in 2014 (through the
mid-April end date of the Times data) appear to be accumulating at a rate more than
double the pace of the previous two years.


A large portion of the adverse events are occurring in patients being treated for nephrotic
syndrome and rheumatology-related conditions. Because the original FDA approval came
before the advent of rigorous clinical trials, there is no clinical-level safety data
underpinning the use of Acthar in these settings. QCOR's sNDA (supplementary new drug
application) approved in 2010 included safety data from studies pertaining only to infantile
spasms; not only are daily dosages for young IS patients lower than for adults, but the
typical NS patient receives 8 vials of the drug, vs. 4 for the average IS patient. Until the
past few years, usage for the NS and rheumatology indications was minimal (hence the
scarcity of safety data in this regard); by QCOR's own admission, it acquired Acthar in
2001 because it was all but "being abandoned" by the prior manufacturer, and only 25 NS
patients had been prescribed the drug before 2010. Importantly, from the FAERS
databases we know that of the 11 Acthar-as-suspected-cause-of-death cases reported in
the 13 months from August 2012 to September 2013 (the latest data publicly available), 8
of those patients were being treated for nephrotic syndrome, 1 for multiple sclerosis
relapse, 1 for lupus, and 1 for opsoclonus myoclonus (off label).


Furthermore, the value of historical safety data would be uncertain given the questions
surrounding what exactly is in the vial. Interestingly, Cigna's Medical Coverage Policy
notes that while the most-recent study evaluating the efficacy of corticotropin (i.e., H.P.
Acthar Gel) in treating acute exacerbations in MS patients was published 25 years ago in
1989, "it is unlikely that the corticotropin or ACTH products studied are identical to
formulations available today." Of course, it is difficult to say for sure what potentially
harmful compounds could be in Acthar, since even Questcor itself doesn't seem to know
exactly and says, "Acthar may potentially include other active peptides" beyond ACTH 1-
39. In our view, these facts could lead the FDA to place more scrutiny on the safety
signals generated from its FAERS data.


How Significant Is the Problem?


It is difficult for even medical professionals to say with certainty that a particular health
reaction was definitively "caused" by a drug. But investors need to understand that
fatalities and other adverse events are included in FAERS only if the reporting person
(typically a doctor) suspects the event was caused by a reaction to the drug rather than to
some other factor like the underlying illness.

It is difficult to know what the FDA considers to be an acceptable frequency of deaths as it
weighs the potential risks and benefits. Certainly some of the 7,400 patients who were
treated with the drug last year had their symptoms at least temporarily alleviated with
minimal side effects. But here again the paucity of research on the newly commercialized
indications is not helping the murky situation.


Depending on how significant the FDA judges the adverse events to be, the agency could
do anything ranging from nothing (a possibility) to minor (request changes in the "warnings
and precautions" section of the labeling, or making additions to "contraindications") to
quite serious (sending a "Dear Doctor" letter warning physicians of previously unknown
safety risks, or requiring a "black box warning") or even worse (requesting removal from
the market). While the latter would be a rare step, recall that Omontys, a drug marketed by
Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY) and Takeda Pharmaceutical (4502.JP), was pulled from the
market last year after being reported as causing 3 deaths and 19 cases of anaphylaxis
among the 25,000 patients who took the anemia drug. AFFY shares, which traded above
$21 in 2013, now trade around $0.10 after the company's board decided to liquidate and
dissolve the company. That's a near 100% wipeout in the share price.


Issues with Acthar Clinical Trials


Now that doctors and potential patients might start to become aware of the possibly
severe adverse effects and potentially be hesitant to try Acthar, it becomes more important
for QCOR to complete randomized, controlled clinical trials in newly marketed indications
such as NS. But here, too, there are issues.


Over the past 3 years, QCOR has spent more than $125 million on research and
development in an attempt to find some evidence that Acthar has efficacy in various
indications. Thus far, the efficacy and adverse event results seem to raise as many
questions as they answer.


The largest effort completed in NS was published in December 2013, a 24-patient study
assessing Acthar in treating idiopathic FSGS. Of 24 patients treated, 21 (88%) of them
suffered a total of 52 adverse events. Authors of the investigator-initiated, QCOR-funded
study downplayed that outcome, writing, "most adverse events were mild and transient,"
and they "included a high rate of steroid-like adverse events." In fact, while none of the
participants in this study died, four were hospitalized due to adverse reactions including an
ischemic stroke, new-onset diabetes, acute kidney injuries, and a transudative pleural
effusion (buildup of fluid around the lungs). The "high rate of steroid-like adverse events"
encompassed only 23 of the 52 reactions (44%). A higher rate (56%) of the adverse

events were of the type not commonly associated with steroids, such as upper respiratory
infections, rashes, pneumonia, headaches, and shortness of breath. Indeed, the adverse
event data seem to concur with the idea that there is more to Acthar's mechanism of
action than just steroidal activity.


In terms of efficacy, fully 16 of the 23 patients (70%) who remained in the study did not
see enough improvement to even be considered to be in "partial remission." Strikingly, 9 of
those patients (39% of total participants) actually suffered increases in their proteinuria.
Two patients of the 23 (9%) achieved "complete remission" while 5 (22%) improved to
"partial remission;" 2 of those responders later relapsed during the follow-up period.


Dr. Andrew Bomback of Columbia University, a co-author on that study, was also co-
author on the groundbreaking study that has been underpinning Acthar's NS franchise
since 2011. In this initial NS study, Bomback and co-authors gathered retrospective data
on 21 of the 25 patients who QCOR said had been the only adults in the U.S. whose NS
symptoms had been treated with Acthar Gel prior to 2010. As would be expected in a non-
clinical, retrospective study, fewer adverse events were noted (6 patients), ranging from
acute renal failure (thankfully resolved after being taken off Acthar) to hyperglycemia and
weight gain (a common reaction to steroids). Efficacy results were noteworthy in the
portion of patients who had been diagnosed with idiopathic membranous nephropathy
(IMN), with 3 of those 11 (27%) achieving full remission and an additional 6 (55%) seeing
partial remission. Of the other 10 patients studied, only one each (10%) achieved
complete and partial remission.


While working on the study and initially collecting on a $50,000-a-year consulting fee from
QCOR, Dr. Bomback was allegedly providing information to a QCOR shareholder who
was charged with insider trading in connection with his conversations with Bomback. Dr.
Bomback, whose annual stipend from QCOR later was reduced to $10,000 to conform to
university rules, appears to have escaped censure from his employer despite possibly
violating the American Society of Nephrologists' policy prohibiting release of study
information before it is published. Still, Bomback's credibility was called into question by at
least one of his colleagues, with Columbia Law School professor John Coffee saying, "...
my bottom line conclusion is that his conduct was unethical … where he knew the intent of
the academic journal's rule." Eight of the study patients were treated in Bomback's own
practice.


The springboard for Acthar's recent sales efforts in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is
a 10-patient study that was trumpeted by QCOR as an "independent investigator-initiated
ten patient study" in which "significant clinical response to Acthar was observed."

Mallinckrodt (MNK) hailed the paper as one of the methods by which the company could
grow sales in indications like SLE that had little prior research backing their inclusion on
Acthar's label. We question what is "independent" about the study, when co-authors Dr.
Justus Fiechtner and Tresa Montroy (who is not a doctor, but did take general nursing
prerequisites at Lansing Community College) both received a grant & research support
from QCOR: "study support and writing support ... were funded by Questcor
Pharmaceuticals." At least that fact was disclosed in the paper, unlike the mysterious
disappearance of results from at least two patients originally in the study.


The SLE study patients all were treated at Dr. Fiechtner's practice and only 2 reported
adverse events. The study reported success in its primary objective - "a reduction in the
intensity of flares as measured by changes from baseline in the SLEDAI-2K score."
Individual results on this measure were not reported (only the group average), and experts
have questioned the metric's value: "The utility of SLEDAI-2K in observational studies,
and more importantly in clinical trials, is limited, as it does not allow one to discern a signal
towards improvement," wrote Dr. Zahi Touma et al. in the journal Rheumatology. On the
patient self-assessments, only 3 reported not doing better on day 28 vs. the initial
screening day (including patient Number 12 in the "10-patient study").


In the MS relapse arena, clinicaltrials.gov lists six current trials with Acthar Gel. We
believe the principal investigators on at least three of those trials have at times appeared
high on the list of Acthar prescribers for MS (and five have close ties with or have received
funding from QCOR - Dr. Brod, Dr. Miller, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Riser, Dr. Berkovich). Another
MS clinical trial worth mentioning is one comparing the performance of Acthar vs. a
second round of IV methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) for patients who already have failed
an initial course of the steroid. After the study reached its halfway point, QCOR cut off
funding; we believe this trial's abrupt cessation was a consequence of the interim results
not favoring Acthar's performance. QCOR's CEO simply told BiopharmInsight: "The trial
wasn't enrolling very well anyway. It isn't something we're particularly interested in."


Bigger picture, the fact that many patients in the ongoing and upcoming clinical trials will
be receiving Acthar as a first-line treatment means that trial results will not be
representative of how the drug will perform in actual practice -- when it generally will be
used on patients who have failed other treatments. This will translate to a trial result that
overstates the efficacy vs. standard-use outcomes on patients responsive to steroids, and
understates the health dangers to patients whose susceptibility to adverse events is
heightened as a result of prior treatments and disease progression.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2320535-acthars-future-could-be-an-adverse-event-for-mallinckrodt 8/16


What liability does QCOR, and by extension MNK post-merger, face from these reported
adverse events and concomitant lack of disclosure? Already, plaintiffs' lawyers are
seeking to prepare cases. "Imagine the agony of a family whose loved one is seriously
hurt or dies as a result of a company pushing a drug that has not been approved or fully
tested for their condition," says attorney Stephen Sheller.


It is an interesting legal question as to whether QCOR should face liability for the
numerous deaths of NS patients -- on one hand, the proteinuria indication is technically
"on label," but on the other it has not been subjected to what a reasonable person would
conclude is adequate clinical safety testing for that condition. Clearly, though, we have no
more insight on how to estimate this potential liability than we do in estimating the liability
for a potential DOJ fine.


Regarding the latter, some type of DOJ penalty appears likely. Last month, in answering a
question from well-regarded Goldman Sachs analyst Gary Nachman at Goldman's
Healthcare Conference about QCOR being, "known to be on the more aggressive side," of
sales and marketing practices, MNK CFO Matt Harbaugh told a group of investors, "The
deal with the DOJ investigation with regards to marketing practice actually speaks to
activities that happened a number of years ago." We interpret this statement to mean
violations did in fact occur, and MNK found them in their due diligence. With sales
commissions that could run in the thousands of dollars for a single Acthar prescription,
such an outcome was perhaps even likely. As for what else is within the scope of the
various government investigations, we can only speculate.


Will Competitors be Safer?


One may be inclined to wonder if the rash of adverse events is related to the fact that the
(labeled) active ingredient in Acthar is a naturally derived polypeptide. This begs the
question: would this fact give a leg up to synthetic competitors that soon will be attempting
to enter the ACTH market that QCOR has forged? It will be very interesting to see the
safety data on Retrophin's RE-034, as well as the data on any of the half-dozen other
ACTH analogs that Retrophin (OTC:RTRX) says are in development. We assume the
synthetic will be safer; in fact, the reason Armour Pharmaceuticals developed a synthetic
Acthar Gel in the 1970s is because scientists recognized that the crude formulation
derived from pigs had harsh side effects. Likewise, it's worth watching a forthcoming drug
in development to treat infantile spasms, CP-115, manufactured by Catalyst
Pharmaceutical Partners (NASDAQ:CPRX), which after pre-clinical development appears
to be a much better drug than the other common IS treatment - vigabatrin - as CP-115 is
much more potent and its side effects theorized to be much milder.

Conclusion


In assessing the potential value of the Acthar franchise to MNK against the potential risks,
we conclude with QCOR's own words:


"Negative health outcomes for patients using Acthar could 1) lessen the frequency
with which physicians decide to prescribe Acthar, 2) encourage physicians to stop
prescribing Acthar to their patients who previously had been prescribed Acthar, 3)
cause reportable serious adverse events and give rise to product liability claims
against us, and 4) result in our need to withdraw or recall Acthar from the
marketplace."

Now that it's almost double the price do you still think it's a buy? At some point the price will be too high. I
have no idea and don't have a position either way but am watching. It's interesting to note the CEO just sold
40K shares in June @ $90 and there's been selling by others as well: http://bit.ly/1rYoB7S

5/20/2018 Acthar's Future Could Be An Adverse Event For Mallinckrodt - Mallinckrodt PLC (NYSE:MNK) | Seeking Alpha

Current price is supported by earnings and growth. CEO and all other stock sales are part of a planned sales
program (most of which are options based sales), so they automatically trigger at a certain points throughout
the year.


The CEO has also been on the road to retirement for some time, so it makes more sense that he would be
divesting most of his holdings in the company now that QCOR is on its road to being "bought out" (more of a
merger - that's why the quotes).

H'man you speak the real truth. I have been trying to refute the shorty thesis of executives "dumping" stock
wherever I can. They use scare tactics and do not present the truth. By now the stock is in strong hands and
these frivolous short attacks do little to change the realities of this growth story.

Hit the nail directly on the head. Nice to see some more common sense coming forward with regards to MNK/QCOR
and this whole mess. I remain extremely cautious and short through puts.


17 Jul 2014, 01:32 PM 


The Highwayman, Contributor
To Quoth and all other SA authors regurgitating the same information regarding Acthar and QCOR, after
awhile it just becomes tiresome. Please stop beating the same old "proverbial horse" regarding potential
Acthar side-effects and put the whole situation in perspective.


How many other drugs have amounted in patient deaths if they're treatments of last resort? Not to mention
the fact that many of these patients who passed away were also on other medications and were extremely ill.
Of course those that are short don't take into account the thousands (or tens of thousands) of patients that
Acthar has helped over the years. Utilitarianism is the name of the game when your dealing with treatments of
last resort.

Raven, Leave no black plume, eh?


I mean "How many of the 7,400 patients who received the drug during 2013 were aware of the risk of death?
We are assuming not many."


Who the h**l are "we" anyway - bet that "we" are all short? The alternative for those with nephrotic syndrome
is usually end stage kidney failure - dialysis and or kidney transplant. So why would "we" assume that these
people didn't carefully weigh the potential adverse events (which have not been demonstrated attributable to
Acthar, only correlated...)...


just another attempt for deperate shorts to lift their souls from out that shadow of loss that lies floating o'er
them now..., which, it now seems clear, "...shall be lifted..."

Boring and repetitive - on the plus side recently whenever a negative SA article about QCOR is released, the stock
price goes up.

Article states "The New York Times last month broke the news that Acthar is suspected of CAUSING the deaths of an
alarming number of people" (caps added to emphasize operative word). Like these authors, the cited article was
written by a short seller, a person with limited integrity, or ability to perform any but the shallowest research. However,
even the NYT article most definitely did NOT allege causation. As soon as you see the quoted sentence, you know
what kind of people were writing this article!


Unfortunately, very old, very sick people sometimes die. Shorts like these always point, Fauntleroyish, to the shortage
of large, double-blind, randomized studies evidencing the effectiveness of Acthar. So, Mr. Short, where are the studies
showing that very old, sick people with the same diseases and conditions, who did NOT receive Acthar, lived longer
than the tiny numbers cited by the NYT?? No, really, where are they? And you speak of "causing"! Should be
ashamed.

Gee it looks like and smells like the author might just be invested in Shkreli's toy company, Retrophin. ( It will be very
interesting to see the safety data on Retrophin's RE-034, as well as the data on any of the half-dozen other ACTH
analogs that Retrophin (OTC:RTRX) says are in development.) More importantly another desperate attempt to
salvage a beaten down short position. Same old, same old.

thank you for the strong article. apparently hearing the truth over and over again is boring to some of your readers,
and irrelevant so long as the stock price disregards the fundamentals of questionable, aggressive marketing tactics
for an unnecessary and ultra-expensive drug, but we enjoyed the read. it sounds like the biggest complaint against
the short thesis here is "the shorts have been saying this stuff for a while and the earnings and share price are still
strong." whether the stock was once $20 or $40 is not really a concern for us; we see what it is priced at today, which
is pretty high given all of the legitimate concerns about the company. wouldn't bet the farm on any short position ever,
but definitely feel good about being short at these prices.


17 Jul 2014, 02:45 PM 


rockstar1
The share price shows that the short thesis hasn't worked. The short thesis is wrong because:


1) the drug works, and


2) the drug is FDA approved for 20 important indications


The shorts have a hard time reconciling the fact that Questcor acquired Acthar for just $100,000 and through
good management (raising the price to reflect the cost) and solid execution (picking indications where Acthar
adds high value and appropriately supporting Acthar for those indications in the market) have parlayed this off
patent biologic into something like half a billion annually in cash flow- and that cash flow is FACT. Part of the
real world. Cash flow is the reason the company is trading for $95 today, and probably worth more than twice
that in the future.


The shorts think the story is "too good to be true." They rely on innuendo and falsehoods to support their
position. Rumors about investigations, falsehoods about reimbursement, tests paid for by short sellers at
mysterious labs, and the threat of competition from RTRX?!


In the real world, RTRX is your short candidate. Look at their cash flow.

what's become painfully obvious, and it's no surprise given the short interest, is that there is a collaborative collusive
effort to get QCOR to go down. From the author of this article to QTR to the NYT and to a thoroughly debunked Citron
report they all wind up quoting and linking to each others articles. In effect it is a giant circle jerk that is having zero
results. I am expecting at least one or two more desperate efforts by shortie between now and the closing of the
QCOR/MNK merger. And those efforts are going to be just as impotent.

monkey see
On oct. 22, 2013, when you first took aim at Qcor it's stock price ranged etween $61.90 and $64.53.


My rough estimate is that Qcor stock is up 50% since. Keep writing these articles because while my percentage profit
on QCor is over 2100% I could always use more particularly since my gains will now be limited because I have to pay
taxes on the cash (boot) received and share Qcor benefits with Mallincrockt. Shareholders.


Hopefully, if there is a subsequent takeover of Mallincrockt -Questcor it won't occur Until 2015because I don't want to
pay that much taxes in one year. I will be more than willing to pay those taxes in 2015.


Looking forward to your next QCOR article.

Using this logic, it is must be a good thing that Acthar is not yet routinely used for Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome, as it is in Phase II trials currently. Even if Acthar does prove to reduce the horrific mortality rates in ARDS,
a large percent would still perish. The safety profile would appear horrible in this scenario, with the reasoning in this
article. The more seriousness the baseline illness, the more horrible the safety will look from the data. The article is
misleads in that it does not provide sufficient context for baseline illness, so as to mislead readers on safety.


17 Jul 2014, 03:36 PM 


pissy_joe65
Have you've interviewed any patients currently taking Acthar as a last resort and how its completely improved their
quality of life? If so, please share

Besides not considering baseline illness, almost anything is dangerous to someone. Peanut butter send some to
anaphylaxis shock. Household dust can trigger an asthmatic to major adverse event or death. A cholesterol lowering

Lets do an intellectual honesty check here-


Let's just look at the CDF claims, from an article the SA publishers allowed to be published under their banner last
year (and is referenced in this article).


Here are the actual, hard-money facts regarding QCOR from that article:


1) QCOR gave away $177 million worth of Acthar Gel to needy patients, and  
2) QCOR donated a further $11 million to charities


Giving away product to those who can't afford it? And donating to charities to help others? Let's see--- they got no
revenues and $10s of millions of costs, (including the donations and the cost to produce and distribute the product
they gave away)--- and the SA article implies they are rigging revenues and earnings upward?


Questcors earnings were materially DEPRESSED ($.020-0.40) in that year by their charitable acts--- and they SAVED
LIVES as well. That piece was an outrageous, intentional misrepresentation of fact.


Furthermore, The author predicted that if QCOR lost the CDF they'd lose 60% of their earnings Ok- does anyone else
find this biased and deceptive? Rehashed? Intellectually dishonest?


Let's just look at the CDF claims, which reference the hit piece SA publishers allowed to be published under their
banner last year.

Anyone who drew the intended conclusion of that hit piece was badly misinformed, and if they acted on it, they
suffered financial harm.


Rehashing this article today should be embarrassing to the editorial staff of SA.

Oops- sorry for the duplicated text-


BUT- this gives us a chance for the QCOR short chant!


"... BUY IT BACK, OR GO TO PRISON"

QCOR only traded a million shares today. Before the end August something like 18 million shares need to be
bought by short sellers and returned to their rightful owners- to do less would be fraud or theft.

Lets do a quick check for intellectual honesty in this article.


Let's just look at the CDF discussion, which references and rehashes claims made in another article SA publishers
allowed to be published under their banner last year.

1) QCOR gave away $177 million worth of Acthar Gel to needy patients, and

revenues and $10s of millions of costs, (including the donations and the cost to produce and distribute the product
they gave away)--- and the SA article implies they overstated revenues and earnings by a factor of 2X?


Questcors earnings were materially DEPRESSED ($.020-0.40) in that year by their charitable acts--- and they SAVED
LIVES as well. That piece was an outrageous, intentional misrepresentation of facts. A hit piece. Something only a
short seller could love.


The author predicted that if QCOR lost the CDF, they'd lose 60% of their earnings AND fall to $23!?! Anyone who
acted on that conclusion, suffered financial harm from false and misleading statements.


Rehashing that old article today should be embarrassing to the editorial staff of SA. And adverse events of less than
5%? Come on. Reading SA editorial coverage QCOR is FAR more adverse.

I can not believe the shorts have continued to beat their drum over & over. They helped me with the pattern they set. I
traded puts & calls, & played both & exercised my calls at lower strike prices to accumulate several hundred shares. I
am ready for the merger with a smile. I made money on puts & bought calls with the profits by carefully selecting
strikes to exercise at below market price. Thank you SHORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

OWNERS: Put your shares in a cash account.


BROKER/DEALERS: Notify your risk management professionals to be sure of your counter-party risks with respect to
Questcor in your stock loan portfolios.


SEEKING ALPHA: In the coming 5 weeks, 17.99 million shares of QCOR need to be repurchased. If you really seek
Alpha, why not inform traders and investors of the expected high demand for these shares? And why keep publishing
innuendo and falsehoods, or damning the company and the merger with faint praise? There's still time to save some
credibility here. (I was impressed you published Sierra Monolith--- but I'd have liked to see his first submission)


SEC: False and misleading statements have been published consistently for the last 2 years regarding Questcor and
Acthar, not only here on Seeking Alpha but well beyond---- to the New York Times and Barron's and elsewhere.
Acting on these false and misleading statements has cost investors, and is ongoing. Plus the whole trading situation
stinks. A 3% borrow on a stock with a 40% short interest? An $8 arb spread in a friendly deal? This thing stinks.
