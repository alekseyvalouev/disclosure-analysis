Cracking The Code On Digimarc: Deteriorating Business Will Continue
To Decline
Jun. 3, 2015 10:37 AM ET20 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Despite DMRC revenue hitting a 5-year low, executive compensation actually rose to
over $6 million – handing execs 26% of total revenue.


Customer concentration danger has revealed itself as DMRC struggles with the loss
of licensing fees as key customers apparently become disenchanted.


DMRC’s net losses have climbed and gross margins have deteriorated. And analysts
are expecting negative earnings of $-2.07 per share, amid some of the industry’s
worst comps.


Though Digimarc (NASDAQ:DMRC) revenue dropped to a five-year low and some
licensing deals have collapsed, executives have raked in more than $6 million in
compensation and sold shares like crazy.


CEO Bruce Davis even got a raise in November, bringing his base salary to $600,000.


Include Mr. Davis's stock awards and 401-K contributions, and it all adds up to $3.39
million.


Not only that but, if and when his job ends, Mr. Davis will receive at least $600,000 yearly
for two years after termination.


Meanwhile, three other top executives just had another $260,000 worth of stock apiece
added to their compensation packages, bringing their total compensation to nearly
$800,000 apiece.


And, just for attending up to five board meetings a year, Digimarc's four directors each
received compensation in the $150,000 range.


Ultimately, compensation for executives and directors in 2014 consumed a jaw-dropping
26 percent of total revenue.

While investors may read exclusively bullish viewpoints here on the Beaverton, Oregon
"invisible" barcode maker, we'll hit on other concerns expected to ultimately send this
highflyer crashing back to reality.


*Insiders yell "Sell!"


Perhaps raising a question about how much faith he may have in his company, CEO
Davis dumped 34,000 shares of Digimarc from Jan. 2, 2015 to June 1, 2015 - a block or
two every month. With the exception of Monday's sale, all were sold for about $2 to $7
less than the recent share price of $29 and change.


Mr. Davis has sold ~91,000 shares since 2014. While he has led all other insiders in
selling company stock, two other officers and two directors also unloaded shares last year.
Nasdaq records show all buys to date were option executions.


Here is a snapshot of sales in the last three months:


(Source: Nasdaq)


*Loss of revenue sources


Maybe Digimarc's concentrated customer base is rightfully spooking insiders. The
company is indeed a text-book case for why it's risky for companies to have a
concentrated customer base.


At one point, 69 percent of Digimarc revenue came from three sources; several central
banks (43%), Neilsen Co. (16%) and Verance Corp. (10%).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3233066-cracking-the-code-on-digimarc-deteriorating-business-will-continue-to-decline 3/11


But the customer base has been crumbling. It took a hit when:


*In 2012, Digimarc and Nielsen suspended operations of their two joint ventures.


*In early 2014, Neilsen bowed out of its licensing deal, ending licensing fees to Digimarc.
Neilsen is now one of Digimarc's biggest rivals.


*In late 2014, Verance whittled down its licensing deal, waiving any future royalties and
licensing fees.


Consequently, here was customer concentration for 2014:


(Source: SEC filings)


And look at the customer concentration now:


(Source: SEC filings)


These figures indicate both the danger of concentration and brings to question the value
of Digimarc's technology since so many major customers now seem anything but
fascinated.


Behind that depressing trend is an interesting story. Although Digimarc tried to dismiss the
Verance troubles as "waiving any future royalties," the two had been snarling and biting for
years like a pair of junkyard dogs.


*Digimarc and customers break into dog fight


Indeed, Digimarc agreements with its biggest clients sometimes turn into revenue-biting
grudge matches.


We've highlighted a couple below:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3233066-cracking-the-code-on-digimarc-deteriorating-business-will-continue-to-decline 4/11


*Verance Corp.: No surprise that Verance's CEO publicly nipped at Digimarc, charging it
provided incomplete and misleading information and resorted to "distortion of the court's
true action," when Digimarc announced settlement of a dispute with Signum Technologies.
The two companies have taken each other to court 12 times in an ongoing dispute related
to patent issues, court records show, ultimately settling in 2012.


*Intellectual Ventures: The company known for leveling patent lawsuits, reached a much-
touted $36 million license fee agreement with Digimarc in 2010. The two also tussled over
potential profit sharing, finally settling that dispute in January 2014.


Intellectual Ventures' license payments to Digimarc ended in 2013. Also, patent sublicense
producing license fees have ended. Consulting fees end this year.


What has all this squabbling with some of its biggest customers - and the general
disappointment with its technology - ultimately meant to Digimarc?


Well …


*Death grip: Revenue and gross profits plummet, net losses jump


As the chart makes all too clear, problems with clients have contributed to significantly
worsening financials in the last two years. Indeed, analysts this year are expecting
negative earnings of $-2.07 per share, amid some of the industry's worst comps.

EB DD
Thank you for your post. I am always happy to hear the short story in any stock I own, and doubly happy when it rests
on mistakes and misunderstandings.


As for the compensation of senior management, since you obviously read the proxy, I am surprised you failed to point
out very important facts that actually make this area a positive, not a negative.


First, the CEO is only granted stock awards every three years, so you need to take your $3.4mln number and divide it
by 3.


Second, the company grants no cash bonuses, so to truly compare the management teams salaries to other
companies, you would need to look at the combination of both salary and cash bonus at these other companies. In
fact, in 2013, the total cash comp for DMRC executives was in the bottom quartile of comparable companies.


Finally, the reason the stock awards look high on a dollar basis is black-scholes 101. The stock is volatile, so the
value of the awards looks high. To normalize for this, most real world investors look at total dilution...ie not what some
formula tells you those shares should be worth, but how much are investors actually being diluted. On this score,
again, DMRC looks very good. Normalizing for the fact the CEO only gets stock awards every three years, senior
managment received 87k RSUs in 2014, or about 1% of the sharecount. The board members each received 3000
shares. These numbers are both very low on their own, even before normalizing for the fact there are no cash
bonuses here.


As for the CEO's sales, again two things worth pointing out. First, no other member of the team is really selling, again
amazing not just in general but also, again, because they don't receive cash bonuses and are paid at the bottom 25%
of peers.


Second, as for the CEO's sales themselves. They are part of a 10b51 that is in place so he can monatize the options
he received when he sold one division of the company for cash for around 30% more than the stock was trading at
the time. Considering he is 62, has a substantial amount of his assets in DMRC stock, is doing this with a clearly
stated plan, and owns over 500k shares including his options and RSUs, these sales doen't seem overly troubling. In
fact I remember this bear case in NFLX at 20 when Reed Hastings was doing the same thing...and he was much
younger and made a lot more in cash each year.


As for the "losing" of customers, both Nielsen and IV were structured as license payments over a finite period of time.
They didn't "lose" these customers, in fact they both still use the patents (and not sure where you got this from, but

Nielsen is in NO WAY a competitor, they still base a larger percentage of their business on DMRC technology). It's
just the deals were structured as term payments, not perpetual. As for Verance, they make DVDs...it wasn't that they
are no longer using the tech, they are...it's just that Verance might very well not be around in 5 years, and so DMRC
opted to receive a lump sum upfront instead of, as you pointed out, fighting with them yet again (also worth
mentioning if you were being intellectually honest... each time, DMRC won).


At over 20 days to cover, and the open ended growth that exists with barcode and discover, don't get me wrong, I love
there are shorts out there. And I wish you the best of luck, especially if this is your thesis.


Can't wait for part 2.

niles-


My guess is they got confused with their disclosures between this piece and the promised part 2, which I'm
sure is already written and waiting to go. I'm sure the plan was to short ahead of part 1 and hope to cover at
lower prices with the threat of part 2. Why else, outside of manipulation, would they tease the existence of
part 2? There's no limit as to the length of the piece, doing it in two parts is about "style," not substance.


Unfortunately the plan didn't work, there are plenty of people taking advantage of the liquidity to buy, and as
we've seen ad nauseam with this new social media type of shorting, part two is always much weaker than
part one...it has to be, you have to put your best stuff in part one or else no one will even bother to read part
two, and in addition you want the stock to go down after part one. See most recently Bill Ackman's much
anticipated and sorely lacking part two on HLF that saw that stock up, what, 20% that day? (note: I have no
idea if HLF is a long or a short, just using that as an example of the new style of social media shorting and
how already the rules there have changed)

My prediction, if these guys actually do follow up with part 2, it will be even weaker than this, and because the
market always likes to cause pain to people who try to manipulate it (not because the market is sentient, but
simply because the removal of the manipulative behavior, which might actually be exacerbated by the
manipulator reversing the action, in this case covering, creates a vacuum the other way), the stock will move
higher as soon as it hits.


We shall see...

EB DD, great rebuttal! The hit piece is based on half truths and hope people don't know better, but we have a pretty
concentrated lot of informed owners here, and for the short case, the truth hurts. I too can't wait for part 2, but even
more what they are going to do as the intentions of big retail and brands becomes more widely known. We could add
a few more examples of the misgivings in their hit piece, but you nailed the high notes. Nice!

What else do you need to know, from streetsweeper's own website: the founder is the proverbial hooker with a heart
of gold, thanks Hunter for cleaning up your act, maybe you should start first with cleaning up your disclosure conflict!


Hunter Adams, a member of the expert advisory board for The Street Sweeper, understands stock manipulation
firsthand. Adams entered the securities industry 15 years ago with a focus on high-risk penny stocks. He quickly
became an expert at establishing shell corporations, executing reverse mergers and selling both equity and
convertible debt in speculative small-cap companies. His career ended in 2001, when government investigators
accused him of manipulating worthless penny stocks. He pled guilty to two conspiracy charges -- for securities fraud
and money laundering -- and served time in prison for his crimes. Years later, he pled guilty to racketeering charges,
fully cooperated with the government and accepted full responsibility for his actions. Today, he has embraced a life of
reform and now hopes to help protect the public by exposing others who tread in the same murky waters he once
swam in. To contact him directly, please send an email to hunter@thestreetsweepe...

EB DD
What else do you need to know part 2...I could do this for hours because this is so much fun (and they are making it
so easy)


from their legal disclaimer page...now the aforementioned disclosure the author is actually short might cause them
some more serious problems...poor Hunter!

if a writer gets paid based off illicit profits reaped from potential short & distort scheme, isn't that basically the same as
being short the security yourself?

they might bear raid it here...but frankly DMRC handled a Streetsweeper hit piece quite well...wasn't until the last hour
when they threw more firepower at to get it down...all in all this smacks more of desperation to me....interesting timing
with June being qtr end and several conferences coming up....

The approach taken in this article is akin to valuing a biotech company who had a drug go generic (licensing of ip
business) and who is in late stage trials with a new compound (digimarc barcode and discover).


And basing the value on their recent financial metrics ONLY.


You can choose a side (positive or negative) on the new product launches. But you can't completely ignore them in
the analysis/valuation of the company.


I don't see any mention of progress and milestones made on the launch of their new product offering. The recently
announced Shazam partnership was not mentioned. Nothing forward looking.


Finally, the disclosure statement is extremely confusing and arguably misleading. The editors cannot take a position
but the company itself can and does?


03 Jun 2015, 06:48 PM


valueinvestor411
The disclosure stmt is hard to understand. But upon reading more, this site is likely funded by profits made from short
selling.


The article added by Edward below shows an example of this (Mark cuban referenced)


Idea in principal is they are like a watchdog site doing investigative reporting and self-funded by profits from their
finding 'bad' companies.


Obviously, this article does NOT espouse that noble cause.


This article paints exactly one half the story without doing a lot of 'investigative research'. The CEO has laid out the
future direction of the company quite nicely. That direction is completely missing from this article. The article is not
balanced in any way.


I repeat my analogy. How could one value a biotech company with a late stage pipeline candidate and not even
provide an opinion on that late stage pipeline candidate.


Finally, in rereading the article, the author never really gets around to coming to a concrete conclusion about the
future prospects of the business. They throw out stats and then make repeated innuendo - jumping to the wrong

conclusion as another writer pointed out on several occasions (term agreements versus perpetual).


The company has foretasted roughly flat revenues in 2015 versus 2014. I view it as the beginning of a turn where ip
licensing declines are being made up for with newer product line growth.


The company hasn't said it yet, but that points to rev growth in 2016 (In my opinion).


Hiding behind the noble cause of 'investigative journalism' to produce a piece like this is pretty sad.

Even though this article was published in 2010 by the U of Maryland School of Journalism, I think it may be very
relevant, especially the comments about Street Sweeper and one of it's principals, Howard Adams.

bottom line and parting comments for the evening. Look forward to part 2 also.


How could one be short DMRC but not include any detailed opinion of Digimarc Barcode, Digimarc Discover or the
partnership announced with Shazam? In addition they did not mention the adoption by Data Logic scanners and per
CEO, that Honeywell and Zebra scanners will soon be incorporating the technology. And industry support of GS1.


CEO also mentioned '...Another large retailer has informed us of intents of being in pilot production soon. The same
retailer has begun integration of our software into their mobile app...' from their last earnings call.


No mention of ANY forward looking items to back their thesis.


This article is not really helpful at all in forming a full picture of the business going forward.


In my opinion, the author does a disservice to anyone wanting to fully understand the company. Whether the reader's
intent is to buy, sell or short. Maybe part 2 will shed some light on that.

04 Jun 2015, 12:29 AM


valueinvestor411
packur, nice detailed write up on your short thesis. I've been listening to the CEO past 2+ years and hear
differently.


Thoughts on industry acceptance and adoption by barcode scanners?


Thoughts on Shazam tie up?


Thoughts on being a GS1 solution provider?


Thoughts on the potential of the product offering itself? You must have done dd on their products to be
shorting.


Assuming you short biotechs too who are in late stage studies. I see this as being very similar

lets take a guess when "part 2" will be released....I have 2 picks....1) the day when Bruce presents at the Univ of

end...anyone else have any picks?


04 Jun 2015, 02:25 AM

I placed a buy order as soon as I saw the article. Valueinvestor, you are on target (get it, on target, lol!) The reason to
buy is for the business that's about to ramp up - barcoding, Shazam, etc. What will the author short next - Netflix
because their DVD rentals are dropping off? To be sure, DMRC is speculative. High risk, but potentially even higher
reward.


04 Jun 2015, 11:04 AM


EB DD
Two things worth considering. First, notice they didn't put part two here, just on their site, where people can't
comment. Obviously they have no interest in getting into a debate, as this is purely a manipulation attempt, and they
realize they don't have any facts behind them.


Moreover, I'd assume the timing of yesterday's piece was more about short interest reporting. At over 20 days to
cover, any additional increase in short interest going to get some attention from people looking to squeeze shorts in
this thinly traded stock. I'm guessing the plan is to begin to cover either ahead of 6/15, or (if they were truly smart),
remain short thru 6/15 and then cover and actually go long before those 6/15 numbers are reported a few weeks after
that.

In either case, based simply on the fact the short thesis is so weak and these guys are by their own admission expert
manipulators of thinly traded stocks, I can't imagine they want to be short if the days to cover is well above 20, so I'd
assume before the 6/15 numbers are public, we're going to see demand for a lot of stock, either to cover ahead of
6/15, or to cover and then go long ahead of the last week in June

In a roaring bull market, sometimes the worst thing to do is make things complicated. If you want to short shares of
companies, pick the one's that are downright fraud ... not on the tipping point of releasing proprietary technology to
the masses.
