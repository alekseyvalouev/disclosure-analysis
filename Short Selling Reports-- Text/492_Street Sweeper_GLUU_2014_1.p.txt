Glu Mobile: Coming Unglued ...

Summary


Kim Kardashian:Hollywood is declining in download rankings, right along with the
reality TV diva's stardom. The game maker now faces challenges that have virtually
wrecked other one-hit game makers.


Recent Facebook announcement is distracting hype because insiders know that
Facebook is moving away from gaming.


Aware that Kim Kardashian is fading, insiders are selling off huge chunks of Glu
Mobile shares.


Rankings have slipped down for Glu games designed to support sagging Kim
Kardashian.


Glu likely overpaid for company in a saturated racing niche, then its top racing game
skids downward, too.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Kim Kardashian and crew's fading "reign of terror," first grabbed the imagination of
mainstream media less than a year ago. It seems Ms. Kardashian's post-baby bikini shot
plastered on US Weekly's cover sold 100,000 fewer magazines than usual and sounded
the warning that the star's popularity is beginning to drain away quicker than you can say,
"Snap a salacious selfie!"


That's downright depressing news … for Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).


The 13-year-old San Francisco, Calif. mobile game maker's free game Kim Kardashian:
Hollywood initially rocketed the share price to the stars from $3.78 to $7.47, higher than
any time since 2007.


But most investors didn't realize that when the company launched the game app on June
25, GLUU arrived late to the Kardashian party.


Ms. Kardashian's fading stardom is just the beginning of an A-list of slip-ups that we
believe make GLUU stock an ugly bet:

SLIP-UP NUMBER 1 - Kim Kardashian has taken a dramatic free-fall since the game's
debut.


Downloads of the Kim apps have fallen, reflecting the namesake's fading popularity. The
download rank is trending downward. Kim captured number 69 overall in iPhone download
ranking in early September, as the chart below shows. But the ranking has tumbled
precipitously to number 163.


Money spent on buying items as players engage in the game is reflected in the similarly
unattractive picture painted by US overall grossing rank shown below. While there has
been a slight weekend recovery, in one month, Kim's ranking fell head-over-stilettos from
number 5 to number 15. The dips keep getting lower under this falling trend.

Kim Kardashian: Hollywood revenue has been falling since July, TheStreetSweeper has
found. Bad news for GLUU's big hit.


"As long as Kim's stardom on mobile ranking charts continues, we anticipate
speculative investors will hang on for the ride," wrote a Benchmark analyst on July
31, explaining the drop from buy to hold. "But a slip on the runway will likely create
valuation pressure over rationalized performance expectations and the necessity for
the Company to generate the next big hit."


Now that the madcap wedding, quickie divorce, rapper wedding, baby bump and post-
baby-body flaunt dramas are over and Kim begins to settle into middle-aged momma-ville,
viewership of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" is reportedly spiraling downward. If this
media slip for Ms. Kardashian continues, the ranking of her namesake game could sag
even more.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 2 - Last week's hype about the Kim Kardashian game being
distributed by Facebook is another indication that GLUU is slipping.


"Nobody plays games on Facebook anymore," said a mobile games analyst who
requested anonymity. "It's quite well known in the industry that Facebook has moved away
from games."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545825-glu-mobile-coming-unglued 4/20


Zynga (ZNGA) offers the best example of the insignificance of a Facebook distribution
because when it went public in 2012, its games were distributed on Facebook. Zynga
shares flew to the $9-$14 range but after Facebook moved away from games and other
issues arose, Zynga collapsed to the $2 range where it remains stuck today.


So the announcement that Kim is now available on Facebook likely will amount to little
more than distracting hype.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 3 - Insiders say, "Sell! Sell! Sell!"


Words to live by in the mobile gaming space: hit-driven business.


"If you have a hit, you're good," an analyst said. "But when the hit goes away, you
better find another hit or you're in trouble."


Insiders know the hit won't last. That's the reason we believe they have been selling
shares faster than Kim can bat those bodacious eyelashes.


So insiders have done nothing but sell for a long time, racking up nearly $1.5 million in
sales just since Aug. 1. Chief financial officer Eric Ludwig and vice president of finance
Gregory Cannon, directly and indirectly through automatic trading plans, significantly
pared down their holdings in just three days as they sold a combined total of 268,042
shares.


Likewise, institutional shareholders know the good times are too short in this business to
even bother getting into it, as shown by the limited institutional shareholder base.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 4 - Recent GLUU games are falling apart.


In an attempt to stem Kim's decline, GLUU last month launched "Amazing Battle
Creatures," which is already losing the battle and shouldn't be counted on to make a
significant contribution to sales. In just a few days, the rank dropped precipitously from 79
to 827.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545825-glu-mobile-coming-unglued 5/20


Other big GLUU games are having issues, too. Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores appears
headed for extinction. Deer Hunter 2014 and Eternity Warriors 3, both expected by the
CEO to make "a solid contribution," failed to hit the top 100 mark in the case of Deer
Hunter, while Eternity's ranking dropped miserably from 189 to 729.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 5 - GLUU pays multi-millions for game maker in saturated niche; its
top racing game then skids.


On July 30, GLUU announced the purchase of Cie Games for about $100 million, or $30
million cash and $70 million in shares.


GLUU chief executive Niccolo de Masi trumpeted the opportunity to drive home more
revenue with "Racing Rivals," the better of only two games published to that point by Cie.


But Benchmark saw big problems, writing the same day of the acquisition
announcement: "The racing genre is saturated in our view, a negative competitive
profile that will likely challenge current and future products, with limited opportunities
for lasting differentiation."


In fact, the chart below shows "Racing Rivals" has not run a good race since GLUU
acquired it for that mountain of money. Just a few months after the acquisition, the game
ranks only about 317, a severe decline in popularity from 195.

Now it looks like the acquisition has all the trappings of Zynga's disastrous $200 million
acquisition of OMGPop. Just a year after plunking down top dollar, Zynga had to shut
down the studio that made the once wildly popular "Draw Something." Zynga's stock
suffered a more than 56 percent decline, collapsing from about $6 to about $2.60, the
current range.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 6: GLUU follows the shaky lead of three stunned gaming companies.


Rovio's once-roaring Angry Birds game has fallen in rankings since its 2011 debut,
prompting last week's announcement that 16 percent or 130 staffers will lose their jobs.


Apparently recognizing the blockbuster was a viral one-hit wonder, the CEO blogged,
"We've been building our team on assumptions of faster growth than have materialized."
He added it's "very tough to produce consistent hits."


Likewise, Zynga got ahead of itself with FarmVille's early massive success and wound up
laying off 520 employees last year. And King Digital Entertainment's (KING) "Candy Crush
Saga" downward trend in rankings virtually predicted the accompanying crush in profit and
revenue. King trades for about $12 - about half the price fetched at its initial public offering
just seven months ago.


With those heady revenues from one-hit wonders burning up their companies' pockets,
game makers tend to go on spending frenzies, building more complex companies always
in search of another evasive big hit.

But the hits don't always keep coming. Yet many analysts' models imagine GLUU popping
out hit after hit. History shows that's just unrealistic.


Investors may find other viewpoints on GLUU HERE.


CONCLUSION:


Kim Kardashian shocked everyone with the game's initial popularity. GLUU's stock price
zoomed up, the company raised $30 million in a public offering and then promptly threw
much of it away on a pricey acquisition that already appears to be spinning into oblivion.


Insiders - aware Ms. Kardashian's app is fizzling right along with her popularity - are
selling off huge chunks of shares before the average investor can put two-and-two
together.


Other gaming companies have been unable to stem the downfall after their big hits fade
and they fail to find another blockbuster. With Kim Kardashian fading fast, other GLUU
games following course and all the other slipups, we wouldn't be surprised to see GLUU
lower fourth quarter guidance.


GLUU is looking more and more like a nearly $500 million fad that fickle retail investors
will dump so they can chase the next big fad.


All in all, we may not have to stick around long before GLUU falls apart.

sirrealone
I'll take it one step further and guess that the slowdown has been less than anticipated. That they waited to
release KKH 2.0 and Diner Dash to the new quarter is telling. I think they will far exceed guidance.


07 Oct 2014, 10:56 AM


roldee
I would agree. Holding releases is a bullish sign. Shifting favorability from the quarter where you have already
exceeded guidance to the next where you would like to get off on the right foot is very common.


07 Oct 2014, 12:43 PM


Joey2shoes
Do you have any clue that the game is based on an engine which can support any celeb. If Ms. K's star fades as you
suggest the game's engine can be switched to the next rising star, whoever that may be. You do notice that it is still
the #5 top grossing game. This means that the previous multi millions of downloads are still being played and the
money keeps coming in. Your article's look and feel seems timed to take full advantage of the nervousness in the
Russel, and the market in general, at this time to create fear in a stock which is going to trump the earnings
expectations for the next two quarters at least. I wonder why that is. This is a disservice to those who are easily
spooked.

What you're calling a slip-up I call expanding platforms.


Kim Kardashian has ( not a fan myself ) been around for a couple of years now, nobody knows what she does but you
don't marry someone like Kanye West if you are a nobody.  
But with her name GLUU revenue rallied thanks to the game and as all games do, the heat fades over time. 
And you know it is time for a new star in the Hollywood platform, don't think you should underestimate this.


GLUU sees money in KK, and vice versa otherwise they wouldn't start the recent contract.


My bottom line, if they release 3-4 Hollywood type games alone in 1 year, revenue would be skyhigh, even with half
the revenue KK produced. 
And they have more platforms that should deliver new games every couple of months.(racing/dino hunter/dash
games)


Good luck with your short, but be careful of a likely future new Hollywood rocket.


07 Oct 2014, 10:58 AM


Bullmarketcall
3/4 hollywood- 1 yr. Released only one, And not only the game is nothing but Kim kardashians stupid voice
and attitudes, 
( which is not the point of discussion as it is OK for those girls who would like to become some Kim
Kardashian and have a devotion to her s personality, looks, and gestures, which they take as model, try to
copy, which is fine) but what the game is made of> is real crap if it would be taken a serious evalution. nothing
but cartoons one after another with not even the least animation, not to consider special effects or sounds.  
i belive the opportunity is wasted in developing a mega star based game with such poor underlying
dedication.  
However, what it is left for the following years is the evolution of the franchise, and developing a serious
game, something like SIMS.  
I belive they were not aware the game would make a sensational use and didnt dedicate entirely to it.  
ope they can in the future.  
As the article points, they would need to become 4 game hits a yr to become sensation. Cross fingers.

Good article but I think it's a trifle one-sided. That's what makes a market. I've noticed some dropoff in KK but to me
that's not unexpected. We play games and get tired and move on. I think $GLUU management gets that.


The insider selling I think is a red flag as are more shares that may come out as acquisition lock-ups expire.


Having said that these guys have an incredible opportunity to build a real company (like an ERTS) on the mobile
platform and I tend to believe they know that. Won't happen in a quarter or even a year but I'd be shocked if they let it
go.

Street Sweeper crew and commenters-in-the-know alike, I had some questions for you:


What are the economics on licensing a KK style game?


And what are the natural decline curves of most of these games?


If management had high conviction on the CIE, why do a 70% share percentage for the acquisition? Seems like they
may think the shares were (are?) overvalued?


07 Oct 2014, 11:51 AM


Stock Market Mike, Contributor
Someone commented in another article here that CIE agreed to a $7 price per share. I don't know if that's
true, but if it is then CIE management thought that was a pretty good price. Otherwise, why accept it?


Wish I could find something to corroborate that. My long thesis is beginning to waver... though I was hedged
for a chunk of this decline, so pain was limited.

GLUU down because of this article? It sounded alright but only if I had done absolutely no due diligence of the
company lol. Pretty convenient pointing to downloads rather than real revenue for all games eh? I see the games
slowly trending downward in revenue over time not dramatic like your crazy graphs. And at 3 more games are coming
to replace them this quarter - Contract Killer Global Assault is piloting in Canada and is up to about 50 in downloads -
too early to see revenue but historically we've seen that success in Canada means greater success in the US.


Facebook moving away from gaming? thats odd, they did a press release talking about they were happy to welcome
quality games like KKH. Post your source.


Constantly comparing Glu to Zynga is tiresome - they are going in two separate directions - one of them is going to be
making money these next 2 quarters I will let you guess who. Glu has proven ROI on 3 of its acquisitions already with
its biggest hits (Deer Hunter, Kim Kardashian, Tap Sports Baseball) and it hasn't even had time to demonstrate
anything for the last two - what will you say if they go 5 for 5? They are more diversified now with several studios and
game engines regardless of the nature of industry.


Looking forward to earnings release and next quarters successes as well.

Just one highlight to show how bad this "report" is. The "author" writes:


"While there has been a slight weekend recovery, in one month, Kim's ranking fell head-over-stilettos from number 5
to number 15"


That "slight weekend recovery" that sent Kim back to number 6 is the release of the Kim 2.0 update. What the authors
does not get is that GLUU will keep releasing those updates and ride a long wave with Kim.


But the most ironic thing is that the "author" is short GLUU because of the hit or miss nature of the industry without
realizing that GLUU strength is exactly in being able to monetize non-hit games for a long time.


Disclaimer: I am long GLUU

The major flaw in this article that the writer has not mentioned or used GROSSING charts to draw conclusions for
revenue estimates. There is NO CORRELATION BETWEEN rankings and grossings. Eg: See Candy Crush, Game of
war etc.. The article should be investigated.

I'm curious as to why there are only 3 comments on this article. I find it very hard to believe that only 3 people had a
comment. I know my comment from earlier is still not showing.

Why is everyone so dismissive? The Company looks OK on a non-gaap perspective, true. However, these corrections
only seem to bring forward revenue and doesn't account for real costs within a business of this type. YTD the
Company had $5mm of stock based comp expense for a company with gross profit of $28mm. That's a real expense.
Amortization of intangibles is added back in a company that earns it's money off of the usable life of its intangibles...

How can you take her seriously? She was an investigative reporter for her whole career....what expertise does she
have in financially looking at stocks? Laughable.


Seeking Alpha has been losing credibility with me as it seems they allow anyone to publish an article to make a quick
buck....turning into Yahoo message boards.


Found one of her hard hitting articles:

I'd listen to Kim Kardashian herself if she had a fundamentally sound investment idea. Of course, 'do your
own research' is implied, but I think seem to be some real red flags around GLUU.

Rationality
Usually the retail players would stay with a stock even during turbulent times. The selling, however, would most likely
be generated by funds and other big players. One thing is certain though, and that is GLUU cannot be considered a
defensive stock in a market that is anticipating a sizeable correction.


07 Oct 2014, 01:49 PM


Bullmarketcall
There seems agreement in this forum that any company cant take seriously some small changes in
downloads for their products. The attack is scam. The writing is based on how many downloads is KK
receiving, while not a clue on gross payments. had there been any other not priced news then this stock
would be in far steep decline.  
The article provides a strange dip, but is oppportunistic as the market is facing a correction and there is a
correlation in the investing community btw GTAT & GLUU, related to some analysts research


07 Oct 2014, 03:23 PM


Dennis R. Mahon
Prediction: $GLUU will show great revenues... gee... not much of a prediction, I guess. Prediction: A biggie will try to
buy them. Again... not much of a prediction. $GLUU is a great game maker and we'll see this a year from now as it
will be a double or triple. Thanks for the article anyway... based on the "all press is good press" theory. I'm long and
staying so.

price....THAT SAYS IT ALL!!

The question is do we hold onto GLUU until the earnings call and sell before or after?


07 Oct 2014, 02:33 PM


Renmycat!
depends on your risk tolerance, and also where the share price goes heading into earnings.  
watch the risk/reward charts, but of course depends how you interpret them (stockcharts.com)


07 Oct 2014, 02:49 PM


jayp186
it's usually been you sell before the earnings - GLUU usually tanks right after the Earnings Call/Report
however this quarter has been different

Hold for longer time. Then you could sell if the picture doesnt look that good

Downloads are leading indicator for future revenues. As many commenters have mentioned, players eventually and
naturally churn off. So without new gamers or downloads on Kim K., the revenues will drop. This is pretty certain.

There is a correlation with between downloads and revenues. Take a look at Deer Hunter 2014 and Eternity Warriors
3. Someone quoted Supercell's Clash of Clans, with declining downloads while revenues maintaining; but really this
game is an anomaly. I don't even think Glu management will claim their game is like Clash of Clans.


I also think Glu overpaid for Cie Games. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a major write off in the future.

racing rivals is still making a lot of $$$$ and will aswell in the future, 
63000$ a day means 1.8 millions a month, means 22 milllions a year. 
The price was 100 millions, so 20% profit on invested capital is not too bad, what do you get on your bank

Check hay day and Farm Heroes Saga, these two games now have similar download numbers(both ranked
150+) and both games are still in top 10 gross although since released in 2012 and 2013.

For the record, I send this email to the editor of streetsweeper: 
YOUR POLICY: 
Do you see a contradiction here? You can't even adhere to your own policies? Just who controls employees, if not the
owners? If you really want to have integrity I suggest everybody associated with the company be banned from owing
or shorting stocks. Otherwise put the disclaimer in bold on top of the article. Shame on you to be an editor of a shoddy
organization.


By all means make money but don't do this at the expenses of others. 
every hit piece has the disclaimer below and every hit piece has the owners shorting the stock. Coincidence?


Important Disclosure: The owners of TheStreetSweeper established a short position in Miller (MILL) and stand to
profit on any future declines in its stock price.


As a matter of policy, however, TheStreetSweeper prohibits members of its editorial team -- including the author of
this report -- from taking financial positions in any of the companies that they cover. To contact Melissa Davis, the

If you've noticed, we're not getting any comments from the author. She's a paid hack with a purpose and this is just a
job for her. The other members of thestreetsweapers can't show their faces apparently. Owners can short/go long,
employees are just paid. Maybe there were ethical reasons for their disappearance on SA.


I look at charts and price reactions to news and markets. We're in a general down market pressur ing longs. Shorts
are seeing whether they can get capitulation from weak longs. The timing of this article coincides with the general
trend of the market. I'm looking to go long GLUU. I think 4.20's.


Hang in there. We're at the 200dma, the 300 is in the 4.20's. It might or might not get there, but GLUU is a stock worth
owning.

Ms.Sonya Colberg, your article sounds like a personal attack on KK. I personally don't like KK but she make millions
of dollars. This is business and you consider yourself a business writer but you have definitely lost your focus . Your
whole presentation of how KK is doing on Gluu totally contradicts your conclusion. This is the best investment gluu
has made with phenomenal return on investment.

LOL @ your declining downloads argument against the MOST DOWNLOADED game of the last 100 days. Of course,
ALL GAMES experience DECLINING DOWNLOADS after 3 months or more in existence. THIS article is DRIVEL.

Well, we've all come to realize this game is trash. Diner Dash (Playfirst studios bought by GLUU) is now released in
every countries. Suggest you have a look for yourself at how well the monetization engine works.  
GLUU is barely a gaming company, they are monetization experts and that is why every single company they buy
becomes a lucrative acquisition in a short amount of time.  
See for yourself if the money on PlayFirst was wasted!


My main concerns is advertising with GLUU, I have yet to see any ad for their games on TV or anywhere.

Glu Mobile's (GLUU) Kim Kardashian Game Loses Shine 
Zacks By Zacks Equity Research 6 hours ago

Apple's Shares Down as Users Encounter Glitches in iPhone 6 Zacks


Reportedly, Glu Mobile’s (GLUU) hit game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood is losing popularity, despite recent content
addition and availability on Facebook (FB). This has negatively impacted Glu Mobile’s share price, which declined
10.14% in the last two days.


Bloomberg quoted an App Annie report that among iPhone downloads – Kim Kardashian: Hollywood – declined from
#89 in the beginning of September to #162 by the end of the month. Currently, the game is #7 among top-grossing
apps on the Apple platform. Per Bloomberg, the game broke into the top five after its release in June, this year.


On its debut, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood received overwhelming response from gamers, which helped Glu Mobile
achieve new single-day records for overall revenues, downloads and daily active users (DAU.V).


Following the game’s success, Glu Mobile expanded its agreement with Kim Kardashian West for another three
years, which is now scheduled to end on Jun 30, 2019.


Most recently, the company launched the game for all registered Facebook users. Approximately 375 million people
play games on Facebook every month on desktops and mobiles. We believe that the launch of the game on
Facebook will significantly increase user base going forward.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2545825-glu-mobile-coming-unglued 20/20


Glu Mobile continues to launch new games that are expected to drive its top-line growth. In September, the company
launched Racing Rivals 2.0 on Facebook’s app center as well as on Apple’s app store and Google Play. The company
expects to launch the next version of its popular franchise, Car Town on mobiles in 2015.


Glu Mobile also announced partnership with Skydance productions that will allow it to develop a free-to-play
Terminator mobile game. The game is set to release in summer 2015 simultaneously with Terminator reboot movie.


We believe that Glu Mobile’s robust and innovative product pipeline is a major growth driver. Moreover, its aggressive
acquisition policy is believed to fetch positive results in the near future. However, competition from the likes of
Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI) remains a major headwind.


Currently, Glu Mobile has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
