AutoChina (Part 1.5) - Imagine if this was a U.S. company?





Stealing from the famous scene in the wonderful book/movie A Time to Kill,
we ask our readers to close their eyes (not literally) and imagine the following
scenario. Imagine a company that came public through the underworld of a
reverse Chinese merger. Imagine this company sold all of its auto dealerships
to an entity called Xinjiang - which at the time represented the only material
operations of the company. Picture the company using a controversial
accounting tactic called sales-type lease accounting that overstates revenue
and pulls forward profits. Now imagine a wildly dilutive earn-out that crushes
existing shareholders while giving the CEO newly issued shares through fiscal
2013 that represent between 5% - 20% annual dilution. Additionally, try to
picture this earn-out being set up in a manner that will still pay the CEO the
maximum – while diluting shareholders by 20%, even if the company misses
estimates by ~ 20% in 2011. Now imagine this same CEO, who receives
ludicrous compensation based upon EBITDA metrics, well imagine him
providing significant levels of related party financing at ZERO PERCENT. Try to
picture a related party page of the 20-F that has 18 rows of transactions, the
largest of which is a grocery store partially owned by the CEO, and partially
owned by a crony Director. Picture a VIE organizational structure that appears
to put equity owners in the precarious position of having no direct ownership
of the operating company. Now imagine this same amoeba of risk having
capital needs for 2011 of approximately $600 million in order to hit analyst
estimates. Now think about the existing CEO marketing an IPO of another
company, where incredibly, he is also the CEO and Chairman. Now imagine

one door down from this CEO, a CFO that was the Director of Research for one
of the largest ponzi schemes in U.S. history…. Now open your eyes and ask
yourself: would this story be acceptable, justify a listing on a U.S. Exchange,
and warrant institutional sponsorship if the company in question was from
California, New York, or even Nevada?





Nearly a week ago, The Forensic Factor ("TFF"), released our first report on
AutoChina.[i] In that report we covered a broad array of topics that provided
the foundation for our assertion that AutoChina has serious accounting
concerns and a corporate structure where equity holders own NOTHING.
AutoChina management published a response several days later discussing
several of TFF's arguments, while completely ignoring others.[ii] It was a
pleasant surprise to see such a verbose response, even if it ignored the most
damaging questions, while manipulating and sensationalized others. TFF
respects management's attempts to communicate - a fact that we will later
explain is necessary given their sizeable funding gap for 2011. TFF has decided
to provide the same courtesy to management of AutoChina with a brief
response of our own. Our response will be brief in nature. TFF will save new
and additional information for our next report - one that will likely require
another response from management (perhaps much more damage control will
be necessary). 





AutoChina's management was correct when they stated it has become popular
to attack Chinese reverse mergers. However, TFF would point out that it hasn't
necessarily been without merit. In many cases, blatant frauds have been
exposed, and at the very least, credible research has been presented
highlighting substantial risks that investors have potentially been ignoring. TFF
wants to be very clear that we do not believe AutoChina is a fictitious
business[iii], it has not lied about its contracts and technology[iv], nor has it
misrepresented its actual inventory or jewelry sales.[v] No, AutoChina actually
operates a real business, and that is the problem.

Lease accounting has been around for decades. As such, investors can expect,
with a high degree of accuracy, a predictable range of frequency and severity
metrics over time. AutoChina's reported financials are such an outlier from the
myriad of historical models that any prudent investor must ask the question -
how? It is the fact TFF can understand what AutoChina does that leads to the
conclusion that AutoChina is a horrible investment and that no prudent
fiduciary can explain how they overlooked: aggressive accounting methods
that have historically been documented as overstating revenues and earnings,
reliance on related party, sub-market rate financing, and an org structure that
ultimately leaves equity shareholders with nothing.





While we absolutely do not think AutoChina is a fraud, we do believe it
possesses all of the warning signs that investors have come to associate with
problematic Chinese companies. In fact, TFF recently reviewed a presentation
by Paul Gillis, a Professor of Accounting at Peking University and the former
PwC Asia-Pacific Managing Partner.[vi] According to Gillis, the warning signs
are:

Slide 7





TFF would note AutoChina has a "check-positive" to all five bullets (at least
until Gillis' old firm PwC completes an annual audit).





The VIE Structure Revisited


In our first report, TFF raised grave concerns that AutoChina shareholders
owned nothing. In fact, we underlined one sentence to emphasize the severe
risk that shareholders faced: " But a more concerning reality for AUTC
shareholders is that based on the org structure it appears equity owners in
AutoChina do NOT own the operating companies." TFF was surprised to see
that management's 10-page response failed to address this seminal issue. In
fact, the VIE explanation, or "Reference I" of management's response, was
comprised of just four sentences. Management's evasive, and carefully chosen
language towards the founding business versus the existing business, suggests
they are acutely aware of the VIE grenade. It is the belief of TFF that truck
leasing is NOT a protected business in China, hence there is no need for this
VIE structure given AutoChina's only business is truck leasing. In fact, TFF has
learned that AutoChina's PRC Counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm, advised the
company that there is no foreseeable legal impediment to the conversion of
these contractual arrangements to a direct ownership structure, or to the
conversion of all of AutoChina's other contractual arrangements since the
applicable foreign investment restrictions have been lifted.[vii] So TFF is very
confused why management would put forth this historical excuse for their VIE
structure. 





How dangerous is AutoChina's corporate structure, one which looks eerily
similar to Rino's as illustrated in our last report? Prominent China research
boutique New York Global Group recently published a report on Chinese VIE's,
with forceful language that should be thoroughly examined by investors in
AutoChina (underlined by TFF for emphasis):

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/136544-autochina-part-1_5-imagine-if-this-was-a-u-s-company 5/14


China based companies with VIE structures are the single biggest “time
bombs” in the U.S. Markets. In a VIE structure, the public shareholders do not
own the underlying assets in the operating entity – the actual business that
generates revenues and earnings for common shareholders. Instead, all of the
sales and incomes reported by the public company and filed with the SEC are
booked through contractual agreements whereby a company’s management
and founders agree to transfer their rights to sales and incomes from the
operating business to the public company. The original founders retain the
ownerships of the underlying tangible hard assets such as cash, factories, land
use rights, machinery, customers etc. In theory and in reality, company
management and founders can choose to walk away and leave the public
shareholders with no legal claims to the assets of an operating entity. Doesn’t
this sound crazy? It certainly does.[viii]





This warning from NYGG is consistent with the concerns raised by TFF that
AutoChina shareholders have no real ownership of the operating companies. In
AutoChina's disclosure segment of its 20-F, a risk statement appears that
validates TFF's concerns, "if there is any change of the PRC laws or regulations
to explicitly prohibit such arrangements, ACG may lose control over, and
revenues from, these companies, which will materially affect ACG’s financial
condition and results of operations." Management did not address this issue in
its response.





AutoChina's Reference A & B & E - Gain on Sale Accounting


TFF read management's response carefully and appreciated management's
candor and thorough examples. With that said, TFF continues to believe a
restatement will be the result of AutoChina's aggressive accounting policies.
Sales-type lease accounting is reserved for manufactures that have captive
finance organizations. Manufacturers have historically used sales-type lease
accounting to recognize higher revenue and gross profit on the sale of the
equipment that they manufacture. Since AutoChina's value proposition is
almost exclusively providing financing, it is unclear how the company justifies
an accounting treatment that has historically been reserved for manufacturers.
Management's explanation would have been accurate… had they also been a

manufacturer of the product to be leased. We believe the company's new
auditor PwC, could confirm our view that the use of sales type lease
accounting by an independent finance company does not conform to GAAP.





The discussion about sales-type lease accounting may prove moot given the
potential for it to go away. Recently, FASB identified lease accounting as an
area of "weakness" and proposed merging their accounting standards with
IASB (International). In August 2010, they issued an exposure draft of the
standard, with the final standard set to be released in the next few months.
[ix] According to the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association, "this may kill
sales-type lease accounting. They want to use the finance lease accounting
method in IAS 17 for all leases."[x] Even AutoChina's new auditors appear to
side with TFF, "PwC Observations: The performance obligation approach
represents a potentially significant change for lessors with sales-type leases
under current standards because, under this model, no revenue would be
recognized immediately; rather, it would be recognized over the lease term."
[xi]





The point is two-fold. TFF believes AutoChina is using an aggressive form of
gain-on-sale accounting with its sales-type lease methodology. This accounting
treatment has historically been utilized by firms with financing and
manufacturing arms under the same umbrella. AutoChina does not have this
structure. Second, it may be moot as oversight momentum is building to
eliminate sales-type lease accounting, which should speak volumes about its
overly-aggressive nature.





Reference C &D - Atrocious cash flow and massive capital needs


There seems to be no disagreement between TFF and AutoChina management
that the company has atrocious cash flow characteristics today. However,
management seems to massage the rationale for the cash flows in their letter
by referencing a "typical vehicle lease, such as that for a passenger car."
Management correctly points out that "the leasing company never reaches
cash flow breakeven during the lease." We agree with this statement. While

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/136544-autochina-part-1_5-imagine-if-this-was-a-u-s-company 7/14


true, this statement is irrelevant and misleading when looking at AutoChina.
The passenger leasing company never reaches break-even on a passenger car,
nor does it really matter for the total economics of the manufacturer. The
leasing company's economics must be viewed in conjunction with the
manufacturing arm. This abusive sales-type accounting allows the entity to
show big profits on day one of a lease. Comparing AutoChina to this model
seems silly. AutoChina's sole business proposition is to make money on it
leases. To state that "it is impressive that we reach breakeven at all" suggests
that management is either clueless (which we do not believe), or is gently
providing a comparison that is not tremendously relevant.





Either way, AutoChina admits that in order to continue its game of growth,
they will need to continue to ramp originations. Examining the estimates of
Daiwa (we were unaware of their coverage until management's letter), the
analyst appears to be assuming 20,625 new leases in 2011 for AutoChina.


At $38,000 per lease with 20% down (very conservative, we think it is
substantially lower), AUTC would need a remarkable $627 million of new
funding. The company's investment portfolio will generate a small fraction of
this amount.

# leases Ave COGS $ Volume (mm) Downpay Cash needs (mm)


20,625 $38,000 $783.8 20% $627.0


Source: Daiwa and TFF analysis.





As such, TFF believes that management desperately needs to secure new
sources of funds, or growth will stall. Where will this cash come from? U.S.
investors? Chinese banks that are under pressure to reduce originations?
After analyzing the most recent disclosures, TFF is convinced that if

the related party transactions slow, the future income statement will
be dramatically different - a fact that AutoChina chose not to discuss
in the numerous tables they provided.





Reference K& L - Related Party Debt


In management's response, TFF was extremely surprised to see the following
quote from the CEO, "Also, I am the Company's second-largest related party
lender and have provided AutoChina with capital from entities of which I own.
I lend this to the Company at 0% interest cost to AutoChina, on an unsecured
basis, repayable on demand."





Shockingly, TFF could only find disclosures for these "interest free" loans in a
footnote in the company's quarterly filings.[xii] We may have missed the
reference or disclosure, but we were unable to find this disclosure in the
company's three earnings press releases year-to-date. The fact AutoChina has
been borrowing from related party entities interest free, or even at below
market rates, significantly distorts the company's normalized income
statement and overstates earnings. While there is nothing illegal with the CEO
making a decision to lend to AutoChina interest free, this should be disclosed
with every financial table so that investors understand that AutoChina's
financial results are not comparable to other lenders based upon the non-arms
length loans.





TFF would also point out AutoChina's disclosure that highlighted Mr. Yong Hui
Li 21% ownership of Beiguo, a percentage that we referenced in Table 7. They
failed however to even mention that he also owns 19.60% of the equity
interest of Renbai. They also neglected to mention that Thomas Luen-Hung
Lau, a director of AutoChina, is the indirect beneficial owner of approximately
21.71% and 20.33% of the equity interest of Beiguo and Renbai. Additionally,
as a teaser for our next report, TFF has learned that Yong Hui Li’s brother has
a company that began extending credit to AutoChina in 2011, a fact that was
also left out of management’s response. According to the most recent annual
report, approximately 60-70% of the total commercial vehicle purchases made

by AutoChina were made pursuant to arrangements with Beiguo and Renbai.
[xiii] TFF is currently waiting on more information on the crony Board that we
look forward to sharing in our next report.





To illustrate why the related party loans are such distorting factors, TFF
analyzed the P&L impact on AutoChina if related party rates adjusted to
market rates. The 4% interest rate that the company discloses in their 20-F,
should result in roughly $16 million in annualized interest expense. At "market
rates," generously assumed to be 7% by TFF (200 basis points below recent
securitization financing of 9%), the pre-tax difference based on our analysis
would equal $0.74 per share, or over 40% of the company's 2010 earnings
estimate.

Total $382.60 $510.10  $15.80 $35.70 $19.90 $0.74





TFF believes AutoChina's disclosure that it has only recognized $4.8 million of
"related party interest expense" year-to-date raises other questions. At a 4%
interest rate, this implies only $158 million of average related party debt. We
could be missing something, but thus far, we have not been able to reconcile
this figure. TFF believes the company is either significantly understating their
related party debt or has found a way to inexplicitly pay off the "$382.6
million" of debt it discloses in its financial statements. Given the fact

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/136544-autochina-part-1_5-imagine-if-this-was-a-u-s-company 10/14


management also used the $382.6 million figure in their letter (reference L),
we wonder out-loud how their related party interest expense would seem to
imply a much lower rate than that which has been disclosed. 





Reference F & G - Minimal loan loss reserves


Management was a stickler when they asserted TFF contradicted itself when
we decried the company's lack of reserves. TFF did not literally mean the
company had no loss reserves, although the actual number (which we clearly
cited) is not far from zero. We apologize if this was confusing, and hope it does
not blur our point. Based on TFF's experience with leasing companies,
transportation finance, auto finance, and banks, we believe AutoChina's
delinquencies and reserves are beyond abnormal. TFF estimates a loan loss
provision equal to just 50% of delinquencies would be worth $0.28 per share,
or over 15% of 2010 earnings per share. Again, we look to the perverse earn-
out as a possible explanation for the aggressive assumptions management has
utilized. 





TFF does believe that loan-to-liquidation value is well north of 100% BEFORE
the company lends fuel, tires and insurance. It is widely accepted that any new
car or truck loses a significant percentage of its value the second it is driven
off of the dealer's lot.  Additionally, the reposition of a truck is expensive and
time consuming, while the losses generated by selling a truck in the secondary
market can be significant. As a result, TFF is skeptical about AutoChina's
statement that it is providing "secured" financing for fuel, tires, and
insurance. 





Finally, history has generally shown that when a company can recognize profits
by simply providing a loan, there is very little incentive to stringently
underwrite a credit. This should sound familiar to anybody that followed the
mortgage catastrophe over the last decade. With that said, TFF concedes it is
possible AutoChina's lending policies, and claims of advanced screening tools,

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/136544-autochina-part-1_5-imagine-if-this-was-a-u-s-company 11/14


could be the driver of their unique credit quality. TFF admits that we could be
wrong and this time it may indeed be different. However, the phrase “this time
it’s different” is usually another way to say “sell.”





Reference J- Restatement Likely


We were critical towards the earn-out that AutoChina has endowed upon its
CEO. We would note that we have no opinion towards Mr. Li; he may very well
be a wonderful person and CEO. Our disdain is directed towards the egregious
nature of the earn-out, the unfavorable incentives and dilution it has created,
and the fact the treatment of the earn-out does not appear to conform to
GAAP accounting. Management’s defense of the earn-out seems to imply that
it is merit based. TFF reads the earn-out very clearly, and this statement is
true for determining the range of dilution (5% - 20%).  However, TFF believes
it is very misleading for management to state “Fact – The earn-out is subject
to certain EBITDA targets,” when in fact the earn-out seems to stipulate a
minimum of 5% dilution in new shares regardless of performance.





Further, TFF believes management was not entirely sincere by failing to discuss
the absurdly low bogeys that the earn-out is based upon.  AutoChina’s earn-
out is not based upon EBITDA targets that are reset annually. Instead, the
earn-out is calculated off of an abnormally low level of projected EBITDA from
2009. With the initial bar set at artificially low levels, 2011 EBITDA could come
in $19 million below consensus expectations (Daiwa) and still result in the
maximum benefit for CEO/dilution for shareholders of 20%. This 19% miss of
expectations that would still create 20% dilution does not exactly register as a
Herculean (or fair) bar for performance.[xiv]





AutoChina's management claims that the $57 million of stock issued to the
CEO in 2010, and the $100 million of stock about to be issued to the CEO is
not compensation expense. Their rationale relies on the argument that the
earnout is "based on performance that is not tied to employment," and has an
"original intent" that would compensate Mr. Li for EBITDA growth. TFF
continues to believe that AutoChina is incorrect. Accounting is not static, nor is

https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/790526-the-forensic-factor/136544-autochina-part-1_5-imagine-if-this-was-a-u-s-company 12/14


it based upon intent. EITF 95-8 clearly states that earn-outs must be classified
as an expense if management is not compensated at levels consistent with
"other key employees." Young Hui Li's compensation of $1.00 per year is
clearly not inline with other employees. TFF believes that AutoChina's
compensation expense is significantly understated because it does not include
a realistic cash comp figure for the CEO, nor does it include the earn-out that
is offered in lieu of cash compensation.





We'll be back with much more in Report 2…


While we respect the open dialogue AutoChina has demonstrated with the
investment community, our thesis still holds. TFF believes that when the dust
settles, AutoChina will be a single digit stock. As of January 24, 2011, the 72
companies in Roth Capital's Chinese Investment Universe Publication traded at
7.7x earnings. If AutoChina simply traded inline with the broad Chinese
universe, it would be $14 per share based upon consensus estimates. Taking
into consideration the possible 50% dilution, the stock would be closer to
$7.00 with an inline multiple to the peer group. However, given the quantity of
issues that TFF has discussed, it would seem logical that investors would value
AUTC at a discount to its peer group (assuming the earnings do not vanish in a
restatement). TFF would point out that should bad debt increase, or funding
dry up, there are ample scenarios where AUTC equity could go to zero. We
believe the serious issues TFF has raised warrant investor skepticism. It is the
opinion of TFF that investors will suffer at least 50% downside from current
levels.
