Where Are China Green Agriculture's 26,175 Branded Stores?

Summary


CGA claims to have invested $113 million to build out a vast network of franchised
retail stores that do not appear to exist.


In its 10-K, CGA claims to have 26,175 branded retailers. We have found little
evidence that they exist.


A December 2013 interview of a CGA employee noted only a few hundred stores
(CGA appears to have taken down the site).


CGA's new website sports a "distribution network" page with links to distributors in
41 cities and provinces, but no valid contacts.


CGA's "special investor days" appear to be a sham as well.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Imagine a world where a small fertilizer company can assign an absurd amount of money
($113 million) toward "marketing-related expenses" to over 1,100 distributors who own or
control over 26,000 claimed retailers - and then give little to no detail about who or where
these distributors and retailers are.


Welcome to the world of China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA).


In our initial report on China Green Agriculture, we announced that one year of time-lapse
video surveillance of CGA's high-margin Jinong fertilizer factory showed it had only
shipped out around 1/10th of the tonnage reportedly sold in CGA's SEC filings. Fertilizer
shipments from CGA's Gufeng factory also appeared lower than the tonnage sold per
SEC filings, albeit with data gathered on a much smaller number of days filmed.


We then exposed CGA's bizarre 2014 reclassification of $41 million of property, plant, and
equipment (PP&E) on its 2012 and 2013 balance sheets to marketing-related deferred
assets. As if that wasn't enough, CGA invested another $72 million in marketing-related
deferred assets in fiscal 2014, bringing the combined investment to $113 million. We
questioned whether any of this investment was real, and we suggested it could merely be

a way to move fake cash off of CGA's balance sheet. As of June 30, 2014, CGA had
almost no cash left on its balance sheet (after deducting $25.7 million of customer
deposits).


Today, we challenge CGA's claimed $113 million investment to build a franchise
network of CGA-branded retailers.


On the fiscal Q2 2014 earnings conference call held February 10, 2014, investor Peter
Siris was the first to ask CGA management for an explanation of the approximately $60
million invested (as of December 31, 2013) in marketing-related deferred assets (Note:
this amount does not even include the $41 million of 2012 and 2013 PP&E that CGA later
reclassified as marketing-related deferred assets in its 2014 10-K).


CEO Li Tao responded to Mr. Siris's question by claiming that the investment was to
establish a vast network of CGA-branded retailers "in every village":

Peter Siris: You spend 60 million dollars in building up this franchise network. What
is that for? Opening up stores? Explain to me where that money is, and when we
should see a return from that, because, if you are spending that money, you are
planning to see better business in the future, right?


CFO Ken Ren: Correct, yes.


Peter Siris: Can you give us some guidance on that? When do we see a return to
us?


...


CEO Li Tao: (In Chinese) I think everyone should understand it's marketing. Of
course, our marketing is not putting advertisements on television and such.
It's more about building our exclusive stores in every village, located in front
of the doors of our end users.


CFO Ken Ren: First of all I like to clarify that the 60 million dollar amount is the total
amount we invested to build or to develop the franchising network. Instead of heavily
putting commercials and advertisements on TV networks, over the television
network, what we did, our focus is to penetrate and build a widely accessible
network to cover the remote area including the countryside and rural villages where
the real users and customers can have easier access to our products broadly.


CEO Li Tao: (In Chinese) I hope our end users, who are farmers, will see our
exclusive stores, our signboard, our products when they walk outside their doors.
When they walk back home they will still see our signboard and product. If buying
products, or meeting friends, they will see our signboards and products.


CFO Ken Ren: Our goal, our vision for these franchise networks is to allow, to make
it feasible for our end users, the less sophisticated farmers to be able to see the
brand awareness, to see it... [technical difficulties in the call] Sorry for the technical
glitch. We are back. We are coming back. I'm gonna resume what I just said and
continue. So our vision, our goal from these franchise networking development
campaign is to make it feasible for our very end product users, the farmers, from
rural village in China, and those unsophisticated farmers would be able to see the
image of the company's products, the company's brand, when they out of their
house, when they walk into the road and the street in their town in their village, and
they make it easier for them to carry, to buy, our products easily back from the retail
outlets, from the franchise outlets, back to their home, to use, to consider it, to study

it at their home, and they can make it feasible or easier for them to carry their
products from their house to their farmland. This is the vision of why we are doing
this, and it's the long-term goal, when these franchise networks take effect.


A recording of this portion of the Q2 2014 conference call can be found here.


CGA gives few details about its distributors' retail network in its SEC filings, despite having
surreptitiously invested $113 million in it over the last three years (including the $41 million
of 2012 and 2013 PP&E reclassified in 2014).


According to the fiscal 2014 10-K, CGA launched a CGA-branded retailer program in
2010, and purportedly has 26,175 such small retailers in its network as of June 30, 2014:


Since the launch of the Pilot Program in January 2010, we have worked closely with
our existing distributors who designate over 26,175 retailers, namely the "China
Green Agriculture Retailers" for fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. We have entered
into agreements with these retailers to prominently display "China Green Agriculture
Authorized Retailer" on their exhibits, and have well-positioned standardized shelf
and product displays in their retail stores. In addition, we provide the retailers with
educational materials on proper product use and billboard ads with our product logo
to attract target farmers.


CGA has provided no evidence to support the existence of this vast network of CGA-
branded retailers, leaving investors on their own to determine whether CGA's retailers
exist. Few investors have the capability to perform even basic due diligence into this
matter. Those proficient in Chinese know that simple web searches turn up little evidence
of CGA's 26,175 branded retailers.


$113 million has been spent for this so-called network with little online presence? How is
this even possible? Common sense would tell us that this massive expenditure should
have a much bigger online presence, if only by accident.


CGA's Chinese websites further call into question the size of CGA's network of
branded retailers


On CGA's Techteam website, we found a December 11, 2013 interview of Hongli Qi, a
graphic designer who worked for Jinong, in which she claimed:



http://blog.geoinvesting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Q2-2014-conference-call-excerpt.mov
5/23/2018 Where Are China Green Agriculture's 26,175 Branded Stores? - China Green Agriculture, Inc. (NYSE:CGA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2565635-where-are-china-green-agricultures-26175-branded-stores 5/17


"济农现在遍布全国几百家的形象店、直营店的外观设计也是我做的"


"The exterior design of the few hundred Jinong exclusive stores, and direct selling
stores were all designed by me."


In the interview, Ms. Qi uses the phrase "exclusive stores," which is the same term that
CEO Li Tao used when answering Peter Siris's question regarding use of the tens of
millions of marketing investment dollars. Putting signboards on a few hundred stores in
China obviously does not cost a fraction of $113 million.


(Note: CGA appears to have removed the link to the interview of Ms. Qi from its Techteam
website. The cached copy of the interview is still available on Baidu here.)


Furthermore, CGA's newest Chinese website, 900cga.com, has a page titled "Distribution
Network." A screenshot of this web page is shown below. Even non-Chinese readers can
see that the links to maps of the distribution network in 41 Chinese provinces and cities
appear to be empty. When you click on the place links above the map on most pages, a
single blue dot appears centered on most of the maps, with no contact details. Only the
Shaanxi and Beijing maps show any contacts at all; however, none of the contacts are
real.


The Shaanxi map shows 3 blue dots, 2 of which show the same phone number, as shown
below:

The phone number is the same for the second Shaanxi location:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2565635-where-are-china-green-agricultures-26175-branded-stores 7/17


We called this number, and were told by the person who answered that it belonged to the
website development company that built CGA's new website.


The map of Beijing shows a single location with a fake "11111111" phone number with a
Chengdu area code, as well as an obviously fake Beijing address ending in "asdasd":

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2565635-where-are-china-green-agricultures-26175-branded-stores 8/17


Here, we are expected to believe that CGA has the expertise and infrastructure to execute
payouts of vast sums of money and coordinate the development of over 26,000
"franchisees," but it cannot simply provide an accurate list of these locations on its
website. Wouldn't CGA have to have a name, address, and phone number, for each
franchisee that it has signed agreements with?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2565635-where-are-china-green-agricultures-26175-branded-stores 9/17


From this, we have reached what we believe to be a fairly obvious conclusion: CGA's
claim to have invested $113 million in marketing-related deferred assets, presumably to
build out a network of 26,175 CGA-branded stores, is doubtful at best and another
example of a pure sham at worst.


We challenge CGA to provide a directory of its branded stores so that investors can
confirm for themselves whether the stores really exist, and then draw their own
conclusions as to whether CGA really invested $113 million into building out its franchise
network.


Once again, we are doubtful CGA will respond, but for some blanket denials and
perfunctory "anti-short seller" language.


To-date, CGA has merely rejected our allegations without presenting any evidence to
disprove our findings. In its press release, CGA bragged about its transparency, but thus
far, it appears to be following the same opaque approach it used when dealing with the
Alfred Little and J Capital allegations in 2010 and 2011. This approach did little to appease
those skeptical of the company, and eventually led to Brean Murray cutting its rating to
"sell," citing CGA's failure to provide evidence refuting the short sellers' reports.


On October 7, 2014, in what seemed like an act of transparency to some, CGA
announced it would hold "special investor days" in Xi'an and Beijing on October 15 and
17, 2014, respectively. CGA asked investors wishing to attend to RSVP the company's
corporate secretary, Ms. Ran Liu, by October 12, 2014. We understand from several
sources that CGA is not replying to investors who have emailed Ms. Liu to confirm their
interest in attending the event. CGA's investor days appear to be open to only close
friends of the management. This is far from adding transparency - the investor days
appear to simply be another sham.

>>The map of Beijing shows a single location with a fake "11111111" phone << 
I think the web site is not really finish. Writing 1111111 is not a sign that this is fake. It gaves the chinese which attends
the conference a chance to easy proof it the these shops are real or not.

This article smells a lot like desperation to me and by todays price action it's apparent that the market sees right
through it. Let's see how much more desperate the shorts become as the x-dividend date of 10/29 approaches.

I think there are obvious reason why they don't show and will never show those addresses, doing that, they will help
the competition to take full advantage, they will know where exactly is CGA located.


Even in mi country, is logical to think about that, you won't provide too much information. The competitor are just in
the corner waiting for whatever it comes from you.

if there is no way to find the addresses, how would you find the stores? that is just plain dumb. every store
has a physical location, thus must have an address. and to not put it on business cards, websites, advertiser
pages would be a red flag

Maybe you are right, but i am a longterm shareholder, and i had exchnaged several emails with CGA. I' am
still invested with 16.000 shares. But i want to know how the stores look like, and i want to know where these
stores are located. 
And i want a full detailed answer to GEO's accusation. CGA IR is worse ! Catastrophic. I still beleave it is an
attractive investment, but they need help from a proffesional IR firm.

I see your point, but those are small franchises, they belong to a niche and small market. You do not need to
advertise them overseas widely because they are targeting local producers.

and built most of these shops in Q3 and Q4. The interview was released on December 11th, but it could be

Short sellers decrease their holdings for lots of reasons, including high borrowing costs and buy-ins by their
brokers.

there are not adresses of the stores on the net. and what? just sit and try to write 25000 adresses . you will be crazy
after first 100.

So they didn't put proper addresses because that would be too tedious? Pay someone to do it. Each address
should already be on file and electronically accessible, unless this company isn't being run properly. All that
money spent on expanding and they can't pay someone $5 an hour to do some data entry? But they had time
to enter some bogus addresses and phone numbers? But they had time to write a letter defending
themselves against fraud accusations? The best defense would be to run the damn business and upload the
addresses to the website so investors can have some confidence and customers can locate product easily.

What will happen if CGA provides a map with all these shops ?


27 Oct 2014, 01:22 PM


Ferdinando Garcia, Contributor
Stock will go up to the sky, while short sellers will lose money.


27 Oct 2014, 01:34 PM


Renmycat!
if they actually had a map, there wouldn't have even been an article.  
the map doesnt exist because the stores dont exist, at least i havent seen one. have you?

Piggy - Can you tell more about your search for stores?

Sino-agri Group sells 10,000 metric tons high-concentrated fertilizer produced by Jinong in the calendar year of 2015;
20,000 metric tons in 2016 and 50,000 metric tons in 2017.

Good question for IR - Jinong appears to running at capacity, so how will it fulfill those orders?


28 Oct 2014, 10:30 PM


piggybanksdead
You, and your frienda are saying that Jinong doesn't run at production capacity ? It is good to see that you
have detected your error.


For the production capacity i think they need a few investments.

I know where these shops are

What & how many shops did you find? Would be useful for CGA to provide some photos of their investments.


29 Dec 2014, 12:09 PM

@Morpheus,


the shops are in china- Just kidding. I tried hard to find the shops. I wrote to the company several times, but they gave
me no addresses. I wrote to Geo Trash and asked them for an address from a distributor, but they have written their
article without interviewing a cga distributor. They can not provide a single address.

Short Sellers still have 2 million shares short. Reduced from 5 million. I am sure that they have covered because they
know there is no fraud. 
CGA need a strong consolidated action to regain trust and valuation. The time frame betwenn Dividend payment and
Q3 earnings release is perfect.


I expect a strong correction in January. I have found some fotos on the techteam server. It was about the awards
given to the best sales people. There were names , written in chinese on these fotos. But CGA has removed these
fotos.


I am convinced that these shops exist. Perhaps these shops are looking some kind of unprofessional. CGA's
management has a strong distrust against us, because they never know if you are a manipulator like GEO Trash, or a
real investor. Ferdinando told me, that they are willing to show the addresses if you make an onsite visit.

This is Morpheus, thanks for the info, I'm down over £1.5k in CGA and unsure whether to hold on. There's better
opportunities out there and CGA may be just one to watch. I think Sales figures are key here (assuming they're legit)
as that will define the future upside for them. If sales are going up then that in some way proves the dist. chain is
working.

I suppose this wasn't a real dividend check I received?


02 Feb 2015, 05:11 PM


piggybanksdead
It is a real check. Paid by GEO

any progress on CGA case? is it a legit company or not?

They paid a dividend, has won big contracts with government, CEO received 3 billion Yuan for one of his new startup
from chinese government and we are at the end of Q3 what could be a great quarter.
