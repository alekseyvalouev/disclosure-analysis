Focus Media's Explanation Comes Up Short: Part 2, The Theater
Count
Feb. 6, 2012 9:01 AM ET17 comments
by: Matt Berry


Focus Media Holding's Ltd. (NASDAQ:FMCN)


Before being caught short with its LCD inventory count (see prior article), Focus Media
claimed in 2008 to have over 27,000 theaters in its movie theater network. (here) Muddy
Waters Research called them out on that one too: there were unfortunately less than
1,600 urban theaters in all of China that year ‒ which puts FMCN's count off by only …
about … 25,000. (here) Focus Media recently submitted an amended filing, explaining that
they were not really talking about theaters, but …


Prior to 2009, we calculated the size of its movie theater network by calculating the
number of screens on which each of its advertisers had purchased advertising and
then summing the screen count for each advertiser to produce an aggregate number
of screens. (Amended SEC 20-F)


My answers to this are No and No and No.


1) No. The original statement was very clear,


As of December 31, 2008, we had rights to lease advertising time on screens in
27,164 movie theaters in cities across China. (SEC 20-F, 2008)


and:


The increase is primarily due to … (3) increased leasing costs associated with time
we rent on movie theatre screens as a result of an increase in the number of
theaters we leased in our network from 10,930 in 2007 to 27,164 in 2008. (SEC 20-
F, 2009)


2) No, the movie count for 2008 ‒ "27,164" ‒ persisted beyond 2008. What are we
supposed to believe? That they changed the calculation method "prior to 2009" but
continued using the number, "27,164," one month before 2011? The filing date of the
above amended 2009 20-F was December 10, 2010. If the method of calculation changed
prior to 2009 why not mention that change in the 2009 20-F? "Prior to 2009"? I couldn't

even find a mention of the new method of calculation prior to 2012? Let me put this softly.
It would be a statement against myself not to hold out the strong possibility that this
"change of methodology" was a result of being exposed by Muddy Waters' Research.
(Filing detail)


3) No matter how recklessly we twist the two statements to force reconciliation, 27,164 is
just too big of a number. We can't use it without suffering an irreconcilable contradiction
between the two statements. Let me show you what I mean:


What could the number "27,164" refer to?


We're not talking about theaters, because there were only 1,545 Urban Movie theaters in
all of China in 2008. We're not talking about screens because there were only 4,097
Urban Movie screens in all of China in 2008. (See: A Critical Failure in the Focus Media
Story.)


So what does that number represent?


Focus Media offered us an answer, but only if we forget that Focus Media had ever
mentioned theaters or screens. We must accept a very convoluted explanation that the
number, "27,164," only refers to "purchased advertisements." It's the only way the math
can work. But why such a confusing explanation? The words "theaters," "screens,"
"network," "advertisers," and "purchased ads" were spread out in the passage as a five-
year-old would spread green peas on his plate to fool Mom into thinking he had finally
eaten some. In the end, the peas are still on the plate and Mom hasn't been fooled: What
happened to the 27,000 theaters Focus Media claimed in 2008? … or in the document
filed one month before 2011? (SEC Amendment #4, 20-F filed December 10, 2010, "Filing
Detail" link above.)


Assets were misrepresented. There is no middle ground here. Who was supposed to
know that "theaters" were not concrete things, but transactions? What did investors think
they were buying? How was an investor really supposed to value a network of 27,000
theaters in 2008? If that number was not correct, where did the revenue come from for
those years? How many other numbers have to be corrected? Have we carried into 2012
"contributions" to equity from non-existent businesses?


Focus Media claimed to have refuted Muddy Waters Research. That's well said, but
anyone can say that. For example, I can claim that I have refuted the equation two plus
two equals four, but I cannot demonstrate that claim. This point is worth underscoring: a
refutation is demonstrated, not merely declared.

As of December 31, 2008, we had rights to lease advertising time on screens in
27,164 movie theaters in cities across China.


This is a very clear sentence. From that statement to the most recent amended filing,
Focus Media in not so few words has basically debated with itself before the SEC and
investors:


Dec 2010: "As we've been telling you again and again for the last two years, we had a
network of 27,164 theaters."


Jan 2012: "Not true, those were 27,164 purchased advertisements."


Focus Media has cornered itself. Its past revenue is highly suspect. Just as apples are not
oranges and poster frames are not LCD displays ‒ 27,000 theaters are not 27,000
purchased advertisements. The company has indeed demonstrated a refutation ‒ of their
own prior filings.


Disclosure: I am short FMCN.

When it comes to revenue, these points don't really move the needle. The real thrust of the MW report had to do with
the $1 billion plus in write-offs over the past five years. That's astounding and the number of corporate entities
involved with these acquisitions leave the possibility for nefarious self-dealing wide open.

Author’s reply »  This is a confirmation of one of MW's points. It is also a treatment of management credibility
and investor confusion. Pointing at any single theme will always "neglect" to point to the other 359 degrees of
available topics.

Matt I hope you covered some of your shorts today. Your articles drip with anger that should be directed at MW for
exagerating the mudane and leaving you behind when they covered their shorts.

Author’s reply »  I didn't invest in MW. I shorted FMCN through conclusions drawn from evidence presented
by MW. There is a big difference between following other people and finding yourself among others who are
also using grounded reasoning. It is very difficult for the former to know that difference.


Whether or not MW has covered does not change my basis for remaining short. It only makes sense for me to
cover before my target price if new, adverse information arrives -- or if I find a better short.


As for "anger" -- I found myself laughing when I first read about the theater count.

You got to ask what's the motivation of management team to "lie about" its LCD count? People will not buy the stock
just because it has 50% more LCD screens, will they? Moreover, the management team would like to pump up the
stock price so that they could buyback shares at higher price (given the fact that the company bought back a lot of
shares at higher price)?

There is a big error in your analysis. What if FMCN used a Chinese character which means both LCD and Paper
Screen? And another character which means both advertisements and theater screens?


You made the mistake all western investors do: they don't realize everything is different in China. Look at Muddy
Waters track Record, they got crushed on ONP, SPRD and TRE. Citron got crushed on HRBN. Geoinvesting got
crushed on HOGS and HRBN. Alfred Little and affiliates have been put in prison without trial. Absaroka is being sued
and is losing his hedge fund. Absaroka lawyers get threatening phone calls, a successful tactic to intimidate shorts.
When you own the law enforcement, you run a good company and tight ship.


If you didn't know by now, you should realize, in China everything can be bended to one's will. That's why the shorts
will lose and will be your downfall. Are you scared yet?

So maybe FMCN translated it in two ways from their Chinese filings. Everything is explainable in China.

"Advertisements on our poster frame network and LCD 1.0 picture frame devices on our LCD display network
consist of full-color glossy advertising posters designed and provided by our advertising clients."

FMCN trades in the USA. Their filings are in English. No Chinese characters are used in this text.

The post speaks to the way in which the company counts its LCD screens (which have been independently verified by
Ipsos Marketing Consulting Company, the world's fifth largest market research company), but it says nothing about
the company's actual cash flow generation.


A company's valuation is predicated on its future cash flow potential. There have been questions raised about how
those cash flows have been diverted in the past. The company has responded to each of those questions in kind, and
the market has digested those responses. As far as the future is concerned, the company has already agreed to pay
out as much as 55%, but certainly no less than 25%, of its annual cash flows (as measured by its non-GAAP net
income) in the form of a recurring dividend to all shareholders... which includes the non-GAAP net income already
produced for 2011. Therefore, when the company's fourth quarter earnings (and thus the amount of dividend) are
announced next month, the investor community will have even more assurances that the power of the Focus Media
cash flow machine is very real, and will result in actual dollars in the pockets of all Focus Media shareholders.

Author’s reply »  Ipsos verified that there were about 30,000 LCD 1.0 picture frames, which the company
explained did not use liquid crystal technology. They were traditional picture frames ‒ IE, non-electric. This
means that Ipsos' work proves MW's claim that the LCD count was inflated: the company did not have
180,000 LCD displays in its LCD network as previously claimed.


The post speaks of the credibility of management. Unless you have derived your "cash flow" numbers from
some source other than the SEC filings, then you are downstream of management's claims.


Madoff's funds were backed by Billions of dollars, downstream from his own claims. 
Markopolos went upstream of Maddof's claims and looked at the underlying reality. He found that Madoff's
trading style required more option trades than existed in the market ‒ but "no one listened." 
Why would I care about the billions of dollars Madoff is claiming when the story he tells of his money-making
engine has suffered a critical failure?


FMCN claimed a network of theaters that exceeded the number of theaters available in all of china: 27,000
vs. 1,600.


Because I do not trust management, I do not begin with the financials as reported to the SEC.

This is what I quoted from their December 10th filing of their 2009 20-F: "As of December 31, 2009, we had rights to
lease advertising time on screens in 269 movie theaters in cities across China. " You can go and search for yourself. I
think they are trying to correct the numbers they reported in pre-2009 reports, but they probably just inadvertantly
missed the other piece that you mentioned. But they did mention this correct piece at the front.

Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  .The 27,000 theaters refers to 2008 and this 2008 number was indeed claimed in the 2009
20-F. It was even included in a filing made as late as Dec. 2010. This flies in the face of FMCN's claim that
they "changed" their counting system Pre-2009.


Also, look at the theater count and revenue for the year 2007 as claimed in the 2008 20-F. Then go to the
2007 20-F and look for them. Try it

Matt,


Please. Why do you want to fix your look at 2007 and 2008. To me, this are irrelant already as long as their
2009 2010 and 2011 numbers are correct. Their 2009 20-F is correct. They do not intend to defraud anyone.


15 Feb 2012, 12:22 PM


Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The 2008 and 2007 20-f theater counts show that FMCN management is unreliable. The
most recent 20-f disclosures show that the LCD counts were inflated and that management has misled
investors.


Once you lose confidence in the source of your information, you should not rely on their information going
forward.


"They do not intend to defraud anyone." -- this is humorous. Of course, there is no such thing as accidental
fraud. The issue of "intention" leaves us with a choice between incompetence and outright fraud -- neither one
of which is a reason for investing.

@Matt


Why don´t you point your critics to the fact of massive insider dealings, self-enrichment of management through
related-party transactions and overpayment for acquisitions which are accounted for as 70% impaired?

I happen to think that most people invested in FMCN are more guided by wishful thinking rather than critical
reasoning. Managements explanations don´t make any sense, they have a track record of lying and levels of self-
dealing activity is outrageous. 
A massive ponzi scheme is being run here with its only purpose to enrich insiders.

I read the responses to this article and laugh.... Of course reporting by chinese companies are not trustable. How do i
know? I live in Shanghai. People in China don't trust at all information from listed companies.


When chinese companies list in the US, they have no choice but to play by the US rules but they still try to twist and
bend whenever they can. If you ask Chairman Jiang, he'll honestly think he's very transparent and straight..... by
chinese standards.


Just look at how pathethic the chinese stock market has performed in the last few years. Chinese GDP grew 8-10%
every year but their stock market has been going the opposite direction. Chinese investors are not even buying
shares of their own companies. Why? Answer is simple..... They don't trust those numbers !
