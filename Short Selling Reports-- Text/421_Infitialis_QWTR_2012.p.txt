Halted In British Columbia, Quest Water Global Promotes Shares To
U.S. Investors
Aug. 9, 2012 5:28 PM ET10 comments
by: Infitialis


What is it about Vancouver that spawns a disproportionate amount of OTCBB-listed
companies engaged in promotional campaigns? Year after year our friends up north lead
the way in exporting blatant scams upon the US retail investor using the means and
instrumentalities of the US communications networks as well as our postal service.


Even more disturbing is that the securities regulator in British Columbia (BCSC) has
become more proactive than our own regulators in identifying and halting these scams
before they are perpetuated. They do so by using their limited powers in Canada to halt
the trading in these securities by market participants that fall under their regulation.


Unfortunately, these halts do little to protect the US investor as the shares can remain
available for trading by US market participants when there is a lack of coordination
between two regulatory agencies. That being said, a BCSC halt has generally been a
leading indicator for a subsequent rapid decline in the price of the halted security, as
eventually US investors - and sometimes even the regulators - catch on.


Such is the case with the newest export from up north: Quest Water Global, Inc.
(OTCPK:QWTR). The BCSC (the provincal equivalent of the SEC in Canada) has already
done its job and halted the shares of QWTR, meaning it is currently illegal to transact in
the securities of QWTR up north. Shockingly, QWTR shares are still allowed to trade in the
US (for the time being) providing the unscrupulous promoters with a window of opportunity
to sell their shares to the unsophisticated investor at artificial prices.


In this report we will provide convincing evidence that the inherent value of QWTR is zero
compared to its current market valuation of $122,400,000.


QWTR Capital Structure & Fundamentals


Shares Outstanding 84,577,860


Cash as of March 30,2012 $346,456 (likely much lower now)


Debts & Liabilities as of March 30, 2012 $-933,411 (likely higher now)

The Business


The story being sold to us is that somehow Quest Water with its $364,000 in cash is going
to build AQUAtap machines that will produce up to 20,000 liters a day of water as well as
a WEPS machine that will turn air into water. To continue delving into the story would be
an insult to the readers of this report given that any elementary review of the SEC filings
would confirm that there can be no rationalization for the $120 million market valuation.


We prefer to focus on the reason shares of QWTR are rising and that is due to the
electronic and offline promotional campaign being initiated by the promoters who appear
to own 30,500,000 shares of the company. Dreams of turning air into water will most likely
end in zero revenue, profits, or anything accretive to the shareholders of QWTR several
months from now. In supporting this statement we point readers to the following fact: The
promoters behind QWTR have spent over $900,000 distributing glossy promotional
mailers and over $100,000 paying online email spammers. It does not take a genius to

realize that a company which has had 3x the amount of cash on its books spent on
promoting its shares is more interested in selling shares to investors than building its
business.


What the promoters paid for their 30,500,000 shares:


On the S-1 filed on 8/17/2010 RPM Dental (The shell company that later merged with
QWTR) registered 1,525,000 shares @ $.02 cents per share. But $.02 cents was not a
cheap enough price for the promoters, so they engaged in an exercise to lower their cost
average even further:


(NYSE:E) On February 20, 2012, the Company completed a 20 for 1 forward split of its common


stock. All share amounts have been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented.


And just like magic the promoters now own 30,500,000 shares of QWTR at a split-
adjusted average cost of $.001 per share. Given the current share price of $1.43 the
promoters are up 140,000% on their investment of $30,500. In other words their $30,500
investment is now worth $43,615,000. There is a caveat… they have to sell those shares
to you!


The Players Involved


John Balanko - President & CEO/Director - touts on his resume extensive experience in
corporate finance. Our extensive research discovered a track record of failure that
included bankrupt and delisted companies. Most disturbing is that every single publicly
traded company John Balanko has been associated with has delivered significant losses
to investors with an average loss of between 90-100%.


Mr. Balanko's name first appears in the public domain on December 7th, 1994, when he
was appointed as Director of Fountain House Holding Corp.:


"FOUNTAIN HOUSE HOLDING CORP. ("FHH-V")


- Appointment of Director


Luke van der Horst, President of Fountain House Holding Corp., announces that
John D. Balanko has been appointed a Director of the Company effective December
7, 1994."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/795891-halted-in-british-columbia-quest-water-global-promotes-shares-to-u-s-investors 4/13


Fountain House was a company that purported to sell DrinkCentres in the late 1990's. In
2002 it changed its name to Abbastar Holdings (ABA) and after implementing a few
reverse splits changed its name again to Abbastar Uranium in 2009. On the date Mr.
Balanko's name is first mentioned (December 1994) shares of ABA traded at a split
adjusted price of $38 dollars per share. Today you can buy those same shares for $.04.


Next, Mr. Balanko's name appears on a press release issued by a pink sheet listed
company: ShowStar Entertainment (SHST). What might you think did SHST do for its
investors? Well for one, it officially added the word Online to its name right before the
internet bubble changing its name to ShowStar Online.com in 1999. Then in 2002 it
presciently diversified into energy naming itself Sonoran Energy which was heavily touted
until April of 2010 at which point Sonoran filed for bankruptcy and became (OTC:SNRNQ).
During this period, the various reincarnations of this company traded down from a split
adjusted high of $80 to $.0015 at the time it filed for Bankruptcy.


Next in 2007 we have the most relevant of companies in Mr. Balanko's track record with
alarming similarities to QWTR. At the time of my writing, the company named S2CGlobal
(OTCPK:STWG) currently trades at $.007 per share. Such was not the case when Mr.
Balanko's name first appeared in the filings of the Company.


John Balanko, on April 1, 2006, entered into an agreement to act as Head of
Corporate Finance for the 2006 calendar year for 350,000 common shares to be
issued at a deemed value of $0.07 per share with 175,000 shares issued on June
30, 2006, 87,500 to be issued on September 30, 2006, and 87,500 on December 30,
2006.


Here is a snippet from a Press Release issued in January 2007 by S2C Global:


S2C Initiates First USA Installation of Aquaduct


LAS VEGAS, NEVADA -- (MARKET WIRE) -- 01/11/07 -- In keeping with S2C Global
Systems, Inc.'s (OTCBB: STWG) business strategy to disseminate Aquaduct
automated water distribution systems in major retail water markets throughout North
America, S2C is placing its first USA Aquaduct just north of Houston, Texas, in The
Woodlands."


And here we have Mr. Balanko's signature at the bottom:

Besides misspelling Aqueduct, this venture achieved another remarkable feat delivering
investors an 80% loss in 2007 - one of the best periods for the US stock markets.


From here the next time we hear of Mr. Balanko is on March 7, 2012, when QWTR issued
him 2.5 million shares. As if to add insult to injury, Mr. Balanko couldn't even go out of his
way to think of an innovative new name for his new stock promotion, electing to simply
change "duct" with "tap":


VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 26, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quest
Water Global, Inc. ("Quest" and or "Quest Water" and or "Company"), an innovative
water technology company, and developer of the AQUAtap(NYSE:TM) Community
Drinking Water Station and WEPS Water Extraction and Purification System,
provides the following corporate update to its shareholders:


Peter Miele - VP Corporate Development/Director - With Peter we were able to find
even more questionable activity starting with his association with S2C Global as well as
several other companies including: Transact Energy (OTCBB: TEGY) which delivered
investors a 97% loss and currently trades for $.07 a share and a Canadian company
formerly named Cineimage. That company was worth as much as $4 per share before
dropping to $.015 and being suspended indefinitely for trading by the Toronto Stock
Exchange.


Next we see Mr. Miele's name appear interestingly enough in an SEC filing for an OTCBB
company named Quest Oil (OTCBB:QOIL), in February 2005:


16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


On January 5, 2005, the Company appointed Peter Miele as Vice-President of Marketing.

As you might have predicted by now QOIL trades at $.0001, making Peter the winner in
terms of delivering the largest nominal shareholder losses having been associated with a
company that traded at the lowest mathematically possible price per share.


Let us recap the track records of the two executives running Quest Water:

association with delivered a nearly total loss to investors. To us the most troubling
discovery of all is the association of both Mr. Balanko and Mr. Miele with S2C Global

which also touted a similar water related product named Aquaduct. It is also troubling to
see the word Quest used in Quest Oil indicating a severe lack of creativity on the part of
the promoters and their cavalier approach to manufacturing these companies.


The Promotion


Thus far we have established that QWTR and its management team are repeat offenders
in the OTCBB promotional space. We will now explore the mechanisms being employed
by the promoters to drive the share price of QWTR to these unimaginable levels.


We have identified two methods being employed by the promoters of QWTR. The first was
an online email spam campaign initiated by the websites: OTCJournal.com,
StockHunter.us and Wall Street Whispers.


Website/Newsletter Date Initiated Link Compensation


Stock Hunter 7/30/2012 Newsletter $10,000


OTC Journal 8/1/2012 Newsletter $10,000


Whisper From Wall Street 8/1/2012 Newsletter $10,000


These electronic spam campaigns worked well causing a significant increase in the
volume of QWTR. Between 7/30/2012 to 8/2/2012 QWTR share volume rose from 89,774
to 370,300, an over 300% increase in 3 days. But this was only the first course of the
promotion. Around July 26th, investors from around the country began to report receiving
a 16 page glossy magazine entitled: "The Global Water Crisis & HOW YOU CAN PROFIT
FROM IT". This newsletter was distributed by a company named MicroCap MarketPlace
with its editor being Mike Casson. A simple search for Mike Casson produced several
negative results such as this CBS news article documenting another promotion Mike
Casson was involved in FEWP.


Staying focused on QWTR we obtained images of the glossy mailer and have attached
them to this report:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/795891-halted-in-british-columbia-quest-water-global-promotes-shares-to-u-s-investors 8/13


Cover Page Disclaimer disclosing a company named Resource Project Partners paid


$900,000 for the marketing and dissemination of the report.


Who would pay so much money for such a promotional campaign? To us the most logical
conclusion would be the owners of those 30,500,000 shares we discussed previously.
Using Google we searched for the name Resource Project Partners that paid for the
glossy mailer as well as the electronic spam campaigns.


The first relevant result was an exhibit from a prospectus filed with the BCSC on a
Canadian listed copper company: On Page 3 we found a company named Resource
Project Partners I Inc. based in Panama. At first we were unsure whether the name of the
company matched the name disclosed in the mailer, but after further digging we have little
doubt that the two are the same entity.


Next, we initiated a Panama Corporate Search as well as another search using Dan O
huiggin's archived search results on Panamanian Companies.

Official most recent results from Panama Corporate Registry


showing the names: Erwin Speckert, Dimitri Fortin, and Livia


Floria.


Archived results showing an


additional Director: William John


Voaden.


THE SMOKING GUN


The results indicate that a total of 4 people may be possibly associated with the
undisclosed 30,500,000 share float in QWTR:


1. Erwin Speckert
2. Dimitri A. Fortin
3. Livia Floria
4. William John Voaden


Naturally we decided to dig up whatever we could find on these individuals. To our
complete surprise only last week Erwin Speckert was charged by the BCSC for financing
over $8.2 million in promotional mailer campaigns for OTCBB Companies. Mr. Eckert who
lives in Switzerland refused to cooperate with the authorities. Even more relevant are two
articles written by David Baines of the Vancouver Sun here and here documenting the
intricacies of this operation as well as a connection to Abbotsford, BC and an individual
named Colin McCabe.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/795891-halted-in-british-columbia-quest-water-global-promotes-shares-to-u-s-investors 10/13


Erwin Speckert purports to be a Switzerland based asset manager heading a company
named Everest Asset Management. This however appears to be a front as Mr. Speckerts
name is connected to too many OTCBB companies and questionable individuals.
Culminating in what we view as the strongest evidence connecting Erwin Speckert (and
possibly Dimitri Fortin and/or William Voaden) to the QWTR float we found the following
buried in an 8K filed by Quest Water on January 6th, 2012:


As part of the merger with RPM Dental (the QWTR shell) QWTR added an exhibit which
disclosed the names of QWTR shareholders who owned shares of QWTR at the time. Mr.
Erwin Speckert through a company named SIHL Investments International shows up as
owning 2,000,000 shares post-split shares of QWTR.


From this we can only deduce that Mr. Speckert and possibly Mr. Fortin and Mr. Voaden
are the puppet masters who have paid for the dissemination of the MicroCap MarketPlace
mailer making it very likely that they are the owners of the 30,500,000 shares being sold to
unsuspecting investors.


We are being very careful to connect Mr. William Voaden to all of this as he appears to
have a squeaky clean image having served as the director of Pan Pacific Aggregates,
PLC now named Astar Minerals, PLC which trades on the London Stock Exchange under
the symbol(ASTA) as well as VSA Capital an FSA regulated financial firm. With that said
this was not the first time Mr. Voaden was associated with Mr. Speckert. In a filing with the
UK Financial Regulator in 2005 we found that Mr. Speckert held shares in Pan Pacific
Aggregates (nearly 20% of the company). Another interesting and highly coincidental fact
is that Astar Minerals owns rock quarries in Abbotsford BC the same town where Colin
Mccabe the writer of the newsletters is based.


As for Dimitri Fortin, the only information we were able to find on him was from a
disclosure by a company named Datrontech PLC in November of 1995. Apparently Mr.
Fortin was the owner of a Switzerland based company named C Connect Limited that was
sold for $4.91 million to Datrontech:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/795891-halted-in-british-columbia-quest-water-global-promotes-shares-to-u-s-investors 11/13


In the year ended 31 December 1994, C Connect reported a profit before taxation,
as adjusted for UK GAAP, of SFr 0.80 million (0.44 million pounds, based on an
exchange rate of SFr 1.81:1 pound) on turnover of SFr 25.2 million (13.9 million
pounds). As at 31 December 1994, C Connect had audited net assets of SFr 2.4
million (1.3 million pounds). Following the acquisition, Dimitri Fortin and Markus
Werth, Managing Director and Marketing Manager of C Connect respectively, will
work together with Datrontech to take advantage of the many opportunities that are
anticipated.


As one can see it is nearly impossible for us with our limited range of tools to identify
exactly who is profiting from the sale of the 30,500,000 shares. We have done the best job
we can to highlight the names of the individuals which have shown up through our
research and who we suspect are involved in some way, shape, or form, but it will be up to
the regulators to confirm these connections.


The BCSC Steps In


As we mentioned at the beginning of this report, the BCSC stepped in on August 1st, 2012
and halted the shares of QWTR essentially restricting any Canadian bank, broker, or
institution from transacting in the shares. While we can only guess we assume that the
BCSC was putting the various pieces of the puzzle together and attempting to block Erwin
Speckert and his cronies from yet another promotional campaign that would result in more
investor losses.


For those investors that would even consider being long shares of QWTR after this report
we should warn that the last BCSC Halt FMNL dropped over 70% in one day as investors
and regulators received word that the company was engaging in a promotional campaign.
Tread carefully!


Conclusion


We urge investors to stay away from QWTR as we have documented dozens of red flags
which point towards this being nothing more than an elaborate scheme to sell worthless
shares by offshore residents to US Investors. In full disclosure we are short shares of
QWTR but stress that the amount is insignificant as a percentage of our total assets. Our
goal in writing such an exhaustive report is to prevent unsophisticated investors from
buying into the hype and losing their investment capital to unscrupulous promoters.

Great research. QWTR is a scam and hopefully they will stop promoting their shares to the retail investor in an effort
to dump them. If they want to dump their shares stop telling the average person to buy it when the only person
profiting will be the people behind promo.

This has nothing to do with the SEC. A fool and his money are soon parted.

I received a nice copy of this glossy mailer just today (9/14) and went on the Internet to see how much I could buy of a
new company that had a machine that would "purify ocean and brackish water" and produce up to "100,000 gallons of
drinkable water a day". This wonderous machine can also be "dismantled within an hour and taken somewhere else".
Why wouldn't I want at least a zillion shares? raystom in Seattle

I too just received the glossy mailer mentioned above. Of course, I would not have invested in this company without
the required due diligence on my part. But after reading this article, which by the way, contains a very in-depth
investigative report that rivals the best of CNBC, 60 Minutes, and the others, I decided to forgo an iota of work in
analyzing this.


Thank you for your efforts. I am now a devoted follower.

Oh my what a surprise, another Vancouver scam.  
The governing bodies in the Canada and the United States I would think that the days of the reverse mergers should
have minimum requirements of cash ,"REAL ASSETS", and to get rid of the individuals that pull off the scams .  
Lastly , the Board of Governors of the Vancouver Exchange should be locked up as well,

So the stock has crashed since the report as you predicted. When will they delist the stock or when will it go
bankrupt?
