Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions
 
Some Questions for State Attorneys General and Boards of Pharmacy


Is a pharmaceutical manufacturer allowed to own or effectively control a pharmacy in your
home state?


If a third party obtains effective control over a pharmacy licensed in your state, is a new
registration filing required?


If a pharmacy owner sells all or a portion of its economic interest in a pharmacy in your
state, is it required to update its registration?


Is it a violation of state law in your state to fail to disclose the ultimate holder of control
and/or economic interest in a pharmacy? That is, if Valeant exercises control or holds an
economic interest in Philidor, and Philidor is a regulated owner of a Pharmacy, has Philidor
violated your state registration laws by failing to mention the ownership and/or control of
Philidor by Valeant?


May two pharmacies “share” a National Provider Identifier when dispensing medications in
your state, as it has been alleged R&O and Philidor have done?


Does the law in your state allow a pharmacy to seek reimbursement for prescriptions filled
from government or private payers using an identifier such as an NPI#, NDPCP#, or
NABP# not assigned to it? If not, what potential legal consequences and penalties would
attach?


For the California Attorney General: as Philidor Rx Services LLC is not licensed as a mail-
order pharmacy, is it allowed to purchase directly or indirectly, the equity of or an option to
purchase the equity of a pharmacy (R&O) that is registered in California?


For the California Attorney General: if we interpose another entity into the prior question—
Valeant owns and controls part of Philidor that owns and controls part of Isolani that owns
and controls part of R&O Pharmacy—has R&O complied with California licensing and
disclosure laws, on penalty of perjury?


For the Pennsylvania Attorney General: as Isolani LLC is not registered as a foreign
corporation in your state but owns an interest in a pharmacy (R&O) that is registered in
Pennsylvania, how is it able to operate based in Hatboro, PA?


 
Some Questions for US Attorneys and Inspectors General of Medicare, HHS, and the VA


May two pharmacies “share” a National Provider Identifier when introducing medications
into interstate commerce, using the telephone and mail, as Philidor and R&O are alleged
to have done?


Does federal law allow a pharmacy to seek reimbursement for prescriptions filled from
government or private payers using an identifier such as an NPI#, NDPCP#, or NABP# not
assigned to it? If not, what potential legal consequences and penalties would attach? 


It has been alleged in documents filed with the court in a lawsuit by Isolani against R&O
Pharmacy that Philidor encouraged the owner of R&O to falsely certify the results of a
prescription audit by one of its payer clients. It has also been alleged that Philidor used
identifiers (such as NPI#, NCPDP#, and NABP#) belonging to other pharmacies to send
invoices to payers for prescriptions filled.


Will you investigate whether the actions of Philidor Rx Services to constitutes
“health care fraud” under 18 USC § 1347, which applies to public and private
providers of health benefits and does not require actual knowledge or specific
intent?


Similarly, if proven, will you investigate what is alleged to be a specific intent to
deceive payers in this way could potentially constitute mail or wire fraud, as

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 2/27


defined in the federal statutes?


What steps are pharmaceutical manufacturers and/or their wholly-or-partially owned
pharmacies required to take to ensure that persons eligible for government-paid
prescriptions are not offered waivers, coupons, or charity assistance, in whole or in part,
for prescription co-payments?  Will you investigate whether such steps have been taken
by Philidor and its affiliate pharmacies?


 
A Question for Senator Claire McCaskill


Will your staff investigate and will you convene a hearing of the Senate’s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations to discuss these issues and others related to Valeant's
business practices and their compliance with state and federal laws?


 
Some Questions for Government and Private Payers


Have you - as alleged in some internet posts by disgruntled employees - failed to
reimburse drugs distributed by Valeant but then been shopped by Valeant to other
"seemingly independent" pharmacies. [Philidor it is alleged tried switching distributor
codes to fool your controls.]


Will you continue to accept claims for payment from Philidor Rx Services LLC, R&O
Pharmacy, West Wilshire Pharmacy, Safe Rx Pharmacy, Orbit Pharmacy?


Will you undertake an audit (or re-open past audits) of these pharmacies to determine their
continued eligibility to seek reimbursement from you for prescriptions dispensed?


Will drugs manufactured or marketed by Valeant in the future require more stringent pre-
clearances or other restrictions?


 
Some Questions for Valeant


Are there any other entities with whom Valeant has relationships like Philidor Rx Services
LLC or its affiliates that haven’t been disclosed yet? 


Are there any other entities for which Valeant holds an option to acquire ownership that
have not yet been disclosed?


You have stated that Philidor administers Valeant’s patient co-pay assistance programs. In
the last conference call, Mr. Pearson indicated that spending on these programs has
grown at a compounded rate of 128% annually, rising from $53M in 2012 to a projected
total of over $1 billion in 2016. (In your letter to Senator McCaskill, Mr. Pearson indicated
that spending on such assistance programs totalled $544M in 2014 and an estimated
$630M for 2015.)


What portion of these annual amounts does Philidor administer?


What instructions have you given Philidor in administering these programs?


What criteria have you instructed Philidor to use in determining patient eligibility
for these programs?


How do you monitor Philidor and other entities to ensure that patients meet the
criteria you have established?


How do you reward (or punish) Philidor and other entities for adhering (or not)
to these criteria?


What controls do you have in place to ensure that Philidor administers these
programs legally? Systematically waiving co-pays for claims that would
otherwise be paid by Medicare or other government programs is illegal.


Have you ever, prior to the arrival of subpoenas from US Attorneys, disciplined
Philidor or withheld or otherwise delayed payment because individual staff of
Philidor have broken these laws? If so, what actions were taken? In what
amounts, when and why? How have you ensured that any such problem has
not recurred and will not do so again in the future?


How many Valeant employees, contractors, or agents (whether full or part-
time) are responsible, in whole or in part, for monitoring Philidor’s compliance
with your guidelines and state and federal law? How often do you and your
executive team review Philidor’s adherence to your guidelines and to state and
federal law regarding co-pay assistance?


How is Philidor compensated for operating this program on your behalf? Is any
portion of their compensation based on prescription volume dispensed or

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 3/27


revenue generated?


In the conference call Mr. Pearson stated that Valeant funds multiple outside
foundations that have multiple donors. What are the names and locations of
these foundations and what portion of its operating revenue do Valeant
donations represent? Who are the five largest donors to each?


Presumably these foundations fund copays for medicare and other government
sponsored pharmaceutical insurance. Which outside institutions? How much
money?


How are these donations accounted for in your GAAP accounts? Where do
these donations appear in your audited financials reported on form 10-K?  


How do you determine the amount of assistance to provide each year? How
did you select the $1B projected total for 2016?


How do you assess whether you are getting value for money for your charitable
deductions?


What controls do you maintain to ensure that shareholders receive value for
the $1B in contributions? Have your auditors inspected those controls?


Who (which individual or group of individuals) determines which patients will
receive co-pay assistance, and for which products? Are the individuals making
such award determinations employees of Valeant, Philidor, or a third party? (If
a third party, who?) How are these individuals compensated?


Of the billion dollars of patient assistance expense that you expect in 2016 how
much is administered through Philidor and how much is through other parties?
Who are the other parties and for what amounts of this expenditure do you
expect each will be responsible?


Can you provide a detailed breakdown of patient assistance costs by product
or business line? How much for instance is neurology, dermatology,
ophthalmology, etc.?


It is our impression that Philidor is heavily focussed on dermatology. Is that
correct?


If so, who administers the patient assistance outside dermatology and how do
you control them?


What proportion of your dermatology products are sold with patient assistance?


What proportion of your products (in dermatology or not) are sold to
government-insured patients?


What proportion of your products (in dermatology or not) are sold to
government-insured patients with patient assistance programs?


How is it the case that Philidor administers your co-pay assistance programs,
yet you indicated that Philidor is responsible for only certain of your products,
most of which are dermatological in nature?


You indicate that the form of assistance ranges from capped co-pays to
subsidized prescriptions to referrals to a foundation (for patients in federal
programs) to which you contribute. What was the total amount of assistance
awarded for each category?


Which foundations received such grants from Valeant, and in what amounts,
over the past three years? How much did each of those foundations dispense
as part of the assistance programs for drugs produced and or marketed by
Valeant? What portion of each charity’s total funding does Valeant represent in
each case?


What portion of this and prior years’ “patient assistance” programs funding was
used to reimburse prescriptions filled by Philidor or other affiliated pharmacies?
What portion went to non-Valeant affiliated “specialty pharmacies?” What
portion went to non-Valeant affiliated “traditional” pharmacies?


For each of the products that you indicate is covered by your patient assistance
programs, how much assistance has been provided for each, in what form, and
by whom?


How do you ensure that patients who receive a reduced co-payment, in whole
or in part, do not subsequently submit reimbursement requests to government-
paid programs for which they may be eligible?

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 4/27


Before you received the subpoenas from two US Attorneys had you been having ongoing
dialogue with them or did the subpoenas come entirely by surprise?


I know that you are not disclosing the detailed questions in these subpoenas
but can you answer one question: in aggregate, how long are these document
requests by number of pages? Are they five pages, fifty pages or five hundred
pages?


Do you know if any of your independent administrators of your patient
assistance programs have received subpoenas? Has Philidor (or any of its
affiliates) received subpoenas?


How is Philidor compensated for the services it provides to you? Is any part of Philidor’s
compensation based on the volume of prescriptions filled, revenues or co-pay assistance
(of any type) awarded?


You have stated that Philidor will dispense a drug in advance of an insurer’s commitment
to reimburse you for the cost of that drug, and that Valeant thus bears the risk that the
insurer billed by Philidor will not pay.


If a co-pay is waived, diminished via a coupon, or paid in whole or in part by a
charity, how do you ensure that prescriptions filled by Philidor will ultimately be
approved by the insurance company?


Are Philidor employees given any sort of incentive to ensure that the
prescriptions are indeed reimbursable?


What portion of insurance claims submitted by Philidor over the past several
quarters were disputed or went unpaid?


To your knowledge, has Philidor ever failed an audit by a payer? If so, who,
when, and why?


How often do senior staff members of Valeant meet with senior staff of Philidor?


Will Valeant file copies of its contracts and agreements with Philidor Rx Services LLC, its
owners/members, and its affiliates with the Securities and Exchange Commission?


It has been reported online by individuals purporting to be former Philidor employees that
Valeant had its own employees on-site and that Philidor employees were instructed to
deny any link to Valeant. To your knowledge:


Do any Valeant employees, contractors or agents presently work full- or part-
time in any Philidor office? Have they previously?


Has any employee of Philidor been instructed to deny or otherwise obfuscate
the relationship between Valeant and Philidor? Has any Valeant employee,
contractor, or agent so instructed any employee or member of Philidor?


In your relationship with Philidor, past and present, what was and what is the role of Gary
Tanner?


Why does Gary Tanner, upon belief an employee of Valeant until recently, have an internal
email at Philidor in the name of a “Super Hero?” Can you tell us which “Super Hero” Mr.
Tanner uses for his “avatar?”


Will the Board of Directors capable law firm/forensic accounting firm be hired to
independently assess the situation? When?


When were members of the Board of Directors first informed of your commercial,
operational, and/or financial relationship with Philidor, its owners, or its employees? What
were they told? What such information have they been provided since?


When were your auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, first informed of your
commercial, operational, and/or financial relationship with Philidor, its owners, or its
employees? What were they told? What such information have they been provided since?


Had it not been for press reports regarding the relationship with Philidor, the lawsuits
between you and R&O, and the lawsuit between Isolani LLC and Russell Reitz, what plans
did you have to disclose your relationship with Philidor and R&O? If you had no plans, why
not?


There are reports online of doctors suggesting that their patients fill prescriptions at
Philidor to save money on co-payments.


How do doctors know about Philidor? Do you or your salespeople inform them?
If not, how are the doctors finding out about Philidor?

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 5/27


Are your sales representatives aware of your relationship with Philidor? When
were they so informed? Was Philidor or its affiliates mentioned as part of your
representative training?


Are your sales representatives instructed to or in any way compensated for
informing the prescribers they visit of Philidor’s existence or its ability to waive
or diminish, in whole or in part, co-payments for products produced or
marketed by Valeant?


Do your sales reps carry literature of any kind that mentions Philidor?


How does Philidor compensate Valeant for such referrals, if any?


Alternatively, how are patients made aware of Philidor’s existence? If it is by prescribers,
why? Are any incentives or materials provided by Valeant or Philidor or its employees or
contractors to make patients aware of such pharmacies’ existence?


You have stated that Valeant takes reimbursement risk on prescriptions filled through
Philidor, which is patient-dependent. To your knowledge, have patients filled prescriptions
for drugs other than those sold by Valeant at Philidor pharmacies? [On belief this may
happen if a Valeant prescription is written along with a prescription for a non-Valeant
product. Does it happen when there is no Valeant product on the script?]


What is the total amount of revenue from Philidor that is consolidated on your financial
statements that is derived from cash co-payments Philidor received for prescriptions it
filled?


You stated on your 3Q2015 conference call that “[Philidor] does not restrict prescriptions it
fills to any particular manufacturer.” What portion of Philidor’s revenue that is consolidated
on your financial statements is from sales of non-Valeant products?


You also stated that “[Philidor] dispenses generic products as specified in the patient's
prescription or as requested by the patient.”


What portion of prescriptions filled by Philidor are for non-branded generics?
What portion of total prescriptions filled with non-branded generics were written
on the prescription and what portion were requested by the patient?


If a patient does not request a generic but a non-branded generic is available,
will the Philidor pharmacist suggest such a generic?


To your knowledge has Philidor or Philidor staff ever written a dispense as
written code on the script without being specifically directed to by the doctor or
the patient?


To your knowledge, are pharmacists at Philidor pharmacies allowed to suggest generic
alternatives when available?


If not, why not? Who gave the pharmacists you employ such direction? And if
not, what gives you legal comfort that the states in which Philidor is licensed
allow a non-pharmacist to give such instruction to a pharmacist?


Have Valeant officers or employees, whether full or part-time and present or
former, given any direction to pharmacists employed, whether current or
former, full or part-time, as to whether to suggest substitution of generic drugs?
To your knowledge, have officers or senior staff at Philidor or its affiliates so
instructed the licensed pharmacists they employ?


What portion of the revenue from Philidor that you consolidate on your financial
statements is derived from products not produced or marketed by Valeant? What portion
of such revenue is for generic substitutes for prescriptions written for brand-name
products, and for which products?


In its rejected filing in California, Philidor indicated that its upstream wholesale supplier
was Kinray, a division of Cardinal Health.


To your knowledge, is that correct? To your knowledge, has Philidor purchased
your products from any other wholesalers? If so, whom? Do you now, or have
you previously, shipped products produced or marketed by Valeant directly to
Philidor?


Do you include inventory held at Kinray or any other wholesaler used by
Philidor or its affiliates as part of the consolidated inventory of Philidor held on
your balance sheet?


Were you aware that Philidor’s application for licensure as a mail-order pharmacy had

actions did you take or communications did you have with your employees, the
management, or the owners of Philidor, if any, upon learning that information?


To your knowledge, did Philidor ship any prescriptions to consumers in California or other
states in which it was not licensed?


If so, when were you so informed? What corrective action did you suggest if
any?


If not, what impact did Philidor’s inability to legally fill prescriptions in California
have on its relationship with you and/or the entries consolidated on your
financial statements?


What steps did you take, if any, to ensure that Philidor was licensed in each of the states
to which it shipped prescriptions for your products?


Before you acquired an option to purchase Philidor, did your employees or agents perform
any sort of audit or inspection of Philidor’s state licensing status? Did they inquire as to
whether Philidor had ever had a license denied or revoked, or if Philidor had improperly
shipped product to states in which it was not licensed?


Were any Valeant officers, employees, agents, or contractors aware, as Philidor CEO
Andy Davenport indicated in an email to Russell Reitz and filed in a court proceeding, that
Philidor had a practice of using an identifier (such as an NPI, NCPDP, or NABP number)
belonging to another entity to bill payers for prescriptions it filled? Did you inquire about
this in your diligence process as part of the option to acquire equity in Philidor? If not, why
not?


Was any officer, employee, agent or contractor of Valeant involved in the acquisition of
R&O Pharmacy from Russell Reitz by Isolani LLC?


To your knowledge, as you consolidate its results, when was the last inventory audit at
Philidor or its affiliate pharmacies?


To your knowledge, as you consolidate its results, has a payer ever ceased accepting
prescriptions from Philidor or so threatened? If so, who and when?


Did you investigate Norma Provencio’s co-investment in Recom/Signalife alongside
Mitchell J. Stein before renewing her position on the Audit Committee? If not, why not?


According to online sources, several employees at Philidor Rx Services formerly worked at
Unitek, a Blue Bell, PA, company that was alleged to have experienced a fraud. Before
they were hired, did you determine that these employees were not in any way involved in
the alleged fraud? Are these employees involved in any accounting function at Philidor? 


You failed to inform shareholders of the nature or purpose of KGA Fulfillment Services
Inc., the entity that holds secured interests over the owners of Philidor. There are a few
other such entities about which you have mentioned little. For instance, you registered
many Delaware entities, some on roughly the same day in 2012, by the names of Audrey
Enterprise LLC, Emma Z LP, Erin S LP, Katie Z LP, Kika LP, Stephanie LP, and Tori LP.


For what purpose were these entities established?


What is the nature of these partnerships and what assets do they hold?


Who besides Valeant has or may potentially receive an economic benefit from
these entities? Is Valeant the sole member or limited partner?


Prior to the lawsuit in California Central District Court, had you or your employees had any
direct communication with officers or employees of R&O Pharmacy?


Why did Robert Chai-Onn identify $69 million at R&O as owed to Valeant? Is any money
owed to Valeant by R&O additional to monies owed to Philidor - or is Philidor just an arm
of Valeant. 


Have you or any of your employees had direct communication with officers or employees
of Brighton Way Pharmacy (d/b/a West Wilshire Pharmacy), Safe Rx Pharmacy, or RAAS
Pharmacy (d/b/a Orbit Pharmacy)? If so, when and on what topic?


Are the payers Philidor invoices for prescriptions filled aware that Valeant has the option to
acquire an equity stake in Philidor? Are they aware that, as you stated, you bear the
reimbursement risk on prescriptions filled by Philidor and presumably by these related
pharmacies. 


Several of your competitors have indicated that they have arms-length relationships with
their specialty pharmacy channel, and that they do not own any equity or equity-like stake
in such pharmacies. Yet you own an option to acquire Philidor, and when I called them, a
Philidor representative said they deal almost entirely in Valeant products. Why do you
believe your competitors not chosen to replicate your arrangements with Philidor (and its

affiliates) with their own semi-captive specialty pharmacies?


Philidor was incorporated in early 2013. When did your relationship (of any type) with
Philidor begin? What was the first quarter in which Philidor was consolidated into your
financial statements? Since that time:


Has your accounting treatment of Philidor on your own financial statements
changed? If so, how and when? If not, do you believe the acquisition of an
option to acquire the equity of Philidor require a restatement of any prior year’s
filing before the Securities and Exchange Commission? Why or why not?


By quarter, what was the total amount of your revenue (gross and net) for
products that have been dispensed by Philidor?

Were any Valeant or Medicis employees or agents, current or former, whether full or part-
time, involved in launching Philidor?


How many days worth of R&O's revenue does the $69M you sought to recover represent?
How many square feet is R&O pharmacy? How does a small pharmacy generate that
substantial an amount of business?


If Philidor holds an option to acquire R&O or other pharmacies, are those pharmacies'
results consolidated on your financial statements as well?


Are Philidor owners, executives, or employees eligible to receive any form of monetary
incentive from Valeant?  Have any such incentives been delivered? If so, in what
amounts? What are the criteria for receiving such compensation? Have such amounts
been disclosed to the Board?


Mr. Pearson, have you ever met with or communicated with Philidor executives or
employees? If so, how often? For what purpose?


In addition to Robert Chai-Onn, which other members of your executive team were aware
of the Valeant's relationship with Philidor, R&O, and its other possibly-affiliated
pharmacies, such as West Wilshire, Safe Rx, and Orbit Pharmacy?


Which executive at Valeant has responsibility for the relationship with Philidor? Which
executive has oversight and profit-and-loss responsibility for Philidor's operations?


What direction have you given your employees, contractors or agents with regard to
discussions of the existence of Philidor and its relationship with Valeant, if any?


Why did you decide to purchase an option to acquire Philidor? What did you pay for that
option? When did you purchase it, and when does the option expire?


Before the most recent disclosures, was the Board of Directors aware of your commercial
and financial relationship with Philidor, its owners, and its affiliate pharmacies? Were these
relationships discussed by and/or approved by the Board of Directors, the Audit
Committee, and your external auditors?


Did the Board of Directors approve the acquisition of an option to acquire Philidor?  If so,
when?  What due diligence did you perform on Philidor, and what was the investment case
presented to the Board?


Are the insurance companies whom you/Philidor invoice, and from whom you bear
reimbursement risk, aware that patients have been offered co-pay coupons, waivers,
and/or charity assistance for the co-pay portion of the claims submitted?


Regarding your auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP:


Are they aware of your relationship with Philidor? What information did you
provide to them about this relationship? When?


To your knowledge, have they audited Philidor, its operations, or its financial
controls?

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 8/27


To your knowledge, did they inspect Philidor to determine whether it maintains
effective internal controls?


Were there any disagreements with PWC over how your relationship with
Philidor should be disclosed in your filings before the Securities and Exchange
Commission?


What portion of the operations of Philidor and its affiliates were included in the
audit scope on which you and PWC agreed for your 2014 Annual Report?


What evidence did you provide to your auditors to convince them that Philidor
Rx Services constitutes a variable interest entity that meets the tests for
consolidation on your financial statements?


Did you have any discussions with your auditor regarding the need, if any, to
disclose your relationship with Philidor and its affiliates?


Which products were fulfilled through Philidor (and its possible affiliates), and what has
been the rate of growth in prescription volume and revenue for those products?


You have stated that Valeant takes reimbursement risk for products fulfilled by Philidor.
Does this extend to Philidor's affiliates as well? So if an insurance company in California
declines to cover a prescription shipped by R&O or West Wilshire, who is out the money
for that prescription?


Have you established a reserve for prescriptions dispensed by Philidor for which the payer
refuses to pay? If so, what is the present level of that reserve and how has it changed over
time?


Is the inventory held at R&O and West Wilshire (and other Philidor affiliates) consolidated
on your balance sheet?


Why did you purchase an "option to acquire" Philidor rather than the equity itself? At any
point in your internal discussions of such a transaction did anyone, whether an employee
or agent of Valeant or Philidor, indicate that pursuing a transaction in this form would
perhaps avoid the need to file updated pharmacy registration forms in any state in which
Philidor or its affiliates operate?


How many of your former employees, contractors or agents work at Philidor? What are
their names and titles and what is the nature of their responsibilities?


What was Valeant's role in establishing Philidor or its affiliates, if any?


As suggested online by Probes Reporter:


What communications, if any, has Valeant had with the SEC’s Division of
Enforcement, the US Attorney/DOJ, or Canadian regulators, regarding any
matter, in the past 30 days?


If such communications exist, what was the purpose and date of those
communications?


Last week the company said it received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the District of Massachusetts and a subpoena from the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Who they were sent to?


Have you received any as-yet undisclosed subpoenas, requests for documents, or notices
of the commencement of investigations by any other government entity since your prior
disclosure?


 
Some Questions for Philidor Rx Services LLC

products to states such as California, where you are not licensed?


What advice did you obtain, and from whom, that you could legally fill prescriptions and

insurance companies on your claims?


What portion of your prescription volume and revenue is for products sold by Valeant and

for the past three years?

interest or exercises operational control received an audit from a PCAOB-registered

or its subsidiaries, current or former?


Did Valeant’s auditors, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, conduct an audit of your operations

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 11/27


Why did you send invoices, as filed with the court, from Philidor to purchase
products from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, to the attention of the R&O Pharmacy
finance department?


Why did your employee send emails suggesting to Russell Reitz


Why did you use and then discontinue the use of, as the email from your CEO
Andrew Davenport filed with the LA County court by R&O Pharmacy indicates,
the various identifiers (NPI, NCPDP, NABP) assigned to R&O Pharmacy?


As you are licensed in many states, why did you desire to use such identifiers
assigned to R&O Pharmacy?


As the acquisition agreement filed with the LA County Court indicates that such
identifiers were to be assigned to Isolani LLC as part of the purchase of R&O,
how did Philidor Rx Services obtain the right to use such identifiers itself?


To your knowledge, have any of your employees—including licensed
pharmacists or pharmacy technicians—resigned due to reservations about the
conduct they observed and/or in which they were asked to participate? What
did you do, if anything, to learn of those concerns and/or ameliorate those of
which you were informed?


What information did Russell Reitz provide you that made you agree to stop
using identifiers such as NPI#, NCPDP# or NABP# belonging to R&O
Pharmacy?


Are you aware that this document - that you filed in State Court in California contains a
putative list of products distributed by R&O but in fact fulfilled by you. Moreover are you
aware that the identification numbers in that document correspond to UPS tracking
numbers and hence you have provided evidence that product was shipped to areas where
you or R&O were not licensed?


Are you aware that changing the pharmacist identification number for the purpose of
deceiving the payer is wire fraud against a financial institution? Are you aware that the fine
is $1 million per instance and the instances are cumulative?


What is the nature of your relationship (commercial, legal, financial, operating) with Isolani
LLC? What services does Philidor provide, if any, to Isolani LLC?


Is Eric Rice an employee or has Eric Rice ever been an employee, contractor or agent of
Philidor or its affiliates? If so, what are/were his responsibilities? What are/were his dates
of employment, title, and assigned office location?


What is the nature of your relationship (commercial, legal, financial, operating) with
Lucena Holdings LLC? Are its operations reported on Philidor’s financial statements?
How?


What is the nature of your relationship (commercial, legal, financial, operating) with
Brighton Way Pharmacy (d/b/a West Wilshire Pharmacy) now and over the past three
years? Why was such a relationship formed? What was the genesis of such a relationship
and what benefits did it provide to you? Are Bright Way Pharmacy’s operations reported
on Philidor’s financial statements? How?


What is the breakdown of prescriptions filled by Philidor (and its affiliates) by dispensing
code? Where no DAW code has been supplied, do pharmacists in your employ (whether
full or part-time) offer a generic alternative to the patient when available?


Does Philidor report data on the prescriptions it fills to IMS Health or other third-party
supply chain reporting services?


What reports does Philidor provide to Valeant management and on what schedule?


Why are all the entities related to Philidor (BQ6, Isolini, Lucena, Philidor itself, KGA)
named for chess moves?


What other pharmacy relationships does Philidor have that have not yet been disclosed?
What is the nature of those relationships?


Why did a member of Philidor, Fabien Forrester-Charles, register a second domain name
for R&O Pharmacy? Similarly, why were domain names created for West Wilshire
Pharmacy, Orbit Pharmacy, Safe Rx Pharmacy, and dandapharmacy.com?


What exactly is your relationship with West Wilshire Pharmacy today and over time?


Why is Sherri Leon, a pharmacist you employ, listed as the Registered Agent in CA state
filings for Brighton Way Pharmacy, the legal name of West Wilshire Pharmacy?

Some Questions for Eric Rice, Sole Member of Isolani LLC


Is Philidor Rx Services LLC your full-time employer, as indicated on your LinkedIn profile?
If not, who is?


Did you form Isolani LLC of your own volition, or were you directed to do so by another
party? If so, whom? If not, why did you personally decide to acquire a pharmacy in
California?


By name and amount, who has ownership of, or the right to acquire ownership of, an
economic interest in Isolani LLC?


How many employees does Isolani LLC have and what are their names, titles, and dates
of employment? Are any of them now, or have any of them been, employees of Philidor Rx
Services LLC or Valeant Pharmaceuticals (and its subsidiaries, current or former)?


Were you the sole provider of initial start-up capital for Isolani LLC? If not, what other
person or entity provided capital? Were Philidor, Valeant, or their subsidiaries (current or
former), or employees (current or former) among those who provided capital?


Did you personally provide the $350,000 to purchase R&O Pharmacy from Russell Reitz,
as outlined in the purchase agreement you filed with the court in your lawsuit against
R&O? If not, who did? Did Philidor, Valeant, their subsidiaries, or their employees provide
any capital to you personally or to Isolani LLC to facilitate this purchase?


As Isolani LLC is entitled to all of the profits and losses of the operations of R&O
Pharmacy according to the purchase agreement you filed with the Court, do you
personally receive such profits and bear such losses?  If not, who does? Are any of the
persons who are entitled to receive such profits or bear such losses current or former
employees or entities currently or formerly associated with Philidor Rx Services LLC or
Valeant Pharmaceuticals in any respect?


Have you signed any agreement governing the operations of Isolani LLC or the
assignment of its profits and losses to any other entity, including Philidor Rx Services LLC,
Valeant Pharmaceuticals, their subsidiaries (current or former), or their employees (current
or former)?


Who is providing the funds to pay attorneys and other expenses in your lawsuit against
R&O Pharmacy in California? Are any of these funds provided by Philidor Rx Services
LLC, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, their subsidiaries, or their employees?


Why was Isolani LLC formed to purchase a 90% stake in R&O Pharmacy rather than
having Philidor Rx Services LLC or Valeant (or its subsidiaries) purchase it directly?


Why did you request, as part of the purchase agreement you filed with the LA County
Court in your lawsuit against R&O Pharmacy, that Russell Reitz transfer, at your request,
his NABP/NCPDP and NPI numbers into Isolani LLC’s name? In using such identifiers, do
you believe that Isolani LLC, itself not a registered pharmacy in any state or with the
federal government, be in compliance with pharmacy registration requirements?


Are you based in Pennsylvania, from whence you direct the operations of Isolani LLC? If
so, why are you not registered as a foreign corporation in Pennsylvania?


Why, according to emails filed with the court, did a controller for Philidor Rx Services LLC
undertake to assist R&O Pharmacy with its compliance audits by a payer customer, when
the 90% owner of R&O is Isolani LLC?


Philidor Rx Services indicated in a press release that they own an option to acquire R&O
Pharmacy, of which Isolani LLC owns 90%. What are the terms of this option? When did
Philidor acquire this option and for what compensation? Did you receive any proceeds
from this sale personally? If not, as you were the sole member of Isolani LLC, why not?

Have any employees, contractors or agents of Valeant or its subsidiaries, current or
former, been physically present on your premises in Los Angeles? For what purpose?

manufactured or marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals or its subsidiaries, current or
former?


 
A Question for Fabien Forrester-Charles
 


You know it's always the guy named “Fab” who gets blamed for the whole mess, right?

This is smart, well done. By presenting an exhaustive list of great questions, Valeant's
inevitably shallow comments tomorrow will look even more evasive and should cast even
more doubt on the company's future. I have little doubt that Pearson will focus on nothing
more than straw man arguments and further reiterations of what the company has already
said twice now, both during the third quarter call and separate press release a few days
later. Considering Valeant's ham-handed responses to date, I think there's a good
possibility that tomorrow's call ends up being memorably disastrous. Merely having the
call at all I think will prove to be a huge tactical error (much to my delight as someone
who is short) since it opens the door to these questions. Very generous of Valeant to
provide shorts with catalysts!

Hi John, This is the most comprehensive, most exhaustive list of questions to be aired at
Valeant. I would be very surprised if VRX / Pearson attempts to answer most of this. The
BOD, Pearson and team have had 4 days to be fully trained. Some key questions for me
is related to the charities:

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 14/27


1) To which charities does VRX contribute towards'patient assistance programs? 
2) Can Mr.Pearson/ Audit Committee/CFO confirm that VRX is NOT the sole contributory
to any of these charities?  
3) How does this contribution gets accounted in Cash EPS? (I know it may be shown as
SG&A in GAAP books. However, the investors rely on Cash EPS more than GAAP EPS
and hence my question is whether this is part of Cash EPS 
4) Can we assume that the Charities only support Patient Assistance programs with the
contributions provided? Do they contribute to industry associations, etc and is that also
'counted' as Patient Assistance program?

Hi John, This is the most comprehensive, most exhaustive list of questions to be aired at
Valeant. I would be very surprised if VRX / Pearson attempts to answer most of this. The
BOD, Pearson and team have had 4 days to be fully trained. Some key questions for me
is related to the charities: 
 
1) To which charities does VRX contribute towards'patient assistance programs? 
2) Can Mr.Pearson/ Audit Committee/CFO confirm that VRX is NOT the sole contributory
to any of these charities?  
3) How does this contribution gets accounted in Cash EPS? (I know it may be shown as
SG&A in GAAP books. However, the investors rely on Cash EPS more than GAAP EPS
and hence my question is whether this is part of Cash EPS 
4) Can we assume that the Charities only support Patient Assistance programs with the
contributions provided? Do they contribute to industry associations, etc and is that also
'counted' as Patient Assistance program?

Is Valeant a client of BQ6 as claimed on their website? What level management of
Valeant management maintained the relationship  
 
At any point in that relationship did Valeant suggest creating a specialty pharmacy? 
 
Why did the principals of BQ6 create a specialty pharmacy to solely or almost entirely
serve Valeant if they were not relatively assured of Valeants business? 
 
If as seems likely Valeant encouraged the formation of Philidor, or at the least was
informed of its creation, why did it not ask about licensing? 
 
If Valeant was aware of and perhaps instrumental in the formation of Philidor why did it
elect to buy an option late last year? 
 
Was Valeant aware of the extent of the deception Philidor and related entities used to
hide corporate ownership? What was the point do the subterfuge, particularly since it was
actually all quite sloppy? 
 
Matthew Davenport has a long history in health care, why is Andy Davenport CEO of
Philidor given his lack of experience? 
 
Why did Matthew Davenport lie about who was the owner of Philidor on the CA
application?  
 
Was Valeant unaware of Philidor's relationship with R&O? When Valeant purchased the
option in Philidor did they do any diligence about its licensing status.  
 
How can the auditors attest to financial controls at Valeant when it is billing a material
amount to an entity under the control of an entity it consolidates?

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Valeant and its captive pharmacies: some questions


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 15/27


Question for Bronte Capital: How much faith do you really want to put in the allegations of
Russell Reitz, a guy who appears to be trying to abscond with tens of millions of dollars
that are pretty clearly not his? 
 
This was a nice short from $145-150 and higher levels. Given VRX's gigantic free cash
flow and ownership of businesses like Bausch & Lomb that have little relation to the
speciality pharmacy channel and price increase issues, shorting $115 seems like an
invitation to get your head ripped off on a snapback rally.

longVRX said...


A couple of questions for John Hempton: 
 
(i) If Mike Pearson comes out tomorrow and says the speciality pharmacies adventure
has become a big mess and they have decided to close the whole thing down and go
back to selling only through regular pharmacies, what is the likely impact on Valeant's
total earnings for the next 12 months? By what percentage (roughly) would the forward
earnings be reduced? 
 
(ii) With the reduced forward earnings you get in (i), and the current share price, what is
the discount of VRX's forward P/E relative to the forward P/E's of its peer group? If 'peer
group' is too vague then just take AGN. Discount of more than 50%? 
 
P.S. I enjoyed and appreciate your insightful analysis of the VRX saga...but the full picture
consists of a lot more than just those issues...

Excellent work. 
 
Could I add: 
 
The merger agreement between Isolani and R&O had NO termination date.  
 
The contemporaneous management services agreement (MSA) allowing Isolani to
operate R&O would have terminated Dec 1, 2015. 
 
R&O attempted to enter binding arbitration re: the MSA in July. Isolani then asked Reitz to
resign from R&O as a pre-condition. 
 
R&O then unilaterally terminated the DMA and asserted fraud, with only 90 days to run on
the management agreement. 
 
What seems to have set Reitz (owner of R&O) off was an "IHS audit" and questions from
auditor regarding prescriptions shipped to PA. Identity of acronym not identified. Maybe
Indian Health Services (IHS.gov)? Dunno. 
 
Absent a strong belief in ongoing fraud or personal liability regarding the audit, he took a
very non-economic path (vs. sit tight for 3 months). 
 
I think you're right in focusing on the interstate shipments and licensing.

Throw a thousand darts and see if one sticks? 
 
Every big pharma and corporation has legal issues - thats the nature of business. Even if
your dart was to land on something that might result in some consequence for Valeant it
would be minor. Definitely not as big and scary as it is made out.

This was just posted on Yahoo Message boards for VRX 
My Health Insurance Is Going Up 22% January 1st 
I'm mad. 
 
here is why I think VRX is in serious trouble: 
 
John, I enjoy your blog very much. I happened to see your cryptic message and I think I
know what it is.  
 
I'm no expert on Valeant, but I just so happened to have been prescribed one of their
pharmaceuticals about 6 months ago. It was a foot cream to treat athletes foot called
Luzu. What was strange was that the podiatrist suggested that the prescription be set up
with a "by mail" pharmacy, telling me that they would cover the co-pay for the first
prescription.  
 
I went ahead and had the podiatrist sign me up with Philidor and the prescription was
delivered. A few weeks later, I got a call from Philidor. They offered to cover the co-pay
for all of the remaining refills, which was maybe 3 more refills. What is important is that
this really isn't the type of prescription that would normally require constant refilling. I
probably wouldn't have never ordered these refills if someone else hadn't offered to cover
my cash costs.  
 
I found this to be a pretty aggressive marketing tactic, which certainly could be used to
attempt to stuff sales and bilk insurance companies. I do understand that Philidor was
either created by or strongly associated with Valeant. Less

Hi John, 
 
5:39 am anonymous back. 
 
I've thought about it some more.  
 
If Reitz wanted to renegotiate the DMA in his favor, he had all the cards in his favor for
the renewal of Management Services agreement, which had to be re-negotiated by
12/1/15. 
 
He would have continued to deposit the checks and done nothing unusual for 90 days. 
 
Had he just wanted a better deal, he could have asked for any terms he wanted, with the
credible threat of kicking Isolani out as manager. 
 
In just 90 days. 
 
Instead, he unilaterally terminated the DMA and MSA and stopped depositing checks. 
 
I think he saw illegality. Nothing else is consistent with his course of action.

Great list! Must have taken you the entire weekend to put it together. 
 
I'd add a specific section "Questions to the auditor". 
I cannot really believe that (1) they knew and (2) agreed to all of this. 
 
Then I 'd seperate between "questions to VRX management " and the board

The use of these copay charities seems to be especially nefarious. Somehow this
reminds me of the downpayment assistance programs. Just as much as DAP drove up
housing prices (in the process not helping, but reducing affordability) and in the end
bilked the government (Fannie and Freddie) etc out of billions, these "charities" lead to
the spike in drug cost.

longVRX, 
the shorts are not interested in valuation analisys of a diversified business mix. they are
all about yelling fire over and over again in the hopes of covering lower. This is like the
JPM london whale thing, a one time hit to a company that has no relevance for the long-
term. All the idiots who sold JPM during the london whale made a huge mistake. same
thing here, they will pay whatever fine and move on. stock will recover, but of course, the
shorts won't lose because they all covered in the panic that they created themselves

Anon, 
That might be true in general but our host John H professes a great interest in valuations,
it's one of the main topics in his blogging. But apparently not in this instance... 
 
Good luck to the shorts today. I hope they can succeed to knock the shares down below
$100 so we can buy more at a cheaper price.

longVRX, In your view, what is a reasonable valuation? What multiple do you want to put
on FCF? 
 
4Q run rate FCF is roughly $1.5 bil. 343 mm shs. VRX $116 is roughly 27 x FCF. Right? 
 
 
1) Growth is not going to be what it has been. Is the business model sustainable? 
 
2) Looks fully levered. A/o 6/30/15 . . . $30.8 in debt with $1.9 bil cash interest expense. 
 
Do you want to pay 25 x FCF for a stock that has these problems? Maybe they go away
soon or maybe things get worse? 
 
Cheers,

Hi John, 
a small one. (Was I the only one reading all that word-by-word? :) 
 
Did you solve this by changing the pharmacist identification number to as small
pharmacist that you had purchased for the person of diversifying the distributing
pharmacy. 
 
----> for the PURPOSE, most likely. 
 
very understandable slip for such a big and demanding endeavor.

Quoting an un-named buy-sider: 
'These allegations appear to be a coordinated and cynical media attack abetted by David
Pyott, the bitter ex-CEO of Allergan, who lost his job as a result of Valeant’s efforts to buy
Allergan last year.'

TOday's call was interesting. it did not answer the intense questions, but Valeant thought
it would get away with another investor type presentation. Granted, they revealed more
than ever about Philidor, but was well scripted. Appeared to disclose. Secondly, the BOD
Committee is a joke. Why would the Lead Independent Director who issued a statement
in admirable terms about Mr.Pearson, be expected to unearth anything and report?  
 
I was always wondering about how Philidor is funded especially given the high working
capital needs (delays in reimbursement coupled with bi weekly payment terms to
Valeant). The unusual option to buy / milestone payments from Valeant to Philidor are a
way to fund the working capital needs of Philidor.  
 
Saga will never end with more to come I think.

Anon (Oct 26, 10:20pm), 
 
FCF is important but again not the full picture. For an acquisitive company like VRX I
would expect high leverage and FCF multiple. The more interesting question for me is
how well they are able to use that leverage. For this we can look, e.g., at ROE. For VRX it
is ~30% for the year ending June 30 2015 and has been in a strong up-trend for the last 2
years (data from wikinvest). We can compare this with a couple of other large acquisitive
pharma companies, TEVA and AGN. TEVA’s ROE for the same period is ~11% and with a
much weaker up-trend. AGN’s ROE was flat around ~20% for most of the last 2 years (it’s
currently negative, presumably as a consequence of its old self Actavis purchasing its
new self). So VRX is doing very well and significantly better than its peers by this
measure. 
 
Since you mentioned the large interest payments VRX has to make on its debt, let’s look
at EV/EBITDA which takes this into account. For VRX it is 6.1 for the year ending Sept 30
2015. For TEVA and AGN it is 14.7 and 16.0 respectively. So VRX is ridiculously cheap,
not only compared to its peers but in general. How many other companies do you know
with ROE ~ 30% and EV/EBITDA ~6 ? Maybe you can find some but I bet they are all low
quality low margin businesses. (VRX has operating margin ~20%.) 
 
The only way VRX’s current share price can be justified is if it has suddenly become a
“broken company”. The bears claim that it has, so let’s examine their thesis. They claim
that the business model is unsustainable because the growth relies (i) on jacking up
prices and (ii) continual acquisitions which they won’t be able to continue at the same
level in future. Let’s consider both of these in turn. 
 
Re (i): At the latest earnings call VRX said they will limit price increases to 10% for the
next year, and yet they were able to not only maintain the forward full year guidance but
in fact raise it. Explain that one, bears. The reality is that the contribution to revenue
growth from price increases is relatively small. E.g. a large part of their business is
outside USA where the possibility for price increases is limited, nevertheless that part of
the business is doing very well. 
 
Re (ii): With their large and increasing revenue growth they will have no problem
continuing to make acquisitions at the same pace if they want to. Or has something
changed which makes acquisitions harder for them now than it was 3, 2 or 1 year ago?
Bears, tell us what this big change is. One thing that could hurt them is if long-term
interest rates rise significantly. But all the indications are that they will remain low for the
foreseeable future, regardless of what the Fed does with short-term rates. Salix was a
huge purchase for them and they have sensibly decided to pay down some of the debt
from that over the coming year, but otherwise it will be business as usual.

But all this is irrelevant for understanding what has happened with the VRX share price in

completely different. I'll elaborate on this in a follow-up comment below

completely different. I'll elaborate on this in a follow-up comment

But all this is irrelevant for understanding what has happened with the VRX share price in
the last month. There’s the “official reason” for the sell-off, and the real reason which is
completely different. The official reason consists of two parts, (a) the bear thesis above,
and (b) the unsettling revelations that have come to light via Citron, Bronte and others.
Both parts are fake though as reasons/explanations for the sell-off. Part (a) is fake
because if it was real it would have applied just as much 3, 2 and 1 year ago when the
share price was steadily increasing. Part (b) is fake because the overall impact on the
business is limited. (Might be enough to justify a 10-15% share price decline, but no more
than that.)

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/valeant-and-its-captive-pharmacies-some.html 20/27


 
The real reason, which I’m sure John Hempton and everyone else in the finance industry
knows even though they keep quiet about it, is this: After the recent market sell-off many
hedge funds are vulnerable - they’ve suffered big losses and are getting hit with
redemptions. Among the vulnerable HFs there are many that hold large positions in VRX.
The sharks smell (or taste I guess) blood and we know what happens – they go all out to
short the companies in which the vulnerable HFs have large positions in the hope of
crushing them and profiting from their demise. That’s how the game is played.  
 
Of course, the sharks like to have an “official reason” for the shorting when they are
playing this game. A tweet from Hillary, a rant from Uncle Carl about junk bonds, an over-
the-top note from a nobody short seller, and article in the NYT/WSJ,…it’s all good.
Whatever the environment provides them with. And if the environment is uncooperative
they just manufacture reasons themselves (example below). 
 
If any naïve soul (or, more likely, a pretending to be naïve soul) wants to dispute the
above, just look at what has happened to the share prices of other HF darlings. A couple
of examples just to illustrate: Biomarin and Palo Alto Networks. BMRN was trading at
around $150 and had a fine Q3 earnings report, no problems, everything looking good.
Now it trades at around $100. All because of a tweet from Hillary? Come on, give me a
break. Its fundamentals and situation going forward are completely unchanged. Let’s not
pretend we don’t know the real reason for why its share price was knocked down by a
third. 
 
PANW is an even more interesting case. In this case the environment was highly
uncooperative to the sharks: before the Q3 earnings there were stories in the financial
media that PANW was rapidly increasing market share and being viewed increasingly
favourably by cyber security customers. So the sharks had to manufacture a reason for
knocking it down. They did this by circulating rumours (“whispers”) that its growth had
peaked, and proceeded to whack down the shares. The bogus nature of their “official
reason” was soon revealed though when PANW reported a spectacular Q3 with a
massive beat and raise in guidance and told how their market share was growing
increasingly strongly just like the media articles had suggested. The share price jumped
and the sharks were temporarily squeezed. What happened next? The sharks went right
back to their manifestly bogus “growth has peaked” whisperings and proceeded to knock
the shares down even further than before… 
 
Where does it end for VRX? Well, the shares will keep selling off until the crushable HFs
with large positions in it have been crushed, or until the valuation becomes so cheap that
the big boys can’t resist jumping in. After that happens the share price will steadily rise
back to where it was and continue upwards until the next shark fest. I’m looking forward
to making a 100+% profit on my position after a couple of years, and hopefully a larger
gain if the shorts can knock the price down to below my previous entry level so I can buy
more :).

and this changes everything. 
 
I find it surprising that Sequoia reportedly has 29% of its holdings in just one stock, which
is VRX and now two members of the board have questioned it and resigned. 
 
Good luck with your long. I personally would not touch it.


October 30, 2015 at 2:29 PM


longVRX said...


Retired, 
 
This development was to be expected after the recent revelations. But it’s not a big deal
in the general scheme of things. 
 
Let’s try to quantify the impact in the worst case where Valeant simply loses Philidor (and
its network of specialty pharmacies) and goes back to selling through the regular
pharmacies only. Revenue from the specialty pharmacies network is ~7% of Valeant’s
total Q3 revenue and EBITDA. If this network is removed, a significant fraction of that
revenue will survive but will flow through the regular pharmacies instead (since doctors
will refer patients to the regular pharmacies instead of Philidor). At worst they might lose
half of it.  
 
With the current share price of $111.50 and forward p/e of 5.0 (from Morningstar), the
forward eps is $22.30. So if the forward eps gets reduced by 4% (an extreme worst case
estimate), it becomes $21.41 and the forward p/e becomes 5.2 – a marginal difference
and still ridiculously cheap for a high quality high margin company like Valeant.  
 
I find it hilarious that this latest development caused the share price to tank more than
10% (yesterday’s trading and today’s premarket). Obviously nothing to do with
fundamentals; just shows that the sharks haven’t finished trying to crush the vulnerable
hedge funds with large positions in VRX.

Regarding Valeant’s free cash flow (FCF), which was brought up as a concern by a
previous commenter: The Sequoia folks mentioned this in a letter yesterday. They wrote 
 
“In 2016, we believe Valeant should grow earnings by at least 30%, generate free cash
flow in excess of $4 billion and have the liquidity to pay down some of its bonds before
their scheduled maturities. At a recent price of $110, Valeant trades for about seven times
the consensus estimate of 2016 cash earnings, which does not strike us as a rational
price for a company with a diverse collection of product lines and strong earnings growth.”

In the least, VRX has badly damaged credibility and that is not easy to restore. Relying on
quantitative assumptions doesn't seem to work very well if the underlying assumptions
are shaky or unknown. The revenue growth pattern has been altered clearly, but we don't
know how much. With the publicity problem, it appears that doing more acquisitions will
be difficult until the air clears. VRX has a lot of debt too. Not much I can see that is very
positive at this time.

There appears to have been pervasive and systematic fraud at VRX, with both criminal

There does not appear to be massive accounting fraud as the amounts where treatment
was aggressive were relatively small. 
 
Who would want to do business with a company who regularly cheats them? That is the

hit the entire US drug portfolio. 
 
Add to this the various investigations from numerous federal enforcement agencies
(including the DOJ), Congress, and a growing list of states, you are looking at a multi-
billion dollar litigation exposure, plus legal costs. Valeant will be lucky to escape as a
going concern. 
 
And this is a company whose inception to date losses are $3.85 BILLION according to the

TO John Watson. You nailed it. Better said than I could. My feeling is that the PBM's have
been reading the stories and are very upset with pharma companies that work around
their protocols to get more expensive drugs approved. This is just not Valeant. PBM's
have probably been suspicious all along but didn't have enough of a solid trail to deny
Valeant's approvals through Philador. 
 
Even though Valeant now has cut the ties to Philador, we don't know how many other
specialty pharmacy operations exist that are similar. I would guess that when any request
for a Valeant drug comes into a PBM, the alarms are going to go off. 
 
The real question here is how many unique prescription drugs does Valeant offer that
have no lower cost substitutes. I have no idea. Maybe LongVRX knows. The math needs
to be redone with a new assumption that the high priced drugs which can be substituted
are going to be cut back severely and what stock price is then justified. The debt issue is
a different problem, but could be solved I suppose with the aid of the big money equity
investors.

longVRX said...


“So the PBMs are going to want to remove Valeant drugs from their formularies wherever
possible.” 
 
No they won’t because they make lots of money from selling them and there are no legal
issues with it. 
 
Valeant has a fine record of operating within the law since Mike Pearson became CEO in
2008 – no fines or convictions during that time as far as I’m aware. This is in stark
contrast to the rest of the pharma industry where criminality is the norm. Bill Ackman had
a slide in his presentation yesterday showing the 10 largest pharma company fines
between ’91—’12 and the striking thing for me was the number of repeat offenders on the
list. Criminality is apparently in their genes. As Ackman pointed out, Valeant has been
able to maintain an operating margin twice as large as the other pharmas without
resorting to criminality like they do. 
 
All this talk about how Valeant’s business model is supposedly broken gives me
flashbacks to the vilification of Amazon back in 2014 when its shares sold off from 400 to
300. Now it trades at 600+. Like VRX the business model of AMZN was perceived as
being very successful for many years until suddenly the market sentiment flipped 180
degrees… And just as now, those claiming AMZN’s model was broken did not feel a need
to back it up with specific concrete rational arguments, it was enough just to state it as a
self-evident fact.  
 
Probably we should agree to disagree at this point. Let’s revisit this in one years time and
see who was right.

I have just one very simply question: 
 
How can VRX be undervalued with a TTM PE Ratio of 60+ selling mainly generics (I
checked their products list) when Gilead is presumably fairly valued TTM PE Ratio of 11+
selling what is currently BEST IN CLASS patented HEP C drugs. In making the above
statement, I'm completely discounting GILD's on going revenue from HIV drugs because
they are coming off patent and I assuming that it will earn ZERO revenue once it does so
- a very conservative assumption.

longVRX said...


Retired, my thinking was that since CVS earns money each time it dispenses a Valeant
drug it will not want to cut them. I'm assuming CVS has control or at least some influence
over its own PBM. But maybe that's wrong. (I'm not so familiar with the US healthcare
system and probably should research it more as you suggested.) 
 
But in any case, from the reading I've done it seems clear that the change in the
fundamentals of Valeant's business overall is relatively small and way out of proportion
with the huge selloff in the stock. Market overreaction to adverse developments in a
previously hot stock is nothing new... Probably best to wait until the sharks have finished
doing their thing before buying more though.

TO longVRX 
 
Read Charlie Mungers comments published Nov 1 about Valeant on Bloomberg News. 
 
Munger went out of his way to say that Valeant has created a "phony growth record". He
is Buffett's partner and usually does not go out of his way to bash other companies. He
also is very rich and if Valeant sues for defamation, I am sure Munger will back up his
claims and have plenty of lawyers. He isn't shorting it but just warning his friends who are
hedge fund managers to stay away from Valeant. 
 
As far as I can tell, your quantitative approach to valuing this company is highly irrelevant
if the underlying assumptions in your valuation model don't hold up. 
 
I advise that you do some quick learning about how PBM's operate in the USA. PBM's,
depending on the contract they have signed with employers who sponsor health
insurance plans, can lose a lot of money on Valeant's tactics to skirt their protocols. 
 
Most of Valeants revenues in the USA, probably are channeled through one of the PBM's.
The only exceptions to this would be for patients who do not carry any drug insurance
coverage.  
 
What would your models say the stock is worth if I told you and Valeant revenues could
be down 40% next year and about 20% more in 2017? It might be better or worse, than
these estimates, but the whole revenue picture looks bad to me. The credit rating
agencies seem to be saying the same thing

I've already read the comments from Charlie Munger. Much as I respect his investment

the Valeant camp too, most notably ValueAct with two members on the Valeant board.
They could easily have sold out with a huge profit if they wanted to.

Despite the existence of Philidor the majority of the Jublia and other dermatology drug
sales were still via the regular pharmacies such as CVS. Doctors were prescribing them,
patients were paying the copays, and the PBMs were approving them for payment. I
doubt very much that this is all suddenly going to change now. Common sense alone tells
me that, even without detailed knowledge of the system.  
 
No offense, but scary sounding opinions that everything is about to dramatically change
remind me of the things people were saying about Amazon when its stock was selling off
in 2014 (and countless other similar cases). I tune it out as noise, unless I see a specific
concrete rational argument that convinces. Opinions and conjecture alone are not
enough. 
 
Enough of this for now. I will be back here on 2nd November 2016, then we can discuss
who was right.

@Unknown, 
 
The trailing p/e is not so interesting; the forward p/e is what matters most since investing
is basically about trying to front run the future growth of companies.  
 
The forward p/es of VRX and GILD are currently 4.2 and 8.5 respectively (from
Morningstar). VRX is ridiculously cheap by this valuation; it can only be justified if it has
suddenly become a "broken company". GILD is also cheap, this is probably because the
market currently does not have a high opinion of its future growth prospects.  
 
The earnings growth of VRX is reflected in the large difference between its trailing and
forward p/es. And the small difference between these quantities for GILD reflects low
earnings growth.

long VRX 
 
You are confusing two different types of pharmaceutical transactions. CVS does operate
a large drug store chain in the USA. If those stand alone pharmacies fill Valeant
prescriptions, then that CVS store collects some level of revenue, probably a capitated
amount. You are correct, this hasn't changed if there is no insurance involved. 
 
In the majority of cases, CVS stores (or Walgreens or others), however, fill a prescription
that is paid for through a PBM, which may be Express Scripts, Optum, the
CVS/Caremark, Prime, Humana, MedImpact etc. It is impossible to know about the future
revenue potential of Valeant, unless you are very famiiiar with the formularies and policies
of these PBM's with specific Valeant drugs.  
 
This is a very critical part driving your quantitative assumptions, whether you know it or
not. 
 
As far as the speculation about vastly lower revenues, you are right in that nobody knows
for sure. In terms of risk modeling, however, you are making a major mistake if you don't
consider both possibilities of a downside as well as an upside.  
 
My point here is to look at some scenarios with much lower revenue assumptions, then
regularly assign a probability to them as new facts emerge. Then consider if the downside
risk here is small or really large. 
 
My personal belief is the downside is considerable and much more likely than the upside,
which seems to be very limited at this point in time.

@ Retired For Now - I work at a place which uses a Caremark PBM. I can look up actual
cost for any prescription, both patient portion and PBM portion. The missing part of the
data is the approximately 25% of the PBM portion which is rebated to my employer's
plan. It varies by drug. For my own medicine, I generally pay full freight just with the
patient portion. This gripes me a lot since I want that additional 25% discount in my
pocket, not the overall health plan. 
 
Most Valeant drugs that I've looked up, at least on the dermatological front, are
uncovered by my plan due to being outside of the formulary -- if I want brand name $1000
acne cream, I can pay out of pocket. Most Salix drugs are still covered, but they haven't
had the massive price gouging yet, or scrutiny. 
 
Comparing notes together in a room between the PBMs would be an antitrust violation.
Looking up each others formularies online would not. You can be sure these competitors
check each other's lists. 
 
I think Valeant is about to encounter a world of pain with regard to formularies, Even in
the rare cases where prices haven't been jacked up 2000%, PBMs will want to remove
this bad actor except for the rare case where R&D has resulted in a unique and effective
medicine. Too bad Valeant doesn't do R&D for unique medicines and instead just
copycats for the most part. 
 
When I look at the VRX portfolio, only Bausch & Lomb along with Salix offer products
where a PBM cannot just tell Valeant to take their prices for a long walk down a short pier.
And even with these medications, alternatives are available, so the PBMs can say take it
or leave it. 
 
Take it or leave it will be an important PBM formulary concern this open enrollment
period. I expect most Valeant medications to move into the highest copay tier. Generics
work just as well for most, and really lousy products like Jublia are bested by $200 laser
treatments or existing generics.

sophisticated hedge fund managers and it now turns out that it is a business nobody can
claim to fully understand. From a pure risk point of view here, anyone who devotes 20%
or more of a portfolio to one security sure as hell ought to know what they bought. Many
of these ownership positions are so large, it appears the funds could be trapped as it
would require finding another large buyer. 
 
From my experience this Valeant investment structure seems pretty odd because much of
the company is owned by perhaps a dozen or less entities. The other owners seem to be
Canadian managers who were forced to buy Valeant because it was the largest
capitalization on the Toronto Stock exchange and if they hedged or were an index fund

they also got trapped. 
 
All in all, these seem to be pretty strange circumstances because I don't recall such
concentration of ownership of publicly traded company that is now shaken. Shares were
down 15% this morning. Ouch.

CEO Pearson sold a block of 880,000 shares at a price slightly below $77 on 11/5
according to SEC filing. Apparently this was done by Goldman as a margin call as
reported in the news. Considering he is a key player and must have had no alternative to
take a fire sale price, this is a bit disturbing to hear. It's really strange they could not have
come up with some type of alternate solution to the problem and may indicate how much
out on a limb that Pearson is willing to go on business deals. 
 
Looking at Valeant financials, I find them to probably be beyond the ability of many
professionals and investment managers to comprehend. This is a company that I think
requires many hours of study to understand the 10K. It is much more complicated than
95% of all public companies. I would bet that most funds that own Valeant also find that it
takes much more time than average to follow. 
 
I wonder how much patience the fund managers really had to study this operation before
they bought in? 
 
On a rough basis, Valeant has around $30 bil. in assets and two-thirds of that is intangible
or goodwill. On the liability side it has about $30 bil in debt. This is fine if the drug
products and companies they bought are really going to generate a substantial amount of
future cash flow for many years. 
 
How certain can anyone be about a future revenue stream even from drugs which may
not have competition now?? They will need a lot of cash flow just to pay the $1 bil per
year interest expense and refund the debt. 
 
My guess is that just a handful of people on earth probably actually fully understand or
appreciate Valeant's complexity and what it's cash flow generating power truly is. And
they probably are not employed outside of the company HQ. (It might just be one or two
persons that are key.) 
 
I am not sure how a solid valuation and risk assessment are possible without
comprehending the nuts and bolts of each revenue stream for a diverse collection of
drugs sold in many markets outside of North America. The stock probably ought to trade
at a big discount just because it is so complex---in my view.

NY Times writer Jim Stewart looked into Sequoia's large investment in Valeant. 
 
He pointed out that Sequoia calls itself a "value fund" and somehow it invested a
whopping 32% of the fund in just one stock---Valeant, which had a PE ratio on the moon.
And then when independent directors attempted to get the management of the fund from
taking on more risk for just one security, fund managers defied them and bought even
more. 
 
I wonder what Sequoia thinks about the 500,000 shares that Pearson was awarded "in
error" and then returned the shares later to the company to fix the error, but Pearson
apparently retained a $28 million profit according to SIRF. 
 
Ackman defends his enormous disproportionate investment in Valeant as well. He must
have believed the story that Valeant was making it easier for physicians to get expensive
drugs to their patients and someone else would work out the insurance details. Valeant
would continue to make gobs of money on a model that was sucking money out of the
PBM's and just passing on the high cost to all enrollees of a drug plan. The model was
basically like a magic trick, from what I am learning now. 
 
What planet are they living on????? 
 
Taking huge bets on stuff they really didn't understand as well as they should have. Or
has this become delusionary for these big investors. Perhaps they should check into a
hospital. As the disclosures about Valeant roll out, their past judgement is called into
