iQIYI: The Netflix of China? Good Luckin 


Introduction 


Our research shows us that iQIYI, Inc. (“IQ”) was committing fraud well before its IPO in 2018 


and has continued to do so ever since. Like so many other China-based companies who IPO with 


inflated numbers, IQ is unable to legitimately grow their business enough to true up their 


financial statements.  We estimate IQ inflated its 2019 revenue by approximately RMB 8-13 


billion, or 27%-44%. 


IQ does this by overstating its user numbers by approximately 42%-60%. Then, IQ inflates its 


expenses, the prices it pays for content, other assets and acquisitions in order to burn off fake 


cash to hide the fraud from its auditor and investors.  


We conducted in person surveys of 1,563 people within IQ’s target demographic in China during 


October and November 2019 and found that approximately 31.9% of IQ users have access to its 


VIP-only content through their memberships with IQ’s partners such as JD.com or Xiaomi TV.  


IQ accounts for dual memberships on a gross basis, meaning it records the full amount of 


revenue and records its partners’ share as expenses. This allows IQ to inflate its revenues and 


burn off fake cash at the same time. 


We also obtained Chinese credit reports for all of IQ’s VIEs and WFOEs since 2015. When 


compared to IQ’s prospectus, we found that the deferred revenues reported to the SEC were 


inflated by 261.7%, 165.5% and 86.2% in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Deferred revenue 


is a balance sheet account that arises when customers prepay for a service to be delivered in the 


future. Because IQ’s subscription customers prepay, most of its revenues are a function of 


deferred revenue. These pre-IPO overstatements inherently cause IQ’s post-IPO revenues to 


continue to be overstated.  


Arguably one of the most egregious examples of accounting fraud IQ commits is the inflation of 


its barter transaction revenue. Barter sublicensing revenues are determined by IQ’s internal 


estimates of the value of the content it traded. In other words, IQ’s management can effectively 


assign any value they want to these transactions, providing an easy opportunity to inflate its 


revenues. Based on the highest-end estimated value per non-exclusive episode provided by a 


former IQ employee involved in content acquisition, IQ would have needed to barter the licenses 


for ~3.9x and ~3.2x the total number of TV series episodes produced by all Chinese production 


companies to legitimately reach its reported barter revenues in 2018 and 2019, respectively.1,2,3

IQ is a mature company. It will be 10 years old this month and has lost money for 10 consecutive 


years. IQ’s losses are rapidly accelerating, unlike its growth. IQ lost RMB 10.3 billion in 2019, 


RMB 1.2 billion more than 2018. Meanwhile, paying subscriber growth in 4Q19 was its lowest 


ever at only 0.7%. IQ’s advertising revenue was down -15% in 2019 and it still has a negative 


gross margin. To us, even these horrific losses are meaningless, considering the abundance of 


fraud we have already discussed. However, if what we’ve said thus far doesn’t concern you, all 


we can say is “good Luckin”

1. IQ Overstates its User Numbers: 


Our research uncovered data from three independent sources showing that IQ overstates its DAU 


numbers by 42% to 60%. 


Data from IQ’s Back-End System Contradict its DAU Claims 


Two Chinese advertising companies provided us data from IQ’s back-end system which show 


that IQ’s actual mobile DAUs from September 2019 were 60.3% lower than the 175 million 


average mobile DAUs claimed by IQ in October 2019. 


The advertising agencies had access to IQ’s back end DAU data for China’s 19 “tier 1” cities. In 


January 2019 and January 2020, IQ published reports on the state of the online movie industry, 


wherein it provided a breakdown of the geographic distribution of its users.4,5  IQ’s reports 


indicate that in 2018, 36% of IQ’s users were in China’s 19 Tier 1 cities. The 2019 report only 


disclosed growth rates for each of China’s five tiers of cities from 2018 to 2019. Applying these 


growth rates to the 2018 distribution, we were able to calculate that the 19 tier 1 cities 


represented 35.6% of IQ’s total users in 2019. 


We collected 4 days of DAU data from the same week in China’s 19 Tier 1 cities from IQ’s back 


end data provided by the two ad companies (3 weekdays and 1 weekend day) in September 2019. 


The average mobile DAUs from the data we collected from IQ’s back-end platform was 24.7 


million. The lowest day was 23.36 million and the highest day was 25.88 million. A more 


detailed summary is provided below:

Based on the 175 million average mobile DAUs number disclosed by IQ in October 2019 and the 


35.6% of DAUs in tier 1 cities as disclosed in IQ’s 2019 report mentioned above, we expected 


62.29 million (175m x 35.6%) DAUs in China’s tier 1 cities.6 However, we found only 24.7 


million DAUs in the tier 1 cities from the back-end data provided by the ad companies. This is 


60.3% lower than what IQ’s disclosures implied. 








IQ’s “Heat Index” Maps Show Evidence of Click Farm Activity 


IQ created its own content monitoring and ranking metric to provide a sense of the popularity of 


its programming. It is called the Content Heat Index and is publicly available on IQ’s website.7,8  


According to a note on the Heat Index, these lists are compiled from data from the most recent 


three months. The typical trend for newly released popular programs starts with a spike and then 


trails off.  A few months after the peak, we found that a consistent pattern of provinces/ zones 


ranked in the top 10 for most viewers included areas with low populations, such as Macau, 


Hainan, Tibet or Inner Mongolia.  


Mainland China has 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, 


Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) whose populations are individually reported by the National Bureau 


of Statistics.  Among these total 32 different regions, Tibet always ranks last for population.  In 


2018, China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported it had just 1.478 million residents and only 


a small percent of which are Han Chinese immigrants.9  Tibet also has its own distinct local 


languages and culture.  Logic suggests Tibet should not show up in the top 10 for any of IQ’s 


shows.

However, recent checks on IQ’s popular programs including “Old Boy,” “Idol Producer” and 


“Hot Blood Dance Crew” included regions with very small populations such as Tibet, Hainan, 


Ningxia or Inner Mongolia in the top 10: 10 





It is nearly impossible for regions with such small populations to generate enough organic traffic 


to top IQ’s heat index charts. Instead, we believe these highly abnormal patterns are indications 


that IQ employs methods to inflate the viewership levels of its content.11

times, but their impact is most impactful a few months after new content is released as organic viewership levels 


fall.

QuestMobile 


In February 2020, QuestMobile published a special report titled “China Mobile Internet Amid 


COVID-19 Plague” which shows that IQ overstates its DAU numbers by at least 42%.  


The report shows that IQ’s average mobile DAUs were only 126.2 million during the first 10 


days of the 2020 Chinese Lunar New Year, versus 180 million average mobile DAUs claimed by 


IQ. Furthermore, the QuestMobile report shows IQ’s DAUs did not grow between the 2019 and 


2020 Chinese Lunar New Year:12

2. IQ Inflates its Revenues: 


Our analysis found that IQ inflated its 2019 revenue by approximately RMB 8-13 billion, or 


27%-44%. 


Barter Transactions: A Black Box 


IQ’s barter sublicensing revenues are so inflated that they wouldn’t come close to being 


believable even if IQ bartered every single TV episode produced in China in each of the last 


three years.  


IQ’s reported barter sublicensing revenues imply it traded every single TV episode produced in 


China in 2018 and 2019 for ~RMB 79,000 and ~RMB 64,000 each, respectively.13,14 A former 


IQ employee who worked in content acquisition (hereinafter referred to as “the former”) told us 


that non-exclusive licenses are typically worth RMB 1,000 to 5,000 per episode, or a maximum 


of up to RMB 20,000 for an extremely popular show. 


To give IQ every benefit of the doubt, we used the maximum of RMB 20,000 per episode, 


according to the former, as the average value of the episodes that IQ bartered. Even doing so, IQ 


would have needed to barter the licenses for ~3.9x and ~3.2x the total number of TV series 


episodes produced by all Chinese production companies in order to legitimately reach its 


reported barter revenues in 2018 and 2019, respectively. 


Barter sublicensing revenues are determined by IQ’s internal estimates of the value of the 


content it traded. In other words, IQ’s management can effectively assign any value they want to 


these transactions, providing management an easy opportunity to inflate its revenues which it 


obviously takes advantage of.  Large-scale non-monetary barter transactions are a serious red 


flag.  In September 2019, the SEC charged Comscore (NASDAQ: SCOR) and its CEO with 


fraud involving non-monetary revenues from bartered exchanges of data, and at scale much 


smaller than IQ’s.15   


The former also emphasized the massive difference between the value of exclusive and non-


exclusive content. An exclusive license for a popular show would be worth between RMB 3 and 


RMB 5 million – approximately 1,000x more than a non-exclusive license for the same show. 


According to IQ’s own disclosures, IQ only barters these non-exclusive licenses: 


“The Group also enters into nonmonetary transactions to exchange online broadcasting 


rights of licensed copyrights with other online video broadcasting companies from time 


to time. The exchanged licensed copyrights provide rights for each party to broadcast the 


licensed copyrights received on its own website only. Each transferring party retains the 


right to continue broadcasting the exclusive content on its own website and/or sublicense 


the rights to the content it surrendered in the exchange.”16

In an exclusive deal, the seller forfeits the streaming and sublicensing rights of the content to the 


purchasing party. In a non-exclusive deal, the seller retains the right to stream the content on its 


own site as well as sublicense the content to others, as explained in IQ’s disclosure above. The 


table below shows the absurdity of IQ’s purported barter sublicensing revenues: 





Deferred Revenue Discrepancies 


IQ’s reported deferred revenue is significantly overstated which further shows that it inflates its 


revenue. Deferred revenue is a balance sheet account that is supposed to arise when a customer 


has prepaid for a service delivered in the future. Because most of IQ’s customers prepay, 


revenues are a function of deferred revenue.  


We obtained Chinese credit reports for all of IQ’s VIEs and WFOEs since 2015. These are the 


onshore operating entities listed below: 


• Beijing iQIYI Science & Technology Co., Ltd., (aka "Beijing iQIYI") 


• Shanghai iQIYI Culture Media Co., Ltd. (aka "Shanghai iQIYI") 


• Shanghai Zhong Yuan Network Co., Ltd. (aka "Shanghai Zhong Yuan") 


• iQIYI Pictures (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (aka "iQIYI Pictures") 


• Beijing iQIYI Cinema Management Co., Ltd. (aka "Beijing iQIYI Cinema") 


When aggregated and compared to IQ’s F-1 prospectus, we found that the deferred revenues 


reported to the SEC were overstated by 261.7%, 165.5% and 86.2% in 2015, 2016 and 2017, 


respectively.  





Overstating its numbers to this extent in the years prior to its IPO creates a serious problem for 


IQ: it must post increasingly inflated results in order to make up for pre-existing fraud and still 


show growth, which we believe to be the only basis for IQ’s current valuation. IQ’s financials 


are littered with evidence of its various methods of inflating revenues, many of which lead back 


to its deferred revenue accounts.

IQ’s Claims of Membership Growth are Contradicted by Declining Real Deferred Revenue 


We contend that IQ’s management must be misrepresenting its number of paying subscribers, the 


average membership period, or both.  


Between 3Q18 and 1Q19, IQ reported an increase of 16.1 million paying subscribers and an 


increase in the average subscription period from 6 months to 8 months.17,18 However, IQ’s 


deferred revenue declined by 17% during the same period – this mathematical contradiction 


shows that at least one of these numbers is made up.  


With stable net membership growth and steady average revenue per user (“ARPU”), the deferred 


revenue curve should lead the realized revenue curve. Further, increasing average subscription 


periods should result in greater front-end accumulation of deferred revenues.  When charted, it 


should produce a steeper slope for the deferred revenue trend line.  


The chart below is an example of what we would expect to see if management’s claims were 


true. The deferred revenue curve consistently leads the realized revenue curve as subscribers pay 


more upfront for services to be delivered in the future.  





This following chart shows IQ’s actual deferred and realized revenue curves. The relationship 


between IQ’s deferred revenues and realized revenues is the opposite of what we would expect 


based on their claims – the realized revenue curve consistently leads the deferred revenue curve 


and the gap between the two is widening.

Page 10 of 37 





This chart strongly suggests that management is lying about its purported growing average 


subscription period, steady ARPU, growing number of paying subscribers, or all three: 





Because IQ’s management claimed it added 16.1 million net paying subscribers and that the 


average subscription period had increased from about 6 months to 8 months between 3Q18 and 


1Q19, we expected to find significant growth in deferred revenue as the prepayments 


accumulated. However, we found the opposite. The chart below shows IQ’s reported paying 


subscribers compared to its reported deferred revenue balance: 





IQ’s deferred revenues declined from RMB 2,356.3 million at the end of 3Q18 to RMB 1,960.7 


million at the end of 1Q19, a 17% decline during that 6-month period. This directly contradicts 


management’s claims of growth in the number of paying subscribers and the average 


subscription period – it is mathematically impossible for both of those statements to be true 


given the corresponding decline in deferred revenues.

Dual Membership Programs Allow IQ to Inflate its Revenues and Burn Off Fake Cash 


Our on the ground due diligence in China found that approximately 31.9% of IQ users have 


access to its VIP-only content through partnerships with IQ’s partners such as JD.com, Xiaomi 


TV and Ctrip, among others.  IQ accounts for dual memberships on a gross basis, meaning it 


records the full amount of revenue and records its partners’ share as an expense.19 We believe 


this is an improper method of accounting for these dual memberships which allows IQ to inflate 


its revenues and burn off fake cash at the same time.20 


IQ’s management has not been forthcoming with data on the number of dual members, percent 


of total members brought in through these partnerships, or IQ’s actual revenue share in these 


partnerships.  IQ’s IR representative has told investors that the revenue split with JD was 50/50, 


but did not disclose the economics of the deals with other partners. IQ’s IR has also dismissed 


the revenue/ARPU impact of the JD dual memberships and each of the other partnerships as 


“ignorable” and “immaterial.” 


We conducted in person surveys in three of China’s most affluent cities: Beijing, Shanghai and 


Guangzhou. Our survey correspondents matched IQ’s target user demographic of 18-40 year-old 


residents of these cities with at least some college education.21  We identified 1,563 who fit IQ’s 


target demographic. Of these, 613 people had access to an IQ VIP membership.22  We inquired 


how they obtained their VIP access.  The results are shown below:23 





According to analysis by a statistician, our survey results on dual memberships with JD were 


consistent and statistically significant. The data from 548 effective IQ paying subscribers 


produced an average of 21.9% of respondents who indicated their VIP membership was a dual 


 
19 IQ 2018 20-F, p. F-23 
20 Gross basis accounting should only be used when the company is the principal in the transaction. When dual 


members pay one of IQ’s partners for a membership which includes access to IQ’s content, IQ is not the principal 


and, therefore, should account for these on a net basis.  
21 Based on demographic information on IQ viewers provided by Chinese advertising companies. 
22 Dual members are members who either are or became IQ annual VIP membership and activated a free JD Plus 


membership or who are or became a JD plus member and activated a free IQ VIP membership. 
23 Between 18.4% and 25.4% with a 95% confidence interval.

membership with JD.24 Additionally, our survey results found another approximately 10% of 


respondents with VIP status indicated they obtained their membership through another dual 


membership program.25  Combined, the dual membership programs for IQ VIPs in Beijing, 


Shanghai and Guangzhou totaled approximately 31.9%. 


In IQ’s earnings calls, management has disclosed a few specific partnerships, such as JD.com, 


Ctrip and Xiaomi, as well as certain other categories of partners (such as financial institutions 


and mobile network companies), but no information on the total number of these partnerships or 


their economics.  However, details on the “2 for 1” offers can easily be found online.26  In the 


Spring of 2019, JD put out a special “3 for 1” deal: JD Plus, IQ and Zhihu for RMB 149/year.27 


Our surveys indicate that after JD, the most common partnerships were with financial institutions 


offering credit cards and mobile phone network providers:28 





Through swaps of advertising purchases, other services and commissions for membership 


revenues with related parties and other partners, IQ can easily inflate membership revenues while 


simultaneously providing a channel to burn off fake cash. IQ’s partnership with Xiaomi is an 


example of how convoluted the economics of these partnerships can be.  


Xiaomi was reported as a related party up to the end of 2017 and details of the IQ-Xiaomi 


transactions were presented in IQ’s prospectus. Although Xiaomi has continued to disclose IQ as

28 Our survey results do not represent all partnerships. Other partnerships are evident from ads in Chinese media.

a related party, IQ has not done the same.29,30  The table below is an excerpt from IQ’s 2018 20-F 


showing these historical transactions:31 





The exact details of IQ’s agreement with Xiaomi have not been disclosed by either party. 


However, the financials show that IQ paid large “commissions” to Xiaomi for the memberships 


provided and also purchased advertising and other services from Xiaomi. The net impact of their 


disclosed transactions from 2015 to 2017 resulted in a loss for IQ but RMB 110.3 million of 


membership revenue. Details from the Xiaomi partnership show how such opaque collaborations 


can be abused by management.  


The extent of IQ’s use of these dual membership programs is abundantly clear when we compare 


IQ’s ARPU to its gross margin since its IPO. Because IQ accounts for these dual memberships 


on a gross basis, its ARPU has remained relatively steady while its gross margin has plummeted: 





 
29 Xiaomi 2018 annual report, Note 39(a) Related party transactions, p.301. 
30 We find the decision to cease disclosing such details problematic because Xiaomi’s co-founder is on IQ’s board, 


and the growth trend over the prior three years suggest that their collaboration was growing by several magnitudes 


each year.

Xin’ai Sports (iQIYI Sports): $110 Million of Revenue Inflation 


IQ created ~$110 million of deferred revenue by overstating its purported contribution to its 


Xin’ai Sports (iQIYI Sports) JV. 


IQ states that it acquired a 32% stake in Beijing Xin’ai Sports Media Technology,32 a JV which 


is majority owned by Wuhan DDMC,33 a publicly traded company in China.34  IQ claims their 


32% stake came from an RMB 796 million (US$115.773 million) investment. However, when 


we compared the shareholding and investments disclosed by Wuhan DDMC, we found IQ’s 


equity was recorded as a cash investment of just RMB 38.25 million ($5.6 million)35 and found 


no record of any additional contribution due.   


IQ simply overstated its investment by claiming an additional non-cash contribution in the form 


of “content to be delivered” which IQ valued at approximately RMB 757.75 million (US$110.21 


million).  As of December 31, 2018, this non-cash contribution was recorded on IQ’s books as 


RMB 726.2 million of “deferred revenues in relation to services to be provided to a related 


party.”  


By comparing the public filings of IQ and Wuhan DDMC (Xin’ai’s parent company) we 


conclude that the deferred revenue recorded by IQ is fraudulent and no non-cash contribution 


actually exists.36 In IQ’s 2018 20-F, it claimed the remaining deferred revenue of RMB 726.155 


million “mainly represents deferred revenue in relation to content distribution, licenses of 


intellectual property and traffic support services to be provided to one of the Group’s equity 


investees.”37

Page 15 of 37 





The cash flow statements in IQ’s 2018 20-F indicate that RMB 763.75 million of its investments 


were made through non-cash contributions.38  When deducted from the total claimed investment 


amount of RMB 796 million, the remaining cash contribution is RMB 32.25 million. This is 


extremely close to the RMB 38.25 million total investment Xin’ai received from IQ, as disclosed 


in Wuhan DDMC’s filings. We believe the RMB 6 million difference is the result of other non-


cash investments that IQ’s management refers to as “insignificant” in size. 39 








The year-end 2018 balance of RMB 726.155 million in “deferred revenue to be provided” is 


RMB 37.6 million (US$5.5 million) less than the non-cash consideration of RMB 757.75 million 


that IQ claimed to have made.   


Since the investment was made in 3Q18, the difference of RMB 37.6 million was likely 


recognized as revenues by IQ in the second half of 2018, leaving the remaining RMB 726.155 


million available to be used by management to artificially boost its top line, as needed.40 


Wuhan DDMC released several announcements with details about the ownership of Xin’ai 


Sports, broken down by each shareholder and their total contributions.  In an auditor’s letter to 


the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Mazers, DDMC’s auditor, explained the position of each 


shareholder before and after each capital increase, including what additional capital contributions 


were made to the JV in each of the announcements.41   


Importantly, the auditor noted no additional capital contributions from IQ after its initial RMB 


38.25 million investment in August 2018. In fact, IQ was diluted in the two subsequent rounds. 


The excerpt and table below show the shareholders and their respective stakes at the time of the 


company’s formation. The box in red is Beijing iQIYI Technology Company, Ltd. and shows its 


stake initially began as 38.25% based on an RMB 38.25 million investment.42,43

 “1) Establishment of Xin’ai Sports JV: 


On August 6, 2018, Beijing Xinying Sports Media Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as 


"Xinying Media"), Beijing iQIYI Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "IQ"), 


Yu Lingxiao, Beijing Xinying Huizhi Media Technology Enterprises (Limited 


Partnership) (hereinafter referred to as "Xinying Huizhi") signed the "Joint Venture 


Agreement" to jointly establish Beijing Xinai Sports Media Technology Co., Ltd. 


(hereinafter referred to as "Xin’ai Sports") (see the company announcement for details, 


announcement number: Lin No. 2018-111), the proportion of equity of each party and the 


amount of capital contributed are as follows.”44 








Xin’ai’s filings never mention an additional non-cash investment nor record a receivable for IQ’s 


purported RMB 757.75 million additional non-cash contribution. In 2018, Xin’ai Sports received 


two additional rounds of financing and twice increased its registered capital. The additional 


investments were sold at a premium to the contributions made by the founding shareholders; 


therefore the total contribution exceeded the registered capital, the excess is reported as capital 


reserve (“additional paid in capital” or “APIC”) and detailed in the auditor’s letter.

Xin’ai’s schedule of shareholders shows that IQ’s total contribution to the JV is only RMB 38.25 


million. IQ’s total contribution doesn’t change in either of the two subsequent rounds of 


financing and no additional paid in capital (“APIC”) was ever recorded for IQ. IQ’s investment 


is listed under the name of one of its subsidiaries, Beijing iQIYI, in the table below:  





When Xin’ai’s end of year financial data was reconciled with the APIC reported in the auditor’s 


letter, the total assets equal the total equity and liabilities match up.  The tables below are 


composed of information from Wuhan DDMC’s 2018 annual report showing the balance sheet 


for Beijing Xin’ai.47  


Had IQ actually committed to contribute RMB 796 million, then Xin’ai’s current assets should 


be increased by approximately RMB 757.75  million48 and recorded as APIC – which it does 


not (notice the RMB 816 million APIC balance in the table above, with no APIC from IQ, 


matches the APIC on the balance sheet below); or this should appear as “other receivables,” 


which it also does not (the table on the following page shows Wuhan DDMC’s total “other 


receivables” balance is only RMB 211 million).49

A disclosure on page 128 of Wuhan DDMC’s 2018 annual report further belies IQ’s non-cash 


contribution claim. Wuhan DDMC’s “other receivables” balance is only RMB 210.886 million. 


Further, the largest counterparty accounts for only RMB 70 million, far too small to include the 


RMB 757.75 million non-cash commitment that IQ claims to have made:50 





The total equity contributions made to Xin’ai Sports, as reported by Wuhan DDMC, do not show 


any non-cash contributions.  Even if IQ had made a non-cash contribution of RMB 757.75 


million as it claims, then the corresponding liability should have been recorded as a contribution 


payable, not deferred revenue; and Xin’ai should show a receivable in the same amount.   


Neither of these entries appear in the financial statements of IQ or Wuhan DDMC/Xin’ai. 


Therefore, we conclude that IQ simply made up this non-cash contribution to add RMB 757.75 


million of fraudulent deferred revenue which management uses to inflate its revenues.  


IQ’s 2019 20-F reveals that it recognized RMB 146.3 million in revenue from the Xin’ai cookie 


jar reserve. The 2019 disclosure is split into current and non-current portions, but by simply 


adding the two together we see that the Xin’ai deferred revenue account decreased from RMB 


726.2 million in 2018 to RMB 579.9 million in 2019:51

Advertising Revenue Inflation 


The Shanghai government publishes reports showing the biggest advertising companies. The 


rankings are based on advertising revenues reported to the Shanghai SAIC office. Based on these 


2015 - 2018 reports, we conclude that IQ’s SEC filings contain cumulative estimated advertising 


revenue overstatements of RMB 5.155 billion between 2015 and 2018.52 Because we used the 


most favorable possible estimates for IQ where data was not available, we believe the actual 


overstatements are significantly larger than our estimates. 


IQ’s primary advertising company is Shanghai iQIYI Culture Media Co., Ltd., or “Shanghai 


iQIYI.”53 IQ’s secondary advertising company, Shanghai Zhong Yuan Network Media Co. 


(“Zhong Yuan”) conducts its separate live broadcasting advertising business. Its revenues were 


reported in the Shanghai SAIC’s report on the top 10 online media companies in 2015.54  


The calculations below show the extent of IQ’s advertising revenue overstatements. While it 


appeared IQ was winding down its advertising revenue inflation in 2017 in preparation for its 


IPO, IQ’s ad revenue inflation nearly tripled to RMB 1.537 billion in 2018:55

2017.

were not net of VAT. Our table adjusted for this difference so the numbers could be compared on an apples-to-

(1) The 2016 SAIC ad industry report did not include a list of top 10 internet advertisers. To generate an 


estimate, we applied the y/y growth rate of Shanghai iQIYI to Zhong Yuan
Page 22 of 37 





In its prospectus filed with the SEC, IQ claimed 2015 advertising revenues of RMB 3.4 billion. 


The tables below show that IQ only reported RMB 1.95 billion of advertising revenues to the 


SAIC in 2015, an overstatement of 74%. (revenues in RMB 10,000):56 





There was no online media company top 10 in the 2016 report, so we generously applied 


Shanghai iQIYI’s year-over-year growth rate to Zhong Yuan in order to estimate its 2016 


revenue of RMB 488 million. The table below is an excerpt from the 2016 SAIC advertising 


industry report shows that iQIYI Culture had advertising revenues of RMB 3.358 billion. IQ 


reported advertising revenues of RMB 5.65 billion to the SEC in 2016, a 38.6% overstatement 


(revenues in RMB 10,000):57 





The 2017 and 2018 SAIC advertising industry reports did include lists of the top 10 online media 


companies list. However, Zhong Yuan did not make it into the top 10 in either year. In 2017 and 


2018, the 10th place company had RMB 87 and 455 million in advertising revenues, so in order

to use the most generous possible estimate for IQ, we assumed Zhong Yuan had RMB 86.9 


million in advertising revenue in 2017 and 454.7 million in 2018. 


In total, IQ’s SAIC reported advertising revenue was 7.566 billion and 7.791 billion in 2017 and 


2018, respectively. IQ reported advertising revenues of RMB 8.16 billion and 9.328 billion to the 


SEC in those years, representing overstatements of 7.9% and 19.7% in 2017 and 2018, 


respectively. The tables below are the relevant excerpts from the 2017 and 2018 SAIC 


advertising industry reports (revenues in RMB 10,000): 








We strongly believe IQ’s advertising revenues remained inflated throughout 2019 because its 


2018 advertising revenues were overstated by almost 3x more than they were in 2017. However, 


as of the date of this report, the Shanghai SAIC office had not published a “State of the 


Advertising Industry” report for 2019.

3. Inflated Expenses and Prices of Assets Conceal Revenue Inflation  


Our research shows IQ inflates expenses and the purchase prices of assets to burn off fake cash 


and conceal its revenue inflation. 


The Skymoons Acquisition 


In July 2018, IQ paid ~$300 million to acquire Chengdu Skymoons Digital Entertainment 


(“Skymoons”). 58,59 We believe this transaction was a sham intended to burn off fake revenues 


and siphon off cash from IQ’s recent Nasdaq listing. It’s simply not credible to us to believe 


anybody would pay ~$300 million for this company. Skymoons hasn’t shown the ability to 


develop a game on its own. Months before the acquisition, a Chinese court ruled that Skymoons 


stole the IP and game design underlying its only successful game. IQ only acquired part of 


Skymoons’s business. IQ didn’t even get the Skymoons.com domain name in the acquisition. 


 Skymoons is a video game business with whom IQ partnered to create a video game to 


accompany the 2015 release of a TV series based on a very popular novel, the “Journey of the 


Flower” (花千骨).  Skymoons’ single “success” was only possible because of IQ’s marketing 


investments, the original author’s creative vision, and top tier production talent. Skymoons’ 


contribution to the partnership should have been its game design. However, three months before 


it was acquired by IQ, a Chinese court found Skymoons guilty of illegally stealing the game 


design and rules for this very game, “Journey of the Flower.”  Before its acquisition by IQ, 


Skymoons had twice tried and twice failed to be acquired by two different Chinese listed 


companies (Jinya Tech, 300028.SZ and Ningbo Fubang, 600768.SHA); both of whom were 


subsequently charged with illegal or fraudulent market practices.   


Even before the launch of the “Journey of the Flower” game itself, Skymoons immediately 


sought to capitalize on its good fortune, but failed.  In February 2015, Skymoons announced it 


was going to be 100% acquired by Jinya Technology (金亚科技 300028.sz) for RMB 2.2 billion 


in cash and shares, which gave Jinya’s share price an immediate boost:60

On June 4 and 5, 2015, Jinya Technology received two “Investigation Notices” from the China 


Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”).61  Jinya was forbidden from engaging in the asset 


restructuring necessary to consecrate the deal, and in July 2015 the deal was unwound.62  The 


CSRC investigation later found that after a large loss in 2013, Jinya Technology engaged in 


fraud.  Jinya hid years of continued losses which would have triggered its delisting.63 


In June 25, 2015, not long after the “Journey of the Flower” game’s release, a company called 


Snail Digital (苏州蜗牛数字科技股份有限公司) filed a lawsuit against both Skymoons and IQ 


accusing them of appropriating the game design and operating rules and violating its copyrights 


for its game “Taiji Panda.” The plaintiff’s complaint noted that: 


“…in June 2015, after Skymoons Interactive and IQ's mobile game ‘Journey of the 


Flower’ was launched, Snail Digital received reports from players about the game.  After 


conducting a comparison, its staff found numerous instances where the game ‘Journey of 


the Flower’ plagiarized content from ‘Taiji Panda.’  In addition, in the "Computer 


Software Copyright Registration Certificate" on file for "Journey of the Flower" at the 


National Copyright Administration of China, the functional module structure diagram, 


functional flowchart, and detailed functional design were all related to the ‘Wushen 


system’ in ‘Taiji Panda’ structural analysis; and moreover, all used game screenshots 


from ‘Taiji Panda’.”64 


After the Jinya merger fell through, Skymoons needed to find a buyer.  At the time, analysts 


observed that since Journey of the Flower, the business appeared dormant, was unlikely to 


produce any explosive news, and remained under the shadow of ongoing IP theft litigation. 


Nonetheless, in July 2016, Ningbo Fubang (宁波富邦, SHA: 600768) announced it would pay a 


combined total of RMB 3.9 billion to acquire 100% of Skymoons through a combination of cash 


and stock. Regulators did not look favorably on the backdoor listing and the transaction was 


blocked.65  The two companies attempted to restructure the deal and obtain an approval by 


decreasing the stake to 70%.66,67  Despite their efforts, the deal was abandoned. The CSRC also 


initiated an investigation into Ningbo Fubang, and in late 2017 announced that Ningbo Fubang’s 


Chairman Ying and another executive responsible for the attempted Skymoons acquisition 


conspired to profit personally through an insider trading scheme; the two had their gains 


confiscated, and were fined.68

62 https://www.ifanr.com/1068925  
63 http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2018/06/27145224734601.shtml , In both 2014 and the pre-IPO period the CSRC found 


Jinya inflated profits through fictitious customers, forging contracts, fictional remittances, forging bank documents, 


forging and receiving materials, and concealing expenses. In 2014, this fraud increased total profit by RMB 80.5 


million and inflated bank deposits of approximately 218 million yuan.  Moreover, the 2014 annual report included a 


fraudulent advance payment of RMB 310 million.

We don’t believe it’s a coincidence that both of the other companies who were willing to acquire 


Skymoons at such a rich valuation were found to have engaged in fraud. We believe Skymoons 


could not possibly command such a high valuation from a reputable company based on its own 


merits because, according to our research, it has none. 


On March 30, 2018, only three and a half months prior to IQ’s July 2018 acquisition, the Suzhou 


People’s Intermediate Court ruled that Skymoons had stolen the IP that formed the foundation 


and structure of the “Journey of the Flower” game.  Skymoons and IQ were ordered to cease the 


infringements, and pay Snail Digital an RMB 30 million fine (a very large sum for an IP case 


between Chinese domestic firms).69,70,71  The fact that Skymoons was not the true originator of 


the design of its only successful game and depended upon both creativity and talent of others as 


well as IQ’s investments and marketing power to promote and commercialize the game 


completely undermines the ridiculous valuation that IQ ascribed to it. 


Our reviews of Chinese copyright records found that Skymoons has registered no new 


publication copyrights since the July 2018 acquisition. 72  Instead, we found only the 


distribution rights for 4 games under its name, all of which were licensed from other game 


companies:

Of these licensed games, management has only publicly commented on “The Croods.”  In the 


prepared remarks of IQ’s 1Q19 earnings call, CEO Gong Yu highlighted the game as an example 


of Skymoons capabilities.  The statement is carefully worded to suggest a major role in its 


development, but in fact only credits Skymoons for “launching” and “adapting” the game, not 


designing it: 


“Another more recent example is our game business. Our subsidiary Skymoons launched 


a 3D turn-based mobile game The Croods, which is based on a famous IP licensed from 


DreamWorks Animation's 2013 popular animated feature film The Croods. The game has 


performed exceptionally well since it was launched in February, exceeding our 


expectation. This is another good showcase of our ability to adapt IP into online 


games.”73 


A further check of the IP for the of The Croods, 疯狂原始人, revealed that in November 2016, a 


mobile version of The Croods had already been produced and distributed by Shanghai Oriental 


Peral Cultural Development company.74  As such, it appears that Skymoons did nothing more 


than publish an updated version of a two-year-old mobile game. This appears to be the extent of 


Skymoons’ technical capabilities – if this company is actually worth more than RMB 2 billion, 


then the world is much richer than we thought.  


Skymoons’ founder, He Yunpeng, is a tech entrepreneur who was an executive at a prior, failed 


Baidu acquisition.  He was formerly a VP of 91 Wireless, an app distribution company that was 


acquired by Baidu for $1.9 billion in 2013.75   


91 Wireless proved to be a disastrous acquisition.  After Baidu merged it with Douku games to 


form Baidu games, the company struggled with scandals and investigations, was unable to 


compete, and ultimately was sold off in March 2017, resulting in a massive loss of over $1.7 


billion for Baidu.76,77   Although He Yunpeng left shortly after the 91 Wireless acquisition to go

form Skymoons, we consider Baidu’s willingness to work with him again on another acquisition 


highly suspicious. 


During our due diligence on Skymoons, we found that IQ didn’t even acquire all of Skymoons’ 


businesses.  Previously, both Jinya and Ningbo Fubang attempted to buy both Chengdu 


Tianxiang Interactive Digital Entertainment Co. and its sister Chengdu Tianxiang Interactive 


Technology Co.  However, IQ only acquired the first, Chengdu Skymoons Interactive Digital 


Entertainment Co.78  Its sister company, Chengdu Skymoons Interactive Technology Co., 


remained 99% held by He Yunpeng and retained the www.skymoons.com website and multiple 


permutations thereof. 








On the other hand, the Skymoons that IQ acquired had to come up with something else.  It 


appears the best its creative team could come up with was www.crimoon.net.  


 
While neither site is impressive, the www.crimoon.net  site comes across as unsophisticated if 


not amateurish and generally lacking in content.  Considering the fact that IQ paid RMB 2.4 


billion for this supposed “game development company,” we find this to be ridiculous at face 


value and believe it is indicative of utter incompetence by IQ’s management at best, or a 


completely fraudulent transaction designed to siphon cash out of the publicly-traded company 


and into management’s pockets, at worst. We invite readers to visit both sites:  


• Skymoons.com (not acquired by IQ) 


• Crimoons.net (created by IQ)

Look around and ask yourself, “which looks like it might be owned by a NASDAQ listed tech 


company with a market cap of over $12 billion?” 


Since both companies use the same logo and Skymoons / 天象互动 name, we wonder if IQ’s 


management might find He Yunpeng’s Skymoons.com website a convenience. Since IQ 


apparently has no intent to build out Skymoons, they are likely happy to have its former sister 


company keep up a more presentable site that displays the Skymoons name and logo, and posts 


content for curious visitors, who would likely just assume it was IQ’s Skymoons website. 


Skymoons’ myriad of issues calls into question how IQ’s management reached the RMB 2.4 


billion valuation and how the acquisition was accounted for. In fact, IQ didn’t provide a 


reconciliation of Skymoons’ financials to US GAAP financials for the years prior to the 


acquisition, claiming doing so would require “undue cost” due to a prior reorganization: 


“The unaudited pro forma revenue and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2017 


and 2018 is not presented as the historical financial information of the acquired business 


of Skymoons prepared under US GAAP is not available without undue cost, given the 


acquiree underwent a reorganization prior to the Company’s acquisition.”79 


We believe the above statement is a bald-faced lie by IQ’s management. The purchase 


agreement (included as Exhibit 4.66 of the same 20-F) includes the following as a closing 


condition: 


“The Target Companies have delivered to the Purchasers: (i) all capital verification 


reports of the Group Members and all relevant notes and schedules thereto issued by the 


accountants engaged by them from the date of incorporation of the Target Companies, 


the details of which are set forth under Schedule VIII: List of Financial Reports; (ii) the 


audited balance sheets of the company for 2016 and 2017 prepared on a consolidated 


basis under the US GAAP, and the relevant audited income statements and cash flow 


statements, together with all relevant notes and schedules, and in the absence of audited 


statements, the management statements shall be provided (hereinafter collectively 


referred to as the “Financial Statements”)”80 


Not only would converting Skymoons’ historical financials into U.S. GAAP not require “undue 


cost,” it wouldn’t have cost IQ anything at all – Skymoons had delivered GAAP financial 


statements to IQ prior to the deal’s closing date. This directly contradicts the already weak 


excuse provided by IQ’s management, exposing their brazen lie.

Content Price Inflation 


IQ inflated the purchase price for at least one program it licensed from Wuhan DDMC 


(“DDMC”) in 2018. As we discussed earlier in this report, DDMC is the parent company of IQ’s 


partner in the iQIYI Sports JV (aka the Xin’ai Sports JV), which IQ used to claim an additional 


RMB 757.75 million in fake deferred revenue.  


IQ’s subsidiary, Beijing Qiyi Century, was DDMC’s top customer in the film and television 


media segment in 2018. DDMC’s public disclosures reveal what appears to be an exorbitant 


premium paid by IQ for the drama “If Time Flows Back.”   


DDMC disclosed that RMB 458.0 million of its 2018 film and TV revenue came from IQ.  All of 


this came from the sale of the online broadcasting rights for two titles: “If Time Flows Back”81 


and “The Drug Hunter.”82 Below is an excerpt from DDMC’s 2018 annual report showing its 


top 5 customers by revenue: 





Notes: 


(1) Beijing Qiyi Century:  “The Drug Hunter”, “If Time Flows Back”,  


Online broadcasting rights, Rmb 458.0 million 


(2) Shanghai Cultural Media Group, “The Drug Hunter”, “If Time Flows Back”,  


TV broadcasting rights. Rmb 180.3 million 


(3) Jiangsu Province Boradcasting Group, “The Drug Hunter”,  


TV broadcasting rights, Rmb 62.5 million

Page 31 of 37 





DDMC sold IQ exclusive one-year online broadcast rights for “If Time Flows Back.”  DDMC 


sold Shanghai Cultural Media Group one-year TV broadcast rights for the same program. 


DDMC also sold online broadcast rights for “The Drug Hunter” to IQ and sold the TV 


broadcasting rights to both Shanghai Cultural Media Group and Jiangsu Provincial Broadcasting 


Group. 83 


DDMC reported total revenue of RMB 471.69 million from “If Time Flows Back” and RMB 


231.96 million from “The Drug Hunter.”84  These two programs were crucial to DDMC’s film 


and television media segment profitability in 2018.  “If Time Flows Back” was the leading 


revenue generator and achieved a 36.00% gross margin.  “The Drug Hunter” was the sixth 


largest revenue generator and delivered a 73.25% gross margin: 








At a 3.0x premium, “If Time Flows Back” stands out as being well above market price.  





The price IQ paid for “The Drug Hunter” also appears to be above the market price.  When two 


or more TV stations air a program together, they typically pay the same rate.85 Applying this cost 


sharing formula to the DDMC’s total revenues for these two programs and the revenues reported 


for each customer, we find that IQ paid a significant premium for both programs.  If Shanghai 


Cultural Media and Jiangsu Province Broadcasting both paid RMB 624 million for “The Drug 


Hunter,” we estimate that IQ paid a 1.7x premium compared to the TV rate.

The super-premium IQ paid was very helpful to their partner’s financial performance. In 2018, 


92.5% of DDMC’s gross margin from its sales of major TV programs came from the two shows 


sold to IQ.  If the program “If Time Flows Back” were priced at just 2x that paid by the TV 


stations, DDMC’s gross margin from its TV programs in 2018 would have dropped by 34.7%:  





The Chinese media has reported that competition among online platforms for top content 


intensified between 2016 and 2018. This resulted in some online broadcasting licenses selling for 


up to 2x the price paid by TV stations, especially for the popular “costume and magic/fantasy 


dramas” segment. However, the premiums paid by IQ still appear inflated.86   


A CITIC report provided a table of the highest cost copyrights from the years 2012–2018.87  The 


top programs’ license fees for both online and TV broadcasters increased each year until the 


premium ratio between online and TV peaked at 1.88x in 2017. However, there was a reversal in 


2018 and the premium declined by 20% to 1.5x.

While the 1.7x premium IQ paid for the “The Drug Hunter” was only slightly above the 2018 


average, IQ paid double the average premium for “If Time Flows Back” at 3.0x.  


Due to the developing partnership between IQ and DDMC as well as IQ’s ability to be a long-


term customer for DDMC, we would expect IQ to have considerable leverage in price 


negotiations with DDMC. However, instead of IQ using its leverage over DDMC to get 


discounts, the opposite occurred.  


We believe that IQ and DDMC conspired to over-report the price IQ paid for “If Time Flows 


Back.” This was a mutually beneficial agreement between the two partners; the premium made 


up a significant portion of DDMC’s profit in 2018, and IQ was able to burn off some of the fake 


cash it had on its balance sheet from inflating its revenues.

4. Misleading Financial Reporting Creates the Appearance of a Cash Generative Company 


We adjusted IQ’s 2019 operating cash flow (“OCF”) down from $561 million to -$1.157 billion 


by applying accounting methods consistent with others in its industry. IQ’s management, 


analysts and bulls have described the company as “the Netflix of China.”  However, we believe 


this comparison is nothing more than a fallacy perpetuated by management and other promoters. 


Content licensing and production costs are by far the largest expense for both companies. 


However, the OCF calculations used by IQ and NFLX are completely different. While Netflix 


accounts for “all additions to steaming content assets” as cash outflows from operating activities, 


IQ categorizes acquisitions of licensed copyrighted material as cash outflows from investing 


activities. Not only do the initial purchases have no negative impact on IQ’s OCF, but the 


subsequent amortization has a positive impact on OCF. IQ’s accounting methods are clearly 


intended to disguise the fact that its business is hemorrhaging cash.  In contrast, the consistently 


profitable Netflix is OCF negative. Netflix’s statement of cash flows is displayed below.  It 


classifies all of its cash used for content as "net cash used in operating activities."  This drives its 


negative OCF:88 





IQ reports three items related to content in its statement of cash flows:  amortization of licensed 


copyrights, amortization and impairment of (self) produced content, and impairment of licensed 


copyrights.  Being amortization charges, each provides a positive contribution to OCF.  Under 


“changes in operating assets and liabilities,” the cash outflows for (self) produced content are 


listed.  These are combined with other items to create the total OCF.  IQ’s largest cash expense, 


“acquisition of licensed copyrights” is recorded further below under “cash flows from investing 


 
88 Netflix, 2018 10-K, pp. 42, 46.
Page 35 of 37 





activities.”  By removing the cash outflows from acquiring licensed copyrights from OCF and 


recording it under cash flows from investing, IQ’s OCF appears positive:89   





Although we expect that professional investors will have scrutinized the statements of cash flows 


and picked up on this simple accounting gimmick, we would be remiss not to point out this 


difference and its massive impact on IQ’s headline numbers.
