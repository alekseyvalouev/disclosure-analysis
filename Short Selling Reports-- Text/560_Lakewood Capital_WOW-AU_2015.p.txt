Lakewood Capital expects Arista shares to decline below $30


Arista Networks is a supplier of networking solutions. The company primarily sells network switches


to the data center market. The company launched its initial public o�ering (IPO) on June 2014 and


priced its stock for $43 per share.


During the 52-week range, Arista Networks traded as much as $94.84 per share and as low as $55 per


share. The stock is currently trading $60.03 per share, down by more than 4% around 10:24 A.M. in


New York.  The company has approximately $3.93 billion in market capitalization.


Lakewood Capital believed that Arista Networks is one of those technology component companies that


were given a “remarkable valuation based on unsustainable �rst mover advantage.”


Lakewood Capital believes that Arista Networks will not be able to meet the market expectations. The


investment �rm said the stock will trade at “no more than 20x its longer-term GAAP earnings of $1.50


per share,” which is equivalent to a stock price below $30 per share—more than 50% lower than its


current trading price.


Arista is facing escalating pressures


The investment �rm noted that Arista Networks developed a Linux-based operating system combined


with commodity to create a low-cost and low latency software-controlled switch for cloud networking


architectures. The company is targeting the fast-growing end market with its leading product


solution.


Arista Networks increased revenues from $72 million in 2010 to almost $600 million today.


Lakewoood Capital emphasized that its heady growth attracted investors’ attention, but the


investment �rm believes that Arista Networks is poised to face a more challenging environment over


the next quarters.


Lakewood Capital emphasize that Cisco Systems, the leading networking company worldwide


launched a competing product, the Nexus 9000, which o�ers a nearly similar functionality at the same


low price point. Cisco also started a price war, and it is bundling switches with other data center


products, which makes it more competitive than Arista Networks.

https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/lakewood-capital-explains-arista-networks-woolworths-shorts/ 3/10


In addition, Lakewood Capital believed that Arista Networks is also facing escalating pressures from


other switch vendors such as Dell and Juniper Networks.  The company is also facing a lawsuit �led by


its co-founder and 22% shareholder David Cheriton and another patent litigation �led by Cisco.


Speci�cally Bozza states:


In the fourth quarter, we initiated a short position in Arista Networks, which sells


network switches, primarily into the data center market. Arista shares are up 50%


since their June 2014 IPO and the company currently sports a $5 billion market


capitalization, making it one of the most valuable networking component


companies in the world. Much like InvenSense, a company we discussed in our


last quarterly letter, we believe Arista is yet another case of a technology


component company that has been awarded a remarkable valuation based on an


unsustainable �rst mover advantage.


Several years ago, Arista developed a Linux-based operating system that it


combined with commodity silicon to create a low cost and low latency software-


controlled switch for cloud networking architectures. With a leading product


solution targeting a fast growing end market, Arista has been able to increase


revenues from $72 million in 2010 to nearly $600 million today. Such heady


growth has unsurprisingly attracted attention, and we believe the environment


for Arista will become signi�cantly more challenging in the quarters ahead.


First, Cisco, the world’s leading networking company, has responded with the


Nexus 9000 that delivers near identical functionality at the same low price point.


In Cisco’s most recent earnings call, CEO John Chambers stated, “…in just one


year we have blown by where [Arista] had gotten to in the whole history of their


company.” In addition to improving their product, Cisco has initiated a price war


and is bundling switches with its other data center products, and given its far


greater scale, Cisco has a signi�cant competitive advantage over Arista. Second,


there is a troubling trend emerging for Arista as several key target customers are


starting to buy commodity white box hardware and develop their own software.


Large cloud players like Google, Amazon and Facebook have been leading this
5/21/2018 Lakewood Capital Explains Arista Networks, Woolworths Shorts


https://www.valuewalk.com/2015/02/lakewood-capital-explains-arista-networks-woolworths-shorts/ 4/10


trend as white box hardware costs only 15% to 30% of the price of an Arista switch.


Finally, legacy switch vendors like Juniper and Dell are starting to undercut Arista


with their own software bundled with white box hardware. We believe all of these


competitive forces will drive increased commoditization of Arista’s products,


pressuring both their nearly 70% gross margins and impressive revenue growth


that have attracted investor excitement.


In addition to these escalating pressures, a pair of ongoing lawsuits poses a


signi�cant threat to Arista’s future. Last spring, Arista cofounder and 22%


shareholder David Cheriton resigned from the board and sued the company,


claiming to own large portions of the software that Arista sells. Then, in early


December, Cisco �led a lawsuit against Arista seeking an injunction from both the


ITC and the courts for violation of 14 of its patents. Disturbingly, Cisco noted in its


complaint that entire sections of its user manuals were being copied by Arista,


complete with grammatical errors.


At a multiple of nearly 50x GAAP earnings versus peers at 13x earnings, Arista’s


stock is unlikely to deliver on the market’s high expectations. Over time, we


expect the stock to trade at no more than 20x our longer-term GAAP earnings


estimate of $1.50 per share, equating to a stock price under $30 per share, more


than 50% below the current price. If the company loses either of the ongoing


lawsuits, the downside can be signi�cantly greater. We imagine company insiders


share our sentiment as the company recently released employees from the IPO


lockup 21 days early.

Woolworths is an attractive short opporunity


On the other hand, Lakewood Capital �nds Woolworth Limited, the largest super market chain


operator in Australia and New Zealand an attractive short opportunity.


According to the investment �rm the company is facing increasing competitive pressures from


discounters such as Aldi and Costco particularly in the Australian supermarket industry.


Woolworths previously enjoyed a favorable competitive environment because the Australian


supermarket industry historically operated as an e�ective duopoly—Woolworths and Coles account


for more than 70% of the supermarket spend.


Over the past decade, Woolworths consistently delivered increasing pro�tability with an outstanding


76% return on capital in its Australian segment. Aldi, a German discounter noticed Woolworth’s


impressive performance and established a presence in Australia.


Lakewood Capital believes that the Woolworths’ margins and returns on capital are no longer


sustainable due to increasing competition.


Woolworths will be forced to cut prices


Lakewood Capital observed that the current dynamics of the Australian supermarket industry is close


to its tipping point as German discounter Aldi continues to open 30 to 40 discount stores per year. At


present, there are 366 Aldi stores in Australia.


Aside from Aldi, Woolworths is also facing competition from Costco and another German discounter,


Lidl is also looking for locations in the country.  Lakewood Capital believes that Woolworths will be


compelled to reduce its prices to remain competitive, which could lead earnings and margin pressure.


Lakewood Capital emphasized that Woolworths is an attractive short opportunity because of a


combination of elevated margins, emerging competition and stretched valuation.


The investment �rm expects the company to experience earnings pressure and multiple compressions


as investors realize that it is not a defensive and steady growth story.

Lakewood Capital expected Woolworths shares to fall by nearly
50%


Lakewood Capital estimated that Woolworths’ operating margin will decline around 200bps if it will be


force to cut prices by just a few percent in its Australian segments.


The investment �rm also estimated the stock price of the company will decline almost 50%.


Woolworths closed A$32.79 per share at the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) on February 4.


Speci�cally, Bozza states:


Woolworths is Australia’s largest supermarket chain with operations across


Australia and New Zealand. We initiated a short position in Woolworths last fall as


we believe the company’s margins and returns on capital are unsustainable given


growing competitive pressures from discounters such as Aldi and Costco.


We had spent some time over the past year analyzing the troubled U.K.


supermarket industry, and we believe a similar dynamic is likely to unfold in


Australia over the coming years. In the U.K., the existing grocery chains had for


years enjoyed high margins and returns on capital that were ultimately attacked


by discounters who gained signi�cant market share by o�ering fewer products at


signi�cantly lower prices. Once the discounters reached critical mass, the


incumbents began to experience declining store tra�c and sales, resulting in


signi�cant margin pressures.


The Australian supermarket industry has historically operated as an e�ective


duopoly with Woolworths and Coles accounting for over 70% of supermarket


spend (the only other large player is IGA with less than 10% market share). This


favorable competitive environment has allowed Woolworths to consistently


increase its pro�tability over the past decade, resulting in the highest margins we


can �nd for any major supermarket chain globally and a remarkable 76% return


on capital in its Australian grocery segment.


However, these impressive economics attracted the attention of German


discounter Aldi, which has now established a signi�cant presence in the country.
5/21/2018 Lakewood Capital Explains Arista Networks, Woolworths Shorts

Aldi opened its �rst 


store in 2001 and has grown steadily to 366 stores today. Aldi �rst focused on key


markets along Australia’s eastern seaboard (which includes the key population


centers of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane). At this point, Aldi has achieved


critical mass in these markets with more than 10% market share and is now


expanding its operations in other parts of Australia. With Aldi continuing to add


30 to 40 stores per year, we believe the industry is nearing a tipping point. When


discounters in the U.K. (and France before that) reached similar market share


levels, incumbents saw their operating margins fall by more than 300bps. In


addition to Aldi, U.S.-based Costco currently has operations in Australia, and it


has been widely reported that another German discounter, Lidl, has been


scouting sites in the country. As Aldi continues to grow its store base and sales


signi�cantly faster than Woolworths and Coles (potentially joined by additional


entrants), we believe Woolworths will be forced to cut prices to remain


competitive, resulting in margin and earnings pressure.


Despite the risks that we believe exist for Woolworths, investors do not seem to


share our concerns, with the stock trading at 8.5x EBITDA and 15x earnings. In our


view, the combination of elevated margins, emerging competition and a stretched


valuation make Woolworths an attractive short opportunity. Similar to what we


saw unfold in the U.K. supermarket industry in recent years, we expect the


company will experience both earnings pressure and multiple compression as


investors realize that it is not the defensive, steady growth story they bargained


for. If Woolworths were forced to reduce prices by just a few percent in the


Australian segment to fend o� competition, overall company operating margins


would fall by roughly 200bps, which would translate into a decline in earnings of


approximately 35%. We would expect investors to pay no more than 12.5x earnings


for the business under such a scenario, resulting in almost 50% downside in the


stock from the current price of A$31 per share.
