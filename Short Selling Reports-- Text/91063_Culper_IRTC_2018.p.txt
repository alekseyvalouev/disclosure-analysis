QNST


We believe: though QuinStreet claims to be in "performance marketing," the
Company is Web 1.0 lead-gen; >200% share spike is due to numerous dubious
methods by QNST and its partners.


Numerous lawsuits, customer and employee testimony, and independent analysis
suggest these methods include egregious ACPA (cyber-squatting) and TCPA
violations, selling low-quality/recycled leads, non-credited leads, and more.


These methods are wholly unsustainable, just as they were for Bankrate, whose
business recently partnered with QNST through All Web Leads (AWL).


Traffic declines, new FCC rules, and weakness in internal controls have forced
QuinStreet to drastic measures, including malware-driven traffic. Google reliance,
customer concentration, and FCC are massive underappreciated risks.


In past 6mo alone, the FCC has issued multiple 9-figure TCPA fines. Given lack of
cash flow, $1.10/sh cash, and potential fines, our generous $2.00 price target

QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) is a web 1.0 lead gen business. It claims to generate
"qualified" leads via search engines, company-owned websites, email campaigns, and
partnerships, which it then sells to advertisers on a per-lead or per-click basis. The
Company has historically generated the majority of revenues from its Education vertical,
i.e. for-profit colleges. However, the decline in the for-profit education industry left the
Company in a precarious position.

(Source: author, using public company filings)


Nevertheless, the Company has managed to grow revenues via the Financial Services
vertical as shown. These customers consist primarily of insurance companies, as well
as, to a lesser extent, mortgage providers, credit card providers, etc.


By management's own admission, the majority of the Company's business and over
100% of growth has been the result of the "implementation of new products and media
strategies." So, what exactly do these strategies entail? Per management, (1) mix shift
to click-based products and (2) technological advantages are responsible.


…So as you see, as a mix shift away from leads, which is the dominant product in
Education, into clicks, which is the dominant product in auto insurance.



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QNST/earnings/transcripts?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
We used to only do clicks in auto insurance. And the new -- our new click platform
now represents over -- which was only launched in March, now represents well
over 60%. It is actually probably closer to 70% now of our click revenue. And
those products, again -- and that product is driving new pricing and new
leverage and new media acquisition for us, so it's across the various product
sets. It's resulting in strong growth as we indicated. That strong growth, we saw
that sequentially this quarter, and we expect to see it year-over-year in the existing
quarter and in future quarters and to see it very strongly this quarter and in future
quarters to the tune of more than 25% year-over-year growth in Financial Services,
which is, of course, now our largest business vertical, or client vertical and largest
business.


Thus, per management's own admission, this click-based platform and its associated
"new products and media strategies" have reinvigorated a business that was otherwise
left for dead, with shares up ~143% over the past year.


(Source: Google Finance)


Management would also like to have investors believe that some sort of omnipotent
"technology" is somehow driving results, yet over the past 5 years, the Company has
on average spent just 0.9% of revenues on capitalized software development as
compared to peers such as LendingTree at 2.6%, Angie's List at 5.6%, Quotient
Technology at 5.4%, and Rocket Fuel (estimated) at 5.6%. Thus, we believe that
QuinStreet's tech platform actually lags its peers.


The question then becomesk; "What is actually driving these results?"



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157920449114738_origin.png
Our research suggests that the Company has produced these results as a result of
numerous dubious tactics designed to deceive both users (i.e. leads) and lead buyers.
Each of these claims is expanded upon in detail below, while links to noted lawsuits can
be found here. Namely,


QuinStreet and its partners sites allegedly utilize an illegal tactic called "cyber
squatting" wherein users are deceived into believing that they are on an actual
insurance company's site rather than a lead gen site. QuinStreet and its partners
have been sued by numerous parties for these actions. (see Windows USA and
The General complaints linked above, Insurance Depot complaint here).


While website users input user information with the expectation of being issued a
quote, they are instead bombarded with phone calls and text messages that violate
the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). We have found numerous suits
against QuinStreet and its partners for these violations (see Becker, Sullivan,
Barrera, Heiman, Lamberis, Ramos, Debusk, and Abramson complaints linked
above, as a start).


While lead buyers are told that leads will be sold no more than twice, hence making
them "more valuable" to the customer, QuinStreet's own language implies leads are
sold up to 5 times, while partners such as AWL permit up to 8 times, customer
complaints claim over 5 times, and potential customers complain of having received
"over 20 calls." (see customer complaints below, Sullivan suit, and our study of
QuinStreet websites below).


While lead buyers are told that the leads are qualified through a "triple verification
process," we believe the vast majority of these leads are low quality (see customer
complaints in the commentary below).


While lead buyers are told that leads are "fresh" i.e. actionable, customers claim
that QuinStreet has sold leads up to 2 years old (see customer complaints below).


While customers expect to receive their money back for low quality leads, in many
cases, QuinStreet simply hasn't issued it. In fact, the Company's mis-marking of
"non-standard revenue credits" led to a misstatement of financials and
demonstrated weakness in internal controls as recently as June 30, 2017 (see
customer reviews and complaints here, here, and here).

Note that we reached out to management for comment on these claims and more, yet
did not receive a response.


This wouldn't be the first time that a lead generation business, even QuinStreet itself,
has come under scrutiny for these sorts of actions.


In 2012, the Company was investigated by the VA for portraying its websites as
government agencies in order to deceive veterans into submitting information which was
then sold to for-profit educators. The VA fined the Company $2.5mln and QuinStreet
forfeited those sites. Notably, the Company still made use of the military.com and
GIJobs.com websites which remained under its ownership.


Furthermore, Bankrate came under scrutiny for similar practices in 2011 and 2012,
leading to the business's undoing.


(Source: Google Finance)


In its time as a publicly traded company, it was alleged of RATE that,


"at least 40% of the insurance leads sold were of poor quality" (page 17).


the company "thought that we could do this all in a completely sort of invisible way,
that there would be enough growth there - there would be enough improvement
and that sort of some of the other verticals, particularly credit cards would be
masking whatever we were doing on the insurance side." (page 5)

and that "Bankrate had been using the SEM accrual account as one of its 'cushion'
or 'cookie jar reserve' accounts ... in order to meet the Adjusted EBITDA number
being dictated..."


The SEC's cease and desist filing to Bankrate can be found here. Bankrate was forced
to restate financials in 2014, the effects of which can still be found in the most recent 10-
K. Further, though Bankrate settled with the SEC in September 2014, its executives still
face SEC fraud charges as of September 2016. Finally, the most recent 10-K reveals
that RATE remains subject to a Department of Justice investigation.


Interestingly enough, QuinStreet is now partnered with this same insurance
business through All Web Leads, and we believe that AWL and other partnerships
have become integral to the Company's recent results:


In November 2015, All Web Leads announced an agreement to acquire
Bankrate's insurance division.


In February 2016, QuinStreet announced an exclusive 10-year partnership
with All Web Leads.


In May 2016, management stated that,


"During the quarter, we successfully integrated with All Web Leads and are already
seeing significant revenue and new opportunities from -- for growth from the
partnership. We expect growth in Financial Services to accelerate in Q4 as strategic
partnerships like AWL ramp and as mortgage and credit cards continue to scale."

While management would like investors to believe that AWL has been "cleaned up"
since the partnership was formed, we demonstrate that numerous customer
complaints and reviews, lawsuits against QuinStreet and its partners, and
testimony from two of QuinStreet's own employees all run counter to this claim.


Per the Company's own risk disclosures, it could be liable for not only its own actions,
but those of its partners. This potential liability is one that we believe investors are sorely
overlooking, especially given the numerous lawsuits, TCPA-related and otherwise, that
have been filed against the Company and its partners. In fact, recently appointed FCC
Chairman Ajit Pai stated in March 2017 that "our March agenda is a full one … Topping
the list will be a proposal to combat the top source of consumer complaints to the FCC:
robocalls." Pai got to work quickly,


In June 2017, DISH Network (DISH) was fined $280mln for TCPA violations.


In June 2017, Adrian Abramovich of Marketing Strategy Leaders was fined
$120mln for a spoofed robocall campaign.


In August 2017, Philip Roesel, owner of "Best Insurance Contracts" in North
Carolina, was fined $82mln for illegal robocalls - $1,000 per incident.

https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-345470A3.pdf
We believe that if the FCC has already demonstrated interest in these players, it would
be even more interested in QuinStreet. Given both (1) the importance of these tactics to
QuinStreet's business model and (2) the magnitude of the fines levied against these
companies, we believe investors are massively underestimating the impact of a potential
FCC action.


Even should the FCC (or FTC/other regulatory bodies) not take action against
QuinStreet, there are numerous additional red flags which have the potential to
permanently impair the business in swift order.


Progressive Corp. was 17% of revenues in FY 2017. Should the company ultimately
determine that its marketing dollars are better spent elsewhere, QuinStreet would face a
severe revenue and earnings cliff. The vast majority of the Progressive business is on
the company side rather than a collection of individual agencies.


Our research indicates that the Company relies on Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) to drive
the vast majority of site traffic; a single algorithm change could prove detrimental to the
business overnight. These are the same fates that businesses such as Demand Media,
RetailMeNot, or Rocket Fuel faced.


Demand Media's market cap shrunk from over $2bln to under $150mln after
Google recalibrated its search engine formula in 2011.


In 2014, RetailMeNot sold off 20% over just two days after a report found that its
visibility had fallen 33% on Google's search engine.


In November 2017, Sizmek shut down the Rocket Fuel brand "to focus on ad
transparency" after having purchased it for $145mln just a few months earlier.


Given that the Company failed to renew its revolver in June 2017, liquidity and solvency
could become issues.


With respect to valuation of the Company's equity, we believe:


QuinStreet is an outdated, low-tech, Web 1.0 business that is structurally incapable
of producing cash flow.


The Company has recently begun towing the line on numerous practices in order to
attempt one last shot at keeping itself afloat. These practices are wholly



https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
unsustainable both due to their questionable legality and their effect on alienating
the Company's customer base and lead gen base, leading to increased churn.


Without these methods, the Company would be unable to generate cash flow.


The Company's net cash position of $1.10 per share could face pressure should
the FCC or other regulatory bodies issue fines.


Thus, given a lack of cash generation ability and just $1.10 of net cash, we assign a
generous $2.00 price target, for ~80% downside.


QuinStreet is a lead gen business, not a technology business


Given the storied history of both QuinStreet and the greater lead gen industry, it is
understandable why management hopes to foster a view that the Company is actually in
the technology business.


Indeed, the very first sentence of the business description in the 10-K reads,


We are a leader in performance marketing products and technologies. Our approach
to proprietary performance marketing technologies allows clients to engage high
intent digital media or traffic from a wide range of device types (e.g., mobile, desktop,
tablet), in multiple formats or types of media (e.g., search engines, large and small
media properties or websites, email), and in a wide range of cost-per-action, or CPA,
forms.


And the Company then claims that,


Our competitive advantages include our media buying power, proprietary
technologies, extensive data and experience in performance marketing, and
significant online media market share in the markets or verticals we serve.


This "tech" theme is one reiterated throughout the Company's filings and by the sell-
side. The Company states in its form 10-K that,


Our proprietary technologies have been developed over the past 18 years to allow us
to best segment and match media or traffic, to deliver optimized results for our clients
and to operate our high volume and highly complex channel cost-efficiently.
Sell-side analysts simply take management at their word that the Company holds some
sort of technological advantage, let alone any proprietary tech at all. Per a December
2017 Barrington Research piece on the Company,


We hosted management on a series of investor meetings. A number of issues
created some recurring themes. Perhaps none of management's assertions was
more emphatic than the notion that QuinStreet is engaged in digital performance
marketing, not lead generation. Very few people are in sales. Emphasis is on
technology, with roughly 30% of the employee base comprised of engineers who
create the most technology‐driven company in the industry.


We find it interesting that the sell-side notes "management's assertions" that "QuinStreet
is engaged in digital performance marketing, not lead generation" and that "emphasis is
on technology." The analysts then claim that,


What QuinStreet strives for in terms of an operational objective is reasonably easy to
grasp. Executing on this ambition is more difficult to achieve. Technology is the
differentiating factor, and this is the business moat that provides confidence in the
sustainability and expansion potential of the QuinStreet business model.


Quite frankly, we have no idea what any of this means. One could just as well substitute
"Nike," "Disney," or "Carmax" in the place of "QuinStreet" and the sentence would make
just as much sense. Yet, none of these are technology companies. Further, it ought to
be a red flag in investors' minds any time that management and the sell-side have to
collectively convince investors as to why the business actually needs to exist.


We find that absent of the Company's ownership of numerous different websites - which
we'll get to - there is nothing backing the Company's alleged "moat." In fact, the
Company's capitalized software development per dollar of revenue is just a fraction of its
peers. Note that the Company includes Quotient Technology (formerly Coupons.com)
and Rocket Fuel Inc. in its proxy statement as peers.



http://coupons.com/
(Source: author via public company filings)


Note above that with respect to Rocket Fuel, the company doesn't break out software
vs. other capex such as purchases of new office furniture. However, the company does
disclose components of PP&E, which we use to estimate capitalized software
development costs, as shown below. Given the consistent range from 59% to 85%, we
see a 75% figure as fair and utilize it in the table above.


(Source: author via public company filings)


Thus, we find that contrary to the "management's assertions," QuinStreet's business
model is relatively simple. It owns a bunch of websites from which it generates leads of
consumers presumably looking to purchase goods or services (insurance, mortgage,
credit cards, for-profit education, etc.). It then sells these leads to insurance companies
and others, presumably looking to sell insurance to these customers. A list of the
Company's top websites (per BuiltWith) is shown below.

These leads include a name, phone number, and perhaps other relevant information
such as an address, age, weight, height, etc. After a customer fills out a form on one of
AWL's sites, an AWL agent will confirm it via a call to the customer, the process known
as "qualifying." It is then bundled with others and sold in a package.


This model is good and well assuming that (1) leads are qualified, (2) leads are acquired
in an honest fashion, (3) leads provide sufficient returns for buyers, and (4) the price that
QNST acquires leads at provides sufficient margin such that the Company generates
cash flow. We believe that QuinStreet's model is wholly impossible of satisfying each of
these conditions.


QuinStreet's Partners are Overwhelmingly Deceptive


All Web Leads (AWL)


In February 2016, QuinStreet announced an exclusive 10-year partnership with All Web
Leads (AWL) "to be the exclusive provider of click product technologies and
management to AWL." AWL refers to itself as "the premier Customer Acquisition
Marketing business focused on the U.S. insurance industry." QuinStreet seemed
especially excited about the partnership,


We are proud to partner with AWL and their excellent management team,"
commented Doug Valenti, QuinStreet CEO. "Together, we bring the largest media
network and broadest set of best-in-class customer acquisition products,
technologies, and services to the insurance industry. We intend to leverage those
combined capabilities into better consumer experiences, client results, and online
channel growth.


QuinStreet's press release claimed of AWL that,



http://baselinemag.com/

http://practicallynetworked.com/

http://investor.quinstreet.com/news-releases/news-release-details/quinstreet-announces-exclusive-partnership-all-web-leads

http://www.allwebleads.com/about-our-insurance-leads
The company delivers real-time, targeted, high-quality consumers to top
insurance producers. AWL's technology-driven approach to online marketing helps
bring together agents with qualified customers who are actively searching online for
insurance products. The company's award-winning insurance leads, calls and clicks
programs lead the industry in conversion, qualification and volume according to
recent surveys.


We believe that due to the click-based nature of the products and the timing of the
partnerships, the AWL partnership has formed the foundation of the Company's
"new click platform" that has been responsible for such tremendous growth.


We are pleased with the progress of the All Web Leads partnership. While its ramp
has been somewhat slower than they or we expected due to difficulties and
complexities associated with the integration of their acquired insuranceQuotes
business, it is already contributing significant new revenue and creating new
opportunities for both companies to better serve clients and grow revenue
together. Our enthusiasm and expectations for the partnership's potential are
stronger than ever.


On the Q4 2016 call management even stated,


thank goodness because with the loss of education leverage, the big climb in
insurance margins enabled by the new products that has really allowed us to
continue to invest but also to maintain and to begin to expand profitability as that
revenue has come.


And in the Q4 2017 call,


Improved results are being driven by positive momentum from the products and
media strategies and margin improvement efforts of the past couple of years and by
our Financial Services and home services client verticals, which now account for over
70% of company revenue.
So how does All Web Leads operate? If we dig into AWL's history, we find that in
November 2015, All Web Leads acquired insuranceQuotes.com, Bankrate's insurance
division. Bankrate wasn't exactly a stellar business.


(Source: Google Finance)


This was due primarily to the fact that just as we believe of QuinStreet's business,
Bankrate's business was incapable of both generating quality leads and generating cash
flow. A 2012 complaint against the company states,

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/13/48358568-15158666834401243_origin.png
This scheme came to light only after the company missed earnings expectations; the
scheme could only last so long before customers churned,



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157885945753708_origin.png
The SEC also found that Bankrate had booked baseless revenue.


As was earlier noted, this has been turned into a multi-year ordeal for Bankrate,
whose executives still face charges.


Nevertheless, All Web Leads now owns this same insurance business. While both
AWL and QuinStreet will claim that the business has been "cleaned up" since purchase,
we fail to see evidence that this is the case. In fact, we believe that under private
ownership, this business has been allowed to rely on increasingly dubious tactics to
drive business. So how does AWL generate leads? We believe one way is through the
illegal tactic of "cybersquatting." Per the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act
(ACPA), it is illegal to


register, traffick in, or using a domain name confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, a
trademark or personal name.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157885941900878_origin.png
In fact, AWL is being sued by The General Automobile Insurance for alleged cyber-
squatting and patent infringement. As shown in the complaint, AWL owns a variety of
websites that mimic The General's websites. Note that this document was filed as
recently as October of 2017.


We tested these claims. As shown below, if we proceed to www.general-auto-
insurance.com and enter a zip code, the page redirects to the following, with "General
Auto Insurance" clearly displayed and clearly intended to deceive the user into believing
that he is working with the actual named insurance company rather than a lead

AWL was also sued by The Insurance Depot for similar policies (subscription required).

As it turns out, insurance companies really don't like it when you pose as them in order
to sell their own potential customers back to them.


Customer reviews from insurance agents and other who have purchased leads from
AWL/QuinStreet are far from kind. See the following from Yelp! ... Note that we are not
hand-picking these reviews; as of our time of access, AWL has 11 reviews and every
single person has rated it just 1 star. Again, note the dates that are as recent as
December 2017.

The Better Business Bureau has a total of 142 complaints on AWL, and each one of the
reviews provided are negative. Though lengthy, we provide a selection of recent
complaints below. Again, we're not hand picking; we encourage investors to visit the site
themselves and compare.

Better Business Bureau reviews also reveal that buyers aren't the only ones being
deceived, but that "potential customers" are bombarded with calls against their will. The
complaints also indicate that these leads may be being sold to far more than 2 buyers,
with one person claiming over 20 phone calls in less than 12 hours.
Additionally, we find that AWL's own fine print disclosures permit the sale of leads to "up
to eight insurance companies or their agents or partner companies" as a February
2017 lawsuit against All Web Leads will show,

This language can also be found in any of the numerous websites as shown in our
Google search below.


As product in QuinStreet or AWL's case simply takes the form of customer information
(i.e. intangibles), the Company could theoretically be selling multiple times over with
zero impact to costs, hence bolstering profitability, at least in the short term. However,
we believe investors ought to question just how long this can last, especially given
Bankrate's previous fate.


InsuraMatch



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157885993457143_origin.png
On May 3, 2017, InsuraMatch announced it had entered into


a series of agreements with QuinStreet whereby it will serve as QuinStreet's national
agency sales and fulfillment center and acquire the QuinStreet Insurance Agency
Sales Center, located in Altamonte Springs, Florida.


Note that the partnership announcement is conspicuously missing from QuinStreet's
press releases. We believe that this is not accidental, but that QuinStreet is becoming
reluctant to let investors onto the true sources of its recent growth.


(Source: QuinStreet press releases)


Nevertheless, per InsuraMatch's press release, CEO Doug Valenti was again clearly
happy with the partnership's potential,


"This is a big win-win," said Doug Valenti, CEO of QuinStreet. "Through this
partnership, we will add InsuraMatch's world class Agency Sales Center operations to
our business mix. We expect greater yield and productivity from that area as a result.
This will also allow us to keep our focus on efforts and investments in our industry-
leading rates and performance marketing products and technologies, the key drivers
of competitive advantage and growth in our Insurance business."


Per InsuraMatch's website,


InsuraMatch was created to help you make better, more confident decisions about
your insurance.

https://www.insuramatch.com/blog/insuramatch-and-quinstreet-form-strategic-alliance-maximize-growth-and-focus-core-competencies
We understand that insurance is not a one-size-fits-all type of product, so we tailor
our recommendations to you and your needs. Whether you're searching for auto
insurance, homeowners insurance or even toy insurance, we're here to help you find
insurance you love - your InsuraMatch.


We surveyed thousands of current customers of dozens of top insurance companies
to understand why they chose and what they valued about their insurance carriers.
This huge database of information helps us help you pick a carrier that not only
meets your protection needs, but also your lifestyle.


Importantly, InsuraMatch is an independent agent. We represent many great
insurance companies and offer you multiple insurance quotes when you shop with us.
For our auto insurance customers, our proprietary match algorithm based on our
research will match you with the carrier that's right for you.


So, how exactly does InsuraMatch work? We again tested the site ourselves to find out
(note we are not Jeff Bourland). We were able to proceed through the entire process by
entering a name, contact information, owner information such as occupation, marital
status, commute distance, and more.
(Source: Insuramatch.com)


Upon clicking "get quotes" at the bottom of the form, we were redirected to the following
page. Note that there were no links provided to register for insurance with the listed
carriers, merely a contact number that directs back to InsuraMatch.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157886011254556_origin.png
Though the quality of these leads may be slightly higher due to higher demonstrated
customer intent, the platform remains highly deceptive, as it leads the user to believe
that he or she will actually receive bindable quotes on the spot rather than having to call
InsuraMatch's number. InsuraMatch has also been sued for TCPA violations as the
Company placed calls using an auto-dialer.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-1515788601841386_origin.png

Not only as demonstrated through the Company's partnerships with All Web Leads and
InsuraMatch, but in a suit brought by Todd Becker, testimony from QuinStreet's own
Director of Merchandising indicates that the Company is aware of these tactics. Note
that the following was entered into the court docket as recently as December 4, 2017,



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157886028272288_origin.png

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KZJ4oFF58VVmi4cHdakYx7-Y1bJp70ni/view?usp=sharing
As Exhibit B shows, www.bestmoneysearch.com claims to have "found unclaimed
funds" for the user, inducing him to enter contact information in order to "gain access."



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157886037981339_origin.png

http://www.bestmoneysearch.com/
Nevertheless, the fine print shows that the form has nothing to do with unclaimed
funds, but is a ploy to obtain information that will be sold to "marketing partners" who
will contact in regards to "educational and debt relief opportunities."


Notably, in an October 2015 FTC workshop on lead generation, QuinStreet's SVP
Corporate Development, Legal & Compliance; GC (per LinkedIn) Marty Collins
explicitly stated that the Company doesn't engage in this behavior, contrary to the
Company's own disclosure.



https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_events/684511/151030transcript.pdf
Collins notes that "That wouldn't make it a lead" and that "it wouldn't have any value."
We don't even have to show that the Company isn't providing value to its customers; its
own general counsel is doing it for us!


The Becker complaint also indicates that the company is not only bombarding its
customers with phone calls, but spoofed texts. Again, in our view, these constitute
blatant TCPA violations.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/13/48358568-15158701396536765_origin.png
In the same transcript, Collins also noted that the Company has "a responsibility to know
the sources" ... "to scour my network every day" ... and notably let on that as a public
company, "we're easy to find if we don't deliver on that commitment."
On that front, the Company claims to reject/filter out partner sites that contain
pornography,


Publisher Sites. Publisher Sites shall not promote, contain or link to any destination
that includes, contains or promotes (i) pornographic, obscene, libelous or offensive
material, (ii) software trading, hacking or phreaking content, ((iii)) unauthorized audio
or video reproduction, downloads or content, (iv) any spyware, adware, trojans,
viruses, worms, spybots, keyloggers or any other form of malware, or (v) any illegal
content.



https://quinstreet.com/publisher-terms
However, this runs contrary to the review of QuinStreet that we found on a cloud
business review website. Note that we are unaware whether the review refers to a
QuinStreet-owned site or a partner site.


Nevertheless, Barrington Research's November 2017 initiation on the Company states
that "the largest share of revenues comes through partner sites, which take on the cost
of driving traffic to their own sites." Given that this is the case, we believe investors
ought to consider the long-term effects of QuinStreet's apparent lack of discretion
regarding who it chooses as a partner.


Not only are partners' sites overwhelmingly deceptive, but so are QuinStreet's


In February 2017, QuinStreet was sued by Windows USA, LLC, a manufacturer and
retailer of premium vinyl windows and doors (would be classified under QNST's Home
Services / other vertical). The complaint alleges that QuinStreet has posed as the
company through websites such as www.windowcosts.com, www.windowquotesus.com,
and www.improvementcenter.com.



https://www.serchen.com/company/quin-street/

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/13/48358568-15158707113248444_origin.png

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xtztb0ZVfodXh6xYEwAHAxyGnMffjPOi/view?usp=sharing
Again, we believe this is a relatively clear cut case of cyber-squatting, this time
not just by QuinStreet's partners, but by the Company itself.
We explored CarInsurance.com, another one of QuinStreet's company-owned sites in
an attempt to receive "personalized car insurance quotes" as offered below.


We proceeded through the process, entering information for a 2009 Honda Civic (note
we are not Robert Townsend). As shown, the Company site states in fine print "By
clicking the button below, you authorize up to five insurance companies or their agents
to place marketing calls (including via text/SMS) to the phone number you provided
above using automated telephone dialing systems and/or pre-recorded messages."


Note that just as AWL's language stated "up to eight insurance companies" could be
given the leads information, QuinStreet's own language permits up to five insurance
companies to place marketing calls. We struggle to reconcile this with the 2 times that
is quoted to lead buyers.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/15/48358568-1516026140466703_origin.png
Upon clicking "Get Quotes," we were redirected to the following page, which didn't offer
quotes as advertised, but stated that we would be contacted from "top companies."
Upon clicking any of the "Get Quote" links in orange on the right side of the page, we
were only redirected to re-enter information with the respective companies.
We find this to be a highly deceptive practice wherein potential customers seeking
online quotes then have their information sold to multiple insurance carriers who have
the ability to bombard the customer with calls, texts, and emails.


Indeed, as shown in the previous complaint, Becker was bombarded not only by "third
party Rex Direct" but by campuscorner.com, which is owned and operated by
QuinStreet.

http://campuscorner.com/
Elsewhere, Stuart Abramson brought a class action lawsuit filed December 2016 against
QuinStreet for intrusive, nuisance telemarketing practices. In fact, Abramson sued the
wrong people at first, as we believe the telemarketers who were in fact from
QuinStreet claimed to be from Travelers Insurance. The company was using
robocalls and obscuring the true telephone number, which is illegal. Note that
INSURE.com is QuinStreet's third largest website, per BuiltWith.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/13/48358568-15158709568676364_origin.png

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qn5wpX2GCMWF6XCwmbPFGiEF7-pq3Bss/view?usp=sharing

http://insure.com/
Abramson's suit demanded all members of the class would be entitled to up to $1,500
per call or text for willful and knowing violations.


Dennis Debusk also filed a class action suit against the Company in April 2017. Note
that QuinStreet's own INSURE.com was once again the culprit.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-1515788594252714_origin.png

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/12/48358568-15157886062438638_origin.png
Debusk is seeking minimum damages of $500 per call. However, note that these
minimums are only if the defendant was "unknowingly" making these violations. Should
the court determine that these were willful and knowing, the fine again goes to $1,500
per violation.


Though we could likely go on for days with these examples, we believe its suffice to say
that these practices have become fundamental to QuinStreet's business model.
Interested readers can access a full list of registered @quinstreet.com domains here.



http://www.viewdns.info/reversewhois/?q=%40quinstreet.com
Our research has uncovered numerous other phone numbers that QuinStreet
uses to spoof those being called and obscure its identity. For example, see the
following complaints about 1-855-494-0963.


Again, we'd expect that these tactics would lead to tremendous customer churn.
However, in order to offset this churn, the Company has a return policy which will refund
customers for bad leads. Per the Company's client terms,


(1) Except as otherwise set forth herein, QS will only accept the return of a Lead
delivered to Client that (A) fails to contain the Lead Criteria; (B) is a duplicate lead
(defined as a lead sent more than once by QS to Client within the past 30 calendar
days); (C) contains clearly false information (e.g., Mickey Mouse, Santa Clause, etc.);
or (D) contains a disconnected telephone number or fax number (on both primary and
alternate numbers, if provided) AND contains an invalid email address (i.e., bounces
back). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Leads with which Client has established a
contact shall in all cases be considered valid. Unless otherwise set forth in an IO,
Warm Transfer Leads and DTSP Leads are not subject to return.


(2) Client shall submit credit requests for invalid leads via the Client Services
interface or other method specified by QS. Returned leads must include the reason
for the return, all information originally sent by QS to Client, and any other information
reasonably requested by QS. Unless otherwise QS Approved, Client must submit all
credit requests for invalid leads within five (5) business days of delivery to Client and
QS will not accept the return of any delivered leads following that date. If QS
reasonably confirms the returned Lead is invalid, QS will credit the appropriate
amount to Client.


Given the quality of leads QuinStreet generates, we find this return policy unduly
stringent. Notably missing from these terms are refunds for leads that (1) have
been sold to multiple customers, (2) leads that are "stale" and (3) leads that were
obtained via ACPA or TCPA violations, all of which we believe have been
significant drivers of QuinStreet's business.



https://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-855-494-0963

http://www.numberrecords.com/8554940963.tel

https://quinstreet.com/client-terms
We believe that the Company's tremendous amount of bad leads sold to
customers has led to increases in "non-standard revenue credits" as customers
force the Company to refund previous payments in the form of future leads.
Apparently, there are so many of these credits that the Company couldn't even relay
them through the proper channels.


Most recently, as described in Item 9A in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
as of June 30, 2017, we disclosed a material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting over the completeness and accuracy of the accounting for non-
standard revenue credits. Specifically, our internal controls did not identify non-
standard revenue credits authorized but not timely communicated to finance to
ensure proper accounting evaluation. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2017,
we identified a non-standard revenue credit that was not accounted for in the correct
period.


We did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting over the
completeness and accuracy of the accounting for non-standard revenue credits.
Specifically, our internal controls did not identify non-standard revenue credits
authorized but not timely communicated to finance to ensure proper
accounting evaluation. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we identified a
non-standard revenue credit that was not accounted for in the correct period.


In fact, we believe that the Company's identified weakness in Internal Controls
related to non-standard revenue credits is the canary in the coal mine. Notably,
though the Company has had this "non-standard revenue credit" policy in years past,
2017 was the first year in which the Company identified a weakness in internal controls
due to their use.


Our research indicates that QuinStreet's increased profitability could also be due
to its failure to pay partners (suppliers) for leads



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1117297/000156459017018479/qnst-10k_20170630.htm
As was the case with All Web Leads and InsuraMatch, QuinStreet allows individuals to
partner with the Company to supply leads which QuinStreet then re-sells. These
purchases are made through a different company-owned entities or websites such as
Surehits.com or QuinStreet Publishers. Our understanding is that the program
effectively allows anyone with a website to become a QuinStreet supplier. The Company
claims to restrict publishers from cloaking/cyber squatting, contrary to what we have
already seen from other partners and the Company's own websites.


Publisher will not (i) provide any form of incentives or compensation to generate
Traffic under this Agreement, (ii) use or engage in any false impression, email
spamming or search engine "spamming" (i.e., the inappropriate use of search engine
optimization tactics such as doorway pages or cloaking)


See a Reddit post in which a user purchases a website with the purpose of selling leads
and re-directing visitors to QuinStreet. See a screenshot of the user's website below.


(Source: Reddit)


The user noted in a comment that QuinStreet tends to "pay a lot per lead" which induces
independent partners to choose QuinStreet over other lead buyers.

However, when it comes to actually paying suppliers properly for these leads,
QuinStreet's reputation is far from robust. See the following complaint from Ripoff
Report posted as recently as November 29, 2017,


And the following from the same review site,


As it turns out, the Company's year over year revenue growth is strongly correlated to its
days payables, and the Company's recent growth has been accommodated by the
highest level of days payable the Company has seen since 2009.

(Source: author via public company filings)


We believe investors ought to consider the sustainability of these practices and payment
policies and thus what this may suggest for the Company's future growth prospects.


The Company claims that temporary reinvestment has only temporarily
depressed margins; we believe this is false; it's a structural shift in the business
model as the prior model came under intense scrutiny.


The Company's most recent 10-Q states that,


The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to decreased personnel costs
and decreased amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a higher
proportion of our revenue coming from our financial services client vertical, which
tend to have higher media and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue.


Translated, the Company has to pay Google more for each click in the more competitive
insurance vertical than it does in other verticals. Given that an increasing portion of the
Company's revenues are generated from the vertical, we see this shift as structural to
the business rather than anything one-time in nature. Nevertheless, management has
been spinning the same story for the past 3 years.

Performance marketing is a big and important opportunity. We are seeing good
success in our initiatives to diversify and expand our media, products and client
footprint. We are also seeing growing interest in success from client and media
partners alike. Our investments in new initiatives are working and are key to
returning the business to year-over-year growth. Margins will re-expand with the
return of top line growth and as we wind down this heavy investment period.


October 30, 2014,


Overall, we have reached a turning point where we now expect revenue growth in
Financial Services and Other Client Verticals and from new initiatives in Education to
offset decreases in revenue from for-profit schools in our overall results. This is a big
deal. It's what we've been working toward, and it means that we are now entering a
period where we expect overall revenue to be generally up and to the right again
versus the declines over the past few years. We also expect that adjusted EBITDA
margins will begin to re-expand with top line leverage and as we move from heavy
investments in growth to optimization.


May 5, 2015,


Turning to our outlook for the June or current quarter. We expect to grow revenue
year-over-year in each of our client verticals, Education, Financial Services and
Other, for the first time in over 3 years. Total revenue growth should be about 5%.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low single digits, as we will continue
to invest aggressively in the strong progress of our growth initiatives.


We will continue to invest in our growth and diversification initiatives, as these
investments are working. We expect that adjusted EBITDA margin will reexpand
over time through top line leverage.

In summary, the second quarter marked an important step in our progress to
diversify and reinvigorate our business. Over the past few years we have worked to
broaden and enhance our product set, resulting in increased media yield and better
quality results for both consumers and clients. We have expanded our media footprint
to reduce reliance on search engines and affiliates and have successfully penetrated
new markets such as not-for-profit schools and international, particularly Brazil.


August 9, 2016,


As far as margin goes, the investment period in the insurance really ended about a
year ago, which was the bottom of our margins in insurance. Our insurance margins
today are up on a variable basis - on a variable margin basis of about 5x where they
were about a year ago and are continuing to climb and are all very close to historic
margins. When I say historic, I mean margins created a drop in our insurance
business a few years ago, and that's inclusive of the AWL deal, which is kind of right
in line with kind of averages there. So we're - and thank goodness because with the
loss of education leverage, the big climb in insurance margins enabled by the new
products that has really allowed us to continue to invest but also to maintain and to
begin to expand profitability as that revenue has come.


May 9, 2017,


We do not expect - we do expect to grow revenue but we haven't completed the plan
and so we -- I can't give you any indications of what we think the rate of that growth
will be. But again, it sets up pretty nicely from a comparable standpoint and we do not
expect to meaningfully grow expenses or costs. So that should set us up pretty
well for EBITDA margin and EBITDA margin expansion next year.


While "next year's" margin expansion has been the bull case for years, management
has failed to deliver. In fact, results have materially worsened. Even if we take the
Company's own (heavily) adjusted EBITDA margin, the results aren't pretty.

Notably, EBITDA historically didn't track with free cash flow, which has been negligible
over the past few years. It is only over the past few quarters that free cash flow has
seen improvement towards EBITDA. Further, the Company has LTM stock-based

There isn't much new to the story here; QuinStreet is Web 1.0 tech, and the Company's
recent growth has come from towing the line. We believe that disregard for the ACPA,
the TCPA, and its customer base is the only hope the Company has, and is wholly
unsustainable.


In fact, QuinStreet-owned website traffic data shows that traffic to the Company's
sites is already dropping off.


We pulled the list of QuinStreet's top 50 websites via BuiltWith. The full list is below.

We then cross-referenced the top 10 sites above with Alexa traffic ranks. The results are
telling. As shown, sites experienced substantial ramps in rankings during Q4 and Q1,
while rankings have since fallen markedly since October 2017. We don't believe that this
bodes well for the Company's near-term results.

We believe that the aforementioned methods are losing steam, and the Company
may be attempting to offset declines with malware-driven traffic.

In examining sources of traffic to QuinStreet websites, we find the following for
Insure.com (QuinStreet's #3 site, per BuiltWith) via Alexa. Note that outside of the site's
reliance on Google, "newdmn.com" and "frshdmn.com" are the next highest traffic
drivers.


(Source: Alexa)


Both of these sites seemed to have only popped up as recently as November 2017, yet
are now ranked relatively highly.


For reference, Amazon updates the top 1 million websites daily, which can be accessed
here. Compare to these to more widely recognized sites such as the bbb.org which is
currently ranked #4,848, Univision.com ranked #5,252, or collegehumor.com ranked
#5,370.

(Source: Alexa)


A simple Google search reveals that newdmn appears to be redirect malware, wherein
pop-up windows redirect the user's browser to a different website than intended (in this
case, QuinStreet's own Insure.com).



https://seekingalpha.com/undefined?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
The same can be said for frshdmn.  


(Source: Google, author annotation)


We find it highly questionable that these two sites are now the top contributors to
Insure.com's traffic outside of Google.


We believe that QuinStreet will ultimately be held responsible for its own actions
and the actions of its partners. The FCC is increasingly cracking down on TCPA
violations, including multiple 9-figure fines in the past 6 months alone.


The Company's risks section states,


We depend on third-party publishers, including strategic partners, for a significant
portion of our visitors. Any decline in the supply of media available through these
third-party publishers' websites or increase in the price of this media could cause our
revenue to decline or our cost to reach visitors to increase.


A significant portion of our revenue is attributable to visitor traffic originating from
third-party publishers (including strategic partners).

FCC Chairman has been taking the issue extremely seriously. In Pai's own words,


Turning from process to substance, our March agenda is a full one. As I said, the
FCC will be voting on six items. (One-pagers describing each of these items in
greater detail will soon be made available on the Commission's website.) Topping the
list will be a proposal to combat the top source of consumer complaints to the FCC:
robocalls.


We've all been there. You're eating dinner or in the middle of watching your favorite
show and you're disturbed by the ring of a pre-recorded call. These calls are not just
a nuisance; they're often scams. For example, outlaw operators are posing as IRS
agents and threatening people, particularly older Americans and other vulnerable
populations, that if they don't send them money, law enforcement will come after
them.


There are rules on the books prohibiting these unwanted calls, but scofflaws are
finding creative ways to avoid getting caught. When U.S. consumers are receiving 2.4
billion robocalls a month, we need to do more. And by "we," I mean the FCC,
collaborating with the private sector. I'm grateful for the company leaders and
consumer groups who teamed up in 2016 to form the Robocall Strike Force, which
has been working to come up with solutions to this growing problem.


One of the issues the Task Force has singled out is caller ID spoofing. Through
spoofing, someone calling from one number (555-1212) changes caller ID information
to make it appear as though he's calling from a different number (867-5309).
Scammers and spammers use spoofing to disguise their identity, to trick consumers
into answering unwanted calls, and to hide from authorities. And under the FCC's
current rules, which generally prevent call-blocking, there is not much that carriers
can do to stop this.



https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2017/03/02/springing-forward-public-interest-fccs-march-agenda
This must change. Under my proposal, the FCC would give providers greater leeway
to block spoofed robocalls. Specifically, they could block calls that purport to be from
unassigned or invalid phone numbers (there's a database that keeps track of all
phone numbers, and many of them aren't assigned to a voice service provider or
aren't otherwise in use). There is no reason why any legitimate caller should be
spoofing an unassigned or invalid phone number. It's just a way for scammers to
evade the law.


These new rules were adopted in November 2017, and enactment could tear apart
what we believe is the foundation of QuinStreet's business.


Voice service providers are now expressly authorized to block robocalls that use
those spoofing strategies as well as those that appear to be from area codes that
don't exist or from numbers that haven't been assigned to a provider.


Not only is the FCC seeking to curb future FCPA violations, but is heavily penalizing
companies for previous actions,


In June 2017, DISH Network was fined a total of $341mln in two separate court actions
for TCPA violations. The court found that,


Dish's reckless decision to use anyone with a call center without any vetting or
meaningful supervision demonstrates a disregard for the consuming public.


Later in June 2017, Adrian Abramovich was fined $120mln for a spoofed robocall
campaign.


Abramovich made up caller identification to match the area code and first three digits
of the recipients' phone numbers. When they answered, however, an automated
message prompted them to "Press 1" to hear about "exclusive" vacation deals from
well-known travel companies like Marriott, Expedia, Hilton and TripAdvisor, according
to the FCC. Consumers who pressed the button were transferred to foreign call
centers where live operators attempted to sell the packages, which were not affiliated
with the companies mentioned in the recorded message.

http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/06/ftc-doj-case-results-historic-decision-awarding-280-million-civil

http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article157830674.html
In August 2017, Philip Roesel, owner of "Best Insurance Contracts" in North Carolina,
was fined $82mln for illegal robocalls.


The FCC found that Best Insurance Contracts and its owner/operator, Mr. Philip
Roesel (doing business as Wilmington Insurance Quotes) apparently made millions
of illegally spoofed robocalls consumers around the country. Mr. Roesel of
Wilmington, North Carolina displayed inaccurate caller ID information when making
robocalls in an effort to sell health insurance, which especially targeted vulnerable
consumers, including the elderly, the infirm, and low-income families.


Given the Company's and its partners' overwhelming use of robocalls and number
spoofing, an FCC fine could create a balance sheet event. The Company might not be
prepared for this; see the risks section of the most recent form 10-K in which the
Company discloses that its revolver has expired and not been renewed,


We may need additional capital in the future to meet our financial obligations and to
pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available or may not be
available on favorable terms and our business and financial condition could therefore
be adversely affected.


In June 2017, our revolving loan facility expired. While we anticipate that our existing
cash and cash equivalents and cash we expect to generate from future operations
will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months, we may need
to raise additional capital, including debt capital, to fund operations in the future or to
finance acquisitions.


In addition to a fine, the FCC would also likely levy increased oversight on the Company,
as is typically the case. We believe this would thus not only create a balance sheet
event, but permanently impair any potential future cash flow generating ability the
Company has.


Absent the FCC, there are other key red flags that could cause permanent
business impairment, namely customer concentration and reliance on Google.

Progressive accounted for 17% of revenues in the full year 2017, and increased to 24%
of revenues as of the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Should Progressive somehow
learn of QNST's deceptive tactics and / or have a greater focus on true ROI generation
from the source, the Company would lose a substantial portion of business. Additionally,
insurers are increasingly conducting QuinStreet's business themselves by bidding on
AdWords, decreasing their reliance on the Company. Given the suit between All Web
Leads and The General, this doesn't bode well for the Company's relationship with
insurers.


Additionally, high reliance on Google/search traffic to drive lead generation could prove
detrimental to the business should Google make a simple algorithm change. SimilarWeb
data provides percent of traffic originating via search for each site, and we query this
data with a focus on QuinStreet's top Financial Services related sites, as this vertical
has been driving results. The results are below.

As shown, these sites rely substantially on Google for traffic. We leave readers to come
to their own conclusions regarding the rest of QuinStreet's properties. Nevertheless, as
the Company admits "a substantial share" of traffic to QuinStreet and its partners'
internet properties originates via Google searches, any change in algorithms or an
adverse action from Google could impair the business.


Google makes regular updates to its algorithms, with the most recent "Fred" update in
March 2017 notably targeting "low-quality posts,"


targeting websites that violate Google's webmaster guidelines. The majority of
affected sites are blogs with low-quality posts that appear to be created mostly for the
purpose of generating ad revenue."


This isn't the first time a business would be adversely impacted by a Google algorithm
change, with peers such as Demand Media and RetailMeNot having been affected in
the past,


Demand Media has sold off a number of its hallmark properties in recent years as
part of an effort to distance itself from its reputation as a content farm ... after Google
recalibrated its search engine formula in 2011 to partly reject cheap content, Demand
Media's market capitalization shrunk dramatically, from more than $2 billion to about
$117 million today."


From a May 2014 Motley Fool article aptly titled "How One Google Algorithm Update
Can Kill A Business,"

http://labusinessjournal.com/news/2016/oct/31/demand-media-change-its-name-leaf-group/

Conclusion


Last week, shares of RetailMeNot (SALE) slid over 20% over the course of two days
after a report from SearchMetrics found that the website's visibility had fallen 33% on
Google's search engine. The decline came after Google released an update to its
search algorithm, dubbed Panda 4.0. Considering that RetailMeNot receives
approximately 65% of its traffic from search engines, this could be a huge blow to the
number of people clicking on its coupon codes.


The Company recognizes this in its risks section,


Our ability to maintain or grow the number of visitors to our owned and operated and
our third-party publishers' websites from search companies is not entirely within our
control. Search companies frequently revise their algorithms and changes in their
algorithms have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, our owned and
operated and our third-party publishers' websites to receive less favorable
placements. We have experienced fluctuations in organic rankings for a number of
our owned and operated and our third-party publishers' websites and some of our
paid listing campaigns have also been harmed by search engine algorithmic
changes. Search companies could determine that our or our third-party publishers'
websites' content is either not relevant or is of poor quality.


We believe it may only be a matter of time before Google recognizes QuinStreet's
deceptive tactics and ends the business with a few swift clicks of its own.


We believe that QuinStreet is a business that is structurally incapable of both providing
value to stakeholders while also generating cash flow. The business was left for dead
upon the collapse of the for-profit education industry, yet the Company has been given
new life via increasingly deceptive tactics in both generate leads and sell leads.
However, these tactics, as well as its partnerships such as those with All Web Leads
and InsuraMatch, will ultimately prove toxic.


We believe this toxicity may be pressuring the Company into taking even more drastic
actions that could only accelerate its demise.

As Progressive represented 24% of revenues in the most recent quarter, there is
tremendous risk should the company decide its dollars are better spent elsewhere.
Tremendous reliance on Google could prove detrimental were Google to present
another algorithm change.


Finally, the FCC has issued three 9-figure fines in the past 6 months alone, and
Chairman Ajit Pai is no doubt watching. Given the Company's numerous alleged ACPA
and TCPA violations, which we believe have only increased in volume and severity over
the past two years, potential liability could be a massive balance sheet event, and
increased post-fine regulation would likely render the business once again incapable of
producing profits.


Our price target of $2 per share implies ~80% downside, yet we believe is generous for
the shares given that we believe the Company is structurally incapable of producing
cash, has just $1.10 per share of cash on the balance sheet, and may face hefty fines.
