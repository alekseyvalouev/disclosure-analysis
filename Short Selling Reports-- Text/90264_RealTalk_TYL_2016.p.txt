Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Tech


TYL


TYL is a SaaS roll-up denying any wrongdoing when common sense says there is
a clear problem related to a meaningful piece of software.


Settled and undisclosed legal filings tied to TYL’s largest acquisition accuse breach
of contract, unjust enrichment, and negligent misrepresentation, signaling a "growth
at all costs" strategy.


"Smart money" and insiders are liquidating as organic growth plummets and all
signs point to further revenue "misses".


The clock is ticking for TYL's next acquisition as forward growth expectations imply
required acquisitions of $230-350MM in the VERY near term.


Extra Credit: Questionable labor dealings further suggest troubling management
culture.

Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is a provider of information management software for
the public sector, with a focus on small, local governments. TYL's software applications
and services are generally grouped in three areas: financial management and
education; courts and justice; and property appraisal and tax.


The bull pitch is that TYL is focused on smaller governmental agencies that may not be
"attractive" enough for the larger competitors within the space (Oracle (ORCL), SAP
(SAP), Infor, others), equating to a "focus" strategy (the lesser known of Michael Porter's
competitive strategies). Furthermore, it's not too far a leap to assume TYL's revenue
stream is rather sticky (public sector spending on software that would cause a huge
headache to change). When you combine a textbook competitive strategy, with some
proven growth, and "sticky revenue"… you get a small cap hedge fund darling. But
when the strategy requires a shift towards larger counties and you add a revenue "miss"
after an acquisition, the most notable 13F filers (largest % of portfolio) start liquidating
("Smart money is selling").


I was pitched this stock as a long, but thought "it's too crowded and it smells like a roll-
up waiting to crack". Certainly, roll-ups can be wildly lucrative, but returns can be heavily
dependent upon timing the exit, and being late to the party can be disastrous (if you
bought within the last year, you're late!). Although often touted as "compounders" very
few roll-ups offer sustainable intrinsic value growth. Most run out of steam when
acquisition opportunities dry up, pricing can no longer be pushed (power within the value
chain!), and/or costs can no longer be cut (operational leverage!). Shareholders are far
too often remembered as bag-holders who were caught holding a no-growth
conglomerate when they were promised an "amazing platform" that would garner a
premium. Shorting roll-ups can be scary, but given current sentiment and the
Street's expectations, TYL makes for a great shorting opportunity with at least
50% downside.


Recent news convinced me to perform diligence on the company, but before diving into
my "finds" and conclusions, I'll offer a quick summary of recent news.

Early indications of a problem with TYL's Odyssey software showed up back in 2014,
when Indiana inmates were mistakenly released because of alleged errors in the
information system (Odyssey), and other inmates filed a lawsuit claiming they were held
too long after their release was ordered.


More recently, numerous news sources have reported significant problems that allegedly
stem from local government agencies' use of TYL's software. On November 4th, 2016,
East Bay Times reported on the "disaster" "new case management system" that may be
at fault for unlawful arrests and imprisonments in Alameda County. Less than two
weeks later, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Sheriff of Shelby County, which
can be found here. Given that an individual's complaint would be against a local
government agency, it comes as no surprise that local government agencies are
being sued, as opposed to Tyler Technologies (this is important!).


The most recent article can be found here (Dec. 2nd), which may have caused more
noise than management was willing to abide, given TYL's statement a few days later
(Dec. 7th).


Since early November, TYL's stock has traded off by ~7%, which may indicate that the
market isn't tremendously concerned. Perhaps Mr. Market is optimistically predicting
these instances are a combination of user error and opportunistic lawyers?


That being said, I was shocked by TYL's response and the market has had a negative
response as well: the stock has traded off by more than 3% in the last couple days. This
is the summary of the response:

Real Talk Translation:


"No local county has admitted to a mistake and also proven that mistake to be our
fault. We aren't named in the lawsuit, no we must not be at fault. We aren't a party to
litigation specifically regarding Odyssey."


How can this (in Dec. 2016) be management's position given reports like this from
March 2015? Given the post-update trade-off, the market may not approve of potential
ignorance and/or denial by management.


In case you didn't read any of the above links, the words "nearly identical" suggest there
is in fact a common denominator:


Source: ARS


RTI believes it's pretty clear that there is a problem, and management is denying
responsibility and perhaps not making the required effort to fix the problem. Even if
these issues truly have nothing to do with TYL's software shortcomings, its
public response may hinder future growth.


It's also important to note that Odyssey is a meaningful business line for TYL given it
reportedly serves over 100MM residents in more than 900 counties. !!IMPORTANT!!
With an average county size of less than 115k people, it's not surprising that
these issues haven't reared their ugly heads earlier, as small counties don't
stress/test software nearly as much as large counties !!IMPORTANT!! Shelby
County has nearly 1MM residents and Alameda County serves over 1.5MM residents.
TYL recently won the business of Multnomah County, which serves about 800k
residents.

After reading TYL's response to recent reporting, I thought, "this sets up for a great short
if there is evidence of other software/legal issues". Unfortunately for shareholders,
TYL was sued back in April, settled a few days before its Q1-2016 filing, and
decided not to disclose what I consider to be a very material event. This suggests
that there may be systematic software and management issues at TYL.


To conclude this lengthy introduction, here is a recent stock chart and insider selling
activity:


Source: Google and NASDAQ


New World Systems (NWS): Steep valuation, past allegations, and a recently
settled lawsuit (post acquisition and undisclosed within Qs):


Before we go any further, it's important to note that these allegations are not coming
from "ambulance chasers". They are coming from frustrated and fed-up
governmental agencies which presumably know that their complaint will be
forced to arbitration given the language within the software agreement. It's also
important to recognize that NWS is TYL's largest acquisition to date, and came at a
time when organic growth started to collapse (graphic shown later).


Before we discuss what TYL received when it purchased NWS, let's first consider what it
paid.


According to the recent filings, the "purchase price allocation for NWS is not yet
complete":

I could speculate here, but I'll leave that to the readers. For valuation purposes, I'm
using the Nov. 2016 investor deck, where we can see that TYL acquired NWS for an
EV/Sales multiple of 5.64x:


Source: Company Filings


At >5.6x revenue and >$120MM in place, you'd expect GROWING REVENUES and
certainly NO LEGAL TROUBLE! Unfortunately for shareholders, it seems that either
TYL has downgraded its revenue expectations over time, or there has been a decline in
revenue. This is from October 2015:

Although a 7.5% decline ($124 from $134) may not seem meaningful, this is supposed
to be a "fast growing SaaS" company so anything but an upgrade is at least concerning.


Legal liabilities related to New World Systems offer insight into plummeting
organic growth (what TYL received).


Back in April 2016 (less than five months after the NWS acquisition), the City of Great
Falls sued New World Systems (Tyler Technologies as of Nov. 2015) on seven counts:


1. Breach of Contract


2. Unjust Enrichment/Rescission and Restitution


3. Breach of Express Warranty


4. Breach of Implied Warranty


5. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing


6. Negligent Misrepresentation


7. Negligence

Source: PACER


I encourage readers to download and read the case file, but essentially, the City of
Great Falls alleges that there was a software upgrade that never worked. NWS said it
was because the city needed new hardware, but it didn't work after the hardware
upgrades either. The allegations read as though the city (looking back on its history with
NWS) felt swindled. After years of alleged struggles and disagreement between the
parties, the case was settled at break-neck speed shortly before the Q1-2016
quarterly filing and prior to a "response".

Regardless of the details of the settlement, I find it concerning that a lawsuit relating to
the core business of the largest acquisition to date, and significant revenue generator, is
considered "routine". As an investor, I would certainly consider NWS allegations to
be material as potential customer losses speak to future revenue and cash flow
generation as well as management's ability to make sound capital allocation
decisions, which is vital to a roll-up/platform play.


Perhaps these allegations are in fact "routine/incidental" given that TYL's management
likely reviewed the following case prior to acquiring NWS:


Source: PACER


In the case of City of Huntsville Texas vs. New World Systems Corporation, NWS is
accused of Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation.


Certainly, this is an old case that was forced into arbitration per the software agreement.
Please give me a moment to describe why it matters:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4030159-tyler-technologies-odyssey-2016-legal-settlement-and-organic-growth-suggest-2017-revenue-miss 11/20


1. Given that the case was forced into arbitration (setting a precedent) AND a recent
case with similar allegations was filed shortly after TYL's acquisition, it is reasonable to
infer that there may be other instances that went straight to arbitration and/or instances
that are currently being arbitrated without public filings and/or disclosure.


2. Although I'd expect management to find evidence of the City of Great Falls complaints
during its diligence given that the city had been complaining for years (per the
allegations), the fact that there was a FILED case (City of Huntsville), TYL's
management has no excuse regarding a "diligence miss" related to the City of Great
Falls or other complaints because the Huntsville case should have served as a red flag
for further diligence.


In light of these facts and increased potential legal risks (Shelby Sheriff being
sued for what many on the ground are saying was a software shortcoming), TYL's
management ought to provide investors with details regarding past instances
and/or ongoing arbitration related to software complaints.

Why in the world would the hedge fund darling acquire a company with instances
of alleged fraud and misrepresentation allegations at such a rich valuation?


I try not to speculate within these SA articles, but I don't think the below argument is all
that speculative/controversial:


1. TYL enjoys a rich valuation and in the face of organic declines likely needed
non-organic growth to justify said valuation: Organic growth began plummeting prior
to the acquisition and has settled around 11% as of late. With gross margins of <50%,
it's tough to justify an EV/TTM Sales multiple of 7.34x (6.15x forward):

2. TYL is very acquisitive: Therefore, it's highly unlikely that it wasn't aware of NWS's
legal history and customer complaints (which led to a lawsuit <5 months after
acquisition):


Source: Company Filings


1+2 = 3. If revenue growth above and beyond organic growth was/is needed to justify
the stock price (per the comps), and management has a ton of acquisition expertise
(wouldn't "miss" NWS allegations and past legal dealings), then I can only conclude
that management has shifted towards a "growth at all costs" strategy.

Roll-up failures have a well-documented past, so it shouldn't be controversial to say that
a "growth at all costs" strategy is unsustainable. Growth at all costs is even more
dangerous for unsuspecting investors within a space that is predominately based
on revenue and revenue growth (SaaS space broadly).


In order to further convince myself of poor management, I considered a labor dispute.


Ongoing Labor Dispute Suggesting a Potential Negative Management Grade (in
case NWS wasn't enough)


I typically don't put much weight on labor disputes, but they can be telling/important as
third or fourth order effects. An ongoing labor dispute can be found on the PACER
system that alleges the following:


1. Discrimination in Violation of Title VII - Sex and Wage


2. Retaliation in Violation of Title VII


3. Violation of the Equal Pay Act


4. Retaliation in Violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act


5. Discrimination in Violation of the ADEA


6. Discrimination on the Basis of Sex and Wage in Violation of the NYHRL


7. Retaliation in Violation of the NYHRL


8. Violation of NY Labor Law § 194


9. Retaliation in Violation of NY Labor Law § 215


10. Age Discrimination in Violation of the NYHRL

The plaintiff worked as an account executive from approximately June 5, 2013, through
her termination effective February 16, 2015. The lawsuit was filed on June 4, 2015 and
is ongoing. The complaint reads how you'd expect a labor dispute, and TYL denies most
allegations. TYL does however admit that the plaintiff met the job requirements,
was the only female account executive in the company's Versatrans division
during the plaintiff's employment, that the plaintiff's sales representative
counterparts had a higher base salary, and that she spoke to HR about being
underpaid compared to her male counterparts.


The labor dispute case is ongoing per the PACER system as of 12/12/2016.


Prior to valuing this business, I'd like to summarize where we're at thus far:


Valuation


A true bear could easily make the argument that this stock is simply un-investable
given the potential legal risk going forward.


At a very minimum, it's abundantly clear that forward prospects are deserving of a
downgrade:


1. Forward prospects are reliant upon landing larger counties and/or acquiring additional
revenue

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4030159-tyler-technologies-odyssey-2016-legal-settlement-and-organic-growth-suggest-2017-revenue-miss 16/20


BUT


2. Several indications suggest that TYL's software struggling to handle the needs of
larger counties, and its most recent acquisition seems to have been a huge misstep
(downgraded revenue and immediate legal troubles).


As mentioned, the SaaS space is predominately priced based on revenue, forward
growth, and EBITDA margins. Previous graphic for ease/reference:


Source: Software Equity Group


Given organic growth (reported) of 10-12%, EBITDA margins of 20-25%, and net
margins of 9-12% (declining as of late with TTM of 9.26%), 2-6x TTM sales is a
reasonable "80% confidence interval".

Note: I'm not going to get into a FWD earnings argument here because roll-ups are
often cheap on a non-GAAP forward earnings basis. It's part of the joke! For reference,
TYL's non-GAAP earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by ~44% in 2015, ~26% in 2014,
and ~34% in 2013. Unfortunately for the folks who believe the numbers provided by Wall
Street (driven by management in this case), GAAP earnings are by far the most
empirically correlated metric with stock returns (Barth, Cram, and Nelson). My "Fair
Value" case is in the ballpark of a 30x FWD GAAP earnings, 40x+ TTM earnings.


With implied FWD growth of ~19% and organic growth of 10-12% (declining),
speculators are likely wondering, "when will the next acquisition announcement be
made!?"


Assuming that TYL makes an acquisition by the end of THIS MONTH, it would need to
buy a business with revenues of $50-60MM (at likely cost of $230-350MM based on
historic EV/Sales acquisition prices) in order to meet revenue expectations for 2017.


With every day that passes, those numbers increase (can only book revenue upon
completing an acquisition). Time is on the side of short seller, and this dynamic
increases the odds of value deteriorating acquisitions.


Are there enough targets? Will the quality of the targets decline? Will NWS drag organic
growth lower? These are all questions a great speculator can surely answer! Perhaps
more interesting, if TYL can find additional targets... will there be a greater fool
who pushes the stock higher?


In very practical terms, it's going to be tough to hit 2017 sales expectations without
making acquisitions. Whether or not the market "likes" those acquisition(s) is another
probability node. If TYL misses another four quarters (from now, excluding downgrades),
would you be surprised if this "fast growing SaaS" company was cut in half?


Price Target: $72.5 assuming additional lawsuits aren't brought by local
government agencies.


One should also note that TYL has missed on revenue the last two quarters:

Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Perhaps the Bulls (and Mgmt.?) will get to feel the pressure of
"time" as so many short sellers and option traders know all too well.


Summary


Happy Holidays!!


Note: TYL acquired ExecuTime in June 2016, but this acquisition won't meaningfully add
to revenues given how the announcement was written and the lack of any disclosure or
mention of the transaction within the recent quarterly filing:
