Citron Reports on Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) :  Part II 
 


Intuitive Surgical:  Angel with Broken Wings,  
or the Devil in Disguise?  


 
Our first report on Intuitive Surgical surveyed some of the major litigation problems the 
company is facing, and we reviewed some of the academic and peer comparisons of da Vinci 
surgeries to other treatment approaches.  
 
Part 2 of the investigation focuses on five more key issues that will negatively impact earnings 
in the near future and put Intuitive's stock at $300 per share in 2013.   
 
As Wall St. awaits ISRG earnings next week, which are at risk of tipping weakness in its total 
procedures growth, the real story is the macro picture, which portends enormous headwinds in 
2013 for the one-time Wall Street darling. Procedure counts will dramatically soften and new 
machines sales will flatline, due to: 


 heightened awareness of treatment cost differentials to be leveled under Obamacare,  


 the consequences of looming litigation, which will  


 force hospitals to disclose more completely and accurately the risks of complications in 
robotic surgeries, including : 


o the specific risks of being exposed to the movements of the robot's instruments 
o the electricity conducted within and through them, and  
o the surgeon's level of skill and training in manipulating the device. 


 
But $300 is just the first stop. What happens when it becomes clear that insurance companies 
will no longer pay huge reimbursement premiums for robotic surgeries?  Or the FDA initiates an 
inquest into the patient burns and perforations unique to robotic surgeries, as yet undisclosed 
in Intuitive's one-sided marketing blitz?  Or the litigation against the company from injured and 
deceased patients gains class action status?   It is Citron's belief that none of these risks are 
currently priced into the stock, and they are all very real risks indeed.  
 
In this report Citron has taken source-document research to the next level, and has actually 
databased every MAUDE (FDA) report on Intuitive, so any investor, doctor, or law firm can 
search by keyword (i.e. "malfunction", "death", "burn", "laceration", etc.)   In this report we 
also present a roadmap that shows the forces weighing on Intuitive over the next 12 to 18 
months, and the challenges they face on the way down.
Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 2 of 30 
 


 
We also must note that, as well as the tremendous commercial success generated by Intuitive, 
we respect the company and management for introducing robotic surgery into the vernacular 
of the medical community, and building one of the great growth stories of the past decade. Da 
Vinci has even starred on Grey's Anatomy!  Its marketing team has won tremendous share of 
mind with the public, and its campaign to stimulate public demand for robotic surgeries has 
been enormously successful. Too bad it has run so far beyond what the science can support.  
 
Citron also does not challenge the view that in the hands of a highly skilled, thoroughly trained 
surgeon with deep experience in robotic surgery, in cases carefully selected for 
appropriateness, da Vinci can enable many good surgical outcomes. That is not a topic of 
debate.  
 
But just like Apple's descent from $700 to $500 … everyone hits a wall sometime. Even though 
we are about to discuss some disastrous outcomes from the da Vinci robot and some significant 
challenges that the company will face to revenues from reimbursement, as well as from tort 
litigation and most important from the scientific community, our $300 figure merely reflects a 
fair current multiple for Intuitive. It does not price in any material changes in the company. And 
when multiple compression hits, it hits fast. 
 
ROADMAP TO THIS STORY:  (Click Here)   
There are five main issues explored in this story. Each is on a collision course to negatively 
impact Intuitive Surgical's financial future. Some very critical data points are new as of this 
week, while others date back a few years. However, every point has been corroborated by 
expert opinion. It is Citron's opinion that nobody has actually assembled all the pieces of the 
mosaic into a coherent investment thesis, as presented in this report.  
 
Intuitive maintains a $20 + billion market cap, and buy recommendations from a slew of 
analysts. It carries a forward EPS of 29, but analysts like Lazard insist on even higher price 
targets. We believe that their analysis is based on blindly modeling numbers and failing to see 
the changing fundamentals.

The Big Five Issues Overhanging Intuitive Surgical are:   
 











There are medical, scientific, ethical, and regulatory aspects of this story. The reason it needs a map is 
because multiple issues bear on very serious litigation risk the company has created for itself, which will 
only intensify this year and next. However, Citron’s remains intensely focused on the bottom line, and 
the inevitability of profound multiple contraction for Intuitive's Stock. Because the confluence of forces 
is interconnected, we've drawn a map to illustrate how these issues relate directly to the financial 
consequences to Intuitive, which will be discussed below.  
 
From these major topics we will address litigation risk, then utilization rate issues and finally financial 
consequences.  
  


ObamaCare: 


Politics aside, massive and profound 


changes in the ways healthcare will be 


reimbursed.  Since robotic surgeries 


cost more and can't demonstrate 


better outcomes, who pays?  


Obamacare: 


Training Surgeons 


Training Expert Robotic Surgeons: 
Good to go after two-day company 
run intensive?  Experts quoted 
competence  requires "hundreds" 
of surgeries.  Who do they practice 
on?  


Science: 


Clinical Evidence: 
After nearly 10 years in the 
market, glaring lack of evidence 
of improved outcomes in the 
two highest volume surgeries.  


Maude Database: 


MAUDE  Database  
4,600 Adverse Events, including 


injuries and deaths.  


And it's NOT the complete picture. 


Marketing:  


Marketing Robotic Surgery: 


Creating patient demand without 


proper disclosure of risks.  Perils 


of unfounded medical claims.  


This is lawsuit bait.

Over 4,600 Adverse Events – just the Tip of the Iceberg  
 


Introduction to the MAUDE database 
(NOTE: For each point below, clickable links are provided directly into the referenced MAUDE record: ) 
 
The FDA publishes and maintains a database called MAUDE (Manufacturer and user Facility Device 
Experience) which catalogs medical device malfunctions and adverse outcomes.  


Some of these records are truly disturbing. For example, consider this case:   
(We've copied the entirety of the narrative fields here because the report is so full of contradiction and 
lacking in credibility. ) 
 





Manufacturer Narrative 


On november 30, 2010, an isi clinical sales representative spoke to the surgeon that performed 


the da vinci hysterectomy on the patient. The surgeon stated that the patient did have an 


autopsy performed which found that the patient had an injury to her left external iliac artery. 


The source of the injury was not confirmed. Based on the limited information provided, it is 


indeterminable if the da vinci system, instruments or accessories contributed to the patient's 


demise. As of december 3, 2010, no adverse events have been experienced with the site's 


system. 


Event Description 


It was reported that post a successful da vinci hysterectomy procedure, the patient developed 


an infection and was not discharged as planned. Ten days post op, the patient was given a blood 


thinner and expired due to an arterial bleed. Reportedly, the patient's demise was unrelated to 


the da vinci surgical system. 


 Manufacturer Narrative 


On (b)(4) 2012, isi received a legal summons indicating that the patient expired on (b)(6) 2010, 


post op a da vinci si hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoo-oophorectomy and pelvic node 


dissection procedure performed on (b)(6) 2010. Emergency surgical procedures performed on 


the patient on (b)(6) 2010, revealed that the patient had sustained a burn to the right external 


iliac artery, pumping blood in the body cavity, causing bowel ischemia incompatible with life. 


Following the surgical procedure, pain medication was continually administered to the patient 


without good affect due to significant pain experienced by the patient. 





MAUDE :1915208 


MAUDE Database: 



http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=1915208
Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 5 of 30 
 


Remember that hysterectomy surgery is generally very routine. Surgical notes document an injury to the 
left iliac artery, and a burn to the right iliac artery.  We are unsure if there was a left/right error here; if 
there are two injuries or one. It only took one injury to cause the death of the patient. Clearly there is at 
least one burn involved. There is no other way for a burn in an arterial wall to occur except from the da 
Vinci equipment. Nonetheless, the green comments by the company attempt to exonerate the da Vinci 
by stating a complete denial of the obvious. 
 
It is necessary to understand that participation in MAUDE reporting is voluntary.  After reviewing 
numerous MAUDE records, just a few excerpted examples of which are posted below, it is Citron's 
opinion that many of these records are not being posted to further scientific inquiry or medical 
accountability -- they are being posted as an extended CYA exercise.  
 
After surveying patterns in these 4,600 MAUDE records, as we became deeply disturbed at abuses of the 
da Vinci machine, we also became disturbed by the abuses of the MAUDE database itself. Beyond the 
burns, perforations and lacerations that appear far too many times, over 90% of the reported incidents 
are reported by Intuitive Surgical, which inserts in every possible instance, including some that are 
clearly unfathomable, like the above example, that the complications or problems resulting from the 
surgery had nothing to do with the da Vinci device, and/or that the machine appears to be functioning 
without error. We'll revisit this line of defense later on in this article.  
 


Citron Publishes all the Intuitive Surgical adverse outcome records 
reported in MAUDE 
 
We needed database search capability into MAUDE to really gain insight into what the patterns really 
tell us about Intuitive's business. The searches on the FDA site were too rudimentary for real analysis. So 
Citron took the extraordinary step of downloading the entire dataset of Intuitive Surgical adverse events 
reports into a database search platform. Further, so that researchers can do their own work with it, we 
have converted the entire dataset into an easy-to-search Excel format. Interested parties can re-import 
this dataset into their own database tools and see what patterns emerge. And anyone can search Excel 
and click on the links to read any corresponding MAUDE report.  
 
In the spirit of Citron's underlying conviction that all parties should have access to all relevant 
information, we have taken the extraordinary step to republish the entire 4.600 record database in Excel 
format

(Excel  Note:  Column J contains the hyperlink to each online record at the FDA website; columns E and F 
(in red) contain the Event Description and Manufacturer's Narrative fields, which can be searched for 
keywords, and viewed in full by double-clicking.)  
 
Citron invites all parties to examine this database from their own perspectives. Some of Citron's 
observations are documented below.

Patterns Citron Identifies in MAUDE  
Citron has been analyzing this dataset for some time, and presents some conclusions which should be 
very troubling for Intuitive investors.  There are over 4,600 records in MAUDE which result from adverse 
events from Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci robot device. The outcomes range from the non-event (error 
code detected when no surgery was in progress) to severe injuries and deaths.  
 
About 3,900 of these records, or about 82% are from years 2007 to 2012. Investors are free to perform 
their own analysis, and invited to draw their own conclusions.   
 
Citron has chosen records representatives of the types of issues we are describing, neither the best nor 
the worst of their class; to stand as examples of the pattern as described: 
 
 


 1)  This adverse event dataset is built entirely from voluntary entries. That 
means that by definition, the database will never be a complete catalog of 
the adverse events from da Vinci surgeries.   
In fact, the FDA states on the MAUDE homepage that the information cannot be used to 
determine failure rates.  There is no incentive for the main reporting parties, Intutiive and the 
hospitals who are its primary customers, to enter cases into Maude.  We see many cases in 
which, as soon as the risk of legal liability emerges in a case, the hospital stops providing 
further information about the patient outcome and post-failure inquiry findings.  


o Event Type:  “Death”:   
“It was reported 2 days post a successful da Vinci si myomectomy procedure, the 
patient expired. …  the surgeon who performed the surgical procedure reported to him 
that a tenaculum forceps instrument being used during the surgical procedure was not 
moving as it should…. The csr indicated that he instructed the surgeon to have the 
instrument removed, cleaned and re-installed. The csr indicated that the site proceeded 
using the instrument and the planned surgical procedure was completed. No patient 
harm, adverse outcome or injury was reported to have occurred at the time of the 
surgical procedure. On (b)(6) 2012, the intuitive surgical csr was notified by the surgeon 
that the patient was re-admitted to the hospital on (b)(6) 2012 due to a perforated 
bowel and the patient expired on (b)(6) 2012.” 
“On (b)(6) 2012 an inspection of the site's system was performed by an intuitive surgical 
field service engineer(fse). Inspection of the site's da Vinci si surgical system by the fse 
found no issues and that the site's system functioned within specification. The site has 
indicated to the intuitive surgical clinical sales representative that the site is currently 
performing an internal investigation into the reported incident and is unable to provide 
any other details concerning the incident. Several attempts have been made to verify 
additional details concerning the reported event; however, no additional information 
was provided.” 


o Event Type:  “Death”   
“The delay in reporting is due to an administrative oversight where the aware date was 
inadvertently not updated by a customer service representative.”   
“Several attempts have been made to gather additional information regarding this event 
from this site without success.”

o Event Type:  “No Answer Provided”    
“Over a week post op, the patient underwent a pelvic exam which resulted in the 
discover of a tear and an infection.”  
“As of the date of this report, additional information has not been provided to support 
the reported event.”    


o Event Type:  “Death”:   
“Since receiving this initial report, the site has been contacted to request additional 
information without success. “    


o Event Type:  “Other”  
“Reportedly, during the biopsy procedure, the patient's renal artery was damaged.”   
“On april 13, 2012, intuitive surgical contacted the surgeon, (b)(6) and he indicated that 
the intended planned procedure was a da Vinci s partial nephrectomy procedure, 
however, he is unable to provide any other information concerning the reported event 
and that I should contact the hospital's risk management department. On april 20, 2012, 
intuitive surgical was contacted by attorney (b)(6) and she indicated that due to hippa 
regulations she is unable to provide additional information concerning the reported 
event to 3rd parties. However, the hospital will comply with any request for additional 
information directly from the fda.”  


o Event Type: “Other”   
“After 15 minutes of operation the surgeon lost control of psm arm 1, resulting in 
damage to the patient's stomach.”  
“Multiple attempts have been made to gain additional information about the event, but 
the customer has yet to provide further details.”  





 2)  Intuitive inserts CYA commentary whenever it can, whether logical or 
not.  
Over 90% of the records in Maude are posted by Intuitive Surgical. That probably accounts for 
the frequent assiduous notes stating phrases like "a review of the system logs show no errors 
occurred", and "no machine malfunctions occurred", or "the field system engineer subsequently 
tested the system, and found it to be working to manufacturer's specifications with no defect or 
malfunction".  The consistency of these comments appearing, when analyzed in full, will show a 
pattern of the company's attempt to exonerate itself from liability at every opportunity. 


What end does this serve, except to shift blame for adverse events onto 
the surgeon and the hospital – their own customers. See the "Legal Liability" 
discussion below. 


o Event Type:  “Death”:    (Also above) 
"Inspection of the site's da Vinci si surgical system by the fse found no issues and that 
the site's system functioned within specification.” 


o Event Type: “Death”   
“It was reported that during a da Vinci si ovarian transposition procedure, a 
complication occurred and the patient started to bleed. The surgeon attempted to 
control bleeding … surgeon attempted to find the source of bleeding. It is unclear on the 
sequence of events after this. The patient was confirmed to have expired. It is unknown

whether the patient expired during or after the procedure. No further information was 
provided.”   
“The system was tested by a field service engineer and performed to specifications. The 
account stated the case complications are unrelated to the da Vinci system. Multiple 
attempts for additional information from the account were made. To date, no further 
information has been received.”  


o Event Type:  “Injury”  
”It was reported that during a da Vinci si pulmonary lobectomy procedure, the patient's 
pulmonary artery was lacerated…” 
“Several follow up attempts with the site have been made concerning the patient's 
status, however, no additional information has been provided. As of (b)(4) 2012, there 
have been no reported recurrences of this issue at this hospital.” 


o  


o Event Type: “Death”   
“It was reported that during a da Vinci si bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy procedure, 
during placement of the uterine manipulator, the patient's bowel was ruptured. The 
surgeon repaired the patient's bowel, which took approximately 3 hours to repair.” 
“Additional information received from the account indicates the patient death was the 
result of a heart attack and was not related to the surgery in this event. No further 
information provided.” 


 
To be discussed later is the obvious conclusion that every time Intuitive inserts one of these 
CYA comments, they are implicitly or explicitly attempting to shift the blame to the only other 


parties – the hospital or the surgeon – their primary customer!  This point will be 
covered in depth later in this report.  





 3)  Any death is too many, especially when the majority of surgeries 
undertaken using da Vinci are supposed to be routine.  
There are 89 records that document the result of death of the patient.   (at least two appear to 
be duplicate entries, but we have not done any editing of the MAUDE data). The most recent 
was entered 12/29/2012. Some of these deaths are clearly incidental, while others are 
extremely troubling with regard to injuries apparently caused during the surgery. Set the filter 
on the Event Type column to “Death” and you can review them all. The point is that very 
serious, and sometimes lethal outcomes are the result, patients lives hang in the balance, and 
are exposed to these risks in what are very often the most routine types of surgeries being 
performed.  
 


 4)  Records appear only when publicized or years after the event.  
Everyone should be troubled to see records appearing years after the adverse outcome, 
apparently only because details of the outcome of these cases had been made public in a 
medical journal. (The cases had occurred 3 to 4 years prior to appearance in MAUDE.)  This 
strongly indicates that there are an unknown number of bad outcomes that have not been 
posted in MAUDE.  


o Event type: “Injury”    
“The following details are related to the first patient injury as alleged in the article:  …

cutting-type current set at 35 w sparked through the intact protective sheath of the 
monopolar scissors onto an adjacent metallic suction irrigator that was retracting the 
external iliac vein. Conduction through the suction irrigator resulted in a vessel injury..” 
“Isi has contacted the initial reporter concerning the reported event. A follow-up mdr 
will be submitted if additional information is provided. “ 


o Event type: “Injury”   
“The following details concerning the second patient injury as indicated in the article is 
as follows: during a da Vinci urological procedure, while performing a retroperitoneal 
lymphadenectomy using the monopolar curved scissors instrument with the mcs tip 
cover installed, the patient's small bowel was injured. 
“Isi has contacted the initial reporter concerning the reported event. A follow-up mdr 
will be submitted if additional information is provided. “ 


o Event type: “Injury”    
“The following details are related to the third patient injury as alleged in the article:  
During lymphadenectomy, activation of monopolar coagulation-type current, set at 35 
w, caused a spark to extrude laterally through the scissors insulating plastic sheath and 
onto the right external iliac artery.” 
“Isi has contacted the initial reporter concerning the reported event. A follow-up mdr 
will be submitted if additional information is provided. “ 


o Event type: “Injury”  
This one is of concern because of the five-year time lag between the publication of the 
surgical outcome and the appearance of the record in MAUDE.  
 


 5)  The most common reasons for patient injuries are perforations (organ 
punctures), lacerations (cuts) and tears. Most perforations and lacerations are 
presumably due to doctor error; however, some cases are clearly describing a context of 
machine malfunction, which itself might be caused by incorrect setup.  


o Event type: “Death”   
“It was alleged that during a da Vinci s partial nephrectomy procedure at (b)(6) hospital, 
the patient sustained cuts and lacerations, causing injury to the aorta, left renal artery, 
splenic vein and proximal renal vein. It is also alleged that during the surgical procedure 
the patient sustained perforation of the pancreas…. It is alleged that between (b)(6) 
2010 as results of the various injuries and in particular the unrepaired and untreated 
injury to the pancreas, hemorrhagic debris and fluid accumulated in the contiguous 
residual cavity, causing and/or contributing to the development of a right pleural 
effusion and pericardial effusion. On september 28th, 2012, isi became aware that the 
patient expired on (b)(6) 2010.” 
“At this time it is undetermined as to what caused the patient's death.”  [ Citron asks 
“Really?” ]

o Event type: “Injury”   
“it was noted that the patient suffered a bowel tear during the procedure.” 


o Event type: “Injury”   
“On (b)(6) 2012, intuitive surgical became aware of a bowel perforation that allegedly 
occurred during a davinci si hysterectomy … the surgeon believes that the fenestrated 
bipolar instrument activated by itself, without the surgeon pressing the foot pedal.” 
“The instrument has not been returned for evaluation. The root cause of the customer 
reported failure mode cannot be determined. Several attempts have been made to 
gather additional information regarding this event without success. As of the date of this 
report, no additional information has been provided from the site….” 


o Event type: “Death”   
“…on (b)(6) 2010, the patient underwent a da Vinci s partial nephrectomy procedure at 
(b)(6) medical center. During the surgical procedure the patient sustained perforation of 
the duodenum. Between (b)(6) 2010, the patient developed an abscess, infection and 
sepsis. The patient deceased on (b)(6) 2010.” 
“A review of the site's system log found that no system error codes were generated 
during the surgical procedure. At this time it is undetermined as to what caused damage 
to patient's duodenum. Requests for additional information have been made; however 
no additional information has been received.” 
 


 6)  The second-most prominent pattern is electrocautery: burns from 
electrical discharge.  
Many burns occur due to insulation failures, as documented in medical journals.  
(  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22825276 )  There appear to be a variety of reasons 
when electricity is delivered at unintended times or to unintended tissues.  One of the main 
sources is insulation flaws on the equipment. The details of other burn cases leave room for 
interpretation of doctor error or machine malfunction.

(also above) 


o   "small bowel was injured" (also above) 


o   "caused a spark…onto the right external iliac artery. The surface

“It was reported that during a da Vinci s prostatectomy procedure, while the surgeon 
was performing pedicle dissection, arcing from the mcs tip cover accessory installed on 
the monopolar curved scissors instrument occurred causing unintentional burning.” 


o Event type: “Other”  
“It was reported that after a da Vinci si pulmonary wedge resection procedure was 
completed, a burn was observed at one of the port sites when the cannula accessory

hospital regarding this event. Intuitive surgical investigation has shown that it is possible 
for the electrosurgical unit (esu) currents to pass through the instrument arms to 
ground, through the cannula accessory to the patient, if the patient is not properly 
grounded or if the grounding pad used by the surgical staff is faulty. As of (b)(4) 2012, 
the site has continued to use their da Vinci si surgical system and there have been no 
reported recurrences of this issue at this hospital.” 
 


 7)  Numerous cases of injury not categorized as "Injury" Event Type. There 
are hundreds of records of "Other" and "Malfunction" event types, some documented as injury-
causing, and others not. For instance, if a patient's uterus is unintentionally burned, but the 
purpose of the surgery was to remove the uterus, that record might be categorized as 
"Malfunction" rather than "Injury"…..using "no-harm, no foul" logic we presume. 


o Event type: “Other”    ( Serious outcome nonetheless --why not 
“Injury”?  ) 
“During the surgical procedure the patient sustained injuries to her left ureter and 
bladder. The planned surgical procedure was converted to open laparotomy surgery 
with repair of the bladder injury.” 
(after three surgeries… )  “Despite this treatment, the patient continues to suffer from 
nocturea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and continued leakage of urine vaginally.” 


o Event type: “Malfunction”   
“During the procedure, the surgeon noted the instrument was arcing unintentionally, 
and burned the uterus. The tip was changed out and it continued to arc….” 


o Event type: “Other”   (above) 
“It was reported that after a da Vinci si pulmonary wedge resection procedure was 
completed, a burn was observed at one of the port sites when the cannula accessory 
was removed from the instrument arm. The burnt skin was excised, however, the 
patient was burnt all the way through the tissue.” 


Event type: “Malfunction”  
“During robotic hysterectomy, no one was present at console to activate power source 
to activate pedal. However, upon advancing instruments there was smoke and a burn 
spot on the bipolar cautery instrument. The active esu cord had been plugged into the 
esu monopolar output instead of the bipolar output. There was also a burn on the 
patient's uterus. The robotic unit had instigated the electrical without anyone telling the 
panel to. The patient was having a hysterectomy so she was not harmed. … Cord may 
have been plugged into monopolar port when it should have been in bipolar port.” 
 


 8)  In many of the cases with the worst outcomes, the patient's surgery is 
closed, reported successful , and they are discharged and sent home. Only 
later do things turn for the worse.  
A common occurrence within the adverse outcomes is a surgery that is considered successful. 
The patient is closed up and sent home. This is one of principal , and much-marketed, benefits of 
robotic surgery. But the patient returns to the hospital days or weeks later, with internal 
bleeding, infection, parts still inside them, and/or other serious injuries.

o Event type: “Death”  (above)  
“It was reported that post a successful da Vinci hysterectomy procedure, the patient 
developed an infection and was not discharged as planned. Ten days post op, the 
patient was given a blood thinner and expired due to an arterial bleed. Reportedly, the 
patient's demise was unrelated to the da Vinci surgical system.” 
“Emergency surgical procedures performed on the patient on (b)(6) 2010, revealed that 
the patient had sustained a burn to the right external iliac artery, pumping blood in the 
body cavity, causing bowel ischemia incompatible with life. Following the surgical 
procedure, pain medication was continually administered to the patient without good 
affect due to significant pain experienced by the patient.” 


o Event type: “Injury”  
“It was reported that after a da Vinci s hysterectomy procedure, a bowel perforation 
was discovered post surgery. “ 
“There were no patient complications observed during the case. The bowel perforation 
was discovered after the patient presented with pain at the emergency room, after 
which a secondary, non-robotic procedure was conducted to treat the injury. The 
surgeon believes the perforation may have occurred when the camera cannula was 
inserted, or when cutting through the fascia.” 


o Event type: “Injury”  
“It was reported that after a successful da Vinci si sacrocolpopexy procedure, the 
patient was discharged on day after her postoperative lleus resolved. On the 5th day the 
patient began experiencing abdominal pain and nausea. The next day the patient went 
in for emergency care… a 5mm perforation was identified in the sigmoid colon several 
centimeters distant from the area of operation. The defect in the colon was alleged to 
be consistent with a cautery injury. It is alleged that this injury is likely associated with 
arcing/cautery of the robotic instrument.” 
“Neither the tip cover accessory nor the monopolar curved scissors have been returned 
for evaluation, therefore, the root cause of the customer reported failure mode cannot 
be determined. The root cause of the surgical complication experienced by the patient is 
also currently undetermined. On (b)(6) 2012 the initial reporter indicated that the 
physician involved with this incident had made the determination that arcing had 
caused the damage; however this determination was made approximately 30 days after 
the procedure and after the patient had returned complaining of pain. The operating 
room staff and team did not observe any arcing during the procedure and could not 
confirm the physician's observation.” 
 


What MAUDE doesn't give the public:  
In addition to not serving as a basis to measure failure rates, due to its voluntary nature, MAUDE also 
lacks the following: 


 Except for scattered comments, MAUDE contains no information about the experience level of 
surgeons or staff conducting robotic surgeries. More about this topic in the training section – 
and the litigation risks section.  


 At the same time, there are numerous occurrences of notations of hospitals refusing to provide 
further information, once there is a risk of legal exposure.

submitted well after the event date – 167 records are dated received by FDA more than six 
months after the event occurred.  


 All information about hospital, doctor, and date is redacted.  
 


Implications of MAUDE: 
 The consequences of injury created by rotobic surgery can be severe.  


 There are more adverse outcomes from robotic surgery than appear in MAUDE. Nobody knows 
how many.  


 Some of the worst injuries go undetected during the robotic surgery – the patient is sent home, 
the surgery having been declared successful.  


 Intuitive's attempts to use Maude to exonerate itself have left a trail of commentary that will 
come back to haunt the company for years – in court. (See litigation risks) 





Conclusions of reviewing MAUDE: 
If the da Vinci were a drug, the US public would not be so exposed to this uncertain situation. Drugs 
require double-blind testing for safety and efficacy before receiving licensing to enter the marketplace. 
It is due to the unique regulatory environment for "medical devices" that da Vinci can be deployed so 
widely in the market for routine use without a full suite of safety and efficacy testing.  
 
 


                                 
 
It is astonishing that after being in the marketplace for 10 years, Intuitive finds itself with its only 
product having no scientific justification for widespread use in the 70%+ of its most common 
applications:  Prostatectomies, and gynecological procedures such as hysterectomy and fibroid surgery. 
Citron can think of no other correlate in the medical field in the last generation.  
 


Gynecological Surgery:  No better outcomes than conventional or 
laparoscopic procedures 
 
Hysterectomy is Intuitive's largest volume procedure. This was published in a position statement by the 
American Institute of Gynecologic Laparascopists, yesterday. Need we say more?

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247802  
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21666467 
 
Meanwhile the failure rates continue to run high, weighing down outcomes with adverse events …  
 


 
 
The studies comparing robotic and conventional laparoscopic surgeries rate the outcomes about equal. 
But with robotic surgeries bearing a higher cost, taking longer, exposing the patient to more 
anaesthesia, and having the overhead of the undisclosed adverse outcomes as described elsewhere in 
this report, what is fueling the massive numbers of these surgeries?  Is it the company's marketing 
campaign to consumers?   Is it the company's "arms race" marketing to hospitals?  Again, what are the 
legal consequences to Intuitive?  Same open questions as above. Answers will emerge in 2013.  
 


Prostate Surgery:  "No treatment" is the preferred treatment  
 
Citron observes that while using da Vinci for Prostatectomies adds appx $4,800 to the cost of each 
surgery, there is no scientific evidence that it has produced better outcomes (the gold standard being 
improved cancer survival rates while avoiding incontinence and impotence)

robot, which costs more than a million dollars and yet has never been 
shown by a randomized trial to improve the outcomes of prostate surgery.

*The above quotes were reprinted from Citron's December 19


th
 report. 


 
What is new in this report is the legal impact of this finding in the perspective Intuitive's ongoing 
marketing campaign on behalf of robotic surgery. See the Marketing section, and also the Legal Liability 


section. What will be the legal consequences of actively promoting a surgery to consumers 
which costs more, doesn't have demonstrably better outcomes than less expensive methods, 
has extraordinary risks due to potential system malfunction or doctor error, and isn't 
statistically advantageous to no treatment"?   How will juries feel about evaluating injury 
claims with the underlying reason to engage in the surgery was based on unfounded medical 
claims?   See the legal liability section.  
 
 


Practicing Experimental Medicine on the Public: A Perspective 
"The Operation Was a Success, but the Patient Died" 
 


Citron reiterates that a robotic da Vinci surgery suite, in the hands of a highly skilled and experienced 
surgeon, and applied to the right case, can produce excellent outcomes. That is not the question at the 
heart of this inquiry.  
 
But that is not how the science of medical care delivery advances in this country. In the regulation of 
drugs the scientific method demands that all outcomes, the good, the bad, and the ugly, all have to be 
measured, with safety and efficacy weighed impartially … BEFORE entry into the marketplace, and the 
science drives the marketing claims. That is why FDA has such power to determine the labeling of drugs.  
 
For medical devices, however, the world is somewhat different because of the totality of the da Vinci 
system, and its impact on patients in surgery. It is not a single purpose appliance with a clear path to 
assess success/failure based on a narrowly defined outcome. That is why we find ourselves in the midst 
of a high-stakes, real-life quandary described by the old cliché: "The operation was a success, but the 
patient died".  
 
If Intuitive were clearly disclosing the risks and the overall data to prospective patients, they would be 
covered by the principle of "informed consent". But from a marketing standpoint, the company has 
incited tremendous demand from the public with its "glowing testimonial" advertising. Meanwhile, it 
has incited an "arms race" between hospitals, driven more by the threat of losing "customers" at any 
cost, than by dedication to delivering the best outcomes for patients, regardless of tools and methods. 
 
Therefore the ultimate judgment on da Vinci's safety and efficacy is shifted from the clinical trial to the 
courts. That is the essence of the situation the company finds itself in today. Instead of a medical 
subcommittee of experts determining if the benefits outweigh the risks in a safety and efficacy 
consideration, it will be juries.  And in that context, the company will face steep legal liabilities as 
consequences of its marketing excesses.

Since the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare, Wall Street has turned its attention to those companies 
that will become casualties of the new health policy (as well as winners).  
 
The methodology for standardizing and bringing transparency to health care costs is a system called 
"Diagnosis-related Groups (DRG's). Intuitive investors who don't know what DRG's are, had better 
educate themselves.  DRG is a fundamental shift in the way health care is reimbursed – moving away 
from simply paying cost-plus on a blank check basis, to paying for outcomes.  
 
Citron presents an unsolicited letter from a gynecological surgeon which makes our point better than we 
could: 
 


Obamacare: 



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis-related_group
Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 18 of 30 
 





"I work at two large competing hospitals. Both are not for profit in mission statement. They both 
have individual contracts with upwards of 1200 payers nationwide. The hospitals are fiercely 
private and non-transparent about both what they charge and what they have agreed as a 
contract payment. The insurance companies likewise are private and seem little interested in 
helping each other have a semblance of uniformity in payments, as  insurance companies have 
historically had a much greater focus on market share and maintenance of margin goals than in 
management or control of costs. Insurance companies do generally use Medicare rates as a 
starting point, but make concessions in a variety of ways. Rural hospitals, for example, generally 
have more of their payments on a cost-plus basis. They have fewer beds with harder economies, 
and they survive, at least in my state, because the major carriers have let them maintain a cost 
plus agreement. A mammogram in a rural hospital may pay double as an example. 


I am a traditional vaginal surgeon. My bread and butter is the vaginal hysterectomy. The retail 
bill at hospital  A is 8,000 with a final payment of 4,000. Hospital B charges 10,000 with a final 
payment of 5,000. Hospital B has negotiated richer contracts with my region's two big payers 
who are major insurers. Hospital B supports a teaching program and has the only full time 
children's hospital which is the alleged reason that their fees are higher and contractually paid 
better. 


Now when a gynecologist surgeon replaces my vaginal hysterectomy with a laparoscopc 
procedure, the retail bill goes to 15,000 and reimbursement payment goes to 7,500 to 9,000. It 
took a while for hospitals to get this increase in payment, but it is nationwide now that 
laparoscopy pays better than traditional. As a general statement about watching the hospital-
insurance game for the last 32 years, hospitals support new technology, but immediately begin 
the negotiation for higher reimbursement as the technology becomes mainstream.  


Now to the robot. My hospital a gets the same fees for robot hysterectomy as a laparoscopic 
hysterectomy. Hospital A eats the extra time and costs. Hospital B is beating the bushes 
encouraging robot use.  They are getting paid 18,000 to 21,000 for robot hysterectomy with the 
biggest market share carrier in our market. The carrier knows they are getting rooked, but are 
honoring cost plus contracts and provisions which reward extra time and costs. They are also 
saddled with a ridiculous contract clause which gives extra money when an admission is 
outpatient vs inpatient. They are counting the days until they can come back to the table and 
pay as they do for hospital A. 


Facets of Obamacare may finally provide some transparency to the above. The facet i like the 
best is to pay a set fee based on diagnosis. It's called DRG based payment. This will kill the robot 
and make low cost surgeons like me go from being low cost-low margin to low cost-high margin.  


It has always been pretty obvious to me why we pay so much more per capita for health care 
than anyone else." 


From a practicing surgeon –  
Name and Phone number confirmed
Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 19 of 30 
 


This letter is loaded with issues of critical importance overhanging Intuitive Surgical's business prospects 
for the next decade.  
   
Note the Medicare reference in paragraph 1 and the DRG reference in paragraph 5. DRG is a 
fundamental shift in the way health care is reimbursed – moving away from simply paying cost-plus on a 
blank check basis, to paying for outcomes. No it won't happen overnight, but as Citron has seen in its 
2012 critique of Questcor, when insurance companies move, they move with certainty and tend to move 
as a group.  
 


 
 
Obamacare is going to put the country on a path of paying for healthcare outcomes, not just costs. This 
shift is inevitable; our health care costs are out of control, and the entire system is completely 
unsustainable without such a move.  No other industry (with the possible exception of national defense) 
operates on blind cost-plus basis, and it explains why our healthcare costs are rising at double or triple 
the inflation rate. Medicare doesn't pay that way anymore, and within a few years, insurance companies 
won't be either.  
 
Then there is the issue of quantifiable outcomes. The stalking horse dogging Intuitive Surgical is that 
after hundreds of thousands of gynecological surgeries performed over the last decade, the medical 
community is unable prove any distinct improvement in outcomes over conventional surgical methods: 
laparoscopic and/or conventional surgery, based on conditions. The above-referenced professional 
position paper, released yesterday, is the latest and strongest statement of this reality to date. 
Meanwhile, da Vinci gynecological surgeries take longer, cost more, and expose the patient to more 
anaesthesia than conventional surgical techniques.  
 
With regard to prostate surgeries, the big decline that started in 2012 is based on recently findings that 
rocked the medical industry :  no treatment has better or equal outcomes to aggressive surgery for most 
cases.  
 
Hysterectomy and prostate surgeries represent nearly 70% of the utilization of da Vinci machines in US 
hospitals.  While Intuitive likes to say that the other 30% is "other", in fact the preponderance of these 
are gynecological surgeries also. Only about 7% of da Vinci surgeries are non-gynecological and non-
urological.  
 


Europe:  After initial promises of huge new markets, Intuitive is delivering disappointing results in 
Europe.  
 


"If the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the United States were all done 
robotically, the reported cost increases would result in an extra $960 million 
to $1.9 billion burden on the health care system."

Ask Cramer about the relative credibility of company excuses for earnings disappointments. It is Citron's 
opinion that this one is just nonsense. The real reason is nationalized health care. After having bought 
some machines, Europeans are figuring out that results are not better than cheaper methods – and with 
nationalized health care driving the purchase commitments and the standards of care, the follow-
through is simply not happening.  
 
 


                             
  
The preface to this section are points from the MAUDE section above, namely: 


 Intuitive takes positions on many MAUDE records that the adverse outcome was not the fault of 
the equipment. So who's fault are they saying it is?  


 Rarely is there information in the MAUDE record that discloses the level of specific robotic 
surgery training or experience of the surgeon in a case.  


 
Is the root cause of most of the injuries and adverse outcomes in the lawsuits as well as MAUDE are in 
fact doctor error?  Citron admits this is possible. But if it is true, investors had better realize that this 
determination just as adverse for Intuitive, or possibly even worse than findings of machine malfunction. 
This goes directly to Achilles heel of the whole thing -- the difficulty of training for real-life surgery on 
the da Vinci. This topic is so important that in the recent AAGL position statement we read in the 
conclusion:

at Cornell Medical School we read that Doctors who perform robotic-assisted prostate cancer surgery 
aren’t proficient until they have done the procedure more than 1,600 times. 
 
 


 
 
In the same article Intuitive is quick to attempt to cover its liability: 
 


”The surgeons needed to perform more than 1,600 operations before they 
were able to gauge with at least 90 percent accuracy how much tissue 
surrounding the tumor they needed to remove to get all the malignant cells. 
Leaving stray cancerous cells in the margins, at the edge of the tissue 
removed during surgery, can lead to recurrences of the disease."

So of the tens of thousands of procedures being performed in the US each year, how many of these are 
performed by surgeons with less than 100 robotic surgeries in their experience?  Less than 10?  The 
MAUDE  records do not collect information on the level of experience of the surgeon, so there is no way 
to know if the adverse outcomes are even correlated to surgeon's level of experience.  
 
The lack of training of some doctors has proven deadly as shown in this case

February 2012: The family of a Chicago man who died following a da Vinci Surgical Robot procedure was

after doctor using the robot to remove his spleen accidently punctured the lower intestine. The injury

first, MultiCare and other hospital systems pushed surgeons to use the 
pricey new tool, he said. By 2008, "We saw a big jump in the number of 
cases, and we also started to see a big jump in the number of 
complications." 
Urologists needed 200 to 250 cases to get "consistently good," he said, and

Here's a news article which resulted in a MAUDE record from 2009    
 
 


 
 
So is training to qualify as a da Vinci surgeon two days, or hundreds of surgeries?  
 
Imagine if Boeing sold airplanes but also issued pilots licenses. And imagine they could just say "come up 
to our training partner for the weekend, and we'll get you all set up"…  Now worse, imagine if a new 
pilot flew the plane, but he didn't even have to be on board. 
 
Not surprisingly, the chief medical adviser for Intuitive Surgical, dr. Myriam Curet, stil opines that overall 
"robotic surgery is safer than open surgery". And she says "you can operate robots safely in the first 25 
cases, gaining speed with experience."   
 
Are you confident in this reassurance as an investor?  How about as a patient ?  
 
Citron does not believe there is a shareholder or an analyst on the street who thinks it is good for 
Intuitive’s future for the company to put its own interests against the interests of the doctors and 
hospitals.  But now we see that when the patient “expires” the company blames it on the doctor or the 
facility.  
 
But that is just the tip of the iceberg. In order for Intuitive to push the procedure count and units sold, 
they must consistently push for new and unskilled doctors to perform surgeries that could have deadly 
consequences. Now the tort attorneys have caught on to this. In the one piece of litigation that is closest 
to trial, we see Intuitive pitted against renowned tort attorney Paul Rheingold. In the discovery requests 
the plaintiff asked for amongst other things: 


'He recounted one case of a surgeon who was using the system for the fourth time. After 
eight hours of surgery, the proctor -- an experienced surgeon who supervises the 
operation -- told the surgeon that progress was too slow. He recommended the surgeon 
switch to conventional surgery, where an incision is made from the navel to the pubic 
bone to access the prostate. 
After the proctor left the operating room, the surgeon continued using the robot. The 
patient later died from complications."

As doctors and hospitals increasingly become the targets of blame and liability for failed surgeries, 
utilization rates in hospitals of the da Vinci will come under pressure. When the hospitals begin receiving 
increased scrutiny on their credentialing and certification of surgeons to use this machine, the numbers 
of new machines sold will decline along with procedures. 
 
In the hands of a highly skilled surgeon, the Da Vinci can be a wonderful tool to get to those “hard to 
reach” places, but in the hands of an unskilled surgeon, the Da Vinci is a weapon….plain and simple. And 
with the most current read on the benefits of robotic vs. laparoscopic hysterectomies we see that the 
same skilled surgeon can save money and time and achieve the same results by using a laparoscope.  
 
Put in the starkest of terms, there are around 1,900 da Vinci units in operation in the US.  Say there 
are just 5 primary surgeons on each unit.  That's around 10,000 surgeons.  Now if it took 100 surgeries 
for each of those surgeons to reach competency, that is approximately 1 million surgeries performed 
while they were in training.  Who did they perform those training surgeries on?  Did the patients 
know? 
 
 


                                 
 
If you type "robotic surgery" into Google. You will see a paid link for davincisurgery.com , reflecting to a 
long-standing Adwords campaign run by Intuitive Surgical. Clicking through, you'll see an attractive 
website displaying video testimonials from credible sounding patients of robotic surgery, touting its 
benefits. (You will also not the separate surgeon referral site, www.davincistories.com , a further legal 
problem of notable proportions.)  The purpose of this website is clearly to encourage patients to 
demand robotic surgery for the numerous categories of surgical procedures for which a robotic 
procedure is available. Similarly, hospitals advertise their new shiny robot with bold claims and 
wonderful testimonials. 
 
This is strategic marketing from Intuitive Surgical at its most polished ….to increase patient demand for 
procedures.  
 
If this were a drug, the marketing would have to follow the science. But this being a medical device, 
regulations have allowed the company to go direct to consumers, to make bold unfounded claims 
targeted directly to patients facing the frightening prospects of surgery.

“The vast majority of hospitals provide an incomplete picture of the costs, 
risks and benefits of robot-assisted gynecologic surgery on their 
websites”  
“Marketing of robotic gynecologic surgery is widespread. Much of the 
content is not based on high-quality data, fails to present alternative 
procedures, and relies on stock text and images” 
“Many (hospitals) used emotion-laden language such as “you owe it to 
yourself” and “you or your loved one. 
In the study, less than 5% of hospitals included information about the 
robotic surgery’s costs, complications or operative time. Nearly half of the 
hospitals that discussed robotic surgery advantages such as “less pain” 
did not specify whether that was in comparison with open surgery or 
traditional laparoscopic surgery, which also is minimally invasive.”

The reason for concern about this aggressive marketing is justified. With increased litigation risks to 
doctors and hospitals, and Intuitive Surgical ready to pass on the blame of adverse surgical outcomes,  
Citron believes that hospitals will soon tone down their marketing language, and more importantly 
require patients to sign informed consent letters that disclose the risks as well as the of robotic surgery. 
 
The aggressive marketing claims are also a topic in upcoming litigation, as they are specifically identified 
in the aforementioned discovery demands. It is stated that part of the discovery will focus on the

Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 28 of 30 
 


So How Does Training Impact Earnings? 
 
Many of the above articles cite a hyperbolic growth rate in Intuitive's highest-volume surgical 
procedures. It should be clear to all that the reason for this is Intuitive's strategic marketing decisions to 
market directly to surgical patients. Then it goes into hospitals and fires off an "arms war" as hospitals 
feel compelled to invest in da Vinci suites in order to compete for patients.  
 
It is Citron's opinion that Intuitive's marketing machine went way off the reservation and kept right on 
going. It has become a victim of its own success.  It is now responsible for hundreds of thousands of 
surgeries performed by unknown numbers of insufficiently trained surgeons, under the cloud of 
inadequate disclosure and unsubstantiated medical claims to patients/consumers and hospitals.   
 
And remember, to date, despite the higher costs, there is an absence of clinical proof of superior 
outcomes for robotic surgeries in the procedures that are Intuitive' Surgical's highest volume 
procedures. 
 
This is a recipe for a train wreck. The hospitals have been lulled into complicity with this witches brew of 
bad medical practice and unsubstantiated medical claims, and the consequences will be far-reaching. 
What the ultimate liability bill will total out to be is anybody's guess, but one of the easiest conclusions 
to arrive at is that: 
 


 Utilization of da Vinci machines for surgeries is going to decline. 


 Sales of new da Vinci units is going to be under pressure. 


 Breakthroughs in new types of robotic surgery are going to be subject to higher 
regulatory bars and much closer scrutiny of marketing claims.  





                                                   
 
Now let's look at the critical forward-looking issue of utilization.  In a traditional sales business, analysts 
turn their attention to pipeline. If a manufacturer "stuffs the channel" by selling more goods to 
distributors than all its customers can absorb, revenues seem healthy…for a while. But eventually those 
unsold goods boomerang and later quarters disappoint. 
 
In the case of Intuitive Surgical, it has already sold over 1,900 robotic surgery machines into US 
hospitals. Its two highest-volume procedures are prostatectomies and hysterectomies, both of which 
are now being overshadowed by negative trends in clinical results:  Prostatectomies not showing better 
outcomes than doing nothing for most cancer types, and hysterectomies not showing better outcomes 
than less expensive and shorter laparotomies. Prostate surgeries are already falling off, and now da Vinci 
is no longer the standard of care for hysterectomy. (In fact, there are a large number of additional 
gynecological procedures affected by the AAGL position paper than just hysterectomies, and it is Citron's 
belief that the position paper is therefore even more adverse to Intuitive than basing it on 40% of its 
total procedure count.)   
 


Utilization:
Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 29 of 30 
 


It is Citron's opinion that either this quarter or next, serious under-utilization will begin to appear in the 
Intuitive's reported results or in the field.  This is going to lead inevitably, albeit with a quarter or two 
delay, to reduced purchases of new systems. After all, if a hospital has three operating units of da Vinci 
systems, and utilization falls to 70%, it's like they have nearly a single machine going unused. That's a lot 
of catching up to do just to get to full capacity.  
 
So falling utilization hits Intuitive's revenues twice:  it weakens revenue for (recurring) per-procedure 
revenues, and it deflates demand for new systems.  
 
So what factors are weighing on  Utilization  : 


 Prostate surgeries – equal or better outcomes for most types, with less side effects, with no 
surgery 


 Hysterectomies – standard laparoscopic surgery is cheaper, shorter, with equivalent or better 
outcome rates 


 Cholectystectomy – (gall bladder removal) – we anticipate hearing a lot from Intuitive about this 
surgery, because their numbers are rising and they have a method for entering through the 
navel.  But the market is not nearly large enough to offset the losses to prostate, hysterectomy 
and other gynecological surgeries for which it is now not the recommended first line option 


 Other gynecologic surgeries – fall under the same AAGP position paper conclusions  


 Obamacare – will reduce or eliminate premium payments for robotic surgeries vs lower cost 
alternatives 


 Injury Lawsuits – will make the bad outcomes more visible to the public, and ultimate load costs 
of adverse outcomes into the cost/benefit equation 


 Marketing – hospitals are going to be removing or toning down their marketing advocacy for 
robotic surgeries as the lawsuits pile up  


 Informed consent – patients' enthusiasm for robotic surgery will dissolve as requirements as 
informed consent and risk acknowledgement becomes standard practice 


 Intuitive is going to start needing its new procedures to take up slack in existing machine 
utilization, rather than selling new units. 


 MAUDE and litigation turn the relationship between Intuitive and hospitals, its best customers, 
adversarial 





                            
 
So what factors are weighing on  New System Purchase  decisionmaking  ? 


 Declining utilization in high volume procedures, leaving existing systems underutilized. Why buy 
new ones when the existing ones are standing idle ?  


 Obamacare – will reduce or eliminate premium payments for robotic surgeries vs lower cost 
alternatives; hospitals will not want to eat the higher costs. 


 Injury Lawsuits – While the first major judgments will hit Intuitive, hospitals will be less eager to 
expose themselves to the increased litigation risk of continuing to commit to more systems 
while existing ones are lawsuit magnets 


 MAUDE adverse events and litigation turn the relationship between Intuitive and hospitals, its 
best customers, increasingly adversarial. This in itself influences the purchasing committees. 


New System Purchase Resistance:
Citron Research Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG)  -- January 17, 2013 Page 30 of 30 
 


 Hospitals inevitably deciding to pull or tone down their overly optimistic and disclosure-deficient 
promotion of robotic surgery.  


 With declines anticipated in two major surgery classifications, and possible increases in one with 
insufficient potential market size to offset the losses, it doesn't seem like the ideal time for 
hospitals to commit to additional multi-million-dollar da Vinci surgical suites  





     
 
It is Citron's opinion that in 2013, the financial pressures of "the law of large numbers" finally catches up 
with Intuitive. With 93% of its procedures in just two categories, both facing headwinds, the company 
will have increasing difficulty compensating for revenue growth shortfalls with new procedures. In at 
least one now-unspecified quarter in 2013, it is Citron's opinion that a revenue disappointment will hit, 
and the company's stock will immediately seek a new multiple – at least 1/3


rd
 below today's lofty price. 


 
The problem at that point is that when a high-growth glam stock disappoints, investors have to decide if 
it’s a one-quarter phenomenon, and the performance will quickly bounce back -- the new low price 
could be just a temporary "buying opportunity". But if there's no immediate catalyst that will change the 
causes of weak growth, the market has to begin the process of re-pricing the future opportunities – at a 
new lower plateau.  
 
 
 


Financial Consequences:
