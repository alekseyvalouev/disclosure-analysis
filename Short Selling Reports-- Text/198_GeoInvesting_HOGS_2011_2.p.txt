17 Reasons Not To Take Chardan's Wavering Opinion On Zhongpin
Seriously
Oct. 12, 2011 6:18 AM ET24 comments
by: The GeoTeam


It is obvious that the issues surrounding Zhongpin (NASDAQ:HOGS) have developed into
a multi-faceted story that can become difficult to digest. That is why we feel it necessary to
peel the HOGS onion one layer at a time so investors can appreciate the breadth and
importance of each layer individually. In this installment we discuss our view of Chardan
Capital’s take on the HOGS story as well as a look at Chardan’s track record in the
ChinaHybrid space.


On September 27, 2011 Chardan Capital quietly downgraded HOGS from Buy to Neutral
and cut HOGS price target to $9.00 from $14.50. The irony of this move is that it was only
on August 9, 2011 that Chardan reiterated its "buy" rating on HOGS as Global Hunter
Securities was being criticized for downgrading the company. Now it seems Chardan has
had second thoughts about its seemingly unquestioned acceptance of whatever story the
HOGS management team spins for the market. Could this be a sign that Chardan's motive
for its initial reiteration of the buy rating was to support the stock?


To illustrate our point, referencing an August 26, 2011 Bloomberg article titled Zhongpin
May Attract Private Equity Takeover Bid, let's look back to what Chardan had to say
later on the same day that HOGS management hosted a conference call to address
issues brought up by various negative research reports:


"We believe the long-term opportunity for consolidation within the Chinese food
processing industry is too attractive for Zhongpin not to attract either a private bid or
investment from an international partner," Tim Tiberio, a New York-based analyst for
Chardan Capital Markets LLC, who has a "buy" rating on the stock, said in a report.


Chardan also stated that:


"Along with exploring business relationships with companies like Tyson Foods Inc.
and Hormel Foods Corp., Changge-based Zhongpin may also be considering
proposals to take the company private," Tiberio said.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/299068-17-reasons-not-to-take-chardans-wavering-opinion-on-zhongpin-seriously 2/10


We believe that Chardan based most, if not all, of its assumptions on an unquestioned
acceptance of comments made by HOGS' management during the conference call in
which management made casual comments regarding its willingness to entertain going
private transactions or pursue international partnerships with leading global players such
as Hormel (NYSE:HRL) and Tyson (NYSE:TSN).


Management's quote from conference call:


"for example such as a Tyson and Hormel foods Zhongpin has been in business relations
with them."


That's not much for even casual investors to hang their hats on, much less an experienced
analyst who should know better than to embellish and play back to the investment
community such empty platitudes. It appears to us that Chardan's analyst simply took
comments made on the conference call out of context and reported them as if HOGS was
in fact in substantial discussions with Hormel and Tyson, and/or was seriously considering
a going private transaction. We understand that Chardan is not exactly neutral in its
analysis of HOGS since it acted as an agent in the company's March 2011 equity offering.
However, we are surprised that Bloomberg ran what appears to be HOGS management's
unsubstantiated comments as a "credible" story.


NEWS FLASH. A member of our team first contacted a Tyson Foods representative in
China. This person commented briefly that he was unaware of any relationship with
Zhongpin, and then referred us to a high ranking associate at Tyson's U.S. headquarter
who was qualified to address our questions. He commented that they "have no formal
working business relationship with Zhongpin.", and they wanted to know more
about HOGS' claims.


Should we repeat this? This is the actual direct quote from the email correspondence with
a U.S. contact from Tyson:


"We have no formal working relationship with Zhongpin. I am not sure how they are
referencing TSN, but would be curious to know. Thanks."

Investors are more than welcome to verify this on their own.


Looking at the situation from Tyson Food’s perspective, even if they are approached by
Zhongpin, the channel checking required to support any relationship with HOGS would no
doubt put them off. Just look at what the investment community has had to endure;
material SAIC vs. SEC filing discrepancies, capex issues, WOFE deception, and multiple
capital raises without solid reasoning, just to name a few. Tyson would certainly be aware
of all of these red flags. Furthermore, having a relationship with Tyson or Hormel would
not validate Zhongpin's claimed profitability. It would just mean that they have some level
of top line operation.


We consider Chardan's action to issue its comments just hours after the completion of the
conference call to be an apparent attempt to support the stock. Chardan's analysts should
examine what "has been in business relations with" really means and how real a possible
going private transaction is. We just can't see how they could have examined such
complete issues so quickly on the same day of the conference call. Once again, it appears
that an analyst is taking statements by a ChineseHybrid's management team at face value
and parroting them back to the investors.


We can’t help but note that on the conference call the Chardan analyst never challenged
HOGS explanation of its SAIC filings and why the profits reported to the SEC were so
much greater than what was reported to local Chinese authorities. In the end isn’t this all
about whether or not HOGS SEC filings are accurate and can be relied upon? Once
again, Chardan and many other investors simply took management's words and
documents at face value and adopted the party line that is most supportive of HOGS's
share price. Chardan is apparently willing to endorse HOGS SAIC commentary and
defense without supportive documentation. As far as we can tell, HOGS management has
not published any of its SAIC information, yet Chardan appears willing to accept HOGS
SAIC explanation without any verifiable documentation.


Further, Chardan has made no attempt to contact the GeoTeam to consider the possibility
that we could offer insight to the SAIC analysis. If they listened to the call closely or had
any knowledge whatsoever regarding SAIC filings or had possession of the filings, as we
have for several months, we believe that Chardan would have to seriously question HOG's
CFO Warren Wang's SAIC net income analysis. Especially since Fuqi International
(OTCPK:FUQI), a company for which they co-managed an equity offering for in 2007, was
accused by some of manipulating SEC margins despite the fact that SAIC revenues were
on par with SEC revenues. Guess what Chardan; all you would have had to do was pull

https://seekingalpha.com/article/299068-17-reasons-not-to-take-chardans-wavering-opinion-on-zhongpin-seriously 4/10


FUQI's SAIC filings and you would have learned that just like HOGS, FUQI's SAIC and
SEC revenues were in line but net income was not (.pdf). This presents as a classic
example of a real company manipulating margins to please investors.


It is troubling that analysts can be so superficial in their work and at times even
incompetent. We suggest that Chardan download the conference call replay, listen to the
boiler plate SAIC discussion about 5 minutes into the call, and give us their interpretation
of the SAIC analysis and why it is valid. They owe this to investors! Did they independently
pull the SAIC filings themselves to verify what was said? If not, we find it hard to embrace
their due diligence. At the very least, If Chardan were to give serious consideration to the
SAIC information we have already provided (See link, page 7) we are confident that
Chardan's experienced analysts could give us their value-added input on documented
material. Or maybe their recent downgrade of HOGS is already testament to their
comprehension of the issues.


Before investors give credibility to Chardan's recommendation on HOGS, including
the new $9.00 target, they should consider Chardan's less than stellar track record, much
of which took place in the SPAC/RTO world. Consider Chardan's role in the following:


1. Formed the SPAC that housed (NASDAQ:APWR), which was halted, delisted and now
trading around $0.30.


2. Served as co-underwriter for a 2007 FUQI public offering. FUQI was delisted for not
being able to file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC since late
2009. Allegations of fraud have surfaced and two auditors resigned. This case is eerily
similar to the HOGS case we developed; real revenues but allegedly fabricated
margins.


3. Formed the SPAC that brought (NASDAQ:SEED) public through a merger with
Chardan's acquisition group, and then proceeded to give SEED a buy rating and $18
price target on May 28, 2010. SEED's CFO recently resigned in July 2011. The stock
recently hit a new low of $2.10 and has been a consistent disappointment to investors.


4. Formed the SPAC that spawned (CABL) which is now CABLF, trading at $0.17 and
voluntarily delisted from NASDAQ on July 18, 2011.


5. Formed SPAC, Chardan 2008 China Acquisition Corp. (originally intended to merge
with a Chinese company, but later chose to merge with a U.S. based mortgage
processing company, symbol (OTC:DJSP) in 2008). DJSP has been delisted and has
class action law suits against it for its connection with robo-signing of foreclosure
documents. The stock currently trades at $0.08.

6. Was involved in the $30 million secondary offering of (NASDAQ:LIWA) in April 2010.
The LIWA story is still unfolding, but has recently been the subject of much debate
between long buyers and short sellers and is currently trading near 52 week lows.


7. Formed the SPAC that housed (AUTC) and raised funds for the company in April
2005. Chardan put a Buy rating on AUTC on 3/25/11, raising its price target from $30
to $40. They terminated coverage on 7/1/11. AUTC was halted for a time and still has
not met its 2010 20F filing deadline. The stock has been delisted and lost nearly half of
its value on September 12, 2011. The company currently trades under $9.00.


8. Was involved in the (NASDAQ:HOLI) (then named HLS Systems International, Ltd.)
IPO and raised equity funds for that company. The stock has tumbled lately amid
allegations of fraud.


9. Raised money for (OTC:AAMA), a stock that now trades at $0.02
10. Served as co-manager for the (NASDAQ:KGJI) January 2011 secondary offering and


the stock plummeted within days of the offering. A director of the company has since
resigned due to his concerns regarding the pricing of the secondary offering. Please
see issues we raised regarding the KGJI story.


11. Served as co-manager of the (OTC:CAVO) October 2010 secondary offering. CAVO
has since been delisted and trades under $1.00.


12. Served as placement agent for the August 2010 (CBBD.OB) private placement. CBBD
now trades at $0.07.


13. Was involved with CNWHF, now a $0.10 stock.
14. Served as co-placement Agent for the January 2010 private placement for BOPH.OB.


We have no information on this company.
15. Formed the SPAC Hambrecht Asia Acquisition Corp. that housed (NASDAQ:SGOC), A


company where our on-the-ground due diligence was not positive.
16. Served as underwriter for the December 2006 (NASDAQ:FFHL) IPO. See fraud


allegations that quickly surfaced on this name.
17. Served as placement agent for HOGS March 2011 equity offering. Will HOGS be the


lone wolf? TBD


Note: much of the information confirming Chardan's involvement with these companies is
readily available on its website. For those of us keeping score on the China front, that's
zero wins, 15 losses and 2 undecided.


Even though the weak market sentiment played a large role in why these stocks
underperformed, the point of this list is that we expect more from investment banks, as
many investors place trust in their due diligence. They should have never brought many of

these companies to US soil. We seriously question Chardan's ability to perform due
diligence in this space and believe investors should follow our lead.


As we said in our original report; we believe HOGS might play the going private game,
one that Chardan is now participating in unwittingly or otherwise. Sure, based on SEC
filings we can see why some Private Equity firms might get roped into such discussions,
but once competent analysts dig into the story and explore HOGS PRC financial filings
they will no doubt find what we have. We feel this closely mirrors the Chardan-backed
FUQI story. FUQI was a real company accused of fabricating margins and exaggerating
profitability, and is now currently delisted!


Disclosure: I am short HOGS, SGOC.


Additional disclosure: Also short HOGS puts. No positions in any other stock
mentioned.

Twilight of the shorts...


A negative article appears, the company does not even respond, and the stock goes up 15%. Looks like the negative
pressure on Chinese RTO's is finally abating.


As to the substance of the argument, it is a much more dangerous sign when the revenues reported to tax authorities
in China and securities supervisor in the U.S. do not match. Net income for tax and accounting purposes is often
diverging even in the U.S. due to peculiarities of tax treatment. This is even more true for Chinese taxes. Without
getting into line items and subsidiary structure and finding specific problems a net income divergence is a minor
question mark at best.

Why did this author not bring up SAT filings? Why only SAIC filings which is simply for business license renewals and
actually not an audited filing? Maybe because this clown is short the stock and once again chooses to misinform the
public on what these filings actually mean. SAIC filings are meaningless in a sense. SAT filings are what needs to
align with SEC filings. Of course all short scumbags can only point to these non audited filings to make a very over

"Why did this author not bring up SAT filings?"


Surely you jest. You know full well why this author did not bring up SAT filings - these records are not
available to the general public. You know this - or at least someone as well versed in the China RTO/SPAC
sector as you claim to be, should know this. So your question seemed either purposefully misleading (most
likely), or uninformed.  
I'm a bit surprised to see you still vociferously defending these highly questionable companies/stocks after
you were so adamant about the validity and wisdom of investing in A-Power.


The fact even Global Hunter Securities downgraded their recommendation on this company should put even
the most casual investor on alert.  
- This is the same firm that failed to realize that some of RINO's (now RINO.PK) contracts were invalid.  
- This is the same firm that supposedly verified the contracts of CCME (now CCME.PK) and supposedly
reviewed the company's bank statements. Prior to CCME's de-listing from NASDAQ, Global Hunters had
twice reiterated their "Buy" recommendation with a target price of $26.

FUQI: "two auditors resigned" - You should say two employees of the auditor resigned! Its auditor has not resigned
since 2009, and SEC has no result on its over one year investigation.

The information I have been able to find regarding Marty Bryan is that he is:


Vice President Poultry Operations Accounting.


So unless he changed positions, not really sure someone in Poultry Accounting would be in a position to accurately
answer the question.

FUQI correction - Chardan did not act as a co-underwriter and FUQI has never changed their auditors much had any
auditor resign, and the SAIC reports pretty much match up. If your going to slam others for incorrect analysis, at least
get yours correct.

Author’s reply »  Seriously? Maybe YOU should review your sources. It may not have been easy for you to
find given your limited patience for simple data-mining, we understand that. But in their Prospectus, dated
October 23, 2007...THEY ARE LISTED AS A CO-UNDERWRITER!!!


Now maybe you can apologize, or should we apologize for using a document procured by (FUQI)
themselves?!


Again, we urge readers not to just obtusely comment before verifying THEIR sources. For goodness sake, we
included the link in our list above!! http://1.usa.gov/piOQ48.

Chardan was not a co-underwriter for FUQI's IPO in '07 and FUQI has never changed their auditor much less had one

This is a great scoreboard analysis of Chardan. A lot of these banks (see Rodman & Renshaw, Roth, Global Hunter
also) are just as corrupt as these companies. Even if they themselves technically have no firsthand knowledge of
fraud, they know they have no idea whether the financials are correct or not... but it doesn't stop them from fleecing
investors... rather than tell their clients that there's a very very HIGH HIGH degree of fraud risk, they pretend to be in-
the-dark and then act shocked when fraud is proven.


A lot of unethical scumbags work for these banks. I wouldn't trust a word from any of those four.
