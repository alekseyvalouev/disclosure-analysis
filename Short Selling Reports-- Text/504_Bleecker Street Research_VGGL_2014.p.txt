Promoted Viggle Is A Short: Why Shares Could Fall Over 60%
Jun. 3, 2014 9:30 AM ET37 comments
by: Bleecker Street Research


Summary


Viggle has been promoted by Small Cap Street, which also promoted PVCT.


Viggle user growth is already slowing, and it is disclosing fewer engagement metrics.


Viggle lost $96 Million in 2012 and lost $92 million in 2013. It will have difficulty
turning this around.


CEO Sillerman's track record with publicly traded companies is poor.


There is currently 40-66% downside in Viggle shares, and it is an attractive short.


Viggle (VGGL) is a name that I have been following for several years after I became
aware of the app in early 2013. The stock has done poorly since its IPO (uplisting) in late
April, however, I believe that the stock is currently an excellent short as the company is
struggling to gain traction with users and the stock has been promoted by several "pump
and dump" newsletters.


Background and Overview


Viggle is a publicly traded media company that recently uplisted to NASDAQ. The
company's history as highlighted in the 2012 10-K


February 7, 2011, Viggle Inc. (formerly Function Inc., Function (X) Inc., and Gateway
Industries, Inc., the "Company") entered into the Agreement and Plan of
Recapitalization (the "Recapitalization Agreement", a copy of which is listed as and
incorporated by reference herewith as Exhibit 10.1) by and among the Company,
Sillerman Investment Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Sillerman"), and EMH Howard LLC, a New York limited liability company ("EMH
Howard").


According to Viggle, the company has the simple business model of "Watch TV, Earn
Rewards." The company provided this chart to show how it works.

The business model is simple, and seems like an interesting idea, but serious questions
about its ability to generate profits and attract users remain. While the business model is
simple, it is also unprofitable. And with signs that user acquisition, a key driver of revenue
growth, is slowing Viggle is left in a very precarious situation.


The Promotion


On Thursday morning the promotion started with several stock promoters sending out
emails, one of which linked to this research report. You can see a list of each promotion
here on StockPromoters.com, a useful source for tracking stock promotion. Here is what
one of the emails looked like.


The email highlighted a low float, insider buying, the experience of CEO Robert F.X.
Fillerman, a deal with DirecTV, and the hot sector with "potential buyout written all over it."
At the end of the email in fine print reads:

That type of language is entirely expected in these type of situations but it is a red flag.
The Small Cap Street name is familiar to me, and not just because I follow the microcap
space closely. On May 21st "The Pump Stopper" published this fine article on Provectus
(PVCT) calling it a short and highlighting numerous issues. When The Pump Stopper
published the article on PVCT it was trading at $2.67 a share, PVCT is now trading at $.72
share after the company's BTD PV-10 application was declined by the FDA. The stock
was halted and opened at around $.30 after the halt. In one section of the article The
Pump Stopper wrote:


PVCT is connected to questionable stock pumpers promoting PVCT including Small-
Cap Street LLC. Multiple stocks covered by Small Cap Street LLC have recently
been halted by the SEC and I believe PVCT could be next to be halted given its
weak disclosures and zero revenue.


Well guess who is promoting Viggle? That's correct, Small Cap Street, LLC.


The SEC has been cracking down on stock promotions recently. As The Pump Stopper
pointed out, several of the stock halted after the SEC cracked down on recent promotions
were associated with Small Cap Street. The Pump Stopper highlights:

1. FusionPharm Inc. - promoted by Paul Lipp's OTCbbjournal.com - HALTED BY
SEC


2. Cannabusiness Group Inc
3. Growlife, Inc. - promoted by Mark Bonacci Paul Lipp's "SmallCapIR" - HALTED

4. Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc
5. Petrotech Oil and Gas, Inc. - promoted by Paul Lipp's "StocksImpossible" -


HALTED BY SEC


Of these 5 that the SEC stepped in and stopped, 3 of them were recently covered by Paul
Lipp's Small Cap Street stock promotion firm.


So we have established that the stock has been promoted by a promoter that has sketchy
ties to several stocks that were halted recently and dropped significantly. Another key
point that the promotions make is highlight CEO and Chairman of Viggle Robert FX
Sillerman. This is Mr. Sillerman.

This is him flicking off a camera after getting off of a flight in Miami. Mr. Sillerman is also
the CEO of publicly traded SFX Entertainment (NASDAQ:SFXE). You might have heard
Mr. Sillerman's name in the news on the Q4 SFXE conference call when he said the
following. Doug Mitchelson, an analyst at Deutsche Bank asked


"And lastly, Bob, I'm not even sort of sure how to ask this question â€¦ we understand
that you're something of a non-traditional CEO, but any comment you want to make
on the gestures you were making? Was that to a specific person or to everybody as
you came out of the plane yesterday? We're just trying to make sure that you're still
sane."


Mr. Sillerman responded by saying:


"Um, well - thank you for referring to me as a non-traditional CEO," Sillerman began,
explaining: "That was a result of an internal, the culmination of an internal
conversation and joke within the company, and while I certainly wasn't crazy about
the fact that it was tweeted out, it's had a very interesting reaction from the uh, music
community down here, (which) has fundamentally said, 'F--- yeah, we get it.'"


But that has little to do with Viggle, other than to highlight that he is an unconventional
CEO. Several of the promotions highlight that Mr. Sillerman has lead many publicly traded
companies. Specifically one promotions reads "CEO Robert F.X. Sillerman has built and
sold companies for billions." While that may be true, I think Viggle shareholders would be
better served to examine his track record at other publicly traded companies that he was
involved with. The original Viggle S-1 highlights some of Mr. Sillerman's past ventures.

Robert F.X. Sillerman was elected a Director of the Company and Executive
Chairman of the Board of Directors effective as of the closing of the Recapitalization.
He has, since January 2008, served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Circle Entertainment Inc. Mr. Sillerman also served as the Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman of CKX from February 2005 until May 2010. From August 2000 to
February 2005, Mr. Sillerman was Chairman of FXM, Inc., a private investment firm.
Mr. Sillerman is the founder and has served as managing member of FXM Asset
Management LLC, the managing member of MJX Asset Management, a company
principally engaged in the management of collateralized loan obligation funds, from
November 2003 through April 2010. Prior to that, Mr. Sillerman served as the
Executive Chairman, a Member of the Office of the Chairman and a director of SFX
Entertainment, Inc., from its formation in December 1997 through its sale to Clear
Channel Communications in August 2000.


While it is clear that Mr. Sillerman has a long track record in the industry, and that he has
generated substantial personal wealth for himself (in 2005 Forbes named him the 375th
richest America, with a net worth of $975 million), shareholders in his publicly traded
companies, however, have not done as well.


SFX Entertainment: Mr. Sillerman is the CEO and Chairman. The company went public in
October 2013 and the IPO priced at $13/ share, closed at $11/ share that day, and
currently trades at $7.30/ share. The stock is down 38% since its debut.


Circle Entertainment Inc. (OTCPK:CEXE): At Circle Entertainment Mr. Sillerman was
named CEO and Chairman in 2008. Circle Entertainment is focused on the development
of location based entertainment business. The company has not generated any revenue
and currently trades at $.03. The stock is down almost 100% since Mr. Sillerman took
over.

CKX, Inc (NASDAQ:CKXE): Mr. Sillerman served as CEO and Chairman from 2005 until
2010 at CKX. CKX was perhaps the most rewarding for shareholders, as it was taken
private around $5/ share in 2010. By that time many shareholders were likely underwater.
The stock traded as high as $30/ share in 2005. (I could not find a chart available for CKX)


There is another publicly traded company that Mr. Sillerman was involved with, although
not on the management level. In 2007 Mr. Sillerman led a group to take Riviera Holdings
private at $27/ share. For whatever reason, the deal did not go through. In July 2010
Riviera Holdings filed for bankruptcy.


Active User Growth is Already Slowing


For a young, high growth company, you want to see sustained user growth. The opposite
is happening at Viggle, as it appears that registered active user growth has already
slowed significantly.

After initially exhibiting strong user growth, that growth has slowed to around 10% on a
QoQ basis rather quickly.


Declining User Engagement


Given that increasing user engagement is one of the key growth strategies for Viggle, an
investor would like to see engagement increasing. Instead it is decreasing rapidly and
Viggle is disclosing less and less key metrics. Here are the user engagement metrics that
they have consistently reported from the quarter ending 6/30/12 (~6 months after the app
launched) to the quarter ending 3/31/2014, when the most recent 10-Q was filed.

As you can see the time spent within the app (red line) has been decreasing steadily since
the launch. MAUs (monthly active users) grew initially but peaked during the summer of
2013. Additionally Viggle initially reported more engagement metrics, but has since
ceased reporting several user engagement metrics that it used to report.


Decreased Disclosure Of Engagement Metrics


Source: Company filings


As you can see above, Viggle no longer reports user engagement metrics such as
Engagements/Day and Average Days Active when they report the user engagement
metrics. While MAUs and Time within app per session are likely enough to gauge that

user engagement is in a downtrend, it does show that Viggle is giving investors less
material to work with to come to that conclusion.


What Do Employees Say?


One good source of information for how a company is doing and treating its employees is
Glassdoor.com. For those of you that do not know, Glassdoor allows employees to
anonymously rank and rate the company that they work at and leave suggestions for how
to improve it. Based on Glassdoor.com ratings, the company gets 3.1 stars on average,
while only 60% of reviewers approve of CEO Robert Sillerman and only 50% would
recommend the company to a friend. While some reviews were positive, there were some
very bad reviews. One employee called it "The worst company of all time," and a "sinking
ship." Others highlighted a lack of trust between engineers and management." Most of the
positive reviews said that there was a smart team in place at Viggle and that it was a good
atmosphere to work in. The negative reviews said that the talented people were leaving
fast and that the product no longer worked well and that the user base was plummeting.

FINRA Has A Scam Meter, So Let's Use It


FINRA has a "Scam Meter" which they provide on their website for free, so I figured I
would run through it from the point of view of someone who received an email from Small
Cap Street promoting Viggle.


Question 1:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2250343-promoted-viggle-is-a-short-why-shares-could-fall-over-60-percent 12/23


It was trading around $5.50 when the email hit. The stock wasn't under $5/ share when
the promotion started as it was a few weeks before, so "None of the above" was the right
answer.


Question #2:


The email from Small Cap Street was not unsolicited, but other promoters' emails could
have been unsolicited.


Question #3:

"Low Float!" "Insider buying by Mr. Sillerman who has bought and sold companies for
billions!" Note: By definition, a low float means that there are not many shares left for the
public to trade. Low float stocks often see rapid price increases, as traders can easily bid
up the shares.


Question #4:


According to the disclosure in the email Small Cap Streetâ€¦

family members are registered investment advisors or registered stock brokers and

damages arising out of or resulting from the use or inability to use this site."


The result of that short quiz was three out of four red flags. Not that this means that Viggle
is a scam, but look at who is promoting it.


Balance Sheet


My Viggle short is not driven by the quality, or lack thereof, of the balance sheet. It is worth
noting that the balance sheet is not particularly strong.


(Source: Company filings)


Viggle only has about $1.4 million in cash on hand; this was before the IPO, however. The
IPO raised $16 million in working capital and "general corporate purposes." (The rest went
to debt repayment, and sales and marketing.)


(Source: Company filings)


Viggle has stated that it will need $13 million to finance its one year vision for the
company. Viggle said:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2250343-promoted-viggle-is-a-short-why-shares-could-fall-over-60-percent 15/23


Our current plan will require capital of approximately $13,000,000 over the next 12-
month period to cover the fixed expenses and capital needs of our company,
including employee payroll, marketing expenditures, server capacity, research and
development, office space and capital expenditures. As of the filing of this
prospectus, we have no availability to draw on our credit lines to fund our operations,
nor do we expect to have any availability subsequent to the offering. Therefore, we
do not plan to rely on debt financing to meet our capital needs for the next 12
months. In order to meet our capital requirements for the next 12 months, we
anticipate that we will need approximately $13,000,000 in new capital (in
excess of the cash currently held by us).


So with the IPO proceeds, Viggle got the $13 million they needed. What they will do next
year or how that money will be used I do not know. Another potential negative is that they
will have to write down some of the Goodwill from acquisitions that they have made. The
large jump in Goodwill stands out as one of the apps they acquired had users, but not
much else.


(Source: Company filings)


Conclusion


If after all of that you are still bullish on Viggle, consider the fact that Viggle has lost $50
million in the last nine months. In 2012 Viggle lost $96 million. In 2013 Viggle lost $91
million. Compare that to its current market cap of around $80 million. It is difficult to value
Viggle considering that it has negative earnings and negative EBITDA and nominal
revenues, but here is my brief attempt. Viggle generated 17.26 million in revenues in the
last 12 months. Given its declining user base I do not expect that number to grow much
over the next 12 months. With a current market cap of $79 million, that puts Viggle's P/S
ratio at 4.59. The average P/S ratio for the S&P 500 is 1.56 while the average P/S ratio for
entertainment stocks is 2.48. My base case has Viggle's multiple rerating to the average of

the entertainment stock, which would have Viggle trading at $3.09, implying 46%
downside. My bear case has Viggle's P/S ratio rerating to the average of 1.56. I think this
is generous considering all the red flags here. In this case a 1.56 P/S ratio would imply a
stock price of $1.95 and 66% downside from current levels.


Note: I have contacted Viggle about my concerns and have not heard back. If I do hear
back from Viggle, I will update this article with any new information.


UPDATE: I spoke to Small Cap Street, and he said that they have never promoted (to
their subscribers and followers), nor had they been paid to promote in any way PVCT,
FSPM, CBGI, CANN, or PHOT. He said that those reports were written by a third-party for
exposure to their brand. (I never suggested otherwise). He also added that they have
never and never will send an unsolicited email. I did suggest that the emails could have
been unsolicited, but other groups have promoted Viggle, those emails could have been
solicited. He also said that they have never told their members that the stock was one of
only a few left, I never implied that he had, simply saying that a stock has a low float
suggests this. He also said that his reports were not recommendations to buy or sell
securities, I never implied anything to the contrary.


Disclosure: I am short VGGL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have
no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.


Editor's Note: This article covers one or more stocks trading at less than $1 per share

amount of cash on hand they had at the start of the quarter.

No need to defend yourself here smallcapstreet. You make money by touting stocks, we make money by
shorting them. Its actually a good system, in a way, we are indebted to you. You bring pump and dumps to our
attention, by pumping them.


The retail investors fooled into buying the stocks you tout are not the ones reading and commenting here. So
don't worry, Bleecker Street Research hasn't affected your already poor reputation with us.

smallcapstreet pumped PVCT and that there have been three SEC halted stocks that were associated with,
or covered by smallcapstreet. I didn't see the original article either.


Nice article btw.

If you've never promoted PVCT, what is this (dated 5 months before your comment)?

The employee feedback alone is all I need to read to know that this is a sinking ship.

This is a manipulation of real data and a poor attempt as well. I am not sure viggle is a company one wants to own,
but at these levels its a pretty good spec. The company stated on last call that this cash will get them to cach flow
postive. Thats pretty good given its history. A new patent. Nice . Stock floated at 8 and is 4.9 now. news will start to
get better and on my opinion so will stock. The huge losses in the past are due to hiring a terrible ceo ( awoman) who
pissed away the money. Bob took control to stem the bleeding and fired the ceo. No comparison to what viggle is
today. Very small float in a potentially explosive new industry could translate into a hot stock. again , today the risk
seems minimal.

Funny to reads these 8 months later when the stock price is at $1.99 a share. Not so stupid after all.

Why aren't they publishing metrics they used to publish? If things are so good, why not brag about it and generate
some investment? All I'm hearing is that this stock is good to speculate on because it has a low float.

Great article, glad someone pointed it out how poor of an investment Viggle is.


As an app I've used it for about a year, it's very glitchy, has poor user reviews and they are constantly making it harder
to earn prizes (more time and points) as they struggle to find profitablilty, but really you can't complain since it's a free
app that awards free gift cards and prizes.


Based on my knowledge, you are correct that they do extensive advertising, I've seen both TV ads and audio ads on
pandora over the last year. That is part of the reason why the SGA expense is so large. This is a classic example of a
company is taking advantage of a hot IPO market and it is the only reason that they were probably able to raise any
public funding at all.


Joe- Please notice that the substantial increase in revenue from 1.7 to 13.9 mil from 2012 to 2013 is mainly a result of
acquisitions (Wetpaint and a few others). Not much of the growth is organic and acquisitions can't be fueled by debt
forever. The IPO was a disaster and was far undersubscriped, but at least the convertible bondholders were able to
salvage some of their money. If I remember correctly shares priced for about $8, about 1/3 of what the bankers tried
to originally price it at (about $24/share) so about double the shares had to be offered to raise the necessary amount
of capital.


If the IPO doesn't warn you enough about the stock just read the S-1 and look at the financials. 14 mil in revenue and
a loss of about 6x that amount at 91 mil for 2013. Additionally ttm loses are about 67 mil, equal to it's current market
cap according to yahoo finance. Another major red flag, liabilities outweigh assets by over 3x as of 2013 creating
negative shareholders equity. The IPO will buy them some time, but not much.  
I have been short VGGL since the moment of its IPO at about $7.23 and later added more at $5.25 once more shares
from my broker became available.

As a trade, I think you already made your money. $VGGL is a $ 2 stock now, so no meat on the bone left!


Like $SHLD has Eddie Lampert, $VGGL has Sillerman, 2 deep pockets. I wish I could give you more
information but the company I last worked was acquired by $VGGL back in June.


You can only make another $ 2 bucks, but give up your hard earned profits. I'd ride it close to earnings and
cover. But that's me...

viggle entering music industry and next may be concerts through sfx. Based on comments Bob sillerman made at a
conference, it seems sfx will use Viggle tech at concerts as well. Imagine giving feedback at the concert and getting
your concert ticket paid for by Viggle? I wonder is Vggl a short or maybe a strong buy?

@MODACAD It's a short, thanks. Anymore questions, don't hesitate to ask.

As a user of Viggle, the main sign of trouble I see is that they don't have enough cash to pay off the vast number of
users who have accumulated points and want to cash them in for rewards but can't because their rewards are out of
stock. This is probably one of the main reasons the engagement keeps dropping. Why bother to use the app and get
points if you can't use them for anything?


09 Jul 2014, 07:00 PM


ParaDiddle
Are these products actually out of stock or do you mean that Viggle just doesn't have them to send to you? If
they don't have the money to purchase the goods they have promised, it sounds like a microcosm of
insolvency.


24 Jul 2014, 04:15 PM


Biotech Beast, Contributor
Yeah, that doesn't sound encouraging. They sound insolvent.

Well that was an excellent call. I still think this stock is a short, below $3, if it breaks that way. Looking at their
performance, they are burning through $36MM in cash a year and have zero cash on balance sheet currently. It
appears they have to keep raising secondaries to keep the lights on.


With average monthly users (653K 6/2014 vs 757K on 6/2013)on Viggle apps decreasing despite almost doubling the
number of resisted users/installs (5,5 MM in 6/2014 vs 3 MM in 6/2013) it tells you that they are paying mightily to
attract users who register but don't stay with it.


84% increase in registered users and 14% decrease in average monthly users in the last 12 months. Ouch. This is a
very expensive non-sticky business model. ...

It's down already 66% from IPO($8.25?) to $ 2.97 today...

SmallCap IR highlighted this share yesterday and it soared.


Just received another email today which reads:


#1 Gainer on the Entire NASDAQ Exchange on day one of our coverage!


Update, our new due diligence Viggle, Inc. (NASDAQ: VGGL) up over 145% at one point yesterday and closed up
over 120%.


Synopsis of day two


Here's why Viggle could sustain through the shakeout that is inevitably coming this AM from market makers and
shorts.


The financials are stronger than Superman:

In May 2014 Ladengurg-Thalman issued a buy recommendation and price target of $12/share:

pagreen: financials are stronger than superman? they had 4.895m in current assets at 9.30 with 37.189m in
current liabilities. Add to that the 30m ceo financing at the end of october and it puts their situation at
34.895vs 37.189m. They have negative working capital still! and need to raise futher capital to be able to pay
their current liabilities

$VGGL like $SHLD has a financial backer. The only difference is $SHLD is a dying dinosaur, and $VGGL is
another technology company struggling to grow profitably.


There's no options on $VGGL, so I'd only trade the long side. It's a clear rollercoaster pattern. The company
is growing but still suffering from excessive expenses through prior acquisitions. The restructuring obviously
started. Let's see if it holds water next year!
