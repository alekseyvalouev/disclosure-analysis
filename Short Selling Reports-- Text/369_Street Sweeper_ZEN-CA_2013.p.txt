Zenyatta: A Story With More Holes Than Its Celebrated Mine?
Sep. 9, 2013 12:53 PM ET22 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Important Notice [Sept. 13, 2013]: TheStreetSweeper has elected to remove the second
story in this series after discovering on Friday morning that the CEO of Zenyatta actually
worked with a different Don Sheldon than the promoter identified in the article. While
TheStreetSweeper continues to stand by the other revelations included in that report,
including the doubts expressed by notable industry experts about the validity of the story
that the company itself has told, we have nevertheless chosen to withdraw the entire
article to address the situation and compensate for this accidental oversight. We regret
this error and apologize for any confusion that it might have caused.


(Editors' Note: This article discusses micro-cap stocks. Please be aware of the risks
associated with these stocks.)


Give Zenyatta Ventures (OTCPK:ZENYF) (TSXV: ZEN.V) credit for this much. While that
highflying junior miner has yet to deliver the most preliminary report that investors need to
even begin judging the value of its celebrated graphite deposit, let alone produce any
concrete evidence that its graphite rivals the best in the world, the company has managed
to establish one thing for sure. As a standout performer in a crowd of junior miners that
have tanked along with the underlying price of graphite - and now sports a hefty $175
million market capitalization that eclipses the market values assigned to a number of its
more advanced rivals combined - Zenyatta has clearly proven that, if nothing else, the
company knows how to sell a tantalizing story.


Granted, by the time that Zenyatta CEO Aubrey Eveleigh launched the company as a
junior miner originally scouting for overlooked copper and nickel deposits, he had already
mastered a similar pitch while steering the exploration program for another Canadian
junior that obediently responded with some rather amazing - if fleeting - gains of its own.
Like Zenyatta itself, MetalCorp (TSXV: MTC.V) (OTC:MTLCF) looked hopelessly stuck in
penny-stock land until the obscure resource player suddenly exploded to record highs
after the company reported that it had basically stumbled upon a valuable discovery by
complete accident. Indeed, with Eveleigh routinely surfacing as the official voice of that
doomed company, MetalCorp literally spent years trumpeting a series of "lucky breaks"
that kept hope alive (and the bleeding miner afloat) long enough to deplete most of its
funds and finally prompt the board to kick the future chief of Zenyatta out of its own
executive suite.

Four years after MetalCorp severed its ties with Eveleigh -- later credited for raising the
mountain of cash that the battered miner spent -- the company now sports a total market
of value of less than $1 million and trades for a mere penny a share.


While initially forced to settle for a similar post at an obscure miner that looked similarly
worthless, Eveleigh soon negotiated a handy deal that would allow him to overcome the
fresh stain on his record (since erased with the helpful passage of time) and provide him
with the material to produce his recent encore. After securing minority rights to some
remote mining claims through a consulting firm that he owns - terminated by wrecked
MetalCorp, along with the executive himself, earlier that same year - Eveleigh
orchestrated a lucrative related-party deal that supplied that discarded asset to a
"numbered" company that could then go public with that swampy land as its flagship
property and the disgraced executive in charge of the entire show.


When Zenyatta filed the official paperwork for its stock offereing the following year, of
course, the company dutifully portrayed Eveleigh as a successful corporate executive with
an impressive background in geology and a proven track record in the mining field.
Notably, however, Zenyatta also referred to Eveleigh as an outright "promoter" throughout
its prospectus and further underscored that disturbing role in a so-called "certificate of the
promoter - signed by the CEO himself - at the end of that crucial document.


To be sure, with Eveleigh overseeing its business and handling its publicity, Zenyatta has
followed a rather familiar path on its amazing journey to record-breaking highs. After
debuting as just another obscure miner and languishing in penny-stock territory for a
couple of years -- providing early investors with little incentive to exercise pricier warrants
that would inject millions into its bank account -- Zenyatta suddenly rushed to capitalize on
its own accidental discovery of a particularly hot resource that had spiked in price to
generate plenty of helpful buzz. With the company trumpeting its graphite deposit as both
extraordinarily rare and extremely valuable, while forecasting massive production rates of
top-quality graphite that commands a steep premium, Zenyatta finally began to gather
steam about a year ago and soon blew right past the former hotshots in its peer group to
emerge with the most breathtaking gains in that fading sector by far.


A stock that fetched as little as 15 cents a share last summer, threatening to render a
mountain of $1 warrants effectively worthless by the end of the year, Zenyatta has since
rocketed all the way to a record high of $5 a share and continues to trade near the top of
that gigantic range. Indeed, even after shedding 25% of its peak value since late July,
Zenyatta still commands more than an entire group of noteworthy competitors - with both
its stock and its overall market cap exceeding those of Northern Graphite (TSVX: NGC.V;

OTC: NGPHF), Focus Graphite (TSVX: FMS.V) (OTCQB:FCSMF), Big North Graphite
(TSVX: NRT.V) (OTCPK:BNCIF) and Alabama Graphite (CN: ALP.CN) (ABGPF)
combined - despite the head-starts that position those miners to enter the market long
before their pricier rival ever gets its own chance.


Since Zenyatta has never presented any documented evidence to validate its claims
about either the abundance or the quality of its graphite deposits -- and still needs to
provide the first in a series of formal reviews that will likely take years to complete -- the
company strikes some of the most prominent veterans in the industry as a worthless
promotion at worst and the riskiest name in the group at the absolute best.


"Zenyatta hasn't done one thing to prove that they have material that can be used in the
applications that they claim," declared Asbury Carbons CEO Stephen Riddle, the fourth-
generation leader of a company that has operated in the graphite space for more than a
century. "Whenever it comes out that whatever they promoted isn't going to work, the
stock will collapse … Personally, I think that they're going to put a big black eye on the
entire industry."


At this point, its own spokesman confessed when TheStreetSweeper directly asked, even
Zenyatta itself has no idea whether its product will actually perform well enough in those
applications to compete against the pricey synthetic graphite that it hopes to replace.
Despite all of the internal purity results that management has trumpeted since announcing
its big discovery a couple of years ago, Zenyatta never even sought to confirm the
potential value of its graphite until a few weeks ago -- after safely restocking its bank
account - when the company finally agreed to release its very first samples to a handful of
end-users and give them a chance to see if it actually works. Zenyatta better hope for
some truly dazzling results, the spokesman indicated, since management practically
counts on a generous buyout offer (or at least an attractive joint-venture deal) to follow
and -- with its own plans limited in both scope and duration to those that it can presently
afford -- provide the company with its most likely vehicle for any future success.


"Remember, this is all speculation," that Zenyatta spokesman bluntly allowed (before
asking to withdraw most of the comments that he shared). "That's why we're getting such
a hefty market cap. Investors think that we have a good chance.


"We want to make sure that we know that for ourselves," he added. "You really don't know
that it's validated until the product is sold ... If you owned this (stock), you would know it
works when somebody makes a bid to buy your company."

With that interview only furthering the convictions already reached by conducting the
extensive research for this detailed article (the first in a three-part series),
TheStreetSweeper placed a confident bet against Zenyatta that will allow it to profit if that
bloated stock indeed undergoes the sharp correction that so many expect. At the same
time, however, TheStreetSweeper actually felt tempted enough by a select group of rivals
in that risky space to take its chances on a few speculative names for a change. Executing
its first so-called "pair trade" in history, TheStreetSweeper has chosen to not only short
Zenyatta itself but also buy stock in three competitors that it regards as compelling
alternatives -- Alabama Graphite, Big North Graphite and Northern Graphite -- since they
look almost safe in comparison and seem like an outright steal, selling for a combined
total of barely a buck a share, besides.


Trampled by Underdogs


Although Zenyatta has spent close to three full years trading on the public stock
exchange, while touting its graphite deposit throughout much of that period, the company
just retained an independent firm this summer to prepare a standard NI 43-101 resource
report that will merely serve as a general overview of its celebrated mining project. In
contrast, despite its status as a relative newcomer that arrived on the scene barely a year
ago, Alabama Graphite managed to complete its own 43-101 study by this summer and
just released the formal report -- a critical document for junior miners seeking to establish
credibility - less than two weeks ago. By capitalizing on the favorable regulatory
environment in its home base of Alabama, in fact, the company expects to fly through the
entire process with remarkable speed and launch actual production in late 2015 as the
only domestic supplier of graphite in the entire country.


With Alabama Graphite focusing all of its attention on advancing its project and waiting for
any publicity about its progress to naturally follow, however, the young junior miner has
largely flown under the radar up to now. Even after its stock suddenly doubled last month
ahead of the looming publication of its official 43-101 report -- a crucial milestone that
could finally prompt analysts to start taking notice -- Alabama still trades for barely a
quarter a share. At that level, Alabama features a total market capitalization of $10 million
that pales in comparison to the value represented by a recent gain that Zenyatta itself
recorded in a single day.


"We're not very promotional," Alabama Graphite Vice President of Exploration Douglas
Oliver practically apologized during a recent interview (prominently featured in an
upcoming story) that sold TheStreetSweeper on the company as its favorite pick in the

entire group. "We're trying to show that we're actually serious about doing the work, with
the real intention of advancing this project.


"Once our 43-101 report is published," he said just ahead of its release, "analysts can
read it and see what our plans are. They'll see that we're serious and that our primary goal
is not to make a bunch of money … We're not interested in just doing a stock promotion."


While Zenyatta has managed to stage a tremendous rally without any help from a 43-101
report of its own, the company has also remained completely neglected by professional
analysts who prefer to wait around for that sort of evidence. Indeed, even though a
Zenyatta director actually serves as vice chairman of its mining group, Mackie Research
has not only ignored the remarkable winner but also treated a popular rival as its favorite
graphite miner instead.


Mackie began recommending Northern Graphite as a "very unique resource development
opportunity" two full years ago, back when overlooked Zenyatta still languished deep in
penny-stock territory at just 30 cents a share, and has followed up with even stronger
endorsements of the graphite miner in the string of bullish reports that it has issued on the
company since that time. Notably, in one of its most glowing reports on Northern to date
(published right after the company landed an attractive financing deal with giant Caterpillar
earlier this year), Mackie actually based its growing confidence in the junior minor on
several key advantages that Zenyatta itself obviously lacks.


"NGC continues to offer investors leading exposure in the graphite space, as its advanced
status will allow it to beat almost every other junior graphite company to production,"
Mackie gushed at the time. "The most advanced and transparent graphite play, NGC is
the only junior graphite (miner) that we know of with a 43-101-compliant bankable
feasibility study.


"Given the many inherent advantages that NGC has to the other graphite companies -
including a favorable location, more advanced development and engineering progress,
greater large flake and purities - we view NGC's approximate 20% discount on an
enterprise value/total resources basis as too wide," Mackie decided, without even
bothering to throw rising Zenyatta into that equation. "While we view Northern Graphite's
relative valuation as offering the most attractive value in the space and are most
impressed with the leading progress the company has made in terms of milestones and
providing investors with transparency on various aspects of its project, there are several
remaining catalysts on the horizon. (Thus), we maintain our speculative buy rating and
increase our target price on the company."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1681652-zenyatta-a-story-with-more-holes-than-its-celebrated-mine 6/20


Far from alone, Mackey simply ranks as perhaps the most notable in a crowd of research
firms that have basically snubbed Zenyatta and warmly embraced its nearby competitor
instead. Shortly after Northern cleared an important hurdle by completing its bankable
feasibility study last summer, for example, Union Securities confidently predicted that the
company would soon become "the leading graphite producer" in the very Canadian
province where Zenyatta itself operates. When Northern spiraled well below $1 a share on
eroding graphite prices in the months that followed, Industrial Alliance Securities then
stepped forward to respond with an even bolder call of its own.


"NGC looks better than ever," the firm declared. Currently "trading at its 52-week low,
NGC should be on the top of the list of every investor looking at graphite. Based on that,
we reiterate our 12-month target price of $2.45 (calling for the stock to literally triple within
a year) and our speculative buy rating" on the shares.


Zenyatta obviously needs more than a sexy story and a pretty stock chart to impress
mining experts who follow the graphite space. By staging such a dramatic rally, in fact,
Zenyatta has started to raise some eyebrows while its far cheaper rivals have managed to
keep on turning heads instead.


Take Big North Graphite, for example, a junior miner valued at less than $3 million, even
though it has already launched actual production - a unique distinction that automatically
sets it apart from the crowd - and recently followed up by completing its first official
graphite sale. Despite that paltry valuation and the meager price of its stock, currently
stuck below a dime a share, Big North has managed to catch the attention of at least two
industry experts who basically just shunned Zenyatta itself.


The data manager for Industrial Minerals, a key source of market intelligence for the
mining industry, Simon Moores recently pointed to Big North as one of the few "serious"
players in a graphite sector crowded with juniors simply "riding the resource wave"
Although he included several other companies in that select group - including Northern
Graphite, Focus Graphite and Energizer Resources (Toronto: EGZ.TO; OTC: ENZR) -
Moores skipped right past Zenyatta itself whenever he presented his exclusive list.


Big North actually scored an even more coveted endorsement just few days earlier, when
the neglected miner found itself singled out by the former manager of a multibillion-dollar
hedge fund who has since made a name for himself by discovering future winners in the
mining space. Now an independent analyst who specializes in hunting down bargains in

the resource sector, Peter Epstein predicted that Big North "could really take off once
meaningful production begins" and effectively presented that graphite miner as his favorite
pick in a popular niche crowded with a vast selection of names.


In fairness, since Epstein deliberately tries to avoid risky highfliers that have already
racked up enormous gains, Zenyatta itself never stood a chance of winning that contest,
anyway.


"Peter Epstein, independent analyst and founder of MockingJay Inc., argues that market
darlings won't reward latecomers," The Energy Report noted this summer, when
introducing the respected expert and the overlooked stocks that he favored instead.
"That's why he spends his time finding undervalued, underfollowed junior resource
companies. (After all), big gains are rarely found by jumping on the bandwagon."


The Growth Spurt of a Giant Runt


Regardless, with the help of an aggressive publicity campaign and bullish "research
coverage" from a promotional newsletter that spent more than a year pushing the stock as
a great bargain right through the staggering surge in its price, Zenyatta has managed to
draw speculative investors to its swollen stock with the force of a powerful magnet.
Arguably priced beyond perfection at current levels -- with its lofty valuation reflecting
outsized promise but limited risk (at best) -- Zenyatta could easily lose its appeal,
however, once those investors take a closer look at the well-timed rally that transformed
its stock into such an amazing winner in the first place.


Go back in time a few years for some telling clues. Before Zenyatta carried out its initial
public offering in late 2010, the company issued a huge pile of warrants that would allow
early investors to purchase 11.74 million shares of its stock at $1 a share within two years
of its official debut on a public stock exchange. Zenyatta spent most of that period actually
trading well below its original IPO price of 60 cents a share, however, with its stock never
once touching (and rarely even approaching) the $1 mark ahead of that crucial deadline.


Since Zenyatta had obviously banked on the proceeds from those warrants to replenish its
dwindling bank account, however, the company simply bought itself an extra six months
by rushing to postpone that looming deadline. Thanks to that convenient adjustment, a
last-minute concession presented by management just weeks in advance and apparently
approved by regulators with little (if any) time to spare, Zenyatta managed to prevent all of
those warrants from expiring essentially worthless and depriving the company of a handy
source of cash.

5/23/2018 Zenyatta: A Story With More Holes Than Its Celebrated Mine? - Zenyatta Ventures Ltd (OTCMKTS:ZENYF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1681652-zenyatta-a-story-with-more-holes-than-its-celebrated-mine 8/20


Even after dramatically expanding its publicity budget and successfully boosting its share
price toward the high end of its historical range, after all, Zenyatta still traded at a 23%
discount to the price of its warrants when that original deadline swiftly arrived. With
Zenyatta selling at a price considerably below the price of outstanding warrants
exercisable into its far cheaper shares -- basically guaranteeing an automatic haircut
rather than promising any immediate gains -- the company would have risked its shot at
an easy fortune that it clearly needed, given its modest cash balance, by honoring the
inconvenient schedule that it had previously arranged.


Thanks to the flexible nature of its rules and its casual approach to changing them,
however, Zenyatta managed to escape a potential disaster that could have literally
wrecked the company and would have certainly crushed both its stock price and any hope
for the breakout that eventually followed. In a lucky reversal of fortune, however, Zenyatta
instead found itself blessed with a wonderful second chance. Taking full advantage of that
fresh opportunity, Zenyatta soon launched a major publicity campaign that would allow the
company to both heighten its exposure and intensify its gains.


With its budget for investor relations and stock promotion already doubling over the course
of the previous year (even as its investments in actual exploration zoomed in the opposite
direction), Zenyatta decided to further splurge by hiring a professional I.R. firm to
orchestrate its "aggressive" publicity drive, shelling out thousands of dollars a month --
and throwing in a handsome pile of stock options to really sweeten the deal -- as a reward
for those valuable services. Clearly eager to capitalize on that expert guidance, Zenyatta
soon followed up by issuing a string of rosy updates (dramatically halting its stock for
several of those announcements) that finally ignited a powerful rally in its shares.


After spending its first two years as a listless penny stock that largely traded at a steep
discount to its warrant price (and sometimes never traded at all), Zenyatta managed to
rapidly transform itself into a miraculous highflier bursting with urgent momentum by the
time that handy extension period came to an end. A stock that fetched just 77 cents a
share six months earlier, Zenyatta had rocketed all the way to $2.50 a share since that
time - magically tripling the value of the company -- to provide early investors with a
lucrative opportunity too compelling to ignore. They pounced, of course, happy to pay
Zenyatta a mere buck for stock that fetched 2.5 times that amount on the open market,
and effectively freed the stock to soar even higher still. With the weighty threat of dilution
lifted from its shares by the $12.6 million that suddenly flooded into its bank account --
providing the company with an even larger war chest than the $10 million that it had
actually raised through its official IPO (and largely depleted since that time) -- Zenyatta

5/23/2018 Zenyatta: A Story With More Holes Than Its Celebrated Mine? - Zenyatta Ventures Ltd (OTCMKTS:ZENYF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1681652-zenyatta-a-story-with-more-holes-than-its-celebrated-mine 9/20


instantly blasted to a new series of record-breaking highs, briefly reaching the $5 mark at
its peak, on a fresh burst of momentum strong enough to resist the natural forces of
gravity.


Zenyatta managed to stage that breathtaking rally without a single recommendation from
the Canadian analysts who actually specialize in following junior miners, too. Instead,
Zenyatta has so far relied on an American firm with a long history of embracing all sorts of
risky stocks -- and hired by the miner to accommodate the U.S. investors that it hoped to
attract by listing its shares on a glorified version of the OTC penny-stock exchange -- for
the only coverage that it has garnered from a mainstream analyst to this day.


Despite that overwhelming silence, however, Zenyatta has enjoyed some powerful bursts
of applause from at least one rather vocal fan. Throughout its breathtaking rally, Zenyatta
attracted routine praise from a promotional newsletter that started gushing about the
obscure miner as a lowly penny stock and -- "pounding the table" for investors to buy
more whenever the stock came under pressure -- kept right on pushing the company (in
some rather well-timed endorsements) as a loyal, if lonely, cheerleader for more than a
year.


After first "discovering" Zenyatta back in March of 2012 -- the very month that the
company happened to launch its expensive publicity campaign -- the Gold Investment
Letter repeatedly urged investors to buy the stock as its rich premium steepened and, with
the extended deadline on those warrants suddenly looming, practically ridiculed those who
chose to book their handsome gains by selling the pricey shares instead.


"I believe most investors want to lose money and act accordingly," the newsletter taunted
after Zenyatta reversed course, slipping below the $2 mark, just weeks before that tower
of warrants would expire under the extended deadline. "Don't believe me? Well, you would
be shocked to learn how many people 'had' to sell Zenyatta and take profits just because
it went up!


"Some people can't handle making massive amounts of money," the tout sheet further
needled. "Well, what can I say? People are free to do what they wish! But I hope most of
you have held and/or bought more before the next leg up occurs. (Zenyatta) has
been/remains our top pick."


While clearly aimed at gullible retail investors instead, that newsletter theoretically
managed to scold the most prominent Zenyatta shareholder of all when it delivered that
condescending lecture. After inheriting a massive stake in Zenyatta by supplying the
company with its flagship property -- and then spending the next two years parked on

5/23/2018 Zenyatta: A Story With More Holes Than Its Celebrated Mine? - Zenyatta Ventures Ltd (OTCMKTS:ZENYF) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1681652-zenyatta-a-story-with-more-holes-than-its-celebrated-mine 10/20


millions of warrants for stock that sold at far cheaper prices on the open market -- Cliffs
Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) jumped at the chance to finally "monetize" a big chunk of
that investment once the opportunity presented itself. In a private transaction just halfway
through the six-month extension period, with Zenyatta barely topping the $2 mark and
fighting just to stay there, Cliffs quietly sold almost half of its gigantic stash of warrants --
representing the equivalent of 3% of the entire company -- priced at $1.50 a share,
content to safely book the difference as surefire profits, instead of holding out for the
possibility of even more generous gains that would in fact materialize.


While Zenyatta actually drifted lower in the two months that followed, the stock rebounded
nicely after the Gold Investment Letter blasted cautious investors for selling the shares
and -- with all of those warrants set to expire just five weeks later -- urged speculative
traders to buy even more. Suddenly regaining its energy, Zenyatta soon marched right
past its former highs to record a 40% gain by the time that crucial deadline arrived. Eager
to celebrate that rapid turn of events, Zenyatta proudly announced that its early investors
had (understandably) exercised all of their warrants and provided the company with
enough cash to cover its expenses "for the foreseeable future without a need for a capital
raise."


In a rather striking coincidence, the Gold Investment Letter had just promised to deliver
another big winner - introduced as the "new Zenyatta" a few days earlier -- after somehow
managing to "discover" yet another junior miner that suddenly looked like a great bargain
with its own mountain of warrants set to expire. An obscure company with a total market
value of just $11.5 million at the time, Medallion Resources (TSVX: MDL.V)
(OTCPK:MLLOF) had by then labored for more than a year just to claw its way to a
measly quarter a share, simply matching the price tag on its warrants, but still needed to
cover plenty of ground - and at record speed - in order to actually deliver any decent
upside. Rising to meet that formidable challenge with a sudden burst of determined
energy that it clearly lacked ahead of that last-minute rescue, Medallion plowed its way
high enough to achieve a 30% gain that convinced investors to exercise their warrants
and replenish its own bank account as well.


Even though its bullish calls on Zenyatta and (to a lesser extent) Medallion might look
impressive at the moment, the Gold Investment Letter issued at least one noteworthy
prediction that has so far fallen just shy of proving dead wrong. While the newsletter
assured its followers that it would probably not remain a "lone voice in the wilderness
much longer" when it issued a glowing report on Zenyatta early this year (actually
identifying the company as a "sponsor" of its publication on that particular occasion), the

tout sheet still sounds more like a soloist - accompanied by a single backup vocalist and
the deafening sound of silence - than the inaugural member of any group even remotely
close to the size of an actual choir. Indeed, with its own loud endorsements of the junior
miner apparently fading in recent months from full-blown reports to occasional tweets,
even that vocal Zenyatta bull has toned down the volume when singing its praises of the
company.


The last time that the Gold Investment Letter publicized Zenyatta on its actual website, in
fact, it actually linked to a Bloomberg article packed with questions from skeptical analysts
who clearly plan to remain on the sidelines until the highflying miner can produce
documented evidence to back up its claims and -- after rocketing 1,500% in the past year
alone - find a credible way to justify its steep valuation by finally proving itself for a
change.


Once Bitten, Twice Shy


Until Zenyatta establishes that sort of credibility, those probing questions suggest, the
company will likely remained snubbed by professional analysts who generally limit their
coverage to junior miners with verified resources and recognize the chances that they
would take - and the disasters that could unfold -- if they bend those rules.


Look what happened to Mackie Research Vice Chairman Barry Allan, a veteran mining
analyst who serves on the Zenyatta board, when he relaxed his own standards by falling
in love with a notorious junior miner that exploded into a multibillion-dollar company based
on bogus hype and powerful momentum alone. A former penny stock that rocketed all the
way into triple-digit territory, Bre-X managed to fool Allan and other gullible analysts by
claiming that it had discovered the largest gold deposit in the world -- with the future
Zenyatta director characterizing a visit to that celebrated mine as a religious experience
that practically allowed him to "see God" - even though the company never provided a
shred of concrete evidence to support that fairy tale. When Bre-X ultimately collapsed,
exposed as the biggest gold-mining fraud in history, Allan openly portrayed his own
coverage of the company as careless and pledged to exercise far more caution when
analyzing junior miners on down the road.


"Analysts got slapped in the face," Allan confessed to The Globe and Mail at the time,
clearly including himself in that humbled group, as Bre-X raced toward oblivion. "This
forces them to sit back down in a chair and say, 'What are the basics here, and did I get
carried away here? Did I do my homework? That is a very useful process."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1681652-zenyatta-a-story-with-more-holes-than-its-celebrated-mine 12/20


While that infamous miner blew up more than a decade-and-a-half ago, long enough (by
Wall Street standards) for even a total fiasco to fade away as ancient history, Allan sure
acts as if he keenly remembers the lessons that he learned from that disaster and the
precautions that he promised to take in an effort to prevent similar catastrophes. After all,
despite his status as a Zenyatta director with a major financial interest in the company
(unless he totally cashed out), Allan has exercised just as much patience as his fellow
analysts - without millions at stake - by waiting years for the junior miner to provide the
kind of documentation necessary to even decide on a proper judgment call.


Of course, Zenyatta might wind up missing the silent treatment, if those analysts reach the
same harsh conclusions as those arrived at by some noteworthy mining experts who have
taken a close look at the company and already made up their minds. A respected industry
veteran with decades of experience as both a professional geologist and a junior mining
analyst, the "Mercenary Geologist" Mickey Fulp delivered such a disturbing assessment of
Zenyatta this June - when he openly challenged the very claims that make the graphite
miner look special in the first place - that he created a big enough stir to prompt a direct
rebuttal from the CEO two weeks later in a clear act of damage control.


With Zenyatta basically trumpeting its graphite discovery as a far grander version of the
extremely rare and valuable "vein" deposit found in a single Sri Lanka mine, Fulp
countered by exposing a major distinction between the two properties that threatened to
destroy that popular comparison. While Zenyatta has always bragged about its discovery
of a treasured vein deposit, inherently blessed with ultra-high purity, Fulp responded by
simply presenting the modest 5% purity rate of the actual graphite drilled from that mine -
and contrasting it with the 90%-plus purity rate of the graphite produced by the famous
vein deposit in Sri Lanka - as compelling evidence to the contrary. Even though Zenyatta
prefers to focus on the 99% purity rate that it can deliver by processing its graphite, Fulp
noted that other companies (including Northern Graphite) have already mastered that trick
and shrugged off the achievement as virtually routine.


After discounting the key distinctions that Zenyatta presents to make its graphite deposit
look so rare and valuable, Fulp then proceeded to highlight some pesky hurdles that the
company prefers to ignore. Although Zenyatta has casually assured the market that it will
enjoy ready access to outstanding infrastructure when it actually develops its celebrated
graphite project, Fulp merely recited the mileage that will separate the company from the
nearest highways and power sources to establish the remote nature of that swampy
mining property.

Openly suspicious of Zenyatta and clearly leery of its highflying stock, Fulp then
concluded his blunt review of the company with an outright warning.


"I really question what is going on in the market," he said. "Personally, I would not invest in
a graphite play that has those characteristics. I think that people should be really cautious
with that company right now."

Ahh just another sour grapes Flaker! What amazes me is you want to come across as if you know what you are
talking about. Then you reference other "pro's in the industry" who are now underwater in their "flake stocks". Yet not
once did you mention that Zenyatta;s Graphite is Lump or Hydrothermal? Why is that? Sorta ruins the peer thing
doesn;t it? 
Zenyatta has no peers. All the other stocks you have described above are Flake Graphite stocks. You avoided
mentioning, that they only way ANY of the stocks you pick can get to Zenyatta purity levels is to produce "spherical"
which initself causes a minimum of 40% wastage to as high as 500% wastage totally depending on how the process
you use to clean it. It also tends to round the edges of the flakes hence "spherical which destroys some of the

characteristics of the finished product. You also failed to mention that none of these guys can produce at commercial
levels. Sorta forgot that eh?  
This has to be the WORST research paper I have seen on any Graphite stocks period. You assume that Flake and
Lump are "equal" which they are not, NOT EVEN CLOSE! You refer to Fulp who at the best of times can only promote
his own bevy of failing flakers because he is PAID $4K a month by those same flakers to promote them. He can't even
figure out what ZEN has because he has not been greased with $4K a month. I am sure if he lost his $16K monthly
fees on the 4 Flake graphite stocks tomorrow and ZEN were to slip him $4K he would suddenly see clearly the
amazing qualities of this hydrothermal graphite.


Really I am amazed how many people want ZEN to die because their stocks are RIGHTFULLY dead. When ZEN and
about 4 stocks on the entire VSE are the only ones keeping that market alive.


As far as Aubreys background. I would suggest if you look at 90% of the CEOs on the VSE, they have past failures in
their lifetimes as well. You really do not understand Speculative Investing do you?


Street Sweeper change your name to Flaker!


Thanks for the assisted pull back in the stock, I will be buying more. What a flake! Honestly, you really do not know
what you are talking about do you?


Why not mention that there is more flake graphite on the planet being exploited as we speak, then the world needs for
the next 100 years? Why not mention that there are at least 150-200 companies with flake deposits that "all could be
cleaned to the same level as your 3 Flakers" picks? Why not mention that there is only one functional
Vein/Lump/Hydrothermal Graphite mine in the world and if ZENs does become a mine it will be THE LARGEST IN
THE WORLD and have multiples of production over the only other mine... Sorta ruins your story doesn't it....... 3 out of
200 or 1 out of 2.. NO THANKS buddy, I will stick with ZEN.


DUH, really????? "TheStreetSweeper established a short position in Zenyatta ahead of this report and stands to
profit on any future declines in its share price. "

Just terrible research, thats all this is, and oh by the way I am short added to the end.  
I think I will start writing about his 3 picks. Its easy enough to do. Petri Dish spherical is not the same as a commercial
production. 30% loss? Well at production that could be a 60% loss. Now can his 43-101 be of any use? No way. So
these two faced people speak out of both sides of their mouths. 43-101 is good for nothing more then $1000-$1500
graphite. Talk about $8000 graphite and the 43-101 isn't worth the paper its written on. Fulp and this turkey won't
mention that because Fulp won't get his $4K a month to promo any more!! Makes me sick what these people do to a
good stock then promo their turd losers at the sametime.

Let me say first that I don’t like the tone of this article. It seems to me to be a blatant attempt to destroy the stock to
benefit from a short position, I am surprised that SA published it. However, Zenyatta is an easy target, it has nowhere
to go except down.

Do your own due diligence folks.


I did my own due diligence on Zenyatta and this is what I concluded:


1. The highly disseminated graphite deposit at Albany, which grades about 5% is nothing like the Sri Lankan
lump/vein deposits which typically grade over 90% in situ. 
2. The terms lump, flake and amorphous are used in the industry to delineate the particle size of the product. The
Zenyatta deposit contains flake and amorphous graphite in unspecified proportions – it can never be extracted and
sold as lump graphite like the graphite from Sri Lanaka. 
3. Synthetic and natural graphite are two different materials which only compete in a very small sector of the market.
Except for the Li-ion battery, there is no significant market where natural graphite could replace synthetic 
4. Li-ion battery graphite requires high purity, and also a specific particle size and shape. Modifying the particle shape
(spheroidization) of natural graphite incurs losses of 30 to 70% of the original material. I was quoted $2650/tonne by a
company in China, for spheroidized natural battery grade graphite, which implies a value of less than $1800 for the
raw material before spheroidization. However, prices do vary a lot.  
5. There are several companies which claim to be able to produce battery grade graphite at a relatively low cost
including Energizer and Northern. There is nothing unique about the Zenyatta graphite deposit, their claim to be able
to produce the required purity with only caustic bake (versus the more traditional caustic leach followed by acid leach)
is unlikely to result is sufficient savings to justify the higher company valuation. 
6. The graphite pricing assumptions made by people such as Trading Chief are wildly speculative and have no basis
in reality.


I concluded that Zenyatta is grossly overpriced relative to other graphite companies which have much higher grade
deposits, which are closer to the surface and easier to mine. I reached this conclusion after many hours of reading on
this subject, and after discussing these issues with a colleague who is regarded as one of the world leading experts
on graphite processing.


I can’t agree with the author’s recommendation of Alabama Graphite. The NI43-101 issued Sep 06 is only a resource
estimate. It contains no realistic economic data, and the assumptions on operating costs look very low compared to
those published in PEAs by the four companies who have reached that stage of development. I don’t see how
Alabama Graphite can be competitive with a 2.6% head grade when companies like Energizer (8.5%) and Mason
(27%) will be mining much higher grades.


Northern is further advanced than the others, and has a very high proportion of high value large flake, with virtually no
low value amorphous graphite. Even so, the economics of mining a 2% head grade are marginal at today’s graphite
prices, and I consider the company fully valued.


Of the four companies who have produced PEAs, my own preferences are Mason and Energizer. I have published an
evaluation on my blog (the companies are too small to qualify for publication on Seeking Alpha).


http://seekingalpha.co...


I also like Canada Carbons, but for different reasons. I think some of their deposit may be high enough grade to be
mined and shipped for processing, without the need to build a mill and flotation plant on site. They could therefore
become cash flow positive without diluting the existing shareholders.

I believe the electric car market will grow, and if graphite remains the material of choice for the anodes of the Li-ion
battery, there is a good chance that one or more of the junior graphite plays will produce big returns. However, don't
bet the house on any of these graphite plays. They are all high risk junior miners. Many of them will fail

"2. The terms lump, flake and amorphous are used in the industry to delineate the particle size of the product.

extracted and sold as lump graphite like the graphite from Sri Lanaka."


I think you ignored the vein/hydrothermal type of graphite, this is exactly what makes the deposit unique. It is
correct average grade is much lower than for example at Bogala, but nevertheless the hydrothermal type
seems one of a kind, and can be processed into high purity at much better rates and lower costs than
conventional flake and amorphous graphite. At least this is my understanding of this story, but I am no
geologist with a specialty in graphite.


I consider the award they received as some sort of recognition, would the TSX and NWOPA make fools out of
themselves handing this to ZEN without some sort of verification? The lab results of Lakefield prove this
graphite is indeed something special. However, we do need an NI43-101 and even more a PEA to see how
commercially viable this deposit really is.


I didn't know of the background of Eveleigh, I don't consider this very positive information. It could be the
research firms didn't pick up the story because of his history, who knows. But even if he is in fact dubious and
knows how to pump and dump, he could have hit something big by accident, no one knows for sure yet.


As far as the author of this article is concerned, the links provided by for example Bssmith are very clear. I
know Fulp as one of the worst newsletterwriters as it comes to objectivity, he exaggerates everything about
the companies that pay him, and degrades the ones that compete with these companies. No one should pay
attention to this "analyst" or "geologist". My advise: Brent Cook.

Anyone reading this report released by TheStreetSweeper.org today needs to understand who is behind this site and
libelous claims against Zenyatta Ventures.


Back in January, 2012 TheStreetSweeper released a report on Questcor Pharmecuticals QCOR written by no other
than Melissa Davis. The full report can be found here.

QCOR quickly responded to this fact-less report by issuing this statement:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1681652-zenyatta-a-story-with-more-holes-than-its-celebrated-mine 18/20


On January 9 Questcor Pharmaceuticals received a communication from an individual representing herself to be
associated with a website identified as StreetSweeper.org. The individual requested that the company provide
responses to a series of questions about the company by January 10. Due to management’s schedule, the individual
was offered an opportunity to have the questions answered by management on Monday, January 16. Questcor has
been unable to determine the exact nature of StreetSweeper.org, its ownership structure, or its revenue sources. The
website, thestreetsweeper.org, provides no information on these topics, and standard listings about it are limited and
opaque. Based on our examination to date, we believe that the website lists people that it claims are associated with
it, one of whom the website and media reports identify as a felon who pled guilty to two conspiracy charges and who
later pled guilty to racketeering charges related to stock manipulation, another of whom has the same name as an
individual who, according to media reports, was arrested recently for kidnapping and extortion, and another of whom
has the same name as an individual who, according to media reports, has been involved in extensive litigation
regarding fraud, defamation, and slander."


It's important to note that QCOR's stock price has hit all-time highs just two weeks ago.

Melissa neglected to mention that Eveleigh was not the President or CEO of the company. He was contracted as an
external geologist and then promoted to VP Exploration and COO.


The company executed several follow up drill programs on the property mentioned and did not find an economical
deposit to develop. That does not mean that the discovery of platinum on the property was not unique and promising
at the time.


The company also executed several other drill programs while Eveleigh was their geologist and again did not find
economical deposits to develop. This is the norm in mining exploration.


The company ran out of funds and Eveleigh's contract expired.


The company then underwent a management shuffle and insourced their exploration activities.

The Critical Investor, Marketplace Contributor
Why is this article not removed just like the other one about Zenyatta? This one caused the drop on 9/9/2013, based
on a bunch of subjective quotes. Quoting Stephen Riddle (what's in a name, CEO of a graphite processing and
supplying business which could lose a lot of marketshare would Zenyatta be able to process very high purity graphite
like them but much cheaper, being market leader at the moment in the USA if I am not mistaken) and Mickey Fulp, a
"respected industry veteran" (unfortunately not respected by a lot of people in the industry at all) who does nothing but
exaggerating the merits of his sponsors and downplaying their direct competitors in a very dubious manner, to me it is
surprising how many people payed attention to this "analysis" and sold their shares.


But this only shows how speculative and vulnerable this stock is, and as a matter of fact a lot has to be proved yet,
but it still very well could play out as a successful graphite junior. Nothing is certain before a NI43-101 and PEA is
released, anyone who declares different has no authority whatsoever to do so because there simply is not enough
information.
