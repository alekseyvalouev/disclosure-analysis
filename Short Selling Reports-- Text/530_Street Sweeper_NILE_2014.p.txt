Blue Nile: Breaking Hearts - And Share Value
Nov. 20, 2014 1:15 PM ET4 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


NILE’s net income has dropped dramatically. At just $1.65 million, quarterly net
income dropped 57%. This decline is steeper than in 2011, when the CEO resigned
and stock dropped 27%.


NILE also faces a big problem inherent to its online business. Executives say NILE
struggles with getting men to buy engagement rings online because of “trust” and
“relationship” issues.


Giants like Costco, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Tiffany and QVC are stealing the hearts of
NILE’s would-be customers. So competition will explode as they advertise more to
acquire more and more customers.


NILE’s early-bird advantage is gone. It now faces issues of market share, growing
competition, declining net income, insider selling, departing managers, questionable
traditional store “testing,” and weakening business model.


Diamond seller, Blue Nile (NASDAQ:NILE), is in the business of turning romance into cold,
hard cash.


As if that isn't tough enough, the Seattle, Wash. diamond and jewelry retailer is selling
online. While the company's courtship of customers is getting tougher, recent creative
hype has blinded investors into buying into the dream and pushing the market cap to a
stunning $400 million.


But this love story is doomed. Here are some highlights on why TheStreetSweeper
believes the diamond company will quickly lose its sparkle once again:


*Diamonds are a girl's best friend: Online cheap won't cut it.


NILE's core engagement business is at risk partially because a woman may feel a slight
wave of disappointment when Prince Charming shows up with a diamond - and it's from a
Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)-esque online store.

NILE execs admitted during a summertime William Blair stock conference, in fact, that the
biggest problem is getting men to buy engagement rings online because there's "a trust
component and then there's a relationship component."


CEO Harvey Kanter added the company is trying to convince customers that online buying
is better. "I think that that -- the reason why growth rates haven't been sustainably high
has been that we still have to get a lot of the market to understand that."


*NILE's recent "test:" Weakening business model.


Mr. Kanter said NILE is now "testing" a brick-and-mortar store in Rhode Island and in
Seattle. This appears to be a test of the idea that customers may consider buying
engagement diamonds online less satisfying and riskier than seeing and touching them in
a store first.


Keep in mind that the reason NILE can sell jewelry cheaper is because, as an online
company, it has been able to avoid the costs of physical buildings, utilities and sales
people of traditional jewelry stores. And now it's trying to compete in brick-and-mortar with
thousands of established jewelry stores.


*Competition is growing: Threatens NILE's market share.


NILE's rivals continue to offer online customers more diamond for their dollar. This
PriceScope chart shows that the diamond competition is growing and NILE no longer
offers the best price - a factor that an astute, cost-conscious man can find with an internet
search.


The chart shows, for example, virtually the same .95 carat diamond sold by NILE can now
be bought from Solomon Brothers and Eternity Diamonds for $1,800 to $1,900 less.


The chart lists more than a dozen vendors in the space where NILE is scratching to
remain relevant. But as NILE's filings state, numerous online jewelry businesses are
flooding the space and now include everything from Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to Amazon
(NASDAQ:AMZN), and QVC to Wal-Mart, and James Allen to Tiffany (NYSE:TIF). And
these giants have the megabucks to spend on advertising to acquire more and more
customers.


*Setting the stage: Management runs off.


Founder Mark C. Vadon resigned as chairman and director in his 15th year with NILE on
Dec. 31, 2013.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2699165-blue-nile-breaking-hearts-and-share-value 3/7


A frustrated, Birkenstock-footed engagement ring buyer and recent Stanford grad in 1999,
Mr. Vadon joined the growing dot-com boom after he bought a diamond ring from a mom-
and-pop business that sold jewelry online. He stopped by the Seattle store one day for a
chat and ended up scratching out a $5 million offer on a napkin. Mr. Vadon didn't have that
kind of money but the country was in the midst of dot-com fever and investors turned him
into an instant executive.


Though he initially overspent the company's new-found cash, Mr. Vadon learned quickly.
He piloted his so-called "evil empire" through rugged waters and the dot-com bust that
sunk many companies and investments.


But Mr. Vadon began selling his shares of NILE in August 2013, as he bought Home
Depot (NYSE:HD) stock, and stepped out the door in December just before NILE sales
and profit began dropping significantly. The company's chart below shows this decline:


When management started running, the stock price ran down, too, as the next chart
shows. Despite the recent uptick, the price still rests at about $34 - or about 27 percent
below the $48 per share price on the day Mr. Vadon left.


NILE's chief accounting officer resigned just months before Mr. Vadon left. The company
has endured a heavy management turnover trend, including a succession of six chief
financial officers in four years, even one who quit before he started his first day.


*One reason fleeing managers knew what they were doing: Negative operating cash

Alarmingly, NILE's total free cash flow last quarter turned negative again at $ -5.0 million,
compared with the December 2013 positive number of $55.9 million. It has been negative
in three of the last five quarters. See the chart below.


Directly from NILE's recent SEC filing, cash from operations compared unfavorably with
the last nine months of 2013.


Indeed, net income is dropping dramatically, as shown on page 15 of NILE's SEC filing. At
just $1.65 million, quarterly net income dropped to 57 percent of net income the previous
year.


That's an eye-popping $1.25 million decline. That's also a steeper net income drop than
the drop NILE reported in 2011, when then-CEO Diane Irvine suddenly resigned and the
stock dropped 27 percent overnight.


*Insiders yelling: "Sell!"


When the stock price rebounded a bit following recent hype about designers joining NILE
and a mixed quarterly report, Jon Sainsbury, international president, quickly sold 1,000
shares of his freshly exercised options. And it would make sense if more insider sales are
announced in coming weeks with this little uptick after 10 months of generally declining
prices.


In fact, during the past year alone, insiders have done nothing but sell, sell, sell. Perhaps
signaling either a lack of trust in the business or in the sustainability of the stock price or
both, Mr. Vadon and other officers and directors have sold over $3 million worth of stock.


Yep, in just one year, $3 million worth of NILE shares sold by insiders.


Investors may find positive and negative viewpoints on NILE HERE.


*Conclusion:


Numerous negative, thoroughly unromantic signs lurk ahead for this online diamond and
jewelry retailer. Though NILE took advantage of its early break into the online jewelry
business, the company's dramatically dropping net income, desperate experiment with

Comments (4)


traditional storefronts, weakening business model, departing leadership and insider selling
strongly suggest NILE is losing market share.


Besides, NILE shouldn't just be selling big, shiny rocks. It should be part of the touch and
feel experience integral to each love story. Yet the company will only find it increasingly
difficult to romance the customer through the cold screen of a computer or smartphone.


So, all these issues combined will ultimately leave NILE shareholders waiting at the altar
with their hands full of cheap, lackluster shares - and no sparkly diamond ring.

Street Sweeeper - I generally like your ideas and have profited on a couple of them. But I believe your article on NILE
is a bit misleading as it does not reveal full information. Couple considerations: 
- Looking at PriceScoop, NILE is still a price leader in smaller sized diamonds, that cost under $1000. The example
you presented is for a diamond costing +$6000, which is quite unlikely to be bought online and thus probably not the
target market of NILE. Thus your argument that NILE has lost its spot as a price leader already is misleading. 
- Table showing revenue decline does not consider seasonality effects. Q4 is always the best quarter for the company.
If one compares Q3 2013 and Q3 2014, the revenue increased 7% YoY. Thus the business is still growing. 
- Argument that cashflows have been negative recently is also quite week as it does not consider the changes in
working capital. NILE accrues high amount of payables (due to seasonality in sales) in Q4 and then pays them down
in Q1. Thus Q1 is always cash-flow negative in a big time. The Q3 negative cashflow was also mainly caused by the
decrease in payables.


NILE might still be overvalued, but the arguments you presented (except for management changes and insider
selling) are misleading or weak at best.

It's ironic that StreetSweeper, that advocate for the small vulnerable retail investor, chooses to use tricks that
will only fool small vulnerable retail investors.

NILE is shrinking! See here, their sales were lower in the last three [seasonally weak] quarters than in last
year's Holiday season! [Sales grew q/q and YTD, in reality.]


Oh, and their founder jumped ship and sold stock just before sales plummeted! wink wink. I mean, I'm not
gonna accuse him of anything, because sales are actually growing. But if you, the little guy, wants to connect
some fake dots, feel free!


They use seasonality to mislead on cash flow; and fail to point out that tax rate deviations explained the y/y
net income drop, as operating income grew.


"NILE shouldn’t just be selling big, shiny rocks. It should be part of the touch and feel experience integral to
each love story."


Is Sonya working for Tiffany's now? A jewelry salesmen union of some sort? 50-100% markups are romantic;
oh, and the process is too: wouldn't you guys be sad if you could bypass car dealers and buy more cheaply
direct from the manufacturer?


What's up Street Sweeper? You guys used to be quality.


[I'm open-mindedly neutral on the stock and have no position in it.]

There were multiple flaws in these arguments:


1. Diamond Pricing - The article does not compare like for like diamonds. The price variance is a result of different
polish / cut / symmetry grades (NILE's are all better, hence the higher price)


a. If you actually compared equal stones (William Blair does a good monthly analysis) you'll see NILE's are materially
cheaper than competition (~ 15% on average, which has held for many quarters)


2. Negative FCF - While the FCF amount has declined YoY, the negative Q3 was largely a result of seasonal negative
working capital. It was $7.2MM use in 2014 vs. $5.6MM use in 2013, which largely due to a $1.5MM YoY swing in
inventory


a. Excluding changes in working capital they're still generating +$14.3MM in LTM FCF (or if you prefer to include it
they are + $11MM)


3. Online Cheap Model - Going back to 2005, NILE has grown at higher growth rate than traditional in store
competitors (Tiffany's & Signet)


4. Competition - Comparing the core NILE shopper (relatively affluent mid 30s / 40s male; though females browse as
well) to Wal-Mart (in store purchase / lower income) and QVC is irrational given the very different target demographics


A few positives you omit:


1. Declining diamond prices - The recent decline in diamond prices actually gives NILE a large advantage over in
store jewelers who hold inventory.

2. International - They are making significant progress in China (~ 12MM weddings per year vs 2MM in the United
States) at the diamond shows, with international revenue growing 26% in Q3


3. OpEx Leverage - NILE has held their opex relatively flat (and will be able to do so going forward), therbye allowing
for operating leverage as the gross margin rate flattens


4. Long term offline to online purchase migration - While jewelry is at a much lower conversion rate than apparel /
electronics, there's still a long-term shift in younger consumers buying more items online

Great products. Bad stock. Totally mispriced. It only earns $10 million a yr. Why is the market cap $400+ million?
Stock should be trading at $20. I love Blue Nile...as does my wife. Good prices. Fast shipping. The sapphires are high
quality. The stock is not.
