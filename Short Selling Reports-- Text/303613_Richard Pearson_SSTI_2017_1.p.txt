Short SSTI. ShotSpotter is worse than
you thought
(https://moxreports.com/1938-2/)
 N O V EM B ER  2 1 ,  2 0 1 7  | R P


Summary:


In over 20 years SSTI has never generated pro�ts or meaningful cash. Recent IPO
simply allows VCs to �nally exit positions. Dec 4th lockup expiration on 8 million
shares
Reams of independent data and test use con�rm that SSTI ‘s technology simply
doesn’t work. Period. Customers repeatedly describe overwhelming failure rate.
Aggressive tactics by SSTI thwart release of FOIA docs to journalists and
researchers. Employee testimony states SSTI provides fabricated data to law
enforcement.
Multiple recent undisclosed contract losses (just ahead of lockup expiration) and
in�ated 3Q revenue.
Contracts such as Miami and Baltimore (and others) have been repeatedly
announced, then quietly cancelled, re-announced, but then quietly cancelled again.


Note: This article is the opinion of the author.  The author is short SSTI.


I suspect that much of the information in this article may actually come as a surprise even to certain board
members.  ShotSpotter has historically provided very optimistic reports to its board members, touting the
unmitigated success and “proof” of its products, without including information like I have included below.  A
copy of one of these reports is included below.

(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSTI)) o�ers software and hardware systems which provide locational
information on gunshot activity within covered areas. When someone �res a gun, ShotSpotter’s microphones
detect the gunshot and send the data to a ShotSpotter center in California.  It is then determined if it is indeed
a gunshot. Finally, the location of the gunshot is relayed to law enforcement personnel.


 


***   SHOT SPOTTER INVESTMENT THESIS – SUMMARY
Below I will make clear the following points to show why ShotSpotter will quickly fall by around 80% to $2-4,
once the lockup expires on December 4th.


1. Uninterrupted history of failure. After a 23 year history of uninterrupted
commercial and �nancial failure, ShotSpotter was suddenly publicly hyped in 2017
as an innovative high tech solution to gun violence, so that it could come public in
an IPO by Roth Capital. For two decades ShotSpotter has had repeated brushes
with outright insolvency.


2. The IPO was arranged as the only exit for insiders from a business that has been
unable to succeed for more than 20 years. The purpose of this IPO was simply to
allow insiders and PE investors to exit an otherwise unsellable, money losing
investment. On December 4th, 8 million shares will be released from lockup,
allowing these investors to �nally sell.  Ahead of that lockup expiration,
ShotSpotter juiced its revenues by pulling forward nearly$1 million of revenues
(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4124224-shotspotters-ssti-ceo-ralph-clark-q3-
2017-results-earnings-call-transcript) from a cancelled Puerto Rico contract and
then failing to disclose other contract cancellations.


3. ShotSpotter. Does. Not. Work. Period.  Reams of hard data prove quite conclusively
that ShotSpotter simply does not work.   This is why ShotSpotter has repeatedly
been unable to maintain customers or generate any pro�ts despite 20 years of
trying. Actual documented success rates of less than 2%, with 70-80% of all alerts
being unfounded or false alarms.


4. Customers explicitly state that ShotSpotter does not work and fully con�rm the
hard data. New customers keep canceling. Following their cancellations, former
customers con�rm categorically that ShotSpotter simply does not work.  Including
major “trophy” contracts such as Baltimore, Miami, San Antonio and Oakland.


5. ShotSpotter employee testimony (under oath) states that data presented to law
enforcement is outright fabricated.


6. Aggressive tactics to conceal, distort or prevent outright the release of the
“damning” data. Internal memos reveal aggressive tactics by ShotSpotter to thwart
FOIA requests by journalists and universities seeking transparency into
government spending on ShotSpotter. Deliberate steps to legally gag police forcesSCROLL

from disclosing the negative data.  The data being withheld is the same data that
categorically proves that ShotSpotter simply does not work.


7. ShotSpotter fails to disclose major contract losses ahead of lockup expiration.  In
its November earnings call, ShotSpotter indicated clearly that only one contract
had been lost.  Below I show the proof that 3 more contracts have been lost but not
disclosed by ShotSpotter ahead of the lockup expiration.


8. ShotSpotter makes diametrically opposing statements to law enforcement,
journalists and university researchers, depending on its �nancial interest in each
situation. ShotSpotter presents one set of facts to law enforcement when selling
its product to government payers. It then presents the opposite “facts” to parties
trying to investigate spending on ShotSpotter and its effectiveness.  ShotSpotter
also presents additional “facts” which contradict its own data when marketing the
product. The government payers who buy ShotSpotter are relying on the wrong
data.


 


***   SECTION 1 – OVER 20 YEARS OF UNINTERRUPTED FAILURE
AND LOSSES
ShotSpotter’s technology is not new.  Neither is gun violence.


ShotSpotter’s founder, Robert Showen (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-
struggles-to-prove-impact-as-silicon-valley-answer-to-gun-violence/) came up with this idea all the way back in
1994 when he kept hearing the sounds of gun�re in neighboring East Palo Alto. Over the years, there have
been a few minor improvements to the technology to try to weed out more false positives (from other loud
noises). But overall, the technology is still largely the same as it was 23 years ago.


Recent media headlines have been dominated by gun violence. But in fact, the US has had an epidemic
problem of gun violence for decades.  Despite this decades of ongoing violence, ShotSpotter has not been
able to achieve any real traction, and certainly no pro�ts for more than 20 years
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351636/000104746917003890/a2232376z424b4.htm).


Here is a list of gun violence incidents that made major US headlines, all in 2015 or earlier.  The point is that
high pro�le gun violence has been a problem in the US for decades, yet it has not allowed ShotSpotter to ever
generate a pro�t.

ShotSpotter has repeatedly been forced to raise new money via private placements in order stave o�
insolvency (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-struggles-to-prove-impact-as-
silicon-valley-answer-to-gun-violence/), with investors describing the company as “ subsisting on fumes
(https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-struggles-to-prove-impact-as-silicon-valley-
answer-to-gun-violence/)”.  At one point, ShotSpotter decided to change the direction of its business and
attempt to create a“big data” play (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-struggles-
to-prove-impact-as-silicon-valley-answer-to-gun-violence/) on its detection of gun shots. At the time, “big data”
was the hot new thing.


That “big data” plan �zzled entirely.  But the collection and analysis of the “big data” did have one result:  there
was now enough data gathered to prove categorically that ShotSpotter’s technology simply does not work.


This was obviously very, very bad. So ShotSpotter quickly adopted a campaign to thwart any release of that
data, including blocking access for universities seeking to research it under the Freedom of Information Act.
(https://www.foia.gov/)


These points are fully substantiated below. Evidence is provided via internal memos, court documents,
investigative journalists and complaints by former customers.


***   SECTION 2 – THE IPO (AND UPCOMING LOCKUP
EXPIRATION) AS AN EXIT FOR TRAPPED INVESTORS
After more than 20 years of providing cash infusions to keep a�oat this struggling business, these private
investors were �nally unwilling to put in any further funds.


In March of 2017, ShotSpotter was once again down to just $2 million in cash
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351636/000104746917003890/a2232376z424b4.htm) but
had debt and current liabilities of $25 million
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351636/000104746917003890/a2232376z424b4.htm).  By this
time, ShotSpotter had never turned a pro�t and had an accumulated de�cit of $89 million. As usual,
ShotSpotter was again “running on fumes”.


With private equity no longer willing to fund it, in June of 2017, ShotSpotter decided to come public in an IPO
led by Roth Capital (http://www.shotspotter.com/press-releases/article/shotspotter-inc.-announces-closing-of-
initial-public-o�ering).


Not surprisingly, the bankers behind the IPO
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351636/000104746917003746/a2232322zs-1a.htm) are also the
exact same banks who are pumping out bullish research on ShotSpotter. Roth Capital, Imperial Capital and
Northland Capital.


When the lockup expires on December 4th, these are the same banks who will make millions of dollars in
banking fees by running the secondary o�ering for the insiders to sell over 8 million shares
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351636/000104746917003746/a2232322zs-1a.htm).


Not surprisingly, each of these banks has been able to ignore the wealth of information that I present in this
article.  A large December fee event will no doubt provide a nice bump up in each of their year end bonuses.
The support of these analysts therefore comes as no surprise.


Here is what we are hearing from Roth Capital, Imperial Capital and Northland Capital just ahead of this
pending lockup expiration. So far they have made no mention of the concerns I raise below.

***   SECTION 3 – SHOTSPOTTER. DOES. NOT. WORK. PERIOD.
 (THE DATA)
The data against shot spotter is absolutely and overwhelmingly conclusive. And it comes in great detail from a
wide variety of completely independent sources. Each of these point to the same exact results.


As I will show in a subsequent section, ShotSpotter has undertaken signi�cant e�orts to thwart the release of
any performance data for its product.  This is because the data is absolutely horri�c. It proves conclusively
that the product provides no material bene�t whatsoever.


But an investigative journalist from Forbes was able to separately obtain and analyze much of the data behind
ShotSpotter.  His conclusions were beyond compelling.


The data obtained by Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-alerts-police-
to-lots-of-gun�re-but-produces-few-tangible-results/) in 2016 showed that ShotSpotter provided huge numbers
of alerts to law enforcement, but that more than 98% of these alerts ended in no arrests being made.


Up to 70% of the alerts were described as entirely “unfounded”.


Roughly 90% of the time, no police report was ever even �led following the alert from ShotSpotter.

And then this gets interesting.


In trying to attract and retain customers, ShotSpotter repeatedly touts the high number of alerts that its
system puts out, indicating that the higher the number of alerts, the greater the bene�t it is providing


But as we will see below, the high alert rate itself is actually the biggest problem, because the overwhelming
majority of ShotSpotter alerts are nothing more than false alarms.


The data above is the quantitative proof which ShotSpotter has been aggressively trying to suppress from
public view. It is notable that the data are highly consistent across cities of all sizes and locations within the
country.


In fact, additional qualitative proof comes in the form of public statements from municipal o�icials and law
enforcement who went on the record to publicly explain why they were abandoning this system after spending
huge sums of tax payer money to have it installed.

***   SECTION 4. – “DAMNING” COMPLAINTS CONFIRMING THAT
SHOTSPOTTER SIMPLY “DOESN’T WORK”.
Below I present the on-the-record comments made by law enforcement o�icials and government o�icials who
have actually used and evaluated the ShotSpotter system.


What you should notice is this:


The comments below precisely echo the quantitative data above, even though they come from a wide
range of totally di�erent cities.


In addition, (just like the city data above), the verbal comments and complaints below are highly
consistent among one another.


Once again, each of these cities says the exact same thing: that ShotSpotter simply doesn’t work.


The list of cities who have cancelled ShotSpotter and then publicly decried its total lack of e�ectiveness
speci�cally includes cities such as Miami, Baltimore, San Antonio and Oakland. These cities have been
repeatedly touted as being on the cusp of providing major revenues to ShotSpotter.  But then the contracts
with those cities have been cancelled or discontinued prematurely with little or no revenue at all.


#1 – Miami previously cancelled and said ShotSpotter doesn’t work


Recent headlines (http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-
dade/article176206371.html) have indicated that ShotSpotter is on track to implement a major contract
installation in Miami.  ShotSpotter is a brand new IPO, so perhaps investors can be forgiven for not knowing
the prior history of major contract announcements (speci�cally for Miami) which were then repeatedly
cancelled with little or no revenue.


Local Miami media is already skeptical of the latest supposed Miami contract, because they have seen this
gambit with ShotSpotter before.


Article: Should Miami-Dade Police Spend $5 Million on a Gunshot Detector They Abandoned Before?
(http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/should-miami-dade-police-spend-5-million-on-a-gunshot-detector-they-
abandoned-before-8796888)


Both the Miami Police Department and the Broward County Sheri�s Department have publicly gone on the
record to state that ShotSpotter simply does not work. Worse than that, implementing the system results in a
massive diversion of police resources to unfounded calls, taking o�icers away from actual crimes being
committed.


This is why both the city and the county cancelled their previous contract.  (Below we will see in greater detail
the mechanics behind the repeated re-announcements of contracts that are then cancelled with little to no
revenue).


In Miami, for every one veri�able gunshot, there were at least twenty false alarms.  After more than a
year, the system led to just four arrests.

Actually this was the second time that ShotSpotter had been tried and then quickly rejected in Miami
(Broward Sherri�’s O�ice).


Here was the �rst time they ditched ShotSpotter:


Article: BSO Pulling Plug On Gun Shot Spotter (http://miami.cbslocal.com/2011/11/23/bso-pulling-plug-on-
gun-shot-spotter/)


According to the sheri�’s o�ice:


They could chalk up only four arrests to the system compared to the many man hours wasted
by deputies checking out false alarms.” Apparently, ShotSpotter could not distinguish between
“gunshots, �recrackers, vehicle back�res or big trucks downshifting on nearby I-95.


#2 – Baltimore cancelled and said ShotSpotter doesn’t work


Just like Miami, we have seen multiple public announcements trumpeting a ShotSpotter contract for
Baltimore.  These reports were actually entirely wrong, but few people ever saw the quiet corrections down
the road.

As with Miami, despite some �ashy news in 2017, Baltimore had already tried, evaluated and then cancelled
ShotSpotter on two separate prior occasions.


In February of 2014, SSTI posted to its web site a very prominent post highlighting that the Baltimore police
department would be implementing ShotSpotter. This announcement was exceptionally high pro�le
because by this time the gun violence crisis in Baltimore had already surpassed Chicago in severity.


ShotSpotter website: Baltimore Police to Invest in Gunshot Detection System
(http://shotspotter.com/news/article/baltimore-police-to-invest-in-gunshot-detection-system)


 


 


 


It took until a full year later, but we �nally found out that this post was not only grossly premature, but
it also turned out to be completely wrong.In fact, a full year later we found that this contract never went in
to place at all in 2014 and that it would not be doing so going forward. In other words, in 2014 this information
was so preliminary that it should have never been posted by the company at all. And in the end it turned out to

#4 – Oakland cancelled its expansion and has said ShotSpotter doesn’t work


The city of Oakland has been described as (https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlj45jggj/3-oakland/) the “third
most dangerous city in America”.


But in a review of ShotSpotter, Oakland police were quoted
(https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2017/0128/Chicago-turns-to-tech-to-curb-murder-rate-Will-it-work) as
calling the “ technology as not only ine�ective, but also counterproductive.”

(http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/Oakland-cops-aim-to-scrap-gun�re-detecting-5316060.php)


 


Oakland police have also called the system:


expensive and redundant…They say residents already call to alert police when they hear gun�re,
and the money could be better used to fund other technology, such as the police helicopter.


Keep in mind, that Oakland is right in the backyard of ShotSpotter and its founders.


As of recent quarters, Oakland was still a partial customer of ShotSpotter.


On the recent conference call on November 7th, ShotSpotter indicated clearly that aside from Puerto
Rico/Virgin Islands, there had been no other contract losses. SCROLLTO TOP

But as far back as April 28, 2017
(http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oak/groups/cityadministrator/documents/policy/OAK063800.pdf) the city of
Oakland had already publicly disclosed that it was discontinuing its expansion of ShotSpotter.  Phase I had
already been implemented, but Phases 2 and 3 have now been cancelled. As is always the case, the part
actually implemented was small, while the majority of the previously announced contracts were actually
cancelled without providing the “expected” revenue to ShotSpotter.


In fact, given the public statements to the press by Oakland police, these cancellations really should have
come as no surprise whatsoever.


 


Link: Oakland Budget – Apr 2017
(http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oak/groups/cityadministrator/documents/policy/OAK063800.pdf)


Clearly someone in the Oakland municipal government has a favorable opinion of ShotSpotter.  But in fact,
the police have actually been trying to scrap the program for years – since 2014. In its attempts to keep
Oakland from cancelling their entire program, ShotSpotter then slashed its fees dramatically.

#5 – San Antonio cuts ShotSpotter and said it doesn’t work

about 80 percent of the times when ShotSpotter was activated, police could �nd no evidence of a
shooting at the scene…


The San Antonio Police made it very clear why they were cutting ShotSpotter.The system simply didn’t’
work.


Over the course of 15 months, the system only resulted in a mere 4 arrests – at a cost over $136,500 per
arrest !


In their own words (http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-police-cut-pricey-gunshot-

“It doesn’t make the community feel safer”
“It doesn’t reduce the number of gunshots in our community”
“It doesn’t prevent you from being shot.”


In other words, the only party to bene�t from the massive tax dollars spent on ShotSpotter
is….well….ShotSpotter itself.

#6 – Fall River cancelled and said ShotSpotter doesn’t work


Fall River is another interesting example.


The question is this:  Did ShotSpotter lose the Fall River contract or not ?


On the one hand…it is true that Fall River continues to use the ShotSpotter product. SCROLL
TO TOP
7/5/2019 Short SSTI. ShotSpotter is worse than you thought - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/1938-2/ 17/35


But on the other hand…after Fall River recently canceled their contract, ShotSpotter just now started providing
Fall River with the service for FREE.


Clearly the contract that ShotSpotter had signed with Fall River required payment for the service and clearly
those payments are no longer being made.  In other words, “Yes”, the contract has been cancelled.  But “No”
the loss of this contract has not been announced by ShotSpotter. In fact, the data provided by ShotSpotter on
November 7 th clearly indicated that aside from Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, no other contracts had been lost.


For now, ShotSpotter has o�ered to continue to provide free service to Fall River such that it feels that it does
not need to disclose the contract loss until after the lockup. Very convenient !


But here’s the rub:  once the lockup expires on December 4 th SSTI will have no more reason to lose money
by proving free service to non paying customers. I expect that at that time the cancellation of the contract will
�nally be announced.

In order to attract new customers, ShotSpotter has implemented an aggressive campaign to suppress and
conceal all of the negative information about the product.


At the same time, ShotSpotter aggressively supplies these o�icials with a deeply misleading sub-section of
statistics to allow them to tout how it is in fact tremendously e�ective!


The Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) was passed in 1967 to provide transparency into the workings and
decisions of government so as to avoid fraud and waste.


From the website FOIA.gov (https://www.foia.gov/about.html)


 


Internal memos from ShotSpotter reveal the aggressive tactics that ShotSpotter is using to thwart the release
of data under FOIA


FOIA allows for several exceptions including for law enforcement, public safety, and trade secrets.  In fact, the
only “secret” that ShotSpotter is trying to protect is the fact that its product simply doesn’t work and that it is a
waste of federal and local tax dollars.


In internal memos, ShotSpotter is not shy about saying that the purpose of withholding this information is
to protect its own business from “harm” that would be caused by releasing the data.


ShotSpotter instructs recipients to:


#1 – simply refuse to release, or


#2 – release data that is heavily redacted to not show the terminal �aws shown above


#3 – “ Obscure” the most important information


And then even when any information is actually released, ShotSpotter has speci�cally instructed its recipients
to deliberately provide only paper copies of the heavily redacted information so as to further thwart
dissemination online by anyone.


The screenshot below is a “ Customer Success Training Bulletin” circulated by ShotSpotter.


Notably, ShotSpotter is more than happy to release data which simply shows the huge number of raw alerts.
 This information is then used for marketing purposes.


The grand irony here is that it is precisely this excessive number of false alerts that is precisely the reason
why ShotSpotter is so ine�ective and wasteful of public resources. But because ShotSpotter deliberately
stymies the release of the full data set, this large number of alerts actually looks like a net positive for the
system. As a result, no one is the wiser.


Below I show repeated examples where ShotSpotter actively promotes itself based on the notion that “a high
number of alerts equals a higher level of public safety”.

“ In Q4 2014 there were 16,597 (https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-

“ During the �rst half of 2014 (https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-

reported 11,675 gun�re incidents occurred in the 107.6 square miles in those
areas; down from 14,703 in the same period in 2013 over 98.6 square miles.”


Selling the board of directors:


These are the exact type of stats that ShotSpotter management feeds to its board members in periodic
“progress reports (https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3112261-Proof-ShotSpotter-Delivers-
Results.html)”. The reports contain very brief “news” articles which read more like press releases and contain
heavy amounts of data supplied directly by ShotSpotter itself. They also contain lengthy “ case studies
(https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3112261-Proof-ShotSpotter-Delivers-Results.html)” which were
written by management to tout success stories.  But in reading the “case studies” more closely, it becomes
interesting to observe the large number of “satis�ed customers” who then canceled their contracts subsequent
to the date of the report.


 


Link: Full document (https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3112261-Proof-ShotSpotter-Delivers-

The point is this: ShotSpotter actively promotes its product on the basis that “more alerts equates to greater
public safety”.  In fact, as we can see from the data and the customer complaints, the exact opposite is true.
 The biggest problem is that ShotSpotter results in false alerts as much as 70-90% of the time.  But because
ShotSpotter has largely concealed the data, the public and the government payers may not know until after
they use and then cancel the system.

Despite this, ShotSpotter has not disclosed any of these cancellations.


In some cases, in response to cancellation, ShotSpotter has taken to “giving the service for free” to delay
reporting the cancellation until after the lockup expires. But the fact is that such customers already announced
their cancellation and are no longer paying ShotSpotter. SCROLL

Also, keep in mind that these are just the ones I have already found.  There may be additional undisclosed
contract losses that I have not yet found. But I will continue looking, of course.


On the earnings call (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4124224-shotspotters-ssti-ceo-ralph-clark-q3-2017-
results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) on November 7th, the comments made by CEO Ralph Clark
made it very clear that aside from Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, the company had not lost any other contracts.


Puerto Rico was important because it was ShotSpotter’s 2 nd largest customer accounting for 10% of
revenues.  It was a big loss, but at least it was (according to the CEO) the only loss.


We can see this from the Q2 transcript. (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4124224-shotspotters-ssti-ceo-ralph-
clark-q3-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single)


CEO Clark stated that net new miles gone live in the quarter was only 17.  The total gross new miles was 50.
But Clark stated clearly that the number of square miles lost in Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands was exactly 33.


In other words, ahead of this key lockup, Mr. Clark has made it very clear that aside from Puerto Rico/Virgin
Islands, ShotSpotter has not lost any other customers.  This information has clearly provided strong support to
the stock price just ahead of the lockup expiration where insiders can �nally sell their shares.


Cancellation #1 – San Antonio. Newspaper articles from as far back as August 2017 were already noting
that San Antonio was cancelling its contract. They were quite clear in stating their reasons why:


Speci�c quotes from San Antonio Police include:


about 80 percent of the times when ShotSpotter was activated, police could �nd no
evidence of a shooting at the scene
the system only resulted in a mere 4 arrests – at a cost over $136,500 per arrest
“It doesn’t make the community feel safer”
“It doesn’t reduce the number of gunshots in our community”
“It doesn’t prevent you from being shot.”

(http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-police-cut-pricey-gunshot-detection-
11824797.php) (Aug 2017)


Even though this cancellation (and the reasons why) could be found as early as 6 months ago, ShotSpotter
has recently continued to insist that the only lost contract was Puerto Rico.


Cancellation #2 – Fall River. As we also saw above, Fall River, MA is no longer paying for the service, but
ShotSpotter is continuing to provide the service for free so as to not disclose the loss of the contract ahead of
the lockup expiration.


Article: Fall River to keep ShotSpotter program for free (September 2017) (http://wpri.com/2017/09/28/fall-
river-to-keep-shotspotter-program-for-free/)


ShotSpotter has agreed to let the city of Fall River continue to use the system for free, Mayor Jasiel
Correia announced Thursday.


 


Cancellation #3 –  Oakland, CA


As far back as April 28, 2017 the city of Oakland had already publicly disclosed that it was discontinuing its
expansion of ShotSpotter.  Phase I had already been implemented, but Phases 2 and 3 have now been
cancelled. As is always the case, the part actually implemented was small, while the majority of the previously

announced contracts were actually cancelled without providing the “expected” revenue to ShotSpotter.


In fact, given the public statements to the press by Oakland police, these cancellations really should have
come as no surprise whatsoever.


 


 


 


***   SECTION 8 – SHOTSPOTTER MAKES CONTRADICTING
STATEMENTS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT VS. JOURNALISTS AND
UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS
In fact, beyond this deliberate distortion of the data above, ShotSpotter goes much further in disseminating
information that is �at out incorrect.


We can see repeated examples where ShotSpotter gives one set of facts to law enforcement customers but
then gives contradicting “facts” to researchers and journalists who are investigating the use of ShotSpotter.


Here are 3 examples:


Example #1 – “Alternative facts” on crime data


Jennifer Doleac is an assistant professor of public policy and economics at the University of Virginia who
attempted to get her hands on the data (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-
struggles-to-prove-impact-as-silicon-valley-answer-to-gun-violence/) underlying ShotSpotter to assess
whether it actually works and if it is a sensible use of tax dollars.


ShotSpotter adamantly rebu�ed any and all e�orts to obtain the data for analysis. When Ms. Doleac
requested the information citing that the data was a matter of public interest – crime data – Mr. Clark sent her
a strongly worded letter (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-struggles-to-prove-
impact-as-silicon-valley-answer-to-gun-violence/) insisting that ShotSpotter was now a “Cloud based
services model” and speci�cally that SST’s ShotSpotter data is NOT crime data”.


Obviously this statement from Clark de�es common sense. We know that any data related to urban gun�re is
going to be crime data.

This statement by ShotSpotter CEO was a convenient excuse for the company to suddenly refuse to release
the data which would prove that the product is a waste of taxpayer dollars.


As shown in the examples below, ShotSpotter has consistently described its data as crime data when that
served a useful marketing purpose.  But when the release of “crime data” became a threat to ShotSpotter
became a threat, the CEO simply changed his story.


From ShotSpotter’s website:


Law enforcement is no longer dependent (http://www.shotspotter.com/law-enforcement) on 911 calls
with ShotSpotter because it instantly noti�es o�icers of gunshot crimes in progress with real-time
data.


From ShotSpotter’s brochure: “ Key Bene�ts (http://www.shotspotter.com/system/content-
uploads/ShotSpotter-Flex-Datasheet.pdf): … Proactive gun crime pattern analysis & strategic deterrence.”


The point is this:  In trying to sell its product to government payers, ShotSpotter repeatedly highlights the
value of its crime data. But as soon as it fears it will have to turn the data over to independent investigators in
FOIA requests, ShotSpotter simply claims that this data is no longer “crime data”.  ShotSpotter will say
anything (even contradicting its own earlier statements) to prevent the release of the reams of data which
prove that the product does not work.


Example #2 – Because ShotSpotter doesn’t work, the company invents new metrics in order to sell
the product to new cities.


ShotSpotter clearly doesn’t work in even remotely the way it is marketed.  We can see that from the raw data
as well as the detailed comments from law enforcement across the country.  We can also see it in various
court documents and investigative articles.


We know from the data and complaints above that ShotSpotter doesn’t improve public safety or reduce gun
violence.  In the vast majority of cases, the system can’t even determine if any shot was �red at all.


So instead, ShotSpotter has taken to inventing new “success objectives” for the use of its product.


Even if there are no arrests or other public safety bene�ts, ShotSpotter tries to convince the public that there
is some bene�t to things like:


�nding shell casings well after the fact“sending a powerful message to law abiding citizens”“ better community
relations (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-struggles-to-prove-impact-as-

ShotSpotter IR: Dozens of Shell Casings Found in Two Separate Shootings
(http://www.shotspotter.com/news/article/dozens-of-shell-casings-found-in-two-separate-shootings)


[ Clark] said (http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/public-safety-
blog/article60938427.html) he wondered if the department was de�ning success in the wrong
way.


ShotSpotter allows police to make a quick response to gun�re…which sends a powerful message
to law-abiding citizens and shooters that police take gun�re seriously.


There’s a few things that are problematic,’ said
(http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2017/11/17/shot-spotter-technology-relshot-spotter-
technology-coming-under-increased-scrutiny-judicial-communit/844335001/) Monroe County Assistant
Public Defender Katie Higgins…‘[ ShotSpotter] was not designed to be used as actual primary
evidence (in a trial),’ she said.


 


ShotSpotter IR: ShotSpotter alert leads police to shell casings near vacant Peoria house
(http://www.shotspotter.com/news/article/shotspotter-alert-leads-police-to-shell-casings-near-vacant-peoria-
house)


 


According to Forbes, ShotSpotter claims that there is a longer term bene�t which (of course) is much harder
to verify or quantify.  As an example, SSTI frequent cites the fact that even when there are no arrests,
apprehensions or even suspects, there is often crucial evidence that is gathered which can result in
convictions even years down the road.


Forbes describes the value of this supposed bene�t as “overstated”, which I believe is a considerable
understatement.


For example, a ShotSpotter audio recording was used in the prosecution of a shooting that occurred in
Mahoning County, Ohio. However, the expert witness provided by ShotSpotter could not provide details on
key �ndings that would have corroborated other testimony.


According (https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/11/17/shotspotter-struggles-to-prove-impact-as-
silicon-valley-answer-to-gun-violence/) to the Assistant county prosecutor, “We still would have been
able to secure conviction [without ShotSpotter].”


E�ectively, ShotSpotter is just coming up with creative excuses for why law enforcement should
continued spending tax payer money on a system that has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked.


Example #3 – Vocally pretending that ShotSpotter causes visible drops in gun violence


Regardless of whatever any data says and regardless of the complaints from past disgruntled customers, if
ShotSpotter could actually be seen to deliver a visible drop in gun violence then it would certainly be able to
win over more potential new customers.


It is therefore not surprising that ShotSpotter is out there making aggressive “ cause-e�ect” claims about
how SS directly reduces the incidence of violence.


Each of the following links come from ShotSpotter’s investor relations department. They show that
ShotSpotter is marketing itself on the basis that “using ShotSpotter leads to lower gun violence”. SCROLL

ShotSpotter claim: Spring�eld, Mass. topped the nation with the largest reduction in New Year’s Eve
celebratory gun�re, down 60 percent from 2013 to 2014, according to ShotSpotter data
(https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-releases/detail/61/spring�eld-mass-sees-60-percent-decrease-in-new-years)


ShotSpotter claim:“’We are extremely pleased (https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-releases/detail/104/national-
gun�re-index-reveals-28-8-percent-reduction-in) with the dramatic decline in gunshots Fall River has seen
over the last few years…While the 57.4% decrease in shootings is substantial, there is still much more to
do…”


ShotSpotter claim:“ Among U.S. cities using SST’s ShotSpotter technology (https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-
releases/detail/63/new-haven-atlantic-city-and-san-francisco-among-top-�ve), three of the top �ve with largest
reduction in gun�re incidents from 2014 to 2015 were: New Haven, Conn. (-38.5 percent, Atlantic City, NJ
(-35.4 percent), and San Francisco, CA (-34.6 percent).”


ShotSpotter claim:“ Other top cities using ShotSpotter (https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-
releases/detail/61/spring�eld-mass-sees-60-percent-decrease-in-new-years) and with signi�cant reductions in
celebratory gun�re on New Year’s Eve include: Stockton, Calif., with 38.2 percent decline (from 136 to 84
incidents); Miami Gardens, Fla., with 37.5 percent decline (from 48 to 30 incidents); and Rocky Mount, NC,
with a 19.3 percent decline (from 57 to 46 incidents).”


ShotSpotter claim:“ In addition to Fall River’s gun�re incidents (https://ir.shotspotter.com/press-
releases/detail/104/national-gun�re-index-reveals-28-8-percent-reduction-in) declining 57.4 percent, the
following cities experienced impressive reductions and are willing to share their successful approaches for
gun violence reductions: Spring�eld, MA – 51.2%, Camden, NJ – 48.0%, Plain�eld, NJ – 39.8%, East Palo
Alto, CA – 29.1%, Oakland, CA – 26.1%.”]


Here is the truth:


Despite the alarming headlines over high pro�le mass shootings in places like Vegas and Texas, gun
violence has actually been on a steady and consistent decline across the entire US.


The tables below show that gun violence has been steadily deceasing across the US for the past 10 years.
This includes for the country as a whole as well as for wide range of individual cities which have never used
ShotSpotter at all.  Yet ShotSpotter continues to claim the its system is responsible for these declines.


Quite obviously this assessment stands in stark contrast to the data presented above  and the detailed
experiences of law enforcement.

Article: The Economist (https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/02/daily-chart-3)


As can be seen clearly in the table above, cities across America have seen a very steady decline in
gun violence, whether or not they had any use of ShotSpotter at any time ever.


The implementation of ShotSpotter technology is not what is “causing” the reduction in gun violence any more
than SS is “causing” the sun to shine in those cities.  But ShotSpotter is more than happy to claim credit for
“causing” this reduction which is in reality just part of a decade long macro trend.


ShotSpotter’s claims that it somehow results in a reduction in gun violence are entirely bogus and
