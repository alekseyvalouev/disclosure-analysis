Sell Elephant Talk On Current Law Enforcement Investigation With
-75% Downside

Summary


SEC FOIA Request shows Current Law Enforcement Investigation.


After ETAK repeatedly failed to maintain effective internal controls, BDO declined to
remain as auditor for 2014, was replaced by tiny firm Squar Milner.


Recent noisy director resignations citing concern over board independence, related
party transactions, and continuing net losses raise red flags: Is the fox now guarding
the hen house?


NYSE delisting proceedings have reached maximum number of extensions allowed
to regain compliance.


Revenue has declined by 50% since 2008 while shares outstanding has increased 5
times: Fair value for ETAK is $0.20 per share if the company avoids bankruptcy.


I believe investors should be extremely cautious about Elephant Talk (ETAK) shares and
give a SELL recommendation at the current price of $0.86 with a price target of $0.20 if it
can avoid bankruptcy as its cash burns rapidly.


Current active law enforcement investigation


According to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the SEC there is an
ongoing law enforcement investigation into Elephant Talk.


The FOIA can be accessed here.


Specifically, the FOIA reads:


We are withholding records responsive to your request under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)
(NYSE:A), 17 CFR 200.80(b)(7)(NYSE:I). This exemption protects from disclosure
records compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement activities.

This means, beyond any doubt, that Elephant Talk is the subject of a current law
enforcement investigation.


There has been some confusion among investors about what a 7 FOIA exemption means
so I will explain the significance of this language below.


Quoting directly from the Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act:


The first subpart of Exemption 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, Exemption 7,


authorizes the withholding of


"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that production of such law enforcement records or information . . . could
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings."


The 7 exemption is standard across FOIAs from all branches of the US government,
including both the Department of Justice and the SEC.


A FOIA request to the SEC returning a 7 exemption is exceedingly rare and indicates a
law enforcement investigation into the company is under way. Based on numerous
discussions with the SEC, I know for a fact that:


1) A 7 exemption absolutely means a current law enforcement investigation is under way
and there is no other possible interpretation for this FOIA response


2) The representative I spoke with estimated <1% of all US public companies return 7
exemptions - this exemption is absolutely not present for the majority of US public
companies


By way of counter example, I have also included two negative FOIA responses that each
indicate the lack of 7 exemption, and therefore lack of a current law enforcement
investigation:


The first company, Centrix Bank & Trust (OTCQB:CXBT), has no 7 exemption. This
company is not currently under a law enforcement investigation and has no material
records of an investigation taking place.


Likewise, the second company, iCad (NASDAQ:ICAD), has an identical FOIA response
indicating the absence of a current law enforcement investigation.

The vast majority of US public companies have FOIA responses identical to Centrix and
iCad because the majority of companies are not under investigation. This is the only
possible interpretation for these FOIA responses. Elephant Talk is under a current law
enforcement investigation.


I have no position in either CXBT or ICAD and these companies are not related to the rest
of the content in this report.


Two Credible Directors Resign voicing concerns over board independence


At the Dec 18, 2013 shareholder meeting, two credible directors - one the retired Chief
Sales and Marketing Officer at Sprint PCS and the other a 30 year veteran of HSBC - and
both members of the audit committee at the time - resigned in a rare vocal resignation
related to disagreements with the company. More bizarrely the resignations appear to be
coerced, as QAT Investments (the largest shareholder where ETAK's CEO is also its
Chairman) voted against these 2 independent directors. Was the CEO kicking off the truly
independent board members so the fox could guard the henhouse?


From the resignation letters to the company on that date:


I hereby resign as a director of Elephant Talk as a result of differences between
Management and certain minority shareholders and myself regarding the roles and
responsibilities of the independent directors. …I hope that the new Board members
will effectively represent the shareholders and perform the duties required of
independent board members


This is particularly notable given that it appears that the CEO has been participating in
related party financing transactions that appear to have been at least partially the source
of the internal control issues via the improper warrant accounting and associated
restatement [AE1] for the June 30 2013 10-Q. Further - these two coerced resignations
left the company out of compliance in December 2013 with the NYSE as they no longer
had a majority of independent directors.


Reputable auditor BDO is replaced by tiny Squar Milner after repeated internal
control failures


On March 26, 2014, BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") informed Elephant Talk Communications
Corp. (the "Company") that it declined to stand for re-appointment as the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the Company's audit for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2241413-sell-elephant-talk-on-current-law-enforcement-investigation-with-minus-75-percent-downside 4/18


As disclosed in Item 9A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2013, the Company concluded that material weaknesses existed in
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


ETAK has failed to maintain effective internal controls for multiple audits under BDO:


From the 2013 10-K:


In our opinion, Elephant Talk Communications Corp. did not maintain, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013,
based on the COSO criteria.


From the 2011 10-K:


In our opinion, Elephant Talk Communications Corporation did not maintain, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.…These material weaknesses, if not
remediated, create an increased risk of misstatement of the Company's financial
results, which, if material, may require future restatement thereof….


The June 2013 10-Q needed to be restated after internal control issues.


Additionally BDO gave ETAK a "going concern warning" in the March 2014 filed 10-
K:


the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, has an accumulated
deficit of $225.4 million and continues to generate negative cash flows. These
factors, among others discussed in Note 2, raise substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern.


ETAK announced April 1, 2014 that it switched to using the services of Squar Milner,
ranked only 70th out of the top 100 auditors, which is tiny for a public company with the
complex accounting and needs of an international organization like ETAK.


Restating Financials and Related Party Transactions


For the Quarter ended June 30, 2013, ETAK had to restate its financials, increasing its
warrant liabilities from $2,428,919 as originally filed, to $5,291,351 as restated.

Why Does ETAK need to borrow money from insiders and then repay then at 110% of par
- creating a $1,938,597 extinguishing their debt?


Why did ETAK make a loan to insiders and then terminate that loan 2 months later?


Were these transactions why the independent directors resigned and why BDO was
unwilling to continue as ETAK's auditor?


From the 10Q:


Note 14. 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note


On June 11, 2013, Elephant Talk Communications Corp. entered into a Purchase
Agreement with each holder of the Company's Senior Secured Convertible Notes issued
on March 29, 2012 pursuant to which the Company purchased the Convertible Notes at
the purchase price equal to 110% of the aggregate of the outstanding principal amount of
the Convertible Notes and interest due. The aggregate purchase price paid to the holders
of the Convertible Notes was $6,701,824 which was paid out from the proceeds of the
Share Purchase Agreements described under Note 15.


The Purchase Agreement with the note holders resulted in the regular and accelerated
amortization expenses during the second quarter of $349,639 for the (OID) original issue
discount, $1,179,732 for the (CF) conversion feature and $310,995 for the remaining
financing costs of the note. The release of the balance of the fair market value of the
conversion feature resulted in a gain of $451,779. Furthermore the 10% prepayment fee
of $607,538 on the purchase price compared to the net outstanding principal was
recorded as a loss in the income statement as part of the Loss of Extinguishment of Debt.
The total Loss on Extinguishment of Debt was calculated at an amount of
$1,938,597.


Note 15. 12% Unsecured Loan from Affiliate


On May 24, 2013, the Company entered into a certain loan agreement with a member of
its board of directors pursuant to which the Company borrowed a principal amount of
€1,000,000 ($1,290,790) for a period of one year at the interest rate of 12% per
annum ("Loan Agreement") and issued a warrant ("Warrant") to the director to
purchase 1,253,194 restricted shares of Common Stock exercisable at $1.03 per
share for a term of 5 years, with a mandatory cash exercise after 12 months in case the
average closing bid price is $1.55 or higher for 10 consecutive trading days.

Following ASC 470-20 guidance the Company allocated the fair market value, using the
binomial valuation method, of the detachable warrants between equity and debt and
accounted for the debt component separately, with the debt discount off set against paid-in
capital. The debt discount being the initial fair market value of the warrants
amounted to $434,433 and will be amortized using the effective interest method
during the life of the loan.


Subsequent to the above, the Company entered into an amendment on July 14,
2013 to terminate the Loan Agreement, which is more fully described under Note 25
(subsequent events).


Conclusion: NYSE Delisting now at final allowable extension


It appears to me that there Elephant Talk has a lot of explaining to do to its shareholders.
What is this current law enforcement investigation about? Why did the independent
directors truly resign after apparently being voted against by other insiders, voicing their
concerns over board independence?


Will ETAK be delisted on or before November 17th - the final deadline from the NYSE?


Does the NYSE know about the current law enforcement investigation? I wouldn't be
surprised to see ETAK delisted before the deadline.


From their May 15, 2014 PR:


The Company initially received notice from the Exchange on May 17, 2013 indicating
that the Company does not satisfy the continued listing standards of the Exchange
set forth in Section 1003(iv) of the Company Guide in that the Company has
sustained losses which are so substantial in relation to its overall operations
or its existing financial resources, or its financial condition has become so
impaired that it appears questionable, in the opinion of the Exchange, as to
whether the Company will be able to continue operations and/or meet its
obligations as they mature. The Company was afforded an opportunity to submit
its initial plan of compliance to the Exchange, and, on May 31, 2013, the Company
presented its Plan to the Exchange. On June 13, 2013, the Exchange accepted the
Plan and granted the Company an extension until August 31, 2013 along with
subsequent extensions to November 30, 2013, January 31, 2014 and April 30, 2014.

Management is aggressively promoting ETAK stock by attending 8 conferences in the last
12 months and apparently paying third parties to promote their stock in newsletters. A
software company in startup mode requires intense focus and I don't believe it is possible
be successful in a highly competitive market while spending this much time traveling and
pitching investors.


Since 2008, ETAK's revenues have declined by half from $44mm to $22mm in 2013 while
share count has increased roughly 5 TIMES! Cumulative net losses have almost equaled
revenue during this period: $196mm of Net LOSSES in 2008-2013 vs. $209mm of
cumulative revenues.


(This chart is created by me using data directly from SEC filings)


However, I believe these conferences and stock promotions are a key element of ETAK's
ability to collect warrant exercise proceeds as part of the director-related financings ETAK
has pursued to fund continuing net losses.


In the future, the warrant overhang will ensure an increasing supply of shares in the event
that the stock price increases! From the most recent 10Q:


in the event that the common stock trades at a price that is 20% or more above the
exercise price of the RD Warrants for a period of twenty consecutive trading days…,
the Company may require the holder of the RD Warrants to exercise. This would
likely result in substantial further dilution.

ETAK has had significant employee turnover in key roles


In its May, 2014 investor presentation, ETAK highlights its "strong growth outlook for 2014
and beyond." Of course this growth will depend on the team ETAK already has in place at
the company.


In the 2013 10-K, ETAK discloses that it has 195 employees. I checked LinkedIn and was
able to find data on approximately 60% of these employees. Some level of turnover is
normal at any company, but I was surprised to see significant turnover among what
appear to be key employees at the company. Note that this is just a sample of the total
employee turnover.


Specifically, the following people have departed in roughly the last two years or less:


· Chief Commercial Officer (Elephant Talk): Departed March 2012


· Vice President Worldwide Sales (ValidSoft) / Sales Manager Europe (Elephant Talk):
Departed December 2012


· Global Head of Marketing (ValidSoft): Departed April 2014


· Managing Director, Asia Pacific (ValidSoft): Departed May 2012


· Sales Manager, Northern Europe (ValidSoft): Departed April 2013


· Sales Manager, Netherlands Elephant Talk): Departed July 2013


· Senior Software Architect (Elephant Talk): Departed February 2014


· Financial Reporting (SEC) Controller (Elephant Talk): Departed May 2013


Why is it that so many senior sales and marketing people have recently left the company?
Of course ETAK can hire new people, but it takes significant time to ramp new sales
people.


How much of ETAK's consistent revenue decline over the last 3+ years is related to these
seemingly key employees leaving the company?


(Both charts above created by me using SEC filed data)

All in, it is hard for me to have confidence with this turnover and historical revenue decline
that ETAK has a "strong growth outlook for 2014 and beyond"


What is ETAK worth?


In trying to determine a fair value for ETAK, I reviewed public comparables and transaction
comparables data from CapIQ. PhoneFactor was listed as a comparable in ETAK's 2012
10-K.


According to data obtained on CapIQ, at the time of acquisition, PhoneFactor had LTM
revenue of $72m, LTM EBITDA of $29m, and LTM net income of ~$16m. The transaction
price was $250m market cap and $196 EV. The company had total assets of $122m and
total equity of $69m, both substantially in excess of ETAK. This valued PhoneFactor at
2.7x EV/Sales, 6.75x EBITDA, and 15.6x P/E. This seems to be more than a generous
comparable because unlike ETAK, PhoneFactor was significantly profitable, and had 3x
the revenue base (bigger is generally better for acquisition multiples).


Using this valuation, ETAK might be worth ~$0.38 in a similar transaction in an
extremely bullish scenario (based on the financials, ETAK is a lower quality money-
losing asset than PhoneFactor profits).


The math for this is $23m LTM revenue for ETAK times 2.7x = $62m less $7m of net debt
= $55m of market cap, divided by ETAK's 146.7m fully diluted shares outstanding. This is
a value of $0.38 per share.


This is probably too optimistic. For starters, ETAK has lost a tremendous amount of money
over time, is facing NYSE delisting, has internal control issues, a current law enforcement
investigation, and a cloud hanging over the stock due to a noisy director resignation and
employee turnover in key roles. All of these issues would put ETAK at a disadvantage
during a transaction negotiation.


Further, it seems telling in and of itself that Microsoft decided to purchase PhoneFactor
instead of Elephant Talk. Surely even the most bullish ETAK shareholder can concede that
the good people of Microsoft's M&A department have a good idea what they are doing.
Apparently the smart money preferred the PhoneFactor asset to ETAK.


What about public comparables?


The only relatively comparable public company I could find was Amdocs (NYSE:DOX),
which sells for 2.2x EV. Unlike ETAK, DOX has grown its revenue substantially over time,
reduced its share count, and is highly profitable with EBITDA margins in the upper teens

or low 20s.


At 2.2x EV/Sales, ETAK would be valued at $0.30. This is also probably too
optimistic.


In reality, ETAK would likely still sell for a discount in the stock market relative to a much
larger, more liquid public comparable with far fewer issues. In my opinion, a fair public
markets fair value for ETAK would be in the $0.15-0.20 range, assuming the company can
avoid bankruptcy and delisting, and assuming no adverse outcome in the current law
enforcement investigation. This means ETAK has at least 75% downside from the
current price if it remains a public company, assuming it does not go bankrupt.

The author did NOT do his homework! The recent revenue with very low margins declined BY DESIGN - the old
landline legacy revenue was a drag on profitability. That revenue was replaced by wireless revenues with 80%+ profit
MARGINS!!!!!


ETAK was given a contract REPLACING IBM corp with Iusacell in Mexico and Zain mobile in Saudi Arabia. Again,
this business is at 80%+ margins.

Hi Pump Stopper.


What are your views wrt ETAK having 10 sequential quarters of monthly recurring revenue in mobile and
security - their stated strategic areas that represent gross margins in the area of 80%?


The land line business is legacy, non strategic and they are winding it down. Did your research not reveal that
?

The Pump Stopper, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The report isn't about that.


Did your research reveal that the NYSE is considering delisting the company because of its financial condition
and that the company's last auditor had concerns that ETAK may not be a going concern?

Hi Pump Stopper - I am well aware and know this inside out.


The research says they have until late this year to resolve. November 17, 2014 to be exact. That's almost 6
months away.


Company has already publicly stated that they will use their 5 year $50M plus deal with Vodafone spain as
collateral to raise money - probably debt. And of course this will clearly deal with any delisting considerations.
(And this gonores all the otehr good things going on at the comapny)


Of course you know all this - right Pump Stopper?

Read between the lines, the exemption is typical policy and should not be construed as any violation

Are you the one that made the request? Anyone can make a request. You conveniently blocked out the person
making the request. The letter itself says that it is a request for records, nothing more. It specifically says that it does
not mean that any entity is in violation of anything.

Author’s reply »  This is incorrect, a 7A exemption is not used if there is nothing the SEC wants to retain as
confidential. Please call the SEC if you have doubts.

There's no need to call the SEC, we can read and they never said that ETAK was being charged or
investigated of any wrong doing. Therefore, they have no choice but to give a 7A exemption, just in case
there is an investigation. Since they did not confirm or deny, I'd like to know why the second page talks about
an appeal. What are they appealing? Apparently, this is the heart of your scare tactic...by the way...I heard
that you're being investigated.

Hi - this is an interesting article. But it is incomplete and some elements I am not sure are accurate.


Pump Stopper - can you talk to the 10 sequential quarters of monthly recurring revenue in mobile and security that
yields gross margins of ~80%? This is the core strategy of the company as you may know. The land line business is
pure legacy.


Thanks

Please provide the Letter you sent to the SEC so we can see the question to which they respond.


Their response clearly states that the fact that the SEC is not making the information requested public does NOT
constitute an indication of any law enforcement investigation.

I may be wrong but it is my understanding that there is no investigation ongoing by the SEC. Hopefully the company
will respond tonight.


The company has a poor past but that is not a big deal. The company has increased revenues each qtr for 10
consecutive qtrs. The company was nearly cash flow break even last quarter and will be in the 2nd or 3rd qtr. The
company is currently converting the 8 million new customers. These revenues will make the company profitable by
year end.


Does this company have flaws? A few yes. But they are making considerable progress and will likely continue to
increase it's business and turn profits in the next 12 months.


The company issued their 10K about 2 months ago and the 10Q less than a month ago.. If the SEC was investigating
the company they would have been obligated to release that information to the public. I have not seen anything

indicating there is an investigation ongoing.


A more accurate depiction is ETAK is a company with a struggling past that has become a organization on the brink of
profits. A company that has changed it's products and looks to be very successful thus far in their efforts. If the
Mexican contract continues you can anticipate $.20 - .30 cent profits next year. That alone moves the stock to $2-5 a
share and there are additional markets to go after.


I say this company is a buy at this point and those selling today could regret their decision.

The author's title implies that ETAK is under investigation. However, the third paragraph of the FOIA request linked in
the article indicates that it's the SEC's policy to not disclose whether a company is under investigation, regardless of
whether that company is under investigation. It also states that the denial should not be interpreted as meaning any
wrongdoing has occurred. Why did the author leave this critical paragraph out of the article?


ETAKs main revenue source is from its mobile enabling platform. ETAK also has EBITDA margins of about 80
percent, is growing its revenue exponentially, and is almost cash flow positive. As pointed out in the last comment,
ETAK will have positive EPS next year if the lusacell contract continues as expected. Lusacell's CEO anticipates 8
million subscribers on ETAKs platform by the end of 2014. ETAK could generate over $100 million in high margin
revenue in 2015 if it keeps growing as anticipated and have sufficient cash flow for working capital. Why did the
author leave this critical information out of the article?


ETAK received an unqualified opinion on its 2013 10-K. This means there is reasonable assurance that their financial
statements are free of a material misstatement. Why did the author leave this out of the article?

You state that you are short on ETAK. This indicates that you will need to buy it back at some point. Why would you
buy back a stock when you have so little faith in current management?

ETAK is positioned very strongly for future growth. If you are new to this stock, use this opportunity to load up on a
very undervalued stock with many pps building announcements on the verge of being announced.

Although I believe this article made some irresponsible assumptions, I did sell my shares in the light of its very
negative slant and I don't think the indictment of management is entirely uncalled for, as it has been very poor at
keeping investors informed. Despite the bounce I believe it could drift down before Oct. and that will be a better time
to assess the company's progress.


30 May 2014, 11:51 PM

Why would you ever make a move on this articles negative slant? It was a bogus article designed to drive the
stock into a short-frenzy. Look at the fundamentals of the ETAK competitive position and how it will play out
over the next 4 quarters. As for the CEO, he has to perform and I think he knows that.


31 May 2014, 11:52 AM


zorionak
You may be right about the overall prospects of ETAK, but November is still a long time and although I don't
usually overreact to this kind of bashing, all my stocks are small cap and subject to similar volatility. The
difference here is management doesn't seem responsive to investor interests and I can put my my money in
other niche small-caps where I have more faith in the overall business plan. Also, the turnover is a red flag.


01 Jun 2014, 09:36 AM

How can you say that management is not responsive? They SUCCESSFULLY engineer the move out of old,
legacy systems into a new PLATFORM of mobile at 80%+ margins with the next 4 quarters promising
incredible value to stockholders...and an article as poorly researched as this one. Let me know the other
stocks that you think have a better plan over the next 4 quarters - please!!!

baggers. Anyone can see my interests by going to my profile(mostly energy niche stocks). Among the more
important things I look for is order backlog and transparency. There was no Q&A in ETAK's Q1 report. This
was another red flag. There may be a nice backlog but how is an outsider going to know about possible
problems without a cross examination of the quarterly report from people who know the industry better? This
does not mean that ETAK doesn't have a good product but it does suggest a problem with management
which I don't find with other companies at similar valuations. Sorry, I don't believe in hero CEOs.


02 Jun 2014, 11:17 AM


Fusion Investor, Contributor
I would argue with you on the point of the turnover as a red flag. The author only pointed out the turnover but did not
mention any of the new hires. Elephant talk has gone through a significant restructuring with shifting its core business
lines (shift to mobile). The company appears to be operating just fine with the staff they have. Perhaps the employees
who left the company weren't essential to the new ETAK and a more efficient cost structure has been created as a
result. If the CEO/CFO or other key members of management had departed, I would consider this a red flag. But this
is not the case.


ETAK management may not be as responsive to shareholders as you would like but if the company experiences huge
revenue growth at 80 percent plus margins and achieves positive earnings, who cares? Investors pay up big time for
future earnings growth. Although November is far away, the time to be taking a position is now in anticipation of the
earnings growth.


01 Jun 2014, 08:56 PM


zorionak
I will look at it in another month if there is evidence of more transparency from management and if the
valuation doesn't exceed my sale. If it does, I may have lost out, but there are plenty of places to put my
money where I have more faith in management.

@ The Pump Stopper, -75% how is that working out for you? time of article .86, .97 last, spike over 1.20 along the
way.

@The Pump Stopper, how about an update to your article? Did you maintain your short, if you did I give you credit for
holding through that rip. Has your thesis unfolded the way you thought or is ATT/ Mexico the culprit?

Not much of an answer, after writing such a long article I thought you would offer more insight into you original thesis

Author’s reply »  mudpuppet,


I try to share my research for the public good and point out issues I believe people do not understand or are being
misled on.


You and everyone else in here attacked and heckled me for whatever reason. Now ETAK stock has swiftly lost more
than half its value, during a raging bull market, and anyone who ignored the facts has lost a lot of money. you can not
say you weren't warned. It seems to me that everyone here chose to blindly believe management rather than
objectively analyze the facts. So excuse me if I don't feel like going out of my way to explain everything, again, for all
of the people here who are offensive and dismissive.


In summary, I think you have all learned some very important lessons here you should never forget:


1. DON'T EVER BET AGAINST PLUNGEY


2. you are all likely better off indexing or putting your money in mutual funds


In closing, this was classic "shoot the messenger" and instead of acknowledging the facts you all attacked me.
Instead of being upset with me you should direct your anger at your horrific financial loss towards management of this
company as I did my best to help you.


good day.

Funny how agitated you get, sounds like you need to grow a thicker skin to be a contributor. Don't bet against the
'plungey' meaning you? Go easy on the victory lap as you got your steam rolled on your call for months. How much of
your article seemed to be the reason for the drop? Thats why I asked if you were planing a follow up on ATT deal. Not
much volume on the drop from 80 cents I would suspect it isn't going to take much to take it back. On the 31 we will
know more.
