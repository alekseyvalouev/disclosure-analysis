TRUP


Trupanion sent a nationwide email to Veterinarian Clinics announcing the
discontinuation of the Trupanion Rewards program on October 29th.


The next day the company released a statement whereby TRUP said that "they do
not anticipate any changes to our business practices.".


Not only does this event bolster my concerns regarding the regulatory status of the
sales channel, but it also calls into question management's candor with investors
about serious issues.


I will follow up with an additional article later this to discuss the longer term
implications of this action, for now I present the news.


On Tuesday (October 30th) NASDAQ:TRUP put out the press release and 8-k below.

But The Day Before, Monday October 29th, Vet Payments Were
Discontinued

A few highlights:


"In our ongoing efforts to be transparent, we are providing an update on the status
of our business."


"We have had discussions with regulators on these topics, and, as of today, we
have no reason to believe that any state regulator believes that our business model
violates the letter, or spirit, of insurance regulations with respect to these issues.
Furthermore, we have no expectation that we will need to change our business
practices."


"We have no reason to believe that their opinion differs from ours, or that any
changes to our business practices will be required."

Conclusion


Source: The Capitolist


I'm sure there is a legal explanation as to why the company is allowed to post an 8-K
that seems to be in direct conflict with a nationwide decision made just 24 hours prior.
The legality of the statement, questionable as it may be, really doesn't matter to me. I
see no reason why a company would discontinue a relatively inexpensive rewards
program unless it ran afoul of state laws, which is consistent with my assertions of
multiple infractions throughout the sales funnel are in fact accurate.


Furthermore, while it may be legal to release the 8-K above (just 24 hours after
discontinuing one of the practices that has been criticized) it is not behavior that is
consistent with the intention of being "transparent" with investors. If the first sentence of
a "business update" release can not be relied upon how should we treat the remainder
of the claims/statements?

It's good to see the company be proactive about becoming compliant: now TRUP just
needs to find a way to get over the inherent risk that their software may be violating
solicitation laws by not allowing the vet to instantly offer multiple insurance carriers.
