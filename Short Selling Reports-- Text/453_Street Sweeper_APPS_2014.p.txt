Mandalay Digital Group: An Overhyped Master Of Positive Spin
Aug. 27, 2014 7:00 AM ET70 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Mandalay has yet to provide any major details about a celebrated deal that sparked
its powerful rally, allowing the hype to build - and its shares to soar - instead.


Big sellers have gladly unloaded millions of shares of Mandalay stock since the
company announced that mysterious deal.


With its stock rocketing to a multi-year high, Mandalay seems very tempted to carry
out another dilutive secondary offering, after raising a fresh pile of cash earlier this
year.


Give Mandalay Digital Group (MNDL) credit for this much, at least. While the bleeding
technology firm still needs to prove itself, the company has definitely mastered the art of
positive spin.


A recent penny stock that spent years constantly reinventing itself in a desperate attempt
to merely survive, Mandalay may have just pulled off its most impressive transformation
yet. Suddenly worth more than $200 million - before clearing its first dime - Mandalay has
practically doubled in value over the course of two short weeks, with the help of some
tantalizing, if temporary, hype.


Just don't expect those breathtaking gains to actually last.


Worth barely $3 a share ahead of its latest quarterly miss, Mandalay has since rocketed to
a multi-year high of $6 a share after announcing a celebrated deal with Verizon
(NYSE:VZ) and delaying the release of crucial details while the ensuing hype sent its
stock on a powerful tear. With Mandalay encouraging investors to hope for the best, they
have responded by allowing their imaginations to literally run wild. Clearly sold on the
stock and expecting it to gain even further ground, one bullish hedge fund manager
recently stepped forward to ridicule the so-called "moron" who chose to slash his massive
position in the company despite exciting news of the celebrated Verizon deal.


"Who the hell is selling at these prices in light of this news?" the hedge fund manager
recently demanded, before declaring, "Why should we care?"

"Worrying about who is selling or how much more is coming for sale is extremely short-
sighted when we know we have a deal in hand that completely changes everything. (So)
waiting for the 'cleanup' trade is rather pointless, given where it should be trading when
the world wakes up to what is occurring…"


"The size and the scope of the VZ announcement is almost too big to fathom. But make
no mistake: It is huge."


Really? How do you know? So far, even Mandalay itself has yet to determine - or at least
divulge - the true value of that mysterious deal.


You're probably right about one thing, however. The identity of the recent seller doesn't
really matter. Ask yourself a far more relevant question: Why did that big Mandalay
shareholder chose to dump all of that stock, instead of holding out for even sweeter gains
or - better yet - buying some more of the high-flying shares?


Let's go back to the conference call that sparked this incredible rally in the first place and
search for some possible hints. An expert at translating overblown hype,
TheStreetSweeper has carefully read between the lines to uncover plenty of revealing
clues.


Hidden Messages


Management Hype: "We have signed a multi-year agreement with Verizon on their
intentions to deploy Ignite across their entire Android device line-up, which historically has
averaged approximately 20 million devices per year. (Nevertheless), we're not here to
update or change the guidance. I agree it's hard to see announcing Verizon is a negative,
that's for sure… In the big picture, this is a major milestone for our business and validation
of our broader strategy."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Trust us. This is fantastic news. Without that last-minute
deal, we would have simply reported another quarterly shortfall instead. So what if we see
no reason to boost the full-year guidance that we set before we ever landed that surprising
deal? Be patient. The pesky details can wait. Right now, it's time to celebrate!


Management Hype: "We're in the process of evaluating the near- and longer-term positive
impact of the Verizon expansion and look forward to providing you with an update as to
what this means to our fiscal 2015 guidance, as well as some insight and perspective into
fiscal 2016. We will work to come back to you within the next 30 days with more
specifics… One of the things we want to do is we want to improve how we continue to
manage the Street, manage expectations, and we continue to really want to work at that

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2452865-mandalay-digital-group-an-overhyped-master-of-positive-spin 3/23


… We want to really do this in a holistic way. So when we come back and give guidance,
we also want to have you guys think about fiscal '16 as well. We haven't really talked
about that, (but) now we have got some better visibility as to what that means for the
business."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Listen. If we really expected the Verizon deal to bolster our
results anytime soon, we would probably go ahead and increase our existing forecast right
now. We obviously chose to keep our mouths shut - and allow investors to keep their
wildest hopes alive - for a little while longer instead. Now sit back and wait for the
speculative hype to build. We stand to gain so much ground by the time that we release
any concrete details about this celebrated deal that even if we follow up with a
disappointing update, we could still come out well ahead in the end. Heck, we might
double on the anticipation alone.


Management Hype: "We believe that our current cost structure is sufficient to ramp and
scale our existing business and, while we do not expect material increases in operating
costs, as previously noted, we will be back to you with a more refined view once we fully
incorporate the expanded Verizon deal."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: We hate to even mention the potential risk of additional
dilution at this point, since our share count has practically doubled over the course of the
past year. We had no idea that we might need the sort of funds required to execute this
big Verizon deal when we last tapped the capital market six months ago, though. So don't
rule out the possibility of an imminent stock offering. Given all of the cash that we burn just
to finance our normal operations, we can't expect the $19 million left in our bank account
to last forever, you know.


Management Hype: "We raised capital in March with the exclusive purpose of helping us
continue to scale our business. We have been disciplined in our approach, having passed
on a few opportunities where we could not come to valuation terms that are in the best
interest of our business or shareholders. There are a couple of potential acquisitions that
we're excited about, but nothing to report on today. We know that we're in active
conversations and hope to have some news to report soon on the M&A (merger and
acquisition) front."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Forget it. We can't afford to sacrifice this tantalizing
opportunity. Just think of all the money that we could raise by selling a mountain of our
stock if it surges on news of this Verizon deal! We're not exactly flush with cash at the

moment, anyway. We'll find some way to spend that money - probably sooner rather than
later. Why on earth should we wait around until we're actually desperate? We need to
make the most of this situation while we still can.


Management Hype: "We do not view the past quarter as the new normal, as far as the
historical business, but rather just as a small and rapidly growing business making short-
term tradeoffs… We were disappointed but not surprised by the results, as they were not
materially off our internal budget. This quarter's results do not impact our view of the fiscal
year, as we have been consistent that the ramp for our new products was to begin this
summer, and the first quarter did not include any revenue from those launches. We
continue to reiterate our guidance for 12 million Ignite installs and 1 million IQ installs"
during the current year.


TheStreetSweeper Translation: Don't bother dwelling on our latest quarterly results. We
found the year-over-year deterioration in several of our key financial metrics rather
depressing ourselves. Who cares if we fell short of Wall Street expectations again? What's
another miss at this point? Now that we landed this fantastic deal with Verizon, we remain
on track to achieve our targets for the full year. We just averted a possible disaster!


Management Hype: "Verizon has been very pleased with the performance of Ignite on the
LG G3 smart phone, which launched on July 17… We expect launching Ignite on two
additional smart phones and one tablet with Verizon over the next 45 days. (We're) not
going to communicate any information that's proprietary to Verizon on device sell-through
for a specific device. We're not going to go there. What I will say, though, is that a lot of
device sales, whether it's from LG, Samsung, HTC or anybody (is) very seasonally driven.
The number-two month for device sales tends to be August, after December, in terms of
back-to-school and people doing upgrades and so on. It's not traditionally July, as a lot of
people are on vacation and doing other things. With that being said, Verizon gave us a
forecast on the device based on their experience with the G2. So I think we have got
pretty good visibility in terms of what we think that is."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: We can't expect this Verizon deal to suddenly transform
our company into an overnight sensation. After supplying Ignite for a single Verizon
cellphone with a low adoption rate for applications in general, we're just glad that the
company has decided to use our product on a few more of its devices at this point. Why
did that annoying analyst have to mention the weak adoption rate for that cellphone,
anyway? We wound up sort of contradicting ourselves by blaming seasonality and hinting
at a likely burst in activity this quarter, since we specifically warn of a slowdown during that
quarter in our official corporate filings instead. We probably shouldn't have mentioned that

stuff about Verizon providing us with "pretty good visibility" into the performance of that
particular device, either. What if investors leap to the understandable conclusion that
Verizon has provided us with some decent insight into the new business that we just
landed, too? Oh well. Maybe nobody will bother to connect the dots. We can probably
count on investors to take us at our word. It's not like they're demanding answers right
now, anyway.


Management Hype: "There are numerous new potential customers that we expect to close
and announce over the next 90 days and a few existing customers wanting to deploy
additional services as well. While we're not going to preannounce any of these deals, like
we have in the past, the bottom line is there is strong momentum in the marketplace for
our products and services, and we're taking advantage of that."


TheStreetSweeper Translation: We realize that this celebration won't last forever. We just
hope that we can follow up with another deal that's at least worth mentioning soon. After
spoiling the market with this big Verizon contract, we've set the bar for the future a whole
lot higher, though. Who knows when we will ever spark this much excitement again? So
let's just celebrate today and worry about possible headaches tomorrow. We fully intend to
savor this intoxicating buzz as long as we can, even if we risk paying it for it with a
massive hangover.

No position in this name yet. Funny how this article was actually released 2 days ago! A little late for seeking alpha!
Sounds like this company is the real deal. Very prudent of management after announcing Verizon as a top customer
to wait a few weeks to release the financial details don't you think? Management of a publicly traded company would
not name drop a Fortune 500 company Verizon without a signed contract! But this news sounds really big. Ignite
software will also be adopted by T-Mobile. This company sounds like they are a diamond in the rough. Will buy MNDL
at the open! Thanks for the idea! 
This management team sounds like an all star team!

This stock is a very strong buy. The contract with Verizon is new and fresh and signed. 
The company is prudent not to make wild statements about earnings etc. Presumably if they did the article would
attack them for that.


An overblown report from a desperate short.


27 Aug 2014, 08:23 AM


mikeasa
Volume supported this move higher. Reviewing the past few weeks trading detail. Institutional accumulation was
behind this move. This is anything but a short name. Shorts are getting slammed after this move higher and with
names like Verizon and T-Mobile using Mandalay Digiital's "operating system" ignite is a win win strategy. This is
exactly the type of company that you wish you knew about at these price levels before the triple digits. This reminds
me of another software company CNQR that I sold way to soon from the single digits in the 30's many years ago now
trading at over $100.

This article hit the stock via their website briefly yesterday AM and had no real impact. Author is short as you can see
in the disclosure. Their argument is extremely flawed.


Re. VZ, do the math. They sell 20 mln Android phones per year. 20 mln phones x 4 slots x $2 per install = $160 mln
opportunity. The open rates are probably 60%-70% and while we don't know what type of revenue share there may
be, it's quite clear this relationship is game changing for the company. The # of slots could be conservative too.
TMobile is the same opportunity with 7-8 mln phones. Same story with SingTel in Asia. The platform is not speculative
at this point. Validation has occurred and as the #'s are digested, models should reflect an extremely profitable
company come FY16 (starting next April).

Why do carriers want this? They are facing pricing pressure competitively as prices come down for service almost
everywhere. The carrier is not participating in the most important aspect of mobile growth, which is the apps and
related advertising opportunity. There were rumors this week that VZ may start their own app store which would not
be completely surprising, although something Mandalay can definitely help with as well. Regardless, Mandalay allows
them to recapture part of this revenue stream and there is no reason VZ, T, or any other carrier should be giving it
away to GOOG or AAPL unless they have to (which they do not).


Carrier billing is a huge opportunity for mobile over the next few years.

This article does nothing at all to explain why the author believes the Mandalay's actual business model is flawed.


Mandalay REALLY HAS developed a platform that provides carriers like Verizon with the tools it needs to regain some
control of the revenue stream from mobile and is poised to see large revenue growth. However, we need to actually
see the numbers put up. Despite the authors implication that the call was lacking details, I thought this exchange was
pretty informative:


Jon Hickman - Ladenburg Thalmann 
I’m a little impressed with -- I am pretty impressed with this Verizon opportunity here. Could I maybe press out a few
numbers on the phone? I know it's on the fly but I just want to make sure I’m thinking about it right. Did Verizon sold
say somewhere between 20 million and 25 million Android devices a year and you have got four slot on each slot on
each phone, that’s 80 million slots that’s somewhere around $2 a piece. So we’re looking at revenues more than a
$150 million a year. I guess am I thinking about that correctly?


Andrew Schleimer 
Yes Jon, you’re definitely thinking about it correctly assuming that the open rates on those slots are a 100%. So right
now -- you got to take some hair cut for the open rates on that but I think the market opportunity that you’re talking
about is accurate.


Any readers who want to learn about the platform that Mandalay has created can find out more in an article I wrote a
few months back: http://seekingalpha.co... Just rememeber the author is correct in one respect, until the revenue
numbers are put up they are just projections but to me this looks very interesting.

Excellent article from March. Really looking forward to a long overdue update!?


27 Aug 2014, 10:02 AM


Wall Street Titan, Marketplace Contributor
Thanks mikeasa. I just love this scalable business model. If the revenues start ramping up as the company
projects, investors will flock to it, IMHO.

This was one of the most juvenile "hit" pieces I've ever read. It is complete spin, and poorly written at that.


I'm actually surprised Seeking Alpha published this at all.

letsmakemoney
There are two important catalysts on the n/t horizon: 1) company guidance to reflect F15/16 impact, within the next 3-
4 weeks. 2) joint PR with Verizon.


The numbers will speak loudly for themselves, and the sell side reaction should be material, with F16 EPS moving
north of $0.60 and F17 north of $1.00. If you look at their existing models, this is just basic, conservative math. Attach
a 20-30 multiple to that growth, and you can appreciate why it has been aggressively accumulated since the news.


The Verizon PR will broadcast this relationship to the telecom world and create a halo effect with other carriers. This
news will push ATT, which already uses Ignite via their Cricket acquisition, to follow in Verizon's footsteps and
accelerate their plans to role out Ignite across their platform as well. Signing all of ATT is just a matter of timing.


Shorts should be wary of both upcoming catalysts. This is a very dangerous short in my view, as the downside has
been eliminated from the story.

deal with Verizon has not had all the details released? Gimme a break. All I can say is look at the SA articles written
by people smarter than me who have been investing and/or speculating for a looong time. They are bullish.

The Verizon deal is monumental. The shorts will just add MOMO to the buying frenzy in the shares as both
companies issue a joint press release and a conference call to follow within the next week! This is huge! Very happy
to get in before this really starts to move!

If any doubts about whose running this company and why they got Verizon. Please refer to the company website and
review the impressive bio's of the insiders.. very impressive.. then review the board of directors who are a whose who
starting with Peter Guber chairman of the board.


27 Aug 2014, 01:44 PM


watch out below
Can anyone really tell me what Digital Turbine actually does? I've heard all about the company getting paid $2/slot,
but wouldn't that revenue go to Verizon? Why does Verizon need MNDL to sell preloaded slots for bloatware? The
whole story sounds totally suspect and overhyped to me. I've followed this company for years, and they have
consistently over promised and underdelivered. They've lost 10s of milliions of dollars, have never made a dime, and
yet we have touts like Wall St Titan and Mikeasa hyping the stock. It looks like a pump and dump to me...so watch out
below...


27 Aug 2014, 03:22 PM

no ones pumping anything. 1st time I heard about this company was from this article! BTW this is a short

RUN THE STOCK UP SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.

FYI When your a trader there will be losses. Neonode hasn't worked out yet but it will.  
Shorts were right for the time being.


But this company has nothing to do with the other. i just purchased shares yesterday based upon this short report
which is absolutely baseless.


This company is on a much different path.


I will add an additional 25K shares this morning to increase my position to 50K shares!

Mandalay Digial is taking over the carrier market 
Verizon. T-Mobile. ATT next.


This is not even a trade an intelligent short seller would even attempt. Too many up and coming catalysts which will
drive the stock significantly higher in the next few weeks!

okey dokey
Streetsweeper- google them and you can see the "credentials" of their boss.


VERY DISTURBING. The same sex dynamic duo who write for them are highly questionable, especially the authors.
The fact that the authors never respond to questions should raise a red flag. One of them worked with Cramer, there
is a picture of her and Cramer hugging. That they are allowed to post this garbage is indicative of the standards that
SeekingAlpo accepts.

I wasn't aware of the StreetSweeper/ Cramer connection, although a few weeks back I was long FCEL for a trade and
I found it 'coincidental' that the day after StreetSweeper bashed it Cramer felt compelled to dump on it the very next
morning. Hmmmm.....

So, they make a deal, plan a teleconference to assess details. Publish a date and stick to it. Then the call has
extremely good guidance. Ya think the guys (girls) posting the original article had a short position? Or just were not
very good? What's this I see about an SEC investigation into these guys (girls). I am long and will stay long. Sorry to
all who read the article and thought these people had a clue. Now, wait for the analyst upgrades.


10 Sep 2014, 10:58 AM


watch out below
Almost no new information on the call, and they actually *lowered* their guidance for this fiscal year to $44m - $48m
in revenue. Keep in mind that they did $5.5m in revs for their first quarter ended June 30 of this year. So that means
they have 3 quarters left to do $39m in revs, which means they have to average $13m/quarter just to hit their
guidance. Given the track record of the company, it seems extremely unlikely that they will hit their guidance for this
year. I predict they will miss by a VERY WIDE margin, blame it on something, push the numbers out, etc. Maybe
they'll announce some meaningless acquisition to shift focus away from the actual business.


The other really troubling thing about the call is that they would not divulge any details on their Verizon deal, even
after repeated questions from the analysts. Why can't they give us an idea what the rev share is on the CPI deals?
Why can't they tell us what the open rates are on the first phone (the G3 that shipped in July)? Shouldn't they be able
to look at the open rates for that phone and extrapolate them for the expected 20m andoid phones that Verizon will
sell? The answer is that of course they know what the deal terms and numbers are, they just don't want to share them
because it will be crystal clear that their guidance is pie in the sky!


Finally, there are clearly quite a number of touts trying to pump up the price of this stock. These people (mikeasa, Wall
St Titan for example) don't seem to know much about the company, but are so convinced the stock is going to the
moon. If you are a retail investor in this stock, you should be very careful...it's a penny stock and easily manipulated.
When this thing goes way down, you won't be able to say you weren't warned.


Watch out below!!!!


10 Sep 2014, 12:55 PM


Wall Street Titan, Marketplace Contributor
Can any of the bashers please explain what, if any issues you have with Mandalay's business model. I wrote
an article because the company's story makes a hell of a lot of sense. Put simply it, Mandalay is providing the
weapons to wireless carriers to regain control of their customers. Why would anyone short that business
model? Google and Facebook have been riding on the backs of Verizon's infrastructure and why shouldn't
Verizon share in the wealth that would not exist without all their efforts? Instead of saying some are pumping
please provide defendable views on why Mandalay's business model is flawed. I don't think any of the
bashers can make an intelligent case.

The first para that quotes theStreetSweeper talks about how the forward guidance is not being updated. The as you
read the management speak more they do refer to providing an updated guidance. This seems like cherrypicking on
the part of the theStreetSweeper and consequently on the part of the author to rely so heavily on one site.

made the most persuasive arguments about this stock. Any company that has their CEO leave, doesn't issue a press
release or tell anyone and tries to bury the news in an 8K looks extremely shady! This is a classic warning sign, and
any experienced investor knows this. It's investing 101.


rcoker - Umm, so what if I haven't commented about any other stocks. What's your point? I happen to know a lot
about MNDL and have done a lot of research. So I'm posting here so everyone can benefit from what I know. As far
as CEO resignation, the company filed an 8K yesterday that officially announced that the CEO was resigning. The
CEO did NOT resign before the Verizon deal, which was announced months ago. No lies here. Oh, and you aren't
long this stock? I find that hard to believe....


16 Sep 2014, 12:28 PM


DScher, Contributor
watch out below and mike are similarly useless. Neither of you have added a shred of value to the discussion
here.


CEO change has been in the cards for months, as discussed at investor day. If you had actually "done a lot of
research" you would know that.


16 Sep 2014, 12:54 PM


watch out below
Show me one news article or press release that says that Peter Adderton is stepping down as CEO of
Mandalay Digital. Until the 8K was made public this week, I had not seen or heard anything about him
leaving. Maybe insiders like you knew it was in the works, but since you are biased and just trying to pump
the stock, you just try to brush it under the rug.


It's astounding to me that there STILL has not been an article or news item about Adderton stepping down.
Why did he step down? Did the board fire him or did he voluntarily give up the CEO position. These are all
important questions that any investor would want to have answers to. The fact that the company didn't
address them is very very troubling.

watch out below - So here is a quote from me earlier "I have a long position in the stock, so I am talking my book
here, but the biggest complaint appears to be that a huge deal with Verizon has not had all the details released?
Gimme a break."


So, now that I have cleared that up for you, can you tell us how large your short position is?

...and here is the info from the filing that you find so scary:


On September 9, 2014, Mandalay Digital Group, Inc. (the “ Company ”) and William Stone, 46, entered into an
employment agreement (the " Stone Agreement ") pursuant to which Mr. Stone, currently the President and Chief
Operating Officer of the Company and the President of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Digital Turbine, Inc.,
will become the Chief Executive Officer of the Company not later than October 2, 2014 (the “ Transition Date ”), with
the specific date to be determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee.


Peter Adderton is the Company’s current Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to his existing employment agreement
with the Company, Mr. Adderton’s role as Chief Executive Officer can, at the election of the Company’s Board of
Directors (the “ Board ”), be changed from the Chief Executive Officer to the Company’s Chief Innovation Officer at
any time after October 1, 2014. 


16 Sep 2014, 12:44 PM


watch out below
This is from the 8K that they filed yesterday. They are disclosing that Bill Stone will take over as CEO by Oct 2, 2014
and Peter Adderton is stepping down to become Chief Innovation Office (whatever that is lol). This information
became public yesterday, and the agreement for Stone to become CEO happened a week ago. Just because the
board had the right to push out Adderton as CEO any time after Oct 1, 2014, doesn't mean they had to do it. And they
gave no indication that a change was in the works. It appears to have come out of the blue, and the company has still
not given an explanation as to why they made the change. Again, these are all classic warning signs of big trouble.
Why is Adderton stepping down? My guess is that he knows the company will never make its numbers. It also may
allow him to start dumping his shares in the company before retail investors find out how bad things are.


Good to know you are long the stock. You implied that you didn't have a position in your last post by saying "Go long,
go short - I don't care.". Good luck with that, I hope you get out while the gettin's good....

Fellow investors, please read and enjoy. 
LOOK HOW HARD THE SHORTS ARE WORKING!! I am new to this board, not new to MNDL at all, and totally
entertained by this thread :) It's simple market psychology, shorts are scared, and in turn, they are trying to instill
FEAR into investors so they can manipulate stock price downward and contribute to their own personal short gain.
We all know this, they could care less about anyone else, especially us longs! Now, for some real insight into recent
management changes and some valuable info.... 
In terms of Peter Adderton simply moving around, I think that was a VERY smart move, and yes, it was discussed at
the investor relation day in July, in addition, it was part of his revised contract as of 9/2013. I tried looking into older

news but could not go that far back to find the 8-K. I simply remember it being posted on my brokers news feed and I
read it. That you will have to simply take my word on. Peter was contracted to bring on a MAJOR US TIER 1
CARRIER, DONE. Do some DD and actually research these guys.  
In addition, LOOK UP Peter Addertons BIO: http://bit.ly/1sqdq3f  
You think these deals were made out of thin air? You think that a deal with Sprint Nextel etc. etc. is not in the cards for
the future based on managements connections? These are the big boys! Peter is a MULTI-MILLIONAIRE (if not
billionaire) from his sale of BoostMobile, who can afford to have a nice cushy position and continue to use his
business connections to provide MNDL with future contracts! 
Now, I am only going to quote PART of Bill Stone's BIO, but I hope you guys/gals get the picture here. Bill is the guy
we want in charge, Bill has secured most of these big deals. 
Bill Stone (our new CEO as of 10/2/2014) - "He has an extensive background in carrier relations, wireless, content,
marketing and distribution, having worked at several companies, including GTE Wireless, AirTouch Cellular,
Vodafone, VERIZON and Amp'd Mobile. As product development director at AirTouch Cellular, Mr. Stone led the
efforts in launching the first CDMA technology and pre-pay offering in the United States. He served as Chief
Executive Officer of Handango, Inc. from November 2007 to February 2009 and President until February 2009. He
served as VICE PRESIDENT of VERIZON WIRELESS, where he was responsible for strategy, planning, mobile
content, music, e-commerce, and a variety of marketing functions including CRM, segmentation, pricing and
promotion. He served as Chief Marketing Officer for Vodafone in Australia and Japan. He led all branding, promotion,
pricing and product marketing activities. He also served as chief marketing officer of J-Phone Tokyo (currently
Softbank Mobile), where he helped launch the first SMS, web browsing, ringtone, picture messaging and color
devices in Japan. He served as a Director of Handango, Inc".  
Link: http://buswk.co/1sqdq3j


Did you all catch that "VP @ VERIZON WIRELESS" part? This is not insider info, this is simply called doing your DD,
and ignoring the noise. 
BILL STONE, our soon to be CEO, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WHOLE VERIZON CONTRACT and through his
extensive experience both domestically and globally he will lead this company to MORE deals/contracts through the
business relationships and connections he has made throughout the years. I believe installs on all Android phone and
yes, I believe APPLE/Windows Phone will come soon after.  
This is a budding company with a solid/very desirable business model.


Just for some advice to new investors, shorts tried to do this at $1.50, $2.50, $3.50, they freaked at $4.10 when
MNDL did their capital raise, and we are now over $5. Again, ignore the noise, this is a solid company with impressive
management. Lastly, I have a friend who works for Digital Turbine EMEA in Tel Aviv, Israel and another friend who
works for Digital Turbine EMEA in Germany, word is they are hiring, its that simple, they are growing fast.  
Management knows what they are doing. I have been holding since $2 and do not plan on selling anytime soon. I also
have this in my sons IRA, my son is not even two years old yet, he can use it to help with his college tuition.


Yes, we are looking at $10-12 short/medium term and $20+ Long term. BULLISH/LONG.


Stay strong, ignore the negativity/fear mongering/volatility and enjoy the ride up!


This is a one of those companies you want to own for the long term, you will see.


Best to all!

Here's a little story about Peter Adderton and Amp'd, which he founded and went down in flames, losing investors
$360 MILLLION. Yes, 360 Million dollars! Adderton has a terrible track record, investors beware...


This is from Venture Beat:


"Amp’d Mobile, the hard-charging mobile content company that raised $360 million only to burn through it all and
crash into bankruptcy, continues to surprise.


We’re now hearing from people familiar with Amp’d strategy that its mistake was to change its credit check policy, in a
foolhardy effort to boost subscribers. The company’s founder chief executive, Peter Adderton, known for dashing in
and out of Los Angeles with a helicopter, searched his business for bottlenecks to the company’s growth. The big one
he found: Credit checks. While his company’s carrier partner, Verizon, checked customers’ credit to make sure they
had enough cash to pay their bills within 30 days, Amp’d decided to relax the requirement to 90 days for its own
network.


So Amp’d marketed like crazy to these riskier people with lower credit ratings, got them all signed up, and then 90
days later — oops — found that something like half of them were having trouble making their payments, many of
heading into collections, according to our source. We’ve contacted the company for comment, and will update.


Adderton has since been ousted. But what were Amp’d Mobile’s multiple investors — including Highland Capital
Partners, Columbia Capital Equity Partners Vivendi/Universal Music Group and MTV Networks — thinking? How did
they let him get away with such a careless strategy, especially when it was well known virtual network operators in the
past, including ESPN’s had so much trouble?


Two days ago, a peeved Verizon Wireless, which was letting Amp’d use its cellular network, asked a court to let it kick
off Amp’d from its network. It said Amp’d is burning through $370,000 a day since filing for bankruptcy in June, and
still hadn’t come up with a loan to pay the millions it owes Verizon for usage of its network. Amp’d Mobile will have just
$9,000 in cash by this coming Monday, Verizon said."

tremendous success story and now has Bill Stone as the CEO (who landed the $100M+ a year Verizon deal)


Shorts are in trouble. MNDL has a strong balance sheet $20 mil cash. zero debt. 100-200%+ growth rate.

mikeasa is way off. MNDL is burning through cash and had they not raised the $20 million months ago (using
baseless projections) they would have already run out of money.


A large chunk of stock was issued to Trinad Management Company for "services" and insider structured
deals at very low cost. That management company cannot sell fast enough. Nearly $10 million of stock.


This is not about shorts panicking in the least. It is about promoters trying to keep the game going and retail
investors who were duped engaging in wishful thinking.

readthefilings: I have read all the filings I can find. Can you explain how you came up with rapid cash burn numbers? I
don't see the facts to support it. I would love to. 
The only SEC Form 4 that I can find shows Trinad selling MNDL at the beginning for the year in the $4 range (several
million $) before acquiring MNDL stock in April/May "at a very low cost". I see no insider selling by them after that
point. Can you share where you found all this selling activity? Also, I only see 1 million not 10 million. I cannot find
your information in any of the the filings.

The pot calling the kettle black? You didn't know about the change in leadership before it was 8k'd even
though many others did.


Those sales were all early on in the year, Trinidad still holds $12m+ in stock, and you will also note that a
director bought 70k shares in late July.

The short case here is about as hollow as can be regarding a company just entering their inflection point. The
company guided for full Q3 EBITDA break-even and the numbers should turn up from there.

(several million $) before acquiring MNDL stock in April/May "at a very low cost"."


What you cut and pasted looks like new information, but it isn't.


Wait your quote says exactly what I said.


YOU MEAN THESE GUYS SOLD STOCK IN Q1 OF THIS YEAR? I AM PANICKED HERE IN SEPTEMBER THAT
THEY SOLD STOCK IN FIRST 4 MONTHS OF THE YEAR. 
There that was my point (/sarc)


All this happened before they acquired shares "at a very low cost". To clarify for you, when I said beginning of the
year, I should have said for the easily confused, I should have said "mostly in Q1 of the year" and "the months before
the April/May stock acquisition at a low cost".


Where is all the selling after the acquisition "at low cost"? It looks like from your data, they still own it. WHAT, THEY
OWN STOCK STILL?? SOMEONE TELL THEM. SAVE THEM FROM PENURY.


Why is it that they own all these cheap shares still?

Down 9% today. Verus downgraded them to strong sell. Can't wait until they release their Sept quarter earnings.
Today is the last day of the quarter and I'm sure the numbers are ugly. This stock has a lot more to fall. Fair value is
about $1 per share...

Well, yeah, I'm sure MNDL doesn't want to list a company that is so negative and has a strong sell on them.


Bottom line is that the stock is going DOWN and has a lot further to fall.

watch out. you haven't mentioned anything factual whatsoever. I know your mentally challenged..


FACT: 4 Analysts that actually follow this company all published. And ALL have raised PT's after the companies
update with raised guidance from the Verizon deal. (nobody fake company versus was ever involved with this
company or better yet ever acknowledged)


How many more lies do you want to tell us?


Please provide all your inside information that you have and that the management team hasn't disclosed?


Enlighten all of us with your vast knowledge about a business you know better then the insiders?


Stock is a huge winner this year still up 80%.


$10-15 before year end.

STREET SWEEP SHORT SQUEEZE continues....

The Samsung Note 4 launched today with Verizon and Ignite has been confirmed to be on it.


23 Oct 2014, 12:03 PM


watch out below
Yes, Ignite is on the LG G3 on Verizon and it seems to have had absolutely no impact on MNDL's revenue.
Why will the Note 4 be any different? Ignite is an unproven product that generates no meaningful revenue.
This stock has much further to fall once earnings are announced on Nov 13th. They will miss revenue
estimates by a very wide margin and stock should fall to the 2s...
