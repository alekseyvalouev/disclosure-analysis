LDK Releases Incomplete


Findings


Congratulations to LDK Solar Co., Ltd. for causing the


premature release of results from the independent


investigation this morning. After engaging in active talks with


Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett LLP, asensio.com agreed to


provide material information to the investigation’s advisors.


Over the weekend, representatives from Simpson Thatcher


expressed a great deal of interest in asenso.com’s �ndings.


However, LDK commented on the results of the investigation


before these advisors could review the results of


asensio.com’s deep research.


Clearly, Simpson Thatcher did not want to appear dismissive


of asensio.com, further exposing the problematic


relationship between LDK executives and the independent


advisors retained to investigate the company’s serious


problems with inventory and cost/expense reporting. It is


di�cult to understand how LDK’s independent investigators


remain independent while following the company’s stock


promotion schedule.


LDK’s “independent” audit committee planned to conclude


its investigation by the end of the weekend so that the


company could issue a press statement on Monday,


December 17. It appears Simpson Thatcher only feigned


interest to protect the investigation from asensio.com’s

criticism. It now appears that Simpson Thatcher assisted LDK


with the choreography of an incredible promotion that


began on December 4 (See related report).


In response to the LDK announcement, asensio.com formally


terminated its relationship with Simpson Thatcher. The


communication outlined the clear facts of this case.


Investors must continue to scrutinize the �ndings of this


supposedly independent audit committee. Remember that


the “independent” directors in charge of the investigation


also serve on LDK’s same board that approved the


company’s irregular and highly questionable earnings. Still


worse is the fact that LDK is �nancing the work of the


committee’s advisors. The investigation provides very little


reassurance as questions continue to plague LDK’s latest


promotional trick.
