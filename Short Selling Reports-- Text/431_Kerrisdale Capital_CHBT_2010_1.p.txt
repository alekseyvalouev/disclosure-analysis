China-Biotics vs. Spreadtrum Communications: Why AIC Filings
Matter
Aug. 31, 2010 8:36 AM ET88 comments
by: Chinese Company Analyst


Over the past few months, the topic of financial filings with China’s State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has made frequent appearances within the U.S.-listed
Chinese RTO (“reverse takeover”) sector. I and other critics have advocated that AIC
filings are important data points in determining whether certain Chinese RTOs are
falsifying their SEC financial statements. In cases where AIC-reported revenue, profit and
assets are substantially lower than SEC-reported financial figures, we’ve claimed that this
provides material evidence that the companies in question are fabricating their SEC
financials.


Our arguments have made sense to many investors, but some remain unconvinced.
Misleading responses by certain of the alleged frauds that AIC filings don’t matter have
muddled the debate. These companies, such as CMFO, LIWA or OTCPK:CSKI, have
claimed that AIC filings are unimportant and are not taken seriously in China, and that
investors should not use these filings as data points when analyzing U.S.-listed RTOs. I
strongly disagree.


The point of this article is that AIC filings do matter.


To illustrate this point in a way that hasn’t been yet done, I’m going to provide full 80-page
AIC filings on two Chinese companies, China-Biotics Inc. (OTC:CHBT) and Spreadtrum
Communications Inc (NASDAQ:SPRD). Both of these companies listed on the U.S. public
markets several years ago, trade at similar market capitalizations, and both file with the
Shanghai branch of the Administration for Industry and Commerce (“AIC”). Unlike some
AIC branches that provide only selected AIC documents, the Shanghai branch provides
full AIC reports to inquiring investors.


The China-Biotics filing is 84 pages, while the Spreadtrum filings are comprised of one 76-
page filing and one 34-page filing. I also provide full English translations for each filing.
These filings and the English translations help address much of the misinformation
circulated about AIC filings, and provide clear examples of what information is included in
AIC reports, and why I’m confident that these numbers matter. The filings provide
extensive information about each company’s ownership, registered capital, and, most
importantly, audited financial statements filed with the local Chinese government.

As I’ll discuss, Spreadtrum’s AIC report and financial statements provide evidence that
SPRD is a legitimate Chinese company that generates substantial revenue and owns a
significant amount of assets. Their filings give investors comfort that the company is
accurately representing itself in its SEC financial statements.


OTC:CHBT’s AIC report and financial statements, on the other hand, indicate a company
that is far smaller than its SEC filings indicate. Whereas SPRD’s AIC filings show a
company generating more than $100m of revenue, OTC:CHBT’s filings show a company
generating less than one-tenth of its SEC-reported revenue.


Both companies file with the same local AIC office. The reports are in the same format,
and include similar sets of documents. Yet one shows a legitimate company, and the other
shows a legal entity that has minimal business operations. Any long investor in
OTC:CHBT, or critic of the legitimacy of AIC filings, has to ask himself the following
question: Why would OTC:CHBT provide false information in its AIC filings when SPRD
doesn’t?


The answer is that OTC:CHBT management is providing accurate information to the AIC.
It seems to me that the fake information is in the SEC filings that they provide to public
investors and the U.S. government, a government that does not have legal recourse to a
Shanghai-based company.


Currently, the public markets are valuing OTC:CHBT and SPRD similarly. OTC:CHBT has
a market capitalization of $250m. SPRD has a market capitalization of $440m. Yet it is my
opinion that one of these Shanghai-based companies is real while the other looks like a
fraud.


Brief background on AIC filings, and why I’ve chosen OTC:CHBT and SPRD


For those new to the debate, I’ll provide a brief discussion of AIC filings. The State
Administration for Industry and Commerce is the Chinese government agency responsible
for drafting and implementing legislation concerning the administration of industry and
commerce in China. SAIC regulations are implemented by local AIC branches.


All Chinese companies file a variety of information with their local AIC office, including
information on property leases; land use rights / building ownership certificates; capital
verification reports (these show money / assets contributed by whom, and when);
business licenses; the approved "business scope"; the legal representatives; applications
to form the companies, with some personal information on the applying shareholders;

applications to raise / reduce capital or change the business scope or term; tax and other
government incentive documents; company bylaws; and, last but not least, annual
financial statements.


Not all AIC branch offices operate the same way. Some provide photocopies of original
documents to inquiring agents. Others email electronic data sheets. And others either
provide information only verbally or require agents to visit the office and transcribe the
relevant information by hand.


Furthermore, not all AIC branch offices provide the same volume of information to
outsiders. Some AIC branch offices provide no information at all to the public. Some
provide just financial statements. And some provide extensive reports, including financial
statements, capital registrations, leases, etc.


The Shanghai AIC is one of those branches that provide full AIC reports, and in a
convenient PDF document that is comprised of photocopies of all the relevant source
documents.


That is why I have chosen to compare OTC:CHBT and SPRD. Both of these companies
report to the Shanghai AIC. Unlike CMFO or ONP, which report to small rural AIC offices
that are more secretive in terms of what they release to the public, the Shanghai AIC
provides exceptional disclosure to inquiring investors.

There should be little doubt that this AIC filing is for Shanghai Shining Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd, the main operating subsidiary of China-Biotics, Inc. Here is OTC:CHBT’s
organizational structure:


Growing Bioengineering (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. is the legal entity established in 2006 that
owns the bulk additives operations. Our AIC filings comparison is for the years 2007 and
2008, when Growing Biongineering had no material operations. Shanghai Shining was the
sole operating entity. The 2009 filings for Shanghai Shining are not yet available.


SPRD:


Spreadtrum is a semiconductor manufacturer that IPO’d in 2007. It had a rough 2008 and
2009, when the global downturn reduced semiconductor demand, but business appears to
be rebounding. Its two largest institutional investors, each owning more than 10% of
shares, are $14bn private equity firm Silver Lake Partners and $11bn venture capital firm
New Enterprise Associates.


SPRD, like most companies that generate $100m+ of revenue, has more than 1 operating
subsidiary. Click here for its organizational structure. Based on discussions with
management, most of the revenue, profit and assets were generated at two subsidiaries in
2007 and 2008: Spreadtrum Communications (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Spreadtrum
Communications Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. I’ll refer to the former as “Spreadtrum
Communications” and the latter as “Spreadtrum Technology”.

Chinese GAAP does not consolidate financial statements. To approximate the
consolidated financial figures for SPRD, we need to add the figures of Spreadtrum
Communications and Spreadtrum Technology. Naturally, there are intercompany
payments between the two subsidiaries that distort revenue and profitability. As well, the
assets and liabilities are distorted by dividends payable to other SPRD subsidiaries, as
well as the SPRD parent. But for our purposes, it’s clear that these AIC filings show a real
company with assets and revenue greater than $100m.


Financial Comparisons


Let’s compare the financial figures between each company’s AIC filings and SEC filings:

SPRD comparison:


In the case of OTC:CHBT, the AIC filings show revenue of less than $1m in 2007 and
2008. This compares to SEC-reported revenue of $31m in 2007 and $42m in 2008.
OTC:CHBT’s AIC-reported total assets were $7m and $9m, compared to $45m and $94m
in its SEC filings.


OTC:CHBT’s AIC financial statements are on pages 51 to 84 of the AIC filing (English
translation available here). A summary for 2007 and 2008 are on pages 53 and 70 of the
filing (English translation available here).


In the case of SPRD, Spreadtrum Communications reported revenue of $62m and $64m
in its 2007 and 2008 AIC filings, while Spreadtrum Technology reported revenue of $112m
and $91m its 2007 and 2008 filings. Together, the combined entities reported $174m and

$155m of revenue in 2007 and 2008 in their AIC documents. The SEC-reported revenue
for SPRD was $146m and $110m in 2007 and 2008. The higher combined AIC numbers
indicate that there were some intercompany sales in the AIC filings. Total assets for the
combined two entities were $116m and $126m in 2007 and 2008, compared to SEC-
reported total assets of $237m and $153m. The discrepancy in assets is likely due to large
cash balances and other holdings at the non-Chinese parent Spreadtrum
Communications, Inc., or other subsidiaries.


Again, we shouldn’t expect these subsidiary financial statements to match the SEC filings;
rather, we’re mainly looking to see if the SPRD AIC filings indicate that there is a
legitimate business operating under the SPRD ticker. They do.


Do We Have the Right Shanghai Shining Biotechnology Co. Ltd?


It appears to me that there is boundless evidence that the 84-page filing I’ve included
refers to the same Shanghai Shining that is OTC:CHBT’s main operating subsidiary.


The shareholders of the company in the AIC filings are Song Jin’an, Yan Li, Huang Weida,
and Yan Yihong. Jin’an is the current CEO, Li is his wife, Yihong is her sister, and all four
are current or former officers, directors or shareholders of OTC:CHBT according to its
SEC filings.


The main company address listed in the AIC filing is the same as the one listed in the SEC
filing.


The CEO’s signature in the AIC filing is the same as the CEO’s signature throughout SEC
filings. For instance, compare Song Jinan’s signature on this page from OTC:CHBT’s
2006 10K with his signature on page 19 of the AIC filing.


The percentage ownerships of the shareholders prior to the reverse merger match the
percentage ownerships that China-Biotics has disclosed to the SEC. For instance,
compare the response to question 14 in this March 16, 2007 correspondence with page
37 of the AIC filing (click here for English translation).


Pages 43 to 50 of the AIC filing (click here for English translation) provide details on
management’s transfer of ownership to Sinosmart Group, the British Virgin Islands legal
entity that acted as an intermediary in the company’s 2006 reverse merger. That
transaction is documented extensively in the company’s SEC filings – search Sinosmart in
any 10K.


There should be little dispute that we have the correct entity.

Evidence for why AIC filings do matter


I don’t think any aspect of our AIC filings gives the impression that companies can outright
lie in the financial statements they file with the AIC. Each company provides lengthy and
accurate information on their registered capital, leases, shareholders, company bylaws,
etc. It’s a tremendous leap of faith to believe that the AIC requires accurate reporting in
these aspects, but is indifferent as to whether a $40m revenue company reports sales of
only $1m in its financial statements.


Here are additional reasons why we should take OTC:CHBT’s AIC filings seriously.


1. OTC:CHBT management and insider shareholders live in China. The AIC filings are
filed with the Chinese government, whereas the SEC filings are filed with the U.S.
government. Management is concerned about violating Chinese law and providing false
information to the Chinese government. But, as it appears to me, they are indifferent to
defrauding the US government and breaking US law. A Chinese resident does not have to
obey U.S. law any more than a U.S. resident is required to obey Chinese law. That’s why
they report the accurate numbers to the Chinese government, and what I believe are fake
numbers to the U.S. government. There are practically no repercussions to Chinese
management teams that defraud foreign investors. Numerous U.S.-listed RTO companies,
like CXTI, CYXI and CHFI, have seen their management teams vanish with the
companies' assets, and suffer no legal repercussions. Defrauding U.S. investors is not a
violation of Chinese law, whereas defrauding the Chinese government is.


2. The AIC financial statements are audited. The audit reports can be found on pages
56-57 and 73-74. Click here for English translations of these pages.


3. On page 70 (English translation is here), near the front of the 2008 Annual Inspection
Report, we have a picture of Yan Yihong (the former CFO, and sister-in-law of the CEO),
along with her detailed personal information and the following testament:


I hereby confirm and promise that all the contents contained in the annual inspection
report do not contain anyfraudulent information and all the financial statements and
other materials submitted are true and effective, and that I’m willing to bear any legal
and related responsibilities caused due to the inaccuracy of such documents.


This is followed by the signature and personal seal of CEO Song Jin’an, as well as a seal
of the company. I can’t fathom how the Chinese government would require such a
testament in the Annual Inspection Report, but then allow a company to file false financial

statements.


As I see it, it’s far more believable that OTC:CHBT is defrauding the US government and
US investors, both of which have no legal recourse to the company’s management. The
Chinese government certainly has legal recourse to Yan Yihong and Song Jin’an. The
existence of this sort of testament at the front of the AIC Annual Inspection reports is a
strong sign that AIC financial statements do matter.


4. Why does SPRD file financial statements that approximate its SEC filings
(intercompany distortions notwithstanding), while OTC:CHBT files financial
statements that are a tiny fraction of its reported SEC filings? As I’ll discuss in future
articles, there are ample other signs that SPRD is a real business, while OTC:CHBT, as I
have come to believe, is not. But even excluding any such future arguments, why would
one foreign-owned Shanghai company lie on its AIC financial statements when another
would tell the truth? Why would SPRD report large, accurate numbers if these filings didn’t
matter? What sort of reasonable explanation can anyone come up with? Either both
should be understating their numbers, or both should be reporting accurate numbers.


I firmly believe that both are reporting accurate numbers in their AIC filings.


I also believe that the fake numbers are the ones in OTC:CHBT's SEC filings.


Conclusion


Naturally, I have found that AIC filings are not the only signs that OTC:CHBT is falsifying
its SEC financial statements. Citron Research raises excellent non-AIC-related issues with
the company here. To me, the notion that probiotics nutritional supplements allowed
OTC:CHBT to achieve revenue growth of 30%-50% annually over the past 4 years while
achieving Microsoft-like EBITDA margins of 40%-45% is nothing short of absurd. The
company raised $75m of cash in 2009 when it already supposedly had that much sitting in
the bank, with no compelling reason for the new capital raise and dilution. Its reverse
merger was organized by the same investors who’ve provided capital to renowned fraud
Orient Paper, and its auditor is also the same as ONP’s (not to mention China Expert
Technology’s). But we’ll get to these points in the future.


For now, I aim to make the case that AIC filings matter. The documents provided in this
article provide an indication of what information AIC filings provide, and why investors
should pay attention to them. SPRD’s AIC filings show a legitimate business that
manufactures and sells semiconductors. On the other hand, OTC:CHBT’s AIC filings, as I

Author’s reply »  I don't know who's going to make money. I just know this company is defrauding investors
and is far smaller than what its SEC financial statements indicate.


Let's talk about why this company raised $75m of capital when it didn't need to:


Why did CHBT raise $75m of equity capital in October 2009 when it allegedly had $77m of cash on its
balance sheet, was free cash flow positive and didn’t readily need cash for any of its expansion projects? If its
financial statements were real, it would have been a highly irrational capital allocation decision to dilute
shareholders at the low valuation multiple at which the company was trading at the time. But the truth is that
China-Biotics isn’t highly profitable and it doesn’t actually have the cash it claims it does.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/223068-china-biotics-vs-spreadtrum-communications-why-aic-filings-matter 11/39


Think about it this way:


In October 2009, the company raised $75m of capital in a secondary offering underwritten by Roth Capital.
Supposedly, the use of proceeds was to complete its bulk additives facility, as well as “general corporate
purposes, including expanding [their] retail operations, expanding [their] products, acquiring additional retail
outlets and product lines and for general working capital purposes.”


The company didn’t need the capital to build its new facility. Phase 1 of the new facility costs $28m and Phase
2 of the new facility costs $18m. Both phases together would cost $46m.


The company supposedly had $77m of cash on its balance sheet as of June 30, 2009, the quarter preceding
the capital raise. The company also generates substantial free cash flow, supposedly. In fiscal years 2010,
2009, 2008 and 2007, the company generated $14m, $6m, $9m and $9m of free cash flow, as measured by
cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.


As such, it had plenty of cash for both the bulk additive facility and any store and product expansions. Yet, it
decided to raise $75m of new equity capital, while the company was trading at a trailing P/E multiple of 15x
(I’ve normalized earnings for derivatives fluctuations), using 6-30-09 LTM financial figures. If the company’s
numbers were real, and it was growing revenue at 30% to 50% per year, had operating income margins of
40%, and had ROE of 30% to 40%, this is far too low of a multiple to issue shares, especially when the equity
raise is increasing your outstanding shares by 30%.


But the company’s SEC financial statements are fabrications. The company didn’t have the cash to build its
new bulk additives facility.

You know the answers to your allegations:


Their money is located in China and cannot easily be transferred out. They were thinking about acquiring a
company in the US.


Thanks to their raise at 15$, the company can now purchase its own shares at 12 :)

Chinese Company Analyst, Contributor
Author’s reply »  If they have $77m of cash in the bank and their bulk facility costs at most $46m, they have
over $30m left over for their "potential acquisition". Then they just raised another $75m at a low valuation, just
to have it ready? That sounds bogus to me. At least CMFO announced its fake acquisition before its capital
raise, rather than just raise cash to have it sitting there.

The Company just announced two weeks ago plans to build a probiotics animal feed plant to be completed in
2 years. As you pointed out, these plants cost money. It's a good thing that they have almost $160 million in
cash.


So far, the uses are: 
$18 million on phase 2 
$20 million on stock buyback 
$[46] million on new animal feeds plant (this is just a guess given that last plant cost $46 million


This leaves $76 million left over for a third plant, a dividend, another stock buyback, or perhaps an acquisition
if they can find an opportunity at the right price. I link this kind of firepower. Perhaps you should stick to
shorting companies that have little to no cash considering their options are limited to defend themselves.

You say 15$ is a low valuation? So CHBT is cheap at 12 Dollars? :))

Author’s reply »  If the numbers were real, it'd be a low valuation. But the numbers aren't real, and the
earnings are fabrications. So it's a high valuation. Fundamentally, this stock is worth less than $1. One day,

Author’s reply »  I'm sure they'll come up with all sorts of wondrous uses for all that newly raised capital. This
is similar to how CMFO found some bogus algae drinks company to redirect $20m of their cash, or CHNG
used its newly raised capital to buy some natural gas facilities that it previously owned but didn't disclose to
public shareholders.


I'm sure CHBT will come up with fictional uses for their $75m of raised capital. And don't get me wrong, they
will build some of these facilities, much like they've been building their new bulk additives probiotics facility.
The company is trying to "grow into" its financial statements. It fabricated $100m of sales, which is 5% of the
overall global probiotics market, and this presence is disputed by its competitors who can hardly find the
company's products even in Shanghai. Now it has raised capital to potentially build a facility and try to form
some sort of respectable business.

And it's unclear whether it's using 100%, 50% or 20% of the recently raised funding to build the facility. If it's
less than 100%, who knows where the rest of it is going. My assumption is that if you've making up your SEC
financial statements by orders of 10, you're also probably going to keep some of that newly raised $75m for
your own bank account, as opposed to pay for a probiotics facility that will never get large enough to grow into
your fictional financial statements anyways.

Questions for Chinese Company Analyst,


Was the same auditor used for CHBT's AIC and SEC submissions or were different auditors used? If the same
auditing firm was used there are likely explanations for the differences between the AIC and SEC filings. If different
firms were used that would only add fuel to the fire but one auditing firm would still be compelled to look into the other

firm's work. If indeed the AIC reports are audited you would also have to have collusion in the fraud with shady
auditors. That is possible but I would like to think is unlikely. What would be the auditor's motivation for knowingly
submitting false financial reports to either the AIC or the SEC? I just sense (and want to believe) that there would be
just too many cooks to make the fraudulent broth work.


Have you also looked into the SAT tax filings? Do you have an opinion on which information source, AIC or SAT is
more useful?


Thanks for your response to my questions.


31 Aug 2010, 01:47 PM


Chinese Company Analyst, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Different auditors were used. CHBT's auditor for SEC filings is BDO Ltd in Hong Kong and
the auditor for its AIC filings is Qingdao Zhenqing Certified Public Accountants.


I don't think BDO checks up on anyone else's work, or up on much of anything. They audited CXTI, which
turned out to be a complete hoax where management vanished with the company's assets, assuming there
were any to begin with. They audited ONP, whose fraud has been well-documented, and whose main supplier
was an empty shell owned by its CEO. Typically, low-tier auditors like BDO Ltd simply take the documents
that the company gives them. If the company forges the documents, I think that they just figure that the onus
is on the company, not them.


SAT filings aren't available to the public. There are cases where folks have gotten them as part of their
diligence, such as in the most recent report by a consulting firm on CGA. But while AIC documents are
available to the public, SAT / tax documents are not, and typically involve bribing / knowing someone to get
the documents, from what I understand.

Dan723
Chinese Company Analyst,


Thanks for your feedback on the auditor question. If BDO really is that bad it only serves to support the old slang for
what CPA stands for; cut, paste and attach. I really do hope they are better than that. It is possible that the auditors
are being caught flatfooted by this issue which would be professionally unacceptable but I suppose possible.


Did you contact CHBT management and confront them with your findings before publishing this article or are they
being blindsided by this?


I hope your work elicits a thoughtful response by the CHBT management and others because this is an important
issue for all involved in the China space. At the very least you have stirred things up and I thank you for that although
I admit I hope fraud is not as rampant in the China space as some assume.

Author’s reply »  Thanks. I've spoken to them in the past.


I think your line about auditors is pretty relevant - in the end, auditors can only do so much, and are only
going to do so much, to prevent frauds. You just can't rely on them.


The real solution to situations like CHBT isn't better auditing, but coordination between the US and Chinese
governments to figure out whose laws fraudulent managements are breaking. Citron has made excellent
points when they've written: "Citron reminds investors of the regulatory gap that allows Chinese companies
with US listings to live in the margins, held accountable by neither Chinese authorities nor the SEC."

Author’s reply »  SEC has attempted to do things about these situations but haven't really been able to. They
can't really subpoena management teams in China. They've subpoenaed third parties that work for these
companies, such as the auditor of CSKI, but they did that in the fall of last year, and nearly a year has
passed, which tells you how much power they have over these situations. If the forged documents and fraud
is originating from china, it's unclear what the SEC can do. But who knows, all of this is new, and the
allegations of fraud have been increasing over the past 6 months. So maybe I'm wrong.


You can get a taste of how the SEC views CHBT by looking through the extensive correspondence the SEC
has had with the company since the reverse merger. Search all the Form CORRESP and UPLOADs for
CHBT and you'll see a long dialogue between the company and the SEC. But the SEC operates under a
disclosure-based system - they generally don't shut down a fraudulent company if the fraud is occurring
overseas. But you never know.


I haven't contacted the SEC. I'm not sure who to contact and writing these articles is probably a better way to
get the word out to the SEC than by sending them an email to their "tips" hotline.

Re: Yongye. Their product may exist, and their numbers may be accurate (or not). I don't really know about
that so much as, if you look at buying stock as buying a business, and what comes with a business, of being
ethical and of delivering value to customers, I scratch my head at fulvic/humic acid fertilizer mixed in with
Chinese herbs being sold at a very high price.


Now, lets just say Westerners are just slow, and fulvic/humic acid is one of those things that western science
has not yet fully established as legitimate, but that actually works. I'm sure in terms of Chinese herbs, there
were a lot that Westerners thought were complete shams for what they claimed to work for but that turned out
to contain beneficial chemicals much later. (As an aside, there were also Chinese 'medicines' or herbs that
were found to contain harmful compounds as well).


For arguments sake, lets just assume fulvic acid works as a fertilizer supplement and that the West is non-
believing because they simply have not conducted enough research into the matter.


What gives Yongye a competitive advantage then over other fulvic/humic acid makers is the
proprietary/patented blend they have. In this blend are herbs.


Where is the 3rd party verified scientific research that shows this blend is better than fulvic acid alone, or
better than traditional Western NPK fertilizers?


The company on their website claim they are engaged in "modern biotechnology", and that the product they
sell yield the following: 
" 
1. Greater yields, more production 
2. Enhanced growth, strong seedlings 
3. Resistance against disease and pests, improved effects. 
4. Resistance against draught (sp), prevention of frozen 
5. Fights against continuous cropping, and reduces hazards to crops. 
6. Improve product quality, improves taste. 
7. Early maturity, and longer picking period, higher price. 
8. Decrease in fertilizer residual, healthier products."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/223068-china-biotics-vs-spreadtrum-communications-why-aic-filings-matter 18/39


Then they elaborate each point by providing anecdotal evidence (unverifiable stories and unscientific
testimonials) to back each claim.


Now, we all know the US and China have massive differences in terms of consumer protection, and how
product performance claims can be made, but if you think about it, what is legal is not what is at question
here. This is a question of ethics and how aggressively a company grooms itself.


If it were legal to do so and there were no chance I would be sued, I would still NOT mix herbs with fish food
and claim that your fish will grow stronger, bigger, faster, and be more resistant to disease and infection with
my product with sparse evidence. If I were to make such a claim, my hypothetical business would back it up
scientifically, and preferably backed by an independent testing firm especially if I were to charge top dollar for
the product.


I'm not claiming Yongye's products work or don't work. I'm saying they are thin on facts and big on marketing
words. Somehow, I feel their interpretation of modern biotechnology will differ from the definition given at a
top-tier university. If they have data, data speaks for itself. If a company feels comfortable making aggressive
product claims, why wouldn't it feel comfortable making very aggressive earnings or cashflow claims?


Ask yourself if this is where you want to put your money. To me, this is one of many other red flags. I'm not
sure I like the risks with the information available. In the short run, anything could happen-- good companies
can be hammered by aggressively short hedge funds, or bad companies can rocket to the moon. In the long-
run, I know company reputation and a product that relies on quality not hyperbole is key. I like companies with
strong brands, but when a company 'plays near the foul line' in its product performance claims, I'm very wary.
I make a clear distinction between good and ethical branding via presentation and the designing of customer
emotions to be tied to a product, and unethical and exaggerated product performance claims (such as if a
drink claimed it made users more intelligent).


On a related note, I have made a list of things I check for when I consider a Chinese ADR stocks. I have
originally posted the list on a comment on another commentary, but repost it here for your convenience:


______________________...


1. Does PCAOB have jurisdiction over the selected auditor (y/n where n= slightly negative, y=neutral).


2. Beyond being registered, does the audit firm submit reports regularly? (y/n - yes is slightly negative, no is
neutral)


3. Has the PCAOB found the audit firm to be deficient once or on a continual basis? (n = neutral, once =
moderately negative, multiple times = slightly more negative).


4. Was the audit firm, the same audit firm in another bad Chinese ADR and did the audit firm fail to cite
concerns relatively early on? (yes-yes = very negative, yes-no = slightly negative, no-N/A = neutral)


5. What is the trend in auditor quality? (Improving = slight positive, worsening = negative).


I also have a list of other flags I look for, which do not necessarily point to fraud but can be taken as signs that
increase risk:

A. Exaggerated product claims. 
B. Abuse of regulated terms whose usage is unregulated or whose use is under-enforced in PRC. ("organic",
"green", etc.) 
C. Involvement of unethical promoters or affiliates. 
D. Excessively vague statements and/or vaguely positive press releases. 
E. Frequent intentional or unintentional masking of specifics via an apparent language issue. 
F. Low tech or older technology or unproven technology disguised with fancy terminology that may seem to
lay-persons as indicative of cutting-edge technology.(e.g. traditional manure called biotechnology, or
traditional telecommunication devices termed photonics). 
G. Low quality patents with SIPO only. Patents which would not be of any value under the European system. 
H. Out of "patents for invention", "patents for utility model" and "patents for design", a greater concentration in
the 'easier' patent categories within these SIPO patent types. 
I. Extended trend discrepancies between earnings and free cash flow with little or no explanation. 
J. Revenue that fails to follow positive earnings trend, with no explanation to how average margins or
productivity were improved.


Finally, I have a list of some slightly 'mitigating' factors I look for:


I. Executives with links to reputable Western universities. 
II. Words that indicate ownership in press releases. See GA for example. 
III. Standard IPO, rather than reverse merger. 
IV. Big 4 auditor. 
V. Current executives previously involved in other legitimate successes (Chinese ADRs). 
VI. A dividend, however small.

Yesterday and throughout the night, Citron and I hired private investigators and other Shanghai residents to visit
certain of the "stores" at the addresses provided by the company yesterday. These investigators were told to (i) visit
the locations at the specified addresses, (ii) identify whether the addresses refer to standalone stores, (iii) take photos

(v) to the extent possible, take photos of the locations of the company's products and (vi) write a brief account of each

I will publish an initial account from one of these Shanghai residents below, who visited three of the addresses

But first, I want to address a note that came out from Robert Hsu last night responding to the post by Citron Research.

business newspaper of China, 21st Century Business Herald, wrote a separate front-page article documenting Orient
Paper's fraud, and adding additional relevant points indicating that Orient Paper is falsifying its SEC financial
statements. We also found out that Orient Paper's top supplier is an empty shell owned by the company's CEO, and
that as of June 2009, it somehow had acquired 2m shares of ONP, or about 4% of the company's outstanding shares.


Ample evidence has come out demonstrating that Orient Paper is a fraud, and Robert Hsu's note did a disservice to
investors subscribing to his newsletter. I see the same poor level of diligence in his latest note on China-Biotics.


In particular, I'm concerned with his following unfounded comment, which, based on preliminary indications from our
private investigators, will be demonstrated to be patently false by the end of the week.


"This morning, the short seller continues to accuse that some of the stores listed on CHBT website are actually hotels
or supermarkets. Actually, according to our source in Shanghai, CHBT places some stores in supermarkets or hotels,
similar to how we sometimes see McDonald's in a Walmart or a Burger King in a shopping mall."


That's just not true, Mr. Hsu. Not only does the company not own standalone stores at many of its disclosed locations,
which is clearly what its SEC filings imply, but it doesn't even own stores-within-a-store at many of the locations.


I will begin the day with the following account that I and Citron Research received last night from one of the Shanghai
residents who investigated several of the stores for us. I have disclosed his name and contact information to Seeking
Alpha editors.


"I went to visit three locations so far. Mostly in Yangpu District and what I can confirm is there arent any retail outlets
present for CHBT. There could be shelf space in the supermarket but that's a very different matter. Specifically, 102
Zhongyuan Road, Yangpu District and 1750 Changyang Road, Yangpu District are two super markets operated under
the brand name Oushang.


The supermarkets do have separate stores inside them that sells clothes, food, even nutritional products. I personally
walked around those two stores thoroughly and could find no signs of CHBT stores. The one on Changyang Road is
right by home so I frequent there all the time. While I could not find the Shining stores, I was able to find a store that's
called Natural Elements, a direct brand name under Shanghai Jiaoda Onlly Corp. I had a phone conversation with
one of the managers and am pretty sure the store has nothing to do with CHBT. Also btw, after talking with the sales
clerk, she said they on average make 30-50k RMB on a monthly basis for revenue, that translates into 4-6k USD a

month. Noted, that's a retail space not shelf space. The places I went are much more of a prime location with
significant traffic flow and tons of ppl walking in the mall. I would really expect places in Baoshan and others to have
much less flow therefore less revenue. So now you count on a quarterly basis, this store can generate maybe 15k,
you need 100 of these to generate 1.5mil...the reported 25mil number, you would be looking at 1800 retail outlets in a
city like Shanghai. That roughly illustrates on a scale's perspective, their operation through retail distribution is very
much unlikely to build up revenues.


Its a lot harder for me to prove the nonexistence of a retail store in a huge shopping mall of course other than putting
my name behind this. But I think it's helpful to look at things from a scale's perspective. Even if they do have the 100
retail stores they claim to have, their revenue numbers are still unlikely at least from the conversations I had with the
sales reps. In any case, I'm completely convinced that this company is a complete hoax. I took some photos but those
are of the other brand name stores that are apparently unrelated, so I don't think it would be of any value for you
guys. But i think you can upload it and cite the numbers I quoted you guys as a comp to illustrate the point.


Also I'd like to point out for you guys the severe lack of seasonality in these numbers. In China, most of the sales of
these types of products happens right around the Chinese new year when people go around to visit relatives. The
sales should really account for a huge percentage of the annual sales just because thats when people actually buy
that kind of stuff to give out as gifts. To have a roughly flat sales in the first and second quarter is simply telling, you
will never see that if the reporting is regular.


Again, given the difficulty of proving the nonexistence of a store, I think focusing on the ability of revenue generation
will prove to be fruitful. Like I said, even if all the stores are real, which they are not, you still cannot be selling at that
levels. To get credible verification however, you will need to get data from various supermarkets and see what volume
of its products are actually being sold...but again, i cannot imagine a tiny shelf space in a supermarket or pharmacy
can reasonably outsell a separate store inside."

Agreed, his purpose for posting these blogs is to try to profit from his short positions by continually distorting the truth.
Then, he tries to through something in his blogs about his other shorts so that they appear on the other pages and if
get published, sometimes show up as an article on the others. I do not know much about CHBT so I cannot comment
on the specifics of the claims, but CCA continually follows suit after a random attack article comes out on a company.


Also, if you look back on CCA's blogs and articles he states several times how ONP's AIC documents do not match
the SEC filings and he has copies to prove it and he uses the AIC documents as proof of fraud. The thing is that
ONP's AIC and SEC documents do match and that is why he will not bring up this issue with ONP anymore. Then in
his latest article, he tries to discredit the office that ONP's AIC documents come from. At the same time, he created an
article on ONP's top supplier Xushui County Dongfang Trading Company Limited and used their AIC filings, but I
believe they come out of the same region. His major argument in the beginning and with some of his other shorts are
if the two are matching and now that he has been proven incorrectly on this with ONP, he wants to try to use it in
some cases and not others.


Then CCA wants to act as if ONP's top supplier does not exist yet in the document he provided for 2007(which is
another topic), it shows the supplier with over $21 million in payables and over $28 million in total assets, but because

he cannot access their info for 2008 and 2009 he wants to state they are a shell. Where did the $28 million in assets
go? They obviously still exist and the auditor verfies their top customer.

CCA,


You make a big issue about AIC documents matching SEC documents except for when it fits your needs.
ONP's AIC and SEC documents match. What is your response.


Also, I made the initial mistake off of not converting the currency for the supplier into US dollars when taking
the info from the english translation of your AIC document for ONP's supplier. So, I did make a mistake there.
There is still no reason to not believe that they do not exist because you could not find or provide information
on Xushui County Dongfang Trading Company Limited.


This is a prime example that AIC documents are not as important as you present, but if stated correctly, it
shows ONP's ability to not state incorrect earnings. So the supplier not having correct AIC documents should
not be a concern.


Again, what are your thoughts on ONP's AIC and SEC filings matching, considering it is of large importance
to you?

Business Economics Analyst, Contributor
I can't believe that you haven't given up on ONP, it has been shown to be a fraud repeatedly. Why do you
keep trying to perpetrate this fraud? ONP's SEC and AIC documents didn't match either, but you don't need
that to show it is a fraud. Who are you? You sound like the CFO. And, by the way, I currently have no position.
I covered my short position.

who are more difficult to verify. revenue of US$100m plus to third tier customers?

Attacks on your credibility have not been very persuasive in my view primarily because you provide citations or proof
to each and every point of fact you assert. Although biased because you are short, I'm betting your short because of
your research. However, you assert that you are both long and short chinese stocks, yet you never say what you are
long. How about stating your long positions to prove that assertion and prove you are not just a perma-bear on the

I FIGURE THAT NEITHER SIDE IN THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO SAY "OH, YOU'RE RIGHT" TO THE OTHER SIDE. 
For the rest of us who can't rely on either side, I will repeat what I asked in another battle over CHBT: 
******** 
....CHBT shorts, can you provide examples of companies that you declared were fraudulent and which actually turned
out to be the case.  
NOT companies you continue to slam, but companies that were demonstrably caught in significant falsehoods.
Please, no more unproved, "guilty until found innocent" allegations, just the facts as they eventually came out via
regulatory authorities. 
And, Longs or those who would bash the shorts: can you give us examples of companies that were slammed by the
shorts only to have the truth come out that those companies were on the up and up. NOT companies where there is
an ongoing reason to be concerned about their truthfulness, but companies where it was found that the shorts were
wrong in their allegations.


This will not prove anything regarding CHBT, but it will give me, and perhaps others, a sense of whose comments
have proven to be more frequently accurate in the past. 
Thank you.

02 Sep 2010, 02:02 AM

Ah Jason...Way to selectively pick out their losing picks. Luckily I’m here to correct the record.


Would you like to give us a recap of every stock pick they made in 2008? No? Ok, well they did that here: 
www.citronresearch.com.../


And in 2009...You missed a few of their winners:


How about APOL on 1/13/2009 @ ~$90/share... now mid 40s... 
www.citronresearch.com.../


How about LPHI on 2/9/09 ~$32/share...Now at $15 
www.citronresearch.com.../


IBOC $16 went all the way down to 7, but is now close to unchanged 
www.citronresearch.com.../


CBEY $14 down to $12


AMED $42 down to <$25 today (although truthfully most prudent investors might have been stopped out as
the bulls took it higher) but their concerns about medicare fraud were prescient...


SEED on 10/25/2009...After SEED had rocketed up to $11-something they put out their report and while the
stock did keep rising in the weeks that followed, it now sits around $7/share...


GRMN on 12/15ish @ $31, down to $27.


...and the list goes on and on. Have they had misses, of course they have, but to select their three worst picks
and claim they have no credibility, is deceitful (even for someone such as yourself whose so adept at talking
his own book).


I have no interest in CHBT (I have never owned it, nor do I intend to short it), so I really don’t care what
happens to the company but you're delusional if you think that calling shelf-space in a super-market as a
"retail outlet" is not shady as all hell...


Also, did I read somewhere they just issued shares...AND now they are doing a stock-buyback? Hmmm... I
don't know why, but my corporate finance tells me that if you need cash for capex and your stock is trading at
8x earnings equity might not be the cheapest form of financing. It really makes you wonder, who are they
buying the shares back from...insiders perhaps?


I’d be careful with this one.

Thanks for the links. Glad to see that Citron has had its fair share of winning picks and losing picks.


China-Biotics realizes that its retail outlets are not an efficient way of selling its retail products and have
stopped adding retail outlets two years ago and is in the process of shutting down under performing outlets.
The Company has increased retail sales 26.3% in their latest quarter over the previous year with 8 fewer
outlets because 87% of their retail sales are from 27 distributors. Long investors are already aware of their
retail strategy as they have discussed it on their two prior analyst calls. The real growth going forward will be
bulk sales as bulk now represents 40% of overall sales in the first quarter.


The Company raised additional capital in Oct 2009 at 15x LTM earnings, not 8x LTM earnings.

Don't you think you owe an apology to Citron Research for misrepresenting their record? You tried to
represent Citron as having more than their fair share of losing picks. In fact, you comment is stil wrong, I think
the post makes clear that Citron has had more than its fair share of winning picks and less than its fair share
of losing picks. 
You are missing the point concerning China-Biotics. The issue raised is China-Biotics making false
representations concerning their sales - representing that they have sales that they don't. You simply use
China-Biotics statements as if they are true to dispute the point. Do you have any information to show that
China-Biotics is not falsely representing their sales?

So they are raising capital via stock issuance and buying back stock less than 12mo later? FYI: Stock
issuance isn't free, they are paying bankers tons of money to do this sort of thing. One other interesting note
they have 3 research analysts that cover them: Roth Capital (who underwrote their little stock issuance),
Maxim Group and Singular Research. Not exactly Goldman Sachs & Bank of America we're dealing with
here... Does Roth even issue sell ratings?


As for Citron (which I have no affiliation with) 
I would encourage you to read their archive. Literally the first archive link i clicked on was for NTMD which
they recommended shorting on 8/3/2004 in the $18s was acquired on 4/27/09 for <$1 share... 
-HSOA is a good one...$6/share to zero in less than 2yrs (Guess when they posted their story?).


Literally nearly every stock i click on leads me to a chart pointed down and to the right. Seriously pull these up

Ryuto A. Kawai, Contributor
The problem as I see it are twofold:


1. Shorts are aggressive in their claims of falsehoods, and this and presumable bear attacks by well-funded
entities can drive down prices adding further doubt. 
2. There is a definite lack of transparency and an issue of differences in terms of audit quality between
Chinese stocks and US stocks that all long-term investors should be concerned about.


Problem 1 stems from problem 2, a lack of transparency and a lack of audit rigor as in the United States. As
we all learned in the Satyam case, even with a big four auditor, the auditors seem to have an 'out' by citing
different standards. In the Satyam case for example, were the firm in question a US entity, I have no doubt in
my mind that such a simple falsification of cash balances would have been discovered via the audit firm only
accepting bank statements directly from the bank itself. Apparently, this simple check did not happen, and
while the information is sparse, the auditor, Price Waterhouse Coopers India, in its own words, followed the
standard in that country-- implying they used other presumably lax verification methods aside from checking
the bank statement. One can argue that where banks and auditors are complicit, US audit standards provide
no protection; however, that audit standards are less established in China is undeniably an added risk factor.


There is also a difference in patent qualities amongst USPTO patents, EPO patents, and SIPO patents. As
well, there is a standard difference issue amongst the use of certain terms, one example being (中国绿色食品
发展中心: greenfood.org.cn/sites.../) CGFTC's A 'organic' certification that allows some use of synthetic
fertilizers and IFOAM or EEC versions which disallow the usage of synthetics. (see (EEC) N° 2092/91 for
example).


These sorts of differences also carry over to things like product quality or advertising claims. Here in the
United States, things are not perfect with the BBB or FTC; however, no one can argue that China implements
the same level of protection for buyers.


I'm not sure about in the pink sheets where scams are abound, but I don't know of any US Nasdaq or NYSE
listed company that only makes traditional probiotics, vitamin C and taurine in one company or traditional
fertilizers in another company and calls itself a biotechnology company or claims that a combination product
of vitamin C, l-arginine, and amino acids can help with "brain cell development" quite openly. Such blatant and
aggressive use of terms usually causes regulators to step in within the United States. (see for example a case
where the FTC stepped in to discontinue the use of a misleading label on egg cartons:
ftc.gov/os/closings/st...)


The lack of internationally acceptable standards not just in accounting but in terms of marketing and product
quality or production standards add a layer of risk to investing in China via Chinese ADRs. These same
issues also make it easy for shorts to hammer a stock.


I should also note that when I am shorting a US entity, there is always the concern of a company's stock price
going so low that it becomes a takeover target. If you're long such a company, there is hope that if shorts are
too aggressive in their claims, or they are spreading false rumors that fundamental investors or acquisitors
can drive the stock price back up. However, because China restricts foreign ownership of certain companies
(danmex.org/html-en/chi...), and because most of these Chinese ADRs are Cayman Island, Delaware, or
Nevada wraps, the prospects of cheap shares rebounding on a takeover are very uncertain.

Another case of where we may not have protections where retail investors (and some professionals) may
think they have but may not:


Many of these Nasdaq-listed Chinese ADRs sidestep Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635 (c) that requires shareholder
approval in the case of the authorization of additional shares via citing in lieu adherence to Cayman Islands
common law. I'm not singling out any company, and to be fair, the example cited is one that is seen across
many other foreign ADRs, but here is a prominent example. Quoted from a CTRP annual statement:


"Rule 5635(c) of the Nasdaq Rules requires a Nasdaq listed company to obtain its shareholders' approval of
all equity compensation plans, including stock plans, and any material amendments to such plans. ...Our
Cayman Islands counsel has provided a letter to Nasdaq dated November 11, 2008 certifying that under
Cayman Islands law, we are not required to obtain shareholders' approval for amendments to our existing
equity incentive plan. Nasdaq has acknowledged the receipt of such letter and our home country practice with
respect to approval for amendments to our equity incentive plan"


The differences in legal protections goes further as outlined in the 'risk' portion of the same company's annual
report:


"The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law
are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In
particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United
States, and provides significantly less protection to investors. Therefore, our public shareholders may have
more difficulties in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our management, directors or controlling
shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States. In
addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action before
the federal courts of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to protect our interests if we are
harmed in a manner that 
would otherwise enable us to sue in a United States federal court. 
"


Paraphrased, beyond just Nasdaq 5635 (c) that presumably provides shareholders some level of protection
against a non-shareholder-approved authorization of shares, many of these Chinese ADRs operate under a
judicial framework that is less developed and rigorous and thus potentially more vulnerable to abuse.


Under such circumstances as cited above then, it is understandable that many investors and traders follow
the "sell first, ask later" philosophy when there are any doubts as to the accuracy of financial statements (no
implication in relation to CTRP). This collective attitude then, in turn creates the perfect environment for
ethical and unethical shorts to spread doubt (and sometimes baseless rumors). Given the circumstances, it is
quite understandable that investors by their buy/sell actions are demanding a maximum level of management
cooperation in providing transparency and in selecting the most reputable of auditors. Investors are voting
with their investment dollars, and the message is clear: Under the circumstances of diminished shareholder
(and consumer) protections, the onus of proof that a company is NOT exaggerating numbers and NOT a
fraud is on the company.


The derivative debate of whether one particular small cap Chinese ADR is fudging numbers or not is, for
most, usually unanswerable to an acceptable level of certainty. Evidence in favor of a company may also not

change the fact that they trade at a very low multiple, given these judicial/structural issues that significantly
add to uncertainty.


For the average retail investor, I believe the only 'safer', and not necessarily safe, way to play China then, is
to buy companies such as Peabody or Caterpillar, McDonalds, or Yum! Brands. This is simply my opinion.


For the more savvy investor, picking out Chinese ADRs with little or no 'red flags' may be an option, with the
understanding that there is a significant risk that shares may remain depressed due to the uncertainties cited
above, and significant downside risk due to aggressive 'short' reports, ethical or otherwise. The decision as to
hold, sell, or add shares, in the face of a barrage of short activity, and aggressively negative reports, will then
prove tricky, and would depend in part to how much research/due diligence were performed. I for one, have
decided that, due to severely depressed price multiples, that holding on to Chinese ADRs in which I have
done my due diligence is risk worth taking.


If anyone is interested, I have posted a checklist of things I look at when trying to quantify risk with the
information available. It can be found here in the comment section:

I will repeat the cogent answer I provided you earlier.


Past preformance is no assurance of future results. The reason for these forums is to provide adequate information
for investors to make an investment judgement on. You are required to make up your own mind. No one is going to
give you a guarantee.


Read the posts. It takes extremely large risk tolerance to be in any of these Chinese RTO's much less one that is
max-shorted and subject to continuing adverse press.

Of recent vintage you might want to check other shorts I have championed?... CCA is being plagued by a
juvenile impostor. Take note of the spelling.


CSKI -SEC investigation 
ONP - Internal investigation, 5 class actions, underwriter suspends coverage 
CHNG - 1 class action, paid PR firm suspends coverage, discloses default on loans and posts a non-reliance
notice in the 10-Q 
CMFO - Joke Juice fraud should collapse shortly


CCA has been on CMFO and ONP. Trying to lure him into CSKI. Made opening investigations of LIWA,
CBTO, and SKBI and have either let them rest or dropped them.


Other obvious losers that I am not in are CGA and CCME.


You now have my personal play list for China trash. I don't ever get so drunk to consider any of these RTO's
worthy of a seconds look. Now you owe it to us to document the recent touts by the people who recommend
this toad.

CCA is a on the up and up.


He will not reveal his identity so how can we know for certain?

I disagree, that is not part of the due diligence. Doing due diligence means researching the company and the
points made about it. For example, doing due diligence on China-Biotics would involve researching their
product, researching their subsidiary, reviewing their SEC filings, their website(s), their press releases,
contacting competitors, contacting customers, etc.

With apologies, but you should not consider speculative investments. Particularly ones with major negative

Mr. Chinese Company Analyst,


What are your methods of verifying your stories. I see no evidence that the informtion contained in your

Also, why do you refuse to reveal your identity? Are you hiding something? Do you have any criminal
convictions in your past?

Chinese Company Analyst,


Thank you for the reply.


I dont feel you are being honest in your reporting.


You claim that you want your ideas to speak for themself but you put a lot of weight on the Citron report. You cannot
verify their level of accuracy yet you state aspects of their report are fact, when in fact, they are not fact.


You have also made claims in relation to BDO that are grossly inaccurate.

We should investigate "Who [he] really [is]."?? Are you kidding? He's a guy posting his opinion about a
company on a website. Not only that, he fully discloses his short position... Since Seeking Alpha is a public
site where any old person can post their opinion, why don't you refute him rather than call for his
"investigation".


You see... freedom of speech and the marketplace of ideas is what made this country great. Trying to stifle
debate is not healthy.


Finally, if the longs have it right, I'm sure they'll be basking in the cash flow and dividends they receive (and
conversely, SHORTS will owe those dividends)...Oh wait... the company is not paying dividends? hmmm... I
wonder why.

Jennifer,


I'll bet you like to muzzle anyone who disagrees with your investment thesis. Fraud is a big word to trot out... From the
looks of his original article he's comparing SEC documents vs. Chinese filed documents. I fail to see how that is fraud
when he has links to both 80+ page documents for all to see. I wonder, have you read either of those documents?
Which part of his claim has he not "substantiated'? If he's a "fraud" I'm sure you'll have no problem disputing his
assertions with your own well documented facts...


As for AAPL -- Yes they have a ton of cash on their balance sheet and indeed ample free-cash flow coming in every
quarter. I know this because they are audited by Ernst & Young and followed by about 50 different analysts.


But your derision of dividends is interesting, so I'll have to get your opinions on the matter:


Question: Do you buy stocks because you think it's interesting to own a piece of paper without any expectation of
ever getting paid for owning it? Do people pay $250/share for apple because they think apple is cool? (well some do i
suppose) but it's because SOME DAY they will eventually pay out investors with profits.


You don't just buy for stocks out of the goodness of your heart...one day they have to show you the money. I hope you
understand this...even a person with "little" market experience like me can understand this concept.


I wish you all the best with " ..tak[ing] the little bit of family money I have left and invest[ing] in CHBT." Sounds like a
great plan.


-Happy Labor Day!

PS - I love how these longs are so upset about the shortsellers' research pieces. With 1/3 of the float sold short in
CHBT, if the company ever did "prove" they were legit you would have a rocket-ship stock on your hands as they all
scramble to cover their shorts and in the meantime you can buy a beat-up stock on the cheap. You should be
thanking these guys if you truly are drinking the Kool-Aid on this company.

Slyng's number id is 432734; and you are 720515. By the way, I am 482 and David Jackson is 3.


The ID is ordered by the time the user registered with Seeking Alpha. It looks like Slyng is around for a long time,
though keeping quiet, and you just registered yesterday, quite likely a pseudo for a familiar name otherwise.


Anyone can tell your tones when you make comments. You are not about to argue with facts apparently whatsoever,

Anyone care to comment on CHBT's subsidiary name, Shanghai Shining Biotechnology Co. Ltd.?


Old biochemistry, and supplement science-- is it just me that thinks calling it biotechnology is deceptive?


Also, I'm quite shocked that no one finds issue with the fact that on their June-2010 presentation they claim the
following for their vitamin C, l-arginine, taurine product:


"development of brain cells"


If anyone can, I would like to know other people's thoughts/contributions on 1. The legal restrictions of making product
performance claims in China and 2. Why an investor in a business should not take exaggerated or deceptive product
claims to be a reflection of an unethical company.

Am I missing something here? I would never want to be long a company that say (not CHBT but a hypothetical
company), sold lemonade that were claimed to make you slimmer, more intelligent, and perhaps could make you see
further. I would want nothing to do with the company. Is my approach and attitude about business ethics so Western
skewed that I'm seeing problems where there are none? Because to me, these (exaggerations) are major red flags.


Also, for the sake of keeping SA more sane than your random stock message board, we should all avoid the ad
hominem attacks. If China Analyst is wrong, please back it up with facts. I don't like it if he has multiple SA accounts
or if he is anonymous, but I still have not seen a good rebuttal to why we should not care that the 111 claimed retail
stores are at least partially non-existent. The facts seem to indicate 40-50 of not stores nor stores-within-stores, but
just shelf space in supermarkets. At most the number is 80 (the approximate number of addresses given). Facts are
facts. When the facts don't match hyped up claims in the 10-K, I take that as a warning sign. If you disagree, then
why?


Is the argument that of semantics (calling shelf space as a retail store is legitimate or not so worrisome to you)? And
what of the 30 odd stores not reported?


I don't buy the counter-argument that the retail stores don't matter because they account for a smaller proportion of
revenue. I'm concerned about the truthfulness of the 10-K report, and my reasonable line of logic is that if a company
is willing to lie in one part of their 10-K, they probably would have no issues in lying elsewhere or in material ways.
Thus the issue of the claimed 111 retail stores is very important, and should not be dismissed.


While I share a lot of the discomfort people have with anonymous posters, we should not make this debate about the
messenger.

I may also have doubts about. But the fact is, CHBT has claimed 111 retail stores (see 10-k). And the "retail
stores" were confirmed by more than a few people to mostly be shelf space. What more can you ask for
beyond photos?


You can attack the messenger for being anonymous, but CHBT published 79 addresses to prove it has 111
retail stores. Out of these 79 stores, 1 is a duplicate. I have a friend in Shanghai who also pointed out that at
least some of these addresses are supermarkets without a store in a store.


This is not heresay, and is verifiable here:


chn-biotics.com/c4426/...


I haven't went the extra mile to claim the company is a fraud. I'm simply pointing out that 78 addresses where
some are shelf space-- this can be construed as "stretching" the meaning of "retail stores".


I've also pointed out that "brain cell development" for a supplement product is also undeniably a stretch. This
is not controversial. None of this would be acceptable in US markets.


Don't waste our time attacking independent posters discussing facts with a claim that we are anonymous or
short or based on post count. I have nothing to do with CCA and if you would like to independently verify my
identity, here is my email:


ryutokawai2008@u.north...


Instead of arguing the merits of certain posters, why don't we discuss why we should not care that the
company has not posted 111 addresses, or that they have claimed shelf space to be "retail stores". I saw one
counter-argument to this point, and the gist of the argument was that the revenue contribution from these
stores are relatively small, and therefore we should not care. I disagree, because the truthfulness of claims
made by the company (whether totally false or exaggerated) reflect upon, in my opinion, the ethics of the
company. If you disagree, tell me why. I'm very much less anonymous than you, and welcome a civil and
logical discussion based on verifiable information.

Correction to the previous statement above:


As far as I know, the most recent figure for claimed retail stores is 103 which is dated 06/30/2010. I do not
warrantee the accuracy of any statements and if anyone else has a different number for claimed retail stores
by the company, please feel free to correct me.


The 111 figure was published, and is public, straight from the company's annual report and may be found
through their website. As noted, I understand the latest figure is 103 now, which nonetheless does not match
up with the 79 addresses posted on the company website.

No positions on CHBT. My statements are not buy, sell, short, or cover recommendations for CHBT. Please
do your own homework.

Very interesting ongoing dialogue. Have never posted a comment, but will do so now. I've worked in the investment
mgt industry for 17 years, as an equity analyst & portfolio mgr. I have no position in CHBT. My opinions/observations:
1) Chinese Company Analyst's assessment of CHBT are dead on. He backs up everything he has written. A close
friend of 30 years who travels regularly to Shanghai, Hong Kong, etc. regularly has confirmed much of what CCA has
stated. My friend is short the stock. 2) RAKawai is obviously extremely intelligent and competent. I'd hire him. 3)
Jason Nevader is young and gullible at best. He has not backed up any of his opinions (or any of CHBT's corporate
statements). Jason, have you ever traveled to China or verified existence of any of CHBT's facilities or retail stores?
Maybe you should...Perhaps he should focus his "serial entrepreneurism" elsewhere. 4) Jennifer Arsuaga...funny.
Your comments are meant as a joke, right? If not, you are waaaayyy out of your league! Please do yourself a big
favor and stick to CD's & mutual funds.

How many people did you see at investor day? Do you somehow think that only people who intended investor
day have the ability to post a comment here? Do you find it ironic that they have an investor day? 
If you were willing to go to a staged investor day in China, did you think of doing your own independent
investigation while you were there to determine they were not fraudulent, rather than relying on their spoon
fed tour, prepared documents, and prepared speeches, presentations and representations? 
I find that you tend not to find the flaws when you do your own independent investigation.
