Is the Infamous Toshio Masuda a Private CSKI
Investor?


Posted on October 6, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) Form S-1 registration


statement filed April 11, 2008 lists Abington Company, Ltd.


(“Abington”) as a holder of warrants convertible to 100,000 shares


of CSKI. The S-1 states that Toshio Masuda has “voting and


dispositive power” over the CSKI shares held by Abington.


Reports from the International Herald Tribune and the Daily


Yomiuri, a Japanese newspaper, state that Toshio Masuda is a “self-


styled current affairs commentator” and that “Sunra World Corp.,


which is effectively run by Masuda, collected some 20 billion yen


[US$223 million] from investors by promising high interest but did


not repay the principal and interest.” Some of Masuda’s investors


have reportedly filed a criminal complaint against Masuda,


according to the Daily Yomiuri. Click here to view the press stories


on Masuda and Sunra World Corp.


Abington shared a Hong Kong address with a company called Sunra


Securities Limited, according to a Hong Kong Companies Registry


document. Sunra Securities was 50% owned by Toshio Masuda and


50% owned by his wife, Mariko Ejiri.


According to a Form 144 filed with the SEC on January 19, 2005,


Sunra Luminus Fund, Ltd. filed to sell 79,000 shares of American


Dairy, Inc. (NYSE: ADY) through American Eastern Securities. The


address given for Sunra Luminus Fund, Ltd. was c/o Sunra World


Corp. in Tokyo, Japan, and the form was signed by Mariko Ejiri. Like


CSKI, ADY is a reverse merger arranged by American Eastern


Securities.


Thus, it appears this is the same Toshio Masuda listed in CSKI’s S-1.
