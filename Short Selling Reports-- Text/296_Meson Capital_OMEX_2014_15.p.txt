Oceanica Looks Dead In The Water: Environmental Opposition
Jul. 23, 2014 11:33 AM ET37 comments
by: Meson Capital Partners


Summary


Six+ weeks and counting: EIA still not even filed despite OMEX management saying
“Completed” at Annual Meeting, NI43-101 report also still not filed.


Pro-mining environmentalists and fishing organizations in Baja, Mexico are highly
opposed to Oceanica despite EIA not even filed yet. Oceanica appears to overlap
numerous commercial fishing concessions.


OMEX now in last ditch effort to raise capital by selling unregistered securities in
Oceanica to pay for corporate cash burn before Oceanica could officially be shut
down.


Last month of work at SS Central America only brought up <150 double eagles,
credit line likely already tapped out: OMEX appears to be out of cash in August.


Large Strategic players already evaluated and passed on offshore phosphate mining
in Mexico, not a new idea! Could recreate the Oceanica asset at nominal cost: will
not buy Oceanica.


While we unfortunately don't have the resources or scale like Bill Ackman to spend
$50mm on Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) on the ground primary research, we can afford to go to
the source across the border in Mexico for Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)


The fact that the EIA has not even been filed yet speaks for itself, OMEX has still not
disclosed any details of the extreme challenges and opposition they face locally in Mexico
for their unprecedented Oceanica offshore phosphate mining project.


We covered more about the Oceanica project in our previous articles July 8th highlighting
how the Oceanica project does not pass a basic common sense check and in much more
depth Dec 30 highlighting how the project is not novel and has been tried and failed
before. The large strategic players have been pitched on this idea before and passed. If
they wanted to they could obtain the same permit that Oceanica spent a nominal fee to
obtain and there is no chance they will purchase Oceanica for a premium.

Oceanica even appears to just one of half a dozen similar concessions (English
translation) granted in the last two years for nominal fees. All Oceanica has done is take
surface core samples of an area that has been known for decades has large phosphate
deposits, proving nothing new of substance.


Oceanica overlaps Commercial Fishing Concessions - key to Baja Economy


There are over a dozen environmental groups now zeroing in on Oceanica, highly unusual
to occur even before an EIA to be filed, which typically serves as a forum for open
discussion (there must be an open town hall style meeting to discuss the EIA within 90
days of its filling) The most troubling that we have seen is that the key driver of the
economy in Baja, fishing, is protesting Oceanica. This Fishing Cooperative has substantial
influence and this has not been disclosed by OMEX to shareholders.

Oceanica's area overlaps commercial fishing concessions, the backbone of Baja's
economy

The fishing cooperative in Baja needs the environment to be treated well for their

Offshore Phosphate Mining has Never Been Done and Has Highly Negative
Precedents


In the years that Odyssey has been investing shareholder capital into this unviable project,
the environment for seabed mining has deteriorated rapidly. This has created an
interesting precedent for Odyssey and Oceanica. Recently a seabed dredging project very
similar to Oceanica was swiftly shot down in New Zealand due primarily to "unclear"

benefits to locals as well as serious environmental risk. In regards to the failed Namibian
phosphate project, insiders of UCL resources now face criminal charges and fraud
allegations.


OMEX management has not been transparent with how difficult it is to get through the
numerous stages of approval for a typical mining project, let alone one like offshore
phosphate mining which has never been done commercially anywhere in the world before.

A social movement against mining appeared in Baja California Sur six years ago.
One feature of this movement is its multi-sector composition, being led by
community organizations, rural development NGOs, environmental groups, sectors
of the Catholic Church, and the Media, among others. Such diversity accounts for
the development of "social environmentalism ', i.e. the convergence of the
"distribution criticism", led by social justice movements (political actors) and the
"ecological criticism", led by 17 previously known environmental groups.


The mining industry in Baja California Sur seems to exist in a state of permanent
confrontation with social organizations, resulting in a climate of, generally vulgar
tension and great disrespect for the human dignity of those of us who look upon
mining favorably. Hence, we have the birth of a strong rejection of the industry by
many organizations and sectors of Baja California Sur society, and the lack of
continuous and timely information about the mining projects.


The mining industry in the state of BCS., finds itself, in practical terms, in a holding
pattern. There are only a few exploration licenses that are still valid, but these are
now close to their expiry dates. There are only two operating mines, one in San Juan
de La Costa (ROFOMEX) and the other, La Yesera on the Island of San Marcos,
and two companies operating open air gold mines in the town of La Paz (The
Invecture Group with the Los Cardones project, and Argonaut Gold with the Pitalla
project), whose permissions are pending while waiting for authorization of their EIAs.
They have acceptance and support from the communities surrounding the projects
and from the Federal and Municipal Governments - the State Government is another
matter.


Offshore mining is a veritable "minefield", and they are the victims of collateral
damage resulting from all the bad PR campaigns run by mining companies who
came to the region several years ago. This bad public opinion has continued to grow
in the zone and grows from a broad and complex range of situations, involving not
only the exploitation of resources, but also the distribution of benefits, the polluting of
the environment, differing ideas about what development and creating a desirable
future mean, the rights of the population to decide their own fate, and property
issues, among other things. The Labour Party has entered the struggle against
mining.

Why should shareholders have to read about this in the Mexican newspapers? Why isn't
the Company being more forthcoming with progress of the Project and instead simply
saying "it's completed" and playing shareholders for fools?

Exploraciones Oceanicas´ mining project in Comondu is unviable: Cemda

La Paz, Baja California Sur (BCS) .- The mining project that the company
Exploraciones Oceanicas aims to start in Comondu is inviable both environmentally
and legally, says the Mexican Center of Environmental Law (Cemda), who also calls
for "greater leadership" from state government, which so far, has been devoted to
denying the affair.


Agustín Bravo Gaxiola, the Cemda coordinator for the northwest area, remembers
that the environmental association has asked the Ministry of Fisheries and
Aquaculture (SEPESCA) in BCS to inform them of the steps that have been taken
on the issue whenever the site where the Odyssey Marine Exploration subsidiary
intends to initiate exploration and exploitation of the seabed for phosphate mining is
in the Gulf of Ulloa. This is a potential fishing zone and has the greatest
concentration of loggerhead turtles in the entire Pacific Ocean. A species, he recalls,
that is threatened by incidental fishing. However, the agency continues to ignore the
project, "or at least does not have any information they want to reveal or share."


"We find it a very serious situation. We believe that the Fisheries Ministry should be
the main advocate for this area, with the services it provides to fishing communities,
both for the Gulf of Ulloa and Bahia Magdalena [...] The Gulf of Ulloa is a key area
for fishing and for fisheries in Baja California Sur. It is one of the most important
areas for fisheries productivity in the country".


In the same vein, Bravo Gaxiola recalled that large scale phosphate mining already
exists, meaning it is also unnecessary, he said, to double the level of production
when it is currently more than enough for the state.


"Baja California Sur already has a very high level of phosphate mining, through
Phosphoric Rock, and we think that this is a niche that is already covered so there is
no need to do it somewhere else."


Finally, he said that Cemda will closely monitor the activities of Exploraciones
Oceánicas, beginning in the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources
(SEMARNAT), to resist any gains made by the mining company, "the word is that
they are not slow to request authorization regarding environmental impact".

In a letter addressed to Guillermo Haro, head of the Federal Attorney for
Environmental Protection (Profepa), council members alleged that the Ministry of
Economy gave its permission to the company to establish an underwater phosphate
mine during the dates 28th June 2102 to 27th June 2062.


The complainants stated that the mining project involved "the use of dredging
vessels that remove up to three meters of seabed over an area of 268,328 hectares
for the exploitation of phosphorous, and the remains are later dumped back in the
ocean without any mitigating actions"


In addition, the fishermen in Puerto Chale reported that they saw an Exploraciones
Oceánicas boat operating 80 miles off the coast during the period December 2012 to
March 2013, and that the company later informed them that they would be working
in the area.


However, they said that between February and March, Magdalena Bay fishermen
had found dead dolphins and sea lions and had informed Profepa, but studies were
never undertaken to determine the cause of death.


In the letter sent to Profepa, council members state that "the dredging of phosphate
has not been authorized internationally because the environmental and economic
consequences are catastrophic, and it has never been done anywhere else in the
world". It affects marine ecosystems, as well as the tourism, fisheries and social
sectors."Phosphate is associated with heavy metals such as cadmium, lead,
chromium, nickel and manganese, along with the radioactive material uranium,
which may cause cancer," he warned.


For all of the above, they asked the head of Profepa for "your intervention to stop all
mining activities" from being performed by Exploraciones Oceánicas, and requested
that an EIA be carried out.

OMEX Cash Perilously Low: Likely Bankruptcy punted to August 16th with
additional debt load


We posted two possible cash models on July 10 pending the court unsealing the inventory
levels which would allow one to calculate how much should be available on the Fifth Third
credit line. It appears based on the July 17 unsealing of the inventory that the $7mm net
loan availability should be accurate in our second model.

Comments (37)


Based on this additional debt availability, OMEX should be able to dig themselves a bit
deeper into debt to fund current operations before running out of cash around the second
week of August.


Given that the Odyssey Explorer only recovered <150 double eagles over its last month of
work and won't likely be able to return until mid August, we think it is unlikely any
additional near term monetization is possible from the SS Central America, leaving
Oceanica as the only possible vehicle to fund corporate cash burn of ~$3mm/month at
OMEX.

There are two major mining standards that folks use throughout the world: JORC and NI 43-101.


Because OMEX is not Canadian listed, they are not required to file. However, a lot of non-Canadian
companies provide the technical report because it usually provides basic economics of the project and the
very first requirement in project financing.


At the end of the day, investors should be demanding the technical report! Mining investing is tough enough.
Not sure why anyone would invest in a mining project when they don't even know what they are investing in!

43-101 was put in place because of the Bre-X scandal in the late 90s. Since then I am very careful not to
invest based on management projections and figures (of course they are inflated!). I would feel more
comfortable seeing at least the 43-101.


OMEX will need to release the EIA and 43-101. Smart investors will require it.

In one paragraph, there's a prediction the OE won't return to the shipwreck until afterward: "Odyssey Explorer ... won't
likely be able to return until mid August".


Then in another, there's a prediction of bankruptcy: "running out of cash around the second week of August". (This
after a "mandatory bankruptcy" on July 16 was predicted in an earlier article.)


So, the ship is predicted to go back AFTER they're out of cash??


Well, which is it? Neither of course.

It seems like our OMEX is now two for two or 100% in petitioning to mine in areas first off New Zealand and now off
Baja California which are apparently areas claimed by commercial fishing interests.


Are the sole "good sites for conducting mining activities" located only directly inside or only closely adjacent to areas
claimed by commercial fishing interests? I have rarely seen a company who continues to consistently not reward its
shareholders by spending time and resources on such non-feasible (money and shareholder’s money at that) follies.


What is to prevent OMEX and Chatham from locating future mineral and future mining projects in areas not claimed
by commercial fishing interests such as the big pollution patch in the Pacific Ocean (which is larger than the state of
Texas) where all the plastic flotsam collects? OMEX and Chatham could mine the region if feasible and also clean-up
the region while mining activities are taking place.

Just a warning to all who may be tempted to trade on this article. Meson has been dead wrong on most OMEX related
issues. Both here and in his quarterly letter to his investors he declared that there was no way there was still anything
left on SSCA to salvage and if there had been Tommy Thompson would have gone back clean get it yet OMEX has
pulled at least 25 MM or value from the wreck most of which was just laying on the surface. He said they would be
bankrupt July 16th, which he has now pushed to August 16th. Just too name a few. Meson was down in Q1 despite a
large gain on his OMEX short position goosed by his false claims of imminent bankruptcy.


Do your own DD. If you think, like he does, that OMEX will run out of cash soon then by all means sell it or short it.
But please do not take any of he above as fact without looking deeper at the fact so many of his so called facts have
been either incorrect or just flat out lies.

NYSE: VG is not even a mining company!  
Incorrect, sloppy and misleading...but we are now used to it.


The company presumably being referred to is VG.TO which is the Canadian parent company of the mine, and as
such had TSX filing obligations for NI 43-101 which are very different than what is followed under the SEC Rule 7 for
the mining industry and a very good reason for a Nasdaq company to not file unless circumstances, such as an
announced acquisition, are required by the SEC. 
The more clamoring from a short for anything is a good reason to head the other direction. Besides, since you've told
us that bankruptcy is now less than one month away, filing of anything other than Chapter 11 protection is all that
matters isn't it?

It's embarrassing to see someone stoop to such low levels to eke out a little return for his fund. Manipulating retail
shareholders just because he can.


Let's turn this around and ask Ryan a few questions.


Are you aware of any mine any where that has ever been approved unopposed? Are we really supposed to believe
that this one is "dead in the water" because of some uninformed environmental opposition? How can these
environmental groups even form the basis of an opinion when there has not been a public filing of the MIA? Yet we're
supposed to believe that they've got the project stopped?

Did you do any digging to find support for the project? Thought not. So much for a balanced viewpoint, huh?


Can you think of any positive reasons for not filing the MIA? Might it be that Oceanica is a highly attractive strategic
asset and has attracted the attention of large interests who don't want the filing done at this point?


Are the fishing concessions overlapping the actual mining area? The concession is massive, but they will only mine a
small part of it, and you don't know what part because they haven't filed the MIA. They've told us they'll mine 40 miles
out, and this looks to be beyond most fishing concessions.


You call the Trans Tasman Resource mine very similar to Oceanica but in reality they are a world apart. TTR was in
an environmentally sensitive spot, was much closer to shore, and didn't offer much in the way of benefits to NZ.
Oceanica is a huge strategic gift to BCS and Mexico. It is far from any environmentally sensitive spots and is far
offshore.


If it's so difficult to mine in Mexico, why is it one of the top mining jurisdictions in the world? Why did KPMG vote it into
the top five as a mining-friendly destination?

Only 150 double eagles ---- That's a lot of bucks and you forgot to mention all the other items recovered. Sure it
wasn't as much as the previous month but Odyssey was a tad bit busy, moving out of Hurricane Arthur's way and
spending a majority of time (while on site) clearing coal and debris from the collapsed ship, to get at more valuables.
Their next finds inventory, may not settle well with your large short position. 
Also Mexico is pushing hard for phosphate mining. Their president recently announced a 450 mil grant to PEMEX for
a phosphate plant (do a search for PEMEX/phosphate for more info). Since very little land in Mexico is fertilized, there
is a HUGE market for phosphate, with Mexico's new incentives. Let's see --- a few fisherman vs a country of farmers -
-- Hmmmm!

Balanced research would find that the Mexican President Pena Nieto launched a national campaign against hunger a
year ago which has many multi-national companies involved in. This April the Ministry SAGARPA (argriculture &
fisheries) announced a major program to encourage more domestic fertilizer production since over half is imported
and some 40% of agricultural lands under-produce due to lack of fertilizers. Hunger in the country side is thus a
national priority. The only other viable phosphate mines in Mexico are on the east coast of Baja California Sur, and
were shut down for over five years from hurricane Juliette, thus a second source is strategically critical for food
security...remember the Tortilla Riots that were triggered by a spike of fertilizer prices in 2008? Even Pemex is getting
into the fertilizer act, re-opening a facility in Pajaritos, Veracruz which could well become a DAP fertilizer plant if they
find the phosphate ore to supply it. 
The truth of opposition locally is really about defining which local groups will share in the mining royalties recently
approved as a split of some 4% to the national government and another 3% to the local communities impacted. It is
defining the latter which is really going on behind the scenes. In fact the local fishing industry is nearly entirely

miles from the mining. From this distance, the reality of environmental concerns is largely mitigated by proper sand
dredging practices such as those used for decades in offshore aggregate dredging near the British and Dutch coast
lines. Boskailis will get it right! Farther offshore the fishing activity mostly relates to illegal night-time shark fishing and
endangered sea turtle (thus the NGOs are severely at odds with the "pangistas"). You can see from the commercial
offerings of the local cooperatives that they are close to subsistence fishing rather than large commercial operations
that are found in the Gulf of Mexico and Golfo de California. The fishermen want nothing to do with the NGOs, and
once they know the reality about where the mining takes place and its safeguards, will cut their deal for a piece of the
pie. All the rest is typical posturing that the Mexican government will sort out based on the greater good of the
Mexican people and off course the PRI knows how to get it done...even without the helping insights of Meson Capital.

The Mexican ‘tortilla riots’ that took place between 2007-2010 were sparked by rising corn prices. The public
rioted to push the government to intervene in the tortilla industry to keep prices as an affordable rate.


September 2012 - CNBC Interview  
World leaders must take swift action to avert a possible food price shock in 2013, Mexico’s President Felipe
Calderon says, warning unchecked price volatility in staple food items could trigger an escalation in poverty to
crisis levels.


“I'm afraid that this new phenomenon of rising of prices of food around the world will provide a new round of
crisis related with poverty,” Calderon told CNBC in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.


“The problems in Africa, even the Arab spring, in my opinion are some way or another related to the price of
food,” Calderon said, adding that next year could mark “a new round of very high prices.”

“All the countries should do something and quickly in order to avoid any social and political turmoil around the
world,” he added.


Mexico suffered a popular backlash after corn prices surged in 2007, making tortillas — the staple food
product in Mexico — more expensive, and sparking ‘tortilla riots’ in major cities across the central American
country.


Mr Pescador: you may not care to be informed about the bigger picture, but your countrymen are in need of
fertilizers for their ejidos. Also be aware that the Rofomex mine you are so comfortable with is an ecological
disaster waiting to happen. The large retaining wall is in danger of collapsing during an earthquake or
hurricane, which will release years of mine waste into the Golfo de California. You may not really know what
to believe, but given your association with Ryan Morris, you seem to have chosen ignorance and distortions
where to make your bed.

good job Ryan, most of the posters are so witless, you are in a different league. Its incredible to think people who
think 'they are talking to the army' are in the trading world to begin with, or those who think the cash is actually
strapped, but perceptions rule and in a sea of one-eyed, you've proven your point, go for the stupid investors. I still
think you should worry about an exit plan, since army gold is still out there, and its all for the salvager, so I am long
and you are short, lets see, you can have this round, perhaps we'll lose the less intelligent, and the rest will be harder
to knock out, but I am ready to see it go down, since the field needs clearing out, once that happens, hopefully soon, it
can't be stopped and you know that.

  have never been social tortilla riots case you live in mexico mexico to realize no mistake disagreements for the price.
do not believe everything you see on the Internet


an example of The Los Angeles riots of 1992, also known as the Rodney King uprising or the Rodney King riots,


  is true that the Mexican countryside urgently needed new technologies and fertilizers but but the project is not the
oceanic medium term solution fishermen are not against the project no mistake we are against strategies based on
lies of its managers


   It is a false rumor about the retaining wall of a Mexican rofomex is competent to oceanica


perhaps you think government officials and society know what to do  
the wall is not a problem is ys yl is none of your business  
  to sr.Morris and never seen this side but the truth and you're on the side of the speculation and lies because you're a
friend of the great liars of Oceanica.que say thanks to perforations doubled their reserves pure lies lie

Who, how much where when? Where is your donation going? Your worshiping public is dying to know. How
old were you when those events occurred? The King riots 20 some yrs ago? I'll promise YOU weren't there.
What relevance has it to the issue at hand? And, for the 10th time I will ask, which charity, how much when
and where?

Hope you enjoyed your holiday ride Ryan. Has the irony yet struck you that you would be working to incite
environmental opposition to Oceanica, a project which is essential to feed the next generation in the Mexican
country side desperately in need of fertilizer for self-survival? Do you realize how widely damaging stopping a
phosphate mine will reverberate throughout the Mexican social economy? Just who is it that your charity
feeds? Certainly not Mexican kids. Keep up the good work however.

Well done, Tincup.


Reminds me of the time when Ryan condemned OMEX's auditor and demanded they be fired after finding a
few minor deficiencies in one of their PCAOB reports. Then another reader noticed that Morris's own firm, LEI
(where he had served as Chairman until publishing the OMEX report) used a small auditor which had many
more PCAOB deficiencies than OMEX's auditor. Ah, the irony.

Senator Ricardo Barroso Agramon warned of the risk that runs fishing activity in the State of Baja California Sur, on
the pretense of private companies start the exploitation and exploration of phosphates on the seabed of the Gulf of
Ulloa.Ante this situationBarroso Agramont presented to the Standing Committee a point of agreement which calls on
the Ministry of economy that are cancelling, may revoke, cancel or not granted permits for the exploitation of
phosphate and other minerals which is intended to remove from the bottom of the sea of Baja California, to avoid the
ecological impact.In his argument, the legislator said that according to the Mexican Center of environmental law this
project is unworkable and unnecessary because there is already a very large phosphate exploitation in the State."The
only producer of phosphorite in our country state is Baja California Sur, the production of this mineral in 2012 was 1
million seven hundred twenty-four thousand six hundred sixty-two tonnes, which represented a value of 1.24 billion
pesos,"he revealed."The PRI Senator highlighted the need of proposition because, he said, there is the certainty that
the marine mining activities can produce effector harmful serious to the marine environment, which will affect the
fishing industry in the area."At the time that widespread extraction of minerals in the sea, the consequences for
fisheries would be serious, since the chemical components become toxic when it increases the concentration of the
same.

Ryan,


Below is a chronological summary of you crying "Wolf" with respect to OMEX's imminent bankruptcy:


In your 10/31/13 piece you said that OMEX would run out of cash in "2-3 quarters."


On July 8th you wrote, "What possibility does OMEX have to survive Q3 without filing for bankruptcy (We initially
predicted an equity filing or bankruptcy raise Oct 31, 2013 within 12 months and continue to believe this is on track)?"
So, you misrepresented your earlier call, which had one year as the maximum length of life for OMEX, and you
estimated BK during Q3.


On July 10th, you predicted bankruptcy on July 16th.


On July 17th, you said that cash balances should "hit zero" during the first week of August.


On July 23rd you said, "OMEX Cash Perilously Low: Likely Bankruptcy punted to August 16th."


On July 30th you wrote, "We believe OMEX will file bankruptcy before EIA is filed - only weeks of cash remaining."


So, Ryan, that's at least six predictions of bankruptcy. You've been wrong every single time. You've also been shown
to have misrepresented all manner of facts about OMEX and to have omitted significant material information in your
"research."


My question is this: is that embarrassing to you? Or is the sting of that embarrassment eased by the fact that you
were exiting your short as you dissolved your fund, and you were able to talk the stock lower with false promises of
bankruptcy? I'm sure all the shorts that helped you out of your position (at a personal gain to you) are going to be very
happy with your oh-so-ethical behavior as the stock rallies now.
