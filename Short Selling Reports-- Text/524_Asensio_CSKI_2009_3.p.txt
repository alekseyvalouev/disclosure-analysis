Are China Sky’s Financials Believable?


Posted on April 17, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: CSKI) shares have traded as


high as 63% above the low set two days ago. On the surface, the


market action seems a response to the company filing its 2008 Form


10-K, which had been delayed since March 31. Yet CSKI had already


announced its revenue and net income in a press release on April 7.


Beneath the surface, there seem to be good reason to question not


just the stock’s irregular trading, but China Sky’s audited results as


well.


China Sky had to restate its 2006 earnings twice, reducing net


income from $4.3 million to $600,000. The company had three


auditors at different times in 2007 alone, and has had four auditors


in the last three years. More alarming is that all four of CSKI’s


auditors have been the subject of controversies concerning auditing


improprieties. Also concerning is the number of penny stocks


audited by its 2007 auditor.


Investors should also be aware that China Sky is the product of a


reverse-merger with an immaterial shell. China Sky’s shell had only


$40,000 in equity immediately prior to the reverse-merger.


Investors should carefully examine the history of China Sky’s


backers and other involved parties, including American Eastern


Securities, Global Hunter Securities, Guerrilla Capital, Pope Asset


Management, and Halter Financial.


CSKI’s current auditor is MSPC. Since May 2006, CSKI’s other


auditors have been Sherb & Co. LLP, Murrell Hall McIntosh & Co.,


PLLP, and e-Fang Accountancy Corp.


MPSC was formerly known as Moore Stephens, P.C. The firm was at


the center of a scandal in the 1990’s involving Robert Brennan and


First Jersey Securities. Moore Stephens was sanctioned by the SEC


in 1999 for its involvement with Brennan. There are only two

people on the Moore Stephens website listed having experience


with China. One of them is Angelo Coppolino. Mr. Coppolino is one


of the Moore Stephens employees named specifically in the SEC


sanction from 1999.


Sherb & Co., based in Boca Raton, Florida, has had its own


problems. A sampling of Sherb & Co.’s other clients include


Proguard Acquisition Corp. (OTC BB: PGRD $1.05), Neuro-Hitech,


Inc. (OTC BB: NHPI $0.06), Lotus Pharmaceutical, Inc. (OTC BB: LTUS


$0.28), and Electronic Sensor Technology, Inc. (OTC BB: ESNR $0.04).


The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued an


inspection report on Sherb & Co. in June 2007, stating that it had


found deficiencies in Sherb’s audits, including “a deficiency of such


significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm


did not obtain sufficient competent evidential matter to support its


opinion on the Issuer’s financial statements.”


Murrell, Hall, McIntosh & Co, PLLP was the subject of an informal


investigation by the SEC’s Enforcement Division. The SEC raised


concerns about Murrell Hall’s audit of American Dairy, Inc., another


US-listed Chinese reverse-merger. CSKI dismissed Murell Hall after


news of the SEC investigation came out.


e-Fang Accountancy was sanctioned in 2008 by the California Board


of Accountancy. The sanction stated that e-Fang “admitted to


committing gross negligence, violating professional standards, and


failing to issue a report in accordance with professional standards


in performing an audit.”


China Sky management stated in its earnings conference call


yesterday that the company is trying to improve its corporate


governance and transparency. If that were the case, surely they


could have found a better auditor than Moore Stephens.


CSKI’s devotion to corporate governance seems more doubtful


considering the recent election to its board of directors of a 25-year-


old graduate student, to serve on the audit committee as a


“financial expert.”
