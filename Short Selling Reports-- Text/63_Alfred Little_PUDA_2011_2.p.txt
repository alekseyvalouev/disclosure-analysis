Puda Coal Chairman's $12 Buyout Offer: The Most Doubtful LBO of All
Time
May 3, 2011 9:02 AM ET91 comments
by: Alfred Little


On Friday, Puda Coal (AMEX: PUDA) announced that its Chairman Ming Zhao is willing to
buy out the shares of PUDA he does not already own at a price of up to $12 per share,
provided he can find financing to do so. The offer is nonbinding and preliminary with no
financing, timeline or any degree of certainty in place.


This would obviously be an incredibly good deal for PUDA shareholders considering
Chinese public records show CITIC purchased 49% of PUDA’s operating subsidiary,
Shanxi Coal for only $37.1 million on 7/15/10, which at the time valued PUDA at only
$1.91 per share. Another measure of PUDA’s intrinsic value is the book value of PUDA’s
investment in Shanxi Coal that is only $3.41 per share. By comparison, $12 per share
seems like a great exit. So would $15, $20, or $30 per share, if any of these were
achievable. Dream on!


Unfortunately, Chairman Zhao is extremely unlikely to find any way to finance the
purchase of the approximately 20.5 publicly held shares. At $12 per share he needs over
$246 million to close the deal. Shanxi Coal is already wildly leveraged thanks to Zhao’s
secret dealings (documented in my previous article) and owes $530.3 million 14.5% debt
to CITIC payable in 3 years.


By my estimates, Shanxi Coal’s 2011 cash flow is insufficient cover the $76.9 million
interest and fees payable to CITIC in 2011. If its mines are upgraded successfully and can
produce according to plan the $530.3 million debt can possibly be serviced in 2012.
Therefore adding another $246 million debt to Shanxi Coal in 2011 is impossible and
certainly would not be in the best interests of CITIC. Remember CITIC completely controls
the company through its 49% ownership and 51% share pledge, veto and voting rights.
Why would CITIC have any interest in adding more debt when the existing debt can hardly
be repaid?


So if Zhao can’t use Shanxi Coal as collateral, what other possibilities are there?
Furthermore why should anyone trust Zhao after the discovery of his secret dealings in the
past (see my previous article) resulted in the plunge in share price and the stock being

halted, Zhao's voluntary leave of absence, and a lengthy investigation? Some claim Zhao
is rich. Perhaps he would be willing to pledge his other assets (outside of Shanxi Coal) to
borrow $246 million to buy PUDA’s publicly held float.


But perhaps he has pledged those assets already. Zhao's other assets might be just as
heavily leveraged as Shanxi Coal. I cannot imagine any offshore bank will lend to him
after the PUDA fiasco, and keep in mind he needs an offshore bank to lend dollars to buy
out U.S. shareholders. He is certainly aware the $12 (maximum) offering price is over 6X
the $1.91 valuation CITIC paid in 2010. He also knows $12 is the price at which PUDA
sold 7.85 million shares in its most recent public offering.


So Zhao’s “up to $12” offer is really his way of saying “I will try to make the most recent
PUDA investors whole on their investment, eventually, if I can. Trust me.” Zhao is trying to
be a politician, in other words. Do you trust him? When he sold half of Shanxi Coal to
CITIC, without disclosing the sales to investors, where did the $37 million in proceeds go?
At the very least the missing $37 million needs to be accounted for by the Board before
Zhao's $12 offer can be taken seriously.


Sometime in 2012, if Shanxi Coal is performing well enough (something only Zhao will
truly know), then he might then be willing mortgage his other assets (assuming they aren’t
already mortgaged) to fund a $12 takeout. On the other hand if Shanxi Coal is not
servicing its huge debt then CITIC will take the 51% pledged shares and Zhao and U.S.
investors are left with nothing. Again, I must emphasize that only Zhao truly knows how
Shanxi Coal is truly performing. Today the offer is “up to $12”. Tomorrow it could be
nothing, or $5 or $10. Only Zhao knows. Only Zhao will win in this rigged game.


So what do I expect PUDA shares to do if they ever reopen for trading? The legal
quagmire may never get sorted out. PUDA may never trade again. PUDA will clearly not
be able to consolidate the earnings (most likely losses due to the tremendous cost of the
debt in 2011) of its Shanxi Coal subsidiary.


I estimate book value of PUDA’s investment in Shanxi Coal is $3.41 per share. Zhao’s “up
to $12” offer is purely political to temporarily appease purchasers of the most recent public
offering. Perhaps, if all goes well for Zhao, he will decide to fund his offer 12-18 months
from now. I wouldn't bet on it. I suspect most serious investors share my point of view. So
if the shares ever re-open for trading and if Zhao’s offer is still on the table, I will make the
wild guess that the shares will settle into the $8.4 to $9 range (reflecting the 25-30%
discount other LBO plays are averaging).

But this price is a steep premium to the $1.91 valuation CITIC paid less than a year ago
so I believe the shares would then likely drift lower as Zhao is obviously not going to be in
any hurry to advance such a premium priced offer until serious uncertainty over Shanxi
Coal’s financial solvency is resolved, for better or for worse.


Disclosure: I am short PUDA.

Alfred, personally I think the Chairman's proposal could be successful and in the end will be similar to the proposal of
the CEO of CSR. If the guy has good connections with Chinese financial institutions financing is not the problem.

akhait
exactly right. now, he'll only have to come up with the shares to complete the transaction, and THAT could be
tricky... and expensive once this one is trading.  
if it's not trading but proceeding with a $12/share buyout, I'm not even sure how you settle - maybe $12/share
cash settlement on the day transaction closes?

Where are the assets that were acquired with the $530m? Won't those assets generate considerable earnings? Isn't it
hard to speculate on their 2012 earnings without knowing where the $530m went?

I personally think very few cared about this preliminary non-binding "buyout" proposal contingent on future financings,
given how many failed, non-materializing LBOs of Chinese RTOs you get out there. Hell, even the ones with
supposedly secured financing haven't gone through. Why $12? If the Chairman really believes the company (at least
the other half that haven't got stolen by him) is more what he's pitched, he should have offered $40+, not a token
price of $12. Honestly, after stealing the company and securing a legal PRC ownership of the assets for himself, what
incentive he's got for spending the $200+ million buying the worthless PUDA shares in the US. Plus, I seriously doubt
any offshore fund is willing to lend him the USD after what he's done at PUDA.

Chris Wu, Contributor
Courts? What can US investors like you do in a Chinese courts? US courts have no jurisdiction in a
completely legal share transfer happened in PRC. Too sad. If you don't think it's legal, the best way to is give
CITIC a call and challenge them about PUDA Chairman's sale, I'm willing to bet how bad you get laughed at.


I see you still haven't quit the cheerleadering squad? Have you figured out what's going on with all those
share transfers after you've been enlightened many times by me and other people?

You never answer questions Mr Woo. Are u invested here ? I am not so why u keep referring to me as an
investor is foolish ? I also asked you several days ago , since u are such a expert in Chinese law, to support
your definitive contention that US investors would have no hearing in Chinese legal system - your repsonse
was NONE.


"US courts have no jurisdiction in a completely legal transfer..."


Courts dont but investors can. Your statement is so foolish...dont u proof read ?


Again - a recording of the share transfer DOES NOT signify its legality. A chinese court ruling will and they
have not in the past always viewed these "recordings" of transfers as legit.


03 May 2011, 01:25 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
please read my comments to your questions/challenges/p... attacks under the other articles written by Mr.
Little.


Instead of wasting your time arguing with me here, why don't you update me AFTER you have successfully
sued and recovered from CITIC and MZ what he's initially stolen from you? Don't wait for your "responsible"
independent directors to do some CYA type of stuff.


BTW, you kept saying a recording of the share transfer does not signify its legality. Ask yourself, if it's so
obviously illegal like you even figured, you think CITIC's high-paying PRC legal counsel will fail to catch that?
Think again.


 
I stick to my statement that US courts and US investors have no recourse against a completely LEGAL share
transfer conducted between a PRC person and a PRC entity in the PRC.


Since you kept saying my statements were foolish, I'd like to counter that with the fact that your
actions/statements were not only foolish but quite immature, especially considering you kept launching
personal attacks behind a recently registered SA alias.


To answer your question about whether I had a position here, I can tell you I'm still short some PUDA but
hardly a meaningful amount to motivate me to constantly checking PUDA related discussion every single day

I comment on what u say Wu not who u are...I have no idea who u are and frankly dont care. For all I / we
know u may be Alfred Little and he u. You certainly "parrot" your support for all of his statements. So dont
take this message board personally...

To summarize the situation as I understand it.


1. According to Alfred, CITIC bought half of Shanxi for $37 million and then was willing to loan $500+ million 'secured'
against the other half. I still call BS on that. 
2. Zhao and his brother own a minimum of 30%+ of the company and yet have "sold PUDA out from under [American]
investors". Hmmm, that would have hurt themselves the most of all. I call BS. [Even so, Alfred actually clears up in the
comments of his last article that the most 'stolen' could have been 35%.] 
3. Alfred has alleged that PUDA has somehow spend $500+ million in CITIC loan money since July. Ha ha. Not to
mention that they somehow managed to spend that much money without creating anything of value according to his
'analysis'. 
4. The DEER lawsuit (see recent news) alleges that Alfred Little doesn't exist as bio-ed and is just a front for short-
sellers.


I think there is going to be a pretty big short squeeze when this thing starts trading again and I think Zhao's offer is
more real that the analysis offered here.

Alfred, I do not think Mr. Zhao is in the win win situation. Even if he can pull out money from PUDA, he still need to
deal with the Chinese government and the U.S. He rather spends assets and financing to buy the company so that he
will not be in trouble. He might thinks through after one month.

Alfred, I do not think Mr. Zhao is in the win win situation. Even if he could get the money out from PUDA; he still needs
to be responsible with stock holders and the goverment. Therefore, he might have to use all of his assets and the
financing to buy the company; otherwise, he will be in trouble.

I personally think the book value should be increased due to recent consolidation of three miners in Shanxi. Also, the
CEO does not have any problem to finance the buyout money by listing in Shanghai or Hongkong market. So far, he
has not done yet.

I would think #1 on Zhao's list is how to save his bacon in a land that is known to be pretty harsh on those that run
blantantly afoul of the law and add any further taint to a burgeoning economy that desparately needs clean up its act
in order to help restore credibilty with the rest of the world. I think think this is going to be much more of a motivating
factor to make shareholders whole who were blindsided by this alleged fraud, then any opinion posted on this board.
Worse comes to worse this becomes a tax write off which at least provides some value to this debacle.

just dissapearing.

canb888
It is illegal to lend money at 14.5% in China. CITIC is a major institution that will not do blatantly illegal things.
Therefore, whoever is saying CITIC lent Rmb3.5 billion at 14.5% is just BS. Also, Rmb3.5B is a big sum anywhere
and it would need approval at the highest level within CITIC and the release of the funds would be controlled, not just
a big check for the guy to do whatever he wanted to. The story is strange and not that credible. Just MHO.

Chairman just raised $55 via selling part of his stake in King Stone Energy. The only doubt left is whether they
can come to an agreement on price. Most longs on PUDA won't accept below say $15. The company has
assets in the $30-40 range, but the China discount might cause to it go much lower.

Wu:


"Why hasn't the company provided any news about the Chairman's progress of obtaining any financing?"


Now I know you are just defending a mistake. You can't possible believe that a general offer with obvious but polite
intent to negotiate a final deal could possibly be far enough along to announce any news.


Add to that, Zhao asked in the offer for privacy. Read it again if you don't recall.


In due time........In due time......but it will be expedited once it's rolling. He said that too.........in the 13 filing.

Chris - You claim to be a hedge fund analysts, yet you don't understand basic principles of a public company.
Do you honestly believe the buyout can just be approved in days or weeks? Absolutely not. The board would
be worried they would get sued that way as well. Unfortunately you are trying to spin something for negative
publicity because either 1) you don't have a clue about public companies or 2) you are just following Al Little
and Geo around touting them because you work for Geo.


Either way you cheerleading above makes you a great "contributor" to this site if they classify contributor as
someone that runs around babbling nonsense purely to help support your cronies.

1. Reposting my answer to your repeatedly meaningless personal attacks:


"The game for CBEH or SCEI fraud is over period. I respect people who make money investing by working
hard and doing more DD than the ones at other end of the trade, be it long or short. People, like you, making
meaningless personal attacks to the author (for exposing a fraud) should seriously considered getting a life.


My advice is next time you spend more time doing your homework, before you losing your lifetime saving in a
fraudulent stock, jumping up and down like a little boy or starting some meaningless website.


To answer your question, I do contribute (at least more actionable investment ideas than you). Obviously
people like you enjoying hiding behind a pseudonym trashing contributor, instead of learning to read and
LEARN from other people's hard work and valuable research. When was the last time you EVER contribute
anything that warrant any serious attention? Maybe the lesson for you here is to look and think carefully
before making a stupid attack against any author who actually contributes something valuable."


2. Yes AB, you're totally right. I work for Geo REALLY. Before you make a comment like this, run it through
your head?


16 May 2011, 10:24 AM


Chris Wu, Contributor
So I keep my promise to remind all investors these questions every week - So exactly when is this buyout
happening? Why hasn't the company provided any news about the Chairman's progress of obtaining any

Until any one of the above changes, I remain highly skeptical of there's actually going to be a buyout. FYI

Check out CFSG. Bain Capital working with the management team on that deal.


Also, its absurd to think they would give the market a play by play on the financing. Your assuming they have
a deal to begin with. Shareholders don't want just $12. PUDA is worth a ton more then that. Also, you seem to
have missed that the Chairman sold $55M worth of KSE stocks. Hum, wonder what he plans to do with all
that cash?

I have been busy working on other projects, but I am hearing that Zhao's other companies and investments
are also over-leveraged. If you have time maybe you could research them.

Obviously no shareholders wanted or expected the chairman and founder of the company to do something that
initially seems to at least lack disclosure, and at the most commit fraud. You have to admit, many things just don't add
up, especially that Ming would destroy his value in Puda holdings of $100m or so for a $37m cheque. Even a
fraudster isn't that stupid. I think it is possible that we are all, including you and GEO are missing several pieces to
this puzzle. It is simply too premature to draw definitive conclusions. We are just guessing.


If you are very confident in GEO's analysis, than you should all just let your short ride out the storm and cover at $0.
Let's all just wait for the facts and stop making crap up.

5/18/2018 Puda Coal Chairman's $12 Buyout Offer: The Most Doubtful LBO of All Time - Puda Coal, Inc. (NYSEMKT:PUDA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/267206-puda-coal-chairmans-12-buyout-offer-the-most-doubtful-lbo-of-all-time 12/23


conspired with the prominent CEO of a US listed coal company, Puda Coal (symbol PUDA) to bilk US investors out of
ownership interest in a profitable Chinese operating sub located in the province of Shanxi.


Puda's shares crumbled on the US exchanges, falling over 40% representing hundreds of million in losses. Puda
officials confirmed that they were investigating the CEO's actions, and had asked him to take a leave of absence.
Trading was halted in the US and has remained so - class action lawsuits have proliferated. Little additional comment
from the company, its CEO, or the PRC through it investment firm has been forthcoming.


If the allegations are true, this will indeed mark an ugly turn in the murky world of reverse - mergers: Chinese
operating firms trading in the US through shell holding companies. This sector has been rotting with fraud allegations,
accounting scandels, any other charges of illegality.


Insiders report that it may all come down to a ruling by the Chinese Provincial Courts on whether the recording of the
share transfer is legal. Steps to transfer the shares by the Puda CEO and Citic may have been executed properly, but
the courts must eventually rule on the overall legality of the transaction. Regardless this would draw into the spotlight
the PRC itself and the actions of its official investment arm at a time when PRC bashing by US presidential
candidates is building."

This what MZ really needs to worry about...


NEW YORK, May 5, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milberg LLP reminds shareholders that the lead plaintiff motion
deadline in securities lawsuits against Puda Coal, Inc. ("Puda" or the "Company") (NYSE Amex:PUDA) is June 13,
2011. On April 21, 2011, the firm filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of investors who purchased the securities of
Puda during the period November 13, 2009, to April 11, 2011, inclusive (the "Class Period").


The case, Burquist v. Puda Coal Inc., No. CV11-03412, is pending in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California and alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Puda and certain of the
Company's officers.

Wu, I am not at all surprised that you are cheerleading the ambulance chasers, but truth be told, this is not a
fraud. It's a hostile take over/buyout to move it, the organization, out of US equity hands and into the private
hands of the original founders.

It's been a misread by shorts since day one because of the need to believe it was another China fraud
company to hang on the wall like a trophy.


Locating the documents has just moved the timetable up about a year, and now it's probably a done deal. The
Chinese do long term plans and move slowly. Now they have to catch up the plans with the realities and I'm
betting shareholders missed a good opportunity here, had it progressed in it's natural timeframe.


As it is, I'll have to settle for a two bagger.....Darn shame.

note that investors have recourse in the PRC as well Wu....so read them...unless of course u cant read

such jibberish and absolute baloney. You keep reaching sir but you've been coming up empty. You say one thing that
contradicts something else you said 4 or 5 posts ago. You can't even make up your mind what is what. Just like on the
Yahoo board (Yes, it's obvious you're nec500 or whatever that ID is). Your argument is seriously flawed but what else
would we expect from someone trying to defend a flawed argument. Little's argument/hit piece is so full of holes yet
you try and defend it/him. You follow him around SA like your his little bitch. If Alfy stopped quickly your head would

I have a small long position in PUDA. I have no idea what to do, if anything. Should I just wait, or try to join a Class
Action suit, or have a sell order in case it starts trading again, or what?


The other thing is that if Chinese authorities don't make this right, many investors will never again trust Chinese
business practices. If Mr. Zhao can't make this right, then Chinese authorities should take him out, legally or
otherwise, as a lesson to others. If they can't do it, then we should.


Much of the stuff out of China is crap. Quality is down everywhere, Chinese crap fails because they switch suppliers
like wildfire to save a penny. There are many examples. Many of them will say anything, print anything, whatever it
takes to get the export and sale done. There are no ethics, particularly toward anyone who is not Chinese...they view
foreigners as dogs...well, I know who the dogs are. Witness the Melamine-in-pet food/other foods scam. I've never
heard of such a terrible, intentional, dangerous bald-faced lie. Permanent press fabrics are now unreliable because
they change to some crap chemical sourced through their brother-in-law with a kickback. Electronic stuff dies in 6
months, when American or Japanese stuff lasted practically forever, because they buy some crap copied down the
street, leaving the quality supplier (who is probably chinese also... they don't care who they screw) was left in the
dust.


Buy European, American (including all the Americas) or Japanese, maybe a few other places. Boycott China.
Manufacturers will rue the day that they started sending work there.

Why do you think the Chairman just raised $55M? Well, it could be to just make PUDA shareholder hole, but
then again it could be to pay for the deal. His family has plenty of money.


Its all just a matter of whether they can agree on terms. You seem to not understand that PUDA shareholders
aren't willing to accept a $12 offer.

Every day PUDA trading is halted is another day the probability increases that PUDA was involved in a fraud. Same
with Sino forest (TRE), Rino International, most RTOs listed in the US markets.


It would be blind to freely believe Chinese growth figures and its disconnected growth from the rest of the world, when
a growing number of fraud cases are coming to light.

Lets see what the SEC really has to say by year end. It will not be MW centric though my good friend.

Chris Wu, Contributor
Finally, Arthur_Big is not starting a sentence with a derogatory comment such as "Allegations without proof -

AB - what have you done except bashing the authors and research firms that have done real DD and exposes
the frauds in our capital markets? You seem to think your bashing approach against them and your intention
to twist facts and other people's words are better ways to resolve the key issue of protecting the investors
from stock frauds?


I'd really like to see what SEC really has to say by the year end, especially, according to my personal
conversation with several staff, they have repeatedly shown so much interests in the real frauds that have
been exposed by research firms.


Still, you failed to answer my question why you kept hinting me something's coming before today's fabricated
SEC press release about a fake lawsuit against MW? Why do you keep hiding behind your pseudonym and
writing baseless accusations, solely based on your flawed understanding securities regulations as well as
your intention to twist facts? Disclose your real name/address so we can publicly settle all your charges in
some transparent ways, will you?


IMHO, the investigation into RTO frauds won't be stock and company centric, my friend.

Funny, has any remaining PUDA bull seen even the 1st draft of a merger agreement yet? Once you get that 1st draft,
it takes another two years before your deal really closes, assuming nothing else happens in that process and MZ is
really that dumb to spend some money buying a shell company with some assets him already owns on the PRC side.

Although you still owe answers to the numerous questions I asked before, I think the price PUDA.PK re-

you sir, with your "30+ years of diversified experience, CFA + MBA + University Professor", happen to invest

Instead of running around and bashing short sellers who really do honest research to expose fraud and heal
the market, why don't you, the person hiding behind the alias Arthur_Big, try to figure out some real way to
protect average investors against stock frauds. That would give you at least some tiny amount of credibility
given your repeated refusal to answer other people's valid questions and your "sincere" warnings to totally
fraudulent companies (such as CHNG) about someone who's about to expose their fraud.


Oh wait a minute, were you the one that claimed authorities were actively reaching out to you? Would you like
me to post your exact wording of your statement?


Like I said, even if you have never directly hyped or pumped a stock scam (at least not under this alias of
yours), you're no different than the NYGG, Red Chip type of shady stock scam promoters. Seriously, why
don't you reveal your true identity and we can settle this in court, since you appear to be "so sure" I'm the bad
guy here.

would be willing to (I am just reporting the news) yet you operate under an alias and claim to live in china yet now you
claim to live in the U.S....... Not sure who NYGG is, but they are not my peers.


Chris Wu:  
looks like you lack of some basic ability to read and comprehend. I stated on multiple occasions that I'm a US citizen
residing here in the US. If you and your fraudsters, scam promoters friends even have the slightest guts to come

you were involved with. Yes, you know which one I was referring to - your supernatural ability to learn things
before it happens. What things? Well I don't know, maybe a fake SEC PR fraud? I'd like to point out to

o did the fraudsters at CHNG ever send you their appreciation about your warning against the "manipulation"
aka the fraud exposing research piece from Geoinvesting? It's hard to imagine you were not associated with
any of those shady stock promoters, such as the ones like NYGG, Red Chip etc.


I'm sure there's no need to disclose any monetary compensation type of arrangement, because you were
definitely not paid these scam companies or its supporter to do this.


Okay okay, I get it. You never trade Chinese stocks. You're just writing these bashing posts and hiding behind
an alias for the sake of doing a public service.


Piece of advice for you - figure out some real ways to protect average investors being tricked into frauds such
as CHNG instead of sending such a friendly warning to the criminal management about someone's intention
to expose the fraud. Of course, you don't give a damn because you really weren't compensated for doing all
this.

You can't imagine anyone doing anything for the good of society.


I never said you lived in china. I said you live in Hong Kong. That is directly from your Linkedin page, which was on

I don't even remember my password since the last time I logged in was....well, when I was in HK? Oh wait a
minute, when did I ever go to HK?


The person behind Arthur_Big has proven to be a total liar again and a manipulator who likes twisting other
people's words. As I repeatedly stated, authorities reach out to me because I offer to share clues and
evidence of fraudulent companies, such as the ones like the CHNG fraud Arthur_Big was helping out. When
that statement gets into Arthur_Big's hand, it becomes me being investigated. If you like to put words in other
people's mouth, be my guest. Does it look like anyone actually cares about the manipulative junk you've been
writing?


Honestly, the world has seen your truly disgusting behavior. You hide behind an alias and warns a fraudulent
company like CHNG run by a bunch of criminals about someone exposing the fraud. You have demonstrate
the most disgusting type of criminal intention, yet you repeatedly avoid addressing people's questions about
your motivation behind such crime. You're likely to escape the punishment of law by hiding your true identity
(well, may be not), but I hope the average investors that have been tricked and scammed into these type of
ponzi schemes (as shown in the bloomberg article below) show up at your front game one day. You're even
worse than those shady penny stock fraud promoters that pumps these RTO frauds.

Chris - Did you really threaten me physically in a private message? Thats interesting. If i end up missing I guess they
will know who to look for - the alias Chris Wu.


How are your conversations with the authorities going? Hope they aren't digging too deep into your actions for your
sake.


Whats your address? Since you say you live in HK in your linked in bio and you claim you live in San Francisco on
here - where do you really live?

I stated if you're really so sure I'm the one breaking the law one (as I believe the exact opposite), you should
stop hiding behind your alias and let our lawyers settle this directly. This is what I stated before. Last time I
checked you're still hiding. If you enjoy putting words in other people's mouth, be my guest. People have seen
your capability of spitting out lies just like those stock scam promoters at NYGG, Red Chip, plus whatever that
stock promoter's name was behind the SCEI scam. Actually you can land a decent paying job at those places
writing up misleading, fabricated press releases to help defend the frauds.


No more comments on your disgusting, criminal intention and behavior on your CHNG? I'm sure some of the
investors scammed by it will find you one day.


Yes, I'm aware of linkedin is 5 years old. But your comments make it look like you're not.


To answer your last question, I'm only limited to say "very well". They don't like me talk too much about the
conversation, except I'm free to comment on fraud promoting alias criminals like you.


I can' help but laughing out at your lack of sense of humor and imagination. You're merely a rat copying what
other people says. Since I started demanding you hiding behind your alias, now you started asking my
address? How about you reveal yours so I can forward it to the authorities as well as the hundreds of victims
of the CHNG fraud which you have helped keep alive.


Piece of advice for you - figure out some real ways to protect average investors being tricked into frauds such
as CHNG instead of sending such a friendly warning to the criminal management about someone's intention
to expose the fraud. Of course, you don't give a damn because you really weren't compensated for doing all
this.

I scammed investors of CHNG? No i actually just pointed out that Geoinvesting was about to attempt to hit the stock -
in their own words.


Yeah, i believe you are talking to the authorities for your benefit about as much as I believe the tooth fairy exists.
Good luck with those conversations Chrissy.


Why don't you provide your real name so you can gain some credibility. Your name may be chris, but its not Chris Wu
as we have proof.

Still dodging my questions? Funny you only started copying how I questioned your real identity after your own
has been called into question.


I'm sure the right person at the appropriate authorities are going to come after you for that one fraud you've
committed and your involvement in the CHNG fraud, provided you even dare to stop hiding behind your alias?


You can't deny to the world that a sophisticated manipulator like you are scared the hell out by a high school
liked and won't even come out from hiding haha.


Now how about stop hiding and let's talk about your motivation behind the disgusting, criminal offenses you
did here by helping the CHNG fraudsters? Like I said, you did not scam investors at CHNG, at least not
according to your own statement made behind an alias. But your so-called "warning" to those fraudsters
about a honest research firm that actually spent time to uncover the fraud was worse than those shady little
penny stock promoting criminal friends of yours. Want me to name one or two?

you 2 need to get a ROOM at the Bangkock Motel 6 already!

Chris Wu, Contributor
Only if Arthur_Big proves to be old enough to get a room or travel on his own.


Seriously, the guy doesn't even have the guts to stop hiding behind a rumor spreading alias. What else do
you expect from him?


BTW, I find Arthur_Big, for what he states about himself in his bio, will make a good couple with that guy with
"30+ years of diversified experience, CFA + MBA + University Professor".

Ha. Ok. When you provide your real verifiable name I will tell you mine. I admit I post under an alias you just write
gibberish garbage all day and supposedly work at a hedge fund in HK on one site, but then work in San Diego on
another. I think you might have to lay off the drugs my friend as they seem to be messing with you a bit.


12 Sep 2011, 08:39 PM


Chris Wu, Contributor
You really enjoy making things up, do you? Where did I, for once, state I work in HK or San Diego? You've
proven on multiple occasions to be a pathetic liar.


Why do you keep dodging my questions and avoid talking about your criminal activity of helping out the
perpetrating frauds like CHNG? Okay okay, I get it. You don't get any compensation for this and you don't
trade stocks.


Seriously kid, when do you stop copying what I asked you to do - When you provide your real verifiable name
I will tell you mine. I did and I've been waiting for fraudsters like you to sue me forever. I have no idea whether
you will ever stop hiding but I'm pretty sure your manipulative, disgusting activities won't stop, because stock
promotors like you always come back with different alias. But, hey here's the deal. You always smell the
same.


13 Sep 2011, 07:35 AM


Arthur_Big
Why would anyone sue you? Your gibberish is ignored by 99% of any community as it just doesn't make any sense.


By pointing out that someone is putting out what they called a "Hit Piece" I am perpetuated the fraud? What is the
definition of a hit piece? I took that as something that is supposed to "hit" a stock, hence a piece of information
released to move the market knowingly - essentially a market moving piece of manipulation.


Ok, I guess you want to continue to hide and are fine having no credibility - your prerogative. FYI - in your linkedin you
say you work in HK. To me privately you said San Diego.
