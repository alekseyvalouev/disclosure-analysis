As Raystream's Customers Mount, So Does Skepticism

Here we are again with another set of customer contracts for Raystream (OTC:RAYS) and
their so called “proprietary real time HD video streaming application.” This past December
they signed the Christian Broadcasting Network (“CBN”) for a “trial run” of their software.
We look forward to hearing what CBNs software experts have to say about their
“proprietary software” or that of Raystream’s dubious beginnings and questionable
characters involved within their operation.


If a trial run wasn’t good enough for the fans of Raystream, the company recently
announced a new “contract” that was signed last week with Grencomm Limited, a media
content company that registered in 2006 but did not become fully operating until 2011. It is
based out of the Caribbean Island Nation of Grenada (population 100,000). We decided
that it was necessary to take a closer look at this Island Nation company and familiarize
ourselves with the “where”, “what”, “when” and “how” of Grencomm.


Many people may not be familiar with Grenada, however, if you’re a Clint Eastwood fan,
you may recall a character he had played called “Gunnery Sergeant Tom Highway”. It was
one of the better movies he starred in during the eighties, called “Heart Break Ridge”. The
feature war highlight in the film was loosely based on a U.S. mission to invade Grenada in
1983. Their mission was to save kidnapped American students. However, if Gunnery
Sergeant Highway were investigating Raystream he would send a small recon platoon to
“take them out” because this is what he would find based on our ongoing investigation.


Our preliminary due diligence has revealed that Grencomm's website was established with
godaddy.com on April 29th, 2011. Raystream has claimed that Grencomm.com is
“Grenada's first online television station -- that has an audience spanning across more
than 35 countries”. We were surprised as much as the next investor to learn that all those
nations so quickly had an interest in an English speaking local news channel
broadcasting out of Grenada. In any event, they began broadcast operations on October
1st, 2011. The live streaming channel functions through “LiveStream.com”. They appear to
produce their own local news and program content.


Grencomm is also a reseller of VoIP which they aptly named “RUSH VOIP” which has
three very overpriced service plans. Their top of the line premium service is $69.95 per
month for just 800 minutes, but includes international calling. Grencomm also operates a

brick and mortar Electronics Store out of Bruce Street Mall in St. George's, Grenada ,
selling way overpriced LCD TVs, laptops and mobile phones, among other products,
which appear to have a 300% to 500% retail mark-ups (yes, the prices are in U.S. dollars).
However, while Grencomm can at least boast a price on its products, Raystream doesn’t
seem to offer any clarity on the value of their contracts with customers who will utilize its
“product” based on free and open source software.


The major problems with Grencomm are not their overpriced products and services, or
that this so-called progressive media company website dates back to April of 2011, or that
it has a half-dozen or so dead links on its web-site. The fact of the matter is that we
could not find any income generating ads on their website. Media web-sites rich in content
normally have simple video advertising or links that go to third party on-line vendors. We
question how Grencomm can even afford to pay a significant price for Raystream’s service
when it appears that the company’s business model doesn’t seem to have been currently
setup to generate a significant revenue stream…unless of course you need an overpriced
LCD TV and calling plan.


Furthermore, we performed some additional due diligence leading us to believe that
Grencomm’s relationship with RAYS is paper thin. To verify our suspicions of little
revenue, we called Grencomm and spoke to the only available person, but she was able
to answer some simple questions.


She acknowledged that:


Grencomm is not generating significant revenue
They can’t afford to pay RAYS much money
Due to economic slowdown, Grencomm is experiencing cash flow challenges


We are also not won over by the over-exaggerated statement from Grencomm’s Chief
Financial Officer, Garvy Lousion, who ecstatically said, “Discovering Raystream was a
godsend to us.” Why is the CFO making this statement instead of the Chief Technology
Officer? Maybe the technology officer’s absence explains all of the dead links on
Grencomm’s website. We suggest that investors perform their own due diligence on
Grencomm. Based on the recent price performance of RAYS, maybe they already have.


We also suggest that investors take a sneak peak at the press release that RAYS
promptly issued after last Monday's market close announcing an Evaluation Agreement
with its newest customer, Cinefly. We could not have written a better story line. We
presume this was in response to RAYS shares flirting with breaking down below $1.00.
Once again, RAYS is “partnering” with what looks to be some small time outfit to build its

dying credibility. All one has to do is read the following excerpt from Cinefly’s website to
realize that even if RAYS passes this whimsical evaluation period, Cinefly will not likely be
sending mountains of cash RAYS way.


Official Launch Coming:


The Cinefly site has undergone a complete overhaul and is about to launch. Thank
you to all of the early content contributors; based on your feedback we've scaled
back the original scope of the site have merged free videos, streaming rentals,
download-to-own movies, DVD and Blu-ray titles into a single home page gallery.
The revenue-sharing business model is still at the heart of it - contributing
filmmakers and producers will have a platform to distribute and sell their content
from and will share in advertsing and sponsorship revenues. If you're looking for fly
fishing entertainment, it will be here: instructional videos, travel and destination
films, classic TV series, documentaries, conservation and industry news. We're
putting on the finishing touches and uploading content now. Thanks for your
patience. – Rick


This release probably does more harm than good for RAYS image. Need we say more?


Thus far, Raystream’s management team has been unwilling to disclose meaningful
details regarding the contracts signed by any party due to disclosure rules. Can anyone
tell us what Raystream’s pricing structure is? No one knows, other than any entities that
have signed a “contract” with RAYS, at least two of them being on a trial basis. There is
little transparency, which leaves us to continue to question if Raystream will ever generate
a meaningful revenue stream on any of its contracts. We only need to look no further than
RAYS most recent corporate filings, and the answer is a simple NO. Raystream’s issues
will always be born out of the fact that they are selling a free and open source software
package.” As we stated in our original report, a pump and dump’s life usually ends as the
stock break below $1.00, right where RAYS currently stands.


So how should Raystream shareholders assess the situation? Well as Gunnery Sargent
Highway would say while addressing Colonel Meyer’s, “It’s a cluster @%$&, Sir."


Disclosure: I am short OTC:RAYS.

Nice, perhaps create your own video website and try to hire RAYS and then you'll see their pricing structure...my
guess is they wouldn't even take you on as a "client" since they're selling vaporware...I am short too

Is the SEC investigating RAYS? If so, are investors also liable for false claims and such?

Author’s reply »  They would actually be a great idea.. I am curious if they are giving these "clients" stock to
play this game. Grencomm could use the money!!!!!

Sadly, no. Witness the constant rumors spread by shorts, like so many hyenas.

Is the SEC funded to cover all of the cheating going on in the financial sector? Maybe if you increase its funding 1000
times.


I am amazed that you cite a clint Eastwood movie as a source of info on Grenada and fail to mention the fact that the
USA invaded the place duering the Bush administration. George W and Laura Bush were about to hit the headlines in
a smelly Savings and Loan deal, much like the one Clinton was involved in, so Papa Bush sent in the troops for a
"war on drugs" exercise to divert public attention.


Anyway, good job pointing out the danger in that possible investment.

I think you maybe referring to the Panamanian War, that was in George H.W. Bush's administration in
December of 1989.


The date of the Grenada invasion is correct in 1983.

Remind me again how a small investor can short OB's. 
My broker .. Questrade .. won't do it. Could you pass on a list of brokers that will?

Author’s reply »  Interactive Brokers seems to be the best, but they did not have much RAYS by the time we
got around to shorting it.


We shorted our shares through our prime broker who surprisingly had some borrow.


Also, it looks like IB may be partnering with prime brokerages to offer them some of their short book.

Great post!


A customer in the Caribbean tax and legal haven of Grenada? 
Maybe are the RAYS guys already preparing their escape from the U.S. Authorities?


The small and beautiful island of Grenada is one of the World’s Most Significant Tax Havens! (http://bit.ly/xudLqO). 
The SEC should stop them, before they transfer all the money earned with this Pump-and-Dump offshore.

Raystream has claimed in a recent press release that they bought a commercial license for the video codec x264
from CoreCodec LLC ("Raystream’s compression algorithm is built on the x264 encoder licensed by CoreCodec" -- a
license is required for a "derivative work").


Well.. I wrote to Jason Garrett-Glaser, the x264 Lead Developer and he told me, THIS IS NOT TRUE and CoreCodec
DOES NOT INTEND license anything to Raystream.

If anyone actually finds proof on the company creating better video quality and lower buffer time please let me know. I
invested %2 of portfolio and im ging to ride rays out. If they actually have right on the technology and can better one
of the larger video hosting companies, the company can explode. That is kinda sketchy that they are going after such
small clients and not even posting earnings.
