CYRX


Cryoport is the amalgamation of three separate slow growth businesses wrapped in
the auspices of the COVID-19 vaccine effort.


The company is a now net debt and has little to no organic growth.


I am hard pressed to find intrinsic value over $6.


Even when adding in one time COVID benefits the stock shouldn’t be worth more
then $10/share, the sharecount used by the sellside is also incomplete and
undercounts shares by 12%.


Pfizer and the CDC have clarified that high capacity refrigeration is NOT necessary
for COVID vaccine distribution.

I have written on Cryoport (NASDAQ:CYRX) before, highlighting the total lack of a moat
in the base business. Since that report the company has made two acquisitions, in
competitive deals, that show the multiple is massively out of whack with what other
buyers are willing to pay. In addition the sell side has run the stock up on the theory that
CYRX will be a beneficiary of the COVID 19 vaccine distribution effort. This narrative is
without merit, Pfizer (PFE) and the CDC have completely discredited the Sellside
analysts interpretation here.


Below I will highlight that CYRX has morphed from an oddball ultra cold storage
shipping service into a leveraged appliance manufacturer. The upside risk of vaccine
distribution is extremely low, and that the likely outcome is that shareholders wake up
next year with the realization that they own an appliance company trading at ~92x
EBITDA. The downside scenario is significant.


Let's Not Bury the Lede


CYRX has been repeatedly implicated buy the sell side as a beneficiary of the
distribution of vaccines for COVID-19. This is likely because of the reality that the PFE
effort needs to be shipped and maintained at -70C. The Moderna (MRNA) vaccine
candidate has displayed stability data at -20C and is thus no longer part of the CYRX
story, and the other major candidates are stable at even more reasonable temperatures.


Unfortunately for CYRX, PFE recently gave a full webcast about their clinical candidate
and included the photo of a cardboard shipper that does not require the liquid nitrogen
that CYRX is famous for… but instead simply utilizes dry ice. Perhaps the cardboard
box contract exists as an opportunity but I suspect that PFE can handle this simple task
on their own

Furthermore the CDC has informed the universe that they do NOT advise the purchase
of ultra-cold storage refrigerators. Instead they highlight that the shipping containers
shipped from PFE et.al. should just be refilled with dry ice.

According to the healthcare investment bank SVBLeerink the vaccine distribution is a
critical justification for the recent acquisitions.

Which is consistent with the questions asked by the SVBLeerink analyst on the last

And the B. Reilly FBR analyst got involved with the COVID hype as well, asking a
ridiculous question about a “gene therapy COVID vaccine”.

One might be asking “where did these analyst get this idea?


CYRX has not been shy about talking up its potential role in vaccine development, the
quotes above are from the Q2 2020 earnings call (when the company produced only
~$9m in revenue). However, if we look at the Q1 2020 earnings call we see the
company planting the seed of participation in the pandemic with the sell side analysts.

Transcript


CYRX core business is a logistics service to pharma companies that need Crygenic
shipping. That is defined by, and limited to, products that need to be shipped at –150
degrees Celsius (according to the most recent 10Q). They have branched out to other
cold shipping products as the number of products which require their liquid nitrogen
shippers is insufficient to generate real growth. However, products shipped below 0 and
above -80 have been successfully shipped by FedEx, DHL and others for years making
it hard to differentiate their service.

A Transformation?


The multiples were telling


In the most recent quarter this business did not display impressive growth (10.9%
growth off of a ~$8.5M base, so like~$900k of sales growth for the year)


Note these numbers are not in $000’s


If we dig in one layer deeper we see that the company acquired Cryogene Partners, a
Texas general partnership doing business as Cryogene Labs (“Cryogene”) in May of
2019, a business that added $1.3M in sales for the June Quarter… so base growth
could have been negative without the acquisition.


In the past few months CYRX has made two significant acquisitions.


On August 21  the company acquired CRYOPDP “a leading global provider of
innovative temperature-controlled logistics solutions to the clinical research,
pharmaceutical and cell and gene therapy markets, headquartered in Paris, France”
for ~$58M in cash. CryoPDP is not expected to grow in 2020 so it appears that
CYRX has bought a second no-growth company in this transaction. However, at 1.2x
sales the purchase price reflects the lack of growth.


1. st


On August 24  the company acquired the “MVE cryobiological storage business”
from Chart industries, INC for $320M in cash. To fund the acquisition CYRX spent
$45m in cash, issued $25M in equity and a $250M convertible preferred bond (~4%)
to Blackstone. CYRX is now a net debt company.


2. th


First, both of these deals were likely competitive. CryoPDP was owned by a European
private equity firm and Chart Industries (as a public company) is unlikely to have sold a
portion of its business without conducting a process with bankers. So we can assume
that CYRX was the top bidder which places a market value on these businesses near
(or below) purchase price.

Valuation


According to Jefferies the CryoPDP business is not growing (the CYRX base business
also doesn't grow without acquisitions) and that in a acquisition from a private equity firm
(which I assume was competitive) that slow to no growth business was worth 1.2x sales.
This valuation should map directly to the CYRX base business as well,
considering they are largely similar.


Source: Jefferies Report from August 21 , 2020st


The MVE acquisition seems to be made at roughly a 4X sales multiple and CYRX does
not claim it is growing, analysts project roughly a 4% Trailing Twelve Month (TTM)
growth rate.


The Long and SHORT


CYRX has a base business that does not grow organically, they have bought a
European business that also is not expected to grow, they have bought a cryogenic
shipper manufacturing business that has not grown historically.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378129-cryoport-levered-refrigerator-manufacturer-trading-tech-multiple-10-price-target?source=all_articles_title 8/11


Lets start with a proper share count. The company excludes some options and warrants
from its reported share count. As of June 30  CYRX reported 38,281,087 shares and
excluded 4,536,585 stock options as well as 190,977 warrants. I’m going to count the
convert as debt so we won’t add those shares into the dilution for now, the fully diluted
share count I will use is 43,008,649 shares outstanding.


th


The balance sheet (as of June 30 ) had 208.2M in cash and short term investments
($4.84/share) against $111M in convertible debt (-2.58) for a net cash position of about
$2.26/share.


th


CryoPDP took ~$58M of cash off the balance sheet (-1.38/share)


The MVE acquisition took an additional $45M of cash off the balance sheet
(-1.05/share)


The MVE acquisition was funded by a $25M equity tranche and a $250M debt
tranche for a net debt addition of $225m (-5.23/share)


The company has taken its net cash position of $2.26/ share and subtracted
(-$7.63/share), they have successfully transformed the balance into a net debt position
of (-$5.37/share)… so we start over $5 in the hole


The base business is not growing nor is the new European business that mimics the
company’s business here in the states so I think it is fair to put the market multiple that
CYRX placed on the CryoPDP business on their own base (1.2x Rev multiple). Which
suggests that the combination of the CryoPDP business (~$58M) plus the ~$40M the
CYRX was on track to do in 2020 is worth ($40+$58 = $98, $98*1.2x = $117.6) about
$2.73/share of value


Valuation update (-$5.37/share from the balance sheet) + $2.73/share in value =
(-$2.36/share) in value

Conclusion


MVE is also not growing, according to Jefferies it was purchased for about 4x sales
(~$80M in rev) and will double the sales of CYRX. But also comes with a lower margin
profile (~35% EBITDA margin). So the MVE acquisition will generate roughly $28M in
EBITDA next year. given that it is not growing and has no role in vaccine distribution
(and if it did that money would likely accrue to Chart Industries) I think a 12x EBITDA
multiple is fairly healthy and that comes very close to the purchase price ($336M
estimated vs $320M paid). $336M divided by our 43,008,649 shares outstanding comes
to $7.81 per share in value for MVE.


Valuation update (-$2.36/share) + $7.81/share = $5.81/share in value1.


Source: Jefferies note from August 26 , 2020th


At $49/share (as of 10/5/20) holders are pricing in a massive upside in the current
business. With our revised share count the company currently sits at a $2.1 Billion
market cap with over $230M in net debt for a total enterprise value of ~2.3 Billion or 92x
EBITDA projection for next year. In fact even IF you thought the company was going to
receive a one time boost from vaccine distribution (let call it $100m in pure profit) that
would only add ~$2.35/share to the $5.81/share price calculated above ($8.16/share
total EV). I have a $10 price target on the stock to give wiggle room for the off chance
that the company participates in vaccine distribution and to give some space for
unforeseen synergies.
