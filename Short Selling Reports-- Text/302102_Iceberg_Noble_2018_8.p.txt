A BAD RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT
NOBLE’S CREDITORS SHOULD REJECT


January 27, 2018  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 30 Comments  


Debtwire announced that Noble Group may be nearing a deal to restructure


its $3.5b debt with a debt-to-equity swap. Noble subsequently clarified that


no agreement has been reached yet. If and when a deal is reached, creditors


will have to approve it. This will not be straightforward as their interests


strongly diverge. For example, the 2018 bondholders who expected to be


repaid in two months are unlikely to like this deal.


Based on available information, it is clear that the framework has been


poorly negotiated by the advisors who claim to represent creditors. The


conditions are unfavourable to creditors and sometimes very naive. It seems


the advisors had no knowledge or understanding of the accounting


background of this company and its managers.


1.  Management given additional incentives to manipulate earnings


Under the restructuring, Noble would set up a new company, in which


employees would own stakes with the option to increase their share if


performance targets are met. Have we learned nothing from the Noble


scandal? Managers who created billions of fake profit won’t find it hard to


reach their targets. They need a profit of $300m this year? Here is what


Noble’s managers will do. Find three obscure and cash-strapped mining


companies in Africa that almost nobody has heard of. They don’t produce


anything. The mine is not built and will never be built. There is no financing.


The location is so far away from the nearest port that their production is


uneconomic and nobody will buy from them. It does not matter. Sign a 20-


year contract with each of these companies. Book at least $100m of fair


value on each contract the same day based on a series of imaginary


assumptions. The contracts will never be executed. They are only


“accounting contracts”. Done. You have just generated $300m of profit in

your books. Needless to say, the performance objectives for the year are


exceeded.


Although Noble is now in financial distress, the company continues to sign


highly suspicious end-of-the-quarter deals with tiny mining companies.


Here is another marketing agreement signed on December 22nd. Noble is


agonising and continues to sign contracts with mining companies at


exploration stage. Isn’t this the way Noble has always created fictitious


profit? Are we supposed to believe there is no accounting game behind these


contracts?


If the performance targets include more tangible financial indicators such


as operating cash flow, then the company will probably use repos as it did in


the past to manipulate these numbers.


Any suggestion that these manipulations will stop is extremely naive.


Noble’s management has nothing to fear from EY, or the “regulators” in


Singapore that are busy looking the other way. This is now well


documented. Only lawsuits will stop Noble’s management and we will cover


this critical issue in our next update.


 


2.  The people who are the cause of this scandal will remain shareholders


Creditors are asked to swallow a massive loss in this debt-to-equity


conversion. They are in this situation because a few managers around


Richard Elman deceived them, manufactured the whole balance and filled


their pockets in the process. We fail to understand why creditors who rank


higher than equity holders need to share the residual value of this company


with the few people who caused their loss.


In this poorly negotiated deal, the advisors did not understand the position


of strength of the creditors. Noble’s management is forced to accept any


condition imposed on them to avoid liquidation, even if the deal means


Richard Elman or Will Randall’s equity is completely wiped out. The reason


is that they fear liquidation far more than creditors do. Liquidation would


mean that for the first time specialists from outside the company would


have access to internal documents, emails, correspondence with the


auditor, etc. Noble’s secrets will inevitably rise to the surface and make


litigation for fraud even easier. This nightmare scenario allowed the


advisors to dictate all the conditions they wanted and they failed to take


advantage of it.


  


3.  The entry of a strategic investor after the debt restructuring

I would just like to add a few points: 


1) Management was the culprit responsible for this mess and is


somehow rewarded at the end of the day. Interestingly there was


no requirement for any director to be held accountable for the


mess and step down. How is this fair? 


2) As reported on the news, Noble has offered retention bonuses


At this stage, there are few details on the potential investor, the conditions


and whether due diligence has already been conducted (unlikely), etc. What


we know is that it is not the first time that Noble is trying to reassure the


market with the entry of a “strategic investor”. This happened many times,


and generally in a critical period when Noble needed to boost confidence.


For example, the name of Sinochem was mentioned one year ago as a


strategic investor when Noble was already in financial trouble. The short


window of optimism brought by the Sinochem story allowed Noble to raise


$750m and buy a few months time. The Sinochem deal never materialised


and these bondholders can only regret the decision they made.


Two major Chinese investors have already been badly burnt with Noble (CIC


and COFCO) and they would probably not repeat the same mistake again.


We can assume that a new investor will conduct due diligence. In the past,


many candidates ran away after they saw the books. There is no doubt the


carrying value of the assets and liabilities is still completely false despite


billions of impairment.


  


It is clear that the conditions of this outline agreement have been poorly


negotiated on behalf of the creditors. The same structural issues that have


plagued this company will remain in the future. Based on preliminary


information available at the moment, we urge creditors to reject this


proposal and demand much tougher conditions to safeguard their interests.


Again, Noble’s management has no choice and will be forced to accept.

to employees. Keeping the company afloat would only allow


management to award themselves with obscene retention


bonuses (think back on Yusuf suing Elman for $50 or $60 million


worth of shares). Its interesting to note that Noble does not


disclose remuneration of top management due to ‘competitive’


reasons (while we can clearly see Rio Tinto’s CEO’s pat package):


Creditors should find out what are the terms of these


remuneration packages, and how much obscene bonuses have


management paid themselves historically. Creditors have to


embed a clawback on bonus clause, at the very least. 


3) I find it hard to believe that banks would grant credit facilities


to Noble after this saga, particularly with the same management


and employees who caused the mess in the first place. Without


access to working capital facilities, how would a trading house


survive? Even with the substantial debt reduction, the reputation


of Noble is already in tatters. 


4) While Ivan at Glencore pumped in his own money during the


commodity downturn, we didnt see management at Noble


committing their own capital. This shows the extent of


confidence they have in the company. Even Richard Elman


subscribed to share options only to sell most of them quickly


afterwards. Why should creditors have confidence in the


company?


The restructuring proposal is bullshit and should be flung back at


whoever proposed it. Most importantly, creditors have to press for


changes at management and employee level.

I agree. Bondholders should get all cash …about 800m plus


another 700m new bond collateralized by all assets for sale. There


could be a remaining new bond of 600m. 800+700+600=2100m =


60% of bonds plis rcf outstanding. The remaining $1400m to be


swapped in equity. This would be about 7bn shares at actual


prices…80% of the enlarged capital. This would be an appropriate

deal. Anyway 2018 bomdholders should not restructure. Noble


has more than enough cash to pay the 2018 bond.


Structurer · January 29, 2018 - 6:44 am · Reply→


There are many but two central questions with this


Restructuring.


1. But what Cash ? 


▪$749.04M for $421M negative operating cash-flows from


the day to day operations. 


▪The market is not resolutely confident that Noble has the


$400,000,000 cash to repay the 3.625% coming at


maturity in March 2018. Sorry but this cash is tied to


broker margins (in other words already collaterized) 


▪Recently “hard cash” that we thought Noble Group Ltd.


had on the balance-sheet attributed to BUs was


discounted in transactions (Noble Americas Corp, Noble


South Bend) by up to 50%. 


▪We just know for an absolute fact that the debt is


$3,500,000,000


2. 


▪At 5 to Midnight say promising words like new ‘Investor’


… it is not too early to make appear the white rabbit out of


the empty top hat. Again this raises distrust that the


debtor can’t pay the $400,000,000 principal and coupon


expiring in March 2018

DEAR ICEBERG, the worst screwing is against the PERPETUAL


HOLDERS. Please write something to encourage them to VETO


THE RESTRUCTURING. These terms are so incredible, I wonder


how they can come up with this. They want to get 20% of the


shares FOR FREE and WIPEOUT NEAR TOTALLY other loyal


investors. The way how they treat perpetuals should be worth a


story for you, as it shows how incredible extreme they are. Maybe


you can even help bondholders to form groups to ensure there are


more than the necessary 25% of bondholders to veto the proposal.


Especially the perpetuals, where no restructuring at all is


necessary, there is no maturity and also no payout obligation at


all unless the company is paying dividends again. Noble can

As much as you should be applauded for raising this scam in the


first place, it has reached a point where it’s not a simple ‘reject’.


Many competing interests, and they are not all screwed by the


same magnitude, some more than others. Even within the bond


holders 2018 thinks they are more senior than 2020/2022. Not to


mention the perps…if everybody simply rejects, the company


would presumably, eventually go into liquidation. would


creditors be better off then, compared to current proposal?

No we precisely disagree with the idea coming from Noble

zero, so you better agree to the crappy


restructuring we offer. Noble’s goes one step ahead


in the sense that existing bondholders also are


incentivised to put in new cash. This is a new low


in restructuring deals. It is quite clear now – the


choice is between taking zero now OR put in some


new cash and lose that along with everything else


two years down the road. Better to call the bluff


now and move on! One is better off trying legal


options against the company and management


rather than going through the pain of the


restructuring.

Nobles misdeeds have been happening for a long time. Ricardo

had good traders like Dimitri and Andrea etc that always made


money. But hiring people like Olaf and his hires didn’t help. I say


full inquisition from 2006. All the incompetents will be exposed

Even after all this, we have a bunch of sell side credit analysts


coming out with reports estimating recovery value at over 50c


and recommending participation in the new trade facility as well


as support the restructuring. One analyst even had a buy on the


perp at 10c!! It is such dumbness that lets managements like


Noble get away with such games. Not one report questions the


20% equity granted to management. Thanks to Iceberg, Noble


stands exposed as a company with no cash, no earnings and no


business. Those who agree to the restructuring are just staying


exposed to a shell company for longer and letting management


make several millions more before the game is called off.

By firing them and appointing an interim CEO yes. But


before the shocking 20% shares for management scheme


is approved.

agree. creditors should not give mgmt a single


share. they should look for a new professional


mgmt and give ot stock options not shares…so only


with rising share prices after they created value

theu receive some reward. even top silicon valley


fors operate like this…no firm in the world gives


mgmt 20% for free. mindboggling.


Rudolf Bondholder 2020 · February 3, 2018 - 11:29 pm ·


Why not after ? 70% isnt enough to rule ? Thanks


for yr previous answer Iceberg.


Iceberg Research · February 3, 2018 - 11:37 pm ·


Not after because the ad hoc group will have


plundered Noble with their fees and failed


management will own 20% of what should be


yours. Its time to wake up NOW for creditors and


stop being so passive. This has not worked so far.


Rudolf Bonfholder 2020 · February 4, 2018 - 12:50 am ·


Of course, but if this plan finally gets approved


(most probable scenario imho), there will still be


power to fire management team after if


required/wanted. Former creditors will be in


control and will not allow a dumb team to run its


business. Dont u think so ? ( Thanks again).


Iceberg Research · February 3, 2018 - 11:54 pm ·


We dont think the proposed plan will be approved.


Understand your valid points but If creditors are


passive now why would they be more active after?


Our next update will present what we think in


details.

There’s probably no more true assets in noble as management .


Getting 25cent on the dollar would be difficult fie bondholders.


Management should be sacked and replaced, i have seen


companies with management that’s intent on enriching


themselves by plundering the company’s coffers.

Very insightful, thank you!

Okay so the bomb is in, 5 billion $ of losses for 2017…… Looks like


there were accounting shenanigans going on in valuing the


assets/contracts. Creditors should sue for bankruptcy or full


control of the company., there are no other options
