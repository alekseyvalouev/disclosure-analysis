The Fraud at Textura (NASDAQ:TXTR) 
 Target Price -- 12 Months = $4 





In December of 2013, Citron Research introduced readers to Textura Corp. (NASDAQ:TXTR), 
documenting the CEO’s history of fraud and failed businesses, and a shadowy weave of poorly 
disclosed insider relationships.  In its last three quarters, Textura has missed analyst 
expectations and continues as a wannabe in the SaaS space.  Ignoring scant earnings results, 
the analysts have stood by their unfounded optimistic forecasts.   
    


If you are a Textura shareholder and you are a custodian of someone else’s money, you are 
obligated to read this report. We have done the homework that NONE of the analysts have 
done, and in this report we spill the truth about this “investment”.  What you are about to read 
is not the opinion of Citron, it is FACT. We have hired consultants with genuine expertise and 
years of experience in construction management to prove that management of Textura is 
committing FRAUD on the investing public.  Yes, we said fraud, and we would love to prove it in 
a Court of Law. 
    


We already know that Textura has: 
    


 10 year history of operating losses 


 Forward P/E:  111 
 Price/Sales over 12.5 





It’s taken over 10 years – and nearly $200 million in retained earnings losses -- for this 
company to finally get its annual revenue run rate above the $50 million mark.  Nevertheless, 
the stock has now rebounded, buoyed by the unflinchingly optimistic analysts who know 
nothing about construction management but instead rely on the representation of 
unscrupulous management.    
    


Our message to analysts:  Don’t publish your predictable denials of this report’s conclusions 
unless you can specifically refute the facts.  
Citron presents this story in 3 parts: 


1. The utterly fraudulent representation of management about gross margins of their 


flagship product 


2. The fraudulent claims from management when discussing Textura’s “Total Addressable 


Market” 


3. The recent lawsuit that Textura hopes its shareholders and customers never read.

   Fraudulent Claim #1:  16 to 18 bps Earned on Gross 
Construction Contracts?  Not Even Close! 
Textura’s main product, CPM, which processes lien waivers and releases payments, accounts 


for appx 60% - 65% of its total revenues. In its presentations to investors and quarterly 


conference calls, the company consistently claims that it charges general contractors 4 basis 


points while collecting an additional 12 basis points from the subcontractors for using its 


system. This is a complete lie.  This graphic is from their recent investor presentation:   





http://investors.texturacorp.com/files/doc_presentations/Textura%20Needham%20Conference_Jan2014.pdf 


All the analysts coverage initiations repeat this lie.  For instance:  


JMP Securities:  “We estimate the company’s current solutions can generate roughly 30 basis points. 
The company’s primary CPM solution represents approximately 10 to 12 basis points of this amount.” 


Oppenheimer:  “We estimate the current TAM at ~$1.2B, which is the total North American commercial 
construction value of $800B multiplied by Textura’s estimated take-rate of ~15bps.” 


Barrington:  “Subs pay a fee of 15 basis points (BPs) for every contract awarded—there is a minimum 
($50) and maximum ($1,450). The CPM effective rate (GC plus sub fees) is about 10 BPs of construction 
value. 



http://investors.texturacorp.com/files/doc_presentations/Textura%20Needham%20Conference_Jan2014.pdf
Textura:  Deception September 29, 2014 Page 3 of 16 
 


Here is Barrington’s fiction regarding the revenue Textura will generate from CPM. 10 – 12 BPS 


and 12 – 15 with the new pricing model?  Who are they kidding?  





 
 
 
Here is the Truth About Textura CPM Revenue Rates: 
 


 The company has never booked even half this level of BPs. 


 It has cut special deals with highly touted licensees whose subcontractors don’t pay any 


subcontractor fees at all (e.g. Denver Airport – see below) 


 Even their announced revenue increases cannot materially close this gap. 





Sheer Fiction!    
Unsubstantiated by the Numbers.

This table compares client reported construction billed within the system for the last 8 


quarters, comparing to CPM contribution to total revenues. The results are consistent:  hi 5’s to 


mid 6’s, and not growing. That’s a long, long way from 16 bps.

What software analysts don’t understand is that in a typical project the general contractor 


performs some of the work itself and/or charges an override for supervision.  Depending on 


the project, it might also mark up the subs billings. There is a treasure trove of detailed billing 


data about U.S. based real-world construction projects within the America’s Recovery and 


Reinvestment Act (ARRA) website.  In fact, when our professionals surveyed the projects here, 


focusing on the categories Textura can legitimately claim as addressable market, the subs only 


account for 64.5% of the project cost. So while the entire project may be “addressable market” 


revenue from the General Contractor perspective, 75% of Textura’s revenue is claimed to be 


coming from the subcontractors. Yet only 2/3rds of the billed project is subcontractor pass-


through.   This is the type of work the sell side analysts has NEVER done because there is zero 


understanding of the construction industry among them.  Here is a survey of 75 projects which 


illustrate the point.   [LINK HERE] 


Next, Textura caps subcontractor fees at $1,450 per project. These fee caps have a major 


undisclosed effect on the BPS Textura collects, but nobody has studied it – until now.

Referring back to the ARRA database, we survey 20 general non-residential projects, all of 


which do fall into Textura’s addressable market categories [LINK HERE] and many of which are 


built by known Textura customers. We survey the actual amounts they pay to subs, and 


calculate the fees CPM should earn on the project.   This is the work the analysts have NEVER 


done. The result?

Ah, but Textura claims it has just raised prices. New projects will purportedly have a $2,500 


minimum per subcontractor, up from $1,450. Recalculating the same 20 projects on that basis, 


assuming they can actually command this new higher minimum, we still see only 5 BPS coming 


from the subs. [ LINK HERE ]. 


Clearly there’s a huge gap between the company’s revenue claims and the truth; this goes on 


quarter after quarter and year after year, and not one analyst has ever acknowledged it.

   Fiction vs Reality at Denver Airport 
You cannot read about Textura or speak to management without someone mentioning the 


Denver Airport.  The company touted this project to anyone who would listen (here’s the PR) 


and even inserted a prominent rendering of the airport project in their recent investor 


presentation.  





http://investors.texturacorp.com/files/doc_presentations/Textura%20F2Q14%20WB%20Conference%2


02014_FINAL.PDF  (See Page 12)  


So what is the reality?   


First of all, Textura signed up Denver with a deal that exempted all subcontractors from 


making any fee payments at all … none whatsoever! 


Don’t believe us?  Here’s the cost sheet :

https://www.denvergov.org/Portals/743/documents/Textura-CPM%20FAQs%20pricing.pdf 


So how much do they make on this huge $544 million project?   
    


 “Prime Contractors will pay a fee based on a percentage of their bid price. Textura will  
invoice the prime contractor at project start. The fee will cover all project, subscription  
and usage fees for both the Prime Contractors and Subcontractors.” 





So the reality is, $544 million in construction contract payments nets Textura 1/20
th


 of 1% 
of the contract value, or in this case $272,000 in gross revenue.  It is highly questionable 
that this small amount of revenue even covers the costs of implementation.  It certainly doesn’t 
cover of even one corporate executive salary pocketed by a Textura honcho.  
 
But wait, there’s more.  Or in this case, less.

Textura:  Deception September 29, 2014 Page 8 of 16 
 


Let’s accept for agrument’s sake the strategy that the City of Denver was a loss leader.  It 
brought onto Textura’s subscriber database over 3,000 subcontractors, although we see from 
the Denver link these “new” subcontractors represented zero revenue for Textura.   
   


Denver became a customer because it was attempting to better manage the subcontractor 
relationships on this large Airport Construction project: 
  








https://www.denvergov.org/Portals/743/documents/Textura-
CPM%20FAQs%20for%20Denver%20(4).pdf 





You get what you pay for!  Not only did Textura fail to generate material revenues from the City 
of Denver, worse they failed to protect the airport project from those very problems they say 
the software was designed for: 


http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25734440/big-minority-contract-at-denver-airport-isnt-


everything?source=pkg 


And in case you don’t think this was Textura’s fault just read the key line: 





So despite all the glowing PR’s and the claim of thousands of new subcontractors entering the 
CPM system, the results are: 


 Nearly all those new subcontractors are non-fee paying 


 The fees charged for the system are deeply discounted below any level Textura has 
ever disclosed to investors 


 The system utterly failed to accomplish the principal reason it was installed; e.g. 
management of the subcontractor relationships to fulfill Denver’s minority-and-women-
owned business quotas for the project 





Of course, the preponderance of contracting activity by the City of Denver comes from their 


major Airport project, so Textura’s revenue from Denver is essentially capped at 5 BPS.  


And of course, you’d never hear about this contracting scandal from the company … not a word 


that their system failed to manage the single issue that it was implemented to solve.  





“The mayor's office did not comment about the Burgess contract, but it noted that 
it recently "launched new tools that will help level the playing field" for businesses 
owned by minorities and women. (referring to Textura CPM)” 





“The contracting community has been asking Denver to offer a payment and 
invoicing system that provides visibility and accountability for everyone.”

   Fraudulent Claim #2:  Grossly and Knowingly Exaggerated 
“Total Addressable Market” Claim:   


Textura’s TAM is less than 1/10
th


 What the Company Claims 


In one of the most common gambits in the stock promoter’s playbook, Textura is fond of 
touting a huge total addressable market:  (Again, from their own investor presentation here:) 
   





Exaggerated 
by over  300%

claim.  No patent  protection

thing “Unsubstantiated Revenue 
Claims”

Textura:  Deception September 29, 2014 Page 10 of 16 
 


 
The above slide is absolutely riddled with lies and exaggerations.  
   


Even unflaggingly optimistic cheerleader Barrington claims Textura’s total addressable market 
in the US for construction is only $700 billion – little more than half Textura’s $1.3 Trillion claim 
above.   
   


However, what none of the analysts know or won’t admit is there are several major categories 
of construction that will never be addressable markets for CPM.  Again, this is what happens 
when analysts with no understanding of construction management have no choice but to rely 
on the representations of management.   
   


Single family residential is one inapplicable category, partially acknowledged by Textura, but 
others are unacknowledged.   
   


For example, Textura’s S-1, filed 4/5/2014, states:  


 In the United States, as of December 2012, the annualized value of commercial 


construction put in place, which excludes single-family residential construction, was 


$740 billion, according to the United States Census Bureau 


But the Census Bureau further breaks down the residential category as follows: 


Residential Total 308,153 


New Single Family 144,825 


New Multi-Family 25,777 


Improvements 137,551 
 


Since the US Census Bureau already provides a total for “Non-residential” value, the 
appropriate and honest way for Textura to have stated their addressable US market would 
have been to add New multi-family of $25 billion to the overall Nonresidential TOTAL of $570 
billion and report it accurately at $596 billion. Instead they overstated by $144 billion, or more 
than 24%, by implicitly including residential improvements; this despite the obvious conclusion 
they will never get any significant revenue from projects such as kitchen, bathroom, and room 
addition remodels.  
  
 


What Every Construction Management Professional Knows … 
But Textura’s Analysts Won’t Say 
Citron’s Construction Industry experts were still highly skeptical of the remaining non-
residential components of Total Addressable Market, because there are enormous swaths of 
the Construction industry in which Subcontractors play little or no role.  Specifically, projects 
classified as “Heavy” and “Civil Engineering” Construction, which comprise a material portion of 
non-residential construction, typically depend very little on subcontractors; typically a specialty 
contractor self-performs most of all of the work with its own employees. Contractors on such 
projects will never have a reason to utilize CPM at all.  
   



http://www.census.gov/construction/c30/pdf/pr201212.pdf
Textura:  Deception September 29, 2014 Page 11 of 16 
 


To study this point, Citron points readers to the 54 projects in our ARRA database analysis which 
fall into the following groupings:  [ LINK HERE]  (See Tabs 3, 4, and 5 for Details) 
 


Category Projects Total Prime

The utilization of subcontractors in these types of construction projects is so marginal that the 
entire category can effectively be excluded from Textura’s addressable market for CPM.  
   


The Census Bureau’s construction statistics for 2012 gives us good measurements of the 
proportions of these segments within non-residential construction. Clearly, Textura can 
compete for barely more than half the dollar volume in the “Non-Residential Construction” 
sector.

No Meaningful Entry into Foreign Construction Markets 


First of all, Textura has zero basis to claim future revenues from foreign markets. Their lien 
waiver system responsible for the bulk of Textura’s revenue applies specifically to the 
management of construction payments in the US. Despite a partner trying to find a niche 
market in Australia, the reality is that difference in contract law, construction practice and 
liabilities management make CPM’s core functionality inapplicable outside the U.S.  Further, the 
European Patent Office saw right through Textura’s patent claims for a standard business 
process. 
 


The Undisclosed Truth about Textura’s Patent Portfolio in Europe 


 
While the company claims overwhelming patent protection, they have never disclosed that the 
core of their entire patent portfolio was rejected by European Patent Office, who 
characterized it as "notoriously well known business processes" implemented on a computer 
without the need of any "inventive" technical solutions.’

Textura:  Deception September 29, 2014 Page 14 of 16 
 


Any investor should find this explanation of their rejection especially chilling:  





https://register.epo.org/application?documentId=EPN2YZJZ1421FI4&number=EP05711504&lng=en&npl=false 


(Had the U.S. patent office been a little more sophisticated about software patents during the 
years 2005 to 2008, it very likely would have ruled similarly on the bulk of Textura’s patents.)  
 
This sheds a lot of light why Textura has not yet pursued a single legal defense of its patent 
portfolio, despite the emergence of numerous competitors.  The patent landscape for software 
is now much less likely to uphold broad protection for business methods than it was a decade 
ago.  Patents for software that automates well-understood business processes now offer just a 
shadow of the protection they once promised.  


     The Lawsuit That Textura Does Not Want It’s 


Customers or Investors to See…Ever! 


Last month, the N.Y. Superior Court ruled that a lawsuit against a General Contractor by a 
Subcontractor who billed through Textura’s CPM can proceed, even though it was paid using 
CPM’s lien waiver system. The subcontractor’s ability to sue for $10.7m in overcharges which 
had been signed away using Textura’s lien waiver, which didn’t allow the entry of exceptions 
allowed on the backside of the form, is the root of the dispute. While Textura isn’t a party to 
the suit so far, the general contractor may get stuck for millions in charges.   


Lawsuits between Subcontractors and General Contractors over payment is the very thing … 


the only thing … that Textura’s lien waiver software is intended to prevent!  If it 
doesn’t prevent this outcome, why would any General Contractor pay for it, or trust it enough 
to ever risk implementing it?  


“In particular, the Division is still of the opinion that the claims, although 
not completely devoid of technical character, merely specify commonplace 
features relating to a technological implementation of subject matter 
excluded from patentability under Art. 52(2) and (3) EPC, without 
involving an inventive step (Article 56 EPC)  No technical solution defined 
in response to a problem could be identified within the content of the 
application as originally filed.  Any problems which are addressed to not 
appear to require a technical, but rather an administrative or 
organizational, i.e. business, solution.  Whilst the implementation of such 
solutions may include the use of generic technical features, these merely 
serve their well known functions as would be recognized by the skilled 
person in the technical field under consideration.”

How long before a dispute like this one names Textura as a defendant?  The sums at risk here 


dwarf the fees collected for use of CPM by 500-fold or more.  





      Conclusion:  Did you Expect Anything 


Different?? 


The last time Patrick Allin was CEO of a publicly traded company, it made unsubstantiated 
revenue expectations and eventually filed bankruptcy.  (read previous Citron reports)….what 
did you really think was going to happen this time? 


Textura and its management mislead the investing public in so many ways that it can only be 
considered a complete investment FRAUD. 


Textura purports to be a mainstream solution to the construction industry, when it provides 
neither general accounting nor project management functionality.  Aside from CPM, the 
company’s products are a collection of relatively disparate and poorly integrated utilities with 
only niche appeal.   


Now that CPM itself has demonstrated its vulnerabilities to major litigation risk for adopters, 
the company will face major headwinds in bringing on new customers to CPM.  The analysts 


Plaintiff, in opposition, alleges that, [**12] despite the Subcontract's requirement of 


written approval of all change order work, plaintiff and defendant established a 


routine, due to the expedited nature of the project, whereby plaintiff would perform 


modified work while the change orders for such work were still pending. It also 


contends that defendant required it to submit monthly payment applications through its 


electronic "Textura Payment Management System" and that applying for 


payment required plaintiff to submit form SF-320, which stated that no other payments 


were due, "except as listed on the reverse side hereof." Plaintiff then explains that the 


electronic payment system did not allow for claims to be written on the reverse side of 


the form. It argues that the payment application form "became simply an 


acknowledgment by [plaintiff] of its payment receipt for the amount of the Project 


Subcontract work and for the amount of the change order that had, up to the date of 


the [application], been approved by [defendant]."

who will minimize the impact of the above Subcontractor vs. General Contractor Lawsuit 
demonstrate their utter lack of understanding of the construction industry.  Word of this suit 
will undoubtedly circulate among the decision-makers who are responsible for committing to 
and implementing CPM.  It’s a small community, and they do know each others’ business.  


The road downhill is inevitable, but Wall Street loves companies like this.  As it burns through its 
cash, (one half of the cash it had one year ago is gone) Textura will return to Wall Street for 
more … and as long as there are fees to be earned, Wall Street will be complicit in deals like 
this, that should never ever have been brought public in the first place.   


Textura: Please Sue Me! 


Just over one year ago, insiders sold over $100 million in stock while lying to the investing 
public.  Meanwhile its bankers (William Blair and Barrington) had principals who owned IPO 
stock away from their firms while ignoring all conflicts of interest.  We are sure the lawyers of 
one of your firms will want to sue Citron.  Let’s go to court so I can subpoena your emails and 
forget about short selling and collect some real whistleblower money.   


This story is over, buy or sell, either way this stock goes to $4.00.
