Carson Block Short Proofpoint: Sohn London
Presentation


We're posting up notes from the Sohn London Investment Conference 2015.Â  Next


up is Carson Block of Muddy Waters who pitched a short of Proofpoint (PFPT). 








Carson Block's Sohn London Presentation 2015 





Short Proofpoint (NAS: PFPT)Â  





Proofpoint is priced for perfection. They went public in 2012. Block said that the


more Proofpoint sells the more it loses. There is something wrong with the business


model as they have had plenty of time to turn sales into profit. 





Management mischaracterise their company as a cyber security company but it


only focuses on email. Email security is a tiny market compared to cyber. Email


security is a mature market. The number of business emails might actually be


shrinking according to one analyst. 





Management fudges the organic growth numbers. The real figure is much less than


the market thinks. 





Proofpoint is facing increasing competitive pressures. Microsoft, Google and Cisco


are putting more effort into email security and are catching up. Proofpoint are


losing some of their big accounts. Billing and revenue rates are flat lining. The


growth rate is at risk. Proofpoint will not be able to maintain its premium pricing


and there are already signs they are selling software at greater discounts. Many


companies do not see email security as vitally important and are happy to use a free


product that is good enough.
