Has AOB Analyst Confirmed CEO Role on Both
Sides of Transactions in 2007 and during 2008?


Posted on August 6, 2009 by Asensio.com


A report released by a sell-side analyst covering AOB, Ding Ding at


Susquehanna International Group (SIG), states that she confirmed


that “AOB’s CEO Mr. Tony Liu is the chairman and director of


Golden Dragon.” Ding also states, “Golden Dragon or AOB acquired


the title of Beijing Century East on 12/30/07.” This appears to


conflict with AOB’s disclosures on the matter in its 2007 and 2008


filings and shareholder communications.


A report released yesterday by asensio.com shows possible


documentary evidence that Tony Liu may have been on both sides


of $105 million in real estate transactions entered into by AOB,


though AOB stated it had “no material relationship” with the seller.


A response from AOB’s auditors was repeatedly requested for the


past month. A response was also requested from AOB’s counsel and


independent directors. None was received. It now appears that this


SIG analyst has apparently obtained some form of confirmation


privately from AOB or some informed insider source.


Some obvious questions arise from this apparent confirmation,


which were not addressed by the analyst:


-Since the AOB apparently began transactions in 2007, why did AOB


not make any disclosures to investors about the 2007 transaction


until 2009, after it was completed, and then only disclosed $70


million of the $105 million, and not disclose how much was


expensed in 2007 and during 2008, and how the expenditures were


funded?


-What safeguards were put in place to protect AOB shareholder and


debt holders?
