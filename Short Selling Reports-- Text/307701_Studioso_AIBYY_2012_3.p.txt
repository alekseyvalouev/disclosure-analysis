Allied	Irish	Banks	Significantly	Overvalued	Versus	Bank	Of	Ireland
Feb.	8,	2012	7:52	AM	ET13	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


In	two	articles	last	year,	we	reviewed	the	capital	raising	initiatives	completed	by	Allied	Irish
Banks	(AIB).


On	27	July	2011,	the	bank	issued	500	billion	(yes,	billion	is	not	a	misprint!)	shares	at	0.01
EUR	each.


In	our	article	we	gave	a	price	target	of	0.033	EUR	per	Ireland-listed	share,	and	$0.49	per
ADR.	The	ADRs	declined	to	that	level	on	9	September	2011.


In	line	with	the	strong	performance	of	the	stock	market	since	late	November,	AIB	shares
have	since	risen	to	0.10	EUR	per	Ireland-listed	share,	and	$1.40	per	ADR	on	8	February.
The	sale	of	500	billion	shares	at	0.01	EUR	represents	over	97%	of	the	bank's	shares
outstanding.


At	its	current	share	price	of	0.10	EUR	in	Ireland	and	over	$1.30	in	New	York,	the
company	has	a	market	capitalisation	of	513.4	billion	*	0.10	EUR	=	51.34	billion	EUR.
This	doesn't	make	much	sense	given	that	the	company	required	a	13.2	billion	EUR
bailout	in	July	2011.


Comparison	with	Bank	of	Ireland	(NYSE:IRE)


In	our	second	article	regarding	AIB,	we	compared	its	valuation	to	its	stronger	rival	Bank	of
Ireland,	and	concluded	that	the	latter	is	a	more	sensible	alternative	for	those	looking	to
gain	exposure	to	Irish	banks.


The	valuation	table	from	that	article	is	updated	to	reflect	the	share	prices	of	AIB	and	IRE
on	8	February.	Note	that	the	balance	sheet	figures	are	from	31	December	2010,	given	the
lack	of	more	recent	financial	reports	for	AIB.

The	above	amounts	in	million	EUR,	apart	from	share	prices	and	price	to	book	ratios.
Market	capitalization	and	price-to-book	ratios	are	calculated	based	on	the	shares
outstanding	after	capital	raising.


AIB	shares	have	declined	a	little	since	that	second	article	(from	0.11	EUR	to	0.10	EUR),
however	Bank	of	Ireland	shares	have	risen	from	0.101	EUR	to	0.145	EUR.	Despite	this,
Bank	of	Ireland	is	still	at	a	more	sensible	valuation	at	a	price	to	book	value	of	about	0.37,
versus	a	silly	price	to	book	valuation	of	2.81	for	AIB.


As	Felix	Salmon	stated	in	this	Seeking	Alpha	article,	AIB	pricing	at	current	levels	is	simply
a	market	inefficiency.	Although	that	article	was	published	on	26	October	2011,	it	applies
equally	to	AIB	at	the	time	of	writing.


We	stand	by	our	target	price	of	0.033	EUR	per	share	or	(0.033	*	10	*	1.325)	$0.44	per
ADR	from	our	previous	articles.


Disclosure:	I	am	short	AIB.

If	a	ponzi	scheme	HLF	can	be	worth	$5bill,	stocks	such	as	CRM,	OPEN,	AMZN,	etc.	can	trade	at	insane	valuations,
why	can't	AIB,	which	is	the	top	bank	in	Ireland,	can	be	worth	50Bil?

Studioso	Research,	Contributor
Author’s	reply	» 	Cawelcome,	the	main	point	of	differentiation	with	bank	stocks,	and	specifically	with	AIB,	is
that	it	has	a	substantially	similar	competitor	(Bank	of	Ireland)	which	is	trading	at	a	much	lower	valuation.
Whereas	with	the	other	stocks	you	mention,	the	relevant	competitors	have	greater	differences.
