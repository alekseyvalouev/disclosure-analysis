Sears Holdings liquidation sale
We have been short Sears Holdings, publicly, albeit in small quantity. Being summer in Australia I did
not even look at the market for the last couple of days - but got into work for some congratulatory
emails as Sears stock is off very hard on an announcement of truly awful sales, the closure of 100 to
120 stores and $1.6 to $2.4 billion of non-cash charges. (More about the charges later on.) 
 
I look pretty smart putting a Sears short on in November - and kudos is gratefully accepted but
undeserved. I was short Sears at my old firm when the Eddie Lambert controlled K-Mart took them
out for considerably more than they were worth. It was not the only time that happened to me - but
multiple stabs don't dull the pain. I would gladly swap kudos for a refund of my then clients' money.* 
 
The premise for owning Sears was property liquidation. The company owned many of its sites -
sometimes on book at low historic values reflecting the company's long and once glorious history.
Eddie Lambert and his merry-men were going to extract that value through selective store closures
and super-profitable liquidation. Sears was an awful retailer (there was little doubt about that) but it
was - they thought - a good property play. 
 
My view: owning Sears as a property play is a demonstration of the arrogance and
breathtaking naivete of much that passes on Wall Street. Sears Holdings has over 300 thousand
employees. I don't know how you successfully liquidate a business integrated with that many lives. I
don't know of anyone who has ever successfully liquidated a business with that many employees.** I
am not sure it can be done and it certainly can't be done by someone with my skill-set (highly
analytical, ability to spy value or value traps but no people management skill and not much tact). 
 
The idea that Sears was going to be managed/liquidated by a bunch of hedge fund guys (people like
me) well - that was comical. 
 
Just to stress the point for my fund manager friends who read accounts and have my skills (but like
me are often disconnected from the businesses they invest in) I will state the obvious. The employees
are living breathing people and as you pull the business apart the way you treat those people and
how they think about you (and behave towards you) are critical to any value you extract in liquidation.
Someone has to look these people in the eye and tell them they don't have a job. And someone has
to pick-and-choose which people to fire and which to retain. And they have to do this without
destroying much of the value extracted along the way. They have to liquidate the firm in such a way
that the value accrues to the liquidators and not to the people who are being screwed. 
 
I don't care what you think of the morality of that. The reality of that is that it was always going to be
hard - possibly very hard.*** 
 
We are about to find out how hard. Sears is going to close 100 to 120 stores (it is vague about the
number) and fire many employees. But they have not worked out which employees or even which
stores. Not to sound ghoulish - but my guess is that this is going to be considerably harder than the
"Sears spokesman" makes it sound. And if they can't do 120 stores without trouble then the original
Sears liquidation premise was insane. This is a case of Wall Street fantasy meeting reality: eventually
reality wins. 
 
The charges and reality 
 
The large (non-cash!) charges deserve mention. This is from the Sears release: 


[We Sears] expect that we will record in the fourth quarter a non-cash charge related to
a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets of $1.6 to $1.8 billion


You know what that means. It means that you should not expect to earn that profit in the future. It is
the admission from the Eddie Lambert controlled Sears that the fantasy is over. 
 
The reality is unchanged: when you think of the 1950s you think of Sears. Sears was (in Main Street

reality) irrelevant a decade ago. The Wall Street fantasy took a little longer to end. 
 
 
John 
 
 
 
*(A note about Schadenfreude.) The take-over of the old Sears by the Eddie Lambert controlled K-
Mart was the second worst day of my career. The worst day was when Fred Goodwin's Royal Bank of
Scotland purchased Charter One Financial. When I started the blog one of the main goals was to
spell out just how atrocious Sir Fred Goodwin (the then CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland) was. The
fourth post on this blog was the beginning of my "Sir Fred Goodwin death watch". I enjoyed watching
him and his bank come apart. But I should not have enjoyed it. Schadenfreude is not an attractive
personality characteristic and the collapse of RBS has caused real pain to a lot of innocent parties.
And a Schadenfreudegasm - well that just strikes me as unreasonably indulgent. After all my clients
lost money - and I should and would but cannot swap any pleasure I had for a refund of their losses. 
 
This time though I am just accepting the Schadenfreude. My client are making money and I have no
reason to feel guilty about that. Moreover I don't have to fire those employees. Unlike Royal Bank of
Scotland (which Sir Fred destroyed) Sears employees were doomed anyway. 
 
**. It is worth mentioning the GM example. GM was salvaged through bankruptcy with a couple of
hundred thousand employees. But those employees were particularly trapped, the shareholders were
wiped out and the Government contributed considerable money. That is what a "successful" transition
for a business with that many employees looks like. 
 
***. (Politics, employees and realism). I am a bleeding heart left-winger and naturally feel a little
paternalistic to the employees being fired. However you don't need to be a bleeding heart lefty to
agree with my analysis. A realist will tell that when you have 300 thousand employees your relation to
them is going to be critical in running your business. Employees are "stakeholders" even if your only
(moral) criteria is "shareholder value". Realism over politics is a better basis for investment.

You've hit on a topic here that has been vivid in my brain many times over the last several
years. I call it "spreadsheet math" 
 
during the bubble, people were saying the same thing about the Vegas companies: MGM
was worth $140 a share or something because of the Vegas Strip land it owned, alone. I
argued at length with an analyst, explaining "ummm - the land only has value because it's
on the Vegas Strip, where you can put a casino, but MGM also already HAS casinos on
their land! You can't RE-put another casino on the land, and you also can't sell it to
someone who will do something else with it - SOMEONE has to pay the rent." 
 
same story with Bill Ackman's TGT thesis - spreadsheet math based on "real estate"...

Target at least has a well run store sitting on that land. But yes - "spreadsheet math" is an
apt description. 
 
It takes more than a spreadsheet to fire 200 thousand people. 
 
As for Target - they appear well run and I think they had the common-sense to largely
ignore Ackman. Tesco alas sold some of its property during the boom. We own both (but
prefer Tesco).

Many years ago the township I lived in had a lawsuit with the local Sears/mall over
property taxes - whether the proper rate was the "bricks/mortar" value of the property or
the value based on things like sales traffic (which was much higher). Sales based
valuations won. Guess the taxes are way down now :)

Real estate value for an operating business is best thought of as a floor...Ackman's
proposal would have made sense if TGT were trading below the value of some other
income-producing use of the property...like a parking lot?

Spreadsheet math: math that does not have recursion or dynamics. Ie, if a business is
sucking because the biz sucks and it has a lot of biz specific assets (like strip mall
property) then spreadsheet math doesn't iterate to: hmm, maybe those biz specific but
fungible assets are impaired too?

This is not a liberal/conservative issue. I am a diehard conservative and agree with what
you said. 
 
It is an arrogance issue. Certain people have expertise in certain subjects or areas. To
think that you can take that expertise in one area and apply it to something else is pure
arrogance. Knowing how to invest and spot hidden value in a company is quite different
than knowing how to operate two retailing giants. 
 
Lambert may have been right about Sears having hidden real estate value. But he
obviously had no workable plan for extracting that value. His arrogance blinded him of
this reality.

While it's no question that the stores have not performed...Sears.com has exploded and
continues to grow at a double-digit pace. In fact, it was rated the best in terms of mobile
experience which is where everything is going. You also have to look at other assets and
brands. Sears conducted over 15 million in home service calls last year! That's a very
profit-rich source of income. Reduce the costly stores, grow the web presence and
service portion of the business and you have a real winner. A winner which gives the
consumer a more personal experience than Amazon with the option to deal with human
beings in a store.

Such a pity for Sears. It still has a good name for whitegoods - most people I speak to
who have bought new washing machines, fridges or similar go to Sears. It is such a
pleasure to shop there too compared with the aggresive "do you want an extended
warranty" alternative at BestBuy. (Anecdotal information for sure, but I feel there is some
truth in this). As for K-mart (at least the US version of it) - never shopped there and never
intend to.  
 
I would think Sears would have a better shot at survival concentrating on its whitegoods,
hardware and landsend brands, while reducing some of the other lines. Perhaps if they
took an approach like Harvey Norman in Australia with the individual departments
operating independently and required to be profitable on their own, Sears would do
better. 
 
But that is retailing rather than a property play...

brilliant as always, great post - this is an topic that not many consider amidst all the

Anon - Any hope to transform Sears into a web-driven business is a ludicrous pipe
dream. As John discussed, they own millions of SF of mall real estate and employ
hundreds of thousands of people. They couldn't be further from an asset-light approach
like Amazon, and they face enormous competition in the hybrid retail-B&M category from
HD, Lowe's, Best Buy, etc for half of their products and Target, WalMart, JC Penney for
the other half. Anyone can drive online sales with promotions, but the margins are
horrible and can't possible generate the kind of EBITDA necessary to justify the amount
of capital tied up in Sears. 
 
MovingEast: In white goods, Sears is more or less a warehouse for Whirlpool and the
days of expert salesmen are gone. Customers come in knowing what machine they want
and the best you're going to do is sell them a moderately overpriced warranty or
installation. How much profitability is there?

Re: "MovingEast's comment. Sear's share of the white goods market in the US is also
declining. Home Depot and Lowes are gaining market share at Sear's expense. See

Can someone please show me where Lampert is on record saying Sears is a real estate

Great post. From an economic standpoint, does anybody think that of its 2000+ stores,
only 120 are underperforming? And in an overmalled/overstored time and place, who will
take over the space or acquire suboptimal locations? As mentioned, the nature of malls
has changed over the last 50 years and the underinvestment in many of Sears locations
makes the value extraction dynamic a difficult one. In fact, some locations may be worth
less as they are than they would be as raw land. And as a few homebuilders know, raw
land is not worth nearly what many paid for a few years ago and banks are still reluctant
to write C&D loans.

It's appropriate to juxtapose Ackman's TGT thesis w/Sears/KMT in this regard- from a
real estate perspective, despite the tenant's credit, there is questionable residual value in
true Big Box Retail- that is 80-150,000 SF buildings. The retail landscape has changed.
The Jr. box retailers who could fill these buildings has diminished, and the retailers that
are still around have reduced their footprints. And the single tenant who turn-keys a
vacant Kmart is few and far between. Point being, there is more risk, less value (not no
value, less) in the real estate in what I believe is a new retail landscape forever more.

not to mention Lambert putting Lou D'Ambrosio in place as CEO. Smart guy no doubt, but
his entire career in sales and marketing roles for Avaya? no retail experience, no real
estate exper. that was MY signal to short....

Short SHLD is a very crowded trade now. It's ignorant to not focus on the real estate and
to focus on the retail operations. That property has plenty of other uses.

John - great post about investor skillsets and arrogance. I'm familiar w/ the concept of a
real estate/asset liquidation play, but a bit ignorant on the details. Speaking purely about
the economics, if the assumption is that the assets are worth more liquidated than as a
going concern, why can't you just shut down all the 2000+ stores, lay the 300k people off,
sell the real estate, and profit on the deal? This thought experminet is of course ignoring
political, social, and moral concerns, but if I understood correctly you are saying that even
on an economic basis this doesn't work, but I didn't see how you reached that conclusion.
If anything it sounds like you are saying the poor business decision was not to shut down
the 120 stores but to keep the other 1880+ open.

I will defend Ackman on his thesis for TGT. He had two main ideas, place the real estate
assets in a REIT and sell the credit card business. 
 
TGT did not sell the credit card receivables, which turns out at the time was the top of the
market. Banks were fighting and paying top dollar for these assets. I believe (and I think
the street does as well) that Ackman was clearly right at the time. 
 
On separating the real estate and putting those assets into a REIT, the 'spreadsheet
math' there are two scenarios. One is that the market will pay more for yield, making two
assets separate worth more. In this specific case, the real estate could have been turned
into a REIT generating perhaps 4 or 5% in yield. (I believe that yield is still bought
aggressively today and this could still be undertaken) 
 
Look at companies that have converted to REIT like structures and/or have announced
that they will. 
 
The other argument is that if the REIT had control of the real estate as a separate entity,
the REIT could say location x is paying $12 per square foot. On renewal, the rate needs
to rise to $14 as we think another retailer would be willing to pay that. 
 
By keeping the allocated cost of rent low, this could keep a marginally profitable store
open vs closing that store and receiving higher profits by renting.

SHLD is turning around slowly moving stores and/or downsizing. If you look at SHLD they
are opening up new smaller stores (less overhead) and investing in them. They realized
some time ago that their stores are too big. 
 
Unfortunately, they have not moved fast enough as profits are dropping faster then they
can cut expenses. 
 
I was surprised that no one noticed (or at least I did not see analysts or seeking alpha
etc) that SHLD basically stopped buying back stock in the previous quarter. I thought this
was a hint that there might be a cash squeeze coming. Granted I thought it would be
early next year with the 4Q being very profitable. I only had a small short position on.

I'm interested in shorting again at higher levels but the current risk/reward is not favorable
in my view.

There are a few difficult things about selling 2000 plus stores. You have (memory here) 7
billions of dollars in trading stock which you are on the hock for (you have purchased it). 
 
A flat "closing down sale" will cost you 2 billion plus. Imagine trying to sell it fast. So you
need to close it piece meal - and keep it functioning as you do so. 
 
Also if you close stores when they are mid lease you get costs - so you want to close as
leases expire etc. The thought experiment makes it clear how hard it is to do and extract
value.

John, lets be clear. 
 
Selling the property of many stores, particularly at the same time is difficult because: 
 
1) Its hard to move that much product (property)and find one or more buyers 
 
2) That type of commercial real estate cyclically is is a bad place 
 
3) Leases, legacy and other costs/legal restrictions are messy. 
 
But, this has absolutely nothing to do with closing the businesses on those sites, or the
number of employees.  
 
John, there is no analysis here mate. Liquidating value has nothing to do with employee
issues. In fact, liquidation value could well be higher in practice if the land will be reused
productively to create local jobs. Business closure is a tough thing to go through. Witness
Ansett folding and taking over 10 years to end for workers etc. But it ain't going to make a
dime of difference to land sales. 
 
Its hard John yes. But its got nothing to do with your read on it- unless I have missed
something? 
 
Regards

To merge your RBS and Sears threads -- in 2006 RBS (via Greenwich Capital) offered to
monetize over $1 billion of Sears stores assets as a "test case" at incredibly attractive
rates via a CMBS transaction, only to be rebuffed by an ESL finance group which felt that
those assets would only increase in value, while believing that continued robust store
operations would ensure that Sears did not need cash in any event. The "spreadsheet
math" would have become reality but for the hubris of ESL/Sears.  
 
The only thing worse than not creating value is actually having value handed to one who
ultimately destroys it.

For someone "without these skills", you definitely understand that stuff well. Better then
most people actually doing it, naturally. 
 
Very few businesses are not, in the end, about employees. And there is absolutely no
known way to motivate them to care while pulling the usual "anticrisis downsizing" stuff. 
 
That's why coomebacks are so rare in big businesses: once stuff goes south, people's
morale follows. Then normally, instead of clinging to people (because in the end, the only
real way business can come back is be pulled by them) and keeping their spirits,
managers dig themselves deeper by crashing on them with poorly-organized "tremble

and despair"-style layoffs, pay cuts and stuff. 
 
It all looks smart on paper, but in reality it just assures that stuff is busy sending out their
CVs, not working and caring. THerefore business loses whatever remains of functional
abilities there were. 
 
Then, naturally, you liquidate assets :) 
 
But on the long horizon, you can place bear bets on companies on first signs of this
"employee base erosion" process and be right way more often then not.

I discussed why Ackman's Target move would fail. http://www.kinnaras.com/blog2/?cat=8 
 
SHLD is a good short, BBY is and I would imagine a lot of mall retailers in middle america
that have big box retailers would be good shorts as well. SPG could be a good long as a
hedge.

great articulated post and threaded comments. 
 
there was another hedge fund guy who bought a crummy business for too much money in
the sixties out of an egomaniacal crusade. It was a textile mill. He also bought a
department store retailer and slowly closed it down as returns were unacceptable to his
internal spreadsheet. (it was the sixties, but he was a smart guy.) 
 
at this point the short bet says Sears is going bankrupt pretty fast. 
Any other scenario for a short has some serious downside risk in my opinion. 
It will be interesting to see where orchard supply trades. 
Also interesting will be if the share buybacks stopped because there was no money, or
because the price was pinned for the first quarter of 2012 between 30 and 60 where
some meaningful buybacks could take place. 
 
I have a hard time imagining that Lampert, even if he is as stupid and evil as many
bashers say, would let Sears go bankrupt. 
Maybe I'm wrong. 
Of course, the buyout was made in what everyone called the "goldilocks economy" 
remember that?
