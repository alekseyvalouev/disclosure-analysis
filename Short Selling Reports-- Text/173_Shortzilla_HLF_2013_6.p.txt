Our Response To Robert Walter Regarding Herbalife And 10b5-1 Plan
Feb. 21, 2013 11:43 AM ET25 comments
by: NA Account


Robert Walter, an attorney we respect, provided a very thought provoking comment on our
Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) report titled "Did Herbalife Repurchase Shares While in Possession
of Material Non-Public Information".


Based upon Robert's comments, we realize that providing further information, to
supplement our report, is necessary.


Robert's comment included:


Your post may not be correct. It is not clear whether HLF used a 10b5-1(C)
plan to engage in the repurchases…. If HLF did use a 10b5-1 plan, the only
requirement concerning non-public information is that HLF cannot have had
possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan was
adopted (July 30, 2012).


Robert's observations hit the nail on the head, especially as they pertain to the possibility
that Herbalife repurchased its shares pursuant to a 10b5-1 Trading Plan.


In an effort to better inform our readers, we present the following.


Note: Source for the following is the Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC").


10b5-1 Trading Plans: As adopted, paragraph (1)(I) sets forth an affirmative defense from
the general rule, which applies both to individuals and entities that trade. To satisfy this
provision, a person must establish several factors.

· First, the person must demonstrate that before becoming aware of the
[material non-public information] information, he or she had entered into a
binding contract to purchase or sell the security, provided instructions to
another person to execute the trade for the instructing person's account, or
adopted a written plan for trading securities.  
 


· Second, the person must demonstrate that, with respect to the purchase or
sale, the contract, instructions, or plan either: (1) expressly specified the
amount, price, and date; (2) provided a written formula or algorithm, or
computer program, for determining amounts, prices, and dates; or (3) did not
permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when,
or whether to effect purchases or sales; provided, in addition, that any
other person who did exercise such influence was not aware of the
material nonpublic information when doing so.  
 


· Third, the person must demonstrate that the purchase or sale that occurred
was pursuant to the prior contract, instruction, or plan. A purchase or sale
is not pursuant to a contract, instruction, or plan if, among other things, the
person who entered into the contract, instruction, or plan altered or deviated
from the contract, instruction, or plan or entered into or altered a
corresponding or hedging transaction or position with respect to those
securities.


Section of Rule 10b5-1 can be used by a company to defend against allegations of
repurchasing shares while in possession of material non-public information, but only if the
company can prove:


(1) that it established the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (governing the repurchase of its
shares) at a time when it was not in possession of material non-public information; and,


(2) that the Rule 10b5-1 Plan met all the requisite requirements above, including, but not
limited to, the second provision above which provides that the Rule 10b5-1 plan


"did not permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over
how, when, or whether to effect purchases or sales".

Comments (25)


A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written plan that extinguishes the ability of the company
[repurchasing its shares] from determining, either at its discretion, based upon market
events or any other reason or strategy, when it will repurchase its shares.


In short, the Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan dictates the conditions under which the company
can repurchase its shares.


DID HERBALIFE REPURCHASE ITS SHARES UNDER A RULE 10b5-1 TRADING
PLAN?


THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO.


Herbalife's press release dated July 30, 2012 [announcing its $1 billion share repurchase
authorization] gives us the facts we need to determine that Herbalife did not establish a
10b5-1 trading plan in connection with its $1 billion share repurchase.


The press release in pertinent part:


Share Repurchase Program Update. …the company's Board of Directors
authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization available to be
utilized over the next 5 year period, expiring on June 30, 2017.


Herbalife's future share repurchases, if any, may take place from time to time
at management's discretion based on market conditions, and shares may be
purchased in open-market, privately negotiated or other transactions.
(Emphasis added)


The facts as we have presented seem to support the proposition that Herbalife did not
repurchase its shares under a 10b5-1 trading plan. Therefore, Herbalife repurchased its
shares while in possession of material non-public information.


Disclosure: I am short HLF. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.
I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business
relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

The implication, as in all his posts, is that he wants to scare people into selling and thus drive the price down so he
can make money on his short.

Maybe the material knowledge held HLF is that it knows it is not an illegal pyramid scheme

matt and shortzilla are both tripping over each other to milk this as long as possible.


next they will start stalking HLF employees off hours to confirm their thesis that this is a global criminal organization.


every time i click on their stories i walk away thinking "mind blown"


i think a more balanced approach is summed up in the following article...

A thoughtful response, but I'm not quite convinced. The press release spoke as of its date. Unfortunately, as we've
seen in some of the insider trading using 10b5-1 plans, the plan can be adopted on a moment's notice, and can be
modified likewise, without any disclosure or announcement by the insider. This is part of the problem that I believe the
SEC is struggling with in relation to insider trading using the plans - they are far too easy to put into place, and modify,
when an insider believes he, she, or it does not "possess" material, non-public information. Proving otherwise can be
very difficult, which is one reason why I believe the SEC is focusing on insider trades outside of a 10b5-1 plan by
insiders who already have a plan in place - a good indicator of something else perhaps driving the trade.


If I were Herbalife's general counsel (which of course I am not), I would have recommended to the board long before
Ackman's presentation that the company adopt a 10b5-1(c) plan. This would have ensured that HLF could continue to
repurchase stock during times it may otherwise have been prohibited from doing so. In that sense, it is a no-brainer -
protect the company from the possiblity of being charged with trading while possessing material, non-public

There was no material non-public information. The idiot short-sellers took their strategy public and provided an
excellent opportunity for share buybacks. Maybe the short-sellers should be subject to "The Hunger Games" and we
can see who's the last idiot standing!

The Share Purchase Program adopted by HLF does not qualify for 10b-5 protection because it does not meet the
parameters of the statute defining the elements of such a plan. In other words, it does not seem to be a 10b-5 plan,
but rather your ordinary share repurchase authorization akin to a written resolution.


21 Feb 2013, 01:32 PM


Robert W Walter, Esq., Contributor
An "ordinary share repurchase authorization" can be made and then take the form of a 10b5-1(c) plan. It is
only a question of how you adopt and implement the plan, which can, as I said, follow the authorization.

Shortzilla's comment goes to the issue - can (should) a company be able to do so when it knows information that you,
an investor, do not know? Whether you agree or disagree, the SEC's mission is investor protection - including
protecting investors from insiders and companies taking advantage of information that is non-public and material.

Doesn't the company always knwo more than the public about its operations - if it does not, that is truly scary
- so, yor hypotheisis appears to be that there can only be a 19B-5 plan or its is an illegal act

The "management discretion" disclaimer at the end is just there so nobody relies upon the release as a concrete
promise to purchase a set amount of shares. It's not a description of this plan, or any plan for that matter.

Two strikes:


1) The SEC requesting information about a $4 billion company after a loudmouth short seller is shouting from every
rooftop that such company is engaged in criminal activity does not constitute material nonpublic information.


2) Even if it did, the MNPI is negative and HLF is BUYING its stock, not SELLING it. Thus, they are not insider
trading.

Let me add: 
3) It was widely reported by the NYT and others on January 9, 2013 (day before HLF investor conference)
that the SEC's enforcement division had started an investigation into HLF.

I find it interesting that the SEC has established complex, but basically understandable, legal criteria, such as 10b5-
1(c), for certain corporate conduct. Contrast this with the FTC's "legal standards" concerning the critical issue whether
a company is operating an illegal pyramid or a 'legal' pyramid based direct selling plan.


Not only are the FTC standards virtually incapable of the type of legal analysis and discussion in this comment thread,
but the Commission appears to have failed to use its investigative authority to determine whether high volume
corporations, such as HLF or Amway, are operating in accord with these standards - unclear as they might be.

Certainly there are no reporting requirements, dealing with 'retail sales' for instance, similar to the SEC's. Given the
economic consequences for the thousands of victims involved with pyramids (100,000 victims in the recent Fortune Hi
Tech case, concerning a company operating in public view for 12 years) it would seem a good idea for the FTC to
establish, by rule, a clear set of standards and, in the meantime, file investigative requests to the larger corporations
using a pyramid type selling plan and analyze the quality of responses received in terms of protecting the public.

Bruce, 
Since this industry is your area of interest. Are there any MLM companies currently in existence that are, in
your opinion, unequivocally legal business entities? Thanks in advance for your response.

"Commission appears to have failed to use its investigative authority to determine whether high volume

How do you know that they haven't? Regulatory agencies will never publicly state an organization is in
compliance with the law if they investigate and find no wrongdoing, they simply remain silent. If they
investigate and find a problem, then they take action either directly with the company (to get them to correct
the wrongdoing), or in an extreme case, work to shut the organization down (like FHTM).


22 Feb 2013, 07:34 AM


Bruce Craig, Contributor
decent question. Given that the MLM industry is a $30 billion/yr operation, it would make sense that the FTC
look into the factors that distinguish, in its opinion, a legal from an illegal pyramid - considering its statements
concerning the significant damage that pyramids can cause to their victims.


A logical start would be with the larger MLMs. It would be hard to imagine, given the current disputes re HLF
and others, that the Commission would not make any statement of an investigative effort to evaluate this
critical legal distinction, if in fact any such effort existed. It would not have to make an explicit report on a
particular company, just a public statement that it had a formal investigative program in place and was looking
into this problem.


The FTC's case against Fortune Hi Tech, however, would cast some doubt on the current existence of any
monitoring program, since the company was operating in plain sight for 12 years before the case was started.
Also the Commission made no statement that its legal action was based on an ongoing program of evaluating
possible pyramids as to the existence of "retail sales" and other supposed protective elements.


One other item, David Einhorn asked Herbalife a relatively simple 'retail sales' question of the type that might
have been asked by the FTC, the ambiguity of the answer, and the controversy it started, would imply that the
question had not previously been asked by the FTC. It is also likely that if HLF had been contacted by the
FTC, and cleared, that it would have make this point by now. Ackman has posed a series of questions, which

HLF does not seem inclined to answer. Perhaps the FTC could take some guidance from these questions and
pose them to Herbalife in a formal context. This would not seem to be an extreme effort, given that Belgium,
the seat of the European Union, has already declared Herbalife a pyramid.


22 Feb 2013, 10:18 AM


Bruce Craig, Contributor
Tough question. It probably can't be answered under the current enforcement environment. The FTC legal
standards are not very clear and they do not necessarily conform with current case law. Also, just what is
going on with these companies is very unclear. As I suggested in a response to another question, it would
make sense for the FTC to begin investigative efforts to see just what is going on in this $30 billion industry,
what business practices, if any, protect, or injure, the public and what has been the experience over the years
for those who have participated in this marketing area. Reports of a 99% failure rate among distributors do
not lend much optimism to the outcome.


22 Feb 2013, 10:32 AM


User 6461431
Bruce: Unfortunately, only a very small portion of individuals actually believe that there is a 99% failure rate.
The data collection method that led to this "statistic" was flawed, and Jon Taylor who was one of the
individuals responsible for the 99% fail "statistic pretty much admitted on SA that the data collection was
flawed.

Shortzilla, according to your original article, the "material non-public info" was the SEC request for additional financial
data from HLF. How would you expect the share price to react to this info? Would the price go down, if people knew
about SEC investigation? Would it not be better for HLF to wait until the SEC investigation news was public before
buying back stock, if the company was indeed interested in benefiting from trading on "material non-public info"? 
Why is this info even "material"? Wasn't the SEC contacted by the company first? Now that the 10-K disclosure is out,
did the share price even react?

Herbalife's future share repurchases, if any, may take place from time to time [at management's discretion] based on

Author makes argument that repurchases are "at management's discretion", but then ignores that they may be
through "privately negotiated or other transactions." Privately negotiated or other transactions could refer to a lot of
things but certainly includes ASRs which can often be structured to result in repurchases through what normally would
be a blackout period. Of course, the plan would have to have been put in place ahead of time and be binding as
noted.


Again, the authors accusations may or may not be correct, but this particular argument does not seem to benefit the
case.
