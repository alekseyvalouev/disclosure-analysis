Youku Business Model Already Failing: Stock Should Follow Suit
Jan. 12, 2011 2:56 AM ET110 comments
by: Alfred Little


The meteoric rise of Youku (NYSE:YOKU) last month cast a spell over Wall Street.
Financial blogs and media outlets trumpeted the arrival of the “Youtube” of China and
investors immediately ran wild with it. The hype caused the stock to skyrocket to almost
$50 before crashing back down to $29 and then briefly rebounding above $40 last week,
where I decided to initiate a short position.


What Youku’s almost fairy tale first couple weeks of trading doesn’t tell you is that this
“Youtube of China” is anything but. Most investors looking at Chinese stocks view them
simply through their financial statements and their ideas of what the Chinese market looks
like from their brief trips there, the couple glasses of “baijiu” pounded over lunch with
management and the articles they’ve read about China. While this approach can work in a
bull market, it does not substitute for on the ground knowledge of the Chinese business
environment and the culture that drives it. A closer look at Youku exposes the fallacies
overlooked by daytraders bidding over $4B for a company with a failing business model
that lost $25 million in the first 3 quarters of 2010 and over $100 million since inception.


First off, a major mistake is misconstruing Youku for a Youtube. We all know Youtube as
the website where we watch Charlie biting his brother’s finger or watch pandas sneezing.
Most Youtube videos are just such user generated content (UGC). Youku started out with
this business plan, but quickly decided UGC was a dead end in China (only 20% of its
videos today are UGC). I’ve spent a fair amount of time in Chinese internet cafes
observing the clientele who spend the majority of their time watching copyrighted full
length TV shows and movies while surfing the internet or playing games. Youku realizes
this too and in its early stages captured a large portion of this massive audience by
allowing users to upload full-length videos, including copyright infringing videos, until
recently. In short, Chinese don’t log onto Youku to watch a chipmunk with a dramatic
stare, but to watch the latest episodes of copyrighted content such as Grey’s Anatomy,
Korean soap operas or the news.


Not surprisingly, as Youku grew infringement lawsuits started piling up. Youku’s first
response was to change its business plan again to spend millions licensing increasingly
expensive professionally produced content that accounts for 70% of its videos today (the
remaining 10% is expensive original content produced by Youku itself). The cost of
professionally produced content, according to Youku, is astronomically rising and is the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/246088-youku-business-model-already-failing-stock-should-follow-suit 2/31


major challenge to its current business model since advertisers pay very low rates and
users refuse to pay anything at all. According to Youku’s own IPO filing (page 17, available
here):


The market prices for professionally produced content, especially popular movies
and television serial dramas, have increased significantly in China during the past
few years. For example, according to our internal records, the average license fee
for television serial drama has increased in 2009 by more than 200% as compared
to 2008, and such fee has increased in 2010 to date by more than 100% as
compared to 2009. The average license fee for movies has also increased in 2010 to
date by more than 90% as compared to 2009.


Compared to the rapidly rising costs for content acquisition, the fees advertisers pay
Yokou have barely budged. Youku suffers from intense competition for advertising dollars
from numerous smaller sites that still freely distribute infringing content. This is the worst
kind of diseconomy of scale. The bigger Youku gets, the bigger its losses.


Pressure from the Chinese government for the larger players to remove infringing content
peaked in January 2010, when Youku removed large amounts of infringing content from its
servers by implementing a digital fingerprinting technology meant to root out all copyright
infringing material (article here).


As the chart of daily unique visitors below shows, Youku’s site traffic immediately
collapsed 75%. In October traffic rebounded somewhat but in November the Chinese
government renewed aggressive calls for the continued removal of infringing material from
streaming servers just prior to Youku's IPO (as stated in an article here). Youku is
complying, killing its traffic, and forcing it to pour increasingly large amounts of capital into
licensing fees since its December IPO. Now with most of the illegally uploaded content
removed, Youku’s traffic according to Google Trends has more or less flat-lined since the
IPO and is half of what it was just one year ago despite seeing an uptick since October
(see chart below, click to enlarge):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/246088-youku-business-model-already-failing-stock-should-follow-suit 3/31


Anticipating its desperate need for more revenues to pay for rising licensing costs, Youku
in early 2010 began experimenting with charging for its videos via its Youku Premium
service. With this latest change to its business plan, Youku hopes Chinese users will pay
to view what was previously free on Youku (cue cheers from Hollywood and laughs from
Youku’s legions of copyright infringing competitors)!


The company recently announced that it had bought the rights to stream the hit Warner
Bros movie “Inception” on its premium on-demand paid video service (article here). But
Youku has now left itself at a hopeless disadvantage to competitors who stream
copyrighted material just hours after it hits the big screen in America. “Inception”, for one,
was commonplace on Chinese streaming sites at least six months ago. What Chinese
person is going to pay to watch it now?


Youku also recently announced a deal with Disney to stream 5 seasons of Desperate
Housewives (article here). This purely “political” will further please Hollywood and
government regulators but spells disaster for investors. No one seriously thinks Chinese
viewers will pay for content and there is little belief that, at the end of the day, the revenue
from ads and the tiny fee for a la carte video or subscription services can offset the
massive cost of content that Youku admits is doubling each year! It is common knowledge
in China that if one video website takes infringing videos down due to an IPO or
government pressure, consumers immediately switch to smaller websites willing to stream
them for free.


What the “wangba” (internet café in Chinese) user demands will be supplied! It took me
only a few seconds to find exactly what I wanted (US TV shows, movies etc.) on other
lesser-known websites such as ppstream.com, 56.com, zoltv.com etc. The fact remains,
the Chinese will not pay for content that can easily be found elsewhere, not to mention
that if it can’t be found streaming online, Chinese will simply revert back to their failsafe:
BitTorrenting or just buying it from a DVD hawker on the street! The majority of Chinese
internet users are living in tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and don’t have much else in the form of
entertainment except to go to the internet café. None of them are going to pay 5 RMB
($0.75) to watch a movie on top of having to pay to use the internet café. It simply is
beyond their budget, especially since it was free before and continues to be free from any
number of competing sites. In a country where rampant inflation of food prices is already
biting deeply into the average person’s disposable income, there is little chance that 5
RMB will be spent on a movie that was once free.

Comments (110)


As Shane Farley pointed out (here), playing nice to Hollywood and charging for content
actually acts as a strong competitive disadvantage creating diseconomy of scale for
Youku. If you’re going to play by the rules in a market where no one else will, you will lose.
Youku has boxed itself in by going legit, with site traffic stalled for a year now as users
depart for other websites. Who wants to own a business losing customers with rapidly
rising costs relative to its competitors? Apparently only daytraders and only for a few
minutes!


With no growth in traffic, hemorrhaging $25 million during the first 3 quarters of 2010 and
having already burned through $160 million in venture capital funding, according to Xiao
Zhixiang of International Data Corporation Youku had no choice but to go public or go
bust. In a China Daily article (link here), Xiao states


There is no other option for Youku […] except filing an IPO. If they could not get
listed, it would be hard for them to get more venture investment to continue and
some video websites hosted by portals and search engines, such as tv.sohu.com
and qiyi.com, may surpass them in short time.


To add further confusion, before the IPO, Youku and Goldman Sachs were hoping to get a
$1 billion valuation priced at $12.80. Given their knowledge of the financials and the
company’s situation, they believed that $12.80 was a fare price. To jump from what was
thought to be a fare valuation of $1 billion to over $4 billion in a few weeks is astonishing
given Youku’s urgent need to IPO in order to keep their operation afloat.


Obviously from a financial perspective, the bloated valuation of Youku at over $4 billion
looks absurd compared to its peers SINA, SOHU, and BIDU, as shown recently by Chimin
Sang (here). No matter how you look at it, Youku stock is overvalued and the market is
now beginning to realize that Youku’s business model is failing and will continue to fail
until the company dramatically downsizes its dreams and shrinks its video offerings until
they can be paid for out of its meager advertising revenues.


Three years from now, even at $3 this stock will still not be cheap.


Disclosure: I am short YOKU.

If this person took half the amount of time to review the charts, rather than tring to break down a company into
what it has been or hasn't been, he might see that YOKu is on the fridge of an outbreak. I think Yoku will
break out of its shoulder towards 50.18 and prove volitale around 51. It should then decline back to 40 to 50
ratio and then gain ground reaching a strong hold of 100. This is speculative but I give Yoku 85.07.

I bet Youku could just spend 0.1% of its revenue to hire an army of "wangba" surfers to seek and report to the
government the providers of copyright-infringing contents that directly compete with Youku's now-legal ones. For this
to work Youku needs the backing of the government or it will be fighting against the wind. Governement pressure on
copyright infringement must be substantial or else why Youku itself has jumped the boat and started to pay for its
contents?

No one can counter his claims with reason. They can only sling mud at his work. But no one slinging mud has
done a tenth of the research he has. He may still be wrong, but he's not mindlessly pumping up a stock he
knows nothing about. 
Funny how the short sellers are always chided for trying to push the stock down with their analysis, but the
fan boys who are long, give us nothing but slogans, and they have no agenda? Please...

FYI the Google Trend data is misleading, as Google traffic for all major Chinese web sites shows a sharp drop from
early 2010, when Google announced it's "new approach to China" and Google's own search traffic from China began
to drop precipitously. Track Google Trends website traffic for baidu.com, qq.com, sina.com.cn and you'll see same
drops at same time, best to show youku.com traffic vs tudou.com, 56.com, etc to do apples to apples, or also check
Baidu Index (for search term traffic not website traffic)

okay, i can't comment on your stock valuations but everything else you've said about youku is correct.


i suspect all the backlash you're getting on this forum are from fellas who have invested in youku or work for
them (right fellas?). well, i have been doing business with youku for a while, and have seen their 'actual'
numbers for months. it ain't pretty, baby. but then, youku are on the wrong side of the Long Tail - like many
video-sharing platforms. no one is monetizing their inventory enough to cover their server/bandwidth/marke...
costs.


and is being called The Youtube of China such a compliment? tudou, QQvideo and indeed youku are
lightyears ahead in terms of ad formats and business modelling.

Youku's ranking went up yesterday (now at 47) up 4.7% in one day. And if you don't understand what the
word "viral" means then look it up. But one thing you should understand; viral content plays havoc with traffic
statistics.


What is alarming most in your reply is that you paint Tudou as Youku's competitor where both companies
have cross-licensing agreement for each other's content.


Alexa.com's traffic shows Youku on top with tudou's pattern mirroring that of youku. I fail to see your point that
youku is in retreat but I do see the need to put up erroneous Google stats to support your point of view.


A bigger chunk of tudou's traffic is generated outside of China than that of Youku. that traffic is credited to
those seeking open access to copyrighted content in their own country. That traffic will dissipate as China
cracks down.


the entire article is unfortunate.

For its part, it is also looking to expand its business in to paid content and is looking to get in to paid content delivery.


The most laughable part of your comparison? Youtube is also looking to add a subscription model. To envision the
convergence of services like Hulu, Hulu+, Youtube, Netflix escapes you. This is the path in the United States and it
shouldn't be too far of a stretch to think Youku is also going in this direction.

forcing them to pay for content at prices that have doubled each year. The smaller competitors will continue to
have the massive competitive advantage of being able to stream copyright infringing materials for free

the diseconomies of scale in this business.

You singled out Youku and said in a passing reference about its competitors. Forgive me for calling a hype-
spinner a hype-spinner.


The other inference would be; you actually think the video driven content is on the decline in China!


Chinese government has extreme control over the Internet. it actively kills pirated websites in an instant. You
just don't hear about it...and your irresponsibility would have a passerby think that that the Chinese are
allowing pirate sites to go on while killing the big players. I guess it wouldn't be too fun to say the Chinese
user has to go through a rigamarole to get to illegal content either.


For whatever "personal" reason, I think you did your community a disservice by disguising this drivel under
"research".

ohhh and one other obvious thing.... the biggest on the Internet is everything... and spending $100 million to

For those of you interested in reality and factual information


Youku is ranked #56 in worldwide traffic. It gets 89% of its traffic from inside China. and 2% traffic coming from the
United States.


Is stating $3 a share for a company ranked 56 in the world in generating traffic a gross valuation misrepresentation?

I just went through what he's shorted - BORN and RINO.. 2 corrupt companies perhaps.


In this instance, this is not a story of corruption, but legitimate revenue from premium buying.. like the NFLX story,
except in China. As they crack down on the illegal content feeding competition, the only one left standing will be
YOKU.


YOKU has clearly stated in its IPO statements that they had to shut down its free infringing content. Do you think that
the Govt is only targeting YOKU and not the others?


Also 5 RMB is nothing for Chinese now - it is a small price to pay to avoid Govt crackdown. This guy needs to wake
up to the China story that is changing.

just get you on Jon Stewart.


Use the same criteria (you know, your keen sense of business dissection) to valuate Facebook or even
YouTube.


burnt out ! using terms like that glorifies the personal nature of your attack. That's not being objective when
you're trying to present a case to the reader. That's just attempting to manipulate the reader.. nothing more...
it's the same as the RINO guys trying to dupe their shareholders.. you know, the one you called a fraud!

Youku.com Inc. is China's leading Internet television company. Our mission is to become the primary source of video
content for Chinese internet users across all Internet-enabled devices.  
Youku offers a combination of licensed professional content, user-generated content and self-produced web video
content. According to iResearch, Youku attracts approximately 203 million monthly unique visitors from homes and
offices and 56 million monthly unique visitors from Internet cafes in September 2010. Youku has a 40% share of total
user time spent viewing online videos among Chinese internet users during the second quarter of 2010, according to
iResearch. Youku was launched in December 2006.


The above is from Youku.com here is the link: www.youku.com/about/en/


To help you understand the magnitude of this internet giant is to think about this: 203 Millions visitors every months
that is say 2/3 of U.S. population goes to visit their website in 30 days. Can you imagine that? Or think it this way, 7
millions visitors to their website every single day. That is like whole New York city population goes to their website in
just one day. Not to include the visitors from internet cafe. This is the giant of internet video website. It is the No. 1 in a
country where the population is 5 times of the U.S. You just simply cannot ignore the magnitude and gigantic market
and huge potential. It is too big to ignore.

balazs
moffie, 
forget about it. 
i think he got out before the uptrend, so he claims. 
there is another guy here who is apparently still short. do not envy him. 
my biggest problem is how is speculation shorting? 
this and many other articles are pure conjuncture and speculation. sometimes with delibarate skweing of
facts. see my explanations for internet statics here somwhere. very basic, easy to understand. 
also i do not dount that with 100 million the author could build the 10th most popular site, so could i maybe
even with just 10 million. its in the details. for 100 million you would build a fad, but with youku the users just
keep coming back and stay longer and longer, which in fact is even more important then number of users. 
you do understand that if 1 users views a 1000 videos, he will still be counted as 1 user?


anyway no need to get personal. 
anyone with any exprience in the internet industry or a chinese wife, will know this article is pure speculation. 
did it move the marget price? who knows, most likely not. 
i am personaly an investor in youku. i downtrend. etc can hurt, but worth any pain as this will have an
excellent return in 2-3 year time frame, if not sold out before. 
he who laughs the last laughs the hardest. 
this will also be the case with dang. you can attack all comnpanie as much as you want. however, i have
rarely if ever made a long bad term descision.

There is nothing wrong being short YOKU or anything. Not at all... but what was wrong of him was his
assessment, bulldung theories and crappy valuation.


He says give me a $100 million and he'll make any site a #10 biz... ! I think the only way he is going to make
any site #10 on any list is by giving away money, and I doubt $100 million is going to cover the chinese
population. So he even misses on his business plan.

however, spreading lies and market manipulation is not shorting. it is at best speculation.

It wasn't really speculation.. he waited for a weak moment in YOKU and then pounced on it with his article
compounding the down move.


I don't know much about EBIX but this guy probably doesn't either.


As I write this YOKU is hitting north of $50. About $47 north of his valuation. At what point are these people
ripe to say "I was wrong, sorry"

President and COO of a very sucessful company why do you think he left for Youku.com Couple years after he

Your logic is flawed.


If Victor knows business, then jumping from SOHU to YOKU is a testament to YOKU's prospects. You dont
make any sense!


Of course the other inference is that Victor is looking to commit fraud. Which is basically what you are saying
without saying it. LOL @ "Victor knows business."


You are making statements on what other people will do. The problem with statements like yours, aside from
you don't know anything about Victor or what he might do is that; there is no accountability. All you're doing is
throwing crap and if something sticks, you crow about it but easily forget your duds.

expanding and growing that is a good thing. Yes they are not profitable yet but their growth is huge unlike some U.S.
companies, which is profitable but their growth and earning are lower than same time a year ago. In another words
they are making money but their growth either stopped or slowed compare to a year ago. Do you see a recent U.S.
company today making 135% revenue growth nowadays? Probably not, I think as long as Youku.com keeps making
progress and revenues are growing faster than anybody else and more than expected it really has a nice looking
forward future. I like this CEO alot. I couldn't name other CEO like him to leave a profitable company like SOHU then
start over a new business in just a few years and boom it is No. 1 again?! Are you kidding me?

Youku founder Victor Koo believes only China can help his company grow, make money and even beat piracy


Youku founder Victor Koo believes only China can help his company grow, make money and even beat piracy 
The East's answer to YouTube recently had the best opening day on the New York Stock Exchange for five years, and
Koo is expecting even greater things in his homeland.


Victor Koo's Youku gets more than 260m viewers a month and they spend an average of an hour on the site By
Malcolm Moore, in Shanghai 4:55PM GMT 14 Dec 2010  
3 Comments  
It's been a topsy-turvy week for Victor Koo, the world's most recently-minted billionaire


Last Tuesday, his company Youku, China's answer to YouTube, had the best opening day on the New York Stock
Exchange for five years, its shares zipping up 161pc from their opening price of $12.80 (£8.13).


By the middle of the week, shares were trading at $50, valuing Youku at close to $5bn. That's not much compared
with Apple ($294bn), but it is almost twice the worth of the once-mighty AOL.


By Friday, however, the bears had sunk their teeth into the online video company and brought the shares back down
to $37.50. At Tuesday lunchtime they were trading around $31.40.


That still leaves Mr Koo, who owns more than a third of the company, a paper billionaire, even if he had picked up a
sore throat while pitching Youku to investors. "I did 87 presentations in 12 days [in the run-up to the initial public
offering]," he said.

The slog also seems to have left him slightly grumpy about the perpetual comparisons between Youku and YouTube.
It doesn't help that the two names sound similar in English, even if Youku has an entirely different meaning in Chinese
(its two characters mean "Good" and "Cool").


On the surface, the two online video sites appear similar, although the US site is banned by the censors in China.


But, as Mr Koo said: "If Youku had adopted YouTube's business model we just would not be here. We would not
exist." More than half of the videos on YouTube, he claims, were made by the site's users. "That means that most of it
is people watching videos of cats. And you cannot build a serious business around cat videos."


The problem for YouTube, said Mr Koo, was that the six big media owners in the US were wary of licensing their films
and television programmes to a company owned by Google, who they all regard as a major threat.


"The online video business started in both China and the US around 2005/6, when broadband penetration grew big
enough," said Mr Koo. "But in the US, there is $300bn of assets tied up in the national cable network. That represents
a lot of jobs and it makes people resistant to moving media online."


By contrast, the Chinese market is fragmented enough for Youku to play the field, snapping up television programmes
from different provincial television networks. "China's most popular show is made by Jiangsu television, it's a dating
programme called If You Are The One. But its ratings were only 3pc of viewers," he said. "China's Got Talent was
huge in Shanghai, but got 2pc nationwide," he added. "This is a hugely fragmented market".


Unlike YouTube, Youku is aiming to provide an alternative television station for young, professional and urban
Chinese. It licenses TV shows from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and screens them a day after they have been
broadcast. It pays its users up to £100 for videos that they make, and it produces its own hits. One show, called Hip
Hop Office Quartet, generated more than 100m views.


Youku bought the rights to show World Cup matches this summer from CCTV, the state broadcaster, and has worked
with CCTV to broadcast the online version of the annual Spring Festival Gala, perhaps the most-viewed television
show in the history of the world, with 800m people tuning in.


Last weekend, the site began screening Inception, the Hollywood blockbuster, with customers paying five yuan (50p),
through the internet or on their mobile phones, to watch. "We couldn't afford the Hollywood licensing fees to screen it
for free, so when we do offer these films, it tends to be pay-per-view and a revenue split," said Mr Koo.


So far, Mr Koo's efforts have generated huge traffic. It gets more than 260m viewers a month and they spend an
average of an hour on the site. Some of its movies have scored more highly on Chinese search engines, he said, than
Harry Potter. Revenues are up 135pc in the first nine months of this year.


And he is confident that Chinese viewers will continue to prefer Youku to pirate DVDs. "Why pay even 30p for a pirate
DVD when you can watch it for free?" he asked. But, like its Chinese counterpart Tudou, and perhaps like YouTube as
well, Youku is not profitable. So far, the only major video-sharing website that is generating a profit is Hulu, a platform
for television shows whose shareholders include News Corp, Disney and NBC Universal.


"We're not profitable," Mr Koo conceded. "Our investment is large. But our revenues are growing faster than our costs
and we see a clear path to profitability," he insisted.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/246088-youku-business-model-already-failing-stock-should-follow-suit 19/31


He pointed to the fact that three-quarters of China's 420m internet users are now watching video, compared with just
10pc three years ago.


And he said that Youku had plenty of space to expand its advertising revenues.


"In the US, search engines are king. That is because everyone already knows what they are looking for. Brands have
been around for a long time. But in China that is not the case. This is the first generation of people buying cars and
fridges. Video is much more important. You cannot transmit the branding through text banners and pictures," he said.
"On our site, we show one minute of advertising per hour, compared with the 12 minutes shown on Chinese TV.
Imagine how we can scale that up," he said.


However the shares perform in the near future, Mr Koo said the listing was not about raising money. "We did this for
strategic reasons. We already had $50m to $60m in the bank. We did not need the money.


"In China, going public has a cachet from a branding standpoint. It will improve our image to ad agencies, government
regulators. Look at what happened to Baidu when it went public. We are the same scale," he said.


The reference to Baidu is calculated. China's answer to Google was Youku's predecessor – the last company to
shock the New York Stock Exchange by rising 354pc when it launched in 2005, and enjoying a clear run of success
ever since.

occupy elsewhere, thanks to the new availability of low-cost digital video cameras.


March 
After a heavy blizzard hits the northeastern city of Shenyang, paike videos shot by Youku users bring coverage of the
snowfall to a nationwide audience, while traditional media, snowbound, is less easily able to cover the event. CCTV,
China's largest television network, rebroadcasts these Youku videos.This marks the start of a media cross-pollination
in which television stations rebroadcast paike video -- a trend that has continued to grow to this day.

Hey Al, another great article as a start. People just don't realize the fact that under its current business model and
such an environment, YOKU may NEVER make any money, forever. The tiny stream of advertising revenue is never
going to support the high cost of content creation, not to mention spending massive amount of money buying
professionally produced content. Too bad YOKU, unlike the real Youtube, has so little user generate content. It's funny
people only see fast revenue growth but they don't realize they bigger YOKU grow, the more money loses. YOKU is
essentially spending investors money to buy "revenue growth" at the expense of growing losses. This website isn't
anywhere close to a utility type of service, and it simply doesn't have the necessary pricing power to pass on the fast
growing content costs to end users/advertisers. The only smart thing Victor Koo did was naming his website
something similar to "Youtube" so naive American investors would actually believe the two are kind of similar.


The hype around this dot-com reminds me of the initial hype and subsequently demise of VISN stock.

Another article mentioned why Yoku/Toudou have to remove pirated contents as they go on IPO in US market: the
penalty for copyright infringement in US is much higher than China. Yoku could be sued in US if using pirated
contents according to US law. But the penalty is much smaller if being sued in China. That is why smaller video sites
use pirated content: they have not much money, and they need contents to attract users. The risk is actually low for
them.


Here is an example:"优酷、土豆申请上市前，大批...


Yoku only paid 300K USD for 4 years from 2007 to 2010 for copyright infringement, it could be 100M if sued in US.

40 day quiet period ends for YOKU today. Anaylists can begin writing research for this company come Tuesday.
Interesting dilemma due to unsustainable price for analysts, on one side: support lofty valuation to entice other
Chinese IPO's in the offing; on the other side, risk credibility of firm by embracing loft price followed by decline. GS
downgraded BIDU after IPO in 2005 and was correct in doing so. Prospects are the same for YOKU.


Regardless Koo owns 25% and is now a billionaire on paper. IPO shows 6 month lock-up. I am sure he will be selling
to lock in gains on this established loss leader stock. However, before that time, healthy pull back will occur and

16 Jan 2011, 09:16 AM


TradesandHolds
Ratings out today. Neutral rating by Piper Jaffray with a PT of $40. Goldman Sachs issues a neutral rating with a PT
of $37.00. Further states YOKU could be profitable in 3-4 years. Refers to Tudou which is profitable. (Hmmm, GS
trying to get Tudou IPO perhaps?)


At best, YOKU hit the high price target already. Translation of neutral rating is back-peddling for a sell rating. By rating
a neutral and partially embracing a high price, both advisors lose no face with YOKU and prospective IPO's, as the
stock delivered and they can attribute the IPO's success to their participation.


However, any investor who stays in this stock though is at their own risk. Kudos to PJ and GS of walking the financial
tightrope. On one hand, assuaging their clients' needs (high price, please) and on the other hand, timely informing
investors that the time to sell is now.


Lock-up expiration is in 5 months, when Koo most likely will sell a good portion of his 25% interest. Watch for the
deterioration in YOKU's price as that date approaches. Tick, tick, tick...


18 Jan 2011, 07:22 AM


WarrenettaBuffett
@TradesandHolds, do you think its all downhill at this point for Dang and Yoku? Will YOKU see 40 again?


18 Jan 2011, 08:39 AM


TradesandHolds
Hard to say if YOKU will hit 40 again. Of course, it easily could with an announcement of a large investment by a
reputable company or other some material corporate development. One never knows.


What we do know is that GS said today that YOKU may be a possibly profitable company in 3-4 years (which
assumes perfect financial tailwinds in China for YOKU). Over the near term, IMO I would reasonably assume that
investors will not continue to harbor such sanguine investment objectives for YOKU with mere possibilities of
profitability. Further, I believe with Tudou coming public soon, which also claims to be the leading video website
provider in China, and clearly, a direct competitor of YOKU, which also happens to be profitable, YOKU investors may
jump ship as well. Undoubtedly, profitability of Tudou will be emphasized in its IPO.


The approaching lock-up date in May is definitively a strong negative for YOKU. I project a minimum 10-20% decline
on that event alone, as has occurred for other IPO's. (I.e TSLA with an IPO price $17.00, jumped 100%, but note the
drop from 32 to 25 at expiration of 6 month lock-up.) With YOKU at 193% of IPO price of $12.80, if YOKU is remotely
near its current price, expect a further decline.)


Overall, I think the general market is tired which does not bode well. Looming federal deficit, eventual interest rate
increases, inflation, Euro decline, PIIGS bailouts, etc. will inevitably result in a shift to more conservative stock
investments, bonds or cash.

I would have expected YOKU to have bounced at 31, demonstrating its following of momentum players, but that did
not happen. (Not that it matters, I sold my short position at 31 and hold no position at this time.) Admittedly, I was
hoping to short again at higher prices, but it appears as the market makes no highs in January, YOKU slowly is
deflating. Timing wise, I was wrong. I should have held. IMO I firmly believe that the AL article is on point and mid- to
low 20's for YOKU is optimistic in the near term and lower in the long term.

remember what you are doing is not shorting.

speculation is that it is like gambling. you win some, you loose some. expect to loose big on this one. why not
stick with proven chinese rto frauds?  
and when the lock down expires, the ceo will likely increase his shares, not sell them. you will see.

stickier traffic. look at metrics for all similar sites. start with youtube from the begining, look at financials, or ad
agencies placements. the trafic may have slowed, but those people are spening a lot more time there. same
as facebook "time". youku traps people within. and dont worry, traffic is seasonal and prone to fluctuations, it
will pick up.

although i respect you totally and read your articles, i still think you are wrong about youku. 
this isnt shorting but an evaluation call, to often the downfall of shorts and bears.  
you have no proof of fraud, and question their metrics. 
well big news ALL internet sites (AMZN, EBAY, GOOG, seekingalpha inculded etc) included tweek internet
metrics to suite them. This is not fraud, its just that it is a sketchy area. 
Youku is not slowing but growing, I think you wanted to write. And I still maintan (wuthout proof, but based on
a gut feeling and alignment of the stars), bubble or not, this company will get bought out (soon, this year) 
anyway i dont want to argue. 
rather i want to point out, isnt this the greatest system? where you can make 20-30% shorting a stock, and I
can achieve double the return (just a small boast, on same time scale almost) holding it long. 
this is the best system ever. 
i please don short youku again, or at least tell me first:)
