The sometimes eccentric views of John Hempton

Something is happening here and you don't know what it is
- do you Mr Hempton: Richemont edition
I am wrong often enough to hurt - but rarely this fast. Richemont just pre-announced a big sales
increase. I expected at best low single-digit sales increases and the company to guide down. I
blogged about it only on Friday. Richemont was a modest sized short position and I was trading it for
what I thought would be an earnings miss. 
 
This company sells very fine jewellery and high end watches. By high-end I mean up to half a million
dollars. 
 
Richemont is - as I said in the original post - an amazing company that has managed to make super-
luxury goods ubiquitous whilst they remain exclusive. 
 
The sales rise during the first four months is 24 percent (16 percent in constant currencies). 
 
We have a broken thesis rule at Bronte. We search for things that falsify our thesis - and when we find
them we close our position. This big sales increase tells me that something is happening in this
business that is outside my thesis and not obviously consistent with the thesis. 
 
So we just covered. Loss to clients was about 40bps of our funds under management. It was not the
first time and it will not be the last time we make a mistake... 
 
Speculations 
 
As of about five minutes ago we no longer have any interest in Richemont, long or short. But that
won't stop me trying to work out what we did wrong. The sales increase is enormous given current
economic trends. Lets think this through by jurisdiction... 
 
I would expect a (big) sales increase in Japan because the previous corresponding period includes
the earthquake and tsunami. 
 
I would be startled by anything other than a sales decline in Europe. There is an economic crisis there
and as one of my correspondents put it - the one percent are becoming the half a percent. 
 
North America is doing OK - so I would expect a sales increase - but low single digit. 
 
South America will - like Australia - be beginning to feel some commodity price anxiety - so sales
increases will be small. 
 
The anecdotal stuff out of China and Hong Kong is all bad. Correspondents sent me
many anecdotes - all supportive of my thesis - and the plural of anecdote has always been data. 
 
None of this allows for a twenty percent sales increase. 
 
I have heard only one alternative thesis - and that is that sales within Mainland China are increasing -
not because they want the watches and jewellery but because they are portable wealth that you can
move over a border with or store like gold. It might be true - but watches and jewellery strike me as
poor stores of value. The anecdotes in my email suggest that the gray market is weak - but those
anecdotes are so thin that I doubt them. 
 
Any other thoughts - because I am at a loss.

Hi John, 
 
I think in a normal working economy your thesis about Richemont was and is absolutely
right. 
But as you could see it last week in the stock market with that abnormal ups and downs
you realize that we are in unnormal times.  
It feels like your shipping with your boat in the atlantic and you cross stormy weather with
big waves. 
 
As everybody knows Richemont is selling luxury goods with world famous brands.
Everybody knows it. 
 
A lot of rich "new" rich people in the Region of Iran, Irak, Turkey, China earned a lot of
"black Money" who didn´t pay taxes on their earnings. So this money is flewing to
Richemont, because as you described watches and bags can be easily carried from
country a to country b. And if you need money you can sell this stuff for less than you
paid , but it´s much better than paying tax. 
 
So I think Richemont is a kind of a "Swiss Bank" for some "New Rich" people from
undevelopped countrys. If you bring your money to the bank you will get only a saving
book. But if you bring your money to richemont then you get a luxury good. If the bank
goes bancrupt you or tells other countrys government about your financial sitution (Swiss-
Germany)you can be caught or loose your money. But if Richemont goes bancrupt you
have the luxury good you cann sell it to other people and you are ananymous. 
 
(Sorry for my bad english, I hope I could tell ou my thesis. Richemont is "the new Swiss
Bank")

Potential answers to your conundrum (In descending order of likelihood): 
 
1) Your HK Sales Data is wrong. It was pointed out by a commenter that it is sample data
from 3000 stores, and not actual sales tax receipts. There may be something wrong with
their sampling methodology or the figures may have been cooked by the retailers or the
HK gov. 
2) Your HK Sales Data is right, and some other market (Russia, the Middle East) has
taken up the slack and more. This could be down to better marketing in those regions due
to the dropoff in HK sales. 
3) The sales growth is a result of channel stuffing. Persistent Richemont reps have
persuaded stores to take even more inventory (at a discount) and this has resulted in a
blip in sales growth, which merely kicks the (explosive) can a little further down the road. 
If this one turns out to be true you will curse yourself for closing your position. 
 
I look forward to the followup - It is always nice to see smarter people than me crunch this
stuff, and as a non-investor strangely thrilling when they're wrong :)

how does Richemont books its sales? Upon shipment, placement of order? Could there
be something funny here?

Simple - you went to great lengths to comment on the proliferation of Chinese 'princelings'
(or whatever you called them), and now you're surprised that China demand has held up.
You could have gone long on your own evidence, alone. 
 
What's a bug from various points of view is a feature if you're Richemont.

jewellery is a very good store of value. Its better than gold or silver coins, even though the
gold and silver content of jewellery is lower. I have found that jewellery market is more
liquid than coin or bar market for precious metals.

A watch is indeed a terrible store of value - after all the GM is hefty for both the
watchmaker and the seller. But is it worse than keeping your cash in EUR? Or CNY, given
your "kleptocrats" thesis?

Why don't you spend a day at the Galeries Lafayette in Paris? Chinese continue to buy
expensive watches & jewelry. They buy a bit less in the mainland & HK. Way more in
large European cities. I insist: spend a day at the Galeries Lafayette in Paris.

I have the utmost respect for you, John, in placing the trade and 'owning' it when wrong in
such a public forum. No excuses. Rare indeed. 
 
The money-laundering properties of watch sales in HK have to be seen to be believed.
People buy expensive watches and LITERALLY walk them next door and sell them at a
big discount for cash whereupon the second jeweler sells it back to the guy who first sold
it... and round it goes. Everybody's happy... almost! 
 
FWIW, I happen to think your thesis is spot-on, but like many others in a world of
interventions, getting the timing right gets increasingly difficult. 
 
Richemont WILL have its day in the shadows.

If anyone has been to hk/china since April of 2012, they will know john's thesis is
completely correct. China is slowing down massively and china luxury consumption is
falling off a lot. Look at the hk listed watch retailers (hengdeli, oriental watch, emperor
jewellery). Why would richemont be immuned to the pain felt by their retailers?

Mr. Hempton.  
 
First of all, I have become an avid reader of your blog - consistently excellent work.  
 
Secondly some suggestion on the thesis violation. 
 
1) Perhaps your point doesnt directly impact ostentatious consumption. Rather it impacts
the display of ostenatious wealth. Chinese cleptocrats are still buying the watches, its just
that they are not wearing them in public anymore. If you want to wear your watch take a
trip to Vancover.  
 
2) When Khodorkovsky was arrested in Russia, it was not a clampdown on oligarchs. It
was a demonstration that disloyalty to the new regime would not be tolerated. The Putin
loyalist oligarchs flourished post Khorokovsky take down.  
 
3) Perhaps what we are witnessing is just the start of the power struggle in China. It isnt
clear yet who will win or what policies they will institute. In that enviroment capital flight
was accelerate. Richemont benefits from this capital flight.  
 
4) China is definitely slowing. But China still has ammunition to stimulate its economy. It
wont help in the long run, but they wouldnt be the first to desperately press the f9 button
over and over again. It is the only button they have. In the short run this will boost asset
demand. Perhaps these items of jewelry are assets?

I just thought I'd throw an anecdote in here. A few years ago my young cousin was doing
work experience in the London offices of a firm that may have been Richemont, if you get
my drift. They were paying her around £300/week. She received a phone call from the
Paris office inviting her to transfer over there. The pay would be much less, but imagine
the prestige! One small requirement would be that she would have to register at a
university and then fail the exams. The company could thus continue to claim the subsidy
for giving experience to students. She stayed in London and is now loaded. I'm not sure if
this tells you more about France than about the ethics prevalent in luxury goods sector
multinationals.

1) LFL rev growth rate has halved per the numbers 
2) Revs recognized now reflect orders placed several months prior, when trading was
better for retailers 
3) Absent data on working capital, how to judge the quality of the EBIT? What if they built
inventory and took benefit to GM? What if there are one time items? Lots of unknowns 
4) Bar now set higher for full H1 numbers 
5) Curious timing of statement. Mgmt piqued? 
6) Boss has publicly described China biz as like a "black tie dinner on top of a volcano."
An additional course has been served, but what else has changed?

i think all this talk of new and emerging millionaires is a little off. 500k items are out the
price range of the average "millionaire" as alsorts of things are being factored into that
million. Rather we should be looking at the behavior of their existing costomer base. I
mean, didnt the Sultan of Brunei buy Asperys only to find out he was their biggest
costomer? lol

What GW said. 
 
The thesis is correct, the timing is wrong. Just because the princelings are slated for a
take-down doesn't mean that they'll come down soon. And the market can stay irrational
longer than you can remain solvent. 
 
It's the reason I don't short. Not because I don't want to, but because I'm not confident
enough in the information available + my reasoning to hold out for the long haul. In the
end, you have to play to your own strengths: not doing so will always be a loser's game.

John,  
 
In my opinion you aren't tying two threads of your theses on China togethor.  
 
1. Luxury goods retailers will suffer 
 
2. Chinese Kleptocracy means that the poor will suffer. 
 
The super rich in China are well above the law; most of these goods aren't purchased as
a 'store of wealth' but they are also a form of grey income... bribes... As far as I can tell
these luxury goods will continue to be in demand as long as favors needs to be paid in
China 
 
I am a little disappointed in you. Your earlier posts on shortings US listed Chinese
companies were brilliant. Well researched and not a hint of trusting an anecdote. You sent
people there to report back directly. 
 
I think if you want to invest in China you need to be there on the ground. Long or Short. 
 
The difference with your earlier positions was that you were actually shorting the US
system 
 
 
 
Lately you seem to

I think there was an assumption in your narrative that was flawed. You assumed corrupt
bureaucrats and princelings were buying watches and other glitz for themselves and
because they would not want to flaunt their wealth, they would cut down, desist ... I
believe that most of the luxury items are bought as gifts for mistresses (who can flaunt the
stuff in private before sugar daddy) or as gifts to lubricate relationships (aka bribery).  
I doubt bribery is going out of fashion very soon in China (mobile execution squad or not)

I wonder if your personal distaste for expensive watches clouds your investment
judgment. A mentor of mine liked to talk about a friend of his who passed on what
would've been a nice trade on a pizza place IPO because he tried the food and didn't like
it (this may have been Pizza Hut? I'm not sure).  
 
I've wanted to short ADBE for years because I hate Flash and Acrobat so much, but I
took that as a sign to stay away.

dear john,  
compliments for this excellent blog, which i never miss.  
i think though that your analysis of the chinese kleptocracy, is a bit obfusctaing the fact
that most people like watches and the fine skill to build complications. you might not like
watches, but most other people do...especially in Asia. I have been living in singapore for
8 years (i am swiss) and i can tell you that also affluent people (not even millionaires) love
and buy expensive watches and even have real fine collections.  
You are also forgetting that between china, indonesia, RoP, malaysia, india, thailand (etc)
you will have a lot of non-kleptocrats which will buy a Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, which
can cost as "little" as 25K USD.  
speaking about jewels, you should know that while in europe, USA and Japan 80-90
percent of the brides get a diamond ring, in china the percentage is rather 15%....so the
potential demand is enormous. and for a girl to get a diamond engagement ring, is not to
boast, its rather cultural and even normal.  
I think the mistake you made, if that you put emotions into play (you obviously are
enraged with the kleptocrats).  
I congratulate you for closing the position and the adherence to you trading discipline, as
well as the reflection over the mistake. That is why i think you are a very good HF
manager.

Adam's Myth said...


Nassim Nicholas Taleb (The Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness) argues that in a
political collapse, jewelry is a more fungible store of value than bulk gold. 
 
Unlike most investors, he argues this from direct experience, living in Beirut during the
Lebanese civil war of the 1980s. 
 
When centralized government breaks down, warlords arise naturally and take control of
basic distribution (i.e. food). Warlords' currencies are image and power, so jewelry and
weapons are of immediate use to them. 
 
Taleb discusses this near the front of one of his two popular books, but I forget which one.

Is it possible that you were right, but just a bit early? Maybe the sales have slowed
dramatically at the retail level, but the slowdown has yet to make its way back up the
distribution chain to the manufacturer. I don't know enough about the high-end watch
business to know if this is possible.

13% constant currency sales growth, Barclays say April was 20% and decelerating, if
linear then down to 5-6% by July, ie might have only fallen to single digit sales last month. 
 
Presumably their press release was designed to shut you up and stop associating them
with bullets to the head.

The sell-in does not match the sell through in China - the sell through in China according
to our sources is down substantially (due to less gifting, weaker economy, etc.). However,
the retailers had to order 6 months in advance so there is potentially a 6 month lag before
this hits. That could be what you're missing.

I think the thesis is not accurate discription of the big picture, note that despite corruption,
China is producing more and more millionars every year, 1m is not a lot of money in
eastern coast cities. They are recession proof because even if the economy slows, they
have ways to grab more money from taxpayers. Though every stock will have its turn, not
this time.

There are problems with your analysis regardless of whether the trade worked. First,
focus only on the reasons for entering the trade and not other factors with hindsight to
avoid a perception bias. Second, the original factors of arresting Bo Xilai’s wife and Hong
Kong jewelry tax revenue were hyped. The fall of Bo didn’t necessitate a fear of revolution
nor new populist legislation because Chinese politicians don’t care about voting results in
a communist state, unlike the democratic West. Also, Hong Kong jewelry tax revenue
could dip because of tax evasion, changes in purchasing habits to legally decrease tax
liability (i.e. purchase items in Japan), or a decrease in jewelry consumption. Assuming a
decrease in jewelry consumption in general does not imply any particular company will
have lower sales. For example, assume X, Y and Z Company has $5, $10, and $16 in
annual sales respectively. Now assume sales are subsequently $10, $4 and $8. The total
sales have decreased 29%, but X Company has experienced a 100% increase in sales.
At best, one should only short the sector (i.e. ETFs) unless more data become available.
Regardless, one still cannot be sure the decrease in Hong Kong jewelry tax revenue is
substantially due to lower consumption of jewelry. In gist, I would have done nothing and
looked for better odds.

Tough loss - but your willingness to be so forthright is an uncommon trait and will
hopefully make you a better investor over the long haul. 
 
It seems like a decent chunk of the impressive performance was due to CHF weakness -
which though it will likely continue is hardly the stuff of a high quality beat. 
 
Assuming the HK sales tax data was roughly accurate (as pointed out above it may not
be) it will be very interesting to see how the rest of this year and next pans out. Channel
stuffing is far from uncommon in Greater China but it is usually Chinese companies doing
the stuffing.

One commenter claimed the jewelry market is more liquid than the gold coin market. If

have to leave in a hurry, $500,000 of gold coins or bullion is very heavy. A Richemont
watch weighs nothing.

John, the logic behind the thesis may be broadly right. But to get the anticipated events to

little leverage involved requires reliance on channel checks - when Einhorn shorted

One alternative explanation of Richemonts numbers comes from the WSJ:  
 
"China's outbound tourism industry has boomed in recent years, helped in part by the
allure of luxury goods overseas." 
 
So Chinese Mainlanders go to Europe to buy the luxury stuff there.  
 
At least from my personal experience, I can confirm this. In my hometown Munich, the
luxury shops are full of Asians as well as the shops on most European airports.

large as this one the problem is harder. Lots of geographies, channels, moving parts. You
can get lots of input and still be dead wrong. It makes it worse in some regards because
as you get more input you grow more confident even though you are well below the
threshold for a strong call.  
 
If this were a technology company I could help you out more in terms of what else to do
here and if there is a latent trade to be had. Firms like Richemont are too far afield for me.

Hi John, 
 
Thank you for your great work in the blogosphere. 
 
As a Swiss resident I have been amazed by your walks through some of the companies
based here including your perfume story! 
 
In regards to Richemont, they are as all luxury good providers extremely reliant on
Chinese sales so the trends that you have spotted will certainly make their way into their
books. But really the products Richemont sells do defy gravity even though your personal
interest in them is next to null. (I will admit a small personal upset that you cant
appreciate the beauty of a Lange, but I must say the Glasshutte is an old favourite..).
After the Swatch group provided us with another record H1 in June in their watches and
jewelry section, the timing of your doom was a little puzzling. Switzerland's watch export
as you referred to is half way in 2012 slighlty exceeding 2011 record year so far (could
obviously change, but we still have not done Christmas). 
 
Also anecdotal - but in my crowd a lot of Germans are willing to spend some money on
flashy pieces so when they go off on holiday to Greece and Italy in August they can show
off not just the credit spread, but also some pretty pieces of luxury items! 
 
I am looking forward to your next analysis, but maybe a less personal take on the
products would stand a better chance. Or as with any new relationships in general -
timing is a lot more important then we would like to admit! 
 
Thanks again, 
BR

Why would you be shocked by anything other than negative development in Europe?  
 
Tod's reported 5% growth in Europe (excluding Italy in Q1). 
 
As recently as 26/07, LVMH reported 8% growth in Europe for H112.  
 
Okay the thesis for the Richemont bulls probably isn't "Europe surprises on the upside",
but all the same, if that was a part of your short thesis, you probably could have saved
yourself some headaches by having a read through the commentary from some of the
peers.

Your "mistake" was banging it to early because what you say will come through sooner
rather than later (you might have over analysed the company already ;-) ).. Already saw
one or two downgrades coming through post the update. 
 
If you really want to go short of stocks which have gone full retard as far as valuations are
concerned you should come short some South African retailers and maybe go long
Richemont against it...

Another thing, I think the retailers would rather go bust than reduce their orders and risk
losing their franchise with Richemont.

One thing: according to their statement it was actually up 13% in constant currency, which
is a fair slice lower than 16%. They've obviously benefited a lot from EUR weakness vs.
JPY and USD/HKD/CNY.  
 
Secondly, look at the HK sales data you link to: it's slowed from New Year but the Mar-
Jun average was 164 this year against 150 last year, which is a 9% increase. So we've
now only got a 4% discrepancy.  
 
In addition, Jan and Feb were two of the four highest months on record for the index, up
around 200; as some commenters have said, it's possible that Richemont's 4-month
period reflects some orders placed back then. 
 
China and HK make up 27% of Richemont's sales. Going back over the last four years,
the growth rate of that segment's sales has been 47%, 45%, 23%, 17%. It's worth noting
that this doesn't map very closely to the HK jewellery index so we can't take one as a
proxy for the other. 
 
This is a very rough estimate and ignores currency effects, but take 13% of their 8.9bn
revenue last year. That's 1.2 billion.  
 
China/HK growth only needs to match the last two years' full-year growth rate (and again,
there may be a New Year effect) to pretty much account for that on its own. You could
explain half of it by "other Asia" growing at last year's rate, or about 2/3 of the rate it saw
the previous year.  
 
Europe's been in the dirt for several years now but "other Europe" is Richemont's second-
biggest segment and grew at more than 25%pa over the past two years. Matching that
rate makes up about a third of the difference. It's not hard to get to 13% sales growth for
the global business. 
 
I'm sure they've benefited from a delayed Chinese New Year effect and I wouldn't be
surprised if we do see some slowing in the months ahead, but I think the slowdown in the
economic data wasn't as early or as dramatic as you hoped, especially given issues such
as money laundering and the dearth of mainland Chinese investment options.  
 
This is a very big business which has seen some startling growth that won't necessarily
come juddering to a halt because there's more coal piling up at Qinhuangdao. Aussie
property is overvalued too, but Beijing is still full of people pushing it as a great
investment: http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/08/beijing-notes.html

Simple. The problem was in the data. Your Hong Kong data was referring to the price
level of jewels and luxury goods in Hong Kong instead of your understanding as "tax
receipt". Hong Kong has no sales tax on luxury goods.  
 
That means your thesis could be right but you short in a wrong timing. Everyone is talking
about slowdowns in China in recent months, inventories are actually building up as far as
I know, but that doesn't lead to a disastrous H1. Wait for Q3 I guess.

I was quite surprised by your short. Living in Switzerland and having seen many parts of
the Luxury sector, I have seen that it is booming with no end in sight. 
 
HK sales data is perhaps a poor indicator. Shoppers from China are arriving here by the
bus-load and buying plenty on Swiss holiday/shopping-sprees.

to echo the above comments, right hypothesis, wrong timing. 
 
if you like anecdotes that may/may not support hard data, keep an eye on the fares of first
class flights out of HK and Shanghai to Heathrow and CDG. 
 
That'll tell you everything you need to know the Chinese 1/2%.

I read your first post last week, and now just back from Paris, read your follow up. 
Because of your first post I visited quite some places that sell luxury goods: Galeries de la
Fayette, Au Printemps, Le Bon Marché and Rue Saint Honoré. Just to have a look at
what's going on. About 80 % of the visitors were Asian and I guess about 99 % of the
buyers were Asian (I would rate Chanel as the top followed by Louis Vuitton).  
Sales of luxury goods in Europe are up, but you need to know that the main buyers are
Asians and sales to Europeans have declined. No wonder when you know that in China
prices can be 50 % higher (example Gucci in Sanya in the province Hainan). 
Prada estimates that 60 % of all sales go to the Chinese. I would worry about this
imbalance.

anyone who will quote a bob dylan song (ballad of a thin man) has my attention. I have no
idea why your thesis turned out wrong, probably the same reason Manhattan apartments
are going through the roof. All that FED/ECB money has to find a home somewhere so
why not watches and upper east side condo's. Keep up the work and the Dylan quotes.

OK, lets assume some clerk or other is saving $40 a week. Thats 2 grand a year. After 5
years, he can afford a low end luxury watch. 
 
He cant afford to go to HK to buy it - but his bosses boss can, and he is prepared to buy it

I used to cover this sector at a HF for ~2 years where we were both long and short. I think
you are just a bit early ... we saw a whopping downturn in China for a couple of quarters
post Lehman before we had a very vigorous recovery, you can see this in the swiss watch
data if you go back ... so China and high-end china are not immune. In addition, there
used to be a backlog in the very high-end stuff with a waiting list for up to 18 months so
you could have to wait 6 - 12 months to see the impact of China's slowdown. As
discussed, we also saw channel stuffing. Interestingly Tiffany just announced -5% organic
(same store) sales growth for asia pacific. Note BRBY is very vulnerable given its
valuation, high fixed costs footprint, exposure to soft luxury (very cyclical), and surely the
likelihood of a strategic acquisition (e.g. by LVMH) will have diminished until we have
clarity over the soft/hard landing situation. Swatch also has a high fixed-cost base due to
its industrial division although it does not have the retail cost-base of Richemont.
Jewellery is more cyclical than watches, and very high end is not defensive, just look at
what happened to Bulgari before it was acquired. Swatch and Richemont are great
businesses with fantastic management, and they will take share and emerge stronger but
they are like industrials : very very cyclical!
