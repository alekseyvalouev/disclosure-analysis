Affymax: Emerging Data Supports Conclusion Omontys Likely Dead
Nov. 12, 2013 10:44 AM ET24 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


After reviewing the summary adverse event report data highlighting a shocking number of
deaths associated with Omontys, (discussed here), we followed-up with the FDA to
request more information. Given the sheer volume of adverse events reported, the FDA
could only partially fulfill our request thus far. Below is a brief summary of the case
narratives that we have received. We are waiting on additional case studies and intend to
follow-up on them once we receive them. The cases below paint a very grim picture for
Omontys showing that severe adverse reactions resulting in death occurred despite
prompt medical attention, and in two cases (9238609 and 9154117), to patients receiving
second doses of Omontys. The FDA data, combined with the lack of commentary about
Omontys on Fresenius' (NYSE:FMS) or Takeda's (OTCPK:TKPHF) latest earnings calls
and the cash burn at Affymax (NASDAQ:AFFY), all lead us to believe that the end is near
for Affymax.


Case 9122574


"At 8:16 AM, the first dose of Omontys 15 mg IV was administered and 3
minutes later, at 8:19 AM, the patient complained of "burning all over" and
developed shortness of breath. He complained he could not breathe and
oxygen 10 liters/minute via nasal cannula was given…Benadryl 25 mg IV was
administered at 8:25 AM. The patient appeared cyanotic and immediately
became unresponsive…Epinephrine 1 mg x 2 were given at 8:30 AM and 8:33
AM…the patient was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital."


Case 8811085


"At 13:17, 10 mg of Omontys was administered intravenously. Two minutes
later, the patient shouted out that he was not feeling well. The patient was put
in the Trendelenburg position…The patient stated "everything is gray" and he
became unresponsive."


Case 9122561

"The patient received medications as usual including first time dose omontys.
Four minutes later the PCT noticed that his blood pressure became elevated…
The CN attempted to take the patient's blood sugar and at that time the patient
stopped breathing and cyanosis was noted around the patient's lips, no pulse
was noted."


Case 9171699

Reading between the tea leaves


On 10/31/13, Takeda held its fiscal 2Q'14 earnings call in which there was no mention of
Omontys. Omontys is not mentioned anywhere in the earnings presentation and the only
sign that it still exists is in a footnote in the data book with the following statement: "An
investigation into the root cause of the reactions was initiated and is ongoing." This is
exactly the same language Takeda used in a 6/20/13 letter to the EMA and very similar to
language that was used in February. With no update, no mention in the primary
presentation, and the same vague language about a purported investigation, it sounds like
little progress has been made.

On 11/5/13, Fresenius Medical Care hosted its 3Q earnings call in which there was no
mention of Omontys returning to market, and in fact, a significant portion of Q&A was
devoted to discussing how soon Fresenius would be able to introduce Roche's drug,
Mircera, into its U.S. dialysis centers (Mircera is a drug that is already FDA approved,
Fresenius has experience administering it in Europe, and it is a drug that has similar
dosing benefits to Omontys in that it is dosed once every two weeks without the same
negative side effects). When asked about the timing of bringing Mircera to its U.S. centers,
Fresenius' CEO said "I really can't give you much comment on that at the moment. It
would be inappropriate. But we know how we would do it. So, let me leave it at that."
Given the substantially similar dosing benefits, but lack of negative side effects, it is likely
that the introduction of Mircera in the U.S. could spell the end for the commercial viability
of Omontys in the U.S., and AFFY acknowledges as much, saying "If Mircera enters the
U.S. market, we believe it will be in direct competition with Omontys, if Takeda is able to
reintroduce the product, because of Mircera's ability to be long-acting; therefore, it could
potentially limit the market for Omontys."


Also on 11/5/13, Affymax filed its 10-Q for the period ending 9/30 making no mention of
forward progress or a timeline for resolution of the Takeda managed Omontys
investigation. Additionally, the financial statements showed SG&A expenses burned
through approximately $2mm in the quarter -- despite most restructuring actions and the
associated costs having been completed in prior periods - and a cash balance of less than
$7mm at the end of the quarter. Given the rate of cash burn, the administrative costs the
company would bear in a bankruptcy, the outstanding litigation as well as potential future
product liability claims, we believe the end is near for Affymax. Importantly, in the event
that the Omontys investigation remains ongoing, we expect Affymax to file for bankruptcy
well before it runs out of cash so that Affymax can insure it has enough cash available to
navigate bankruptcy. Accordingly, we believe a bankruptcy filing could come as soon as
January, at which time cash may be below $5 million.


We remain short AFFY with a price target of $0.44 per share, but the most likely outcome
is that the stock is worthless. Our target price is based on a probability weighted basis
whereby we assign a 90% probability to Omontys being worthless, and a 10% probability
to the upside case of $4.38 per share, implying a $0.44 expected value (assumptions
discussed in greater detail here). However, we believe that the data overwhelmingly
shows Omontys is unsafe, too many bridges have been burned (FDA, dialysis centers,
nephrologists, patients who suffered adverse reactions), and the hurdles for reintroduction
are far too high. Therefore the most likely outcome is that Omontys never comes back and
the company is worthless.

So that the best you can do?? Come on!!! your articles can't move the pps. There is a strong support over 0.88.
Please try a little harder...


PS: If the pps go under 0.70 Im ready to triple my position... So unless you can find a seller that is willing to sell over
1M shares under 0.70 I doubt you will ever see that 0.40.....

Thank you for more descriptions about those dead patients. I feel sorry for those patients. But your given description
about the patients appeared selective. Can you provide all detail treatment process after these patients started
anaphylactic shock? Thanks.

They have about 38mm shares outstanding. Based on their new agreement with Takeda the MAXIMUM they can
EVER get over the entire life of the drug is $180mm, and that would clearly be spread over perhaps 5 years. Right
now, as a skeleton company, they are burning $1.6mm/quarter. So if I get this right, people are buying this stock at $1
as a lottery ticket, if the drug gets reinstated before they currently run out of cash, on a revenue stream of a maximum
of $180mm less the costs of administering the receipt of the milestone payments? Thus the maximum upside is $180
less about $6mm/year for as long as it would take to collect that; thus about $150mm over 5 years if that is how long it
would run. They have abandoned everything else (if they had anything else of value they would have sold it.) and this
is it? So the maximum upside would be around $120mm over 5 years or about $3 IF the drug is reintroduced AND it
meets all of the milestones since they have turned over everything else to Takeda in exchange for Takeda having
picked up enough of the expenses to allow AFFY to survive for the time being. I know nothing about the drug, the
cases etc., but it is highly likely that even the $120 will ge whittled down as they are chopping up the furniture to keep
the fire warm. If they go Chapter 11 they might even sell the rights to the Takeda payment stream to others for a fixed
price that would discount the risks etc.


Having a LOT of experience in working with companies in Chapter 11, I know that IF they wind up there you can
pretty much toss away most of the money as the consultants, lawyers and the deals that are made there will usually
not be for the benefit of shareholders. Interesting situation. If they get it back on the market before they need to file
Chapter 11 a $3 stub. If not, probably 0. Good luck to the gamblers!!

The European Medicines Agency has recently published a 65 page Withdrawal Assessment Report for Omontys that,
among other criticisms, challenges the reliability of the clinical studies Takeda submitted for the European Union's
approval for marketing Omontys. It makes interesting and informed reading. For example, here are some of the
report's excerpts for the data reported in Alpha Exposure's article:


The cases were reported by different dialysis centres. One centre reported 3 SAEs, another reported 2 SAEs, and the
remaining 18 SAEs were reported each by a different dialysis centre. The 5 fatal cases were reported by 5 different
dialysis centres.


Reviewing the patient characteristics no trends could be identified. All patients had multiple (cardiovascular) co-
morbidities and co-medication, which is in line with the general dialysis population.


Based upon the reported symptoms and treatments, in the majority of the cases the clinical picture appears in line
with an acute hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis-like reaction, although in some cases the clinical picture was less clear.
Reported symptoms included hypotension, difficulties breathing, swelling of face/lip/eye/throat, itching, syncope and
loss of consciousness. The reactions occurred very shortly after Omontys administration, in most cases within 5-10
minutes. In almost all cases, Omontys was administered IV (22 cases IV and 1 case unknown). The IV doses of

Omontys given ranged from 2 mg-15 mg. Patients were initially treated in the dialysis clinics with IV antihistamines,
oxygen, fluids, adrenaline and/or IV steroid. Many patients were then transferred to the Emergency Room
(ER)/hospital. Of the 23 serious cases, in 5 cases the outcome was fatal. In another 6 cases, the case was
considered to be life-threatening.


Of note in the fatal cases is the very fast clinical course of the events. After Omontys administration reported events
included feeling unwell, “burning all over”, shortness of breath, nausea, distress and seizure-like activity. In all 5
cases, within 5-10 minutes after Omontys administration patients were unresponsive and had a cardiopulmonary
arrest. The IV Omontys doses given in the fatal cases were 3.5 mg in 1 patient, 10 mg in 1 patient and 15 mg in 3
patients.

All 10 cases were analyzed in more details. Here what was found:


1. About 5 deaths were associated with O. Death patients showed anaphylactic shock symptoms. However, the real
cause are need to be investigated as mentioned in the report from CHMP and news from Affymax. what is news?


2. All treatments for anaphylaxis right after O admin were in-appropriate. Physicians and nurses should have injected
Epi right away once patients showed the symptoms. Only Epi injection is the most effective treatment for anaphylaxis
as known in medical field. However, as I mentioned before, majority of physicians and nurses don't know much how to
deal with anaphylaxis. Most importantly there was no clear instruction in O description as well.


3. AE made misleading statements here as always. Six death cases mentioned in his article are duplicate in three
deaths based their age, gender, weight, incident date and similar descriptions. The Patient in the case 9238601 is the
same in Case 9122561. Patient in the Case 9238609 is the same in Case 9154117; The patient in the Case 9238502
is the same in the Case 9122574.


4. There is no mentioned if and how patients died after O admin in two cases, 9238605 and 9171699. Maybe death
causes are unrelated to O.

5. In the Case 9236530, the patient got an anti-anaphylactic shock agent (Benadryl) right after the symptoms
occurred even though Benadryl is much less effective than Epi. The patient survived in that incident (but died later
due to other complications). It showed that there IS a solution to solve anaphylaxis problem happened in O admin.


I don't blame AE because s/he doesn't know much about in medical field. AE just wants to short this stock desperately
with mis-represented data. It happened in AE previous three and four articles about O. However, one thing I like AE is
that AE is really digging out more new info for his short thesis. I just hope that AE would have better analyses.
Otherwise you are losing viewers in your articles.

I'm not trying to step on toes, but AFFY jumped 37% and closed up 29%. I'm very curious about the jump, but it may
be frantic short covering. The next resistance should be around $1.19 at the 200 day moving average, but hopefully
there is a new support at $1.00.

I called my broker today and they said that no shares are available to short this penny stock.


They also said that in general one cannot short a stock under $5.00 unless one is from an institutional
investor.


Am I right? Any one has the short experience? I never short a stock.

SeattleGoldMiner
Unless you have a LOT of money in an account, most brokers will not let you short "penny stocks" and if the
stock is "htb" (hard to borrow) that will add to the difficulty. You can open an account with a Canadian broker
(try Vancouver area) and if you deposit a few million they may do some naked shorting for you; however, you
will probably pay good money for the borrow.

good try. IB is also a public company.


But shorting at this price level is highly risky. One good news will make it flying. Right now biotech sector is

AFFY - stock has been in 0.80 - 2.00 range since last April. If you want to short, wait until it is pushed to $2.00. Now
at 0.98, now good to take a short position, too risky for me.
