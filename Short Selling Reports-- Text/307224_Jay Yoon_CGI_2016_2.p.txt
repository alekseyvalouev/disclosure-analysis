Celadon	Group:	SEC	Inquiries,	Accounting	Issues	And	Liquidity
Constraints	Point	To	65%	Near-Term	Downside

Summary


CGI’s	FY	2016	10-K	contains	a	number	of	major	accounting	irregularities	which	were
not	pointed	out	in	my	previous	article.


Management	appears	to	have	misled	shareholders	regarding	Quality's	lease
payment	obligations	and	reserve	liabilities.	Recent	results	also	indicate	Quality	may
have	large	amounts	of	undisclosed	truck	purchase	obligations.


The	SEC	recently	sent	CGI	a	series	of	inquiries	into	its	accounting	practices.	Given
the	increasingly	irregular	nature	of	the	Company’s	accounting	in	FY	2016,	an	SEC
investigation	appears	likely.


BKD,	CGI’s	auditor,	has	a	troubled	history	of	numerous	regulatory	violations.	The
72%	increase	in	fees	that	CGI	paid	to	BKD	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015	also	raises
concerns.


The	Company’s	performance	continues	to	deteriorate	rapidly.	Current	run-rate	cash
burn	of	almost	$100mm	and	limited	liquidity	suggest	insolvency	or	a	highly	dilutive
secondary	offering	is	on	the	horizon.


Author's	Note:	I	will	be	filing	a	formal	written	whistleblower	complaint	with	the
United	States	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	("SEC"),	including	details	from
the	article	below.


Section	1:	Executive	Summary


In	my	initial	article	on	Celadon	Group	("CGI"	or	the	"Company")	(NYSE:CGI),	I	voiced	a
number	of	concerns	regarding	the	Company's	questionable	accounting	practices	and
deteriorating	financial	performance.	Chief	among	my	concerns	was	the	fact	that	CGI
appeared	to	have	overstated	its	profits	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016	by	a	total	of	at	least
$18mm	through	the	use	of	irregular	accounting	methods.	These	methods	included	the

manipulation	of	working	capital	(i.e.	equipment	held	for	sale,	accounts	payable	&	accrued
expenses)	and	artificial	boosting	of	PP&E.	Based	on	the	various	red	flags	highlighted	in
this	article,	I	argued	that	fair	value	for	CGI	shares	was	around	$3.


Unfortunately	for	CGI	shareholders,	the	situation	at	the	Company	has	only	gotten
worse	in	the	three	months	since	my	first	article	was	released.	In	early	September,
CGI	reported	its	Q4	2016	earnings	and	filed	its	FY	2016	10-K.	The	end	of	year	results
not	only	confirmed	many	of	the	key	points	of	my	bear	thesis,	but	it	also	raised	additional
red	flags	about	CGI's	financial	reporting	and	business	practices.


Recently,	the	SEC	appears	to	have	taken	notice	of	the	Company's	questionable
financial	reporting	practices.	In	April	and	May	of	this	year,	the	SEC	sent	CGI	a	series
letters	asking	management	for	clarification	regarding	numerous	aspects	of	its	accounting
methods.	The	fact	that	CGI	appears	to	have	caught	the	attention	of	the	SEC	is	a	highly
concerning	development,	which	investors	appear	to	have	ignored.	Given	the	increasingly
irregular	nature	of	its	financial	reporting	in	FY	2016,	I	believe	an	eventual	investigation
by	the	SEC	into	CGI's	accounting	practices	is	highly	likely.


Putting	the	financial	reporting	and	SEC	concerns	aside,	CGI's	Q4	results	strongly	indicate
that	it	is	on	the	brink	of	insolvency.	At	the	moment,	the	Company	is	burning	almost
$100mm	in	FCF	on	a	run-rate	basis.	On	top	of	this,	it	has	only	a	small	amount	of	cushion
remaining	under	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.	Based	on	its	alarmingly	high	cash	burn	and
precarious	covenant	situation,	CGI	likely	does	not	have	enough	liquidity	to	sustain
itself	for	more	than	six	months.	The	expensive	$30mm	loan	that	CGI	recently	received
from	19th	Capital	further	illustrates	just	how	desperate	its	liquidity	situation	has	become.


Overall,	it	appears	that	severe	negative	events	are	on	the	horizon	for	CGI	shareholders.
These	potential	negative	events	could	include	(1)	an	SEC	investigation	into	CGI's
financial	reporting	practices,	(2)	a	large	equity	offering	to	raise	much	needed
capital,	and	(3)	a	bankruptcy	filing	due	to	covenant	violations	and	insufficient	liquidity.
Based	on	these	looming	catalysts,	I	believe	a	sharp	correction	in	CGI's	stock	price	will
likely	occur	within	the	next	six	months.


Based	on	the	numerous	additional	red	flags	that	I	have	identified,	I	believe	that	CGI	is	an
even	more	attractive	short	opportunity	today	than	it	was	when	my	first	article	was	released
in	June.	I	reiterate	my	short-term	six-month	price	target	of	$3.	Over	the	longer	term,	I
expect	the	Company	will	eventually	declare	bankruptcy	due	to	either	a	lack	of	liquidity	or
an	SEC	investigation.	Thus,	I	have	set	a	long-term	price	target	of	$0.


The	key	topics	which	will	be	discussed	in	this	article	are	as	follows:

The	recent	lack	of	management	transparency	is	troubling:	Over	the	past	three
months,	management	has	become	increasingly	less	transparent	with	shareholders	and
research	analysts.	For	example,	CGI	has	typically	reported	its	Q4	earnings	in	late
July/early	August.	However,	this	year,	the	Company	reported	its	Q4	earnings	a	month	later
than	usual.	When	CGI	finally	reported	its	Q4	earnings	on	September	1st,	management
inexplicably	decided	not	to	have	a	Q4	earnings	call.	This	appears	to	be	the	first	time	in	its
history	as	a	public	company	that	CGI	has	not	held	a	quarterly	earnings	call.
Management's	decision	to	avoid	discussing	its	Q4	results	is	troubling	given	all	of	the
questions	surrounding	its	business.


CGI	has	recently	caught	the	attention	of	the	SEC:	The	SEC	sent	a	series	of	letters	to
CGI	in	March,	April	and	June	2016	inquiring	about	its	FY	2015	10-K.	In	these	letters,	the
SEC	asked	the	Company	a	series	of	clarifying	questions	about	its	FY	2015	accounting
methods,	with	a	particular	focus	on	its	Quality	business.	The	fact	that	CGI	is	on	the	radar
of	the	SEC	is	a	concerning	development	for	shareholders.


Even	worse	is	the	fact	that	the	Company's	financial	reporting	in	FY	2016	vs.	FY	2015	has
only	become	more	questionable.	Thus,	if	the	SEC	found	its	FY	2015	reports	to	be
suspect,	then	it	will	likely	be	even	more	skeptical	about	its	FY	2016	reports.


CGI	has	seemingly	misled	shareholders	about	the	liabilities	of	its	Quality	business:
New	disclosures	reveal	that	CGI	appears	to	have	misled	in	its	SEC	filings.	In	its	FY	2015
10-K,	the	Company	stated	that	it	had	no	lease	payment	obligations	associated	with	its
Quality	business.	However,	in	its	FY	2016	10-K,	it	was	revealed	that	the	Company	paid
$31.9mm	in	lease	payment	advances	to	Element	Financial,	Quality's	third-party	financing
partner.	Also,	new	disclosures	in	the	FY	2016	10-K	(as	well	as	other	publicly	available
information	sources)	appear	to	confirm	that	CGI	has	improperly	excluded	Quality's	$74mm
of	reserve	account	liabilities	from	its	balance	sheet.


CGI's	FY	2016	financial	reports	contain	10	major	accounting	irregularities:	In	my
examination	of	the	Company's	FY	2016	financial	reports,	I	discovered	10	major
accounting	irregularities.	Four	of	these	ten	were	already	identified	in	my	previous	article,
while	the	remaining	six	are	newly	identified	accounting	discrepancies.	The	presence	of	so
many	accounting	red	flags	is	highly	unusual	and	raises	even	more	concerns	over	the
integrity	of	the	Company's	financial	reporting.	For	reasons	which	will	soon	be	explained,	it
is	also	important	to	note	that	nine	of	the	10	accounting	irregularities	I	have	identified	are
related	to	the	Quality	business.

The	continued	purchase	of	trucks	by	Quality	is	puzzling:	During	its	Q2	2016	earnings
calls,	management	communicated	that	it	would	completely	liquidate	the	Quality-related
trucks	on	its	balance	sheet	(represented	by	equipment	held	for	sale)	by	the	end	of	FY
2016.	However,	instead	of	liquidating	its	equipment	held	for	sale,	the	Company	actually
spent	net	cash	of	$48.8mm	on	the	purchase	of	equipment	held	for	sale	in	2H	2016.	The
continued	purchase	of	trucks	by	Quality	run	completely	counter	to	management's	stated
intentions	and	is	puzzling	in	the	context	of	the	current	soft	trucking	environment.


There	appears	to	be	only	a	couple	of	reasonable	explanations	for	why	equipment	held	for
sale	keeps	on	increasing.	Either	(1)	Quality	has	a	large	amount	of	truck	purchase
commitments	that	are	not	being	disclosed	to	investors	or	(2)	CGI	is	manipulating
equipment	held	for	sale	as	a	means	to	overstate	its	profits	(as	was	discussed	in	my
previous	article).	Neither	of	these	scenarios	is	very	appealing	for	shareholders.


The	quality	of	BKD's	audit	services	is	highly	questionable:	CGI's	use	of	BKD	as	its
auditor	further	adds	to	the	concerns	over	the	integrity	of	its	financial	reporting.	According
to	recent	news	articles,	BKD	has	committed	numerous	regulatory	violations	over	the	past
few	years.	In	addition	to	this,	BKD	appears	to	have	very	little	experience	in	auditing	asset-
intensive	businesses	like	CGI.	Finally,	another	concern	is	the	almost	72%	increase	in	fees
that	CGI	paid	to	BKD	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015.	According	to	recent	studies,	unusually
large	increases	in	audit	fees	are	often	predictive	of	fraud	and	accounting	restatements.
Overall,	given	these	red	flags,	it	is	hard	to	have	a	ton	of	confidence	in	the	audit	services
BKD	is	providing	to	CGI.


An	eventual	SEC	investigation	appears	highly	likely:	Given	that	most	of	the	red	flags
in	CGI's	FY	2016	financial	reports	are	related	to	its	Quality	business,	I	believe	it	is	a	matter
of	when	and	not	if	the	SEC	will	launch	a	formal	investigation	into	the	Company.	In	its
letters	to	CGI	earlier	in	the	year,	the	SEC	appeared	to	be	particularly	focused
on/concerned	about	the	accounting	treatment	of	Quality.	Thus,	the	Company's
increasingly	questionable	reporting	of	its	Quality	business	in	FY	2016	vs.	FY	2015	is	likely
to	catch	the	SEC's	attention.


Severe	cash	burn	and	limited	liquidity	suggest	bankruptcy	may	be	imminent:	Based
on	its	alarmingly	high	run-rate	cash	burn	and	limited	liquidity,	CGI	is	at	high	risk	of
declaring	bankruptcy	within	the	next	six	months.	Based	on	my	calculations,	the	Company
has	just	$9mm	of	EBITDAR	cushion	and	$36mm	of	debt	cushion	remaining	under	its
leverage	ratio	covenant.	In	addition	to	limited	covenant	cushion,	the	Company	reported	a
FCF	loss	of	$47.1mm	in	2H	2016	which	represents	a	loss	of	$94.2	on	a	run-rate	basis.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 5/35


Given	its	run-rate	cash	burn	of	almost	$100mm,	large	amount	of	liabilities	and	limited
covenant	availability,	the	Company	does	not	appear	to	have	enough	liquidity	to	sustain
itself	for	more	than	a	couple	quarters.	CGI's	seemingly	desperate	$30mm	loan	from	19th
Capital	in	Q4	2016	further	suggests	that	its	liquidity	is	seriously	constrained.


A	large	secondary	offering	will	likely	be	needed	to	avoid	bankruptcy:	In	order	to
avoid	bankruptcy,	CGI	will	likely	have	to	raise	a	large	amount	of	capital	in	a	highly	dilutive
secondary	offering.	Given	the	Company's	current	run-rate	cash	burn	of	almost	$100mm,	I
estimate	that	the	Company	will	need	to	raise	at	least	$100mm	in	a	secondary	offering.
This	would	dilute	existing	shareholders	by	over	40%.	Thus,	even	if	the	Company	is
successful	in	raising	capital,	existing	shareholders	will	likely	experience	significant	losses.


Proposed	JV	represents	a	no	win	scenario:	Some	investors	are	hoping	that	CGI's
proposed	JV	with	Element	will	enhance	its	liquidity	position.	However,	an	analysis	of	the
details	of	the	MOU	reveal	that	the	proposed	JV	appears	to	have	little	chance	of	being
consummated.	For	starters,	an	MOU	represents	a	non-binding	contract.	Thus,	a
significant	number	of	steps	need	to	be	taken	before	a	formal	agreement	is	signed.	More
importantly,	in	order	to	consummate	the	JV,	Element's	existing	debt	holders	will	have	to
agree	to	roll	into	the	JV.	Given	the	non-recourse	nature	of	the	JV,	it	appears	unlikely	that
these	debt	holders	will	agree	to	this.


Even	if	the	JV	is	somehow	consummated,	this	will	likely	result	in	a	$95mm	write-down	for
CGI.	Such	a	large	write-down	will	significantly	pressure	the	Company's	already	weak
financial	position.	Therefore,	the	proposed	JV	appears	to	be	a	"heads"	it	loses,	"tails"	it	still
loses	type	of	scenario.


Recent	safety	violations	could	further	pressure	CGI's	financial	results:	In	its	FY	2016
10-K,	CGI	included	a	troubling	disclosure	that	it	had	violated	thresholds	in	"a	number	of"
CSA	safety-related	categories.	As	a	result	of	these	safety	violations,	CGI	stated	that	it
may	receive	a	DOT	safety	rating	downgrade.	The	Company	warned	that	such	a
downgrade	could	result	in	a	loss	of	clients.	Also,	to	fix	its	safety	issues,	CGI	will	likely	have
to	hire	a	greater	proportion	of	more	experienced	(and	in	turn	more	expensive)	drivers.	A
loss	of	clients	and	a	more	expensive	workforce	could	greatly	pressure	the	Company's
already	weak	financial	position.


Section	2:	Where	There	is	Smoke…


It	is	often	said	that	where	there	is	smoke,	there	is	fire.	In	the	case	of	CGI,	there	is	a	whole
lot	of	"smoke."	Despite	increasing	signs	which	indicate	severe	trouble	is	ahead	for
the	Company,	investors	have	bid	CGI's	stock	price	up	10%	since	Q4	2016	earnings

were	released	from	$7.86	(as	of	Sept	1st)	to	$8.66	(as	of	Oct	10th).	The	reaction	of
investors	to	the	Company's	mounting	issues	and	red	flags	reminds	me	of	this:


I	understand	that	some	of	the	accounting	issues	which	I	highlighted	in	my	previous	article
(as	well	as	later	in	this	article)	can	be	somewhat	difficult	for	the	average	and	even
seasoned	investor	to	grasp.	However,	what	I	do	not	understand	is	the	apathy	of	investors
towards	other	more	obvious	signs	of	trouble.


For	example,	the	recent	lack	of	transparency	by	management	should	concern
investors	a	great	deal.	The	Company	reported	its	Q4	2016	earnings	on	September	1st,
which	is	over	a	month	later	than	when	it	typically	provides	its	Q4	report.	In	addition	to
reporting	its	earnings	over	a	month	late,	management	for	some	unexplained	reason
decided	not	to	conduct	an	earnings	call	to	discuss	its	Q4	results.	This	appears	to	be	the
first	time	in	its	history	as	a	public	company	that	CGI	has	not	held	a	quarterly	earnings	call.
Given	all	of	the	questions	surrounding	the	Company's	financial	reporting	and	business
practices,	this	recent	lack	of	transparency	by	management	should	have	investors	highly
concerned.


Another	fairly	obvious	red	flag	is	the	fact	the	SEC	has	recently	taken	interest	in	the
Company's	accounting	practices.	As	I	will	discuss	in	more	detail	in	the	next	section,
earlier	this	year,	the	SEC	asked	the	Company	a	number	of	questions	regarding	its
accounting	methods.	The	fact	that	CGI's	accounting	practices	are	under	the	scrutiny	of	the
SEC	is	a	troubling	development.	However,	once	again,	investors	appear	to	have	largely
shrugged	this	off.


The	purpose	of	this	section	is	to	serve	as	a	sort	of	wake-up	call	for	investors	to	stop
ignoring	obvious	warning	signs.	The	recent	lack	of	management	transparency	and
SEC	inquiries	are	strong	indications	that	something	may	be	seriously	wrong	with

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 7/35


CGI's	financial	reporting	methods.	However,	to	this	point,	the	market	seems	to	have
mostly	ignored	them.	As	past	market	history	has	repeatedly	shown,	ignoring	obvious
warning	signs	can	be	a	recipe	for	disaster.	Thus,	I	would	encourage	investors	to	take	a
more	critical	approach	in	analyzing	CGI's	accounting	methods	and	business	practices.


With	that	out	of	the	way,	I	can	now	move	onto	the	rest	of	my	analysis.


Section	3:	CGI	Has	Caught	the	Attention	of	the	SEC


As	discussed	in	my	previous	article	on	CGI,	I	believe	the	Company	has	significantly
overstated	its	profits	through	the	utilization	of	improper	accounting	methods.	Unfortunately
for	CGI	investors,	it	appears	that	the	SEC	has	recently	taken	notice	of	the	Company's
questionable	accounting	practices	as	well.


On	March	10th,	2016,	the	SEC	sent	a	letter	to	CGI	with	a	series	of	detailed	questions
regarding	the	Company's	FY	2015	10-K	(found	here).	In	this	letter,	the	SEC	asked
management	to	clarify	various	aspects	of	its	accounting.	The	SEC	appeared	to	be
particularly	interested	in/confused	by	the	Company's	rather	opaque	accounting	treatment
of	its	Quality	business.


On	April	8th,	CGI	sent	a	response	to	the	SEC's	initial	letter	(found	here).	Apparently,	the
SEC	did	not	find	this	response	to	be	sufficient	as	the	regulatory	agency	promptly	sent
another	detailed	batch	of	questions	to	CGI	on	April	25th	(found	here).	Once	again,	these
questions	were	mostly	focused	on	the	Company's	unusual	accounting	treatment	of	its
Quality	business.


After	receiving	a	second	response	from	the	Company	on	May	25th,	the	SEC	replied	with	a
standard	boilerplate	letter	stating	that	it	had	completed	its	review	of	the	FY	2015	10-K.


Some	investors	may	believe	that,	by	stating	it	had	completed	its	review	of	the	10-K,	the
SEC	has	given	CGI	the	"all-clear"	in	regards	to	its	accounting	methods.	However,	this	is
simply	not	the	case.	For	starters,	consider	the	following	quote	from	the	SEC's	final	letter	to
the	Company:


"We	have	completed	our	review	of	your	filing.	We	remind	you	that	our	comments
or	changes	to	disclosure	in	response	to	our	comments	do	not	foreclose	the
Commission	from	taking	any	action	with	respect	to	the	company	or	the
filing…"

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 8/35


As	highlighted	above,	the	SEC	explicitly	states	that	a	completion	of	its	review	does
not	mean	that	it	will	not	or	cannot	take	action	against	CGI.


Past	cases	that	the	SEC	has	brought	against	certain	companies	also	confirm	this.	For
example,	in	2012,	the	SEC	sent	a	number	of	letters	to	MDC	Partners	(NASDAQ:MDCA)
inquiring	about	MDC's	accounting	practices.	Eventually,	the	SEC	sent	a	final	letter	to	MDC
stating	the	following:


"We	have	completed	our	review	of	your	filing.	We	remind	you	that	our	comments	or
changes	to	disclosure	in	response	to	our	comments	do	not	foreclose	the
Commission	from	taking	any	action	with	respect	to	the	company	or	its	filing…"


As	can	be	seen	from	the	quote	above,	the	final	letter	that	MDC	received	was	practically
identical	to	the	most	recent	letter	that	the	SEC	sent	to	CGI.	Like	some	CGI	investors
today,	some	MDC	investors	may	have	viewed	this	letter	as	reassurance	that	the	SEC
would	not	take	action	against	the	company.	However,	this	would	prove	to	be	a	misguided
conclusion	as	the	SEC	eventually	announced	it	was	opening	a	formal	investigation	into
MDC's	accounting	practices.


Thus,	given	its	continued	questionable	accounting	practices,	it	appears	that	CGI	is	at	high
risk	of	landing	on	the	SEC's	radar	for	an	investigation.	As	I	will	explain	in	the	sections	to
follow,	CGI's	accounting	practices	and	disclosures	to	investors	in	FY	2016	have	only
gotten	more	questionable	in	comparison	to	FY	2015.	If	the	SEC	found	CGI's	FY	2015
financial	reports	to	be	suspicious,	it	will	likely	find	its	FY	2016	financial	reports	to
be	highly	suspect.	Given	this	fact,	the	odds	of	a	formal	investigation	into	CGI's	financial
reporting	practices	appears	highly	likely.


Section	4:	A	Quick	Refresher	on	the	Quality	Business


I	have	provided	below	a	quick	summary	of	CGI's	Quality	business.	Given	that	a	good
portion	of	my	article	will	be	spent	discussing	this	segment,	I	think	readers	will	find	this	brief
summary	of	Quality	to	be	helpful.


Through	its	Quality	division,	CGI	provides	leasing	management	services	to	independent
contractors,	motor	carrier	fleets	and	financing	sources.	In	addition	to	leasing	management,
the	Quality	business	also	buys	trucks	in	bulk,	leases	them	and	then	sells	the	leased	trucks
for	a	profit.	The	equipment	that	Quality	purchases	is	separated	into	three	separate

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 9/35


buckets	in	CGI's	balance	sheet:	(1)	leased	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale,	(2)	revenue
equipment	held	for	sale	and	(3)	leased	assets.	On	a	combined	basis,	these	categories	can
all	be	referred	to	as	equipment	held	for	sale.


Since	2014,	Quality	has	sold	the	vast	majority	its	equipment	held	for	sale	to	two	main	third
party	financing	providers:	Element	Financial	and	19th	Capital.	In	total,	over	a	period	of
around	two	years,	Element	and	19th	Capital	have	purchased	$623mm	and	$49mm	worth
of	leased	trucks,	respectively,	from	Quality.	It	should	also	be	noted	that	19th	Capital	is	a
JV	between	CGI	and	Larsen	MacColl	Partners	in	which	CGI	owns	a	33%	minority	stake.


Section	5:	FY	2016	10-K	Indicates	Management	Has	Seemingly	Misrepresented
Quality's	Lease	Payment	Obligations


While	performing	additional	diligence	on	CGI,	I	was	troubled	to	discover	that
management	appears	to	have	misrepresented	Quality's	lease	payment	obligations
in	its	FY	2015	10-K.	On	pg.	16	of	CGI's	FY	2015	10-K,	the	following	information	was
provided	regarding	the	Quality	business:


"We	are	not	obligated	to	make	payments	in	respect	of	the	leases	or	financing
provided	by	Element	to	the	independent	contractors."


In	the	above	disclosure,	the	Company	clearly	states	that	it	has	no	obligation	to	make	lease
payments	for	any	of	the	trucks	sold	by	Quality.	However,	just	one	year	later,	CGI	deleted
this	disclosure	from	its	FY	2016	10-K.	In	addition	to	this,	the	Company	disclosed	the
following	new	information	on	pg.	24	of	its	FY	2016	10-K:


"…we	are	generally	obligated	to	advance	to	our	third	party	financing	provider	any
shortfall	between	the	required	lease	payments	and	the	maintenance	advances	and
amounts	actually	collected..."


"We	refer	to	these	advances	herein	as	"Lease	Shortfall	Advances""


"The	Lease	Shortfall	Advances…initially	were	subject	to	satisfaction	from	a	reserve
fund	that	amounted	to	approximately	$74	million.	This	fund	has	been	exhausted…
We	are	required	to	fund	the	Lease	Shortfall	Advances	directly	after	the	fund	is
exhausted.	As	of	June	30,	2016,	we	have	advanced	approximately	$31.9	million
to	our	third	party	financing	provider"

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 10/35


Under	its	agreements	with	Element,	CGI	is	responsible	for	the	collection	and	remittance	of
lease	payments	received	from	independent	contractors	who	are	driving	the	trucks	sold	by
Quality.	As	highlighted	above,	if	there	is	any	shortfall	between	the	required	lease	payment
and	the	actual	amount	received,	CGI	is	obligated	to	makeup	this	difference.	In	FY	2016,
the	Company	made	a	total	of	$31.9mm	in	lease	payment	advances	to	Element.


Thus,	these	new	disclosures	in	CGI's	FY	2016	10-K	indicate	that	management	misled
shareholders	in	its	FY	2015	10-K	about	Quality's	lease	payment	obligations.


Section	6:	Management	Has	Also	Hidden	Quality's	Reserve	Account	Liabilities	From
Investors


In	addition	to	seemingly	misleading	comments	about	its	lease	payment	obligations,
management	continues	to	mislead	investors	regarding	the	reserve	account	liabilities	of	the
Quality	business.	In	my	previous	article,	I	claimed	that	the	Company	had	significant
reserve	account	liabilities	that	it	was	not	properly	disclosing	to	investors.	Recently,	I	have
uncovered	additional	evidence	which	further	supports	this	claim.


In	my	previous	article,	I	stated	that	CGI	was	liable	for	covering	up	to	10%	of	any	losses
incurred	by	Element	and	19th	Capital	from	their	truck	purchases	from	Quality.	This	10%
reserve	account	liability	is	clearly	spelled	out	in	CGI	/	Quality's	reserve	account	agreement
with	its	third	party	financing	providers.


The	below	disclosure	is	from	pg.	2	of	CGI	/	Quality's	reserve	account	agreement	with
Element.	A	similar	disclosure	is	also	provided	in	CGI/Quality's	reserve	account	agreement
with	19th	Capital.


"Seller	has	established	a	loss	pool	or	reserve	account	on	Seller's	balance	sheet	in
the	initial	amount	of	ten	percent	(10%)	of	the	Purchase	Price…	the	Reserve	Account
is	created	pursuant	to	this	Third	Amended	Agreement	to	establish	and	determine
Seller's	recourse	liability	to	Element	for	Element's	credit	and	asset	losses	under	the
Purchase	Agreement"


Based	on	the	above	disclosure,	there	should	be	no	question	that	CGI	is	directly
responsible	for	paying	the	reserve	account	liability.	Recently,	I	discovered	a	presentation
made	by	Element	which	further	confirms	this	fact.	The	following	snapshot	is	from	pg.	10	of
Element's	presentation:

7/18/2019 Celadon Group: SEC Inquiries, Accounting Issues And Liquidity Constraints Point To 65% Near-Term Downside - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 11/35


Due	to	the	recent	sharp	decline	in	truck	resale	values	and	utilization,	I	estimated	in	my
previous	article	that	Element	and	19th	Capital	had	both	exceeded	the	10%	loss	threshold.
As	a	result,	as	of	Q3	2016,	I	estimated	that	CGI	had	~$67mm	of	reserve	account	liabilities
(10%	loss	threshold	*	$672.7mm	combined	truck	sales	to	Element	&	19th	Capital).	Based
on	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	24	of	CGI's	FY	2016	10-K,	it	appears	that	this
estimate	was	fairly	accurate:


"The	Lease	Shortfall	Advances…initially	were	subject	to	satisfaction	from	a	reserve
fund	that	amounted	to	approximately	$74	million.	This	fund	has	been
exhausted…	We	are	required	to	fund	the	Lease	Shortfall	Advances	directly	after	the
fund	is	exhausted.	As	of	June	30,	2016,	we	have	advanced	approximately	$31.9
million	to	our	third	party	financing	provider"


As	of	Q4	2016,	the	total	amount	of	CGI's	reserve	account	liability	was	$74mm,	which	is
just	$7mm	more	than	my	previous	estimate	of	$67mm.	From	the	above	information,	it	can
also	be	concluded	that	the	total	amount	of	losses	Element	and	19th	Capital	have	incurred
is	$105.9mm	as	of	Q4	2016	($74mm	of	reserve	account	liabilities	+	$31.9mm	of	lease
payment	advances).	In	other	words,	to	date,	their	total	losses	exceed	the	$74mm	or	10%
loss	threshold	by	$31.9mm.


Given	the	fact	that	Element	and	19th	Capital's	current	losses	far	exceed	10%,	barring	a
sharp	recovery	in	the	trucking	market,	it	is	likely	that	the	entire	amount	of	CGI's	reserve
account	will	have	to	be	paid	out.	Thus,	it	appears	CGI	should	have	included	$74mm	of
reserve	account	liabilities	on	its	Q4	2016	balance	sheet.	Yet,	for	some	reason,
management	chose	not	to	do	this.


I	have	tried	to	think	of	a	good	reason	for	why	management	is	not	including	any	reserve
account	liabilities	in	its	balance	sheet.	I	thought	that	maybe	the	Company	had	pre-funded
its	reserve	account	or	was	funding	its	reserve	account	with	cash	on	an	ongoing	basis.
However,	according	to	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	2	of	its	reserve	account
agreement	with	Element,	this	is	not	the	case:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 12/35


"Seller	is	not	required	to	set	aside	or	segregate	any	funds	or	other	assets,	including,
without	limitation	any	portion	of	the	Purchase	Price,	to	pre-fund	or	otherwise	secure
the	Reserve	Account."


CGI	is	required	to	keep	an	accounting	entry	on	its	books	reflecting	the	amount	of	its
reserve	account	balance,	but	is	not	required	to	pre-fund	the	reserve	account	with	cash	or
assets.	The	Company	only	has	to	pay	out	cash	when	the	reserve	account	liability	comes
due	several	years	later.	Given	this	fact,	it	appears	that	CGI	has	not	yet	set	aside	any
cash	to	fund	its	reserve	account.


Thus,	based	on	overwhelming	evidence,	it	appears	management	has	significantly
misrepresented	CGI's	liabilities	by	excluding	$74mm	of	reserve	account	liabilities	from	the
balance	sheet.


Section	7:	CGI's	FY	2016	Financial	Reports	Contain	an	Alarming	Number	of
Accounting	Discrepancies


In	my	previous	article	on	CGI,	I	highlighted	a	number	of	troubling	accounting
discrepancies	in	its	FY	2016	financial	reports.	In	the	approximately	three	months	since
that	article	was	released,	I	have	uncovered	a	number	of	additional	accounting	red	flags
which	further	call	into	question	the	accuracy	of	the	Company's	FY	2016	financials.	Most	of
these	additional	irregularities	were	discovered	in	the	Company's	recent	FY	2016	10-K
filing,	while	the	remaining	were	discovered	through	a	more	thorough	examination	of	past
filings.


Based	on	the	alarming	number	of	accounting	discrepancies	which	I	have
uncovered,	I	believe	that	CGI's	financial	reports	simply	cannot	be	trusted.


Provided	below	is	a	comprehensive	list	of	the	numerous	accounting	irregularities	in	CGI's
FY	2016	financial	reports.	By	providing	this	comprehensive	list	of	red	flags,	I	believe
readers	will	gain	a	better	appreciation	of	just	how	questionable	the	Company's	accounting
practices	truly	are.


To	start	off	this	list,	I	have	provided	below	the	accounting	discrepancies	which	were
highlighted	in	my	previous	article	on	CGI:


Accounting	Red	Flag	#1:	Changes	in	Equipment	Held	For	Sale	on	Balance	Sheet	Do
Not	Match	Changes	in	CF	Statement
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: SEC Inquiries, Accounting Issues And Liquidity Constraints Point To 65% Near-Term Downside - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 13/35


In	general,	changes	in	working	capital	(like	equipment	held	for	sale)	on	the	balance	sheet
should	generally	match	the	changes	reflected	in	the	cash	flow	statement.	However,	in
both	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	the	change	in	equipment	held	for	sale	on	CGI's	balance
sheet	was	vastly	different	from	the	change	reflected	in	its	cash	flow	statement.


In	Q2	2016,	the	absolute	difference	was	$16.7mm,	while	in	Q3	2016	it	was	$31.9mm	(as
shown	below).	Such	a	large	mismatch	is	highly	unusual	and	is	indicative	of	accounting
irregularities.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#2:	Changes	in	Accounts	Payable	and	Accrued	Expenses	on
Balance	Sheet	Do	Not	Match	Changes	in	CF	Statement


The	unusual	discrepancies	in	CGI's	working	capital	do	not	end	with	equipment	held	for
sale.	As	shown	in	the	figure	below,	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	the	changes	in	accounts
payable	and	accrued	expenses	on	the	balance	sheet	versus	the	cash	flow
statement	also	differed	by	a	large	amount.	In	Q2	2016,	the	absolute	difference	was
$21.4mm,	while	in	Q3	2016,	it	was	$13.9mm.	Once	again,	this	is	highly	unusual.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#3:	Irregularities	in	Q2	2016	PP&E	Cash	Flow	Accounting


CGI's	reported	Q2	2016	cash	flow	from	the	purchase	and	sale	of	PP&E	simply	does	not
make	any	sense.	Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of	CGI's	cash	flow	from	investing
activities	in	Q1	2016	versus	YTD	Q2	2016:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 14/35


As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	CGI	actually	reported	negative	PP&E	sale	proceeds
of	$7.6mm	in	Q2	2016.	This	is	highly	irregular.	Also	peculiar	was	the	fact	that	the
Company	reported	a	small	amount	($0.3mm)	of	positive	cash	flow	from	the	purchase	of
PP&E.	Overall,	the	Company's	PP&E	accounting	in	Q2	2016	was	completely
reversed	where	PP&E	proceeds	were	a	cash	drain	while	PP&E	purchases	were	a
cash	inflow.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#4:	Q3	2016	PP&E	Balance	Appears	to	Have	Been	Inflated


The	change	in	CGI's	PP&E	from	Q2	2016	to	Q3	2016	does	not	match	what	is	implied	by
its	capex,	asset	sales	and	depreciation.	This	is	clearly	illustrated	by	the	below	analysis:


As	shown	above,	based	on	its	depreciation,	capex	and	proceeds	from	asset	sales	in	Q3
2016,	I	calculate	that	CGI	should	have	reported	a	PP&E	balance	of	$722.5mm.
Surprisingly,	the	Company's	actual	reported	Q3	2016	PP&E	balance	was	over	$22mm
greater	at	$744.8mm.	I	am	puzzled	as	to	why	such	a	large	disconnect	exists	between	its
actual	and	implied	PP&E	balance.


But	wait…there's	more!	Provided	below	are	the	numerous	additional	accounting	red	flags
that	I	have	uncovered	since	my	first	article	on	CGI	was	published:


Accounting	Red	Flag	#5:	Change	in	Equipment	Held	For	Sale	on	the	Balance	Sheet
Yet	Again	Did	Not	Match	the	CF	Statement	in	Q4	2016


As	was	the	case	in	Q2	2016	and	Q3	2016,	in	Q4	2016,	the	change	in	equipment	held	for
sale	on	CGI's	balance	sheet	was	significantly	different	from	what	was	reflected	in	its	cash
flow	statement:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 15/35


As	shown	above,	in	Q4	2016,	the	change	in	equipment	held	for	sale	on	the	balance
sheet	was	$21.9mm	higher	than	the	change	reflected	in	the	cash	flow	statement.	I
am	puzzled	as	to	why	such	a	large	and	consistent	discrepancy	in	CGI's	equipment	held
for	sale	accounting	exists.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#6:	Change	in	Other	Assets	on	the	Balance	Sheet	Do	Not
Match	the	CF	Statement


In	FY	2016,	the	change	in	CGI's	other	assets	on	its	balance	sheet	did	not	match	its
cash	flow	statement	from	quarter	to	quarter.	This	consistent	mismatch	is	illustrated	in
the	figure	below:


As	shown	above,	in	FY	2016,	the	difference	in	change	in	other	assets	between	the
balance	sheet	and	cash	flow	statement	was	$3.0mm	in	Q1,	$3.2mm	in	Q2,	$0.9mm	in	Q3
and	$4.1mm	in	Q4.	Although	this	difference	may	not	seem	like	a	lot	initially,	it	is	important
to	note	the	relatively	small	size	of	the	Company's	other	assets	account.


For	example,	other	assets	on	CGI's	balance	sheet	amounted	to	just	$11.5mm	at	the	end
of	Q1	2016.	Thus,	the	$3.0mm	difference	calculated	in	the	figure	above	represented	a
very	high	percentage	(~27%)	of	its	other	assets	balance.	As	another	example,	in	Q2	2016,
the	difference	of	$3.2mm	calculated	in	the	above	figure	represented	~27%	of	its	other
assets	balance	of	$12.0mm	at	the	end	of	the	quarter.


Overall,	this	is	yet	another	example	of	CGI's	questionable	working	capital	accounting
methods.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#7:	Mismatch	in	Equipment	Sale	Proceeds	Disclosed	in	Q3
2016	10-Q	vs.	FY	2016	10-K
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: SEC Inquiries, Accounting Issues And Liquidity Constraints Point To 65% Near-Term Downside - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 16/35


On	pg.	67	of	its	FY	2016	10-K,	CGI	disclosed	the	following	in	regards	to	the	amount	of	net
proceeds	it	received	from	equipment	sales	in	FY	2016:


"Total	net	proceeds	and	net	gain	as	a	result	of	these	transactions	during	the	year
ended	June	30,	2016	was	$328.6	million	and	$22.4	million,	respectively…"


By	comparison,	on	pg.	13	of	its	Q3	2016	10-Q,	the	Company	disclosed	the	following
regarding	its	YTD	equipment	sale	proceeds:


"Total	net	proceeds	of	units	during	the	three	and	nine	months	ended	March	31,
2016	was	$30.4	million	and$318.6	million,	respectively."


By	subtracting	$318.6mm	of	YTD	Q3	proceeds	from	$328.6mm	of	FY	2016	proceeds,	it
can	be	calculated	that	CGI's	proceeds	from	equipment	sales	in	Q4	2016	should	have
been	$10.0mm.	However,	additional	disclosures	in	the	Company's	FY	2016	10-K	reveal
that	this	was	not	the	case.


In	Note	17	or	pg.	67	of	the	10-K,	the	following	is	disclosed	regarding	proceeds	received
from	19th	Capital	in	Q4	2016:


"…19th	Capital	purchased	portfolios	of	Quality's	independent	contractor	leases	and
associated	assets…	we	received	$30.0	million	in	net	proceeds	from	the	disposition
of	leased	equipment,	with	a	book	value	of	approximately	$37.7	million."


In	Q4	2016,	19th	Capital	essentially	provided	a	$30.0mm	loan	to	CGI	which	was	secured
by	$37.7mm	of	equipment	on	the	Company's	balance	sheet.	With	this	in	mind,	consider
the	following	disclosure	from	Note	18	(pg.	67)	of	the	10-K:


"Total	net	proceeds	and	net	gains	are	inclusive	of	the	amounts	recorded	from	19th
Capital	as	mentioned	in	note	17"


As	highlighted	in	the	quote	above,	the	$328.6mm	of	net	proceeds	reported	in	FY	2016
included	the	$30.0mm	of	loan	proceeds	received	from	19th	Capital	as	mentioned	in	Note
17.


Based	on	these	disclosures,	CGI	should	have	reported	$348.6mm	of	total	equipment
sale	proceeds	in	FY	2016	($30.0mm	of	Q4	2016	loan	proceeds	+	$318.6mm	of	YTD	Q3
2016	proceeds).	Yet,	for	some	reason,	the	Company's	reported	proceeds	from

accounting	in	more	detail:


"Included	in	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities	is	the	change	in	leased	and
revenue	equipment	held	for	sale.	The	change	in	the	account	is	made	up	of	the	net
purchases	and	sales	of	equipment	purchased	only	for	the	benefit	of	our	equipment
leasing	and	services	segment."


"The	purchases	and	sales	of	used	Celadon	fleet	equipment	are	included	within	the
net	cash	provided	by	investing	activities	(i.e.	purchase	of	PP&E	and	proceeds	from
sale	of	PP&E)."	[italics	mine]


In	the	first	quote	provided	above,	CGI	states	that	its	equipment	held	for	sale	represents
equipment	that	the	Company	has	purchased	through	its	equipment	leasing	and	services
segment,	aka	its	Quality	business.	Based	on	the	second	quote	above,	it	can	be	concluded
that	PP&E	should	represent	equipment	that	CGI	uses	in	its	own	fleet	(used	Celadon	fleet).


To	summarize,	based	on	the	above	disclosures:


Equipment	held	for	sale	=	Quality	equipment,	and	PP&E	=	equipment	used	in	CGI's	fleet


However,	on	pg.	52	of	its	FY	2016	10-K,	CGI	contradicts	itself	by	stating	the	following:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 18/35


"The	majority	of	the	assets	included	in	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	were
acquired	to	be	resold	and	those	assets	have	been	recorded	at	cost.	As	of	June	30,
2016,	33%	of	the	units	held	for	sale	was	comprised	of	old	Celadon	fleet	equipment
no	longer	in	service	versus	newly	purchased	equipment."


For	comparison	purposes,	I	have	once	again	provided	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	38
of	the	10-K:


"Included	in	net	cash	provided	by	operating	activities	is	the	change	in	leased	and
revenue	equipment	held	for	sale.	The	change	in	the	account	is	made	up	of	the	net
purchases	and	sales	of	equipment	purchased	only	for	the	benefit	of	our	equipment
leasing	and	services	segment."


By	comparing	the	above	two	quotes,	it	is	clear	that	CGI	has	provided	contradictory
information	to	shareholders.	On	pg.	52	of	its	10-K,	the	Company	states	that	33%	of	its
revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	is	comprised	of	equipment	used	in	CGI's	fleet.
However,	just	a	few	pages	earlier,	CGI	had	clearly	stated	that	equipment	held	for
sale	was	comprised	only	of	equipment	purchased	by	its	Quality	business.	This	odd
discrepancy	further	calls	into	question	the	accuracy	of	its	equipment	held	for	sale	and
PP&E	accounting.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#9:	The	Manner	in	which	Equipment	Held	For	Sale	is	Reported
Keeps	Changing


Another	point	of	concern	is	the	frequent	changes	CGI	has	made	to	its	reporting	of
equipment	held	for	sale.


For	example,	in	Q2	2016,	CGI	made	a	significant	change	to	the	manner	in	which	it	reports
equipment	held	for	sale	on	the	balance	sheet.	Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of
equipment	held	for	sale	as	reported	in	Q1	2016	vs.	Q2	2016:


In	Q1	2016,	CGI	included	all	of	its	equipment	held	for	sale	in	a	single	line	item	on	the
balance	sheet.	This	changed	in	Q2	2016,	as	the	Company	expanded	the	reporting	of
its	equipment	held	for	sale	into	two	categories:	leased	revenue	equipment	held	for
sale	and	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 19/35


Just	a	couple	quarters	later,	in	Q4	2016,	CGI	once	again	changed	its	equipment	held	for
sale	reporting.	Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of	equipment	held	for	sale	as	reported	in
Q3	2016	vs.	Q4	2016:


In	Q4	2016,	CGI	once	again	expanded	the	reporting	of	its	equipment	held	for	sale
from	two	to	three	categories.	The	Company	did	this	by	adding	a	third	category	in	non-
current	assets	called	leased	assets.


By	itself,	CGI's	frequent	changing	of	its	equipment	held	for	sale	reporting	may	not	be	all
that	concerning.	However,	I	believe	the	Company	is	changing	its	equipment	held	for
sale	reporting	in	order	to	help	hide	certain	red	flags	from	investors.


For	example,	as	was	highlighted	as	"Accounting	Red	Flag	#1"	and	"Accounting	Red	Flag
#5",	the	change	in	equipment	held	for	sale	in	Q2	2016,	Q3	2016	and	Q4	2016	was
significantly	different	between	the	balance	sheet	and	cash	flow	statement.	I	believe	one	of
the	primary	reasons	the	Company	added	a	second	and	then	third	category	to	equipment
held	for	sale	was	to	make	this	discrepancy	less	obvious.


Also,	as	will	be	discussed	in	more	detail	in	the	next	section,	CGI's	equipment	held	for	sale
balance	increased	significantly	in	2H	2016.	This	is	in	direct	contradiction	to	management's
previous	statements	that	it	would	offload	all	of	the	equipment	held	for	sale	on	its	balance
sheet	by	the	end	of	the	year.	Thus,	I	believe	the	Company	is	changing	its	equipment	held
for	sale	reporting	to	help	hide	this	fact.


Accounting	Red	Flag	#10:	Aggressive	Capitalization	of	Quality's	Lease	Payment
Advances	in	Other	Assets


Rather	than	expensing	lease	payment	advances	in	its	P&L,	CGI	has	capitalized	these
payments	on	its	balance	sheet	in	other	assets.	By	doing	so,	I	believe	that	the	Company
has	inflated	its	FY	2016	profits	by	an	additional	$31.9mm.


Provided	below	is	a	comparison	of	other	assets	on	CGI's	balance	sheet	as	of	Q4	2015
and	Q4	2016:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 20/35


I	believe	Quality's	$31.9mm	of	lease	payment	advances	in	FY	2016	should	have	been
expensed	in	the	P&L	rather	than	capitalized.	The	Company	justified	capitalizing	these
lease	payments	because	it	argued	that	Element	would	eventually	reimburse	them	for
these	payments.	However,	as	I	demonstrated	earlier,	the	Company	appears	to	have
$74mm	of	reserve	account	liabilities	(most	of	which	is	owed	to	Element).	Thus,	CGI's
$31.9mm	of	lease	advance	payments	will	likely	be	kept	by	Element	as	partial	payment	for
its	reserve	account	liabilities.


Section	8:	The	Continued	Purchase	of	Trucks	by	Quality	Makes	No	Sense


As	I	have	illustrated,	Quality's	lease	payment	obligations	and	reserve	liabilities	have
greatly	pressured	CGI's	already	overleveraged	financial	position.	However,	despite	its
overleveraged	position	and	continued	softness	in	the	trucking	market,	the	Company	keeps
on	purchasing	trucks	through	its	Quality	business.


The	fact	that	CGI	has	not	halted	its	purchases	of	trucks	makes	no	logical	sense.
Why	would	an	already	capital	constrained	business	willingly	burn	cash	by	purchasing
trucks	in	such	a	soft	market?	The	Company's	actions	are	especially	puzzling	given	that
management	stated	the	following	in	its	Q2	2016	earnings	call:


"Leased	assets	and	assets	held	for	resale	represented	approximately	$130	million	in
this	December	quarter…	We	expect	to	dispose	of	this	equipment	over	the	next
six	months."


As	a	reminder,	equipment	held	for	sale	(referred	to	as	leased	assets	and	assets	held	for
resale	in	the	above	quote)	represents	trucks	purchased	by	CGI's	Quality	business.	In	the
above	quote,	management	clearly	stated	that	it	would	liquidate	all	of	the	equipment
held	for	sale	on	its	balance	sheet	over	the	next	six	months	(end	of	Q4	2016).
However,	as	I	will	soon	illustrate,	the	Company	actually	spent	a	significant	amount	of	cash
on	equipment	held	for	sale	in	2H	2016.


First,	I	have	provided	below	CGI's	YTD	Q2	2016	operating	cash	flow	statement:

7/18/2019 Celadon Group: SEC Inquiries, Accounting Issues And Liquidity Constraints Point To 65% Near-Term Downside - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 21/35


As	highlighted	in	the	red	box	above,	the	Company	spent	net	cash	of	$11.9mm	on
equipment	held	for	sale	in	YTD	Q2	2016.	Keeping	this	in	mind,	I	have	provided	below
CGI's	FY	2016	operating	cash	flow	statement:


As	highlighted	above,	in	FY	2016,	CGI	spent	$60.7mm	in	net	cash	on	equipment	held	for
sale.	Thus,	it	can	be	concluded	that	the	Company	spent	$48.8mm	in	net	cash	($60.7mm	-
$11.9mm)	on	equipment	held	for	sale	in	2H	2016.


The	fact	that	the	Quality	business	burned	almost	$50mm	in	cash	on	truck	purchases
in	just	six	months	is	concerning	and	makes	little	sense.	The	fact	that	the	cash	burn	from
equipment	held	for	sale	in	2H	2016	was	almost	$37mm	higher	than	in	1H	2016	($48.8mm
vs.	$11.9mm)	also	makes	little	sense.	Why	has	the	Company	continued	to	purchase
trucks	despite	stating	its	intentions	to	completely	liquidate	its	Quality	truck	inventory?


So	what	exactly	is	going	on	with	the	Quality	business?	I	can	think	of	three	possible
explanations.

7/18/2019 Celadon Group: SEC Inquiries, Accounting Issues And Liquidity Constraints Point To 65% Near-Term Downside - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 22/35


The	first	possible	explanation	is	that	CGI	has	a	large	amount	of	purchase	obligations	for
trucks	that	it	cannot	get	out	of.	For	example,	in	July	2015,	Quality	announced	that	it	had
signed	a	truck	purchase	agreement	with	Navistar	(NYSE:NAV).	The	following	quote	is
from	a	July	2015	Transport	Topics	article	which	described	the	agreement	in	more	detail:


"Truck	maker	Navistar	Inc.	has	finalized	an	agreement	to	supply	Quality	Cos.	with
9,000	Class	8	tractors	during	the	next	three	years"


As	described	above,	Quality	agreed	to	purchase	9,000	trucks	from	Navistar	over	a	period
of	three	years.	Thus,	it	appears	that	CGI	may	be	on	the	hook	for	a	substantial	amount	of
truck	purchases	over	the	next	couple	years.	This	would	potentially	explain	why	the	Quality
business	has	continued	to	burn	cash	on	truck	purchases	over	the	past	six	months.


A	second	explanation	for	Quality's	continued	cash	burn	from	truck	purchases	was
described	in	detail	in	my	initial	article	on	CGI.	Basically,	I	believe	that	CGI	overstated	its
profits	in	FY	2016.	In	order	to	help	cover	up	its	overstated	profits,	I	claimed	that	the
Company	manipulated	its	equipment	held	for	sale	account.	Given	its	lengthy	nature,	I	will
not	rehash	my	analysis	of	CGI's	potentially	overstated	profits	in	this	article.	Instead,	I
would	encourage	you	to	read	my	initial	article	on	CGI	for	more	detail	on	this	issue.


The	final,	and	least	likely,	explanation	for	Quality's	continued	truck	purchases	is	that
management	is	simply	incompetent.	Perhaps	management	believed	that	further
leveraging	its	stressed	balance	sheet	by	buying	trucks	in	a	soft	market	was	a	good	idea.
However,	this	does	not	make	sense	for	a	couple	reasons.	First,	from	a	common	sense
perspective,	it	is	highly	unlikely	that	any	management	team	could	be	so	incompetent.	In
addition	to	this,	as	I	just	discussed,	management	stated	during	its	Q2	2016	earnings	call
that	it	was	focused	on	liquidating	its	Quality	trucks.


Thus,	it	appears	that	either	CGI	has	significant	purchase	obligations	that	it	cannot
get	out,	or	the	Company	is	inflating	its	profits.	Neither	of	these	two	scenarios	are	very
appealing	for	shareholders.


Also	concerning	is	the	fact	that	CGI	appears	to	be	using	creative	accounting	to	hide
the	increase	in	its	equipment	held	for	sale.	For	example,	in	its	Q4	2016	earnings
release,	the	Company	stated	the	following:


"At	June	30,	2016,	leased	assets	held	for	sale,	were	approximately	$24.9	million	and
revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	was	approximately	$45.0	million,	compared	to
$52.6	million	and	$49.9	million	at	June	30,	2015."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 23/35


In	the	above	quote,	the	Company	states	that	its	leased	equipment	held	for	sale	declined
from	$52.9mm	to	$24.9mm	from	FY	2015	to	FY	2016.	During	that	same	time	period,	CGI
states	that	its	revenue	equipment	held	for	sale	also	declined	from	$49.9mm	to	$45.0mm.
These	disclosures	would	seem	to	indicate	that	the	Company's	equipment	held	for	sale
actually	declined	in	FY	2016.	However,	this	is	simply	not	the	case.


As	I	discussed	previously	(as	Accounting	Red	Flag	#9),	in	Q4	2016,	CGI	added	a	third
category	to	equipment	held	for	sale	called	"leased	assets".	In	Q4	2016,	the	Company
reported	$99.3mm	of	leased	assets	on	its	balance	sheet.	Thus,	when	leased	assets	are
properly	taken	into	account,	equipment	held	for	sale	actually	increased	$66.4mm	from
$102.8mm	at	the	end	of	FY	2015	to	$169.2mm	at	the	end	of	FY	2016.	This	seemingly
misleading	representation	of	equipment	held	for	sale	further	calls	into	question	the
integrity	of	CGI's	financial	reporting.


Section	9:	Significant	Concerns	Over	CGI's	Relationship	with	Its	Auditor


The	numerous	accounting	and	disclosure	concerns	I	have	highlighted	raise	serious
concerns	over	the	integrity	of	CGI's	financial	reporting	practices.	Unfortunately	for	CGI
investors,	the	Company's	use	of	BKD	as	its	auditor	does	little	to	ease	these	fears.


Since	switching	its	auditor	from	KPMG	to	BKD	in	late	2013,	CGI's	accounting	and
disclosures	have	become	increasingly	opaque	and	irregular.	I	would	like	to	think	this
is	merely	a	coincidence,	but	there	is	a	substantial	amount	of	evidence	to	suggest
otherwise.


For	starters,	BKD	appears	to	be	have	a	very	questionable	reputation	as	an	auditor.	Over
the	past	few	years,	BKD	has	committed	numerous	regulatory	violations.	For
example,	in	a	recent	June	2016	Daily	Caller	article,	the	website	took	issue	with	the	Clinton
Foundation's	ties	to	BKD.	Some	of	the	unflattering	things	mentioned	about	BKD	in	the
article	are	provided	below:



http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/27/exclusive-clinton-foundation-auditor-has-troubled-regulatory-history/
7/18/2019 Celadon Group: SEC Inquiries, Accounting Issues And Liquidity Constraints Point To 65% Near-Term Downside - Celadon Group, Inc. (NYSE:CGI) | …


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 24/35


"Federal	regulatory	agencies	have	repeatedly	issued	sanctions	and	fines	against
BKD…"


"BKD	ranks	in	the	bottom	half	of	all	auditing	companies	in	the	United	States…"


"It	was	indicted	by	the	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	and	the	Federal
Depository	Insurance	Corporation	for	"unprofessional	conduct"	and	"gross
negligence,"	according	to	federal	court	documents"


"And	the	Public	Company	Oversight	Accounting	Board	(PCOAB),	the	nation's	top
federal	oversight	agency	for	American	accounting	firms,	reported	that	BKD	violated
auditor	independence	rules	over	the	years…"


The	fact	that	BKD	has	had	so	many	regulatory	issues	inspires	little	confidence	in	the
quality	of	the	firm's	audit	work	for	CGI.


Another	concern	is	that	BKD	appears	to	specialize	in	auditing	small	and	microcap
companies	in	the	financial	services	space.	A	quick	Google	search	for	"BKD	and	Def	14A"
brings	up	a	list	of	BKD	clients,	most	of	whom	are	small	community	banks	and	insurance
companies.	These	clients	include	Southern	Missouri	Bancorp	(NASDAQ:SMBC),	Wayne
Savings	(WAYN)	and	Farmer	Capital	Bank	Corp	(NASDAQ:FFKT).	Thus,	BKD	does	not
appear	to	have	much	experience	auditing	asset-intensive	businesses	(like	trucking
companies).	This	fact,	combined	with	BKD's	relatively	small	size,	brings	up	the	question
of	whether	BKD	has	the	resources	and	experience	necessary	to	audit	CGI.


One	final	concern	I	will	highlight	is	the	unusual	and	large	increase	in	fees	that	CGI	has
paid	to	BKD	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015.	Provided	below	is	a	breakdown	of	the	audit	fees
paid	by	the	Company	to	BKD	in	both	years	(as	per	its	FY	2015	Def	14A):


As	shown	above,	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015,	the	total	fees	paid	by	CGI	to	BKD
increased	almost	72%	from	$248K	to	$426K.	Such	a	large	year-over-year	increase	in
fees	is	quite	unusual.	This	sharp	rise	in	fees	paid	by	CGI	to	BKD	should	have	investors
concerned.	The	following	excerpt	is	from	an	October	2011	Reuters	article	discussing	the
red	flags	associated	with	large	increases	in	audit	fees:

"In	addition	to	forecasting	operating	declines,	high	audit	fees	are	predictive	of	fraud
and	restatements,	and	rising	fees	can	foreshadow	steep	stock	price	drops,	credit
rating	downgrades	and	class	action	lawsuits"


Based	on	an	April	2010	study	cited	in	the	Reuters	article,	companies	with	high	or	rising
audit	fees	are	at	greater	risk	of	having	poor	operating	performance	or	accounting
issues.	Given	CGI's	numerous	financial	red	flags,	investors	should	view	BKD's	rising	fee
with	a	good	deal	of	concern.


Another	concern	regarding	the	increase	in	BKD's	fees	is	the	fact	that	"All	Other	Fees"
increased	almost	500%	from	$14.3mm	to	$67.0m.	I	am	not	sure	what	types	of	"other"
services	BKD	is	providing	to	CGI,	but	it	seems	unusual	that	the	fees	from	other	services
would	more	than	quadruple	in	just	one	year.	According	to	an	article	on	Investopedia,	a
large	amount	of	non-audit	fees	can	raise	concerns	over	a	company's	relationship	with	its
auditor:


"…a	common	allegation	was	that	fees	for	non-audit	services,	such	as	valuation	and
appraisal	or	executive	recruitment	services,	were	an	inducement	to	auditors	to	allow
clients	to	get	away	with	accounting	misconduct…"


Thus,	the	huge	increase	in	non-audit	fees	paid	by	CGI	further	calls	into	question	the
integrity	and	accuracy	of	BKD's	audit.


Section	10:	An	SEC	Investigation	Appears	Likely


I	believe	an	SEC	investigation	into	the	Company's	financial	reporting	practices	is	likely.
Based	on	the	numerous	questions	that	the	SEC	sent	CGI	regarding	its	FY	2015	10-K,	the
SEC	appears	to	already	have	the	Company	in	its	sights.	Given	that	the	Company's
accounting	and	disclosures	issues	have	only	gotten	worse	in	FY	2016,	the	SEC	will	likely
take	an	even	deeper	look	into	its	financial	reporting	methods.


Further	increasing	the	chances	of	an	SEC	investigation	is	the	fact	that	most	of	CGI's
financial	reporting	issues	are	related	to	its	Quality	business.	Provided	below	is	a	summary
of	the	various	issues	related	to	the	Quality	business	which	have	been	discussed	in	this
article:

Based	on	its	prior	letters	to	CGI,	the	SEC	already	appears	to	be	skeptical	of	the
Quality	business.	In	its	letters,	the	vast	majority	of	the	SEC's	questions	were	focused	on
better	understanding	the	rather	opaque	and	confusing	accounting	treatment	of	Quality.
Given	this	fact,	the	Company's	increasingly	questionable	reporting	of	its	Quality
business	in	FY	2016	vs.	FY	2015	is	likely	to	catch	the	SEC's	attention.	Thus,	I	believe
it	is	a	matter	of	when	and	not	if	the	SEC	will	launch	a	formal	investigation	into	the
Company.


Section	11:	A	Large	Liquidity	Event	or	Insolvency	Is	Looming


In	addition	to	its	highly	questionable	financial	reporting	practices,	CGI's	ability	to	stay
solvent	over	the	coming	months	is	also	in	serious	doubt.	For	starters,	the	Company
currently	has	just	a	small	amount	of	room	remaining	under	its	leverage	ratio
covenant.	Provided	below	is	my	detailed	calculation	of	CGI's	leverage	ratio	as	of	Q4
2016:

As	discussed	in	my	previous	article,	based	on	the	terms	of	its	credit	agreement,	CGI	must
maintain	a	Lease-Adjusted	Debt	to	Adjusted	EBITDAR	ratio	of	less	than	4x.	As	of	the	end
of	Q4	2016,	the	Company	appears	to	have	very	little	cushion	remaining	under	its	4x
leverage	ratio	covenant.	Based	on	my	calculations	above,	if	EBITDAR	declines	by	just
$9mm	or	debt	increases	by	just	$36mm,	then	CGI	will	be	in	technical	default	of	its
covenants.


It	is	also	worth	noting	that	the	leverage	ratio	I	have	calculated	above	does	not	include
Quality's	$74mm	of	reserve	account	liabilities.	If	this	liability	is	included,	then	the	Company
is	already	in	default.	Also,	as	I	discussed	in	my	previous	article,	I	believe	the	Company
overstated	its	profits	in	FY	2016	by	at	least	$18mm.	Once	again,	if	$18mm	or	greater	of
potentially	overstated	profits	are	deducted	from	EBITDAR,	then	the	Company	is	already	in
default.


Based	on	recent	developments,	it	appears	that	CGI's	lenders	may	already	be	limiting	its
ability	to	borrow.	In	Q4	2016,	the	Company	announced	a	rather	complicated	$30mm
loan	from	19th	Capital.	The	following	description	of	the	transaction	is	from	pg.	67	of	its
FY	2016	10-K:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 28/35


"In	a	separate	transaction	we	received	$30.0	million	in	net	proceeds	from	the
disposition	of	leased	equipment,	with	a	book	value	of	approximately	$37.7	million.
Although	we	transferred	title	of	these	assets,	we	retained	certain	risks	of	ownership
through	a	deferred	payment	stream…"


"We	recorded	a	liability	of	$30.0	million…	that	will	pay	down	over	an	estimated
period	of	49	months	as	lease	payments	from	owner	operators	are	collected	and
remitted	to	19th	Capital."


Based	on	the	description	in	its	10-K,	CGI	appears	to	have	portrayed	the	above	transaction
as	a	sale/disposition	of	$37.7mm	of	equipment	held	for	sale.	However,	in	reality,	the
Company	essentially	took	out	a	$30mm	loan	from	19th	Capital.	This	loan	was	secured	by
$37.7mm	of	trucks	(equipment	held	for	sale)	on	its	balance	sheet	and	is	to	be	paid	back
with	lease	payments	over	49	months.	When	the	$30mm	is	paid	back,	19th	Capital	will
retain	ownership	of	the	trucks.	Thus,	this	amounts	to	a	very	expensive	loan	where	19th
Capital	lends	CGI	$30mm	and	receives	back	$30mm	in	payments	+	the	residual	value	of
the	trucks.


The	expensive	nature	of	this	loan	leads	to	the	question	of	why	CGI	decided	to	raise
money	in	this	manner.	As	I	illustrated	in	my	Q4	2016	covenant	calculation,	the	Company
has	$36mm	of	debt	cushion	remaining	under	its	leverage	ratio	covenant.	Prior	to	the
recent	$30mm	loan	from	19th	Capital,	CGI	had	around	$66mm	of	debt	cushion	remaining
($36mm	cushion	+	$30mm	loan).	It	would	have	been	much	simpler	and	cheaper	for	the
Company	to	simply	draw	$30mm	of	additional	funds	from	this	revolver.


In	my	opinion,	the	fact	that	CGI	chose	to	raise	money	in	such	a	complicated	and
expensive	fashion	indicates	that	its	lenders	may	have	already	started	to	limit	its
ability	to	borrow.	This	would	not	be	surprising	given	all	of	the	accounting	irregularities
and	undisclosed	liabilities	in	the	Company's	financial	reports.


CGI's	covenant	issues	and	overall	precarious	situation	with	its	lender	could	not	come	at	a
worse	time.	The	Company	is	currently	burning	cash	at	an	alarming	rate	and	desperately
needs	additional	liquidity	to	sustain	its	business	operations.	In	2H	2016,	the	Company
reported	a	FCF	loss	of	$47.1mm	(FCF	defined	as	operating	CF	-	capex	+	proceeds	from
PP&E	sales	-	payments	on	capital	leases).	Thus,	on	a	run-rate	basis,	CGI's	annual
cash	burn	is	almost	$100mm!


The	main	contributors	to	the	Company's	alarming	cash	burn	in	2H	2016	are	as	follows:


Net	cash	spent	on	other	assets	of	$31.9mm	due	to	Quality's	lease	payment	advances

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 29/35


Net	cash	spent	on	equipment	held	for	sale	(Quality	trucks)	of	$48.8mm
Sharp	decline	in	profitability	of	core	trucking	business


Unfortunately	for	CGI	investors,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	cash	burn	is	likely	to
accelerate	in	FY	2017.	Consider	the	following	disclosure	from	pg.	24	of	CGI's	FY	2016
10-K:


"As	of	June	30,	2016,	we	have	advanced	approximately	$31.9	million	to	our	third
party	financing	provider	under	the	Lease	Shortfall	Advances.	This	amount	is
expected	to	grow	during	fiscal	2017…"


Also,	the	following	is	from	pg.	38	of	the	same	10-K:


"If	we	are	unable	to	improve	utilization	and	collections,	we	believe	the	Lease
Shortfall	Advance	could	present	significant	liquidity	constraints."


As	highlighted	in	the	first	quote	above,	the	Company	expects	its	lease	payment	advances
to	increase	in	FY	2017	relative	to	FY	2016.	As	a	result,	CGI	warns	that	it	could	experience
"significant	liquidity	constraints".	These	cautionary	disclosures	strongly	indicate	that	the
Company's	lease	payment	obligations	may	grow	to	an	unmanageable	amount	in	FY	2017.


In	addition	to	growing	lease	payment	advances,	CGI's	core	trucking	business	continues	to
perform	poorly.	In	Q4	2016,	CGI	reported	earnings	of	$0.06	which	badly	missed	the
consensus	analyst	estimate	of	$0.20.	In	its	Q4	report,	the	Company	warned	investors	that
the	downturn	in	the	trucking	industry	and	its	business	would	continue	for	the	foreseeable
future.	Thus,	a	recovery	in	the	Company's	core	trucking	business	is	unlikely	in	the	short
term.


Given	its	challenging	covenant	situation	and	significant	ongoing	cash	burn,	I	believe	that
CGI	is	at	high	risk	of	soon	declaring	bankruptcy.	The	Company	does	not	appear	to	have
enough	liquidity	to	sustain	itself	for	more	than	two	quarters.	Thus,	to	avoid	bankruptcy,
the	Company	will	have	to	find	a	way	to	raise	a	significant	amount	of	capital	over	the
next	six	months.


Given	its	large	amount	of	liabilities,	it	appears	that	the	Company's	only	option	to	raise
capital	will	be	through	a	highly	dilutive	secondary	offering.	Given	the	Company's	current
run-rate	cash	burn	of	almost	$100mm,	I	estimate	that	such	a	secondary	offering	would
likely	have	to	be	around	$100mm	or	more.	CGI's	current	market	cap	is	just	$244mm.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 30/35


Thus,	a	$100mm	secondary	offering	would	result	in	over	40%	dilution	for	existing
shareholders!	So,	even	if	the	Company	is	successful	in	raising	money,	existing
shareholders	will	likely	experience	significant	losses	on	their	investment.


It	should	also	be	noted	that	this	analysis	does	not	take	into	account	a	potential	SEC
investigation.	Such	an	investigation	would	result	in	an	automatic	default	under	its	credit
agreement	and	likely	lead	to	a	bankruptcy	filing	by	the	Company.


Section	12:	The	Proposed	JV	Is	a	No	Win	Situation	for	CGI


In	its	FY	2016	10-K,	the	Company	announced	that	it	had	recently	signed	an	MOU	with
Element	which	outlined	terms	for	a	proposed	JV.	Under	the	terms	of	the	MOU,	Element
and	19th	Capital	would	contribute	all	of	the	trucks	purchased	from	Quality	into	the
proposed	JV	structure.	Additionally,	CGI/Quality	would	contribute	all	of	the	trucks
(equipment	held	for	sale)	held	on	its	balance	sheet	into	the	JV.	Pro	forma	for	these
contributions,	CGI	and	Element	would	both	own	50%	of	the	JV.


It	appears	that,	by	forming	this	JV,	the	Company	is	hoping	to	rid	itself	of	Quality's
significant	and	growing	lease	payment	advance	obligations.	The	following	disclosure	is
from	pg.	30	of	its	FY	2016	10-K:


"…it	is	anticipated	that	Quality	would	enter	into	servicing	arrangements	with	the	joint
venture	providing	for	a	monthly	servicing	fee	per	tractor.	The	servicing
arrangement	would	not	include	the	obligation	to	make	Lease	Shortfall
Advances	or	any	similar	arrangement."


As	highlighted	above,	under	the	terms	provided	in	the	MOU,	the	formation	of	the	JV	will
effectively	cancel	Quality's	lease	payment	advances.	Given	the	huge	cash	drain	of	these
lease	payments	($31.9mm	in	FY	2016),	the	JV	would	appear	to	be	a	significant	positive
for	the	Company.	However,	as	I	will	demonstrate	in	the	analysis	to	follow,	the	JV	appears
to	have	little	chance	of	actually	being	consummated.	In	addition	to	this,	even	if	the
proposed	JV	is	consummated,	it	will	likely	result	in	a	huge	write-down	for	CGI.


To	begin	my	analysis,	I	will	provide	more	details	on	the	respective	contributions	of	CGI
and	Element	to	the	proposed	JV.	According	to	pg.	30	of	the	10-K,	CGI	will	make	the
following	contributions	to	the	JV	in	exchange	for	a	50%	ownership	stake:


$20mm	of	cash	(to	be	paid	by	Element	as	reimbursement	for	lease	payments
advances	made	by	CGI	to	Element)
$75mm	of	trucks	(equipment	held	for	sale)	free	and	clear	of	any	debt

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 31/35


Element,	for	its	50%	interest	in	the	JV,	will	contribute	its	existing	portfolio	of	trucks.
However,	unlike	CGI's	contribution,	all	debt	associated	with	Element's	trucks	will	also
roll	into	the	JV.	This	is	a	very	important	distinction	which	becomes	apparent	after
analyzing	Element's	balance	sheet	and	business	model.


Element	finances	its	asset	purchases	almost	entirely	with	secured	debt.	It	essentially
makes	money	on	the	spread	between	the	interest	paid	on	this	secured	debt	versus	the
premium	received	in	the	underlying	lease	payment.	Element's	funding	of	asset	purchases
primarily	with	secured	debt	is	reflected	in	the	large	amount	of	debt	relative	to	equity	on	its
balance	sheet.	Provided	below	is	a	snapshot	of	the	liabilities	and	equity	on	its	balance
sheet	as	of	June	30,	2016.


So	what	does	this	mean	in	terms	of	the	proposed	JV	between	CGI	and	Element?	For
starters,	it	means	that	the	proposed	JV	is	unlikely	to	be	consummated.	Consider	the
following	disclosure	from	pg.	30	of	CGI's	FY	2016	10-K:


"We	would	not	have	any	financial	obligation	for	the	debt	of	the	joint	venture,	and	we
would	expect	to	record	our	interest	in	the	joint	venture	under	the	equity	method	of
accounting."


As	shown	in	the	quote	above,	the	debt	that	Element	contributes	to	the	JV	will	be	non-
recourse.	In	other	words,	CGI	and	Element	will	not	be	liable	for	the	debt	of	the	JV.	In	total,
Element	has	purchased	$623mm	worth	of	trucks	from	Quality.	This	means	that	a
significant	amount	of	debt	(likely	exceeding	$500mm)	will	be	attached	to	the	trucks
Element	is	contributing	to	the	JV.


Given	that	the	proposed	JV	would	remove	a	significant	amount	of	debt	off	its	balance
sheet,	it	is	not	surprising	that	Element	agreed	to	the	MOU.	However,	Element's	debt
holders	are	unlikely	to	agree	to	such	an	arrangement.	It	simply	makes	no	sense	for

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 32/35


them	to	roll	its	debt	from	a	large	and	stable	business	like	Element	into	a	small,	non-
recourse	JV	with	100%	exposure	to	the	soft	trucking	market.	Thus,	for	these	reasons,	I
believe	the	proposed	JV	has	very	little	chance	of	actually	being	formed.


Even	if	the	proposed	JV	is	somehow	consummated,	this	will	likely	do	little	to	improve
CGI's	financial	situation.	Due	to	the	decline	in	truck	resale	values	and	low	utilization,
Element	has	incurred	significant	losses	in	excess	of	$100mm	(as	demonstrated	in	a
previous	section)	from	its	truck	purchases	from	Quality.	Given	that	Element	financed	its
purchases	from	Quality	with	debt,	this	means	that	the	amount	of	debt	Element	is
contributing	to	the	JV	will	likely	exceed	the	value	of	its	trucks.


The	fact	that	Element's	contribution	of	trucks	will	likely	be	significantly	underwater	with
debt	means	that	CGI's	50%	stake	in	the	JV	will	likely	have	little	to	no	value.	To	help
illustrate	why	this	is	the	case,	I	have	provided	below	the	following	analysis:


In	the	above	analysis,	as	per	the	terms	of	the	MOU,	I	have	assumed	CGI	contributes
$20mm	of	cash	and	$75mm	of	trucks	(debt-free)	to	the	JV.	For	Quality,	I	have	assumed
that	the	value	of	its	trucks	is	$500mm	while	the	debt	attached	to	these	trucks	is	$595mm.
This	difference	of	$95mm	is	close	to	the	over	$100mm	of	losses	that	Element	has	incurred
on	its	truck	purchases.


As	shown	above,	CGI	has	contributed	$95mm	of	equity	to	the	JV.	However,	Quality's
contribution	of	trucks	which	are	$95mm	underwater	in	debt	completely	offsets	this
contribution.	As	a	result,	the	pro	forma	equity	value	of	the	JV	is	$0.


As	illustrated	by	this	analysis,	I	believe	the	value	of	CGI's	equity	stake	in	the	joint
venture	will	be	$0.	Given	its	contribution	of	$95mm	in	debt-free	assets,	this	means	the
Company	will	likely	have	to	take	a	$95mm	write-down	if	the	JV	is	consummated
(write-down	=	$0	equity	value	in	JV	-	$95mm	asset	contribution).	This	represents	$3.30

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4011499-celadon-group-sec-inquiries-accounting-issues-liquidity-constraints-point-65-percent-near 33/35


per	share	of	book	value.	Such	a	large	write-down	would	significantly	pressure	its	already
weak	financial	position.	Thus,	even	if	the	JV	is	successfully	formed,	it	will	do	little	to
improve	CGI's	financial	situation.


Section	13:	Recently	Disclosed	Safety	Issues	Are	Another	Concern


The	final	item	that	I	will	discuss	in	this	article	is	CGI's	troubling	disclosure	that	it	had
violated	thresholds	in	"a	number	of"	CSA	safety-related	categories.	The	Company
attributed	these	safety	violations	to	the	large	amount	of	newly	trained	drivers	in	its
workforce.	The	following	disclosures	are	from	pg.	17	of	its	FY	2016	10-K:


"We	have	exceeded	the	established	intervention	thresholds	in	a	number	of	the
seven	CSA	safety-related	categories."


"We	recruit	and	retain	first-time	drivers	to	be	part	of	our	fleet,	and	these	drivers	may
have	a	higher	likelihood	of	creating	adverse	safety	events	under	CSA."


CGI	warned	investors	that	its	safety	violations	could	have	significant	adverse
consequences	for	its	business.	The	following	disclosures	are	once	again	from	pg.	17	of	its
FY	2016	10-K:


"The	FMCSA	has	proposed	regulations	that	would	modify	the	existing	rating
system…	If	these	proposed	regulations	are	enacted	and	we	were	to	receive	an	unfit
safety	rating,	our	business	would	be	materially	adversely	affected…"


"…future	deficiencies	could	affect	driver	recruitment	by	causing	high-quality	drivers
to	seek	employment	with	other	carriers	or	limit	the	pool	of	drivers	we	are	comfortable
hiring…competition	for	drivers	with	favorable	safety	backgrounds	may	increase	and
thus	could	necessitate	increases	in	driver-related	compensation	costs."


As	described	in	the	above	disclosures,	the	Company	warned	that	it	may	receive	a	DOT
safety	rating	downgrade	as	a	result	of	its	violations.	This,	in	turn,	could	result	in	a	loss	of
clients.	Also,	going	forward,	CGI	will	likely	have	to	hire	a	greater	proportion	of	more
experienced,	and	in	turn	more	expensive,	drivers.


These	safety	violations	add	further	doubt	to	the	Company's	ability	to	remain	solvent.	A
loss	of	clients	and	a	more	expensive	workforce	could	significantly	pressure	the
Company's	financial	performance.	Given	its	already	constrained	liquidity	position,	I	am
not	sure	if	CGI	can	remain	solvent	in	the	face	of	these	additional	financial	headwinds.

My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	quickly	note	that	I	sent	an	email	to	CGI's	Investor	Relations	team,	asking
them	to	address	the	key	issues	brought	up	in	this	article.	I	will	provide	an	update	in	the
comments	section	if	I	receive	any	meaningful	new	information	from	the	Company


Conclusion


It	is	worth	repeating:	Where	there	is	smoke,	there	is	often	fire.	CGI	can	only	get	away	with
its	questionable	financial	reporting	and	business	practices	for	so	long	until	someone	starts
asking	tough	questions.	Recent	events	indicate	that	this	someone	is	likely	to	be	the	SEC.
In	addition	to	a	potential	SEC	investigation,	the	Company's	liquidity	position	continues	to
deteriorate	at	a	rapid	pace.	Given	its	current	run-rate	cash	burn	of	almost	$100mm,	CGI
will	likely	have	to	raise	capital	through	a	highly	dilutive	secondary	offering	over	the	next	six
months.	If	it	is	not	successful	in	doing	so,	then	the	Company	will	likely	have	to	declare
bankruptcy.	Overall,	given	these	looming	negative	events	that	are	on	the	horizon,	I	believe
that	CGI	remains	a	tremendous	short	opportunity	at	the	current	share	price.


Disclosure:	I	am/we	are	short	CGI.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving
compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is
mentioned	in	this	article.

Jeremy	Blum,	Contributor
You	say	that	there	is	a	$100	million	cash	burn	run	rate.	This	is	not	true.	The	most	recent	10K	shows	$48	million	in
positive	cash	flow	for	the	year	ended	June	30,	2016,	before	cash	used	for	acquisitions	and	financing	(my	definition	of
cash	flow	from	operations).	For	the	second	half	of	that	fiscal	year,	the	cash	burn	rate	before	acquisitions	and	financing
was	only	$12	million.


You	say	they	continue	to	buy	trucks.	Every	trucking	company	buys	trucks	because	they	sell	them	after	3-5	years.	They
are	always	buying	if	they	want	to	stay	in	business.	In	fact,	fixed	assets	have	actually	declined	significantly	over	the
past	year.	They	are	selling	a	lot	more	than	they	are	buying.	They	have	also	paid	down	their	interest	bearing	debt	and
capital	leases	by	$79	million	over	the	past	6	months.


The	final	SEC	letter	was	5	months	ago.


BKD	is	one	of	the	largest	accounting	firms	in	the	U.S.	Your	criticisms	of	them	is	the	first	I	have	heard	of	their	being	a
serious	problem.	I	owned	SMBC	one	of	the	banks	they	audit	and	it	is	a	solid	bank.	They	are	not	fly	by	night.


Audit	fees	are	probably	up	due	to	the	reserve	issue	and	SEC	letters	you	brought	up.	I	would	agree	proper	reserves	is
a	legitimate	issue	and	would	have	taken	a	lot	of	auditor	time.

Author’s	reply	» 	Hi	Jeremy.	They	burned	$50mm	on	equipment	held	for	sale	which	is	trucks	for	the	Quality
business.	Quality	trucks	are	bought	in	bulk	and	then	sold	for	profit	(in	theory)	by	CGI.	They	are	NOT	trucks	to
be	used	in	operations.	Mgmt	stated	that	they	would	liquidate	these	trucks	in	their	Q2	earnings	call.	Six	months
later,	they	purchased	almost	$50mm	more	on	a	net	basis.	This	makes	no	sense.


Their	cash	burn	rate	was	almost	$48mm	over	the	past	two	quarters,	which	is	almost	$100mm	annualized.
Take	operating	cash	flow	-	capex	-	capital	lease	obligation	payments	+	PP&E	proceeds	to	get	to	the	number.
You	have	to	include	capital	lease	payments	because	that	is	essentially	another	form	of	capex.


BKD	mostly	audits	small	banks	and	insurance	companies.	They	appear	ill-equipped	to	handle	a	trucking
business	with	thousands	of	trucks	sprawled	across	the	nation.	Different	type	of	animal	to	audit.	The	huge
increase	in	fees	is	highly	unusual.


They	converted	capital	leases	to	operating	leases.	That	is	not	paying	down	debt.	That	is	merely	artificially
shifting	liabilities	off	the	balance	sheet.
