securities covered herein. This is not investment advice nor should it be construed as such.  We are short Hain and therefore stand to

products discussed herein are safe for human consumption.  Laboratory test results are presented as is, without any warranty of any

THE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. (“Hain” or the “Company”) is a $3 billion roll-up of 
disparate food brands that we believe is masquerading as a healthy/organic food company.  In this 
report we present compelling evidence (based on independent lab tests and other due diligence) 
suggesting that products representing 85% of the Company’s 2012 internal growth are beset by 
quality control issues and/or deceptive marketing practices.  We believe that once the Company’s 
exaggerated claims are exposed, Hain will revert to its historical internal growth rate of 3% and 
eventually trade in-line with mature packaged goods companies at a 15.5x forward p/e multiple.  
As Hain currently trades at 24x forward earnings, this implies downside of 35%.


TROUBLED CONSUMER PRODUCTS


1. The Sinking Flagship.  Celestial Seasonings is Hain’s flagship brand and also one of its 
most profitable product lines.  It is built on the perception that its teas are ‘100% natural’ and 
healthy.  As consumers, we decided to verify such claims by sending eleven of the 
Company’s popular teas to Eurofins, an accredited and independent lab that is the global 
leader in drug and food testing.  Lab tests showed the following: 


a. Tea Samples Violate US Law.  91% of the Celestial Seasonings’ teas we tested violated 
U.S. pesticide standards (CFR 40 section 180), meaning such teas are ‘adulterated’ under 
the FDCA and subject to federal regulatory action.  All violative samples contained traces 
of known or possible human carcinogens.   


b. Children’s Tea Sample Contained Traces of a Known Carcinogen.  Independent lab 
tests revealed that the Celestial Seasonings’ Sleepytime Kids Goodnight Grape Herbal 
Tea sample contained 0.26 ppm of Propachlor, a known carcinogen for which there is no 
safe harbor limit established under California’s Proposition 65.  


c. ‘Wellness Tea’ Samples Also Appear to Violate California Proposition 65.  Six other 
tea samples, including all three teas that we sampled from Hain's "Wellness Tea" 
category, contained traces of Propargite, a known carcinogen and developmental toxin 
for which there is also no safe harbor limit under California's Proposition 65.  


d. Repeat Offender.  The FDA has issued two prior Warning Letters to Celestial 
Seasonings for quality control issues.  Given our test results, we expect further regulatory 
scrutiny.   


2. Nectar of the Gods?  Hain markets Greek Gods Yogurt (responsible for an estimated 37% of 
its internal growth in 2012), as an ‘authentic’ Greek-style yogurt. We believe this marketing 
to be deceptive because Greek Gods contains only one-third of the protein and 400% more fat 
when compared with ‘authentic’ Greek style-yogurts such as Chobani.  Consumers are 
catching on, and sales growth is sharply decelerating.

INDUSTRY:  Processed and Packaged Goods


NASDAQ: HAIN


3. Sensible Portions Veggie Straws.  Sensible Portions accounts for an estimated 40% of Hain's
2012 internal growth.  We believe that these 'veggie straws' are another example of deceptive 
marketing because they are promoted as a healthy snack yet appear to have very little vitamin 
content. Sales growth has imploded, we believe due to the launch of competing products and 
increasing consumer awareness of this product’s true nutritional value.


4. DeBoles Organic Pasta.  Independent lab tests detected that multiple samples of DeBoles 
pastas, labeled ‘certified USDA organic,’ contained traces of MGK-264 and piperonyl 
butoxide, which are EPA Group C Possible Human Carcinogens associated with conventional 
pesticide use. 


5. Deceptively Labeled Face Wash and Shampoo? Hain is currently defending against a class 
action lawsuit alleging that its personal care brands Jason and Avalon Organics are 
deceptively mislabeled as ‘organic.’ For example, in one Jason product labeled ‘organic,’ 
only 1 of 19 ingredients was actually organic.  


6. Spectrum Organic – More Deceptive Labeling. In 2010 the FDA warned Hain because it 
was labeling its Spectrum Organic All Vegetable Shortening as ‘cholesterol free’ when it was 
not.


BUSTED GROWTH STORY


7. Non-‘Organic’ Growth Rate.  Hain has masked anemic internal growth through serial 
acquisitions and discontinued operations.  If you back out acquisitions and accounting 
gimmicks, we estimate Hain's sales averaged 3% internal growth between 2000 and 2011. 
This compares unfavorably to a 12% average internal growth rate for the U.S. natural and 
organic food category as a whole.


8. The Party is Over.  Hain’s estimated 7% internal growth rate in 2012 was driven primarily 
by Greek Gods Yogurt and Sensible Portions (Veggie Straws).  Sales growth of both products
appears to have rapidly decelerated in recent months.  Excluding these products and the 
troubled Celestial Seasonings line, we estimate 2012 internal sales grew by only 1%, which is 
more comparable to a mature packaged goods company (3%-4% growth) than a leader in 
organic and natural foods (10%-20% growth).  


INSIDER SALES


10. Valuation.  A likely reversion to Hain's historical internal growth rate of 3% suggests that the 
Company’s stock should trade in line with mature packaged food companies with similar 
growth profiles, not healthy/organic food comps.  A 15.5x forward p/e implies a stock price of 
$38, around 35% below today's stock price of $58 per share.  


By contrast, we have identified WHITEWAVE FOODS ("WhiteWave") (NYSE: WWAV) as 
an alternative healthy foods investment.  WhiteWave appears to have sustainable double-digit 
internal growth rates and we tested a number of its organic and GMO-free products against 
WhiteWave’s claims, all of which came back 100% clean.  Currently trading at 21x forward 
earnings, we expect WhiteWave to trade more in line with other healthy food comps at 30x as 
the market learns of the authenticity of its products.  


9. Simon Says, Simon Sells. During the last 21 months, Hain CEO Irwin Simon took advantage 


of a temporary boost in Hain’s share price to dump $33 million of stock.   Worse still, Simon 


sold his stock in eleven tranches, all of which began within hours to 28 trading days after 


Simon appeared on CNBC to tout the growth prospects of his Company.

TH


Hain is a $3 billion roll-up of disparate consumer food brands that we believe is masquerading as a 


healthy/organic food business.  The Company touts its motto, ‘healthy way of life,’ through a suite of 


purportedly healthy brands such as Celestial Seasonings tea, Greek Gods Yogurt, Sensible Portions 
Veggie Straws, DeBoles organic pasta, and many more.  


Hain’s Brands


Hain's stock price has recently ridden the wave of investor dollars pouring into healthy food products.   
The Company currently trades at 24x 2013 earnings or a 60%+ premium to packaged food peers (trading 


at 15.5x) that, by our estimates, have a similar long-term internal growth rate of 3-4%. This is a lofty 


valuation for a Company with, in our view, little substantive connection to more authentic healthy food 
investments. 


In this report, we examine recurring quality control problems and a pattern of questionable
marketing/labeling practices with some of Hain’s most important consumer products.  Not only do 


independent lab tests show that some of its most prominent ‘healthy’ products violate US pesticide 


regulations, but we also discuss how its other supposedly healthy products are, in reality, 


indistinguishable from much cheaper, conventional brands. We believe that Hain is significantly 
overvalued and that its stock price is destined to collapse under the weight of quality control issues, 


questionable labeling practices and anemic internal growth.  


We believe that by comparison, WhiteWave is an authentic organic and healthy food company, which 


recently debuted on the NYSE.  We directed Eurofins to test various WhiteWave organic, non-GMO and 


anti-biotic free products against their respective claims, and the independent lab tests revealed that all of 


WhiteWave’s products came back 100% clean.  WhiteWave appears to have a suite of authentic USDA 
organic products that is growing sustainably at low double-digit rates.  Compare this to the estimated low

single digit internal growth rate at Hain for the last ten years.  We believe that WhiteWave, not Hain, 


should trade at a premium price to reflect the ongoing boom in healthy and organic foods.  


I. CELESTIAL SEASONINGS: THE SINKING FLAGSHIP


Management’s hyper-promotional disposition, insider selling and history of FDA warnings made us 
skeptical of the Company’s claims regarding the health qualities of its products.  To verify whether 


Hain’s consumer products could justify the healthy image cultivated by management, we purchased a 


sampling of Celestial Seasonings teas from online retailers and had them shipped directly to Eurofins,


an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited and independent laboratory, for testing. 


1. Healthy Tea? 


Celestial Seasonings tea is perhaps Hain’s most recognizable brand, accounting for 8% of the Company’s 


consolidated net sales in 2012 and an even higher percentage of net income.
1
  Our families have 


purchased Celestial teas for years.  Like many consumers, we were enticed by the label that advertises all 


of Celestial teas as ‘100% natural’
2


and touts the health benefits of each product on the label. 


Celestial Seasonings’ marketing strategy is best exemplified by the Company’s website.  The following 


paragraph, taken directly from the website, uses the words ‘wellness’, ‘natural’ or ‘healthy’ seven times 


in just three sentences.

JP Morgan Research Report, December 12, 2006 "tea segment is HAIN's most profitable (highest gross margin)."
2


Although companies are legally allowed to market food or beverages as ‘natural’ even though such products may 


contain pesticides, we believe that this is not well understood by consumers who purchase Celestial Seasonings 


brand based on the perception that its teas are 'healthy'.  


During the last 21 months, Hain CEO Irwin Simon took advantage of a temporary boost in Hain’s share 


price to dump $33 million of stock.   Worse still, Simon sold his stock in eleven tranches, all of which 


occurred within hours to 28 trading days after Simon appeared on CNBC to tout the growth 
prospects of his Company.  We believe investors would be wise to heed his actions and ignore what 


Simon says.

www.glaucusresearch.comTHE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. | NASDAQ: HAIN


In one of his many television appearances, Hain CEO, Irwin Simon, touted his Company’s products as a 


healthy alternative to the growing problem of pesticide use: 


Simon Says: "Eating healthy is not a fad.  One of the best preventions of cancer is 


preventing obesity and we keep reading about ingredients - pesticides


- Irwin Simon CNBC 5/7/2012


We tested eleven Celestial Seasonings teas from the brand’s most popular categories (green tea, wellness 
tea, sleepy time/kids tea and k-cup).  Results showed that many of the teas contained so many pesticides 


that they violated US regulatory standards.  It is important to note that at no time did we take custody of, 


touch or handle any of the tea samples.  Rather, we had the products shipped directly to Eurofins from the 
Company’s website and other online retailers.  We selected Eurofins because it is an ISO/IEC 17025 


accredited and independent laboratory, and it is the world leader in food, pharmacological and 


environmental testing.


We would also like to encourage regulators and investors with a significant stake (either long or short) in 


Hain to test the Celestial Seasonings teas. Such tests cost a few thousand dollars and can be completed in 


as little as forty-eight hours.  We have included copies of the lab reports in Appendix I. 


2. Teas Violate FDA and EPA Pesticide Standards


Independent lab tests of Celestial Seasonings teas undermine the healthy image cultivated by Hain’s 


management.  


By law, the EPA is responsible for establishing ‘tolerances’ (i.e. maximum safe limits) for each pesticide 


based on the potential risk to human health posed by the chemical. The FDA enforces such tolerances to 


ensure that the nation's food supply is maintained safely at all times. Under Section 402, Title 


342(a)(2)(B) and Section 406, Title 346(a)(1) of the FDCA, a processed food is considered to be 


‘adulterated’ and subject to FDA enforcement action if it contains pesticide residue for which there is no 


tolerance, tolerance exemption, or food additive regulation.


91% of the Celestial Seasonings teas tested contained residues of pesticides either in amounts exceeding 


federally prescribed tolerance levels or for which no regulatory limit has been established under federal 


law, meaning that such samples violated EPA pesticide regulation 40 CFR 180.

The consequences of violating EPA pesticide regulations are potentially devastating to the Celestial 


Seasonings brand as federal regulators may seize or recall the offending products. At the very least, 


Celestial Seasonings may initiate a voluntary recall of the teas that violate US law in order to avoid 


regulatory fines and consumer lawsuits.


Further undermining the healthy brand image carefully cultivated by Celestial Seasonings, many of the 


teas we tested showed traces of pesticides classified by state and federal regulators as ‘known’ or


‘possible’ human carcinogens.
3
   We are not making any claims about the health effects of the pesticide 


residues in Celestial Seasonings’ tea; merely that for a company leveraging its sales off of a brand it 


characterizes as natural and healthy, the presence of possible and known carcinogens could be 


significantly damaging to sales.  


We have listed the results in the following chart.  Note that these teas are marketed as healthy products.

A carcinogen is any substance, radionuclide or radiation that is an agent directly involved in causing cancer.

3. Traces of Known Carcinogen in Kids Tea


Most notably, our tests showed that samples of Celestial Seasonings’ Sleepy Time Kids Goodnight 


Grape Tea contained 0.26 ppm of Propachlor, a known carcinogen.  


Simon Says: "When you look at Sleepytime, it's the #1 SKU within Celestial. We 
introduced Sleepytime for Kids - and I have 4 kids - and they have trouble sleeping at 


night."


-  Irwin Simon on CNBC 5/27/2012


Propachlor is listed in the Pesticide Action Database as a “bad actor” chemical, a carcinogen, and a 


developmental or reproductive toxin. 


Source: PAN Database.


Note: information for many chemicals is incomplete and may not be fully representative of effects on humans.


To put it in perspective, the amount of Propachlor detected in the tested sample of Sleepy Time Kids 


Goodnight Grape Tea was 420% higher than the limit prescribed by the EU for dried teas.

We also believe that the children’s tea sample violates California’s pesticide regulations, meaning that 


Hain may have to recall the product rather than risk regulatory censure or lawsuits from plaintiffs’ 
attorneys.


In 1986, California voters approved an initiative to address their growing concerns about exposure to 
toxic chemicals. That initiative became the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, 


better known by its original name of Proposition 65. Proposition 65 requires the State of California to 


publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. Businesses 


are required to put warning labels on products that contain listed chemicals in amounts exceeding the 
prescribed safe harbor limits.


According to the Proposition 65 list published by the State of California's Office of Environmental Health 
Hazard Assessment, there is no safe harbor limit for Propachlor, the chemical found in tested samples 


of Celestial Seasonings’ Sleepy Time Kids Goodnight Grape Tea.  We believe that it is therefore 


illegal for the Company to sell such tea in California without one or both of the following explicit 


warning labels: 


“WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer”


OR


"WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth 


defects or other reproductive harm.”

Source: California Proposition 65 list.


Unlike many environment statutes, Proposition 65 provides for private enforcement. Therefore, if the 


California State Attorney General or local authority takes no action after 60 days’ notice, private citizens 


(i.e., plaintiffs’ lawyers) may file suit to enforce the Proposition. Predictably, a cottage industry has

Independent testing of a sample of Celestial Seasonings’ Sleepy Time Kids Goodnight Grape Tea 


detected traces of Propachalor, for which no safe harbor limit exists.  In our view, the Company is 
therefore stuck between a rock and a hard place. The failure to include a product warning exposes the 


Company to significant litigation risk, while including the warnings may do an equal or greater amount of 


harm to the brand.  


Independent testing also detected traces of Propargite in six other Celestial Seasonings samples, including 


100% of the teas we tested from the Wellness Tea category. According to the Proposition 65 list 


published by State of California, there is no safe harbor limit for Propargite, which is classified in the 


database as a known carcinogen and developmental toxin.


Source: California Proposition 65 list.


The following tea samples contained traces of Propargite, which we believe renders such teas illegal to 


sell in California under Proposition 65 without one or both of the explicit warning levels we mentioned 


above.

5. FDA Warnings Echo Lab Findings


Our findings do not come as a surprise given that the FDA has issued two warning letters to Celestial 


Seasonings for quality control issues.  An FDA warning letter is a notification that the FDA considers 


one or more “products, practices, processes, or other activities to be in violation of the FDCA...”

The FDA states explicitly that “warning letters should only be issued for violations of regulatory 


significance.”  


The FDA sent a warning letter to Hain in December 2010 regarding manufacturing at its Celestial 


Seasonings factory in Boulder, Colorado.   Specifically, the FDA found inadequate quality control 


measures at its food processing facility and that the Company was not keeping proper records for 


maintenance, cleaning and sanitation of equipment.


The FDA also sent a warning letter to Hain on August 17, 2007 threatening the Company with regards to 


the use of the sweetener stevia in Celestial Seasonings tea.  Specifically, the FDA warned Hain that there 


was not sufficient evidence showing stevia was safe for use in food products and that “literature reports 


have raised safety concerns about the use of stevia, including concerns about control of blood sugar and 


the effects of reproductive, cardiovascular and renal systems.”


Celestial Seasonings’ FDA warning letters echo our findings that almost all of the tea samples we tested 


violate federal regulations.  In our opinion, an audit of some of Hain’s prominent consumer products 


shows a pattern of quality control issues and questionable labeling practices which indicate that the 


Company is not only significantly overvalued, but that it faces significant risk of civil and regulatory 


liability.


At the very least, we expect that when consumers learn the truth about Celestial Seasonings products, they 


will quickly migrate to readily available substitutes.  Declining or even sluggish sales from Hain’s most 


recognizable brand would be devastating to the growth story management is selling to investors.

II. NECTAR OF THE GODS?


Greek Gods Yogurt, which we estimate accounted for around 37% of Hain’s 2012 internal revenue 


growth, is marketed as a traditional style Greek yogurt.  We believe that this product is yet another 


example of the Company’s habit of deceptively marketing products to consumers. Recent sales trends 


suggest that brand equity is rapidly eroding, as consumers learn that Greek Gods is not really Greek 


yogurt.     


Greek Gods' "Authentic" and "Traditional" Claims


Recently, Greek-style yogurts have skyrocketed in popularity because of their perceived health benefits; 


they are repeatedly strained to yield 12-15 grams of protein per 150 gram serving while whittling fat 


down to 0-3 grams per serving.  The straining process also gives Greek yogurt its trademark thickness.


Hain promotes Greek Gods Yogurt as an 'authentic' Greek-style yogurt.  A closer look at the nutrition 


label and ingredients suggests that Greek Gods Yogurt is Greek only in name.  Greek Gods contains 


around two-thirds less protein than authentic Greek style yogurts and 400% more fat.

Hain’s Greek Gods yogurt is high in fat and low in protein.  Authentic Greek-style is low in fat and 


high in protein.   The problems do not end there.  


The third ingredient in Greek Gods yogurt, Pectin, is notably absent from its higher quality competitors.

Pectin is a thickening agent that we believe Greek Gods uses to artificially achieve the thick consistency 


of more authentic Greek-style yogurts.

While pectin is typically included as an ingredient in the fruit component of a yogurt, most authentic Greek style 


yogurts do not include pectin as a thickening agent in the yogurt itself.   See http://www.befoodsmart.com/blog/the-

Investors should be wary.  Consumers recently sued General Mills for fraud and deceptive labeling for 


marketing Greek yogurt that used an artificial thickening agent (milk protein concentrate) rather than 


employing a traditional straining technique.  Plaintiffs cried foul, saying that the product was neither


Greek yogurt nor yogurt.  In December 2012, the presiding judge dismissed the suit without prejudice and 


referred the controversy to the FDA.  


We believe that Hain is at risk of incurring a similar lawsuit for its use of pectin in Greek Gods yogurt.  It 


is only a matter of time before class-action attorneys and consumers notice that Greek Gods does not have 


the nutritional profile of an authentic Greek-style yogurt. 


Nielson data shows that Greek Gods sales growth has plummeted to 25% at the end of calendar 2012 


versus 80% only twelve months prior. We expect this rapid deceleration to continue in fiscal 2013 as 


consumers wise up.

III. VEGGIE TALES


Sensible Portions is Hain’s other star product line responsible for an estimated 40% of the Company’s


2012 internal revenue growth.  The Company labels its products as “Garden Vegetable Chips”, "Garden 


Veggie Straws", and "Apple Straws" which are "better for you" and part of a "healthier diet."  As the 


Company's lawyerly website explains, "The key to a healthy diet is moderation... if you eat less, you 


consume fewer calories."


The Sensible Portions marketing strategy seems designed to pitch "Veggie" Straws and "Apple" Straws as 


a substitute for fruits and vegetables and the nutritional benefits they provide. 


"Veggie" Straws


A sensible solution to eating your vegetables?


However, these products contain little of the nutritional value of the fruits and vegetables they ostensibly


replace.  One would think that a product line marketed as "better for you" would include ingredients and 


nutritional content on their website - but not Sensible Portions.  We believe that the Company is reluctant 


to flaunt the nutritional content of the veggie straws because the primary ingredients are a far cry from


healthy and nutritious fruits or vegetables.

We realize that potatoes are technically vegetables, but your yoga instructor would not see it that way.   Hain appears to be
pitching its products as a substitute for apples, spinach and tomatoes, not as a substitute for potatoes and other starches.

Leading ingredients of Sensible Portions products include processed flour, starch, sugar, salt, and oil, with 


minimal vegetable/fruit content as evidenced by the lack of vitamins. Spinach is a top source of vitamin 


A.  Yet, "Garden Veggie" Chips provide 0% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A despite also 


having "spinach powder" as an ingredient. Although apples are a good source of vitamin C, "Apple" 


Straws are "not a significant source of vitamin C."


-Veggie Chips not a source of Vitamin A. - Apple Straws not a source of Vitamin C.


Simon Says: "The consumer is educated, reads labels, and really looking for ingredients"


-Irwin Simon, CNBC Fast Money (10/4/2012)


In addition to rising consumer awareness about the true nutritional value of Sensible Portions products,


Veggie Straws are vulnerable to competition.  During our visit to Whole Foods, the store appeared to only 


carry the 365 brand of veggie straws and chips.  The ingredients looked virtually identical to those of 


Sensible Portions and they were advertised for a fraction of the price of Hain’s product. 


With questionable health benefits and so many competitors entering the market, it is no wonder growth 


has sharply decelerated (See Section VIII of this report).

IV. ORGANIC PASTA SAMPLES CONTAINED PESTICIDES


Independent lab tests also reveal that samples of one of Hain’s most lucrative organic brands, DeBoles 


pasta, contained evidence of conventional pesticide use.      


The DeBoles website states that its two leading brands, Organic Artichoke Flour Pasta and Organic 


Whole Wheat Flour Pasta, are USDA certified organic, which are grown without the use of potentially 


harmful herbicides or pesticides.  


Yet lab tests detected that multiple samples of Deboles ‘certified USDA organic’ pasta contained trace 


amounts of chemicals associated with conventional pesticide use, including MGK-264 and piperonyl 


butoxide (PBO), both of which are classified by the EPA as Group C Possible Human Carcinogens.  


We do not know if such trace amounts are sufficient to strip DeBoles pasta of its organic label, as such 


decisions are left to Qualified Assurance International, DeBoles’ organic certifier.  However, we do 


believe that even small amounts of pesticides may deter customers from paying a premium price for 


DeBoles pasta.  


DeBoles organic pasta is among the priciest pasta on the shelf.  It’s even more expensive than other 


certified organic brands.  We believe that consumers pay the 2-3x premium price because they believe 


the product is pesticide-free.


We are not surprised that pesticides crept into certified organic pasta because like Celestial Seasonings, 


DeBoles has struggled with quality control problems in the past.   In July 2010, Hain recalled DeBoles 


-free pasta,

with the gluten-free pasta, thus presenting a danger to children with gluten allergies.   In August 2012, 


DeBoles recalled seven gluten free pastas due to the presence of undeclared wheat in the products.  


Evidence of conventional pesticide use in organic pasta ingredients can only further hurt Hain’s 


credibility, and with cheaper organic pasta substitutes so readily available, we expect to see significant 


brand erosion.


V. DECEPTIVELY LABELLED PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS?


In May 2011, consumers filed a federal class action lawsuit against Hain for deceptively labeling its Jason 


and Avalon Organics cosmetic products as ‘organic’ when such products are largely comprised of non-


organic ingredients. 


Plaintiffs alleged that Hain knowingly deceived consumers into paying a premium price for cosmetics by 


prominently placing an ‘organic’ label on the top of its products even though most of the ingredients were 


not organic.  In one striking example, plaintiffs pointed out that in the Jason Ester-C Super-C Cleanser 


Gentle Face Wash, which the Company had labeled as organic, only one of the nineteen ingredients 


listed on the back of the label was certified organic.  


Hain’s legal defense of the lawsuit is insulting to customers.  In a motion to dismiss the class action, the 


Company’s attorneys claimed that including the word ‘organic’ on the front of the product does not 


refer to the product or the ingredients, and that any reasonable customer would understand that its 


products are not organic by looking at the ingredient list.  We find this laughable.  The whole purpose of 


labeling a product as ‘organic’ front and center is to convince customers that a product is organic.  


Although the case is still pending, we believe that the lawsuit presents another data point for investors to 


consider in which Hain has deceptively labeled a consumer product to appear healthier than it actually is.  


We believe that such disreputable practices, coupled with the Company’s quality control issues, will soon 


catch up with Hain.  


VI. SPECTRUM ORGANICS – MORE FDA PROBLEMS


In 2010 the FDA warned Hain over deceptive labeling with regards to its Spectrum Organic All 


Vegetable Shortening. 


The FDA alleged that Hain’s label misrepresented that the product was “cholesterol free” and “naturally 


cholesterol free” when it was not.  The FDA also chastised the Company for stating on the vegetable 


shortening label that it contained “less saturated fat than butter” when there was no basis to make such a 


claim.   The FDA concluded that the claims “good source of … monosaturated fat” and “0 grams trans 


fat” were also made without a proper foundation. 


Such accusations have a familiar ring to them.  In our opinion, Hain has deceptively labeled a variety of 


products, making it no surprise that the Company has incurred three FDA warning letters since 2007 for


quality control issues and/or consumer misrepresentations.

VII. ACQUISITIONS CONCEAL ANEMIC GROWTH


Analysts point to Hain's double-digit growth over the last decade as evidence that the Company deserves 
a higher trading multiple.  Such high p/e multiples are typically reserved for business with growth rates of 


10% or more per year.  But if we exclude the first year sales impact of acquisitions and dispositions, 


we estimate that Hain's core business grew internally by an anemic 3.2% per year, from 2001 to 2011, a 
dismal performance record when compared to its organic/natural food peers.


Sources: Nutrition Business Journal; for Hain data, refer to the Glaucus estimates and footnotes on the following page.


The table below, which will not be found in any management presentation or sell-side research report, 


unmasks Hain's internal growth rate for the years 2001 through 2011.  As we can see on the far right 


column, the average internal growth rate for this period was 3.2% per annum.

Internal Sales Growth - Hain vs. Industry
21





















































www.glaucusresearch.comTHE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. | NASDAQ: HAIN


The table above, while admittedly complex, is critical.  To calculate internal growth, we first calculate an 


adjusted sales base by taking reported sales for the fiscal year and subtracting any sales attributable to an 


acquisition in the twelve months after it was acquired.  Most such acquired sales cover two fiscal years as 
they are completed mid-year.  Internal growth is then calculated by taking the adjusted sales base divided 


by the previous year's reported sales minus one.  Supporting data for these calculations can be found in 


Appendix II.  The critical takeaway is that acquisitions have masked anemic growth from 2001 to 2011.  


Strip away the gimmickry and Hain appears to have grown at a paltry 3.2%, indicating that the Company 
is undeserving of the p/e multiple at which it currently trades.  


Hain appears to have performed in-line with the organic and natural food category in just one year (2012) 
with an internal growth rate of 7.1%. Yet even this rate is unsustainable as an estimated 84% of the 


growth is attributable to Greek Gods Yogurt, Sensible Portions, and Celestial Seasonings. As discussed


above, we believe that such brands are beset by quality control and/or deceptive labeling issues, which we 


expect will only drive consumers to readily available substitutes. The remaining products appear to 
have grown only 1.2%.

Hain’s Estimated Internal Growth - FY2012 ($ in mms)


Note: FY2012 contains an estimated $168mm of first twelve months sales impact from acquisitions (Daniel's $144mm, Danival
$12mm, Europe's Best $8mm, GG Unique Fiber $1mm, and Cully & Sully $3mm).


Hain not only masks its anemic internal growth rate through acquisitions, but also by using the accounting 


gimmick of retroactively stuffing losses from failed products into ‘discontinued operations.’ 


For example, in Hain’s 2011 10-K, it reported sales of $1,130 million.  Yet by 2012, this 2011 reported 


sales base had mysteriously declined in the 2012 10-K to $1,108 million, a difference of $22 million.  


2011 Reported Sales in 2012 10-K


2011 Reported Sales in 2011 10-K (a $22 million Difference)


It turns out the $22 million of sales axed from the 2011 sales figure was attributable to private-label 


chilled meals and sandwich operations in the United Kingdom, a product line with an operating loss of
$4.5 million.
23





















































www.glaucusresearch.comTHE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. | NASDAQ: HAIN


2011 Discontinued Operations - 2012 10-K


Hain retroactively discontinued sales of such products in 2012 and removed their sales from the 2011 and 


2012 income statement.  By doing so, the Company lowered the sales base for the prior year, artificially 


inflating its 2012 growth rate. 


Put simply, this is an accounting gimmick whereby the Company keeps the credit for a product’s 


successes in 2011 (internal sales growth) yet gets to exclude the same product’s failures (operating losses


and sales declines) from being counted in 2012.  Although this practice is technically permitted, we find it 
deceptive as it artificially boosted the Company’s growth rate by another 2% in 2012. Internal growth is 


easy to come by if one counts the products that grow and excludes the products that fail.


VIII. THE PARTY IS OVER


Although the Company achieved internal growth of 7.1% in 2012, we believe that its internal growth rate 


will more than likely revert to the (anemic) mean of 3% in 2013 because of rapid and significant 


deceleration in sales growth of Greek Gods and Sensible Portions, the two products that accounted for an 


estimated 77% of internal sales growth in 2012.   This trend is reflected in recent Nielson data as well as 


Hain’s recent decision to lower its revenue guidance for fiscal 2013.

www.glaucusresearch.comTHE HAIN CELESTIAL GROUP, INC. | NASDAQ: HAIN


According to recent Nielson data, Hain's yogurt category sales growth has imploded in recent months.  


We believe that this is due to increasing consumer awareness about Greek Gods substandard nutrition 


profile, as well as increased competition from the major expansions of the four authentic players 


(Chobani, Fage, Danone, and General Mills) that control 90% of the Greek yogurt market.  


Likewise, year-over-year growth of Sensible Portions Veggie Straws has fallen to less than 10% in the 


first quarter of FY2013, down sharply from triple digits the year prior.  This trend is reflected in the most 


recent quarter ended December 2012, where management reduced its annual revenue guidance by around 


5% (excluding the Blueprint acquisition). 


In 2012, Hain experienced a temporary growth spurt, which we believe is attributable to the questionable


marketing practices of the Greek Gods Yogurt (not authentic Greek yogurt, in our view) and Veggie 
Straws (not a nutritious alternative to vegetables, in our opinion).  


As such, we believe that Hain’s core business has not, and likely never will, generate the sustainable


double-digit internal growth rates on par with authentic natural and organic food investments.  The 
Company therefore deserves to trade in line with mature packaged food retailers that typically generate 


internal growth rates of 3% per year and not organic food companies like WhiteWave that boast internal 


growth rates of 10-12%.

IX. SIMON SPEAKS! SIMON SELLS.


In our view, cutting corners allows management to sell shares at a high price before the other shoe 


drops in the form of FDA warning letters, attentive plaintiffs attorneys or learned customers.


During the last 21 months, Hain CEO Irwin Simon took advantage of a temporary boost in Hain’s share 
price attributable to the flash-in-the-pan performance of Greek Gods and Sensible Portions to dump $33


million of stock.   From the table below, we see that he sold his stock in eleven tranches, all of which 


appear to have been initiated within hours to 28 trading days after Simon appeared on CNBC to 
tout the growth prospects of his Company.

Investors should be aware.  Simon’s appearances on CNBC appear to be a precursor to a liquidity event. 


Just yesterday, on February 20, 2013, Simon discussed HAIN on CNBC on the same day that he appears 
to have sold $2 million worth of Company stock.


In perhaps the most egregious example, on Monday, May 7, 2012, Simon appeared on Cramer’s “Mad 


Money.” Cramer commended Hain for “knocking it out of the park” on its quarterly earnings, and said 
this is the stock to own for the “healthy eating trend that’s sweeping not only the U.S., but the whole 


world.” 


Simon himself said “Jim, I heard you say we’re a pricey expensive stock...come on, we’re in the early 


innings...what’s happened with the packaged goods companies why are they not growing . . . the 


consumer is moving more and more to healthy products,” (emphasis added). Yet within the next 72 
hours, Simon dumped $4 million of his stock on the public.


Simon Speaks; Simon Sells


The same month as Simon’s October 2012 Mad Money appearance in which he boasted "that's all we do 


is natural and organic foods," Hain completed a major acquisition of a product line with, in our view, 


almost no exposure to the healthy foods market.  


In October 2012, Hain acquired Premier Foods Brands, a primary asset of which was Hartley's, a maker 


of various jam and jelly-related products in the UK. The primary ingredients in Hartley’s products are 
fructose syrup, sugar and a gelling agent (which, in our opinion, play no part in the healthy food 


movement).  Hartley’s jams are expected to comprise 15% of Hain’s sales going forward, further 


evidence that Hain should be valued like a traditional packaged food company, not a leader in natural 


foods and organics.


Any future CNBC appearances by Simon should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

X. VALUATION


We believe that Hain is a traditional packaged foods company masquerading as an organic/healthy foods 


company.  To put into perspective the hype-machine driving the recent appreciation of Hain’s stock 


price, consider that in October 2012 CEO Irwin Simon stated point-blank on CNBC that "all we do is 
natural and organic foods."


9
We believe that this is obviously false.  But the market seems to have bought 


it.  Jim Cramer summed up the general misunderstanding of Hain’s business last summer when he said 


that "Hain Celestial is a pure play on one of the hottest trends out there...the healthy eating theme."
10


Natural and organic pure plays have two characteristics: (i) authentic, nutritious and non-deceptively 


marketed healthy and organic products, and (ii) internal growth rates on par with the natural and organic 


category growth (12% over the past decade).


This report has presented a body of evidence, derived from independent lab tests and other due diligence, 


showing that product lines representing 84% of Hain’s 2012 internal growth and 40% of the Company’s 


Care Products [~4%], Greek Gods [~6%], and Deboles [~1%]), are either not natural/organic or are beset


by quality control issues and/or deceptive labeling practices.  The other 60% of sales, as a group, appears 


to be growing slower than 3% per year, an anemic growth rate compared to peers in the natural and 
organic food category.


We believe that as the Company’s exaggerated claims are exposed, Hain will revert to its historical (and 
anemic) internal growth rate of 3% and its share price will plummet.  There is certainly room to fall.  Hain


appears to be trading at its highest price/book multiple in the last ten fiscal years.


Note: historical high and low price to book ratio from BMO Capital Markets research note dated 1/10/2013.


With a book value of around $22 per share, a return to merely the high end of this historical range would 


imply a fall to $40 per share (a 31% decline from the current stock price).  Likewise, a return to the 


historical mean would imply a stock price of $31.50, a 46% decline from here.

Ultimately, we believe that Hain should trade in line with mature packaged food companies like Campbell 
Soup which have a ~3.5% long term internal growth forecast and trade at around 15.5x 2013 projected 


earnings.  This would imply a stock price of $38, a 35% decline from today’s stock price of $58 per share. 


We believe the market will eventually recognize Hain as a healthy food imposter, as neither its products 


nor its growth rate belong with the authentic healthy food comps.  


By contrast, WhiteWave is an authentic healthy/organic foods company that we consider to be an 


authentic pure-play within the organic/healthy food category.  We directed Eurofins to test samples of 
WhiteWave’s organic, non-GMO and antibiotic free products against their respective claims, and the 


independent lab tests revealed that 100% of WhiteWave’s products came back clean (test results are 


available in Appendix III).  WhiteWave appears to have a suite of authentic USDA organic products that 
is growing sustainably at low double-digit rates.  Compare this to the low single digit internal growth rate 


at Hain for the last decade.  We believe that WhiteWave, not Hain, should trade at a premium price to 


reflect the anticipated boom in healthy and organic foods.  


Given the scarcity of great organic/healthy food companies, we believe that WhiteWave will be the 


company taking advantage of the trend in healthy eating that Irwin Simon was so excited about in his 
CNBC appearances.  Hain, by comparison, should fall back to earth.
