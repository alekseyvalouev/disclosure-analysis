Neoprobe: Did the Pivotal Studies Meet Their Primary Endpoints?

One of the most difficult aspects of investing is the continuous pledge to double-check
assumptions, scrutinize management’s capital deployment plans and second-guess
yourself by examining risk-reward on a dynamic basis.


I’ve been watching Neoprobe (NEOP) for a few years and have never had more than a
tiny position for a few days at a time. When I saw several consecutive bullish analyst
reports and scheduled New York roadshows, I reasoned the company was preparing for a
capital raise. I read the initiations and enjoyed the lofty estimates and high assumed
probability of achieving those estimates.


One thing I didn’t immediately notice was scrutiny of phase III results. Some Phase III data
are cut and dry. Some Phase III data seem cut and dry and are not. I am going to spend
some time showing you why I think both Lymphoseek Phase III trials failed to meet their
primary endpoint. This means what you might think it means – Neoprobe will not receive
FDA approval for Lymphoseek because of what I’m going to outline. This probably
wouldn’t have been brought to light until FDA decision time without my discoveries.


I’ve read every public statement ever made by Neoprobe. Again and again and again.
SEC filings, news releases, presentations, database searches, everything. I started pulling
on this thread when I saw the 1/2010 presentation (viewable at my fund’s website –
msmbcapital.com) and the 12/2010 presentation had different patient sample sizes for
the Phase III NEO03-05 study. Think about that for a second. Clinical trials should have
one sample size. The number of patients enrolled in a study is generally not subject to
change. This time will be different.

In the January 12th, 2010 OneMedPlace presentation, the company notes that n=179
patients were “enrolled for safety” and 158 patients were “evaluated for efficacy”. This is
not the way a clinical trial works. You can’t separate which patients you feel are viable for
safety or efficacy. Everyone has to be in both. This is the ITT (intent-to-treat) principle.
There are deviations from this standard, and we’ll go through them in a minute. But this is
how the process began. The presentation, on page 14, continues to explain that the ITT
population consisted of n=158 and the per-protocol population consisted of n=156. Again,
this flies against the face of my experience and basic clinical science – the ITT population
is always composed of all patients enrolled in the trial. The high p-value of 0.04 for the ITT
group also stuck out at me. That is awfully close to the “limit” of p=0.05. I always get
nervous when a company has a pivotal trial near p=0.05!


With this in mind, in the December 2010 at Neoprobe’s Analyst Day, page 21 indicates,
again, that n=179 patients were “enrolled for safety” (a phrase that makes my head hurt)
and n=136 were “evaluated for efficacy”. Until now, I hadn’t really noted any red flags. But
the clearly changed n=158 to n=136 from presentation to presentation would make even a
colorblind analyst fret.


It was at this point I decided to do a full statistic review of both pivotal trials. The way I see
it, NEO03-05 had three pools of patients: n=179 “ITT” (this is my definition, Neoprobe’s is
“enrolled for safety”), n=158 “modified ITT” (this is my definition, Neoprobe’s is “ITT”) and
n=136 “per-protocol” (this is my definition, Neoprobe’s is sometimes “ITT” and sometimes
not). Defining ITT is important. It usually has one definition: all patients assigned to a
treatment group. In other words, patients who have been screened, are eligible, gave
consent and have been processed as enrolled in the study should be in the ITT group.
This is relatively “holy” in clinical science. Anything past this point is unusual and the FDA
doesn’t appreciate strange ITT definitions (witness the recent Biomimetics debacle). Some
companies try to throw out patients that get lost to follow-up. This is the most common
type of removed patient from ITT to mITT (or if the company insists on referring to it as
ITT). Similar types of patients include patients enrolled but never randomized, patients
who never got any treatment, etc.


So who were the missing ITT to mITT patients in the Lymphoseek studies? The company
explained very carefully on a March 12th, 2010 conference call (the transcript of this call is
not publicly available) that “The ITT population was prospectively designed as patients
who consented to participate in the clinical study, who were injected with Lymphoseek,
and who provided at least one lymph node that contained the vital blue dyes”. The

https://seekingalpha.com/article/276434-neoprobe-did-the-pivotal-studies-meet-their-primary-endpoints 3/26


company has confirmed that all n=21 “missing” patients were those that did not provide a
blue dye node. Should these patients have been included in the ITT analysis? Let’s put
that in the back of our heads while we go to another related topic.


Since I can remember, I've been doing my own statistics with company clinical trials, when
possible. There’s no point in trusting a company to calculate a p-value when you can do it
yourself. In the Analyst Day presentation referred to earlier, Neoprobe explains the
statistical method with which they calculated the primary endpoint. It’s all well and good to
say “the primary endpoint is concordance”, but what was the null hypothesis, the statistical
formula used, etc. That information was made available by Neoprobe – the null hypothesis
was that concordance was 90%, or 0.9. Rejecting the null hypothesis would require the
entire one-sided tail to be greater than (to the right of) 0.9. The Exact Binomial Test, also
called the Clopper-Pearson test was used. Calculating the primary endpoint using the
Clopper-Pearson method computes a lower bound of 0.901. That’s right, Neoprobe’s
lower bound had to be greater than 0.900 and it came in at 0.901. What good luck they
must have! One non-concordant node would have resulted in NEO03-05 failing to meet its
primary endpoint.


So let’s go back to the n=21 patients that were excluded from this study. N=158/179 (for a
difference of n=21) results in blue dye node identification rate of 88%. The literature
suggests a blue dye node identification rate of 95% to 100% (Chintamani et al. 2011.
100%, Shirah et al. 2011. 99.1%, Narui et al. 2010. 99%, Krikanova et al. 2010. 95%,
Mathelin et al. 2009. 99%). Why were Neoprobe’s studies so far below the normal blue
dye node identification rate?


It’s obvious to me that this open label protocol biased the concordance data and the
patients who did not provide a blue dye node should be in the ITT group. This calculation
would result both pivotal trials to fail (get a Clopper-Pearson calculator and check for
yourself!). It’s very rare to not find a blue dye node. My guess is the clinicians were trying
for the best data (don’t forget a few centers with long-time ties to Neoprobe enrolled many
patients), and patients who weren’t clearly concordant were thrown out. When you can
clearly see which patients are concordant, and which patients are not, you can throw out
the bad ones and keep the good ones. That’s what happened here. It’s the only
explanation which satisfies the below-average blue dye identification rate, the curiously
high concordance rate (isn’t a non-blue patient who has positive Lymphoseek nodes non-
concordant?), the strange p-values, the lack of disclosure on these patient groups and the
lack of a peer-reviewed publication. Not even the ASCO posters have this data (shame on
ASCO).

Comments (93)


Physicians I've spoken with who do SLNB agree that you generally make a small incision
in the axilla and pluck the "hot" nodes with the assistance of the gamma probe. Did the
Neoprobe investigators just excise those nodes and not look carefully for the blue nodes?
Think about this. There is bias in this protocol if the physicians weren't forced to search
deep for blue nodes. This would explain the high amount of no-blue node patients.


The surgical process here allowed for the assurance of a successful trial, regardless of the
true results. This is called poor assay sensitivity and clinical trials should be designed with
as much sensitivity as possible. It should not be possible to bias a well-designed clinical
trial. Instead, surgeons who measured node radioactivity counts could also clearly see the
blue dye status of a node. Clinicians who excised one or two high-count “hot” nodes that
were not blue could have just stopped looking for blue nodes and thrown the patient out of
the study. This would have helped Neoprobe’s results. Remember, just a few nodes
difference makes it a pass or fail. Whether or not it happened is something we’ll never
know. The idea that it could have happened is more than reason enough to say this was
not a well-conducted study and that the n=21 (and similar n= in NEO03-09) should be
counted in the ITT population. If one does that, both studies fail. Two failed studies = no
approval.


I know this is a highly technical topic that most aren’t used to, and I will try to take as many
questions as I can, but recall my primary responsibility is not to my readers. I have a day
job! Also, if you want your questions answered, a little bit of an open mind as well as good
nature will go a long way. Even the best investors are right just 60% of the time, and
there’s a good chance that’s neither you nor myself. I can always stand to be corrected,
and I’m never afraid of admitting I’m wrong. Flexibility is a key to success in my business,
and I have often changed my mind in the past. With that said, hopefully we can learn and
profit with each other. Good luck!

Marty, every time you blog about Neoprobe you selectively pick and choose a few items that you can twist into
something other than they are.


During the NEO3-05 trial Neoprobe was notified of a discrepancy at two clinical sites. They discovered that the
investigators had diluted Lymphoseek 20-40 times higher than the protocol called for. Neoprobe then consulted with
the FDA and the entire matter was publicly discussed in detail, including investor conference calls (which you also
missed apparently).


You claimed that you read their SEC filings, "again and again and again". No Marty, you didn't. If you had then you
would've been aware of this years ago. The FDA and NEOP shareholders were aware of it. Why weren't you?


What you failed to tell everyone in your blog is that after reviewing the NEO3-05 trial data the FDA agreed that the
trial had indeed met all endpoints, even after accounting for the discrepancy. In fact, the NDA then encouraged
Neoprobe to move forward with their Lymphoseek NDA filing for anatomical delineation claims, based SOLELY on the
data from NEO3-05. This was ALSO in the same SEC filings that you overlooked, after reading them "again and
again".


Seriously Marty, your cries of "Wolf! Wolf!" every other week is becoming comical. Short the stock if you wish. But
attempting to justify your decision by twisting fact into fiction changes nothing. Trying to convince others that you're
right without giving them "the rest of the story" is deceptive.


You claim that you're "never afraid of admitting you're wrong". I proved you wrong on many, many issues in your
previous "Wolf, Wolf" piece. Check out my comments, most of which you ignored once I proved you wrong
(seekingalpha.com/artic...).


Lymphoseek NDA submission soon Marty... very soon! :)

Author’s reply »  Thanks again for your interest in my comments. 
Discrepancies in clinical trials cannot be excluded. They count. 
ITT is a simple concept with a simple definition. You can't exclude patients just because you don't want to fail
your study.


I appreciate your enthusiasm but I'm not here to attack you or anyone else. I'm here for the truth!


27 Jun 2011, 08:57 PM


TheTruth2
The truth is that the FDA has been aware of the ITT exceptions for months and despite those exceptions has
agreed that all NEO3-5 end points were met. Another non-issue... just like the comparator issue. You really
should have just stuck to the market success debate. This non-approval angle is going nowhere. Now when
Lympho is approved, your market non-success angle will have less credibility.

Author’s reply »  If you say so. To me it's unclear if those patients should have been in ITT or not. The FDA
has either changed their mind or been unclear on this topic many times. Check out BMTI. It's always a risk
when you're doing something unorthodox. I'm sure Neoprobe will say the FDA told them to do it, but if the
FDA told you to walk off of a bridge...?

As far as SeraCare goes, my prediction is that for some reason MBSM (Marty) will pull the offer to purchase,
citing some off the wall reason. But not before he sells out whatever long position he has at the pumped

cover the short. 
What a scam.

That's the "Duh" statement of the month, if not year. Of course you're not interested in the long term prospects
of NEOP - since when does a short, especially one paying monthly interest through the nose, care what
happens to a stock in the long run?


Your sole purpose for bashing these biotechs is to attempt to push the price down as fast as possible and
maximize your profits, using SA as your bully pulpit to spread FUD about each stock.

(isn’t a non-blue patient who has positive Lymphoseek nodes non-concordant?) - Martin Shkreli


No. That assumption is incorrect. Clinical design protocol requires the investigational agent (Lymphoseek) to
demonstrate acceptable concordance with the FDA approved agent (Blue Dye). Lymphoseek had 100% concordence
in NEO3-05.

What you're talking about is called REVERSE concordence. In the reverse concordence study Blue Dye missed 40%
of the nodes detected by Lymphoseek, 25% of which contained metastatic disease. Here's the PR for you:

Blue dye was the truth standard in this noninferior design. How can lymphoseek be in accordance with
something that wasn't detected by truth standard design? It is basically impossible to measure efficacy on
these patients. If anything lymphoseek is being short changed because you could evaluate with lymphoseek
being truth standard basis.

Confidence Interval := CI = p +/- zv * sqrt{ p(1-p)/n }  
where zv is the "z-value" or degree of confidence required in accepting the Confidence Interval as statistically
significant, and where p is the proportion of interest, here the fraction ( nodes detected by Lymphoseek ) divided by (
nodes detected by blue dye). Ref: graphpad.com/quickcalc...


Data for the NEO3-05 study are given in Neoprobe's publication www.neoprobe.com/press....


In order to reproduce and evaluate your work, we need the value for zv that the FDA uses and that you must
necessarily use in your computation. I'm surprised you don't provide your readers with this information so that we can
check your work.


I can work out a value for zv that you must have used based on your conclusion that "Calculating the primary
endpoint using the Clopper-Pearson method computes a lower bound of 0.901. That’s right, Neoprobe’s lower bound
had to be greater than 0.900 and it came in at 0.901. " But I would like to see that value in print somewhere in FDA
documentation. Presumably, your computation applies to the per-person data and not the per-node data - you don't
tell us which data set you're using.


I'm surprised you don't make it easier for your readers to reproduce your computation. In science, reproducibility is
everything, and if you try to bedazzle or frustrate us with terminology and arcana instead of presenting a full and clear
picture then your work is without force. Give us the rest of your assumptions so that your work can be checked.

Apparently the Phase III abstract is here:

Background: Intraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) evaluation is widely used for staging clinically node-negative
breast CA and melanoma.


[99mTc]Tilmanocept (TcT) is a novel CD206 receptor-targeted (intra-nodal CD206+ RE cells) radiopharmaceutical
designed for ILM of nodes (LNs) with anatomic nexuses to the tumor bed.


We report the results of a Phase III, multicenter trial designed to assess the ILM performance of TcT vs the approved
standard, vital blue dye (VBD) in both melanoma and breast CA patients (pts).


+ So clearly they say """ Intraoperative lymphatic mapping """


BUT THEN in the reply to the Citizens Petition they say:


""" Neoprobe’s regulatory-appropriate clinical trials were designed to achieve an indication for “anatomical delineation
of lymphatic tissue,”


not “sentinel lymph node mapping.” """"

You know, Shkreli, it was your soul mate in business, George Bush, who said, "You can fool some of the people all of
the time - and those are the ones I want to focus on." It's clear that your purpose is to obfuscate, not to inform, and
that you are uninterested in objective analysis.


You won't take one minute to provide the value for zv that you used, and I can understand that because I know that
hedge fund managers like you are busy counting profits and laughing at the little people - fools, wouldn't you say? -
who work for a living and invest their money with ambitious companies like NEOP.


Rather than do anything positive it's easier for you to fabricate a set of lies and misinformation and take profits during
the ensuing pandemonium. I guess it's your nature, like a little gecko.

I hope you publish some more mendacious and shallow articles, Shkreli. You can count on me to be here exposing
you as a liar, poseur and scumbag.


Your computations are purposely obscured and intended to mislead. The fact that you will not show your work laid out
in clear detail or provide a complete set of input data in support of your conclusions makes your work immediately
suspect. Come on, big mouth, show us your work so that we can learn and profit together.

For reasons unknown (cash trading hands?) GoDaddy has put Marty's website back up despite it still violating
copyright protected information, and therefore GoDaddy's TOS......they're just as bad as the rest of the
registrars it would seem.....ok, I take that back....although the links to NEOP's ASCO slides still appear on his
page, they're dead, therefore it would appear the site is now in line with the TOS after all.

Marty,


I am trying to understand your TRUE motivation here. IF your goal is simply to profit from your shorting of NEOP
stock, (don't think that educating the masses is your intention) and if you feel that the trials have been poorly run and
Lymphoseek won't get approved and is worhtless if it did wouldn't it make much more business sense to have kept
your mouth shut, let the stock go higher (so you could short it at a higher price obviously) and then let the FDA pull
the rug out from under NEOP when the NDA was submitted? If I felt that I knew something that would cause APPL to
go down dramatically, would I tell anyone? Hell no! I just short the living crap out of it and eventually watch the money
roll in when everyone else finally figured out what I knew.


So what is real your real motivation??? Please respond as I would love to know.

Mr. Shkreli, after reading most of your posts, I believe that I would sum up your attitude toward Lymphoseek as a drug
that the FDA needs to reject due to its deficiencies and that sulfur colloid and blue dye are adequate and have proven
useful for SLNM. If this is your belief then you may be condemning someone you love or even yourself. To explain
what I mean I would like to apply what I call the Scalpel Test towards you and your opposing attitudes to the use of
Lymphoseek.  
Let's say that doctors tell you that your son or daughter has cancer and that the best course of action to make sure
that they have eliminated the threat of it spreading is to do SLNM. In addition, let's say that your doctor has the choice
of using the Sulfur Colloid and Blue Dye combo or if it were available Lymphoseek. From what you have stated your
choice is the combo. How sad. You would subject a child or yourself to a fifty year old drug that offers terrible pain
upon injection. Have you ever talked to anyone who went through the procedure or any of the staff that are the blunt
of the fury produced by the pain of sulfur colloid? Besides the obvious discomfort there is the fact that the colloid
doesn't always exit the injection site so the patient is required to move around and massage the area of injection in
the hopes that the drug will move in time for the scheduled operation. Adding insult to injury is the blunt fact that larger
numbers of lymph nodes than necessary must be cut out to make sure that the surgeon has got what he needs of the
cancer's spread. Oh, and yes this trauma might still end in death as collateral damage in getting that tumors tidbits. 
As far myself, I will go with Neoprobe's choice. Why shouldn't I have faith in a product of a company that was a
pioneer in SLNM? Do you think that they might just know a thing or two about this field? Furthermore, why shouldn't I
use a state of the art drug that doesn't leave you in shock due to it's side affects. Moreover, Lymphoseek helps
expedite a lower level of radiation quicker so that you don't end up as a radiation reservoir similar to your combo's
legacy. Finally, when it comes to the life of someone I love, I have enough trust in the Phase III results to demand that
the doctor use the new drug instead of the more volatile older methods. Why have this faith. Easy. In making such a
decision reverse or turn the tables on the opposing elements. So now Lymphoseek is the original item that the

elements of the combo must be tested against. From the prior testing we pretty well know the results of such reverse
testing. 
Now fate has a funny way of intervening in daily life and you may be required to say the word that decide the life or
death of someone with cancer. Choose wisely and not be cursed.

...or they just want to destroy value because of the limited volume traded as per NEOP!!  
Anyway, in our case the only positive effect I can see is that your action is avoiding a 'bubble effect' for this
stock or causing a 'soft landing'. Both cases play also against your interest....!  
Go long and you make more money, but again then you need to put down cash you might not have....shorting
you don't need all that money you need for going long....the comments about the future o f NEOP in my

This entire episode has been so riddled with fraud that it boggles the mind that everyone could not immediately
perceive Shkreli's motivation and fraudulent comments. Also, anyone who is the least bit qualified as an investor
would do a little research into Mr. Shkreli's history and immediately realize he has absolutely no credibility. As for me, I
am a former health care correspondent and now I manage a family trust. I have been taught and have over a decades
experience in investigative journalism. I have uncovered fraud at the state level in life sciences operations in PA, and
am literally a pro at spotting fraud.

Dear long investors a few days ago I have written in "Seekingalpha" the following statement in order to prevent further
uncovered short selling:


"Give the order to your bank or broker that you do not allow securities lending with NEOP stocks in your deposit. If
they have done so (actually they do without asking) they will have to immediately ask the stocks (lent for shorting)
back.....anyway I strongly feel that the short traders are not having easy time sofar...in a very few days we will be

Answer from Martin Shkreli:


"When shorts are paying large interest rates to borrow your stock, you shouldn't try to limit it - you should probably try
to understand why these folks are so sure that selling NEOP at 3.50 is a good idea"


Following the intrinsec aspect of this answer it means that this is the fair, legal and transparent way to hijack the short
sellers....this is the open door we left to this person(s) to enable him/them to lower the stock pricing!! Sad to say, but
we are the cause of our concern. Indeed, it is due to our "passivity" towards our banks and brokers......

Is Cyclacel running a Clinical Trial where an FDA non approved drug is being used as comparator? I think the
comparator is an off label drug... 
Reason I mention is because I think there was a debate here that FDA doesnt allow non-approved drugs in Clinical
studies as a comparator.

I think it would be extremely important to know if the original FDA reviewers on Lymphoseek who according to
management, agreed fully on this trial design,are they the same reviewers who will make final approval decision on
this product.. 
There has been alot of changes in FDA since these trials first started. 
If a new crew is reviewing Lymphoseek,that could be of some concern to ponder. 
I have been long Lymphoseek for awhile but I am always proactive in gathering any new info I can,good or bad about
my investments. 
Never be complacent when its your own money on the line..

Nice call on your short. Does the approval of SC in breast cancer have any bearing on your argument that
Lymphoseek cannot be approved because it was not compared to the SOC (SC and blue dye)?


Pharmalucence apparently didn't run their trial for SC against the SOC either, just against blue dye. IMO, that
argument just went out the window. Appreciate your thoughts.

Great call on the NEOP short. Question: Does the Pharmalucence approval have any bearing on your opinion that
Lymphoseek cannot be approved because the trial was run against blue dye only and not the SOC SC and blue dye?


Their trial was run against blue dye only as well, the only approved SOC at the time. That would seem to me to
negate your argument. Appreciate your opinion .


23 Jul 2011, 03:40 PM


Martin Shkreli, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Thanks for your question. I think the FDA expanded the label for the already-approved SC for SLND
due to the large amount of well-controlled studies of both the combination of SC+BD as well as against BD.


The FDA knows that the combination has been the SOC for quite a long time. I wonder if the recent CP helped remind
them that the body of evidence for SC is vast, especially relative to Lymphoseek.


With respect to Lymphoseek, I still contend the studies did not meet their primary endpoints, and were certainly not
controlled against the best standard of care. I further still believe sales will be quite low. What the recent action means
is anyone's guess but I don't see a material difference in the chances of Lymphoseek success.

Author’s reply »  I think that is a simplistic and self-serving way to analyze the situation. Sulfur colloid has been used
for over a decade as the standard of care in SLND. The studies reviewed included SC+BD, SC vs. BD and SC alone.
There is a very rich history of how physicians use SC+BD. This is the current standard of care and the past standard
of care. Approval just codifies what we already knew - SC+BD is always used to identify the SLN. It's impossible to tell
if Lymphoseek works unless they run a study of SC+BD versus Lymphoseek. For obvious reasons, this is unlikely to
happen. Approval of Lymphoseek is unlikely to happen. That's not my problem, FDA's problem or anyone else's but
Neoprobe's.


Hope that helps!

I'm sorry to keep beating what should have been a dead horse, but why would the FDA not approve Lympho
just because something else works too? Ibuprofin and Aceteminophin both make your headache go away.
Having one on the market doesnt mean the other wont be approved. The only concern of the FDA should be
does the drug WORK? Does the drug harm? They shouldn't (and aren't) in the business of deciding whether
or not to approve a drug based on its competition. Show me where Lympho fails to work as promised or has a
safety problem to speak of and I may reconsider my position.

I am struck by Mr. Shkreli's descritpion of the FDA as a "friendly" organization. Regulatory agencies are expected to
be open to citizens' inquiries and interests, to be sure, but "friendly"? That's an odd word. to say the least. I think he
used that word in a preemptive attempt to mask his T-text in which he claimed(bragged?) to have "friends" who are
current and former FDA officials. That remark was quite telling.

I disagree with alot of Marty's comments but he has a right to his opinion and he has opened my eyes and many
others to at least dispute his comments and do our own due diligence. 
Though we may not like his tactics,as long as he is within the boundaries of the law in what he is doing,then nothing
we can do about it.  
Maybe certain regulations will be changed because of him and he will live in infamy. 
In actuality,until FDA decides on Lymphoseek we dont know honestly who is wrong or right..I am leaning towards
Lymphoseek getting approval and capturing the majority of the market,especially with Cardinal Health as a US
partner..

I am a patient [also known as a "loved one"] who has been doing research for three years on this "standard" blue dye
issue


How many of you are aware that some patients were 
subjected to something like this NEO study without consent??


It's simple - use the NEO --find the node, 
ignore the blue and the patient 
who goes home without blue urine wonders why???? 
Could it be that blue wasn't used at all????


I have limited investment savvy about long v short - 
but I do get it that 
Long= make $ 
Short = make $


Hang on to your hats - this is coming close to  
not being at the conjecture stage because  
I'm still investigating--so don't go get a lawyer yet!!


Marty - I will be at your website soon to see if there 
is a contact #  
I would very much like to speak with you  
Or if your email is available, I will email you with subject heading  
"Not So Blue"


We need to talk~

"How many of you are aware that some patients were

This is the giveaway sentence in a previous posting. This is the red flag that tells you not to take seriously what was
posted. What is this in reference to? As it is worded, the poster makes no claim that what he is talking about has
anything to do with Neoprobe. There is no factual evidence regarding anything provided. Being an investor is
fascinating as we can clearly see that the free market is not a free market at all as there is still virtually unlimited

tampering with the value of equities that has nothing to do with market forces or facts. The Neoprobe vs Shkreli
adventure is just one example.

Your criticism might be warranted in one respect and I take no 
offense. I stand guilty of not being more specific-by not identifying my posture on this subject of Neop. 
During investigations- a person tends to speak in generalities so what I said is "subjected to something LIKE this
Neop 
study without consent" This was not to suggest it happened in the Neop study.


I happened on this site by way of a lengthy research on the sentinel node biopsy procedure itself and radioisotopes
etc. 
I do not know Marty at all - but do tend to see his argument- that a comparative study must have a standard contrast
agent approved by FDA in order to compare a new/better/safer one etc.


What troubles me is that Neop states that the "other" SC produced fatalities. That's pretty strong stuff and I would
think they should support that with a link to some litigation somewhere? I consented to SC for one procedure and was
never told death was a risk- Do you know anyone that was??


Behind all devices and drugs - there are investors 
and I make no issue against that - wishing them all 
good fortune in their ventures.  
Prior to Neop entrance to the mkt- there were SNB studies using the combo SC/VBD and one of those trials is still
ongoing - 
so if the survival rate is not yet conclusive - or if a trial like that is -ever proven flawed, [i.e.performed absent consent-
or on healthy tissues etc - with no therapeutic benefit] the procedure itself may lose credibility.


The way I see it - if these things were to occur it won't matter which SNB "tracer" prevails in the mkt. So if I were to
invest, I would wait until I got the former trial results i.e the "endpoint" survival data of that procedure.


Just sayin'

Of course they didn't say it out loud....ever had general anesthesia for surgery? Anyone tell you that you could die
from it before you went under? Nope, BTDT. It's all in the fine print of that bunch of forms you have to sign in pre-

surgery, legal gobbledegook that most folks never bother to read.


As far as NEOP "supposedly" stating that SC can cause death from anaphylactic shock, what do you want them to
do, publish the names of the victims? In any case, I could find that info you claim to want in about 5 seconds with a
simple Google search....try it yourself, not going to do the work for you, but I doubt that info was the intent of your
claim anyway.

dbf-- thank you same to you~

Tell ya the truth - I'm not trusting of any of these products - after being mistreated by unscrupulous surgeons that used
them on me 
So don't invest according to my opinion, ok?


No...the gobblygook is NOT on the consent form for SC with BD 
Nor was it ever discussed by my surgeon-- which is medical malpractice to fail this disclosure


If potential fatal effects IS/WAS one of the risks v benefits it is paramount to discuss this with a patient- because if that
risk materializes [and publicized] that product would be shorted in a New York minute! [so Google me please ! find
one death and I will drop this subject]


I think you need to do the Googling and read Neop own statement on page 5 and again on 6 
lifetechcapital.com/lt...


"Safety Profile- To date there have been no drug safety issue 
reported with the use of Lymphoseek, in contrast to both Tc-99m 
colloids and blue dyes which both have potentially fatal risks associated 
with their use." [To date...........]


page 6 re-emphasizes the fatal issue- so doesn't take a rocket science to see the reason for this: 
"The clearer more accurate identification of sentinel nodes would enhance cancer staging procedures and help
patients avoid unnecessary removal of lymph nodes and the trauma and morbidity associated with their removal.
Additionally, Lymphoseek’s clean safety profile could protect patients from the potentially fatal side effects associated
with agents used in current ILM procedures."


So one has to assume that Lymphoseek has NO potential fatal side effects -like sulfur colloid ==OK that's a good
thing- [to date...]


But then we have this breaking news saying SC approved by FDA... 
[Neop does comment on this but viewer comments on this would be appreciated]


www.businesswire.com/n... 
and this 
lifetechcapital.com/lt... 
So now we are supposed to believe there is a difference between localization and mapping? Or double speak?

Don't worry about my "investing decisions" being influenced by what you or in particular Marty says, I can do
my own DD, thank you. These kinds of exchanges are for amusement purposes for the most part as far as I'm
concerned.


And that simple google search I mentioned? Like I said, 5-10 seconds, tops. First 4-5 hits all mention deaths
associated with SC, here's a couple of them, which also include other problems SC has that LS doesn't, so
you can "drop it" like you claimed you would:

Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid Side Effects - for the Professional 
Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid


The following adverse reactions have been reported associated with the use of Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur
Colloid Injection: cardiopulmonary arrest, seizures, anaphylactic shock, hypotension, dyspnea, abdominal
pain, fever, chills, bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, perspiration, redness, urticaria, numbness, dizziness and
burning at the injection site.


***Several deaths*** and cases of lung and soft tissue uptake other than RES have been reported in
association with the use of Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid Injection 
. 
The size and physical-chemical properties of the sulfur colloid particles formed from the components of the kit
may determine the biodistribution of the colloid and its uptake by the RE system. Diseases affecting the RE
system may also alter the expected uptake pattern.

CIS-Sulfur Colloid Warnings & Precautions


WARNINGS


Although rare, deaths have occurred following intravenously administered gelatin stabilized Technetium Tc
99m Sulfur Colloid Injection. Advanced cardiopulmonary life support systems should be readily available
where and when the drug is administered.


 
Sound like something YOU'D want to be injected with?

"What troubles me is that Neop states that the "other" SC produced fatalities. That's pretty strong stuff and I would
think they should support that with a link" - NotsoBlue


You're right. It is pretty strong stuff and of great concern to physicians and patients (assuming they're properly
informed). Neoprobe merely cited the FDA warning label for Sulfur Colloid:


"--WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS-----------...  
Anaphylactic reactions with bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria and rare fatalities have occurred following
intravenously administered Technetium Tc 99m Sulfur Colloid. Have emergency resuscitation equipment and
personnel immediately available (5.1).  
----------------------... REACTIONS--------------------------The most frequently reported adverse reactions include rash,
urticaria, anaphylactic shock, and hypotension. Less frequently reported reactions are fatal cardiopulmonary arrest,
seizures, dyspnea, bronchospasm, abdominal pain, flushing, nausea, vomiting, itching, fever, chills, perspiration,
numbness, dizziness and injection site reactions."
