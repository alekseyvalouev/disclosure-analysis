China's leading discount ecommerce retailer has been flagged as possible manipulator by
reliable forensic accounting quant models. Our qualitative analysis of the company's
financials also reveals possible improper GAAP accounting and financial anomalies that
suggest that the quant models are indeed correct. In our opinion, VIPS may have grown
its 2014 gross profit by $573M by possibly diverting funds to related parties to be used to
transact fake sales.

Summary


Mithra Forensic Research is initiating coverage on Vipshop Holdings Limited
(NYSE:VIPS) with a Strong Sell / Sell Short recommendation.


VIPS is China's leading discount electronic retailer. The company offers branded, out-
of-season goods, at deeply discounted prices, to consumers residing primarily in Tier 2
and Tier 3 cities.
Since its IPO in March 2012, the company has reported 16 straight quarters of
staggering and uninterrupted growth in revenues, gross profit and gross margin.
Operating expenses, as a percent of sales, have been in steady decline.
VIPS' share price has enjoyed a spectacular ride, appreciating 115% in the last twelve
months. The company's market capitalization now stands at around $16.2 billion, a far
cry from the paltry $268 million value at IPO.
Vipshop's results are astonishing for good reason. Our quantitative screen and our
assessment of VIPS' financial statements revealed anomalies that suggest VIPS may
be manipulating its financial statements.
One of the most reliable quantitative models used in the detection of potential financial
statement manipulation indicates that VIPS has a higher risk rating than that of
Longtop Financial or China MediaExpress in the year before those Chinese frauds
were uncovered.
Chief among VIPS' potential GAAP violations is the fact that the company reports
revenue on a 'gross' basis, despite the fact that even the company's CFO admits that
the vast majority of the company's sales are under a consignment arrangement.
Inventory account values at VIPS show potential evidence of the company improperly
accounting for consignment goods-counting inventory held-on-consignment as its own.
VIPS' inventory figures seem to contradict statements by management about its
accounting policies. The benefit to VIPS is higher reported ending inventory and lower
reported costs of sales for each of the last 3 years. In 2014 alone, the artificially lower
costs of sales results in an uplift of $151M in reported gross profit
Research into the year-over-year change in gross profit from 2013 to 2014 reveals that
VIPS announced 4 key initiatives that required significant and immediate cash
outflows. The value of these inflated cash outflows combined with the uplift in gross
profit from inventory commingling, account for 98% of the delta in gross profit.
If VIPS were able to divert funds from the overspend initiatives we suspect, it
potentially grossed up receipts from Related Parties (RPTs) to report even higher sales
and costs-of-sales figures.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 4/88


We believe VIPS grossly overpaid for Lefeng and Ovation. Prior to acquisition, Lefeng
and Ovation had negative equity and reported significant annual losses.
At the time of acquisition, the company seems to have led the market to believe that
revenue at Lefeng had been around $150M in 2013, when in fact, financial statements
indicate that VIPS had less than $65.1M in revenues in 2014. As such, Lefeng was
purchased at price of at least 2.7x sales at a time when VIPS itself was trading at
2.37x sales.
VIPS has directed over $300M into an accelerated CAPEX program. Although VIPS
had indicated to the market that it would spend $200M in total over 3 years, in 3Q
2014, VIPS announced that it urgently needed warehouse capacity and was going to
spend aggressively on CAPEX before the end of 2014.
However, a review of VIPS' statements and its operational metrics indicate that at
current levels, VIPS has more warehouse capacity than its Chinese e-commerce
competitors. In fact, on one metric, VIPS has more warehouse space than even
Amazon.com - a company with sales 23.5x that of VIPS.
VIPS invested nearly $23M in a number of logistics companies; however, VIPS has
provided little to no disclosure on those companies. It even labels one such investment
as 'a PRC logistics' company.
We believe that by employing these various accounting manipulations, VIPS has been
able to artificially inflate its gross profit, and consequently, its revenue and costs of
sales figures. See figure below.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 5/88


We also have grave concerns about the reported balances in the held-to-maturity
investments which account for in excess of 20% of total assets. The interest earned on
these investments suggests that the return is lower than what could be earned on
loans and even term bank deposits of similar maturity.
Moreover, VIPS previously reported that HTM was comprised of a total of 5 securities.
We find it an odd coincidence that VIPS has 5 founders and 5 HTM securities. We
suspect that HTM is in fact an accounting for undisclosed loans to related parties.
Loans that, if HTM balances are to be believed, amount to $607M.
VIPS' cash flow from operations is driven not by earnings, but by significant growth in
both accounts payables and accrued expenses as a result of not paying its bills. VIPS'
management claims that it receives cash from customers within 2 days and pays
suppliers in 30 to 45 days. Yet, our calculation of VIPS' days payable outstanding
indicates that the company pays its suppliers, employees and other vendors, on
average after 120+ days. VIPS is clearly delaying payments in order to disguise what
we believe to be a lack of cash on hand.
Vipshop's Board and its audit firm present corporate governance challenges; there are
numerous conflicts of interests which place minority shareholders of Vipshop at a clear
disadvantage:


The Independent Directors are closely associated/ aligned with two of VIPS'
historically large and prominent shareholders, VC investors, DCM and Sequoia
Capital.
Auditors, Deloitte Touche, served as advisor to each of the 3 corporate entities on
the Lefeng and Ovation acquisitions; this is the same Deloitte Touche that failed to
identify frauds at Longtop Financial and China MediaExpress.
Given the Board and the Auditor's potential lack of independence and multiple
conflicts of interest, we have serious concerns as to whether the Ovation and
Lefeng deals were, in fact, 'arm's-length' transactions and negotiated as such.


In our view, if VIPS has indeed relied upon the financial manipulations that we
identified, VIPS significantly inflated its earnings and revenue projections. Our view is
that if VIPS were forced to report on a net revenue basis, it would have reported
$938M in revenues in 2014, the figure it currently reports as gross profit. Subtracting
out the $573M which we suspect was diverted to related parties and booked as
artificial revenues, VIPS would have reported only $365M ($938-$573) in sales for
2014. Hence, our view is that VIPS is actually achieving revenues of around $365M,
not $3.8 billion. Consequently, if the market maintained a price-to sales ratio at the
current 4.26x level for VIPS, the company should actually trade at a price of $2.70,
5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 6/88


for total market capitalization of $1.5 billion.
Given our multiple concerns, on May 11, 2015, we sent this report and a letter
summarizing our findings to VIPS' management, Board, and Auditors. Furthermore, we
requested that VIPS authorize the commencement of an independent investigation into
its accounting practices.
As our concerns include questions about management, Board and Auditor
independence, we asked that the Board allow any such investigation to be led by a
firm chosen by a group of VIPS' other large institutional holders (e.g. T. Rowe Price,
Tiger Global, Lone Pine Capital).
The potential issues we have identified, if true, are clearly in the public interest and
pose a threat to a large number of minority investors. We therefore, also submitted
copies of our report to the SEC and NYSE.


1. VIPS Has Recorded Consistently Impressive Results Since Its IPO


Since listing on the NYSE in 2012, Vipshop Holdings Limited has been a stellar
equity performer, posting astounding revenue and gross profit growth year after
year.


As the two slides below highlight , over the period 2011 to 2014, Vipshop experienced
growth in revenues and orders of 1,562% and 1,370% respectively.

Vipshop has had 16 consecutive quarters of uninterrupted growth in revenue, gross profit
and gross margin .


Equity markets have rewarded the company with equally impressive growth in the price of
its shares. Share appreciation year-to-date (May 8, 2015) stands at 45%, whereas the
S&P 500 grew only 2.4% in the same period. Vipshop's market capitalization is around
$16.2 billion , having IPO'd at a mere $268 million .


Vipshop's consistent outperformance has garnered many fans among equity analysts and
investors. The majority of sell-side analysts covering VIPS maintain very a bullish outlook
for the company. In fact, of the 25 sell-side analysts covering the stock, 21 have 'Strong
Buy' ratings, 2 have 'Outperform' ratings and 2 have 'Hold' ratings on the stock. A recent
contributor to Seeking Alpha summed up the market's general attitude towards VIPS when
he authored a piece titled 'Vipshop: Even after a 2,660% Rise, There is Still Potential'.
Another analyst at BNP Paribas, under the headline, 'When will this phenomenal growth
story end?' suggested that 'there is still potential to outperform'. He also pointed out that
'the strong financial performance seemed to surprise even the company itself...'


After an analysis of information in the public domain, Mithra Forensic Research believes
that Vipshop management was probably not surprised by its success; in fact, our view is
that the quantitative models that are warning of large scale manipulation are likely correct.
In the last fiscal year, VIPS has made a series of large and unplanned cash expenditures.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 9/88


The rationale provided by management for these expenditures are not supported by
financial statements, management projections or management comments in various
forums. We assessed the amount of overspend that VIPS made in 2014 and find it
suspicious that the amount of overspend closely approximates the amount of VIPS growth
in gross profit. VIPS' financial statements also seem to reflect multiple violations of U.S.
GAAP accounting guidance, resulting in grossly overstated revenues, assets and profits.


Over the last several years, multiple Chinese listed-companies have been involved in
'pump and dump' or 'prop and tunnel' schemes. Central to the success of many of these
Chinese frauds has been the use of abusive Related Party Transactions (RPTs).
Interestingly, in 2014, VIPS increased the number of disclosed RPTs and the amount of
trading associated with these RPTs. We have serious concerns that VIPS' may be
funneling the cash overspend to these RPTs who subsequently return the cash or
receivables to VIPS in the form of fake sales revenue.


If our estimates are correct, 98% of the $538M increase in gross profit in the last year can
be attributed to a handful of significant overspends. In this report, we identify the various
levers VIPS may have used to achieve its reported results.


We also have grave concerns about one of the largest and fastest growing asset
accounts, held-to-maturity investments. Based upon our analysis, VIPS is earning less
interest on these securities than it would by keeping the cash on deposit in a local bank.
Again, a number of recent Chinese frauds have featured asset misappropriations that
were later found to have been conducted using inflated cash and investment account.


Our research and VIPS' financials raise multiple red flags. Each of these issues requires
greater disclosure and more specific commentary for us to dismiss the quantitative models
which currently suggest that VIPS is potentially engaging in inflating various financial
statement accounts.


2. A Reliable Fraud Indicator Warns That Vips Is A Potential Manipulator


A number of the quantitative models used by Mithra Forensic Research flagged
VIPS as a potential financial statement manipulator.


We rely upon both quantitative and qualitative research to identify potential short
candidates. We began our research by evaluating VIPS' reported financial results against
a number of proprietary and academic quantitative models. These models use reported
financial data as inputs to predict possible financial statement anomalies. One model we
5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 10/88


monitor is the Beneish M-score which has been a trusted forensic screen in identifying
potential frauds. The M-score successfully identified 15 of the 20 largest frauds in US
history .


But the model's success is not limited to U.S. companies. The Beneish  model has been
tested over multiple periods and in various market environments and jurisdictions. The
model successfully identifies financial statement manipulation and fraud 76% of the time.
The M-score incorrectly identifies a company as a manipulator about 17% of the time. An
M-score greater than -2.22 is indicative of financial manipulation or fraud. The greater the
M-score, the greater the likelihood a company is engaging in some form of financial
statement chicanery. We computed VIPS' M-score for the years 2012/2013 and
2013/2014.


a. SEC filings for each company; Longtop for 2007-2011, China Media Express for 2008-
2010, Deer Cons. Products for 2009-2011, and VIPS for 2012-2014


In 2013, VIPS' M-score of -2.37 placed it on the cusp of being labeled a manipulator.
However, VIPS' 2014 M-score indicates that the firm is highly likely to be engaging in
financial manipulation. In fact, VIPS' M-score for 2014 exceeds M-scores for two recent
high-profile Asian frauds, Longtop Financial and China MediaExpress. Indicators within
the M-score model point to specific accounts that should be investigated for evidence of
manipulation. For VIPS, indices on Sales growth, Receivables growth, Asset Quality and
Expense Capitalization were flagged. Using the M-score as a guide, we investigate a
number of accounts for possible evidence of manipulation in 2014. Our research suggests
that there are strong indications that VIPS potentially:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 11/88


relied upon incorrectly applying gross revenue basis reporting in order inflate its
revenues and increase its equity valuation (see Section 4);
improperly commingled inventory-held-on-consignment with purchased inventory,
thereby increasing its reported ending inventory and decreasing its costs-of-sales (see
Section 5);
grossly overpaid for stakes in Lefeng, Ovation and several logistics companies in
transactions that were possibly not negotiated at arm's-length (see Sections 6 & 7);
exaggerated and accelerated CAPEX spend to industry-leading levels despite having
significant excess capacity (see Section 8);
recorded increased levels of 'other receivables' which potentially reflect abusive RPTs
(see Section 9);
extended low-interest loans to RPTs, possibly VIPS' founders (see Section 10).


The impact of the above schemes in 2014 would have allowed VIPS to grow its reported
gross profit to $938.3M:


We believe that VIPS should be reported on a net basis and, as such, revenues would
equal what is currently being reported as gross profit. If we subtracted the impact of the
2014 initiatives from the $938M, we would see that VIPS should be reporting revenues of
only $368M in 2014 ($938M - $573M).


3. The Multiplier Effect: If VIPS Uses Cash From Related Parties, It Can Gross Them
Up To Report Even Higher Fake Sales



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/40082796_14313718177618_rId20.png
5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 12/88


We believe that if VIPS diverted the proceeds of its overspending to RPTs, it likely
inflated its reported sales. Evidence from financial statements seems to suggest
that VIPS is in fact growing its profit as a result of diverted funds to RPTs.


Depending upon the nature of its sales transactions, VIPS acts as either a principal or an
agent. VIPS reports that for the vast majority of its sales, it reports on a gross revenue
basis, essentially as a principal . If the M-score is correct in flagging anomalies with
VIPS' sales and receivables growth, it is likely that VIPS used its dual revenue reporting
ability to its advantage. VIPS could have recorded cash proceeds from RPTs as gross
profit. VIPS could then back into inflated revenue and costs of sales figures. Based upon
our research, we believe that VIPS has overspent on various initiatives totaling $573M,
and that these funds were likely recorded as gross profit. In fact, if VIPS had accounted for
these funds as gross profit, almost 98% of the growth in gross profit from 2013 to 2014
can be attributed to the overspends.


With $573M in cash recorded as gross profit, VIPS could set a target gross margin figure
and use it to back into fake revenue and costs of sales figures as demonstrated below:


In our opinion, if VIPS used the proceeds of its overspending to conduct round-trip
transactions with RPTs, it could increase its revenues by an additional $2.3B and its costs
of sales by an additional $1.7B, assuming a target gross margin of 24.9%.


Central to employing this manipulation would be VIPS' ability to utilize gross revenue
reporting.


4. This Is Downright Gross


Vipshop reports its revenue on a gross basis, yet VIPS management freely admits
that VIPS acts primarily as a consignee. Consignees primarily report on a net basis-
as agents.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 13/88


In the Internet and e-commerce sectors, companies are keen to show large and growing
revenue figures. One reason for the focus on revenues is that many of the companies are
at early stages of growth and have little to no earnings to report. Another, more critical
reason is that revenues serve as an important input a common valuation method for
ecommerce firms, price-to-sales. Many internet companies would prefer to report the
higher revenues allowed under gross revenue accounting. Consequently, a number of
firms (e.g. Groupon) have been forced to restate their financials when regulators find that
they have applied gross incorrectly .


GAAP accounting, as it relates to revenue recognition, presents challenges for many
internet companies. GAAP provides guidance on what factors should be considered in
reporting as a principal (gross) and an agent (net). There are several determinants, and
no individual determinant outweighs the others in importance. Hence, many companies, in
consultation with their auditors, make a judgment based upon their own interpretation. It is
not uncommon for companies in the same industry and with similar business models to
report revenues differently.


Companies that report on a gross basis are allowed to account for all of the revenues and
costs relating to the transaction. Companies reporting on a net basis are only allowed to
account for their portion of the revenues in a transaction, i.e., net of costs of sales. For
example, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) provides a marketplace for consumers to buy and sell
goods. eBay collects a percentage of the sales for the use of its platform. Assume an
eBay vendor sells a bicycle for $200, and eBay earns 1% commission on the sale. If eBay
is reporting on a gross basis, eBay would record revenue of $200. If eBay reports on a net
basis, it would record only the $2 in commission it has earned as revenue. The key
determinant over whether a company can record revenue on a gross or net basis revolves
around which party in the transaction assumes the majority of the risks and rewards of the
sale of products or services.


In the above example, eBay takes on limited risks from the sales and has minimal to
limited discretion in key aspects of the transactions, and as such, eBay should report the
revenue on a net basis.


Grant Thornton provides a discussion on the determinants in its guide on revenue
recognition . We have used this and other gross/net discussions to evaluate VIPS' claims
that it has sufficient indicators to report on a gross (principal) basis .


4.1 VIPS presents a rationale for reporting revenues on a gross basis

VIPS' revenue recognition policy highlights those elements of its business which it
believes are more indicative of principal activity and which would suggest reporting
revenues on a gross basis.


4.2 However, Management freely admits that it operates as a consignee and has no
intentions of becoming a principal.


In response to an analyst's question on the 4Q 2013 earnings call, Donghao Yang
provides the clearest evidence yet that VIPS is fully aware that it is violating GAAP
guidance on gross revenue reporting :14

John Choi - Daiwa: Good evening guys. Congratulations on a great quarter and
thanks again for taking my question. I have two questions. My first question is
regarding the business model, right now, Vipshop obviously moved majority of the
products is more or less through a consignment business model, but that didn't have
any plans to extend on I guess, it's kind of a follow-on question for the first time one
of the questions before, but have any plans to become more doing more principal
owners of the inventory like more of a traditional B2C products by offering more
diverged products to the customers at a more reasonable price, but on the other
hand, we will also have to bear the inventory risk? (…)


Donghao Yang - Chief Financial Officer: Let me take this one. Thank you for coming
to the call. Our business model now you are right we don't take - we don't purchase
the inventory upfront, which enables us to use very little working capital to support
such a faster top line growth. And going forward, I don't think that we are going to
increase the amount of inventory that we purchased at the current level. So meaning
we don't want to become the principal owner of the inventory unless we have to. For
example, currently, about 10% of the inventory in a warehouse has to be purchased
from the supplier. And understandably if those suppliers are big suppliers like Nike,
but going forward as we become bigger with greater marketing power, we believe
that more and more suppliers will allow us to take their inventory without having to
purchase upfront.


Similarly, a report by BNP Paribas cites the uniqueness of the VIPS consignment model:


'To the best of our knowledge Vipshop is one of the very few B2C e-commerce
companies in China, as well as globally, that operates on a consignment model -
afforded by Vipshop's unique and leading position as a preferred inventory clearing
solution for brands. Approximately 10% of Vipshop's inventory is purchased from
suppliers, which are usually stronger brands such as Nike and Adidas. For the sale of
the remaining 90% of inventory, Vipshop gets paid by the customer almost
immediately, while it typically pays the supplier in 1-1.5 months following the sale. As a
result Vipshop bears minimal inventory risk.'


4.3 Elsewhere in VIPS' financial disclosures, the company describes it business
model which seems very much akin to a consignment model, and which would
argue for net revenue accounting.


Summary-level details about VIPS' business model are as follows :

VIPS sells out-of-season excess inventory of branded-goods;
the company has over 7,000 suppliers;
VIPS pays upfront for no more than 10% of the products in its warehouses;
VIPS undertakes best efforts to sell products to end-customers via a week-long flash
sales format;
customers pay in advance or cash-on-delivery;
customers have a 7-day window in which they can return products for a refund;
in the vast majority of cases, VIPS has the right to return any unsold product to
suppliers; and
VIPS pays the suppliers in installments and does not transmit final payment until 1 to
1.5 months after goods have been sold to end-users.


The VIPS business model, as described, is clearly that of a consignee company:


merchandise is forwarded by the consignor to the consignee to be sold at a profit;
the consignee pays a small deposit for the goods transferred to its warehouses;
however, ownership of the merchandise remains with the consignor and hence is not
be reported on the financial statements of the consignee;
the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the consignor, particularly inventory
loss and credit risk;
unsold merchandise is returned to the consignor; and
the consignee is paid a commission as a percentage of merchandise value sold and
deducts his commission from the proceeds of any sales.


By definition, consignment arrangements are established between principals (consignors)
and agents (consignees) . As an agent, the consignee should report revenue on a net
basis .


4.4 An assessment of the key determinants for gross reporting, reveals that VIPS
fails on most characteristics.


We also examined guidance from FASB, as disclosed online, and concluded that VIPS
fails GAAP against most of the key determinants for gross reporting.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 17/88


It should also be noted that typically a consignee is paid a fixed fee or on a commission
basis. While we have not seen any of VIPS' supplier agreements, VIPS indicated that as a
condition of its purchase of Lefeng and investment in Ovation, the company had agreed to
purchase a minimum $148M of Ovation product. VIPS stated that it would receive
'commission payments' for any sales in excess of this amount. The company uses the
term 'commission' only in its 20-F statement for 2013-page F-47. In subsequent filings,
VIPS refers to the payments as 'rebates.'


Nonetheless, here we have VIPS earning 'commissions' from a non-marketplace supplier
(which VIPS correctly accounts for on a net basis). Commission arrangements are a
strong indicator for reporting revenues on a net basis. We believe that most, if not all of
VIPS' agreements involved fixed-fee or commission structures and argue for net revenue
reporting.


4.5 Recent changes to U.S. GAAP revenue recognition policy are likely to force
VIPS to revise its accounting by December 2016.


We cannot say if VIPS will soon change its revenue recognition policy, on its own or at the
request of the SEC. However, VIPS is likely to have to revise its accounting to net basis,
given recent changes in U.S. GAAP. On page 88 of the company's recent 20-F, VIPS
references an Accounting Standards Update (ASC 2014-09, here) which is due to come
into effect by the end of 2016. Section 606-10-55-37 (page 57) provides detail on changes

5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 18/88


to principal versus agent revenue recognition guidance. We believe that this more
stringent standard will eventually compel VIPS to move to net revenue reporting. VIPS's
view as highlighted in the 20-F on page 89:


'We will need to conduct a detailed review before we can determine if the adoption of
this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or
disclosures.'


Our read of this ASU suggests that the ASU will have a significant impact on VIPS'
financial results.


Despite the company's own admission, the features of its business model, and its failure
to exhibit key determinants necessary for gross reporting, VIPS continues to report
revenues on a Gross basis. Were VIPS forced to restate its financial statements and
report on a net revenue basis as an agent/consignee per GAAP guidance, VIPS would be
required to report only those revenues that relate to its commissions.


Net revenue reporting at VIPS would result in the company reporting as sales those
figures that are currently shown on the gross profit line: $154.4M, $407.8M and $938.3M
for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. We believe that VIPS is reporting on a
gross basis in order to enhance its reported revenue and hence increase its equity
valuation. Revenues of $938.8M applied against the price-to-sales valuation metric would
result in a much lower implied valuation for VIPS. Using the company's current P/S ratio of
4.26x, VIPS's market capitalization would be $4.0 billion ($938M x 4.26) instead of the
current $16.0 billion ($3.8B x 4.26). For Vipshop, it seems gross is good - an extra $12B in
valuation of good.


5. Inventory: What's Mine Is Mine, And What's Yours Is Also Mine


Management's statements about purchased inventory seems to be contradicted by
its own financial statements; VIPS, in violation of GAAP, seems to be reporting
some inventory-held-on-consignment as owned inventory, resulting in uplifts of
reported gross profit of $75M and $151M in 2013 and 2014 respectively.


Several times in the last year, VIPS has provided an estimated percentage of the amount
of goods in its warehouses for which the company had paid. I previously referenced the
following statements in the section on gross revenue, but I repeat the disclosures here to
highlight the consistency of the figures provided by management:


'For brands where we have established long-term relationships, we typically do not pay
any deposit on the products we purchase. For other brands, however, we generally
5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 19/88


pay a deposit ranging from 10% to 15% of the total price for each purchase order.
Donghao Yang - '(…) Our business model now you are right we don't take - we don't
purchase the inventory upfront, which enables us to use very little working capital to
support such a faster top line growth. And going forward, I don't think that we are going
to increase the amount of inventory that we purchased at the current level. So
meaning we don't want to become the principal owner of the inventory unless we have
to. For example, currently, about 10% of the inventory in a warehouse has to be
purchased from the supplier. And understandably if those suppliers are big suppliers
like Nike, but going forward as we become bigger with greater marketing power, we
believe that more and more suppliers will allow us to take their inventory without
having to purchase upfront.'


Management refers to 'goods in a warehouse,' which in accounting terms should equate to
goods-available-for sale (GAFS). The GAFS balance changes constantly as a result of
inflows from inventory purchases, outflows from sales, and write-downs. The GAFS
balance can be calculated using the following mathematical expressions:


a) Beginning Inventory + Purchases = Goods Available for Sale
b) Goods Available-for-Sale - Ending Inventory - Inventory write-downs = Costs of
Sales


We examined data from VIPS' financial statements to assess whether VIPS is correctly
accounting for the two classes of inventory which it manages:


Inventory which VIPS has purchased and should be reflected in VIPS' financial
statements, and
Inventory-held-on-consignment which VIPS has not purchased and must not report as
owned inventory on its balance sheet.


We did not have data which provided information on VIPS' daily balances which would
have been in flux due to the timing of purchases, sales and write-downs. However, if we
make the very conservative assumption that (i) all purchases occurred on the first day of
each period, and (ii) all costs-of-sales are accounted for on the last day of the period, we
can determine the maximum GAFS possible for each reporting period. This front-loaded
assumption around purchases eliminates the need to have information about daily inflows
and outflows.

* Impairments of $12.2M and $33.9M are included in COS for 2012 and 2013 respectively;
information for 2014 was not available at time of publication.


Using the mid-point of management's estimate of 10%-15% of inventory having been
purchased, we can see that at no point should the ending inventory balances have
exceeded $85M, $195M, and $427M in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Yet,
the ending inventory balances for each year exceeded the maximum expected amounts.
Moreover, quarterly inventory figures for 2014 suggest that purchased inventory in 1Q, 2Q
and 3Q 2014 accounted for nearly 40% of ending inventory.


Based upon this analysis and VIPS management's assertions, we conclude that VIPS is
inflating its ending inventory values. VIPS has commingled inventory-held-on-consignment
with purchased and owned-inventory in violation of GAAP, essentially claiming inventory
that it does not control or have title to as its own.


The inflated ending iInventory figures provide VIPS with the benefit of an inflated gross
profit. By increasing the reported ending inventory figure, VIPS manages to report a lower
cost of sales and hence higher gross profit:


Had VIPS correctly accounted for inventory, the company would have reported gross
margins of 13.8%, 19.6% and 20.9%, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Instead VIPS
reported gross margins of 22.3%, 24.0% and 24.9%. VIPS recently revised its statement

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 21/88


about the percentage of inventory purchased; in the 2014 20-F, VIPs states that it pays for
10-30%, but as the numbers above suggest, even this updated and revised figure is
inaccurate given levels observed in the first 3 quarters of 2014.


Inventory manipulation accounted for $76M ($151M - $75M) of the delta between 2013
and 2014 reported gross profits.


6. Lefeng and Ovation: Sweetheart Deals On Valentine's Day?


In our view, VIPS grossly overpaid for stakes in Lefeng and its parent company, Ovation.
In our view, someone at VIPS has a wicked sense of humor. VIPS acquired 75% interest
in cosmetics ecommerce retailer Lefeng on February 14, 2014, and then took a 23% stake
in Ovation, Lefeng's parent company, on February 21, 2014.


The Valentine's Day purchase of Lefeng amounted to $132.5M, including cash
consideration and financing related to assumed liabilities. Prior to the sale, Lefeng had
undergone a corporate restructuring. Management cited the fact that the online platform
business had not been previously separated from other group businesses as the reason
for the restructuring. As such, Ovation had the opportunity to decide which assets,
liabilities and employees would be moved with Lefeng prior to selling it. This discussion
can be found in the share purchase agreement for the Lefeng transaction that was
included in the SEC Form 20-F filed in April 2014.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 22/88


VIPS then paid $55.8M for a 23% stake in Ovation, which resulted in VIPS owning 80.75%
of Lefeng. VIPS management highlighted the fact that its investment in Ovation would
allow the company access to Ovation's own-branded cosmetics and apparel. The terms of
VIPS' investment in Ovation can be found here. VIPS further agreed to contingent
consideration which committed VIPS to selling at least $148M of Ovation product in 2014.


An M&A transaction is not, per se, suspicious or odd. In fact, M&A has become a common
means for companies to secure or competitive advantage. Additionally, companies paying
dearly for acquisitions are not rare either. However, overpaying for assets as a means of
asset misappropriation has also been a key feature of several recent Asian frauds and is
why we have serious concerns about these two transactions. Our analysis suggests that
the Lefeng and Ovation investments may have been transacted in order to divert funds to
RPTs. Our key concerns are that:


valuations are excessive in light of financial data reported pre- and post-investment;
both companies were loss-making enterprises and have accelerated the rate of loss in
the 10.5 months VIPS has held them;
VIPS secured short-term financing and subsequently accessed the capital markets to
pay for the investments, despite reporting significant and growing Cash balances;
management's initial high optimism and intended 2014 priority, quickly turned to near
silence on progress of the integration;
the key assets purchased are intangibles which are difficult for both management and
investors to assess; and
Eric Ya Shen, the other Board Members and the Auditors had multiple conflicts of
interests in these transactions.


6.1 Lefeng had negative book value, resulting in 123% of the purchase price being
allocated to intangibles and goodwill.


VIPS will certainly not be the first company to have overpaid for an acquisition, but Lefeng
and Ovation seem to have been valued at levels well in excess of shareholders equity.
Both companies seem to have had poor operational and financial histories. Based upon
information provided in VIPS' SEC Form 6-K for 1Q 2014, we were able to estimate the
purchase price allocation for Lefeng. The cash paid by VIPS implies a total value for
Lefeng of $177M.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 23/88


However, since large values were recorded in intangibles and goodwill, and the sum of
those values exceed the purchase price, we calculated that Lefeng had an implied
negative shareholders equity value. Consequently, a whopping 123% of the cash paid for
Lefeng was allocated to intangibles. The company owned little in hard assets. Moreover,
the fact that Lefeng had not been a separate operating unit prior to its sale to VIPS, raises
questions about the process of allocating various assets and liabilities to Lefeng prior to
February 14, 2014. Did Ovation offload a disproportionate share of liabilities onto Lefeng?
Did Ovation 'pretty-up' its balance sheet in the process?


6.2 VIPS paid 2.7x sales for Lefeng; not 1.2x sales as has been assumed by several
market commentators.


Since Lefeng was a private company and historically had not been reported as a separate
business unit, historical financial data is not readily available. However, management of
either VIPS or Lefeng seemed to have seeded market commentators with information on
Lefeng's historical and projected revenues. See here and here. In fact, the report by
Standard Chartered revealed gross merchandise value, principal sales, margin and
profitability at Lefeng, information that would have been readily available in the public
domain. The report further cites data for VIPS, Jumei and Lefeng as from the 'companies,
on page 83. Standard Chartered estimated Lefeng's 2013 'principal revenues' of RMB
900M whereas Barron's projected 2014 total revenue figures of RMB 900M. If we assume
that total 2013 revenues were $149M as suggested by the Standard Chartered report, we
would have assumed that the purchase price was reasonable. According to Barron's, the
implied total valuation of Lefeng was $177M [$132M / 23%]. Against sales of $149M,
Barron's estimated that VIPS was getting Lefeng for the price of 1.2x sales. This seems a
fair price particularly if you compare the P/S ratio to VIPS' same-day valuation of 2.37 x
sales, as reported by Barron's.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 24/88


However, as part of its disclosure, VIPS provides information on Lefeng's revenues which
is at odds with what market commenters reported, based upon 'management' sources. As
opposed to $147M in sales, Lefeng had less than $65.1M in sales in the year preceding
acquisition. In its SEC 20-F filing , VIPS reported that government notification
requirements for M&A transactions between Chinese companies are triggered when both
of the companies involved in a transaction have revenues in excess of $65.1M. According
to VIPS, revenues from Lefeng are lower than the $65.1M threshold and are thus
exempted from the reporting requirement:


'We believe that the turnover of acquired business of Lefeng in 2013 is less than
RMB400 million (US$65.1 million) within China and have not sought clearance from
the Ministry of Commerce, but we cannot assure you that the Ministry of Commerce
will not take a view contrary to ours.


Also, according to company disclosure on page F-28, Lefeng operates in primarily in
China, so the difference cannot be explained by the fact that the company may have sales
outside of China:


'On February 14, 2014, the Group acquired a 75% equity interest of Lefeng.com from
Ovation Entertainment Limited ("Ovation"). Lefeng.com owns and operates the online
retail business conducted through lefeng.com, an online retail website specialized in
selling cosmetics and fashion products in China.'
On page 13 of the 20-F, VIPS explains risks to the Group's operations by stating that
"the retail industry, including the online retail sector in general and the flash sales
business in particular, is highly sensitive to general economic changes. Online
purchases tend to decline significantly during recessionary periods and substantially all
of our total net revenue is derived from online retail sales in China.'


If Lefeng had recorded $65.1M in revenue (though actual figures may be even lower),
VIPS, at the very least, paid 2.7 times both 2013 and 2014 estimated earnings. Note that
this figure at the date of acquisition was paid for a negative book value company with no
stand-alone history. Hence Lefeng's implied price/sales ratio was greater that the ratio
public markets valued VIPS itself.


6.3 The 2014 combined losses of Lefeng and Ovation were approximately 33% of
the consideration paid for the firms.


We do not have enough information on Ovation to conduct similar analysis on valuation,
but data provided via SEC Form 6K for 4Q 2014 provides some insight into the impact
Ovation and Lefeng had on VIPS' financials in 2014. The data suggests that both Lefeng


21

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 25/88


and Ovation are cash burning and loss-making entities that are having a significantly
negative impact on VIPS' earnings. As majority-owner of Lefeng, VIPS reports
consolidated financials inclusive of Lefeng. However, since Ovation maintains a 25%
ownership stake in Lefeng, Ovation's Non-Controlling Interest is deducted from VIPS'
reported profit and loss statement. We have used the information reported as 'Loss
Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests' (Ovation) to back into Lefeng's net loss for 2014.


VIPS has a non-controlling interest in Ovation. Ovation's financials are not consolidated
with VIPS, but as NCI in Ovation, VIPS reports the change in the value of its investment in
Ovation on its profit and loss statement under 'Share of Loss from Affiliates.' We have
used the share of loss from affiliates to back into the Ovation's net loss for 2014.


a. SEC Form 20-F filed 4/25/15, pages F-4 and F-5.


b. SEC Form 6-K filed 2/16/15, page 8.


c. Divide 10 month data by 10, and then multiply by 12.


d. Divide Annualized figures by % held by NCI.


e. Attributable to VIPS equals Total Annualized loss multiplied by 25% for Lefeng;
Attributable to VIPS equals Total Annualized loss multiplied by 23% for Ovation.


f. China Internet: E-commerce in Transformation, Standard Chartered Research, p82.


Some key takeaways from this analysis are:


The two companies had losses totaling $117M in 2014 with Lefeng accounting for
$66M and Ovation accounting for $50.8M.
The annualized losses from both companies attributable to VIPS in 2014 totaled
$61.3M.
Total losses for both companies represent about 62% of the combined $188M VIPS
invested in 2014.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 26/88


Data from Standard Chartered had indicated that in 2013, Lefeng had a net loss of
RMB400 or ($24M); the loss in 2014 was therefore 2.8 times greater than the 2013
estimated figures.


It seems someone had a nice Valentine's Day, but it certainly wasn't VIPS or its minority
shareholders.


6.4 Despite having over $700M in cash and HTM at the beginning of Q1 2014, VIPS
secured bridge financing and subsequently capital market proceeds to fund the
acquisitions of Lefeng and Ovation.


The investments in Ovation and Lefeng were significant and material to VIPS, but could
have been paid from cash on hand or held-to-maturity balances. Yet, despite its reported
$720M in cash and HTM securities at the beginning of 1Q 2014, VIPS secured short-term
financing from Wing Lung Bank and China Merchants Bank. Subsequently, on March 17,
2014, VIPS secured $632.5M from the capital markets to pay off those bank loans and to
fund 'other general corporate purposes, including expenditures related to the planned
expansion of the Issuer's logistics network and warehousing capacity.'  VIPS Executives,
Directors and 'certain shareholders' also liquidated holdings, selling $188M worth of
American Depository Shares.


In a number of prior Asian frauds , cash on hand often turned out to have been
significantly less than that reported. The fact that VIPS has frequently accessed bank and
capital market sources raises our suspicions about the company's reported cash
balances. We explore this issue later in this report (Section 10), but the frequency at which
VIPS has accessed capital markets while holding substantial cash balances, is in our
opinion a red flag in the Asian context.


6.5 After much fanfare on the Q1 call, management declared Lefeng small and
insignificant three months later.


Upon announcing the Lefeng and Ovation deals, management cited several key benefits
of the Lefeng and Ovation deals. These included expanding the VIPS' customer base,
securing access to Ovation-branded products and diversifying VIPS' revenue base. On the
1Q 2014 call, management declared the integration of Lefeng and Ovation a top priority:

Eric Ya Shen-CEO Last: our integration with Lefeng is on top and there will be
extensive focus in 2014. The integration we are along at the benefit of, one,
streamlining our cosmetic offerings, two, reducing our combined procurements and
marketing expenses, and three, cross-selling between Lefeng and Vipshop user
basis.


"The acquisition of Lefeng supports our goals of diversifying our product offerings,
expanding our customer reach and further enhancing our customers' experience",
said Mr. Eric Shen, chairman and chief executive officer of Vipshop. "With this
addition to the Vipshop platform, we will be able to immediately augment our
cosmetics offering, further expanding upon our leadership in China's discount retail
market. We're very excited to work with Jing Li and the Lefeng team and look
forward to our strong future together.


As part of the acquisition announcement, management pointed to the promising
demographics of the Lefeng customer base: 8 million female consumers, living in
predominantly Tier 1 cities, willing to pay higher price per ticket than VIPS' customers.
VIPS seemingly had high hope for the company and its potential impact on consolidated
financials. Standard Chartered stated that the average ticket size for Lefeng (RMB 300)
was 46% higher than the average ticket size for VIPS .


The integration's success and promise of increased ticket sizes was called into question
on the call in 2Q 2014; the Investor Relations Director struggled to explain Lefeng's
negative impact on average ticket size:


Weibo Hu - Goldman Sachs …And my first question is in terms of the order size. We
find that the second quarter order size declined 2% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-
quarter. So, would you mind sharing with us how much is caused by the dilution from
Lefeng, and how much is due to the promotion of other factors…?


Millicent Tu - Director, IR The decline in (indiscernible) is actually back in the second
quarter it's a little deepened whereby we're selling mainly some clothing, whereas in
Q1 it's the weakest season. So obviously the (indiscernible) is higher compared to
the second quarter.


The communications line issues don't help, but it seems that VIPS is struggling to explain
why average ticket sales are declining, when a key selling point of the deal was Lefeng's
higher average ticket size per customer .

On the same call, management refused to provide data on revenue growth at Lefeng:


Karen Chan - Jefferies & Company …Secondly, what's the current revenue
contribution from Lefeng and can you update us the progress of this integration in
terms of supply chain marketing etcetera? Thank you very much.


Donghao Yang - CFO …We don't report Lefeng's revenue separately because it's
less than 5% of our total revenue, it's relatively small and insignificant .


And with respect to the Lefeng's gross merchandise value in the year-ago quarter and
prior to being purchased by VIPS:


Ella Ji - Oppenheimer Yes, my question was on pro forma basis. I'm not sure if you
added Lefeng's 2Q GMV last year. What year-over-year growth are we seeing?


Donghao Yang - CFO Well we can -- we don't have that number right now, but we
can probably do that after the call.


Ella Ji - Oppenheimer Sure. So, you said that 1Q the cosmetics GMV is $167 million,
is that right?


Donghao Yang - CFO Yes.


Ella Ji - Oppenheimer Okay, so then if I do a quick calculation the Q-on-Q growth is
about 6% and that seems a little bit lower than your total sales growth. So, can you
give us some color so, are you continuing to see apparel maybe grow faster than the
cosmetics?


Donghao Yang - CFO Well some of this seasonality in the cosmetics business, Q2 is
again the low season in the year. So, 6% Q-over-Q growth may seem a bit low
compared to our core apparel business where it's still not so bad if you can consider
the seasonality element.


By 3Q 2014, Lefeng is mentioned only three times during the call. Management reinforces
its intentions of being the largest in the cosmetics vertical and announces the combined
GMV is $191M . And by 4Q 2014, Lefeng was mentioned only twice - once by
management in relation to the sizeable amortization expense associated with the
acquisition and once by an equity analyst inquiring as to the GMV of the cosmetics
business .

So much for being 'on top' and getting extensive focus. We believe that since Lefeng had
no more than $65.1M in revenue, management was correct in declaring it small and
insignificant. However, size of the transaction required VIPS to overemphasize the
importance and potential impact of the deal in order to justify the price paid. The quick
change in tone and focus indicates to us that Lefeng touted as important in 1Q 2014 in
order to support the significant amount paid for both assets.


6.6 Lefeng's Invisibles-excuse us-Intangibles.


VIPS identified a total of 4 websites as assets being transferred into the Lefeng entity in
connection with the VIPS investment. However, there is only 1 functioning website,
lefeng.com; lefeng.cn seems to be a mirror site to lefeng.com.


The other two websites have been under construction for some time; as of publication
date, they remain inoperable.


It is difficult to assess the value of a website, but we are curious how VIPS allocates
nearly $146M to trademarks and domain names while only having one operational domain
and company trademark, particularly given the fact that said company had negative
shareholder's equity and reports growing earnings losses.


6.7 VIPS' Corporate Governance seems to be weak it is possible that the acquisition
were not negotiated at arm's-length.


Lefeng and Ovation are correctly identified in 2014 financial statements as RPTs given
VIPS investments in them. As a result of its stakes in Lefeng and Ovation, and Eric Ya
Shen's control of the Boards at both companies. Again, these dynamics have been seen
frequently in prior Asian frauds-dominant majority shareholder, with majority voting power,
works with RPTs to engage in asset misappropriation.


While we have no evidence that Eric Ya Shen is indeed engaging in such activities, the
corporate governance issues combined with the financial statement anomalies and the
quant model indicators, should compel any minority shareholder to ask pose serious

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 30/88


questions about the M&A transactions and the effectiveness of VIPS governance
structure.


Also, over the course of the last years, VIPS has expanded the total number of disclosed
and undisclosed RPTs. Most importantly, several new partners and entities are listed as
generic entities - 'a PRC company' or 'leading supplier'. See below for examples of recent
additions to VIPS' list of RPTs.


Again, while the existence of these RPTs is not in and of itself a problem, the potential for
abusive round-trip transactions is great, particularly in this context. We believe that the
financials suggest potential use of RPTs to artificially inflate its revenues via transactions
with Lefeng and Ovation.


VIPS governance structure presents a number of challenges with respect to management,
the Board of Directors and the auditors. VIPS has failed address or explain how it
manages conflicts of interest.


We created a map of key relationships between VIPS, various related entities, Board
Members, and Deloitte Touche. We believe it highlights a number of issues suggesting
potential for managing earnings, misappropriating assets or engaging in other activities
detrimental to VIPS and its minority shareholders.

We think the key takeaways from this diagram are that:


Sequoia and DCM were early VC backers to VIPS and continue to hold significant
shares of VIPS stock; both firms have Board representation in Jing Liu and Frank Lin
respectively .
Sequoia was also a VC investor to Ovation/Lefeng  and, as such, profited from selling
its stake in the companies, particularly if the valuations were inflated. Recall that both
Ovation and Lefeng operate at a loss. Those losses have accelerated in 2014 and it
raises questions in our minds as to whether either company would have been good
IPO or trade sale candidates in 2014 or in the near future. Our initial concerns are:
How did VIPS and Sequoia handle the conflict of interest issues? How did the Board
manage it? Can this truly be considered an arm's-length negotiation.
Kathleen Chien and Nanyan Zheng serve as Independent Directors. However, both
have long histories with at least one of the VC firms and as such questions should be
raised about whether their independence could have been compromised.


Kathleen Chien sits on each of VIPS' Committees and chairs VIPS' Audit
committee. She is a founder of 51job, a publicly listed firm which received VC
funding from DCM. DCM's founder, David Chao, chairs the 51job board and sits on
all three of 51job's board committees .
Similarly, Nanyan Zheng serves on all three of VIPS' standing committees and
chairs the Nominating and Compensation Committees. Zheng previously worked

as an executive at Ctrip where Neil Shen, Chairman of Sequoia and Co-founder of
Ctrip served as president .


Deloitte Touche served as auditor, not only to VIPS, but to Lefeng and Ovation as well.
This also raises questions regarding D&T's independence: how were conflicts
managed and how can D&T assure investors that its opinion was not compromised. It
should be noted that Deloitte reported fees of $1.1M, $0.7M. $1.0M in the years 2011,
2012 and 2013 respectively. However, Deloitte earned $1.8M in fees from VIPS in
2014, a full 80% increase over the prior year. How can Deloitte assure investors that
the ability to earn higher fees did not factor in its assurance and consulting advice to
VIPS.
Eric Ya Shen owns 62.5% of voting shares and with the remaining founders of the
company accounts for a significant majority of VIPS' outstanding shares. Eric Ya Shen
also maintains the dual role as Chairman and CEO. Management warns investors in
their annual filing: 'our existing shareholders have substantial influence over our
business and corporate matters, including without limitation, decisions regarding
mergers and consolidations, asset disposals and director elections. They may exercise
their shareholder rights in a way that they believe is in their best interest, which may
conflict with the interest of our other shareholders. These actions may be taken even if
they are opposed by our other shareholders. ' However, Eric Ya Shen should assure
minority investors and regulators that despite the above-referenced disclosure, that he
and the Board have acted in good faith and have lived up to their fiduciary duties to
VIPS and ALL of its shareholders, not just Eric Ya Shen.


In our opinion, this Board is both a 'cozy' (interlocked and familiar) and 'busy' (multiple
directors multiple VIPS responsibilities as well as other high-profile professional
commitments). Various conflicts, alignments and relationships raise questions about
various members' ability to act as truly independent directors and hence raise serious
questions about the firm's governance structure. The fact that the Board is Chaired by
CEO Eric Ya Shen, and that the company's financial statements reveal multiple
questionable transactions or anomalies should disturb most minority investors, particularly
those in the US who have limited voting power, limited ability to initiate shareholder
actions and few, if any, legal options to recover any potential losses as a result of any
asset misappropriation or financial statement manipulation.


We believe that the amount paid for both Lefeng and Ovation were excessive and likely
used to funnel proceeds to RPTs for use in round trip transactions. If VIPS, like several
Asian firms before it, used the M&A transactions to funnel cash to RPTs in order to inflate

Gross Profit and Sales, VIPS could have diverted $188.3M to RPTs.


7. Logistics Investments: The Last Mile May Be The Last Straw


The Lefeng and Ovation transactions were the largest of VIPS' 2014 investments, but
VIPS also took stakes in several logistics companies. VIPS has stated that investing in
logistics companies will allow the company to minimize its largest single expense item,
fulfillment expenses, and shorten delivery times.


Donghao Yang-CFO 'Moreover, on the delivery solution side, we began in early 2014
to invest judiciously in several courier companies with superior services. In some
select cities, we are also preceding to launch our own national deliveries services.
We believe that by integrating our logistics solutions, we will enjoy greater
economies of scale as we continue to grow our order volume. Over the next two
years, we aim to scale our last-mile capabilities to support 70% to 80% of total
orders on our platform. '


7.1 Approximately $23M is of non-current assets is recorded on the 2014 balance
sheet and cannot be attributed to Lefeng, Ovation or CAPEX; we believe these
accounts reflect investments in Logistics companies.


38



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/40082796_14313718177618_rId52.png
5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 34/88


VIPS explains in the annual report that its investments include an IT company, Explink,
and 'a PRC Logistics Company' in the account labelled 'Investment in Affiliates.' VIPS
further states that it controls 37.5% and 30% of the two companies respectively. Those
two investments accounted for only about $1.3M. We find it odd that the 30% interest in
the logistics company, was not enough to allow the company to disclose the firm's name.
Again, as we mentioned in the section on corporate governance, several recent Asian
frauds were conducted through RPTs and that fact that VIPS fails to identify these
companies arouses our suspicions that these may be RPTs.


The majority of funds relating to investments can be found in the 'Other Investments' and
'Other Long Term Assets' accounts which grew from $0 in 2013, to $23M in 2014. VIPS
explains that 'Other Investments' totaling $16.6M, includes equity stakes in companies
which VIPS does not maintain control. There is no explanation of the account 'Other Long
Term Assets' totaling $6.6M but we have assumed that this account also relates to
investments in logistics companies. VIPS provides no further detail about these
investments despite its grand ambitions for the last mile delivery initiative. We do not have
a schedule which highlights the names of the companies, the associated investment
amounts, or the extent to which these companies are RPTS - which we suspect is very
likely. Given that the fulfilment expenses account for such a significant portion of total
revenues, AND that fulfilment expenses have dropped precipitously over the last 4 years,
there is a real and significant concern that one of the ways VIPS is able to continually
reduce costs associated with fulfillment expenses is by pushing them off of its balance
sheet, and on to the balance sheets of these unconsolidated entities.


7.2 Management seemingly ignored a direct question about last mile, leading us to
be even more suspicious of the $23M spend.


Muzhi Li - Arete Research … regarding the balance sheet impact from the
investment in the logistic companies. Where we can find these numbers from the
balance sheet instead from the P&L?


Donghao Yang - Chief Financial Officer So the fulfillment expenses declined year-
over-year, largely because of, first, due to our growing scale. We have greater
bargaining power, so that we can have a lower rate with most of the company
partners who we work with. And secondly, our average ticket size went up
significantly year-over-year, and then also helped drive down the fulfillment cost per
order.


Operator- The next question comes from the line of John Choi of Daiwa .39

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 35/88


VIPS never provided an answer to the analyst, and while the 20-F provides some
additional disclosure, VIPS has yet to disclose the names of the companies that have
received the $23M in investment, nor has it provided details about those companies'
businesses, other than to provide the limited disclosure that VIPS recorded $1.0M in
impairments from these investments in 2014. Again, these funds could well be part of a
scheme to divert funds to RPTs and have them return as artificial gross profit which could
then be grossed up into artificial sales. We have assumed this to be the case and show it
as an initiative used to further boost reported gross profit in 2014.


8. CAPEX: Aren't We Already Swimming In Excess Capacity?


In late 2014, VIPS revised prior guidance on its CAPEX projections and accelerated
both the timeline and the amount of spend to a level that is 8x VIPS' historical rate
and nearly 2x the rate of its largest competitor. Management's rationale for the
sudden and significant spike is not supported by the company's own financial
statements.


For over a year - 3Q 2013 to 3Q 2014 - Vipshop had been consistent in its messaging
about projected CAPEX spend. The company reiterated multiple times that it would spend
a total of $200M over the course of the next 3 years - 2014 to 2016 - to grow its owned-
warehouse capacity from 290,000 square meters at the end of 4Q 2013, to 700,000
square meters by the end of 4Q 2016. Each quarter the mantra was repeated - $200M, 3
years, to get to 700,000 square meters.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/5/40082796_14313718177618_rId55.png
5/21/2018 Vipshop: We Are Not Buying The Financial Statements - Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 36/88


However, in November 2014 , Vipshop suddenly changed course; it announced that it
had already reached 700,000 square meters - 2 years early - and was on track to spend
well in excess of the $200M that had been predicted for the build out.


VIPS further revealed that there was an additional 600,000 square meters under
construction at the time. Chairman & CEO Eric Ya Shen appears to state on the audio
recording of the earnings call that Vipshop would have a total of 1.6 million square meters
of warehouse capacity by the end of 2015 (audio is unclear and transcripts are not
consistent but we believe the figure mentioned is 1.6M):


'So Wendy, for 2015 it's going to be another investment year for Vipshop. We are
going to continue to invest into our infrastructure. In particular, our warehouse
capacity is anticipated to reach around 1.[6] million square meters by the end of
2015.


8.1 In comparison to larger national and global competitors, VIPS' warehouse
capacity appears excessive.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 37/88


While 1,600,000 square meters of capacity does not seem like a great stretch, the figures
rank VIPS as having the largest warehouse capacity among Chinese e-commerce
companies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 38/88


Moreover, when comparing the amount of warehouse space to the amount of sales, we
see, that at current levels, VIPS has nearly 4x as much space per $1,000 in reported
revenue as the average Chinese online retailer.


Global industry leader, Amazon.com maintains 108 square meters per $1,000 in revenue
and as such, in 2015 will have 55% fewer square meters for every $1,000 in revenue than
VIPS does.


8.2 Management even admits to having more than enough capacity on the 3Q 2014
call.


Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I would like to ask about
current warehouse utilization and whether you the utilization going from third quarter
to fourth quarter. (…)


Millicent Tu - Investor Relations: [Foreign Language]


Eric Shen - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer: [Foreign Language]


Millicent Tu - Investor Relations: Okay, because we have continuously adding and
building more warehouse capacities, so the current utilization rate is low.


Essentially, on the same call, Shen is admitting that he desperately needs additional
warehouse capacity AND that current utilization rates are low.


8.3 VIPS' projected revenue figures for 2015, also do not support the argument for
the dramatically revised levels of CAPEX spend


Management provided guidance on its 1Q 2015 revenue in its 4Q 2014 6-K filing.  The
company is projecting between $1.25 and $1.3 billion in sales for the quarter. We
conducted an analysis that shows the trend of revenue by quarter as a percentage of total
revenues. Our analysis suggests that, on average, 16% of total revenues are accounted
for in the first quarter. This figure implies that the annual estimated revenue guidance is
approximately $8.1 billion ($1.3b / 16%). Furthermore, we estimate goods-available-for-
sale of $6.7 billion [($8.1B x 75% costs of sales) + (Beg. inventory of $0.6M)].

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 39/88


a. Guidance for 1Q 2015 was provided in 6-K, 2/16/15; using 1Q figure to estimate annual
and quarterly figures based upon historical distribution of Revenue by quarter


Vipshop expects us to believe that over the period from 2013 to 2015, it will record growth
in revenues of 380% and growth in goods-available-for-sale by 367%, while
simultaneously growing its warehouse capacity by 452%, 72 to 85 basis points higher.
This is despite the fact that the company itself admits in 3Q 2014 that it has significant
excess capacity already.


It should be noted that VIPS is reporting $235.7M of construction in progress. VIPS also
reports more warehouse locations, but these are leased. In fact, despite management's
focus on moving to owned warehouses, leasing expense continues to grow, $7.5M,
$13.7M, and $26.6M in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Leasing expenses in 2015 are
expected to grow to $37.4M. If VIPS truly needs warehousing space, it is not getting it
from newly built warehouses just yet. The growth in warehouse space is coming from
additional lease commitments, not from the as-yet uncompleted warehouses.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 40/88


It is our opinion that VIPS does not need additional warehouse capacity. We believe that
like many Asian frauds, VIPS may be using the proceeds of the CAPEX overspend as
funds for RPTs to transact fake sales via round robin transactions. We believe any
requirements for warehouse capacity have been more than addressed by the additional
leased facilities.


8.4 In our opinion, VIPS recorded, at a minimum, $233M more in CAPEX than was
required for its current and future growth profile.


Using the metric CAPEX spend as a percentage of sales, we evaluated VIPS' CAPEX
spend to (NYSE:A) VIPS' historical spend rate and (NYSE:B) VIPS' competitors current
and historical spend. We then estimated what VIPS would have recorded in CAPEX had it
not accelerated these expenditures.


Source: SEC filings for Jumei, Dangdang, JD.com and VIPS for 2012-2014.


The key takeaways here are that:


In comparison to VIPS' spend for 2012 to 2013, amounts spent in 2014 were in excess
of 700 basis points higher.
In comparison to spend at key Chinese competitors, VIPS' CAPEX spend as a
percentage of sales, exceeds even the next highest spender, JD.com, by 400 basis

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 41/88


points.
CAPEX as a percentage of sales at VIPS outpaces levels reported at Chinese
competitors on a three-year CAGR as well as on a year-over-year basis.


It is the opinion of Mithra Forensic Research that VIPS is possibly accelerating the pace
and amount of its CAPEX for reasons not related to expectations around demand or lack
of space. We believe that VIPS may actually be capitalizing items not related to its
warehouse program (e.g., fulfillment expenses, as has been done in previous Asian
frauds). In addition, we believe that VIPS may have diverted the funds for this urgent
'CAPEX' program to RPTs which returned to VIPS in the form of artificial sales in 2014. A
number of the RPTs are likely those companies that are listed as distributors and suppliers
in the accounts receivable notes and those companies that are part of VIPS' 'lasts mile'
initiative. Over the course of the last year, VIPS has not only expanded the spending on
CAPEX, it has also expanded the number of potential and confirmed RPTs. We believe
that non-controlling stakes in various logistics companies may be a way for VIPS to
transfer sizeable amounts of fulfilment and other OPEX expense off of its financial
statements. The difference between the $324M reported CAPEX (including deposits for
PPE and land use rights) and the $90.6M normalized CAPEX we calculated above is the
amount we believe VIPS sent to RPTs which could have returned as inflated sales.


Hence, VIPS' manipulations of inventory, its routing cash from M&A and CAPEX to RPTs
has resulted in growth in gross profit of $520.3M from 2013 to 2014, or roughly 98% of the
change year-on-year.

9. As RPTs Grow, So Grows 'Other Receivables'


Again, while we have no evidence to prove that the excess funds have been
diverted to related parties, it should be noted that in the last year, the balance sheet
has shown a rapid increase in non-trade receivables which are typically where RPTs
would be reported.


In 2014, VIPS added over $100M in various 'Other Receivables' accounts. In recent Asian
frauds, Other Receivables has been the account where most abusive RPTs have been
recorded .


Even standard accounts receivables contain disclosures about receivables to partners and
suppliers-no accounts with end-customers. VIPS' largest accounts receivables are with
delivery service providers and suppliers. Since VIPS claims to be the primary obligor for
most of its sales, the fact that VIPS lists delivery service providers as accounts receivable
is unusual.


The largest component of AR in 2013 is 'Other Receivables.' Again, these amounts do not
relate to transactions with customers, but with suppliers and vendors. The use of the AR
for advances to suppliers is unusual and should probably be recorded as advances or pre-
payments to suppliers.


There is a separate but similarly named account for 'Other Receivables' which shows a
jump of $72M in 2014 as a result of VAT and deposits paid to vendors for advertising.
Similarly 'pre-paid expenses' which would likely include amounts paid to logistics
companies and possibly RPTs also show an increase.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 43/88


The presence and rapid growth in these accounts further serve to raise our concerns
regarding VIPS and various disclosed and undisclosed RPTs. Some key questions that
need to be addressed with respect to these accounts are as follows:


Why would there be large outstanding balances with delivery service provider? Should
these amounts not be in cash-in-transit if VIPS is awaiting transfer from providers who
collect cash? Does the growing sum indicate problems with some delivery service
providers or possibly issues with end-customers not paying-despite claims of operating
on a cash-on-demand model?
Why would the largest component of A/R in 2013 consist of loans to suppliers? Who
are these suppliers? Are they related parties? Why is it accounted for as A/R and not
as loans?
Other receivables have often been used by a number of Chinese companies to siphon
cash out of the business, so Vipshop should explain why it makes loans to vendors?
What is driving the growth in other receivables from $16M in 2013 and $88M in 2014?
Is it truly VAT receivables and why is it growing so rapidly? Why is the other
receivables account 3.5 times greater than what we report as accounts receivable
which theoretically relate to cash expected from 'customers'?
What is the difference between Advances to Suppliers and accounts receivables or
other receivables? How does Vipshop differentiate between each of these accounts
given the similarity of terms used in reporting accounts and sub-accounts?


It is our view that VIPS likely used excess spend of $573M and routed it to RPTs. Those
RPTs helped VIPS generate fake sales. The existence of several unusual and growing
'Other receivables' is a clear red flag to us and supports our view that RPTs are behind the
huge growth in gross profit and sales reported in 2014.


10. Held-To-Maturity: Is This Another Name For 'Related-Party Loans'?


VIPS maintains a significant and growing balance of short term held-to-maturity (HTM)
investments. In fact, HTM has accounted for more than 20% of total assets in the last two
years. We have some concerns about HTM investments, particularly with respect to the
rates of interest earned on them which seems significantly lower than what we would
expect from other investments of similar maturity. Our concerns are that HTM investments
may be loans to Related-Parties.


10.1 The interest earned on the HTM accounts in each of the last 3 years, is less
than the rate of interest VIPS would have earned on both a high-grade government
1-year loan as well as a 3-month timed deposit.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 44/88


We examined the purchases and redemptions of HTM over the course of the last 3 years.
We computed averages HTM balances and compared these to interest earned on HTM as
reported in the cash flow statement of VIPS annual reports .


a) HTM is first reported in Q3 2012.


b) Rates presented are Bank of China benchmark rates.


It should be noted that we believe we identified an error in the computation of the HTM
ending balance for 2014 as the figures provided do not sum to the reported total. We
therefore evaluated interest earned on HTM in 2014 using our adjusted figures which
assumes that the difference of $6.8M is related interest on cash balances and not HTM
balances.


Our analysis reveals that for 2012, 2013, reported 2014 and adjusted 2014, the
annualized interest earned on HTM is less than rates for a high-grade 1-year loan. Most
strikingly, the rate of interest earned on HTM is less than that achieved on a 3-month term

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 45/88


deposit for 2012, 2013 and adjusted 2014.


Why would HTM investments be earning significantly less than loans or even term
deposits of similar maturity? We believe that the HTM account reflects balances on loans
that have been extended to related parties. Those RPTs may well be VIPS' founders or
companies owned by VIPS' founders, as this has been a common theme of prior Asian
frauds.


10.2 VIPS provides limited disclosure on HTM generally but in 2012 disclosed that
HTM was concentrated at 5 financial institutions


VIPS explains its accounting for the HTM account briefly in single paragraph entries in
each of its annual reports for the last three years. This is despite HTM's relative size (36%
and 22% of total assets in 2013 and 2014, respectively) and importance. The disclosure
statement on HTM has remained broadly the same over the years, but in 2013 and 2014,
the HTM explanation did not include a reference to the number of securities as had been
disclosed in 2012. In the 2012 explanation of HTM, VIPS stated the following :


It may be a coincidence, but the number of HTM securities matches the number of VIPS
founders - 5. Each of the VIPS founders also maintains corporate entities in the British
Virgin Islands which could make associating the HTM with the founders more difficult for
auditors. While this may be sheer coincidence, the fact that VIPS has changed the
disclosure and the fact that there are already concerns about the growth in number and
importance of RPTs, leads us to believe that HTM balances may not be accessible to
VIPS for use in the operation of the business.


10.3 The fact that VIPS needed to access the capital markets for its M&A and
CAPEX spend further suggests to us that HTM is not accessible to the business.


As mentioned in section 6.4, despite having $720M in cash and securities at the beginning
of 1Q 2014, VIPS secured short-term financing from local Chinese banks to conduct the
Lefeng and Ovation transactions. Subsequently, VIPS secured another $632.5M from the
capital markets to pay off the loans and to fund 'other general corporate purposes,
including expenditures related to the planned expansion of the Issuer's logistics network

and warehousing capacity.  VIPS Executives, Directors and 'certain shareholders' joined
in on the action by selling $188M worth of their American Depository Shares. VIPS
pointed to the M&A and CAPEX initiatives as the proposed uses for its proceeds.


But VIPs and its key shareholders have regularly returned to the capital markets, cap in
hand. In fact, VIPS has accessed the capital markets every year since the IPO in 2012.
Founders and other key shareholders have also used these opportunities to offload
shares concurrent with such fund raisings .


The below disclosure indicates that VIPS and its key shareholders have raised nearly $1
billion from the capital markets since 2012.


It is our view that VIPS depends upon the capital markets for cash since the balances
reported in cash and HTM may not be accessible or may have been transferred to RPTs.
If this is the case, VIPS is very much following in the path of many Asian companies that
have engaged in propping and tunneling. Management and the Board need to convince
investors that, despite many similarities to recent Asian frauds, VIPS is not engaging in
financial statement manipulation.


10.4 VIPS reported over $500M in cash flows from operations, but closer analysis
reveals that the company is achieving this by significantly deferring payments to
suppliers.


VIPS reported healthy and growing cash flows from operations for the last three years -
$111M, $437M and $506M, in 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively. However, a closer
analysis of the drivers of this growth reveal that significant growth in accounts payables

balances and accrued expenses balances have allowed the company to report such
impressive figures. Essentially, VIPS is significantly delaying payment to various parties so
that it can show these healthy figures.


VIPS has stated on prior calls and in its disclosures that it receives payment from
customers within 2 business days and that it usually pays suppliers between 30 and 45
days after the each promotion . Why then has VIPS' days payable outstanding been in
excess of 125 days for each of the last 4 years?


We suspect that VIPS does not pay its vendors more quickly because it does not have the
cash on hand to do so. We believe that the company may be relying upon the capital
markets to fund its business and dress up its financial statements.

Equitable Research, Contributor
Nice first article. I looked at VIPS right after the IPO a few years ago noting the sell-off and the massive Sequoia
stake. That was at $4 (pre-split). Since then it has moved up almost 10,000%. Luckily I never shorted it but certainly
thought about it on the way up as I didn't like it enough to buy it at $200M valuation and now being worth $15B it has
entered the realm of silliness. Many have lost their shirts getting in front of it. If I recall, Whitney Tilson has been short
this for at least a year. I don't know if he still is. But likely what you are pointing out is part of the reason why. On a
fundamental level the business model of flash sales has for sure seen its best days and has peaked.

Project Starshot
Assuming all that you pointed out in this very detailed article is true, what would be the real value of VIPS had it
reported the allegedly false statements according to GAAP?


12 May 2015, 05:37 PM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Our view is that if VIPS were forced to report on a net revenue basis, it would have reported $938M
in revenues in 2014, the figure it currently reports as gross profit. Subtracting out the $573M which we suspect was
diverted to related parties and booked as artificial revenues, VIPS would have reported only $365M ($938-$573) in
sales for 2014. Hence, our view is that VIPS is actually achieving revenues of around $365M, not $3.8 billion.
Consequently, if the market maintained a price-to sales ratio at the current 4.26x level for VIPS, the company should
actually trade at a price of $2.70, for total market capitalization of $1.5 billion.


12 May 2015, 06:12 PM


Project Starshot
Yes but how will the bottom line net income be affected? VIPS is actually profitable => most people on the
street value this thing at a two year forward p/e basis (2017 p/e) for now, sure revenue is reduced after
accounting adjustment, but how does that affect bottom line profitability?


12 May 2015, 11:41 PM


stockplaza
Gross or Net basis reporting does not affect the valuations.


Valuations are done on multiples of P/E, PEG, Forward ratios, DCF, Cash Flows, EBITDA etc. and none of these
change due to Gross vs. Net reporting changes

Most US companies on consignment basis do report Gross Revenues (Groupon / Zulily or even Amazon etc.) and in
either case there is no change in VALUATION of a company on several metrics mentioned above


When a company is growing over 100%, warehouse capacity planning is done on forward sales estimates. Amazon
growing sales at 10% does not need to plan warehouses same as VIPS, a company growing at over 100%


Lefeng/Ovation allowed VIPS to become a leader in Cosmetics and challenge Jumei. Jumei itself is valued at over
3.5B and based on Jumei valuation VIPS deserves to be at over 20B on P/S, P/E, PEG, Cash Flows, EBITDA basis


Mithra - if you're short like Tilson was a year ago (he learned his mistake and covered), be prepared to cover at much
higher prices.


VIPS is the leader in massively booming Flash Sales model in China and it is undervalued on any measure relative to
JUmei or its competitors.


Just re-listing VIPS in China market will double the market cap of VIPS IMO overnight due to valuation difference in
these markets.


What's your credibility? 
a) A website mithraforensicresearch is registered 15 days ago on godaddy with a UPS Store PO Box in Scottsdale,
AZ 
b) If you had 20 years experience, where are your other reports and works done 
c) Why do you ignore several valuation metrics and focus on non-factor Gross vs. Net which SEC itself does not
seem to have any issues with several US companies reporting similarly 
d) Why are you hiding behind a PO Box at a UPS Store? If you're credible, what is stopping you from coming out in
Public with your true face/colors.

userbob - all the data on this author, his 15 days old UPS Store as address registered domain, lack of any
other reports are huge red flags. As you said, this author is a fraud and may be committing financial crime
with baseless accusations.


None of the reports' findings such as CAPEX spend on warehouse expansion (to support huge growth),
Lefeng/Ovation acquisition (that helped VIPS to take on Jumei), or investments into last mile delivery
companies, etc. concern me at all. They are all what a company like VIPS given its growth and leverage in
the business model ought to be doing.


Plus VIPS CFO is a Harvard Grad with an impeccable record. Compare that to this author who comes across
easily as a fraudster. Who do you trust?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 52/88


The reason I picked Price to Sales is that if the company were reporting correctly it would have no earnings
and no EBITDA and would not be reporting any for some time--HENCE no opportunity for P/E or DCF.


By the way, Gross vs. Net is exactly what the SEC told Groupon to address before its IPO--see the reference
in the article above.


Yes, we want companies to invest as part of growing, but it looks like this 'growth' is financial engineering and
supporting the manipulation.


Lefeng/Jumei are still only $487M of VIPS' reported "Revenue". They are not the biggest cosmetics
companies in China. Cosmetics companies sell product through their own websites and various retail
channels. VIPS is manufacturing a story that it leads the market in something. Why did VIPS lead us to
believe that Lefeng has around $150M in sales when it tells the SEC that the company had less than $65M.


Should I remind you that Tilson as a hedge fund manager for over 10 years which means he has been more
right than wrong. He wouldn't be around it hadn't been. I think he got the call right.


My address and identity have no bearing on the facts above. I write a 46 page report with supporting analysis
and you are worrying about a PO Box.


Summary:


1. This comment and the rude one you sent almost immediately when the article appeared on SA Pro,
suggests you are the one we need to worry about. You are probably connected to or represent VIPS in some
way.


2. Your points above suggest you either failed to read the article or could not counter with your own analysis.
Each of the points you raise is covered above. Again, probably because of #1.

Author’s reply »  They will find that I am very much legit. They can look into me after a real auditor looks into
them.


13 May 2015, 09:34 AM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Re-read the report--it is based upon VIP' own financial statements and comments.


Harvard Grads have also manipulated financial statements--see ENRON.


I am not biased against Harvard Grads as I happen to be one. Just saying that this fact alone is not a basis
for believing VIPS' financial statements.

The company has released a statement with explanations which is what I trust and as shown by the market,
that's what it believes. As of this moment the stock price is UP over 5%!


Please don't cover your short positions! You should cover at much higher prices! You deserve to be slapped

It is doubtful that the author of this article will have the courage to come out in public with his real name. Like
for example go onto CNBC or Bloomberg to explain his claims on this company.


Most likely Vipshop is taking actions now.

userpeter
When are you going to publish your real name on CNBC or Bloomberg? As of now, you are too afraid of
disclosing your name to the community. This is an indication that your claims are fraudulent.

Tilson may be short, but Tiger Global Management is long to the tune of 17.25M shares as of their last 13F
filing.


I don't think you can gain credibility by claiming association with Tilson's bet against VIPshop, because a
similar argument for the longs of VIPS exists - Sequoia Capital (albeit China office) and TGM are both very
successful in their respective businesses of venture capital and hedge funds. Both have more credibility than
Tilson.


That said, it wouldn't surprise me if in fact you are right and this operation turns out to be a complete
accounting fraud.


To Mithra: 
Are there clear next steps in the investigation to prove or disprove your claims?


Disclosure: I am short VIPS.

Good job！You're very professional.


1,Apr 21, 2015------Mr. Huipu Liu, Senior Vice President of Jumei International Holding Ltd. (NYSE:JMEI), recently
openly accused Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS) for stealing intellectual properties from Jumei, including its product page,
copywriting, models' pictures, and brand licensing files. This weibo by Mr. Liu soon made news headlines in Chinese
media.

Yeah they are a fraud, however, I have seen their stock price go from under $1 to $30. So frustrating to see fraudsters
get rich off the average retail investor...

there's no way anyone could be so stupid as to report 3.8 Billion in sales when they actually had 365 million as the
author suggest. its possible to believe fudging the #s by 10% but not over 1000%! if the author is right everyone in
VIPs management should be throw in prison, if the authors full of bs to short the stock he should be thrown in prison

no way? researchers at business schools have shown that at any given period at least 20% of firms
misrepresent their economic performance. a few names comes to mind - worldcom, enron, or adelphia. and
this is China you're talking about. accounting fraud is widespread among Chinese companies. I remember
reading an article on Forbes about this.

It happens, and far more regularly that we would like to admit.

Nobody says ENRON OR SATYAM does not exist. You cannot use that broad brush on any company you want.


As stated several times on SA and from comments on VIPS IPO article, I am a long term investor in VIPS
http://seekingalpha.co... and have been following the company ever since its IPO and also listened to almost all
conference calls.


Your accusations are completely baseless IMO. If you are truly short, you should be scared. As a long, I rest easy and
ride VIPS for a real long time until its growth matures (once again as stated 3 years ago here http://seekingalpha.co...)

I actually have more concern regarding the legitimacy of "Mirtha Forensic Research" than VIPS. When I visited MFR's
website I found only a link to this article and a disclaimer. Sort of strange for an investment research firm staffed with
individuals who have over 20 years of experience in Investment Banking, Corporate reporting, M&A, Strategy and
Financial Investigations. But I'm just a small retail investor so what do I know.


Nevertheless it seems like this article helped give me a nice entry point yesterday for a stock that I have been

understand even basics of revenue recognition and valuations based on P/E, PEG, DCF, EBITDA, etc.


Jumei is valued at over 3.8B now and VIPS Cosmetics growth alone (aided by Lefeng/Ovation) justifies how
smart/strategic Lefeng/Ovation acquisition proved to be ..


Talking of acquisitions, what does the author think of $20B strategic acquisition of WhatsApp by FB? Does WhatsApp

A few comments: 
Why do you use ending accounts payable to calculate days payables and not average payable? This makes quite a
bit of difference, as it reduces the days payables to 94 days, which is comparable to Amazon at 91 days.
Mathematically speaking, the faster you grow, the greater the disparity between using average and ending balances.


For fast growing e-commerce companies, isn't it normal for working capital to drive the operating cash flow since they
have negative working capital and cash conversion cycles (aka they take delivery, sell and deliver to customers faster
than they ever even pay the vendor? Taking Amazon again, 2013 and 2014 net income was $274M and -$241M, but
operating cash flow was +$5.5B and +$6.8B, largely driven by accounts payable, accrued expenses and unearned
revenue.

I would not be surprised to see VIPS at new highs as soon as today AHs thus putting Mithra to Misery quickly!

Could you please provide support for you contention that there was $573 diverted to related parties that was likely
reported as Gross Profit? How did you arrive at the amount, the belief that it was funneled through RPTs and that is
flows directly to gross margin. I don't mean the math of how you bridge $573mm of gross margin $ to $2.3b of
revenues using a 24.9% rate. I mean, what is the evidence that makes you believe this is what happened. Thanks

Well the author of this article really went for a absolute knock out shot. It would be very interesting to know all the
motivations underlying this massive hatchet job. However, that we will likely never know, so just a couple of
comments:


Frankly, it almost sounds a little like a thou does protest too much effort. The timing is also very curious (clearly a
preemptive strike timed to undercut the earnings call). That seems a little swarmy at best, and perhaps unethical or
criminal at the other end. A little like winding up with your very best hay maker shot and hitting someone blindsided in
the back of the head. But this is about money so that level of conduct should be expected.


Another interesting point, when the writer of a financial article starts by asserting Freedom of Speech rights, one really
has to wonder (perhaps a Freudian slip)? The very tone of the diatribe almost makes it sound like it was composed by
Joseph Goebbels, with the refrain that a lie told loudly, arrogantly and repeatedly has a sneaky way of becoming truth.


But what about the specifics? According to the author this company is perpetrating a fraud that would make Bernie
Madoff look like a naive choir boy. The whole operation is essentially asserted to be a sham, certainly all of the
financial related disclosures and attestations.


I myself certainly don't have enough of the facts to say yea or nay as I move down the rather extensive list of the
article's accusations. However, I do believe Deloitte is the firm's auditor, and it seems kind of odd they could have
signed off on all of these items unless of course they are an integral part of the scam? Most of the large accounting
firms have pretty tight controls on these issues after Enron and Worldcom, realizing its their own self destruction if
they should ever miss things as unbelievably egregious as those posited by the author.


In any event, even if only a portion of the above is true then those running the Company certainly have some really
serious "splainin" to do. However, if it all turns out to be smear, innuendo and speculation intended simply to illegally
manipulate the stock price on behalf of a short seller (or for any other illicit pecuniary purposes), then perhaps the

The author certainly wrote a very carefully worded and lengthy "Disclosure" replete with Free Speech and this
isn't investment advice phrases. Maybe SA required this or the author's attorney required it. Chinese
companies that have had considerable growth in market cap are always targets for short attacks; sad, but
true.

valueseeker61
Just want to comment on your allegations about CAPEX spend of VIPShop:


Under Section 8.3 VIPS' projected revenue figures for 2015, also do not support the argument for the dramatically
revised levels of CAPEX spend


You wrote that "It should be noted that VIPS is reporting $235.7M of construction in progress. VIPS also reports more
warehouse locations, but these are leased. In fact, despite management's focus on moving to owned warehouses,
leasing expense continues to grow, $7.5M, $13.7M, and $26.6M in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Leasing
expenses in 2015 are expected to grow to $37.4M. If VIPS truly needs warehousing space, it is not getting it from
newly built warehouses just yet. The growth in warehouse space is coming from additional lease commitments, not
from the as-yet uncompleted warehouses."


The truth is, VIPShop is currently building their own warehouses in different parts of China, instead of leasing them.
They just built a new warehouse and brought it online near Guangzhou, where their headquarter is. They are starting
construction of a new warehouse in Xinjiang in far western part of China this month. They are also hiring college
graduates to run the business where their new warehouses are. You can use Baidu (Chinese Google) to find all these
news in Chinese and use Google Translate to translate the news to English.


Other news from Baidu search, VIPShop was also awarded the top mobile app among top Chinese e-commerce
companies, and is the first e-commerce company to push ads through WeChat friends circle. WeChat is the most
popular mobile text and voice app in China.


All those news from Baidu indicates that sales of VIPShop are accelerating, as their flash sale business model is a
perfect match to the exponential increase of mobile users in China. Hence, VIPShop needs more warehouses of its
own for cutting cost in long term instead of leasing them.

Bought some cheap panicked shares pre-market under 25 believing this author to be fraudster and also bought some
yesterday under 26. Sold these recent shares AH at over 28. However my original shares of VIPS from IPO days
(See http://bit.ly/1e2d6Io ) are locked up for the long term growth.


Sometimes fraudsters like Mithra are like a blessing. Initially I cursed this person for the fraud report but believing that
this author has no merit, I bought a bunch of shares from 24.80 to 25 pre-market and at open, which are sold just now
to realize some quick profits on the recent trades.


I do believe in the LT growth of VIPS and my 3 years+ old VIPS shares remain locked until growth of VIPS matures a

Well done Mithra, not just anyone can complete a report of this caliber and I suggest you ignore the retail investor
cheerleaders trying to take a piece out of you.


While I don't necessarily see issues with ALL the areas you highlighted, there's good substance here. On the other
hand, their response was a pile of corporate garbage.


In defense of the author, what does 20 years of financial analysis experience have to do with the tenure of his
website? Clearly this is a new operation in the vision of Muddy Waters, Glaucus etc. Did you even read the whole
report? Doubtful, because you decided you were right 10% of the way through.

I have personally never heard of Mithra (or VIPS for that matter) before reading this article, but I can say that the
article itself was extremely well researched (primarily based on the company's financial statements and statements on
earnings calls) and brought to light a lot of interesting details about the company.


I applaud Mithra's efforts to provide the investing public with more detail about the company, and I am disappointed
that some members here are slandering Mithra for bringing these facts to light. I would hope that every investor does
this kind of homework before investing in a stock (I certainly do), so that when these types of accusations come to
light it is not really a surprise to anyone.


As to whether the company is a buy or a sell is up to each individual investor -- however everyone involved in the
stock (both longs and shorts) ought to be aware of these issues and ought to make sure that they have taken these
risks into account before taking a position.


As for me, there are too many unknowns here, so I will stay far far away from VIPS.


Disclosure: I have no position in VIPS and no plans to take a position in VIPS in the next 72 hours.

case). That's quite "strange".

Hi, I am a retail investor. I tried to read your report but it's too technical for me. Can you explain to a layperson what is
wrong with the company, management and their financial statements? Try to do it the Peter-Lynch-Summary way,
simplify the story for us please. Not trying to do the summary for you, but maybe it goes like this: "Company's top line
are not real because XXX, as a result it's gross margins are not real because YYY, it's operating expenses are not
correct because ZZZ. Basically they are doing self dealings and related party dealings, creating a shell game with
their reported numbers, which in turn allows them to put up those beautiful financial metrics Q/Q for the past 4+
years."

A good investor will assess a report for its merit, not take any report at face value, do independent research into areas
that a report hits on and come to an independent conclusion.


A good investor will not get personal on the author of the report or just lash out.


I'm a hedge fund manager. You have 10s of broker sales guys calling you with stock ideas and getting their research
analysts on the phone with you... You listen to them, some are good, some bad, some not worth your time. You don't
lash out at anyone. You take the good, eliminate the bad and move on.


I have seen management teams lie with a straight face, I have seen CFOs who didn't have a real handle on their
company...


I have had companies on 1 on 1 meetings at conferences talk great about their company and a few weeks later see
the company miss big and guide down!


Point being: You are an idiot if you take anyone at face value. Good investors do their own work. If you think some
analyst or report is completely wrong and the stock is reacting badly to it - then utilize it to your advantage - if you

SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
First of all, I began my career in public accounting, and can tell you that it isn't that easy to get away with the fraud
this article claims exists. With that said, people need to realize that the size of the 4 global assurance firms has
always been an issue when regulating them, as well as the quality of work they really provide. I left this career after 3
years because my passion for the markets was to great to ignore, and want to make it a career. Along my way I also
lost my respect for assurance. This topic can be discussed and debated for days on end, it is actually one regulators
seem to ignore but rather go after every martha stewart because prosecutors get more exposure and money out of
those cases, then to use resources to improve the SOX act and the way the PCAOB governs the world of assurance.


Second, the fact the author is new and just registered his address at a P.O box doesn't make his work any less
credible. If its a new 5 person shop providing research to individual clients, they may still be putting together their own
logistics. Whats important is to actually look at the areas he addressed, and analyze them yourself to form your own
conclusion. Thats the point of this article.


This made news today on CNBC, so the article and the topic itself is not so disregarded that we shouldn't take these
accusations seriously. Jim Chanos was a nobody before he became the legend he is today (personally one of my own
favorite managers).


Third, although I said it is difficult to conceal this type of fraud based on how I know they test each account, and the
methodologies used to perform all audit procedures, its not impossible by any sense of the imagination either. IN
FACT, this company has already been cited misrepresenting information once and quickly changing the lie before a
bond prospectus to declare 7 properties in China after claiming they didn't have them (discussed on power lunch
today, CNBC). Red flag numero uno. Second red flag, this company's performance is almost too good to be true,
(does anyone know the saying about things that are too good to be true)?


Keep in mind that the legal entities of each of the big 4 are separate per area of business, as well as location. So
Deloitte, for instance, has a legal entity that is different in China than the US for assurance services, probably multiple
layers to prevent legal cases taking down the whole firm. They will leave them to all hang if need be to prevent an
Arthur Anderson case against themselves. Also I encourage everyone to research Peer inspections by each firm, and
PCAOB reports of deficiencies found at each firm through their inspections. These things aren't ever spoken about,
because it would deplete the most important and critical part of the markets, reliable ACCURATE financial
information.


Lastly, Since I do not know anything about the company, nor have I followed it, I can not give my own opinion on the
actual research in the report as accurate or not. What I can say as CPA is that the work is legit, and that it brings up
questions that need real answers. There are too many coincidences to at least not look into these accusations. There
will be heavy resistance for obvious reasons, as everyone will look horrible who missed this from the big banks to the
big 4, all the way to the research analysts who cover the stock, stand to lose a lot. So we can't dismiss or accuse the
author of having his own self interests, because his are nothing compared to VIPs and the related parties involved
from the IPO until now.

Keep in mind what the auditor report claims. They are NOT responsible for detecting fraud, but rather just having a
reasonable assurance none has been discovered through their audit procedures. A forensic audit and a financial
audit, differ greatly in the type of testing being applied and the overall scope of the work. This is why I started my
career in accounting. So that I can leverage a few years of seeing the other side of the picture into my own
fundamental research. Hence making me a more well rounded asset manager some day. I wish everyone the best of
luck. I hope some of this insight I provided helps those who have a stake in this game.


To the author: I think you raise some great points, and furthermore disclosed everything you needed to for someone
to form their own thesis. Great first article, looking forward to seeing where this goes. It made it all the way to CNBC
today, that's no easy feat.

I have been following this company and its conference calls since its IPO days ever since my first purchase of VIPS
shares 3+ years ago mentioned here on SA.


To the reasonable extent possible I have checked several traffic stats, iResearch reports and other public information
and read many research analyst reports some of whom have actually visited the operations / warehouses.


I have seen the progress of the company over the last 3+ years and given how eCommerce in developing countries is
booming (BABA in China, FlipKart in India, etc.), the right companies with right business model and effective
management, can indeed have UBER type of growth. FlipKart whose sales are perhaps not even a fifth of VIPS is
already valued at over 15B per some reports. Jumei, a company similar to VIPS but focused on cosmetics segment,
is valued at 4B in the US markets (JMEI). JMEI does not even have a fifth of sales and faltered right after IPO due to
sudden shifts in business model and other issues (management failure there IMO)


Ovation/Lefeng strategic acquisition enabled VIPS to take on JMEI and given 4B+ valuation on JMEI, the cost of
Ovation/Lefeng acquisition proved to be quite good one for VIPS.


The reason the stock went down today has not much to do with this report, rather could be due to "possibly
coordinated" attack with J Capital Research that put out a short piece this morning. The coordination of Mithra & J
Cap seems orchestrated by a short hedge fund manager who likely lost a lot of money over last year (the guy was
short for over a year while VIPS went up 134% per CNBC video - ouch).


Let the truth prevail. Let us revisit this in 6 months to see where VIPS is ... I will still be holding my 3+ years old
shares!

You're leaving yourself with no margin of safety and you've talked yourself into confirmatory bias. Good luck
sir.


Making snide comments and questioning a fund manager's integrity when he is short does you no favors. Our
job is to do in-depth analysis and a short play tends to require significantly more work and conviction vs longs.

It also does the investing public a good service by pointing out potential red flags and needs for disclosures,
fraud withstanding or not.


Some comments on your research process:


- Owing to the nature of their incentive schemes, sell-side research is a waste of time. They focus on selling a
hot story based on growth and multiples, while moving numbers around to fit their thesis. 
- iResearch has a history of being chronically aggressive if you go back and compare their "industry
forecasts" over time. Furthermore, they get a lot of their data from reporting companies as well so it's not that
different from being fed Koolaid by management. 
- Your views on JMEI or Lefeng are based on your opinion, which is fine. I would caution against pegging
company A's market value to company B simply because they're in the same industry though.


14 May 2015, 10:22 PM


SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
A wise investor would really take all items that have this much evidence behind them seriously, especially
when there is precedent in the country. It is no secret that there is a significant amount of accounting risk
coming out of China. In a country the size of China, and the limited application audit procedures can perform,
fraud can easily be perpetrated in three areas: Revenue recognition/accrual accounting, Fair Value
accounting and Level 2 and 3 methodologies, and Lease accounting. If there is collusion from small private
companies, and a good enough audit trail created to lead the auditors to false conclusions, the testing
procedures will have no way of detecting them, for the most part.


As part of the standards, analytical procedures are necessary for any audit. That's where someone can hold
the auditors responsible, as the discrepancies this report highlights should have been recognized through
analytical procedures performed on account balances, and swings between important or "high risk" accounts.


For your own sake, since you have made plenty of money, I would take real consideration at the claims made
in the report, as they may not discover some large fraud, but a real discrepancy that has to be corrected,
which none the less will have a huge impact on price. You don't need a full blown crippling case of fraud to
send your shares tumbling, just enough to prove they haven't been honest, casting the web of doubt.


There really is a lot of solid points that need to be addressed by the company and the auditors. The answers
will obviously say none of it is true, but on the auditors side, they may come out down the road that something
was "newly" discovered. REMEMBER, they are not testing for fraud. They aren't responsible if someone can
commit it well enough to get by the big bad auditor. Just saying, its your money..

r.winston, 17741882 - thanks for your comments and where you're coming from. the shorts are trying to
create a web of doubt and trying very hard at it. I'm not concerned of the short term stock price fluctuations (I
don't trade on margins). None of the information presented by shorts (coordinated?) comes across as
credible. When I bought VIPS shares 3+ years ago also, there are many doubters and shorts on YMB and
that was when VIPS share price was under 0.5!

Should some credible information emerge from a Short Research, I know how to hedge / put-protect my
position.


Just simply casting a doubt on 300M Capex to build 1.1M sqm of warehouse logistics (at approx $25 per sq.
ft.) or some other cheapo tactic won't sway me! If the shorts can build a warehouse logistics center even in
Nevada Dessert with land prices dirt cheap at $25/sq. ft. I would applaud them!


14 May 2015, 11:54 PM


Winston Chu, Contributor
I highly recommend a book by David Einhorn called "Fooling Some Of the People, All Of The Time"


His point on the capex was not whether $300m was feasible. He was pointing out that VIPS has absolutely no
need for that level of capex. In layman's terms: 
- JD is building China's largest eCommerce distribution network and yet somehow VIPS has a comparable
one? 
- How do you complete warehouses TWO years ahead of schedule? Did they 3D print it? 
- As there was no need for the capex, Mithra suspects that amount was used to circle revenues back to VIPS
and/or move expenses off the income statement and boost margins.

SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
Not a problem, see above comment as a last note.


My input was provided because the topic is one I can give a real inside perspective on, and what would have
to occur and how for the fraud to work, and the chances of that occurrence. Like I mentioned, I would have to
do a great deal of work since I have never bothered to follow the company. I can certainly see a small
possibility that a misstatement would be discovered and have FS restated for a small infraction, causing short
term pain for the stock. Companies recover when its not full blown fraud.


I wouldn't run and sell all my shares either as the chances of fraud being committed are lower than the
chances of there being none. ALL I am saying, is not to dismiss it all together because in the past you feel the
company has come under heat before, and come out with out getting burned. If it keeps occurring in small
ways, it ends up a big problem regardless. I wish you luck and hope for all investor's sake that the claims are
false. Its terrible to see peoples money vanish for the sake of a few greedy people's temporary short term
financial benefit. Best of luck with it all.  Hope my input helps

r.winston, 17741882 - Once again you both make very good points. Thanks.


I do go by many analysts' reports who actually visited their warehouses (per the reports I read) and the need

(building for the future like Amazon did in early 2000). This is one reason JD or Dang which tried flash sales
model and have not gotten much further. VIPS continues to be the leader in the space for a reason!


I do appreciate your comments and if I see some credible short piece I would not hesitate protecting my
position. But I refuse to fall prey for "hit and run" short pieces that have no merit IMO.

Good article. I suspect that VIPS inflated sales by investing the small logistic companies. It is well-known that some
Chinese e-commerce companies fake sales through working together with logistic companies, and the it is a profitable
business to small logistic companies as well.


14 May 2015, 08:32 PM

This is a must-see discussion on VIPS on CNBC


http://cnb.cx/1JLZ9IE


J Capital apparently could not find the 300 million dollars worth of property and buildings VIPS supposedly has.


The "bull" sell-side analyst admitted "there is a 5% chance I'm dead wrong and this could be nuclear"


Great stuff


14 May 2015, 08:46 PM


stockplaza
kitstricker, that J Cap or HF mgr short must be real blind


let us do some simple math ..


1.1M (now) to 1.6M square meters by 2015 of warehouse logistics to support 7 to 10B of sales projected over
next year or two.


1.1M sqm = 11.84M sq ft. of space warehouse logistics including land. Last I heard land is not cheap in China
or India with massive populations. Some spaces in Mumbai or Shanghai hosts some of the most expensive
real estates.


$300M / 11.84M comes to $25.34 per sq. foot of warehouse logistics.


Only blind cannot see or explain $25 per sq. ft. of warehouse logistics!


They also cannot see publicly available web stats, mobile stats, or some industry research reports ...


Some who want to spew lot of nonsense do it any way .. They hand pick whatever silly stuff and spew
garbage. Like that Hedge Fund manager who shorted a year ago and under water 133% per the CNBC video,
they will perish at the end if they are so blatantly ignorant.

Ah .. that 7 physical stores that hedgie short spewer was talking about, per 20-F filed last year, was to sell off
"damaged inventory" that cannot be returned to supplier (due to damaged or other reasons) and constitute
very small percentage of overall sales. As it is small, it does not have to be disclosed in every filing per my
understanding but saying that as a lie is plain stupidity IMO. In any case, the company did disclose (as I
remember reading it) in the last year 20-F.


The whole nonsense seems to be well orchestrated and coordinated short attack by that Hedge Fund
manager. He saw Mithra's report here, forwarded to J Cap that he pays and bingo the next day J Cap spews
some "noise"


I'm with Gene Munster and if I remember correctly Gene also visited VIPS warehouses and follows the
company closely. And all other indicators on VIPS tells me that VIPS is a real company and its valuation is
very cheap relative to JMEI or private companies like FlipKart, Meituan, etc.


The more I learn of VIPS the firmer is my belief VIPS will be a strong growth real company for several more
years.


14 May 2015, 10:36 PM


kitstricker
Look... Either the warehouses exist or they don't.


J Capital is in China, She tried to find the warehouses and couldn't.


VIPS can clear this up in about 12 seconds if they list all the actual addresses, sizes of their warehouses.


J Capital can verify the ownership with the local governments. This will be over in a day, and your stock will
go up.

Sharpe Research, Contributor
Just by reading this report, it's good by the way, I think you need more than this to SHORT the stock to death: 
1) As noted above, valuation is based on cash flows and profitability. The gross revenue issue is also priced in the
stock which analysts can derive the 'real' profitability. You may need more evidence in voiding the net revenues before
claiming the business is a scam. 
2) It's normal for companies to buy loss-making entities if they believe there is enough synergy between the duo. I see
no estimate on that though. 
3) Even if revenue is inflated, is the underlying business model on thin soil? 
4) Did you perform checks on warehouse locations? Management's statements on under utilization and capacity
upgrades may be possible if places they serve are geographically disperse.

One massive question here is why does the company go to market to get cash when it has so much of it (including
short term investments) on its balance sheet that it can cycle for expansion - Including the acquisition? At the very
least, VIPS must think its' stock is overvalued if it is willing to raise cash by selling stock over using current assets.


VIPS response to the report was blaming the short thesis writer for not understanding the business model. Herbalife is
another high visibility short where management claims that critics just don't get the business model. Whenever I see a
response like that from a company, instead of addressing the questions in detail, it lends more credence to the short
thesis. The best way to hit the shorts would be to refute each point with detailed, logical arguments, not to brush them
off and insult their intelligence in comprehension of the business.


I did a lot of research on China Media Express before it blew up and this one smells even more fishy. But even so,
risk of it moving against the short thesis is extremely high, given that many reputations are on the line and everyone
on the long side (company, sell side analysts, investors) will fight like hell to prove themselves right. Maybe if this
company goes into stratosphere and sells for about $30b, it would be a more appealing case to follow since
accounting shenanigans get harder and harder to hide as the monster grows and risk of shorting would diminish
somewhat.


The next year should be interesting for VIPS.


17 May 2015, 09:35 PM


copywryter
Good post. Why does any growing company go to market? Because there isn't ever enough cash.
Warehousing is expensive from both a physical and human aspect. Ask Zulily.


But you're right. VIPS should have responded to this attack more intelligently. This whole situation stinks. It
seems like a naked short attack from a 'forensic research' that itself has no trail to follow, but also seems to
have teeth. Baby teeth at least.


You're also right that a lot of people will be exposed if it turns out that the emperor had no clothes.


I sold this stock at $30 out of wariness for the Chinese bubble in a general sense. I'm glad I did.

Groupon has shown that flash sales is not a great business.


20 May 2015, 05:43 PM


stockplaza
Groupon based model Meituan is valued at over $7B in January http://tcrn.ch/1JB8dSP and I heard its
valuation has grown since. Groupon is more like local deals offered by Meituan in China. In fact, Meituan has
proved local deals space is lucrative if it can be executed well with good cost management. While many
Groupon Clones closed shop in China, Meituan not only survived but also flourishing as seen on its recent
valuation!


Flash Sales model in China is so successful, that many eCommerce players DANG, JD, BABA, etc. tried to
copy the same but none could lead the market like VIPS due to reverse logistics, warehousing, high SKU
daily turnover, etc. Flash sales are popular in China eCommece space. Jumei (which has a 1/5th the sales of
VIPS) is valued at 4B in the US market despite that company having missed estimates right after the IPO
(due to business transition and management issues IMO)


Even going by JMEI valuation of 4B, VIPS should command a fair valuation at 5 x JMEI or 20B on the same
P/S ratio (I could argue for even a better valuation for VIPS due to better growth, proven track record,
leadership in the space, size, etc). Hence, I have recently sold my JMEI position and plan to accumulate more
VIPS. Just salivating for an opportunity of "some weak hands" selling on what seems to be a well
orchestrated, coordinated, and distorted short reports and a short sighted hedge fund manager whose funds
performance of losing 7% when S&P went up over 30% in 2013 speaks for itself (http://bit.ly/1JMfInN).


What amazes me in this whole episode is who are the fools giving money to the hedge fund
http://bit.ly/1JMfInN that kept losing money?


One should do a Forensic Report on the fund and contact those investors to wake up!

SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
I thought the PR VIPS gave about this report really was too vague and predictable. They addressed each item by
arguing and pointing out their own reported "facts" already, by linking corresponding filings for their answers. Whats
the point of that? Whats under question is the integrity. I wrote under the PR as a comment :


" Since VIPs did the right thing ( as if they had a choice) by addressing the allegations, they did so in a very poor
manner. If you look at the information provided, they just repeated what was already disclosed and dismissed each
allegation as false, with barely any explanation and concrete evidence an investor can see himself, and dismiss the
allegations.


As a CPA, in my personal opinion, although I find the likelihood difficult that this kind of fraud was perpetrated in the
fullest extent of the accusations, I do think that there are enough red flags to consider selling if you are long. If you are
one of those who's enjoyed a massive runup over a short period of time, greed will be what loses it for you, rather
than cashing out the majority of the position, and waiting for a true conclusion. If one were to be that worried, you can
cash out with the m assive gains, and then buy call options as a cheap way to participate in the upside of they come
out with better and more detailed rebuttals to the questions raised.


Lastly keep in mind audit firms and their clients have a very cozy relationship. The auditors are not the big bad wolves
there to tare your company apart and nitpick each error cited, but rather guide them, advise them, as well as ensure
they are within the law, and accurate with their figures. I think it is ethical on my behalf to keep audit procedures
private, but I can say they can be bipassed by a some collusion and knowledge of the procedures. I can name many
examples but I have refrained from doing the real work, besides pointing out obvious things like the fact how was it
proved that the "suppliers" have no related party interests hidden in them, as the held to maturity securities which
were clearly indicated by the accuser to be under market rates? Most likely confirmations were sent to the supplier
confirming that the amount is correct, and or that it exists. No confirmation I can assure you or background checks
were performed to trace any cash in that entity, as it does not belong to the scope of the audit work being performed
for VIPS.


Many times companies find creative ways through their auditor's expertise to justify using one kind of estimate over
another, where significant accounting risk exists. This relationship doesn't mean we can trust anybody, except your
own work."


I don't buy into fear, I just wanted to see concrete evidence, none of which was related to what they have already
disclosed. I am curious to see where this all ends up.


To the author: Why haven't you been more responsive to at least the comments such as mine that aren't attacking
you? This isn't helping your credibility. I have contributed a massive amount of insight toward the conversation and
believe I at least deserve to hear what you think and how it relates to your work.

large number of other contributors, it seems that the discussion is shifting back to the findings of the report and the
surprising lack of a coherent response from VIPS. We issued our rebuttal to management's response last week. It can
be found on our website (see above).


We will try to address some of the specific questions posed by various commentators over the next day or two. In the
interim, we thought we might share a letter which we submitted to the Wall Street Journal several days ago. It will
probably NOT get published but we believe the message is worth sharing.


Dear Sir: 
I was deeply disappointed by your coverage of recent allegations of financial manipulation by yet another US listed
Chinese company, Vipshop Holdings Ltd. Your May 15th Heard on the Street column title “Very Important Moment for
Vipshop” referred to findings by my firm, Mithra Forensic Research, as ‘outlandish’. However, as I read further, I
became convinced that Aaron Back had not read much of the report.


If he had, Mr. Back would have realized that the issues are not just about gross versus net revenue accounting, or
about two M&A transactions that were not negotiated at arms-length. Mr. Back claims that the revenue recognition
accounting does not matter because gross profit would have been that same under either method. The report clearly
mentioned that this would not matter, if and only if, the company had not also manipulated its Costs of Sales which
our analysis suggests it did. Mr. Back dismissed Mithra's report (46 pages) and a subsequent report from J Capital
(27 pages) outright in a brief 270 word article, with no reference to any errors in our analysis, no inclusion of
independent research of his own, and no input from an accounting or forensic fraud expert. Instead, he concluded by
saying that 'all this is hard for regular investors to parse'. Isn’t that why we have a financial press, to interrogate and
assess these matters?


The real travesty here though is that Mr. Back and the Wall Street Journal are missing the bigger picture. The issue at
hand here is not the success or failure of Mithra or J Capital in identifying fraud or even earning a return as a result. It
is not even about the valuation placed on Vipshop. It is about the existential threat posed to the US capital markets by
the frauds perpetrated by a number of US-listed Chinese companies.

Your editorial team wrote a compelling article on February 26th, "The SEC Caves on China", highlighting that Chinese
firms are exempted from the auditing rules by which other US listed companies are forced to abide. Your editorial
explained the magnitude of the losses as result of recent Chinese frauds. The SEC, as you stated, is hamstrung and
cannot compel cooperation or coordination with Chinese authorities. The Chines affiliates of the leading audit firms
are not observed or assessed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, unlike the US auditors. And since
the investment banks, venture capital and law firms stand to make millions from these offerings, they are loathe to flag
even the most obvious manipulators or fraudsters.


The WSJ led the way in identifying the scale and scope of the problem just over two months ago. And while not every
Chinese firm is engaging in fraud, when detailed reports of a potential fraud —admittedly, difficult for a layperson to
understand—are revealed about one of the NYSE’s largest and fastest growing issuers comes to light, your reporters
cave as easily as the SEC.


It is clear to me, and it should be made clear to the American public, that when it comes to Chinese equities on US
exchanges, the regulators, auditors, equity analysts, and the press are not asleep at the wheel; they are in the trunk,
hands tied and mouths gagged.

"Dear Sir"


That letter was very entertaining. It is a shame that it may never see publication because of the inflammatory
nature and it should also not surprise you that Mr. Back will also probably "skim" through your well written
letter as well.

Mithra,


Thanks for a well-researched, well-analyzed article.


As a result of reading your article, I took a look at VIPS five-year comparative financials as reported to the SEC. You
can find them on page 3 here: http://1.usa.gov/1JRIBPu


From 2011 to 2012, fulfillment expenses dropped from 20% of sales to 13.9% of sales. It is otherwise relatively
consistent from year to year. I'd like to know why the sudden drop in the cost of fulfillment.

In the same period, General and Administrative expenses dropped from 37.3% of sales to 3.7% of sales. It is
otherwise relatively consistent from year to year. Again, a sudden drop just prior to opening shares up for public
trading here. I would expect some reduction due to increased scale but not this much.


Those two items combined make for a very large reduction in total expenses for 2012. Given that total sales for 2012
was $692 million and net for 2012 was a $12 million loss, this represents a huge qualitative and quantitative
difference in results. It is unexplained, as far as I can tell, by any change in the business.


I am inherently suspicious of unusual items which show up in the financial statement just before a company goes
public here. Perhaps it's just my paranoia?


20 May 2015, 07:00 PM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  I agree. This is consistent with their 'excellent' performance over the years. In every quarter
and in every year, VIPS is able to report dramatic increases in revenues and profits, and equally dramatic
decreases in expenses--especially with respect to fulfillment expenses, either as a percentage of sales or on
a per order basis.


Someone asked a question above about my thoughts on VIPS' great performance in 1Q 2015. My response--
I expected nothing less than fantastic results, beats across the board. That is what VIPS does every quarter.
The question remains though--were they manipulated?


If we just think about the basic business of this company, VIPS' consistently spectacular results should raise a
few questions. VIPS sells mostly out-of-season apparel via a flash sale model. Every city in China is filled t
the brim with street vendors selling branded clothes that are real, fake and everything in between. Against this
backdrop, VIPS is consistently able to outperform on every metric in every quarter. It is as if there are no
possible alternatives to buying branded out-of-season clothing in all of China. I find that unbelievable. To top it
off, the results are better than what I have seen for some pharmaceutical companies with patentable drugs for
rare dise ases.


No, I don't think it is your paranoia.

I am fairly happy with VIPS response to allegations. Just because someone slams a company with delusional
distortions, it does not mean the company has to waste its time on that beyond what it has done already. The truth will
speak for itself in the end.

VIPShop's performance is consistent with the growth web stats, mobile stats as can be seen on many 3rd party tools.
It is also largely consistent with the growth of other eCommerce players BABA, JD, JMEI, etc.

To say that this company has not missed on metrics is also a delusion. It did miss on gross margins or operating
margins or user growth or something or the other pretty much every quarter. Following ER releases the stock price fell
many times (one can go back and check the price history after ER releases). Even in the recent Q1, it did miss on
gross margins, and user growth plus it did guide down Q2 below analyst consensus.


VIPShop has many tailwinds as eCommerce in China is booming (as shown by BABA JD JMEI or startups like
Meituan Dianping etc.) and one can check stats like this http://bit.ly/1Bd1kjz that shows VIPshop mobile app is 39th
(commendable for a shopping niche site, not a messaging app) in China! And this http://bit.ly/1Bd2lb7 that shows
6.7M iPhone downloads though China is still largely an Android market (like India)


20 May 2015, 08:10 PM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Have a look at the two VIPS pink charts above. Glancing from left to right, you see a perfect hockey
stick in growth on revenues and margins. I find those figures incredible--as in not believable. China may well be
experiencing rapid growth in e-commerce but that doesn't make the company's results real.


By the way, for such a strong supporter of VIPS (I think you may have posted more comments here than I have), I am
surprised to see that you are 'fairly happy' with the company's response. Not necessarily a ringing endorsement....


20 May 2015, 08:21 PM


stockplaza
Many successful tech start-ups have similar growth profiles (may be more in case of Uber valued at 50B and
somewhat less with WhatsApp acquired for a mere $20B).


Are you also delusional that the 3rd party metrics are manipulated too?


I do not want VIPShop management to waste any more time responding to your garbage for sure. I think it would
have been better if they had completely ignored you. VIPShop receives analyst report perhaps on a regular basis
from 30+ analysts covering it. It does not respond to any of those reports whether they are positive or negative.


20 May 2015, 08:46 PM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Newsflash-this is not a tech company. It is an e-commerce site selling old clothes that nobody
wanted to buy TWO years ago.


I have no problems with the third party metrics. In fact, I think a few other analysts have used those metrics to
question why VIPS is so low on the lists of the most frequently visited sites. Those reports also seemed to question
the minimal amount of time spent on the site in comparison to the healthy reported sales figures.


I am not going to even go into the 30+ sell-side analysts point, but isn't Gene Munster, who so vigorously supported
VIPS a few days ago, now eating crow on his long-time Apple TV predictions? We can read the buy-side reports AND
still conduct our own analysis.

Stop trying to win the argument by referencing the all-knowing analysts or the esteemed institutional investors behind

20 May 2015, 09:01 PM


SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
Thank you for responding personally toward my comments. Very respectful and appreciated. I also
understand why you waited and find your responses very accurate. There are a lot of red flags that have been
raised, and very little evidence countered to support them being false.


I have mentioned many times that I have close knowledge of the subject matter, maybe not the company, but
from the brief description, your skepticism is rational. Retired Securities Attorney brought up some interesting
observations as well. I wish I had the time to really dig into all of this, but I just can't create more hours in the
day. Regardless I will follow the subject as best I can.


The reality is that it would be difficult to execute such a large scale fraud, BUT the more people attack you
instead of finding rational and conclusive evidence that makes every piece of your article false, I am starting
to think the possibility is greater then many imagine. Again, the amount of loss in reputation for the analysts,
bankers, and auditors is 20 million times greater in value then anything you or the Hedge fund could possibly
have at stake.


First, the Chinese economy is nothing to write home about these days. There are ghost cities everywhere,
and even manufacturing has moved to other low cost nations depleting many of the middle class jobs that
once created a stable economy. Not to say there isn't a gigantic market, but the kind of market VIPS serves
as you said is a bit niche, and for that matter, anything but unique.


Second, If your work wasn't credible, nobody would have paid it one bit of attention. You wrote an article
laying out your findings about the company and its financials, laid out your concerns, and let others draw their
own conclusions. For instance WSJ drawing a bunch of attention on the net vs gross aspect makes no
difference because it results in the same amount of "Net Sales", essentially says they drew the conclusion
that they should have paid attention in accounting class. While not mentioning that if they are concealing
fraud it makes a huge difference how they treat the expense side of the books because that's where they
would manipulate the fraud (revenue recognition has been manipulated since the beginning of mankind).
The choice is relevant, because Net Sales is the number being attempted to be manipulated. Just as one
example to the various and many times vague outlashes you have received for writing an article that accuses
some company of fraud. Further more, you had the nerve to do so with plenty of evidence that has yet been
disproved  with out a doubt. Shame on you right?  
If people like you didn't exists, Jim Chanos wouldn't be who he is, nor David Einhorn. Like I mentioned from
my experience in the industry, there is plenty of "control risk" among the firms who are entrusted with the
accuracy of financial information. Most people don't realize how little they need to do to cover their fiduciary
responsibility on the fraud end of the spectrum..I can write a whole thesis article on Audit Firms Post SOX,
and it would really surprise many people. But hey, at the end of the day, MANAGEMENT asserts and signs,
they just review right?

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3172676-vipshop-we-are-not-buying-the-financial-statements 79/88


Lastly, regardless if you are right or not, I look forward to more of your work. I have enough knowledge to say
your work was impressive, and insightful, and I look forward to future articles. VIPS response was terrible, to
say the least. They were better off saying we will not respond to bla bla bla, we have auditors and they gave
us a thumbs up, and so on, INSTEAD of listing  out everything you did, and then deny it, insult it, and
furthermore, empower it by referencing back to filings and evidence that would be fraudulent if you are
correct, but not providing anything else that would be new and prove you wrong. So it will be very interesting
to see indeed to see how things turn out.


I wish you the best of luck, and hope people just respond with useful commentary, and leave the insults and
such to silent air, as its better to say nothing and move on. I would rather find some value myself, then read a
bunch of vague insults that don't make any of us any money.  All the best !

I want to refute this anecdotally. I've sold on VIPshop and I was selling same-year merchandise. The only
reason it wasn't same-season clothing was that the seasons are flipped in the southern hemisphere.


I can also attest that sales were good. On par with north american flash sites like Gilt and Hautelook.

I don't speak Mandarin or Cantonese. So it's quite feasible, but there is a very large amount of Chinese Red
Tape to process.


I've since introduced a few other (Canadian) companies to them.


Interestingly, they did ask me recently if I spoke either language, as they do not have the staff to keep up with
the inflow.


I should disclose that I no longer own VIPS.

copywriter - your assertions, growth of traffic - web stats, mobile stats -, flawed gross vs. net assumption, etc.
should help open the eyes of anyone who is short this stock!


Too many people are conned by the short funds who invoke the word "China" to spread "Fear" for ulterior
motives. All the while US companies from AAPL to WMT sell HUNDREDS of BILLIONS worth of merchandise
to Chinese Consumers and "China" is close to surpassing the US GDP on purchasing power!


Alibaba transacts over $300B GMV that is growing at 40% and has plans to reach $1 Trillion in 5 years per
the new CEO of BABA


When VIPS becomes the next BABA in its niche and grows to $100B sales vs. $1T for BABA in the next 5
years, those who are still short VIPS in 5 years can be in dire straits. I'm planning to hold VIPS and BABA for
a real long time:)

$370B (this from Jumei's Conference Call today)

So hypothetically, if I have an app called Flashchat with x million users and 9000% growth it must be worth
$15bn because Snapchat is "worth" $15bn right?

r.winstonc -  
the author admits gross vs. net sales reporting does not make any difference in valuations
(PE/DCF/PEG/EBIT). The accounting fraud allegations based on warehouse expansion / growth / reverse
logistics / strategic Lefeng-Ovation acquisition, etc. are pure imagination on the part of author or lack of basic
understanding of any business or fabrication with possible collusion from short funds


growth of traffic (PC / Mobile) stats are in-line with sales and nothing looks out of the ordinary to me is all what
I was saying .. how much to value for the growth or traffic or sales is up to your own model / comfort zone.
Flashchat or $15B has nothing to do with it. If Snapchat or Uber are valued as they are reported, I am
comfortable assigning same valuation as Uber to VIPS. In fact, if there is a choice between Uber vs. VIPS at
the same valuation, I'd choose VIPS. That's my preference.


As to Enron or other frauds, I don't invest in businesses that I don't understand or cannot verify using 3rd
party independent metrics. That saved me trouble thus far on many of my core holdings. In the dot com
bubble I lost some money on stocks like Commerce One, Kana S/w, etc. (which had gone to zero) but those
losses are more than offset by AMZN, PCLN, RHT, etc. picked at the same time! I was not as meticulous in
my investments back in dot com bubble either. It was pure luck I had picked AMZN, RHT, PCLN along with
losers like Commerce One, Kana, etc. Just AMZN alone compensated all other losers I had from the dot com
bubble.


I feel good about my VIPS pick from 3+ years ago. And I would not be surprised if VIPS grows much bigger
like AMZN or BABA over the next 5 to 10 years.

SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
The mere fact you would assign the same valuation to VIPS that UBER has, and even compare the two,
shows extremely poor financial valuation skills. I don't mean to be rude, but that's comparing apples and
forks, not oranges. UBER has the ability to expand their model into so many different directions such as their
recent venture in food delivery. I think their valuation is ridiculous as it is, but they are getting the money from
rather smart individuals, so they expect a very solid return on a private VC (even late stage) investment. With
those types of numbers, the late stage investors must have accepted a future valuation of at least 80 billion,
so we know the IPO is coming, and it will be huge. What UBER will be over VIPS is like comparing apple to
groupon. Senseless. That's just my opinion though, to each their own dollars. The only one from your list you
are missing is saying you got into LVS and Apple too in the beginning. Just my humble opinion

SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
Yes we know where they have expanded, and how they have performed with FLAWLESS execution all the
way up. So if this ends up someday being a real accounting scandal, and your money is wiped, at least we
know you are probably the only human to have 10 plus year investments in AMZN, PCLN, especially at rock
bottom prices. Your day trading profits are LVS and Apple. Believable.


Regardless even if VIPS isn't a fraudulent company, the Chinese consumer will suffer from the many bubbles
that are forming in the Chinese economy. Those savvy enough to day trade Chinese and HK stocks will make
some good money this year. Somewhere in the future though looms the reality of a slowing, overextended,
and leveraged economy will come to light as the tide comes in. The world will see how big financial bubbles
can get when the money dries up in all those ghost cities built. Best of luck

SerrCo,  
Did you say same thing about AMZN or BABA - just online retailers - nothing unique. Yep, VIPS is a leader in
its niche that is growing rapidly and its an online retailer like AMZN / BABA.


I prefer VIPS over Uber because VIPS has shown not only rapid growth and established scale but also
positive cash flows and leverage in the business model (similar or better than AMZN) to improve operating
margins.


Anyway the topic is not Uber vs. VIPS. It was just for stating what I think on VIPS valuation (or rather how
cheap it is on forward PEG basis)


Did you see the seeking alpha article from Geo Investing? If not, read it and it will enlighten you!


29 May 2015, 12:29 AM


SerrCo, Contributor
stockplaza,


AMZN and BABA are both online retailing pioneers. What competitive advantage does VIPS have over either
of them? There is no search function on their site.


It sounds like the only thing you really have to hang your hat on is its financial results, which are possibly
manipulated and fraudulent.


What is unique about their business model over other chinese e-tailers?


29 May 2015, 09:54 AM


stockplaza
Yes, Uber is not a tech company .. It is just a taxi peddler. 
Amazon is a mere shop peddling goods online that nobody wants. 
BABA is a phony shop - doing nothing - but connecting shoppers and merchants and washing off hands. eBay all
used garbage? What else?


I thought you're delusional on 3rd party metrics. Yes, you have some problem with them too or twist the analyst
questions on PC vs. Mobile shifts in traffic to suit your convenience


Gene Munster maybe wrong on some "future predictions" on Apple, but he was right on many of Apple predictions on
iPhone or iDevices? And if you had listened to him and owned AAPL from $80 (prior to split), you'll not be resorting to
cheap tactics like this


VIPShop should not waste any more time on this garbage IMO. Let the company's performance and continued growth
in market share speak for itself.

Chinese companies, there is ample reason to carefully question the validity of any company with such spectacular
growth, especially in light of the current economic conditions in China. I personally have witnessed some spectacular
financial fraud with Chinese companies.


It may be possible that both the authors are trying to spike VIPS for their own financial gain, but that VIPS
management have been spiking investors.


Just sayin...

Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray is a defender of VIPS.


In a COMPLETLY unrelated story, Piper Jaffray was an underwriter of the VIPS IPO.

Yeah, by the way sell-side analysts are nearly forbidden to issue SELL on securities they underwrite. Even a
Neutral rating requires many reviews and approvals.

"Let the company's performance and continued growth in market share speak for itself." 
What is acceptable for a country is not acceptable for a company, VIPS needs to buy an island in international waters
and mint it's own currency then this kinda stuff can fly.. 
"Let the countries performance and continued growth in market share speak for itself."

"Must Read" article from Geo Investing - http://seekingalpha.co...


29 May 2015, 12:37 AM


Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  Geo Investing only addresses 1 (Gross vs. Net) of the 10 items that our report detailed. In fact, Geo
Investing actually compliments Mithra's work and defers to Paul Gillis' article for a view on Gross vs Net. It should be
noted that the Professor also posted his article on his blog and stated in the comments section that in his opinion,
should the SEC look at the Gross/ Net question at VIPS, the SEC would agree with Mithra. Gillis put the odds at 70/30
in Mithra's favor. So far, no one has contradicted or refuted the Mithra report. Keep trying buddy. You are working hard
here--VIPS should hire you for PR work.

Yeah, I'd say stockplaza is doing a better job than VIPS

Now you lack basic reading comprehension too? Geo report refutes many allegations and went long VIPS. You
admitted Gross vs Net does not matter and your fabricated allegations are refuted by many sources. Keep believing
whatever in your hallucinations.

Mithra Forensic Research, Contributor
Author’s reply »  No again. Geo challenges some points made in the J Capital report. I admitted that Gross vs
Net would not matter, IF AND ONLY IF, there was no manipulation of Costs of Sales, which there were. See
section 5 above.

I'd take that as a complement. But don't forget VIPS has done a remarkable job too. Let the markets and truth speak
for itself.

Mithra,


Can you confirm where you got the $19.3m interest earned number in the 2014 20F filings for held to maturity
investments, and the reason why you chose that number? I think I know where you got it from, but just want to be
sure.

>>where you got the $19.3m interest earned number in the 2014 20F filings for held to maturity investments...
<<


Maybe I can help. The $19.3MM interest earned is shown in the 20F in the Cash Flow statements on page F-
8 here: http://tinyurl.com/osg...


It's called "Interest income on held-to-maturity securities".


It is only one of dozens of inconsistencies which make these financials impossible for me to believe.

Retired Securities Attorney,


I have already seen that $19.3m number in the cash flow statement, however since this is an indirect cash
flow statement, which reconciles the net income to cash flows, and not a direct cash flow statement, then
choosing this particular $19.3m from it may not be the correct choice. For example, the cash flow statement
does clearly say:


"Adjustments to reconcile net (loss) income to net cash by operating activities"


Therefore the $19.3m number here is an adjustment figure to remove the non-cash flow element from the
interest income for held to maturity investments; it is not the actual interest income number for held to
maturity investments itself.


This is why I am asking Mithra where he got the $19.3m number from and why he chose it. I am giving the
author a chance to provide an explanation.

Retired Securities Attorney, Contributor
nemesisjudge,


Good catch. It's an adjustment to income (presumably shown as earned) to reconcile it to cash by operating
activities (which I will assume, perhaps incorrectly, is net operational cash flow).


It could mean that you have to add $19.3 million to cash received as income to get to the number they
reported. If you were going to point out that this could represent an original issue discount on the obligations
being held to maturity, I would agree with that. 
VIPS shows $772 million in "Held-to-maturity securities". $19.3 is 2.5% of that $772 million. One usually
thinks of US Treasury bills as what is represented by the phrase Held-to-maturity securities when it appears

on a certified financial statement and the "creators" of VIPS might have wanted you to think that. 
But that cannot be true. US Treasuries, or any safe way to invest surplus cash, yield less than 1% right now
and has for quite a while. So these are not the usual way of investing surplus cash. Where did it come from?


Well, VIPS borrowed $621 million on March 17, 2014 at 1.5% by issuing convertible notes. See note 14 on F-
34. I think that those convertible holders are expected to convert and sell the shares so that VIPS will never
need to repay what it borrowed. but the "related parties" who sold all that various difficult-to-value stuff to
VIPS for $(hundreds of millions) will get to keep it.


I may go bankrupt but I have a rich uncle.


Where does it all lead???

RSA - that's your understanding of convertible securities? Nice job! Now what do you think of Billions of
convertible securities routinely issued by Fortune 500 US companies?


30 May 2015, 02:37 PM


SevenSeas Investment Research, Contributor
What understanding of convertible securities was mentioned in RSA's comment? His reference is solely
applicable to VIP's specific issues, and nothing to do with fundamentals of convertibles. By saying those
investors or the company plan on converting their shares so the company can easily mask the transfer of
money to related parties( and you trying to twist that comment into something its not), is a clear and very
visible possibility of fraud that appears right in front of you. All these numbers don't coincidently fit together so
perfect. Coincidences never occur when it comes to numbers. The fact that the spread between what logical
money market securities or HTM securities yield these days, and the yield on those securities equals the
amounts in question says a lot. What a surprise it would be if we found out these related party transactions
turned out to be frauds. Jaw dropping events in a place like China.

17741882 - I was referring to RSA's "Well, VIPS borrowed $621 million on March 17, 2014 at 1.5% by issuing
convertible notes. See note 14 on F-34. I think that those convertible holders are expected to convert and sell

All convertible securities work that way unless the security is not worth converting at maturity and callable for
money.


As to related parties accusations or surprises, they are all accusations.


What will be surprising to me is a) If VIPS does not grow 10x next 5 years and crush the shorts b) If VIPS
does not realize 10x profits on its investment in Ovation / Lefeng or the related transactions c) VIPS does not
become an attractive buyout target to a larger player in China

I am counting on many upside surprises from VIPS owing to strong execution, management, tailwinds in
China Consumerism especially in eCommerce, penetration of mobile shoppers expected to grow into 700M in
China, etc. That's why I remain long VIPS for several years (go and see my original VIPS comments under
VIPS IPO article on SA)! All these years, I have seen many shorts folding along the way. Mithra shall be the
next to disappear soon IMO.

I wanted to revisit this article today after the massive sell-off due to missing guidance. If it were a fraud, they should
have been able to meet guidance, unless they were running out of cash to divert to the "balance sheet" to then
recycle in to the ballooning sales. The constant raising of funds, despite a very (on the surface) liquid balance sheet,
is the give away to this potential fraud


This makes me think that they are starting to run out of wiggle room and that this earnings miss is the tip of the
iceberg. If not, they should be calling their HTM loans in first.
