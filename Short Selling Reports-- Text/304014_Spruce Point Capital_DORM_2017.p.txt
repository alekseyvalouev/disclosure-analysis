ECHO


Report Date 1/15/14 (Prescience Point)* 7/13/17 9/8/16


Company 
Promotion


Best of breed recycled auto part distributor 
capable of effecting a roll-up strategy and 
producing consistent double digit revenue 


and EPS growth


Best of breed mirror “technology” company with 
world-leading gross margins capable of consistent 
double digit growth, achieving 90% market share, 


and effecting shareholder friendly policies


An effective roll-up acquirer in the third party 
logistics sector capable of extracting significant 
operating leverage and $200-$300m of revenue 
synergies from Command Transportation deal


Our Criticism LKQ is an ineffective roll-up by a 
management team with a history of 


financial failure (Waste Management / 
Discovery Zone). LKQ is caught in a gross 


margin squeeze being masked by relentless 
acquisitions, and aggressive inventory 


accounting open to 
significant management judgement  


Gross margins likely overstated by 2x through 
inventory and capex overstatement. CEO/Founder


has stacked the Board with former insiders, 
internally promoted finance/accounting 


individuals, and former external auditor as Audit 
Committee chair to prevent detection of the 


financial scheme. Product test and newly released 
FOIA evidence exposes Gentex’s misstatements


Echo’s management team has a history of value 
destruction, its roll-up strategy was ineffective, 
its organic growth was approaching zero, and 
its GAAP/Non-GAAP accounting was signaling 


financial strain. We argued it paid a peak 
multiple for Command and would never hit its 


synergy targets. We estimated 50%-60% 
downside risk in ECHO’s shares  


Successful 
Outcome


Gross margins have declined from over 47% 
to 39%. The company’s successive 


acquisition in Europe and domestically have 
failed to boost its share price. LKQ’s 


multiples have contracted significantly. Its 
CFO was replaced (Feb 2015) and its CEO 


recently stepped down (March 2017)


7/21/17: Gentex’s Q2’17 sales and earnings 
disappointment validate our concerns of a 
softening market. Significant gross margin 


contraction and admission by management that 
base mirrors carry 20% gross margins. Gentex’s 


share price fell 7.4% on earnings while executives 
did not address our concerns


In Q2’17 ECHO cut its FY17 revenue outlook 
and suspended longer-term guidance given 
changes in its end market and failure to hit 


synergy targets with Command. ECHO Sell-side 
brokers have finally downgraded their 


recommendations from Buy to Hold. ECHO’s 
shares fell to a 52 week low of $13, nearly 50%

Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Believes DORM Is A “Strong Sell”  
30% - 50% Downside For The Following Reasons:


Dorman Products (Nasdaq: DORM) is an aftermarket auto parts distributor stuck between a rock and a hard place as it sells both through 
Amazon, which is seeking to grow further into online auto parts distribution, and through the biggest brick and mortar retailers (Adv. Auto 
Parts / O’Reilly / AutoZone), which account for a majority of its sales, and are struggling with slower growth and margin pressure.  Spruce 
Point has conducted a deep fundamental and forensic accounting review of DORM and believe its opaque disclosures, aggressive accounting, 
and precarious industry positioning do not warrant its significant share price outperformance and premium valuation relative to peers. As a 
result, we see above average risk of continued earnings disappointment and meaningful share price correction


• Revenue Growth Slowing and Overstated: Revenue growth has slowed from a 13% CAGR (2009 to 2015) to less then 6% in 2016 (adjusted for 
extra week).  Furthermore, if you look under the hood, DORM’s net revenues are an estimate and therefore subject to significant manipulation.  
Our adjusted gross sales estimate (we define as total product places on the shelves of customers) slowed to an abysmal 1.5% in 2016. Analysts 
expect DORM to continue growing top-line sales at 7% which we believe to be difficult given its largest customers are growing low single digits


• Product Innovation Slowing, Prices Deflating: Unique products introduced declined 13% in 2016, the first contraction in years. Piecing 
together clues from DORM’s various disclosures, we estimate average revenue from new part introductions has been in a multiyear decline, 
while its annual R&D spend increases. DORM has no patent protection for its products, making it easy for competitors to copy key parts. 
Furthermore, its own product copies are increasingly being challenged by recent undisclosed litigation (eg. General Motors)


• Hidden Margin Benefits From Aggressive Capitalization and FX Tailwinds Coming To An End: We believe DORM’s earnings leverage is waning. 
Revenue and gross profit from active accounts slowed to low single digits in 2016. The weakening of the Chinese Yuan has been a hidden 
tailwind to gross margins in the last three years since DORM sources products heavily from China/Taiwan.  We estimate that DORM’s gross 
margins benefited by ~350bps cumulatively from 2014-2016. DORM doesn’t discuss any of these FX benefits in its MD&A, and now the Yuan is 
on a strengthening cycle.  DORM also embarked on an ERP implementation which was 163% over budget, and allowed it to capitalize $38m of 
costs from 2011-14. DORM has not amortized any of these costs, thereby inflating its earnings per share by $0.07c by our estimate


• Balance Sheet Strain Becoming More Evident:  DORM portrays itself as debt-free, but is heavily dependent on factoring receivables, which we 
believe should be evaluated as debt. The % of revenues that are factored annually has risen from 21% in 2009 to 65% in 2016 and exposes 
DORM to the increasing interest rate env’t.  DORM’s working capital to sales ratio is at a multi-year high, while operating cash flow in 2016 
abnormally increased from inventory declining - suggesting it liquidated or deferred new purchases to generate cash. DORM is also shifting its 
business strategy to invest in many undisclosed JV/minority investments, while opaque related-party purchases are increasing


• Valuation Premium Unwarranted, 30%-50% Downside Risk: The Berman family, DORM’s controlling shareholder, has been selling heavily in 
recent years along with DORM’s top long-term fundamental owners, using company cash to repurchase shares. Just two analysts see 18% 
upside, while the market ascribes a premium multiple of 2.5x, 11x, and 20x 2017E Sales, EBITDA and EPS. We normalize DORM’s financials for 
aggressive cost capitalization and adjust its enterprise value for minority investments and factored receivables as debt. If DORM traded in-line 
with its aftermarket auto part peers at 1.1x-1.5x 17E sales, 2x-3x book value,  or 13x-15x 17E P/E we justify 30%- 50% downside risk potential

DORM’s Adjusted Valuation


Source: DORM Filings, Wall. St Estimates
1) Pro forma adjusts the balance sheet to treat accounts securitization programs as debt and for recent minority investments 
2) Includes amortization costs over 10yrs and assumes a 35% tax rate for DORM’s aggressively capitalized ERP project 


$ in millions, except per  share figures


DORM’s valuation is rich and fails to correctly adjust its financials for its “hidden” debt through aggressive 
factoring policies, as well as for recent minority interest investments which DORM fails to give proper transparency 


for, and analysts fail to account for in their valuation.

Evidence of Financial Struggles
9


DORM’s Suspicious Financial Activities Started 
When Macro Drivers Turned Negative 


The typical warranty period for a new car ranges from 3 to 5 years.  Therefore, we estimate that DORM’s sweet spot for 
aftermarket parts is mainly concentrated in vehicles that are 6-12 years old. Not surprisingly, we find that DORM’s 
aggressive financial and accounting policies started post 2013 when its addressable market declined significantly.


The next three years also do not bode well for DORM as evidence emerges that peak auto production is 2016.

 The electric vehicle has one moving part, the motor, whereas the gasoline-powered vehicle has hundreds of 
moving parts. Fewer moving parts in the electric vehicle leads to another important difference: 
 The electric vehicle requires less periodic maintenance and is more reliable 


 The gasoline-powered vehicle requires a wide range of maintenance, from frequent oil changes, filter 
replacements, periodic tune ups, and exhaust system repairs, to the less frequent component replacement, such as 
the water pump, fuel pump, alternator, etc


 The electric vehicle‘s maintenance requirements are fewer and therefore the maintenance costs are lower. The 
electric motor has one moving part, the shaft, which is very reliable and requires little or no maintenance  (source)


Car Electrification A Longer-Term 
Negative For DORM


Predictions for the rate of electric vehicle growth vary widely. However, we can safely assume incremental unit growth 
and market share gains vs. traditional gas-powered vehicles is a negative for aftermarket auto part suppliers such as 


DORM. Electric vehicles have fewer part and require less maintenance according to government studies.

 Although, it might be easy for Amazon to penetrate the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) business, where the customer can 
accept delivery over 1-3 days, the Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) channel is different.  Typically, the DIFM portion of the 
aftermarket business will require a part in less than an hour (i.e. while the car is on the beam), which is not a time 
delivery capability that Amazon can currently accommodate.  On the DIY side of the business, customers that we 
have spoken with believe that there are conversations that need to be had in the store, and price is not the only 
customer consideration


 During the course of our diligence, we reviewed commentary from some of DORM’s largest customers who are 
monitoring the situation, and prepared to make competitive responses if DORM’s market strategy significantly 
conflicts with their own:


 Potential responses include: direct sourcing of product or striking larger deals with some of DORM’s 
competitors


 DORM’s top 4 customers represent 60% of their GAAP revenues and “concentration amongst customers” is a risk 
that we believe is largely being ignored. One customer we heard from specifically believed that DORM’s 
escalating SKU proliferation on major omni-channel websites is degrading its brand.  Furthermore, should 
Amazon begin to impede on the business of the Big 3, a competitive response should be expected


 Eventually the power of DORM’s core customer base may not bode well for it. Also, given Amazon’s increasing 
heft and power, what would stop it from further disintermediating the supply channel by going direct to source 
products from China and Taiwan? 


Bulls Giving Too Much Weight To DORM’s 
Amazon Partnership To Bail It Out


We believe DORM’s share price has outperformed since investors have been optimistic about recent press stating that 
DORM has signed a deal with Amazon to distribute auto parts. (1) 


Spruce Point has done its own independent channel checks, and believes that expectations should be tempered. 
We believe DORM risks significantly agitating its largest customers due to the inherent channel conflict of competing 


directly against its biggest customers.

DORM’s Largest Customers Are Already

DORM’s largest customers are in the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) retail market with 60% of revenues going to its top 4

Signs of Slowing Revenue Growth


1) Adjusts 2016 for 52 week year for comparison purposes
2) The provision deducted from gross sales to arrive at GAAP revenues is reported annually at the end of the 10K (Schedule II: Valuation and Qualifying Accounts)


DORM’s reported revenue growth is “net” of certain adjustments such as customer credits. The Company applies 
heavy customer credits (disclosed only annually) and last year’s results included an extra week too. The credit 


provisions are subject to significant estimation by management. We think investors should focus on gross sales. By 
pro forma adjusting results, we estimate an anemic 1.5% growth rate last year – hardly exciting.

Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Customer Credits. Revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are 
shipped, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured. We record

Declining New Part Introductions and 
Price Deflation Weighing on DORM


1) Disclosed 10-K Annual Report
2) Disclosed in year end press release


DORM’s financial reporting obscures its new product price deflation – you have to look carefully both at the press 
release and 10-K Annual Report. Upon close inspection, we find that unique part introductions declined in 2016, while 


its R&D spending is increasing, and average revenue from new products decreases.

DORM Lacks Patent Protections, 
Counterfeits and Litigation Risk Rising


In our view, DORM’s business is fraught with business risk given that it has nothing proprietary and is not listed as 
the inventor for any patents (1). A portion of its business model appears to be copying other companies products, 
and protecting none of its own. The rise of counterfeit auto parts (90% estimated to come from China where DORM 


sources products(2)) and escalation of copyright infringement litigation risk from major OEMs such as GM are 
unappreciated risks to the DORM growth story.


Counterfeit Auto Part Headlines


(1) US Patent Office Search. DORM says ““While we take steps to register our trademarks and 
copyrights when possible, we believe that our business is not heavily dependent on such trademark 
and copyright registration.” 10K, p. 7 (2) Ruttencutter, Dept. Homeland Security, Aug 2017 (3) 
DORM’s 2015 10-K started listing claims of IP infringement from OEMs as a risk factor but has never 
mentioned the GM lawsuit or others specifically

Potentially Misleading 
Balance Sheet Claims To Investors


Source: DORM’s May 2017 Investor Presentation


We previously called out CECO Environmental for its aggressive investor presentation materials which understated its 
true financial leverage. (1) The Company corrected its materials after our criticism.


We view DORM’s presentation of its financial leverage as even more distorted. 
It makes the bold claim that its balance sheet is strong with no debt and working capital trends are stable.

DORM sells its accounts receivables through customer sponsored programs to financial institutions. In the absence 
of selling its receivables, DORM discloses the additional receivables that would have been outstanding. If it could not 
sell these receivables, it would certainly have to borrow on its credit facility or issue long-term debt to fund itself. Our 
research suggests that DORM’s customers could delay paying those receivables up to a year. DORM runs the interest 
costs of these factoring programs through its income statement in the SG&A line – further evidence to us that DORM 
would like to obfuscate this form of debt. From an analytical perspective, we believe investors should adjust DORM’s 


financials to consider its hidden debt.


Note rising interest costs

Working Capital Strain 


Recall that DORM tells investors that its working capital trends are stable.
In our opinion, the strain on DORM’s financial condition can be seen by its increasing working capital intensity. 
We evaluate DORM’s working capital as a percentage of revenues and find that it has reached a cyclical high.

Inventory Liquidation To Boost Cash?


Bolstering our suspicion of unsustainable cash flow, we observe that 2016 represented the largest contribution of 
inventory to operating cash flow in DORM’s recent history. On the surface, it looks as if either DORM liquidated 


inventory and/or delayed replenishing new inventory to accelerate cash flow.

Aggressive Cost Capitalization: 
DORM’s ERP Implementation Over Budget


During the period DORM’s management was selling stock and the Company buying, DORM was selling investors on 
the benefits of its new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The Company initially estimated it would cost 


just $14.4m and revised estimates twice. The final cost came in at $37.9m or 163% higher than initial estimates. 
Either DORM was completely sloppy in its financial estimates, or the Company intended to aggressively capitalize 


costs to inflate earnings and its share price.


DORM FY DORM’s Commentary on its ERP 


2011


In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we began a project to replace our enterprise resource planning system. This 
project is expected to cost approximately $14.4 million in software, installation services and capitalized 
internal costs in 2010 through 2013. Through December 31, 2011, we have spent $6.6 million on the project, 
of which $4.8 million was spent in fiscal 2011.


2012


In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we began a project to replace our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) 
system. This project is expected to cost between $21.5 million and $24.5 million for capitalized software, 
installation services and internal costs through 2014. Through December 29, 2012, we have spent $15.4 
million on the project, of which $8.7 million was spent in fiscal 2012, $4.8 was spent in fiscal 2011 and $1.9 
million was spent in fiscal 2010.


2013


In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we began a project to replace our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) 
system. This project is expected to cost between $36 million and $39 million for capitalized software, 
installation services and internal costs through 2014. Through December 28, 2013, we have paid $22.7 
million for the project, of which $7.4 million was spent in fiscal 2013, $8.7 million was spent in fiscal 2012 and 
$4.8 was spent in fiscal 2011. The installation of the new ERP system was completed at one of our subsidiaries 
in January 2013 without any disruption to our operations.


2014


Our new ERP system was installed in two phases, the last of which was completed on September 29, 2014. 
Through December 27, 2014, we have capitalized $37.9 million related to the project of which $15.2 million 
was spent in fiscal 2014, $7.4 million was spent in fiscal 2013, and $8.7 million was spent in fiscal 2012. The 
installation of the new ERP system was completed without significant disruption to our operations.

Where Is DORM’s Amortization Expenses 
Associated With The ERP?


We believe DORM should be amortizing expenses associated with its ERP implementation. There are ample 
examples of public companies amortizing these costs. As can be seen from DORM’s results, its amortization 


expense has been declining subsequent to completing its ERP, not rising as would be expected. We estimate DORM 
has boosted its EPS by at least $0.07c per annum by avoiding amortization of ERP expenses (1)

project planning costs associated with the project were expensed as incurred, while software license, integration, testing and other direct costs associated with 
the application development phase were capitalized. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, capitalized software costs for the ERP system totaling $3.8 million and 
$3.3 million, respectively, is included on the balance sheet within fixed assets. Amortization of internal use software began on August 1, 2007 and is being 
recorded on a straight-line basis over five years. Amortization of internal use software was $512 for the year ended March 31, 2008. (Source: 10-K, F-16)

For internally-generated intangible assets, the Corporation records the costs directly attributable to the acquisition and development of an enterprise

How Transparent Is DORM’s Disclosure 
About Its Gross Margins?


DORM Has Been Pressed Before By The SEC For More MD&A Disclosures About Revenue/Cost Drivers…


SEC Question To DORM:  “We note that your current discussion of changes in results of operations for the various periods presented in 
your financial statements includes a discussion of the factors responsible for the changes in the various categories of revenue and expenses 
but does not provide adequate quantification as to how each factor impacted your results of operations for the various periods presented. 
Where multiple factors impact a line item in your financial statements, please revise to quantify, where practical, how each factor impacted 
your reported results of operations for the periods presented.”


DORM’s Response: “Our MD&A discussion of changes in our results of operations in future filings shall include, where practical, a 
quantification of how each factor responsible for changes in the various categories of revenue and expenses impacts the reported results of 
operations for the periods presented.”


Source: SEC Comment Letter: 1/8/13


Net sales increased 11% over the prior year to $570.4 million from $513.4 million last year. Excluding the impact of an additional $4.8 
million in sales due to a fifty-third week in fiscal 2011, revenues increased 12% over fiscal 2011 levels. Our revenue growth continues 
to be driven by overall strong demand for our products and higher new product sales.


Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of net sales decreased to 62.3% in fiscal 2012 from 63.1% in the same period last year. Lower 
transportation costs contributed approximately one-half of the difference. The remaining variance was primarily the result of a favorable 
sales mix towards higher margin products, and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory which were $1.0 million lower in fiscal 2012 
than in fiscal 2011.


Net sales increased 7% to $859.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $803.0 in fiscal 2015. Our revenue growth was driven by overall strong 
demand for our products and an additional week of sales in fiscal 2016.


Gross profit margin was 39.3% in fiscal 2016 compared to 38.4% in fiscal 2015. The increased gross profit margin was primarily due to a 
favorable sales mix towards higher margin products, leverage of costs across higher sales volume, and approximately $2.0 million of 
lower inventory provisions which were partially offset by lower overall selling prices during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.

FX Rates: Substantial Hidden Tailwind


The weakening of the Chinese Yuan has been a hidden tailwind to gross margins in the last two years: As illustrated in 
the table below, we estimate that DORM’s gross margins benefited by 3% in FY16.  In DORM’s MD&A, they do not 


quantify the gross margin benefit from the weakening Chinese Yuan.  Therefore, investors are left with a potentially 
misleading view about underlying operational factors driving the reported 90bp gross margin expansion.

CNY per US$ - Has It Finally Bottomed?


DORM’s Discussion on FX Without Quantifying The Effect: “To the extent that the U.S. Dollar changes in value relative to foreign currencies in the future, 
the price of the product for new purchase orders may change in equivalent U.S. Dollars. The largest portion of our overseas purchases comes from China. 
The Chinese Yuan to U.S. Dollar exchange rate has fluctuated over the past several years. Any future changes in the value of the Chinese Yuan relative to 
the U.S. Dollar may result in a change in the cost of products that we purchase from China. (Source: 2016 10-K, p. 20)

Careful Look At “Other Assets”


Be careful of shifting of assets – DORM moved inventories into Other Assets - now calls it “Long-Term Core Inventory” (1)


DORM 2014 10-K


DORM 2013 10-K. (1) DORM says “long-term core inventory represents products used in remanufacturing processes, and consists of used cores 
purchased and held in our facilities, used cores that are in the process of being returned from our customers and end-users, and remanufactured cores 
held in finished goods inventory at our facilities” Spruce Point notes that even LKQ, which discloses significant core part holdings in inventory, does not 
classify any of these as long-term assets (10-K, p. 70)

Suspicious Minority Investments and 
Rising Related-Party Purchases


DORM’s business is becoming more opaque. It has made numerous undisclosed Joint Venture and Minority Investments, 
while ramping up related-party purchases. Its Long-Term “Other Assets” account with cores has also been rising rapidly. 


We caution that DORM could be using this account to improve operating cash flow, or delay inventory impairment.

“Equity Income” Earnings Absent From 
DORM’s Income Statement


DORM states it has equity method investments.  Income from these equity investments (the earnings from the minority 
investments) are not being reported through its income statement – why? Proper accounting and best financial 


presentation practices dictates that DORM should have a line item on its income statement to break out the 
contributions. In the table below, we show other auto supply companies using proper disclosure

Suspect Reclassifications


If rebates to a customer were erroneously calculated it suggests that DORM’s COGS were under reported or 
sales were over reported. In our view, this reclassification should have been run through the income statement 


where the reduction in A/R was offset by a reduction in shareholders equity.   DORM chose to adjust as an 
accrued liability.  This further demonstrates how Dorman can potentially manipulate its financials


• Re-classification of an Additional Liability was “deemed 
immaterial” and DORM decided not to restate historical 
financials. In the 2013 10K, DORM found that they had 
underestimated “Customer Rebates”. In order to “balance 
the B/S”, the company increased their A/R. This was 
achieved by reducing the A/R reserve


• From DORM’s 2013 10K – Reclassifications: 


“The previously reported Consolidated Financial 
Statements include an adjustment to present accrued 
customer rebates which may be settled in cash as an 
accrued liability. The effect of this reclassification 
adjustment was a $6.4 million increase to accounts 
receivable and other accrued liabilities as of December 
29, 2012. We believe the adjustment is inconsequential to 
any previous annual or interim Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Additionally, certain other amounts in the 
prior-years Consolidated Financial Statements have been 
reclassified to conform with current-year presentation.”

Audit Fee Warning


We always warn investors to look carefully at the audit fees being paid.
In the case of DORM, we observe that its audit fees are abnormally low relative to peers.


When viewed in context of the accounting abnormalities we’ve observed, we caution investors to remember the phrase
“you get what you pay for”

Bull vs. Bear Debate on DORM


• “xxx


• xxxx


Bull Case Spruce Point Bear View


Revenue Growth
New to Aftermarket parts will continue to help DORM’s 
growth profile and it will return to double digit growth. 


New Part introduction is slowing.  R&D is increasing. Electric
vehicles and fewer parts per car a major headwind. Cars in DORM’s 


sweet spot of 6-12yrs have limited growth outlook


Gross Margins Highest gross margins in company history will persist
We estimate 3% gross margin benefit is largely do to weakened 


Yuan vs. USD. The Yuan is now strengthening


Free Cash Flow
Significant free cash flow growth


$37m (2013) to $101m (2016)
FCF is coming from increased factoring, unsustainable gross margin 


tailwinds, inventory liquidation and reduced Capex 


Capital Structure 
and 


Capital Allocation


No debt and significant financial flexibility; 
Returning Value Through Share Repurchases


Company’s AR programs are debt. Interest expense disguised in 
SG&A. ERP financial planning was a disaster. 


Insiders selling while Company is buying


HD Solutions Natural extension of aftermarket parts
Still less then a $20M business after being introduced over four 


years ago.  DORM notes that HD Solution was approaching 2% of 
company sales in 2Q16. 


Acquisition
Strategy


Acquisition strategy is aiding growth in adjacent markets 
in hybrid batteries (Re-Involt), chassis and suspension 


(Ingalls), drive shafts and driveline products (PTI) 


We can't find any evidence that these acquisitions have aided in 
revenues or net income.  In our view, DORM may be avoiding 
transparent reporting of equity + JV investments either due to 


poor performance or obfuscation of related-party dealing


Legal No material litigation risk Multiple ongoing patent lawsuits with GM and other big players


Accounting Take management’s word everything is fine
Numerous reclassifications and signs of aggressive accounting, 


most notably no amortization of ERP costs 


Amazon
Amazon disintermediating the supply channel and 


cutting out the BIG 4 will allow for more margin to be 
shared between Amazon and DORM


Should Amazon be successful, a response from the Big 4 is likely 
which currently represents 60% of DORM’s customer base
36


Warning: DORM Should Not Be 
Outperforming Its Customers/Sector


DORM’s stock price has outpaced its top customers for no good reason. While “The Big Three” struggle with poor 
recent performance and slowing SSS comps, DORM’s share price is making all-time highs. We believe part of the 


increase is on false hope that DORM is a play on Amazon’s move into the sector.

DORM Trading At An Unjustified 
Premium To Its Peers 


DORM trades at an irrational premium to both its customers and aftermarket auto part manufacturers and distributors. 
DORM’s top customers are expected to grow sales by ~3% yet analysts believe DORM can grow closer to 8%. 


We believe this optimism should be tempered, especially in light of our illustration that DORM’s adjusted sales growth has 
been underperforming its customers in the past two years. At best, we give DORM the benefit of the doubt that it can match 


industry growth

At 4x book value, DORM is significantly 
overvalued relative to peers. DORM should 
trade at a discount as a result of its financial 


statements and management team being 
less transparent (eg. DORM doesn’t hold 


conference calls)


$ in millions, except per share amounts


It’s easy to see meaningful downside in DORM’s price using a variety of valuation methods. DORM’s current multiple 
is unjustified given its lack of transparency, fragile industry position, and signs of reduced earnings leverage.
