Riddle me this, Riddle me that, why did JKS consistently fail to generate free cash flow despite reported profits? 


Because Chairman Li looted JKS and reported fraudulent financial statements to the SEC.   





We believe that JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE:  JKS) (“JinkoSolar” “JKS” or the “Company”) exists 
for the sole purpose of developing PRC assets with JKS’ cash that were disposed to Chairman Li at a significant 
discount to market.  An older vintage of US-listed Chinese fraud, JKS was fattened up with 5 separate equity 


issuances and US$ 2+ billion in net debt only to be stripped of value by insiders.  This is why JKS, despite its 
purported profitability, had failed to generate free cash flow or pay shareholders cash dividends.  


 
Evidence shows that Chairman Li privatized JKS’ most valuable assets for himself, leaving JKS shareholders 
saddled with debts and construction cost liabilities.  In 2011, JKS established Jinko Power Technology Co., Ltd. 


(“JinkoPower”) as a vehicle to construct solar farm power plants that sold electricity to the Chinese State Grid 
at up to a 33% net income margin, much more profitable than JKS’ 1% net income margin manufacturing solar 
modules.   


 
In October 2016, JinkoPower was sold to Chairman Li at a US$ 455 million valuation (RMB 3.2 billion).  ONE 
MONTH AFTER Chairman Li purchased JinkoPower at a US$ 455 million valuation from JKS, 


JinkoPower received an independent appraisal valuation of US$ 720 million accompanied by a PRC 


insider equity raise at a US$ 788 million valuation.  To us, the evidence is clear that Chairman Li acquired 


JinkoPower at a 40+% discount to market value.  
 
Using US$ 650+ million of JKS’ financial support, Chairman Li grew JinkoPower in 3 years as a private 


company to seek a US$ 3.6 billion IPO valuation (RMB 25 billion) in 2020, a valuation 692% higher than what 
Chairman Li paid JKS for JinkoPower! 
 


In addition, Chinese filings reveal Chairman Li’s brother and JKS co-counder Li Xianhua secretly benefitted 
from controlling a signficant supplier within JKS’ supply chain, a PV glass supplier called Xinruixin, which 


once again resulted in value meant for shareholders ultimately making its way to Chairman Li and his brother.  
  
Evidence showed that JKS fabricated its 2017 and 2018 financial statements by including US$ 209 million of 


fake sales to Australia and by omitting US$ 42 million in customs duties that JKS remains liable for in South 
Africa.  
 


We are short JKS because we think its equity is ultimately worthless.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 


 
We believe that Chairman Li defrauded foreign investors out of US$ billions, included fake sales and profits in 
its SEC reported financials, omitted US$ 42 million in liabilities from its balance sheet, and engaged in multiple 


undisclosed related party transactions to benefit insiders at the expense of minority shareholders.   
 
In short, Chairman Li tried to get away with a lot of nefarious dealings, many not well hidden and easily 


noticeable by even a novice financial analyst.  Since 2013, JKS has failed to generate free cash flow despite its 
purported profitability.  JKS’ net debt was at an all-time high, with US$ 2.3 billion in short term borrowings as 


of 3Q’19.  Much of JKS’ reported assets are restricted cash, receivables, and inventory.  JKS’ solar module 
inventory was at an all-time high of US$ 850 million while average silicon solar module spot price continues to 
decline.  JKS is in the low margin commoditized product business.  Any small swing in reported sales, profits 


or costs could have a material negative impact on JKS’ financial performance.  
 
Some things are a bit harder to understand. For example, our investigators in South Africa visited the storefront 


of the alleged independent third party that Chairman Li stuffed with US$ 42 million of unpaid customs duties to 
the South Africa Revenue Service (“SARS”).  We found a former minimart and bbq chicken location that had 


been turned into a wall of cheap clothes and backpacks.

The theft at JKS was pervasive. Our report is certainly not a comprehensive list of problems at JKS.  In this report we 


discuss ways that Chairman Li used JKS to subsidize construction costs for JinkoPower and increase the valuation of 


his privately held PRC assets yet saddled JKS shareholders with construction cost liabilities.  








1. CHAIRMAN LOOTED JINKOSOLAR OF US$ BILLIONS:  In October 2016, JKS disposed of JinkoPower 
to Chairman Li at a US$ 455 million valuation (RMB 3.2 billion).  ONE MONTH LATER, in November 2016, 


JinkoPower received an independent appraisal valuation of US$ 720 million (RMB 5 billion) and raised capital 


from PRC insiders at a valuation of US$ 788 million. To us, the facts are crystal clear that Chairman Li acquired 


JinkoPower at a 40+% discount to market value. 





Post-disposal Chairman Li continued to financially support JinkoPower with JKS’ resources.  Using an additional 


RMB 533 million in solar modules yet to be paid for and US$ 593 million in balance sheet support, Chairman Li 


grew JinkoPower in 3 years as a private company to seek a US$ 3.6 billion IPO valuation (RMB 25 billion) in 


2020, a valuation 692% higher than what Chairman Li paid JKS for JinkoPower!  None of this increased value 


made its way to JKS’ balance sheet, instead JKS got construction debts.  





2. CHAIRMAN LI’S BROTHER BENEFITS FROM SECRETLY CONTROLLING KEY SUPPLIER:  
Chinese filings revealed Chairman Li’s brother and JKS co-counder Li Xianhua secretly benefitted from secretly 


controlling a signficant PV glass manufacturer within JKS’ supply chain called Zhejiang Xinruixin Energy Co., 


Ltd. (浙江新瑞欣能源股份有限公司) (“Xinruixin”).  Xinruixin’s Chinese IPO Prospectus revealed that during 
its track record period, JKS contributed to more than 99% of Xinruixin’s revenues and that it supplied 20% of 


JKS Solar’s total PV anti-reflection glass purchases from 2014 to 1Q’16. Xinruixin’s business would not have 


existed without the support of JKS.  Xinruixin is yet another example whereby value meant for shareholders was 


diverted to Chairman Li and his brother. 





3. OVERSTATED AUSTRALIAN SOLAR MODULE SALES BY US$ 209 MILLION:  Evidence shows that 
JKS fabricated its 2017 and 2018 financial statements by including US$ 209 million of fake sales to Australia.  


JKS’ SEC filings reported Australian sales that accelerated from US$ 37 million (RMB 261 million) in 2016 to 


US$ 302+ million (RMB 2+ billion) in 2018, up 696% in 2 years. Australian Securities & Investments 


Commission (“ASIC”) database filings for JKS’ only Australian operating subsidiary, Jinko Solar Australia 


Holdings Co., Pty Ltd. (“JKS Australia”) corroborated the accuracy of JKS’ SEC-reported Australian sales figures 


in 2015 and 2016.  However, in 2017 and 2018, JKS’ SEC-reported Australian sales figures were US$ 209 million 


higher than what was reported by JKS’ ASIC filings, which showed that JKS fabricated its SEC-reported 


Australian sales in 2017 and 2018.  





4. UNDERSTATED LIABILITIES BY US$ 42 MILLION:   Evidence shows that JKS lied about the disposal of 
its South African subsidiary to an independent third party and that JKS remains liable for US$ 42 million of 


customs duties owed to South African authorities that should be reflected on JKS’ current consolidated financial 


statements.  Who is this mystery independent third party that wanted to acquire JKS South Africa despite its 


customs duties liability overhang? South Africa Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (“CIPC”) 


details for JKS South Africa revealed an address change in 2018 to 64 Kort Street, Parys, Free State. 





In February 2020, we sent investigators to 64 Kort Street, Parys, Free State 9585 South Africa to visit the 


“independent third party” that acquired JKS South Africa and relocated it from Cape Town to Parys, Free State.  


Our investigators found a former minimart and a bbq chicken location that had been turned into a wall of cheap 


clothes and backpacks. We verified that the storefront was the same registered physical address for a separate 


logistics company maintained by JKS South Africa’s long-time sole director Wei Lu.  Our assumption is that JKS 


South Africa’s US$ 42 million liability is being held by an undisclosed insider.

CHAIRMAN LOOTED JINKOSOLAR OF US$ BILLIONS  





Jinko Power Technology Co., Ltd. (“JinkoPower”) operates solar farm power plants that sell electricity to the Chinese 


State Grid at up to a 33% net income margin for some of its farms, a much more profitable business than JKS’ 1% net 


income margin as a solar module manufacturer.1  The strategic decision to enter the downstream solar farm market 


was easily accepted by investors considering JKS’ solar module manufacturing capacity and low procurement costs.2 





JKS established JinkoSolar in 2011 and for 5 years JKS allocated resources and capital expenditure investments 


towards JinkoPower, but since it was an intercompany transaction, no detailed SEC disclosure was required.  However, 


JinkoPower’s December 2018 Chinese IPO Prospectus revealed that JKS supplied JinkoPower with RMB 2.3 billion 


worth of solar modules during the 2 years prior to the sale of JinkPower to Chairman Li.3 





In October 2016, JKS disposed of JinkoPower to Chairman Li at a US$ 455 million valuation (RMB 3.2 billion).  


ONE MONTH LATER, in November 2016, JinkoPower received an independent appraisal valuation of US$ 720 


million (RMB 5 billion) and raised capital from PRC insiders at a valuation of US$ 788 million. To us, the facts are 


crystal clear that Chairman Li acquired JinkoPower at a 40+% discount to market value. 





 
Source: JinkoPower November 2019 Chinese IPO Prospectus – p.1-1-61 





Then 3 months later in February 2017, JinkoPower raised an additional US$ 285 million from third parties at 


a US$ 1.5 billion valuation, 200+% greater than what Chairman Li paid JKS for JinkoPower.4  





Post-disposal Chairman Li continued to financially support JinkoPower with JKS’ resources.  JKS’ 20-F disclosed 


that from 4Q’16 thru 2018, JKS sold JinkoPower RMB 528 million of solar modules, of which JinkoPower still owed 


JKS RMB 523 million for purchased solar modules as of CYE’18. 5  


 
This is in addition to US$ 593 million in financial guarantees JKS provided as a backstop for JinkoPower’s existing 


loan obligations, for a total outstanding FYE’18 financial support of US$ 650+ million.

On 30 Nov 20216, Jinko Power Co., Ltd. held a board meeting and resolved to 


increase its share capital from US$600 million to US$630 million (including 


paid-in capital of US$ 20,796,709.59), with the capital increase to be paid by 


Jinshi Energy with US$37.5 million or equivalent in cash. 





Jinshi Energy was set up as a platform for Jinko Power’s employees to hold 


company stock and gives them the opportunity to share in the company’s 


growth. 





This capital increase was valued at RMB5,027 million, slightly higher than its 


assessed valuation. Before the capital increase, the static P/E (refer to the 2016 


net profit attributable to the parent company) was 34.01 and the dynamic P/E 


(refer to the 2017 net profit attributable to the parent company) was 7.49.

As of CYE’18, JinkoPower used US$ 593 million in balance sheet support from JKS and an additional RMB 523 


million in solar modules yet to be paid for in 3 years as a private company.  If JKS was prepared to commit ~US$ 


650+ million to JinkoPower’s growth immediately after disposal to Chairman Li, if not for the sole benefit of Chairman 


Li?    





Using US$ 650+ million of JKS’ financial support, Chairman Li grew JinkoPower in 3 years as a private company to 


seek a US$ 3.6 billion IPO valuation (RMB 25 billion) in 2020, a valuation 692% higher than what Chairman Li paid 


JKS for JinkoPower!

Potentially alarming for shareholders, JinkoPower purchased significantly fewer solar modules from JKS versus other 


solar module manufacturers in the last 2 years. In 2018, JKS sold only RMB 39 million of solar modules to 


JinkoPower, less than 1% of JinkoPower’s total purchases in 2018. JinkoPower disclosed that JKS was no longer in 


the list of its top 10 suppliers by purchase amounts. Instead, the top suppliers include several other solar module 


producers including LONGi Solar (SHSE: 601012), Jolywood (SHSE: 300393).  





 
Source: JinkoPower November 2019 Chinese IPO Prospectus p. 1-1-272 





At the time of disposal, JKS avoided scrutiny by championing the JinkoPower disposal as a significant benefit for 


JKS shareholders. JKS booked an egregious non-cash gain of US$ 145 million (RMB 1 billion) which served its 


purpose to distract critics from further inquiry and questions.  JKS’ audit passed and the disposal of JinkoPower was 


considered part of a broader change in strategy to refocus JKS’ core business back onto solar module manufacturing 


rather than downstream solar power plants.  





 
Source: JKS 2017 20-F p. F-25 





Chairman Li did not stop at simply stealing value from JKS, he wanted JKS out of the business.  Without explanation, 


another self-serving clause was embedded into the sale agreement of JinkoPower.  Unlike a more typical 5-year non-


compete restriction, the commitment JKS made was absolute and timeless: JKS will “cease developing new 


downstream solar projects” and that JKS’ “existing offshore downstream solar power projects that we are 


constructing and will connect to the grid” will be transferred to JinkoPower.

This deprived JKS shareholders of any future business opportunity or profits should JKS decide to use its remaining 


inventory to build its own downstream solar power plants and sell high profit margin electricity to the Chinese Grid.  


In 1H’19, JinkoPower reported an 11% net income margin on its electricity sales, signficantly better than the 1% profit 


margins JKS generated from manufacturing solar modules. 





We understand why Chairman Li would want less competition and more barriers to entry, but why would JKS agree 


to this blanket restriction given its market leader position in solar module manufacturing capacity and the obviously 


higher margin enjoyed by the downstream segment?   





It’s a bunch of bullshit.  In 2010 JKS was predominantly a silicon wafer manufacturer.  Within one year of its IPO, 


JKS redirected its IPO proceeds to invest in solar module capacity used to build JinkoPower solar farm power plants. 


Once significantly completed, JKS disposed of JinkoPower to Chairman Li at a significant discount to market value 


while he directed JKS resources to finance the growth of JinkoPower and other non-core international solar farm 


power plant projects that never turned out to benefit JKS shareholders.

CHAIRMAN LI’S BROTHER BENEFITS FROM SECRETLY CONTROLLING KEY SUPPLIER  





Chinese filings reveal Chairman Li’s brother and JKS co-counder Li Xianhua (“Li Xianhua”) secretly benefitted from 


controlling a signficant PV glass manufacturer within JKS’ supply chain called Zhejiang Xinruixin Energy Co., Ltd. 


(浙江新瑞欣能源股份有限公司) (“Xinruixin”).   
 


Xinruixin’s Chinese IPO Prospectus revealed that during its track record period from 2014 to 1Q’16, JKS contributed 


to more than 99% of Xinruixin’s revenues and that it supplied 20% of JKS Solar’s total PV anti-reflection glass 


purchases.  Xinruixin’s business is to service JKS exclusively, so why is Xinruixin not part of JKS? 





We think the answer is because PRC insiders wanted to benefit from secretly controlling a part of JKS’ supply chain 


using JKS to fund its growth and to ultimately raise capital at higher valuations from investors.  Evidence reveals that 


Li Xianhua secretly controlled Xinruixin and used JKS resources to benefit the private holdings of Chairman Li and 


his brother.  





Xinruixin was incorporated in February 2011 and listed on the National Equities Exchange and Quotations market in 


China (ticker: NEEQ 839764) in November 2016.

Xinruixin Wire needed cash and borrowed up to RMB 35 million in two tranches in March 2017 and July 2017.

Li Xianhua was not a shareholder of Xinruixin or Xinruixin Wire at the time when Xinruixin Wire took up the

had significant influence over Xinruixin / Xinruixin Wire or was closely connected for banks to accept corporate 


guarantees from his company. In fact, Zhejiang Qiusuo was Xinruixin Wire’s only guarantor for its first loan (of up 


to RMB 20 million). Why would Li Xianhua do that if he was not connected to Xinruixin / Xinruixin Wire?

additional responsibilities, such as Chairman, Legal Rep, and Manager of Xinruixin Wire.

As of the date of this report, Li Xianhua maintained 35.1% interest in Xinruixin Wire via his 100% ownership interest 


in Shangrao Qiusuo and his 10.45% stake in Haining Trade.8  Shangrao Qiusuo’s primary contact information listed 


a JKS employee.

We believe the evidence suggests Li Xianhua had significant control over Xinruixin / Xinruixin Wire even before 


November 2017 and Xinruixin’s disposal of Xinruixin Wire was orchestrated to transfer legal ownership to Li Xianhua 


without triggering related party transaction disclosure requirements. 





Xinruixin’s business would not have existed without the support of JKS.  Firstly, 99%+ of Xinruixin’s sales during 


the track record period were from JKS.  Secondly, Li Xianhua’s private enterprise Zhejiang Qiusuo guaranteed 


financing arrangements for Xinruixin when he wasn’t even a Xinruixin shareholder.  Thirdly, through two separate 


equity disposals in 4Q’17, roughly ~50% of Xinruixin’s assets were disposed to insiders led by Li Xianhua.

OVERSTATED AUSTRALIAN SOLAR MODULE SALES BY US$ 209 MILLION  





With sales to the United States in decline since 2016, JKS buoyed its international sales with growth from other 


countries, specifically Australia.  By 2018 Australia had become one of JKS’ three largest export markets.  





 
Source: JKS 2018 20-F – p. 11 





JKS’ SEC filings reported that Australian sales that accelerated from US$ 37 million (RMB 261 million) in 2016 to 


US$ 302+ million (RMB 2+ billion) in 2018, up 696% in 2 years.  





 
Source: 2018 20-F p. 58 





Australian Securities & Investments Commission (“ASIC”) database filings for JKS’ only Australian operating 


subsidiary, Jinko Solar Australia Holdings Co., Pty Ltd. (“JKS Australia”) corroborated the accuracy of JKS’ SEC-


reported Australian sales figures in 2015 and 2016.9   





However, in 2017 and 2018, JKS’ SEC-reported Australian sales were US$ 209 million higher than what was 


reported by JKS’ ASIC filings which showed that JKS fabricated its Australian sales in its SEC filings in 2017 


and 2018.10

Australia.

JKS’ 2017 and 2018 20-F SEC filings included a non-exhaustive list of module customers.  Those customers with 


Australian-based construction projects in 2017 and 2018 included Green Light Contractors Pty Ltd (“Green Light”) 


and UGL Limited (“UGL”) and Decmil Australia Pty Ltd (“Decmil”).11 





Our review of JKS’ disclosed Australian customer operations in 2017 and 2018 corroborated the accuracy of JKS’ 


ASIC reported Australian sales figure. 





Decmil:  JKS disclosed that it had signed a contract with EPC contractor Decmil Group (ASX: DCG) to supply the 


255 MW Sunraysia Solar Farm power plant in Australia.  





 
Source: JKS 2018 20-F - p. 59 





On January 23, 2019, Decmil disclosed in a Linkedin post that its Accommodation Camp opened on January 3, 2019 


and in January 2019 its first pilings were driven into the ground suggesting that no solar modules were purchased in 


either 2017 nor 2018. 





 
Source: https://reneweconomy.com.au/construction-begins-on-255mw-sunraysia-solar-farm-in-nsw-19587/  





As a side note, Decmil’s stock was recently suspended after a number of negative developments.  In December 2019 


the Sunraysia solar project had yet to get the green light from the market operator, forcing Decmil to take an AU$ 14 


million hit because of a dispute with John Laing and Maoneng over the delay.12 Later in December 2019 Decmil’s 


CFO unexpectedly resigned and its stock dropped.  In February 2020, Decmil’s stock was suspended after it was no 


longer in contention for the Rapid Deployment Prison Projects in New Zealand. 





Not great news for Decmil and the Sunraysia project.

Solar Farm in Australia.

Green Light’s ASIC filings revealed total material costs of AU$ 113 million and AU$ 40 million in 2018 and 2017, 


respectively, while not having any inventory as of CYE’18.  Green Light does not disclose specifics about the identities 


of its suppliers, so it is unclear whether 100% of Green Light’s reported material costs were purchased from JKS.

UGL:  UGL is a contractor subsidiary of Cimic Group (ASX: CIM) (“Cimic”).  Historically Cimic generated US$ 


10+ billion a year in sales so limited details were given about UGL’s specific operations.  However, Cimic’s 2019 


annual report disclosed that “UGL’s experience in renewables and solar includes the construction and commissioning 


of 12 solar farms, and six other renewable projects with a current output of 380 megawatts across Australia”.

JKS disclosed that its solar module average price per watt declined from US$ 0.38 in 2017 to US$ 0.31 in 2018, in-


line with macro industry pricing pressures on commoditized solar module technology.13  





If we apply JKS’ 2018 average module sales price of US$ 0.31 to 100% of UGL’s 380 MW module installations at 


all 18 of its solar farm power plants, UGL’s maximum solar module purchases would be US$ 119 million in total 


historical purchases, not just in 2018. 





Putting these three customer does not explain the discrepancy between SEC-reported and ASIC-reported sales.  





 
Source: JKS 2018 20-F SEC filing, Green Light 2018 ASIC filing, UGL 2019 Annual Report, Sunraysia website 





To us, customer ASIC filings corroborate that JKS’ SEC-reported Australian sales appear artificially inflated.

UNDERSTATED LIABILITIES BY US $ 42 MILLION  





Evidence shows that JKS lied about the disposal of its South African subsidiary to an independent third party and that 


JKS remains liable for US$ 42 million of customs duties owed to South African authorities that should be reflected 


on JKS’ current consolidated financial statements. 





In December 2017, the South African Revenue Services (“SARS”) found JKS’ only South African subsidiary (“JKS 


South Africa”) to be liable for US$ 42 million in import taxes due to South Africa.  JKS’ reaction was to appeal, refute 


and defend against all claims. In 2017 JKS accounted for the contingent liability with RMB 70,000, immaterial to its 


financial statements.   





In December 2018, JKS disposed of JKS South Africa to a supposed “independent third party” and no longer 


consolidated JKS South Africa for its 2018 reported SEC filings.  





 
Source: JKS 2018 20-F - p. 23 





Who is this mystery independent third party that wanted to acquire JKS South Africa despite its customs duties liability 


overhang?  





Information filed with the South Africa Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (“CIPC”) contains business 


history details including enterprise and director details.  Details for JKS South Africa revealed an address change in 


2018 to 64 Kort Street, Parys, Free State.

To be clear, JKS told investors that it disposed JKS South Africa to an independent third party in December 2018.  


Our investigators visited the updated JKS South Africa physical address to see what the new owners did with JKS 


South Africa. The storefront of the alleged independent third party that Chairman Li stuffed with US$ 42 million in 


unpaid customs duties sells cheap clothes and backpacks.  





We verified that the storefront was the same registered physical address for a separate logistics company maintained 


by JKS South Africa’s long-time sole director Wei Lu.  Our assumption is that JKS South Africa’s US$ 42 million 


liability is being held by an undisclosed insider.
