Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


Note: 
 
About ten minutes after I posted this blog Valeant terminated its
relationship with Philidor.  
 
The liability questions at the end of this post now have greater
importance.  
 
I have left the post unchanged for that announcement. Enjoy. 
 
------------ 
 
Original post: 
 
 


Forgive a long post. The Valeant/Philidor/US Attorney situation is
complicated. The pattern of this post will be to state both what we
know and how we know it - and to explore theories around the edge of
that knowledge. Because the underlying situation is complicated the
post will unfortunately be detailed and at some points non-committal.


Almost anyone who has been following Wall Street will know that Valeant
Pharmaceuticals, a large-cap and previously acquisitive pharmaceutical
company, has been under pressure. They held a special conference call to answer
concerns raised by Citron Research (a prominent individual short-seller), The
Southern Investigative Research Foundation [SIRF] (see here and here), the Wall
Street Journal (notably this article) and this blog. 
 
These articles focuss on a specialty pharmacy (Philidor) which distribute almost
entirely Valeant products, have close interchange with Valeant staff, and is quite
large (targeting 1000 staff by the end of this year). This was never disclosed by
Valeant prior to the SIRF article. The main sources for these articles were two
court cases in California where a Philidor associate, another specialty company
called Isolani was suing R&O - a small specialty pharmacy company in
California. 
 
The complete prior lack of disclosure about Philidor (which is clearly important
to Valeant) allowed several wild theories to develop. Some of these theories
(including theories I had) were wrong. Others are almost certainly correct. Some
of these theories allege criminal activity by Philidor. Valeant has disclosed
criminal investigations by two US Attorneys. If any of the criminal theories are

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 2/37


correct it will be very bad for Philidor. Whether it is similarly bad for Valeant
was one of the topics of the conference call and hence of this blog post. 
 
The most prominent allegation in the various articles came from Citron
Research. That allegation - that the tied specialty pharmaceutical companies are
being used for channel stuffing is almost certainly false. Valeant spent a
disproportionate amount of time on this allegation - perhaps at the expense of
ignoring the problems identified by SIFR, the WSJ and me. Whatever: let's take
the conference call seriously. 
 
The more pertinent allegation is that Philidor is an artifice for defrauding
insurance companies. This was inadequately addressed in the conference call.
However it is the elephant in the room. 
 
Valeant's defence was three-fold: 


1. Specialty pharmacies like Philidor are legal and several drug companies
have them. 


2. Even if what Philidor did was illegal we are not responsible for them.
Valeant argued they don't own them, don't appoint the CEO and are not in
control. Besides Valeant are indemnified by them for any losses anyway.


3. Even if there is a problem here Philidor is a low-single digit percentage
share of our sales and hence it won't cause us much grief. 


I think all stages of this defence are questionable: Philidor may well cause
Valeant to collapse. Indeed I think that likely and my price target for Valeant is
zero. At the peak the debt market is factoring in a default probability for Valeant
of almost 50 percent in the next five years (link). They are I think
underestimating the problems. Obviously the equity market has a very different
idea. 
 
I am going to lay out the evidence in this post as we currently know it. Some of
this comes from the work of Bronte and some is poached from other sources,
including Roddy Boyd and SIRF, the WSJ, Propublica. 
 
In Part 1  I detail what is a specialty pharmacy and why both drug companies
and customers and doctors might like them and insurance companies hate them. I
also discuss the sort of infractions they might commit and the lines that separate
criminal activity from merely aggressive business practice. 
 
In Part 2 I go through the evidence that Philidor might be on the wrong side of
that line. 
 
In Part 3 I discuss the separation between Philidor and Valeant - a separation I
believe is questionable. Some of the evidence comes from our own research,
some from the call and some from some excellent work done by the WSJ. 
 
In Part 4 I detail the size of Valeant's non-traditional distribution models and
how we might scale them. This produces data contrary to the data in the
conference call. The scope of non traditional distribution at Valeant is much
larger than bulls believe.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 3/37


 
In Part 5 I detail how Philidor may be used to fake Valeant's accounts. I don't
think this is Philidor's main purpose but it clearly is an issue and Mike Pearson
(Valeant's CEO) did not answer a very precise question on this in the conference
call. 
 
After that there will be a brief summary. 
 
 


A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy (usually but not necessarily) tied to a
manufacturer which specialised in distributing classes of branded drugs. They
are usually mail-order operations and operate over State lines. To operate they
usually require a license in every State which they service. 
 
There are several features of these pharmacies which are are common to most
but not all of these. 


1. They specialise in branded drugs - and they offer the customer as smooth as
possible a way to get reimbursed on those drugs. They generally offer
excellent customer service. The customer normally discloses all their
insurance details and pays a copayment. The refund claim is administered
by the speciality pharmacy. In this case the specialty pharmacy or more
likely the drug company bear the risk that the product will not get
reimbursed. Customers do not need to deal with their insurance companies
- a great advantage for some particularly if you are sick. Sometimes the
copayment is waived or copay cards are administered. [If you unaware as
to what copay card is look at this example from Jublia.]


2. Because they are captured by the branded drug distributors they are very
loathe to suggest cheaper generics. A typical example is a Valeant product
called Onexton - an acne cream. Onexton is a mix of two well known
treatments for acne - clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide. Both
these products are available as generics at low cost. However the
combination has a price of $478 per tube. If you went to your local
pharmacy they would (if they were competent and unbiased) suggest you
buy the two generics. However if you go to the captive specialty pharmacy
you will be sold the expensive drug (and the cost will largely be borne by
your insurance company).


3. Specialty pharmacies are often very willing to waive copays and other
charges to sell the drug. To put it mildly Valeant would be more interested
receiving hundreds of dollars a tube for Onexton than actually collecting
the copay. This is not limited to Valeant.


As a general rule specialty pharmacies are liked by patients and doctors. This is
not surprising. If you want the active ingredients in Onexton you can buy the
generics ($10-$15 each) and mix them and you will be out-of-pocket. Or you can
go to Philidor, have them waive the copay and you will get them for nothing.
And there is little to sort out. The specialty pharmacy covers the insurance
claims.

legal and the illegal

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 4/37


 
Valeant made a big deal of the quality of the service at the speciality pharmacies
in their call. This is consistent with most (but not all) of the discussion on
consumer chat boards.
 
The problem of course is that insurance companies dislike specialty pharmacies.
Again to go back to Onexton it is unlikely you could sustainably sell a
combination of two generics at any price near $400 without insurance. A captive
specialty pharmacy makes it easier to stick the bill to the insurance company.
After all using two generics will have the same effect for very little money
indeed.
 
Specialty pharmacy legalities
 
Specialty pharmacies are legal. Several drug companies (including most in the
dermatology space) have close relationships with specialty pharmacy. They are
darn useful in the case of difficult chronic diseases with cocktails of expensive
drugs (such as HIV). A specialty pharmacy will know more about the cocktail of
prescribed drugs and will get them couriered to you as needed. 
 
Alas specialty pharmacies are also the easiest way to get someone to pay $400
for your branded skin cream containing only generic ingredients. That someone
is an insurance company and the product is a rip-off. 
 
Valeant spent considerable time in the conference call listing specialty
pharmacies tied to other large pharmaceutical firms. They are legal.
 
Examples of infractions at specialty pharmacy - the illegal
 
The most important thing a specialty pharmacy must not do is waive copays for
Medicare, Medicaid or other government pharmaceutical insurance schemes.
The government regards this as fraud against the government. One way of
ensuring that everyone goes to prison is to systematically defraud Uncle Sam. 
 
I have no evidence that that is happening at Philidor/Valeant. Every Valeant
copay assistance advert for instance specifically says that copay assistance is not
available on Medicare or similar programs. This example for Onextin is
instructive. It offers a zero copayment (and a coupon for your local pharmacy)
but the coupon is not valid for Government programs. 
 
The government tends to be more forgiving of one-off instances of waiving
copayments for Medicare. [Big fines but not prison.] Systematically defrauding
the US Government is however unwise. One-off instances can happen
accidentally: sometimes patients will misrepresent their own insurance position
and sometimes processes to ensure no copayment waiver happens are slightly
sloppy. 
 
That said - even waiving copayments for private insurance have sometimes been
held to be breach of contract. There is a reasonable legal summary here. To

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 5/37





Private insurers and the courts are not generally alarmed by
occasional accommodations for individual patients with documented
financial limitations. However, insurance carriers have successfully
challenged the routine waiver of copayment obligations in the courts
on numerous occasions. 


Courts dealing with challenges to discounts of copayment obligations
have been concerned with two basic issues. First, a provider who
discounts established fees for some patients but not others, without a
valid distinction for the differing treatment, can be subject to claims
of false billing by a party not receiving the discount or consideration,
including claims by insurance carriers. Second, the routine waiver of
patient copayment amounts can be viewed as breach of contract.
Almost without exception, insurers impose a contractual duty on
providers to make a reasonable effort to collect applicable copayment
amounts from patients, and benefits are only available when the
charge for the service submitted by the provider is the actual, and the
usual, reasonable and customary charge (URC). The reasoning in
these cases is that the uniform discounting or waiver of patients’
copayment portion of a provider’s fee evidences that the provider
really only intends to collect that portion of the fee which is not
discounted, making it improper to claim that the fee is the full
undiscounted fee.


 
There are other things that specialty pharmacies do that are illegal (even
criminal). Perhaps the most notable is misrepresent diseases to insurance
companies. To pick an example from another stock, Insys sells Subsys - a
branded version of Fentanyl - a very strong narcotic. Fentanyl is approved for
pain relief for some terminal cancer patients. Here is a court case where a
registered nurse prescribed Fentanyl off-label (and her plea regarding narcotics
distribution) but it is possible the attached speciality pharmacy (and not the
doctor/nurse) falsely submitted claims to stating the patient had cancer when
they did not. [Indeed this is what the prosecutor says in the plea arrangement.]
Misrepresenting the script to the insurance companies is fraud and is criminal. 
 
In general misrepresenting the claim to a insurance company is fraud. However
if you defraud an insurance company you may wind up in criminal court - or you
could be lucky and only wind up in a civil court. 
 
Other things that a speciality pharmacy can do that are illegal is altering
prescriptions so that cheaper generics can't be prescribed. If a doctor writes
"dispense as written" on a script in most States it is illegal to dispense a
medically identical generic. However if they do not write this the insurance
company may insist on the generic. Given sales incentives (presumably with
staff remunerated for getting payment from insurance companies) the incentive
to write dispense as written onto scripts or to otherwise falsify doctor
instructions is high. Warner Chilcott (a division of Allergan) was criminally
convicted for (amongst other things) manipulating prior authorizations to induce

insurance companies to pay for prescriptions of Atelvia. The fine however was
not large ($125 million). 
 
Fines for infractions at specialty pharmacies are not uncommon. Generally you
reward specialty pharmacies for getting the product out the door and reimbursed
by insurance companies. To the extent that you use cash incentives for the
speciality pharmacy for getting reimbursement the staff of the specialty
pharmacy have an incentive to cheat. 
 
Whilst fines are common they are not usually ruinous. After all these are
rarely systematic attempts at cheating insurance companies. A systematic
attempt at cheating insurance companies will probably result in an enormous
fine, criminal charges and executives in handcuffs. There were huge infractions
at Arthrocare and the CEO went to prison - however they got the conviction on
easier to prove channel stuffing allegations. 
 
One recent case that is probably close to settling is against Novartis. The
Government sought $3.3 billion in fines (and criminal sanctions) in a kick-back
case involving Medicare and specialty pharmacies. To quote the Wall Street
Journal: 


The U.S. is seeking as much as $3.3 billion from Novartis AG in a
suit claiming the company paid kickbacks to increase sales of two
prescription drugs. 


The government claims a group of specialty pharmacies
submitted thousands of fraud-tainted reimbursement claims to
Medicare and Medicaid for the two drugs, Exjade and Myfortic. It’s
seeking damages and civil fines against the drugmaker in a case set to
be tried in New York in November. The U.S. disclosed the amount of
its demand in a court filing Monday. 


The U.S. claims Novartis referred patients to the specialty
pharmacies and paid kickbacks in the form of rebates to get the
pharmacies to recommend the drugs to patients and to increase
sales. The scheme violated the False Claims Act and Anti-Kickback
Statute, according to the government.


In this case it was a fully external speciality pharmacy owned by Express Scripts
which did Novartis' dirty work. Express Scripts settled (for $60 million) and the
fact that the false claims were submitted by a third party did not save Novartis.
Novartis is almost certainly cooperating in this investigation and they recently
raised reserves on the eventual fine (but to a number considerably lower than
$3.3 billion). 
 
Insurance rejection as a more likely end-game for specialty pharmacies 
 
Specialty pharmacy (especially in dermatology) is often a device for getting
overpriced drugs reimbursed by insurance companies. It may be legal or it may
not be, depending on the practices of the pharmacy. 
 
But insurance companies fight back - especially if the pharmacy is particularly

egregious. They either (a) stop paying or (b) pay an amount considerably lower
than the list price of the drug. 
 
There is good reason. After all in some cases (such as Onexton) the cheaper
combination is medically equivalent. And besides from the insurers point of
view this is barely a customer service issue. Usually the insured has received
their (overpriced) drugs from the specialty pharmacy already. There is some
evidence (below) that insurers were rejecting claims from Philidor prior to the
exposure by Roddy Boyd. After the Philidor scandal this will become more
common and at the time of writing the wholesale rejection of claims processed
by Philidor had begun. 
 
 


 
There is quite a lot of evidence that insurance companies are rejecting claims
made by Philidor. Whether they are doing that legally or not or whether illegal
actions by Philidor are prompting this rejection is not at first the issue. The issue
simply is that they are rejecting payment. 
 
Anyway the various California lawsuits mentioned the use of the network of
specialty pharmacies (including R&O) was to deal with insurance companies
rejecting claims. The idea is that if the insurance company is wary of paying
Philidor claims (say insisting on an audit of each claim) Philidor staff just use
another pharmacists identification number. The insurance company may be much
less likely to audit a claim made on say a retail pharmacy in California. 
 
This solution to insurance companies that were slow to pay claims was also
discussed in a a recent (and fabulous) WSJ article. This relates to the period prior
to the exposure of Philidor by Roddy Boyd and SIRF. 
 
But we also have evidence to existing rejection problems given to us in the 3Q
conference call. Here is a table of gross pricing action and net realised price for
the dermatology business. [Remember the dermatology business is the business
most dependent on specialty pharmacies.]

crimes and are insurance companies withholding payment

Note there was a weighted price increase of 14 percent an an effective price
increase of 1.7 percent. The most extreme example is Atralin where the price
increase was 61 percent but they did not effectively get any increase. 
 
How is possible on average to get no increase in price having raised prices 61
percent? The answer I think is that insurance companies won't pay. 
 
And why is Atralin so extreme? Well it is a branded $604.81 small
tube of Vitamin A cream. And that is it. 
 
Nobody in their right mind would buy it. It gets sold only because insurers pay -
and having Philidor, a tied specialty pharmacy company - rather helps in getting
this done. 
 
But Atralin is just an extreme version of the need for specialty pharmacy. 


Jublia is a marginally effective treatment for toenail fungus. Paint it on
daily for 48 weeks and and your chance of having toenail fungus cured
rises from 5 percent to 18 percent with some chance of an adverse
reaction and a cost to insurance companies of more than $8000. 


Solodyn is a slow release minocycline for treating acne. There are
generics available. 


Ziana is another combination of two generics.


 
I could go on. This is not the collection of drugs a company gets from fantastic
R&D. Indeed R&D has never been a major attraction of owning Valeant. Its a
collection of drugs you get from fantastic - or maybe sneaky - marketing. 
 
And it is the list of products that absolutely require insurers to pay because well
informed consumers generally would not. 
 
After the exposure of Philidor by SIRF, the WSJ, Propublica and this blog it was
only a matter of time before insurers started rejecting claims more generally. As
of writing both CVS and Express Scripts (amongst the biggest pharmaceutical
benefits managers) have cut off Philidor. 
 
Evidence for systematic problems at Philidor 
 
 
Waiving of copays 
 
I have no evidence that Philidor systematically waives copays for Medicare or
other government funded insurance. 
 
There is strong evidence Valeant waives copays systematically over the whole
private-pay business. In the 3Q conference call Mike Pearson (Valeant's CEO)
said this: 


Looking at history, our commitment to patient assistant programs has
grown at an annual compound rate of 128% from $53 million in 2012
to approximately $1 billion we expect to spend in 2016.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 9/37


This is appoximately 8% of all revenue. Copay waiving must be near
ubiquitous.  
 
Since writing my first cryptic post I have received numerous stories of auto-ship
refills with copayments waived.  
 
As explained above almost without exception, insurers impose a contractual duty
on providers to make a reasonable effort to collect applicable copayment
amounts from patients, and benefits are only available when the charge for the
service submitted by the provider is the actual, and the usual, reasonable and
customary charge. 
 
Philidor clearly does not do that. 
 
The lack of a California license
 
There is one place where we can unequivocally say that Philidor skates very
close to the letter of the law. Philidor was denied a license to be a pharmacist in
California. I rang Philidor, they answered Philidor and they stated explicitly on
the phone that they service the whole USA.
 
Any artifice that Philidor has to deliver in California is likely to be skating close
to the law. Valeant in their conference call say they use a network of local
pharmacies (there are an undisclosed number in the network) to deliver in states
where they are not licensed. To quote:


In addition, they are exploring partnerships with independent
pharmacies on a contractual basis. Under these arrangements Philidor
would provide the back-end services while the partners would run the
front of the store. In the future we would anticipate that Philidor's
growth plans will rely much more on expanding its network via
partnerships. This strategy should allow Philidor to grow faster with
fewer regulatory hurdles. This model is also much less capital
intensive than acquiring pharmacies... 


We understand that Philidor holds nonresident licenses in 45 states,
the District of Columbia and its resident license in Pennsylvania. In
the few states where it is not directly licensed, such as California,
Philidor does not dispense products to patients. Philidor has
agreements with affiliated pharmacies that have California licenses
and those pharmacies have dispensed products to patients in
California.


We also learned that at least some of (and possibly all) of this "network of
pharmacies" is owned through a variable interest entity [VIE] and that (until
now) Philidor has not disclosed their ownership of them.
 
If ownership for a pharmacy changes generally this needs to be disclosed. But by
using VIEs not only has Valeant disguised its ownership of its network of
pharmacies. [Question for Valeant - you should also consolidate them - can you
disclose the list.]
 
The Valeant quote above indicates that these were used to get around California
licensing.
 
I suspect the California authorities will be interested in that. Propublica is
already reporting concerns of Texas authorities in setting up a subsidiary
pharmacy called Orbit.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 10/37


Gay Dodson, executive director of the Texas State Board of
Pharmacy, said her agency would need to look into whether there was
a connection between Philidor and Orbit Pharmacy, whose top
official, James Fleming, is Philidor’s controller. Texas law allows
people to set up corporations “as you wish,” she said, and if Philidor
and Back Rank are fully separate entities, “I think we would have
problems tying the two together and being able to take action with a
different corporation, an entirely different corporation. We would
have to really look at it.”


There is some pretty clear black-letter law in some States regarding this.
Whether it is enough to sink Philidor is open to much doubt. However it will
give insurance companies some grounds to sue for reimbursement or deny
payment. 
 
I think the explanation that the "network" pharmacies exist to get around
licensing restrictions (an explanation given by Valeant in the conference call) is
bunk. I think the real explanation is much nastier.
 
The likely real explanation for network pharmacies
 
The latest WSJ article really is a stunner. Jonathan Rockoff (the journalist) has
one of those wonderful definitive documents: he claims to have a Philidor
training manual. I have not seen this manual and cannot judge first-hand what it
contains. However - the evidence provided by the WSJ - and on the say-so of the
WSJ - would be very useful in determining whether there was systematic fraud
at Philidor. 
 
If this manual tells staff how to deceive insurance companies then its a slam-
dunk for systematic fraud. 
 
Moreover this is all done across state lines using mail and wires. That would be a
text book wire and mail fraud against a financial institution the penalty for which
is up to $1 million per instance with no limit to the number of instances. 
 
So here is what Rockoff says (and they are his sources and I have not seen the
said manual). 


If a health insurer wouldn’t work with Philidor Rx Services LLC, the
pharmacy instructed staff to try again using the identification number
of a partner pharmacy to secure payment. “We have a couple of
different ‘back door’ approaches to receive payment from the
insurance company,” a Philidor training manual said.


This is a scorcher of an allegation. Philidor has acquired a network of
pharmacies (mostly former mum-and-pop operations). The allegation here is that
if the insurance company rejects the claim originally you should just "borrow"
the identification number of a "partner pharmacy" and resubmit the claim. The
money quote is "we have a couple of different ‘back door’ approaches to receive
payment from the insurance company". Does "back door" mean deception? If so
there is a very big problem for Philidor. 
 
Moreover the article from Jonathan Rockoff confirms work done by Bronte
and The Skeptic. The Skeptic's take is better than mine. We know the UPS

delivery details of 21,000 prescriptions administered by Philidor but marked
using R&O's pharmacy identification number. These were not just shipped to
California (as asserted by Mike Pearson in the conference call) but were shipped
all over the USA and to states where neither Philidor nor R&O were licensed.
The Skeptic has an analysis of all 21,000 prescriptions stripping data from UPS's
website. 
 
Using R&O's number to ship to states where Philidor was licensed but R&O was
not looks like Philidor was shopping for a Pharmacist's number that did not
prompt rejection from the insurance companies This is the allegation in the WSJ. 
 
Deceiving an insurance company as to who filled the prescription also looks like
it matches the definition of mail fraud. It is an artifice to obtain money from a
financial institution using mail over State lines. Philidor pretended the script
came from R&O whereas it really came from Philidor. 
 
The fine in this instance - and this is just one specialty pharmacy "partner"
amongst an undisclosed many would be greater than $10 billion. [It is against a
financial institution and the penalty for mail fraud is a million dollars per
instance and there are no limits to the number of instances. And there are more
than 10,000 instances outside California where the administration was done by
Philidor and the product was supposedly distributed by R&O.] 
 
Whatever: if the prosecutors wish to take this seriously (and I suspect they will)
this is enough to kill Philidor. Whether it is enough to bankrupt Valeant will
depend on whether Valeant can successfully defend the notion from the
conference call that it is not liable for Philidor misdeeds. I don't think they can -
but that is discussed below. 
 
Other possible misdeeds by Philidor 
 
The Wall Street Journal hints at other misdeeds by Philidor. 


A separate department at Philidor would seek insurance coverage. If
the insurer asked a doctor to explain why the patient needed a costlier
Valeant drug rather than a less-expensive alternative, Philidor
employees would sometimes fill out the paperwork for the doctor,
two of the employees said.


The WSJ leaves it as ambiguous as to whether this has been done with or
without approval from the doctor. With approval from the doctor is legal.
Without about approval from the doctor it is criminal and that behaviour has
been prosecuted in the past. 
 
Dispense as written fraud 
 
Caroline Chen at Bloomberg News is stating she has acquired written
instructions from Philidor to their staff to falsify "dispense as written" and other
doctor instructions on the prescription. This is an allegation of criminal behavior: 


A specialty pharmacy that fills prescriptions for Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International Inc. has altered doctors’ orders to

wring more reimbursements out of insurers, according to former
employees and an internal document. 


Workers at the mail-order pharmacy, Philidor RX Services LLC, were
given written instructions to change codes on prescriptions in some
cases so it would appear that physicians required or patients desired
Valeant’s brand-name drugs -- not less expensive generic versions --
be dispensed, the former employees said. Typically, pharmacists will
sell a generic version if not precisely told to do otherwise by a
“dispense as written” indication on a script. The more "dispense as
written" orders, the more sales for the brand-name drugmaker. 


An undated Philidor document obtained by Bloomberg provides a
step-by-step guide on how to proceed when a prescription for Valeant
dermatological creams and gels including Retin-A Micro and Vanos
is rejected. Similar instructions for changing the DAW indication are
supplied for patients who are paying in cash.


I have not seen the training manual but if this training manual exists it is
evidence of systematic fraud against insurance companies. 
 
 


 
Valeant went to an unusual extent to hide their relationship with Philidor. 
 
Philidor was first exposed publicly by the Southern Investigative Reporting
Foundation. At this point Philidor was growing enormously fast (rising to about
1000 staff by this year end). Philidor however had a website registered to
domains by proxy and no information as to ownership on Valeant's website or in
any SEC filing. Moreover the California government went as far as alleging that
Philidor had given false statements under penalty of perjury - seemingly to hide
their ownership. 
 
The headline from the call was that terms of the options involved and whether
they do or don't "own" Philidor. 
 
If you want a quirky take on it Matt Levine is clever as usual. 
 
But in the presentation we discovered deniability had been built into the Philidor
arrangements from inception.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 13/37


 
 
Valeant says that they paid $100 million up front for an option to acquire
Philidor at no consideration any time in the next ten years. They also are liable
for milestone payments of up to $133 million. 
 
This is a strange asset. Valeant can acquire Philidor for no consideration - but
they seem not to own it. This is a sort of limbo: ownership but not ownership.
This left Valeant with a very difficult line to thread which was to argue that they
gave $100 million to something they did not control but they were not
financially reckless. [We don't control them but look at all these controls we have
over them.] 
 
Remarkably many accepted this rhetorical stunt. 
 
The line of the conference call came from Valeant CEO Mike Pearson: 


In terms of the zero dollar option value, I think it is legal and maybe
it's unusual.


Mike Pearson thinks it is legal and knows it is unusual. 
 
There were some prior indication of Philidor's existence. This is- from
the 2015Q2 conference call is probably the strongest: 


 
David Steinberg - Jefferies LLC - Analyst 


Just wanted to follow-up on the Jublia question. You mentioned the
change in the gross to nets, but did the -- especially, did the number of
scrips going through the specialty pharmacy improve? I think it was
about 50% last time. Secondly, given the strength in some of your
other derm products, Onexton and Luzu, what percent of those scrips
are through your specialty pharmacy channels?  


Ari Kellen - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc -
Company Group Chairman 


Yes, the adoption through multiple specialty pharmacies continues. I
think last time we said Jublia was around 50%. That trend continues.
For derm overall, it varies by product, but it's around 40%.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 14/37


And here we discovered that that for dermatology products specialty pharmacies
were very important and the analyst thought that it was likely to be particularly
important for Onexton and Luzu. We saw above why it would be particularly
important with Onexton. Luzu like Onexton also has generic alternatives and
would require insurance to get people to pay the high sticker price. 
 
Even when asked directly Valeant did not reveal it "owned" its main specialty
pharmacy. 
 
Did Valeant need to disclose the ownership of Philidor and why did they
hide it so thoroughly? 
 
The short answer is Valeant probably didn't need to disclose Philidor but that
hiding it was unusual. Here is the critical slide. 
 
 


 
 
The observation was that Philidor - a $100 million option with cumulative net-
sales was not material and therefore did not need to be disclosed. 
 
I am not going to argue with their legal advice with respect to this. Mike Pearson
"thinks" it is legal (as quoted above). However I will observe that Valeant does
not always hide their acquisitions. During the same quarter (the fourth quarter of
2014) Valeant disclosed acquisitions down to $20 million in value. [Size of
deal here, and one of many disclosures as to the acquisition here. This was one
of many similarly small disclosed acquisitions.] 
 
Moreover the list of subsidiaries Valeant has goes to subsidiaries much smaller
than Philidor. For instance the attached list from the 10-K has tiny little
subsidiaries - multiple subsidiaries - each with one corporate jet. But it does not
mention Philidor. Philidor also met the definition of a subsidiary within Valeant's
bank covenants - but I am not sure whether this obliged them to disclose them in
SEC filings or only to the banks. 
 
Hiding Philidor made me think prima-facie the company is doing something
wrong at Philidor.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 15/37


The company has an alternative explanation: they hid it because it was a
competitive advantage. 
 
Notwithstanding this Valeant has gone to lengths to legally distance itself from
Philidor suggesting that they were aware there was a possibility that they were
doing something wrong. 
 
In the conference call they said they were 
 
 


indemnified by Philidor and 


able to walk away entirely. 


Both those assertions are questionable. But these suggestions make it clear they
were aware of the possibility of legal problems. 
 
Agency fraud 
 
Whilst Valeant has made a great deal of effort to legally separate itself from
Philidor there are plenty of circumstances where such a separation will not stick. 
 
Above I mentioned a case where Novartis is facing criminal charges (and a $3.3
billion fine) because of actions by its specialty pharmacy. In this case the
specialty pharmacy is owned by Express Scripts. It is clearly legally separate. 
 
The reason that Novartis is (potentially) liable for the actions of Express Scripts
is that the incentives that Novartis gave Express Script induced the fraud and
they were either reckless or knowing as to this inducement. 
 
The issue is simple: was Valeant or senior members of staff complicit in crimes
at Philidor? If so then nothing much will save Valeant. 
 
Again the WSJ offers some fantastic colour. They indicate that senior staff at
Philidor were in fact staff of Valeant acting under (mostly silly) false names. To
quote: 
 
 


Around the Phoenix-area offices of mail-order pharmacy Philidor Rx
Services LLC, employees said they often ran into a friendly colleague
named Bijal Patel who tracked prescriptions. But when the employees
got an email from the colleague, they say he used a different name:
Peter Parker, the alter ego of Spider-Man. 


He was among a few workers at Philidor offices who went by one
name in person and another in emails during the past two years,
according to three former employees. Mr. Patel and the other people
weren’t employed by Philidor, though the emails used a Philidor
address, these people said. They were employees of drug company
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. 



http://www.wsj.com/articles/valeants-ties-to-pharmacy-scrutinized-1445817449
5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 16/37


As late as Sunday afternoon, the LinkedIn page for a man named
Bijal Patel identified him as manager of access solutions at Valeant in
Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Patel didn’t respond to requests for comment.


The Valeant employees were placed at Philidor while the pharmacy
was in its infancy, to provide help on “structures and processes,” said
a Philidor spokeswoman. She said in a statement that the Valeant
employees set up separate Philidor email accounts, under “clearly
distinguishable names,” to keep “their internal Philidor
communications separate from the Valeant communications,
primarily to reduce the risk of incorrectly sharing either company’s
proprietary information.”


 
Bluntly senior employees of Philidor were in fact Valeant employees but were
obscuring that tie by using the names of Peter Parker and other super-heroes. The
Valeant employees (plural) set up "structures and processes". 
 
This is going to be impossible to keep separate. 
 
Further we know that Valeant rewarded its own staff for helping Philidor. Here is
a corporate award to a Valeant sales staff member who "helped set up Philidor in
six States". 
 
 


This is consistent with the WSJ article that Valeant employees were involved in
setting up Philidor. 
 
Valeant made a big show in the conference call how they have an indemnity
from Philidor. There is of course a likelihood that Philidor can't pay. After all it
is only a mail order pharmacy (and it is hard to identify huge quantities of assets
that can be turned into hard cash in a crisis). However as Philidor is consolidated
into Valeant recovering from Philidor would have a limited effect on the GAAP
accounts. [Contra: I guess Valeant could abandon Philidor, take the charge and
then sue Philidor. However Philidor would have little business without Valeant
so this is moot.] 
 
 


 
The specialty pharmacy channel is very important in dermatology in America.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 17/37


Above I quoted the second quarter conference call where they put the specialty
pharmacy channel (including but not limited to Philidor) at 40 percent of sales
and 50 percent of Jublia sales. 
 
In the conference call however they downplayed this. They did not give the
numbers versus dermatology - but rather against the whole business. Here is a
typical slide: 
 
 


 
 
To regular Valeant watchers this slide came as a shock. It downplayed the
importance of Valeant's alternative distribution channels. 
 
Only a year ago Valeant was telling us how big and important their alternative
distribution was. If you remember Valeant was having the huge spat with
Allergan. Allergan were saying Valeant's sales were falling and Valeant was
saying that they were growing. 
 
Allergan was using IMS data which is a standard data source in pharmaceuticals.
Valeant stated outright that their sales were not falling and that the IMS data did
not cover the bulk of their sales due to reliance on channels such as specialty
pharmacy. 
 
This critical text is here (and the source is here). 
 
 


 
Now these slides were made when Philidor was much smaller than its current
size and even then more than 100 percent of the growth of many of the business

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 18/37


lines of Valeant came from specialty pharmacy and other non-traditional
distribution channels. Net of non-traditional channels Valeant's sales were falling
(Allergan was not misrepresenting the IMS data). Inclusive of non-traditional
channels Valeant claimed their sales were rising. 
 
Moreover we now know that Valeant has relationships with other specialty
pharmacies. It also has a network of pharmacies that it may or may not be
including in the Philidor numbers. [Honestly I don't know - the disclosure here is
very poor.] 
 
The changing scope of Philidor 
 
One observation that had me wondering was the changing scope of Philidor
between the 3Q conference call and the special conference call. 
 
In the 3Q conference call this is what Mike Pearson (Valeant's CEO) said: 


Philidor, one of our specialty pharmacy partners, provides
prescription services to patients across the country, and provides
administrative services for our copay cards and is a dispensary that
fills prescriptions. We have a contractual relationship with Philidor,
and late last year we purchased an option to acquire Philidor if we so
choose.


Specifically Philidor is one of several specialty pharmacy partners [which fits
with observations above], dispensed scripts across the country [for which we
know it is not licensed] and "provides administrative services for our copay
cards". 
 
The administrative services for copay cards function had entirely disappeared by
the special conference call. This is the key slide: 
 
 


 
 
At no point does it say that Philidor administers Valeant's copay cards. Maybe
the first conference call misspoke - but administration of the copay card is a core
function.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 19/37


 
Moreover the copay card program is critical to Valeant's relationship with other
specialty pharmacies. If Philidor acts abusively then the entire non-traditional
channel for Valeant is probably tainted. 
 
I would really like to understand whether Philidor really does administer
Valeant's copay system generally (and how that is run) or whether Mike Pearson
misspoke in the 3Q conference call. 
 
 


 
 
Since Philidor is consolidated into Valeant it cannot be used to fake Valeant's
accounts by channel stuffing. Citron's core allegation is incorrect. 
 
However there are other things that can be done. 
 
As stated above Valeant is liable for up to $133 million of "milestone" payments
(presumably if Philidor meets sales targets". These milestone payments would of
course be capitalised into the cost of buying Philidor - but you could
alternatively describe them as "sales support expense" in which case they should
be deducted in the P&L statement. 
 
There was an explicit question about this in the conference call and Mike
Pearson did not provide a real answer. Here is the exchange: 
 
 


David Common - JPMorgan - Analyst


Yes. Thank you very much for taking a fixed income question.  


I wondered if you could tell us who got the $100 million and the
potential $133 million in milestone payments. Is that basically money
that is used by Philidor to stand the Company up? I wonder if the
consideration really needs to be zero dollars for the purchase option. I
normally think of some consideration to make that transaction legal... 


J. Michael Pearson - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.
- Chairman and CEO 


In terms of who received the money for the $100 million up front plus
the first milestone payment, my understanding is that there are a
number of equity owners. I think it's between 10 and 20, maybe more.
And they would be whoever owns the equity of Philidor would've
received the money. 


And whether those individuals decided to contribute money into the
operation I have no clue. I just know that we have not contributed any
money into the operation. In terms of the zero dollar option value, I
think it is legal and maybe it's unusual.


Part V: How Philidor could be used to fake Valeant's accounts



https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7ZY0HR4nt_SWDR4WVFoLXlHTDQ/view?usp=sharing
5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Comments on the blockbuster Valeant conference call


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 20/37


The answer to the question was "I don't have a clue". 
 
We know however that Philidor was linked to Valeant from inception. The WSJ
reported: 


The Valeant employees were placed at Philidor while the pharmacy
was in its infancy, to provide help on “structures and processes,” said
a Philidor spokeswoman. She said in a statement that the Valeant
employees set up separate Philidor email accounts, under “clearly
distinguishable names,” to keep “their internal Philidor
communications separate from the Valeant communications,
primarily to reduce the risk of incorrectly sharing either company’s
proprietary information.”





Now we know (from above) that Valeant provided support for establishing
Philidor and that several Valeant staff work at Philidor (using names borrowed
from comic books). 
 
But Valeant paid $100 million for what was essentially a startup they founded.
And they pay progress payments too. 
 
If that is a capital expenditure it is a bizarre one. Valeant provided critical
support for setting it up and after doing that they buy it. 
 
The alternative in part is the $100 million was used to run Philidor and the $133
million of milestone payments also cover Philidor expense. 
 
But in that case they should be expensed. 
 
I guess this is something for the Ad Hoc Committee of the board to work out. 
 
Effect of the consolidation of Philidor 
 
Philidor can't be used for channel stuffing now but it could be used for channel
stuffing before acquisition. 
 
If it had been used for channel stuffing before acquisition then pre-acquisition
Philidor would have owed a great deal of money (for inventory) to Valeant. 
 
When it was acquired that internal loan would be cancelled and the consideration
would have been added to goodwill. 
 
That is a wonderful fraud and is in fact how Lernout & Hauspie (a very famous
fraud) faked its accounts. Essentially fake earnings from stuffing Philidor would
be turned into fake receivables - and then the receivables will be cancelled and
turned into (unauditable) goodwill. I hope the accountants have covered base for
this possibility. 
 
The tell in the accounts would be a strange drop in receivables at the end of the
4Q of 2014. Alas Philidor was small relative to Valeant (then) and so it is not
certain that this change would happen.

Posted by John Hempton at 7:05 PM  


 
The evidence is against Valeant having committed this fraud. The trade
receivables rose between 3Q and 4Q 2014. 
 
In general I agree with the proposition in the conference call that Philidor has not
been used to fake Valeant's accounts - although Michael Pearson's answer to a
pretty direct question was disconcerting. He doesn't have a clue... 
 
 


Citron's report into Valeant was easy to dismiss. Citron argued that Valeant used
the undisclosed relationship with Philidor to goose the accounts through channel
stuffing. 
 
Valeant did a good job dismissing that though in the conclusion we learn there
are some minor accounting issues with Philidor. 
 
The more pertinent question though is whether 
 
(a). Philidor is a device to systematically defraud insurance companies 
(b). Whether the legal separation from Philidor is sufficient to immunise Valeant
from liabilities and 
(c). Whether this is big enough in Valeant to cause very adverse impacts on
Valeant equity and debt holders. 
 
The evidence is very strong for (a) and most the evidence has been provided by
the Wall Street Journal. Insurance companies are taking no chances: several big
companies are now no longer reimbursing claims submitted by Philidor. 
 
It is very unlikely that the separation between Philidor and Valeant (as per
question (b)) is sufficient to protect Valeant from liability. They appear to be
joined at the hip with Valeant providing senior staff (who work under false
names) and Valeant providing much advice when establishing Philidor. 
 
Whether the Philidor problems are sufficient to cause major pain to shareholders
(even bankruptcy) is unclear. Philidor itself is a high single-digit percentage of
Valeant's sales (but it critical to the dermatology franchise). However Phildor
also may administer the copay cards and they are critical to quite a lot of
Valeant's business. Non traditional distribution is the difference between a
shrinking Valeant (as per the IMS data) and Valeants assertion that it is growing. 
 
I am intrigued as to how this plays out.

And (as you considered a possibility) Valeant has cut ties with Philidor. Pearson says they
'lost confidence in P's ability to continue to operate in a manner acceptable to Valeant.' 
 
Guaranteed to be interesting, anyway.

Doesn't this sort of stuff gets settled all the time between companies? These insurance
companies are not the government in a witch hunt or trying to make an example out of a
company, they are most likely be happy with a fat settlement than try to take down an
entire company

The thing is, the insurance companies would have to win two suits, the fraud suit and the
'Valent is liable' suit. I'm not a experienced lawyer but it seems to me this unusual
situation would increase the incentive to settle instead of hoping for a double win for a
bigger payday

Do we know who are the ultimate beneficial owners of Philidor's shares?


October 30, 2015 at 10:18 PM


tbone said...


I expect that Valeant, as a publicly traded company with responsibility to its shareholders,
will attempt to obtain the $100mm and $33mm from Philidor's owners rather than write it
off as a 'failed investment'. 
 
Given that the entire exercise has been right out of the playbook of Medicis' "access"
business, I hope that some manner of investigation will continue.

There is also another issue here. Any fine that could potentially flow through VRX will only
come out after, likely, years of litigation (specially that its 2 suits that need to be won). The
balance sheet (and liquidity) that matters is VRX in a few years, not the one that exists
right now


October 30, 2015 at 11:22 PM

I don’t see any evidence here that Valeant (as opposed to Philidor) has done anything
illegal. If Valeant had been paying kickbacks to doctors for sending patients to Philidor
then that would be a big problem. But no sign of anything like that. Valeant presumably
pays Philidor commission on sales, but that’s just normal business practice. If Philidor has
been illegally generating extra sales to earn more commission it’s not Valeant’s fault in
any legal sense.  
The Valeant employees at Philidor can be explained as being part of the joint steering
committee. 
 
Your Part IV requires us to believe that the Valeant CEO was simply lying when he said
that speciality pharmacies only account for 7.2% of revenue YTD. (And the other
management and board members who went along with the lie are all hopelessly corrupt.)
Because otherwise what you wrote there has no teeth. 
 
Your disputing of Valeant's claim that it is not liable for Philidor requires us to believe that
their lawyers are incompetent… 
 
Probably Philidor will quickly collapse now. Then Valeant can buy up their assets, rehire
their staff (except the corrupt management), rename the company and continue the
specialty pharmacy operation as before, minus the overly aggressive/illegal parts. The
revenue from it will no doubt be reduced, but the impact of that on the overall business is
very limited.

@Global: sure, possibly. But how many fat settlements can a company with loads of debt
afford? Do the changes that may be required hit its margins and cash flow, further
reducing its ability to afford settlements? When do they overwhelm the business? 
 
What numbers of new cash settlements required plus reduction in margins or cash flow
kill the company? If the revenues start dropping, is it still viable? 
 
I notice in the news articles that although Valeant says they're severing ties with the
company, it seems Philidor will just be shut down. Meaning no meaningful business there
apart from Valeant. Presumably all of their other specialty pharma channels will be under
severe scrutiny as well.

Hi John, 
 
I have question/comment re your Part V. 
 
Channel stuffing generally isn't fraudulent (I think); it's just postponing a profit warning.
There is a definitional difference between Valeant selling product to Philidor, or indeed
another 'channel', vs. selling out of the channel to the eventual consumer with respect to
channel stuffing. However, from an investment point of view, I don't see a strong
difference between the channel being stuffed and the consumer/patient being stuffed. 
 
I can't remember whether it was you or Citron or SIRF that had that quote from someone
saying that thanks to unrequested refills they now had enough cream to treat 200 years'
worth of athlete's foot, but here's the critical point: that guy never needs any more foot
ointment so Valeant's sales are going down. Maybe the channel stuffing allegation IS
narrowly incorrect, but the short is very much on because the consumer is stuffed.  
 
Congrats on the trade, by the way. 
 
T.

The Shadow Banker says: 
 
I think the bigger point John is trying to make, is that the lines of business that made
Valeant so profitable, will be drastically cut back. Given these lines seemingly huge
margins, it may have a much greater effect on the bottom line than their % of total
revenues indicates. In tandem w/ the earlier scrutiny on the price increases across all
their products and the huge debt load requiring interest payments, the profitability of the
company could be greatly diminished. Possibly to the extent that the viability of the
company comes into question, and at the very least the growth story is kaput. 
 
In addition, because Valeant isn't a "pharmaceutical SIFI" and has attracted so much
attention and involves a huge cast of characters, the regulators may use it as there
poster-boy/head-on-a-stick. Especially since John has succinctly laid out the road-map for
them.

Sorry John but the ackman slide showing the settlements has destroyed your short

Regarding the Valeant employees working at Philidor, it sounds like they were sent there
in consulting roles. (Probably not actual members of the steering committee like I
suggested earlier, but sent there as a result of decisions by that committee).  
 
If a consulting firm sends some of its employees to work at a company as part of a
contract, are they liable if the company commits wrongdoing while the consultants are
there? Presumably not, unless the consultants were involved in instigating and/or
perpetrating the wrongdoing.  
 
Then the key question is: were (or can it be shown that) the Valeant employees at Philidor
were knowingly involved in the wrongdoing that took place there? I don't see any
evidence of that from what has been presented so far.

LSE closes at 11:30 am EST. 
VRX price was $101.34 at that time. 
We trust that the monthly NAV for PSH will reflect that market valuation. 
 
Because it would be unfortunate for PSH if the monthly NAV were to be calculated based
on the (later) NYSE close today, where the VRX price is likely to be appreciably lower.

PART 1 
 
I agree that Valeant is in big trouble.  
 
Valeant’s initial premise is everyone else in pharma is a scumbag but gets away with
slaps on the wrist. Their business strategy is just to play the same games as everyone
else but in a smarter way and not to be a sucker and do R&D and pay taxes. 
 
It is true that the industry does a lot of really reprehensible things in the sales and
marketing of both drugs that are life-saving and drugs that are maybe even life-
threatening. A lot of people give them free-ish passes for this behavior. What Valeant has
failed to understand, however, is that these free passes are not really free. The cost is
paying taxes and doing / funding actual R&D. 
 
In reality, anyone who thinks they have found an arbitrage that no one else has
discovered in as large a market as pharmaceutical drugs, is the real sucker. 
 
I’ve started an analysis of Valeant’s top 30 products. From what I can tell, they have two
“brilliant ideas”. The first, which applies to the hard contact lens business, is to buy up all
the suppliers of a reasonably small market, get monopoly control and then jack the prices.
Unfortunately, the plot to keep a low profile while appearing to clearly violate anti-trust
laws and avoid regulators appears to have failed. 
 
The second strategy is to buy the old, small but important drug and jack the price. This
Isuprel and Nitropress. This also is a self-limiting strategy because if your profits get over
a certain level, someone else will enter the market. And even if they don’t, there is a good
chance that Congress will make your life hell and change the rules to screw you. Bill

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 25/37


Ackman’s defense of Valeant was that they screwed up by not spending more time in DC
lobbying. He fails to understand that if you do not pay any taxes and do not do R&D and
aren’t outwardly bribing people, your pleas for mercy will fall on deaf ears. The only
benefit that Valeant has claimed is copious amounts of “patient assistance”, which is just
a way to window dress massive price discrimination. 
 
The third and most important strategy is to con insurance companies into paying for
things they are trying not to pay for. In economics, we would call this a “principal-agent”
problem. In finance, we call it OPM (“Other People’s Money”). Insurance companies and
the government see co-pays as an important way to nudge people into making decisions
as if they were spending their own money. It turns out that people are ridiculously
sensitive to out of pocket costs. Give a 10 cents credit for bringing your own bag - 10% of
people will play along. Charge 10 cents for a bag - 90% of people will bring their own. For
realsies. 
 
There is a remarkable amount of collateral on the web from marketing companies that
have worked with Valeant to help sell their drugs. They explicitly discuss using tactics
based “behavioral economic” research to lower the barriers to customers buying the over-
priced brand name drug. Mostly this includes eliminating co-pays for people whose
insurance company is either asleep at the wheel (the “burnouts”) or who thinks
(mistakenly) that no patient will buy the drug because the patient will have a huge co-pay.
Virtually every drug that Valeant has that shows large increases in sales is increasingly
being sold with some kind co-pay elimination strategy. In order to make this as seamless
as possible for the customer, Valeant ends up selling some drugs at $35 - $75 month to
patients. They probably still make money on this and can show an increase in volume. If
they are not making enough money, they can simply not be very aggressive with auto-
refills. I would be shocked if it does not come out that Philidor had different policies for
auto-refills for well-insured patients vs self-pay ones.

Valeant pursued this strategy through multiple different channels. First, they used
programs like McKesson’s Loyaltyscript, where a pharmacist first puts through the
prescription to the real insurance and then submits a second “insurance” claim for the co-
pay amount. This is not really insurance - this is functionally just a write off of part of the
outrageous price because the 50% they get from the insurance company is still a ton of
money. 
 
Then they used “specialty pharmacies” that are really just marketing agencies like Direct
Success that have added pharmacy capabilities to cover the legal niceties. 
 
The problem is that the large insurers and payers are not actually down with this. Through
lawsuits and adjustments in payment agreements, they make it harder and harder to
extract OPM. 
 
Thus, we get to the most extreme application of this strategy in the form of Philidor, where
it is an all-out battle to trick insurance companies into paying. 
 
As this article has pointed out, this strategy is self-limiting. You may break the law or just
goad payors and lawmakers into making rules changes so that the effort and cost don’t
make sense any longer. 
 
At this point, Valeant’s only strategy is to get the other pharmaceutical companies to
decide that their profits are at risk if probes into Valeant continue. This is why you will
Valeant and their large investors continue to emphasize that “everyone else is doing it
too”. It will be interesting to see whether pharma decides that sinking Valeant fast or
supporting Valeant is their best move. 
 
Here is a google spreadsheet [http://tinyurl.com/valeantdrugs} that I put together from my
couch last night, along with various documents in a google folder about their sales
strategy [http://tinyurl.com/valeantdocs]. I took the top 30 products that Valeant finally
disclosed in their earnings presentation this quarter. [Sidenote: the lack of disclosure in
SEC documents is truly stunning]. I looked at year over year growth, both in absolute
dollars and percentage increase. For every product that Valeant said was impacted by
currency, I assumed this meant that the product had meaningful international sales.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2015/10/comments-on-blockbuster-valeant.html 26/37


 
Product by product, I’ve started going through the sales channels. With a handful of
exceptions, the products driving revenue growth and profits seem heavily reliant on co-
pay elimination strategies. The insurers, large payers and the states will crack down on
this - and Valeant is dead. Other companies may be doing some of the same stuff, but
they are not doing it everywhere and all the time. They also have “get out of jail free”
cards because some of them are stupid enough to pay taxes. 
 
Team Valeant keeps talking about what a small percentage all of this is. As far as I can
tell, Valeant has a part of the business that probably doesn’t make much money but
provides cover for the absurd profits they are getting selling zit cream. In isolation, many
of the statements they make are mathematically correct but meaningless when the full
scope of this enterprise is understood. 
 
The real question is how much the real franchises can be sold for, once reverse the no-
tax bonus and add back in costs for the gutted staff.

The assertions in Valeant's recent conference call that it doesn't own or control Philidor
while at the same time referencing the varying ways it controls Philidor (Joint Steering
Committee, ability to dictate hires, etc.) seems analogous to the tensions between
classifying workers as employees vs. independent contractors at Uber, et al.  
 
I'm curious as to the interplay between agency law and the indemnity provisions Valeant
highlighted. It isn't as if an employee can indemnify her employer for actions taken in the
scope of her employment.

It seems that the biggest danger is not regulatory fines... but rather payor response. 
 
VRX's business model relies on scamming payors by waiving co-pays or altering scripts.
If payors successfully pushes back against such practices, VRX would have to see price
pressure, which falls straight to the bottom line.

"patients" that meds/prescriptions that did not have a $0 copay for their intial fill could use
the cards to fill their "second" fill. Many cards had multiple fills. The clue was whether the
card started w/ a five(5). For example, copay card 50777178 as their ID would give you
the option of 6fills of onexton or 3 of Ziana, 3 of Atralin or 3 of Retin-Micro
.08%.%0776939 would give you 12 fills of Jublia and 1 of Luzu. 
This change came as the outbound program/autfill program came to the fore. In this
program "patients" were called by phone and told if they did not return the call w/in 24 hrs
the medication would be sent. A courtesy copay card was used to eliminate their coopay.
An examination of many of these "patients"likely show that one of these multiple cards
was used across different "patients" to give them a $0 copay. The program was only good
for as many fills as the original script. It is also likely that even if the "patient" called in to
suspend the med they were held for 30 days, the length of time before a new "fill" could
be filled, and then given another call. Remember by this time Philidor had established
which insurances "paid" for the meds. The more the the insurance co paid the more likely
those patients were targeted for auto fills

Check the copay cards issued to the doctors. Look to see if they were applied to
"patients" in the outbound/auto refill program after Sep '15 across multiple patients. you're
looking for ID's 50777178, 50776939. The former is for multiple's of Onexton or lesser
amounts of Ziana, Atralin or Retin-A Micro 0/.08%. The latter for Jublia/ Luzu. At this time
"PCA's" were told that anyone calling and holding copay cards could not use them for
refills event though prior to this time they could be applied for second "fills" even if the first
"fill" was a $0 copay and refills were currently $40. Give Sus DiCicco Brignoli to have her
explain how the doctors were told to use the cards.

Philidor probably had a nominal pre-money valuation of $1 million or so. 
 
Valeant then bought an "option" to acquire the existing share interest in Philidor plus 99x
addition shares for $100 million. 
 
The beneficial owners of the first $1 million were the Davenports and their lawyers. The
other $99 million became working capital at Philidor. 1,000 employees would consume
$50-150 million/year depending on rent, pay, expenses, etc. 
 
I am just speculating of course, trying to figure out what the legalese must have looked
like.

And with regards to growth concerns, I think that is irrelevant with the stock trading where
it is. You remove the enron and the huge fine scenarion off the table (and Ackman did
that) then the stock will reprice to something closer to $140 a share. Right now its a buy
based simply on the valuation even if growth sucks. Short-term, of course, anything can
happen and momentum is driving everything. But looking at 6 months out it will be hard
for the stock to stay where it is

I work in Aerospace & Defense. One of my many duties involves dealing with government
auditors. Friday, the auditors asked whether our health plans pay for Valeant drugs. I'm
not sure how to answer that loaded question. The answer is yes, currently, but the
auditors will want a more comprehensive response which relieves the government of
potential embarrassment for reimbursing expenses paid to crooks. It looks to me that we
will have to have to redesign our PBM's formulary. I can't say that breaks my heart, but it
sure is a pain in the ass. 
 
Put yourself in my position. I have to defend Valeant's price gouging in audits of actual
costs while simultaneously telling the government that we contain costs in every way.
Guess who we will be throwing under the bus with prescription drug benefit design

John, great blog. 
 
One issue I haven't seen discussed anywhere is Valeant/Philidor incentivising the
prescribing doctors. Given everything Philidor was doing to squeeze money out of
insurance payers after they got hold of a prescription, surely they were not just sitting
back and hoping doctors would prescribe their very expensive but not very effective
medicines. All of the patient anecdotes say that the doctor pushed them towards Philidor.  
 
I believe the FDA has strict rules about what pharma reps can say to doctors about their
drugs and presumably they have rules against paying doctors as well. If there was an
envelope to be pushed and laws to be broken there then no doubt Valeant was pushing
and breaking.

Great analysis you can see the commitment and hard work which pays of for the
investors at Bronte Capital that are doing a lot better than investors at Pershing. I like
more John analysis than ACKMAN unrealistuc slides ! I wonder if any employees of
Valeant that worked directly with Philidor that is terrified of.possible legal consewuences
is ready to cooperate with authorities for reduced sentences in case there are wrong
doings which I'm not sure. I wonder if Medicare was part of any wrong doings by accident
or in purpose. I wonder how the 4th quarter earnings will look ? Why VRX hasn't issued a
SEC statement regarding the whole fiasco affecting 4th qtr earnings and 2015 earnings. I
think Michael Person could resign soon? Why is Pearson hiding, I have not heard a word
from him or from the biased Ad Hoc which I don't trust because they have shares and
want to recover! Another mind boggling question is why the regulating entity in Canada
has been so silent maybe it takes a long time to start investigations but this is the most
important case that I know they had in years ! Thank you for the hard work John! Do you
think Valeant has done any.shady business in Latin Amrica?

Some names you will likely hear a lot more of before all this is through. 
 
Ari Kellen, Deb Jorn, Gary Tanner, Fred Hockenjos, Brad Greenfield, possibly Alison
Pritchett, possibly Jason Hanson 
 
I am going to suggest that this goes deeper, and affects more sales and sales growth
than one thinks it does. 
I will also suggest that it affects more Reps, and more doctors' willingness to prescribe
Valeant/Medicis drugs. If it is "good for patients" then that was a reason to overlook stupid
pricing and go for the zero-dollar co-pay rather than the $20 generic.  
 
If this causes a big picture re-think about a requirement to use generics where possible,
then I think companies like Valeant will have a much harder time of it going forward.

"Like literally, there is nothing behind it other than a one time london whale stlyle charge

You are not getting it mate. The real issue here is that Valeant has expanded very rapidly,
financed by debt. The debt service is, in general, covered by the cash flows generated by
the businesses as-was-when-acquired. The equity cash flows are dependent on
sustaining higher margins. 
 
If it turns out that "sustaining higher margins" means "carrying out systematic dispense-
as-written and similar fraud", then the equity cash flows aren't there. Even if there's no
legal liability getting back to Valeant, the simple fact of the insurance companies getting
their act together to defend themselves is hugely damaging. If the insurance companies
also decide to scapegoat Valeant to make an example of what happens to people who try
to screw them, the volumes could go south at the same time and speed as the margins. 
 
So what you could be at risk of is buying what you think is a premium drug company with
$70bn of enterprise value and $30bn of debt, and getting a commodity drug company
with $29bn of enterprise value and $30bn of debt. And it doesn't even have to be that bad
for the business - if it's got $40bn of EV, $30bn of debt and $10bn of legal liability, the
short-to-zero thesis still wins. 
 
This is not an investment grade credit. Maybe think about that a bit harder before saying
things like " I just can't see how anyone who analyzes companies for a living can remain
short after those slides".

Philidor says it was compliant with all laws and "highest ethical standards". Yet Valeant
has chosen to not exercise it's option to purchase Philidor for $0, despite paying $100 mil
to have that option in the first place. That, at the very least, indicates that Valeant thinks
there is a non-zero chance that Philidor is a liability (worth less than $0). And since
Valeant considered a full range of ownership structures before acquiring the Philidor
option and Valeant employees are allegedly staffing some Philidor positions and Valeant
has, currently and since the option purchase, the right to appoint a chief compliance
officer to Philidor....that means ____?

John,  
 
I think the combination of what you wrote about the WSJ article above (Valeant involved
in "structures and processes" from its infancy) combined with the Medicis (and Obagi?)
models which preceded it, basically everything Valeant has said about Philidor being
"independent", "not controlled", etc, is being very economical with the truth.  
 
It is hard to believe MP did not know about this. Given that his reputation is that he
himself shows up to negotiate deals to buy companies, it is unlikely that he was not ultra-
aware of everything going on and the big picture of specialty pharmacies. This was part
and parcel of the models at Medicis and Obagi when he took them over.  
 
Ari Kellen did not join Valeant until Jan 2014 and this was already on its way to doing the
wrong things before then. And the plan of how to build this out was fully in place. They
may convince somebody that Ari Kellen was responsible, but there are likely too many
people out there who know better who will lose their job over this for that to stand.  
 
The question now for Valeant investors might be... Did they hire too good a guy to lead
the ad hoc team? If he has any honor, MP will not come out unscathed I expect. He
knows explicitly ("but maaaawwwmmmm everyone else is playing in the mud!") that the
model is ugly. The question will really be how much of the "hiding things" was his idea,
and how much of the aggressiveness was due to his underlings? (heaven knows MP
himself has a reputation of being totally non-aggressive).

No, you're still not getting it. People might not need less drugs or other products, but they
very much might decide not to pay the higher prices that are the bedrock of Valeant's
model. If they shipped the same physical volumes, but of generic drugs, they wouldn't
generate enough cash flow to service the debt, and the patients would be getting the
same amounts of the same compounds. Valeant is economically dependent on keeping
some degree of premium pricing, and the question is - can they sustain enough premium
pricing to generate enough cash to service the debt, with enough left over to justify the
current share price? 
 
So far, a lot of Valeant's earnings growth has come from a) acquisitions and b) price
increases. We can rule out a) for the time being, and of course b) is difficult to turn into a
sustainable source of recurring growth. So they need to: 
 
1) Not lose too much market share to generic alternatives despite losing their ability to
push dispense-as-written prescribing 
2) Not lose too much market share to non-generic alternatives simply through having
alienated the insurers 
3) Not lose too much pricing in an attempt to maintain market share 
4) Hope that the customer-stuffing rumours (people with 20 years' worth of foot cream
etc) aren't too severe or endemic. 
 
This isn't an investment grade credit. Its 5 year CDS trades wider than 500bp. The market
is telling you that there is a material chance that this company will default on its debt, in
which case the equity would obviously be worth zero. It's really rather insulting to see
someone casually call this "wishful thinking by the shorts". At the very least, I would
expect anyone making such a confident statement to have detailed knowledge of the
covenants on their revolving credit.

Does anybody wonder how much liquidity Valeant has right now? They had 1.5 billion in
cash and an untapped 2 billion revolver at the end of September. But in classic Valeant
fashion, they closed three different deals in October that together amounted to a total of
about 1.3 billion of immediate outlay (it appears the lady viagra pill has 500 million now,
500 million later).  
 
I've noticed on the Cafe Pharma message boards (and from Valeant's press releases)
that they do not appear to be shutting down Phildor quickly at all (certainly not with the
speed that you may expect from an honest company that can easily find another specialty
pharmacy). I wonder if they're desperate - could be to generate enough earnings to
survive the next quarterly earnings report?

The cognitive dissonance of Bill Ackman and the other shareholders is astounding. The
question they should be asking is what is the VRX business model worth? Can't raise
price, can't acquire, can't use Philidor. What, then, is Valeant good at? Why are you
paying more for assets in their hands than the same assets when they were stand alone?
Then subtract from that the liabilities, costs of investigation, negative public image, et al
associated with Valeant. What do you get? 
 
For Bill Ackman, the problem is even worse. It is very possible that VRX turns out to be a
liability for him. He has publicly defended the company. He has compared Valeant to an
early Berkshire Hathaway. He has done his diligence on it. The question I would ask
Ackman is -- do you really think a company that minimizes cash taxes, raises prices,
increases HC costs, cuts job and research,tries to game insurers, and borrows heavily --
do you really think this is a good business strategy? Is it sustainable? Is this good
capitalism?

Global Trader, 
 
Material chance of being worth zero could be 10% (or X%). Which means a 90% (or 1-
X%) chance of being worth not zero. 
You choose the number. Then you choose the value of the case when it is not worth zero.
Then you weight the two and you get a "fair value".  
 
The problem with companies with lots of debt is that they have additional triggers to get to
have the stock worth zero. Lots of famous investors (including Bill Ackman) talk about the
case whether they will have 'permanent catastrophic loss'. The question is really whether
they will be forced out at zero. The problem for the VAST majority of investors out there is
not whether they will suffer permanent catastrophic loss such that their investment goes
to zero and never comes back, but whether someone else FEARS it might, and therefore
the person bails. The problem is not that the other person bails but that you bail because
the other person did.  
 
Those who bought Enron at $90 and sold at $10 still kept their $10.  
 
Those who bought at $10 because it had fallen 90% lost everything they put into the
stock. 
 
"This isn't an investment grade credit". Traditionally, the "risk" that a single-B credit gets
worse (i.e. CCC or default) is about 3:2 against getting better (from B to BB, or BBB, or
better). That means the volatility is HIGH, and therefore the option price (the stock is a
call option on the clearing value of the assets vs liabilities being worth more than zero) is
worth more than zero. The question is really "how much more than zero?"

Well no, not every junk rated stock is a short. But not every junk rated stock is so obvious
a long that "nobody who analyses securities for a living" would not buy it. It's your degree
of certainty that I'm objecting to, and your implication that anyone still short at this price is
ignoring the facts. 
 
Just by way of conversation, by the way, while we've been having this discussion, the
stock which you were unequivocally long at $100, has fallen to $81 plus change. I'm not
saying that to make a cheap yah-boo point, but rather to ask - at what level would you
stop out? What is it about this stock which makes normal risk management irrelevant?

My old boss always used to correct this to "catching a falling piano". Because there is, in
principle, a chance of catching a knife without being cut. But there's no way to catch a
piano without being crushed ... 
 
Risk management is an issue here. If Global Trader is right, then Ackman looks like a
genius and we all look like cowards. But the undeniable fact is that, win or lose, Ackman
has exposed his investors to a large risk of permanent loss of a "high teens" percentage
of their capital. If you do that on a regular basis, one day you blow up, with probability
one. Even if this turns out to be the single greatest trade of Ackman's already prestigious
career, I would still be taking my money away from him.

unhedge as soon as this capitulation is over. Thats what this is, capitulation. One asset
sale and shorts will be scrambling to cover over $90. I did 'add' to the position today, I
shorted the Dec $60 put ($5.4 credit), no hedging. Whoever is buying these puts is a
moron

Well, I will be the first to say the Ackman made a mistake in his position size. You just
don't put a quarter of your assets in a company levered 5-1. Even if you are right on a
market to market basis it will be too much of a hassle, as he is finding out. 25% in KO or
indicies yes, in levered companies, no. However, he is still up more than the market by a
huge margin and anyone who invested with him (even since his days at Gotham, heck
even if you got in Gotham on the last year and them moved to Pershing) cannot complain
about his returns. He is also up since 2013, which the Hempton investors cant say

My boss always said "if you try to pick a bottom, you just end up with crap on your hand" 
 
I see three possible outcomes - 1) Pearson gets fired 2) Pearson tries to hang on or 3)
Pearson is inseparable from Valeant because if he leaves, the extent of what we will find
will be catastrophic for the company. 
 
As far as Ackman goes - the problem for him is that he is lending his reputation to
Valeant. And what he doesn't yet understand is that this is akin to throwing good money
after bad. He might not be able to buy anymore shares, but he is putting his firm (and
himself personally) at risk by being a vocal supporter of the company. And what does the
company stand for? Higher prices, higher drug spending, not paying taxes, and, as has
been reported on, "back doors" around insurance companies. 
 
As Ackman knows, the press is powerful tool and eventually they will catch up w/ the
reality that Ackman, as one of the owners of Valeant, has been supportive of a strategy
that increases drug prices for all Americans, while at the same time trying to avoid taxes.
Then it will be Ackman with the "New York Times problem". 
 
As far as the accounting goes, look at the gross to net discount Valeant reports in their
financing statements. The change from second quarter to third is close to the same size
as 20% of total revenues. And don't forget that this is an accounting accrual, based on
Valeant's estimates. That is 1) a big change and 2) allows valeant to exercise tremendous
control over their reported numbers.

From page 36 of the 2015 proxy:

delivery of equity incentive awards and purchases of Company shares. The pledging of
the shares was approved by the Company’s Board

>> Pearson hasn't reported any share sales. 
He is a forced seller (margin call) if VRX drops much more.

Dan Davies, 
what about this 
"The struggles over Valeant and Herbalife may have taken a toll on Hempton's results. He
says after some very strong years, Bronte has been generally flat, with some periods of
gains and losses, since 2013." 
http://finance.yahoo.com/news/valeants-crisis-fuels-feud-between-144000889.html?
soc_src=mediacontentstory&soc_trk=tw 
 
And even if I did no hedging and rode VRX from $100 down to $80 (which is not true),
how is that worse than hemptom riding from $120 to $260? he also lost put premiums and
paid bond interest. I would assume hempton had to cover some above $200 to keep his
position size controlled. Its unclear if he is even up on the investement and if he is, if that
gain is anything more than a drop in the bucket. But I don't say this to critize, its a volatile
levered company. It doesn't warrant a big position one way or the other

big part. Then you have Norma Provencio from Author Anderson... Partner in charge... It
lays out there most likely involvement with dates.. 
Ironically Kornwasser was hired in Jan. 13 and on his hire date (Phillador was
incorporated in Penn) ...  
Blatant Fraud will be laid out. The piece tells it all... Can't believe no mention of it here

Good call. 
 
"And even if I did no hedging and rode VRX from $100 down to $80 (which is not true),

The issue under discussion is VRX, not your alleged genius stock market outperformance
relative to others. 
 
"I see three possible outcomes - 1) Pearson gets fired 2) Pearson tries to hang on or 3)
Pearson is inseparable from Valeant because if he leaves, the extent of what we will find

I don't think any of those options change the ultimate outcome. #3 speeds it along, and
may be necessary to partially untarnish board member names. This turd is so covered
with investigatory flies that the truth will come out at some point. Which 3 letter agency or

and when are the primary issues to consider. If Pearson stays, it will be to delay and
obfuscate while cash builds to deal with civil penalties. 
 
Someone at Philidor will start to sing when the prosecutors offer deals. It will be
interesting to see who ends up serving time. This is the type of case which rockets a
prosecutor into the big time (think Rudy Guliani or Chris Christie), so some very smart
and ambitious people will be all over Valeant business practices.

I think you can add another pharmacy to this - GENRX (Benzepro Creamy Wash 7% - I
just called and they told me that the pre-insurance price is over $700 - for a bottle of
Benzoyl Peroxide wash). 
 
This is the fourth "specialized" prescription I've gotten from this particular Dermatologist
and the third specialized pharmacy - none accepted my govt insurance, and while my
doctors indicated that they would be very low cost or free - they were ridiculously
overpriced. I have been able to use ExpressScripts instead for them, and apparently
someone is still paying full price or negotiating because they are not generic and the
copays are still higher than they should be. 
 
Of note that my daughter has the same dermatologist, and different insurance - and her
prescriptions were filled locally with employer-sponsored insurance at a lower copay - and
they were generics. 
 
How complicit are the Dermatologists and their medical systems in this whole thing? Why
are they driving it? What do they get?
