SuperCom	Update:	Management's	Troubling	History	Of	Misleading
Statements	And	Confusing	PRs

Summary


SuperCom	management	has	a	troubling	history	of	making	misleading	statements
and	issuing	confusing	PRs	which	artificially	prop	up	the	stock	price.


SuperCom’s	recently	issued	FY	2015	guidance	is	a	prime	example	of	management’s
penchant	for	issuing	confusing	news	releases	that	can	mislead	investors.


A	careful	analysis	of	management’s	FY	2015	guidance	indicates	that	a	significant
portion	of	Q4	2014	revenue	has	been	pushed	back	into	FY	2015.


No	new	major	contracts	have	been	won	by	the	company	and	the	shift	in	revenue	has
artificially	boosted	FY	2015	results	at	the	expense	of	Q4	2014	results.


Although	shares	have	declined	by	over	40%	since	my	first	article,	SPCB	remains	a
good	short	opportunity.


In	my	first	article	on	SuperCom	(NASDAQ:SPCB),	I	argued	that	SPCB	shares	were
overvalued	by	almost	60%.	Since	then,	SPCB's	share	price	has	declined	by	over	40%
from	$13.29	on	October	29th	to	$7.69	as	of	today's	close.	Although	SPCB	shares	have
declined	by	a	meaningful	amount,	I	believe	that	further	declines	in	the	Company's	share
price	is	likely.	Since	my	first	article	came	out,	the	Company	has	not	won	any	major	new
contracts.	In	addition	to	this,	management	has	recently	shown	an	increased	tendency	to
make	confusing	and	overly	bullish	statements	about	the	business.	As	a	result	of
management's	questionable	actions,	I	believe	that	investors	are	losing	confidence	in	the
Company's	leadership	team.	Due	to	this	loss	of	confidence,	combined	with	the	lack	of
progress	in	the	business,	I	believe	that	SPCB	shares	still	represent	a	good	short
opportunity	at	the	current	price	level.


Misleading	Statements	By	Management	A	Major	Red	Flag


Over	the	past	year,	SPCB	management	has	issued	various	press	releases	and	conducted
interviews	which	contained	misleading	and	overly	bullish	statements	about	the	business.
For	example,	on	October	13th,	SPCB	issued	a	press	release	announcing	the

implementation	of	a	new	EID	contract.	In	the	press	release,	the	Company	stated	the
following:


SuperCom,	a	leading	provider	of	Electronic	Intelligence	Solutions	for	e-Government,
Public	Safety	and	HealthCare,	announced	today	the	implementation	of	a	high-scale
National	Security	e-Government	contract	for	a	country	with	a	fast-growing	economy.


Investors	initially	thought	this	press	release	was	an	announcement	of	a	new	contract	win
by	SPCB.	As	a	result,	the	stock	price	increased	by	over	9%	on	the	day	the	news	release
was	issued.	Over	time,	investors	eventually	learned	that	this	announcement	was	not	for	a
new	contract	win.	Instead,	the	Company's	press	release	was	merely	an	announcement
that	it	was	"implementing"	or	beginning	work	on	an	existing	contract.	The	entire	news
release	was	very	vague,	so	it	is	easy	to	see	how	investors	could	have	been	mistaken	in
their	interpretation.


In	addition	to	issuing	confusing	press	releases,	management	has	also	spoken	in	overly
bullish	tones	about	the	business.	For	example,	in	an	interview	published	by	Globes
magazine	on	November	6th,	CEO	Arie	Trabelsi	stated	the	following:


We're	considering	a	major	acquisition,	which	will	triple	our	sales	if	it	goes	through…
If	we	acquire	this	company,	we'll	almost	certainly	finance	the	deal	with	cash	and	by
taking	debt	for	a	limited	period.


Mr.	Trabelsi's	comments	are,	in	my	opinion,	very	reckless.	I	have	never	seen	a	CEO
announce	a	future	acquisition	that	is	only	in	the	preliminary	discussion	stages.	I	also	find	it
hard	to	believe	that	SPCB	would	be	able	to	purchase	a	business	that	is	double	their	size
without	issuing	any	shares	and	by	"taking	debt	for	a	limited	period".	Such	a	large
acquisition	will	almost	certainly	require	the	Company	to	take	on	a	large	amount	of	debt	or
issue	a	meaningful	amount	of	shares.	To	be	fair,	SPCB	eventually	did	complete	an
acquisition.	Unfortunately,	the	business	that	they	acquired	did	not	triple	their	sales.	Instead
the	Company	acquired	Prevision	-	a	tiny,	6-person	cyber	security	business	located	just	a
couple	of	blocks	from	SPCB's	headquarters	in	Israel.	Based	on	the	fact	that	the	Company
only	had	to	pay	$2.5mm	for	Prevision,	common	sense	would	dictate	that	this	acquisition
will	have	only	a	minimal	impact	on	SPCB's	financial	performance.	Instead	of
acknowledging	that	this	was	a	relatively	minor	acquisition,	Arie	Trabelsi	stated	the
following	in	the	press	release	announcing	the	acquisition	(emphasis	mine):

…Prevision	is	profitable	and	shares	a	similar	margin	profile	to	SuperCom,	and	its
acquisition	is	expected	to	be	very	accretive…


These	bullish	comments	by	Mr.	Trabelsi	regarding	the	acquisition	are	puzzling.	How	can	a
$2.5mm	acquisition	be	"very	accretive"	to	SPCB?	It	does	not	add	up.	Either	the	owners	of
Prevision	are	dumb	to	have	sold	at	such	a	low	price	or	Mr.	Trabelsi	is	grossly	overstating
the	impact	of	the	acquisition.	I	believe	the	latter	is	a	more	likely	scenario.


Recent	FY	2015	Guidance	Has	Negative	Implications	for	Q4	2014	Results


Unfortunately,	management	has	shown	no	sign	of	changing	their	ways.	Just	recently
(January	21st),	management	issued	a	preliminary	outlook	for	FY	2015	which	thoroughly
confused	investors.	In	their	outlook	for	FY	2015,	management	guided	revenue	growth	of
40%	and	EPS	of	$1.20.	On	the	surface,	the	strong	revenue	growth	and	EPS	guidance	for
FY	2015	appeared	to	be	great	news	for	SPCB	investors.	As	a	result,	immediately
following	the	press	release,	SPCB	shares	rose	sharply	in	the	morning	to	an	intra-day	high
of	$9.43.	However,	SPCB's	share	price	quickly	faded	in	the	afternoon	and	finished
relatively	flat	for	the	trading	day.	So	why	did	SPCB's	share	price	reverse	so	sharply	in	the
afternoon	after	the	initial	run-up?	After	taking	a	closer	look	at	the	Company's	FY	2015
outlook,	investors	probably	realized	that	it	was	not	as	positive	as	initially	perceived.
Consider	the	following	comment	from	management	regarding	their	FY	2015	guidance:


…SuperCom	has	won	new	contracts	exceeding	$60	million	during	2014,	and	more
than	$25	million	of	this	is	expected	to	be	booked	during	the	next	nine	months,	giving
us	a	strong	base	to	start	2015…


Based	on	this	comment,	management's	FY	2015	guidance	includes	$25mm	of	revenue
from	contracts	signed	in	FY	2014.	Of	that	$25mm,	the	vast	majority	will	most	likely	come
from	the	$22mm	and	$25mm	new	customer	contracts	signed	in	FY	2014.	As	a	refresher,
~75%	of	a	new	customer	contract	is	comprised	of	initial	implementation	work.	The
remaining	25%	represents	services	&	maintenance	work	which	is	recognized	a	year	or
two	after	the	initial	implementation	work	is	finished.	In	other	words,	the	$47mm	in	new
customer	contracts	signed	in	FY	2014	consists	of	~$35mm	of	initial	implementation	work
and	~$12mm	of	services	&	maintenance	work.	I	have	provided	below	my	original	estimate
of	the	Company's	FY	2014	revenue	from	existing	and	new	customers.	I	provided	this
same	figure	in	my	previous	update	article	on	SPCB.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2847936-supercom-update-managements-troubling-history-of-misleading-statements-and-confusing-prs 4/6


As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	in	FY	2014,	the	Company	was	projected	to	generate
~$22mm	of	revenue	from	implementation	work	for	new	customers.	The	remaining	$13mm
of	the	$35mm	of	total	implementation	work	was	expected	to	be	completed	in	FY	2015.
However,	as	I	just	mentioned,	management	now	expects	$25mm	of	the	FY	2014	contracts
to	be	recognized	in	FY	2015.	This	strongly	implies	that	a	large	portion	of	the	$22mm	in
implementation	work	to	be	recognized	in	FY	2014	has	been	shifted	to	FY	2015.	As	a
result,	Q4	2014	results	are	likely	to	miss	analyst	estimates	by	a	significant	amount.	This
also	indicates	that	management's	revenue	growth	guidance	of	40%	has	been	artificially
boosted	by	a	shift	in	revenue	which	boosts	FY	2015	results	at	the	expense	of	Q4	2014
results.	Finally,	in	their	preliminary	FY	2015	outlook,	management	also	confirmed	that	the
Company	has	not	won	any	major	contracts	since	August	2014.	Thus,	after	further
evaluation,	it	is	clear	to	see	why	many	investors	sold	their	shares	in	SPCB	after	the	initial
run-up	in	share	price.


My	Interaction	With	Investor	Relations


I	would	like	to	note	that	I	contacted	SPCB	management	via	email.	I	asked	them	to	provide
some	clarification	on	the	amount	of	revenue	that	has	shifted	from	Q4	2014	to	FY	2015.	I
also	asked	them	to	clarify	their	comments	about	the	"very	accretive"	Prevision	deal.	As	of
today,	I	have	not	heard	back	from	them.


Conclusion


To	summarize,	SPCB	management	has	a	troubling	habit	of	providing	misleading	and
overly	bullish	statements	about	their	business.	As	a	result,	it	appears	that	investors	are
beginning	to	lose	confidence	in	the	Company's	management	team.	To	make	matters
worse,	SPCB's	FY	2015	outlook	was	not	as	positive	as	initially	perceived.	The	Company
has	not	won	any	new	major	contracts	since	August	2014,	and	it	appears	that	FY	2015

guidance	has	been	artificially	boosted	by	a	shift	in	revenue	from	Q4	2014	to	FY	2015.
Despite	the	steep	decline	in	SPCB's	share	price	over	the	past	two	months,	I	believe	SPCB
is	still	an	attractive	short	opportunity	at	the	current	price	level.

Commoncentsinvestorguy
Completely	deceptive	article.	The	only	chart	presented	is	complete	nonsense.	It	attempts	to	show	a	decline	in
business	when	the	opposite	is	true.	Since	when	do	you	show	a	chart	only	representing	partial	revenues	and	that	goes
back	and	compares	those	results	with	something	that	happened	in	2010	when	the	current	management	didn't	even
own	the	company.


Most	shareholders	already	realize	that	some	of	the	2014	revenues	have	been	pushed	into	2015.	That	is	NOT	NEWS.
In	fact	I	wrote	this	message	on	the	Yahoo	board	the	same	day	of	the	announcement:


"I	read	the	press	release	the	same	as	you.	It	was	basically	saying	that	some	of	the	revenues	originally	thought	to	be	in
4Q	2014	will	now	be	in	2015.


With	the	numbers	given	for	2015	it	is	fairly	easy	to	come	up	with	4Q	2014	numbers.
He	said	they	expect	AT	LEAST	40%	revenue	growth	in	2015	&	EPS	of	at	least	$1.20.
Based	upon	past	history,	to	achieve	EPS	of	$1.20	would	take	about	$42M	in	revenues.
So	this	years	total	revenues	should	be	about	$30M.	(Add	40%	to	that	and	you	get	$42M)
Since	we	have	already	done	$22M	in	the	1st	3	quarters,	revenues	for	4Q	would	be	$8M
$8M	in	revenues	should	result	in	about	.20	EPS.
We	have	already	had	.54	in	EPS	this	year,	so	full	year	2014	numbers	would	be:


REVENUES	$30M	EPS	.74


Compare	that	with	2013:	REVENUES	$8.8M	EPS	.14.


Those	huge	gains	should	support	a	PE	of	at	least	20	which	would	make	the	share	value	right	now	$14.80.


Still	the	biggest	bargain	in	the	market"

Henrik	Alex,	Contributor
The	article	provides	plenty	of	evidence	that	Supercom's	management	CAN'T	be	trusted.


The	best	example	is	the	most	recent	press	release	where	management	does	NOT	provide	preliminary	Q4
numbers	despite	knowing	them	already.	Instead	they	continue	to	tout	expected	FY15	growth	which	in	fact
would	then	mainly	be	a	function	of	missing	their	own	2014	projections	by	a	mile.

JOIN	THE	CONVERSATION


The	author	is	also	providing	some	insight	into	the	Prevision	buddy	deal	again	demasking	management's
statements	as	simply	not	true.


So	given	management's	troubling	history	of	questionable	or	even	outright	false	statements	combined	with
overly	optimistic	forecasting	I	wouldn't	put	any	trust	into	any	of	their	announcements.


Actually	this	type	of	management	action	has	been	often	an	indication	for	fraud	in	the	making.
