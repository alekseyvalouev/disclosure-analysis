Why There's More Downside To Come For InterOil
Dec. 10, 2013 8:59 AM ET101 comments
by: Whitney Tilson


After InterOil (NYSE:IOC) announced its long-awaited asset monetization deal with energy
supermajor Total (NYSE:TOT) on Thursday night, the stock plunged 37% on Friday
(before popping 10% Monday) because the deal failed to meet investors' overheated
expectations. So is it time to declare victory on what was my largest short position and
move on? No. Though I took some profits Monday, I maintain a short position because I
think there's more downside to come for InterOil.


Rather than engaging in breathless speculation about InterOil's future (fueled by the most
clueless, conflicted "analysts" and venomous, anonymous message board trolls I've
encountered in my career), it's now possible - at last! - to analyze this company based on
real information. Here are the links:


1. InterOil's press releases and presentation (here, here and here)
2. Total's press release
3. InterOil's conference call (audio here and transcript here)
4. The 80-page "PRL 15 Sale Agreement" that IOC filed on Friday


The deal guarantees InterOil $613 million upon signing (expected in Q1 '14), with two
additional payments contingent upon the joint venture reaching final investment decision
(FID), which Total expects in 2016 ($112 million), and first LNG cargo ($100 million), for a
total of $825 million. Then, the remaining payments are mostly tied to how much gas (if
any) there is in PRL 15 (the area covered by the agreement). Here is a table showing how
much InterOil will received based on various resource levels:


How this translates into fair value for InterOil's share price is subject to many variables,
including (my estimates are in parentheses): date of payments (as outlined in press
releases), discount rate (10%), minority interests (40%), value of InterOil's refinery ($200

million), value of Triceratops and other assets ($500 million), the company's overhead
($25 million annually), net debt levels (constant) and share count (51 million). Using these
estimates and then plugging in a range of possible resource levels (the latter five are the
ones in InterOil's press releases), I come up with a fair value for the stock today ranging
from $11 to $98, as this table shows:


The current share price of $61.13 is near the middle of this range, so does that mean the
stock is roughly fairly valued? I don't think so because I don't believe these scenarios are
equally likely.


I've long believed that there was only a small - say, 20% - chance that PRL 15 would ever
yield any economically producible gas for reasons that are summarized well in these four
reports:


1. InterOil (IOC): "Major Momentum" Or Just A Castle In The Air? (click here; focus on
the history section, which documents the many energy companies that have explored
PRL 15 for more than 50 years without success, and the geology section, which
explains why: "There were no sustainable hydrocarbon flows - just a spectacular initial
flow followed by failure.")

4. InterOil: Three Strikes, You're Out, And A Beanball To The Head On The Way Back To


The Dugout? (click here)


But doesn't the deal with Total, which guarantees InterOil $613 million up front, prove that
there must be at least some economically producible gas in PRL 15? Not necessarily -
though it does improve the odds (see below). Total is one of the world's most profitable

companies, so $613 million represents a mere 2.2% of its $28 billion in pre-tax income in
the past year. Thus, it may view the deal with InterOil as a cheap call option - perhaps
worth nothing, but a risk offset by the potential large upside.


If I were to guess, I think Total would ascribe the following probabilities to the range of
outcomes for PRL 15:


If so, the resulting expected value for InterOil's stock, using the share price estimates
above, is $44.


But I think these probabilities are much too high and would instead estimate the following:


If these probabilities are correct, the resulting expected value for InterOil's stock is only
$31.45, barely half of yesterday's closing price of $61.13 - which is why I remain short the
stock.

So who's right: one of the world's largest energy companies, with vast experience and
resources, or little 'ol me? While it sounds like the height of arrogance to say so, I think I
am. Big companies do dumb things all the time. Remember when HP (NYSE:HPQ)
announced in April 2010 that it was acquiring Palm for $1.2 billion in cash? That very day I
went on CNBC and said it was a bone-headed acquisition - and was eventually proven
right.


I've been short InterOil's stock for more than four years and have been closely following
the company even longer. In contrast, I suspect that Total has only been looking seriously
at InterOil for the past few months, given that for most of this year, InterOil was in
exclusive negotiations with Exxon (NYSE:XOM). In addition, InterOil over the years has
been rumored to be on the verge of a deal with a nearly endless parade of partners - but
Total's name rarely came up. In March 2009 a Reuters story mentioned Total, and since
then InterOil, its analysts, and the media have mentioned 19 other potential partners!


By far the most logical partner for InterOil is Exxon, which has a $19 billion LNG project on
the verge of completion, with scheduled shipments to begin next year. The economics of
Exxon doing a brownfield expansion are far superior to Total building a greenfield
liquefaction terminal so, naturally, all of the focus has been on Exxon. Despite its superior
economic position, however, Exxon wasn't even willing to match the disappointing deal
InterOil agreed to with Total. This fact pattern certainly lends credence to the notion that
Total doesn't have a clue and/or is taking a gamble as it struggles to replace reserves (a
problem many of the supermajors are grappling with). As a result, I think Total is likely
flushing $613 million down the drain.


An article in the Wall Street Journal in July offers some clues to what I think happened. It
notes that "Exxon's $19 billion project, dubbed PNG LNG, is among the more advanced in
Papua New Guinea," whereas Total's "foray into Papua New Guinea has gotten off to a
shaky start, with two exploration wells yielding only "modest" amounts of natural gas."
Having struck out on their own and under pressure to, in general, build reserves and,
specifically, catch up with Exxon in PNG, I wouldn't be surprised if we later learn that Total
rushed its due diligence and convinced itself that PRL 15 is a major resource when, in
reality, there's no economically producible gas whatsoever.


To see what I think will happen to InterOil, look at OGX (OTCPK:OGXPY), a heavily
promoted energy company in Brazil that is now in bankruptcy with its shares down 99%
from their peak. This Bloomberg article summarizes OGX's history:

OGX was founded in 2007 and raised $1.3 billion from private investors to buy oil
concessions in November of the same year, a month after state-run Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, announced the discovery of a giant offshore oil province
south of Rio de Janeiro.


Seven months later, Batista raised 6.7 billion reais ($4.1 billion) for OGX in an initial
public offering in what was at the time the biggest IPO in Brazilian history.


A year after that he was drilling wells. A period of rapid success in finding oil led
OGX to briefly outstrip Petrobras as the most successful explorer in Brazil by strikes
registered.


OGX pumped its first oil in January 2012, but by mid-year it became clear that the
field would not produce near expectations and the company's stock began a drawn-
out decline.


In the last year alone, OGX's share price has plunged about 95 percent…


I think we'll eventually learn that, like OGX, InterOil's PRL 15 field will "not produce near
expectations" and that InterOil's stock will suffer "a drawn-out decline."


That said, we won't know anything for sure until the appraisal wells are drilled and the
resource is certified (or not), which might not happen until 2015. Until then, InterOil bulls
may be able to pump this stock up once again, so I'd advise short sellers to size this
position small for now and look to ramp it up shortly before the results of the appraisal
wells are released. At that point, if the results are as dismal as I expect, the stock will
collapse.

Shareholders Unite, Contributor
The four reports you base your conclusion that ["I've long believed that there was only a small - say, 20% - chance
that PRL 15 would ever yield any economically producible gas"] are all the same echo chamber nonsense (speaking
about anonymous trolls..).


They contain geological nonsense long since dispelled after Antelope 1 proved the existence of a reef. I might put it to
you that Ross Smith Energy Consultancy also initially produced these geological theories, but they waived the white

flag after the Antelope1 well: 
http://bit.ly/vkgPl6


The simple truth is that InterOil has no less than three independent appraisals: 
- GLJ the official one, for Canadian filing,  
- Knowledge Reservoir, after Antelope1 
- Gaffney Cline, after Antelope 1&2


All three of these arrive at substantial amounts of gas. GLJ, since it contains all three of Antelope's wells, is the more
complete and also the only one that's public (at least the 2009 version).


We also know that all the well data are produced by reputable independent parties like Schlumberger and
Weatherford, IOC doesn't do any of its own testing.


You might also consider that even Gaffney Cline, before the stellar Ant3 well, arrived at 6.6Tcf P50 or a whopping
12Tcf P10.


The fact that nobody discovered anything here before is because not that many parties actually looked, or used
InterOils methods, and is otherwise completely irrelevant as InterOil did discover large finds, even a geologist hired by
Barry Minkow and co argued as such years back: 
http://seekingalpha.co...


So I believe your conclusion that ["I've long believed that there was only a small - say, 20% - chance that PRL 15
would ever yield any economically producible gas"] is disingenuous at best.


It's curious you lament violent anonymous trolls (which there are plenty on the short side), then go on to cite mostly
anonymous research that has long been disproved, and completely ignore several resource assessments from
independent reputable parties.

Mr. Tilson you have been short IOC for over 7 years (since the low $30’s.) You have repeatedly said statement such
as InterOil was a fraud, they had no gas, they didn’t have enough gas, and they will never get a deal done. Two years
ago you said the company was a zero and since then it more than doubled. The fact that TOT will be paying them
$613 million within the next three month and could be paying additional payment of between $1 billion and $4.2 billion
over the next two years proves how wrong you are. 
You fund has been decimated of the past 5 years. You assets under management are down to under $70 million. You
have underperformed the market tremendously in the past 5 years including last year when had a negative
performance when the market was up double digits. You are wrong and you are doing a disservice to your partners.

What personal attack. I have stated facts regarding Mr. Tilson’s fund (or funds since he has changed the

10 Dec 2013, 10:35 AM

Easy, NYGator. Do you agree with his valuation FRAMEWORK or not? Is his approach correct,
notwithstanding his bearish probabilities? Is his math right, or not? If not, why don't you point out errors in his
analysis, or your views as to where he is wrong. I think he has EXACTLY the right valuation approach, though
people can differ on his probabilities. I do think it is EXTREMELY aggressive to use the high GLJ #s, when
they have been specifically EXCLUDED from participating in the recertification. And again, you longs fail to
address the big question/issue, and that is why do you think Total is requiring a recertification if everything is
all peaches and cream?


I see you post anonymously. Why don't you tell us who you are, what your AUM are, etc., and then we can
assess your performance. I really do love anonymous message board posters who publish personal attacks
on those who post very transparently. Isn't that easy to do?


10 Dec 2013, 11:30 AM


antelope2
Richard,


I don't believe the Total request for recertification is suspect or has any nefarious implications. These aren't
producing wells yet and Total did not certify ( or have them certified) them. SO before they write a multi billion
$ paycheck, they want to dig a little. I don't understand why that is such a point of contention. If the re-
certification proves GLJH right, then Total is happy (well , maybe not happy) to pay up. 
I wouldn't buy a Ferrari online without kicking the tires, would you?

richardhabibi
Thank you for the response, Antelope. From Total's perspective, I completely and utterly agree. But I have
some thoughts:


1) For so long, many longs - including Shareholder's Unite, and indoreservoir, as I recall - were super critical
of those who questioned the lack of an extended flow test on the wells...the sort of test designed to provide
better information about the resource and whether the strong initial flows of the wells might be short-lived. I
think Shareholders Unite even claimed it was a waste of gas. Well, it would appear that Total has doubts
about the resource reports, yes, or why require the recertification? They want assurances and believe the
resource reports may be flawed. 
2) Why is GLJ specifically excluded from the recertification process? I think it is interesting given that they had
much higher P50 #s than others. Gaffney Cline, whose P50 #s were substantially lower, IS allowed to
participate. 
3) How likely is it that these firms are going to certify high resources? It seems completely logical to me that
these firms are going to be VERY CONSERVATIVE in their recertifications because they do tremendous work
for Total around the world and do not want to be wrong. Way, way better to come in low and have the ultimate
resource be higher than the opposite, wouldn't you agree? I think it is unequivocal that Total has the stronger
bargaining power, etc. etc. here vs. Interoil who desperately needed and needs Total. Keep in mind that this is
the BEST deal that IOC was able to make.


10 Dec 2013, 12:14 PM


antelope2
I agree that Total has the edge in bargaining power, but I wouldn't go too far. Total obviously needs to be in
PNG and be productive. I don't think there's much sightseeing to be done. 
Also, the delineation is on Total's dime. Extended flow tests, from what I understand, are extremely
expensive. IOC (Phil M and now Hession) obviously believe in the resource and are happy to have someone
else pay for proving them right.  
I think GLJ is excluded-my guess- because they were on the high end and because, frankly, IOC picked them
initially. I don't think it's a matter of veracity. 
Anyway, I have no way of knowing WHAT will be confirmed, but at these levels, IOC may be "hold" or "avoid"
if you will, unless we get another leg down or up. Too much noise at this point. I like Hession's confidence and
I believe he is a straight shooter and has the right people with him, so I will err on the long side. 
I think Keubiko stated that the short term investment thesis should be ," If you think Total is wrong, then buy
IOC" or something to that effect.


10 Dec 2013, 03:56 PM


richardhabibi
Refreshing to read such a reasonable post, Antelope2. With a moniker like that, it is a bit shocking!


I, too, think Hession is a huge improvement, although his pumping a new find on the last call was a little too
Phil-like for my taste. I think the jury is still out, BUT he has proven himself able enough, as he did get this

deal done, something Phil was apparently unable or unwilling to do.


And I think you are right about the stock and who should play what. Anybody being honest and objective
should acknowledge there are a range of possibilities, and that those possibilities in turn translate to various
ranges of reasonable valuations and stock prices. It is just really hard to say what will happen and how to
place probabilities of each possible outcome. In short, I like the way you have framed things.


What drives me nuts are when you have Shareholders Unite on the one hand, a former econ prof or
whatever, and clearly a smart guy, being so uber-bullish (100% offs of FID, 100% likelihood of best outcome,
and on and on) playing the role of advocate, when you would think his background would dictate something
different. At the same time, you have Mr. Tilson, who provides a useful framework, but then provides very,
very bearish figures without any basis, completely ignoring the resource reports that exist. To me, they are
two peas in the pod, and should be heavily, heavily discounted...leaving the "truth" somewhere in the middle, I
guess.


10 Dec 2013, 04:03 PM


Robohogs
I might point out that even Tilson's values per share at a given resource level are quite low vs. MS report out
earlier in week. They got to something like $49 on the lowest resource level.


10 Dec 2013, 07:05 PM


shmori
That's because all this NG is a guess AT BEST. If you think these resources ARE definite economically viable
HUGMONGOUS untapped reserves, then you are a fraud at best. An honest person would say, NO ONE
knows... because no one knows. You are long a company that hasn't sold a SINGLE drop of oil and gas, yet
you are eager to accept the company's words as gospel. Grow up.


11 Dec 2013, 12:24 AM


TARP
Blah, blah, blah. Even Mr. Tilson here provides longs and cautions shorts; "InterOil bulls may be able to pump
this stock up once again, so I'd advise short sellers to size this position small for now..." He must be part of
the -14.86 % decrease in shorts month over month. Stock prices are always in flux and this one looks ready
to squeeze long. The way I see it, like Mr. Tilson, the stock price has already factored in the negative, leaving
room for positive surprise.

Why would you expect Total to be up huge on its $600M "call option bet"......in fact if the market believed the
high 11.x TCFE number to be true Total would have been up huge instead it has been essentially been down
since the deal was announced. But the market in its wisdom understands very clearly that Total is buying a
call option for the future here....Now, should that be a catalyst for IOCs stock price...I think not.


Also, asking these questions serve no purpose...here is one for you...if the deal was so good why could they
not nail anything down with XOM or RDS? Not expecting an answer...


10 Dec 2013, 05:51 PM


richardhabibi
Well, I actually partly agree with you here, Shareholders Unite, but people in glass houses should most definitely
throw stones. Mr. Tilson's analysis is FAR superior to the drivel you produced yesterday because it at least lays out
probabilistic outcomes (as opposed to your use of the GLJ #s, which are the highest), uses a discount rate, captures
the IPI (minority) interests, debt levels, etc. And you steadfastly refused to answer and address the simplest question
as to why Total specifically EXCLUDED GLJ from the decertification process per page 62 of the SPA, and failed to
explain why a decertification was even necessary in the first place. And finally, you resorted to childish name-calling.
And, of course, Mr. Tilson is not anonymous. So while Mr. Tilson's article fails to address the previous resource
reports and what they might mean, which would have been a plus, it is far more thorough and relevant than your
article from yesterday. It must be tough to heat your glass home.

"it at least lays out probabilistic outcomes " Those are probabilities with absolutely no basis in fact or even

You've assigned probabilities that are quite bearish on a guess. Just random. You were making sense until you
started guessing and applying your probabilities like it's gospel.

Whit, 
You base your valuation on one field in the IOC portfolio. If the Triceratops discovery is confirmed, there is another +/-
10 TCF gross of gas supply which TOT has valued at $1.29/mcf based on final tranche payment terms for E/A.
Numerous other prospects will be drilled in the next 18 months. Frankly, IOC is one of the best exploration plays on
the planet, exploring in a known reefal hydrocarbon province. Where will the stock price be in mid 2015 if 3-4 6-12
TCF fields are delineated?

Mr. Tilson,


Your analysis of Interoil is heavily biased towards the bear side.


Just a few contentions I want to point out:


1)" If I were to guess, I think Total would ascribe the following probabilities to the range of outcomes for PRL 15:"
Chart follows.


This is a completely made up which you give no basis as to how you come up with these number. Rather then taking
the guess of a bearish money manager why don't you look at the companies that analyazed the data. This is very
clear cut and they are professional at doing so. They give a P10, P50, and P90 scenarion (worst case, most likely,
and best case). GLJ is a reputable firm that is trained and professionally estimates probable reserves and they do it
well. Your assumptions are an amateurs view on it, which I cannot give an credence to.


2) "Total has only been looking seriously at InterOil for the past few months, given that for most of this year, InterOil
was in exclusive negotiations with Exxon (XOM)."


Once again a baseless assumption. If you do indeed follow this stock so closely, you would know that Total has taken
interests in licenses all around Interoil's licenses. The best place to look for oil is in an oilfield. So you think that Total
and Oil Search are wring about this? Obviously Total has advanced seismic data aside from what they receive in the
Interoil data room when bidding on the Elk/Antelope SPA.


Prior to being in exclusive negotiations with Exxon, there was a bidding process. How do you know that Total was not
involved in this? You do not unless you have inside information because know one knew other then those directly
involved.


There are many more assumptions you make in this article that are leaping beyond what is known and in my opinion
are not logical. Can I suggest that you forget about your smaller short position, take your profit, and go long. That
seemed to work for you when you were short Netflix.

The short case remains: the gas isn't there. If that proves out, but now over ALL of the PRL's, then Mr. Tilson is
correct, and everyone but the short loses, including TOT. If there is gas approaching 10T's per PRL, then everyone

Author’s reply »  One of the smartest short sellers I know posts under the handle "hawkeye901" on
ValueInvestorsClub.com. He posted his short thesis on IOC on Aug. 14, 2012 when the stock was at $85 (it's one of
the four write-ups I link to in my article above) and he just posted an update on the VIC message board, which I
reproduce here (note that the formatting of his financial model is lost when I copy and paste it here, so I saved it as a
pdf and posted it here: http://bit.ly/1d6Jy5L):


hawkeye901, 12/10/13 09:49 AM, Current Thoughts on IOC


I wanted to summarize some additional thoughts on IOC following Friday’s call and additional discussions on VIC over
the past few days.


1) I think a reasonable estimate of fair value is less than $35 per share. I think the risk/reward on the short is arguably
as good as ever as the stock is still more or less flat on the year, yet the upside case is almost entirely off the table
and a significant downside case remains. At 5.4 Tcf, I estimate the value is $35 per share but I think the odds are
much more likely that there is less gas than that (ie, there is not a normal distribution around $35 per share). The
odds are still reasonably high that there will not be enough gas to justify a project, which could mean the stock is
worth less than $10 per share. Conversely, the odds that there are 9 Tcf (which would make the stock worth in ~$70
per share) are extremely low in my view.


2) I agree with Katana that the minorities should receive more value than was in Friday’s post and it does also appear
that the company is implying there will be no taxes on any of the payments from Total (but I also agree with Katana’s
other point that tax should be owed at some point by US shareholders so to completely ignore any taxes seems
aggressive).


3) In terms of thinking about IOC’s valuation going forward, while IOC did get a deal done, Total did not accept IOC’s
old GLJ report and will instead be embarking on a new program of resource certification, with a very high probability
(in my view) that the same historical geological concerns will ultimately result in no LNG project and no contingent
resource payments to IOC. So putting together a range of resource estimates of 3.5-10Tcf and assuming these have
equal probabilities strikes me as unrealistic.


4) I would also highlight two other issues that I think is worth considering: 1) the mechanics of buying out the
minorities and 2) potential claims on IOC’s initial resource payment in Q1 2014 (including repayment of IOC’s recent
$250mm credit facility and potential need to repay Pacific Rubiales’ $96mm funding advance liability). These items
could result in much of the initial Total payment not actually accruing to IOC.


5) The big question mark in my view is how the minorities are dealt with. Given that IOC can't come up with the cash
to buy them out (and determining valuation will be tricky without some contingent value payment concept), I imagine
the most likely outcome is that IOC issues them stock instead. My guess is the minorities get something in the range
of 20%+ of the company, which would also result in a lot of stock coming to market.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887451-why-theres-more-downside-to-come-for-interoil 13/38


6) In terms of liquidity, recall that the company entered into a $250mm capex facility in November that is “payable in
full” upon any sale/disposal of the company’s interest in the Elk/Antelope fields (presumably this includes a partial
sale), but we don’t know how much is currently drawn. In addition, IOC’s July 2012 farm-in agreement with Pacific
Rubiales (see filing on SEDAR/Bloomberg dated 2/28/13) would seem to indicate that there is a repayment clause “in
IOC Share Value or in cash, at InterOil’s option” if the company’s interest in PRL15 becomes “30% or less” (unclear if
this is gross or net). We also don’t know how the minorities are going to be treated, so there is a chance that they
actually get almost 25% of the initial cash coming in the door as part of some cash + stock deal. These cash drains,
plus the company’s quarterly burn, would indicate that it is unlikely IOC will have a “cash-rich” balance sheet going
forward.


7) Based on the PSA and the discussions on taxes/minorities, I have updated my preliminary analysis from Friday
morning. I now think the range of outcomes here is likely in the range of low $20s to $50 per share, with a decent
probability that the ultimate value is well below $20 per share (ie, no LNG project) and a fairly low probability that
something in the $70 per share range is realized. In a scenario where Total walks away and the refinery/Triceratops
aren’t worth as much as I have been using, you could be looking at ~$10 per share. In addition, based on the Total
press release, it is clear that they are trying to focus people on the 5.4Tcf scenario, not these upside cases from IOC.
We can all assign our own probabilities to these scenarios but my weighted average valuation results in less than $35
per share (more than 40% down from the current share price).

And where does your oil and gas "expertise" come from? It seems that longs have cited companies respected
in the oil and gas business whose whole existence depends on the reliability of their estimates. But you refer
only to other shorts who have a huge vested interest in distorting the reality of likely events. One of your
compatriots, Barry Minkow is even in prison for doing that, but from what I hear he was one of your "advisors".
Or is it NOT correct that you paid him for his services? PS: Barry who also seems to have been trusted
resource for you, had no oil and gas expertise either. Here's your chance for denial if my information
regarding your treating Barry as one of your resources is incorrect.

It really is funny. You start off with complaining about anonymous message board trolls.


Then you cite as sources for your conclusion...


Anonymous message board trolls, trying to promote one of them by arguing he's the smartest one you know. Good to
know.


All the while ignoring the three independent resource evaluation reports, based on well data produced by independent
reputable companies like Schlumberger and Weatherford that give a rather different picture.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887451-why-theres-more-downside-to-come-for-interoil 14/38


So the short thesis is, ignore the reputable parties, cite anonymous fellow shorts as experts instead, people we don't
know, we don't know their qualifications, but we do know that they do not have access to most of these independently
produced well data.


It's a circular argument, shorts simply citing other shorts.


I again put it to you that Ross Smith, who was critical, and is actually a more reputable party, waved the white flag as
soon as the top of the reef was hit in Antelope1


I put it to you that even the geologist hired by Minkow (now in jail again) argued that EA was likely a significant find.
And he only had one well to work with.


I put it to you that GLJ has put a P50 of 9.9Tcfe and this is the only party that has worked with well data from all three
wells.


GC only had two wells to work with, but nevetheless arrived at 6.6Tcf (excluding liquids). Its highly likely that including
Antelope 3 data would impact that figure in a positive way. Their P10 figure is 12Tcf, so apparently they did see some
upside even after just two wells..


You can cite as many anonymous message board trolls, with unknown qualifications and lacking access to most
relevant data, as you like in a circular fashion, the fact that you completely ignore these report speaks volumes.

Shareholders Unite: you really cannot stick to the point. Why don't you address what Mr. Tilson has written, point by
point? 80% of your post is just drivel.


If you want to gain any credibility from people with some analytical skills (as opposed to your pals over at your own
website, which has been super-bullish and WRONG about IOC for eons), tackle each and every point raised, and the
economic/valuation model Mr. Tilson (and this other poster) have set forth? You have not done that at all, but talk in
circles and words, never translating the finances into per share valuations.


Kudos to Mr. Tilson and this other poster for doing so. THAT is what investors really need, and then they can insert
their own probabilities to the Total deal. We know you believe that there is 100% likelihood of FID, 100% likelihood
that the 10 Tcfe are there, and that discounting future cash flows is something for those not trained in economics, I
suppose. And your failure to answer the most basic question I keep asking you is telling: why is GLJ on who you
entirely rely and treat as gospel NOT included in the firms allowed to participate in the recertification process? Why,
oh, why? And why is there even a recertification needed? Didn't you argue that no extended flow test was needed? It
appears you were incorrect on this crucial point, yes?


Until you actually get into the meat of what Mr. Tilson and others are saying here, you are out of order. The mere fact
that you are bringing up Barry Minkow, Ross Smith, and other irrelevancies, is telling. Try to stick to Mr. Tilson's
model.

Good points Habibi. It's worth noting that even super-bullish and perpetually over-optimistic Evan Calio of
Morgan Stanley has dropped his target price to $85 now, and, wait for it, that also assumes a 9.9 Tcfe "base"
case. Even his "bull" case (pardon the pun) of $105 is based on 11.8 Tcfe. His "bear" base is $40, but that is
based on the 5.4 Tcfe that is actually Total's base case.


Quite simply, if you think Total is right (or on a more nuanced basis, if you think you should only pay for what
Total is saying), IOC at $60 still has about 33% downside. If you think Total is wrong and want to hang your
hat on GLJ (who is excluded from the process), then maybe it's worth $85. Per Evan Calio this includes $13
in value for other prospects, the refinery, and gas stations.


Total, a credible supermajor and publicly traded company, told the world what they expect the contingent
payments to be - i.e. they are telling the world they EXPECT 5.4 Tcfe.


In my opinion anyone buying IOC for $60 now needs to start with the answer to this question:


"I think Total is wrong because......"


10 Dec 2013, 12:20 PM


richardhabibi
Thank you, Keubiko. You know I believe much of what you wrote yesterday here was essentially consistent
with what Mr. Tilson is trying to do...and what is what all investors should be doing, trying to translate the Total
deal terms into a per share valuation model. For whatever reason, Shareholders Unite, one of the long-side
leaders, refuses to do that.


Meanwhile, I have written extensively here as to why I think the E/A resource estimates are likely to come in
much lower than the 9.9 Tcfe. I would bank on it. But there is some additional value for IOC in additional wells
and option value. I think Hession was trying to say such...and perhaps provide some cushion for the stock
price...when he made some fairly ambiguous and cryptic comments on the last call about another unnamed
well and its great prospects.


Meanwhile, may I ask you whether you agree with Mr. Tilson and his probabilities? He is fairly bearish, to be
sure, even more so that I would be, and I think it would have been a plus for his article if he had at least
discussed in greater detail the prior resource reports that are out there.


Thanks again.

I'll answer that in a few ways Richard:


1) I think the framework makes a ton of sense and saves me from writing it up myself . it's quite similar to
Morgan Stanley's framework.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887451-why-theres-more-downside-to-come-for-interoil 16/38


2) I consider myself a value investor, which means I am always looking for a deal, a free lunch, free options,
and a margin of safety. With that hat on, IF I decided to be an IOC long, I'd look to pay for the 3.5 - 5.4 Tcfe
values, and use the upside potential as the margin of safety or free option. So at $40 I could see someone
making the case that there is decent value. (I don't like binary stocks generally and have many concerns with
IOC including governance, capital allocation, and PNG in general so I will never likely be a long, but I do like
the new CEO so far).


3) I wouldn't short IOC on the basis that Total is incompetent or has missed something. I frankly would likely
use something closer to what Mr. Tilson has estimated Total thinks. I'd probably use a normal distribution with
a mean of 5.4 Tcfe and a standard deviation of 1 Tcfe or so (i.e. 68% chance of it being between 4.4 Tcfe and
6.4 Tcfe, and a 95% chance between 3.4 Tcfe and 7.4 Tcfe). That would seem prudent and feels about right.
This would spit out a value in the 40s. Doesn't mean I'd buy there though.


Total is actually fairly interesting at 3.6X forward EV/EBITDA and a 5.6% dividend yield.


10 Dec 2013, 01:20 PM


fred ohr
Have any of you geniuses noticed that TOT agrees to within .005% with the thicknesses of the E/A well logs
as per the SPA? Saying TOT sees no more than 5.4 TCF is just breaking wind.


10 Dec 2013, 02:34 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Thanks Fred. Given that they both agree on the gas water contact depth and the depth of the top of the
formation, that's good enough for me.


Who cares about how much might be micritic limestone, how much is dolomitized reef, what the lateral extent
of the reservoir is, variations in permeability, porosity, well type-curves, and other trivial things in making a
contingent resource estimate.


Heck who needs recertification when we have agreement on "Formation Tops and Gas Water Contacts" ?

richardhabibi, you begin to sound like someone who would like to apply for a job at Mr. Tilson's venture. Just
an observation fro my side. 
I have seen many a good presentation by whitney Tilson over the years and I do think that people who only
judge his skills by his poor performance over the past years are not doing him justice. Any shortseller, no
matter how sound his thesis, has had a hard time over the past years with all the Fed's money printing and
extremely bullish market sentiment. 
That being said, I think that Mr Tilson's analysis presented here suffers heavily from confirmation bias. Just in
general, if my major argument rests on my OWN probability estimates in a field that is clearly not within my
circle of competence, this would immediately cause ME to take two steps back and most likely put the stock
in the "too hard" box as long as it's valuation isn't very, very favourable. There are hardly any hard facts that

underscore the probabilities used by Mr. Tilson. Hence, his existing short position and his short bias do play a
large part here, and he should do himself a favor and admit that at least to himself. The result is, that his
thesis rests to a large extent on his believes - not on his factually based opinion. Relying on statements by
"one of the smartest short sellers he knows " (yet one that is just some anonymous internet poser) only
reinforces that confirmation bias. 
I had a small long position in IOC years ago when the debate was in full swing whether the company was a
fraud or not. I closed it out later at a small profit and moved on as the overall situation was too hard for me to
value. As you may recall, mr Tilson back then was firmly in the "fraud-camp". He has been proven wrong on
that and this alone should give him (and others) second thoughts whether or not and how much to rely on his
GUESSES (as opposed to his usually fine factual analyses). 
Btw., I would rather want to own Total's stock here (though there is substantial risk that the French
government which is in a desperate state of affairs may extract money from them down the road. "all for the
public good", of course) 
With IOC I may consider doing a bullish call-spread if - absent major news - the stock comes down towards
the lower 40s and /or a bear spread when it approaches the high $70s.

Classic. You are responding to my post from December? You been sitting in a hot tub time machine?


For the record, the new CEO stated that the IPI buyout would absolutely happen by the end of, ahem,
January....and it is now, ahem, mid-February. Meanwhile, the IPI buyout is a contingency to the Total deal
closing.


As far as Tilson goes, I got a chuckle out of your confirmation bias theory, since Lord knows, the IOC longs,
sycophants, and pumpers don't suffer from that. I have to pinch myself from laughing at that one.


Good luck with your options spread.

To the larger, and hopefully more relevant picture, IOC is dead money. RIP, in my opinion, and not even worth
looking at any longer. Hence, my lack of any position.

Contrary to your thesis, Richard Chandler, an oil and gas veteran, has been purchasing Interoil shares with a cost
basis of around 80. He has almost 20% of the outstanding shares and obviously believes in the value that IOC

I'd hardly call Richard Chandler a "oil and gas veteran". Just because he's made a few oil and gas investments
amongst the many others in consumer, financial services, forestry, healthcare and other sectors? Are you referring to
his investment in IOC's former partner "Energy World" that continues to languish at 38 cents that he's held for years at
a cost basis in the in the 60 cent+ range?


And just so we're clear, is this the same Richard Chandler that pumped $200 million into Sino Forest equity AFTER it
was exposed as a fraud to see it evaporate in about 6 weeks?

Despite that I think the whole short basis has bottomed out here at 60 dollars a share. In my view we only
have upside here. IOC begins an aggressive drilling campaign next quarter. My view is that GLJ was the only
firm to look at 3 wells. They had the most data and in my view had the most informed opinion of the P50
values.


If IOC hits more gas as it drills, which the probability of is high, I think you will be wishing you covered your
short at these low levels.

Overall, I believe that Calio's bear case is the BASE case for IOC now. No doubt in my mind, having read the
agreement, listened to the call, etc., that IOC has substantial downside from here. Unlike Shareholders' Unite
and several other entrenched longs, I changed my views about IOC 180 degrees the more I read, the more I
dug, and the more I listened. And then this deal was confirmation.

10 Dec 2013, 02:15 PM


energyinvest85
"I think Total is wrong because......" is a bad starting point Keubiko. That sounds like a statement that bonkthegrups
from Yahoo would make.


Your and Whitney's premise that Total MUST believe that there are only 5.4Tcfe in the Antelope Field based on the
PR is flawed. Did you read what Hession said in the CC? He said that the certification pricing/payments are tilted
more toward the certification than FID and first cargo. So of course Total will want to be conservative but also use an
amount that justifies at least the startup volumes needed to satisfy the government's requirements for a minimally
sized LNG plant. They would get skewered by their own shareholders if they really doubt the resource and its
commercial viability.


The fact that they are only requiring 2 wells (if on reads the SPA, the 3rd is optional) means basically what drilling Ant
3 did; they want to be more sure of the extent of the Antelope Field. Naysayers last year were saying that if they
drilled Ant 3 where they ended up drilling it, they would find 1) that the reservoir was not continuous and 2) water. Of
course Ant 3 proved exactly what IOC had been saying; this is a very large resource rich in gas and condensates. We
have yet to see the GCA update of TCFE after Ant 3. They themselves said additional drilling with success would
allow them to increase their estimates. You've seen that report, correct? 
So, Total is not saying they don't think there is less than 5.4 TCFE or at most that amount. They are saying based on
what we know today there is a very reasonable probability that this one resource will underpin at least one train for the
Gulf LNG plant. What they may well be saying is they want to prove up at least 2 trains as the economics then should
be at least as good as PNG LNG. Prove that up and we are off to the races, and we are willing to pay for that "bonus"
at certification at a higher /mcfe price. 
There are too many industry pros who have looked at this data, including Dr Hession and his colleagues. To the point

Total's estimate is 5.4 Tcfe. You're just going to have to make your peace with that. Could it come in higher?
Sure. Would Total be happy about that? Sure.


Perhaps you could call Total's IR department have have them replace their firm, crystal clear estimate, with
that stream of consciousness you just wrote.





10 Dec 2013, 02:26 PM

Perhaps you could call the Total IR department and ask them why Total would even subject themselves to the
possibility that there could be 10, 15, 20 Ts in the Antelope Field and it would all be subject to that highest
/mcfe price. Tell them to tell the CEO that he might have just gotten snookered by Hession. And that if Total
really feels there is 5.4TCFE or less there, they should make a deal for just that, then let IOC use up that
$613 million proving up more. Then if they do, sit back down and strike a deal for the same /mcfe price as
they pay at 5.4 TCFE.


Now that's what Total should have done if they really think there is only 5.4 TCFE there. After all, these super-
majors (who you once said would never be seen at the same table with IOC) had them over the proverbial
barrel, didn't they?


10 Dec 2013, 02:45 PM


energyinvest85
And why not quote this from the Total PR? 
"The Elk and Antelope gas fields, two of the biggest finds in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, were
discovered in the license in 2006 and 2009 respectively."


Why say that if you are either expecting nothing or only a maximum of 5.4TCFE?


10 Dec 2013, 04:42 PM


Keubiko, Contributor
Who said "maximum" of 5.4 Tcfe? Total said that this is their estimate. Very clearly. They didn't provide their
probability distribution around this number.


It's not that difficult. They stated the expect to pay based on 5.4 Tcfe. I'm sure they'd be happy to pay up for
more. If it's less they would probably be disappointed as it would hinder their LNG dreams.


It's a bit surreal even arguing on this point. Total was crystal clear.

way because he feels that there is significant more upside potential in PRL 15 and he wants to make sure
Interoil gets paid for it. He feels that there is a good chance that there is a prospect with PRL15 that is at least
as big if not larger then Elk Antelope. In that case all your numbers are blown out of the water.


Here is Dr. Hession's words 
"and we were very keen there is a large prospect that could be, it’s an exploration prospect obviously that
could be of a SIMILAR or BIGGER size of Elk-Antelope. And we were very concerned that we got
REWARDED, if we made a discovery in that space. So it’s largely driven by that one prospect, a very large
prospect that we’ve got and we will be – I am sure you can more about that in the future."


So you can all argue about not trusting GLJ, but they look at the known data from 3 wells. I would take Dr.
Hession's assumptions as he has given no one any reason to not trust him. Or are you calling him a stock
promoter as well?

At risk of being labeled clueless, conflicted and/or rabid I'd like to offer the following: 
a) Much of the short case is predicated on deals that didn't happen. Exxon thought they had IOC by the short hairs
and could steal the project by leveraging their existing LNG project. Shell thought they could steal it by putting PNG
politicos in their pocket. I give great kudos to IOC for hanging tough in the face of overwhelming forces aligned
against them. This may not be the deal some specs hoped for, but no doubt it's better than getitng railroaded by XOM
or RDS. 
b) another short argument is the "all knowing" market crashed with the announcement - so there! Speculators were
delusional in thinking it would be a complete buy-out for blue-sky multiples. Now they run for the hills as it's such a
nuisance when one has to actually perform on a plan of development to make money. 
c) in all these financial projections either I'm missing something or you financial analysts are: 
"if the resource is certified at X tcf, payments from Total = $Y". 
It appears to me all these contingent amounts relate to Total's purchase payment for their share of the field only. Does
not IOC also expect revenue from their retained share of production? (I'm pretty sure they won't net just $1.29 at the
export terminal). 
d) 10% Disc rate seems a high hurdle in a ZIRP world, esp for short term (~2yr) payouts. Or are you mixing cost of
money w/ risk rating? 
e) ~45% of PRL 15 is worth $Y billion, but 100% of Triceratops only valued at $500mil?? HA! I'll take 2! 
f) the gas isn't there?!? WTF? As a retired petroleum engineer I'll have to side with Schlumberger, Halliburton and
GLJ &/or GC (beancounters counting what they can't see but know is there) and a bit of geologic knowledge. Without
overstating things, every indication is that these are amazing, incredible, huge, fantastic, mouth watering, world class
reservoirs! (plural). 36 more reef structures identified (to date) on seismic. On land, not deep water. Vertical drilling not
horizontal. Natural producers (minor stim maybe) not 36 frac stages. 
If 25% of the structures resemble Elk/Ant/Tri  
... what's $YBillion times 10? (or 15? or 21?) 
(available today @ $2.8B market cap).

Freedom,


Even though you're retired you must yet appreciate the tremendous uncertainties associated with this play,
correct?  
- seismic is relatively coarse 2D rather than dense 3D 
- this is a structurally complex area 
- the reef / reef trend has been impacted by the complex structural history 
- structural complexity wreaks havoc on seismic imaging quality 
- there have been no extended tests 
- there has been no appreciable appraisal program 
- et al


I have no vested interest here so am not trying to argue one position or another, merely inform. The
associated acreage & prospects may ultimately be very good. However, at the present time, they are risky
and possess a high degree of uncertainty. IMO it is sensible for Total, or any company, to take a measured &
stage-gate approach to this deal.


10 Dec 2013, 04:28 PM


Freedom Seeker
Of course I recognize the uncertainties, but I also recognize the certainties: 
~ I made my living largely on ~20' pay sands (tight & low perm). Comparatively, a 2000' vertical pay w/ reef
porosity & perm is like a tricycle vs Ferrari. Or maybe a lear jet. 
~ Most of my career was w/o benefit of any seismic. 2D may be "coarse" but it doesn't <invent> structures
that aren't there!  
~ structural complexity can be decoded w/ 3D & drill tests, refined as more is learned. (if it were easy all the
geos would be out of work) 
~ as for "no extended tests" there have been very significant DST's run (run for several days - "extended"
w.r.t. typical - only limited by surface equip & liquid storage because the production was literally 'off scale').
Reservoir engineers have made reasonable (and conservative) volumetric & perm estimates from the ensuing
pressure data, (if memory serves there was near instantaneous pressure recovery on shut in following the
~3? day tests) 
~ "no appreciable appraisal program" - just successful confirmation drilling. Heh - I recommend you all wait to
buy in until IOC's enormous - and highly prospective - land package is fully defined (and price re-rated
accordingly).  
~ so much blahblahblah on this thread that Total wasn't jumping up & down to pay more ... Is it lost on you
that they are BUYERS, and it's in their interest to kick tires & find dings in the paint in order to get the Ferrari
at Chevy price? 
~ What's crazy is this is on Tilson's board (a Value guy) - IOC in no way shape or form could be confused with
a "Value" play (long or short side). Based on the "certainties" this is clearly a Spec-evolving-into-Growth story;
and IMHO at this point the short argument is a far bigger speculation than the long side.

"2000' vertical pay w/ reef porosity & perm"


- not all 2000' is pay. N/G ranges from 11% (micrites) to 97% (dolomite); quote from GLJ report wrt micritic
facies:


'Of 6 samples tested, 3 had entry pressures that are so high that gas is not likely to be present in rock of this
quality, even at 2,000' above FWL'


- nor is all 2000' high poro/perm; porosities range from <3.5% (i.e. pay cut-off) to 15%; permeabilities are as
low as 0.0005 millidarcys


- a transition zone is expected =~165'; it will vary from area to area and will reduce the effective producing
column height.


'2D may be "coarse" but it doesn't <invent> structures that aren't there!'


-The 2D seismic data is displayed in the time domain rather than depth domain so, given the near-surface &
geologic structural complexities, the prospects are visually distorted. It is entirely possible for false structures
to appear on the seismic data.


- I am a geophysicist by profession (38+ years) and have seen the seismic data over these prospects. The
data is very poor and imaging is problematic due to geologic structural complexity (onshore thrusted terrain)
and lack of control for depth conversion. The resulting 2D seismic images, prospect maps & prospect sizes
have high uncertainty.


- The seismic data was time-migrated rather than depth migrated so, combined with the 2D nature of the data
and the other issues mentioned above, possesses low data integrity / high uncertainty


"~ "no appreciable appraisal program" - just successful confirmation drilling."


- not really true, just more uncertainties: data analysis from the wells indicates that the prospects are not
hydraulically connected and possess fluids of different compositions. Pressure differences also suggest that
at least one of the prospects may be pressure isolated and possess a limited water drive.


As for the DSTs, here is what an independent assessor said about them:


"There exists some uncertainty in the extrapolated reservoir pressures due to the limited shut-in times and the
mechanical problems experienced during the pressure buildup periods. It is noted that DST’s that straddled
the FWL did not conclusively recover significant volumes of formation water. The data reviewed to date
suggest that most of the water recovered was completion fluid."


The DSTs yielded worthwhile information, but I wouldn't characterize them as equivalent to or as good as
extended tests.


Lastly, high complexity = high uncertainties:


In addition to the things mentioned above, the reservoir(s) and geologic history here are complex.  
- The area was subjected to intense faulting & fracturing 
- The reef system is variable (reef core, reef fringe, reef top, reef bottom); reef core is the preferred target.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887451-why-theres-more-downside-to-come-for-interoil 25/38


- Diagenesis (i.e. post depositional chemical / physical change) is important and 'fabric - selective'. The best
reservoir compartment was found in a dolomitized portion of the reef. Dolomitization here occurred post
deposition and is dependent on the presence of faulting/fracturing and fluid movement. There is no guarantee
that all / any reefs or portions of reefs along trend will also be dolomitized.


I'm not saying that the area / play has no potential. I'm only pointing out that it has a high degree of
uncertainty and that its economic development is not a dead - cinch.

"2D seismic data is displayed in the time domain"


I'll add that 2D is notorious for pull-up errors at both ends of the line. There are very few seismic interpreters

structural map.

Interoil published technical reviews of Elk / Antelope (05/14/2008 & 11/11/2008) that contained a fair amount
of information, including seismic data. In addition, most of their presentations from 2012 & 2013 include data
& seismic data across Triceratops and other prospects within Interoil's interpreted trend.

However, many attributes 
available are not independent pieces of information but, in fact, simply represent 
different ways of presenting a limited amount of basic information. 
The key to success lies in selecting the most applicable attribute for the problem. 
For example, when there is sufficient lateral change in acoustic impedance, 
the 3D seismic coherency attribute can be extremely effective in delineating 
seismic faults, quantifying the seismic discontinuities at each point 
in the volume. Discontinuities that are attributable to fault surfaces include

I'm not sure what your point or issue is here. I'm still involved in the industry and my career began in 1975
with Amoco in Houston. I'm currently lead director on the board of a North America based seismic acquisition
& data processing company.


I don't believe I ever claimed that 3D seismic was perfect. However, it is in almost all situations, substantially
better than a coarse grid of 2D seismic data. And that is one of the important issues here.


Also, contrary to your assertion, high-quality 3D seismic data (e.g. dense multi-component full-azimuth depth-
imaged) contains a great deal of useful information about the subsurface rocks vs your 'limited amount of
basic information'. You'll need to clarify your 'independent pieces of information' comment since, viewed within
the context of the article and / or your overall comment, it makes little sense.


I'd be happy to address any question, issue or criticism you may have about what I've written but you'll have
to be clearer and do more than mention a few things anyone can find after a google search out of proper
context.

If I were to buy this stock, why would I pay a premium for a bull case from all of these potential outcomes? It is an
outcome with a low probability after all...if it were not, the deal metrics with TOT would be very different and RDS and
XOM would not have walked away.


Frankly, I do not think that Evan Calio Morgan Stanley's analysis framework is that far off...based on 5.4TCfe, his
valuation model yields $40 but that is his bear case. Which really should be his nominal case and the price target if he
were a conservative analyst advising value investors. But I guess he fancies himself a tech analyst with the ability to
value pie in the sky with more pie in the sky.


According to him, IOC would be a bargain at current levels, at $60, at $65, at $70 and maybe even at $75...given it is
headed to $85. Total rubbish. Very reckless of Evan Calio in my opinion.


As to the other bulls who are claiming all the other wonderful things that they will find on this field.....nothing to say
there...those are not events that anyone could invest in with their retirement or hard earned money. Would be better
off investing in companies like Twitter or Netflix at these levels as opposed to gaming what is under the ground based
on GLJ certification reports.


I always thought that companies like IOC would attract a class of investor with a value focus...but we have the tech
bulls running IOC prior to the fall and even post the fall. Paying PEs which make no sense.

GoldenGate: I completely agree with what you say about Mr. Calio, and I like the way you have framed things.
You are absolutely right in that if Mr. Calio were taking a value perspective, he would absolutely make his
base case the 5.4 Tcfe and the price $40. Using his base case as the 9.9. Tcfe makes him look bad. You
would think that someone who has been wrong time and time and time again, he would be more conservative
this time. I reviewed some of his old reports, and he said on three different occasions that there was an 80%
probability that IOC would make a deal by a certain date, and in each and every instance, he was wrong. I
guess some old habits die hard.


And Pavel is actually talking about the possibility of IOC using some of the $613 million to buy up to 8% of its
common stock back. That made me laugh. A company who has been strapped for cash again and again and
again over the years. Egads.

Not only that Habibi, but Calio his shown he is as obsessed with "the shorts" as folks like Shareholders Unite
and his band of not-so-merry men. Recall his questions on a CC about a dividend because of "the shorts".
And in his more recent (all the way back on November 15) piece, he even went so far as to put a chart up of
short interest in IOC vs. other companies and concluded that "Short Interest to Amplify Re-Rating". Perhaps
he should stick to what he does best (whatever that might be).

What value oriented long would be involved in a high risk exploration play? Ur nuts. Investors in IOC seek
exposure to 20-40TCF in a known hydrocarbon province located proximate to an enormous market for said
gas. Only continued effort with the drill bit will determine the ultimate reward, not a deal for the first discovery.

Mr Tilson another thing. I know you are trying to talk your book and cover your short so that you can get out making
money. Do you think Total has spare change of $600MM to throw out the window for a company that has no gas?
They too are a publicly traded company and subject to lawsuits so I really don't think they are that crazy. By the way
your are subject to being sued for your self serving comments.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887451-why-theres-more-downside-to-come-for-interoil 29/38


Mr. Tilson and Others,


Some thoughts.


Concerning additional shares to be issued to convert IPI interests in PRL 15 to IOC, the 20%+ increase in shares (Mr.
Tilson stated: “My guess is the minorities get something in the range of 20%+ of the company, which would also result
in a lot of stock coming to market.”), which I think is certainly not a concern for IOC shareholders. Here is why, IOC
would increase ownership in PRL15 by 32.2% (from ~58.6% to 77.5%) for say a 25% increase in shares (~50mil to
~62mil). Sounds good to me.


No one seems to consider that it is likely that not just Total wanted the resource to be recertified, that IOC likely did as
well given that it is there opinion that E/A holds significantly more gas than currently reported. The other potential
fields in PRL15 also explain the payment structure of the agreement. If IOC wasn’t optimistic on the upside it seems
reasonable that they would have settled for a fixed payment and they wouldn’t have kept 30% of the field (note this is
large than the 29% OSH will own of PNG LNG). I would like to add that Mr. Tilson I believe you do make too many
assumptions about the inner workings of the negotiations.


To support a 25 year 5mmtpa LNG plant you need~5.9tcf of gas. Given the leaked Gaffney Cline (which is an
acceptable expert per the SPA) report states P50 Estimated Ultimate Gas Recovery at 6.6tcf, even after ~10% energy
losses to operate facilities, is adequate for such a LNG facility. So unless you think Gaffney Cline’s estimates are
going to go down with additional wells (to add a rumor to the long list of others, the leaked Gaffney Cline report, only
the first 8 pages were posted on Yahoo IOC MB, supposed said somewhere after page 8 that they expected the
contingent reserves to increase with wells – included this to be sure I wasn’t accused of not including any rumors).
Based on the fact that Gaffney Cline is acceptable to the SPA and their initial 6.6tcf estimate, I believe it is much more
likely than the percentages provide by Mr. Tilson that an LNG facility will actually be developed. I would like to add
that Triceratops is a likely source for additional gas and with the other wells being drilled there is a good chance for at
least one hit. It will be interesting to see what size pipeline is proposed to be built down to the Gulf.


So, given the evidence that an LNG facility is much more likely than proposed by Mr. Tilson, I recommend potential
investors should focus on the value of the remaining 30% that IOC will own. Back in Oct. 2008 Nippon Oil acquired
AGL Energy for 800 mill at 2.22/mcf. Note that is approximately 6 years before first LNG from XOM/OSH’s PNG LNG
and see Westlake’s report for a discussion of the economic advantages IOC’s project has over PNG LNG. In probably
7 years IOC is likely to get first LNG from its partnership with Total. So, if the contingent reserve report stays at 6.6tcf
and IOC owns 30% then at 2.22/mcf IOC’s remaining ownership in E/A is ~4.4 bil, but for ease we shall drop it to 4bil.
Then add to that estimates for IOC’s other assets (Mr. Tilson provides “value of InterOil's refinery ($200 million), value
of Triceratops and other assets ($500 million)”) of 700mil, then assume additional PV of cash received (~2.2bil) over
future years given the 6.6 tcf level minus 300mil in debt at 1bil (note since there is a large variation in payment dates
this is not possible to calculate, feel free to use a different number). This estimation places value today at ~5.7bil,
divided an estimated 62 mil shares after dilution to take care of IPI interest, gives a price of ~90/share. In my opinion,
this is likely a middle of the road estimate, and while a downside certainly exists, I believe the upside is skewed
positively given IOC’s drilling opportunities.


I welcome reasonable comments. I will start by saying in the past I was overly optimistic on the timeline for IOC. That
being said, having Total as a partner places the uncertainty about IOC at an all time low.

construction through rugged terrain, workforce support and payola to tribal chieftains. Ultimate Recovery is
probablistic estimates derived from IOC mapping on skimpy 2D seismic. It'll take a couple years to decide
what, if anything, to do with the play.

Allan von Altendorf, 
Question my understanding as you like, but I refer to Estimated Ultimate recovery because the SPA does: 
p. 63 Under "Resources certification and methodology" it states "the Estimated Ultimate Recovery of
Contingent Resources of Raw Gas and Hydrocarbon Gas from the PRL15 Fields, at lC, 2C and 3C estimate
levels, in tcf rounded to two decimal places; and ..." 
Best, 
Sam

Sam,


I believe Alan's point is that EURs are, by nature, estimates possessing a lot of uncertainty. Uncertainty
associated with the specified UR is always greater early-on.


In this case, no production has been established, data quality (e.g. seismic, log, etc.) is extremely poor and
the (structural & stratigraphic) geology is very complex.


These prospects & trend / play have very high uncertainties.

Thanks for your comments Mr. Cooper. I was wondering, given your background, if you would care to
comment on what might be the key reasons for the huge gulf between Total and Gaffney Cline's estimates
(5.4 Tcfe and 6.6 respectively), and GLJ (9.9Tcfe).


Is it that GLJ is likely using a different geophysical models, analogues, etc?


Is it that GLJ used a probabilistic approach whereas the SPA engagement letter and the most common
worldwide is a deterministic approach?

5/23/2018 Why There's More Downside To Come For InterOil - InterOil Corporation (NYSE:IOC) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1887451-why-theres-more-downside-to-come-for-interoil 31/38


Is it that GLJ's methods are prescribed by the COGEH whereas Gaffney Cline (and the SPA prescribes)
PRMS?


We know for a fact that Total has told the world that it's estimate (based on the payment estimate) is 5.4 Tcfe.


It seems some folks (including Morgan Stanley for example) still want to use 9.9 Tcfe as their "base case"
despite what Total is saying, despite what GCA came up with, and despite GLJ being excluded.


Any comments would be appreciated given your background.

Keubiko,


Without direct involvement with the companies mentioned & direct access to the existing data I can only
speculate. However IMO, the root cause(s) for the broad range in estimates is / are associated with what I
(and Alan) mentioned above:  
- the geology & stratigraphy are complex 
- little / no seismic data (so definition is poor or conceptual) 
- existing seismic data quality is very poor (allowing 'flexible' interpretation) 
- limited well testing program 
- no appraisal drilling program to better establish dimensions of potential field


All of these things introduce significant uncertainties into the understanding of the petroleum system and
hydrocarbon potential of the prospects & play. It isn't uncommon or unusual for resource estimates to vary
broadly between different assessors at this stage; some people are naturally more optimistic / pessimistic
than others.


As I stated above, the associated risks & uncertainties here certainly argue for caution and the use of a stage
- gate approach for the deal.

"Back in Oct. 2008 Nippon Oil acquired AGL Energy for 800 mill at 2.22/mcf."


Picking one transaction to establish base valuation - this was the same exercise that got bulls to $1.20 Mcf.
That didn't pan out. Tilson's method of using the Total price as a basis for determining the residual value is
preferable.

Well the GLJ numbers included the Antelope 3 well whereas the Gaffney Cline numbers did not have that well
results when calculated.


So the GLJ numbers appear to be the most up to date, after Antelope 3 was completed.

A3 only increased GLJ's estimate slightly. They were at 9.2 Tcfe in 2010 on the same data as GCA. The
difference must be more fundamental.

oilinvestor787
It seems that there is a lot of debate around what Total is thinking, are they wrong or right, etc. I think it makes sense
to step back and see what we can infer from this bid, knowing that it was the winning bid of a competitive, multi-year
process run by a number of highly-regarded banks.


I’ll start with a Fact. This bid entails a relatively small upfront payment, which implies relatively small value per mcfe of
gas at less than 3.5 Tcfe, but significantly higher incremental payments for additional gas that is confirmed to be there
via certification.


I think there are a few ways to interpret this being the winning bid, listed from most bearish to most bullish:


1) None of the majors that looked at EA have enough faith in the reserves to place material value on them. Perhaps
the others wouldn’t even pay any upfront, and Total was willing to play the option and pay something upfront. IOC
wanted to receive more upfront but couldn’t negotiate anything better. In an efficient bidding process, if someone had
more confidence in the reserves, and if IOC wanted larger upfront $s, then that bidder should have won


2) Majors in general don’t pay much for resources they haven’t personally certified, so even if GLJ et al. have done
very good work, Total and other majors require certification for making material payments. Thus there isn’t much to
read into this either way


3) IOC had other offers with even more upfront $s, but smaller contingent payments per mcfe in the future. IOC is
extremely confident that they will hit these resource targets, and so turned down the offers involving more upfront to
maximize all-in value


My issue with #2 above is I can cite a number of deals that would refute this. For example, during the bidding war for
Cove Energy, the resources were at the same stage of certification (2C reserves based on the selling party’s
engineer’s work), and yet those bidders were willing to pay everything upfront with nothing contingent upon further
certification.


My issue with #3 above is that this would be a pretty risky move for IOC. They already get to keep a 30% net interest
which has all the upside of the LNG project, so would it really be worth turning down more guaranteed upfront $s for
the sake of retaining more upside post-certification? Given they have to buy out the minority holders and contribute
their 30% share of capex, cash in the door would have real value. Not saying this isn’t possible, but seems a bit risky.


Look forward to hearing everyone’s reactions, let me know if I missed a possible interpretation of this bidding
outcome.

But Whitney, what about "Dr" Hession's comments? " I brought my team.. My team, the best of the best. They were

and Yep... These are the BIGGEST NG resources in all of Asia.. woops I meant Southeast Asia in 20 years.. Why do

Why, Whitney Tilson, do you purport to have a better ability to size a resource (using zero primary data) than multiple
world-class reservoir appraisers that had access to all of the primary reservoir data for their analysis. So Whitney, do
tell us...what parts of GC's or GLJ's reservoir analysis do you specifically disagree with? Please be very precise in
your critique. Oh...and do explain to us why you feel you are 60% certain that E/A will produce 3.5Ts or less. Please
use all of the log data, geological analysis, core sample data, etc. from Ant 1, 2, and 3 and explain it to us.


Given that IOC CEO, Michael Hession, merely has a doctorate in Geophysics and 25+ years in international
exploration, operation and commercial experience, most recently as a Senior Vice President at Browse LNG
Development, a division of Woodside Energy, I am going to venture out on a limb and suggest Mr. Hession is just a
wee bit more qualified than you to assess the quality of the resources in PRL 15. Perhaps you should stick to what
you are good at....self-promoting on CNBC as much as possible. It's comical to think that any seasoned investor
would take your "analysis" seriously.

Oil Search Acquisition Plan Puts Focus on Project With Total


By James Paton Feb 25, 2014 12:35 AM ET 0 Comments Email Print


Oil Search Ltd. (OSH), Exxon Mobil Corp.’s partner in a $19 billion liquefied natural gas venture in Papua New
Guinea, halted its shares before a statement about a material acquisition, possibly a stake in a new project.


Oil Search said last year it was in talks to potentially invest in a project in Papua New Guinea that’s set to be
developed by Total SA and InterOil Corp. (IOC) The company, the Pacific nation’s biggest oil and gas producer, may
have to pay as much $1 billion for a stake, according to Citigroup Inc.


An agreement to acquire an interest in the Elk and Antelope gas discoveries “would provide Oil Search with potential
exposure to a second LNG project and from a diversification of risk perspective would be a positive,” Nik Burns, a
Melbourne-based analyst at UBS AG, said today by phone.


The trading halt in Sydney should remain in place until Feb. 27 or an announcement is made, the Port Moresby-based
company said today in a statement. It deferred releasing its full-year earnings, due today, until the deal is completed.


Oil Search, whose venture with Exxon is due to start shipments to Asia this year, rose 0.9 percent yesterday to
A$8.57 in Sydney trading, valuing the company at A$11.5 billion ($10.4 billion). It’s risen 5.7 percent this year.


Strategic Partner


Total, Europe’s third-largest oil producer, agreed in December to buy 61.3 percent of the license from InterOil and said
the size of its stake may drop should a strategic partner acquire as much as 19.3 percent.


The French producer will acquire rights to invest in additional exploration blocks and to develop a liquefied gas export
terminal, InterOil said in its December statement.


Oil Search probably would need to raise funds, and may need to pay $193 million initially, before the next payment of
$220 million to $872 million, based on the terms of the Total accord, according to a Dec. 9 Citigroup report.


An Oil Search deal to invest in the InterOil gas resources “makes most sense,” Andrew Williams, a Melbourne-based
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said today by phone.


“It’s gas in your own back yard, not far away from where you are already going to have an LNG plant, so you probably
should be involved,” he said. “At the right price.”


InterOil made the deal with Total at $1.5 billion to $3.6 billion, though it won’t receive a definitive price until at least
2015, Raymond James & Associates Inc. said in December.

A final investment decision to develop the fields and build an onshore liquefaction plant on the Gulf of Papua may
come in 2016, according to Total.


Total reached a deal in 2012 with Oil Search, which owns a 29 percent stake in the Exxon project, to explore for gas
in PNG, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc said in 2011 that it would look at opportunities in the country.

PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea and SINGAPORE, Feb. 27, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- InterOil Corporation
(NYSE:IOC) (POMSoX:IOC) ("InterOil") is pleased to welcome Oil Search Limited ("Oil Search") as a partner in the
Elk-Antelope fields – the largest undeveloped gas resource in Papua New Guinea. Oil Search has agreed to acquire a
22.835% interest in PRL15 from Pacific LNG Group Companies for a consideration of US$900 million plus further
contingent payments.


The new arrangement creates a stable and sustainable partnership to connect the significant PRL 15 gas deposit to
the growing demand in Asia. InterOil owns 75.6114% of PRL15 and is in an agreement to sell an interest to Total S.A.
The final ownership structure will be agreed with the joint venture participants with InterOil maintaining a material
interest in PRL15. The remaining 1.5536% is held by the IPI Holders (a small group of independent investors).


A Material Interest in a Partnership that Offers Real Benefits


InterOil's Chief Executive Officer, Dr Michael Hession, said: "Oil Search is a logical partner for us in developing these
large gas resources. The company has decades of experience in PNG and is nearing production from PNG LNG.


"It is exceptionally rewarding to know that someone as experienced as Oil Search shares our view of the worth of this
resource. This not only validates the value of this world class asset in Elk-Antelope but acknowledges the upside in
this asset and the surrounding acreage.

What truly amazes me is how the long touts were talking about the LNG plant being up and running by now.
And from what I can tell, many of the same folks are STILL hanging on and waiting. I don't know how much
guys like JFT, Getit, Palm, Gator, Tarue, EdS, and the others have in IOC, but given that the markets are still
near all-time highs and have rallied so significantly while IOC has stalled/floundered, one hopes that they are
not responsible for other people's money. Of course, JFT was one of the top 100 financial planners in the
universe. Sadly, he may have lost that exalted status with his non-stop belief in this winner...

Yes quite the nasty bunch, as I recall. It's a bit like Stockholm Syndrome. They would rather lose their
investment completely than feel the pain of selling now just before the "big news".


I was amazed (well, not really) that the supposed adult in the room, CEO Michael Hession allowed this to be
put in the PR:


"At this stage, calcimetry, temperature and background hydrocarbon concentrations are similar to those
experienced before InterOil entered the Antelope reservoir."


That is a Mulacek-worthy piece of meaningless pumpola that I thought was above the "new IOC", and
reminds me of the "Indications of Oil" press release of yesteryear.


I still enjoy reading "Shareholdersunite.com" as many of these longsuffering touts have turned on each other.


Just imagine where the stock would be without all of the short covering we've seen.

So true. I cannot get over the nastiness, insults, etc. that I had to face over the years by that group. It was
unreal, and these guys could not and would not think independently or objectively. It still amazes me that they
fled Yahoo for their own private IOC fan-club website. I know Yahoo had and has its issues, but they did it just
so they could shut out the doubters, questioners, cynics, or anyone who simply had a view that was less than
ridiculously rosy. Some, like Getit, clearly have some psychological issues, IMO.


Meanwhile, I agree with your current assessment. I read that sentence in the PR and have no idea what it
means, it is such gobbly-gook. But, I, too, have no position, but still have the price quote on my portfolio page.
I still wonder how the end game will play out...if it will ever play out...
