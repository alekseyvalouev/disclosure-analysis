Eros: Return Of The Short Seller (2015)

Summary


We previously reported symptoms of deceit at Eros. We will now illustrate what we
believe to be pervasive accounting deception related to the companyâ€™s revenue
figures.


Eros has overstated the number of movies it has distributed by 124% and 200%
during fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our comprehensive list of movies is
provided below.


We believe that Eros has overstated its theatrical revenue by 82% and 104% during
fiscal years 2014 and 2015, respectively.


We challenge the company to provide a complete list of movies it has distributed
during fiscal years 2014 and 2015.


We are short Eros with a target price of ZERO.


Two weeks ago, we published a story on Eros International PLC (NYSE: EROS) ("Eros")
titled, Unlike the Name, Investors Should Not Love EROS. In our prior article, we raised a
number of troubling questions about the company's accounting, such as its growing
account receivable balances and its subsidiary's financials that made no sense. Now, we
will illustrate how we believe that there is pervasive deception at the company which starts
with the most basic of numbers: the film count and the revenues.


HOW MANY MOVIES? THE FIRST FAKE


Eros claims to have distributed 134 films in the last two fiscal years: 65 films in the fiscal
year 2015 and 69 in the fiscal year 2014. Through an extensive research process, we
have concluded that Eros actually distributed less than half the number of films as
compared to what it claims. Our best estimate is that Eros distributed 52 films during this
two-year period. Below is a chart of the company's reported film production numbers:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 2/26


Eros does not disclose the names of all of its films, which if our assertions are correct, is
obviously something it cannot do since it would not have produced the claimed number of
films. This made our research project of identifying the number of films distributed by Eros
more difficult. We broke our project into a few steps. First, we employed the service of a
consultant to compile a complete list of movies and the associated box office revenue. Our
consultant informed us that there are three companies (Scrabble Entertainment, UFO
Moviez India, and Qube Cinema Network/Real Image) that digitize and deliver 100% of
Indian movies to the cinemas. These three companies combined should have a complete
list of films released by Eros and all other major distributors/producers. By analyzing the
list of films released through the digitization services, our consultant compiled a list of 19
movies released by Eros in India during each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Investors can
replicate much of this work by searching through the publicly available library of films on
UFO Moviez (Source).


Second, we went through a laborious process to determine any remaining universe of
movies associated with Eros. We reviewed film lists from International Movie Database,
Box Office India, Box Office Mojo, and Movie Buff, which are the leading websites that
compile movie data (Sources here, here, here, and here). Through these sites, we
identified six and three additional movies distributed by Eros in fiscal years 2015 and
2014, respectively. Our understanding is that these movies might not be on the first list if
Eros was not involved at the outset. Instead, for these movies, Eros served primarily as a
financing or distributing partner for the producer, securing rights to the film only after it had
been produced and digitized and sent to the theaters for release.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 3/26


We then identified all 154 movies on ErosNow that were released between 2013 and
2015. We reviewed movie posters for each of these movies looking for the Eros logo to
determine which were distributed by Eros. As can be seen in the picture below, when Eros
distributes a movie, it puts its logo on the poster:


It would make no sense for Eros to have the rights to films and not place the film on
ErosNow. In addition to the other 47 movies we previously identified, our review of the
posters of movies on ErosNow identifying Eros as the distributor revealed an additional
two and one movies during each of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Lastly, we
reviewed the film slate on Eros International Media Limited's Earning Releases. We found
two additional movies that were released during the fiscal year 2015. Some films, like
Gang Bang, were slated for production in Eros International Media Limited's Earning
Releases. However, no mention of these films' ultimate release could be found. We have
excluded these films from our movie list.

In other cases, Eros International Media Limited's film slate included unnamed films as
seen below. Perhaps Eros was distributing so few films that it felts the need to bolster its
slate, even though it claimed the list was not exhaustive (Source).


In summary, there were just 29 movies for the fiscal year 2015 and 23 movies for the fiscal
year 2014 that could be identified using our exhaustive process.

We challenge the company to identify the other 82 films it claims to have distributed during
fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Our exhaustive investigation leads us to believe that Eros
distributed less than half as many movies as it claims to have distributed.


FAKE MOVIES = FAKE REVENUES


Based on our research, Eros appears to have overstated its fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015
theatrical revenues by at least 82% and 104%, respectively.


Eros claims that it generated $123 million of theatrical revenue during fiscal 2015, but our
research from publicly available sources reveals that actual theatrical revenue was only
$60 million, an overstatement of 104% of its actual revenue. Even if we missed films in our

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 7/26


analysis, it is unlikely that any of the missed films would have been a material contributor
to revenue.


We believe our figures are generous. Five of the twenty-seven films listed above are Tamil
films. Revenue from Tamil films is not tracked independently and our research has
indicated that there is frequently revenue exaggeration for Tamil films (Source). We also
gave Eros full credit for Kochadaiiyaan. This movie was a Tamil blockbuster, but Eros only
participated in the less lucrative Hindi release. Our research has shown that the Hindi
version did very poorly and was a financial disaster, but we cannot find a source that
precisely divides the film's revenues between its Hindi and Tamil versions.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 8/26


For fiscal 2014, we calculated a revenue overstatement of 82%.


We challenge the company to publicly release the revenues it earned from its supposed
134 films released in the past two years.


FAKE REVENUE? HIDE IT OVERSEAS!


In trying to justify the high levels of overseas revenue it books, Eros claims that the
contribution from India is just 50-55% of its total revenues, regardless of in which
geography the revenue is booked. However, according to the 19 Eros films tracked on Box
Office India, 88% of the gross box office for these films was earned in India in the fiscal
year 2015, as can be seen in the following chart. This seems to significantly contradict the
company's claims regarding in which geography it earns its revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 9/26


Likewise, KPMG, in its "Indian Media and Entertainment Industry Report" suggests a
similar conclusion (Source). It breaks out the revenue sources of the Indian Film Industry
as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 10/26


If one were to absurdly assume that Home Video, Cable and Satellite Rights, and Ancillary
Revenue Streams all come from outside India, Indian revenue would still be 74% of the
total for the calendar year 2014. Looking just at the theatrical revenues for the Indian film
industry, KPMG estimates that 92% of the revenue comes from India. Thus, Eros' claim
that only 50-55% of its revenue is derived from India seems implausible given the market
in which it operates. We imagine that it is undoubtedly easier to book fake transactions in
tax-free jurisdictions like the UAE, BVI, and Mauritius with tiny auditors than it is to fool
Grant Thornton in India. In a similar situation, we would note that Globo Plc was just
caught deceiving Grant Thornton in a fraud (Source). Thus, the difference between
industry norm levels of overseas revenues and Eros' level of overseas revenue is most
likely due to invalid and forged transactions booked in exotic jurisdictions like the Isle of
Man and the United Arab Emirates.


When a company fakes its revenue, it needs to find a way to keep its financial statements
balanced. The easiest way to do this is to create fake accounts receivable, which is then
usually reflected in a rising Days Sales Outstanding ("DSO"). In Eros' case, its DSO has
increased steadily over each of the past five years, including the most recent quarter
(based off of LTM Revenue).


EROS TELEVISION AND DIGITAL REVENUE? EVEN MORE FAKE


During fiscal years 2015 and 2014, Eros reported revenue from television syndication of
$101 million and $80 million, respectively. Eros also claims to have earned $60 million and
$48 million in digital and ancillary revenue in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. We
cross-referenced Eros' revenue derived from television and digital to KPMG's Report
(Source). Using the average foreign exchange rate, the entire Indian Film Industry earned
$241 million from Cable and Satellite Rights and $158 million from Digital and Ancillary in
2014, according to KPMG. Eros' reported revenue implies 42% and 38% market share of
the industry's total Cable and Satellite Rights and the industry's total Digital and Ancillary
revenue, respectively. These levels of penetration seem implausible based on the much
smaller proportion of gross box office receipts represented by Eros' reported theatrical

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 11/26


revenues (which we have shown appear to be inflated to start with). Indeed, Eros only
accounted for 15-19% of the industry's revenue from theatrical sources over the past four
years.


If one were to use our more reasonable theatrical revenue calculations, the box office of
films distributed by Eros would represent just 9% of the total market.


Furthermore, according to KPMG, industry revenue from Television Syndication rights
declined from 2013 to 2014. In contrast, Eros reported 26% growth in revenue from
Television Syndication rights over a similar period. We find it implausible that Eros was
able to grow its market share of Television Syndication rights by 11% points between fiscal

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 12/26


2014 and fiscal 2015 when its box office market share was up only 3% points (or up 0.5%
points based on our calculated results). When compared to our more reasonable
estimates of the company's actual revenues from theatrical distribution, its reported
Television Syndication rights revenues look even more exaggerated. The company gives
no justification for its abnormally high market share in Television Syndication rights and
Digital and Ancillary revenues. We believe the justification is simple: the shares of
Television Syndication rights and Digital and Ancillary revenues are fictional.


WHEN YOU ARE CAUGHT? DENY, DISTRACT, AND DISCREDIT


Eros' management was caught with its pants down last week. So to keep their gravy train
going, they employed time-honored tactics of denying their misdeeds, distracting investors
with irrelevant data, and trying to discredit the critic and its data. They also made some
bold promises, which appear unlikely to come true.


The company states that the receivable growth is a combination of $50 million from sales
growth and $31.2 million from the extension of payment terms to customers. There is no
reason why 100% of Eros' reported revenue growth should occur without any increase in
cash collections. Furthermore, there is no explanation for why payment terms were
extended. The company states that its receivables will decrease to $150-160 million by
the end of the fiscal year 2016. We remain skeptical. Previous long investor Knight Assets
& Co. was "assured by management" that the company's receivables position would
decline. Knight Assets & Co. has since sold its long position in mid-October after
management's promises never came to fruition (Source).


The company also points to the age of the receivables and claims that only $6 million of
the receivables are over twelve months old. Receivable aging can be easily manipulated
through tactics such as renegotiating receivables or paying old receivables with new ones.
We believe that the cash (or lack thereof) tells the real story.


Management also tries to distract investors by pointing to the company's dominance in
markets such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Russia, Africa, Poland and Indonesia. This
is simply a tactic to cloud the issues at hand by adding additional geographies for
investors to consider as potentially "big" markets for Eros to exploit. Furthermore, for
many of these markets, Eros uses a sub-distributor, meaning that the revenue Eros would
be due from these countries is probably immaterial. We believe that discussing these tiny
markets for Indian content is just a distraction from the real issue: Eros is possibly booking
fake revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 13/26


Eros believes that its amortization policy is more conservative than its U.S. counterparts.
Eros says that its amortization period should be longer than its U.S. counterparts due to a
longer revenue "tail" because the Indian media and entertainment sector is growing
rapidly. There are multiple problems with that argument. First, the company can believe
whatever it likes, but it doesn't change the fact that its amortization policy is significantly
longer than the amortization policies at Dreamworks (NASDAQ:DWA), MGM Studios, and
Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) (NASDAQ:FOXA) (Source). In addition, the
"tail," which is the value attributed to a film after it leaves the box office, comes from the
home entertainment and TV markets. Therefore, in order to properly match the recognition
of revenues and expenses, more mature markets such as the U.S. and Europe, with more
developed home entertainment supply chains and lower levels of piracy, should use
longer amortization periods than markets like India (Source). In contrast, companies in
markets that depend more on box office revenues, like India, need to use faster
amortization periods to properly match revenues and expenses.


Of note, there was a prior transaction in which a Hollywood studio acquired an Indian film
production company and determined that the fair value of the acquired company's "tail"
was much smaller than the value at which it was being carried by its prior Indian owner.
Disney (NYSE:DIS) acquired UTV, an Indian film production and distribution company, in
2012. Subsequent to that acquisition, Disney had to take significant balance sheet write
downs that resulted in earnings losses during 2012 and 2013 (Source).


Eros claims it has very little exposure to flops due to television pre-sales, a modest
budget, and lower advertising costs relative to Hollywood films. As seems to be the trend
with Eros, the truth is an entirely different matter. Based on data from Koimoi, only two of
Eros' 32 films with worldwide distribution rights released in fiscal years 2014 and 2015

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 14/26


have been hits. In contrast to its assertions, Eros has distributed one losing film and eight
flops during the last two fiscal years (Source: 2015, 2014, and 2013). Koimoi defines a
flop as a film which loses 50% or more of the investment and a losing film as one that
does not recover the investment but loses less than 50% of it. We think it is implausible
that Eros is not recognizing impairments on its films with so many flops and losing films.


When addressing its international subsidiaries, Eros says that it consolidates its
subsidiaries and that as a result, any intercompany transactions get canceled out. This
explanation is inadequate. It doesn't address how an entity can have an increase in
receivables equal to 120% of revenue booked. Nor does it explain why on a consolidated
level, the questionable subsidiaries in locales such as the UAE are growing so quickly
while not collecting receivables.


In response to a question about its capital spending relative to the production mix, Eros
claims capital spending is incurred over a three-year period, making it impossible to
directly tie any specific year's capital spending to the year's film slate. Further, the
company claims that there are expenditures related to ErosNow in the fiscal year 2015. In
essence, Eros is saying that investors should not extrapolate what an appropriate level of
CapEx should be based solely on the number of high, medium, and low budget films
distributed in a given year. We have trouble believing this assertion given the fact that
Eros released 16% fewer films in the fiscal year 2015 than it did in the fiscal year 2013,
yet the company's capital spending was 48% higher in fiscal 2015. Regarding its assertion
that there are capital expenditures related to ErosNow, we would note that ErosNow was
launched in the fiscal year 2012 and we see no disclosure from the company to indicate
that there was any acceleration in capital spending related to ErosNow during fiscal year
2015.


Regarding free cash flow, the company is proud of the $32.7 million in free cash flow that
it generated during the fiscal year 2010. However, Eros fails to address the negative free
cash flow generated every year thereafter. Eros also brags about the $388 million in
operating cash flow that it has delivered during the past three years, but the company fails
to mention its $626 million in capital spending over the same period.


The company also ignores the fact that it employed a small accounting firm to audit its
largest global subsidiaries, instead choosing to highlight Grand Thornton India as its
auditor for the parent company. In our view, this does not preclude Eros from perpetuating
a scam. Importantly, the company does not explicitly state that Grant Thornton India LLP
audits the subsidiaries. Instead, Eros loosely implies this by saying "Grant Thorntonâ€¦
performs the audit of the company's consolidated financial statements, which includes its

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 15/26


subsidiaries." In reality, one of Eros' subsidiaries is now using a new, apparently tiny
auditor named Jayesh Sheth & Co. after the prior one resigned (Source here and here).
As we pointed out in our previous Seeking Alpha article, the former auditor who resigned,
Anil Jagetiya & Co., may have resigned from the nine subsidiaries it was auditing. Jayesh
Sheth & Co. may be auditing all nine subsidiaries now.


Eros states that related party transactions are all disclosed publicly. While this may be
okay for reporting purposes, the level of related party transactions should be a massive
red flag for investors. Management fails to disclose why an executive's mother owns 99%
of Next Gen Films, a company with no employees, and why Next Gen received 9%, 14%
and 13% of Eros's capital spending during fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.


The company now states that it hopes to have a few million ErosNow paying subscribers
worldwide over a three- to five-year horizon that will contribute significantly to revenue and
EBITDA in the long run. This is quite different than the grand-standing management did at
the FBR Digital Media Thought Leaders Conference on October 8, 2015 (Source:
Beginning at 32:00). During its "fireside chat," management stated an aspiration of having
100 million subscribers paying $1 per month with virtually zero costs, or close $1.2 billion
going straight to EBITDA. Further, if the company wanted investors to view ErosNow as a
free option, it makes no sense that there were fifty-four slides from its Analyst Day
devoted to ErosNow compared to just twenty-seven slides to discuss its base business.


Management also called attention to the fact that Eros was a distributor of eight of the top
fifteen films for the calendar year 2015, including two out of the top three grossing films.
That would be great if those films led to cash profits. Based on our research, however,
only two of these eight films were profitable, Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Tanu Weds Manu
Returns. Incidentally, while both of these films were calendar year 2015 releases, neither
are in the fiscal 2015 revenue numbers as they were released after March 31, 2015. We
also find it misleading for the company to provide a chart with the gross box office
receipts. Eros, as the distributor, only keeps about 40% of the gross box office receipts.
Further, for three of those eight films, Eros only has control over the international
distribution, which is a small fraction of the Indian box office receipts. In other cases, Eros
does not receive the TV and Digital Rights, which we believe was the case with Bajrangi
Bhaijaan. Salman Khan appears to have retained those rights, not Eros.

Comments (35)


When a company commits a scam, the symptoms often run throughout its financials. Last
week, we highlighted the symptoms at Eros but did not show the genesis of the potential
scam. Since our first article, we have continued with our extensive research project and
we now show that Eros appears to have over-reported the number of movies it released
as well as the theatrical revenues it earned from these movies. Even if we missed some
smaller, regional films, the public sources we utilized should have identified Eros' most
important films, which we believe account for all of Eros' meaningful revenue.
Furthermore, the sources of Eros' revenue are disproportionate to industry averages and
public numbers. Relative to the market in which it operates, the company has too much
revenue originating from Overseas as well as from TV Syndication and Digital and
Ancillary sources. Our research strongly suggests that Eros is yet another scam being
perpetrated on investors. Unless management changes its historical approach to
transparency and is able to provide support for the number of distributed films and the
company's revenues, we feel that this Bollywood story will have a very bad ending.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 17/26


First you yourself were able to identify movies which your esteemed consultant missed that means your process is
NOT foolproof.  
Second the movies you have missed are small budget regional movies on which you will never find any information
on the internet. Even if these so called missed movies are 50% in numbers, I can challenge you with all my 30 years
of watching and tracking Bollywood movies, that there budget will not even be 10% even 5% will be optimistic.  
Bollywood makes 1500 movies each year and counting regional movies the number would be 5000. 90% of these
movies are inconsequential both in terms of budget and revenue generated. 
So assuming these 50% of movies you missed contributed to 50% of Revenue and therefore the Revenues are
overstated by 50%, is over the top and height of exaggeration. Please put up with more credible story and use locally
experienced analysts!

In India roughly 1200-1500 movies are made across all languages (not 5000 as claimed by you). Check UFO
Moviez DRHP.


If the company is distributing higher number of movies then why we are unable to trace them. In this age of
digitization you can hide any fact (need to know the name only..no competitive information).


Other arguments are bogus.

Agree with Rohal. Can't extrapolate revenues of obscure/flop movies using figures from the known/hit movies.

These hit pieces on EROS are well timed, anybody who calls for a zero price target while EROS has proven revenues
that the entire world can attest to is laughable. 
Anybody can put out a barrage of very exaggerated claims of fraud each and every time the stock begins to get its
footing. The short strategy is cookie cutter and this one bares no originality. Claims of fraud, zero stock price target
ala Bill Ackman and HLF attacks,,,really ?


Some times I wonder if shorts are just tools for some secret long agenda, bash the company so some body can enter
at a lower price.


Weird how this attack began just when EROS went onto CNBC and NYSE. 
We all know CNBC is the kiss of death, Imagine stock price had EROS not been in CNBC studios and had they not
rung the NYSE opening bell. I imagine a $60 stock price by now. Instead they walked right into a den of snakes.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 18/26


This short seller is getting really desperate, being unable to keep the price below $10 for a profitable exit. In the
process of making others wait to see worthlessness in the stock ($0), he is going to make the wait worthless. Far
fetched imagination from a far off land without comprehending the local ground realities. When as an outsider it is
impossible to have a handle on such a diverse array of factors involved in determining revenues, he throws figures
and consultants into the mix to prove his biased fantasy, which again as an outsider is truly unfathomable. Finally he
has fallen into the hands of the company which should find the naming of the films numbered an easy task. Goodbye
short seller.

For all the movies you listed, EROS is the Producer or Co-Producer but you only consider distributors take as profit.
For example one of the big movie I see is "Raanjhnaa" where EROS was sole Producer. Distributors share is 50% of
Net Gross in general and even for this movie. So, your claim of $60 million revenue is gross miscalculation!

I really wish Seeking Alpha wouldn't tag hit pieces like this as a "must read". Just because it's a long piece doesn't not
mean it's a good one. Most of the comments here have torn the disingenuous arguments apart - it's very apparent
that this short seller has not done his research into the industry at all or he would know that distribution rights are not
all-or-nothing.


I'm also going to repaste a comment I posted on the last piece:


I must question how much market manipulation is occurring here. There have been some great responses here,
elsewhere on the internet, and by Eros management themselves to these unsubstantiated claims made in this article
and elsewhere. But more importantly, I really believe there's an attempt to manipulate the market going on here. Just
to lay out a timeline:


October 20th: Market Farce, an anonymous Twitter account whose first Tweet was on October 10th of 2015, posts the
first Tweet, questioning the user count of Eros Now, using App Annie. Worth noting, 120/157 total actual Tweets (so
excluding re-tweets) by this user involve Eros.


October 30th: "Alpha Exposure" posts this article, reiterating many of the same claims that @Market_Farce laid out.
Let's also note that this is during Eros International's quiet period (2Q16 results are to be announced mid-November).

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 19/26


November 2nd: Eros addresses all the concerns, along with an independent review by one of the largest law firms in
the world (Skadden Arps, which was ranked by Vault as the third most prestigious law firm in the United States). See
the response here: http://bit.ly/1Pm4Zqh


November 6th: Glaucus Research's Soren Aandahl (who has prior used social media to push the firm's shorts) gives
a presentation at the "Invest for Kids" conference in Chicago, pitching Eros as a short (http://bit.ly/1Pm4Zqj),
reiterating almost the exact claims made by Market Farce and Alpha Exposure.


November 7th: This event is profiled in Barron's and Eros is picked as a short by Soren. While the short thesis is not
fleshed out in this short article, it is prominently displayed under Barrron's table of contents, with the title: "Baidu,
Bollywood, and Beyond" (with Bollywood referring to the short pitch on Eros International)


November 10th: High off the Barron's Piece, "Alpha Exposure" publishes another hit piece that features a gross
misunderstanding of the Indian film industry, again during Eros' quiet period.


Now, my question is this: who are all these players? Are Market Farce, Alpha Exposure, and Soren Aandahl three
independent short sellers who happened to come to the same hypotheses and make the same claims against the
same small Indian company, underfollowed in the investment community?


Or is there maybe the possibility that there is a relation between all these players and some obvious market
manipulation is occurring and someone is profiting directly off it?


Here's a great Bloomberg article on such trends: Anonymous Analysts Are Wreaking Havoc in the Asian Markets
(http://bloom.bg/1Pm4Zqm)


Now I'm not a mouthpiece for Eros or a professional investor. I'm just someone who has followed the Eros
International story for a while now. I have invested some of my own personal account (and retirement) in the stock
because I believe in the story and in this management team. I fundamentally believe this stock will work, but it's
painful to watch my investment get hit so hard because of what I believe may be market manipulation by a short seller
who is abusing social media for his own gain.


These are just my personal thoughts that I am sharing. I welcome open debate.

Your insight is exactly what is needed as this shorts sellers transgression and pontification needs to be

I strongly feel this article is meant to make investors jittery. I will hold the stock of EROS coz I believe Entertainment
industry has a bright future in a country like India where people flock to cinema every now and then. TV satellite and
music rights are sold so expensively that they cover the production cost of movie more often than not. I have been
researching on the figures and I assure you that EROS has made enough profits. Overseas revenues might not be
only theatrical ... it may be something not disclosed. You need to understand Indian film industry has lots of cash
involved and may not be strictly ethical.

You challenge EROS to provide data and I challenge you. I challenge you to support your hypothesis that price will hit
zero.


Like others I found your article full of holes and misconceptions. I'm not really concerned about your general lack of
knowledge surrounding most of the topics you covered in this article, though it is a problem; what I am concerned
about is that you state a hypothesis and you do not support it. Why Zero? How is it going to happen? What's your
time frame? You don't actually formulate an argument for that.

Eros's strength has always been distribution of movies and not making content hence once they indulge in making
content (whether for Eros Now or Trinity pictures) it should be a big red flag.


Also the lack of professional management in the company, almost negligible independent directors on the board is
scary.


But I guess at the CMP it is discounting every red flag unless they have committed a massive fraud.


Cheers, 
Happy Investing

Hey Alpha Exposure your intention to manipulate share price and create panic is completely exposed...your facts are
half baked doesnt reveal the complete information...


While counting the number of movies did you include the movies released by Ayngaran International (51% owned by
Eros) and its subsidiaries.


FYI Ayngaran is primarily into releasing Tamil movies in the overseas market via its 3 international subsidiaries. So
when Ayngaran distributes a movie you cannot see a Eros logo in its banner. Link to the website is

Hopefully you include the movies released by Ayngaran and then redo your analysis.

you dont see the Eros logo in any of the banners...

When pointed out on his miss on the biggest piece of revenue ie theatrical, he comes out with a consultant and
derived revenue figures. After writing such an elaborate first piece wherein he has conveniently overlooked the
theatrical revenues, comments made here make him sit up and appoint a consultant who within days discovers
figures insinuating material underreporting of theatrical revenues. He is posing a serious threat to free market
discovery by posting an article seemingly elaborate but filled with a lot of biased hypothesis which truly is more
harmful than guiding. He has to reveal a lot of things including the name of the consultant based on whose data these
conclusions were drawn.  
What does he mean when he says " Eros loosely implies this by saying 'Grant Thorntonâ€¦ performs the audit of the
company's consolidated financial statements, which includes its subsidiaries'." How can that be concluded as a loose
statement uttered so loosely by the author himself.  
Its high time some serious action is taken by the authorities on these wild and biased hypothesis.

bullish_bear007
Alpha Exposure I am fed up with your incomplete analysis..Here you go another example of incomplete analysis


I am just quoting one example i.e. Lingaa


Do you even know how the business work in Tamil movie industry? 
Distribution right was bagged by Eros at Rs ~110Cr. Eros then sells the distribution right to area wise sub-disributors
(various regions in Tamil Nadu, AP, Telangana, Kerala). In this particular venture (i.e. Lingaa) Eros had already
recovered the cost by pre-selling the distribution right. So when the movie tanked at the box office, the sub
distbributor ended up making losses not Eros. So theatrical revenue booked by Eros would be 110Cr not the actual
box office proceeds. Link http://bit.ly/1MYujm2 and http://bit.ly/1MYvUYS


FYI Rajnikanth compensated the sub-distributors.


This is how exactly the distribution of Tamil, Telugu works which is very different from Hindi movies where your
calculation works (55% exhibitor and 45% distributor).


Eros did distribute many big budget regional movies in FY15 (which didnot do well at the boxoffice) hence the actual
theatrical revenue booked by company would be different from the box office proceed.


I am writing this so that the investors can take a informed decision.


Disclosure No position in either Eros Plc or Eros Media


12 Nov 2015, 03:16 AM


bullish_bear007
here is another example http://bit.ly/1O5lILx


if you see the above link distributor got only 55 Cr (domestic distributor was Eros) whereas the sub-distributor
got 85 Cr...this is how sub-distribution works in Regional markets (i.e. except Hindi)...


Happy to clarify further queries

Hi,  
While I agree with the spirit of the article, I do have two small questions:


1. While reading Eros's Annual report, I noticed that the accounting policies the accounting for Distributor share and
for own production is different. So thought I'd try to understand this.


Let's say Eros paid a certain amount say Rs. X for Bajrangi bhaijaan. These are probably shown under content
advances unless I'm mistaken. The net revenues are Y (before exhibitor's share).


This means that Eros should ideally report Y as the revenues and show X against the same as costs. If so, then the
revenues don't really seem to be overstated. If however, instead the company reports ONLY the Distributor's share as
its revenues then there does appear to be a problem. I however think that the former is the case because as per the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3671166-eros-return-short-seller-2015 24/26


accounting policy in the notes to accounts, the advances paid to acquire distribution rights are reported as content
advances and are expensed off so it makes sense for them to report the total revenues (minus exhibitor's share) as
their gross revenues.


2. Does Eros distribute any foreign films in india which may potentially form part of its count of distributed films? Also,
if Eros distributes a south indian film in 4 languages in different states of south india, does that count as 1 distribution
or 4 distributions?


Additionally just 1 comment on the overstatement of revenues:


Tanu Weds Manu returns was released in May 2015, it reported revenues (Net Box Office) of 150 crores and
Worldwide of over 200 crores. Since it was an Eros production, it makes sense for them to report the kind of revenue
numbers that they have been reporting as well as the jump in EBITDA. I say this because I believe that as the film
was both distributed and produced by EROS, it should've pocketed a handsome sum out of the net worldwide
revenues of 200 crores as well. A reasonable figure would be say 70% - So this means that out of 475 crores that
Eros reported in consol revenues - 150 crores would be Tanu Manu Alone in June 30 quarter. There were also several
other big budget films that Eros distributed.


The same goes for Bajrangi Bhaijaan in September Quarter. Eros acquired the Global Distribution rights for the
company. It has earned 315 crores net in India and 500+ crores world wide (Net). All of these revenues (minus the
exhibitor's share) should be reported by Eros in their P&L. So the revenues of September quarter of 511 crores again
don't seem to be exaggerated at all.


I guess I'm just being optimistic, but it just doesn't logically seem correct that all of this fraud can be done so easily.


I do however agree with the point that 75% of these revenues should ideally come from India, as per the
management, this percentage is currently at 60%. This discrepancy however, may be resolved if we consider the
difference in taxation. In india, entertainment taxes are very heavy, whereas in territories like the middle east, there
are 0 taxes.

I would not dismiss lightly Citron's thumbs up to EROS short sell thesis. You never know what additional DD he
