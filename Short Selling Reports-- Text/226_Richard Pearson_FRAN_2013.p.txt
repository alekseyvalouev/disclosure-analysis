Francesca's: Investors In For Nasty Surprise Next Week
Aug. 28, 2013 9:30 AM ET33 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Investment overview


After releasing results that were actually in line with expectations last quarter, shares of
Francesca's Holdings (NASDAQ:FRAN) have now declined by around 25%. Following last
quarter, management had hoped that aggressive promotions and discounting were
coming to an end. But an analysis of these promotions shows that they have actually
accelerated rather than declined. Given the premium valuation, a "miss" at Francesca's is
likely to have a very dramatic effect on the share price. Francesca's comps Abercrombie &
Fitch (NYSE:ANF) along with Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO) both showed one-day drops of
around 20% based on very tiny misses announced in the past two weeks. As shown
below, a miss by Francesca's is now almost a certainty and will likely take the stock down
to the $16-19 level.


Background


For much of its life as a public company, Francesca's has been a Wall Street darling. The
stock has commanded a notably premium price due to the company's ability to
consistently deliver both blistering double digit growth along with dramatically outsized
margins of nearly 60%.


Heading into last quarter, the stock was clearly priced for continued perfection, trading up
to around $32.00. By this time, it was clear that delivering on high expectations was not
enough. Additional "surprises" had become fully expected, and this would be necessary to
support the share price.


In actuality, Francesca's did not even disappoint. Revenues were $79 million vs.
expectations of $79.6 million. Net income was $10.9 million, just in line with expectations.


Yet despite the "in line" performance, the share price quickly dropped by 10-15% in the
days that followed. Over the subsequent weeks, Francesca's has continued to drop and is
now down by around 25% from its pre-earnings levels.

Some of the more recent weakness has been due to the continued earnings
disappointments from Francesca's peer group.


General retailers such as Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have seen
moderate overall declines. Competitors such as the Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Express
(NYSE:EXPR) have seen declines of 7-10% despite strong results. Even Urban Outfitters
(NASDAQ:URBN) is down for the month, despite very strong results.

The sharpest decliners in the past week or so were Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale,
both of which showed one-day declines of 20% even though their earnings misses were
rather mild. These sharp drops followed the already significant declines which had
occurred over the past 60 days or so (which affected most retailers as a whole).


One thing that has continued to support Francesca's share price from further declines has
been the previous statements from management that:


As it relates to gross margin and the potential promotional cadence, clearly we will
be much less promotional as the weather dynamic subsides…. And as a result, our
merchandise margins should be substantially similar to what they might have been
in the prior year quarter.


The ability to sell without heavy discounting has been of paramount importance in
justifying the lofty share price of Francesca's.


In a research note to investors, JPMorgan stated that the "Secret Sauce" for Francesca's
continues to be the fact that the markdown rate is "less than 10%." According to
JPMorgan, "This compares to other mall based retailers that have 3-6 month lead times
and buy much deeper and have markdown rates that are north of 30%."


But we can clearly see that this quarter has not been working out according to the hopes
of both management and JPMorgan.

Following the statements on the last conference call, I began making in person visits and
phone calls to a number of Francesca's stores so that I could personally monitor the
progression of the discounting activities.


We can see that management clearly did have every intention of winding down the
discounts.


In some cases, the promotional activities were originally being limited in their scope in a
combination of three ways:


- limited time frame (including 1 day "flash sales")


- limited availability (internet purchases only)


- limited items (discounts apply to select items such as shoes only)


But time has progressed, we can see that each of these limitations has fallen away.


- Short duration sales were repeatedly extended


- Internet only sales were expanded to all in-store locations


- Discounts were offered on all merchandise both via internet and in-stores

Finding an extensive list of these promotions is easy and only requires readers Google the
terms "Francesca's Discounts." They are listed everywhere. Alternatively, visiting a few
Francesca's stores will reveal the same thing.


We can now see that during the last quarter, there were significant sales underway at
almost every point in time.


With the majority of merchandise on sale and for the majority of days of the quarter, it now
becomes mathematically impossible for Francesca's results to deliver the "less than 10%
Secret Sauce" as described by JPMorgan. This is just a simple function of the math
involved.


In general, we can see that the most common sale is the BOGO ("buy one get one") for
50% off.


We can also see other substantial discounts of 30% on a wide variety of items.


In general, for any given purchase made through Francesca's, the discounts have now
accelerated to a point where customers can expect to get from 25-50% off the price.
These discounts have applied to most of the merchandise and on most of the days in the
quarter.


Overall, what we will almost certainly see this quarter is that the discount rate for
Francesca's is coming in at around 25% - right in line with all of the other retail
competitors. The fact that the "Secret Sauce" is no longer working will almost

automatically cause shares of Francesca's to trade more in line with its peers, which
implies a drop from current prices of at least 20-25%.


Christine Day, the former CEO of lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), once clarified the reason
why lululemon never entered the slippery slope of sales and discounts. Once you start
offering these discounts, you are effectively "training" your customers to expect them. It
does not take long before customers will walk in to a store to find items that they like, and
then walk right back out without purchasing them. They quickly learn to just wait for the
sales which they know will be just around the corner.


This is what has now happened to Francesca's. And it really only took one quarter for the
"training" to take full effect. In order to boost sales in Q1, Francesca's ended up "training"
customers to wait for discounts. It is now the case that the use of these discounts is
becoming more of a necessity in order to entice consumers to actually make a purchase.


Anyone who has been to a Francesca's store in the past 2-3 months will know that the
sale and discount signs are now what lure in the customers. There are typically 2-3 large
signs touting the deep discounts in all of the front store windows of any Francesca's. This
is notably different than the situation just 9-12 months ago.


Concerns over same-store sales


The jet fuel behind Francesca's valuation has consisted of two things: stellar margins and
exceptional growth.


The discounts are now having a visible impact on margins and that impact looks set to
worsen. Francesca's margins have a long way to fall before normalizing. Last quarter,
margins fell by 70 bps to around 52%. But margins for virtually every similar competitor sit
somewhere around 32-38% - as much as 20% lower than Francesca's. Francesca's
margins have declined from closer to 60% and continue to converge with those of the
competition.


But the second part of this equation (growth) has also been cause for concern. Last
quarter, Francesca's reported same-store sales growth of just 2%. Revenues showed a
slight decrease (around 10%) vs. the previous quarter, but that decline was in part due to
a 53 week accounting year which boosted Q4.


The real source of Francesca's growth continues to be the opening of new stores. In the
first quarter alone, Francesca opened 56 new boutiques. This takes their planned
boutique base up to 445, putting them at around 50% of their 900 store target.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1661052-francescas-investors-in-for-nasty-surprise-next-week 7/62


The reason for concern here is obvious. It should be expected that opening new stores will
add to revenues. But the complete stagnation of revenues from existing stores is highly
problematic. Investors are aware that many of these stores were the result of the recent
expansion and have been opened just recently. Yet within two years, they are already
showing same-store growth which is dwindling towards zero.


If we look closer, the tiny 2% growth in same-store sales actually now includes the "direct
sales" which come via the website. If we strip out those sales, then the performance of
existing stores is actually showing almost no growth whatsoever.


If the stock were on a more normalized valuation, the impact of this trend might not be too
severe. But with Francesca's still trading on a PE of around 22-24x, the stock could easily
come down by 20-25% just due to the downtick in same-store sales alone.


Management has already given guidance that same-store sales is set to decrease even
further to just 1-2%. Depending on the impact of direct sales, this could then actually be
implying slight declines in same-store sales. This is a very challenging result for investors
to digest for stores which have now only been open for around 2 years.


It is even more difficult to digest with Francesca's still trading on one of the highest
multiples in the space.


Now it becomes very clear what is happening. Management is trying to juggle margin
pressure vs. declining same-store sales growth. The only way to maintain any positive
growth in SSS is to continue offering deeper discounts to lure in the shoppers.


With SSS quickly approaching zero, there is clearly more wiggle room with margins. As a
result, the discounts and promotions have accelerated substantially.


Two years ago, same-store sales were hitting 15%. One year ago, they were still hitting
10%. Now they are basically hitting zero.


It is now becoming clear to investors that no one (including Francesca's) has a sustainable
"secret sauce" which allows them to a) sell with abnormally high margins while b) growing
sales at a lightening clip. In the end, investors are coming to terms with the fact that
Francesca's is just another retailer which must cut prices (and margins) in order to
maintain traffic.


With almost 450 stores, it is now the case that each store is only doing about $60,000 per
month in revenues - only about $2,000 per day. Francesca's continues to invest heavily in
new stores to grow revenues by this incremental $2,000 per day, but the existing stores

are flattening out so quickly that there is very little room for any meaningful organic growth
for the company.


Short interest reveals longer-term concerns over margins


Anyone who follows Francesca's is likely aware that it has been one of the most heavily
shorted stocks on any US exchange. Total short interest has typically ranged from 30-40%
of total shares outstanding. It is huge. At times, the value of the short bet has exceeded
$600 million, indicating that it's institutions that have taken a deeply held view to the
negative side.


Heading into earnings last quarter, the stock was rising strongly, briefly hitting $32.00. At
that time, the short bets increased dramatically to over 14 million shares. The large short
bets have paid off for those investors. With the stock now down by 25%, the short interest
has fallen off a bit. But even with the stock now down by around 25%, the short has
stayed stubbornly high. Despite the gains already banked, the shorts continue to bet on a
much steeper decline than the 20-25% expected by an earnings miss next week.


Some of the larger concerns have already been touched upon by various articles in both
Barron's, Seeking Alpha and other locations. But each of these articles only raised their
own general concerns without actually delivering a conclusion.


Underlying various short theories is the fact that Francesca's largest suppliers have been
owned by family members of the founding management of Francesca's. These suppliers
have supplied roughly 20-25% of total inventory. But Francesca's has declined to disclose
the purchase terms or margins of the products that it gets from these sources. It has
disclosed that its suppliers are responsible for the ability to generate Francesca's ultra fast
turnaround time of just 4-6 weeks.


The suppliers involved are KJK Trading and Stony Leather. In total, around 20-25% of
Francesca's purchases had come from these two suppliers. With KJK, it is clear that the
company does not even have a single other customer aside from Francesca's.


The supplier only does business with Francesca's and no one else. KJK even operates
out of the same building as Francesca's in Houston. Prior to the IPO, KJK did not even
pay rent to Francesca's for the space. Following the IPO, a token rent of $1,000 was set. If
we look further, we can see that Francesca's discloses that it does not even maintain
supply contracts with these suppliers.

KJK has been owned and run by Ki Juing Gu. Mr. Gu is the brother-in-law of Ms. Insuk
Koo, a founder of Francesca's as well as Kyong Gill, founder and former EVC of
Francesca's. Mr. Gu also owns KKGM,which also supplies to Francesca's. Like KJK,
KKGM does not have any other customers other than Francesca's. It is basically a captive
supplier.


These are the details which Barron's and other Seeking Alpha articles failed to
uncover.


So then KJK is owned by a relative. It does no business with anyone other than
Francesca's and it even operates out of the same building as Francesca's. The parties
see no need to maintain supply contracts.


Based on these facts, it feels very much like a de facto subsidiary.


Likewise, with Stony Leather, the company discloses that:


Chong Yi and Insuk Koo (two of the four Founders) own and operate Stony. Mr. Yi
and Ms. Koo are brother and sister. Mr. Yi and Ms. Koo along with their sister Ms.
Kyong Gill (our Executive Vice Chairperson and one of the four Founders) are
stockholders of Francesca's. Our relationship with Stony is that of an independent
third-party vendor.


(NOTE TO READERS: Gu and Koo are two different English ways of spelling the same
exact name in Korean. These different spellings refer to the same last name which
belongs to these members of the same family.)


For most businesses, such a contrived effort to maintain separate ownership would make
no sense. However, there are certain benefits and activities which are only possible via a
separate relationship (non subsidiary) such as this.


The shorts are well aware that this type of relationship persisted for a few years. During
this time, Francesca's commanded a premium valuation.


Given that management was less than half way into a massive expansion up to 900
stores, many have felt that it was notably odd timing for management to exit the company
in the past year.


Following their resignation from Francesca's, the family's involvement is now strictly with
the suppliers to Francesca's, rather than with Francesca's itself.

Theory number one is that this arrangement has allowed Francesca's to import goods
without declaring full value to customs. Francesca's could thereby obtain its goods at a
much lower cost, boosting margins.


For the past year, KJK has bought 100% of its goods from a single supplier, Shen Li
Wang. (Customs records are included as Appendix I).


Once again, Shen Li Wang appears to have almost no customers other than KJK and
KKGM. KKGM also supplies to Francesca's, and is also owned by brother-in-law Gu.


Again, KJK supplies to just one company, Francesca's. In addition, KJK itself has just a
single supplier, Shen Li Wang. And 95% of Shen Li Wang's business over the past two
years has been with just two customers, KJK and KKGM. Both of these companies supply
only to Francesca's and both are owned by Mr. Gu, the brother-in-law of the founder of
Francesca's (Kyong Gill).


Likewise, Stony is run by the brother and sister of Ms. Gill.


Given that ownership is held exclusively by the brother-in-law of Francesca's founder and
has no actual customers other than Francesca's, it raises the question of why this
company needs to give the appearance of operating as a freestanding company. Why not
just call them what they are - "subsidiaries?"


Clearly a publicly listed company such as Francesca's would never under-declare the
value of imported goods to customs. They would simply have too much to lose and the
consequences would be permanent.


But if its "separate" supplier were found to have under reported, there would be no
consequences to Francesca's. The supplier would simply shut down and then reopen
using a different name, continuing to supply to Francesca's. Since no one knows the
ultimate location of the factories in China, there would be no way for anyone to claim that
this was an identical company.


So far, this is just a theory among shorts and it is one of the reasons which explains the
huge and persistent short interest in Francesca's. The bet is either that the scheme will
unravel or else it will simply come to an end, now that the family members are no longer
part of Francesca's.


Some of this theory has been supported with the difficulty in actually finding a permanent
factory location for anything connected with ultimate sole supplier Shen Li Wang. It is also
supported by the fact that the name of the supplier to KJK seems to change dramatically

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1661052-francescas-investors-in-for-nasty-surprise-next-week 11/62


after 2 years. This can be seen in the customs records in Appendix I.


Theory number two is that the several suppliers from above (which are owned by family
members) have simply been passing the goods on to Francesca's without making a profit
themselves. This is clearly not sustainable.


The reason for engaging in this practice would be what is knows as "multiple arbitrage."
The suppliers are private companies. A profit of $1,000 is just that, a benefit of $1,000. But
Francesca's is a publicly traded company which trades on a high PE of 25-30x. As a
result, a incremental profit of $1,000 results in a real incremental benefit of
$25,000-$30,000.


By posting spectacular margins for the two years since coming public, founders of
Francesca's caused the stock to trade at a premium price. Now that several years have
passed as a public company, the founders are left owning little to no stock and have
resigned from their positions at the company.


Now that they are gone, margins have been coming steadily down and are approaching
those of other competitors in the business.


In the end, it doesn't really matter WHY Francesca's had constructed the contrived
"independent" relationship with its suppliers. What really matters to the shorts is that the
relationships are clearly controlled by family members who had every incentive to provide
Francesca's with unsustainable, non-market prices in order to help margins.


The real "secret sauce" for Francesca's has come from its ability to obtain goods at such a
low cost that it can maintain gross margins of 50-60% while obtaining 4-6 week
turnaround times. The suppliers are the actual secret sauce.


Yet in the years that followed the IPO (and while the founders were still involved at
Francesca's), these suppliers refused to do business with anyone other than Francesca's.
This was the case even though they had no supply contract with Francesca's to ensure
future business OR to prevent the suppliers from doing business elsewhere.


The founding family management has left Francesca's and no longer has any meaningful
equity stake in Francesca's. Instead, they now have a stake in the suppliers.


But what it really comes down to is the fact that Francesca's has somehow been able to
achieve spectacular margins of 50-60% in a business where every other competitor
seems to come in at a nearly identical 32-38%.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1661052-francescas-investors-in-for-nasty-surprise-next-week 12/62


It is also the case that Francesca's has historically obtained a large portion of the goods it
sells from family members who engage in no other business other than selling to
Francesca's through their small private companies.


Now that the founding management family has left Francesca's, we have begun to see
consecutive quarters of margin contraction.


As shown above, this margin contraction is also suffering from the demand side of the
equation, with Francesca's cutting prices at an accelerating rate in order to maintain
same-store sales growth.


The factors all point to the same conclusion: that Francesca's does not have the "secret
sauce" to maintain huge margins and spectacular growth.


This is almost certain to make itself apparent on Francesca's earnings call next week and
the stock will almost certainly take note.


Meeting expectations last quarter led to a 25% decline in the stock price. The only thing
supporting the stock at current levels is the hope which was communicated by
management that the use of discounts would be declining in this quarter, helping to
support margins. But once we see that discounts have actually increased, we can be
almost assured that Francesca's will by default miss earnings.


Appendix I - Customs Records for Francesca's Suppliers


The following table shows all imports into the United States from Shen Li Wang Ltd over
the past two years. More than 95% of the imports are to just two companies (KJK and
KKGM) both of which are controlled by Mr. Gu, and both of which supply only to
Francesca's.

Disclosure: I am short FRAN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Nice article and well written but obviously spun by someone who is short the stock. As someone who is long FRAN,
let me spin the other way on a few key points. First, the information on the advertisements on discount items is
interesting but not the issue. The bigger issue is the total check of the customer when she leaves the store. If the
customer buys one discounted item and 3 full priced items, I think it is a winning strategy. If the custoemr only buys a
discounted item, it is a losing strategy. Only the quarterly numbers will give us the answer of which is occuring. Also,
the author fails to consider the stocking of the discounted items. If FRAN only has a few discounted items and the ad.
lures customers to the store, how is that a bad thing? The author fails to consider the stocking units of discounted
items. Second, contrary to the authors statement, yesterday the short figures came out on FRAN and they actually
decreased by 13%, not increased. Also, for the author to say the shorts have made a killing since the stock was at
$32 and now it is $24 is short sighted. Shorts, like longs, average their pricing. The shares were not shorted
exclusively at $24 or $32. Watch a chart long enough and there will always be a period of time of when longs and
shorts win. The trick is timing and determining volatility in the share price, an almost impossible task. Lastly, the
author spends a lot of space writing about the vendors. A short calls a lack of multiple vendors concerning. I call it
exclusivety. I watch the website closely for comments and no one has complained about quality of FRAN's products.
As long as the quality of goods remains strong, I want exclusivety. I do not want a price war with my competition that
carries the same products. Plus the division of the suppliers and current management is a good thing. Current
management is not bound by family ties to the business relationship. They must use one supplier becuase of the
quality and price along with the exclusivety. I would be more concerned if they changed suppliers, not keeping the
current ones. Comments?

If you have been monitoring the store on a regular basis you will see for a very large part of q2 fran had a buy
one get on at 50% of sale on ALL clothing in the store including new items. this part of the sale was extended
several times and actually just ended on aug 12th. fran also had 30% off on all handbags online and in store
among several other promotions that went on for a significant period of time and was extended a couple of
times. fran's business model is based on deep and shallow marketing and like LULU scarcity place a big role
in their ability to have a 90% sell through rate. to quote christine day ceo of LULU "we achieved our comps
with not having to buy them with promotions, which would have HARMED our brand". the take away from
these sales is fran is selling new merchandise that is supposed to be scarce at a 25% discount when you take
into account the long time frame of the bogo 50% off sale, not to mention the ongoing jewelry buy 2 get the
third one free sale, they are clearly harming their business model and demonstrating that the broad and
shallow marketing concept is not working and deteriorating rapidly.


lastly i have to respectfully disagree with you regarding the kjk relationship. FRAN has been reliant on kjk as a
supplier (contrary to fran saying "we are not dependent on any one vendor) 25-30% of all apparel in fran's
stores comes from kjk and kjk gets 100% of its imports from a company called shenliwang that has no other
customers in the USA other than a company located in los angeles ca 
called kkgm which is owned by Kijuing gu, who also is the owner of kjk. as a side note kkgm has only one
customer, when we contacted them they told us that their only customer was FRAN. the last time we checked
was 4 months ago, kkgm also has only one supplier that it imports from and of course that is kjk. family
member or not i don't think is a huge difference, my main concern if i was long fran would be the company
that has been responsible for supplying 25-30% of all the apparel in the stores comes from 1 source who
imports from only one source who does not do business with anyone else. fran does not have any agreement
or contract with kjk despite the fact they had tremendous leverage to require kjk to sign some type of contract
and or non compete. fran is a billion dollar public company, kjk is a small company who is reliant on fran for
100% of their business and fran even allows them to work from their facility for a nominal 1000 dollars a
month. 
if kjk is truly an "independent vendor" given the incredible success (90%sell through vs 70% for industry) and
industry leading margins and turn around time fran has gotten from kjk's product it would be naive to think kjk
will not have every competitor of fran's banging down their door to do business. these competitors do 8-20
times the business fran does and can offer kjk much more business. according to fran's last 10k the
ownership of kjk seems to have changed, instead of kjk being OWNED AND OPERATED BY Kijuing gu it is
now owned by certain member of the founding family. if these well capitalized (200 million plus dollars from
their sale of fran) entrepreneurs bought into kjk and their only intention was to rely on fran to grow the
business then that would make no sense and raise additional concerns. lastly we did and an exhaustive
search using shenliwangs addresses supplied to customs and we employed investigators to try to locate
them, we were unsuccessful.

I am wondering why the author of the piece is named Richard Pearson but "barryg" responded to my posting?
Hmmm.....nevermind. 
Barryg did not respond to my issue with the original authors failure to address the average sales ticket at

FRAN and only address the sales merch. I would ask either person - how do you know that FRAN does not
have a non-compete or any other contract with KJK? You sent investigators to look for a company in a foreign
country? You are kidding, right? Your investigators looked in China and concluded what? That the company
doesn't exist? Shocking how a company that doesn't exist and ship millions of dollars to the US each year
without any significant delays or misses and yet be invisible to training foreign investigators. RP and BarryG -
you are determined to justify your stock position in FRAN by inventing conspiracies and seeing ghosts.
Investors in FRAN should be encouraged by the free cash flow, the lack of any debt and the accelerating
growth of opening new stores. Investors in FRAN should be concerned about the SSS growth in mature
stores. Management seems capable of achieving their growth model by opening new stores. Saturation may
become an issue in the near future. When considering investing in a stock, I always ask myself the question -
what is more likely - a 20% rise or a 20% decline in the stock? Lets say FRAN is at $24. Is the next 8 point
swing going to be up or down. I don't see FRAN going to 16. Breaking thru the 52 week low is a rising
ecomony with a company with large growth and no debt? Highly unlikely. How about FRAN going to $32?
This would place FRAN at the 52 week high and well short of the all-time high of $37. Makes sense from a
technical perspective. Possible M&A activity discussed in an article today could only be positive. There is a
big overhang from the secondary offering done earlier this year. I would say $22 - $26 is equally likely
dependent on the earnings report. $32 is way more likely in the long run than $16 if the economy continues
on its present course. Remember, a rising tide lisfts all boats. Stocks with the free cash flow of FRAN without
any debt rarely breaks thru technical lows in a rising market

i'm sorry, i wasn't aware that other people besides the author were allowed to respond and voice their views.
yes i do have investigators in hk and china that i have been using for years that assist me in my due
diligence, is that something you do not feel is a prudent thing to do? i am not creating any conspiracy theories
i am just stating facts, i am not saying there is not a corporate entity registered in hong kong called
shenliwang,i am saying we had competent investigators that are used by many large firms to try and locate
shenliwang in hk and in china, the address's listed on the customs documents did not belong to a company
called shenliwang and searches of business directories did not turn up a company that goes by the name
shenliwang that did business with kjk. there is no conspiracy these are simply the facts. of course there is an
entity that is shipping kjk merchandise that is being sold to francescas, i am not questioning wether fran does
the revenue that they report they do and i am not questioning the fact fran buys 13% of their inventory which
makes up between 25-30% of all the apparel sold from kjk. the statement that kjk has bought 100% of
everything they have imported into the USA in the last 12 months from 1 source and that source is
shenliwang,it is also a fact that 99% of everything shenliwang has imported into the USA in the last 24
months has been primarily to kjk with the rest going to a company called kkgm which is owned by kijuing gu
the same owner as kjk. if you spend a few bucks and do some quick research you will see it for yourself. i
unlike mr pearson am not forcasting a price for fran i am simply stating a few facts that wall street has been
troubled by for quiet sometime (the very large short interest shows you that). the only new information i am
bringing up is something every wall street analyst who follows fran has missed and that is that kjk that has
only 1 customer (fran) and sells them 25-30% of all their apparel buys 100% of their imported merchandise
from a company that only does business with one customer in the usa and that in itself is risky. when you add

in the fact that fran HAS NO CONTRACT with kjk all i am saying is it makes no business sense and is
illogical, i would be concerned about this whole arrangement if i was long the stock. 
at first i thought i was reading your response to me incorrectly, for you to have to ask the question "how do i
know that fran has no non compete or other contracts with kjk"? is a bit of a ridiculous question, i did not need
investigators for this and i did not have to do much research to know they have no contract. you seem like a
fairly bright person and you also seem to be pretty confident in your thesis on Francesca's and where the
stock price is going. since you seem fairly bright (just because we have different views does not make either
one of us less intelligent.)i have to assume you accidentally asked me that question or you forgot that when
you read frans last 2 10k's they clearly state "we do not have any contracts with any of our vendors". i believe
what fran is saying in their regulatory filings they are being honest, if you have information to the contrary i
would be eager for you to share it with us. I hope that i am right when i say you must have forgotten about
when you read the last 2 10k's fran filed, i can't imagine someone who write with such authority on fran and is
so quick to accuse me of making up conspiracy theories and finds it so hard to comprehend that it is prudent
business to use investigators to verify things half way around the world would be so negligent as to not have
bothered to do securities research 101 and not have read the 10k. you can not get anymore basic than that. i
hope i was able to answer your questions and my information is a little clearer to you now. i am sorry mr
pearson has disappointed you and not addressed your comments, maybe he will address us both and have
something to add.

Hi Barryg. We certainly do have different ideas of doing research on companies. I don't read 10ks on
companies except to review the financials and determine the trends QtoQ and YoverY. IMHO, getting bogged
down in the details can be distracting from the larger picture. I invest accordingly to the following criteria. I
want a company that is exclusive or dominants the target market. I want a company with high, sustained and
preferably accelerated growth. I want a company with lots of free cash flow and no debt. I also want a
company with visible loud vocal customers that love the product. Lastly, I want to see the product and use it
myself or can at least observe others using it. So far, I have found 5 companies that fit my criteria and FRAN
is one. If the SSS doesnt improve next quarter, it is likely it will fall off my radar. I travel around the US going
into these companies and talking to the employes and customers. I observe what they buy and how much.
Never ever underestimate customer loyalty. Few companies get it but when they do. . they are unstoppable
(AAPL, LULU) I have seen a company yet that meets these criteria but fails because of micro disclosures in a
10k. Do you own SIRI? I do. . it fits my criteria well. Do you own LULU? I do. I also own HSNI. And
shockingly, I have read the print in any of their 10ks. I've read the financials. I've talk to their employees, I've
talk to their clients. and I have bought their products and love all of them. Lastly, a bonus to owning these
companies and several others is the price volatility. If you look at the charts for these companies, they are
quite volatile. I try to determine the best entry point and then, after a run of 10%, I sell covered calls against
the position, usually out about 4-6 weeks. the premium alone is usually close to 10%. For example, I own
FRAN and 23 1/2 and I sold the Sept. $25 yesterday for $1.50. Regardless of what happens when the
earnings come out, I will be happy. Either I get a 15% positive return or I have a cost basis of $22. I'm fine
with either one. I'm in the market to make money, not perform a pathological autopsy on a company. I don't
hold stocks long and I am disciplined in my evaluations. I don't lose the forest thru the trees. Best of luck

we certainly do invest very differently. as someone who has successfully run a relativity small fund for the past
23 years that is very short biased 80/20 short to long ratio, i do not use the companies financial in a
meaningful way but i do read every pubic filing that the company makes. you would have a hard time finding
any professional PM that does not fully read the 10k of a company they are either long or short you are
without a doubt in the minority, but their are many successful investment strategies and it sounds like yours is
working for you. i invest strictly based on in depth research which includes everything including reading public
filings, speaking to current and former employees (i do not meet with a companies current top management) i
speak to customers, vendors, industry experts (production and sourcing experts would be an example),we
monitor a fair sized sample of stores in the case of fran and not only check traffic but we look at the product
and see who is supplying it. we use several other tools obviously but that is just a snapshot of what we do. i
do not look at charts and i do not use an option strategy but we do use derivatives when we feel it is
appropriate. again i am by no means the top performing or smartest investor in the world and who am i to
question someone else's successful investing strategy. 
you will see in my comments i do not have anything negative to sat about fran's store's in regard to the
shopping experience they give to customer's. we have found their stores to be clean, fairly well merchandised
(they are no lulu but then again nobody is) and the staff for the most part has been pleasant. for the purpose
of these discussions you and i have been having my main focus is on the supply chain i think that buying
25%-30% of all clothing from what source who you have no contract or legal agreement with is not a good
idea. i further am concerned about the relationship they have with kjk because it simply makes no business
sense at all. if your main supplier is so reliant on you (kjk has no other customers and they do not even have
their own facility it is pretty much given them to fran (yes i read the 10k kjk pays 1000 per month), why
wouldn't fran lock in this supplier who based on fran's numbers shows kjk is a very good and unique source
and they are some what reliant on them. if kjk was so easy to replace why not cut your reliance in them by 30-

40% ? 
i am a bit surprised you do not find it a bit risky and unusual that kjk who has only one customer has bought
100% of all of their imports from just one SMALL COMPANY, we know that because the customs records
don't lie and shenliwang wherever they might be has only 1 customer in the usa. to take that one step further
maybe this next fact will give you reason for pause. stony leather/stony jewelry fran's second largest supplier
which as you know is also owned by members of the founding family (there is absolutely nothing wrong with
this and plays no role in us being short the stock) has imported gotten 100% of all their imports from one
company called max k, max k is a small manufacturer, we have visited the companies facility in china. max k
just so happens to only import to stony leather/jewelry. if you don't find this information about the supply chain
a bit concerning and something that you should look into or perhaps ask the company on the upcoming
conference call (i will try but i have a funny feeling the call will be no different from the last 4 calls and they will
only be taking questions from sell side analyst) i should also mention max k is owned and founded by kijuing
gu and his family. the investigators who you find it so hard to believe be actually use have supplied me with
max k's annual report (private company, public document) max k used to be called stony jewelry, they
changed their name but not ownership several years ago. it is odd that it was never disclosed when they
spoke about kijuing gu also was never disclosed tha gu owns another fran supplier kkgm in los angeles ca
that is shenliwangs only other customer and of course kkgm's sole source of imports and of course kkgm's
only customer is fran. its a very complicated story and one that raises a lot of red flags, 99 times out of a 100
when you see something like this, there are some bad things going on. all that being said i can not prove fran
is doing anything improper but it does seem very curious that kjk is not a wholly owned subsidiary of frans. if
kjk was doing something wrong like cheating on their import taxes, it would be very covienant for fran to be
able to say "we had no idea".


still i do have to give fran credit for building a nice little company in a very short time, using a unique business
model and they offer a product that has gotten them a nice fan base. wether they continue to succeed is
definitely an unknown,it is obvious what my opinion is.


thanks for engaging in a professional dialog and hopefully we have shown other investors to fair arguments of
the risks and rewards in owning frans stock. i apologize for the very long replies but it is a very hard story to
tell. if you want to send me a private message i would be happy to share some documents that we recieved
through investigators you seem skeptical of using them maybe it would be interesting for you to see some of
the things they are able to do, it could help you in determining wether you wan't to try using them to assist on
future investments.

Hi BarryG. Thank you for your posting. From what you have said, you like the stores, you like the
management, and you don't look at the financials. Are you shorting the stock simply because you think that is
an unusual and potentially harmful issue with FRANs suppliers though the relationship with the suppliers has
not changed since the company was founded? This certainly sounds like a reason to curious. You have made
me curious. But I don't think this curiosity is a reason to accept unlimited risk by shorting the stock. Let's say
everything you suspect is true. What do you think is going to happen? Is another company going to approach
kjk with more business on an exclusivity deal and kjk is going to dump FRAN? What is the realistic danger? I

User 12193101
The supplier situation for FRAN certainly does seem questionable. Behavioral psychology has shown that people will
generally cheat a little bit when possible, and this seems like just such a situation. However, now that the company is
becoming separated from the founders, they may right their course over time. Even if there is nothing shady going on,
a well-run company should avoid even the appearance of impropriety. I was considering a small investment in FRAN
at these lower levels, but now I think it’s best to take a wait-and-see attitude on this one. Thanks.


28 Aug 2013, 10:59 AM


user432133
Good thesis, but late to the game in my opinion. ANF and ARO shares tumbled post-earnings because they genuinely
caught the street by surprise. ARO shares consistently traded between $13 and $15 months prior to the
announcement (compared to $8.50 range today) and ANF shares traded between $44 and $50 prior (vs $36 range
today). These 2 names essentially took a 20%~40% beating after posting surprise weak earnings.


FRAN shares on the other hand have been declining from $30 down to $23 prior to the earnings announcement (23%
drop); I think most of the negatives cited by the author (discounting, weak macro) have been reflected by the shares.
Considering that FRAN actually has room for real estate expansion, I actually think the street might give them a pass
because EPS should continue to grow.


28 Aug 2013, 11:23 AM


apacheman15
I disagree that the price will tumble. The stock has dropped much and is being priced for a doomsday scenario. Any
surprise or even meet on earnings will cause the stock to spike up. The market will shrug off any bad news since that
is already priced into the stock. The fact remains that earnings are still growing rapidly and they are opening stores at
a fast clip. If I was buying a business, those are traits I'd be looking for.

What if the weather was very conducive to shopping, giving SSS an unexpected boost?


What if I don't care that they have 100% control over a portion of their supply chain? I do really, as you say, it adds to
their retail margins.


What if their "stock it thin and turn it quick" continues to work well? 
When the company buyers buy a dog, they don't have a million pieces to move, and a great item can be ordered

To what extent do you feel that these issues are already priced in? It would appear to me as if, unlike your other
examples of companies with large drops after earnings misses, that the stock has already taken the hit.


29 Aug 2013, 09:44 AM


sandman963
IMHO, everything that is public information is already priced into every stock. The key to determining in which
direction a stock is heading in the future is to extrapolate trends in the company and the economy. I truly
believe in some market cliches such as don't fight the tape, dont try a catch a falling knife, the trend is your
friend, and a rising tide lifts all boats. FRAN has a wacky chart. The chart certainly can not be an indicator of
a probable direction. I think that retail economy is a better indicator. Again, this is not probable in either
direction. Therefore, if i were to own the stock, which i do, I would own the stock and sell at the money calls
for a significant premium.

Weak short reasonings: 
1. Discounts are a great thing for FRAN, as that's their lure. There will always be people willing to buy the full price
items to make sure no one else buys it first. 
2. Supplier with 25% is no big deal, there's still 75% they can do business with. 
3. Gross margins are less than ANN and CHS. FRAN's high margins mainly come from operating margins with their
tiny stores. 
4. The store counts will just keep increasing, as well as sales and profits, you shorts are in a world of hurt. Thank you
in advance for giving me your money.

Hi Berto,


One thing to consider...an author's single article is very unlikely to actually affect a company' stock prices...In
all probability, the only people that see these articles are those that have strong convictions about the
company one way or another. If a short author's article should actually affect the stock prices, it is highly
probable there were underlying concerns by the people reading the article, AND, the stock had to be thinly
traded for a very few people to drive the stock at their whim. You might be attributing too much power to those
that publish. As you saw via the rest of the responders, yourself included, the article pinpointed some areas
that could be problematic going forward...


As the old saying goes "bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered"! Maybe the best
translation is that due diligence is prerequisite to successful investing.


Good luck,

I am surprised some hardcore longs didn't listen to this well written article. They tried to argue 25% vendor

also related. So, at the end, the vendor concentration is much more than 25%.

Good call by the author, stock is getting pounded. At this point, I'm going to hold my existing shares. I still think there
is value in the name. Hopefully, they are being overly conservative in their guidance. The $100 million buyback
announced currently represents about 12.5% of the outstanding shares. But it's certainly hard to make a real strong
case for the stock. I think I'm going back to index investing!!!!!

If their goal was to make me buy more shares by announcing a buyback, it worked! I purchased some more
shares yesterday at $17.85. Was yesterday's earnings report and outlook bad? Absolutely. But I don't think it
merited a 25% drop. Especially, since its been dropping precipitously from above $30. The earnings were still
up almost 18% from the same quarter last year. In the call, the EPS outlook does not take into account the
increase per share as the buyback is put into place "immediately". Assuming that they fulfill the $100 million
buyback, that will automatically increase the EPS by about another 9-13% ( depending at what prices are
paid in the buyback). Numerous retail analysts that I've been watching are saying that things seemed to be
picking up in the last part of August. Apparel retail ( and especially the teen segment) is historically extremely
volatile. I still think the long term story for FRAN is intact and patient investors will be rewarded.

store and on line ALL CLOTHING bogo 50% off, 30% OFF ALL HANDBAGS) and you could only come up with one
logical conclusion, the broad and shallow marketing is not working. if your secret sauce is scarcity and a 90% sell
through(look at managements comments from q1) you can only conclude it s mathematically impossible to achieve
90%. add to that if they only get 5 units of a style and business is good why give away dollar bills for .75 cents? 
the supply chain is a whole different and more research intensive issue, and one i don't think we have even come
close to seeing just how problematic it will end up being. fran has an unsustainable business model and gross
margins have not come close to where they will be in the next 12 months. there are so many red flags still present
that i would not want to initiate a long position at these levels (i did cover a fair amount of my short). 
it's nice to see your research be right, but not fun to see anyone lose money. my list of loser's (especially the last 12
months) is not exactly scarce.

user432133
barry, first I want to congratulate you on the call. I'm just here to present an opposing point of view. My investment
style looks for beaten down stocks with fixable problems, then I allow current management time to gradually improve
core operations and hopefully the stock price will take care of itself over time.


In my view, FRAN's problems are very fixable. The supply chain issues can be resolved by diversifying suppliers. The
strategy of selling limited SKUs I view as a strength and not a weakness. This strategy essentially help make Urban
Outfitters/Anthropologie. IF the supply chain issues are resolved, FRAN will likely have a lower structural margin (who
knows if KJK/Stony were indeed giving them favorable treatment).


If we assume that yes, FRAN's margins are way too high at 26% EBIT and it will eventually drop to the high-teens
level (for arguments sake, let's just say 17%), then instead of $1.10~$1.16 guided from management the company's
true earnings power is actually around $0.80 EPS.


However, this $0.80 EPS earnings power is slated to grow 20% a year...just applying a 1x PEG would get to a $16
base value, and over time as the EPS grows to roughly $1.50 in the next few years I can see the shares trade in the
$30s. At $17 and change current price, I think the stock has more upside than down side...I would like to see the price
stabilize a bit before putting in a full position.

Your estimates about FRAN's growth rate is too optimistic. 20% is not a sustainable growth rate for FRAN.
FRAN's stores, in my opinion, is saturated. It gets the point that it cannot grow the store count without
sacrificing comps.


05 Sep 2013, 09:10 AM


user432133
Disagree.


Claires is an accessory shop with similar store size has 3300 stores world wide (1600 of which in the US).


Name brands like Chicos, Banana Republic, Victoria Secrets all have roughly 600 stores nation-wide, but
their stores are about 10x the size of a Francescas. For FRAN to have the same square footage as the big
guys they have to sustain a 20% growth rate at around 14 years.


Similar operations such as Forever 21 generated $3.1 billion in sales in 2011, compared to ~$350 million for
FRAN guided for this year.


Heck, FRAN can open a store in every single college town and that would be more than 900. How are you
reaching your conclusion?


I'm not saying FRAN will reach the level of any of the winners mentioned, but I definitely disagree with the
thought that 450 stores = saturated.


05 Sep 2013, 10:21 AM


Stan Ackman, Contributor
FRAN can choose to open store in every college town, but many of these stores will not have as high
productivity level as current stores. At the end, it drags down profitability. This is a very basic concept in retail.
You simply should not say its store count is not saturated just because it has reached every single town yet.


05 Sep 2013, 10:53 AM


user432133
"You simply should not say its store count is not saturated just because it has reached every single town yet."


You know what else is a basic concept of retail? Expansion opportunities are inversely related geographical
penetration. The fact that they're not in all the towns means they have room for growth WITHOUT the risk of
cannibalization...cont... to your belief.


Once again, I'm going to try to use factual support.


If you look at ARO, AEO, ANF (back in the glory days). They achieved peak profitability with EBIT margins of 13%,
21%, and 20% when they reached 1000 stores. These stores are also 9000 ~12000 sq ft compared to 1300 sq ft of
Francesca's. If you want a saturation study, those 3 would be very good case studies. Unfortunately, they don't
