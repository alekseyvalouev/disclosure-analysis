Novatel Wireless: A Fundamentally Flawed Business Plan
Feb. 10, 2015 8:00 AM ET33 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Novatel’s biggest revenue generator, MiFi, is fizzling fast amid a shrinking market.
And, consumers are learning they have cheaper, simpler alternatives to MiFi built
into their iPhones.


Novatel’s backup plan, a machine-to-machine corporate service, can’t fill the MiFi
revenue gap. Revenues are miniscule and Novatel will continue to struggle in this
highly competitive arena.


Novatel will open the floodgates in March to millions of insiders’ shares that have
been held back from the market for months.


So, long term, Novatel is saddled with a weak business plan in a highly competitive
market. Near term, it faces the risk of significant insider selling next month.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Novatel Wireless (MIFI) rose from a virtual bodice-ripping, B-grade soap opera star into a
rather proper Wall Street darling in three months, with shares bursting to ~$5.50 for more
than a 78 percent gain.


But while Novatel has recently shed some drama (read the steamy shareholder letter
here), the company remains fundamentally flawed.


The wireless solutions technology provider primarily sells pocket-sized wireless modems
to allow Internet access anywhere and also machine-to-machine modules.


But we don't believe this San Diego, Calif.-based company is likely to return the love
investors have thrown at it recently.


*Why Novatel's biggest revenue generator is unlikely to reach expectations


Novatel is focusing on the MiFi system - a Wifi hot spot provided through a wallet-sized
box that consumers on the go can use to access the Internet with their mobile gadgets.


"They've been doing that for a long time. It's a brutal business. It's always been brutal,"
said a tech analyst who requested anonymity. "The margins are terrible."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2901876-novatel-wireless-a-fundamentally-flawed-business-plan 2/21


In fact, the product produces less than 11 cents to a little over 20 cents for each dollar
sold. The margins improved last quarter - special thanks go to a $2.9 million inventory
write-down and a sale of $2 million in old inventory at near cost.


Indeed, Novatel must hate having a bunch of its obsolete China- and Thailand-made
inventory sitting around. Yet it says "increased competitive pressures" may force more of
these write-downs.


With these historically bad margins and declining revenue grabbing Novatel by the throat,
some leaders wanted to sell the MiFi division last spring, according to sources.


But, of course, the spinoff didn't happen.


*No buyers for MiFi is spooky enough, but there's more


With no other company apparently wanting MiFi, miserable share prices and a poorly
settled class action lawsuit, activist shareholders lobbed a rip-roaring fiery letter, alleging
Novatel had been mismanaged. The company booted executives and directors and
installed new ones, and even replaced its old "NVTL" stock symbol with "MIFI."


Emerging from this soap opera, activist shareholder/interim CEO Alex Mashinsky became
the permanent CEO. Fellow activist shareholder Richard Karp joined him on the board of
directors.


The leadership that emerged from the summer of 2014 bloodbath is now trying to pick up
the sagging MiFi business responsible for nearly 79 percent of Novatel's sales.


But the results have been disappointing.


Last quarter, revenue from MiFi dropped a blistering 59 percent. Yes, compared with a
year ago, MiFi revenue is a whopping $49 million lower. Net losses rose an unspeakable
58 percent to $8.8 million.


Results for the past nine months were slightly worse. So, why did the declines happen?


The company's SEC filings blame "lower sales of mobile broadband devices," and the
M2M result wasn't better due to "decreased sales of embedded products to M2M
customers." This shows customer acceptance problems.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2901876-novatel-wireless-a-fundamentally-flawed-business-plan 3/21


The SEC filings say earlier low sales were "caused by increased market competition at our
largest customer", which is Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and by "lower average sales prices." This
points to the risks - largely beyond the new management's control - of Novatel's reliance
on one customer, as well as the bargain-basement prices caused by waning interest in
Novatel's product.


*Brutal competition, market decline expected


So Novatel is losing the advantage it once enjoyed because it got to the MiFi (or USB
modem dongle) party early. Now, the party is wild and "extremely competitive" - roughly 90
and these include Sony Mobile (NYSE:SNE), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Apple
(NASDAQ:AAPL).


Additionally, this market is falling, according to Strategy Analytics' research.


The mobile broadband modem market fell 17 percent in 2013, and the 2014 decline is
expected to be even worse - a 24 percent drop. Though mobile hotspot routers were
considered the bright point, overall industry sales are predicted to plunge to half of the
2010 levels.


So, Novatel and its market rivals will chase fewer and fewer dollars.


*Most daunting: Hotspot tech is already built in


An analyst, who said he tossed out his MiFi box some time ago, pointed to another major
threat to Novatel.


IPhone and other smartphone owners are beginning to realize that they already have
cheaper, simpler access to hotspots built right into their phones. They don't need Novatel.


So, smartphone users can turn on their phone's hotspot feature to get free Internet access
to their phone, laptop, iPad or other gadgets.


In comparison, the MiFi hotspot costs ~$50-$200, and the carrier charges users about $50
extra per month. Why would customers pay extra for something when they've already got
the feature built-in?


*Competition in the overseas market


With little wiggle room left for MiFi in the US market, Novatel is looking overseas.

"So we want to go from basically 90% of our sales in North America to something less
than 70% of sales. So and to get there, we really need to have some substantial wins in
both Europe and South America and other markets," Mr. Mashinsky told analysts at the
last earnings conference call.


He also noted that "these (overseas) things take a little bit longer both to win and to
deploy." The problem is that major competitors are already digging into the overseas
market.


Strong rivals working in the overseas market include Chinese vendors ZTE Corp.
(OTC:ZTCOY) (OTC:ZTCOF) ($31 billion revenue) and Huawei ($47 billion revenue).
Another US-based public company targeting sales in other countries is Digi International
(NASDAQ:DGII), a company that isn't blowing up the sector, but at least isn't as weak as
Novatel. (Numbers are most recently reported; Digi and Novatel are set to report next
quarter earnings soon.)


Novatel Digi Sierra CalAmp


Cash Flow -$31.9 million +$7.5 million +$48.7 million +$24.3 million


EBITDA -$21 million +$4.7 million +$12.7 million +$30 million


Net Income - - - $4 million


Net Loss -$8.8 million -$0.3 million -$1.7 million -


*And more... Novatel lags behind M2M competitors


Novatel showed a slight increase in machine-to-machine, M2M, revenue last quarter. But
M2M brings in less than 22 percent of the revenue. And this is just too insignificant to
really help declining MiFi sales and poor margins, especially since Novatel appeared too
late and too small.


Much of the M2M market is dominated by Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) (see
financials highlighted in the chart above). Sierra Wireless spun off the equivalent of
Novatel's MiFi business, "AirCard," in 2013 and has been gaining in M2M ever since.
Sierra hyped a $90 million M2M deal last December, spurring the share price 48 percent
to $48. Novatel investors should note how Sierra got ahead of itself as shown by the

fallout when quarterly results released last week failed to live up to the hype. Within hours,
the share price tanked to a more realistic $34 because the market expected far superior
results and guidance here.


Other rivals include Gemalto (OTCPK:GTOFF) (OTCPK:GTOMY), Telit (OTCPK:TTCNF)
and Freescale Semiconductor (NYSE:FSL). Yet another big player is Oxnard, Calif.-based
CalAmp (NASDAQ:CAMP), with diversified products and $11 million in net income last
year.


*Internet of Things competition


Novatel is also eyeing the Internet of Things market. Internet of Things, IoT, connects
devices to address consumer and industrial goods such as smart appliances, smart
watches and smart parking meters.


This is another market targeted by well-funded Sierra Wireless. Less established
companies like Novatel would be hard-pressed to squeeze into this battlefield already
dominated by the likes of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and
others. Intel Corp. just revealed a new platform that makes it easier for companies to use
Intel products when they build smart products.


*Millions of Novatel shares loom; Overhang expires next month


Besides the longer term risks, Novatel's stock faces a challenge in less than 30 days.


Novatel touted a neck-saving ~$23.7 million investment by HC2 Holdings just last
September. Novatel issued 7.4 million shares of its stock for just $1.75 apiece, preferred
stock, plus warrants for 4.1 million shares.


The kicker: Time is almost up on the stock warrants. Beginning March 8, with the right to
exchange the warrants for stock at just $2.26 per share, HC2 can sell any or all of those
4.1 million shares.


At today's share price, selling all those cheap shares would give HC2 about $11 million.
Two HC2 officers were installed on Novatel's board and one would hope they would sell
thoughtfully. But, with the allure of $11 million now versus the uncertainty of tomorrow, it
makes sense to sell.


Indeed, more financial pressures are looming right around the corner. In just two quarters,
Novatel is on track to burn through its $20 million in cash provided by HC2. So, Novatel is
likely to face the uncomfortable decision this year of accessing its revolving loan, other

debt and/or issuing even more potentially dilutive shares of stock.


*Conclusion


Novatel's biggest revenue generator, MiFi, is fizzling against fierce competition in a
shrinking market, plus smartphone owners who use their built-in hotspot feature instead of
Novatel. And, though the company hopes its machine-to-machine service will help fill the
gap, Novatel is way too far behind, undifferentiated and too small to successfully navigate
this highly competitive arena.


With Novatel desperately fighting to overcome a weak business plan - and facing next
month's unlocked cheap shares - we expect the stock to swoon as the drama drains from
this soap opera and the story closes with a dull thud.

The author of this article is short on MIFI without disclosing it. In the article on the page it was disclosed that a short
position was initiated, hence this is an attempt to cash in on short-term volatility that is to be expected on such a small
cap.


If Novatel Wireless managed to increase revenue from IoT to $20m-25 per quarter we are already talking about
$80-$100m in revenue from M2M products. While it its a competitive niche, there are few who actually produce chips
and can deliver businesses a complete range of IoT services. The author fails to disclose how Novatel has managed
to get two established investors onboard that hold over 5% of MIFI. The author also fails to realize that the CEO is

Due to short-selling attempts that are not disclosed by SeekingAlpha MIFI is tanking, which is clear manipulation and
should be inspected by the SEC.

This article (above) by "The Street Sweeper" seems to me to be a biased, unfairly negative view of MIFI, with motives
or intentions that I feel suspicious about. Yesterday morning, when this article was first published, MIFI's stock price
fell about 6% -- which was unusual since MIFI had been holding up pretty well recently during down days in the
general market. Aside from this article about MIFI, there was no news that I saw that would have caused such a large,
sudden price drop.


It is also suspicious to me that "The Street Sweeper" has apparently done something similar before to the company
Questcor. See the press release at this link: http://bit.ly/1z4qxex. The article at this link also suggests that some of the
people involved with "The Street Sweeper" at that time had dubious personal histories that cast doubt on the
"believeability" of "The Street Sweeper" organization.


Another suspicious fact is that "The Street Sweeper" article (above) about MIFI is largely based on a person's
opinions who wishes to remain ANONYMOUS! C'mon! How "believeable" can this person's opinions be if he or she
refuses to let all of us know who he or she is and what degree of credibility (and integrity?) this person's opinions
about MIFI have.


The other major suspicious fact (as they admit at the end of their article) is that "The Street Sweeper" has a financial
interest of a short-selling position in MIFI -- and therefore, logically, WANTS MIFI to fall in price, so that "The Street
Sweeper" organization can make money on its short-selling of MIFI!


And finally (for me and for now), this article by "The Street Sweeper" makes some conclusions that aren't sufficiently
supported by complete and balanced details, by the whole story, and by the POSITIVE facts about MIFI. The above
article has a negative slant, omits important positive factors, and is contradicted by many encouraging facts that I
have recently read elsewhere about MIFI.

Fortunately, in just nine days (on February 19, after the market closes) MIFI will be reporting its Q4 2014 revenues,
earnings, margins, and guidance (with possibly new customers and/or new deals and additional sources of income)
for Q1 2015. Then all of us will be able to evaluate whether MIFI is "turning around" and improving financially. Then
each of us can form our own opinions of MIFI -- and form our own opinions of this article by "The Street Sweeper,"
and decide whether we consider their organization to be "believeable" in their future articles' assertions.


The basic facts to know about MIFI are that it is a company in a "turn around" phase, with mostly new management,
new funding, and a new credit line from Wells Fargo, with good products and major customers, like Verizon, AT&T,
and Sprint, that is very undervalued and sells for only about 1x revenues when SWIR and CAMP sell for around 2x
revenues.


And despite the article by "The Street Sweeper," which is short-selling MIFI, only about 2% of MIFI's outstanding
shares are being shorted (as of January 15, 2015, according to Yahoo Finance). So, apparently, not many other short-
sellers have joined "The Street Sweeper" in short-selling MIFI. Logically, that means "The Street Sweeper" opinion
about MIFI is in a very tiny minority.

As I was typing the above long comment, MIFI's stock price dropped another 10%!


Aside from this article by "The Street Sweeper" being published yesterday, and then re-published today on
Seeking Alpha, there is no news that I have seen to cause (or justify) a two-day, 16% drop in MIFI's stock
price.


To my knowledge, there have been no revisions of MIFI's revenue or earnings estimates by independent
analysts. And there have been no statements by MIFI's management of negative changes in the financial
fundamentals of MIFI.


For these reasons, I agree with oliversk's comments (above) that the SEC should investigate these financially
damaging events to MIFI and their shareholders to see if "The Sweet Sweeper" helped to manipulate a price
drop in MIFI to make money from their short-selling of MIFI.


I also agree with oliversk's comments (above) that Seeking Alpha should not publish articles (and should not
give credibility to) articles that are unbalanced and unfair -- and that seem suspicious as possible attempts to
manipulate vulnerable small-cap stock prices in order to make money.


I request that both the SEC and Seeking Alpha thoroughly investigate "The Street Sweeper's" conduct before
and during the current, suspicious, huge and sudden price drop in MIFI's stock price -- and also thoroughly
investigate "The Street Sweeper"'s history, personnel, and financial associations for possible misconduct.


Seeking Alpha may need to revise its screening and publishing policies to ensure that its website is not
abused for possibly unethical or illegal stock manipulations by anyone publishing on Seeking Alpha.

The Street Sweeper also has contradictory statements on its own page, they state that their code of conducts
prevents them from going short on companies they cover, yet they state in the article they are short. Same in this
SeekingAlpha article. At the top they don't disclose but at the bottom they do.


I believe they have initiated the short position at 5.50 - 5.70 and covered it at the low today. Very nice manipulative
tricks. I could do the same with my finance websites, but they would investigate me immediately. How do they get
away with it?


The stock price matters (refinancing, public image, etc). Short-term volatility is to be expected and I am not surprised
that it went down due to technicals and a little too much hype, but the manipulation in this case was very obvious.


10 Feb 2015, 11:23 AM


oliversk
Going short on a company is morally so uncool, because a share price for example has real consequences:


- Below 5 mark certain funds are not allowed to buy 
- Below 5 mark certain refinancing may be more difficult to obtain  
- etc


Shorting a company can destroy a company that would have been fine if it wasn't for shorts. Shorts can literally
bankrupt a company. In my opinion short-selling should be forbidden, it only destroys value. Yes, shorts can prevent
hype and overblown expectation but they destroy more companies than necessary and even if just 1 company went
bankrupt due to shorts that's 1 too many.


I am going to blacklist The Street Sweeper on my network

oliversk,


I share your feeling of anger and outrage at unfair short-selling manipulations.


The fact that MIFI has recovered almost all of today's sudden, huge sell-off strongly suggests that the one-
sided, unfairly negative accusations by "The Street Sweeper" and short-sellers' "attacks" were unfair and
manipulative.


If it was true that MIFI (Novatel Wireless) is "a fundamentally flawed business," then MIFI's stock price would
have crashed and stayed dead. But the fact that MIFI has recovered so quickly and strongly says to me that
the short-selling "attacks" on MIFI were untrue and unfair!


It angers me that these short-sellers made money in an unfair, harmful way -- and that the SEC (and maybe
Seeking Alpha) will most likely do nothing about it. MIFI and its shareholders were badly and wrongfully hurt
during the last two days -- and the "perp-a-traitors" will most likely not be caught, punished, or prevented from

attacking other companies and shareholders in the future. There are unjust practices and unenforced laws in
this financial system that infuriate me and disgust me!


But if a common person wants (or needs!) to invest in stocks, he or she needs to be able to "roll with the
punches" and hope that "in the long run" his or her investments will recover and prosper despite short-selling
attacks, financial system crashes, recessions, depressions, wars, and other harmful results from unethical
and illegal misconduct.


Unless one is able and willing to be an activist, one is forced to be "philosophical" about injustices.

I share your concerns and you're right it is probably naive to believe that we can do anything about manipulative short
attacks. In the beginning and early 1900's when the stock market was still unregulated it was probably way worse
than this, but the stock market is supposedly a 'regulated' market now.


I am not all that familiar with short-selling, so I will need to dig a little into short-selling restrictions that are now being
displayed in my account and how this works.


The fact remains, this stock was manipulated and wouldn't have dropped below 5 if it wasn't for this inaccurate article.


Long-term investors shouldn't care about daily fluctuations, but I agree it's very annoying to see how easily people
manipulate companies and share prices abusing media outlets and Google News. Obviously this only works on small
caps and penny stocks, so they could simply forbid shorting of any company below a 1 billion market cap and get rid
of this problem. I am probably overseeing some other positive aspects of short-selling since I am obviously biased
myself, but still think they should review the current regulatory framework.

oliversk,


I like your suggestion of legally forbidding short-selling of small-cap and micro-cap stocks because they are far more
vulnerable to unethical and harmful manipulations than large and giant cap stocks are.


But I have seen that reformers who seek fairness and reasonableness always have an uphill fight against rich and
powerful vested interests who profit hugely from an all-too-often corrupt and criminal system and status quo.


Consider just one example out of many: the government's failures to catch and prosecute those who engage in
"naked shorting," which is against the law, but which apparently occurs regularly.


If everyone knew about all the crimes that are regularly committed in the U.S. and global stock, bond, and banking
systems -- there would be a public uprising! We only ever see the tip of the iceberg of all the unethical and illegal
misconduct that is being committed daily! And no big banker ever goes to prison. Instead, the big bank simply pays a
small fine (relative to their gigantic financial resources). It's a "wink-and-a-nod" kind of game and a sort of "wild west"
casino. You place your bets, and you take your chances.

Or you withdraw from the game (as much as you can). But even if you refuse to play the game, the game can "crash"
and still adversely affect you (and billions of other innocent people). Billions of common people in Asia, Africa, Europe
(and America!) have never heard of derivatives, but are still suffering the effects of the 2008-2009 crash of the U.S.
and global financial system -- which, as you know, was caused by super-rich and super-powerful financial and
government "players." But the poor and weak common people always get hurt most by the actions of others, of whom
they (we) know little or nothing, and of whom they (we) can control little or not at all.


In such a set of circumstances, one is forced to accept and adapt to the status quo "philosophically" -- or devote huge
amounts of time and energy from one's normal life to try to reform and improve the status quo (which is always an
uphill, uncertain effort against far more powerful opponents)! Not surprisingly, only a very small percentage of people
in any generation ever try to reform and improve "the system."

This is what I found out about short sale restrictions:  
http://1.usa.gov/1s9Oa1p


Apparently short sale restrictions have been around since 2010 and it is one of the mechanisms trying to offset the
damage done by shorts. Well, it's 2015 now, the SEC may want to consider decreasing that to 7% in one day and
extend the number of days because clearly 2 days is not sufficient. Shorts will only lose interest if the number of days
between restrictions is 7-10 days.


That would make short-selling a lot less enticing and prevent manipulative attacks by The Street Sweeper and the
likes.

User 529360
oliversk,


Thank you for the link to government information on short sale restrictions.


After this apparent "short attack" on MIFI's stock price, I definitely want to learn more about the rules and laws
regarding short-selling.


I especially want to learn more about how short-selling may adversely affect MIFI's stock price going forward
(because small-cap and micro-cap stocks are obviously the most vulnerable to short-sellers' attacks).


And I strongly agree with the suggestions you've made here on SA for improving the rules regarding short-
selling in general and of short-selling small-cap and micro-cap stocks in particular.


If and when you are able to, please email or call the SEC (and your Congresspersons) with your suggestions
and your reasons for reforming short-selling laws.


You might include a description of this week's MIFI incident -- as a recent example to show the urgency and
importance of your suggestions for reforming the rules regarding short-selling.


Thanks.

Are there aren't facts to counter the author's claims or just lots of whining about people taking the other side of a bet?
Guess I'll research the company myself and hope that other investors are as heavy on emotion  and light on

Thanks for the article Street Sweeper, prompts me to start my own MIFI research.

Mr. Mckalip,


I you want to learn the POSITIVE facts about how Novatel Wireless (now stock symbol MIFI) is "turning
around" in late 2014 and early 2015 from the company (previous stock symbol NVTL) that was, by many
accounts, poorly managed for many years prior to the major changes in top management in June 2014, I
would suggest you read the following:


1) the official website of Novatel Wireless. (Email or call them too).


2) the earnings reports and conference calls of Novatel. (Especially on and since November 2014 -- and most
especially on this coming February 19, 2015!).


3) the press releases of Novatel. (Especially since the June 2014 major changes in top management).


4) the presentation by Novatel CEO Alex Mashinsky at the Needham Conference in January 2015. (An audio
recording is available online).


5) the short interview with Mr. Mashinsky by The Street. (Also online).


6) the SEC filings by Novatel, by Bruce Karsh, and by Tim Maguire. (The latter two are major new investors in
Novatel).


7) the letter by Tim Maguire to Novatel management in January 2015. (Available online).


8) the long, fact-filled document entitled "The Case for Novatel," which explains in detail how Novatel was
poorly managed by previous management, and what Novatel's future potential is. (Available online, especially
at ragingbull.com).


9) the years of comments about Novatel on the Message Boards for NVTL (and now MIFI) at Yahoo Finance.
(Especially since June 2014 and more especially since November 2014).


10) on the MIFI Message Board at Yahoo Finance, see especially the many POSITIVE facts about Novatel
(MIFI) posted by a highly informed commenter named august1552 -- again especially since June 2014,
November 2014, and most especially since January 2015!


In return for my helpful suggestions for you to more quickly (and more easily) learn the positive facts about
Novatel (MIFI) to counter the negative article by "The Street Sweeper" short-sellers of MIFI -- please return to

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2901876-novatel-wireless-a-fundamentally-flawed-business-plan 13/21


this SA thread when you have read the above TEN sources of information about Novatel/MIFI -- and then
please tell us all here on SA what your personal conclusions and evaluations are about:


A) MIFI's POSITIVE qualities and improving prospects as a "turn-around" company under new management
and


B) whether you honestly think that the NEGATIVE evaluation of Novatel (MIFI) in the article written by "The
Street Sweeper" and published this week by Seeking Alpha was a fair, balanced, and complete evaluation of
Novatel (MIFI) as it is now in 2015 -- now that MIFI has NEW management, NEW funding from NEW
investors, a NEW credit line from Wells Fargo Bank, NEW and MAJOR reductions in Novatel's quarterly
costs, NEW improvements toward being PROFITABLE (for the first time in 5 years!), NEW technology
products, NEW deals with customers emerging in both the U.S. and internationally, NEWLY GROWING into
the exciting, NEW "tech revolution" of M2M (machine to machine communications) and IoT (the internet of
things).


I think it is FAIR to say that the new Novatel of today (and of their future direction) is NOT the old Novatel of
the past -- nor is it the Novatel that "The Street Sweeper" short-sellers of Novatel described this week in their
one-sidedly UNFAIR and NEGATIVE article about Novatel.


And remember, TSS admitted that they "stood to profit" by their "selling MIFI short" (in MIFI stocks -- and I
would say in their article too!) JUST BEFORE MIFI suffered a highly unusual, sudden, extreme, minus-16%
fall in MIFI's stock price -- which happened "coincidentally" on the exact same days that the negative article
on Novatel/MIFI was published by TSS and SA.


So Mr. Mckalip, after you've fully evaluated this entire incident that harmed MIFI's stock price (and that
harmed MIFI's previously upward stock price momentum) -- please tell us all on SA whether you think the
TSS article about Novatel/MIFI was fair, balanced, and complete -- and whether critics of TSS (and of SA) are
simply "whining" -- or whether we have legitimate, justifiable reasons to feel angry and outraged.


11 Feb 2015, 05:24 PM


Brice Mckalip, Contributor
So I did most of the reading you requested and nothing disputed the three important things I read in the
article: 
1) Currently cash flow negative 
2) MIFI's market is very competitive and MIFI is not currently the leader 
3) Company is ATTEMPTING a turn around


Will they succeed turning the company around? The sources you cite certainly think so but are mainly from
management and so I would expect they'd back their own strategy. TSS' analysis is that they won't because
they're behind the curve and won't be able to catch up.


Personally I'm betting with TSS on this one because it's really tough for a company to overcome the dynamics
of its market. I am interested in seeing Q4's results though so might wait to take a position until I see them
just in case I'm wrong; but that's me being cautious and might well mean I miss out on the opportunity.

User 529360
Mr. Mckalip,


Thanks for returning to post the results of your research. 
There's nothing wrong with being skeptical or cautious. 
So you may be wise to just wait and watch.


"august1552" on the Yahoo Finance Message Board (who seems especially well-informed about MIFI, and
who is very positive on MIFI's prospects) wrote recently that the 2Q 2015 earnings report and conference call
in August 2015 should be the time when MIFI shows it is turning around, with significantly more profits and
more deals.


But way before August 2015, MIFI's 4Q 2014 earnings report and conference call this Thursday, Feb. 19, is
expected to show break-even or slightly positive earnings (for the first time in 5 years!). IF so, that would be
the start of the turn-around efforts showing results.


17 Feb 2015, 07:45 PM


Brice Mckalip, Contributor
Glad I was cautious, Q4 results were much much better than I expected. I disdain non-GAAP numbers but a
lot of the expenses even I think were non-recurring like the last litigation payment of $790k and stock based
comp should be backed out if you're going short. All told, looks like they basically broke even and maybe
made some pocket change. Don't know how long the trend will continue but not circling the toilet like I
originally thought.


That said, still appreciate the article; just not going to agree with the thesis this time.


19 Feb 2015, 05:49 PM


User 529360
Mr. Mckalip,


Thanks for your positive comment about MIFI. (For clarity, is "the thesis" you refer to that of the article or that
of the company?)


Either way, I think the earnings report for MIFI's 4Q 2014 is a little more positive than was expected -- and it
beat analysts' estimates.


Pretty good considering that MIFI's new management has only been in power for about 9 months -- and has
already made Novatel Wireless (MIFI) profitable for the first time in 5 years! (Profitable for the first time in
TWENTY quarterly earnings reports!)


The new CEO and management team have very ambitious goals to turn Novatel around. This earnings report
shows that the turn-around has begun already -- but that it will take time to gain strength and speed. Q3 and
Q4 of 2015 are expected to be much more profitable than Q1 and Q2 of this year.


Given MIFI's earnings report today, I think THE FACTS PROVE that Sonya Colberg's "opinion" piece last
week (for the short-selling Street Sweeper organization) was one-sidedly negative and unfairly pessimistic.

Ms. Colberg omitted or downplayed the MANY positive changes that have been happening at Novatel for 9
whole months! Ms. Colberg omitted or downplayed that MIFI is turning around under new management and is
becoming profitable for the first time in 5 years! That's a very big improvement by Novatel -- and that's a very
harmful omission by Ms. Colberg.


So, how adequate and complete was Ms. Colberg's "investigative" reporting and her "thorough" analysis of
Novatel? How fair and balanced was Ms. Colberg's article, with her stock-price-damaging omissions of these
essential FACTS about MIFI -- which have been in the public record, increasingly, for 9 whole months?

do so -- and to report their findings to all of us here. SA has the ethical responsibility, the staff, and the financial-
journalistic resources to research TSS, much more than anyone of us individuals.


I have included in some of my comments on this incident (see my recent comments on MIFI and TSS by clicking on
"Comments" under my name) some important "due diligence" on TSS done by the company Questcor and by a
commenter on the MIFI Message Board on Yahoo Finance named "attilathehunt1." People can judge TSS's history for
themselves.


I think SA has the greatest responsibility to do due diligence on TSS -- BEFORE AND AFTER SA publishes TSS's
article -- since SA's repeated (!) publishing of TSS's unfair article about MIFI helped to give that harmful article more

appeared on TSS's website -- which is much less read than SA's website. Marketwatch then posted a link to TSS's

A lot of unjust injuries were done to MIFI and its supporters -- and I think SA needs to be responsible and make

Read the top disclaimer and read the bottom disclaimer. I think part of due dilligence is to remember that everyone

an article from Street Sweeper.

akarc,


I'm not discounting MIFI, and I'm glad you aren't either. But apparently many less-informed investors in MIFI were
influenced this week to sell their MIFI shares, prematurely and precipitously -- apparently "based on an article from
Street Sweeper," as you say.


No one can "prove" that the article by TSS "caused" the huge sell-off in MIFI, but since no other news was or is being
posted to account for the big drop in MIFI's stock price, I think it's most likely that the article by TSS (published twice
by SA) played a big part in MIFI's stock price being harmed.


As for those "disclaimers" by TSS, I won't even dignify them with a response.

Sonya Colberg and her employer "The Street Sweeper" seem to have a pattern and method of combining short-
selling of vulnerable small-cap stocks with articles that slam these stocks, and sometimes help to make them fall in
price, whereupon The Street Sweeper "stands to profit" (as they say themselves in their disclosure).

Here is my reply to "justanotherid" on the ZIOP comments thread, following Sonya Colberg's TSS article slamming
ZIOP on Jan. 16, 2015 -- just 24 days before she slammed (and TSS shorted) MIFI this week, on Feb. 9 and 10,
2015:


justanotherid,


Thanks for the link to Sonya Colberg's SA article for The Street Sweeper that slammed SGMA in September 2013.


Sonya Colberg and The Street Sweeper seem to have a pattern (and a method) of COMBINING short-selling with
self-serving, one-sided, overly-negative articles about vulnerable small-cap stocks. (The positive aspects of these
companies are omitted or downplayed.)


In addition to her slam against SGMA, and her Jan. 16, 2015 slam against ZIOP, she also slammed MIFI on Feb. 9
and 10, 2015 -- only 24 and 25 days later!


MIFI promptly fell 16% over those two days. Cause-and-effect or just coincidence?


While Sonya Colberg did not short-sell ZIOP and MIFI herself, her employer "The Street Sweeper" DID short-sell
ZIOP and MIFI.


So what is the meaning (and value) of her "disclosure" that "The author is not receiving compensation for it." (That is,
for her writing articles slamming ZIOP and MIFI)? The Street Sweeper presumably pays Sonya Colberg for writing
these slams against these small-cap stocks that TSS short-sells BEFORE Sonya Colberg's articles are published. Is
not "payment" to Sonya Colberg by The Street Sweeper the same as "compensation"? Or does Sonya Colberg write
these slams for free?


Suspiciously, her slam against ZIOP is partly based on an ANONYMOUS doctor -- and her slam against MIFI is partly
based on an ANONYMOUS tech analyst!


Another pattern (and method) of anonymous sources. Why the anonymous sources? Are these anonymous sources
real or pretend? How can readers and investors judge the credibility, integrity, fairness, (and reality) of the sources
(and of Sonya Colberg and The Street Sweeper) if the latter two refuse (or fail) to tell us who their sources are?


I request Seeking Alpha to investigate the history, personnel, methods, and results of The Street Sweeper (and Sonya
Colberg) articles for integrity, accuracy, completeness, balance, and fairness -- and to decide whether or not to
publish articles by TSS and SC anymore.

I've heard the phrase "reverse pump and dumper" used in connection with TSS. Unfortunately many financial news
sites post numbers of questionable writings from questionable writers. As well as articles from various writers that can
be seen all across the spectrum of financial sites.


Some of these writers never change there underlying theme and pound the "revcovery" or "disaster" bell for years at a
time. Obviously playing to an audience seeking confirmation bias. They are published over and over again regardless
of track record. Track record being hard to establish in an arena where even the best can be wrong at any moment.

Some sites have played to these themes to such an extent as to lose the credibility/integrity they may have once had.
But they understand the strength of confirmation bias and find it profitable. That being said, I do not include Seeking
Alpha as one of those sites.


I do run across articles that are highly questionable. I think the comments section of seeking alpha is extremely
important. Often times I find the truth of the article in the comments section. Even then I have run across articles
followed by comments that looked a bit questionable. Pump and Dumps maybe?


I am saddened at the recent revelations re: Brian Williams. Also the resultant pile on. Freedom of the press was
deemed important so that people may know the truth. Unfortuantely it has also unleashed hoardes of those willing, for
a price, to create roadkill for the vultures.


In my opinion only, the Sonya Colberg/TSS relationship is incestous and the constant use of anonymous sources
leads one to wonder about legalities!


It would appear we are agreed.


15 Feb 2015, 12:20 PM


User 529360
akarc,


Thank you for your reply. We do agree on many points.


Please allow me to correct a mistake I made, before I reply to your points.


The company that Sonya Colberg slammed and that The Street Sweeper short-sold in September 2013 (and
that SA commenter "justanotherid" provided a link to) was SGMO (not SGMA as I erroneously typed).


OK, here are my reply points to you, akarc:


1) I've read many comments online that slam Sonya Colberg and The Street Sweeper. Some of these
comments are actually here on SA, in response to articles on SA by SC and TSS. Some are on other
websites, like Yahoo Finance and others.


2) I've read comments online that allege unethical and illegal actions were committed by people associated to
TSS in the past. I cited one of these allegations (made by a company called Questcor) about a person tied to
TSS, in one of my recent comments about MIFI. In my comment, I provided a link to a press release by
Questcor, which apparently TSS also slammed in the past.


3) I'd like to know if TSS (and Sonya Colberg) EVER write and publish POSITIVE and LONG-SIDE
evaluations of stocks. Or is TSS strictly a "short-seller shop"?


4) I'd like to know if TSS "coordinates" their own short-selling of vulnerable small-cap stocks with hedge funds
and/or with followers or associates of TSS. The massive minus-16% drop in MIFI's stock price last week
made me wonder if TSS was able to gather a huge amount of money (and many other short-sellers) to get
MIFI to fall so much in price and so fast (right after the TSS article by SC, published on SA and Marketwatch)
-- and if so, exactly how TSS was able to do all this.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2901876-novatel-wireless-a-fundamentally-flawed-business-plan 19/21


5) I've read online that TSS has done this "one-two punch" trick (of establishing a short-sell position against a
vulnerable small-cap stock and then having one of its "senior editors" write and publish an article that strongly
supports selling the targeted stock) at least 4 or 5 times.


If TSS has a history and reputation of playing this "1-2 punch" short-selling "game" that HARMS the targeted
stock price, the company, and innocent investors -- I wonder why SA, MW, and other websites repeatedly
publish TSS articles.


6) I've read online that one person complained to SA about TSS in the past, and that SA basically replied that
TSS's articles are simply TSS's "interpretation" or opinion. That defense or excuse doesn't satisfy my sense
of SA's or MW's responsibility to evaluate (and to possibly exclude) what may be misleading and manipulative
articles used for monetary gain at the expense of innocent others.


If someone repeatedly yells "Fire!" in crowded theaters, and innocent people repeatedly get hurt in the
stampedes, that "someone" is not just "entitled to their opinion" that there "might" be a fire. No, they are held
to account by the law and by public standards of proper behavior -- with respect to the rights of other people.
They are held responsible under the law if they wrongfully hurt innocent people.


7) The "1-2 punch" method, pattern, and history of The Street Sweeper and Sonya Colberg are, in my
opinion, improper and harmful to innocent people and investors (as well as to the vulnerable small-cap
companies that they frequently or exclusively target to sell-short). That is why I "call upon" SA, MW, and the
SEC to investigate TSS's and SC's history, methods, and associations to evaluate whether their behavior is
ethical, legal, and allowable.


8) If it is not, I would like to see TSS and SC held accountable to the rules and laws. And if it is not, I would
like to see SA and MW ban their articles. 
On the other hand, if the methods of TSS and SC are found to be ethical, legal, and allowable by the SEC,
SA, and MW -- then I will feel disappointed and disgusted by "the lack of proper standards and dutiful
enforcement" within and by the system (for the umpteenth time!).


9) I do agree with you, akarc, that the comments following every article are extremely valuable in providing
others' opinions, which often correct errors in the article itself -- and which often add important information,
and advance the discussion and debate (in a collective search for the facts and the truth). BUT -- the article
and the headline often have much more influence on the public (and on the market) than a superior,
corrective comment that might be "buried" and hard to find, 10 or 20 comments down the thread after the
article.


It's like a newspaper having a huge headline on the front page claiming a falsehood or partial truth -- and then
that newspaper "running a correction" the next day in a tiny paragraph on page 17, buried on the inside of the
newspaper. Obviously, the front page headline is seen by far more readers, and has a far greater influence
than the correction and the truth that far fewer readers see after the damage has been done.


10) I've commented a lot about TSS, SC, MIFI, SA, etc. during the past week -- because my sense of truth
and fairness was violated and offended so badly. But I've got other things to do that are more important to me
now -- so I will be limiting my comments (to nothing or to very little) for a while. Good luck to you, akarc.

It's part of their manipulative tactics.


There are many small details that don't add up. Also they completely ignore any of the positives and how this
company really has carved out a niche where they can reach a 40% profit margin. Any business that even dares to
make such claims has a unique market position in a niche that you can't simply enter without a many years of RnD.
Yes, sure Intel and the likes are all competitors but in completely different market segments, which TSS completely
ignored.


Anyway as I stated before, TSS article is more harmful to investors than it is helpful and should not have been
published in the first place because it was a clear short attack.

oliversk,


Thanks for your reply. We agree on much.

I have read where the founder of of TSS was convicted of security crimes. After doing his pennance he swore the
turning over of a new leaf stating, and this is not a quote, he was going to go after companies that were not being
straight up with the public. Susposedly one of his writers answered an ad for a writer needed. He does have masterful
that writer that had, operative word, credibility at one time.


I have to wonder, but it would only be speculation, where some funding comes from to place large bets. I did a google
search on them awhile back. It tooks hours to find, what for me, was damning. In the process I found that they are
damn good at SEO.


In the past I have spent much time, money and energy, trying to right wrongs and expose the truth. To mine and my
families detriment. I learned much. Most of which I knew but hoped could be changed. I have found that although
David may have been able to wip Goliath, Goliath whips my ass every time.


So when I initially said "due your due diligence", I was referring to much more than a particular stock. I will continue to
follow MIFI as the game may not yet be over.

5/22/2018 Novatel Wireless: A Fundamentally Flawed Business Plan - Inseego Corp. (NASDAQ:INSG) | Seeking Alpha

Regarding your third paragraph: I'm very sorry to hear that. I sympathize very deeply. It happened to me too --
massively. Every word.


That is why, in an earlier comment, I spoke about the hard choice between being an activist for truth and
justice -- or -- accepting and adapting to falsehoods and injustices "philosophically."

I suspected that user when I saw your rage re Street Sweeper. Unfortuantely those who profit from injustice are better
backed than those that would seek justice. It is sad.

Happy to present a response to the author's bearish case for an investment in Novatel. Despite the best efforts of
TheStreetSweeper, as the author calls himself, to portray an investment case in Novatel as an outright flawed one,
the author's case is anchored on false assertions and incorrect HYPOTHESIS of both current and future business
prospects of the company.


Also, with the release of Q4 results and guidance provided, it is clearly visible that the business plan is great and
working.


Revenue Outlook - The revenue outlook for the company's device or MIFI segment is bright and margins have
strengthened. As is visible in the Q4 numbers released a few days ago and guidance, this isn't a one off quarter but a
trend. Company is still dominantly selling the old models of 5510. With the 6620 rollout about to pick pace, revenue
and margins would increase further in North America. Also, company is the midst of trials and announcements with
multiple international carriers. One of them which would be announced soon per the earnings call is a large carrier
with presence in multiple countries across Multiple East and Africa.


Also, the Telematics or M2M side side of the business is a smaller portion of revenue currently but has the potential to
be 200m business. Novatel has recently announced a few partnerships in the M2M pace and is in the midst of trials.
Based on the past results, it takes 2 quarters for trials to materialize and show up in the revenue so i expect that by
Q3 of this year, the M2M business will increase. The management has made it clear that it intends to and will need to
do acquisitions to enter and expand different verticals in the IOT/M2M segment.


Even without the progress that may or may not happen, Novatel is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the
same space.


Grateful for the earnest attempt at a bearish argument against Novatel Wireless but the author's reasoning in the
article is very flimsy. The article has further affirmed my bullishness in finding no deal-killing reasons to avoid the
shares.
