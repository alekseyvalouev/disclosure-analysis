When Catastrophe Strikes

Summary


Matthew may be the first major hurricane to land on the east coast of Florida for over
a decade.


The east coast has a high concentration of insured property.


Our rough estimates indicate HRTG and UVE may be the biggest losers.


The long storm drought in Florida has ended. When Matthew hits Florida, it will be the
third storm of the season to make landfall. It has the potential to cause major damage on
the east coastal areas. We present a short review of the primary Florida insurers'
exposures and an assessment of the severity of the damages they are likely to
experience.


The table below shows wind exposure for coastal Florida from Broward County to the
north along with total policies in the area and wind exposure per policy.


East Coast Wind Exposure


Source: FLOIR and estimates. Includes coastal counties from Broward to Nassau and
Orange.


Total exposure would seem to indicate that Federated National (NASDAQ:FNHC) has the
largest probability of loss. The company has over 50% of its total wind exposure in the
area covered. However, it is likely that the simple measure of total exposure will not be
indicative of total losses. There are other factors we think will play a role.

We believe that exposure per policy is important. Generally speaking, a higher value
indicates that the carrier insures higher value properties. In this case, FNHC has a high
number along with United Insurance (NASDAQ:UIHC) and Heritage (NYSE:HRTG), which
has the highest. Both FNHC and UIHC generally underwrite higher value homes. Although
HRTG has the highest exposure per policy, we do not think it is necessarily indicative of
high value insured property. Heritage is the second largest insurer of commercial
residential properties in the eastern zone covered. Commercial coverage raises the
average significantly. Excluding commercial coverage, HRTG's average exposure per
policy is $295,507.


There are two issues related to HRTG exposure. First, approximately 35% of the
company's exposure in the area is through commercial policies, which can be high-claim
during an event. Additionally, HRTG is the only public company that underwrites mobile
home policies. As of 2Q16, HRTG had just over 2,500 mobile home policies with over
$100M in exposure. This is only 0.27% of total wind exposure. However, if Mathew moves
on its current track we would expect high losses with mobile homes.


We believe Universal Insurance (NYSEMKT:UVE) is likely to experience the highest
losses after HRTG. The company has 43% of total exposure in the area, and importantly,
the lowest exposure per policy at $230,665. We think this indicates that UVE insures
older, low value properties. The company is known to underwrite alongside Citizens in the
most risk-prone areas of Florida. Insuring older coastal properties would fit with that
profile. Unfortunately, for UVE shareholders, older low value structures are prone to higher
losses.


Homeowner's Choice (NYSE:HCI) may fair better than HRTG and UVE. However, like
UVE, HCI insures lower value structures making it vulnerable.


We think FNHC and UIHC are probably the least exposed. Although FNHC has the
highest headline exposure, the company focuses on underwriting newer, higher value
properties with the exception of its Monarch joint venture, as does UIHC. This is evident in
the high exposure per policy for both companies.


In 2015, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation conducted stress tests of Florida
insurers. As noted in this article from the Insurance Journal, the report concluded that
Florida insurers were well-capitalized and prepared to handle a 1-in-100 storm. Matthew
may not be a storm of that magnitude, but the trajectory of the storm suggests it could
cause significant losses for the group.

What are your thoughts with regards to reinsurance programs of these companies?

Author’s reply »  It is extremely difficult to assess the reinsurance companies. What is made public is
inadequate. Unfortunately, the OIR allows and helps facilitate keeping the documents "trade secrets". As a
result, the details are unknown - and like much else, the devil is in the details. That said, HCI's reinsurance
coverage includes their captive, so from the perspective of HCI shareholders, it's the same as not being
covered.

New Capital, Contributor
Thanks. I also thought about HCI captive. 
Q3 is still going to be great - low reinsurance cost and no major events. And then in Q4 with Matthew
seemingly causing only minimal damage, even HCI might get out of this relatively unscratched.

In addition to New Capital's question, can the author provide any historical data to suggest how much higher
premiums are likely to be priced on a go-forward basis? I'm assuming the pricing will be allowed to rise significantly
over the next few years to mitigate losses as needed. How have Fla insurance regulators responded in the last few
decades? Thanks

Best time to cover your short would have been yesterday, I guess.

Insurance stocks all look to open higher premarket. I bought some HRTG yesterday during the panic. They have no
debt, $5 share in cash, 2% divi, authorized buyback, and trade at a below 10 multiple and discount to book value. The
hurricane at this point looks to be less damaging then expected. Good job being the first to write a fear mongering
article on HRTG though. I'll enjoy taking your money today. I was buying yesterday when you were writing this article.
Good day :)

plus maximum exposure to hrtg is $40 million because of reinsurance, good investment, what did you
purchase at? I purchased 462 shares at $12.02 yesterday.

Bought as well. Per the financial statements hrtg and uve have significant reinsurance policies. Granted they
don't go too much into detail but it seemed as if they weren't significantly exposed. Made a nice profit
between the two.

Is $40m of reinsurance enough for HRTG? How much should they have?


10 Mar 2017, 11:35 AM


davidcl2
currently 13.68 for HRTG, I'm going to hold it long term, company is solid!


07 Oct 2016, 09:10 AM


jojob852
I have an existing position so yesterday I just added when I started seeing $0 targets. Got mine in the low $12s.
Overpaid management but solid insurer for the most part

It looks like the biggest damage will be to Georgia where they where recently approved to write insurance but have no
policies in effect .

Insurance companies re-insure their exposure. The loses will not be as high as the author proclaims. 
Secondly, insurance companies are in the business of making money. If they think that potential loses are not covered
by fees, they will either hike those fees or cancel the policies. 
Thirdly, insurance companies are usually not willing to just hand over the money when a claim is filed. They will
scrutinize that claim and go through great lengths not to pay.

We believe Universal Insurance (NYSEMKT:UVE) is likely to experience the highest losses after HRTG

I think by "fees" you mean premiums, which are regulated by the OIR. Just look at HRTG recent attempt to
increase rates and see how the OIR responded. Citizens and others are taking 5-8% rate increases that will
be realized over the next 12-18 months. Not all exposure is reinsured, most insurers have attachment points
around $25-$50M which is right in the range of Matthews damages. "Going to great lengths not to pay" is a
stereotype. First, if they've rated and reserved correctly there is nothing to worry about. Second, the OIR
actively monitors and audits claims settlements (see any of the OIRs actions in the last 5 years about UVE or
others).

Supposedly HRTG has $40m of reinsurance. Is this enough? How much should they have?
