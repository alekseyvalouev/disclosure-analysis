Why	Net	1	UEPS	Will	Soon	Lose	Almost	70%	Of	Its	Revenue
Oct.	30,	2015	10:00	AM	ET32	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


My	initial	estimate	that	Net	1	UEPS	would	lose	~50%	of	its	revenue	base	due	to	the
SASSA	contract	expiration	was	too	low.


While	conducting	additional	diligence,	I	discovered	that	the	Company	will	likely	lose
almost	70%	of	its	revenue	base.


Due	to	the	loss	of	70%	of	its	revenue	from	the	SASSA	contract	expiration,	UEPS	will
likely	become	a	significant	loss-making	business.


UEPS	remains	a	very	attractive	short	opportunity	at	the	current	price	level.


In	my	initial	article	on	Net	1	UEPS	Technologies	(NASDAQ:UEPS)	("UEPS"	or	the
"Company"),	I	argued	that	UEPS	is	significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price
level.	One	of	the	key	points	of	my	initial	article	was	that	the	Company	would	soon	lose
over	50%	of	its	revenue	base	due	to	the	SASSA	contract	expiration.	Management,	by
contrast,	appears	to	have	misled	investors	into	believing	that	the	SASSA	revenue
accounted	for	just	24%	of	its	total	revenues	in	FY	2015.	Unfortunately	for	UEPS	investors,
it	appears	that	my	initial	estimation	of	the	Company's	SASSA-related	revenue	was	actually
too	low.	After	conducting	further	research,	I	discovered	that	almost	70%	of	the	Company's
total	revenue	is	derived	from	the	SASSA	contract.	In	this	article,	I	will	discuss	in	detail	how
I	arrived	at	this	revised	estimate.


Impact	Of	Expiration	Of	SASSA	Contract	To	Be	Greater	Than	I	Initially	Anticipated


As	stated	in	the	introduction,	UEPS	actually	receives	almost	70%	of	its	total	revenue	from
the	SASSA	contract.	This	is	much	higher	than	my	initial	estimate	that	approximately	50%
of	the	Company's	revenue	was	derived	from	this	contract.	Before	diving	into	my	updated
analysis	of	UEPS's	pro	forma	revenue,	I	have	provided	below	my	initial	estimate	of
UEPS's	FY	2015	revenue	pro	forma	for	the	SASSA	contract	expiration:

As	shown	above,	due	to	the	loss	of	SASSA	grant	distribution,	microlending	and
Zazoo/Umoya	Manje	revenue,	I	initially	estimated	that	UEPS	would	lose	$320mm	or	51%
of	its	revenue	base.	However,	after	further	research,	I	discovered	that	there	are	additional
SASSA-related	business	lines	which	are	not	accounted	for	in	the	above	table.	More
specifically,	the	Company's	smart	card	account	service	fees	and	SASSA	cardholder
transaction	fees	were	not	included	in	my	initial	estimate.	When	the	loss	of	these	two
businesses	are	included,	I	estimate	that	over	$420mm	or	67%	of	the	Company's	FY
2015	total	revenue	came	from	SASSA-related	sources.	As	a	result,	my	revised
estimate	of	the	Company's	pro	forma	FY	2015	revenue	is	just	$206mm.	Provided
below	is	a	segment-by-segment	discussion	of	how	I	came	up	with	this	revised	pro	forma
revenue	estimate.


South	African	Transaction	Processing	Revenue


UEPS's	South	African	Transaction	Processing	segment	includes	revenue	from	the	SASSA
grant	distribution	fees,	SASSA	cardholder	transaction	fees,	EasyPay	transaction
processing	fees	and	FIHRST	payroll	transaction	processing	fees.	Since	FY	2014,	UEPS
has	provided	a	very	limited	amount	of	information	regarding	the	performance	of	its
EasyPay	transaction	processing	business.	That	being	said,	I	was	able	to	come	up	with	a
reasonable	estimate	of	the	Company's	EasyPay	transaction	processing	revenue	based	on
historical	data.	Provided	below	is	a	table	which	shows	EasyPay's	key	financial	metrics
from	FY	2007	to	FY	2013:


As	shown	above,	UEPS	stopped	providing	fee	per	transaction	details	after	FY	2009.	From
FY	2010	to	FY	2013,	the	Company	only	reported	the	number	of	transactions	processed	by
the	EasyPay	business.	Then,	for	some	strange	reason,	after	FY	2013,	UEPS	decided	to
stop	providing	any	relevant	performance	metrics	for	this	business.	Although	the	number	of
transactions	processed	and	fee	data	has	not	been	provided,	I	was	able	to	come	up	with	a

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3620546-net-1-ueps-will-soon-lose-almost-70-percent-revenue 3/9


reasonable	estimate	for	FY	2015	EasyPay	transaction	processing	revenue.	After	peaking
at	over	707mm	EasyPay	transactions	processed	in	FY	2011,	the	number	of	transactions
declined	sharply	to	425mm	in	FY	2012	and	420mm	in	FY	2013.	Based	on	this	declining
trend,	I	have	assumed	that	the	Company	processed	the	same	amount	of	transactions
(420mm)	in	FY	2015	as	in	FY	2013.	I	believe	this	is	a	reasonable	and	probably	overly
generous	assumption	given	the	sharp	decline	in	FY	2012	and	FY	2013.	Regarding	fees,
as	shown	in	the	table	above,	the	fee	per	transaction	remained	flat	at	0.21	rand	from	FY
2007	to	FY	2009.	Based	on	this,	I	believe	that	assuming	a	per	transaction	fee	of	0.21	rand
is	reasonable.	Assuming	an	average	exchange	rate	of	0.085	USD	per	rand,	my	estimate
for	UEPS's	fee	per	transaction	in	FY	2015	is	$0.018.	Thus,	I	estimate	that	the
Company's	revenue	from	EasyPay	transaction	processing	fees	was	$7.5mm	in	FY
2015	($0.018	*	420mm	transactions).


Next	up	is	UEPS's	FIHRST	payroll	transaction	processing	business.	Provided	below	are
the	historical	performance	metrics	of	FIHRST:


As	seen	in	the	above	table,	UEPS	stopped	providing	the	number	of	transactions
processed	by	FIHRST	after	FY	2013.	The	Company	has	also	never	reported	annual
revenue	for	this	business	segment.	That	said,	given	the	small	number	of	transactions
processed	by	FIHRST	relative	to	EasyPay	(24mm	and	420mm,	respectively,	in	FY	2013),
it	is	reasonable	to	assume	that	FIHRST	is	much	smaller	than	EasyPay	from	a	revenue
standpoint.	As	calculated	earlier,	I	estimate	that	the	EasyPay	business	generates	around
$7.5mm	in	annual	revenue.	Although	the	number	of	transactions	processed	by	FIHRST
was	just	6%	of	those	processed	by	EasyPay,	I	have	conservatively	assumed	that	FIHRST
revenue	amounted	to	33%	of	EasyPay	revenue.	Thus,	I	estimate	that	FIHRST	payroll
transaction	processing	revenue	was	$2.5mm	in	FY	2015.


In	regards	to	the	SASSA	grant	distribution	fees,	the	following	information	is	provided	in	the
Company's	FY	2015	10-K:


"During	our	2015,	2014	and	2013	fiscal	years,	we	derived	approximately	24%,	27%,
and	42%	of	our	revenues	respectively,	from	CPS's	social	welfare	grant
distribution	business."

7/18/2019 Why Net 1 UEPS Will Soon Lose Almost 70% Of Its Revenue - Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:UEPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3620546-net-1-ueps-will-soon-lose-almost-70-percent-revenue 4/9


In	FY	2015,	the	Company	received	24%	of	its	total	revenue	from	fees	for	the	monthly
distribution	of	grant	payments.	Based	on	consolidated	FY	2015	revenue	of	$626mm,	this
equates	to	$150mm	in	annual	revenue	contribution.	As	highlighted	in	the	bold	portion	of
the	quote	above,	the	$150mm	in	revenue	contribution	is	generated	solely	from	the	SASSA
grant	distribution	fees.	It	does	not	include	any	of	the	SASSA	cardholder	transaction	fees
that	the	Company	receives	whenever	a	beneficiary	uses	its	smart	card	account	to
withdraw	money	or	buy	goods	and	services.	To	prove	that	the	$150mm	in	revenue
contribution	is	entirely	from	the	grant	distribution	fees,	I	have	provided	the	following
analysis:


As	stated	by	management	during	its	Q3	2015	earnings	call,	the	Company	receives	a	fee
of	16.50	rand	per	month	for	each	beneficiary	distribution.	Based	on	an	average	exchange
rate	of	0.085	USD	per	rand,	this	equates	to	$1.40	per	monthly	distribution.	As	per	UEPS's
most	recent	10-K,	the	Company	distributes	grant	payments	to	approximately	9mm
beneficiaries	per	month.	Thus,	this	data	implies	that	UEPS	received	around	$151mm
in	grant	distribution	fees	in	FY	2015	(9mm	beneficiaries	*	$1.40	fee	per	distribution	*
12	months).	This	is	in	line	with	the	Company's	statement	that	24%	or	$150mm	of	its	FY
2015	revenue	was	from	the	SASSA	grant	distribution	fees.


When	I	wrote	my	initial	article	on	UEPS,	I	believed	that	the	$150mm	of	SASSA	revenue
disclosed	in	the	Company's	filings	referred	to	both	grant	payment	distribution	fees,	as	well
as	SASSA	cardholder	transaction	fees.	However,	as	discussed	in	the	prior	paragraph,	the
$150mm	of	SASSA	revenue	referenced	in	the	Company	filings	is	entirely	from	SASSA
grant	distribution	fees.	It	does	not	account	for	SASSA	cardholder	transaction	fees.
Although	the	revenue	from	SASSA	cardholder	transaction	fees	is	not	reported,	I	was	still
able	to	estimate	the	revenue	contribution	from	this	business.	As	stated	previously,	the
South	African	Transaction	Processing	segment	is	comprised	of	four	business	lines.	I	have
already	calculated	that	three	of	these	four	business	lines	contributed	$160mm	of
combined	revenue	in	FY	2015	($7.5mm	from	EasyPay	+	$2.5mm	from	FIHRST	+
$150mm	from	SASSA	grant	distribution).	On	a	consolidated	basis,	the	South	African
Transaction	Processing	segment	reported	$216mm	of	revenue	in	FY	2015.	Thus,	by
deducting	$160mm	from	$216mm,	I	estimate	that	revenue	from	SASSA	cardholder
transaction	fees	was	$56mm	in	FY	2015.

Finally,	to	wrap	up	this	section,	I	have	provided	below	a	table	with	my	estimate	of	FY	2015
South	African	Transaction	Processing	revenue	by	business	line:


International	Transaction	Processing


UEPS	reported	$165mm	in	International	Transaction	Processing	revenue.	All	of	this
revenue	was	non-SASSA	related	revenue.	Thus,	a	detailed	discussion	of	this	business
segment	is	not	necessary.


Financial	Inclusion	and	Applied	Technologies


UEPS's	Financial	Inclusion	and	Applied	Technologies	segment	can	be	categorized	into
four	business	lines:	microloans,	Zazoo/Umoya	Manje,	smart	card	accounts	and	other
sales	(hardware,	software,	etc.).	I	discussed	the	Company's	microloan	and	Zazoo/Umoya
Manje	businesses	in	detail	in	my	initial	article	on	UEPS.	As	explained	in	my	initial	article,
the	Company's	microloan	and	Umoya	Manje	businesses	will	both	likely	disappear
once	the	SASSA	contract	ends.	On	a	combined	basis,	I	estimate	that	these	two
businesses	accounted	for	~$170mm	of	revenue	in	FY	2015	($62mm	from	microloans	+
$108mm	from	Umoya	Manje).


Smart	card	accounts	revenue	is	derived	from	the	maintenance	fees	that	the	Company
receives	from	its	smart	card	accounts.	When	UEPS	issues	a	smart	card,	an	associated
account	is	opened	for	each	card	issued.	Then,	every	month,	the	Company	receives	a
fixed	fee	for	the	ongoing	maintenance	of	these	accounts.	Like	the	microloan	and	Umoya
Manje	businesses,	the	smart	card	accounts	business	is	highly	dependent	on	the	SASSA
contract	for	its	revenue.	The	reason	is	because	the	vast	majority	of	the	Company's	smart
card	holders	are	social	grant	beneficiaries.	Prior	to	Q4	2014,	UEPS	reported	smart	card
accounts	revenue	in	a	separate	operating	segment.	However,	after	Q4	2014,	the
Company	decided	to	reduce	its	reportable	operating	segments	from	five	to	three.	As	a
result,	smart	card	accounts	revenue	was	consolidated	into	a	new	and	larger	segment
called	Financial	Inclusion	and	Applied	Technologies.	Due	to	this	change	in	reporting,	I	was
initially	unaware	that	revenue	from	smart	card	accounts	was	included	in	this	segment.	As
a	result,	in	my	initial	article	on	UEPS,	I	did	not	deduct	smart	card	accounts	revenue	when
estimating	FY	2015	revenue	pro	forma	for	the	SASSA	contract	expiration.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3620546-net-1-ueps-will-soon-lose-almost-70-percent-revenue 6/9


Provided	below	is	a	breakdown	of	UEPS's	segment-by-segment	financials	provided	in	the
Company's	Q3	2014	10-Q:


Prior	to	changing	its	reportable	operating	segments	in	Q4	2014,	UEPS	reported	$33mm	of
smart	card	accounts	revenue	in	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2014.	This	represents	$44mm
of	smart	card	accounts	revenue	on	an	annualized	basis.	Given	that	the	number	of	grant
beneficiaries	did	not	change	much	from	FY	2014	to	FY	2015,	it	is	reasonable	to	assume
that	FY	2015	smart	card	accounts	revenue	was	in	line	with	FY	2014.	Thus,	I	estimate
that	revenue	from	smart	card	accounts	was	$44mm	in	FY	2015.	Finally,	the	other
remaining	businesses	in	the	Financial	Inclusion	and	Applied	Technologies	segment
appear	to	be	non-SASSA	related.	I	estimate	that	revenue	from	other	remaining
business	lines	(i.e.	hardware,	software,	etc.)	was	$31mm	in	FY	2015.


A	summary	of	FY	2015	Financial	Inclusion	and	Applied	Technologies	revenue	by	business
line	is	provided	below:


SASSA	vs.	Non-SASSA	Related	Revenue


Putting	it	all	together,	I	have	provided	below	a	detailed	breakdown	of	UEPS's	revenue	by
segment.	Note	that	I	have	highlighted	all	of	the	SASSA-related	revenue	items	in	gray:



http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=9974726-897-230796&type=sect&TabIndex=2&companyid=77961&ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcik%253d1041514

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3620546-net-1-ueps-will-soon-lose-almost-70-percent-revenue 7/9


Next,	based	on	the	SASSA-related	revenue	items	highlighted	in	gray	above,	I	have
calculated	a	revised	estimate	of	UEPS's	FY	2015	revenue	pro	forma	for	the	SASSA
contract	expiration.	This	revised	estimate	is	provided	in	the	figure	below:


Finally,	I	have	provided	below	a	segment-by-segment	breakdown	of	UEPS's	FY	2015
revenue	pro	forma	for	the	SASSA	contract	expiration:


Due	to	the	loss	of	SASSA	grant	distribution,	SASSA	cardholder	transaction,	microlending,
Umoya	Manje	and	smart	card	accounts	revenue,	I	estimate	that	UEPS	will	lose	$420mm
or	67%	of	its	FY	2015	revenue	base	following	the	SASSA	contract	expiration.	This	is
significantly	higher	than	my	initial	estimate	that	$320mm	or	51%	of	the	Company's	FY
2015	revenue	base	would	be	lost.	Also,	as	seen	in	the	pro	forma	segment-by-segment
7/18/2019 Why Net 1 UEPS Will Soon Lose Almost 70% Of Its Revenue - Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:UEPS) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3620546-net-1-ueps-will-soon-lose-almost-70-percent-revenue 8/9


revenue	analysis	above,	the	loss	of	the	SASSA	contract	will	effectively	turn	UEPS	into	just
a	bit	player	in	the	South	African	region	with	just	$41mm	in	annual	revenue	($10mm	+
$31mm).	Thus,	following	the	contract	expiration,	the	Company's	only	sizable	business	will
be	its	low-margin	international	KSNET	business.	Given	these	facts,	I	believe	that	it	is
reasonable	to	conclude	that	UEPS	will	likely	become	a	significant	loss-making
business	following	the	expiration	of	its	SASSA	contract.


Another	key	takeaway	from	this	analysis	is	that,	outside	of	its	SASSA-related	business
lines,	most	of	UEPS's	other	businesses	are	either	declining	or	growing	only	a
modest	amount.	As	was	discussed,	both	EasyPay	and	FIHRST	have	experienced
significant	declines	in	their	customer	base.	Also,	although	KSNET	has	grown	at	a	decent
clip,	this	is	a	capital-intensive,	low-margin	business	and	its	growth	has	slowed	down	over
the	past	couple	years.	Thus,	the	loss	of	the	SASSA	contract	will	not	only	reduce	the
Company's	revenue	base	by	almost	70%,	but	it	will	also	kill	off	the	most	significant	growth
drivers	of	the	business.


Conclusion


Based	on	my	additional	research,	I	believe	that	UEPS	is	an	even	better	short	than	I
originally	thought.	Following	the	loss	over	almost	70%	of	its	revenue	base,	it	will	be
extremely	difficult	for	the	Company	to	operate	a	profitable	and	competitive	business.	Over
the	past	couple	days,	I	have	also	uncovered	a	wealth	of	new	evidence	regarding
misleading	and	highly	unethical	behavior	by	UEPS's	management.	I	will	report	my	findings
on	this	matter	in	a	follow-up	article.


Disclosure:	I	am/we	are	short	UEPS.	I	wrote	this	article	myself,	and	it	expresses	my	own	opinions.	I	am	not	receiving
compensation	for	it	(other	than	from	Seeking	Alpha).	I	have	no	business	relationship	with	any	company	whose	stock	is
mentioned	in	this	article.

Lets	start	with	the	premise	of	this	article...the	loss	of	sassa	revs	...which	is	the	stated	reason	the	author	says	it	should
be	shorted.	If	one	looks	at	the	steady	3	year	ascent	of	the	stock	price	from	$5	to	today's	$17	the	overwhelming
positive	theme	has	been	the	separation	from	the	reliance	on	the	sassa	contract.	Every	step	we	get	closer	to	a
complete	revision	or	separation	of	that	5	year	win	or	lose	contract	the	better	the	prospects	and	the	higher	the	stock
price.	And	the	reason	for	that	is	well	stated	by	the	CEO,	the	new	restrictions	that	sassa	says	they	will	insist	on	will
make	the	conversion	of	the	benefitiaries	to	an	EasyPay	account	likely.	And	the	facts	as	defined	by	the	progress
numbers	to	date	in	that	conversion	process	bear	that	out.	The	company	clearly	presented	the	numbers	on	analyst	day

JOIN	THE	CONVERSATION


surrounding	the	metrics	of	signing	up	a	beneficiary	to	an	EasyPay	account.	There	are	10M	beneficiaries	and	if	they
open	2M	accounts	that	replaces	the	"pay	per	beneficiary"	the	company	gets	now	(and	until	2017	at	least).	The	initial
projections	based	on	the	early	progress	would	imply	5M	rather	than	2M.	And	when	you	look	at	what	significant
benefits	UEPS'	EasyPay	offers	over	the	Neanderthal	benefits	sassa	wants,	its	not	hard	to	see	that.	Not	one	sentence
of	the	authors	prose	speaks	to	the	incredible	benefits	opened	up	by	the	technology.	And	even	more	lacking	is
dismissal	of	the	critical	information	which	his	"extensive	due	diligence"	certainly	must	have	revealed.	No	mention	of
the	World	Food	program	18	country	win	or	the	next	80	country	tender	coming.	No	mention	of	the	Mastercard
relationship.	Ueps's	implementation	had	an	almost	unreal	impact	on	MC's	market	penetration	in	S	Africa	and	that	is	a
fact	that	due	diligence	would	reveal.	No	factual	mention	of	the	partnering	and	multi	million	investment	in	One	Credit
Bank	in	Nigeria,	no	mention	of	the	Partnering	and	multi	million	investment	in	Transact	24	and	their	relationships	with
Alipay,	Tencent	and	Union	Pay,	no	mention	of	a	growing	relationship	with	Microsoft,	bitcoin,	or	Uber.	Its	the	"selective
hearing"	that	is	as	revealing	as	the	facts	as	to	the	intent	of	the	author.	
Clearly	I	don't	know	where	the	stock	price	is	going.	But	equally	clear	is	that	this	is	no	longer	just	a	sassa	story	and	that
will	rid	the	company	of	the	concentration	risk	and	theater	that	is	the	S	African	contract.	And	equally	clear	is	the
benefits	of	the	financial	platform	that	the	company	has	so	ingeniously	developed	and	at	the	end	of	the	day	that	is	train
coming	down	the	tracks.

I	agree,	but	what	Yoon	would	likely	say	tot	e	first	point	is	that	the	revenue	generation	away	from	SASSA	is	in
their	financial	inclusion	and	zazoo	products,	and	those,	according	to	him,	are	derivatives	of	SASSA.	So	there
really	hasn't	been	any	movement	away	from	SASSA.


Now,	I	believe	that	the	company	HAS	moved	away	from	SASSA,	but	there	is	a	risk	that	Jay	is	potentially
correct	here.
