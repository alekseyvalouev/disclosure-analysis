BBSI: Tick-Tick
Boom
Oct. 29, 2014 9:19 AM ET9 comments | Includes: Barrett Bâ€¦


After the close on 10/28/2014, BBSI reported a net loss of $5.27 per share,
driven by an $80 million pretax increase in workers' comp reserves. In our
previous report "Barrett Business Services (NASDAQ:BBSI): A Tick-Tick-
Ticking Time Bomb" we highlighted the systematic overstatement of earnings
due to persistent under accruing of workers' comp reserves. We also
highlighted the consistent trend of prior period adjustments, which in our
opinion, blatantly violated U.S. GAAP accounting rules. The result of the
accounting irregularities was a further overstatement of earnings. BBSI's $80
million pretax charge effectively wipes out the past five years of pretax
earnings. Further, the charge represents a 70% increase in workers'
compensation reserves compared to Q2'14. Said another way, our thesis that
BBSI has been writing economically unprofitable business (despite reporting
accounting profits) over the past few years, now appears incontrovertible.


As we highlighted in our original report, most of BBSI's sell-side analysts had
minimal insurance experience. As such, it our understanding the sell-side has
been relying on management's commentary to shape responses to our original
report. We believe the sell-side has been suggesting to institutional clients that
a charge between $5 and $10 million was a possibility. Considering the $80
million bombshell BBSI just dropped, it is understandable that the previously
promotional analysts may feel slightly misled. Further, in no way, does this
charge reset past mistakes.


Demonstrating management's condescending treatment of the investment
community, they provided an "adjusted EPS" figure that excludes the all-
important reserve charge. Make no mistake, the reserve charge reflects a
true-up for years of pre-tax earnings that were overstated. To "adjust" out the
most important and volatile cost of BBSI's business is akin to a utility
excluding its cost of generating electricity.

Even more disturbing, management provided a 12-month revenue outlook that
included high single-digit same store sales growth, despite apparently having
minimal basis to conclude the business they are underwriting is even
profitable. It is clear to us that this management team has limited visibility
into its insurance exposure. Management's suggestion that they will continue
to grow exposure despite having no ability to ensure that exposure is even
profitable, unequivocally tells us BBSI management is more concerned with
investor perception than right-sizing its future liabilities.


On top of the catastrophic reserve charge is BBSI's disclosure that "several
quarters" of "normalized" claims data will be necessary to "provide a clearer
indication of potential liability." Despite a previously unimaginable $80 million
charge, BBSI management appears to be confessing that future reserve
increases may still be needed. The culmination of all of this "sudden" bad
news appears to be BBSI's disclosure that it has entered into
discussions with its bank to "meet the liquidity needs of the
company." Based on our analysis, much of which was shared in our original
report, we would not be surprised if BBSI had insufficient cash to collateralize
its business with ACE. By extension, we believe the $80 million charge (with
more seemingly to come) could result in ACE re-evaluating its fronting
arrangement with BBSI. Despite the concerning statement regarding liquidity,
BBSI still had the audacity to buy a token amount of stock, for reasons we can
only guess are perception-based.


After the $80 million reserve charge, BBSI's shareholders' equity has been
reduced to a paltry $4.80 per share, while tangible equity declined to a
NEGATIVE $13.4 million. While we look forward to hearing their strategy to
address any liquidity challenges, it is our opinion that BBSI may ultimately
require a distressed equity raise.


It seems clear to us that management was very much aware of the
implications of its reserve deficiencies. Between its "pro-forma" report, token
buyback, completely irresponsible growth projections, and "off-line"
discussions with sell-side analysts, our guess is that many investors will see
through the ruse. Unfortunately, investors were not given the opportunity to
sell after-hours. Past earnings reports had been released by BBSI
approximately 10 minutes after the market had closed (4:10 PM ET). Perhaps
a mere coincidence, but with a high probability of pissed-off analysts and

distraught shareholders, we believe management again displayed poor
judgment by waiting until 8:17 PM ET to release its report - after most
investors had gone home and after-hours trading had stopped.


In our original report, we generously reached a $29 fair value estimate for
BBSI, which assumed BBSI DID NOT take a massive reserve charge. With an
$80 million charge, an opaque suggestion of liquidity issues, and shredded
credibility, it would not surprise us to see an SEC accounting inquiry and/or
justifiable class action lawsuits. Considering all of our past concerns, combined
with the possibility of legal woes, we think the probability of BBSI being a zero
is now well north of zero.

Good work on the follow up note guys, and
congratulations on the successful short.

Tip of the hat. Given the debt the company
is going to be required to take on to fund
the ACE agreement, I think your $0
estimate may not be far off...

I think at some point, ACE decides that
they won't renew the contract. That would
be the killer.

I work in the CA workers compensation
market. BBSI has generally been a very
aggressive competitor of ours. The CA
market as a whole on average is producing
results estimated to be 88% for AY 2013

(http://bit.ly/1tDyUyu). Is BBSI producing
an "average" (or better) book of business?
My anecdotal experience of having
competed with them is that they are
aggressive. I'd find it hard to believe they
are producing an "average" book of
business price-wise. So is it reasonable to
assume they can even generate an AY
2013 88% loss ratio?


There might be some folks who argue that
WC is a small portion of their overall
offering. But how else do they monetize
their operations other than when they sell
a WC and PEO policy? I've asked that
before and no one seems to want to
acknowledge that BBSI's monetization
mechanism is through selling that
policy/peo service once-a-year the same
way other insurance companies do. And if I
am right about my anecdotal experience
(i.e., them being aggressive) - how does
the price they put out there not only cover
their insurance expense but also the PEO
services they use to get people in the
door? And how does their aggressive price
markedly beat the AY 2013 loss ratio of
88% to produce a profitable portfolio?

Hi Robert,


I'm new to the workers' comp industry
and I am trying to do some research on
BBSI. Per your link, I understand the
average indemnity claim is around
$88k/claim. If I assume that ~49,000
of their employees work in California
and 50% of them have claims at
$70,000/claim (lower than the
$88,000)...that implies $1.7B in
potential workers' comp

liabilities...seeing that BBSI generated
$2.7B in gross PEO sales in 2013 has
me worried.


Is that the right way to look at it?

The average indemnity claim in
California is 86,845 per the WCIRB
(http://bit.ly/1tDyUyu).


For instance, if you look at the WCIRB
product (AC1750E2011) you'll see the
indemnity claim frequency by
classification for policy year 2006-2008
(yes, old, but still a reasonable starting
point). [Note, in order to get this data
you'll need to buy it from the WCIRB.]
You can use the credibility-weighted
average weekly wage in combination
with the total indemnity frequency and
come up with a reasonable estimate of
the number of employees working full-
time that it would take to generate a
single indemnity claim. The data varies
by class (in other words, some classes
of business will generate more claims
per $1M of exposure than others). If
you review that data just keep in mind
that the data is expressed in terms of
$1M of exposure... take a hypothetical
class of business where the workers
make $50,000 a year - a total of $1M of
exposure is 20 employees. Again,
hypothetically, if there was 1 indemnity
claim per $1M of exposure given the
example I illustrated above that would
translate to 1 out of the 20 employees
suffering an indemnity claim ON
AVERAGE. To my knowledge, no
classification in California has an

aggregate frequency close to the 50%
you ask about.


That said, part of the reason why the
"average indemnity" claim cost is so
high is because frequency is "low."
There are indemnity claims that cost
less than $2,000, but there are
indemnity claims that cost many
millions of dollars. This severity should
also vary by class of business.


I don't believe you have enough
information on-hand to do the
calculation you are trying to do. You'd
really need to understand the total
exposure (payroll) that BBSI has per
class (or maybe hazard group), you'd
need to understand whether their
frequency is higher or lower vs. the
benchmark, you'd need to know how
their severity profile compares vs. the
benchmark, how their reinsurance
impacts the calculation, etc.


One other point, I could be badly
mistaken, but the $2.7B in gross PEO
sales you reference (I didn't verify) is
probably inclusive of the payroll they
take in as a pass-through to their co-
employees. That's a shaky figure to use
as 'revenue' as you'd also need to
contemplate the very significant
'expense' of paying that payroll to the
co-employees as well.


Anyway, long-story-short, your
expected claim frequency appears way
too high. There are other variables at
play (i.e., the average indemnity claim
is aggregate across the entire industry,
etc.) and, as such, your conclusion is
likely leading you way off.

This was extremely helpful, Robert,
thank you!


BBSI's gross margin has been trending
down for the past few years, and
perhaps this may support your idea that
BBSI is the more "aggressive"
competitor.
