Summary


Janssen removed imetelstat from its earnings presentations starting in 3Q 2017 and
has not included it in its 2018 earnings presentations.


The company has omitted imetelstat from its “Key Events in 2018” presentation.


We believe imetelstat’s elimination and omission from Janssen’s presentation
materials is an indication that the company is likely to terminate its collaboration
agreement in 3Q 2018.


In this article, we seek to dispel six key myths surrounding imetelstat that Geron
bulls tout, starting with the belief that Geron will announce more IMbark data in May.


Janssen has removed or omitted imetelstat from key presentation
materials


We believe Geron (NASDAQ:GERN) bulls are missing a key piece of evidence that
suggests to us that Janssen (NYSE:JNJ) is likely to terminate its licensing agreement for
imetelstat. In every Johnson & Johnson (Janssen’s parent) quarterly earnings
presentation, Janssen provides a slide that highlights its key strategic partnerships. In the
past, Janssen included imetelstat in this slide, as seen in the 1Q 2017 presentation in
slide 5. However, after the negative July 31, 2017, imetelstat update which caused
Geron’s share price to fall more than 15%, Janssen removed imetelstat from its Strategic
Partnerships slide starting in 3Q 2017 (slide 5).


We believe this is a key indication that Janssen is likely to terminate its collaboration and
licensing agreement for imetelstat in the third quarter of 2018. If it was likely to opt into the
imetelstat licensing agreement, then we believe imetelstat would be prominently

highlighted in Janssen’s earnings presentations. However, the opposite is true. Imetelstat
has been removed entirely from the company’s presentation. In fact, imetelstat has not
been in any of Janssen’s earnings presentations in 3Q 2017, 4Q 2017, or 1Q 2018.


Furthermore, imetelstat is not in the company’s “Key Events in 2018” presentation for its
pharmaceutical pipeline. It had been included in the “Key Events in 2017” presentation in
2017, as can be seen in slide 25.

We believe this is another important omission. First, it suggests that Janssen is not
planning on presenting additional IMbark data as some Geron bulls claim. This was
confirmed to us by Johnson & Johnson’s IR team via email: “In 2018, we do not yet have
confirmed information on imetelstat data to be presented which is why it is not yet on our
charts for 2018.”


We also believe imetelstat’s exclusion in the Key Events in 2018 slide shows that Janssen
is unlikely to file for any form of accelerated approval for imetelstat as some on Seeking
Alpha have postulated. For example, in this article, the author claims that imetelstat may
receive accelerated approval in 2Q-4Q 2018. Since it is excluded from both the “Planned
Submissions” and “Potential Clinical Data Presentations” sections, we believe these
beliefs are unfounded.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId15.png
The same Seeking Alpha author who we believe is wrong on imetelstat’s accelerated
approval possibility also points to its inclusion in Janssen’s Late Stage Pipeline
presentation as evidence that the company is going to opt into the imetelstat licensing
agreement. However, we would point out that imetelstat has been excluded from two out
of three Janssen presentations, among which reference to it was removed from the
quarterly earnings presentation after imetelstat developed negatively last year. We believe
the evidence is on our side.


Dispelling the major myths behind Geron and imetelstat


We want to address what we believe are the main misconceptions around imetelstat and
misinterpretations of the data provided on IMbark so far by Geron and Janssen. We
believe this will go a long way toward supporting our views on Imetelstat’s likely failure
and its dim future prospects.


Misconception #1: Geron and Janssen are announcing more data
from IMbark in May



http://www.investor.jnj.com/_document/johnson-johnson-pipeline-q1-2018?id=00000162-d33e-d077-af7a-fbff592e0000
There appears to be a belief that Geron and Janssen will announce additional data in the
coming months, as seen in this earlier article from last week which states that the IMbark
trial “will report interim data in less than two months,” and in this comment which states
that the “real catalyst will be the results of IMbark phase 2 data expected in May.”


This expectation of upcoming IMbark data is misguided. At the 17th Annual Needham
Healthcare Conference on March 27 (20:15 mark), Geron’s CEO John Scarlett stated,
“We do not anticipate at the moment or expect to have any planned data delivery or
revelations between now and the time that Janssen will make their continuation decision.”


Geron bulls who are anticipating news are likely to be disappointed by the lack of an
update.


Misconception #2: The 4.7mg/kg arm may be effective


We’re not sure how bulls make this leap, because Geron has stated multiple times that the
low-dose 4.7mg/kg arm is one with an inactive dose of imetelstat. It’s essentially placebo.
In the September 2016 press release, the company noted, “Activity in the 4.7 mg/kg
dosing arm does not warrant further investigation of that dose and this arm will be closed
to new patient enrollment.”



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4163044-geron-corporation-improved-industry-tailwinds-can-help-imetelstat

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId22.png
That’s not all. In the conference call held that same day, Geron President and CEO Chip
Scarlett said, “In the 4.7 milligram per kilogram arm, there was clearly inadequate activity
at 12 weeks and the data suggested that additional time on drug would not result in an
adequate response at 24 weeks. For that reason, this arm is being closed to further
patient enrolments effective today.”


In other words, the 4.7mg/kg arm failed early, and that arm of the study was stopped.


Later on the call, Chip Scarlett even tried to put a positive spin on the failure of the
4.7mg/kg arm. He said, “I'd just like to say that, I wasn't particularly sorry to see the dose
adjustment on the 4.7 milligrams per kilogram. That was always thought to be quite a low
dose that was going to be the minimum dose required to engage telomerase. And, I think,
the fact that it was found to be inadequate is not a failure of any nature.”


Furthermore, Geron stated on the recent 4Q 2017 conference call that a “meaningful
number of patients” remained in the 4.7mg/kg arm after it was discontinued and did not
cross over to the higher 9.7mg/kg arm dose. These statements lead us to believe that the
4.7mg/kg arm is, in essence, serving as a placebo/control arm within the trial, even though
there was no placebo group in the trial protocol. As a result, we believe if the 9.4mg/kg
dose arm had any activity, it should perform better than the 4.7mg/kg arm.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157606-gerons-gern-ceo-john-scarlett-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId24.png
Therefore, when Geron stated in the March 16 press release that both arms had not
reached median overall survival after 19 months of follow up, we believed this supported
our view that the high-dose 9.4mg/kg imetelstat arm has not provided a meaningful
survival benefit, since it has performed in line with what is essentially a placebo arm. This
supports our assertion that the patient population enrolled in IMbark likely skewed healthy
due to the inclusion criteria of the trial, since both arms are acting in a similar fashion. How
else could one explain how it is that the ineffective 4.7mg/kg “placebo” arm still hasn’t
reached median overall survival after median follow-up of 19 months?


Misconception #3: Imetelstat has shown signs of traditional
efficacy


This is another puzzle to us, because Geron has explicitly stated that both arms failed to
show signs of efficacy on the primary endpoints, and it has not provided any indication of
success on other endpoints. The company stated first that the 4.7mg/kg arm showed
“inadequate activity” in September 2016 as we outlined above, and then in April 2017,
Geron stated that the 9.4mg/kg arm missed one of its co-primary endpoints of greater than
35% reduction in spleen volume.


Specifically, the release states, “In these relapsed or refractory MF patients treated in the
9.4 mg/kg dosing arm, the spleen volume response rate observed to date was less than
that reported in front-line MF patients treated in trials with other drugs.” We know that
Jakafi’s spleen volume response volume reduction rate is 35%, from its two pivotal Phase
3 studies (see page 8 of the PDF, Figure 1).


In essence, Geron is indirectly stating that the 9.4mg/kg arm missed its co-primary
endpoint of a 35% reduction in spleen volume by saying the response rate was lower than
Incyte's (NASDAQ:INCY) drug Jakafi’s known 35% spleen volume reduction rate (average
of 42% and 29% shown in COMFORT1 and COMFORT2). We believe this is a soft way of
saying the 9.4mg/kg arm failed its co-primary endpoint. Perhaps this is why bulls believe
there might be some efficacy.


However, Geron clearly states that the 9.4mg/kg missed the spleen volume reduction
endpoint, and that enrollment was stopped in October because both arms failed to reach
“protocol-defined interim criteria at 12 weeks” in the company’s latest slide presentation
from the 17  Annual Needham Healthcare Conference on March 27. To be clear, weth

https://geron.gcs-web.com/static-files/ca05a3fd-4941-453c-ae3b-a36d87a2603b
believe that Geron is saying the 9.4mg/kg arm failed to show sufficient efficacy at an
interim look, and that the failure at an interim analysis was the reason that trial enrollment
was suspended.


Remember, the primary endpoint of IMbark is not survival. The co-primary endpoints are
>35% spleen size reduction and 50% reduction in total symptom score. Think about it for a
minute. Geron and Janssen haven’t enrolled a patient in IMbark since October 2016.
Based on this timeline, we believe Janssen has had the results for the 24-week co-primary
endpoints of spleen volume reduction and total symptom score improvement since 1H
2017. If imetelstat was as effective as the Geron bulls claim, doesn’t one think Janssen
and Geron would have informed the public? Wouldn’t Janssen have opted in already,
which it could have done at any time?


However, Geron hasn’t provided any data on the primary endpoints since September 2016
despite multiple updates and amendments to the trial. As we pointed out above, we
believe Geron and Janssen have had the data for nearly a full year now. If they had a drug
that worked and showed great responses, we believe they would have published the
results by now. We believe the lack of disclosure indicates that imetelstat failed to show
signs of efficacy against both co-primary endpoints.



http://ir.geron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/geron-provides-update-imetelstat-trials-being-conducted-janssen?ID=2201055&c=67323&p=irol-newsArticle

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId33.png
Geron and Janssen have also not released other basic information, such as how many
patients remain on imetelstat; what other therapies patients have taken after discontinuing
imetelstat; duration of treatment on imetelstat; the baseline characteristics of patients; and
how many patients in the 4.7mg/kg arm elected to receive the higher 9.4mg/kg dose once
the low dose arm was closed. While disclosing this information isn’t required, we have
observed companies with positive data have released similar data in the past.


Yet, without this very basic information, bulls breathlessly exclaim that imetelstat is
effective and sure to become a blockbuster treatment for myelofibrosis (MF).


Lastly, if imetelstat were effective, then we believe Janssen would have started a pivotal
trial by now. After all, based upon the timeline for the trial, we believe the company has
had the full data set for almost a year now. Instead, Janssen appears to be waiting until
the last possible second to make a decision, which we believe will be to terminate the
licensing agreement and return imetelstat to Geron.


Misconception #4: Showing efficacy on spleen volume reduction
and total symptom score improvement isn’t necessary


Some Geron bulls brush aside the lack of efficacy on the primary endpoints, but we’re not
sure why. We believe that the FDA values both spleen volume reduction and an
improvement in total symptom score when assessing treatment options for myelofibrosis.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId36.png
First, we have reviewed the literature, and it shows that the primary endpoints of
myelofibrosis studies are nearly always spleen volume reduction and/or total symptom
score improvement. We haven’t seen any clinical trials where these two endpoints weren’t
considered.


Notable studies that used spleen volume reduction as the primary endpoint include
Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) JAK2 pivotal studies against Best Available Therapy and
against Jakafi; TargeGen/Sanofi’s (NASDAQ:SNY) drug for myelofibrosis which was
acquired by Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) earlier this year; and Sanofi’s original pivotal
JAKARTA study for SAR302503.


In fact, spleen volume reduction is such an important endpoint that the FDA has accepted
it as the basis for a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). CTI BioPharma’s
(NASDAQ:CTIC) recent PERSIST-2 trial for pacritinib in both first- and second-line
myelofibrosis with low platelet counts was granted an SPA using spleen volume reduction
and total symptom score improvement as co-primary endpoints. We believe this meant
that the FDA said CTI BioPharma’s trial protocol and endpoints were acceptable for FDA
approval and what it wanted to see in a trial for myelofibrosis.


We believe our research shows that bulls who claim that imetelstat can get approved on
surrogate endpoints are wrong. There is a sound basis for why clinical trials are focused
on improvement in spleen volume and a decrease in symptoms: they are treating the
disease. Spleen size is the key primary endpoint in myelofibrosis ​precisely because it
means the drug is affecting the underlying pathology of the disease.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4164027-johnson-and-johnson-reaffirms-gerons-imetelstat-lead-oncology-pipeline-drug
Our research also leads us to believe that Geron bulls are making a mistake by ignoring
imetelstat’s failure on its primary endpoints in the IMbark trial and solely basing their
hopes on a survival benefit. That’s like saying if you’re suffering from a life-threatening
infection, a drug can help you live longer but it won’t do anything to improve your infection.
That’s the leap of faith that Geron bulls make that we fundamentally disagree with.


Misconception #5: Greater than 20 months OS is unprecedented or
impossible


Despite the company stating that the low-dose 4.7mg/kg arm was ineffective and that the
high-dose 9.4mg/kg arm failed to meet its spleen volume reduction primary endpoint,
Geron bulls have clung to the hope that imetelstat’s seemingly long median overall
survival will show it has efficacy. However, we believe these bulls fail to take into account
IMbark’s trial protocol, which excludes very sick patients. Clinical studies and academic
papers repeatedly show that a healthy MF patient population can have very high survival
times, in line with or longer than what the IMbark trial is currently seeing.


In our previous Seeking Alpha article, we showed that the MD Anderson chart review
indicated that one can have mOS of 36 months if you exclude people with platelet counts
<100k. We believe this patient population is more similar to the IMbark patient population
than the very sick <100k platelet population which included patients with severely low
platelet counts.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/4158269-gerons-negative-imetelstat-data-misinterpreted-investors

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId43.png
Another dataset presented by Geron and Janssen showed another instance of very high
mOS that we believe is relevant. Adam Feuerstein highlighted this in his article titled, “The
top-performing biotech stock this year has surged on flimsy data.” At ASH 2016, Janssen
presented a poster with results of a commercial claims database and showed that the
mOS of all MF patients who discontinued or failed Jakafi was 7 months. Geron bulls claim
this is the relevant population and mOS statistic for imetelstat.


It’s important to read the fine print. Janssen states that of this population, 85% received no
further treatment. Please see the highlighted section below.



https://www.statnews.com/2018/03/27/geron-stock-price-surge/

http://www.geron.com/file.cfm/53/docs/Mehra-JJ-MF-ASH-2016.pdf

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId45.png
We believe these patients likely received no further treatment because they were too sick
to receive a second line of therapy. In other words, and in our opinion, these are the types
of patients who would have been excluded from the IMbark trial for being too sick due to
the inclusion and exclusion criteria which kept out patients with ECOG scores greater than
2 and those with peripheral blood blast counts of >=10%, which are negative
prognosticators. We believe IMbark enrolled healthier patients because imetelstat is a
known hepatotoxic drug and posed a risk to sicker patients.


If you look at the upper right hand side of the same poster, you’ll notice there is a chart of
patients who were healthy enough to receive a second line of treatment. We believe the
relevant line is the blue line. These are MF patients who had Jakafi, discontinued or
progressed, and then received Jakafi again. Like imetelstat, Jakafi has significant safety
issues. Therefore, these patients had to have been healthy enough to receive Jakafi
again, which we believe would’ve resulted in similar inclusion criteria as IMbark. You can
see in this patient population, they had mOS of 30 months.



https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02426086

https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/fda-places-geron-s-imetelstat-on-clinical-hold-due-to-hepatotoxicity-0001

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId49.png
We have now shown two datasets that we believe have a similar patient population as the
IMbark trial. It is pretty clear to us that patients who are able to receive a second line of
therapy after Jakafi tend to be healthier, and we believe that this was the population that
was enrolled in the IMbark trial. To us, this best explains the “longer-than-expected” mOS
times and explains why the inactive 4.7mg/kg arm also is outperforming survival
expectations for a control group.


Misconception #6: Survival data is the most important endpoint


In spite of all the evidence, there are some bulls that disregard the lack of efficacy on the
primary endpoints and don’t believe the patient population in the imetelstat study skews
healthy. These bulls claim that survival is most important and are solely focused on that
secondary endpoint. We agree with the bulls that survival is important for patients with
myelofibrosis. However, we do not believe it is a relevant endpoint in a single-arm, open-
label study like IMbark, where progressing patients are allowed to pursue other therapies.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/4/959452_15246810508614_rId52.png
This is relevant because suppose a patient took Jakafi and discontinued/progressed, then
took imetelstat as part of IMbark, then progressed and went on to take a treatment like
thalidomide and had a response to it. In this scenario, the data will show a prolonged mOS
in the IMbark trial, but it is likely due to thalidomide and not imetelstat. That’s why it is so
important to know what patients did after imetelstat. Without that data, we have no idea
what may be behind the mOS, if one believes it’s due to a drug effect.


We want to point out that there are numerous available options for MF patients after
Jakafi. Thalidomide has been shown to have a high response rate of 30.8% in patients
who were not responsive to standard treatment. Lenalidomide has also shown promising
effects, and we know that both continue to be used as second-line therapy, as per a 2017
Blood journal article, which showed that 17% of second-line therapy MF patients received
lenalidomide and another 17% received thalidomide. In the article, both agents had good
response rates. Other options include interferon, melphalan, imatinib, and Vidaza. We
want to point out that many of these were investigated in studies that used more stringent
response criteria of >=50% reduction in spleen size, versus IMbark’s 35% spleen volume
reduction threshold. Lastly, for some MF patients, stem cell transplants can be curative.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11986248

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18385750
In essence, we believe that one cannot draw conclusions on the top line mOS number
from the IMbark trial because there is not enough information (e.g., what treatments
patients received after progressing on imetelstat). We believe the only conclusion one can
come to, given the information, is that the 9.4mg/kg arm is working about as well as the
4.7mg/kg arm. Given that Geron indicated that the 4.7mg/kg arm is inactive, we conclude
that the 9.4mg/kg arm must be inactive as well.


We are short Geron


In this article, we showed how Janssen has stopped highlighting Geron’s imetelstat in two
out of its three presentation materials. We believe this is a sign that Janssen is likely to
terminate its licensing agreement for imetelstat in the third quarter of 2018.


We also provided our opinion on what we perceive to be six major misconceptions by
Geron bulls. We showed why we think the bulls claiming the IMbark trial will read out in
May are wrong. We shared evidence that neither of IMbark’s treatment arms has shown
signs of efficacy on the co-primary endpoints of spleen volume reduction and total
symptom score improvement, which are the most important endpoints in myelofibrosis
trials. We also showed why we think that a median overall survival of around 20 months is
not unprecedented and should be expected in a relatively healthy population, such as that
in the IMbark trial. Lastly, we explained why we believe the secondary endpoint of survival
is not relevant in a single-arm, open-label trial such as IMbark.


We believe our research is exhaustive and shows that imetelstat is ineffective and likely
has no positive impact on survival.


We are short Geron, and our price target remains $0.51.

this article is so disgraceful it has divorced itself from reality.

Alpha Exposure, well here it is September 5th and GERN having just breached 6.20. Janssen has posted job
openings to market Imetelstat, they are offering imetelstat for compassionate use, and on September 13th they
have scheduled an unprecedented announcement to their pharma pipeline. The EHA granted Janssen a oral
presentation of imetelstat's the amazing results at the last meeting and all indications are that JNJ is going to
either continue developing imetelstat or completely buy out Geron. So my question to you is >>>> Any regrets ??

The odds for an IMBARK phase 3 (based on what we know) is virtually nil.
I give alot more weight to a P2/P3 Frontline MF on the horizon if IMBARK catches wings.

Bill, true enough but why would a company with the reputation of a Janssen say that unless they had substantial
reason to believe it to be true. I just don't think they make statements like that unless they think it so. bp

you wouldn't need one. Not to mention the pre specified death thing. Was median OS even reached? They sure
saw something early to know the 4.7 arm should be abandoned in favor of the higher dose. The absence of BTD
or AA does not preclude APPROVAL and we know the FDA has been following with interest. bp

Of course AA is not "impossible", IF JNJ has even applied for it. But we have no evidence at all that our
flying saucer isn't just a comet that's going to impoact us with a gigaton-equivalent explosion.


As far as "why do a Phase 2 if it isn't going to work", you know the answer... most trials fail. Only 7% of
Phase 2 drugs make it.

You should of always known there was no P3 planned in IMBARK. That was never the plan and never the
design. They hoped to get acceleration. They hoped to move to a frontline MF story as well. As far as I'm
concerned, that story still is in play. On the contrary, IMERGE was always a P2/P3 design plan. Why all
the nonsense ?


05 Jun 2018, 07:59 PM


telomerase
The "nonsense" is claiming that we have a slam dunk for AA, when the CEO hasn't even promised that
he's going to try to get to Phase 3. We are all FAR more optimistic than company management.


But don't convince me, convince the mutual funds and the shorts.... There's over $160 million betting on
trial failures here. Why are we so much more brilliant than the smart money? That's always been the
question we couldn't answer as we wait for the day that never comes... (I'm not actually that pessimistic,
but I have to work in a foreign-policy reference occassionally ;)

One other point, Janssen has consistently listed Imetelstat as a pipeline drug in presentations over the
past few years with filing for MF planned in 2019. Now how is it they would be planning to file with out a
phase III unless (again) they knew they wouldn't need one? bp

bp, they can "plan" to file, and then not get good enough results in the trial. Even in a Phase 3 that they're
doing by themselves, let alone a Phase 2 where they're using our money.

The whole Janssen setup in IMBARK is obviously positioned by design for an AA method. That's why
there was never a phase 3 design for IMBARK. Why else conduct just a phase 2 with no plans or design
for a phase 3. Scarlet is almost like all of us waiting to hear good news. He's not calling the IMBARK
shots. Only Janssen and the FDA is in charge.

I am perplexed as to how you have concluded the MF data is poor. That flies in the face of everything we know: 1.
unprecedented CR and PRs 2. Heretofore unseen extensions in MOS. 3. A broad range of spleen and symptom
responses in end stage patients. Things are quiet because we are dealing with professionals who understand the
need for proper presentation of scientific information as well as the care required to obtain FDA approval. bp

telomerase
bp, we all drank the "imminent BTD" kool-aid a long time ago. But you can see why non-cultists would be
hesitant to get on our flying saucer... there never was BTD or AA, the CEO said repeatedly that "there is
no plan for Phase 3 in MF", and the CEO just diluted the stock at an average price of $3.70. Oh, and the
CEO did finally start promoting the drug... as an MDS treatment, using Raza to present.


Most of our MF case is based on MTB's report of the shadow of Chipthulhu's "smile" when he rose from
sunken R'lyeh for the annual meeting. MTB is a smart guy and could be right, but it shouldn't be shocking
to meet non-believers. Just keep handing them our pamphlets, of course:

telo, please, not one of your meltdown melodramas again.


The case for MF is based on survival advantage, noted "range of spleen responses", symptom reduction
and known activity of the drug in producing CRs/PRs in the frontline pilot. Do you really think Janssen is
toying about by extending the trial to assess survival benefit ? They noted survival benefit as early as April

2017.


The main weakness in Imbark is that it is not an RCT. So, the FDA could be adamant about OS advantage
having to be proven in RCTs (despite rare exceptions where historical control was permitted). However,
the dose-response design of Imbark is a savior here. If the survival curve and/or other responses of the
9.4 dose turns out to be superior to the 4.7 dose, it can support approval on its own.


Given that median hasn't been reached in either dose, I believe the extension was required to let the
survival curves diverge further. In this regard, the pre-specified number of deaths being reached 2 months
earlier could be a very good sign if the deaths happened in the 4.7 dose.

Thank goodness for the new article.
This is the reply from Disputes at Alpha. I don't consider this interpretation. The article's title smacks of yellow
journalism. Such stupidity. 
Thank you for providing links.


The facts the author cites in this article are that imetelstat is missing from the "key strategic partnerships" slide of
the most recent earnings presentation (where it was included in prior quarters) and the "key events for 2018" slide
(it was previously included in "key events for 2017" in prior earnings presentations). The author points out
imetelstat has not been included in J&J's earnings presentations for Q4 2017 or Q1 2018. As far as I can tell, this
is true.

https://seekingalpha.com/user/43474006

https://seekingalpha.com/user/231478

https://seekingalpha.com/user/6339491
Imetelstat does appear on the IR website on a document called "Late Stage Pipeline." That is a separate
document, not an earnings presentation, and does not invalidate the author's statements of fact.


The dispute here boils down to a difference of interpretation. The author interprets the omission of imetelstat from
the two latest earnings presentations as a sign the partnership has ceased or will cease, despite its inclusion in the
pipeline document. You interpret its inclusion in the pipeline document as a sign that the partnership is intact,
despite imetelstat's removal from earnings presentations. And differences of interpretation are not covered under
our disputes process.

In early April I wrote an email letter to Geron development management after bears Alpha Exposure and Adam F.

great research results in MDS and AML plus huge potential in the combo program for IMET, I also mentioned
these two bear attacks regarding MF and asked Geron to respond. So far, Geron has not respond. This may be
understandable since JNJ is doing the research on MF for Geron and I am only one share holder. Now, Alpha
Exposure is spreading false rumors that Geron is separated from JNJ. Since those bear attacks, Geron stock has
fall from 6.68 to 3.31. I strongly urge all long Geron share holders, especially all of us who make supporting
comments regarding Geron to email or write letters to Geron management and share holder relations to complain
about false rumors about separation. I believe when a large number of Geron share holders complain about this
separation rumor, Geron may respond publicly! After all, the separation rumor is not true, it hurts all Geron long
holders as well as Geron management. I urge all Geron holders to unite and become a force. I want to thank all

The leading and ONLY approved drug for MF is jakafi.jakavi which has a very short life span and is not
curative. Even as a single agent, IMET has demonstrated curative properties which is the most
competitive attribute you could hope for. JNJ is not sitting on their hands for going frontline therapy in MF
as they better understand the MOA and combos. If they capture backlne R/R MF, then frontline will happen
but could also involve a combo therapy.

Excellent, accurate article. I agree Imetelstat has no substantial future for the treatment of myelofibrosis due to its
ho hum efficacy and excessive toxicity. This is not my opinion - it is the opinion of the top myelofibrosis specialists
in the USA (Dr. Raza is not a myelofibrosis specialist). The Geron bulls cannot name multiple myelofibrosis
specialists that have made public statements during the past 2 years expressing enthusiasm about the potential of
imetelstat to replace Jakafi as a first line treatment for myelofibrosis.


P.S. I am not an Incyte investor or troll - I'm an opportunistic investor just like most everyone else. I think Imetelstat
has some limited potential for a small subset of MF patients with certain uncommon mutations and maybe for a
larger subset IF used in combination with other existing drugs - but such combos may be so wildly expensive they
won't be widely prescribed.

What are the names of these ‘top myelofibrosis specialists in the USA’?


The only one I know is the world renowned Dr Ayelew Tefferi MD. A specialist in hematology who has
been practicing for 38 years.


He is Professor of Hematology and Internal Medicine and Section Head for Leukemia and Proliferative
Disorders of Hematic Cells, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine


Prof Tefferi has 800 publications including books, book chapters, original articles, reviews, editorials,
letters, and abstracts. Tefferi serves as an associate or section editor for the Mayo Clinic Proceedings,
Leukemia, American Journal of Hematology, and European Journal of Hematology. His research involves
clinical and laboratory research in myeloid disorders including acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid
disorders.


And his view of imetelstat is as follows;


"We observed that imetelstat was active and induced morphologic and molecular remissions in some
patients with myelofibrosis,"
"We also observed that imetelstat demonstrated selective anticlonal activity, inhibiting the growth of cancer
cells, which we had not previously documented with other drugs."


In fact the results were so impressive, he called it ‘tantamount to a cure’.


So, which other specialists support your claims? I look forward to reading about them.


https://mayocl.in/1jfR5So


He also called the non-hematological toxicity ‘trivial’


http://bit.ly/2vQLTXb


He also mentions that used as the current dosing regimen (ie not weekly) toxicity is not an issue or
problem.


Your claims are not the same as this top myleofibrosis specialist, certainly not on the ‘ho-hum efficacy’ and
‘excessive toxicity’. 
Do you have any facts to back up these claims or is it just speculation?


27 Apr 2018, 05:33 AM

PaulC-if you are not an Incyte investor or a troll then are you a GERN short? I ask because you post on

who's backers would like to think they have potential to replace or partially replace Jakafi as a first line
therapy for MF, but none to date look too promising with the exception of Ropeginterferon (trade name
BESREMi).


There are also lots of MPN groups on facebook where, for example, many dozens of myelofibrosis
patients discuss their current and future drug treatment options. Imetelstat is rarely mentioned as being
one of them, except for a small subset of patients that have been identified has having certain uncommon
DNA mutations.


The future of MPN & MDS treatments appears to lie in drug combination therapy. Since low dose
imetelstat is well tolerated it is certainly possible that it may have a future in low dose combinations with
other MPN and MDS drugs. Just not a future as a first line mono therapy for any MPN chronic blood
cancers (e.g. ET, PV & MF).

Going all the way back 2015 the worlds top MPN disease specialists such as the Danish ones below have
recognized imetelstat was not competitive with existing drugs for the treatment of MPN blood cancers

To the Editor


“Baerlocher et al. (Sept. 3 issue)1 report on telomere-targeted treatment with imetelstat in 18 patients with
essential thrombocythemia. The drug was effective in controlling platelet levels in all patients, albeit often
at the expense of hemoglobin and neutrophil levels. However, the other main treatment goals in essential
thrombocythemia2 — controlling symptoms and preventing both disease progression and thromboembolic
complications — were definitely not achieved. Fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea were all reported by more
than 70% of the patients. A total of 3 patients had progression to myelofibrosis, and 2 patients had a
thromboembolic event. Thus, treatment with imetelstat does not seem to be promising in this relatively
benign disease.’


Daniel El Fassi, M.D., Ph.D.

To the Editor:


“Given the toxic side effects and modest treatment response associated with imetelstat, we do not think
this drug can be considered as an alternative to interferon alfa-2, which in addition to its immune-
modulating effects is a telomerase inhibitor as well.”

Proof-of-Concept in Essential Thrombocythemia


A Phase 2 multi-center, single agent and open label trial was conducted in 18 patients with ET to provide
proof-of-concept for the potential use of imetelstat as a treatment for hematologic myeloid malignancies,
such as MF, MDS or AML. Published results (Baerlocher GM, et al. Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in
Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. N Engl J Med. 2015 Sep 3; 373(10):920-8) are summarized as
follows:
•18 of 18 patients (100%) achieved a hematologic response with a reduction in platelets, including 16 of
18 patients (89%) achieving a complete response with a normalization of platelet counts.
•The median time on therapy was 17.1 months (range: 6.9 months to 2.7 years).
•Seven out of the eight (88%) patients with a JAK2 V617F gene mutation achieved 72% to 96% reductions
in allele burden and qualified as partial molecular responses.
•MPL and CALR mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15% to 66%.



https://seekingalpha.com/user/231478
•The nature of adverse events reported were similar to those reported in other imetelstat clinical trials, with
fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic biochemistry abnormalities and cytopenias being the most
frequently observed.

Thanks for that, it is an interesting paper.
You didnt include Dr Tefferi’s response to the study which is as follows;


Dr. Tefferi replies: It is true that imetelstat may not have the side-effect profile that justifies its further
consideration for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, as reported by Baerlocher et al. However,
drug benefit–risk assessment is best accomplished in the context of randomized studies and should not be
surmised from the results of a small proof-of-concept study. The same holds true for other drugs for the
treatment of essential thrombocythemia, including interferon alfa. Treatment-induced reduction in the JAK2
or CALR mutant allele burden in patients with essential thrombocythemia has been observed with
imetelstat, interferon alfa,1 and busulfan.2 Such observations do not necessarily imply that each of these
drugs has the same effect on coexistent disease clones with different mutations3 or an advantage in terms
of meaningful health outcome; the latter requires evidence from controlled studies and not conjecture
based on local treatment practices. The observations from our pilot study of imetelstat support a unique
mechanism of action that deserves further laboratory-based investigation.
Ayalew Tefferi, M.D.


It is this unique mechanism of action that drove the further clinical studies, and led to the spectacular
results we are seeing in both Myelofibrosis and MDS.


In MDS the FDA awarded it Fast Track designation, and your concerns over efficacy and toxicity appear to
be unfounded. 
Had they been as severe as you claim it wouldn’t have gained such a status. QED.


Since this article was published Janssen has learned substantially more about imetelstat and is applying
for patents in AML (combination studies) and will soon test (if they havent already) for other indications.


There have been successful studies (warranting further investigation) in pancreatic cancer and this will
likely be further studied by Jansen.
http://bit.ly/2wjzMOg


Given the spectacular results so far in both MDS, MF, preclinical AML as well as in other cancers, the
evidence points overwhelmingly to it being efficacious and without major safety concerns.


There have been years now of studies in imetelstat and had it had ‘ho-hum toxicity’ and ‘excessive toxicity’
it would have been dropped years ago.


There is still no evidence that ‘the top myelofibrosis specialists in the USA’ have the opinion you claim.

Exactly. I didn't include it on purpose because it was just Dr. T. and I was looking further. I think we have
enough expert hematologists and scientists/oncologists under the Umbrella of JNJ/Janssen, associated
with effort being done with Dr. Lane, Dr. Raza, and now ABBIE with vent combo and a cross-section of
kissing cousing blood diseases. I mainly wanted to show the spectacular early results of 100% and 89%
with the mini ET because I hear the spouting off less significant INFN percentages and focused on easier
ET/PV INDs. The history Of Imetelstat has been consistent across ET/PV/MF/MDS/AML so far and the
quoting of old data in 2015 comparison is simply laughable.

Keep quoting old info until the new studies come out for MDS and MF and believe what you want until
then. The worlds expert in MDS says she has seen less side effects and when the drug is approved not if
the drug gets approved. I will listen to the experts too.

So PaulC, if you hit the unlucky lottery and develop MF, I take it you will go seek treatment in Denmark
rather than US?


28 Apr 2018, 11:44 AM


PaulC.
In 2014 the Danish actually pioneered the most effective and best tolerated treatment for MF known to
date: low dose pegylated interferon + low dose Jakafi combination therapy. The interferon improves the
bone marrow, helping to stabilize and sometimes reverse dropping red blood cell and hemoglobin counts
and the Jakafi helps shrink the spleen. Not a popularly prescribed treatment yet due to high cost and
because it's an off label treatment.


While Imetelstat monotherapy is not competitive with interferon monotherapy or Jakafi monotherapy for
treating MF, there is a chance it could have breakthrough benefits when combined (at low doses that don't
hurt the liver) with other existing or future drugs including interferon and Jakafi.

I'm afraid biotech is moving much faster and increasingly so since 2014. Just pay attention. INFN has had
decades upon decades to prove itself and just combining it with jakafi tells us alot. As if jakafi isn't severely
toxic ! It's discontinued very quickly because the benefits do not exceed the toxicity. Do you really think the
world of advancing diagnostics and pre-clinical combo testing is going to screw around with jakafi (other
than INCY ) for the most competitive combo ingredients ? That's a laugh. Just look how INCY is failing one
pipeline effort after another doing shot gunning rather than taking rifle shots. Better tell your Danish 2014
OG's to get with the modern times of science platforms. Also, shrinking the spleen is not advancing
medical science like shrinking of tumors.

You obviously did not read all the ASH abstracts on Interferon and Imetelstat. 1. Imetelstat achieved
results for CALR patients in a matter of months while it took Interferon 3 years to achieve those kind of
results and in smaller numbers(for Interferon). No one would ever go for approval of a drug by targeting ET
as Dr. Tefferi pointed out the trial would take 24 years to run and no one would start with PV either
because it would take about 16 years.

Taz - there's a facebook group with some highly knowledgable patients with ET and the CALR mutation.
They've carefully reviewed the Imeltestat data to date and concluded it is not competitive with pegylated
Interferon as a disease progression inhibiting drug (except for about 20% of patients that have the SF3B1
or U2AF1 mutations) which is their current drug of choice and soon to be replaced by a purer an even
more effective interferon with the generic name Ropeginterferon (trade name BESREMi).

back to 2014. Somehow you pretend to compare this to IMET that is not chasing the easier ET IND due to
the long lifetime of disease progression involved. As I already demonstrated to you, IMET grew its wings
off a mini trial with quick 100% type responses and not just based on some sub-type mutation for
molecular responses. That early ET test flight for Geron got it to the Mayo Pilot trial for more difficult and
urgent need critical patients in MF and MDS. Just because IMET is not specifically testing and chasing ET
with the sub-type CALR mutation does not in any way make old interferon or any reformulation even close
to being competitive to Imetelstat in MF.


01 May 2018, 04:07 AM


ligas3
JNJ used the preliminary data from Immerge in OCT 2017 to successfully get IMET fast tracked for MDS. That
preliminary data is known today. However, they deliberately delayed the move to P3 even though this data justified
fast tracking to further study Imetelstat in the sub group. I originally had a short thought that they were delaying the
continuation decision perhaps because they thought the MDS overall data was so so and the MF date might not
be so good. However, if they thought the preliminary Immerge data was good enough to get fast track for and fully
enrolled the P3 ahead of time, and trotted out Dr Raza to say that Imet will be used by the majority of MDS
patients, that gives me confidence that they are delaying the continuation until the MDS data on this subset is
available to see if they can get an accelerated approval or perhaps go after a Frontline treatment in MDS. Razas
comment about Imet being used up front by the majority of MDS patients is huge and leads me to believe that they
have big plans in MDS.

ligas3 the confirmation and delay of starting the phase 3 is because they will be going for frontline in MDS.

There is no separation or divorce papers filed by JNJ or Geron. The shorts are desperately trying to compose a
false divorce paper for JNJ and Geron. Very soon expensive separation and divorce papers will be served on all
shorts involuntarily (margin calls) because they ignore the great research results as well as great observations by
expert Dr. Raza regarding the MDS program, the potential of AML and combo programs regarding IMET. Even if a
divorce paper is filed by JNJ on Geron assumed by the shorts due to their false interpretations of MF research
results, Geron stock should rise up faster due to the independence if JNJ chooses to drop out. After all the MDS is
three times larger than the MF program, plus the AML and the combo programs are much much bigger than tde
MDS program!

Getting back to the real world.........The odds of some kind of formal partnership between JNJ and Abbvie has
increased. Probably the most powerful argument for Geron right now is likely in the works, a start to an AML trial
linking two of the most powerful drugs in cancer, Venetoclax and Imetelstat.


This link is what may separate the men-from-the-boys. If this combination works in AML, I wouldn't doubt whatever
success we see in MF and MDS may also be improved upon. Are solid tumors next?


This is simply one of the most important times for Geron and all stockholders.

Calling the lowest Effective dose a placebo is ridiculous. A placebo would have no effect but the 4.7 dose was the
lowest dose found to have an effect on telomerase that is not something a placebo would do. The fact that it did
not work as fast as the higher dose is the reason they chose to go with the higher 9.4 dose in MF. The funny thing
that you leave out is the fact that the 7.4 dose has proven to be effective in MDS and is likely to be used frontline
in that indication.

They definitely did say 8 today. Note that there are only 8 drugs listed under the NME PLANNED FILINGS
columns in the recently updated J&J April 17th pipeline slide. Imetelstat is 1 of the 8.


On another note, the drug under imetelstat in the April 17th slide, erdafitinib, did make it to the J&J Annual
Meeting Pharmaceuticals slide in a section titled "Key Catalysts for Growth" under the bullet point
"Submitting Regulatory applications for new molecular entities (NMEs) which include esketamine,
erdafitinib... Since it was listed under imetelstat in the April 17th slide, it doesn't look like the listing order is
very significant (although its nice being on the top vs. being at the bottom).

OK, I had a long comment written up, but I lost it when I clicked on a link to see why my comments are currently
being moderated by SA...still not sure what exactly I did, but whatever.


Has JS ever walked back his 2016 comments on the effectiveness of the 4.7 mg/kg dose? It doesn't make sense
to me that patients would still be receiving that dose if there was no clinical benefit being shown. But, it is a little
odd not to say something to clarify earlier statements or bring them up to date on new data or his new views on the
dose. Maybe JNJ wouldn't let him?


Moreover, is it normal for the FDA to continue allowing patients to take a drug for one year after a drug trial closes?
Surly the FDA would not say, "OK, we know you are still alive, but your spleen hasn't shrunk enough for us, so
you've got 1 year before we take you off IMET and you die." And if IMET was showing nothing more than a
placebo effect, would it really take 3 years to establish this?


I guess there are two inferences that can be drawn: first, the FDA expects IMET to get accelerated approval in the
next 12 months. Or, the FDA expects all trial patients currently taking IMET to pass away within the next 12
months.


Am I thinking about this correctly?

Your first post made it to the thread. 
As far as the 4.7 arm, it seemed that jnj and gern knew that it would not meet endpoints but was needed
for the trial. I believe some on here called that the 4.7 arm would be closed before it happened. But it is
obviously is working better than anyone thought. I believe he hasn’t gone back on his words because of
the JnJ info hold. Big positive in my mind.
As far as spleen response, looking back through my notes this has been talked about for sometime.
Spleen response with Imet takes longer because how the drug works. But when it does start to have a
spleen response its because the drug is working at the root of the cause. Endpoints are moving because
more and more is understood regarding Imet. The more known the better Imet is looking, which I believe

JS answered this question in details during the last (JPM?) presentation, but you can also go back and
read why JNJ discontinued the 4.7 arm. Basically they found that 9.4mg dose was clearly more effective,
especially at reducing spleen volume, so there was no reason to keep the 4.7 arm going in parallel.
However, some patients responded to the 4.7mg dose and wished to be continued on the 4.7 dose (lower
toxicity) instead of migrating to 9.4, so JNJ allowed that.


It was very sloppy on JS 's part not to clearly explain during the initial announcement the reasons why the
4.7 arm was discontinued but at the same time allowed to go on. He gave the impression that there was
no efficacy in the 4.7 arm, but the actual situation was that a significant number of patients responded to
the 4.7 arm at a slower rate, but the spleen volume response was insignificant compared to the 9.4 arm.
He later explained all this in more details.

Curiosity Killed The Cat, Contributor
@3shot


“Has JS ever walked back his 2016 comments on the effectiveness of the 4.7 mg/kg dose?”


Every comment JS ever uttered about the 4.7 mg/kg dose not being effective was made in reference to its
potential effect on the primary endpoint of spleen reduction. Nobody, including Scarlett, me, anyone
posting on this board, and probably Janssen, expected the 4.7 mg/kg dose to have a statistically
significant effect on spleen reduction. This topic was discussed ad nauseam back then and none of us
could figure out why the 4.7 mg/kg Arm was part of the trial in the first place. The only information Geron
was willing to provide on this topic was Janssen’s researchers believed the 4.7 mg/kg was “theoretically”
the smallest dose of imetelstat capable providing a clinically meaningful effect on spleen reduction in this
patient population. When that turned out not to be the case, patients in that Arm were immediately given
the option of moving into the 9.4 mg/kg Arm.

2016 comments regarding the 4.7 mg/kg dose. Has he ever walked back these statements, which certainly seem
to imply that he didn't think it was working?


And what should we infer from the fact that the FDA has approved the use of both the 4.7 mg/kg and 9.4 mg/kg
doses for existing trial patients for a full year after the trial is completed? Is this normal, especially if the FDA is
seeing basically a placebo effect, which is what I think the author is implying?


To me, it would seem that the FDA would not allow patients to continue taking a drug for 4 years if there was no
evidence it was working, regardless of the dose. But it seems even less likely that the FDA would force patients off
of a drug that was working for them, thus saying, we know you may die soon, but we aren't seeing enough spleen
reduction to continue allowing you to take this drug. My inference is that the drug is likely to get accelerated
approval at some point prior to patients being forced off. But I guess the counterargument is that the FDA is pretty
sure the existing patients will have passed away by then?


I would appreciate some help understanding this point better.


By the way, are anyone else's comments being moderated by SA? Weird.

You should use currently available JAK therapy as a comparison. Comparing drugs and outcomes is not allowed
by the FDA since patient populations are different enough to make comparisons impossible. It is easy to see if
other drugs did an intent to treat trial or a completer only trial. Completer only trials means you one see data
outcomes for those who completed the trial. These numbers are highly skewed since they do not represent those
who failed, dropped out, etc. A high quality trial would always use intent to treat to ensure that all data and all
patients are accounted for within the data. Ruxolitinib is the only therapy with an approved indication for
myelofibrosis. The pivotal phase 3 COMFORT studies included only patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF
(there were more high risk patients in the placebo arm 45 vs 54). Only the US trial included patients with high risk.
In the spleen reduction data the trial had 155 patients on active drug but data is only listed for 149 and 145
patients. Where is the data for these patients. In an intent to treat trial all of the patients would be accounted for
and their impact on the data shown. The 139 patients receiving ruxolitinib had a mean reduction in spleen volume
of 31.6%. Once again we see a reduction from the 155 patients enrolled in the active drug arm of the study. This
means that roughly 10% of the patients enrolled in the active drug arm have data that is not included in the clinical
trail outcomes data. Seventeen patients who received ruxolitinib (11.0%) and 16 patients who received placebo
(10.6%) discontinued the study treatment because of adverse events (of any grade). Twenty deaths occurred
during the study or within 28 days after the last dose was administered (9 deaths in the ruxolitinib group and 11
deaths in the placebo group, including 1 death after crossover). Principal causes of death in the ruxolitinib group

were muscle weakness and general deterioration, subdural hematoma, renal failure, non–small-cell lung cancer,
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pneumonia (in 2 patients), and sepsis (in 2 patients). Principal causes of death in
the placebo group were staphylococcal infection, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, multiorgan
failure, pneumonia, sepsis (in 2 patients), and disease progression (in 4 patients). So how does this data compare
with what is known about Imetelstat. In the arena of cancer treatments if a therapy can help even a small number
of patients it will be approved. When it comes to fatal diseases the ability to treat and save or sustain the life of
even a small number of patients is critical. If the drug were to get orphan drug status it allows for the company to
make some revenue of the drug while investigating other diseases the drug might be well suited to treat.

The longs remain convinced of Imet's success, perhaps even irrationally so. As a long of nearly 20 years, I
eventually lost all hope and am highly skeptical of GERN now. I did waver recently, mostly due to all the positive
posts and comments here, and I even came close buying shares again yesterday. But after reading this article, I'm
glad I didn't.


It's been my experience that shorts do more intensive research than longs, so I do not discount them as idiots. To
the contrary, I feel their point about Imet missing from the presentations is troubling. The appearance on one slide
could easily have been an oversight - a failure to delete it from the previous version, as it is very likely the old
slides were edited to prepare new slides, and it took intentional action to remove Imet from those slides.


Companies want to talk about every new drug they have in their pipeline, so removing one is significant and
something they would not have done without good reason, imo.


We are looking at circumstantial evidence here, but it is worrisome enough to make me wait for hard facts. If I miss
a big part of a price surge, so be it. In this case I'd rather be safe and certain, rather than take another risk on a
company/drug that has disappointed me for so many years.


26 Apr 2018, 09:55 AM

So you are saying that nobody in J+J proof read that extremely significant pipeline presentation of a few
day ago ?? That really stretches credulity, and if they had indeed made a such a mistake, don`t you think
someone would have already pointed it to them, and an immediate correction and clarification would have
been made ???

It’s not a mistake and not an omission. Starting mid last year the earning slides separate the RELEASED
drugs via collaboration from the PIPELINE (or in clinical stage) collaborations. 
Imetelstat is and has always been listed in the top pipeline list.


Ignore self categorized ‘longs’ and ‘shorts’ and learn how to find this information yourself.

Can't disagree with irrational confirmation bias being a problem.


That said, we aren't talking about GERN's absentee staff here. Are you SERIOUSLY saying that you think
JNJ doesn't check their Powerpoint slides when they're presenting their "five most important oncology
drugs"?


I don't like big pharma's priorities, but claiming that they're so addled that they don't know which drugs
they're pushing isn't "rational"... you lost too many SAN points holding GERN for two decades ;)

No, I'm saying I don't know for sure what happened, just speculating on one plausible reason, but when in
doubt, I'm out.


The same Q could be asked about the slides where Imet was omitted. Did no one proofread them and
discover its absence?

OK so maybe they didn't overlook it, but why was it removed from the other slides? Does that not raise just
a tiny red flag in your mind?


Perhaps they aren't "pushing" it now, but they just aren't ready to remove it form that slide because it has
not been formally announced yet.


I don't know what SAN points are, but sounds like you are saying I was wrong to hold GERN then, but also
wrong to not hold it now? A guy can't win...

If you look at the earnings slides mentioned above, there is a distinct difference between the Q2 2017 slides and
the ones presented for Q1 2018. The slide 5 that shows the partnerships did show Imetelstat, but at the top is
states that these partnerships will be discussed further in the presentation. From J&J's EARNINGS CALL deck:
"During the course of this morning’s presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed
in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. Following is an acknowledgement of
those relationships:" The other drugs listed were mentioned subsequently, because they are driving revenue.
Imetelstat isn't yet approved, therefore it cannot drive revenue, and it was NOT discussed further in the
presentation. I believe that the 2017 slides showing Imetelstat were a copy/paste from another slide, and it was
just cleanup subsequent. IMO, the most recent slides are much tighter and cleaner. Also as mentioned previously,
the pipeline slide UPDATED as of April 17 2018 shows Geron at the top of the oncology pipeline. There is no
divorce forthcoming....

AE, thanks for trying to read the GERN tea leaves. While you're at it, how do you interpret CEO Scarlett's
statement that "there is no plan for Phase 3 in MF"?


But how do you explain away the fact that Imetelstat is listed in the top position of the oncology pipeline in a JNJ
slide that was published a week ago? Isn't this inconsistent with your thesis? Or are you hoping that most
"investors" only read headlines... well of course you are, because they do.

This is the most persuasive short article yet. I am sure the price will drop hugely. Like it or not articles from AE
have a much larger impact on pps than ones by MTB. I think these pts were much sicker than he alleges or implies
and that OS is more desirable than the spleen primary endpoint but spleen size is the primary endpoint. The
patients were so sick jnj and gern probably did not want to risk using OS as a primary endpoint. I remember
discussions on this board about the fear they may have been too sick for a successful ct.

That's because shorts sell at the same as these articles in a concerted action and not because the articles
are persuasive. There is plenty of data in these posts to contradict all the points made above. Longs don't
buy on MTB news because the stock is going up. Longs buy now, like I did. I thought the same as you till I
realized an opinion thoroughly contradicted over and over again can't be having such an influence. There
has to be something behind it. A large short sale, but we won't find till we get the short publications later
on.

A better constructed article than the last time around. Many of the points in the article at least wrt the clinical

Looking like his AKAO short thesis is going out the window.


The ADCOM for cUTI will go through, still a lot of debate about BSI but with the LPAD and speakers they
have it might end up being approved.


Since the small population for BSI they used cUTI study for safety data and while they cant 100% prove
the reduction in mortality in BSI the drug demonstrated non-inferiority to current standard of care.


We'll see in two hours but its looking like AKAO has a bright future.

My favorite point #6: Survival data is not the most important one. 
Wow, National Institute of Cancer show give you an award.
You should be writing article together with David Avocado Wolfe about how gravity is toxic.
All these super rich old man from all over the world who pay cash for their treatment in best clinics around US, do
not care about survival.
According to your brilliant writing logic they should care about Something else.

This might be a stupid question, but...
How can they (FDA) ethically allow a test for an experimental and (at least theoretically) life-saving drug
with a placebo? I'd be awful angry/dead if the drug worked and I was the placebo victim.


03 May 2018, 01:12 PM


telomerase
Far from a stupid question. In an "ethical" world, patients and doctors could make their own decisions
(especially in the case of terminal diseases with no cure). If someone wants placebo suicide volunteers,
they should have to pay them (which would be easy, there are plenty of starving people around the world
living in US-funded dictatorships who would love to be in a clinical trial).


But if we lived in that ethical world, most cancers would be cured and aging would already be treated,
rather than its symptoms...

@ GarthHarbel:


It's a thoughtful question that goes to the very nature of the drug discovery process in much of the world.
My two cents:


I believe that the short, and unsatisfying, answer is that both the legal boilerplate as well as any study-
specific clauses should disclose all of this upfront to the potential double-blind ct participant in the
participation agreement.

Comments (302)


A slightly longer answer: On an ethical basis, I think that it's useful to think of the contrapositive. What if
double-blinds and control/placebo arms did not exist? How would the safety and efficacy of the drug be
clinically tested as against the best available current therapy or doing nothing? I realize that this is a
"greater good" argument that does nothing for the individual not given the experimental drug. But even as
regards the individual --


What if the drug candidate is not safe and/or effective? Then BAT or placebo turns out to have been the
"better" alternative. Of course there is the opportunity cost of the patient's not having taken another course
of therapy in order to participate in the ct.


Perhaps in the final analysis, double-blinds make the best of a less than ideal situation. A participant signs
on to take a chance at being given the experimental drug candidate, for better or for worse. And,
ultimately, the larger patient base benefits as well...

The whole Janssen setup in IMBARK is obviously positioned by design for an AA method. That's why
there was never a phase 3 design for IMBARK. Why else conduct just a phase 2 with no plans or design

Most of our MF case is based on MTB's report of the shadow of Chipthulhu's "smile" when he rose from

<<Most of our MF case is based on MTB's report of the shadow of Chipthulhu's "smile" when he rose from

telo, please, not one of your meltdown melodramas again.


The case for MF is based on survival advantage, noted "range of spleen responses", symptom reduction
and known activity of the drug in producing CRs/PRs in the frontline pilot. Do you really think Janssen is
toying about by extending the trial to assess survival benefit ? They noted survival benefit as early as April
2017.


The main weakness in Imbark is that it is not an RCT. So, the FDA could be adamant about OS advantage
having to be proven in RCTs (despite rare exceptions where historical control was permitted). However,

https://seekingalpha.com/user/14321652

https://seekingalpha.com/user/8127331
the dose-response design of Imbark is a savior here. If the survival curve and/or other responses of the
9.4 dose turns out to be superior to the 4.7 dose, it can support approval on its own.


Given that median hasn't been reached in either dose, I believe the extension was required to let the
survival curves diverge further. In this regard, the pre-specified number of deaths being reached 2 months
earlier could be a very good sign if the deaths happened in the 4.7 dose.

Thank goodness for the new article.
This is the reply from Disputes at Alpha. I don't consider this interpretation. The article's title smacks of yellow
journalism. Such stupidity. 
Thank you for providing links.


The facts the author cites in this article are that imetelstat is missing from the "key strategic partnerships" slide of
the most recent earnings presentation (where it was included in prior quarters) and the "key events for 2018" slide
(it was previously included in "key events for 2017" in prior earnings presentations). The author points out
imetelstat has not been included in J&J's earnings presentations for Q4 2017 or Q1 2018. As far as I can tell, this
is true.


Imetelstat does appear on the IR website on a document called "Late Stage Pipeline." That is a separate
document, not an earnings presentation, and does not invalidate the author's statements of fact.

The dispute here boils down to a difference of interpretation. The author interprets the omission of imetelstat from
the two latest earnings presentations as a sign the partnership has ceased or will cease, despite its inclusion in the
pipeline document. You interpret its inclusion in the pipeline document as a sign that the partnership is intact,
despite imetelstat's removal from earnings presentations. And differences of interpretation are not covered under
our disputes process.

In early April I wrote an email letter to Geron development management after bears Alpha Exposure and Adam F.

great research results in MDS and AML plus huge potential in the combo program for IMET, I also mentioned
these two bear attacks regarding MF and asked Geron to respond. So far, Geron has not respond. This may be
understandable since JNJ is doing the research on MF for Geron and I am only one share holder. Now, Alpha
Exposure is spreading false rumors that Geron is separated from JNJ. Since those bear attacks, Geron stock has
fall from 6.68 to 3.31. I strongly urge all long Geron share holders, especially all of us who make supporting
comments regarding Geron to email or write letters to Geron management and share holder relations to complain
about false rumors about separation. I believe when a large number of Geron share holders complain about this
separation rumor, Geron may respond publicly! After all, the separation rumor is not true, it hurts all Geron long
holders as well as Geron management. I urge all Geron holders to unite and become a force. I want to thank all

This post reeks of words and phrase structure indicative of deception. I liken it to the traveling situation for well off
American citizens in 3rd world countries:


You have 3 full time body guards means that you are safe; when the body guards are absent you are at risk.


And now - for the identical situation:


You need no body guards. If you had body guards it would mean you are in danger.


Hint: Is it human nature to share or protect information beneficial to self?

Absolutely disgusting to see how low people will stoop to make a dollar. The statement that, "We believe
imetelstat’s elimination and omission from Janssen’s presentation materials is an indication that the company is
likely to terminate its collaboration agreement in 3Q 2018", is an outright lie. The page shown to present the fake
"proof" is the first page of 2 and does not include Imetelstat but the second page titled "Janssen Pharmaceutical
Companies of Johnson & Johnson Selected NME (New Molecular Entity) Pharmaceutical Pipeline-Recent
Approvals/Potential Filings", has Imetelstat at the top of the page. No need to consider the remainder of the
analysis in light of such a falsehood. Let's hope that the author's, financial lifetime success is limited to the
payment received from SA for this trash analysis.

Thanks for writing this article...


After checking the J&J Pipeline and Q1 earnings documentation (the later of which it appears they have been
removed from) for signs of Geron's drug candidate Imetelstat and finding absolutely nothing regarding the drug or
the partnership, I've since changed my stance on this stock in light of the new information.


I checked J&J's info before and Imetelstat was included, but now it's not...


Isn't that illegal or something? I swear they listed Imetelstat previously and removed it after earnings were over for
a week.

But page 2 says "Imetelstat myelofibrosis", not Imetelstat MDS syndrome". We already know Imetelstat is
not competitive with existing drugs for MF except perhaps for a small subset of MF patients.

Paul, drugs don't have to be "competitive" as monotherapies, as long as they work by different
mechanisms for use in combinations.


Many drugs in HIV are "less powerful" than others, but they're still in the pills both for synergy and to
prevent the disease from mutating around one drug.

The leading and ONLY approved drug for MF is jakafi.jakavi which has a very short life span and is not
curative. Even as a single agent, IMET has demonstrated curative properties which is the most
competitive attribute you could hope for. JNJ is not sitting on their hands for going frontline therapy in MF
as they better understand the MOA and combos. If they capture backlne R/R MF, then frontline will happen
but could also involve a combo therapy.

I really think that most of the patients in trials are in Europe. opened first there. janssens HQ is in Germany. The
brokerage firms and Incy shills have infiltrated every patient advocacy group on the web. check out the FB
Imetelstat webpage. There are like 5-6 people who work for brokerage groups, about 4 that run patient advocacy
groups for Incy and Novartis, two people who are or were in one of the trials in MF, and probably a few private
investors. Whether the news was good or bad or even average in MF, it would be known and repeated endlessly
by those wanting Geron to fail. We would have had people like the guy from MPN forum repeatimg failures on this

"we believe imetelstat would be prominently highlighted in Janssen’s earnings presentations" Really???? If you
were interested in buying something very expensive, would you advertise how badly you want it before you
negotiate a price/deal? I certainly would not. This is either a good short attack piece or a calculated move by J&J
to keep their share price down so they can negotiate a better deal... or both.

Excellent, accurate article. I agree Imetelstat has no substantial future for the treatment of myelofibrosis due to its
ho hum efficacy and excessive toxicity. This is not my opinion - it is the opinion of the top myelofibrosis specialists
in the USA (Dr. Raza is not a myelofibrosis specialist). The Geron bulls cannot name multiple myelofibrosis
specialists that have made public statements during the past 2 years expressing enthusiasm about the potential of
imetelstat to replace Jakafi as a first line treatment for myelofibrosis.


P.S. I am not an Incyte investor or troll - I'm an opportunistic investor just like most everyone else. I think Imetelstat
has some limited potential for a small subset of MF patients with certain uncommon mutations and maybe for a
larger subset IF used in combination with other existing drugs - but such combos may be so wildly expensive they
won't be widely prescribed.

The only one I know is the world renowned Dr Ayelew Tefferi MD. A specialist in hematology who has
been practicing for 38 years.


He is Professor of Hematology and Internal Medicine and Section Head for Leukemia and Proliferative
Disorders of Hematic Cells, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine


Prof Tefferi has 800 publications including books, book chapters, original articles, reviews, editorials,
letters, and abstracts. Tefferi serves as an associate or section editor for the Mayo Clinic Proceedings,
Leukemia, American Journal of Hematology, and European Journal of Hematology. His research involves
clinical and laboratory research in myeloid disorders including acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid
disorders.


And his view of imetelstat is as follows;


"We observed that imetelstat was active and induced morphologic and molecular remissions in some
patients with myelofibrosis,"
"We also observed that imetelstat demonstrated selective anticlonal activity, inhibiting the growth of cancer
cells, which we had not previously documented with other drugs."


In fact the results were so impressive, he called it ‘tantamount to a cure’.


So, which other specialists support your claims? I look forward to reading about them.


https://mayocl.in/1jfR5So


He also called the non-hematological toxicity ‘trivial’


http://bit.ly/2vQLTXb


He also mentions that used as the current dosing regimen (ie not weekly) toxicity is not an issue or
problem.


Your claims are not the same as this top myleofibrosis specialist, certainly not on the ‘ho-hum efficacy’ and
‘excessive toxicity’. 
Do you have any facts to back up these claims or is it just speculation?


27 Apr 2018, 05:33 AM

PaulC-if you are not an Incyte investor or a troll then are you a GERN short? I ask because you post on

Tefferi's last public comment about MF was "I don't like any drug in trials for MF".


Scarlett's comment was "there is no plan for Phase 3 in MF".


You can see how non- Cult Of Chipthulhu people would see these things as negative for imet. But the True
Believers, the Old Ones, know that imetelstat will rise from sunken R'lyeh after the lost decades to once
again fail against solid tumors!

I believe all of them are experts in hematology and work with Dr Tefferi.

PaulC,


Do you know what evidence is? Are you familiar with the concept? You've perhaps heard the term? Here’s
a short definition:


Evidence:


“Something that furnishes proof.”


Your posts might be a bit more credible if you provided some evidence in support of your claims. Just a
thought. Then again malicious short sellers do not rely on evidence so why should you, right?

Here are 59 MPN specialists in the USA http://bit.ly/2qucCml and except for Tefferi, I havn't heard of any of
them publicly (e.g. in interviews or on youtube) expressing enthusiasm about the potential of imetelstat to
replace Jakafi as a first line treatment for myelofibrosis. There are also at least 5 other drugs for MF in trial
who's backers would like to think they have potential to replace or partially replace Jakafi as a first line
therapy for MF, but none to date look too promising with the exception of Ropeginterferon (trade name
BESREMi).

There are also lots of MPN groups on facebook where, for example, many dozens of myelofibrosis
patients discuss their current and future drug treatment options. Imetelstat is rarely mentioned as being
one of them, except for a small subset of patients that have been identified has having certain uncommon
DNA mutations.


The future of MPN & MDS treatments appears to lie in drug combination therapy. Since low dose
imetelstat is well tolerated it is certainly possible that it may have a future in low dose combinations with
other MPN and MDS drugs. Just not a future as a first line mono therapy for any MPN chronic blood
cancers (e.g. ET, PV & MF).

Going all the way back 2015 the worlds top MPN disease specialists such as the Danish ones below have
recognized imetelstat was not competitive with existing drugs for the treatment of MPN blood cancers
including essential thrombocythemia - the most inherently benign one. Example: http://bit.ly/1Uohkxh

at the expense of hemoglobin and neutrophil levels. However, the other main treatment goals in essential
thrombocythemia2 — controlling symptoms and preventing both disease progression and thromboembolic
complications — were definitely not achieved. Fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea were all reported by more
than 70% of the patients. A total of 3 patients had progression to myelofibrosis, and 2 patients had a
thromboembolic event. Thus, treatment with imetelstat does not seem to be promising in this relatively
benign disease.’


Daniel El Fassi, M.D., Ph.D.

To the Editor:


“Given the toxic side effects and modest treatment response associated with imetelstat, we do not think
this drug can be considered as an alternative to interferon alfa-2, which in addition to its immune-
modulating effects is a telomerase inhibitor as well.”

Proof-of-Concept in Essential Thrombocythemia


A Phase 2 multi-center, single agent and open label trial was conducted in 18 patients with ET to provide
proof-of-concept for the potential use of imetelstat as a treatment for hematologic myeloid malignancies,
such as MF, MDS or AML. Published results (Baerlocher GM, et al. Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in
Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. N Engl J Med. 2015 Sep 3; 373(10):920-8) are summarized as
follows:
•18 of 18 patients (100%) achieved a hematologic response with a reduction in platelets, including 16 of
18 patients (89%) achieving a complete response with a normalization of platelet counts.
•The median time on therapy was 17.1 months (range: 6.9 months to 2.7 years).
•Seven out of the eight (88%) patients with a JAK2 V617F gene mutation achieved 72% to 96% reductions
in allele burden and qualified as partial molecular responses.
•MPL and CALR mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15% to 66%.
•The nature of adverse events reported were similar to those reported in other imetelstat clinical trials, with
fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic biochemistry abnormalities and cytopenias being the most
frequently observed.

Thanks for that, it is an interesting paper.
You didnt include Dr Tefferi’s response to the study which is as follows;


Dr. Tefferi replies: It is true that imetelstat may not have the side-effect profile that justifies its further
consideration for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, as reported by Baerlocher et al. However,
drug benefit–risk assessment is best accomplished in the context of randomized studies and should not be
surmised from the results of a small proof-of-concept study. The same holds true for other drugs for the
treatment of essential thrombocythemia, including interferon alfa. Treatment-induced reduction in the JAK2
or CALR mutant allele burden in patients with essential thrombocythemia has been observed with
imetelstat, interferon alfa,1 and busulfan.2 Such observations do not necessarily imply that each of these
drugs has the same effect on coexistent disease clones with different mutations3 or an advantage in terms
of meaningful health outcome; the latter requires evidence from controlled studies and not conjecture
based on local treatment practices. The observations from our pilot study of imetelstat support a unique
mechanism of action that deserves further laboratory-based investigation.
Ayalew Tefferi, M.D.


It is this unique mechanism of action that drove the further clinical studies, and led to the spectacular
results we are seeing in both Myelofibrosis and MDS.


In MDS the FDA awarded it Fast Track designation, and your concerns over efficacy and toxicity appear to
be unfounded. 
Had they been as severe as you claim it wouldn’t have gained such a status. QED.


Since this article was published Janssen has learned substantially more about imetelstat and is applying
for patents in AML (combination studies) and will soon test (if they havent already) for other indications.


There have been successful studies (warranting further investigation) in pancreatic cancer and this will
likely be further studied by Jansen.
http://bit.ly/2wjzMOg


Given the spectacular results so far in both MDS, MF, preclinical AML as well as in other cancers, the
evidence points overwhelmingly to it being efficacious and without major safety concerns.


There have been years now of studies in imetelstat and had it had ‘ho-hum toxicity’ and ‘excessive toxicity’
it would have been dropped years ago.


There is still no evidence that ‘the top myelofibrosis specialists in the USA’ have the opinion you claim.

with the mini ET because I hear the spouting off less significant INFN percentages and focused on easier
ET/PV INDs. The history Of Imetelstat has been consistent across ET/PV/MF/MDS/AML so far and the
quoting of old data in 2015 comparison is simply laughable.

So PaulC, if you hit the unlucky lottery and develop MF, I take it you will go seek treatment in Denmark
rather than US?


28 Apr 2018, 11:44 AM


PaulC.
In 2014 the Danish actually pioneered the most effective and best tolerated treatment for MF known to
date: low dose pegylated interferon + low dose Jakafi combination therapy. The interferon improves the
bone marrow, helping to stabilize and sometimes reverse dropping red blood cell and hemoglobin counts
and the Jakafi helps shrink the spleen. Not a popularly prescribed treatment yet due to high cost and
because it's an off label treatment.


While Imetelstat monotherapy is not competitive with interferon monotherapy or Jakafi monotherapy for
treating MF, there is a chance it could have breakthrough benefits when combined (at low doses that don't
hurt the liver) with other existing or future drugs including interferon and Jakafi.

I'm afraid biotech is moving much faster and increasingly so since 2014. Just pay attention. INFN has had
decades upon decades to prove itself and just combining it with jakafi tells us alot. As if jakafi isn't severely
toxic ! It's discontinued very quickly because the benefits do not exceed the toxicity. Do you really think the
world of advancing diagnostics and pre-clinical combo testing is going to screw around with jakafi (other
than INCY ) for the most competitive combo ingredients ? That's a laugh. Just look how INCY is failing one
pipeline effort after another doing shot gunning rather than taking rifle shots. Better tell your Danish 2014
OG's to get with the modern times of science platforms. Also, shrinking the spleen is not advancing
medical science like shrinking of tumors.

You obviously did not read all the ASH abstracts on Interferon and Imetelstat. 1. Imetelstat achieved
results for CALR patients in a matter of months while it took Interferon 3 years to achieve those kind of
results and in smaller numbers(for Interferon). No one would ever go for approval of a drug by targeting ET
as Dr. Tefferi pointed out the trial would take 24 years to run and no one would start with PV either
because it would take about 16 years.

Taz - there's a facebook group with some highly knowledgable patients with ET and the CALR mutation.
They've carefully reviewed the Imeltestat data to date and concluded it is not competitive with pegylated
Interferon as a disease progression inhibiting drug (except for about 20% of patients that have the SF3B1
or U2AF1 mutations) which is their current drug of choice and soon to be replaced by a purer an even
more effective interferon with the generic name Ropeginterferon (trade name BESREMi).

Again PaulC. you are pushing an old drug related to a an easier ET IND and a sub-type mutation all going
back to 2014. Somehow you pretend to compare this to IMET that is not chasing the easier ET IND due to
the long lifetime of disease progression involved. As I already demonstrated to you, IMET grew its wings
off a mini trial with quick 100% type responses and not just based on some sub-type mutation for

molecular responses. That early ET test flight for Geron got it to the Mayo Pilot trial for more difficult and
urgent need critical patients in MF and MDS. Just because IMET is not specifically testing and chasing ET
with the sub-type CALR mutation does not in any way make old interferon or any reformulation even close
to being competitive to Imetelstat in MF.


01 May 2018, 04:07 AM


ligas3
JNJ used the preliminary data from Immerge in OCT 2017 to successfully get IMET fast tracked for MDS. That
preliminary data is known today. However, they deliberately delayed the move to P3 even though this data justified
fast tracking to further study Imetelstat in the sub group. I originally had a short thought that they were delaying the
continuation decision perhaps because they thought the MDS overall data was so so and the MF date might not
be so good. However, if they thought the preliminary Immerge data was good enough to get fast track for and fully
enrolled the P3 ahead of time, and trotted out Dr Raza to say that Imet will be used by the majority of MDS
patients, that gives me confidence that they are delaying the continuation until the MDS data on this subset is
available to see if they can get an accelerated approval or perhaps go after a Frontline treatment in MDS. Razas
comment about Imet being used up front by the majority of MDS patients is huge and leads me to believe that they
have big plans in MDS.


26 Apr 2018, 11:54 PM

ligas3 the confirmation and delay of starting the phase 3 is because they will be going for frontline in MDS.
JNJ wants to make sure they get the trial design right. When people understand that they will be frontline

There is no separation or divorce papers filed by JNJ or Geron. The shorts are desperately trying to compose a
false divorce paper for JNJ and Geron. Very soon expensive separation and divorce papers will be served on all
shorts involuntarily (margin calls) because they ignore the great research results as well as great observations by
expert Dr. Raza regarding the MDS program, the potential of AML and combo programs regarding IMET. Even if a
divorce paper is filed by JNJ on Geron assumed by the shorts due to their false interpretations of MF research
results, Geron stock should rise up faster due to the independence if JNJ chooses to drop out. After all the MDS is
three times larger than the MF program, plus the AML and the combo programs are much much bigger than tde
MDS program!

Getting back to the real world.........The odds of some kind of formal partnership between JNJ and Abbvie has
increased. Probably the most powerful argument for Geron right now is likely in the works, a start to an AML trial
linking two of the most powerful drugs in cancer, Venetoclax and Imetelstat.


This link is what may separate the men-from-the-boys. If this combination works in AML, I wouldn't doubt whatever
success we see in MF and MDS may also be improved upon. Are solid tumors next?


This is simply one of the most important times for Geron and all stockholders.

Calling the lowest Effective dose a placebo is ridiculous. A placebo would have no effect but the 4.7 dose was the
lowest dose found to have an effect on telomerase that is not something a placebo would do. The fact that it did
not work as fast as the higher dose is the reason they chose to go with the higher 9.4 dose in MF. The funny thing

Could be meaningful, but maybe not. Because a decision on Imet has not been announced previously, I
doubt they would want to raise the issue of the loss of a pipeline asset at the ASM. Late on a Friday in
August seems more likely.


But I'm just guessing, I have no clue what/who to believe at this point.


26 Apr 2018, 12:12 PM


GernOneShotLeftonGoal
They definitely did say 8 today. Note that there are only 8 drugs listed under the NME PLANNED FILINGS
columns in the recently updated J&J April 17th pipeline slide. Imetelstat is 1 of the 8.


On another note, the drug under imetelstat in the April 17th slide, erdafitinib, did make it to the J&J Annual
Meeting Pharmaceuticals slide in a section titled "Key Catalysts for Growth" under the bullet point
"Submitting Regulatory applications for new molecular entities (NMEs) which include esketamine,
erdafitinib... Since it was listed under imetelstat in the April 17th slide, it doesn't look like the listing order is
very significant (although its nice being on the top vs. being at the bottom).


26 Apr 2018, 12:40 PM

The two NME’s they listed are J&J developed. For this type meeting, would be unwise of J&J to call out

OK, I had a long comment written up, but I lost it when I clicked on a link to see why my comments are currently
being moderated by SA...still not sure what exactly I did, but whatever.


Has JS ever walked back his 2016 comments on the effectiveness of the 4.7 mg/kg dose? It doesn't make sense
to me that patients would still be receiving that dose if there was no clinical benefit being shown. But, it is a little
odd not to say something to clarify earlier statements or bring them up to date on new data or his new views on the
dose. Maybe JNJ wouldn't let him?


Moreover, is it normal for the FDA to continue allowing patients to take a drug for one year after a drug trial closes?
Surly the FDA would not say, "OK, we know you are still alive, but your spleen hasn't shrunk enough for us, so
you've got 1 year before we take you off IMET and you die." And if IMET was showing nothing more than a
placebo effect, would it really take 3 years to establish this?


I guess there are two inferences that can be drawn: first, the FDA expects IMET to get accelerated approval in the
next 12 months. Or, the FDA expects all trial patients currently taking IMET to pass away within the next 12
months.


Am I thinking about this correctly?

Your first post made it to the thread. 
As far as the 4.7 arm, it seemed that jnj and gern knew that it would not meet endpoints but was needed
for the trial. I believe some on here called that the 4.7 arm would be closed before it happened. But it is
obviously is working better than anyone thought. I believe he hasn’t gone back on his words because of
the JnJ info hold. Big positive in my mind.
As far as spleen response, looking back through my notes this has been talked about for sometime.
Spleen response with Imet takes longer because how the drug works. But when it does start to have a
spleen response its because the drug is working at the root of the cause. Endpoints are moving because
more and more is understood regarding Imet. The more known the better Imet is looking, which I believe
will continue with evolving research.

https://seekingalpha.com/user/48113744
JS answered this question in details during the last (JPM?) presentation, but you can also go back and
read why JNJ discontinued the 4.7 arm. Basically they found that 9.4mg dose was clearly more effective,
especially at reducing spleen volume, so there was no reason to keep the 4.7 arm going in parallel.
However, some patients responded to the 4.7mg dose and wished to be continued on the 4.7 dose (lower
toxicity) instead of migrating to 9.4, so JNJ allowed that.


It was very sloppy on JS 's part not to clearly explain during the initial announcement the reasons why the
4.7 arm was discontinued but at the same time allowed to go on. He gave the impression that there was
no efficacy in the 4.7 arm, but the actual situation was that a significant number of patients responded to
the 4.7 arm at a slower rate, but the spleen volume response was insignificant compared to the 9.4 arm.
He later explained all this in more details.

@3shot


“Has JS ever walked back his 2016 comments on the effectiveness of the 4.7 mg/kg dose?”


Every comment JS ever uttered about the 4.7 mg/kg dose not being effective was made in reference to its
potential effect on the primary endpoint of spleen reduction. Nobody, including Scarlett, me, anyone
posting on this board, and probably Janssen, expected the 4.7 mg/kg dose to have a statistically
significant effect on spleen reduction. This topic was discussed ad nauseam back then and none of us
could figure out why the 4.7 mg/kg Arm was part of the trial in the first place. The only information Geron
was willing to provide on this topic was Janssen’s researchers believed the 4.7 mg/kg was “theoretically”
the smallest dose of imetelstat capable providing a clinically meaningful effect on spleen reduction in this
patient population. When that turned out not to be the case, patients in that Arm were immediately given
the option of moving into the 9.4 mg/kg Arm.

So ignoring the slide stuff, which I think has been adequately addressed by many others, I am curious about JS's
2016 comments regarding the 4.7 mg/kg dose. Has he ever walked back these statements, which certainly seem
to imply that he didn't think it was working?


And what should we infer from the fact that the FDA has approved the use of both the 4.7 mg/kg and 9.4 mg/kg
doses for existing trial patients for a full year after the trial is completed? Is this normal, especially if the FDA is
seeing basically a placebo effect, which is what I think the author is implying?


To me, it would seem that the FDA would not allow patients to continue taking a drug for 4 years if there was no
evidence it was working, regardless of the dose. But it seems even less likely that the FDA would force patients off
of a drug that was working for them, thus saying, we know you may die soon, but we aren't seeing enough spleen
reduction to continue allowing you to take this drug. My inference is that the drug is likely to get accelerated
approval at some point prior to patients being forced off. But I guess the counterargument is that the FDA is pretty
sure the existing patients will have passed away by then?


I would appreciate some help understanding this point better.


By the way, are anyone else's comments being moderated by SA? Weird.

You should use currently available JAK therapy as a comparison. Comparing drugs and outcomes is not allowed
by the FDA since patient populations are different enough to make comparisons impossible. It is easy to see if
other drugs did an intent to treat trial or a completer only trial. Completer only trials means you one see data
outcomes for those who completed the trial. These numbers are highly skewed since they do not represent those
who failed, dropped out, etc. A high quality trial would always use intent to treat to ensure that all data and all
patients are accounted for within the data. Ruxolitinib is the only therapy with an approved indication for
myelofibrosis. The pivotal phase 3 COMFORT studies included only patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF
(there were more high risk patients in the placebo arm 45 vs 54). Only the US trial included patients with high risk.
In the spleen reduction data the trial had 155 patients on active drug but data is only listed for 149 and 145
patients. Where is the data for these patients. In an intent to treat trial all of the patients would be accounted for
and their impact on the data shown. The 139 patients receiving ruxolitinib had a mean reduction in spleen volume
of 31.6%. Once again we see a reduction from the 155 patients enrolled in the active drug arm of the study. This
means that roughly 10% of the patients enrolled in the active drug arm have data that is not included in the clinical
trail outcomes data. Seventeen patients who received ruxolitinib (11.0%) and 16 patients who received placebo
(10.6%) discontinued the study treatment because of adverse events (of any grade). Twenty deaths occurred
during the study or within 28 days after the last dose was administered (9 deaths in the ruxolitinib group and 11
deaths in the placebo group, including 1 death after crossover). Principal causes of death in the ruxolitinib group
were muscle weakness and general deterioration, subdural hematoma, renal failure, non–small-cell lung cancer,
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pneumonia (in 2 patients), and sepsis (in 2 patients). Principal causes of death in
the placebo group were staphylococcal infection, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, multiorgan
failure, pneumonia, sepsis (in 2 patients), and disease progression (in 4 patients). So how does this data compare

with what is known about Imetelstat. In the arena of cancer treatments if a therapy can help even a small number
of patients it will be approved. When it comes to fatal diseases the ability to treat and save or sustain the life of
even a small number of patients is critical. If the drug were to get orphan drug status it allows for the company to
make some revenue of the drug while investigating other diseases the drug might be well suited to treat.

The longs remain convinced of Imet's success, perhaps even irrationally so. As a long of nearly 20 years, I
eventually lost all hope and am highly skeptical of GERN now. I did waver recently, mostly due to all the positive
posts and comments here, and I even came close buying shares again yesterday. But after reading this article, I'm
glad I didn't.


It's been my experience that shorts do more intensive research than longs, so I do not discount them as idiots. To
the contrary, I feel their point about Imet missing from the presentations is troubling. The appearance on one slide
could easily have been an oversight - a failure to delete it from the previous version, as it is very likely the old
slides were edited to prepare new slides, and it took intentional action to remove Imet from those slides.


Companies want to talk about every new drug they have in their pipeline, so removing one is significant and
something they would not have done without good reason, imo.


We are looking at circumstantial evidence here, but it is worrisome enough to make me wait for hard facts. If I miss
a big part of a price surge, so be it. In this case I'd rather be safe and certain, rather than take another risk on a
company/drug that has disappointed me for so many years.

been made ???

It’s not a mistake and not an omission. Starting mid last year the earning slides separate the RELEASED
drugs via collaboration from the PIPELINE (or in clinical stage) collaborations. 
Imetelstat is and has always been listed in the top pipeline list.

If you look at the earnings slides mentioned above, there is a distinct difference between the Q2 2017 slides and
the ones presented for Q1 2018. The slide 5 that shows the partnerships did show Imetelstat, but at the top is
states that these partnerships will be discussed further in the presentation. From J&J's EARNINGS CALL deck:
"During the course of this morning’s presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed
in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. Following is an acknowledgement of
those relationships:" The other drugs listed were mentioned subsequently, because they are driving revenue.
Imetelstat isn't yet approved, therefore it cannot drive revenue, and it was NOT discussed further in the
presentation. I believe that the 2017 slides showing Imetelstat were a copy/paste from another slide, and it was
just cleanup subsequent. IMO, the most recent slides are much tighter and cleaner. Also as mentioned previously,
the pipeline slide UPDATED as of April 17 2018 shows Geron at the top of the oncology pipeline. There is no
divorce forthcoming....

Also no discussion of the mds data yet again which suggests to me that it is fairly impeccable. The thing I always
come back to is 65 million is peanuts to jnj and if they feel they have good odds in any indication that they will sign.

This is the most persuasive short article yet. I am sure the price will drop hugely. Like it or not articles from AE
have a much larger impact on pps than ones by MTB. I think these pts were much sicker than he alleges or implies
and that OS is more desirable than the spleen primary endpoint but spleen size is the primary endpoint. The
patients were so sick jnj and gern probably did not want to risk using OS as a primary endpoint. I remember
discussions on this board about the fear they may have been too sick for a successful ct.

That's because shorts sell at the same as these articles in a concerted action and not because the articles
are persuasive. There is plenty of data in these posts to contradict all the points made above. Longs don't
buy on MTB news because the stock is going up. Longs buy now, like I did. I thought the same as you till I
realized an opinion thoroughly contradicted over and over again can't be having such an influence. There
has to be something behind it. A large short sale, but we won't find till we get the short publications later
on.

Conveniently left out the fact that Imetelstat is listed in the top position of the oncology pipeline in a slide that was
published a week ago...interesting that Janssen would be planning a divorce and fail to remove Imetelstat from the
top spot on the pipeline.


Misleading article, but not surprising.


26 Apr 2018, 09:05 AM


Curion
A better constructed article than the last time around. Many of the points in the article at least wrt the clinical
aspects are logical and can only be refuted by a data release. One key omission in the article is the impressive
data from IMERGE trial, which is likely to play a key role in future development.

Zach Hartman, Contributor
As I laid out in my most recent article, the analysis of "healthier" patients is spurious, at best, and the author here
has declined to respond to this charge in a meaningful way. The author has also rejected all calls to defend
positions in debate and in articles, preferring to focus on the most outsized, bullish predictions.


This is most unfortunate for the short thesis built here through carefully selective analysis.

You'll see him cherry picking comments and exclaiming ignorance to make himself feel better.


And then his word press account. Look at all the arguments he makes versus companies like AKAO and
youll see that while he does do an okay analysis. He's purposely ignoring things in order to make his
thesis sound better.


If you're short thats cool. But he uses SEO and weak criticisms to support his public image.


This to me means I shouldnt follow what he says.

Looking like his AKAO short thesis is going out the window.


The ADCOM for cUTI will go through, still a lot of debate about BSI but with the LPAD and speakers they
have it might end up being approved.


Since the small population for BSI they used cUTI study for safety data and while they cant 100% prove
the reduction in mortality in BSI the drug demonstrated non-inferiority to current standard of care.


We'll see in two hours but its looking like AKAO has a bright future.


02 May 2018, 02:20 PM

15-0 approved for cUTI at adcom.


11-4 failure for BSI.


Either way. He wasn't right a single bit about his short analysis on AKAO.

My favorite point #6: Survival data is not the most important one. 
Wow, National Institute of Cancer show give you an award.
You should be writing article together with David Avocado Wolfe about how gravity is toxic.
All these super rich old man from all over the world who pay cash for their treatment in best clinics around US, do
not care about survival.
According to your brilliant writing logic they should care about Something else.

JnJ just mentioned Imetelstat as one of their key pipeline drugs, and their only drug in the myeloid arena, in their

This might be a stupid question, but...
How can they (FDA) ethically allow a test for an experimental and (at least theoretically) life-saving drug
with a placebo? I'd be awful angry/dead if the drug worked and I was the placebo victim.


03 May 2018, 01:12 PM


telomerase
Far from a stupid question. In an "ethical" world, patients and doctors could make their own decisions
(especially in the case of terminal diseases with no cure). If someone wants placebo suicide volunteers,
they should have to pay them (which would be easy, there are plenty of starving people around the world
living in US-funded dictatorships who would love to be in a clinical trial).


But if we lived in that ethical world, most cancers would be cured and aging would already be treated,
rather than its symptoms...

@ GarthHarbel:


It's a thoughtful question that goes to the very nature of the drug discovery process in much of the world.
My two cents:


I believe that the short, and unsatisfying, answer is that both the legal boilerplate as well as any study-
specific clauses should disclose all of this upfront to the potential double-blind ct participant in the
participation agreement.


A slightly longer answer: On an ethical basis, I think that it's useful to think of the contrapositive. What if
double-blinds and control/placebo arms did not exist? How would the safety and efficacy of the drug be

clinically tested as against the best available current therapy or doing nothing? I realize that this is a
"greater good" argument that does nothing for the individual not given the experimental drug. But even as
regards the individual --


What if the drug candidate is not safe and/or effective? Then BAT or placebo turns out to have been the
"better" alternative. Of course there is the opportunity cost of the patient's not having taken another course
of therapy in order to participate in the ct.


Perhaps in the final analysis, double-blinds make the best of a less than ideal situation. A participant signs
on to take a chance at being given the experimental drug candidate, for better or for worse. And,
ultimately, the larger patient base benefits as well...
