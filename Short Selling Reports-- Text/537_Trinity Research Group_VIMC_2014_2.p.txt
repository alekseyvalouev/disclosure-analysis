More Evidence Of Vimicro's Falsified Contracts

Summary


Of the RMB 1.04 billion in total contracts announced by VIMC in its press releases,
only RMB 187.6 million, or just 18% were confirmed by government web sites.


Six of the contracts could not even be found, i.e. were either canceled and thus
removed or never existed at all.


Contract value was materially overstated in three cases.


Two of the contracts were actually granted to competitors of VIMC and not to VIMC.

1. A Review of VIMC's Gutting, Pumping, and Dumping


In our first report on Vimicro International Corporation ("VIMC"), we revealed how insiders
transferred out of VIMC and into their privately owned companies in excess of $600 million
of value derived largely from government grants intended to benefit VIMC exclusively. We
named the private vehicle (and its affiliates) to which all of VIMC's intrinsic value was
transferred "EmbezzleCo" and illustrated the transfer process in Exhibit 6 of our first
report. Below it is again for easy reference.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2772065-more-evidence-of-vimicros-falsified-contracts 2/11


As detailed in our first report, these assets, which rightfully belonged to VIMC investors,
were transferred at nominal cost to insiders starting in December of 2010 and ending in
April of 2013. Insiders gutted VIMC, transferring into EmbezzleCo, the highly profitable
Vimicro Wuxi (which is planning an estimated $146 million IPO in China, where VIMC
shareholders cannot lay legal claim to it), lucrative real estate assets now worth an
estimated $538 million, and millions of dollars of government funding commitments.
Shareholders were left holding the VIMC of today, an unprofitable cash-burning shell.


As we analyzed in the last section of our first report, VIMC is propped by financials
manufactured through the use of related parties, such as the joint venture Zhongtianxin.
These related parties generate fake sales for VIMC that pile up as accounts receivable on
the balance sheet without being fully collected, which leads to a severe net cash burn to
support the VIMC illusion (refer to Exhibits 18 and 19 of our first report).


We believe these related parties, organized after the 2011-2014 transfer of value from
shareholders, were set up mainly to provide insiders the opportunity to pump and dump
VIMC's share price by announcing a flurry of highly promotional press releases of
purported contract wins.


This entire four-year process, which we consider the worst case of embezzlement we
have ever seen, culminated in the heaviest insider selling in VIMC's history and is
illustrated below in Exhibit 2. The blue line tracks the stock price throughout this period,
the black stars denote the timing of the aforementioned promotional press releases, and
the red bars show the timing and considerable size of insider sales.

As you can see, the tale of the tape overlaid with the timing of significant corporate events
paints a picture worth thousands of words.


After over a decade of operations, and right after the EmbezzleCo transfers, insiders
would have you believe that VIMC suddenly won dozens of government contracts that
promised almost $200 million in future revenue for VIMC. Shouldn't insiders want to buy,
and not sell, on that incredible turn in fortune? Why, then, would insiders sell so much of
their holdings during such an exciting time in VIMC's history?


The purpose of this report is to reveal why: because the vast majority of the nearly $200
million of future revenue does not exist.


2. Insiders Never Buy, Only Sell


First, we note a couple of telling facts. There have been zero insider buys since VIMC's
IPO.


Exhibit 3: VIMC's Historical Insider Transactions (All Sales)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2772065-more-evidence-of-vimicros-falsified-contracts 5/11


We searched all SEC records and could not find one single instance of an insider buying a
single share of VIMC, even when the shares were trading significantly below $1/ADS!
Even as the company was promising investors a pipeline of nearly $200 million of
government contracts, not one share was bought in almost a decade of being public. This
is so anomalous that we cannot think of any other company for which it is true.


Equally damning is the fact that renowned private equity firm General Atlantic, who had
access to all insider information since the company's IPO and had been invested since
2005, sold all its holdings at under $1.97, or nearly 70% cheaper to the last closing price
on December 18, 2013 and on January 15, 2014. Not exactly a vote of confidence for
VIMC's public shareholders who have only a fraction of the information and knowledge
that the private equity insiders most certainly had as they sold every share they owned.

It did not take us long to find out why insiders were in such a hurry to sell their shares.


3. Alarming Review of Government Records


In China, local governments routinely disclose to the public where "the People's" money is
being allocated. Especially, when investments, grants, and commercial contracts are
involved, details are disclosed on local government web sites. Naturally, if VIMC is telling
the truth about its pipeline of government contracts, these government records should
match VIMC's promotional press releases.


Exhibit 5 (below) summarizes the findings from our research of the web sites of the
various local government customers disclosed in VIMC's press releases.


Exhibit 5: Contract Values - VIMC Press Releases vs. Official Government
Announcements

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2772065-more-evidence-of-vimicros-falsified-contracts 7/11


We note the following alarming findings:


1. Of the RMB 1.04 billion in total announced by VIMC in its press releases, only RMB
187.6 million, or just 18% were confirmed by government web sites


2. Six of the contracts could not even be found, i.e. were either canceled and thus
removed or never existed at all


3. Contract value was materially overstated in three cases, which we detail below in
Exhibits 6-8


4. Two of the contracts were actually granted to competitors of VIMC and not to VIMC,
who apparently took credit for their competitors' wins in its press releases


Exhibit 5 references the links to the evidence. In Exhibits 6-8 (below), we call out
separately the three cases in which the press releases very materially overstated future
contract revenue.


Exhibit 6: Official Announcement of Budget for Ziyang City Surveillance Project

As noted in Exhibit 5, the press release associated with this deal announced that China
Unicom was VIMC's deployment partner. Although we could not find any mention of VIMC
in the government web site, Exhibit 6 shows only RMB 1.7 million was collected by China
Unicom, and not the RMB 55.3 million announced in VIMC's press release.


Exhibit 7: Official Announcement of Budget for Taiyuan Traffic Surveillance Project

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2772065-more-evidence-of-vimicros-falsified-contracts 9/11


VIMC's press release claimed RMB 76 million for the project shown in Exhibit 7 with the
Traffic Police department of Taiyuan, more than twice the RMB 30.9 million allocated by
the Taiyuan government.


Exhibit 8: Official Announcement of Budget for Taiyuan Traffic Surveillance Project, Phase
II

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2772065-more-evidence-of-vimicros-falsified-contracts 10/11


Exhibit 8 shows the third case of very material overstatement in VIMC's press releases.
The project, Phase II of a traffic surveillance project in Taiyuan, had a total budget of RMB
66.9 million, but VIMC announced RMB 244 million, nearly four times the real amount, of
future contracted revenue instead.


Since all of VIMC's revenue is generated from the Chinese government, what does this
evidence say about VIMC's financials?


The question, of course, is rhetorical, and we remind investors that VIMC is an optionable
security that can be shorted by buying puts or selling calls (or both).

Did you provide this information to the exchange or the SEC? This is horrible

Will Vanguard, Contributor
Why hasn't the SEC shut this down! unbelievable that traders are buying into a fraud that is clearly laid out!

Unbelievable that people are shorting a stock which rise 100% after they short it! 
That's why most people lose money in stock market. Even give them a stock which can rise 100%, they go
ahead to short them. lol

How much you lose on shorting VIMC? You basically short it at its absolute bottom price and should lose almost
100% now.
