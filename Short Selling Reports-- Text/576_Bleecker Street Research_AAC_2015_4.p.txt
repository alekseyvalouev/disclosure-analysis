American Addiction Centers: Grand Jury Testimony Creates Doubts
About AAC's Defense

Summary


Grand jury testimony shows that the chief coroner believes that the patient would not
have died if he had constant access to oxygen.


This undermines AAC's claim that the patient died of natural causes as the primary
defense from the company.


Testimony from Jose Ochoa also tells the story of Jerrod Menz fleeing from the
Irongate facility - where the patient died - with a garbage bag filled with prescriptions
"house meds".


AAC Holding's (NASDAQ:AAC) main defense since the news that Jerrod Menz and
serveral others as well as the Forterus subsidiary were indicted on second degree murder
has been that the coroner's report stated that the patient died of natural causes. New
evidence from the Grand Jury has surfaced however that reveals that this defense is
questionable as the lead coroner believes that the patient would still be alive if he
had access to supplemental oxygen. Further testimony describes eyewitness accounts
of Jerrod Menz fleeing the scene of the crime with a garbage bag full of "house meds."


AAC's Defense


From the first day that the news broke, AAC's main defense has been that the coroner
ruled that the patient had died of natural causes.


On the second quarter conference call:


"We firmly believe that the California Department of Justice case is without merit. We
will vigorously defend the company and each individual in court. The case involves
the death in 2010 of a client who was found dead of natural causes in his room
the morning after he checked into one of our facilities."


And later on that same conference call:

"We are not currently aware of any evidence that the company or any of these
individuals charged were responsible for the resident's death. The coroner
concluded the client died of hypertension cardiovascular disease. The
individual also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
according to a police report. The coroner made absolutely no findings that the
death had anything to do with his treatment at our facility."


However, the Chief Coroner believes that the patient died from a lack of oxygen, not
from natural causes.


In testimony from the Grand Jury, however, Riverside County Chief Coroner Dr. Joseph
Cohen suggested otherwise. Dr. Fajardo did the first autopsy and concluded that the
patient had died of natural causes. However, the Chief Coroner of Riverside County has a
policy where in the case of an unattended death and there were pre-existing medical
conditions, that an effort to find out whether or not the pre-existing medical conditions
played into the death. However, in the case of the patient's death, Dr. Cohen concluded
that Dr. Fajardo had not investigated the patient's previous medical condition. In his sworn
testimony, Dr. Cohen stated that he believed if Dr. Fajardo had investigated the oxygen
issues, the medical records, and the drug issues that he would have found that the patient
died of a lack of oxygen.


In one powerful exchange, Dr. Cohen states that the patient would still be alive if he had a
constant flow of supplemental oxygen.

on page 1304.


Jerrod Menz Fleeing the Crime Scene


In the last article on AAC, the issue of the "house supply" of drugs was raised. At the time,
Forterus and AAC would have a supply of drugs that had not been prescribed to the
patients, but were used to detox patients before they had seen a doctor. AAC has never
addressed these allegations.

Jose Ochoa's grand jury testimony tells the story of Jerrod Menz fleeing the crime scene
after the patient's death with a garbage bag filled with prescription medicine.


According to testimony from Janelle Ito-Orille, who works for the California Department of
Health Care Services, and now works there as a supervisor. In her testimony, she says
that the drugs that Jerrod Menz was driving away from the facility with, should
never have even been there in the first place.


You can view the full excerpt of her testimony here.


Jose Ochoa was a senior counselor at A Better Tomorrow [Forterus] at the time when the
patient died. In his court testimony, he describes shocking scenes of Jerrod Menz fleeing
the scene of the crime with a garbage bag that was filled with approximately 5 pounds of
prescription medication. Again, it is worth noting that this is not some disgruntled former
employee, but testimony in a court under oath. You can view the entirety of the exchange
here.

Jose Ochoa was going to leave the Irongate facility and go to the Corning facility in a red
truck. He spoke with Jerrod Menz and Jim Fent for 15-20 minutes before leaving and,
according to Ochoa, the black 32-gallon trash bag filled with prescription drugs. When
they were leaving, Jerrod Menz tossed the keys to his new Ford to Mr. Ochoa and took
the black garbage bag to the red truck and drove off. At this time Ochoa testified that there
were plainclothes detectives at the Irongate facility.


Ochoa drove Menz's new Ford to the Corning facility. Once there, Ochoa testifies
that he saw the red truck in the parking lot, and when Ochoa entered the Corning
facility he saw Jerrod Menz and the black trash bag, still filled with the medication.


Conclusion


Given that AAC's main defense all along has been that the patient died of natural causes,
the revelation that the lead coroner believes that the patient would still be alive if he had
access to supplemental oxygen is a huge deal. And Jerrod Menz's actions of leaving the
Irongate facility simply add to the laundry list of sketchy and questionable things that AAC
employees and the company have done.

I own 4 state licensed outpatient MAT clinics in PA. ( the largest in Western PA ) We average about 2-3 deaths per
year over the last decade in business. Every death is reviewed by a special board setup by the PA Dept of Health.
Unfortunately it comes with the business because you are dealing with a very high risk patient population. Unlike AAC
we are a OP facility so our deaths don't happen in our clinics and almost all are from overdose deaths due to
polysubstance abuse ( mixing say opiates with BZD's etc ). We always follow the states standard of care and are
always cleared of any wrongdoing. This could very well be the case with AAC but only time will tell. I have met the
owner/founder of AAC and he is a reputable honest businessman who cares about his patients. I don't know if this
grand jury testimony is true or not about him "running out with bag of "house meds"? I do know that this business is
huge and growing at 12% annually so even if they didn't follow the CA standard of care I feel the company will go on
and recover from this. This is a tough industry to operate in and we deal with a very challenging patient population. I

guess time will tell how this plays out but if I had to guess I think the company will survive this in the end. The industry
is just to big and hot currently. AAC has built up a large group of centers and is still the only "Pure Play" trading. I
would have been concerned if BOFA pulled their letter of credit or other creditors accused them of violating their
covenants but I saw none of that? The SEC also doesn't seemed concerned about disclosure issues so although this
will hurt them for some time I see the stock coming back.

I have worked in the addictions field. And, I have owned an IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program). Unfortunately, most
are own by businessmen or by former addicts who either see the money which can be made or who, now that they
are clean and sober, be one idealistic and want to save the world. Very, very few are owned and run by psychologists
or other properly trained and licensed mental health professionals. Learned the story of how AAC started and
expanded. They are run, even if they have good intentions, by business who are not mental healthcare professionals.
They follow a different set of ethics. The challenges AAC is experiencing tells more about the failures of the addiction
treatment industry in general rather than the moral or ethical failures of AAC in particular.

So you being a "trained psychologist or other properly trained and licensed mental health professionals."
made you run a better clinic than somebody who was a serial entrepreneur that has started numerous
successful healthcare companies or a former addict who is extremely passionate about truly helping people
and has actually been thru it? Or somebody who is both those things? ( which is myself and the founders of
AAC ) So how many IOP locations do you have now? How many people have you helped due to your stellar
business acumen? Yeah thats what I thought! Is it even still in business and if not did you sell it to a larger
organization which could continue helping this much underserved population of opiate addicts in the US
currently? I am just amazed sometimes??????

So now with the recent news, the murder case is slowly going away and the company is diversifying its lab business.
The latter will take away the short thesis about the high margin urine test dependency. Also, it should be good for
margins when you compare AAC to DGX or LH. Granted the DSOs need to come down, but with the other issues on
the mend, and a 50% short position what is not to like?
