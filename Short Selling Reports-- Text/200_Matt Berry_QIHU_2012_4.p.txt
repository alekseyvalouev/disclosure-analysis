Qihoo's ARPU: Playing Games With Investors
Jul. 23, 2012 6:11 AM ET13 comments
by: Matt Berry


Qihoo's games are the same; the revenue is out of line with other game platforms.


First, let's clear one thing up. Qihoo's (NYSE:QIHU) games are not different from its
competitors' games. Look at the identical games hosted by both Qihoo and Renren
(NYSE:RENN):


[1) Like pop songs, the games will eventually be replaced with newer games. 2) To
simplify communication in English and to help readers independently verify the facts, I
have used Google translations of the Chinese games. 3) The slide above was taken from
a presentation on the same topic here.

The preceding images show identical games found on both Qihoo and Renren. But this is
just one of many available comparisons. There are many other platforms offering the
same games as well. For example, there is a popular web game in China written as "神仙
道" - which Google translates as "Immortal." Below you will find some of the many online
operators of this very same game. For each bullet below, click on the link next to the
operator (as translated by Google) and you will arrive on a competitor's game platform. On
arriving at the login page, look at the logo and compare it to the Chinese Characters for
"Immortal": 神仙道. This is the same game that Qihoo is offering.

Click here and you'll see that Qihoo's wan.360.cn is just one of many game operators. The
CFO stated that the games were ranked on the page according to popularity. He also said
that the top 10 games brought in 60 to 70% of web game revenue. (here) In the
presentation I have prepared (click here), you can click through to multiple operators for
each of the top 16 games (July 15, 2012) on wan.360.cn's home page.


The second thing we need to clear up is what Qihoo says about its game revenue. It is not
in-line with competitors.


Let's step back a bit and review the key metric. How much does each user spend on web
games? From a company's perspective, that's thought of as the Average Revenue Per
Paying User (ARPPU technically, but with Qihoo and many others, correctly or incorrectly,
it is referred to simply as ARPU).


64.5 RMB, that's the average monthly ARPU I found in a sample of seven Chinese
companies with online game businesses. (Source material in presentation: here)

Qihoo says that their game business is "different" and that they don't "compare." Well, no
kidding. Qihoo sticks out like a CEO in an orange jumpsuit.


(Qihoo actually said last May that they had 440 ARPU. But "440" is so painfully off the
chart that I'm going to help out. Let's say that the CFO meant Average Revenue per
Paying User before splitting revenue with developers 70:30 ‒ so I trimmed 30% off the
top. (He didn't say that, but I'm just trying to give him the best footing possible.)


Alex Xu, CFO of Qihoo, Q1 2012 conference Call [Time: 47:18 ] (The emphasis is mine,
here and throughout this article.)


Jan basically, as I mentioned the game business at the end of the 3rd quarter … I'm
sorry, March, we have 87 games up and running on the platform, 139,000 paid
customers … uh, paid players and the ARPU for the month was about 440 RMB
per month.

That's an equivalent of $70…in China. What was he thinking? Certainly he misspoke?


See, if he didn't mean ARPU before revenue share, then the number becomes even more
difficult to believe, as pointed out by this interviewer.


(From the i Wall Street Snowball column; professionally translated)


Question: "If your game revenue is all shared income, then according to your
published figures, on average every paying game player, every month, will spend
around 550 RMB on games. Is this a normal (level) of expense?"


[Qihoo CFO "Alex"] Xu Zuoli: "Our ARPU is 400 RMB, which is identical to the
average value of the overwhelming majority of domestic web-based game
companies and platforms, and is nothing special." ~


Title: "Qihoo Zuo Li, Xu, CFO: navigation page income 70% of the total advertising"
Feb. 25, 2012 Original article: "奇虎CFO徐祚立：导航页收入占整体广告70%"


For those hoping for some official clarity…hoping that Qihoo surely had set the record
straight in official, SEC filed documents…Well, they did offer clarity...in an SEC filing and
in response to accusations that their ARPU was out of line, so you'd have to think that
they got it right this time…right?


The monthly ARPU has been fairly stable at around RMB380.


This claim was filed with the SEC in December 2011 here.


Then in May Qihoo says their ARPU for March was 440! Qihoo truly is a unique company.
It is so unique it does not even compare to its own prior statements. Is its ARPU 260 in
October through December '11? Is it a stable 380 in December '11? Did the CFO really
mean 440 in March '12? But what else? When challenged with the extremity of the ARPU,
he declared it to be 400 in the iWallstreet interview. If that was net of revenue share with
developers, does that mean that we can have 550 gross ARPU? Who really knows?
Tencent, a web game powerhouse, comes in at less than 50.


Qihoo says that its number is in-line with others. Analysts have also said that Qihoo's
ARPU is in-line with other web game operators in China. How is this possible? (If this is
not a bluff, analysts, show your cards. Some examples are in order here. Where are they?
Who are the "others"? )

https://seekingalpha.com/article/739371-qihoos-arpu-playing-games-with-investors 6/12


The out-of-line ARPU was first brought to public attention by Citron Research. Qihoo
declared in return that their revenue was in-line with others -- but without providing
examples. However, at the same time they also claimed that their games were "different" -
- they didn't do Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games.


"Qihoo 360's gaming ARPU is not comparable to that of other publicly listed Chinese
gaming companies because almost all of them are focusing mainly on MMORPG
games." ~ filed with the SEC, Qihoo 360 Responds to the Citron Report


"Qihoo 360's web game ARPU is very much in line with other major Non-Social
WEB game developers and platforms in China. Yet the short sellers tried to mislead
the public by comparing our ARPU to that of MMORPG game developers or SOCIAL
game platforms. Comparing our Non-Social WEB games with MMORPG games
or SOCIAL games is like comparing apples to oranges." ~ Short-Sellers Are Wrong
Because Qihoo 360 Is Different


How can this be a good thing? MMO games earn more than casual games.


Shek Hon Lo - Tencent SVP and Deputy CFO:


In terms of the ARPU range for MMOG is 90 to 130 per quarter and advanced
casual game is between 50 to 95.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/739371-qihoos-arpu-playing-games-with-investors 7/12


(To be conservative, I didn't take an average, but put Qihoo in the best light possible in the
comparison: I took the top numbers, then divided by 3 for monthly consistency -- monthly
ARPUs of MMO games came in at 43 RMB and Casual Games at 32 RMB.)


Here's what iResarch has to say:


And all the survey results indicated that the users of large & medium sized casual
games had the lowest average age and the lowest personal monthly income. ~
(here)


As we have seen, Qihoo's ARPU is definitely not in-line with other web game operators. A
"stable" 380 ARPU is not in the same ballpark as an average of 65. Hosting non-MMO
games only makes these numbers even more painful to look at. We are not just
comparing apples to apples, we are comparing this very apple to itself: Qihoo's gamers
are not playing the same "type" of games as competitors … but the very same games.


Now here's a rare chance to look under the hood. Two of the games hosted on Qihoo's
wan.360.cn are known in English as "Shen Qu" and "DDTank."


They are included in Changyou.com Inc.'s SEC filing:


Average revenue recognized per active charging accounts for 7Road's games were
RMB50, an increase of 32% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was mainly due to
players' average spending level for Shen Qu, which is a role-playing game, being
higher than it is for DDTank, which is an action game.


~ 6-K as Filed with SEC & as reported on Changyou.com.


Now there are two sides to every transaction. ARPU isn't "just revenue." You can't just pull
revenue by the ears out of a black hat. It's got to come from someone else. So ARPU also
tells us what gamers spend. Take Qihoo's 139,000 gamers and as an average they only
have so much money. We are supposed to believe that gamers were spending about $70
USD in March on Qihoo's games. China People's Daily Online said in 2011 that the
average monthly salary for "fresh college graduates" was 2,500 yuan, about $400 USD.
(here)


Factsanddetails.com reports:


About 70 percent of the [online game] players have an average monthly salary of
around $300 month but many are students with no income. (here)

There are only so many ways to slice up a budget, but the more slices you make the
thinner each piece must be (unless you're just telling stories). How much would the
average person spend on virtual goods through Qihoo that they wouldn't spend through
Renren?


Same games, same platforms,…but different revenue? Same chunk of cheese to start
with … yet when you look at the pizza, you know whose two-pound chunk of cheese
actually passed through the cheese grater and whose didn't.


Whose cheese got grated and whose didn't?

the ARPU of Changyou.com is also not very comparable.


Note this in Changyou's filing: 
"Average revenue recognized per active charging accounts is defined as net revenues recognized by 7Road for the
period divided by the number of active charging accounts for the same period. "


with most of 7road's game are under profit-sharing agreement with its operators(inclduing QIHU), 7road's recorded its
revenue on a net basis, which is only the part that operator remitted to 7road are being recorded, the other part of
revenue are recorded by its operator(inclduing QIHU).


such, the ARPU of one game, e.g. ShenQu, should not be judged by one company's ARPU, but rather the total of the
developer and the operators. And, it should not be used in comparison.


23 Jul 2012, 10:03 PM


Matt Berry, Contributor
Author’s reply »  The Changyou.com ARPU used for the charts excluded 7Roads revenue.


"The Company’s operational results for the first quarter of 2012, which exclude those of 7Road’s Web-based games,
were as follows: .... 
ARPU for the Company’s games slightly increased 2% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year to RMB225." SEC
6-K http://1.usa.gov/LJt70Y (Also reported in Earnings Call Transcript. (divided by 3 for monthly comparison) ARPU
75 RMB.


SOHU has an interest in Changyou and reports the same number: http://bit.ly/LK4xSf


That said, 7road's game revenue gives us a rare look under the hood, as I mentioned. That is why I included it in the
text. Shen Qu is the second ranking game on Qihoo's site. DDTank is also in the top 16. The CFO said there were no
dominant games. If QIHU shares with developers 70:30, you can see that no matter how you reconstruct game
revenue Qihoo's numbers aren't realistic. Neither "net" nor "gross" numbers come close.

Your logic is a mess.... You said the are same with other game operators--- but they are all web game opertors; but
when you compared the ARPU, you choose Tencent, Giant, Shanda, they are all client game operators... what a
mess... Apple to Orange means web game to client game, you challenge Qihoo, but you use apple to compare with
orange...what's your logic?


23 Jul 2012, 11:01 PM


rain163
You said Qihoo's games are same to other game operators, but actually, they don't say they are different with web
game operators, Alex means, different with client game operators. What you selected for comparison of the game
portfolio are all web game operators. But when you compare the ARPU, you select the client game operators' ARPU.
You selectively choose the information with a mess logic. Very pity to see this artical.

Author’s reply »  Logic recap: 
1.Qihoo's games are not unusual. They are the same games found elsewhere. There is no exclusivity. 
2. Other publically traded companies disclose ARPU, or at least data from which to calculate ARPU. EG,
Qihoo's game site is very similar to Renren's. There are many identical games that both share. Both publish
statistics and revenue. Their revenue per user does not compare. 
3. "Alex means...." If you are not putting words in Alex's mouth, please provide your reference and elaborate.


RE: Differences between companies. Don't forget: It is not just how much the game companies pull in, but
how much gamers spend on average ... not to mention how much they are ABLE to spend. A 440 ARPU is
unrealistic, however which way you look at it. If it is net ARPU (IE, after revenue share with developers), then
we are supposed to believe that the average Qihoo gamer paid 630 RMB in March for virtual goods. $100
USD? What's so special about Qihoo's web game platform? Same games...

Other Analysts have said that QIHU's ARPU is in-line with other game operators/companies. Do you agree?


If so, can you provide examples of web game operators/companies with over 100,000 gamers and who have
monthly ARPUs near 300 RMB?


>however, players on Facebook's FarmVillie are different from players on some other unknow platfrom which
also operating FarmVillie, isnt it?


(Nice mention: FarmeVille's ZNGA is at this moment providing smelling salts to star-gazing investors.)


Differences in ARPU: There would be some difference of course due to differences in venue and user mix --
just as a theater ticket in a retirement community would cost less on average than a ticket in a community of
just-employed 25 year-olds. But ...


1. The factors which accounted for the difference could be broken down and illustrated and examples could
be produced. For Qihoo’s ARPU no factors have been illustrated; no examples have been produced ‒ even
though this sort of evidence would greatly aid Qihoo’s prospects.


2. The difference would not be 300 to 400%.


>>> And, operators' ability to monetize from their players are different, either. Qihu could target their game
players very precisely through their web browser (over 50% penetration by the way), by analyzing user's

1. Provide references so that we know you are not filling in the gaps of Qihoo's story with your own
convenient rationalizations.


2. How would Qihoo be capable of Analyzing users behavior in a way that competitors could not and that was
not also an intrusion of privacy and/or a use of spyware? (Two acts which Qihoo has been accused of in the
past and at the present.)

Hi Matt, sorry my title bothers you, yes i work for Qihoo, but i speak just for myself only, because i'm no
difference to an ordinary staff. i believe our discussion here is for communication and exchange of opinions,
not some official Q&As.


Regarding to your questions, i think maybe its related to some trusting issues, qihoo is new to the market
especially US investors and need more time to prove itself to the investors. i believe if you have time to make
a travel to China, you'll see how popular Qihoo is and will believe its integrity.

Author’s reply »  2nq 2012 CC ... QIHU alters the ARPU story, now counting quarterly instead of monthly. QIHU has
moved from a stable 380 MONTHLY ARPU to a QUARTERLY 400.


He also adds "Gross" to the numbers, making the result a little more believable this time (albeit still high for these
types of games).


Before: "The monthly ARPU has been fairly stable at around RMB380."


Latest CC: "Total web game playing users reach 148,000 in June. Web game gross ARPU for this quarter was
approximately RMB400."

Let's forget about .... "March, we have 87 games up and running on the platform, 139,000 paid customers … uh, paid
players and the ARPU for the month was about 440 RMB per month."


So either QIHU is lying or they took a serious hit to game revenue. I'll let them have the last word on that:


"Internet value-added service revenue, which are mainly derived from web games, were $21.7 million, up 167% from
same period last year and 4% from the prior quarter. The strong year-over-year performance was mainly driven by
solid growth in our game user base."

(Try to reconstruct their revenue with the given numbers.)
