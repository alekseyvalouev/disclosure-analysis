iBio Overvalued

Two years ago, in February 2009, iBio Inc. (IBIO)
traded for 20 cents a share. It has recently reached
as high as $6 a share, representing tremendous
3,000 percent gains for long-term shareholders.
However, the company's stock price appreciation
has far outpaced the operational growth of the
company, and as such, the company is highly
vulnerable to sharp contractions in its share price should anticipated positive catalysts
fail to materialize.


Investors have been drawn to the story at iBio. It is one of only a handful of companies
exploring the cutting-edge scientific research frontier in recombinant proteins. One of the
largest and most widely-known of these companies is Protalix (PLX) which has an
upcoming FDA decision on its Phase III drug candidate Uplyso. Protalix has provided
outstanding returns to investors who have stuck with the company over the past few
years. Is similar optimism at iBio justified, or is iBio merely riding high on the coattails of
a much more accomplished competitor?


iBio has two research firms that cover the stock. Both firms are bullish on the company's
shares and have price targets of $6 and $8 on the company. You can find the Goldman
Small Cap Research (not affiliated in any way with Goldman Sachs bank) report here,
and the Noble Financial report here. These reports cite several reasons for their bullish
outlooks.

For one, the company has a Phase I H1N1 vaccine in its pipeline, and is currently
performing several studies. But having a Phase I H1N1 vaccine is not sufficient
justification for iBio's tremendous rise in the past two years.


The company has also announced a deal in January with Fiocruz/Bio-Manguinhos of
Brazil that gives that company the opportunity to develop and manufacture vaccines
based on iBio's proprietary iBioLaunch platform. However, the product that would be
generated by this partnership, a yellow fever vaccine, is also only entering Phase 1
testing. It will be quite awhile, if ever, until the company is able to significantly monetize
anything from this partnership.


And from this comes the crux of iBio's problem. Like many small biotech firms, the
company does not have much cash, and it's drugs under development will require far
more funding than the company presently has available to it. As of its September 30,
2010 filing, the company had a mere $314,000 in cash. The company addressed this
capital shortfall by completing a 4 million share private placement at $2 a share, with
warrants for the purchasers to buy more stock at any point at in the next five years at
$2.20 a share. This will provide the company working capital for a few quarters, though
as the AIDS studies get going, the rate of cash burn should rise.


Despite iBio's incessant talk of licensing deals and the continual reminders of
investments and third-party commitments by the U.S. government and the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation, the company failed to generate any revenue whatsoever in its latest
fiscal year. This marks a significant decline from the more than $1 million that iBio
generated in revenue in 2009. The operating loss for the company swelled to more than
$6 million in the fiscal year 2010 as revenue evaporated. This loss includes, as reported
in the company's last 10-K (note 6, page F-13), a $1.4 million loss due to the change in
the value of outstanding warrants on the company's stock. In addition to this loss, the
company's management and board of directors have been granting themselves more
equity in the company at levels far below the current $5.50 a share market price, further
reducing shareholder value.

The company simply is not developed enough nor does it have enough near-term
revenue prospects to justify anything close to its current $175 million market cap. The
company has a mere three full-time employees according to its most recent 10-K. It had
no revenue in the 2010 fiscal year. It spent a pittance, a mere $2,517,000, on R&D in
the fiscal year of 2010, and it had less that half a million dollars of cash at the time of
that report. The dilutive financing of last fall will give the company enough cash to last a
few quarters, but it is not a long-term solution. The company will need much greater
funding sources to get its Phase I candidates down the long and costly road to FDA
approval. And the company's recent financing left a significant warrant overhang at
$2.20 a share – far below the current market price.


The bullish case is a case of faith in an untested company. Proponents of the stock,
such as Ian Cassal, herald iBio as having a “true paradigm shifting technology.” This
may or may not be true. However, it is clear you are paying a high price for the potential
of paradigm-shifting technology at the present. The company's $175 million market cap
bakes in a whole lot of optimism. While the company's technology has the potential to
do great things in the future, iBio's stock has acted as if the technology has already
been successfully proven. Very rarely does one see a $175 million market cap company
with no revenue whatsoever in its latest fiscal year. Additionally, even other analysts with
buy ratings on the stock don't see many more gains forthcoming. With price targets of
$6 and $8, neither Goldman Small Cap Research nor Noble Financial predict great
upside from current prices.


Given all the above commentary, iBio stock appears to be significantly overvalued, and
is vulnerable to large corrections in the coming months. Potential downside catalysts
include but are not limited to:


iBio needing to go to the capital market for more financing.1.


The FDA's decision on Uplyso which is being heralded as a test for the whole
research field of recombinant proteins (see this informative article for more
background).


2.


Any failures or setbacks in the various Phase I projects iBio is involved in.3.


The potential for massive profit-taking from insiders who are holding stock from far
lower prices.

A dumping of shares from recent promoters of the stock. IBIO has been receiving a
flood of promotional pumping both at SeekingAlpha and on internet message boards.


5.


I presently assign a “sell” rating to IBIO shares and have a 12-month price target of
$2.50. If you wish to invest in the recombinant protein field of research, Protalix is a
much more reasonably-priced investment option. 


Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any
positions within the next 72 hours.
