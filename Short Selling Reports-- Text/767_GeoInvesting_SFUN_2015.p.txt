Chinese Media Reports Allege 'Fake Contract' Trouble Brewing At
Soufun

Summary


Widespread layoffs at Soufun being reported in China have reportedly come as a
result of “faked contracts” employees were involved in creating.


Other outlets report that Soufun may have had knowledge that these fake
transactions were taking place.


Soufun has not made any disclosures in the U.S. regarding these layoffs and owes
investors and regulators some answers.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


GeoInvesting members had an advanced look at this article earlier this morning. This time

We have once again found information that has been released in China and may not have
been thoroughly explained and disseminated in the United States. This time it involves
Soufun (NYSE:SFUN), a real estate holding company that's headquartered in Beijing,

China. Soufun trades under SFUN on the NYSE and at a price of around $7, has a $2.9
billion market cap.


We believe the organized information we are presenting speaks to the importance of our
unique brand of due diligence and access to information which may not be available in the
U.S. We use this information to help investors protect their portfolios in cases just like this
one.


We recently uncovered several articles from Chinese media sources, such as this one in
SINA Finance, regarding a large scale employee layoff incident at SFUN. When
translated, this news report (paraphrased) states that:


"……Up to 1,000 brokerage employees from SFUN's secondary housing business in
the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu received a layoff text message from the
company on September 28, [2015]. SFUN says it fired these brokers due to faked
contracts during their tenure at the company."


It was also reported in the article that some of the laid-off employees came together to
protest in front of SFUN's offices in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai.


After further research, it seems to us that things may be more serious than they sounded
in the initial report. For example, in this article written by Southern Metropolis Daily, it is
reported that:


"……part of the brokers told [the reporter] that they want to 'protest' because SFUN
has known these activities (fake contracts) all the time, which is equal to an
'acquiescence'."


We don't know if the report is true or not regarding SFUN having knowledge of these fake
transactions, but if it is true, then SFUN owes an explanation not just to its investors, but
to regulators.

Further research led us to some Tieba message board threads (a discussion group
platform offered by BIDU), on which former and current employees of SFUN make posts
or comment on other people's posts. Below are some of the posts that we found:


1.


"Deducting salary? Fake contracts? No place to complain? Forced to sign unequal
agreement? Everybody complain together, I am from the city of Hongzhou and
welcome people who are hurt by SFUN to join the chat group 103229877….."

"SFUN in city of Shanghai did the same thing to fire employees…

According to this Chinese article on October 16, 2015, SFUN responded to the media
regarding this issue. The article states (paraphrased):


"On October 16, [2015], the department of publicity of SFUN wrote an email to China
Business Daily that the firing [of employees] due to fake [contracts] recently is not
the first time. In May of this year, broker Liu in the rental business department was
found during a routine investigation to have 3 fake contracts out of 56 contracts in
month of April, and [Liu] was fired by SFUN. In the same month, the investigation
centered in the city of Shanghai sampled transacted contracts and found that three
employees, including Chen, conducted photoshopping of ownership information in
the submitted contract attachment [to the company], and the photo of three parties
[in the transaction] was obtained online. These three employees were also fired due
to fake contracts.


Although both parties (meaning fired employees and the company) are holding up to
their own argument, SFUN didn't give the exact number of the employees that have
been fired."


Conclusion


After conducting our research on this issue, we believe that this incident deserves
more attention from public investors. First of all, our analysis of the articles online and
threads on the discussion boards make us question whether or not middle management
could have knowledge of some of these fake contracts being perpetuated. These types of
fake contracts are outside the realm of what normal retail investors would be able to
research when looking at a company; therefore we believe this should cast a shadow of
scrutiny on SFUN.


Our major takeaways from this analysis are:

SFUN may be undergoing initiatives to try to prevent further fake contracts in its rental
housing business. This incident, however, presents undeniable risk for investors, as
the systemic integrity of SFUN's business appears to be in question.
The incidents involving fake contracts may be an indication of management's weak
internal controls. Does SFUN's management know that contracts have been faked
long before this incident?
We believe, at this point, it is reasonable for investors to ask whether or not fake
transactions have been discovered/exist in any other portion of SFUN's business.
So far, there has been no official press release issued by the company regarding this
incident, including the potential effect on the company and magnitude of the employee
layoff. It is unclear how much employee headcount has increased since 2014 for the
company, but according to the company's 20-F in 2014 (p.88), SFUN's total headcount
is 11,642 in 2014. It also says that its sales and marketing team is made up of 4,468
employees. If the above report is true that up to 1,000 employees might be fired (not
confirmed), then it accounts for 8.6% of the total company headcount and 22.4% of the
sales and marketing team, using the company's 2014 number. Investors deserve to
know this information in a timely manner.
The large scale layoff of employees might also be due to the company having to cut
costs in order to meet the Street's estimates.
It's unknown whether the fake contracts in question will negatively affect the
company's previous financial statements, but this incident does give us caution about
SFUN's upcoming Q3 report.

Well, thank you for passing on the information from China.


I do have some objections though. First of all, who says that a middle manager who asks an employee to fake his
contracts is not himself deceiving the company in order to make HIS numbers, and not get fired himself? If one or
some middle managers are doing this, that does not equal this being common practice within SouFun.

Then you dismissed some vitally important numbers in your article that are publicly available. In fact you are way, way
off.


Yes, SouFun had 11.642 employees at the end of 2014. However, during their aggressive foray into the offline agency
business the headcount went up to 37.200 employees by the end of June (see earnings call transcript for Q2). Due to
their aggressive pricing they undercut traditional agencies on the commission by several percentage points, taking a
commission of only 0.5% as compared to 2.5 - 3.0% traditional agents ask. That should have dried up business for
their competitors tremendously. It was easy for them to attract agents from their competitors and many joined. They
added 11.000 employees in Q1 and another 15.000 in Q2.


Now, Vincent had this to say during the last conference call:


"I will pick up this question. I think we added about 11,000 people in the quarter one; and in quarter two, we added
about 15,000, around, people in quarter two. And all together for the first half this year to July, as well we added more
than 25,000 people, mainly focusing on the transaction model. That's our core thing, going forward, our e-commerce
business because, at this stage, we still need agents to close the transactions, other than getting clients, getting
listings from online.


So, going forward, I think in the early stage expansion, because we're expanding into more cities, we're strengthening
our market share in the existing cities, so we are going to see and we're going to add more people into our transaction 
business.


Well, the result is good. In Guangzhou, Chongqing and Wuhan, those big three cities, since June and July we are
already number one players in the retail market in those cities. And for the 10 big cities in China, we have business
there for the retail market, every city we are now in the top five players, so it's paying off.


In the early stage, I would say half-year, 12 months or even 18 months or 24 months, we still need lots of people to do
the transactions. But with the automation process going on with our transaction technology platform coming up, the
efficiency will be much better in the future, comparing to today.


Up to that point, we will see the human resource are going to be stable and probably human resource, the agent staff
we have started even decreasing when we get to that point. So, that's something we are experiencing and it's also 
something we look into the future."


What you are seeing here is the separation of the wheat from the chaff. Off course, those faking contracts are the first
to go. Others, who simply are not aiding the aim good enough, will follow.


I actually see this as good news as it shows that they are working to get productivity up, which ultimately will help the
bottom line.

culmus, add to your sharp insights the fact that as SFUN edges more and more to the online transactional business
the need for sales staff commensurately decreases. so at a certain point the hiring is going to peak and you will see
an eventual reduction in staffing.

what also strikes me as out of sorts is why would they be making fake contracts when business is booming? that is,
we are in a government stimulated up cycle in China real estate. The only caveat is whether they are losing business
in a big way to competitors as their online business has been a bit late to the party.

I can say this though PUT buying today has been GINORMOUS! If you ever want to be a contrarian today is the day.
Should these intimations prove unfounded any CALLS you own will go ballistic.

I'm not worried about them being late. They are transferring their online dominance into the offline market, while
having an unbeatable price advantage. It's just that it could take a while before they combine their technology and
offline people into a very efficient transaction model. Could take up to 18 or 24 months as Vincent says.

It is he says she says. No solid proof of any wrongdoing. In China it costs a lot to lay off an employee. So firing them
saves money for the company. The employees would file complaints to get compensation at labor department thus
they are motivated to tell their stories to the government agencies.

From time to time there are online allegations of fake contracts booked by employees at various Chinese companies.
Sometimes the allegations may be true, but other times they could originate from disgruntled fired employees that
were targeted for cost cutting and are now making up stories, or even competitors. It should be no surprise that most
large organizations probably do have at least some rogue employees, albeit this is still not great to hear. Another thing
to bear in mind is that in a communist country, it may be politically easier to fire employees with accusations of faking
contracts, rather than fire them for the official reason of cutting costs and boosting corporate profits for the greedy
capitalist entity.


Assuming the fake contracts is a true story and the scale is pervasive, it is also not yet clear whether SouFun booked
them as revenue, which is a problem if they did, or held back from booking them as revenue because they were
unverified, in which case its still not good but the adverse value affect may be much less and SouFun is at least doing
something about it. If the story is true, pervasive, and fake contracts were recorded, Geo should look for evidence of
that on the balance sheet to help determine what is really going on.

It looks like SFUN has reduced employees by letting go those underperformers. If 1000 were let go, there would
bound to be some who would make up stories to hurt the company. Only four agents were fired due to fake contracts
as reported in the article. Linking the four with the thousand laid off is completely uncalled for unless there are more
facts. R.E. sales people are paid commission, thus fake sales would not help increase income, just fill some target
quota which would quickly show up as "failed deal". It is unlikely the company would encourage fake sales in a large
scale manner as the article seems to allude to. My conclusion: this article is not supported by facts but just an
extrapolation of rumors, it is more suitable for the National Enquirer type papers instead of SA.
